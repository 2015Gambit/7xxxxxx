Game info:
---------

Dark Omen is a real-time strategy game set in a fantasy world, where an alliance of humans, elves and dwarves are under siege by forces of orcs and a mysterious army of Undead. The game follows the adventures of Morgan Bernhardt, the mercenary leader of the famed Grudgebringer cavalry. Through a series of engrossing cutscenes, Morgan is hired to perform a number of ever-more difficult missions that involve recovering some powerful artifacts that might help the Empire defeat the rampaging horde of Undead.

Each mission begins with a set number of forces deployed on a 3D battlefield. You can opt for the default placement or hand-place your troops before combat begins (the latter is usually preferable). Once combat begins in earnest, you control your troops with keyboard and mouse, ordering them to move, charge, use their magic items or target missile weapons at a certain foe.

Unlike most real-time strategy games, there is never any resource gathering or base building. The game's entire emphasis is on combat, and winning can only be achieved by carefully managing your troops on the battlefield, reacting to the enemy's moves and planning your own counter-attacks. Victory is most often a matter of hanging back, lulling the enemy into range of your artillery, and wiping out as many enemies as possible at a distance before closing in hand-to-hand combat.
