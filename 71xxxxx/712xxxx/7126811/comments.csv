,tedwu,2012-04-19T07:23Z,RAS rip version is only out for demo. (if you dont know what's that it's just a non iso/image version) Around 1Gb that said this cannot be real. Even leaks dont happen often and never this early.
,dafix123,2012-04-20T13:41Z,"This is fake, but skidrow released the demo version

As there is no full version of the game out yet."
,drowmaster,2012-04-27T21:32Z,Actually ironymon the game is out on May 1st in the US and May 4th in Europe.  I don't know where you got the 8th from.
,Up5ka,2012-04-28T12:56Z,@dafix123 you can download the demo on steam and xmarket too -.-
,phenrik,2012-04-28T23:57Z,"I agree with drowmaster, The game comes 1st-4th of may, in europe and us. Perhaps 8th in Australia. And BTW there is a few times a developer, etc someone that has something to do with the game, gets a copy of the game earlier than the release. I cant exactly recall what game it was, but when i worked in a game store, we often got the copies a week before world release. And yeah we took copies home and tried them out. If someone has that chanse and knows how to crack and give out he/she is a hero :)
I havent downloaded this tho, i tried the demo and was hooked so this time i will buy and support rebellion for finally makeing this game :) after what 7 years :P it looks awsome :)"
,Renargen14,2012-04-29T17:42Z,"Stand-alone game shops can order ahead of schedule, they get one copy of the game to play preview titles on screen and the rest are empty boxes for shelves. The stand-alone are sent to the shops 6-10 days before release date.

But sadly, I'm not going to try my luck with this torrent."
,phenrik,2012-04-30T11:45Z,"I worked at Spider-man a game shop, we got several copies of the game a week before release. We werent allowed ofc to take it home, but sometimes we where allowed from the boss, but not often. And we wherent allowed to play online. Anywho, the developers are different they get copies home evry game they make, and they have the ability to make copy and crack :P hehe. So thats how it is done. I have never done it.. coz i dont know how it is done :P"
,phenrik,2012-05-01T13:08Z,"i see now that 16 is seeding, that meens someone has downloaded it, is it fake as it says or?

Had my doubts in this since its been here for over a month
