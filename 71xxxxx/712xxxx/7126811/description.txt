
The sequel to the highly-acclaimed 2005 game Sniper Elite, Sniper Elite V2 continues to offer gamers the most authentic World 

War II sniping experience by putting them in the middle of war-torn Berlin amidst the frenzied final battle between German and Russian forces.


With an emphasis on learning to handle the anticipation and pressure of the hunt, players are forced to use skill, patience and 

cunning to achieve their missions as they find themselves facing life-altering choices. The celebrated "bullet cam" from Sniper

Elite makes its return and will be more gratifying than ever. Skillful shots are rewarded with a slow-motion sequence of the bullet 

running its full trajectory from barrel to target as well as featuring graphic detail of the effects of the bullet entering and destroying a target.
