With CISPA on the cuff of being passed in the Senate and stuff, even tho I don't have Comcast, I'm gettin worried about getting switched off. If you're as paranoid as I am, either use Usenet where your IP address isn't displayed or look into BTGuard for torrent clients.

I'm not trying to be one of those ***holes who say, ""Oh I just got a DMCA letter, don't dL copyrighted stuff."" Just the opposite...protect yourself. It may cost about $7 USD per month, but it's better than getting slapped with a lawsuit. Later. "
