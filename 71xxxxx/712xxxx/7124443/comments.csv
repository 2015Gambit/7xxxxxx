Any problems with this 'upgrade'? Has somebody tested it yet?
On Macupdate.com many users are reporting about freezers of Toast after upgrading to 11.0.5, Drives are not found .....

---------------------------------------------
Never had a problem with Toast until now: After upgrading to Toast 11.0.5 (through in-app update) Toast keeps crashing on me -- more specifically, I don't get beyond the first Toast Setup assistant window -- the program freezes and then crashes; in short I can't launch the program anymore. Tried erasing preferences and repairing permissions -- didn't help. I'm on Lion 10.7.3. My rating reflects the latest update: 11.0.5. 
-----
Version 11.0.5 hosed my DVD writer after installing 11.0.5. Gets 99 percent done and then just freezes and never completes the burn.
-----
And it still reports 'no recorder found' under the latest developer release of OS 10.8. Tried to gently hint to Roxio last week that this was a problem. Got a snotty response that they wait for the public release before addressing problems from the public. No soup for me. "

I tested it and had no problems. Did the archive you use come from this torrent?


If so maybe the torrent got corrupted somehow...
