As always from me, a big thank you."

Hope Robert Plant's video and live clips gave you some nice minutes, too. I'm in load of most of his CDs I bought some time before I covered ebay music auctions. But each CD of R.P. & Led Zeppelin was worth to spend the money for. The videos are a nice add-on and remind me of what the people looked and acted like in this phases. Let's continue our common hobby. Love & peace from Southern Germany, Beaujoulais."
