,WoundedWolfgirl,2012-03-23T07:49Z,"Is it just me, or does it seem like a lot of TV shows/miniseries premiere in Canada before the rest of the world?
Well, right on, God bless Canada and TPB!
Thanks, TvTeam! Hope this is as good as Downton Abbey, though I doubt it will be. Hopefully it will be better than James Cameron's nauseating movie."
,popeye013,2012-03-25T20:10Z,"Only issue with this one, is that Global Tv Canada have a different edited version, as 7 minutes of footage has been cut to allow them to show it in one hour with the usual 18 minutes of advertising during the show and its so noticeable, as things happen and comments are made, but you have no idea what they are talking about because the part that would of explained it, was cut out.. 

So i'll wait for ITV1 in the UK to screen it and watch that version, as it won't be so heavily cut to accommodate fucking commercials and won't have a tv logo in the bottom of the screen obscuring things..  "
