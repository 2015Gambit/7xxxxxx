Ferments eBooks Collection (v.2012.03)

This is an exhaustive collection of more than 200 ebooks covering the topics related to fermentation: bread, dairy products (cheese, yogurt), distillation, meat, whiskey, grape and other wines and lot of general fermentation books.

I specially recommend the book -which is included- Handbooks of indigenous fermented foods from Steinkraus.
