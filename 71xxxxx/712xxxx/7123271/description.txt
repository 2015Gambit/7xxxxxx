All fingerings, any tuning, Chord is the ultimate chord charts book you'll need!
Chord! is mainly a guitar (or any fretted instrument) chord finder. Unlike most of the other apps, it generates itself chords diagrams, so it supports any chord (even slash ones like D/F#) in any tuning, with any number of strings (guitar, banjo, ukulele, bass, mandolin, etc.). You can fine tune to your needs the chord search algorithm, like specifying the maximal number of fingers or fret span for example.
You can hear how each diagram sounds by sweeping your finger across the strings. The diagrams are displayed in color and you can view stats about the current fingering.
You can also reverse search chords: Entering on a neck the fingering will give you instantaneously the possible names of the chord and you will then be able to explore possible variations.
