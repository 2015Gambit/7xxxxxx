WELL...I M TREMENDOUSLY SURPRISED THAT SOMEONE OTHER THAN ME ALSO NOTICED ""TUNNU KI TINA""....I ALSO WATCHED THE MOVIE ON DD A LOT MANY YEARS AGO.....AND TILL DAY LONG TO SEE IT AGAIN. I WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS BUT TO NO SUCCESS. I EVEN SEARCHED FOR VIRENDRA SAXENA (THE MOVIE'S MAIN PROTAGONIST) ON WEB AND SURPRISINGLY GOT HIS PERSONAL MOB NO. AND CALLED HIM THE NEXT DAY REQUESTING HIM TO PROVIDE SOME LINK FOR HIS MOVIE. BUT HE WAS QUITE ALOOF AND COOL....AND ADVISED ME TO CONTACT NFDC. MALIKJEE....I WUD B HIGHLY AND DEEPLY OBLIGED IF U CAN PROVIDE THIS RARE GEM SOME WAY."
