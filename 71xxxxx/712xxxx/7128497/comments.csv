,DubFreak,2012-07-05T02:04Z,I've been banned from TPB. Uploading all my new mixes to my soundcloud. -Landerz
,DubFreak,2012-07-10T21:05Z,New July mix (Dubstep) on my Landerz SoundCloud and it's siiiiiick. I tried to make up for the lack of mixes over the past few months (I've been very busy with work) so I made this one extra tight. Go get it before It reaches it's max download! Got a new extra special Moombahton mix in the works so stay tuned!
,DubFreak,2012-07-20T03:03Z,New July Moombahton mix!  Free DL on my SoundCloud -Landerz  I would have uploaded it here but my ISP has banned me from uploading anyting to TPB :/
,BigBrother1984,2012-07-22T17:20Z,"ISP Ban?  Just Google ""Open Proxy list"". And if you don't know how to use this info with your bit torrent client, Google that too. 

Unless your purpose here is to drive traffic to a paid download site. In which case, don't bother."
,DubFreak,2012-07-24T22:54Z,"I upgraded my SoundCloud so yes it is no longer free for ME but still free for YOU and you don't need torrent software you just click a arrow and your good to go.  If you've never used SoundCloud and your big on music, you really need to check it out."
,DubFreak,2012-07-26T23:57Z,I'm also on Demonoid and kat if your only interested in torrents.  I'm completely done uploading to TPB.
