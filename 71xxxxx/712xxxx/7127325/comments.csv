,jsniper34,2012-03-24T07:58Z,Does anyone know if this is legit?  
,frisbee90,2012-03-24T09:36Z,"Torrent is legit, it's only 12% done but I looked at the file in VLC and it is the new avatar series (compared it to the 1st episode that I watched in flash). Quality is really good too. "
,panikeke,2012-03-24T10:00Z,Will post A? V? When downloaded...we'll see if its legit
,frisbee90,2012-03-24T11:17Z,No 100% seeds.. one guy with 75% most stuck at 62%. http://imgur.com/a/ZcJFV for stills.
,Exjursa,2012-03-24T14:01Z,"Just downloaded and launched, best quality out there A10/V10"
,ExecutorE,2012-03-24T14:07Z,"maybe expecting that many seeds five hours after posting is a bit premature. It's plenty seeded now. Also, the file's legit. 
Just watched it. A9V9? Not sure how to rate stuff like this, but everything is clean and synced (and YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT etc etc)"
,jsniper34,2012-03-24T15:07Z,"A10/V10!!!  Best quality by far!  Amazing, in sync, and legit.  Thanks so much!  Cannot wait for more."
,1l3l_00cl,2012-03-24T17:24Z,"V - 10
A - 10

havent seen the episode yet so cant give rating on that but as per websites its been given a 9 so far its giving me maximum download speed that my internet speed allows :D if u wanna download go for it!"
,panikeke,2012-03-24T22:53Z,Great Quality! A: 10 V: 10!
,fusel100,2012-03-25T07:57Z,"legit torrent, but some pretty awful frame blending.  clearly a 24fps source that was encoded to 29.97.  not for the quality-obsessed.

,missbinks,2012-03-25T11:03Z,THE BEST.
,Yoshiseed,2012-03-26T08:20Z,"This never plays right for me on any video player. its allways different.

Windows player: Only audio
VLC : no audio, really slow video.

And its ONE video, but it say 1 and 2 episode."
,ShiroDream,2012-03-26T15:20Z,"@Yoshiseed, KMPlayer for the win! Totally free too."
,OmegaTaurus,2012-03-26T16:53Z,"Wanted to say thank you for the upload. It is brilliant quality and a stunning beginning to a new adventure. 

If I was being nit-picky then its a shame that it's all one file rather than being split in two but that's my personal preference. 

Once again, excellent job and keep it up!"
,mrafay31,2012-03-27T06:04Z,"I think the legend of korra will be more than a worthy sequel. 

As for the torrent, the frame rate seems to be a little low, but I dont know if thats my own PC's fault or not. Otherwise, 

A-10 (related note, the soundtrack for this new series is phenomenal)
V-8 (because of low frame rate, otherwise 10 but this is my personal experience)
Content- 11/10"
,mrafay31,2012-03-27T06:05Z,"A++, would watch again."
,anallyreally,2012-03-27T15:53Z,No files show up! Whyy
,xwaxrock,2012-04-17T06:21Z,"As someone else said, there is a serious FPS issue with this file. For me, it really detracts from the experience. I'll have to go with another higher quality torrent."
,Bagong68,2012-04-17T13:13Z,"A:10 / V:10
Great Quality, while hard to find the correct english subtitle. So i found 2 episode subs, the merged and sync. uploaded at eps 1 in www.addic7ed.com
