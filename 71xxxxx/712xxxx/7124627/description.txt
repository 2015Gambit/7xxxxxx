Welcome to Yeerks' Gamecube heaven!

My gamecube is dying. It has started to crash and freeze and overall, die.
My solution was to pirate gamecube games and play them on my computer with the 3 in 1 Magic Joybox
which allows you to plug a Gamecube controller into your computer via USB.

But alas, there were hardly any Game Cube games on the pirate bay, so I had to find them elsewhere.
Now I am giving back to my peers by giving them what I wished I could have found more easily.
