WWII Behind Closed Doors: Stalin, the Nazis and the West is a BBC/PBS documentary film on the role of Joseph Stalin during World War II. The 2008 film combines narrative-led documentary segments, interwoven by dramatic re-enactments, with actors representing main political figures of the period. The documentary lasts six hours. It has been aired in the United States in two hour segments.

The documentary carries information newly available to the public, from the Soviet archives, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. British historian Laurence Rees did the research compilation and lead writing for the series.

The series delves into such matters as the British, American and Soviet cover-up of the Katyn Forest Massacre; Churchill's agreement at Yalta that Stalin should keep his gains of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, including Kresy; the Polish population transfers (1944â&#x20AC;&#x201C;1946); and the betrayal or persecution of figures such as Marshal Georgy Zhukov, Vyacheslav Molotov and John H. Noble.

The narrative voice-over was performed by the narrator veteran of Ken Burns' PBS series, Keith David. Joseph Stalin is portrayed by Alexei Petrenko, Winston Churchill is portrayed by Paul Humpoletz and Franklin D. Roosevelt is portrayed by Bob Gunton.
