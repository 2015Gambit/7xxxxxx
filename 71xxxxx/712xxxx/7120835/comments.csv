,Xpatriated,2012-03-21T23:48Z,"That's strange, considering there are 45 seeds.  Have you gotten past the wall yet?"
,Xpatriated,2012-03-21T23:52Z,Probably just luck of the draw that no seeds have connected to you yet?
,Xpatriated,2012-03-22T00:02Z,"Well, whatever, I turned it back on and there are a bunch of seeds, and it's working when I do it, so I don't know what the problem is."
,Random_magic,2012-03-22T00:58Z,Thanks - the download worked great for me!
,LEMT,2012-03-22T09:03Z,"Tried it four times yesterday, always stopped at the same place, then today it went through without a hitch. Many thanks "
