Fantastic collection , I myself up at Demonoid but am considering adding here as well
BRAVO SIR BRAVO!! Marvelous diverse selection and QUALITY.
Is there any chance you could upload Children Of Paradise-Criterion or some additional film Noir like Gun Crazy or Murder My Sweet.
Are you a member at Demonoid if not I could send you an invite no problem it would be my pleasure.
Cheers
Again...fantastic selection and taste"
