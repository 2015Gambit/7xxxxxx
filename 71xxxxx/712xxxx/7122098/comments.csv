For those who don't speak Hindi, subs are necesary to watch this movies. The link you post it doesn't have any kind of subs.

To Team_xrg:

I have to say that in became a fan of Bollywood after watching slumdog millionare and Mangal Pandey; since then I have being downloading many many bollywood movies, (some are really good, some are bad) because it is the only way for me to reach them, im on the other side of the world (Mexico) but I thing India culture is fantastic. I have just one request, if you guys are able to upload ALL the subs languages available in the movie, im sure a lot of people from other countries will start watching and enjoying bollywood. Thanks"
