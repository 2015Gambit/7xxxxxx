,denizkorg,2012-03-23T17:19Z,"Hi-inspiron-! I have a problem! I'm the last three shows I can not download! I have gone here, the phrase ""Get Torrent File"". You would not be able to tell what happened! I really like the way you show all splits into smaller files!
Can anyone say that he is the same problemma???
Help please!"
,FileList1,2012-03-23T20:37Z,"I always listen to your SPLITTED ASOT episodes, but now because you included the UNSPLITTED version (what is played on di fm on radio), i decided to listen to the unsplitted file. So... after 20 minutes i checked about 3 times for track/tracklist because i wanted to repeat the song... this couldn't been possible. Searching for a track on a 2h episod is a little bit hard... so this is why i LOVE your SPLITTED tracks :)
I think listening to the continuous mix/unsplitted mix is pointless, unless you listen live on the radio.
Thx again, and sry for the long comment :)
PS: From now, after magnet link goes to uTorrent, and uTorrent downloads the torrent file list, i will uncheck downloading the unsplitted version... sorry. I just need the SPLITTED version what i willl seed all day-all night."
