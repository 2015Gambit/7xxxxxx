http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/617893-im-gonna-cry-my-skyrim-goes-to-hell/
and any load game always CTD

but i found what's wrong;

I've just unchecked Unofficial Patch in data files at skyrim launcher and everything went well in-game. good to go.

(just a theory, not that i know anything about but;) i believe the reason this happens is that skyrim launcher registers any activated .esp and .esm file with it's local address (eg. c:program filesskyrimdatamod.esp). Therefore to be able to activate/check unoffcial patch we may have to extract the contents to the exact same location that you installed the game in the first place since it has a 3rd party mod (unofficial patch) in it.

any else suggestions?"
,JohnHolmesII,2012-03-24T03:44Z,"@elrumel

You are totally failing at that:

2. With this workaround there will be no install option.
3. Data Files is not activated without the necessary steps editing the ini. How you fail to note this I just don't understand.

1. You can't run the launcher first without the ini preinstalled. Or are you telling that's what the Skyrim folder with ini you have included are for? And that Vista users like myself who daily fight with UAC should work from there, and not enforce the installment of required game files in documents and appdata?

2. mods doesn't work and it's a friggin nightmare to get them to, you are not making it any easier by calling people names after releasing a torrent you claim are good to go. 24 hours ago I loaded mods with your previous torrent, this new one however...! So much for wanting a clean install.

manually added the launcher command...

Option 1: Download the file directly

Option 2: Remove the torrent from your downloader and re-add it, set the download location to the same spot (don't override) and do a re-check (Usually a right click menu will have this option).

Thanks you so much! I don't know what I would've done without you!"
,JohnHolmesII,2012-06-19T01:41Z,"I'm working on a third release, with hopefully an even easier experience, so if you're willing to wait, you should."
,JohnHolmesII,2012-07-04T05:08Z,"The third release will be accompanied by a Troubleshoot program that should help to fix some common install problems. It is going well, but is unfinished.

Look for the third release (which will be patched to 1.6.89.0, with Creation Kit version 1.6.89.0, the accompanying SKSE, and a more recent Unofficial Patch) sometime after 4 July, and the Troubleshooter after that."

In the search box, type regedit

Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE-> SOFTWARE-> Wow6432Node-> Bethesda Softworks-> Skyrim

or

Neither does Bethesda."

Plus, I think the amount of effort you would have to put in if you just wanted skse is insane."
