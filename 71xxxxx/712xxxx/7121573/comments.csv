,Online.Pirate,2012-04-16T11:22Z,"I always used 3 uploaders for my TV shows..

Eztv, Vtv and ettv... altho I use to always prefer the first two over the third since they used single file folderless torrents...

However now ettv is the only tv uploader I use.

The great thing about ettv is not only have they moved to uploading mp4, but they have also stuck to uploading avi for the very large amount of people out there who want the avi."
