Saves doesn't work on this version because the savegame is saved to a desura account name folder, but the game doesn't recognizes your desura login, so you can't save games yet.

I didn't made the crack, the crack works for every version (but maybe they will apply a update that makes it doesn't work), the cracked files are
zombie/GameWindow.class, zombie/GameWindow$1.class and zombie/GameWindow$2.class,
The crack are already installed.

The launchers with number 2 at the end of it's name aren't included with release, but if the normal launcher doesn't work, you can use the one with number 2 at the end of it's name.
