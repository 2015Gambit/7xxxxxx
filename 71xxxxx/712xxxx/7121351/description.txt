The serial was written by Tony Basgallop, it is the story of an armed robbery at a secure money counting house, the events that lead up to it, characters who work there and the aftermath. It begins with a depiction of the brutal robbery and then explores the motivations of those who committed the crime. The three main characters are John Coniston (Steven Mackintosh) who is the seemingly straightlaced manager of the secure depot, Marcus (Warren Brown) who moves trolleys of cash and security guard Chris (Ashley Walters).
