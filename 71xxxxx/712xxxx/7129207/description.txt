Hello and welcome!

Congratulations on getting a cTrix USB Bottle Opener Mk II! 

This USB drive is part of a Limited run of 50, BUT this is a special version for Mexico City WITH EXTRA TRACKS!!!  There are only 5 :-)


You will find a whole load of material including:

- Music (Amiga/C64/A2600/DMG)

- Videos including Live @ Blip Japan 2011

- Bonus music (other non-chip unreleased stuff + weekly beats)

- Atari 2600 dev software (Windows)

- Amiga Disk Files for Emulator (Win/Mac/Linux)

- A guide to using an Amiga emulator and how to mount ADF files


All content (except software) is Creative Commons, 2011.

Most of the tunes are at least semi-mastered, and are recorded direct. 
The Gameboy stuff is pretty raw for the most part.  I had lots of 
requests to leave it untouched, so I just sequnced the live tracks 
and hit record.

Please note that the software is "as is" and used at your own risk.
This is a read / write device so I take no responsibility for the
software or anything that has happened to it since it left my PC!

Thanks for your support and look out for more releases in the future.

Send me a greet on the cTrix facebook page if you get a chance.  Let me know which number you got!
