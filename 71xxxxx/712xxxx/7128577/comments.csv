The audio is synced well but the quality is quite low considering the format. The video is of High Quality however there is a blurred watermark on the bottom 5% of the film. The movie is Spanish subtitled in English and some scenes are just in English. It is a B movie at best, not very thrilling nor scary. Not much better than your average Hollywood horror flick."
,muvelvr,2012-03-25T21:41Z,kinda scary if you're one of those people that dont keep a gun or knife handy.
