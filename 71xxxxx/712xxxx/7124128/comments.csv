Lets say I click a1019 model in the tester, the picture appears, the files appear, i have both data and model of a1019...

But the problem is that the model does not start, instead its just skipping through its files searching for a file to play....

So my question to you about it is.... what causes that and how can i fix it?

I already got your update to that model a1019 but it still doesnt want to play it.

Thanks for the lovely ladies ;)"

,xSumonax,2012-07-08T21:12Z,"Captain where has your program for VgHD gone? I lost mine for some reason, no idea where it went. It was for Deskbabes, DvD's 39, 40, 41.

I went to those Torrents and your Torrents for the cracked VgHD program is gone, the URL doesn't exist, 404.

What do I do?"
,xSumonax,2012-07-08T21:17Z,"Are you able to upload the program alone? That would help a lot, because I already have all the Models I like."
,xSumonax,2012-07-08T21:18Z,Also when are more DeskBabes coming?! :3
