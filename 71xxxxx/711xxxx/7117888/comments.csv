,Flyinby,2012-03-20T21:42Z,"Thanks for the file of a good new series; video and audio are decent, and file size isn't ridiculously large.  I don't care for the multiple rar files either, but no big deal to me."

To the whiners...OMFG....STFU!!!
Someone capped and uploaded this and is sharing it for FREE! 
If it's not what you're looking for then go look elsewhere...without leaving bullshit disrespectful comments. 
Btw, winrar and 7-zip take like five seconds to join the files. What's your problem ass holes. "
