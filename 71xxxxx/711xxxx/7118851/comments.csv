,spifkitten99,2012-03-21T15:02Z,Audio is out of sync. Fucking useless.
,spifkitten99,2012-03-21T15:03Z,"And no you fucking retards, it's not my player or codec or anything. This is out of sync, no matter what player is used, even with vlc.

If you don't think it's out of sync, then you are just a little disabled, and not able to see it. "
,urmom8me,2012-03-21T17:49Z,"@spifkitten99, way to complain about something you get for free. Classy. "
,AnimeFury,2012-03-21T19:57Z,"This is not out of sync whatsoever, just watched entire episode and it's perfect."
,csabaxb,2012-03-21T21:33Z,"Good torrent, fast download, clean, a/v-9, IN SYNC!!!, funny episod, big thanx uploader and seeders"
,spifkitten99,2012-05-30T21:06Z,"urmom8me, Are you really retarded enough to think that it being free has any relevance?

AnimeFury, it's not up for discussion whether it's out of sync or not. It's a fact, even if you aren't sharp enough to detect it."
