Them, Robot

Mr. Burns replaces all of Springfield Power
Plant's employees with robots (guest voice
Brent Spiner) but decide to keep Homer as
the sole human worker. With unemployment at
an all-time high and mechanical arms
operating the workplace, Springfield
becomes a dismal and humorless place. But
when Homer's machine-programmed peers start
to turn on the community and his former
real-life employees come to the rescue,
they all realize that robots can't replace
human friends
