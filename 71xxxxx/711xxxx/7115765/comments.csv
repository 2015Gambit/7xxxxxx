[T],eXPer1ence,2012-03-20T15:05Z,"Cheers VTV. 

Now I just need to find out why the F ""Big Bang Theory"" S05E20 doesn't exist anywhere yet. 

Why does the US show 19 episodes then leaves it 3 weeks for the next one? We don't do this shit in England I know that much. 

Thanks uploader."

[T],eXPer1ence,2012-04-03T13:08Z,"This torrent is genuine, look at the green skull, look at the comments, we all know its genuine...

BUT...

Watch out for the lying bastards posting S07E20 already.

I just got caught out by one of them, it was a password protected RAR file, you have to visit this website to get the password, fill in this survey... FUCK YOU.

I hope The Pirate Bay bans these pricks as soon as they discover the torrent is a fake!

I also hope people DDoS the shit out of these websites, after all if they are stupid enough to give us the url to their shitty fake website.... we can do pretty much anything including making sure these fools don't profit from legit TPB users that only wanted the password."
