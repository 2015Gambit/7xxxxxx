,inf0x0,2012-03-21T13:36Z,"Don't listen to that retard, although it isn't high-res it does extract fine into a SD .mp4 rip and plays fine (SD)."
[V],spastik64,2012-03-21T13:55Z,I don't like .RAR releases... but sure it works if you extract ir correctly
,DumbLuck,2012-03-21T16:47Z,"When I extract it, it comes up as a .wmv file, not an .mp4. Further, VLC and quicktime both crash when I play it. I'm running a Mac, so maybe that has something to do with it. This guy is a reputable uploader, so I'm not saying it's bullshit, I'm just saying I can't open it."
,DumbLuck,2012-03-21T16:52Z,"OK, now it's working, I had to re-download and re-extract it, my bad. The other torrent of this same episode is corrupted though. But this one works."

,haveatit,2012-03-22T02:29Z,"got it to work by opening vlc, clicking on the file in the DL folder, it then showed up and played from the vlc playlist"

,zauriel80,2012-03-22T05:57Z,"Sceneline, dude, where's the 720p of this? And why does hardly anyone post new Tosh.0 eps on TPB anymore? It's still a very popular show."

,bigred111,2012-04-09T03:41Z,can someone please HELP why are my magnet links taking like a few mins to show up in bitcomet (the box where u choose the file save location)
,bigred111,2012-04-09T03:45Z,why is it taking so long for my magnet links to show up???
,xpmule,2012-06-06T08:19Z,"if you googled what a magnet link is you wouldn't have asked that ;)

And crying and getting mouthy about formats you can't play is pretty funny lol

I honestly don't think I've downloaded a video i couldn't play in 10+ years of downloading and yet i see people bitching constantly on TPB about bad video uploads..
Half you people are fucking retards and shouldn't be using the internet at all !
Do your homework + stfu .

Nothing like lippy brats thinking they know stuff when they don't even have the intelligence to use google lol"
,xpmule,2012-06-06T08:23Z,"oh and by the way ALL scene groups release ALL videos packed in .rars..
Its just that uploaders at TPB spoil stupid little kids and upload them unpacked because half of TPB users arn't smart enough to unpack a .rar
and sadly this leads to lower quality and higher corruption and less integrity.
Things are / were packed for a reason."
,Kirsty_k86,2012-09-13T10:40Z,Dont waste your time
