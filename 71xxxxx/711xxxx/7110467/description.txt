The second volume in Trikont's Death Music series is not quite as eclectic as the funeral marches on Dead & Gone 1, but just as entertaining and in this case, demented. This is the humor part of the series. For starters, 13 of the collections 22 tracks are in English. They range from the Beasts of Bourbon's 'Rest in Peace' to Lydia Lunch's scary reading of 'Gloomy Sunday' to the Geto Boys' 'I Just Wanna Die' to Diamanda Galas' 'Blind Man's Cry.'
The pace of the record works as well as anything else - with every few songs, the level of depression gets to its lowest point and is relieved with black humor. The creepiest moment is on the album's closer from Gary Floyd, a solid singer/songwriter and formerly the frontman for the sensitive and poetic punk band the Dicks. His 'From the Darkness to the Light' is a folk song of truly deadly proportions. This is a song about the process of death itself, and though it tries to be optimistic, it still comes off as macabre. Galas, who is known for her shocking gothic horrorscapes of sight and sound, sings a poem by Paul Verlaine and turns it into a Spanish death song, using the full range of her gorgeous voice. In all this is one weird record, but it's fun one - and if you can laugh about death in one moment and be scared even more in the very next, that means that the producers have done their job well.
