,SourDeez,2012-03-21T05:47Z,does this have multiplayer?
,ryzy,2012-03-21T08:38Z,No it haven't . This is only compressed version of scene release. If you want multiplayer - buy game - it should be cheap now.
,nezamisliv,2012-03-22T15:15Z,"I have a question. I can't read the letters in game, it's all fuzzily, what is the problem? "
,ryzy,2012-03-22T17:10Z,@nezamisliv Maybe try another resolution
,nezamisliv,2012-03-22T22:45Z,I tried. The same result. Thank's for upload :)
,ryzy,2012-03-23T07:24Z,"@nezamisliv - sorry to hear that

I have no solution for that. I thought if i uploaded 100% tested game that will be no problems.

Maybe update your graphic card drivers? or reinstall game - lot of time i know :("
,nezamisliv,2012-03-23T12:12Z,It doesn't matter. The problem is probably in my computer. Thank's for advice :) 
,Vladel,2012-03-27T05:55Z,"Does this need Daemon tools or is it a direct install? I mean, run the unpack.bat and will it automatically install everything?"
,ryzy,2012-03-27T08:30Z,@Vladel Yes it is direct play but it don't create game shortcut on your desktop. So to play game run .exe file from game folder
