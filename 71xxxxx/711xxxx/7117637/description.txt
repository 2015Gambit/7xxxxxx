Since this is a 2CD release there is a generous selection of tracks across five official studio albums. In fact Colour By Numbers ΓÇô regarded by most as their best album ΓÇô is here almost in its entirety, with only two songs missing. Colour By Numbers ΓÇô the track - wasnΓÇÖt included on the album but did feature as a b-side. ItΓÇÖs a particularly strong song worthy of its inclusion on this set (it is also a bonus track on the 2003 reissue of the album).

Debut Kissing To Be Clever is similarly well represented, with seven out of the nine tracks included, plus the non-album single (in many territories) Time (Clock of the Heart).
