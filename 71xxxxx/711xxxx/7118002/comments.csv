My Nook Loves You."
,antoinesplot,2012-03-20T23:32Z,Thanks so much - great books
,raindr0ps,2012-03-21T03:01Z,Why RAR? I see three files: one with the books and what kind of SPAM are the other two? Why should I download ALL the books when only one may interest me? Thanks for the upload but I don't believe your mission is sharing as much as it is trying to profit from the online community that does believe in sharing.
[V],ThumperTM,2012-03-21T12:24Z,"Hello,

This torrent is not created by me... but i have uploader premissions to uplaod here :)

Thanks"
,press2012,2012-03-21T14:12Z,Thanks for posting. Anyway to see what is inside the torrent. I used to be able to just pick and choose what books I wanted but now with magnet links I don't know how to do that. TIA.

With a single .rar file it makes no difference, as you have to DL the complete .rar to view it. I find a magnet link gets the file list populated in the torrent client within a few seconds anyway. UL'er has provided links to the current list anyway. "

I would be so appreciative!!!"
