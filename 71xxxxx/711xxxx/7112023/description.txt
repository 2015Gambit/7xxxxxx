ReleaseNotes:

This low-key supergroup effort by Harrison, Dylan, Orbison, Petty and Lynne was a well deserved hit when it was released in 1988, peaking at No. 3 on Billboard's album charts. And justifiably so. The album is filled with wonderfully crafted (if sometimes slight) and enjoyable songs. In hindsight, that appeared to be the goal of this project--to have a good time. There are no superstar trappings here. All songwriting credits are attributed to the Traveling Wilburys. In fact, real names are not to be found anywhere on the album.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
