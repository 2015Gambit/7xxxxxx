This patched version fixes the bug on modern computers where
Marble Drop hangs on completing a level. No need for
compatibility mode.

These files are not from the CD, but are the actual game files. 
The Marble Drop installer is 16-bit, which means it doesn't run
on 64-bit OSes.

To play the game:
1. Run the marbledrop.reg file. This only has to be done once.
2. Start marble.exe!

The game still suffers from the "black screen on startup"-bug.
This is fixed by dragging the window out of sight and then back
again.

I don't think there are any other game-breaking bugs, if you can
find any, please post about them in the comments.
