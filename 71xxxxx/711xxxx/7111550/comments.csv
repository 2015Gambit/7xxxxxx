,MirMinsky,2012-03-18T21:18Z,You are a legend - thanks so much!
,nobodynever,2012-03-18T22:01Z,"I hate the fact that the BBC pretty much gave up on us.  Fuck you, you slimey British shitbags."
,SerSpec-V,2012-03-18T22:06Z,Thanks Mate! I prefer HD but the file size would be huge and it would take so long to DL. I liked BBC 1 coverage better than Sky. Thanks again!
,soryu,2012-03-18T23:02Z,anyone know where the HD version at?
,nobodynever,2012-03-18T23:13Z,With F1 you truly do need HD.

,Iforgotmyothername,2012-03-19T08:06Z,"I miss Eddie, David, and Jake :( At least there is Martin and Ted. Good Rip tho! Sky is still better than SPEED. Fuck I hate living in America..."

,Vettel45012,2012-03-19T17:12Z,"Awesome, please do what you can to keep these in avi format going forward. my PS3 can't handle my F1 MKVs. It has for a few tv shows but mostly not. and i've not found a reliable converter, my fave just made the playback too broken."
,shreddir,2012-03-20T04:27Z,Anybody find the HD torrent for Skysports yet?  The .mkv version looks so much crisper!

,angh_rock,2012-03-22T04:11Z,thank u footy....splendid work!
,Iforgotmyothername,2012-03-22T06:31Z,Ok I'm from america. Been torrenting F1 for about 3 years now because the coverage here is speed and it is absolutely terrible. I really enjoyed BBC coverage the last 2 years and this year it is sky. Can someone explain this to me? Will BBC be doing any races this year? 
,danlegion,2012-03-22T14:39Z,BBC will only cover certain race as mention last season
