KCUV FM102.3 Broadcast Ebbets Field, Denver, Colorado. 19th July, 1973.

"Released in February 1973, Dixie Chicken was Little Feat's third album, 
and significantly, the record that founding members Lowell George and 
Bill Payne had been promising to make since forming the band in 1969. 
After several false dawns, including the band at one point splitting up 
temporarily due to a lack of commercial success, with Dixie Chicken, 
a reformed and revised Little Feat had grabbed themselves a piece of 
New Orleans funk to augment their already fantastically eclectic sound 
and laid down ten of the hottest tunes of the band s entire career. 
The album was a hit, the group were steamin and it was time for the new 
line-up to hit the road. On the evening of Thursday 19th July 1973 in the 
intimate surrounds of Ebbets Field in Colorado, Little Feat played two shows, 
with the team from KCUV FM on hand to broadcast both. The two sets performed 
featured similar track-lists, and while this CD features the late show in its entirety, 
as a bonus the three tracks from the earlier performances that weren t played again, 
are also included here. With a truly powerful delivery, wonderful sound throughout, 
and the band as tight as they ever were, this now legendary gig represents one of 
North America s truly iconic bands at their very finest - and in a performance that 
might well be the best they ever played.''
