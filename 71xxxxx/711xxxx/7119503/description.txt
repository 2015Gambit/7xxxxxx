Renowned filmmaker Shane Meadows follows up the explosive award-winning This Is England '86 with This Is England '88.

Meadows picks up the action in the Christmas of 1988 as Lol struggles to cope with what life has thrown at her. Haunted by the devastating events which took place 18 months previously, she finds her reserves of strength ebbing away. With her soul mate Woody, heartbroken from her betrayal and in self-imposed exile from the gang, Lol becomes increasingly isolated and alone. 

They say Christmas is a time for forgiving and for forgetting, a time of love and laughter and joy ever after. But when all hope seems lost, what peace is there to be found? This is Christmas. This is England.
