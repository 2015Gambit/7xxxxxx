,Jona198102,2012-04-22T10:06Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!! 

Patch creates a malicious .bat file which deletes program links from User's App/Data/Roaming folder. Had no link to command prompt, notepad, etc as well as about 10-15 other FOLDERS which had been deleted!! SF Checker will NOT restore!! Luckily, had not purged System Restore point to before install and was able to roll back successfully!

Uploader, you are a POS!!!"
,Jona198102,2012-04-22T10:54Z,"Many apologies to the uploader.

This did NOT cause my problems. I found the culprit that did. And it was in an uninstall, of all places.

Again, this one is okay!!"

Much better then all others and so much easier then only Partition Recovery.

Even recovered straight to my other comp. in the network.

If it was not so expensive I would buy it, just to support the creator."
