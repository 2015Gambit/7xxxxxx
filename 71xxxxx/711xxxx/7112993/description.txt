This is the massive Portuguese wordlist that I found for Golden-joint.com. All three of the parts have to be taken from the .rar file. Afterwards you have to extract the master.txt file. Most of you probably know that, but some may not notice it.

The file is so large, you gotta open it directly on your cracking program. You can't open it in wordpad or notepad, it'll crash it.

It's supposed to be used in case you gotta crack any Brazilian or Portuguese sites, or even any sites with a option for the Portuguese language.
