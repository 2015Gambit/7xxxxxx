,Erenath,2012-03-19T00:16Z,"Its good but not great.. The video is cropped, and that's annoying.. And some places it suddenly turned black and white..  

I don't even know what to rate this vid with.... "
,joeylamb,2012-03-19T05:15Z,It's a screener the black and white occur so people won't copy them just like watermarks. Duhh...
,IsoSucks,2012-03-19T08:12Z,"LOL at you people,
when a movie has black and white in parts of the movie,
someone got this as a pre release who owns a video shop, "
,legleger,2012-03-19T20:14Z,"a-v-9

black and white some very small parts in the movie

stop whining idiots !

movie i give it 6 out of 10"
,Le-Pirate,2012-03-20T13:22Z,"V: 7 (Have short periods of black and white)
A: 8 (Very decent quality) 

M: 2 , Waste of time, the plot is a total Hangover Bangkok ripoff (Just worse), It's so easy to see through no excitement, not enjoyable imo. 

Overall: Not worth the download (Only if your looking for a movie to shaq your girlfriend to).

Keep sharing - And thanks for up LegendET!

,iamhelix,2012-03-21T05:15Z,"as soon as i found out its in australia i stopped the download, All movies made by australians or set in australia are crap, full stop. I have never seen a Great movie made by australians. maybe 1 or 2 OK films but never a great one. I have watched about 5 movies a week for the last 10 years, and they are almost always complete rubbish, over the top drama films trying to win a film festival award. "

,moneypenny84,2012-03-21T09:33Z,To iamhelix-the reason you've never enjoyed an aussie film is because you need a sense of humour.Twat.
,jayhanton,2012-03-21T19:09Z,"@ iamhelix

WATCH ""CHOPPER"" THEN YOU FUCKING COCKSUCKER!!!! great aussie movie."

,geoffuz,2012-03-22T10:28Z,"@iamhelix what utter shit. This is an absolute pisser if you understand Aussie humour, which you obviously dont."
,dfl3506,2012-03-22T12:49Z,iamhelix  Go root your boot!
,DViousUML,2012-03-23T10:04Z,"to iamhelix - what other countries do you hold in such racist regard?

Personally, I have a growing problem with hollywood movies.  It's not a country, I know, but it has its own culture.  

Maybe I'm just angry at Scorsesee for making Hugo.  It is quite awful (like he looked to Spielberg for ideas) for an adult to watch.  If I were a kid watching it, I might lose faith in the future."
,Elvemere,2012-03-24T01:15Z,"@Iamhelix....How can you say all Australian movies are crap...obviously never watched Man from Snowy River, Moulin Rouge, Red Dog, Pharlap, Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Muriels wedding, Kenny, Charlie and Boots, Mad Max series, Crocodile Dundee, Gallipoli, Breaker Morant, Babe, Shine, Happy Feet, Tomorrow when the war began, The Kings Speech (Aussie actors, Australian producer and 1/2 Aussie Director), Legend of the Guardians the owls of ga'hoole, The Cup and many many more...sorry if you don't have a sense of humour or that our movies aren't cookie cutter movies...you may want to consider how many of your hollywood movies are written, directed and produced by aussies and use aussie actors. A lot of the time you are watching an aussie movie and have no freakin clue!"
,bernardjk,2012-03-24T02:07Z,Any one got the Soundtrack ?

M1 possibly the worst film ive ever seen picture quality and sound very good ,picture flickers bland and white odd time"
,4stanktoe,2012-03-28T00:41Z,"iamhelix ...well said, and I think that most people agree with you. Aussie films are usually not worth downloading. "
,dfl3506,2012-03-28T03:31Z,4stanktoe You are another fucking idiot fed on Hollywood garbage full of car crashes and explosions.
,elandem,2012-03-29T13:32Z,"@Elvemere, I agree, these are all fantastic movies. Australian cinema should be given a lot more credit.   I can think of a hell of a lot more American films that should never have been created."
,ozforme,2012-03-30T04:44Z,"@Elvemere, Agree, however I think Mad Max was called Road Warrior in the states."
,kasanovah,2012-03-30T05:17Z,"@dfl3506, I do like all sorts of movies including australian films, but i like car crashes and explosions just as much as the next guy, you cant have an argument on that, i call it action and think its great expecially on a big screen and surround sound its not my problem you just havent gotten the full effect or hit puberty"
