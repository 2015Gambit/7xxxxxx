Here is Skrillex's 1st album - Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites

320kbps 44.1khz high quality .mp3 files

I have put First Of The Year Equinox on this album even though it's off his other album - More Monsters And Sprites. This is because I personally think the song is good but the other album isn't (because it's all remixes) If you don't like it then just delete it :)

All songs fully formatted in iTunes with: title, artist, genre, cover etc.
