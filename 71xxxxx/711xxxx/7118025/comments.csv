Followed directions ( which i knew wouldnt work ), and LO AND BEHOLD! - no password for this torrent. There are a couple of passwords for other supposed torrents by this uploader, but not for this one."

,PunkBuzter,2012-09-04T02:19Z,"why do you upload passworded torrents?

1, your link doesn't work

2, never put a password on a .rar file unless it's 
containing private content you just wanna share with a few friends on the net. but you didn't upload these presets for personal share since you made a presentation in the info file.

3, don't upload trash! there's plenty of doctors who can help you find better things to do instead of wasting broadband.

4, congratz on your next dislike here on TPB, i'd personally dislike your facebook page too if it was possible and if that link actually worked :)"
