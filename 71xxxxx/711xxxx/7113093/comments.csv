,cmoschip,2012-03-19T11:44Z,"As do I, megamobro."
,Dashman666,2012-03-19T13:13Z,"Mega, I almost have to agree with you!  However the Mexico adventure was pretty good.  This season is a big disappointment:-("
,drunkjoker333,2012-03-19T16:00Z,you guys are fucking stoned. this is a great series and if you don't like it quit watching it. simple as that
,notchjohnson1,2012-03-20T01:29Z,"@spryguyz, thats not what megamobro was sayin.

however, i think this season is hilarious so whatever. hope they dont stop even though i think this is the last season"
,xniggler,2012-03-20T13:28Z,@Dashman666 i have to disagree...

,ajnsd,2012-03-21T15:37Z,"I have to agree with @Nothjohnson1, season 2 has been excellent. The 2nd episode was epic. Although considering how funny this show is, it's hard to believe they've kept it up this long. "
,onryou74,2012-03-22T15:43Z,Fuck that shit. You people sound kinda stupid right now. This show is excellent and it isn't going anywhere.
