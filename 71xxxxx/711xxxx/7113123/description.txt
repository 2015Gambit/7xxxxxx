Union is the thirteenth studio album by British progressive rock band Yes, released in 1991. 
It was so called because it brought together the previous Yes album's lineup (Chris Squire 
Trevor Rabin, Alan White, Tony Kaye) and the then ex-Yes members group Anderson Bruford 
Wakeman Howe (Jon Anderson, Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman, and Steve Howe).


After Big Generator in 1987, Jon Anderson teamed up with ex-Yes men Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman 
and Bill Bruford. The result was Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, released in 1989 and supported 
by a successful tour. Because of the separate existence of Yes (part of the band's name still 
being owned by Chris Squire), this alternate incarnation were forced to use their surnames as 
the band's name after Squire threatened legal action. Meanwhile, Yes began composing and 
recording material for their follow-up, while Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe did the same
beginning production at Miraval Studios in the South of France in April 1990.
