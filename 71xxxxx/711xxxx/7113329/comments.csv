why can't anyone make a complete copy ?"
,Risko.,2012-03-20T00:13Z,ORENJI always do this. Every week I am praying for Immerse or Dimension to rip tonight's episode.
,Tiny Turtle ,2012-03-20T14:44Z,Personally I prefer no recap as I've already seen it the previous week (if not immediately before this episode) - Good thing you guys can enjoy Immerse's and Dimension's rips and I can stay with Orenji. :)
,islandinthesun,2012-03-21T02:04Z,"hi risko,
likewise living in hope of immerse or dimension hdtv rips."
,Pirate364403,2012-06-03T19:20Z,"Listen Orenji; if you're going to keep UL'ing stuff can you pls stop using .mkv files? They're shit and don't carry the quality of other platforms. And before anyone tells me to get this program or that, fuck off, if someone provides a service it's not up to me to meet them halfway. "
