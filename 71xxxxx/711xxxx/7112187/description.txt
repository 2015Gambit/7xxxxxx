MisterMusic Show 193 (indie, alternative, rock radio) 2 hours.

New music on this week's show from Beach Fossils, White Rabbits, Keane, Hot Chip, and another new track from the latest Shins cd. Plus we go back to 1990 in the 'Oldie of the Week' segment for a hit that was actually a cover of a song by the Rolling Stones.

All that plus the usual blend of new indie and alternative music with flashback hits from the past.
