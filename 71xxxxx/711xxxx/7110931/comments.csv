[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-03-18T03:01Z,Is this uncensored? I would really love to hear South Park with the swearing! I heard Robot Chicken uncensored for the first time only a couple of weeks ago and it was even more awesome!!! PS- Thanks so much for your really nice uploads :)
,thebull492000,2012-03-18T16:20Z,"To GaryBradbury2012: Yes it is uncensored. But what you should know is that based on the size of the files and seeing them after downloading. They are not high definition!!! So if you are actually looking for High Definition, this is not for you"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-03-18T16:33Z,"Thank you for the reply. 480p quality or standard XviD rips are fine for me. Once again, Thanks :)"

GaryBradbury2012 wasn't asking about resolution, he was asking if the eps are uncensored.  (Reread his comment.)

Further, nowhere in the torrent's title or description does it suggest the episodes are High Definition.

Even though you think you have cleverly unmasked a conspiracy of SD being represented as HD, you have in fact highlighted your noobness concerning torrent and filenaming conventions."
