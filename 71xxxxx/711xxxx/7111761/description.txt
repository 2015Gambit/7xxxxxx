A few things, folks.

This concert has "Final" in the title, but it is NOT the final Miku concert! It's the last concert using the current CG models. Kaito and Meiko also perform in this concert!

This was provided to me by a generous YouTube user. The original video was taken down after a copyright complaint was received - not from Crypton, but from "sega" [sic]. This is a growing problem. A person or persons who do not like Miku and the other Vocaloids are making fake copyright claims and getting videos pulled from YouTube, and video creators are getting banned. YouTube has its head up its ass and is taking actions without investigating the veracity of the claims. To me, this represents everything that's wrong with copyright law - abuse and bullying.

Fans have responded by downloading and re-uploading the affected videos, filing disputes with YouTube, and trying to track down the trolls. More info at http://www.savemiku.com .

Finally, this concert just premiered on Nico Nico Douga and there is obviously no physical media release yet, but if you like it, please support it when available.

Enjoy!
