,kandei,2012-04-16T04:03Z,Um... no password... it's an mp4 video.
,PhoenixRuby,2012-05-05T19:20Z,"real, but it being mp4 means the quality is only decent despite it being 720p.

Also, it cuts out at the end for no apparent reason near the end of a song after the unnecessarily long encore chant... seriously, its huge..."
,Doremonhg,2012-06-19T10:09Z,I'm pretty sure the attacker are Korean.
,Kagamine,2012-08-13T13:40Z,"Why does it cut out at the end? Seriously, the Melt encore is enormous."
,kandei,2012-09-21T06:19Z,"Sorry folks, I thought I checked to make sure the file was intact... Imma look through the originals the user gave me to see if the encore is intact.

@Doremonhg, Koreans were never responsible. Without revealing too much and scaring this wanker off, info has come in that the faker was Japanese. Also, my bad - ""sega"" looks fake for all the world, but it turns out it really is the director of the concerts asserting his IP. (It's still annoying, and that's what G-d made piracy for.) (:

Nico Nico Douga has support for overseas accounts now, so I will be grabbing videos directly from there whenever possible. Still not great quality, but at least it's something.

Thanks all for feedback!"
