The fifth track, ""The Hours,"" cuts off short, but that seems to be the case with all copies out there.  Still, THANK YOU for letting us have this album two months in advance!  A rare case of an Anonymous uploader being legit!  Kudos!  THIS IS THE REAL DEAL AND WORTH THE DOWNLOAD!  If you're not a fan yet, now's the time to start!"
,martti222,2012-04-03T09:30Z,why would someone upload mp3's with 160kbps quality? because 320kbps would take too much space? LOL?
,happymondays20,2012-04-03T12:34Z,Is this the copy with the cut off on track 5?
