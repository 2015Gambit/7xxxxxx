,thewickedjon,2012-03-22T05:41Z,"Your contributions are great, Thank you very much!

 I was wondering if there is any way I could install this on an SSD for my HP MINI 110 3118cl (2gb ram upgrade). I have an earlier version(win xp w/ sata drivers) but it did not work.

 Kept getting error message when setting up windows.

Win 7 installs fine on SSD but I find win xp feels faster on the netbook.  So for my netbook i'd very much like xp, from the ssd if possible.



 Could you help me out here?"

Nice work by the way ;D you are the O.S King.

[V],Maherz,2012-03-29T10:50Z,"@boyslo
Did the torrent finish to 100%?

@Bossak
I'm sure you will like it ;)
You need to install a small program (HashTab), Google it ;)
Good luck.

@{wasalnaser}
You're welcome my dear brother.

@liluser
Man, if Microsoft want to block it would have done so 4 years ago!!
Type MR49R-DRJXX-M6PX2-V96BF-8CKBJ into Google and see results.
Do you think Microsoft is blind??
Finally, thanks for your ratings!!"
,Bossak,2012-03-31T02:16Z,Hi there again! Has i promise i have tested the windows! I have down___it at good speed! And i have burned it into a CD at lowest speed possible! I have installed it and installed all my drives needed it runs well fast and no problems but don't get me wrong i don't know why but this was not fully updated for me it missed windows media 11 and about 20 updates. I didn't get any warning of pirated key or something its all good i have installed Security essentials and its ok with the serial key! This is a good Activated windows! Trust me! The bad thing is only the updates you still have to do! About 20!
,D255,2012-04-02T15:22Z,"Maherz & liluser;
dont fight between you.

i respect both of you..."
,krissh,2012-04-03T15:25Z,"What does it mean Intergrated March 2012?

,tomandjerryinternet,2012-04-06T03:11Z,WHY CAN I NOT BURN THIS IMAGE FILE. PLEASE HELP
,roy2646,2012-04-08T05:35Z,"@ D255, no they don't have an argument, what happened was somebody posted the xp cd key in the torrent of liluser that's why the later was afraid that microsoft might get blacklisted that key, liluser is only seeking the opinion of Maherz. Am I right Mr. Maherz? But don't you know that Maherz and liluser, both of them are using the same xp cd key? Yes I know because I have a copy of both their works."
,lort1942,2012-04-10T23:39Z,"@Maherz
I'm very disappointed with this release of yours. There are several things that are annoying me which you haven't described on the info. These info are important.

Anyway, let me make this very clear. This release doesn't require password. Those who do experience this issue must format their computer since it is asking for the old password.

My biggest disappointment are:
.NET Framework + its update are not integrated in this release.
WMP11 + updates are not integrated.
Silverligt + updates are not integrated.

In all, there were more than 250 MB of updates that weren't integrated on this release. BIE does a much better release since there are only few necessary updates with BIE.

Also for first time with Maherz's release my pc crashed. Normally my never never crashed with XP and with your release my pc actually have had many problems with OS."
,boyslo,2012-04-11T12:12Z,"@Maherz : yes, the torrent had 100%, but can't open it with power iso or daemon tools, it says the name is invalid,

it looks somebody else has the same ting with me"
,AllzCool123,2012-04-13T06:30Z,WTF with so many negative comments & the Negative rating? Maherz XP CD's have always worked flawlessly for me. Need this for a friend but I guess I will skip this one & download Maherz January 2012 release. Thanks Maherz :)
,bladeshrk,2012-04-13T06:59Z,"When are you going to upload April release?
see you soon"
