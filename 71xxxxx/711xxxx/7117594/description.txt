Description
Le Domaine Perdu (The Lost Domain) (2005) Raoul Ruiz

One of Ruiz' least-known and best movies, a complex mixture of
historical detail (WW2, Chilean military coup), autobiographical
nostalgia (30's in Chile), fantasy (characters emerge from a
classic French novel), a meditation on time and old age, and
much more besides.  In fact, if there is one criticism of the
film, it is that insufficient time is allowed for all these
elements to develop and cohere. I've read some reviews which
judge Ruiz' film to be "technically excellent" but at the same
time "cold and distant". While this may be true for many of Ruiz'
works, I don't find it so for Le Domaine Perdu, and of all his
films I think that this is the most emotionally involving,
especially the devastating final section.
