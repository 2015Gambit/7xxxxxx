,doctortonic,2012-03-25T17:41Z,"What is the md5sum / sha for this image?

Something is WRONG and WIERD with this torrent! 

My MD5 sum for this image wich I downloaded is 

dc87b42bbd1b60099e33790b5798dd11 

and this is the THIRD (third) Time I get it. 

If I boot with "" knoppix testcd "" I have this screen.

"" Checking KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX...Failed! ""

So the image is corrupted?!.... "

I have tested this and it boots and installs just fine."
