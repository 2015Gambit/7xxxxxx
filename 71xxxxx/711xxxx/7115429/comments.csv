,Samqra,2012-03-20T06:22Z,"looks awsome, but i hope u have a good bandwidth to support 50 GB!

downloading now..."
,Gil_Y,2012-03-20T08:13Z,"Thanks Samqra,

I been looking at the swarm for 8 hours now :)
Can't seem to take my glance away from it - I guess i'm in shock!

I mean, I'm just 1 guy - and 1 guy have limits to what he can do... it's logical :)
But 20 mins after I uploaded it I see 200 people putting their machines to the effort.
I can't even have enough words to explain what I feel - I just love you people!
Just imagine you about to do somthing and few mins later 200 people come to help you
and without even knowing you! they just came to help.
Is there anything that can compare to such a feeling?

Thank you people."
,Gil_Y,2012-03-20T22:56Z,"I had the ISP infrastructures upgraded and we have a small imporvment in seeding - instead of 1mpbs it is seeding at 1.25mpbs (sometimes it even peeks to 1.50mbps), in 3 days more or less i'll be able to complete the upgrade and seed at 2mpbs.

Thanks you all again."
,Xiyiri,2012-03-21T01:16Z,"OMG! thank you soo much Gil_Y!!!!! I've been waiting to play the sims 3 ever since I saw the first trailer back in 2009. I've been searching for THE most up-to-date complete package for weeks now and finally here it is!

I'm still currently downloading it, and i'm gonna seed it for at least 3 weeks or more if it does work :3 C'mon people! Leeching slows it all down, seed so more people can have fun faster! Happy Simming!"
,problemgaming,2012-03-21T08:11Z,"I'm completely willing to seed for 2 months on my 50MB/S upload connection, but I can't get a damn download speed over 10kbps. Stop being greedy leechers, and seeders, please increase your maximum upload slots!"
,Gil_Y,2012-03-21T11:07Z,"I think that the main reason it takes more time than it maybe should,
might be related to a situation when some people come to download and give
up after few hours. usually this will not be a problem with torrents but
when we are in the initial-seeding..
Anyone who leaves is actually leaving with some of the data
which was uniquly uploaded to his machine only, hurting the
overall ""avail."", at the moment I uploaded around 12gb..
However the highest peers have only 12%.
quick math shows that they should have had 22%..
(12gb out of 53.79 = 22%)
But I might be wrong, maybe the initial-seed is sending everything
no less than twice just to reduce the risk for the problem I described.
In any way, to give you all some motivation that it is worth it,
I captured some screen shots of what you about to get when its done.
Here take a look and be confident - that this is what you been looking for :)

psst: if you ask why 16 folders shown but only 12 little sim icons for
expansions in the picture? relax - That's normal!
Some of what we consider as expansions is just items pack content so they
are not being registered as expansions by definition of the game.
It is normal behavior of the game installer.
It is not a plaster result of a crack or workaround or anything like that.
shortly put: if you buy this in retail store it will be exactly the same."
,GazCamp3r,2012-03-21T16:24Z,which languages ​​are included?
,Gil_Y,2012-03-21T20:21Z,"Hey GazCamp3r,

Languages:
Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French
German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian,
Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish

BTW If you want to change the language after you install, this post approves that it is possible:
http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/171100.page

I can see all those languages files residing in the sub-folders after installation.

The language you choose for the installer wizard will cause the game to be installed in that language."
,GazCamp3r,2012-03-21T21:02Z,"the download stoped at 17%, and only uploading with 1-2 mbyte/sec :("
,Gil_Y,2012-03-22T00:34Z,"GazCamp3r - no it's not :)
The torrent is still seeding - and it got to (at this time) 18.5% (in less than 3 days).
So, everything is ok, during the initial seeding period you might see 8kb/s in one moment and 800kb/s in the next moment.
When the torrent is finished the initial seeding - meaning more people got 100% of it - there will be less pauses like you described.

Judging the amount of people in the swarm and the amount of people joining the swarm within each hour - I see all problem gone in less than 15 days."
,GazCamp3r,2012-03-22T03:04Z,"I've uploaded 33,5 gb   :)   "
,GazCamp3r,2012-03-22T20:59Z,"53,5 gb until now..."
,Gil_Y,2012-03-22T23:49Z,"Good job!

Availability is over 30% now.

So many people joined the swarm, that's amazing.
I begin to think that this torrent is going to replace
the other torrents of the sims3.

Anyway I see 680 people in the swarm so to avoid a situation
of 600 times of the same questions when people reach the end
of the download.. I decided to make a quick check and see
what people usually ask in the other torrents.

Q: someone asked about online mode of the game:
""No, you cannot play The Sims 3 with other people online.
The closest thing to ""playing"" with other people is to use other
people's designs for clothing, hair, etc.
That would be awesome if you could play The Sims 3 online with others though.""
Quoted from here:
http://www.gamefly.com/answers/questions/view/36676-is-the-game-multyplayer-can-u-play-with-other-people-online

And I adding to that answer:
The game is a single player game anyway, so no point in trying to register to the sims servers.
even if it would work, you will not gain any advantage by doing that.
If EA/Maxis would have in the future let's say Sim 4 which will be online..
- I'll be paying to play it. (as long as the price is fair! let's say 5$ a month?)

Q: someone asked ""what if I have some of it legally purchased?""
no problem - nobody is perfect, try to see if you can get refund.
and no, don't use your legal copy.
What you download from here was tested as a full collection.
It's a SHAME EA/Maxis have nothing like that offered for sale..
I can't even say try and buy... as you can't buy that.

That's it for now - if people have other related Q/A to add - pls do so."
,TheSacBoss,2012-03-23T00:37Z,"i am new to this,so i need to ask what exactly do u click to download because i clicked the 'download' button and it is not working please help me"
,TheCataclysm,2012-03-23T01:42Z,"@TheSacBoss: Don't click Download. That is an ad and not the download link. Instead click ""Get this torrent"". You will need a bittorrent client (that supports magnet links) first though. "

,xFaimousX,2012-03-24T02:03Z,"Hey GIL_Y I am computer illiterate, i am trying to download this torrent... i am guessing seeding is leavein the torrent in my quene but my dl is going at about 13.2kbs average and my estimated finish time is 14 weeks :D, sorry for being slow and any inconveniance just need a little help i will leave this is my quene though if that helps my internet is set at 15mps so just trying to figure it out"

,GazCamp3r,2012-03-24T02:57Z,"guys, am at 114gb upload now, and after it finished, i will seed until 1 Tb with my 30mbit upload speed  (thats about 3,6mbyte/sec), so all we need is just wait for about 1 week, and ""everythings gonna be alright""

(sorry for my english, never learned)"
,GMarius84,2012-03-24T03:30Z,"I have a 5mbs internet speed, can someone tell me what settings should i have on utorrent? in a way i can help sharing the download and to increase my own download speed? im currently downloading at 15/kbs. THX for this awesome game!"
,Gil_Y,2012-03-24T05:53Z,"Great News,

Initial seeding will be completed in less than 36 hours.

Afterword, speeds will be greatly improved for everyone.

* Most of you are uplodaing more than they download.
* Everything works much better than expected.

That happend becuase you people are awesome!
Thank you.


P.S.
I have no way to choose who is in the main node but I can tell
you that I calculated the speeds and it all working just as it
should expect around 9% delta which is normal."
,GazCamp3r,2012-03-24T10:08Z,"am at 57%, and almost 140 gb uploaded :)

,Gil_Y,2012-03-25T07:48Z,"GazCamp3r - lol, you doing your part too good!
People think I left because they getting seeded to the highest possible % which was seeded. 

Thanks :)"
,Gil_Y,2012-03-25T13:42Z,"More good news:

1. At this moment over 80% is seeded. (hurray!)

2. I hope all will be just fine after you all done downloading.
However, if somthing goes wrong - do not delete the data.
In case of a problem I will find a quick way to remedy without
the need to load everything again. (but no worries - I did tested it)

3. If everything go right - make sure to +1 the quality so others can have fun too :)

4. Keep on seeding.
- the file is already compressed with best compression ratio possible.
So, there is no reason for you to delete it anyway assumnig you'll always want to keep the installation at hand and compressed.

some people just don't get the meaning of torrents! i am stuck at 88.1% and downloading with 10kB/s

download it-> seed -> 

pause seeding only when your mother wants to watch videos on youtube or your little brother wants to play dota. 

after that you shall RESUME seeding!

my point??

SEED!!!!!!!!!"

,kael27,2012-03-26T22:26Z,"Really great torrent! I was able to download sims 3 and the expansions and stuff packs successfully. I don't have the time to play yet, but the game seemed to run fine when I did a quick look. I'm having an issue with the game launcher though, I can't download any of the neighborhoods or Katy Perry stuff because the message ""unable to connect to origin"" keeps popping up. Any idea how to fix this? 

A minute after downloading Hidden Springs (and right before downloading Showtime) somehow the launcher popped up, could this be a reason ?"
,Gil_Y,2012-03-27T09:02Z,"keal27,

The instance you installing should not
be allowed to connect to origin servers.

Everything is already downloaded for you.
(please follow the instructions slowly and to the letter)

Thank you."
,Gil_Y,2012-03-27T09:08Z,"GazCamp3r,

you can delete all the installation folder tree after you installed.
..it will take an hour in case you need to extract it again :)

Regarding to ""why the installed game is smaller than the installation?""
it has files that support variety of windows OS's.. I think Mac as well..
it got Eula's which only shown during installation..

It is normal.. :)"
,kael27,2012-03-27T18:41Z,"Yeah, the instructions are completely clear and I did them exactly, but I uninstalled everything and tried again. Now the game launcher won't even open and now the game freezes as I try to open a neighborhood and closes. I'm clueless as to what I'm doing wrong though i'm kind of a noob. 

I'm running this on a macbook pro btw through parallel desktop's window xp. Maybe that's the issue somehow."
,Gil_Y,2012-03-27T19:41Z,"Keal27,

seriously... Macbook?? with parllel desktop of windows XP...
to run a game as demanding as this one... this is a very long shot.

take a look here:
http://www.thesims3.com/game/ep1/systemreq

The last line states clearly:
""Please note that this game will not run on PowerPC (G3/G4/G5) based Mac systems (PowerMac).""

I'm not sure if your machine fall into the criteria but it sounds like it..

Anyway - it is not a problem with torrent itself.
if it was I would see like 1000 people cursing me by now :)

You invested few days in downloading it - 
1st thing I would do if I were you is to check it on a proper system.

Cheers :)
Gil"
,kael27,2012-03-27T20:52Z,"Haha yeah it was definitely a long shot. I was going to download a sims 3 torrent for mac when I read that it's easier and smoother to get the sims 3 for pc and run it through parallel. 

I definitely don't have a powermac, but yeah I had checked out the requirements before downloading and the game is supported on my system. After researching more last night though, I found out OS X Lion was causing issues for people and the game (pretty much the exact problems I'm having) sooo EA eventually released some patch to fix that. 

I'm guessing I just need that patch, but running a patch designed for mac through parallel for a windows game on my macbook pro ? That confusion to me means I might as well just try and save money to buy the games lol , but I gave you a +1 anyway cause from what I got to see the game looks awesome and would work perfectly not he right system :)"

The torrent crack was tested for PC / Windows Os.

The isntallation files however..
are the original files as if you buy it in store.

From what I read it should be working for MAC too
as long as the machine hardware profile is supported.

MAC owners - please take a look at this thread:
http://forums.techarena.in/video-games/1314316.htm

I copied the following information from there:

""Hello, you just need to follow the steps below:
•First right click on the Sims 3.
•Then you need to open the package contents.
•And now simply Replace Info.plist.
•Now open the Resources >> transgaming >> c : drive.
•Now go to the Program Files and then open the Electronic Arts.
•Here you will get the The Sims 3 from which you need to open the Game >> bin.
•Now simply replace the TS3.exe file.

To startoff, you need bittorrent or is it okey with Winrar? "
,Devinony,2012-03-28T23:43Z,Thank you for putting this together. I almost have it fully downloaded and once I do I will be seeding it for others. 
,AeonH,2012-03-29T03:48Z,"Come on SEED PEOPLE! I mean come on, I've uploaded twice the amount that I have dowloaded and all because a bunch of assholes are just fucking leeching off everyone else!"
,Xiyiri,2012-03-29T04:28Z,"I am currently uploading nearly 10x the amount i'm downloading (download rate:2kbps - 5kbps... as compared to 200kbps - 500kbps i'm uploading) i've been downloading this ever since it was first put up on the site and I have kept my seeding to max for others. I just wish the leechers would just seed for once, that way this game could be finished in a matter of days, not a matter of weeks."
,Devinony,2012-03-29T05:40Z,I am at 85% and I have turned up the amount I upload. It has slowed me down a lot but from the comments here I can see people are having a hard time. Once I am at 100% I will seed at my maximum rate. If everyone would chip in it would go more a lot faster for everyone.
,Gil_Y,2012-03-29T12:34Z,"Regarding seeding delays,

I see 170+ seeders are uploading.

Some of you perhaps don't know it but upload should not be on 100%...
if you do that you will choke your download.

I suggest the following settings in the bandwidth section:
- Set around 250 total maximum connections.
- maximum 70 peers per torrent.
- Translate those according to your speed: 100% download, 65% upload.
- Number of upload slots: 4 is sufficient. (mark the checkbox for using addtional slots)

After that, download rate should be reflected to around 90% of your connection ability."
,Devinony,2012-03-29T12:57Z,What should I set my maximum upload kbps to?
,Gil_Y,2012-03-29T15:11Z,"Devinony,

That depends on the speed you buy from your ISP.
for every 1mpbs Upload your ISP gives you - you should add 83 kB/s in your maximum upload.
(so if he give you 2mpbs - you put 166 kB/s)
And so on.. 
Just make sure not to confuse upload values with download values."
,Devinony,2012-03-29T19:39Z,I'm at 100% and seeding for everyone at my maximum. Hope that helps! =)

I'd go for trying from the 2nd one but I can't promise anything.

guythomas and speed related issues,
You guys need to read how torrent works but assuming you not going to that i'll exapain breifly:
1. when you 1st join the swarm you have nada to give to others so they will donate you little bit from here and little bit from there... at that point you might see very low speed for and for example 17 years..
2. after that phase however - you are starting to exchange with other people parts of the file, you give somthing to get somthing - please notice that you must give somthing to get  somthing... otherwise you just get more ""donations"", if there are many people donating you can get away with it but in any other case you will be put behind in the queue."

Only had time for about an hour of play testing. No crashes, nothing freaky. The only thing was when making a new sim some of the new fashion stuffs didn't ""load"" the icon picture. But when clicked on it, the fashion was there. Could be, just needed a re-boot or something. Not a big deal for me after all the amazing stuff you get.

Have patience with the download people. Do it right, read the instructions and as long as your computer can handle the full game, I have no idea why you'd have problems. 

Read previous comments too. You may find further instructions, hints and tips.

GY may I say - I think I love you."

,pjosip,2012-05-03T17:17Z,"Hey, Its me again...
I have noticed that downloading everything at once takes allot of time and it is not achieving good downloading speed.
So here is my suggestion

You can split up the content to about 5 Torrents in this way.

1. Sims 3
2. Expansions 
3. Stuff packs
4. neighborhoods
5. Store Content

That way People whom don't wish some of the stuff won't be forced to download, you can download 1 thing at the time witch will be faster and download speeds will be greater. 

+ Downloaders can be sure that all the content is tested and it works with each other.

+I recommend that you leave this torrent as in I hope it will get more seeders.

Thank you for your time.
And I would like that you add me on Skype (if you have it of course)"

also, is it ok to update? I followed the instructions to the T and had no trouble on my computer (except some missing store content), but when I did the same on another computer it keeps wanting to update and then fails. Any ideas?"

So, I uninstalled everything and am extracting again... If it doesn't ask for serial again, then I'm formatting my computer and starting all over again, since the darn thing is hiding somewhere.

I thank you so much for putting this and the download was much faster than I expected! However, I am a beginner at downloading torrents and may I ask you why, after installing everything perfectly and the cracks, why the game won't run?

It tells me ""No disk found! Please insert The Sims 3 Showtime game disk before proceeding!"". I don't know what went wrong during the installation but I did exactly as you said, followed the instructions word by word so I would like only a quick reply to fix the problem.

One of my friend told me about Daemon tools but in the installation you didn't mention any of this so I don't know

I googled some things and someone said to go intoo the the computers registry and delete everything sims related. So if you go to your start menu and type in regedit and got through it all and delete everything sims, and electronic arts related. then install everything again, and it should work. and make sure you don't install the EA manager thing, and the same with origin.

The game works PERFECTLY, I had the sims 3 games installed before but I decided to try yours out instead since it seemed much cleaner, and it turned out amazing. It's so much faster than my old game was - and not to mention I have a whole lot of new stuff now.
The torrent took about 4 days to complete downloading (I kept the laptop on 24/7).
It also took me a really long time to finish downloading (It took 1 to 2 hours to extract one game from WinRAR), but it was so worth it.

To everyone saying their  game doesn't work - make sure you uninstall and delete  everything to do with previously installed games and follow the instructions EXACTLY. I know it may seem like you don't need to apply every single crack - but you do. Just do exactly what it says and it should work just fine.(: And do NOT let your it install EA download manager or Origin.

Once again, thank you so, so very much for your time and effort. I am extremely grateful to you. "

Thanks in advance..."
,SweetResilience,2012-06-21T01:40Z,PLZ SEED!!! I will once it downloads! Been downloading for 24 hours now with 80% done. Much better than a week to download tho!!!
,SweetResilience,2012-06-21T01:47Z,"@kuroibarra- Actually, When you download this game, since the pets is already included and you run the ""CD"" for this game, it will run everything that was downloaded for this link. So actually, when you start the game strictly from downloading it here (you will have YOUR saved games from before and a completely NEW game from here) it will give you a completely new game with no saved game info from before. Now, the reason this is, is because you have downloaded 2 different versions of the sims 3 (whether its just pets or all expansions). One is your pets and sims 3 with your saved games and a completely new the sims 3 with all expansions and a clean slate. If you want your saved games to show up in the sims 3 that you just downloaded with all expansions, you will have to find your saved games in your file in Documents and transfer the info to the same bin in the NEW the sims 3. I haven't finished downloading it yet so I cant tell you just yet. But there is a way to get your saved games onto this file you've downloaded. Sometimes it will crash if the info is a little different but if its from the same games, it should work just fine :) If you start your game and non of the saves are there, just keep moving those saved game files around in the new game folders until your games show up. Use your know how as to where the game would be reading these files from to accurately play the game so you can put those saves in the appropriate bin. Hope I could help, sorry if the explanation was all over the place, I am in a hurry lol srry."
,SweetResilience,2012-06-21T01:50Z,"@kuroibarra- I don't know why its crashing though :( You may not have enough memory/hard drive space? It might also be because you have your pets and other game saved on there and they could be clashing if they are both saved in documents/ea games/the sims 3. The computer could be trying to read both files from both games and are clashing and getting different info so it can't load. If you want to make sure it works, you could always delete your old game or move the file somewhere else where it won't be read by the computer. Say, in your pictures or something."
,SweetResilience,2012-06-22T00:38Z,"ok, I'm running into the same problem: i downloaded followed all instructions i got to the cracking step and i ran into a problem when the instructions say 

""C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3 World AdventuresGameBinTS3W.exe""

,SweetResilience,2012-06-22T01:26Z,"Ok, so i figured out kinda, or at least what I think went wrong. I was searching in my Documents Electronic Arts folder and couldnt find the right bins.. Now, what I think I needed to do was to replace those cracks in the game-bin folder directly from the sims 3 downloads which I had unzipped all the folders into my Pictures folder for easy access. So I have replaced all the ""game-bin"" files with the cracks and then I double click on show time run or show time from my desktop icon and it brings up the game play thing and of course says ""unable to connect to origin"" but I have been reading that this is normal and ok?

go to you computer, local disk (or something like that) then program files, 
there youll have a buch a names, your antivirus you other games and stuff, look for Electronic arts 
then click
then open the folder/bin of what you are cracking.. 
crack it acording to the instructions. (take original files, put crack's in the're place)
after crackin it and putting store content and every thing you want
the last crack (showtime (placed in the sims 3) after its in the game, right click and make a shortcut in desktop
then click the sortcut and play it. 

to avoid this mistake or confusion,
 when you instaling and it says make a desktop icon or sortcut you click yes,
 then you just need to right click it,
 and choose open file location (or something like that)
 and you be in the sims 3 directory then do every thing else acording to the torrents instructions. 
Dont forget to erase it after cracking, and replace the desktop icon with the crack so its easier for you to click and play it, if you dont erase the original the game wont start."

I myself suddenly had that error, and it's difficult to figure out exactly what's going on. I'm still trying a few things.

As far as I can tell, you can do one of two things: You either need to run a Defragmenter on the drive it's installed on, and if that doesn't help, it's most likely from a Windows Update, and you just need to look at a your list of Programs via the Control Panel and remove a ""C++"" (in your case likely one that says version ""8.0.6001.18702"" on the bottom)."

,SD-Ravana,2012-07-02T01:48Z,"My thanks to the creator and uploader of this torrent. This is an absolute godsend, believe me.

A few words of advice to fellow peers: I would suggest you do NOT install the store content, as this destabilizes the game incredibly. Also, be sure to follow the installation instructions to the letter, and while playing, be sure to SAVE OFTEN.

That being said, this is NOT the uploader's or creators' faults. I wholly blame EA for the stability problems with custom content and the random crashes that you are guaranteed to encounter.

Be glad this person uploaded this torrent, it could be worse; you could have PAID for these instabilities! ;)

,BillA1016,2012-08-29T03:08Z,"Thank you so much for this. I got it working well on the Mac. I have a question, and will outline exactly what to do for the Mac.

The question: The individual items (folders 14-16) give me an ""unknown error."" I'm not interested in the store items or Katy Perry, but I do want those neighborhoods. Any advice would be great!

How to get it to work on a Mac:
1. You can't just click the installer and make it go. Go to Go -> Utilities -> Disk Utility -> New Image. Click on Create New Image. Change the size to Custom- 8GB, and make sure the format is CD/DVD (and nothing else). Save it to your desktop.

2. Now, you need to install each one individually. Open up the contents of a folder (starting with The Sims 3, the base one) and copy the contents of the folder (not the folder itself, but just the contents) into the new disk image you just created. From here, click the Mac installer and install the game. Use the registrations in the instructions included in the torrent. 

3. Once you're finished installing the base game, delete all the items on the new disk drive you made, but do NOT eject the drive. Empty the trash, and then drag in the first expansion. Do the same thing to install it and use registration codes in the instructions. Note that I cannot get the individual items (folders 14-16 to work) so I cannot provide support for that.

4. Open up the cracks folder from the torrent. There are 7 crack folders. First, go into Applications. You'll have a folder called The Sims 3. Right click (or control-click) this folder and choose Show Package Contents. The destination for the items is in the instructions (it is the same as Windows). *THE CRACK ITEMS IN FOLDER 7 GO IN THE BASE GAME'S FOLDER, NOT SHOWTIME! DO NOT REPLACE THE ONES IN SHOWTIME!* Do this for all the others as well. 

I hope these directions were clear and helpful! It took me awhile to figure out exactly how to make this work on a Mac, but it's not that hard once you get it down!"
,BillA1016,2012-08-29T18:36Z,"Okay, here's the answer to the question I asked earlier. You need to go to Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 3 > Downloads and drop them in there. On the launch screen, go to the Downloads button and install them. This is how the instructions explain to add all the individual items, but it will also work for the neighborhoods for Mac users!

,BillA1016,2012-09-06T02:29Z,"Just ignore the message about the mod. I get it too (and didn't before I tried to update to Supernatural). 

Which brings me to my next question... do we have any way to upgrade to Supernatural without messing everything up?"
,iButtonz,2012-09-11T23:29Z,does anyone have sims 3 supernatural as yet? and will anyone be getting sims 3 seasons??? 
,ashmex,2012-09-17T23:20Z,"i wish somebody would include EVERYTHING, and make them so you dont have to mount them, just a crack to put into the folder....i feel that is much easier to understand for people. and i wish that they would include instructions on how to install them. a step by step guide with serials included. 

so i guess my question is, will this be upgraded until supernatural...or will you make a new one with all this and everything up to supernatural?"
