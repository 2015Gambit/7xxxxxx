The Sims 3

All The expansions, stuff packs, neighborhoods in one torrent.
I did that because the chaos in the sims3 became impossible.
I even found torrents of sim3 with "TeamViewer" residing in the crack folders..
not to mention all trojan and viruses that swarmming the land!!
So let's unite eh? enough bullshit please.

This one is as clean as it gets and it has it all.
(I downloaded everything, sorted it and cleaned it)
I'll seed it 24/7 with my 1mbps for few days..
soon (in few days) i'll be able to seed in 2mbps 24/7.
But this effort must be combined - so please:
a. don't expect this to be great until next month.
b. seed even if it stucks - the stuck period will be shorter if you all keep seeding.
detailed install/crack instructions are also provided.

The Core Game: The Sims 3 

Expansions:
World Adventures
Ambitions
Late Night
Generations
Pets
showtime
showtime katy perry

Stuff Packs:
High-End Loft Stuff
Fast Lane Stuff
Outdoor Living Stuff
Town Life Stuff
Master Suite Stuff

neighborhoods:
Hidden Springs
Barnacle Bay
Lunar Lakes
riverview
(and few more which are installed by default by the expansions)

All Store Content (which was found until 3/2012)

I tested that it all works with all expansions after installing
according to the instructions.

Those two games are based on sims 3 but are not expansions or addition to the Sims 3,
so they are not part of this torrent:

Medieval
Medieval: pirates and nobles
