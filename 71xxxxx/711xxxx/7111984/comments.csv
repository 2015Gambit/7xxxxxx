,orvil58,2012-03-18T20:59Z,"Why the H can´t i get this down,, it refuses to admit that there is any data available "
,orvil58,2012-03-18T21:01Z,"bit torent say´s there is 80 seeders, but i won´t get hooked up on any of them :("
,orvil58,2012-03-18T21:12Z,"Why the F does this not work for me ? can´t even see my own comment´s ,  :)"
,somebodyelse222,2012-03-18T21:20Z,"Something odd with this torrent - it's not downloading for me, despite allegedly 97 seeders, and also there are supposed to be 4 comments, this being the 5th. Despite that, I can't see anyone else's comments - very strange. Now getting a download from elsewhere, with the same file-size. Most peculiar!"
,orvil58,2012-03-18T21:32Z,"Yup,, something is so FUBAR ,, can´t get anything to load from PB right now ,, 105 seeders and i can´t connect to anyone,,, :("
,AmpolGold,2012-03-18T22:41Z,"Yep, PB problems.

BTW, does ESPN still do Telecasts of F1?  If so, how good and how to get hold of?

Regards."
