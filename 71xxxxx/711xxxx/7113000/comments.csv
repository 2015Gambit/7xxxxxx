Many Thanks ETTV... 
Keep up the good work you are doing many need all these Great TV Shows as AVI's :)  "
,Llwynog,2012-03-19T06:40Z,"Seconded. I finally talked PS3 Media Server into streaming MKVs ('though they skip a bit) but it still refuses to MP4s reliably (they crash and start over every seconds or minutes). AVIs are all that work flawlessly over our wireless network (we're finally getting ethernet cables long enough to reach the living room soon), so I'm highly thankful for these.

My only complaint is that they aren't just the video so I end up having to delete the extra .txt and empty folder later (I use Vuze because it's cross-platform but can't make it ignore extra files and folders I don't need)."
