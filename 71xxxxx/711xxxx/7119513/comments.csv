,Cerebral222,2012-03-24T09:28Z,"@Denly, use what you can from the Supports folder, Directx, Visual C++ etc, then try the game, if it still won't kick over, go to the Appdata-Local-4A Games-Metro 2033 folder and open the user file, scroll down to the bottom then go about 25 lines up and you will see something like:
r_res_hor 1920
r_res_vert 1080
Change this to:
r_res_hor 800
r_res_vert 600
this should do the trick, hope it works."
,krunal.b,2012-03-24T16:29Z,"@celebral222 Thanks for the comment...

Working 100% without any flaw..Now i cant play at 1080p..Splended Image Quality at High Settings (Cant Switch to Very High, FPS Drops below 20)..Rest all set to high including DOF, Tessalation, Advance PhyX, MSAA4 and AF16...Getting 50+ FPS on this Settings..

What Sort of Hardware Config do you have Cerebral222"
,Cerebral222,2012-03-24T18:15Z,"@krunal.b, I don't recommend going too hard with graphics on any game, if you're getting good picture from what you have, that should be ok, to push your cpu and gpu too far, will cause thier early retirement. If you use the settings:
Res-1920x1080 or 1280x1024
Quality- Very High
DirectX- DX10
Anti- AAA
TexFil- AF4x
having a graphics card GT8800 or higher, you should have no great problems with this game."
