TINY LIL MORE of her, like we do Virginia."

O M G ! it's like the photographer (I use the term loosely) told her ""act like you're 13 and trying to be sexy"". So boring. The girl has a kickin bod, why do cheesy ""fashion"" shots like she's trying to get in the Sears catalog? I'm sorry but acting silly while fully clothed is just a waste of time and film..."
