Details:

Canadian in Berlin Mary Velo delivers a killer techno release for Gynoid. The title track is based on tribal drums and a rasping, menacing bassline, but it's the Ground Loop version that really impresses. The drums are more pounding and the interplay with the atmospheric chords lends it a dynamism, while the pounding beats are reminiscent of SP-X's work for Komisch and Time To Express.But Velo isn't concerned solely with slamming rhythms and 'Lines Will Appear' sees her conjure up warm, enveloping chords over spiky percussive shards. On a similar tact is "District 03", where a skipping rhythm provides the basis for a seductive chord sequence.
