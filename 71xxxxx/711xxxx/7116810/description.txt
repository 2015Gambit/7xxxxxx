Copy Protect┬« 1.5.0

Copy Protect is the ultimate copy protection tool for your media files. Copy Protect protects important media documents, training materials, e-learning contents, trade and business documents, company presentations, creative files, project files, etc. against being copied and tampered with. Copy Protect allows protecting all media files including PDFs, Flash Files, MS Office Files, Videos and Images.

Copy Protect gives you the portability of protected files so that you can distribute them without any fear of data being copied illegally. Files protected with Copy Protect can be kept on CDs and DVDs or copied to USB drives and external drive(s). No other copy protection software offers a more comprehensive set of flexible data protection features. Once burned or saved to the destination drive, your files can only be run from that particular drive. If someone tries to play protected files after copying them to another location, these files will not run. This helps you defend against piracy, plagiarism and illegal distribution of your media files

Copy Protect works perfectly on all 32-bit and 64-bit Windows Operating Systems that include Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows 2008 Server, Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Window 2003 Server and it is also compatible on all file systems like FAT, FAT32 and NTFS.
