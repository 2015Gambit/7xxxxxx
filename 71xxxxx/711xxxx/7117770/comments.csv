,cweez,2012-03-21T00:50Z,"The Australia Inside seems to be in German, but then with an English audio track. German speaking drivers and people like Vettel and MSC speak in german with someone else dubbing over them. Non-german speakers speak in English. Any text, such as job descriptions are in German (Adrian Newey - Technikchef Red Bull Racing, for example).

It seems a little weird, but works well enough. Waiting to hear the quality in the actual race now."
,cweez,2012-03-22T13:16Z,"Pre and Post race is taken from Sky Sports F1 HD. The actual race itself is taken from Sky Sports HD in Germany. The first 20 minutes has no english audio track and has some overlap from the pre-race coverage, since its from different countries.
The commentary for the race is from the SS F1 channel, with Brundle and Croft, however it doesn't have the same graphics, so they can be talking about something happening onscreen (Like a map of the track and talking about where the DRS zones are) which you can't see.

Unless you really need to watch in 1080, I would grab the race from another source, though this was the only place that I could find the F1 pre and post-race shows."
