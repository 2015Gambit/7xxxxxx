                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 An investigation into so-called `honour' crimes - people being beaten, taken 
 captive or even murdered by relatives because they are thought to have brought 
 shame upon their families. Jane Corbin's report features interviews with the 
 UK's main prosecutor on such injustices - who says he will not tolerate 
 multicultural sensitivities when it comes to this issue - and a leading 
 campaigner, who accuses her own community leaders of failing to speak out 
 about the issue. There are also interviews with victims who are on the run and 
 in fear of their lives
