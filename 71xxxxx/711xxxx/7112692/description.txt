Varg Veum - At Night All Wolves Are Grey is the tenth Varg Veum film in a series of twelve. And this is the first time Varg Veum goes international. It is about the international arms trade this time. On the outskirts of Bergen an arms factory has an huge explosion. Many are killed, among others, and Varg's old friend.

After the explosion, the intensity of the movie starts to spread. Varg, and his pregnant girlfriend, Karin, are affected immediately by this. Someone breaks into their apartment, and threatens Varg's girlfriend, not only does he threaten her, he also kills the unborn baby by kicking Karin in the stomach. So it's a very personally involved Varg who goes to Budapest in Hungary, with far more than justice in his luggage, he is after revenge!

But not everything goes as planned, Varg gets tortured, the police shots heavily at him with machine guns etc. It just makes me realize how easy Varg think it's going to be while it's a very hard case to solve.

And as always, the actors/actresses acts very good in this film. And of course, the humorous interaction between Varg and police chief Hamre also livens up, as always hehe.

This film could've been right out of proportion. But it's not. The film is full of excitement, explosions, and dramatic action! This Varg Veum film, is the film in the series with most Action, Drama, and Excitement. You will be sitting on the edge of your seat through out the whole film, and when the film is over, you just want to go back and see it again.
