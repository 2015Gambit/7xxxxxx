The debut full-length album from Austin-based electronica artist Sleep Γê₧ Over.  This record is akin to a journey through the darkest regions of space, as beautifully abstract layers of sound, intricate synthesizers, and heart-wrenching female vocals meld together in perfect harmony.  Sleep Γê₧ Over is very much left of center but fans of experimental electro pop will certainly find much to enjoy.  Whether it be the the transcendent synthpop of "Romantic Streams" or the lo-fi bedroom sex pop of "Stickers," the entire album is like the soundtrack to your dreams.  The otherworldly grandeur known as "Outer Limits" is included as a bonus track.
