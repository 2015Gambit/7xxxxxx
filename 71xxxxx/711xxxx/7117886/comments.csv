,orihimekunn,2012-04-21T18:42Z,I'm surprised with all the downloads there are no comments. When I finish DL I will post my review.
,orihimekunn,2012-04-21T20:11Z,"Well, when I click 'Get the Torrent', the 'Add New Torrent' window comes up as it always does but this time there are no files listed... and it says Size: 0 B. The only thing under Contents is the file name. Odd."

Wonderfully flawless, 10 / 10.
Thanks so much WORD7BBC!"

I mean it's a great quality rip, and the DL was hella fast, but you have to use some kind of proxy client or DL on someone else's internet unless you want to get in some deep shit!"
