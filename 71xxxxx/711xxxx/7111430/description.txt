iTunes Review:
With Roger CreagerΓÇÖs sixth studio album, the troubadour of Texas twang shows no signs of slowing down. He champions loudness in the opening ΓÇ£Turn It UpΓÇ¥ by singing about blasting Waylon Jennings in his truck, cranking the volume on his guitar amps, and embracing the rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ roll adage that if itΓÇÖs too loud, youΓÇÖre too old. ΓÇ£Something to Believe InΓÇ¥ works in more pedal steel and vintage organ tones as Creager croons longingly for something worthy of belief in a jaded era of misinformation. For anyone who ever loved the drama of Miranda LambertΓÇÖs breakup songs, CreagerΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Dead LoveΓÇ¥ offers a perspective from the side of a guy with a crazy ex-girlfriend (check the blistering-hot Telecaster solo at the tune's end). ΓÇ£If You Really Love MeΓÇ¥ slows down to reveal the manΓÇÖs notable prowess as a tear-in-beer balladeer, before ΓÇ£Bad Friend to a Good ManΓÇ¥ showcases his knack for the kind of narrative that makes so many country songs rich with stories for the American everyman. The heartfelt, honky-tonking title track closes on a more autobiographical note.
