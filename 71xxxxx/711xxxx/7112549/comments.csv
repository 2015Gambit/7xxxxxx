But thanks for the torrent anyways.."
,kmankm1,2012-03-19T12:35Z,Can anybody confirm if this works?
,whtvr2,2012-03-19T13:23Z,"@kmankm1, it works. It is pretty much the same as the previous ""light"" version, except this one has graphics too.

@EbraheemNA, agreed. "
,NunoMMG,2012-03-19T14:31Z,"Thanks alot m8, waiting so long for this.
This has nothing to do with REX guys. 
REX is uncomparable with clouds and sky efects, but is recognized that weather engine has poor performance. I use both and the results are amazing. ASE fog layers are magnificent...
IMO this is definitly the best weather generator for FSX."
,taknbyd,2012-03-19T16:16Z,"@NunoMMG, what clouds do you use in the AS2012? I've been using REX for everything else but the weather engine. Was never sure as what to use for the clouds in AS. "
,jaggy1963,2012-03-19T16:48Z,"I hate rex clouds so i and most of my freinds use F.E.X ""Flight Enviroment xtreme clouds"".Its here in TPB and its been cracked by D Crack F.E.X does water too"

,EbraheemNA,2012-03-19T20:40Z,"Thanks, Request FSDreamTeam Ground Services X Please."
,NunoMMG,2012-03-20T03:21Z,"@taknbyd. I donÂ´t use ASE for cloud generator, As I said before I use REX, for cloud generator, with amazing results, and use ASE as weather engine.
just disable weather engine and someother options in REX options. You can search in google how to configure REX and ASE together , for better results."
,taknbyd,2012-03-20T03:40Z,"I'll second that request, FSDreamTeam Ground Services X Please... Thanks for the up... "
