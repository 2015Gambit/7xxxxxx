This is another conversion to AVI.  It was originally a RAR'ed up 1.10GB MKV file and is now a 411MB AVI.  I have not yet watched it on my 42" LCD TV but the video quality looked pretty damn good when I viewed the first few minutes on my pc.

As with my other submissions recently, my upload speed is not great so do not expect the download the finish in a matter of minutes until more seeders come about.

Thank you and hope you enjoy.
