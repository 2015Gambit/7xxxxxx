Human Racing was released in February 1984. The first of four albums recorded
for MCA Records, it achieved platinum sales and a nomination for Best Album at
the 1985 Brit Awards. Its release was greeted by a combination of teen hysteria,
critical acclaim and praise from the likes of Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton and
prompted Elton John to call Kershaw ''one of the best songwriters of a generation''.
