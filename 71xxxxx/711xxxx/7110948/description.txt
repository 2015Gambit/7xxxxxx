The acclaimed bluesman was headline on July 2 at the Roundhouse in Camden, north London at iTunes Festival 2011
Steven Gene Wold, commonly known as Seasick Steve, the  70 year old bluesman from Oakland California ,  is enjoying to be  finally a hit in Britain with his primitive, delta blues played on homemade guitars.
During the gig of some of the crudest blues to be heard these days where John Paul Jones show up for  jam with him , .Jack White surprised fans by joining Steve on stage to play drums, and as if that weren't enough, Alison Mosshart  also joined in the fun.
Authentic or not, your taste or not, Seasick Steve deserves a listen if you dig the rock...
