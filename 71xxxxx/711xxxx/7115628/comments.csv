,Thumser,2012-03-20T03:34Z,Why it's packed on 1 rar? -.-
,AdamChed,2012-03-20T03:44Z,"Because it's a compressed folder.  I ain't wasting my time dividing it up into pieces to put up on here. Either download the collection here or go find individuals some place else, or you can support the creators and go buy it."
,corroc,2012-03-20T04:36Z,Is anyone seeding this? I see everyone stuck at 12.4%.
,RetchdCat,2012-03-20T11:38Z,"AdamChed - you're no longer seeding this??? bec NO ONE has this one in full. Everyone's only gotten 14.2% and that's as far as we got... so now everyone seeding is only seeding what they got.. hello! 

Would be nice if you could've waited til this was downed fully."
,AdamChed,2012-03-20T18:47Z,"This HAS ben seeded to 5 others, I know because i watched it.  Where I live it will cost me $4 for every GB of data i let ANYONE pull, so once its been seeded to enough people I stop seeding it.  Now, on the other hand, if the people I seeded to are not re-seeding to others, that isn't my problem.  I will not be getting a bill for 300 dollars to supply 300 people with comic books."

,AdamChed,2012-03-22T09:36Z,"ain't gonna happen bro..^^ you people can stop trying to pull it, it doesn't exist because i killed it."
