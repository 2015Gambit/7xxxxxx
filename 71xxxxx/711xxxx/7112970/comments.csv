,tommyhawkster,2012-03-25T20:07Z,I wish all the movies on the pirate bay were ripped at this same MiB to quality ratio.  They would all be around 300 MiB instead of the average 700-1400 range.  
,Muttley1989,2012-03-28T14:23Z,"Although eztv do a good job at sourcing these uploads. The real thanks should go to LOL who released this and the reason it's so much smaller is because is x264 instead of the old xvid format.
Just saying...."
,midurix,2012-03-30T12:24Z,"For some reason this is the only video file my Samsung tv won't play properly, I get audio drops every 5-20 second for maybe half a second at a time. So I end up missing out words. Very weird considering that the TV will play absolutely everything else I throw at it and I have owned it for just over a year and nothing else has failed to play absolutely flawlessly. This only happens with this torrent and American Dad also LOL."
