TORRTUX 0.1.1 Beta test
------------------------

Description :
Torrtux is a terminal-based program, written in perl for downloading torrents from The Pirate Bay. 
With it you can get the magnet link of your torrent, copy it in the clipboard and open your torrent manager. All of that from your terminal ! 
It also allows you to get the details of your torrent, the author, the date, the type, the size, etc., just like being on the TPB site !

It retrieves informations in the source code of the TPB page and parses it with regexp and the library html-parser. 

You have to chose your favourite torrent-manager in the config file in ~/.torrtuxrc.

Torrtux is still in beta test, so report all the bugs you find, thanks !
