This is a very small version of Windows XP Professional SP3 x86
updated to October 2011 with security hotfixes. This edition does
not include Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player at all.
Everything is updated. This edition is about as cut down as it can
be and is only intended for gaming and squeezing life out of the oldest
computers, however, many people use this version full time and use all
the same programs and play all the same games as on full XP. Programs
most likely not to work with this edition are gigantic Microsoft apps
like Microsoft Office. Other software that relies on MDAC or the Jet
Database will not work, because  those items are removed. This version
of Windows is less than a quarter of the size of full Windows. An extreme
amount of components are removed, to check exactly what is removed, open
the "Last Session.ini" file here on the ISO: "$OEM$Last Session.ini"
and look under the section "[Components]" to see what is removed. Then
also look under the section "[RemoveFiles]" to see individual files also
removed.

Notes:

- This is the official ISO extracted from the "Windows XP 2003 eXPerience Edition October 2011" created by eXPerience.

- This ISO doesnt include drivers (except the SATA ones) or apps, just the S.O.

- My upload speed is only 20-25kbps so please dont expect fast uploads from me.

- If you need some help with this S.O. join his forum http://retestrak.nl/board/
