Details:

9th March was the worldwide release of Turbulence, the second feature album from Miami Nights 1984 on Rosso Corsa Records. Spanning 12 tracks, Turbulence builds upon the synth-pop charms and synthesizer solos from Miami's first album with more character: orchestra stabs, percussive rushes, slow motion bends and epic interludes distinguish the album. So does the album's more intense moments which promote the Outrun electro sound we have championed for many years. Miami Nights has engineered the album for the replay button. Many of the songs are outright hits. It was hard picking just one for our soundcloud page, but High Beams is the album's penultimate track.
