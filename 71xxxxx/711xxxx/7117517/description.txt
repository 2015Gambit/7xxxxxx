Adams is the worldΓÇÖs most widely used multibody dynamics simulation software. It lets you 
build and test virtual prototypes, realistically simulating on your computer, both visually and 
mathematically, the full-motion behavior of your complex mechanical system designs. 
MSC Adams provides a robust solution engine to solve your mechanical system model. The 
software checks your model and automatically formulates and solves the equations of motion 
for kinematic, static, quasi-static, or dynamic simulations. 
With Adams, you donΓÇÖt have to wait until the computations are complete to begin seeing the 
results of your simulation. You can view animations and plots ΓÇô and continue to refne your 
design ΓÇô even as your simulation is running, saving valuable time. 
For design optimization, you can defne your variables, constraints, and design objectives, then 
have Adams iterate automatically to the design, providing optimal system performance.
