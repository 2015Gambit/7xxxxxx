i'm presuming you're asking about the 720p complete seasons?

there is 1 (one) episode needed to complete s04 then i will release the 720p.

season 5 is already available as 720p just not as on bundle (which i do not plan on releasing one) so you'll have to get each ep separately 

same thing goes with season 6... i'll release the eps in 720p but not a complete season afterward - get the eps as they come available"
