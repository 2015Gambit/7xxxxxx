,sad-sam,2012-03-19T05:43Z,"Finally some action!  Rick shoots Andrea to save her from a more cruel fate with the walkers, but their unborn baby actually claws its way out as a prenatal zombie, which Rick keeps as his own.  Dr Hershel Greene turns out to be immune to the zombie plague, which is revealed as he ends up saving daryl at the last minute by ripping zombies to pieces with his jaws and bare hands."

,CrAcKeZ,2012-03-22T19:14Z,"@snowbirds why is it 1 gb when others were 300ish mb?


Even 1GB for 720p is quite less, 300ish and 720p is not possible except if we are talking for really shitty quality - Usually 720p is about 4-6GB and 1080 is about 8-10GB for good quality on standar H263(e.g. Xvid, DivX, MPEG4 etc).. now with H264(e.g. x264, MPEG4-AVC) these numbers are way less

Source: Ex transcoder/encoder (no sources or time to encoding anything useful :))"

Are you on drugs or something? Matroska(mkv) is generations ahead of the old avi(microsoft's) format, eztv did the right move to jump to a free matroska container, it took him/her while but made the right move."
,Keeky,2012-03-25T04:01Z,"To the dude that wrote a HUGE SPOILER IN THE FIRST COMMENT. 

DUDE, do not do that. Comments aren't for that. Talk about quality, give thanks but for the love of all things that are good, DO NOT GIVE OUT SPOILER WITHOUT A FREAKING SPOILER ALERT. 

Anyway, thanks to IMMERSE that rules ass and lets me and my boyfriend watch Walking dead in 720p.  "
