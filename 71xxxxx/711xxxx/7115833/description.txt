Right, another R5 from BiDA

Audio is, unfortunately, CAM AUDiO, but better that than no audio. As i checked it`s fully in sync. Don`t ask me about the resolution and aspect ratio, that movie is probably in 4:3 in Russia [lol]. In lot o f places i cut out eng cam audio and put track from russian dvd instead. There are lot of scenes, especially in 2nd half, when you won`t hear any voice - she just runs.. walks.. runs.. some music... So i figured it would be nice to have better audio in those places.
