* SYNOPSIS :


Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles is essentially a remake of Rondo of Blood with 3D graphics, but it still retains the 2D gameplay mechanics (2.5D graphics) of the original. The game includes the original TurboGrafx 16 version of Rondo of Blood as well as a port of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.[1] While being based on the original PS version of the game, this port features Maria as a boss and playable character (after beating the game once), a new script, new voice acting and changed sound effects.

Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles represents the first time that Castlevania: Rondo of Blood has been officially released outside of Japan.
