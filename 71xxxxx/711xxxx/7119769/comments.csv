[V],globeplus,2012-03-21T11:41Z,"Hi and this is the file report :

It is not kidding that i started with a cso image with close 800 mb but after a closer look on the iso detected that more games systems was included on the iso and really probably that none of them was possible to play only maybe the PSP emulators for other games systems but no special point on that , still the same game with small differences that can be played in other games systems , so leave on the iso only the PSP it was what maked sense because this is a PSP game file ... after a little correct work on the audio with the available movies not touched and after the 7zip compression the final size of the game file for download dropped at this amazing somehow 90 mb ... 

Happy PSP version to all of you for this game ..."
