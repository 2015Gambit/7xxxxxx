Megafactories: Ford F-150
It's over ten tons of chrome and steel packing 605 horsepower and a 200-ton towing capacity making it the most powerful truck on the road today. The Ford F150 is built inside one of the company's most modern production facilities-the Dearborn Truck Plant in Michigan. The facility has three main buildings: the body shop, the paint shop, and the final assembly line. The plant is built from the ground up to maximize efficiency and a new F150 rolls off the assembly line every minute. It is a remarkable feat since the Dearborn Truck Plant manufactures ten of the eleven F150 models. The eleven different models of the truck can be ordered in over 500,000 different combinations of cabs, beds, engines and colours etc.
