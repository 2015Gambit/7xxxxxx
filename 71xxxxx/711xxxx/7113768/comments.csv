,dest1234,2012-03-20T06:59Z,"This App does NOT work on ICS, exactly the same problem as every other version of Navigon, takes approximately 10-15 seconds and then it says the Navigon has been stopped. So don't download if you're running ICS just because the uploader wrote that it works in ICS, IT DOES NOT!!!!"
,EO2M,2012-03-20T12:19Z,"I belive you, cuz i dont have ICS actualy but some people said that worked for them, it works fine on HTC HD2 rom ICS, but im not sure cuz i use 2.3.6 so,But if u wanna with evrope maps go to RatnikBelgrade it works, 100% chacked, just point RatnikBelgrade on tpb search ;)."
,dmoss74,2012-03-20T18:17Z,"as someone mentioned in the other version, make sure you start this a couple times with data on first. after that, it will start without a data connection. or has so far with my atrix 4g. "
,dmoss74,2012-03-21T00:42Z,"actually, you do need a data connection to launch this. after you get your destination, you can shut it off and just run it on gps, but not all the time. "
