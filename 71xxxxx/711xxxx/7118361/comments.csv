This thing was so easy to install and works great. You did a nice job on the user interface and adding the music. Everything worked as you said, even the serial # worked. Thanks... you rock!
FYI... everyone else, if it looks like it's not ""extracting"" the files when you click on the exe. file, just wait, it will work."
,tfort00,2012-04-03T23:34Z,I downloaded the free 30 day trial directly from adobe. Should I uninstall that 1 before I install this 1?
,khannies3,2012-04-04T16:34Z,"@Bakura:
Thanks friend! i like the ppl like you who appreciate others work. :)

@tfort00: Dont need to uninstall the previous but if you uninstall it would be much better :)


Regards."

Note: After Installation ... Open Adobe Acrobat Pro X and Click The Last Tab Called ""Help"" and then Click Check For Updates. After few Minutes, Install Update will appear then Click It, Now if Adobe ID form apears then Click Skip, Incase You Didnt Click Skip Then The Crack Wont Work :)""

It works, but for some unknown reason I had to download and install this:

Updates seems to work too."

,ESPN2011,2012-06-06T01:56Z,"I was never given an option to ""skip the step where it asks for an adobe ID"". I installed updates as directed, and it just went straight into telling me to restart my computer. Now every time I launch it asks for a serial number, and all provided with the download dont work obv."
,khannies3,2012-06-07T01:29Z,"hi friends:: thanks for you seeding till now and thanks for your nice comments/
coming to the point cause many friend wrote emails about the problem that dear friend @ESPN2011 .. has mentioned 
this is okay by all means my dear but the problem is that you have already adobe acrobat in your system i mean the old one so untill you delet it from add remove programme and as well as from drive c inculding it's host files so the problem will be remain same as you said 
you didnt nothing wrong but you have adobe acrobat aleady installed in your system 
so that's the reason and i gave the solution 
take care and thanks once again to all guys my good friends who are here with me apperciating my efforts thanks and may God bless you

You are definitely the man! And I kid you not!
Awesome installation! Wooo!

Btw, I'd like to make a humble request, please.
Do you have anything on Visual Paradigm?
I have searched high and low but came up with nothing.

Many thanks!

I think I downloaded it successfully, but there are two things that bother me.

1. Please explain why a lot of failore messages like these appeared after checking for updates:

I hope you didn't harm my computer.

2. At the very beginning, I got a message from my antivirus program that some files of it were blocked. Did your instalation code restored the antivirus settings after installing Adobe?

Тhank you for your responce in advance!

,hakuna.matata,2012-08-07T19:05Z,"Sorry for multiple comments.

Can you see the image of ""Access violation"" that I linked?"
,khannies3,2012-08-21T01:01Z,"@hakuna.matata:: no dear it will not harm your pc anyways so don't think of that .the reason behind your antiviurs is that ''every company like adobe .teamviwer.nod 32 antivirus or many other leading company pay money to antivirus compines . so antivirus companies will never give you benifit as such cause you are paying just 20$ or 40$ for one year to antivirus company and these companies are paying big money so obviously they will care to them and so if it is crack inside so your antiviurs is active casue it's in their database already 
take care
