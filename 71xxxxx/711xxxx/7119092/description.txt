The debut full-length album from Long Island-based indie pop quintet Twin Sister.  Fans of numerous musical genres will find much to like here as "In Heaven" contains a hodgepodge of pop, disco, and alternative elements that somehow mesh together perfectly.  The yearning pop nuance of songs like "Stop" are counterbalanced by beautifully soaring pieces such as "Luna's Theme." Although the members of Twin Sister are relatively young they prove that they are just as valid as other more-experienced artists in the field.  A slew of Twin Sister's best tracks such as the haunting melody of "Lady Daydream" and the dark electronica of "The Other Side of Your Face" from their previous EPs, as well as a couple of remixes, are included as bonus tracks.
