"Uglier Than a Mud Rail Fence(Bavaria, Germany)"

Teams scour King Ludwig's quarters in the same 
castle that served as the inspiration for 
Sleeping Beauty's castle, and tempers flare 
during one Team's walk through a snowy labyrinth


(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower+
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
