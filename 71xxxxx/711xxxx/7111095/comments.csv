,lemon14,2012-09-15T05:07Z,"Works on Mountain Lion. You need to create a new folder named ""Counterstrike Preferences"" at MacHD/Library/Preferences/ 
Then download the Cs1.6 Master Server

Thanks for the upload."
,lemon14,2012-09-15T05:12Z,"By the way after creating that new folder,that's it.
The master server instruction is different.
Download,right click on the file,show info,scroll down make sure everything is Read Only then replace the same file from..
Contents/Resources/Transgaming/C_drive/Program Files/Counter-Strike/ then scroll down look for the folder named ""Platform"" then Config.
You can find these folders by: Right click on the Cs app,show package contents. That's it. "
