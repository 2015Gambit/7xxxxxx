[T],immagical,2012-03-21T16:45Z,@ mwinamo..   is the subs hardcoded or can i choose not to use them..   thanks..
,silentinquiry,2012-03-21T17:59Z,"What part of ""Best to avoid"" did you miss...... Translation: Dont download and I didnt, smart ass"
,silentinquiry,2012-03-21T18:37Z,"Plus its a bad link and wont download, so therefore I cant and wouldnt download anyways. try uploading in avi format in the future. People are more trusting of avi's. "
,BreakingBadFan,2012-04-04T06:59Z,"come on guys....look at the size of this torrent! There is NO WAY a full length movie would be only 270 MB, that should be a warning right there. Its probably just a trailer or a virus so DONT DOWNLOAD lol"
