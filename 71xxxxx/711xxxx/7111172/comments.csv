,Chiitah,2012-07-05T00:51Z,"Nice.  Funimation got me addicted to these things and then cut off the free Dubbed Episodes at 36 (right in the middle of a story line).  I guess that's a smart way to make money, but I can't afford it and I selfishly want to feel mentally better by watching cool stories like these.  I hate subbed stuff - I don't want to read the screen and miss the action happening, I like the dubbed like this much better.  Thanks so much.
