Softmod your Wii 4.3

So I have created another guide to take your Wii to the next level of entertainment. Why another guide on Soft-modding your Wii?

Answer: Quite Simple. The other guides that I saw were either too complicated or out of date.

This guide will allow your Wii to do the following:

*Backup any original Wii Disc to play off an External Hard Drive
*Play a DVD from your Wii
*Play other media formats off your External Hard Drive like: DivX, Xvid, ect.
*Listen to most audio formats off your Hard Drive
*View pictures from your Wii.
*Watch YouTube videos from your Wii
*Allow you to play Wii games, movies, audio that you download from your Wii
*Much, much more

Have fun and I hope you now can get rid of your DVD player as your Wii can now do everything your DVD player can do, and much more.
