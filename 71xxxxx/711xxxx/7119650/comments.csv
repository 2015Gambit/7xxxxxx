,Dude1217,2012-03-22T15:09Z,"Hate it when people bash the work of others just to post retarded spam about watch it here online...better copy here...guess what, NOBODY CARES. This guy has some of the best copies out there. The online streaming suck worst than anything I have ever seen and yes this may not be a good copy but in case you haven't noticed this movie is still in theaters and has been for less than a month. Quit being picky little bitches and just wait if you wanna whine about every little detail or grow a pair and be a big boy and say Thanks .BONE. for all the hard work I'm too lazy to do so I can get a sneek peek at this movie. Haven't watched this copy yet so I will post a truthful A/V rating myself hopefully later since I watch while it downloads with MPC star. Just please keep in mind I have an expensive and picky big screen TV so I'm a bit critical too because even the best quality kinda looks iffy on my TV"
,casper1690,2012-03-22T15:19Z,where are english subs??? film ok 8 all round shame on english subs for the bits that need them
,Dude1217,2012-03-22T16:09Z,"I watched about 30 minutes while it was downloading and I will rate this movie

A:7
V:6

Audio is awesome and obviously a telesync since it says TS in the file name. Video is OK for a CAM. Best out there so far.

@supermasterzack I don't subscribe to stupid streaming websites that have ""free"" accounts that aren't really free. It's a rip off and the quality isn't as good as this one so you must be blind or full of shit...I'm going with the full of shit one.

@dolancer1
The url you posted doesn't even open in firefox or exist in internet explorer so not even worth trying. Not even gonna touch that one so thats a bunch of crap too.

,theeccentrik,2012-03-22T16:32Z,"@dude1217 if the best quality ( best is clearly bluray ) still looks ' iffy ' then guess what, your tv's a piece of shit!!
TV's are not picky as they will play anything, the owners are a different matter.
I hope there is no reply as 2 soliloquy's are quite enough. lol"
,Luisppk,2012-03-22T19:17Z,"Too much quarrel and spam for a bad movie...
Obviously, not fault of the seeder.
Just wait to a decent dvd or bd rip. I assure all of you this movie can wait 'til hell freezes out."

,theeccentrik,2012-03-23T22:28Z,"@addytzu If someone talks about watching a movie in "" even the best quality "" i don't expect them to be referring to a fucking good cam, at that point he wasn't talking about bone's file.

,ombalomba,2012-03-24T05:06Z,@ theeccentrik oh no a rude guy on the internet thinks he's god almighty cause he can swear........Video is OK for a CAM. Best out there so far........ learn to read before flaming... kid
,Dude1217,2012-03-24T17:05Z,"@theeccentrick 
True Bluray and 3D Bluray is the best right now because I take everything and convert it to 3D Bluray format when a Bluray format comes out. I didn't say my TV was picky about Bluray format dumbass. I said it was picky about anything lower such as these cams moron. Read before you criticize. And also if my TV is shit then why is it one of the most sought after 3D TVs but most people don't buy it because they can't afford it? It has the best reolution, contrast, etc...Best so far anyway but as with any technology in like 3 months it won't be. All I was saying is I don't like people saying an online stream that is a complete rip off that is either the same quality or worse quality is ""better"" is all. 

@wolamute
WTF? That was the lamest insult I have ever heard. Doesn't make any sense so thanks for wasting everyone's time. That's all I'm gonna say.

@Luisppk
Thank you. That was the point I was trying to get across. All the versions of spam and this real version are all not that great when you get right down to it. I thank .BONE. for all his hard work and he did a good job considering what he had to work with but I don't get the point of saying another version is better when it clearly isn't. Thank you for simply stating what I was trying to say. Thats exactly right right that if everyone wants to be picky just wait for a better version. It will be out soon I'm sure. This is a popular movie

You have 2 choices, buy a 3D TV where you spend 2-3x the cost of a normal BD and wear shades to watch it or wait 2/3 years for the 2nd generation glasses free face-tracking tech to go below ÂŁ6.000.
Don't make the same mistake as me and follow the 3d hype as 95% of my 2 grand sony is now used for 2d viewing!!! (my 2 cents :?)"

In VLC, to get subtitles to be above the encoded ones:

And tick the ""Advanced options"" tickbox. Then change the ""Force subtitles position"" value to :

20px

and press ""Save"" and restart the video, open the subtitles, and should be good."
,theeccentrik,2012-03-26T02:11Z,"@Kemalitooo check out the tech websites for reviews on any tv you chose as many voice regret especially on cnet after making such a purchase. Remember many salesman would recommend a donkey if it had buttons on it for the sale so go online for a cheaper deal.
Until you buy any 3D games or bluray the 3D option will be inert.

Finally, consider 3D as an optional extra not the reason for buying as you need a good all round bit of kit for daily use. Check out the tv then the 3d spec not the other way about. You wouldn't buy a stereo and then look for a car to go with it!!

,kook321,2012-03-26T12:47Z,why isn't there a way to mark comments as spam?
,Chivalry1978,2012-03-27T16:26Z,ALL OF YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP...THIS IS NOT A FORUM THIS IS NOT A DEBATE ITS TO LEAVE COMMENTS ON THE TORRENT...Is it good? Is it bad? Could you play it? what language the subs are in? thats what comments are for. Not so some I think im better then all you cause I ass fuck a blue ray format. Get over it and stay on point. And to the Im to good for you all cause most cant afford it. If you can afford all this why are you torrenting? Just curious.
,AnubisFike2,2012-03-27T20:02Z,"I cant se why ppl are picking on Dude1217. He clearly stats that he rates the movie from the point that it is a TS. His outher remarks are opinion basted consernign streaming websites and sorts. So what if he uses wrong words or misspell something i cant spell not even in my language ""Swedish"". So what he cant spell or what not. He was trying to be helpfull and you offend him for it....grow up please"
,mattyspurs76,2012-03-27T20:47Z,"Dude 127.

I totally agree with you. It puts me off with fake spammers giving links on here. I just want honest opinions/reviews. I dont want top notch blueray copys as I can hardly tell the difference with my eyesight and once ive watched a film i delete it anyway.  aslong its its watchable from my Pc via my my Xbox 360/Tv then i dont mind at all."

Works great on 17"" screen. I'd give it 8/8. Clearly worth watching. Would get a bit too blurry on larger screen though.
