,far_kit,2012-03-19T03:53Z,"Thanks so much for this great show,
Audio and Video are perfect for me
maybe would have preferred 16.9 Aspect Ratio but I'm not complaining, thanks again mac.moe"
,Flyinby,2012-03-19T04:01Z,"The video on this lags and skips frames a lot.  It looks like a great concert, and if you have a better video available, would love to see it.  It looks like the computer was maybe having a hard time keeping up with the video ripping.  If you need a better ripper, try Handbrake (free), though it only rips to .mkv or mp4 (but does a good job).

Thanks though; the sound is great on this, I just wish the video kept up with it."
[T],mac.moe,2012-03-19T09:48Z,"Well, you all obviously know a lot more about ripping than I do !!

I appreciate all the advice. I'm just an old novice, trying to give something back for all the downloading that I've done in the past.

I'm downloading ""Handbrake"" now so we'l see if that gives a better result.

I recorded the program in ""HQ"" and I still have it so look out for another upload."
[T],mac.moe,2012-03-19T11:38Z,"I've tried Handbrake, but I can't play the MP4 or MKV formats on my pc, so I can't judge. 
If you want me to upload them anyway, just say. I don't like the program, it is not very user friendly !

I do have another two rippers, Xilisoft and Wondershare. I could also use an XVID codec on Winx.

I need all the advice and help that I can ge!
Email me if you want, macmoe@talktalk.net"
