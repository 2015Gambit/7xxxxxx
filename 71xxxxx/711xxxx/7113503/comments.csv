,katana3991,2012-06-08T17:55Z,i am new at pc can someone tell me how to do so i can play?? 
,jagerross,2012-06-10T18:39Z,"katana 2st you got to download DAEMON Tools lite (look it up and download it) and then once fallout is downloaded , a helpful program is PowerISO because that make the file an iso that will go into any program instead of a rar or zip file. Now you need utorrent for downloading it. you can find that on the internet too. now your set with all three programs. download the file but it will take alot of time bc 1GB = 1024MB = 1024KB and  this is about five. once its downloaded open poweriso and drag it from utorrent to there. there is a button called Mount. Press that. Use the bottom drive listed. that has no memory on it. then once it is mounted find the install program in it and install it. then once installed play it. hope i helped"
