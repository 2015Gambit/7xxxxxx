[V],Iznogoud9,2012-03-20T15:57Z,"Oops! There's a typo in the torrent description - episode 7 is called Jaynestown, not Jaynesdown. The name of the actual file is spelled correctly, though."
,squall14716,2012-04-20T13:22Z,"""Our Mrs. Reynolds"" is supposed to have an audio commentary, which seems to be missing from this. Any chance you can rip the commentary and upload it somewhere?"
[V],Iznogoud9,2012-04-20T18:35Z,"I'd like to help you out, squall, but I can't. I just re-checked the DVD and the episode doesn't have a commentary track. Maybe there's a different version of the series, which has a commentary for 'Our Mrs. Reynolds?'"
,squall14716,2012-04-26T02:14Z,"I misread, that commentary is apparently BluRay only. Sorry for the bother. :)"
