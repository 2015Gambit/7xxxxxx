,Ozdl,2012-03-19T12:20Z,Thanks eztv.  I'm sure you have good reasons for the mp4 format.  (Works fine in my WD Live TV.)
,lattari,2012-03-19T14:46Z,@nater2000 You and everybody else wanting to stick to your precious avi should get an MPC player and an HDMI cable - problem fixed. Cant recommend VLC any more unless you use an older version. As for the good people of DIMENSION I doubt they hear your cries :) I would actually pay to see their reaction to the recent outbursts regarding formats in TV-shows. Can't blame you for trying though.
