,shreddir,2012-03-22T01:52Z,"My 9 year old Pentium4 PC can usually play 720p .mkv video, but not this one. I even turned off ""de-blocking"" in CoreAVC decoding software to reduce CPU load, but it still maxes out 100%.  The Hannibal rip .mkv of the Saturday Qualifying that somebody got from ""TheBox.bz"" plays perfectly.  Maybe this one being AVC not H264 encoded along with a high bitrate is too much for me?"
,Xclibr57,2012-03-22T07:12Z,Dude you are such a legend! Please continue putting these up throughout the year?!
,gosensgo,2012-03-25T09:35Z,"Thanks for the upload, BUT...
Soap opera effect is OVERWHELMING.
Could you please try to rip the broadcasts as they are, and let us decide if we want to turn the 120hz effect?
The whole thing looks like it's in fast forward"
