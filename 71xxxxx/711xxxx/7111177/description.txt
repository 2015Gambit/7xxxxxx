1. Uninstall any other version of Sygic, delete Aura folder and reboot.

2. Install 11.2.6 and select any map to download. Interrupt download after a few kb completed.

3. Check the folder. Aura shows only database.xml file.

4. Copy contents of Aura folder from your PC including the base files (~ 292 mb) into /sdcard/Aura and maps into /sdcard/Aura/maps.

5. Restart application. Start page shows maps to select, select continue without selecting any maps. Program downloads another 130mb and works.

Steps above are required if you get prolonged "loading configuration files" message. If you don't get that message, just copy the base files (Aura folder) to sdcard and maps into /sdcard/aura/maps and you are good to go.

Maps included are 100% for India.
