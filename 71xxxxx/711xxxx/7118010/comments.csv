,anarchist9027,2012-03-21T19:53Z,"Sweet, thanks for uploading. I cant wait to try this out. All the updates rolled into one disc saves alot of time instead if them all having to download them. I'll give a +1 as soon as i can take this iso for a spin."
,Makousen,2012-03-21T20:13Z,"Thank you so much for the torrent. I really hope people stop leeching and start seeding. I will seed this as long as I possibly can. I was looking for something just like this, an AIO version of Windows 7 SP1 that was not pre-activated or anything. This will make my PC repairs/re-installations go so much smoother."
,Makousen,2012-03-21T20:23Z,"Won't download past 33.4%...come on people, don't be thieving slut monkeys."
,adi06,2012-03-22T08:25Z,"I'm downloading this & i'm at 47%. This seems good torrent, & i am seed + leaching at unlimited, Already downloaded 2GB & uploaded 0.5Gb.
it will take me 12 hours more to download @1mb connection 110Kbps. I'll give it a try & post back. TC"
,anarchist9027,2012-03-22T18:24Z,Stuck at 68.1% PLEASE SEED
,BritPirate,2012-03-22T22:33Z,"Come on guys, someone must have this file.
Please seed as this a must have file for many of us."
,adi06,2012-03-23T09:34Z,"89.4% :( Waiting, no seeds PPL Go Go Go FTW
its goes to 0 then 100Kbps sometimes, Hope i'll make it today then Seed all day. Cheers"
,roy2646,2012-03-23T14:07Z,I've finished downloading for more than 13 hours and I will seed as long as I can. For the last 10 minutes there were only two seeders. Thanks again to arizon76 for uploading this.
,anarchist9027,2012-03-23T14:34Z,"Well this torrent is a fucking waste of my time and bandwidth. I installed Pro 64 bit and NOTHING IS UPDTAED TO MARCH. I have not tried to install a 32 bit version yet but I can confirm this is SP 1. Thank God for VMWare. So so far, if you are installing this on a 64 bit computer, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME"
,anarchist9027,2012-03-23T14:58Z,Well the 32 bit part of the torrent is pretty much up to date except 5 updates as of today including IE9. This person needs to fix the 64 bit part because not everyone uses 32 bit systems anymore. PLEASE FIX THE 64 BIT PART OF YOUR ISO
,adi06,2012-03-23T16:23Z,"Lolz, i just Finished & seeding, & thought to see see the seeds status & Lolz 104s/62L.. Now we talking, I'm seeding & wish u all the best, Yet i haven't tried it yet."
,adi06,2012-03-23T16:26Z,"Holly Crap, this Isn;t updated 4 the 64bit, U kidding me, it took me 26 Hours of downloading & what a waste. :( Disappointment.

,adi06,2012-03-23T16:28Z,"Ahh crap, no updates 4 64bit, :( disappointed,  i just waste 26 hours of downloading..

,arizon76,2012-03-24T10:33Z,"Just test x64 Ultimate and it HAS all updates except .NET Framework 4 and all it's updates.
Till today 24.03.2012 it installs only 5 new updates."

,anarchist9027,2012-03-24T16:53Z,Then why when I installed Pro 64 nothing was updated? Im obviously not the only person having the problem. Are you sure you are using the ISO you uploaded and not another?
,anarchist9027,2012-03-24T19:11Z,"How fucking strange is this? Ultimate is all up to dat but the 4 updates as of today but Pro 64 is not updated at all? Take a look at that in VM arizon76. You are right tho, Ultimate 64 is up to date but not Pro 64. Please FIX"
,arizon76,2012-03-24T20:58Z,"You are right, it seems that only Ultimate x64 is updated, I didn't tried other versions.
Since I only merge what I downloaded from maherz I could not make changes.
I am downloading another version, I'll try it and if it is OK, I'll upload it.
Thank you guys for your info and I'm sorry for inconvenience."
,roy2646,2012-03-24T21:46Z,"It is ok, thanks for the other comments from the users because we all know that only the work of Maherz which is the 64bit Ultimate version is the only updated in this iso. But anyway thanks to you arizon76, before I downloaded your work I am using this one updated last June 2011. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6464393/Windows.7.ULTIMATE.SP1.ALL.EDITIONS.32-64.bit-MAFIAA"
,adi06,2012-03-25T09:52Z,"All of the version 32 & 64bit working. thank u so much 4 upload bro, i have seeded alot, now i'm off.
See ya around :)"
,roy2646,2012-03-27T03:24Z,"I put it in a flash drive, successfully installed windows 7 home basic x64, after installation I got 76 updates for windows. This is for your information."
,Rehman5000,2012-04-03T16:22Z,"For W7 Ultimate 32-bit:

Works great, absolutely no issues. But would be awesome if .NET Framework 4 could also be integrated.

Had a little issue with activation, but downloaded a separate activator (""Windows 7 Loader"") and all went well. Good copy, except for the missing activator."
,roy2646,2012-04-27T03:42Z,"For this retail type of OS, this is the exact activator, http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6148526/HAL7600_X86_X64_Windows_7_Activator_v_1_2_carter67"
,roy2646,2012-04-27T03:44Z,"

,rax369,2012-05-06T17:31Z,"Alright it was already clarified that the updates were included only to Ultimate x64. Question...

At least SP1 comes integrated to all versions (ignoring the fact of updates) ???"
