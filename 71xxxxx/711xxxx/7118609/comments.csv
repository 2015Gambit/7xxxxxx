,KarnyX,2012-03-21T05:36Z,Thanks for all the CWKO uploads theburningbush.  I hope to see more of them in the future.  Great job.
,WGibson648,2012-03-22T11:43Z,Thank you for your continuing hard work.  Living in a part of the U.S. where Current TV is NOT on the cable system makes it impossible to view CWKO without your efforts.  Thanks.
