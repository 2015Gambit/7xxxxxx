** COMMENT **
The formerly reliable live-streaming source which I captured, processed, and uploaded to TPB seems to have seen its last days. It was only because of this source that I was able to provide this program in a timely manner, so that it was "news" and not "olds."

Other live-stream sources for CWKO are sporadically available, but they don't have the same quality as the source I'd been using, and, in any case, the capture software I use is incapable of capturing these alternate streams.

There is a regular torrent of CWKO on demonoid, but it is typically posted 12-16 hours or more after the original broadcast. By the time I download, process, and upload from that source, it may be 24+ hours before it shows up here.

In the last couple weeks, a person identified as "anonymous" has been regularly uploading CWKO here. The quality, IMO, of those videos is less than what I have been posting, and they aren't posted as quickly as when I had a good, reliable live-stream source, and the files are larger than what I post. However, anonymous's posts are quick enough, IMO, to meet the threshold of being "news." Therefore, until such time as either (1) a reliable, capture-able, live-stream source is available, or (2) someone posts a good-quality torrent elsewhere (like demonoid) in a time-frame that is not "olds," this will be my last upload of CWKO torrents.
