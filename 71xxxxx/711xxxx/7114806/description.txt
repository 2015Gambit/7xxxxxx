Heres how i got it to work along with galactic adventures.

1) Download and install Spore-RELOADED from ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4375709 )

2) Download and install Spore Galactic Adventures ISO  from ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4980043 )

3) Download and install SPORE - Creepy & Cute [Big-Hair] from ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4521163 )

4) Download Spore: Galactic Adventures v3.0 [MULTI16] No-DVD/Fixed EXE #2 from () and follow directions on text file to crack the game.

5) Download Spore Creature v1.05.0001 Fixed Executable [9.2 MB] from () and follow directions on text file to replace previous crack.

6) Now go to your install directory ( for most of you this will be C:Program Files Electronic ArtsSPORE_EP1SporebinEP1  if it is not then you will need to figure out where you installed the game ) and create a shortcut for "SporeApp" (you can place this shortcut anywhere you like ) and this is the shortcut you will use to launch the game with Spore+Galactic+creepy & cute.

ps) The reason i did not go into more detail on the first three steps is because all those torrents either include a text file with all the directions or info you will need for a succesful install or someone has posted a serial code in an older post.So if you get stuck in the INSTALL phase ( Steps 1-3 ) either browse the iso for a text file with instructions or check older posts for a serial code to get you through the install phase to the cracking phase ( Steps 4-6 ).
