Maybe pollsdavid was hacked."
[V],polisdavid,2012-03-22T00:43Z,"NO puunjab, like all us humans I am flawed, I put the cheetah3d up after cleaning out some undesirable files - then forgot to put the needed file back in, and I stopped seeding this torrent, because I thought that the seeders there would perpetuate it.

I have not been hacked - If you saw my password you'd see why."
