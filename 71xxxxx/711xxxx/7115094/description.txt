  Hill as a true genre-defining experience with the added value of two games.
  Silent Hill 2 follows the sad story of James Sunderland as he woefully 
  enters the sleepy town by a mysterious letter from his deceased wife. 
  Seeking the chance to see her again beckoned by guilt and remorse, he 
  stumbles upon his these fears manifested through unseen evil and ominous 
  characters leading him to the asylum of another world. The fight against 
  the truth that his wife has died, James must escape the lumbering demon Red 
  Pyramid (a.k.a Pyramid Head) along with his mystified fears that have taken 
  the form of living monsters within the haze that is Silent Hill.
  Serving as a sequel to the original Silent Hill game, Silent Hill 3 centers 
  on the forces of the demonic cult that spreads the insanity of the 
  otherworld through Claudia, a cult member attempting to bring Harry Mason's 
  daughter, Heather, into Silent Hill. With a subplot and themes involving 
  the loss of innocence and childhood, a web of intrigue is spun by Claudia 
  with intentions to birth a new god.
