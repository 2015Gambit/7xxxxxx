SuperRam is a program that will allow you to optimally maintain and manage your system's memory. SuperRam makes no modifications to your hardware and all adjustments and settings are done in an easy to use interface that even a child could use. Most 'other' Ram/memory modifiers promise that they work while you notice no difference at all in performance. SuperRam on the other hand has been tried and tested and proven to work.
