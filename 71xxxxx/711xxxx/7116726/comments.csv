,jappie2,2012-03-31T19:58Z,"@ryzy can i use illegal patches with this? i had a other version but after the patches it said i needed disc.. (srry for double post, forgot to talk english :)  )"
,jappie2,2012-03-31T19:59Z,@ryzy can i install patches with this version?
,ryzy,2012-03-31T21:43Z,"@lordkik 
Yes master :)

@jappie2
The version you apply patch doesn't really matter - your patch is just not cracked so if you apply it to any version you will get error.

,Silent.007,2012-04-11T23:00Z,"Wen i Try to Run (CoDWaW) i get this Error ?!

""The Program can`t start because d3dx9_37.dll is missing from computer""

[ Help me Plz ^^ ?!"
,ryzy,2012-04-14T15:43Z,Download and install DirectX 9.0c
,SonGokuSSJ4,2012-04-14T16:37Z,"The game crashes after the ""burn em out"" mission is due to corruption in the movie file ""pel1b_load.bik"", thus, make it impossible to start ""Relentless"" mission.
Though the file is watchable using rad video player, but the game cannot play it. So the solution here is using another bik video file and rename it to ""pel1b_load.bik"".
@ryzy: If you don't mind, please upload pel1b_load.bik else where. It's in main/video folder."
,ryzy,2012-04-15T14:21Z,If you are sure about this file i will upload it but it will take some time. I must first download origal Wav
