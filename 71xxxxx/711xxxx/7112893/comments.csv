Some people have PS3's and big screen televisions and stream through wmp12 in Windows 7 and they are unable to play MKV files."

,ben7530,2012-03-19T13:47Z,"@beerman100

Some people HAD that problem, then they started using PS media server, which sends .mkv files to the PS3 effortlessly. 

@melbcro
C'mon melbcro, be fair and realize that .mkv/x264 is a superior format to Xvid in ALL ways."
,LOLSOPA,2012-03-19T21:10Z,"You guys are fucking idiots. It is a different format get over it, it's not a big deal."
,666ASPEN666,2012-03-19T21:25Z,if people ain't using VLC by now they are Stupid. Give up those damn codec and shit.. It play all vids... even dvd images like ISO IMG files. Get VLC player... ive used it since it came out. ...............Thanx eztv... and  keep it mp4 =)
,JeffRelf,2012-03-20T11:16Z,"I love these smaller, high quality .MP4 files.
Never used VLS, GOM Player works great, plays everything."

,andjw,2012-03-30T01:35Z,VLC isnt that great. GOM player+k-lite codec pack is the best
,Hymie1,2012-04-02T23:44Z,VLC is for noobs and idiots. It's a shit player which can't even handle external codecs and internal ones are total crap. PROs use Media Player Classic.
,Heromist,2012-04-09T07:16Z,"@frumpypanda
-runs in locker room as well!-

,Ba1tuks,2012-05-19T18:42Z,"Actually, Media Player Classic is even better than VLC :-) More options, better video quality, also free ;-) Try it."
