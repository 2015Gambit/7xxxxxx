'we' ? Some people like true HD "
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-18T21:28Z,"@dragonballz:

You are expecting?

A tiny 720p is proper to play only on mini portable devices: smartphones, tablets etc

 A proper Rip 720p has other dimensions !

2hours=aprox. 2Gb depending on what sound stream you put in [AAC, AC3]. 

For a so Tiny one you can use only AAC at a very low bitrate [acceptable for a mini device player with no stereo and not dedicated sound system...but using headphones you'll have an unpleasant surprise !]

Easy ...expectations!

Cheers."

This is EXACTLY the 720p version that I HOPED for. 

Never take a great uploader for granted and expect things from them. "
