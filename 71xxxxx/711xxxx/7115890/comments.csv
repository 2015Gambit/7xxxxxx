[V],psspss,2012-03-20T04:33Z,"i assume title is correct.. got from tvrage.. but no guarantee

avi is not better quality though it has losses over mp4
but its better supported by devices still and less hassle

depends how picky you want to be.. mp4 lovers are the new gen who didnt grow up with rabbit ears and VHS tapes :)"

weather static hits/interference in the first 10min
so if you want perfection you may not like this source :) v=9.5 a=10"
