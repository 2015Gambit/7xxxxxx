,smilingze,2012-03-27T23:38Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, the UPDATE that is a MUST to install F***ed up my XBOX360. now it wont recognize any of my other games , stay away from this torrent, this sucks , the UPDATE is NOT SAFE at all, and No I didnt go online with it , it asked to update I clicked yes , it did it thing , it was about to start and then the unrecognized disc msg start to pop , I tried different games which worked earlier and no luck , this 360 is useless now , download at your own risk guys."
