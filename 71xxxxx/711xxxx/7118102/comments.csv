,twijjit,2012-04-09T08:50Z,"h.264 is killing ""digital tv"". Screenshot posted below from this episode. This glitch is one of many in this file, reproduced on two separate computers, all current codec installed, on Windows Media Player, VLC, and even after uploading it to YouTube (but I guess YouTube doesn't have the correct codec installed either, huh?) h.264 does not work on any mainstream players or devices the way standard DivX does. ""Smaller file, It saves space"" No shit, ya know why? Cuz data is missing from the file! Or I guess all my devices, and all the video players on both my computers just aren't set up for it. And neither is YouTube apparently. The h.264 zealots will say that yes, everything I said is true, that yes, even the h.264 decoder itself doesn't play this video correctly, just to say that their precious h.264 is flawless. Face the truth: Nobody wants to bother with this garbage. The only reason anyone's seeding it is because they haven't watched it yet.

Remember, nobody is forcing you to download our files. It's completely free will."
