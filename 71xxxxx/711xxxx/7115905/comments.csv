[T],Auge,2012-03-22T08:14Z,"I have these:
Antonio Gaudi (Criterion)
Bicycle Thieves (Not Criterion)
Stagecoach (The one I have currently is not Criterion but the Criterion version is on order and will be here late this week along with the bonus DVD)
Rebecca (Not Criterion)
Death of a Cyclist (Criterion)"
,Waikiki2008,2012-03-22T09:02Z,"At your convenience, perhaps we could start out with Death of a Cyclist 1955. Many thanks for your generosity. This is the best collection I have ever seen on this or any other site."
,Waikiki2008,2012-03-22T09:12Z,Death of a Cyclist (Criterion) would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks.
