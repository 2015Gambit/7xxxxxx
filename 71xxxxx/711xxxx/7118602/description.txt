 Undefeated Gia DiMarco faces up against Serena Blair in an brutal featherweight battle.

 Gia is undefeated this season. She's cocky, and comes to the match saying she going to "fuck her opponent sideways."
 
Serena's small, but she's tough as nails. She's kept up her training since her defeat against Audrey Rose last month, and she's hungry to win. 

The match is intense from the start. You can tell Serena's been gaining experience as she puts crushing holds on Gia over and over again. Gia fights back, but Serena keeps getting away from her holds. From the first round, you can tell this is going to be a rout. Serena fingers her, smothers her, sits on her face, and keeps Gia frustrated and vulnerable.
 
In round four, Serena totally dominates Gia, fucking her face, making Gia ride her, and double-teaming her with referee Isis Love. Gia learns she shouldn't be so cocky next time as Serena turns her words against her - look who's getting fucked sideways now!
 
A humiliating and punishing loss for undefeated Gia DiMarco, and a new featherweight talent emerging in Serena Blair...
