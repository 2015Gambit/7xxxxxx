Ubehage's EasyCopy v2 Preview Installer
---------------------------------------

I am making a new version of EasySuite; a collection of small applications (tools) for the nerds. ;)

This is ONLY a preview of EasyCopy v2!
It has the main GUI, with almost everything working perfectly and smooth.
It cannot copy anything, nor save or load any queued jobs.

You really can't use this release for anything - it is only for preview.

Personally, I made it to perform a few tests on different versions of Windows.


Works on:
- Windows Vista 32bit,
- Windows Vista 64bit,
- Windows 7 32bit,
- Windows 7 64bit,
- Window 8 32bit,
- Windows 8 64bit.


The following files will be installed:
%SYSTEM32%powerdll2.dll
%SYSTEM32%EasySuiteDLL.dll
%DESKTOP%EasyCopy2.exe


The powerdll2.dll-file is my own creation. It's a major code-library that I made a few years ago.
You might leave it or delete it. It will never be replaced by a new version, though not many programs use it.

The EasySuiteDLL.dll-file will be replaced by a new version as progress comes along.
