Thank you so very much for these books! 
I've only a few of her's, so am very much looking forward to reading these!!! Thank you!!!

Any chance you might be able to find any books by author Jaci Burton? Friends are asking as they've been unable to get. I don't see any here on TPB.  Thank you :)

Appreciate all the hard work you do!
Best always,
