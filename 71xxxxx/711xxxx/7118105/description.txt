Finally! Better late than never, it's the March, 2012 Indie 69 new music playlist.

Months in the making.

There are great tracks to choose from here.

Remember, these are all artist-submitted, blog approved, or artist/label provided tracks. So not only can you enjoy all the free music, you can do so without worrying
about whether or not it's "legal".

Not that you did. lol

In any case, if you like the sample tracks, consider buying more or buying the albums/eps the tracks are from.

Enjoy and I'll see you again in a couple of weeks for the April playlist.
