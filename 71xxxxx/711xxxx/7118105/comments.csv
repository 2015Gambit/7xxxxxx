,arthurofboro,2012-03-29T00:29Z,Welcome back.....we missed you. Hope all is well.
,indie69,2012-03-29T08:50Z,"@arthurofboro Thank you. I missed making these for you. All is not 100% well, but really when is it ever, right? In other words, I'll survive and I'm optimistic about it all. The April playlist will happen. Maybe even on time. lol Take care and thanks for the kind words."
,indie69,2012-03-29T08:52Z,"@arthurofboro Are you the guy who does Shankley's mixtapes? Or do you just upload them? In any case, thanks. I love those."
,indie69,2012-03-29T08:56Z,@The_Barman Could you possibly seed that one music playlist you uploaded. Seems like a great list of oldies and I'd love to give it a listen.
,arthurofboro,2012-04-06T14:08Z,"indie....I used to do the artwork for a few years for the Shankly mixtapes. Totally independant of Shankly. I just loved the Mixtapes. Then I went away to work for a while and did not get Mixtapes on a regular basis. I'm back now but did not restart the artwork as I figure most people play the stuff on their mp3 players anyway. Plus I have about 2 years of mixtapes from yourself, Shankly, Blallock and others to wade through. What I do is make up compilations each month of the best from all. With being away I am still compiling stuff from a while ago. Last one I did was Nov 2010."
,indie69,2012-04-08T12:12Z,@arthurofboro Oh that's a great idea.
