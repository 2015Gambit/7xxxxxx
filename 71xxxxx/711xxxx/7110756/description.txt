I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.

Devin Townsend 1993-2011 Discography

A MUSIC torrent :)
Dig the eclectic spirit of Devin Townsend
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Townsend

I only knew of Townsend as one of the characters (Rage) in Ayreon's The Human Equation and I was thunderstruck by his energetic voice.
Then, thanks to my SuprBay mate MrLore, I started to dig deeper in his music and I was finally captured.

An eclectic artist with an uncommon irony and an explorer spanning on all the possibilities of metal.
Progressive, extreme, industrial, groove, dark ambient. The progressive part is the most interesting for my tastes but I'm intrigued by the drifts of all his music, so I've tried to include also the side projects and meaningful collaborations he worked in.
This discography covers his main productions from 1993 to 2011 (A new album by the Devin Townsend project is scheduled in 2012). There are 45 album.
All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB). The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible. Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips. Enjoy :)
