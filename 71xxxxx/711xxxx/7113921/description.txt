       The Emmy nominated, Grammy-winning Lewis Black hits the historic  
        State Theatre stage in Minneapolis for a rant-filled, cathartic
        ride through through the issues of our baffling world, from inept
        politicians and the shortcomings of technology to the absurdity of
        social media. No topic is left unexplored in this sold out performance
        by the bestselling author, actor, playwright and The Daily Show contributor.
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
