,schicken,2012-03-18T23:47Z,thanks for the upload... unfortunately it appears to have the same audio issues as the rapidshare download that came out almost a week ago.

,blugoo,2012-04-15T06:17Z,Confirming the major volume changes problems. Don't get this file unless you want to go crazy. Sounds like an amp constantly switching back & forth from PCM to Dolby.
