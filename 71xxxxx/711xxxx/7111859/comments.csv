I was looking for some time for a decent encode of this one, and there were only very large ones (running out of free hdd space), or shitty ones (under 1.000 Kb/s). This one's just the size I wanted (even better after I'll strip the Polish audio - sorry, but the first two words from this comment resume my polish vocabulary :)"

Have a nice watching :)"
