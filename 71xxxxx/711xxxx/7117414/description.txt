Hanna is now in the hospital and remembers who A is. She tells the girls it was Noel Kahn because she saw him write 'I see you' on the back on Ezra's car while Aria and Ezra were kissing. But the girls are starting to question if the person who killed Alison and 'A' are two different people. Meanwhile, Melissa and Ian elope. Also Lucas admits his feelings for Hanna, but is both angry and heartbroken when she tells him she only likes him as a friend, and tells her that she deserves a better boyfriend than Sean. The girls find out that 'A' wrote on Hanna's leg cast which is, "Sorry for losing my temper, my bad," which could have been anyone who entered Hanna's room while she was asleep. Also, Emily finally has enough courage and comes out to her parents; her father accepts it because she's his daughter and he loves her, but her mother has a much harder time accepting it.
