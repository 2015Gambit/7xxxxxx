Enigma is an electronic musical project founded in Germany by Michael Cretu, David Fairstein 
and Frank Peterson in 1990. The Romanian-born Cretu conceived the Enigma project while working 
in Germany, but has based his recording studio A.R.T. Studios in Ibiza, Spain, since the early 
1990s until May 2009, where he has recorded all of Enigma's studio releases to date. Cretu is 
both the composer and the producer of the project. His former wife, pop singer Sandra, often 
provided vocals on Enigma tracks. Jens Gad co-arranged and played guitar on three of the Enigma 
albums. Peter Cornelius also contributed to Enigma during the 1990s.

The Platinum Collection is a 2009 box set by the musical project Enigma. It contains three CDs. 
The first CD contains most popular Enigma tracks from the previous years, the second CD is a 
copy of the first CD except it contains tracks remixes, the third CD contains never released
