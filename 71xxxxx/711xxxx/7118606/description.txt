The award-winning men's vocal ensemble Chanticleer returns to the hypnotic sounds of earlier times with this collection of works in praise of the Virgin. A fascinating variety of approaches to the great Magnificat text is represented here, from 7th century chant through the golden years of the Renaissance polyphonists Palestrina, Taverner, and Josquin, and up through the Baroque composers Monteverdi and Vasily Titov.
