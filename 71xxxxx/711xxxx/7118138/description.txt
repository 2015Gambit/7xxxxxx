Imagine ...
you got a binary file and don't know its contents. Or some software creates binary files where you have a specification but don't want to decode them manually.

Synalyze It! allows you to create a grammar for binary files interactively. Unlike in regular hex editors or viewers the files are interpreted automatically for you!

The grammars are stored as XML files and contain all the structures that may occur in a file of a certain format, just like XML schemas. It's even possible to inherit structures from others (like in OO languages) so you don't have to repeat for example a length field that appears at the beginning of each structure.

Additionally Synalyze It! is a full-featured free Hex Editor allowing you to edit files of any size.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OS X.5 or greater
