,IotIP,2012-03-19T18:39Z,"Anybody know how to get these magnet links to work?  When selected, nothing ever gets started in the newest versions of Vuze and Transmission (they get launched, but nothing gets loaded -- no torrents appear).  ÂľTorrent doesn't even work on my computers, so that's not an option.
I've been to over a dozen forums now, and not a single one of them even address this (either they get the torrent to run, but with no connections, or the options supplied don't even exist -- i.e., there is no ""reset"" button anywhere in my Vuze).
This occurs with Opera, Firefox, and even Safari on a Mac...
If there is even a manual way to do this, it would be appreciated..."

The complete name for the episode"
,FamilyMan82,2012-03-25T23:16Z,Vuze is outddated dont even waste your time trying. Utorrent is the way to go. when u install make sure you select the option to automatically associate utorrent with magnets and torrents. That should do it
