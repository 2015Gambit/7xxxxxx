"Them, Robot"

Mr. Burns replaces all of Springfield Power 
Plant's employees with robots (guest voice 
Brent Spiner) but decide  to keep Homer as 
the sole human worker. With unemployment at 
an all-time high and mechanical arms 
operating the workplace, Springfield 
becomes a dismal and humorless place. But 
when Homer's machine-programmed peers start 
to turn on the community and his former 
real-life employees come to the rescue, 
they all realize that robots can't replace 
human friends.
