.RAR is safer for large files and requires a minimal amount of work to unpack. (For me: a double-click, then a drag to desktop or directory; THAT'S IT!)

Try downloading a 4gb ISO, and having it not work when the D/L is finished, forcing you to download ALL 4gbs again, versus D/L-ing .RARs, getting an error on .r37 during unpack, and having to re-download (ONLY) that single .rar file; much less time & bandwidth needed.

Also, .RARs are much better for usenet releases, etc.

So, a wee bit of extra work, but overall much safer and possibly FAR more convenient if a file gets corrupted...

So, deal with it? "

It's not safer. Torrent includes hashes for the files. Get your fact straight."
