,xidio,2012-03-20T03:22Z,"Players have survived the terrors that took place on Banoi, but did they
really get all the pieces of the puzzle? Dead Island's Ryder White DLC
lets you re-experience the Zombie outbreak, but this time through the eyes
of the villain. Play through Ryder White's story and understand the
motivation behind the acts of this military man.


Lol idiot"
,ram789,2012-03-20T07:18Z,"@xidio lol man i was beginnig to wonder whether this is L.A,Noire or DEAD ISLAND?!?!?!?"
,djdedis,2012-03-20T10:07Z,"Realy, what's new?"
,violet1143,2012-03-20T12:10Z,"Downloading it ATM. And I lol'd at the description, too. Well since RLD's a scene group and they're always rushing for a release, it's likely for them to make some slip-ups. ^_^"
,NoAbove,2012-03-20T17:53Z,"You little kids.. especially the fugly geek that never had a girlfriend who goes by the name ""xidio"".. you're just a ""t"" away in that nick from being spot on.

Sorry you never made a mistake in your life.. that might change by the time you turn 11.

Thanks for the upload scene4all. The size alone says enough about what this torrent really is. Keep it up and never say apologize to these ""know it all"" baby trolls."

[T],Nighted,2012-03-20T23:25Z,Does this require Skidrow's 1.2.2610 update?
,roztok,2012-03-21T00:48Z,"I have a last update from Skidrow but after installing this one there's an error: ""Failed to load library fmod_event.dll"""
,roztok,2012-03-21T20:33Z,"NVM, it works!"
,beermotoraxe,2012-03-24T19:44Z,This update refuses to install on Skidrow version of L.A. Noire. I got an error message at the end of the install that said something about 64-bit registry keys? I'm on 32-bit Win7.
,WckGod,2012-04-13T16:31Z,"I keep getting the same error : ""Failed to load library : fmod_event.dll"" Someone help please"
,reguard,2012-04-20T20:43Z,"I could not download ypatcher.exe. My uTorrent client said that access was denied. All the rest was downloaded successfully. How can I get only that file?

P.S: My antivirus is bitdefender 2012 and I tried to deactivate it while dowloading but it still denied.

Thanks in advance."

Found this online, if you get the error “setup cannot acess 64 bit keys…..etc”

Windows 64-bit users:

1. Install L.A. Noire (The Complete Edition)-SKiDROW

2. Install v1.3.2613 Update-RELOADED (make sure to choose the correct install path) then copy Crack + DLC Addon into the game’s main folder.

Windows 32-bit users (tested method):

1. Install L.A. Noire (The Complete Edition)-SKiDROW

2. Install v1.3.2613 Update-RELOADED to a temporary folder or anything other than the game’s main directory (for example I used C:tempL.A. Noire)

Don’t press OK when the message “Internal error: Cannot access 64-bit registry keys on this version of Windows” appears (if you press OK it will automatically delete the patch’s folder). Go to where you installed the patch and copy all the files there yourself to the game’s main directory. After this you can press OK and it will delete the temporary folder.

3. Go into the folder named “3rd” and run Social Club Setup (you need this new version of Social Club)

4. Copy Crack + DLC Addon into the game’s main folder."
,Agandaur,2012-08-18T13:28Z,"So just this one update is enough to install on clean SKIDROW version, i don't need to install previous updates?"
