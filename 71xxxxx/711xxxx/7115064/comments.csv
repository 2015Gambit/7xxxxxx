a 720p rip is 1280 wide and not 720"
,auntystatic,2012-03-20T03:11Z,and the uncut version is on way longer than 1hr 43min
,Cleric21,2012-04-03T16:13Z,I'm not getting any sound from this. :|
,Cleric21,2012-04-03T18:29Z,"Cancel that, was a hardware problem. The download is two ~100 min videos, it's the full uncut like it says. Comes with multiple language subtitles, not dubbing."
,ihaai27,2012-04-12T09:44Z,"Great film
Good quality
Pity it is French language though - the German would have added to the atmosphere
Good subtitles choices though"
,Tstart,2012-07-16T06:31Z,"if itÂ´s two 100 min videos then itÂ´s the Directors Cut

Runtime: 149 min  | 209 min (director's cut)  | 293 min (uncut version)"
,village1diot,2012-07-19T14:23Z,"This is not two 100min videos, it's a single mkv video file with external subs. I don't know what Cleric21 downloaded, but it wasn't this."
