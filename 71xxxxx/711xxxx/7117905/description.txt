Everyone has something to hide ΓÇô whether it be a secret romance, who they really are and what their true intentions are. For Mr. Fitz, he's hiding an old romance with a girl he met in college, Jackie Molina, whom he had been engaged to but never married, which makes Aria suspicious and Hanna aids her in creating a fake account and friending her to find out more about her. Paige gets hurt when Emily cancels a date with her to the Founders Festival; Emily is tired of being Paige's secret. Emily finds a storage key, the one Jenna has been looking for, in a snowglobe Ali gave her after she admitted Emily was the "only person she could be completely honest with". Caleb comes to the Marins' home to drop off a letter for Hanna and let Ashley know that he is leaving Rosewood to go to Arizona for good, but when Ashley suggests he deliver the letter to Hanna at the festival in person, Mona has her own way with the letter. Spencer finds out some more information about Ian, Melissa, and Alison at Hilton Head while preparing for the festival; and a meet with Toby at the festival at night goes wrong when someone traps Spencer in a scary funhouse. However, Ian rescues her, but when they start to leave, Spencer runs up to Toby and they lock each other in a loving embrace and kiss, to which Spencer's family sees this. Garrett confronts Ezra (after seeing Aria leave his place) and sees the props Aria and Ezra used for a couple photo (out of a fit of jealousy about Jackie and Ezra's old couple photo in Italy.) The girls visit the storage room, where they see Ali's old lunchbox with a flash drive in it. They realize that someone has been recording a video of and watching Alison, Aria, Emily, Spencer, and Hanna all this time and wonder who could have been spying on them.
