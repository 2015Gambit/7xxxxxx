:: PLOT :: One day prior, Farhad (Shaun Toub), a Persian shop owner, and his daughter, Dorri (Bahar Soomekh), argue with each other in front of a gun store owner as Farhad tries to buy a revolver. The shop keeper grows impatient and orders an infuriated Farhad outside while making a racist comment. Dorri defiantly finishes the gun purchase, which she had opposed. The purchase entitles the buyer to one box of ammunition. She randomly selects a red box.In another part of town, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), the local district attorney, and his wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock), are carjacked as they are about to enter their Lincoln Navigator, by Anthony (Chris "Ludacris" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate). Later, at the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz (Michael Peña) is changing their locks when he overhears Jean freaking out about having been carjacked earlier by two black men and now having to endure a heavily tatted Hispanic with a shaved head changing their locks, because she is sure he is going to leave and give copies of the new keys to "his other gang members."
