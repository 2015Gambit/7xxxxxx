Davy and his pal Georgie Russell (Buddy Ebsen) team up with a crooked but lovable gambler named Thimblerig (Hans Conried) and head off to Texas, there to join the Army in its battle for independence against Mexican general Santa Ana. Effectively assuming command of the Alamo from an incapacitated Jim Bowie (Kenneth Tobey), Davy realizes he is fighting a lost cause, but manages to rally the remaining troops for one last courageous stand against the Mexicans.
