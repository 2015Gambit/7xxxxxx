This comment is to talk about the work on this PSP game quality rip , i started about a week ago making deep research about the PSP emulation on the PC and more research i did , more i was pleased with the great capacity of the PSP emultaion on the PC by the JpCsp emulator getting a nice positive emulation percentage for PSP comercial games and with real nice playability in most of them , then during this week of research of course the possible ripping work was always in mind like i can do for the PC games or WII and after long and borring somehow research i finally get after tests and more tests the perfect ripping for PMF video and AT3 audio that are common types of video and audio on the PSP and the most surpeendent thing on this research work was found out that was possible real quality in audio and video after the ripping work having the correct sense of quality balance on the videos and the audio , basically for this game after all the necessary work , 460 mb was removed from the iso total with exactly the same quality , comparing the original iso with 1.48 Gb and this quality rip iso with 1.02 Gb , the player didn´t notice a thing and the final size is less 460 mb on the iso , absolutly nothing removed , just pure quality work ... the final size of the iso is 411 mb because the good 7zip compression for the Data folder of the game , it was for me an astonishing week full of research and admiration for everything relationated with the PSP emulation on the PC and of course the folders main console funcionality  and all the tools and hacking that it is possible ... simply wonderfull and i really wish a pleasant happy gameplay to all of you playing this game , in my conscience the work done is real irrepreensible in every aspect ...

See all of you around and enjoy ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-18T21:09Z,"In order to have the emulator working perfectly beside the configuration gived on the description don´t forget to download and install if not done yet the support programs for the JpCsp emulator for audio and video , the freeware Sonic Stage for the audio and the Xuggler for the video and of course have the latest Java installed on the computer ...

Happy game for all of you ..."

[V],globeplus,2012-03-18T21:37Z,"Vita it is only starting and maybe in sometime can be emulated with sucess too but playing with the keybord of course , i don´t really believe that with the finger you can play on the emulator but my friendly user will still coming new nice PSP games and you can find many really nice games already avaialble and with a good percentage of them with nice playability on the emulator , like it says the generic phrase ; the show must go on and certainly that for the PSP console that it will be what happen independtly of the new possible choice for the handeld console addicts , it is all about gaming after all ... thank you for your comment ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-18T22:17Z,"Hi and download and unzip my JpCsp STARTER.exe , a perfect executable to launch the emulator without the console window , don´t remove the bat  , just put this worked executable on the emulator folder and run the emulator from this executable and it will be just the emulator going in a nice way ...

 The other great GOD of WAR game for the PSP now ripped with quality like this one (Chains Of Olympus) , now available for 445 mb :

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7113596/[PSP]_GOD_OF_WAR_-_CHAINS_OF_OLYMPUS_GLOBE"
[V],globeplus,2012-03-19T10:47Z,"About God Of War Chains Of Olympus work in sequence of the work on this one :

Another GLOBE quality rip for the PSP with the other GOD OF WAR game worked after getting the iso with less 460 mb for Ghost Of Sparta , now dropped from 1.49 Gb the original iso to after the work keeping everything and with the same quality for 826 mb what means 664 mb less for exactly the same game with nothing removed and the same quality , what means that in this 2 God of War PSP games 1.12 Gb less in the hard disk space for the same games and i gived the isos in 7zip , with an PSP iso converter probably the cso conversion can give even less size for this games ...

On this game beside getted more size removed i get after the compression more 34 mb than for Ghost Of Sparta , the reason is that the Data files gived a some less compression than for the other game but no big deal anyway ... the result like i said is more than 1.1 Gb less on the hard disk space in only 2 games and with everything looking absolutly normal , my work on the PSP will keep going on this next days at least with the best PSP games beeing ripped with quality if it is possible the work of course , i hope the users getb this opportunity to get them intact for a nice size because that it is the spirit that i make n the work for myself and any less hard disk space getted with nice work is always welcome ... 

See all of you and happy games to all of you ."
