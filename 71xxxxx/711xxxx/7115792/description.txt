"I Didn't Mean to Turn You On" is from Riptide, the ninth solo album by the British singer Robert Palmer, released in November 1985. It featured his hit single "Addicted to Love" which reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1986,[2] helped by a memorable music video. Palmer won a Grammy Award for the song in 1987.

The album also featured Palmer's Power Station bandmates Andy Taylor and Tony Thompson providing guitar and drum services respectively. Power Station producer Bernard Edwards (from Chic) played bass and produced the album as well.

This song "I Didn't Mean to Turn You On", originally performed by R&B singer Cherrelle, was again covered in 2001 by Mariah Carey for her movie Glitter.

Robert Allen Palmer (19 January 1949 ΓÇô 26 September 2003), born in Batley, Yorkshire, was a Grammy Award-winning English singer-songwriter. He was known for his distinctive voice and the eclectic mix of musical styles on his albums, combining soul, jazz, rock, pop, reggae and blues. He found success both in his solo career and in the musical act Power Station, and had Top 10 songs in both the US and the UK.

His iconic music videos by Terence Donovan for the hits "Simply Irresistible" and "Addicted to Love" featured identically dressed dancing women with pale faces, dark eye makeup and bright red lipstick, which resembled the women in the art of Patrick Nagel, an artist popular in the 1980s. Sharp-suited, his involvement in the music industry commenced in the 1960s, covered five decades and included a spell with Vinegar Joe.
