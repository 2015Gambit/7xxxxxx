Sleep Cycles has been updated to v2.

A bug when the "warning to sleep" alarm was set. The value of a the 24 hour 12am was not being set to 0. This has been corrected.
Implemented save settings for times, checkboxes, warning to sleep time, etc. Settings are reloaded each time you open Sleep Cycles.
Implemented a time picker for the "warning to sleep" alarm. This allows you to set your own warning time.
