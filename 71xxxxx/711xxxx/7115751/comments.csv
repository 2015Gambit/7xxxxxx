But i have a question :

if i want to play ONLY single player campaign i need to download these 4 files :

Revival Mod Version 1.5b.1.rar	
Revival Launcher (old).zip	
Revival.1.5b1launcher.rar
chest fix.mod.zip.zip

But i dont need the huge file :

Mulitplayer Patch.rar 

Right ?"

No, you need it all. The reason being, what happened was essentially the company released a patch and didnt support the single player with it, so online you could access new bosses and stuff, but single player you couldnt. This transfers all that extra conten to single player."
