"Careful What U Wish 4" 
(Windows Media Audio/Video File)

As the school gets ready for the dance-a-thon, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer have more on their minds than raising money for the school trip to Washington, D.C. Hanna and her mother are having a financial crisis, but when 'A' leaves her an offer that would potentially break Lucas's heart but get her out of money troubles, will she be able to refuse? Emily can only think of Maya and is desperate to speak to her -- so much so that she enlists the help of Caleb, the new bad boy in the school. And as an important piece of property goes missing, Spencer finds being in close quarters with her new brother-in-law, Ian, more difficult than ever. Meanwhile, Aria's former babysitter, Simone (Alona Tal), comes back to town for a surprise visit. But what should be a happy reunion quickly becomes a nightmare for Aria when Simone sets her sights on Ezra. At the end of the episode, Ella is seen giving a a coat and leather gloves to a 'mystery person.' The gloves are the same ones 'A' used to send the tape of Alison.
