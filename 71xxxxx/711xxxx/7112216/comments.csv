,babybluetits24,2012-05-01T16:00Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1643222/  imdb 6.1 horr/scifi/thrill  The sun has become brighter, the earth, hotter and drier. What life remains must hide in shadow and scavenge for survival.
Four travellers, in search for running water in the mountains, run into an ambush, where the younger of two sisters is captured. This post apocalyptic parable deals with the standard issues of trust, leadership, honour, hope, and of course survival.   ok so we need english subs !
