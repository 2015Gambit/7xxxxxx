,Dr_Maxwell,2012-03-18T23:58Z,"Thanks for upping this Nepotu, I jus watched the first of the double header against the pacers. Seems like the new coach has got the Knicks gelling together once again, hopefully they keep the momentum going through to the playoffs.

Keep up the good work Nepotu! Thanks"
