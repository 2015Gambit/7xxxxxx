Based on the official track listing released today I've brought together both FLAC lossless files and high bitrate MP3s for this torrent.

This is a high quality torrent and I made sure each track is in the highest quality; I looked around to find lossless formats when possible and settled for 320kbps MP3s if not. For a very small number of songs (less than two) they may be the slightly longer releases rather than the shorter radio edits included in the final Now 81 release (maybe this is a good thing!). I'm super OCD when it comes to tagging so I consulted Wikipedia entires to get everything perfect. Where possible I've included information on sources in the comments of each file (for some songs without source information [like Paradise and Marry the Night] they were already in my collection ripped from 100% lossless sources so there is no release information).

This is formatted best for iTunes (if you don't use iTunes I'm certain you can convert the Apple Lossless files to FLAC or any format you want with the help of The Google).

If you love this CD please support the artists and purchase the final product. I spent time on this but it's nowhere near the talent, effort and time taken to record even one of these tracks.

Happy St. Patrick's Day everyone (if you're not drunk yet please drink more :) )!"
