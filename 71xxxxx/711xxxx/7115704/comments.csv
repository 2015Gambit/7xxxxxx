However, I shall update if it is legit upon completion."
,Sundaybacon,2012-03-20T13:17Z,"@Obzen999 

Sorry, this is the first time i actually uploaded a torrent. "
,SwedeBast,2012-03-20T13:30Z,"I'm cautious... As soon as I added this torrent, I got tons of connection requests from blocked IP addresses. For all of us Meshuggah fans, it's better to just wait for the release and rip it ourselves. Hell, I've already preordered from iTunes, so I don't even have to do that. :-)"
,Obzen999,2012-03-20T18:26Z,"Update: Left it all day and it has apparently been super slow. Also, I'm reading DL of about 50MB, yet the % is still at zero...Something is wrong here.

I may just have to wait to hear it...All I wanted was an early listen before I decide to buy it :("
,Obzen999,2012-03-20T18:27Z,Could you perhaps rapidshare the files?
,takeaimnfire,2012-03-20T18:36Z,"Yea, not working.  No one seeding.  All psyched for nothing... :("
,RoWaNsKiJ,2012-03-21T09:36Z,Oh lord its a fucking messy leech orgy
,cgas21979,2012-03-22T04:04Z,Anonymous has one up that works!
,hororcore,2012-03-25T16:10Z,I want the dvd
,3mpir3,2012-03-27T01:17Z,BUY IT! The poster and DVD are Badass!
,serious_joker,2012-08-11T05:01Z,"Files downloaded just fine.  They are correctly titled, and add to iTunes well.

Included ""album art"" is just a picture of someone's case and disc, so you'll have to go get the album art somewhere else.  Otherwise, that is the only extra work.

Thanks, Sundaybacon."
