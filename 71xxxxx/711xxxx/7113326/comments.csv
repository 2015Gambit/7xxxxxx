,pinaloca,2012-03-19T08:00Z,Thank you so much for this :)
,laybac101,2012-03-19T09:52Z,"@logan-x-art    You are a real piece of shit.  You have not added one thing yet you have commented on a few torrents and you have nothing new to say.  It is allways the same bullshit out of you.  If you dont have the storage or bandwidth then get a job or move on.  Don't bring down the ones that actually do some work and make great torrents.         With that said, Thank you DibyaTPB I have enjoyed many of your torrents.  Keep up the great work.  "
,dragon070772,2012-03-19T14:10Z,does anyone know where i can get hold of the Finale show that aired after episode 13 ?
,Rix-kun,2012-03-19T18:49Z,@logan-x-art you're saying this is garbage? you're the one who is garbage! because you still want old stuff like what you have said. 17.93GiB in 13 episodes having 720p resolution is a great deal to spend time to download. Go throw yourself!
