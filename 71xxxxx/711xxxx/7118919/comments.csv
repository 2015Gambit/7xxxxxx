,bakayaroka,2012-05-09T23:18Z,"Great game works great on Galaxy Nexus, although is not completely full screen. I am not able to access the hidden areas like the Soul of Chaos and Labyrinth of time even though i have already beaten all 4 fiends. Anyone able to do this?"
,jdeal13,2012-05-25T15:12Z,Not sure if this is happening to anyone else but I can't find a single seeder. Only game I'm having a problem with. Downloading with: atorrent on thunderbolt
,jdeal13,2012-05-25T15:14Z,Disregard last message as soon as I became a registered user it worked fine. Strange only game that's done that.
,catworst,2012-06-29T09:35Z,"I get an error about 'parsing the package', any ideas?"
,Hypnos76,2012-07-05T18:48Z,Works Flawless on ASUS Transformer Tablet with ICS as OS.
,yuri0yuri,2012-08-08T17:37Z,"Is there a way to change the screen size configs of this? In my Samsung Galaxy Y (320x240), it renders the image out of the screen, making it impossible to go past the character selection"
,AnonSVN,2012-09-08T02:36Z,"The only problem with this is that Square Enix didn't bother allowing upscaling on this. Some devices will get a border around it since I guess it is made for the GNex only. 

If you don't want this problem, get a GBA Emulator or PSX Emulator and get FF1 on it.

But if this doesn't have border issues for your phone, go ahead and download it."
