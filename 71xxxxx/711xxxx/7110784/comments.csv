Thank you for the upload!!!

But i'm not finish downloading and this yet is to be tested.  Can you upload a portable Autocad R14?  This probably is the fastest and smallest (only 83.24mb compressed) 

I found it here (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3806343/AutoCAD_14_with_serial) and i've tested it good and virus free.  I like this becoz it can accommodate chunky Autolisp programs without affecting its speed. Plus lots of customizable features.

Thank you."
