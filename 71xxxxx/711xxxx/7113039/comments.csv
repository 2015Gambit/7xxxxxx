,PnZombie,2012-03-20T05:26Z,"Thanks, VTV!
And, seriously people, don't pay attention to the ""spoilers"". Most of the time it's just people being buttfaces who want to get people riled up."

,spoilerboy247,2012-03-20T12:10Z,"Great season finale. Killing off the lead character Rick was a total surprise. The farm is gone and no more Rick who is now a zombie. 

@CRCNO1

You'll get what you're given you ungrateful fuck. You're not paying for it fuckstick."
,akuera,2012-03-20T12:44Z,"@spoilerboy247

You selfish, ignorant juvenile little cunt. Why would you write the ending here for people to see? t is people like you that are contributing to the de-evolution and destruction of the world.

But in a way, i feel really sorry for you. Your life must be so cold and empty, that you have to go onto the internet and hide from the safety of your room. Just to try and get reactions out of people. I don't mind giving you a reaction. Very happy to.

It's this kind of behaviour that has caused all of your relationships to fail in the past.

Please help yourself and those around you by taking up a constructive hobby. Working on your issues and inputting positively into the world around you."
,perttiman,2012-03-20T13:24Z,Fucking nice to tell the plot in comments ffs -.-
,ltcomm2,2012-03-20T13:30Z,Rick didnt die...

,moony1220,2012-03-20T23:31Z,you guys all got trolled good. rick IS NOT dead.
,joanmcbitch,2012-03-21T08:03Z,lmfao 'Rick' sounds like 'Shane' which sounds like 'Carl' which sounds like 'Andrea' apparently.
,G2BG,2012-03-21T13:21Z,"The barn gets overrun, they all get out except Jimmy and that redneck chick, stupid ending shows Rick telling everyone he killed Shane and then they show a prison which is obviously where they'll be heading for shelter come next season. Oh and by the way, after I downloaded, I didn't and won't seed. Fck you all, I just download and take my shit and leave!!! :)"
,weed1puffin,2012-03-21T14:16Z,"I get one day off a week and was lookin forward to watchin this. You cunts ruined it cos your lives are so pathetic that this sort of thing amuses you.

These comments are for the quality of the torrent

so fuck off to IMDB and spunk yourself with excitement when you leave your spoilers

pricks"
,sahilrox,2012-03-21T16:57Z,"This series is the worst affected by spoilers.....
People Shouldnt read comments before watching the episodes!!!!"

^this guy is lying.
I've seen the episode and rick did not die or turn into a zombie."
,Chookers,2012-03-23T12:00Z,This was pretty chookers to watch
,666ASPEN666,2012-03-23T15:20Z,"I don't read comments here, for obvious reasons!. It's obvious what need to be done here Pirate-Bay need to CLOSE DOWN THE COMMENT SECTION FOR GOOD! and add a ""Thanx Button"" instead. It's not going to work with all these ""lowlifes!, with no Life"" Spoiling the TV-series/movies for folks here. "
,Warlocks-TwiN,2012-03-24T00:41Z,"Guys, chill...
spoilerboy is just a troll, he didnt spoil anything.
he's just retarded."
,antreasg9,2012-03-25T01:00Z,i belive the best way is a facebook login for leaving a comment so in that way stupid ppl will be exposed 
,AznAssassin,2012-03-26T11:45Z,"@spoilerboy247 Go fck urself cuntface. Spoiling for ppl who r about to download it is so low. 

btw Rick doesn't die u fckwit. You're obviously a fcking dipshit who haven't read the comics and have no fcking idea about the series.

Why dont u go outside, find a job, get a girl + grow up instead of hiding in ur fcking basement, masterbating to hentai and trolling on torrent sites. 
YOU'RE PATHETIC"

,Stock3rz,2012-04-20T15:03Z,how about so that it is harder to find spoilers just type spam over and over in many comments. it sounds stupid but I dont wanna see spoilers just as much as you
,aapb,2012-04-25T21:17Z,"wow this season was so fucking boring thank FUCK for torrents. I hope the next season is better, FFS."
,JulesCow,2012-05-18T00:34Z,"Watch out guys, I got an email from my ISP for copyright infringement! That said, I watched a new episode through the-walking-dead.bazinga.li (HD stream, you just need to register).
