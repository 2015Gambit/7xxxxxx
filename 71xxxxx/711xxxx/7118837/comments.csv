,mOral87,2012-03-21T02:32Z,"now the question is, will this update work without 5 and 6 ?"
,EffinNub,2012-03-21T02:34Z,Is this 1.5? Thanks for the update if it is!
,Tyki,2012-03-21T02:51Z,Woot! Cant wait to try new killmoves and cams out!
,Derc,2012-03-21T03:07Z,Thank you! Perfect! +1 =)
,Cheppo,2012-03-21T03:08Z,"Killcam works but not great.
it shows cams of death but never when you want it to."
,Manish9889,2012-03-21T03:37Z,help!! do i need all previous versions ? o.O
,Karlston,2012-03-21T03:48Z,"Thanks. Grabbed a .torrent file from another site that isn't obsessed with magnet links.

Updates are cumulative, no need to install earlier ones."
,Manish9889,2012-03-21T03:48Z,help!!! do i need all previous versions ?
,Manish9889,2012-03-21T03:50Z,@Karlston thanks for info!! :)
,SteXmaN,2012-03-21T04:03Z,"@mOral87 yes,it will work without any of previus updates bc its included in this one

@Cheppo  its suposed to be like that,it would be stupid to end every kill with kill cam :P"
,dabears23,2012-03-21T04:15Z,"Downloaded, installed and seemds to work great, but.... I haven't been able to have any kill cams with the bow. I tried sneaking, normal kills, and everything. Even tried using the  set killmoverandom to 100 console command.

Strange. Is it because I originally downloaded the Razor 1911 version?

Any help or comments of experiences would be appreciated."
,dabears23,2012-03-21T04:59Z,"BTW, seeding at 600 kbs. :)"
,ggx,2012-03-21T05:05Z,"thanks! 

@dabears23 are you using normal bows or conjured bows? I use conjured bows and it works, with razor1911."

,Grizz99,2012-03-21T09:29Z,"After applying this update, the Creation Kit crashes at startup. I had no problems using the Creation Kit before applying this update. Anyone else having the same issue?"
,GObonzo,2012-03-21T10:33Z,"good to see if you upload enough garbage files like sonuyos they do block your bullshit eventually. sure extremezone'll get a kick.

,bangerang,2012-03-21T14:59Z,"After installing this update many of my creature names are no longer in english even though the language files that come with it indicate they're for the english version, and the language in skyrim.ini is set to english."
,Husain.87,2012-03-21T15:08Z,do i need the previous updates?

,ForPanda,2012-03-22T00:53Z,"I'm having a language problem too, after patching some of the items are showing up in a non-english language. Is it the update or is it something else?"
,Xphen,2012-03-22T02:52Z,Creation Kit is crashing can you do something about it please?
,NTRobby,2012-03-22T04:01Z,Ditto on the Creation Kit Problem.

,akuorekelate,2012-03-22T09:52Z,nvm it still working but broken at some place
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-03-22T14:07Z,"@OneFourOne

Why was he banned?"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-03-22T15:20Z,Crashed to desktop... great. If reverting to the old patch I was using doesn't I've got to reinstall the whole game +  mods and restart the whole game from scratch.. wtf.
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-03-22T15:22Z,doesn't work *
,JohnHolmesII,2012-03-22T19:21Z,"FOR CREATION KIT PROBLEMS:
Do not use the steam_api.dll found in this torrent.

Instead, use the one from a creation kit torrent."
,arnippur,2012-03-22T23:51Z,"Got the same problem as AdrenaLiNv2, crash to desktop when i try to load a save, with SKSE or Launcher got the same result, lucky for me i went back to update 5 and all is back to normal now, too bad this update dont work for me..."
,Xphen,2012-03-23T01:57Z,"Creation Kit works, just make sure you people close Steam, it crashes it for some reason."
,EvilCorporateWhore,2012-03-23T03:20Z,"If you guys are crashing to desktop when loading previous save after install this update, it's because of your MODs.

Uninstall them all, then install them again. If you don't use Nexus Mod Manager, or another Mod Managing tool and install all your mods manually by overwriting files, then you're an idiot.

Using NMM it's as easy as one click to uninstall, and click again to reinstall. Pretty simple. Hope it works for anyone having that issue."
,Pizon,2012-03-23T06:53Z,"This update actally doubled my performance,especially in cities!! Thank youuuuu :)"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-03-23T22:52Z,"@arnippur

Same here, successfully installed the 1.4 patch again (newer patch is not compatible with SkyBoost yet) and thank god all works well now."
,arnippur,2012-03-24T01:35Z,"wow uninstalling and reinstalling the mods i have on NMM worked for me, didnt have all the mods on NMM but worked anyways, at least its not crashing when loading, still checking if its stable but works for now..."
,Kounchry,2012-03-24T06:40Z,"Having a problem with this update...

I downloaded it, copied the files into my Skyim folder, replaced the files, and I noticed in the read me it says version 1.1. I tried using my mods with the NMM but they didn't work. Anyone else having this problem? Isn't this patch 1.5? Whats up with this?"
,jacksparroww010,2012-03-24T10:42Z,why is my loading time terrible ...after i patch 1.5 stuck in skyrim startup menu not actually hanging or CTD i can see the smokes moving like for 6 - 9 mins and plays fine very smooth but loading is excruciatingly Slow ....plays great on 1.4 before
,[SIC],2012-03-24T13:52Z,"Try loading different saves, it worked for me if ""continue"" only CTD."
,JohnHolmesII,2012-03-24T22:12Z,"@EvilCorporateWhore
It's easy to speak about that which you do not understand, and to insult those whom you disparage. Do not assume you know the answers to everyone's problems.

Especially since you're wrong here.

1.5.24 has problems with parsing the Skyrim.ini file. Some options will not work. the best thing to do for extended load times, loading until ctd, chaotic papyrus responses, odd AI behaviour, and others would be to (bear with me here) go to Documents->My games->Skyrim and delete the Skyrim.ini and SkyrimPrefs.ini."
,JohnHolmesII,2012-03-24T22:13Z,*And then run the game.
,viserious,2012-03-25T10:01Z,"I posted the steps to fix the 1.5 crashing, please read and follow the steps.

,blizzard_beast,2012-03-25T17:00Z,"Hey this worked really good!
I've even seen improvement in FPS , for example I would get ONLY around 45 in Whiterun (most places) and after the update it went up to like 70 FPS! And that goes for almost every place in the game.I am very glad I've installed this and very grateful to scene4all for uploading this patch.People don't be afraid!"
,maxod,2012-03-25T18:56Z,Does this support 4gb large address aware?  I checked in task manager and it's only showing like 1.7ish GB of memory used.
,crimson00100,2012-03-26T00:03Z,"-downloaded it (pretty fast).
-backed up save file.
-copy pasted everything in the torrent folder onto the original game folder.
-ran the game and worked pretty great

thanks for uploading"
,la_volpe,2012-03-26T08:57Z,"first let me put this out there for all you lovely pirates fearing game restart if reverting to previous updates..........your a complete moron.......the game cannot delete the save directory, your mods will always be there, your save games too, the game deletes ONLY the basic game data (any original data)  i cannot say that you wont have to reinstall some mods (thats fine) any mods you install or have installed that change the original skyrim data may/may not need to be reinstalled, ALSO anyone with CK problems.......seriously uhm....how many of you are actual true modders? and how many of you are just adding your own retextures? i mean come on....but on another note if you are serious about getting down with MODS......get the CK torrent, install this update, open ck if it dosnt work re copy the CK Data :) any questions? email me at atlassilvertounge@gmail.com
simply put i can point you to almost any kind of mod you might want, also im not to unfriendly and dont mind finding out problems to your own personal mods in the works, and will help anyone with problems on updates...oh well you get the point"
,saeimon,2012-03-26T11:49Z,Works fine except for underwater. Cannot see a damn shit. The screen just goes greenish. Any suggestions?
,Skycatcher,2012-03-26T18:38Z,"@saeimon goto  http://skyrim.nexusmods.com and search for "" Clear Water "" its a mod which makes the water clear...update works great, running 76 mods atm with enb -- no issues "
,Pink_Taco,2012-03-27T04:54Z,this is making my game worse than ever! now especially outside i keep seeing shadows of random images in my screen like a huge cup a face of what looks like a wolf and toe brightness keeps changing drastically every step.
,grotux,2012-03-27T05:40Z,"I HAVE A PROBLEM! Ok so i downloaded it, along with the iso thing. What do i do next? Im a noob!"
,saeimon,2012-03-27T12:14Z,@Skycatcher cheers buddy. Hope it works.
,DR490NB0RN,2012-03-27T18:56Z,"Wow the performance has increased SO MUCH! I haven't played this game since December so I don't know which update improved the performance.

I used to get 60fps outside towns, Whiterun would give me low 20's as did other towns. Now I did this update, felt like playing Skyrim again and Whiterun was running at 50-60fps, lowest dip was in the low 40's."
,grezgorz,2012-03-29T18:16Z,"This is version 1.5.24.0 of TESV.exe
Is there a release for the 1.5.26.0 update? I guess it would be called Update 8"
,eluttag,2012-03-29T22:08Z,"I have a problem with my Xbox 360 control on the PC: 

Some of the the buttons stops working when installing the updates. I have read that this is a common problem when remapping the bottom layout and there are a fix to it but it includes making changes in the Steam folder. As you might understand, since I'm posting it here, I play a downloaded version and it's not connected to Steam. 

Do anyone know how to fix this problem? It is addressed in the updates change logs but the problems are still remaining..."
,Nerevine84,2012-03-29T22:51Z,The game now runs smoothly!!! Thank you!!!
,tourizmo,2012-04-03T05:52Z,"this update stops iron daggers glitch.
on previous versions you can fast level-up smithing by crafting iron daggers but with this, smithing is slow."
,DerpyPaws,2012-04-11T21:42Z,"Thanks for the upload, looks and runs great so far!...with one minor problem, wonder if anyone else has had this happen. During the quest Laid To Rest, which I started on the updated game, the cave where the master vampire hides in was bugged. Upon entry I'm greeted with a turquoise blue opaque graphics glitch. I walk thru that and all the wooden walkways I remember from my first play through are gone, as well as another portal of blue hell I saw below. Upon meeting the first enemy in the caves, the floor turmed into, you guessed it, another blue glitch. She fell right through it, as did I. I'll be uninstalling all my mods and reinstalling the game, and if that works, then I'll begin seeding. Any additional advice is appreciated. Derp out."
,General_me,2012-04-13T12:42Z,"what kind of directory name is <install>, i have the reloaded version of the game but i dont have this directory?"

,BeanHunt,2012-06-18T05:07Z,"I know i'm probably doing something wrong but mine isn't working. I've never updated the game before and I can't figure it out by the instructions. I think they're fairly vague, no offense. I got the game from JohnHolmesII. please help! And when i try to use the TESV.exe it gives me an error message titled ""TESV.exe - System Error"" Then it says ""The program can't start because binkw32.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program."" "
,BeanHunt,2012-06-18T06:29Z,Also I dont know how to reinstall if that would even work
