Details:

Outlands is the culmination of Deep Sea Arcade's musical education - a dark, absorbing and adventurous album which spans various musical influences. This album honors the experimental and dystopian sci-fi films of the 60s, and like any good movie this album takes the listener on a (12-track) journey. This works, because the album has no holes, it flows effortlessly.
