The Dark Tide 

From the New York Times bestselling author of The Blue Zone comes this second mesmerizing thriller about a woman who must unravel the secrets from her dead husbandΓÇÖs past. 

An explosion rips through New York CityΓÇÖs Grand Central Station one morning, destroying the train Karen FriedmanΓÇÖs husband, a successful hedge fund manager, is riding in to work. Days later, with dozens of bodies still unidentifiable, Karen resigns herself to the awful truth: her husband of eighteen years is dead.

On the same day, a suspicious hit-and-run accident leaves a young man dead in KarenΓÇÖs hometown of Greenwich, Connecticut. Ty Hauck, the head of the local detectives there, reminded of a tragic moment from his own dark past, finds a clue that shockingly connects the two seemingly unrelated events.

Months later, two men show up at KarenΓÇÖs home digging into CharlesΓÇÖ business dealings. Hundreds of millions of dollars are missing--and the trail points squarely to Charles. With doubt suddenly cast on everything she has ever known, Karen, with Hauck, steps into a widening storm of hedge fund losses, international scams and murder. And, as the investigations inevitably converge, these two strangers, touched by tragedy, are pulled into an ever-deepening relationship and open the door to a deadly world of cover-upΓÇöand conspiracy.

With its breakneck pacing, plentiful twists, compelling characters, and abundant heart, The Dark Tide confirms Andrew GrossΓÇÖ place as a master storyteller at the top of his game.
