Quality rip with nothing removed and this is the patched version that looks that have some additional package or something , the work was tested and it is entirely corrected in what was possible and for this game was only possible 200 mb exactly less on the iso , the original had 1.59 Gb , after the work i getted 1.39 Gb but with an acceptable nice compression that maked the 7zip got only 592 mb ... about the game , of course this a new Final Fantasy game that certainly donÂ´t disappoint the fans from the series exclusive for the Playstation ...

Happy game to all of you and i have the clean conscience that i am uploading one more nice PSP game with the correct possible work ... see all of you around ."
