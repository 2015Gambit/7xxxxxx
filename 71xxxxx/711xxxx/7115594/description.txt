DJ Playero is a Puerto Rican producer of reggaeton artists and albums. He is considered to be one of the pioneers of the genre on the island. In the early 90s,[1] most of his underground productions were distributed and sold in housing projects and among fans. Most of those are considered pinnacles of the genre and launched the careers of lots of reggaeton artists.
With the surge of reggaeton in the late 90s, his productions became more stylized and mainstream. He reissued some of his earlier underground productions and several compilations of hits. In 2003, a DVD titled Playero: Su Trayectoria was released.
