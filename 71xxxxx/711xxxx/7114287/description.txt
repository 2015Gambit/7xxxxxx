This American Life, episode #454, "Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory"

Originally broadcast on January 6, 2012, episode #454 of This American Life - "Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory" - features an adaptation of Mike Daisey's one-man stage show "The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs", about the working conditions in a Chinese factory that manufactures Apple products.

According to Public Radio International (PRI), which distributes the show, the episode "was the most popular podcast in This American Life's history, with nearly 900,000 podcast downloads and more than 200,000 live streams."

On March 16, 2012 This American Life issued a complete "retraction" of episode #454 after it emerged that it contained numerous fabrications. They devoted their March 16, 2012 episode - #460, "Retraction" - to an examination of the errors in the original episode, including an interview with Daisey in which they confronted him about his fabrications.

Instead of relying on their "Retraction" episode to correct the record, or appending corrections to their original episode, This American Life chose to delete the original broadcast in its entirety. They deleted the downloadable mp3 file of the episode from their website, deleted it from their streaming service, and deleted it from iTunes. According to PRI, they also intended to delete it from their Amazon store. However, as of March 18, 2012, the episode was still available for purchase at Amazon for 99 cents. No word on whether the episode will be included in their 2012 greatest hits CD.
