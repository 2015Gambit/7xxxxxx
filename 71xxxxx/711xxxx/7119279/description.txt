This is all my music I have uploaded into iTunes, enjoy. Most of them have cover pictures, proper spelling and grammar, and a good bit rate (most around 320 kbps). 
Just as a sneak peak, there are artists including Ani DiFranco, Black Sabbath, Cocteau Twins, Cradle of Filth, The Doors, Fiona Apple, The Gathering and many many more different styles and types of music.
