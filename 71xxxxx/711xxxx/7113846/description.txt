FAIRFAX, VA... OverClocked ReMix today released its 33rd arrangement album, Mega Man X: Maverick Rising. It features sixty-two tracks from forty-nine artists. Directed by Wesley ΓÇ£BahamutΓÇ¥ Cho with assistant directors Wes ΓÇ£EmunatorΓÇ¥ McDonald and Stevo ΓÇ£Level 99ΓÇ¥ Bortz, Maverick Rising is available for free download at http://maverick.ocremix.org.

Maverick Rising features 4 ┬╜ hours of music from a variety of genres with a hard rock and metal focus, and now ranks as OC ReMixΓÇÖs largest arrangement project to date. It is a MASSIVE tribute to the music of the core Mega Man X series, spanning nine games released on the Super Nintendo, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable. Maverick Rising is not affiliated or endorsed by Capcom; all original compositions are copyright their respective owners.

ΓÇ£This album is meant to be a massive collaborative effort from members of the video game music arrangement community at large. I started this with the goal of covering the music of what appears to be a generally sparsely covered set of popular games, and to bring exposure to quality artists that many may not be aware of. I also wanted to see artists grow with their music,ΓÇ¥ explained director Wesley Cho. ΓÇ£I am proud of what these musicians have accomplished on this album, and immensely thankful for all of those involved. I hope the album is just as enjoyable for the listeners as it was for those who worked on the music, artwork, video trailers, and website.ΓÇ¥

Forty-nine artists collaborated on musical tributes to the entire core series, including:
Mega Man X (SNES)
Mega Man X2 (SNES)
Mega Man X3 (SNES)
Mega Man X4 (PlayStation)
Mega Man X5 (PlayStation)
Mega Man X6 (PlayStation)
Mega Man X7 (PlayStation 2)
