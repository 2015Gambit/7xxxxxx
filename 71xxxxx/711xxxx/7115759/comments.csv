,Thejohndoemofo,2012-03-20T19:31Z,"Thank you for the upload!
Please keep seeding, everyone seems to be stuck at 42.4%."
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-03-21T08:48Z,"This is getting pathetic! Now most of us are up to 55.6% 
Why upload if you're not going to seed properly?"
,dbranson17,2012-03-21T15:40Z,"SERIOUSLY - an upload is always appreciated, but if you're not willing to seed long enough for the seeding to get rolling - JUST DON'T BOTHER."
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-03-22T03:08Z,"Done, thank you for finishing the initial seeding. It should take care of itself now.
The .cbr files look great. The annual is .jpg, not a problem. I'll figure out how to convert it."
,GeekShop,2012-03-29T21:53Z,"Sorry about the initial trouble guys, computer shut down unknowingly while I was out of town for a couple of days.  Should be good now but please let me know if there are any more issues."
,jabrad789,2012-08-25T06:14Z,Thanks for these.  This will complete my full set of all LOSH.  Anyone know where I can get the New Gods (Kirby issues)?
