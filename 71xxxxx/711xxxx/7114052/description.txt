PLOT:

The gingerdead man travels back in time to 1976 and carries out an epic disco killing spree. 

Can the world stomach a third Gingerdead Man movie? You better have an appetite for more because the foul-mouthed maniac cookie is back for a third helping, and this time he's time traveling back to the 1970's to dish out some disco death.

Charles Band has released the first trailer from the third unlikely installment in the Gingerdead Man franchise, the whimsically titled Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver. The plot this time somehow has the psycho pastry hopping into a time machine to go on a killing spree in the disco era. William Butler (Furnace) directed and co-wrote this latest campy tale mixing rolling pin chills with roller boogie thrills.

An April DVD release has been hinted at even though no official date has been announced yet. Something tells me this won't be getting a four-knife review like I so infamously gave the original, but at the same time, part three looks like a marked improvement over part two. Sadly, Gary Busey has still not returned to once again provide the voice of the titular fritter.
