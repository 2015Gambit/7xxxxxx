The Crystal Maze
Series 1, 2, 3, 4 - Complete (1990-1993)

The Crystal Maze was a legendary game show, produced by Chatsworth Television
and shown on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom from 1990 to 1995. Repeated
episodes are often shown on digital television channels, most recently Ftn
and Challenge from January 2007. There was one series per year, with the first
four series presented by Richard O'Brien and the final two by Ed Tudor-Pole.
Each show was one hour long, including commercial breaks.

This is every Richard O'Brien Episode from the regular series with the Christmas specials from series 3 and 4 (there wasn't one for series 1, not sure about 2).

If you haven't seen this show before it is basically like real-life "Mario Party".



The attached document(a little easier to look at) and below is an original drinking game we like to call "Crystal Haze", just pour a drink, have a read-through of the rules, and throw on an episode. 

You may have to first watch an episode to understand the game structure and thus a couple rules.

Please enjoy responsibly!
