Reload your shotgun, sharpen your sword and rev that chainsaw; Deadhill
town is teeming with zombies, and it s your job to put em down! The fate
of humanity rests in the hands of four unlikely heroes: Jack, the gamer;
Rachel, the girl; Brian, the geek; and Luxo, the alien. Go it alone, or
enlist the services of up to three like-minded chums to survive the
zombie apocalypse

The spiritual successor to Burn Zombie Burn!, All Zombies Must Die!
builds on the classic twin-stick shooter formula with a smattering of
role-playing features. Level up characters, complete side quests and
collect items to craft deadly new weapons. There's no shortage of
options in how you choose to dispose of the undead, but the
brain-chompers aren't going to take it lying down. The shuffling
cadavers come in varying shapes and sizes, and are affected by four
environmental modifiers; fire, radiation, sonic and shock. Use your
weapons and the environment carefully, and you might just make it out
in one piece
