if avg also deletet your .exe because of hacktool


DO NEVER TRUST AVG,

First they make the internet very secure, and now they ruined it all with false virus reporting. 

They are earning a lot of money from companies, AVG will ban keygen, .exe ect. files for them and even locate them so the newest ones getting banned. It all depends of how much you are willing to pay these assf..kers

Many allow the virus because they dont trust AVG. So if you want to upload your newest Virus/hacktool, just buy a new game and add the hackcodes within the .exe file and now you have control over millions of pc┬┤s

THANKS AVG 



Please tell me:

Witch antivirus are the most reliable?

Kaspersky?
