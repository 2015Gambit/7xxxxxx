,chedderz66,2012-03-19T00:41Z,Didn't included a sample so pretty sure it's the same shitty copy making the rounds. 
,troyg1969,2012-03-19T05:51Z,"total BS won't play nor will it convert FAKE
 FAKE FAKE"
,logan-x-art,2012-03-19T06:03Z,"yea there is seriously something wrong with this file...

I tried to download it twice...it gets about a quarter of the way there...then in just a few seconds its at 99%...

first time Ive seen this kind of error...

TvTeam is a legit uploader...always has been...but this file is jacked up for me..."
,some-young-guy,2012-03-19T11:18Z,"Some months ago, I was warned by my ISP about copywritten materials.  I'm pretty sure I downloaded the torrent from TvTeam and/or SceneBalance who I am pretty sure is run by the same person.  I use a MAC spoofer created by Iron Geek and to date it has not let me down save for that one time.

Not sure if the torrent was corrupt from the start or whether an agent merely downloaded said torrent and captured all IP addresses and went from  there."
,silentinquiry,2012-03-19T14:04Z,Same problem with my isp notifying me about copywrite issue. Wasnt either torrent but found one of my p2p share features with frostwire was not disabled. No problems since then FYI
,Lkim65,2012-03-19T18:58Z,"Well, thanks for the warnings.  I wonder what's up since TvTeam is a legit uploader."
,undermaker,2012-03-21T21:19Z,TvTeam-account maybe hacked and all his uploads are fakes...not sure but i think...
