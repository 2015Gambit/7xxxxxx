,MrMilf,2012-03-27T14:52Z,Hey AncientRome I hope that you still have this torrent because i just recently watched this anime and absolutely love it!! and i have tried to download it but it is currently stuck at 70%.. :(( I need more seeders then i promise to seed this for as long as a i can!
[T],AncientRome,2012-03-28T16:19Z,"I'm glad you like this show, I have had this torrent seeding for months now, and not many people seem enthused about downloading it. It's on my seedbox so it''s a guarantee that you'll have it soon."
,mikk265i,2012-04-28T22:23Z,"hey ancientrome can you please seed again iÂ´m  currently stuck at 98,9%"
,maulerguy,2012-05-02T02:06Z,"I'm also stuck, detecting about 30 peers but less than 97% is available. I really think just another day or two of seeding, maybe with high priority bandwidth allocation, can sort everybody out and make this a healthy torrent. It's the only download I can find in high def that has subtitles so I'd really appreciate it if I could finish getting this series."
,maulerguy,2012-05-09T02:36Z,Do you keep a black- or whitelist of IP addresses perchance? Unless your bandwidth is being overloaded on other torrents I can't think of any other reason that nobody seems to be able to finish downloading while you're seeding. Just wondering since I've had 0/1 seeds connected a few times over the past few days.
,KillerCactus,2012-05-14T20:01Z,"Hey, thanks for uploading this but I'm stuck at 97%. I was wondering if you could seed so I could seed once it's finished."
,RayLeighz,2012-06-03T13:17Z,"I'm Stuck At 96% , Are You Still Seeding?"
,zabbytpb,2012-06-05T18:15Z,Managed to find those missing bits in another torrent. Gonna seed as long as I can.
