For those who don't know what Episode 12 - True Route means, it is pretty simple.

Watch the regular episode 12 if you want to stop watching there.
If you wish to continue the series like the director wanted it to be, watch episdoe 12 true route.


Due to various reasons the series was told to stop at episode 12 for TV.
Probably due to the odd number of episodes.
