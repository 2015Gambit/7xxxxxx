,ocumcised,2012-07-05T21:09Z,So far every movie with this name and the word hardcoded in it has had the way out of sync subs and could not be repaired because of hardcoded. Why not forget hardcoded and make them all .srt so when there is a mistake it won't make the video file 100% useless.

Thanks for not using borders in video so I could use MPEG4Modifier to change aspect ratio."
