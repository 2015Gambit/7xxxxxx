,jimbuck2,2012-03-20T20:02Z,Bullshit download.  This is nothing more than an ad for the video.  On their site they want $55.  Not sure what you get for your money.

Are you getting paid to post this upload? have you seen what this is all about? they are selling their video and it is not free. I bought this 2 years ago and it has nothing to enhance my knowledge in computer repair.. "
