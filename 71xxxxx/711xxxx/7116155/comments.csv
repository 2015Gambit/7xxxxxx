,super_pipo,2012-03-27T06:02Z,Thanks for the great upload!  A 10 / V 10.  Anyway to get SRT file that will have english subtitles?  The audio is in english but I like to have subtitles on as well sometimes.  Thanks once again.
,HoverJet,2012-04-26T00:40Z,is this the english or american dub?
,silentwaiting,2012-05-06T20:12Z,"A10 V10. That animation is smooth and as beautiful as all Ghibli films. It's the British English version... or English English if you prefer lol...

I'm personally waiting for the Disney dub because seen as I live in Canada, that's the one I'll be able to buy... and I do intend to buy.

I'll keep this around and watch it once I've seen the American dub. However, of the 20 seconds I watched, the voicing sounds really good. Much better than other UK dubs I've seen... I hated the Castle in the Sky UK dub..."
,iloveshrimp,2012-05-26T02:05Z,does anyone have the disney version? i cant seem to find it on here. 
,silentwaiting,2012-05-27T16:27Z,"Word of warning: it doesn't play correctly on the PS3. The audio and video are recorded at different rates and the audio gets ahead. VLC or Media Player Classic can play it correctly but the PS3 cannot.

also, yes i have the Disney version, only in a dvd rip. I'll post it later."

,TheRetroZombie,2012-08-09T15:09Z,Make sure to play the movie on a VLC player. Playing on Windows Media Player will cause the audio to go out of sync.
