-------NOTES-------
Most of these are the retail versions of The Sims 3, Expansions and Stuff packs.
Serials and cracks are not provided, they are available on the internet.
A few of the ISO's may have cracks and keygens, it is recommended that you only use
  the keygens for serials, most of the ISO's will not have cracks, serials or keygens.

It is suggested that you install the games, run patches and then find a No-CD Crack.
It is also suggested that you keep the original .exe and .dll files before applying any cracks
  that way you can install patches in the future.
