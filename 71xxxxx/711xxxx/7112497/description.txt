Notes -

Had another go at this...Dont Really know waht to call this cuz its not really R6
not DVDSCR, not really a cam/ts.. mayb a TC.. but no sure so went ahead with the R6 it
was tagged with when i got it....
Crop, resize, major denoise adjusted brightness a lil bit, contrast, levels and sharpened it.. then
HARDCODED English subs and upmixed audio to 5.1... enjoy
