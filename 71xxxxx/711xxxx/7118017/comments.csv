[V],wushdishmeen,2012-03-21T18:37Z,"All 4 out at once and 1 of them was impacted so they had to cut my gum open.  Surprisingly the actual extractions didn't hurt because I was numbed up like a mofo.

I refused the nitrous or any sort of anesthesia and made it through with just the numbing injections.  It's AFTERWARDS that sucks...my kitchen, bathrooms, and towels all covered in blood and it took an entire day to stop the bleeding.  I was just drooling and swallowing blood all day... gross.

The next day I woke up with swollen cheek on the side they had to cut and stitch the gum.  I was really sore.

They gave me a bunch of vicodin though so I've been popping those like candy and so I've been doing okay now.  High as fuck and sleeping late.

Todays show will be up in 15 mins!  SORRY"
