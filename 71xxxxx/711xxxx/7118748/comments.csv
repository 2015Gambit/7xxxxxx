[T],warriorph,2012-03-22T07:40Z,U can try installing Combined Community Codec Pack. All my ups play perfectly in my vlc media player & wd tv live hub stand-alone hd media player.
[T],warriorph,2012-03-22T09:42Z,"don't delete, sayang! madali lang yang problema mo. mape-play mo rin yan! ano bang specs ng pc/laptop mo? OS?"
[T],warriorph,2012-03-22T10:02Z,"i need to maintain a small file size, dolby audio & 720pixel width resolution which i cannot do in xvid codec. that's why i switch to x264."
[T],warriorph,2012-03-22T12:32Z,"good to hear that sir! nagtaka lang ako kung bakit di gumana sa vlc samantalang may sariling codecs din ang vlc media player kaya compatible halos lahat ng video format sa kanya. anyway, mabuti't ok na. enjoy!^^"
