Today will be fun I'm gonna give ya something to fry the Windows 8 Activation with something I did on Office 2010.  I'm not gonna bother covering up the coding as this is gonna be fixed in the RTM escrow builds of Windows 8.  I personally have no idea why this made it into the Official Windows Consumer Preview 8250 build but hey lets not take things entirely for granted.

I'll be posting this under an alias and you can find support on www.DevScene.me if you wish the basic coding is already there.

The upload should contain only:

Win 8 Reg Hack.bat

Have fun with this but if this is in the RTM I'll laugh my ass off.
