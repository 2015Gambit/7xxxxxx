,syaugust8,2012-03-21T03:17Z,Although I despise Trump's sons for butchering wild animals such as cheetahs and elephants (how hard can it be to hunt when the animals are CORRALLED INTO A DESIGNATED FENCED-IN AREA FOR YOU?!) I still love this show.  I hope Lisa Lampanelli wins or at least makes it relatively far in the competition.  Her and Patricia Velasquez appear to be the only two on the women's team with any sense whatsoever.  Thanks for the upload!
