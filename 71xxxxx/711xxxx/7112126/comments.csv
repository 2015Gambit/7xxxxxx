,boompali,2012-03-18T22:18Z,"bro froggie100 i love ur uploads.. but i fail to understand how can a T.S be 720p ? 
and should it be in this category ? 
respek !"
,simon200,2012-03-18T22:36Z,cheers
,simon200,2012-03-18T22:38Z,"@boompali
He means it was shot with a 720p cam in the cinema "
,theeccentrik,2012-03-19T01:36Z,"The cams out so early have been ok quality compared to other movie cams out at the mo but a cam is still a cam.
Anyone who hasn't DL'd a ""720p ts "" from PB yet don't expect HD as it's far from it. The title is intentionally misleading so u will download it!"
,saint84,2012-03-19T11:17Z,"great cam . however , i agree, this movie should not be listed in the high resolution , high def movie section ."
,WangLeeHk,2012-03-19T14:58Z,Nice cam. Thank you very much!
[V],froggie100,2012-03-19T15:27Z,not my fault.... i put this in normal movies.. some one.... changed it to high def.. must e automatic.. i think  because it has 720p in the title... .. other than enjoy... this you cannot get better than this for a cam to be fair..
,ManuelRivero,2012-03-19T20:32Z,"Thank you Froggie! Another great upload.

I agree that TPB should make a section for CAMS/TS only both SD and HD."
,theeccentrik,2012-03-20T04:43Z,"Thanks anyway, i agree that this is a decent cam compared to most that's on pb!"
,Sir_Alcapone,2012-03-20T11:50Z,"Good work...
When post in high qualaty !?"
,BarraKas,2012-03-20T23:13Z,rate ffs
,Shadeztreez,2012-03-20T23:35Z,"Can someone let me know how to download only sample files? i used to be able to select what files i wanted to download, but now i cannot. using Utorrent 3.1.2
I know this isn't the best place for this question but i'm kind of a dick. Thanks."
,RumataDEstor,2012-03-21T06:58Z,"Shadeztreez, you can't choose the content of that torrent cuz it's only a magnet link and not proper torrent"
,RumataDEstor,2012-03-21T09:07Z,"I looked it through. It almost DVD quality, both A and V, but I guess I would still wait for actual DVD. Thanks for the work though!! :)"
,xtc_rush,2012-03-21T15:43Z,"A:5 
V:5

this is nothing like 720p , its cam rip at best !
a decent cam rip perhaps but to list as 720 
is complete BS"
,Mikkel Rev,2012-03-21T17:50Z,I cannot see why someone would watch this? Crap quality. Wait for proper realease
,g37371,2012-03-21T18:12Z,You a fucking cunt uploading shit quality as 720
,najene,2012-03-22T14:11Z,"What in the F is this lousy cam doing as a ""hi res""?"
,RawBam,2012-03-23T13:07Z,"Shadeztreez, when you open a magnet link in utorrent, select the torrent, then select the files tab at the bottom (you may need to let it download for a minute or two until the files in the torrent are visible). Once you can see the files, you can right click the files you don't want and select don't download."

Keep your asinine comments to yourself I see you have never uploaded you piece of shit"
,MrWabbit,2012-03-24T21:15Z,To all the asshats commenting the reason it is in the hidef area is.most likely that is was shot with a 720 camcorder. and it refers to the video demensions not the resolution.
,MrWabbit,2012-03-24T21:16Z,Thanks for the up btw
,sweet1969,2012-03-27T15:26Z,"Sorry, had to vote -!!!  This is NOT HIGH RES AND SHOULD NOT BE PUT IN THIS CATAGORY!!!"
,Eb0la,2012-03-28T03:02Z,people should learn to read the comments before bitching!!
,fagant1,2012-03-28T20:48Z,The dark scenes are very blurry and hard to see. 
,ZaclR_2,2012-03-29T00:20Z,"Dear bitchers:

Yes, the video IS 720p, and yes, it belongs in this category. What you fail to realize, is that it is also a cam rip. I'll repeat that so even you understand: THE RECORDING OF THE MOVIE HAS BEEN DONE WITH A 720p QUALITY CAMERA, THUS IT IS 720p, BUT IT IS A CAM RIP, SO IT'S CRAP ANYWAY COMPARED TO BLU-RAY RIPS. This is informed about in the title (see the fucking ""TS"" there? It stands for TeleSync and indicates that it's a cam rip you blind bitch). Learn to read and get your facts straight before raging your ass off, dumbfucks.

/rage"
,Punisher_Bay,2012-04-02T00:55Z,right on ZaclR_2!!!!!
,mallrat4k,2012-04-02T19:51Z,"Thee should be a High Quality section here. since High res doesnt mean high quality. as you can see on this torrent. 

hell, phone cameras also shoot in 1080, which per definition is hi-res. but itÂ´s not a given that itÂ´s high quality."
,kotn420,2012-04-03T08:36Z,TS=total shit don't waste your time on this waste of space
,Faethor55,2012-04-06T04:45Z,"LOL ""cam rip"" are we so desparate to act like we know our sh*t,  that we start inventing a new category?"
,TDA21,2012-04-07T01:06Z,This is Crap!
,sweet1969,2012-04-07T20:27Z,"NEGATIVE POINT, SORRY!!  YOU SAY IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT THAT IT'S IN THE HD SECTION....BUT U ADMIT PUTTING ""720P"" IN THE TITLE!!!  IT IS YOUR FAULT!!  720P SHOULDN'T BE WRITTEN ANYWHERE NEAR THIS TS PIECE OF SHIT!!  DON'T DO THAT AGAIN UNLESS U WANT EVEN MORE NEGATIVE POINTS!! wtf...

p.s. I love many of your other legit releases!!"
,Aaron3ous,2012-04-08T02:28Z,"ZaclR_2,

I suppose you can enjoy being correct on a technicality, but clearly no one is concerned with whether or not a shitty quality cam recorded video was filmed in high resolution or not, and it's misleading to label it as such. Especially when it isn't mentioned anywhere else that it is a cam recording. For all intents and purposes ""720p"" or ""1080p"" on here should mean that they're Bluray rips."
,richy11111,2012-04-08T14:22Z,agressive or what froggie is always cam-sunday pirates or what
,Erlik87,2012-04-09T06:34Z,"To all the idiots who don't know how to read:

the title of this torrent says, in stupid speak, the the name of the movie is John Carter, it has a res of 720p and is CAM RECORDING. Nothing there is a lie, your just stupid. SO QUIT YOUR BITCHIN AND LEARN HOW TO READ!!!!!!

ps,
The movie hasn't come out on dvd or blu-ray so expecting this to be top notch quality is just dumb."
,Xebecs1,2012-04-09T07:11Z,"Hey! Stop fighting! Cam Rip or no, Ts or Bs, 720p or 240p quality, its free sh!t! Wait for better release if you are SOOOOO inclined...
No hard feelings..."
,piizda,2012-04-10T06:41Z,"Why should you upload crap on TPB?
Make TPB famous and respectable by uploading working and good stuff.

Ohh yes the movie. Didnt finish watching it coz too bad quality.

CAM"
,tantrictim,2012-04-20T05:16Z,these assclowns who put TeleSync (TS) in the 720p  hi-res category need to be shot and pissed on
,JayDeeJimmy,2012-04-21T13:22Z,"unbelievably dark during dark scenes, unwatchable during dark scenes, the rest is fine,

A - 8
V - 5"
