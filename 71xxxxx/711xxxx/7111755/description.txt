Review by Scott Yanow:
Shortly after returning to the U.S. (following three years in Copenhagen) Stan Getz had a musical reunion with Bob Brookmeyer. As usual the cool-toned tenor blends in very well with the valve trombonist and, backed by a fine rhythm section (pianist Steve Kuhn, bassist John Neves and drummer Roy Haynes), they perform three Brookmeyer pieces (including one titled "Minuet Circa '61"), two standards and Buck Clayton's "Love Jumped Out." This little-known session is often quite memorable.

01. Minuet Circa '61   
02. Who Could Care    
03. Nice Work If You Can Get It    
04. Thump, Thump, Thump   
05. A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square  
06. Love Jumped Out
