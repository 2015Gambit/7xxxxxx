,mikrovision,2012-03-18T22:11Z,"Thanks for the up, slicknick.
Will you be providing the 2012 AMA roadracing?"
,micklemack,2012-03-19T13:32Z,"If anyone can help me!
All I can see is the magnet link, no matter how many times I reload the page!
I have to wait half a day for it to come up on another site so I can get the torrent file!
Don't know why it is not showing up!
Now the third week in a row I can't get it from Piratebay!!!!!!!!!"
,slicknick610,2012-03-19T22:41Z,@micklemack TPB switched to only magnet torrents weeks ago buddy. If you dont know something google it. U can download magnet torrents with utorrent.
,whatarrow,2012-03-21T05:08Z,@slicknick610 - you're such a bad dude. Love your works! It helps us a lot.... more power slick!
,micklemack,2012-03-26T05:35Z,"Yeah I tried Utorrent but it doesn't seem to allow split files. As in the beautiful country of Vanuatu it takes me 4 days to download 1.5 gig at roughly 15kb a second when I can get it! The server restricts downloads. Also Utorrent when I have used it for whatever reason is not as selfish as bittryrant and doesn't also allow download during the day which I seem to be able to get with bittyrant, because the server here also restricts downloads it is pretty hard for me to upload, all mine will be open but they just won't seed through utorrent. Bittyrant doesn't seem to handle magnet links and I am on the most recent. So I am still unable to use piratebay for the download!"
