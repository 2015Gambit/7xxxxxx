,whmxtra,2012-03-31T04:05Z,"He's out of town atm, think he might be back this weekend or early next week, will see if I can dig up a version of it till he gets his uploaded."
[T],burgundyranger,2012-04-06T15:00Z,"Sorry for the delay. A) I WAS out of town for 10 days and, B) dekabroken had equipment issues which kept him from recorded Episode 6. Once it repeats or becomes available on VOD, he'll encoded it and I'll post it here.

Here's a link to an alternate download site:

(Again, replace that first x with an a to get the correct URL)"
