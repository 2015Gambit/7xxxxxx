Happy game for all of you ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-19T09:21Z,"Hi and download and unzip my JpCsp STARTER.exe , a perfect executable to launch the emulator without the console window , donÂ´t remove the bat , just put this worked executable on the emulator folder and run the emulator from this executable and it will be just the emulator going in a nice way ...

[V],globeplus,2012-03-19T10:46Z,"Another GLOBE quality rip for the PSP with the other GOD OF WAR game worked  after getting the iso with less 460 mb for Ghost Of Sparta , now dropped from 1.49 Gb the original iso to after the work keeping everything and with the same quality for 826 mb what means 664 mb less for exactly the same game with nothing removed and the same quality , what means that  in this 2 God of War PSP games 1.12 Gb less in the hard disk space for the same games and i gived the isos in 7zip , with an PSP iso converter probably the cso conversion can give even less size for this games ...

On this game beside getted more size removed i get after the compression more 34 mb than for Ghost Of Sparta , the reason is that the Data files gived a some less compression than for the other game but no big deal anyway ... the result like i said is more than 1.1 Gb less on the hard disk space in only 2 games and with everything looking absolutly normal , my work on the PSP will keep going on this next days at least with the best PSP games beeing ripped with quality if it is possible the work of course , i hope the users getb this opportunity to get them intact for a nice size because that it is the spirit that i make n the work for myself and any less hard disk space getted with nice work is always welcome ... 

See all of you and happy games to all of you ."
