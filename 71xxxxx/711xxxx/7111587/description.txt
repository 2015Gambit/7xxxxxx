- ARTIST
Marillion are a British rock band, formed in 1979. 
Their recorded studio output comprises sixteen albums generally regarded in two distinct eras, delineated by the departure of original vocalist and frontman Fish in late 1988, and the subsequent arrival of replacement  Steve Hogarth in early 1989.
Their original sound (with Fish on vocals) is best described as guitar and keyboard led progressive rock or "neo-prog", and would be sometimes compared with Gabriel-era Genesis.
More recently, their sound has been compared, on successive albums, to that of Radiohead, Massive Attack, Keane, Crowded House, The Blue Nile and Talk Talk.
They sold more than 15 million records and are renowned for having an extremely dedicated following.
