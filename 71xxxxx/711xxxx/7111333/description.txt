Details:

ItΓÇÖs usually not a good sign when a quirky band goes out of its way to be conventional. But for Alex Schaaf and Yellow Ostrich, itΓÇÖs the right call. SchaafΓÇÖs one-man debut The Mistress made the most of its limitations, using vocal loops and sprightly guitars to give everything a blithe, uncomplicated charm. But to promote the record (including gigs with Ra Ra Riot and The Antlers), he needed backing musicians, and Yellow Ostrich became a bona fide rock band in the process. Given the impressive talents of drummer Michael Tapper (formerly of We Are Scientists) and multi-instrumentalist Jon Natchez, itΓÇÖs hard to imagine the band restricting itself to The MistressΓÇÖ lo-fi aesthetic.
