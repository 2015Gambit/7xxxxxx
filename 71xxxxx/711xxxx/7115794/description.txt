
Is this true? Why haven't heard this before? Is this a christian group that is using other peoples suffering just to raise money for their on promotional material. Invisible children????? Is their agenda to target teenagers to convert with out their knowledge using non-christian language just like intelligent design tried to use pseudoscience. I downloaded one of their videos a few months back by mistake and at the time all I thought was "that was oddly fascist" then deleted it. With that video in hindsight I fear that this is true. And if so using real atrocities to make money for your own - Well its disgusting.

Could someone with more resources than me look this up before more people get ripped off
