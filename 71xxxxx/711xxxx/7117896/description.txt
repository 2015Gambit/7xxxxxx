(Windows Media Audio/Video File)

As the heat is turned up on the suspicions surrounding Spencer, the girls must come to the reality that they aren't the only ones hiding secrets in Rosewood. Emily and Aria overhear Caleb arguing with someone on the phone about Hanna. They tell Hanna they believe it was a girl, and soon they see Jenna with a pendant Hanna thought Caleb intended for her -- and which turns out to be a flash drive. Hanna confronts Caleb, who says he's been spying for Jenna and she kicks him out of the house for good. Later, Hanna runs into Jenna in the school restroom and slaps her. Jenna cries, and this is the second time we see her face. Aria's mom finds out Aria is dating someone, and tries to find out whom. Aria's dad soon joins in the investigation and nearly finds out about Ezra, until Aria's parents fight over whether they should pry into Aria's life, reversing their reconciliation. Ian encourages Spencer to run away, and Toby asks her not to. Spencer's mother tells Spencer that the police have new evidence against her, but that she thinks Spencer is innocent. Emily and Paige reconcile after Paige reconciles herself to being gay.
