Details:

Thieves Like Us on this, their fourth record, show allegorical wit. The cover art displays the extent to which we bleed: at its most horrific we look into the shards of a broken mirror, almost Jean Marais-like. Do we see a constellation of fractured reflections and cut ourselves adrift at exponential rates until the blood runs cold? There is unquestioned beauty in this questioning of what our nature is ΓÇô and almost every track encourages a true faith in this often unexplored idea.
