scrunter - You can change (set) the profiles (4.1) Higher or Lower with a program called tsMuxerGUI.
Just ADD your video to the Program                                                                                                Then go down to (General Track Options)
Tick the Box (Change Level:) This will High light the drop down Box,
Then Scroll Down to Level You Require    ( 1.0 TO 5.1 )
This is good for Playing Video On PS3  (Set to 4.1 or less) "
