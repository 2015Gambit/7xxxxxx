Another encoder who feels they had some kind of involvement in making this film by adding watermarks. Nobody is going to visit your website. Please stop the madness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,ole_olsen32,2012-04-02T00:57Z,"I encoded this with DVD Flick and burned with ImgBurn.  In addition to the encoder's watermark, ten minutes into the movie I got a message telling me that the disc contained Cinavia copy protection software and was not authorized for playback.  "
,SuperSalad1,2012-04-04T03:48Z,"You managed to ruin the beautiful intro with your obnoxious water mark, are persist to distract throughout the movie with continued watermarks. Well, I'll at least remember the name srkfan from not on so I know what to avoid.
Call me entitled if you must, but the fact remains there are plenty of people out there providing as good if not better rips without covering in obnoxious watermarks. "
,SuperSalad1,2012-04-04T03:51Z,"Hm, I made an account to just post on this and wasn't aware I couldnt go back and edit posts. I'll have to be more careful with typos from now on."
