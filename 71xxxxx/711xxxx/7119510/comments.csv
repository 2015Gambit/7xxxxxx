,[ENC]ode[001],2012-04-08T05:20Z,Actually you can mount 2 dvd's. You can mount any number of images. You just have to install more than 1 virtual drive. Alcohol let's me have 5 Virtual Drives aside from my actual drive with no problems. I usually mount one at a time though just so there isn't an issue reading the discs. The software expects to read the cd's from the same drive anyways.
