,k.haas32,2012-03-24T08:17Z,ive actually have a question. Why is that we have to click on Magnet now to download? When I do it this way I can see the files that are downloading. I used to be able to click on the green arrows to download that particular movie. Any help on how this works now? I am using tixati that i just downloaded.
