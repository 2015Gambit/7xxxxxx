,CMBrian4,2012-03-20T15:03Z,"Thanx for the AVI , these MP4 files are Junk.. Even my new  TV will not play them.. Plays everything BUT MP4 CRAP...
When I play MP4 on my speakers, it sounds like Crap as well..
So I hope the people posting this junk audio , to save a few MG's , get with the program.
NEWER is NOT necessarily Better...."
