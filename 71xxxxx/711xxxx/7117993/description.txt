The iPad is a unique and totally revolutionary device in many ways. The iPad is a tablet computer featuring multi-touch interaction with print, video, photo, and audio multimedia, internet browsing, and runs most iPhone OS apps. The device has an LED-backlit 9.7-inch (25 cm) color LCD display and uses a virtual keyboard for text input. The iPad like the iTouch uses a Multi-touch interface that enables users to easily control the device and type with their fingers. 

It also includes sensors that automatically re-orient the screen display to match the orientation of the iPad, such as switching to landscape view when the user rotates the iPad 90 degrees when watching video. All iPad models include the applications Music, iWork, Videos, Photos, iTunes, iBook (providing access to the Wi-Fi Music Store and book store), Safari, YouTube, Calendar, Contacts, Clock, Calculator, and Settings.

My iPad, 3/e, will include necessary coverage of iTunes and iBook to enable readers to manage the content on their iPad as well as purchase applications and customizing settings. In addition, readers will learn how to use every feature of their iPad and receive expert advice on topics like customizing, running apps, using peripheral devices and more. This edition has been updated to include coverage on the main new features of iOS 5, including the revolutionary new iCloud, which allows users to update their iPads without having to sync up with their computer.
