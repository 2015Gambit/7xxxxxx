"From an unknown land and through distant skies came a winged warrior. Nothing remained sacred, no one was safe from the Hellion as it uttered its battle cry...Screaming for Vengeance."

The album reached No. 11 in the UK and No. 17 on Billboard 200 Pop Albums and made Judas Priest much more popular than they were after their British Steel album.

This album also includes their hit "You've Got Another Thing Comin'" and one of their most-popular on-stage performances, "Electric Eye".
