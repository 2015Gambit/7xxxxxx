[V],spastik64,2012-03-19T13:48Z,"At this moment (2012-03-19 13:46) there is only one seeder, me (with 100% full file) and I can see 2425 peers. The first peer is around 73% so wait a hour or less and download speed will go very fast. Enjoy."

,G4f4ruis,2012-03-20T03:30Z,"Can anyone please help shed some light and help me with a seed box question?  Magnet Links do not work for my ftp, but the traditional method, (With the three arrows pointing down,) works great.  Because I get to save file as instead of launching with a magnet link.  I fear I may be doing something wrong and appreciate any tips!"
,Waldo11,2012-03-20T17:49Z,"I had the same problem, but you just need to update your tracker. Works for me."
