,palci12,2012-03-19T13:31Z,is the same crack like original .... nothing fixed mug and nuts ; power and glory still unlocked :(
,damncrow,2012-03-19T13:48Z,"^ ""mug and nuts""... has to be one of the best gaming malapropisms I've seen.

Release kinda sucks, though. More rally is nice but complete it is not.
Deleting database_restrictions unlocks both mug and nuts (:D) and power and glory packs but then game just crashes when selecting any of those cars."

,Rando_q1,2012-03-19T20:01Z,for me save not working too even with local profile and deleteing those fils make game to crash.....
,Rando_q1,2012-03-19T22:17Z,"How to get saves working? its not so hard read 5. point carefully....(profileimport not with this torrent its with its there on crack folder http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7107243/Dirt_3_Complete_Edition-FiGHTCLUB)


1. Unpack the files with WinRAR or equivalent.
2. Burn or mount the .iso file.
3. Install the game, when prompted for serial enter anything.
4. Copy all the contents from the FiGHTCLUB folder on the DVD to the game installation folder, overwrite when prompted.
5. Run the file ProfileImport.exe once. It will create five blank savegame profiles. If any earlier (DiRT 3) savegame profiles exist on your computer the three first ones will be kept. (If you have other needs then prior to executing this step manually backup saved profiles and insert them later. Location is %USERPROFILE%/My Documents/My Games/DiRT3/savegame)"
,piratot,2012-03-24T13:38Z,"this is how i made it work:

I used the crack from skidrow 1.1update PLUS the crackfix from fightclub.

Do not remove the database restrictions files, because the game will crash.
I also cant see the Mud and guts car pack or Power and glory car pack, though i just started playing the game. it may unlock further in the game, i hope.
the other dlcs are unlocked in the game extras -> available add-ons menu.

hope this helped someone."
