,MomoAtari,2012-08-03T07:25Z,"I created an account for Pirate Bay just to log on and comment on your page. I speak for everyone in great appreciation for this. As a person dedicated to losing weight and getting fit, but with no money to afford the expenses of the video + the equipment and books - it's pretty hard to to do. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. I will be eternally greatful for this. =] "
