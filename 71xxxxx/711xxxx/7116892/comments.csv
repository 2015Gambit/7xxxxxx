Ys The Oath in Felghana v1.0 cracked READ NFO-THETA

Its clean and no virus

why people even bothering with reloaded version, all of them so far had virus in setup.exe, and were removed from piratebay. "
,boevsen,2012-03-20T14:32Z,"what virus does it have and how can it be removed, i couldnt detect any virus. not by any means saying it's not there, i just wanna know how to detect and get rid of it :)."
[T],azaq318,2012-03-20T14:49Z,"NanoEntity
Are you drunk or what? They were removed? Viruses?

Type Reloaded into search field and look through results.

It's clean and have no viruses in it."
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-20T16:45Z,"@azaq: At least two other RELOADED torrents of this game existed, and neither of them are on TPB any longer. I downloaded one of them, and the setup.exe file contained Win32:Dropper-gen [Drp]. The fact that both previous RELOADED uploads have been removed from TPB says to me that the virus alerts were legit.

I appreciate the upload, and I will take the time to download it again, but I was just letting you know why NanoEntity said what he did."
,dmmm123,2012-03-20T17:05Z,"So, quick question. Does this release work? A.K.A. does the crack work? Is the crack infected or not? Is the ""setup.exe"" infected or not?
Only 4 comments aren't enough for me to believe this works..."
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-20T17:45Z,"@dmmm123: I wish I could tell you. Utorrent doesn't seem to handle magnet links very well. I've had the torrent in my list for an hour now and it hasn't even downloaded the file list, much less started downloading any content.

I hate magnet links... is it too much to ask for the torrent file as an alternative?"
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-20T19:55Z,"Finally finished downloading. Avast! was not able to find any virus in the files on the CD nor in any of the files that were unpacked during installation. As far as I can tell, this is virus-free.

However, I can't get it to run. It does the same thing Ys VI does... it starts as a black screen, then stops responding and I'm forced to manually end the process.

Maybe it just doesn't run on Windows Vista or something."
,BackDaFuckup,2012-03-20T21:31Z,"No virus found by MSE. Thanx!

But is this really the work of reloaded?

Work's great anyhow."
,BackDaFuckup,2012-03-20T21:33Z,running on win7 ultimate by the way.
,RegginRellik,2012-03-20T23:22Z,"wait so there is no voice acting? why?
it helped a lot with some bosses"
[T],Nighted,2012-03-20T23:26Z,ClamWin found no virus. :)
,RegginRellik,2012-03-20T23:43Z,"there is no virus, 
also the game works perfectly on win7 64bit"
,dmmm123,2012-03-21T03:09Z,"Finally downloaded. It's installing perfectly so far. Will try and see if it works.

Running on Win7 Ultimate Edition 32 Bit"
,dmmm123,2012-03-21T04:38Z,"I can safely say that the game is running perfectly for me.
Those viruses that people keep reporting are one of two things:
1) People trolling, or
2) People getting FALSE POSITIVES

I have scanned the installation, the *.iso file, my whole computer with 3 antiviruses, and nothing turned up.
The game is working perfectly on Windows 7: Ultimate Edition (32 Bit). No crashes, no stuttering, no lags, nothing.
Happy playing! I know I will! :D"
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-21T05:41Z,Did anyone that's gotten it to work have to do anything out of the ordinary? I still can't get it to run on Vista. I don't see why it would work on Windows 7 but not Vista.
,PMK5,2012-03-21T06:21Z,I love you Azaq318!!
,RickyTheFish,2012-03-21T11:55Z,"Finally got this game up and running. For anyone that has Windows Vista and is getting the black screen problem I mentioned earlier, it's likely that you have a codec that's conflicting with the game. In my case, the codec in question was FFDShow; if you have it, start by uninstalling that one. If that doesn't help, try removing any uninstallable codecs one by one until the game finally works; chances are that the one you removed right before the game started functioning was the one causing the conflict. I hope this helps anyone that was having this problem.

Now that I'm able to finally play, I can say for certain that this is a fully-working game with no viruses. Thanks, azaq318!"
[T],azaq318,2012-03-21T13:09Z,"PMK5
I love you to man :-)"
,gaza99,2012-03-21T14:37Z,"There is no text in conversation and menu, any solution?"
,cachuli87,2012-03-21T20:51Z,i've the same problem no text on menu and conversation
,points42,2012-03-22T03:38Z,"Same problem, no dialog or Menu text "
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-03-22T05:27Z,Cheers for the upload!!
,elDunge,2012-03-22T22:39Z,NanoEntity: You can be sure both Reloaded and Theta will never pack virus at the source. People can embed virus in any executable. You should check the uploader name and not the release group name. Reloaded/Skidrow are usually the official scenes accepted releases and I prefer them over Theta because they usually pack updates better.
,seed513,2012-03-23T04:19Z,"Game works fine but,when I get the fire bracelet It says that I need to hold down C to charge it,but nothing happens,I've tried crack fixes but it won't fix this bug,I need help!"
,ecchiless,2012-03-23T05:26Z,"@seed513

Thats cause u need to read the fking manual man, if u read that then u should know that for charge attacks with magic u need crystals.... in the quary u can find ur first crystal so check again."
,HakitoJin,2012-03-23T15:03Z,"Works great, Avast DIDN'T detect any sort of virus, and the game was fun to play."
,Skaryn,2012-03-23T23:09Z,"I can't save on this.I have Vista.When it saves,after a few tries,i try to load and it says it's corrupt.Did this happened to anyone?"

,Chaoz6,2012-07-18T12:17Z,I have this problem my saves all disappeared. No idea why or how because I had exited the game before and returned to saves still being there. Anyone know where they are saved or something? Don't want to start all over again thanks.
