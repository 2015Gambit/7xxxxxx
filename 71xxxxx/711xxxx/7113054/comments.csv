,BlackThaRipper,2012-03-27T23:59Z,Almost 1400 seeders and you guys can't get a good dl speed? It's obviously your internet connection cause I'm sitting at almost 2 mp/s.
,BKev420,2012-03-28T02:30Z,DOES THIS HAVE SUBTITLES?
,fire6316124,2012-03-28T08:19Z,"please someone tell us

,Sublime865,2012-03-29T02:43Z,"Running latest utorrent, it shows up when I click the magnet link get this torrent, but the torrent doesnt show any files in the prompt nor does it show a size, or list any files in the file window of utorrent. but it's downloading... ?!? Did I break the internet? Or am I just borking some setting in utorrent?"
,Sublime865,2012-03-29T02:47Z,"Was a moment of stupidity, didn't realize had to download the file index as well (utorrent did it automatically, I just didn't realize it took a min). New to the whole magnet link thing :/ my bad guys"
,Shadow416,2012-03-30T03:09Z,"for the people wondering about subtitles, NO there ARE NO subtitle files OR any embedded subtitle videos. Sorry, 

video quality - 6/7 out of 10
sound quality - 7 out of 10

all files are complete. thank you for the upload manOtor"
,tonyyoyo,2012-04-10T11:03Z,The sound on this is fucking shite. 
,benderrrrr,2012-04-12T21:31Z,Who friggin retard recorded this shit with some kind of adaptice sound level control!?! Impossible to watch some of the episodes with cricket chirping going up n down with people speeking.
,dragonov5,2012-04-30T22:38Z,What are you talking about? The speed of this torrent is fantastic 1 mb/s instantaneously. It's your internet connection
,JulesCow,2012-05-18T00:43Z,"Seems to be pretty bad quality. That aside, here's a general warning: not to discourage seeding but I just got an email from my ISP for copyright infringement. Depends what country you're in I guess. Now I watch all the new EPs through the-walking-dead.bazinga.li (HD stream, you just need to register). Gotta look for alternatives, sadly."
,jakeDassler,2012-05-26T05:36Z,"very bad quality torrent
guys,if u still dloading forget it, cancel the dload and find other torrent
audio sucks like hell.video lag at some point.

not being ungrateful here but i just waste my time dloading 5gb of trash."
,Alexibear,2012-05-29T15:43Z,"Not a very bad torrent like some people have said. I suggest they get a new video player or something. Downloaded quickly. Audio isn't shitty like people say it is, video quality is television quality if not better. 
Also, nobody has voted down on this torrent, and has over 1000 seeders, so..one or two people say it is horrid. 1000 people think it is worth seeding. "
,N0id15,2012-05-29T22:14Z,"The quality is awesome! If the video sucks, watch on VLC media player."
,freshbreathman,2012-07-09T10:33Z,"I use VLC and I can confirm that the audio is very, very bad. The ambience sound level goes up and down whenever the characters are talking. Also, while I downloaded a single episode from season 2 earlier this year, I too got a letter informing me of copyright infringment. Never happened before, never happened again, but it seems like Walking Dead is being tracked more dilligently."
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-07-19T01:45Z,Thanks.
,tgbiker53,2012-08-04T23:00Z,Nice upload cant wait till season three!
,bragazar1710,2012-08-17T06:26Z,thanks.
,pt.,2012-08-17T20:37Z,Tanks for share.
,trina0301,2012-08-20T02:42Z,"ive been doing this for a yr or so, after u download how u seed cuz i thought it did it automatically."
,mslicious,2012-08-22T23:52Z,This feed rocks! Seeding now.
,monkeyman1397,2012-09-07T09:27Z,"This torrent is missing MANY scenes from commercial breaks and from the beginning and ends of the episodes, INCLUDING the scene where Shane kills Otis. Not to mention the audio/video are subpar. Do not waste your time with this torrent; this is shit tier. "
