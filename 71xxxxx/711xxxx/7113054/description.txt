                               The Complete Season 2


The Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series developed for television by Frank Darabont and based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard.

It tells the story of the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse; it follows a small group of survivors, traveling across the desolate United States in search of a new home away from the shuffling hordes of the undead. The group is led by Rick Grimes, who was a sheriff's deputy in a small Georgia town, before the zombie outbreak. As their situation grows more and more grim, the group's desperation to survive pushes them to the brink of insanity. At every turn they are faced with unspeakable horrorsΓÇöboth from the dead, and from the scattered remains of a struggling human populace.

When it becomes more and more obvious that their whole world is ravaged by the zombie apocalypse, the survivors struggle to stay alive and hold on to their humanity.
