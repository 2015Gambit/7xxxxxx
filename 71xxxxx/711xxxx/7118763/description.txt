Something Old Something New

Alex returns from a bachelor party and
makes a drunken marriage proposal to
Whitney. She laughs it off, but when
she finds out that he broke her one
rule about strip clubs -- no going
into the Champagne room - she sets out
to find Britnee, the dancer who lured
him in. The confrontation takes a turn
and Alex once again takes a knee.
Meanwhile, Lily and Neal continue to
figure out their new friendship and
Mark begins to realize that he has
feelings for Roxanne.
