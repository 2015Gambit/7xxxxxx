However, the past week, I've either been able to get video with no sound or sound with no video or just a blank screen.  I'm able to watch other programs except Days.  I reloaded Windows Media Player but the problem persists.  Have you done something different?  Is there something different I need to do?  Any advice you can give would be greatly  appreciated...sigh."
[T],jmanwf,2012-03-22T07:07Z,Yes it is a codec problem you need VLC Media player to play the sound and video windows media player is crap just my opinion i test all my files before i upload my files to make sure.  I am using a different convert to convert my iTunes files now i have to convert them to get them into unprotected format
