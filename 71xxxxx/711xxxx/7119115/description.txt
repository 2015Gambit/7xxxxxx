"Das Shrimp Boot"

Cleveland relies on energy supplements to keep 
himself awake in order to work overtime and earn 
enough vacation time to go on a Spring Break 
cruise with his family. But when his energy pill 
addiction forces him into rehab and his desperate 
attempt to escape to the cruise liner goes wrong,
he finds himself held hostage by pirates 
threatening the safety of those aboard the ship, 
including his own family.
