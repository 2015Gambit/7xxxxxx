,MrTTAO,2012-03-21T23:05Z,"Ok to all the dumbasses.
Blizzards has finished the game, you can buy it now and download a locked ""preload"" since the 18th of march that will unlock on may 15th. The reason for the 2 months delay is that their DRM/online servers are not ready yet even though the game is finished.

There is no doubt that this is the real finished game.
The question is whether or not this comes with a crack, most likely it does not which means you cannot play it. But downloading it now means you can play it quicker when the crack becomes available. Crackers are already working on cracking the preload."

@pimpmobile

You have no idea what you're talking about. Taking a look back at the ""classic"" aspects of D2 (without rose tinted glasses) and it's easy to see how dated the game systems are.

Barely any customization, horrible economy, end game way too repetitive.

D3 solves all of those extremely elegantly.

It's online to help combat bots and cheats. You do NOT have to play with other people if you don't want to."

this isnt an mmo. World of warcraft needs a private server to play because the server handles most of the game. your pc just handles the graphics and input and the server controls the data and the game world. 

This is diablo 3, your pc will hold the whole game, it will probably crack just like starcraft 2, singleplayer with no achievements or online features.

The game MIGHT work in single player after a hack or something but the only way to get Mutliplayer is to BUY the game. Diablo III requires blizzards server, So a Private pirated server would have to be created.

That means all the things that make the game fun---the loot drops, characters, and enemy AI on this game are served from Blizzard's servers. We pirates will have to come up with custom servers that reverse-engineer Blizzard's protocol. This is doable but (1) will take longer and (2) will provide a lower quality experience that Blizzard can, because they're run by volunteers. Just check WOW custom servers as an example.

By moving software onto their servers, Blizzard is moving towards making all games like MMO's---eventually they will be asking $$$/month for playing single-player games too. And there's precious little we can do about this.

I think the most optimistic thing we can hope is that their threats of remotely run loot and AI are fake, and this is just a pure activtation-style hack that can be easily circumvented. But I highly doubted. Unlike EA, Blizzard have the tech and money to do this. And Diablo's popular enough that they win."

So to actually hope for working copy some group first needs to get one original copy working with complete files and then crack it.

,mathisen9,2012-05-15T00:17Z,"no need to download this the game works like an mmo you need to connect to battle.net to play 

""YES even for singelplayer"" "
,hasonish,2012-05-15T01:23Z,Already bought it and everything.  Waiting for the unlock.  Might just use any upcoming crack to be able to play when I don't have an internet connection handy.
,Swiftwinter,2012-05-15T04:45Z,"Guys, don't bother downloading. Just wait for SKIDROW. You'll have to download it all over again because they had to tweak the installer. Patience is virtue."
,xhydeffx,2012-05-15T05:05Z,"Don't worry guys, it will be playable soon. Even if everything is stored on server, it's possible to be able to obtain all the files, piece them together and make the game playable pretty soon."
,dark_illusions,2012-05-15T05:52Z,yall need to stop trying to pirate this it wont work for a long time diablo 3 is a online only game and DOES NOT HAVE A OFFLINE SINGLE PLAYER MODE it will be ONLINE ONLY so that means no torrent of this will let u play the game untill theres a private server and all that built or some other workaround
,amakaka,2012-05-15T06:35Z,waiting for someone create a offline server so we can play the campaign.. there is no game that can't be cracked..
,bloodred125,2012-05-15T07:41Z,@dark_illusions..Starcraft 2 was cracked and could be played single player THIS will also be cracked and the same thing will happen...have you not played any other Blizzard pirated games before?

,bloodred125,2012-05-15T09:05Z,"why do you need a working server? this game will be able to be played and cracked for single player easy..if I wanted to play multiplayer though, id just shell out the pricetag and go play it :). I want the cracked version so i can play the single player offline."
,Doremonhg,2012-05-15T09:36Z,"@bloodred125: Yeah now the game has launch, there are still a lot of dumbass dream for a cracked version of this game... Seed please guys, Blizzard downloader is a fucking joke, downloaded it all and near the launch day it said something broken. WTF?????"
,Doremonhg,2012-05-15T09:38Z,"@roni09090 Typical bug, without a reason. I take that you need to redownload this little file lol. No error number attached to it, but just type it into google and see if there are anyone else experiencing that."
,Doremonhg,2012-05-15T09:52Z,"You can't just crack the game, you need to emulate a server, or connect to some server other people create, and since D3's database is huge, i suggest you guys at least wait for a year or just buy the goddamn game... Yes you can play single player, but with an internet online 24/24. You can choose to play alone or with other people (co-op). The only different between it is co-op is much more fun and mobs are much more powerful, as well as the loot. Play alone, and you can just stop the game whereever you want just to take some screenshots or as simple as take a light meal."
,bloodred125,2012-05-15T09:54Z,"i know people now that are trying to log on and cant even play the game theyve paid for..so epople saying just go buy it and youll be able to play it are full of sht. Online only SUX, its not preventing piracy, its just making gamers angry. "

FYI, This game needs to be connected to Battlenet AND ONLY BATTLENET to work in Single player. Blizzard set it up like this. Certain information needs to be downloaded from Battlenet. All your weapons, items, etc  are stored on thier servers. So if you want to play you have to pay. Sorry guys. "
,bravo2011,2012-05-16T22:27Z,"I went out and bought this it's worth it. Also Blizzard set this game up to work in single player only if the game is connected to Battlenet. Battlenet stores all your items and weapons on thier servers, Meaning the game will never work unless you are connected to thier servers ONLY. Paying customers couldnt play single player when the servers were shut down last night. Sorry , but if you want to play to have to pay for this one. There's no cracks and there will never be one, Blizzard designed it that way this time."

And Yes Im sure maybe down the road someone might program a crack, To crack the game they're going to have to crack the game(bypass 3 online security checks) , then set up a private server, then have that server provide some of the essential data needed for the game to run, then save everybodies hero's, items, weapons and stats. For the game to run in single player.

,bravo2011,2012-05-17T07:47Z,"@ahoyYematey

Your a dumbass, Yes all software can be cracked. This can be cracked too, BUT what I was saying is that this was set up like an MMO and 99% of the game is on your PC and 1% HAS to be on a server, ALL in game items, merchants  and the characters themselves are stored on the server. So somebody is going to have to spend $$$ to set up a private server, program that server and run it 24/7 just so you can play for free. I was posting this so people won't waste their time. But if your want to be a dumbass be my guest."
,KaizerNail,2012-05-17T09:24Z,"Blizzard fucked their fans with WOW, fucked them twice with SC2 and now the fans are back for another helping by preordering D3 2 million times.

,symbioticmind,2012-05-17T09:43Z,"I must say, I've never been so behind the try before you buy idea as I am with this game. Dungeon crawlers were the shit back in the day, but standards have risen, and I'm not sure blizzard has totally revamped the game with just a semblance of the old games for nostalgia's sake. I further worry that the real money auction could turn it into a free to play, where unless you are pumping a bunch of real money into it, your getting left in the dust buy some kid who's folks won't teach him the value of a dollar. I hate free to plays, and I would hate to PAY for a game, just to get the same experience. On the other hand, if people find a way to dupe items, there goes the ah all together. I could really see blizzard pumping out a game that is built on a house of cards and when it all crumbles, they walk away saying, ""whatever, we made a shitload"". Furthermore, this online only is a real shitty move. trying to stop some pirates by creating a headache for their own customers. You know how many people pirated the love guru? just because they DLed it doesn't mean they would otherwise pay for it. Oh, but on the other side of the coin, how many times have companies made a shit game, hype it up, sell it off, and people don't realize it sucks until AFTER they bought it, ""hey, that's just business"". I'm considering NOT buying it whether an emulator server comes out or not, on principle alone. and all you guys flaming everyone for not buying it, if you have or plan to buy it, why are you here?"
,symbioticmind,2012-05-17T10:08Z,"Back for one last flame. After reading some more about how some of our poor gaming brothers who paid for this game and couldn't play it, (not because of a launch glitch, not because of an unexpected popularity, but simply because they wanted everyone to have to verify their purchase) I'm not gonna buy it, under any circumstances. This kind of behavior can't be rewarded. flame all you want about the irony of a torrenter complaining about ethics, but this is tyrannical greed. I may even refuse to buy any other games they may make. Bethesda, Take their fucking crown away."

If you are here for a ""try before you buy"" shit, man I get it. I REALLY do. if you paid for it or are planning to, why are you on a torrent for the game? just to troll? I have a hard time wrapping my mind around why someone would log into tpb, look up a torrent, then talk shit just so they could walk away with some sense of superiority. I hope that clarified it.

I do agree, but to ease your mind Bethesda is currently developing a new The Elder Scrolls MMO at the moment. so in no time soon Blizzard will die as the shite company it is and Beth Soft will be supreme, cause i am fairly confident a TES MMO would KILL WoW. seriously how many people play TES as well as WoW for their MMO needs, so yeah just my 2 cents"
,Wolfwood428,2012-05-17T18:00Z,"i meant to say as well, Those who play TES will go over to the TES MMO because tho lore makes some damn sense and they don't drastically change it and refuse to aknowledge the contradictions XD"

I dont think they will beat WoW, they said it will be a traditional keybind mmo-style game. the thing about TES is that you are the hero, and the story focuses around you, you get great emersion. if they would make it co-op it would be a totaly different thing and more succesful i think. just my opinon."

ZeniMax always plays a part in the creation of bethesda games, notice their name plastered all over fallout. They know what they're doing. Not only that but WoW is technically the  game to beat in MMOs so that's exactly what they'll be striving to beat."
,opulis,2012-05-17T20:52Z,"Now that everyone is through listing their assumptions, yes piracy is a small reason why this decision was made.

The main reason that drove the decision was to prevent hacks/bots/dupes on Diablo 3. The aforementioned was arguably the #1 complaint about Diablo 2, and Blizzard set out, from square one, to fix that complaint. The first, and probably largest step to securing the servers from these issues was by hiding the server architecture.

Diablo is a client/server based game, like many games today, where a client interfaces with a server to receive the information that it needs for the content of the game. In order to create an offline functionality, they'd have to reproduce, 1-to-1, their server architecture in the game's install files, essentially handing over the blueprints to their security systems to all of the hackers in the world. Obviously, given this information, it would only be a matter of time before the hackers broke the securities and, once again, flooded the land of Sanctuary with duplicated items, hacked items, and spam bots/run bots/mf bots.

All that being said, I hope you and anyone else reading this can see that Online-Only is a good decision, and is not designed as some underhanded scheme to make the paying customers suffer."

,nasouan,2012-05-17T22:16Z,"Most of these posts are below comentary level. However i will try to state some things out to keep you from posting same stupid questions.
Q: Where is the crack?
A: There is no crack yet. Just wait like everyone else
Q:Will there be a crack?
A: YES. But there will be not an ordinary crack. We will have to play in private server, or to start an emulator (start your own server where game progress will be saved)
Q:Really ? How do you know?
A: Yeah, really. Because: 1. I have played diablo3 beta on a cracked server a month ago or so
2. After that i decided to create my own diablo3 beta server. And so i did.
3. I played diablo 3 beta on my own server. So if i could start my own beta server skidrow should definately crack (make a full diablo3 server)
Q:When will the crack released?
A: My advice – dont expect it soon. Cause the game is server sided. That means all drop rates, characters, items and stuff are stored in blizzard server database. So to recreate everything should take a lot of time. The easy part is to launch the game. The tricky part is to make all the features work. As i mentioned before i had my server. And there were a lot of bugs. Some skill animations were missing, some skills were missing, some demons were invisible, the drop rates were bad, was imposible to complete first quest. But all in all i enjoyed to walk around in D3 environment and test my laptop if i could run the game :) "
,bryan2978,2012-05-17T22:32Z,"You guys are a trip.. Every time I need some amusement I just read some comments. You cannot play this illegitimately just yet. Although I'm sure someone is working diligently to come up with a crack and possibly already a server for the pirates.

Yes , it would be bad.

I vowed never to buy a blizzard game ever again.
World of Warcraft was the last.
I enjoyed it in the vanilla years , now they fucked it up.
They're trying to squeeze water from something dry.
World of Warcraft is dry so they're going for the other sources.
Different environment but the same game.
Look how much it resembles World of Warcraft.
Witch Doctor ? Holy Shit! They're stealing aspects from other games because they're not creative anymore.
They're just a bunch of assholes who excel at ripping people off , that's all.
I'm gonna play this game and will not spend a penny.

Keep waiting son, If your waiting for a crack, there's never going to be one. Blizzard put 10% of the game on there servers. So for a hacker to make the game work they would have to program a huge chunk of Data, thats not hacking thats serious programming. BTW the game is Awesome, that best. 

And for everybody else. WAKE UP, they made an ONLINE single player game = YOU CAN'T PLAY IT WITH A CRACK. all the items, money, hero's and drops, sections of maps and some bosses are ALL on the Battle net server and are sent to your PC as on the fly and not saved. At best if someone could get the game to run it will be flawed only allowing you to walk around abit before a crash.

The game can't be cracked because the whole game isn't on the PC. Theres 10%-15% missing and stored on blizzards servers. When Ubi Soft did it, it was done strictly for anti piracy. Blizzard did it to stop cheating and Anit Piracy. 

The reason why I stated this game cannot be cracked is because a chuck of the game is NEVER stored on the owners PC. How can you crack 85% of a game? 

Also I'm a member of TPB, I was only stating this to help other members so they don't get confused and download a virus or waste time waiting for a crack that will never be. Also like I stated, If someone was to get this to run it will never be complete or work right anyways, so why waste time?"

Got something productive to say? Then quit swearing like you're in maximum security prison, and spit it out. Skidrow is one of the best bootleggers out there.

@Bravo

I admire your enthusiasm, but as a pc tech, I must agree that for a game to be cracked, it must be intact. Perhaps someone will make it launch, but there could be anything from broken or missing scripts, missing graphics or sound files, or even a BSOD. disks contain more than just a game. They contain a brilliant symphony of ones and zeros, and EVERY ONE must be there for it to run properly. and since only ONE copy of the missing code is available, and is NEVER on your HDD, the only way to crack it would be to break into the building where the servers are installed and steal them. Not a likely scenario. Which makes me question why this game was ULd in the first place. Sorry, but you need to move on to another game to bootleg."

Eventually it will possibly be cracked but only by a team doing a SHITLOAD of work and incorporating a D3 server emulator complete with the missing portions of the game which are reserved on bnet.

Again, the game is only 85% on your PC, the rest is on the server and is encrypted. So that means emulated server at best which will take a long time. also it will be missing the encypted files meaning some shit will never work right. 

There it is, the truth. So for the assholes that keep posting "" Crack here "" go fuck yourselfs. For the people that will never buy the game and want a free version then wait for a long bit and im sure you will get a choppy D3.

For the people that really want to play D3 for real, Then buy the game ( it's awesome) or wait for a month or two for a choppy crack that may never happen and then buy the game. I don't care either way. The game rocks. Im a true TPB member a like to help when I can.

,TPBWhore,2012-05-23T03:36Z,"THERE IS NO CRACK FOR DIABLO 3 AND NEVER WILL BE YOU CLUELESS NOOBS. The game is online play only. Install keys for other games can be cracked because they offer single player thus the keys are stored within the game's executable or dlls. Since this game, just like WoW, is online ONLY those keys are stored within Blizzard's databases. In other words, the only two ways to obtain a valid working key to play this game on BNET is to either buy the game or access BNET's databases.

The ONLY other alternative to play D3 is to wait on emulated servers to begin appearing.

Now you have the facts spelled out for you in plain English. Asking for or even expecting a crack for an online-only game is like asking for ice water in hell. It's not going to happen."

Game is fully server based so emulating everything is going to take time.We are working on it.
Game will be accessible only as single player and there will be no online features.

More updates regarding Diablo III will be added soon.

All torrents and Youtube videos claiming skidrow/unlocker/keys/offline server are fake.Posting any of these links will be automatically detected as spam and will be deleted.

,adobo76,2012-05-25T00:19Z,I hope you're right cobra_.  I will point out that this would be a very challenging crack to create.  The crack will have to emulate a server.  The experience won't be as good as being on a real server and who is going to fix the bugs and update the emulator.  I really hate Blizzard.  They took my money for Starcraft II.  They took my money for WOW.  In both cases they made the gaming experience suck.  Now they are going to try and force me to buy Diablo III.  I say let's wait it out.  The game is already a year and a half late.  Maybe if I wait another year and a half the game will only be 20 bucks.  Then it might be worth buying....or something better will come out and I will have forgotten about it by then.
,remedy2,2012-05-25T01:10Z,"@sock3rfri - Not sure what you are talking about.  I never said anything about piracy being wrong or right here. All I was saying is despite the crappy DRM Blizzard still set sales records.  All this means is expect to see more of this to come.  

I'm not sure how much data Blizzard is streaming online but if it is a lot then this will be hard to create an emulator.  Further the more this is accepted practice, and the higher bandwidth available to the general public the more data will be held online and future games will be near impossible to emulate.  If not impossible, too time consuming to try.  It will get to the point where games are simply run in a server somewhere and streamed to your PC so games will not be pirateable at all."
,bluegizmo83,2012-05-25T03:00Z,"There most certainly WILL be a crack for this... Its just a matter of WHEN. Yes I understand there will have to be server emulation, but that doesn't make it impossible. Look at WoW, you have free servers for that like Molten-Wow! It CAN and WILL be done for Diablo 3, eventually..."
,dark_illusions,2012-05-25T05:08Z,"yes server emulation can be done but guess what? theres no servers on diablo 3!!!!!! its same as on diablo 2 its single player or u can play online with 3 other people on your game or theirs whatever but theres no servers like on wow or anything so even if theres an emulated server it would be nearly impossibal to make it so u can play with other ppl because there would have to be a emulated network of people or maby a lan network but thats short range so only friends that live by u u could play with the only thing server emulation would do is make u able to play single player.

but outside that the game isnt as good as d2 was u cant farm bosses for yellows so that kills single player for getting sets of gear less u farm the crap outa chapter 4 mobs and hope for yellow and orange drops. u can go back and kill bosses over again in multiplayer but as far as i seen they only drop rares first time u kill them 

so in conclusion its better to buy this game cuz pirateing it it will last till u beat the game and then thats it since theres no real mmo servers with alota ppl on them like wow max is 4 ppl on a game so far that ive seen havent tryed to get 5 in on a game but have had 4 b4 the game stopps putting players in. blizz did a decent job makeing this game pirate proof but it is still possibal to do single player once a server emulation thing gets up but i doubt multiplayer"

,herpafuckinderp,2012-05-26T06:04Z,"@hex

It may be a rumor, but I heard the problem lies in the game having about 10% of the game's data on the BattleNet servers that gets streamed to players' PC's when they connect.  So the problem isn't circumventing the login screen for connecting to the game, but emulation the large chunk of game that exists purely server-side.  If this wasn't the case, then you'd see a crack by now."
,herpafuckinderp,2012-05-26T06:10Z,"For you, and everyone else who keeps pointing to Diablo II, you have to remember; Diablo II was handled in a completely different manner.  Diablo II was a game with online CAPABILITY.  Diablo III is a game that REQUIRES an online connection at all times.  They didn't develop an offline game, but an online single-player game.

They knew that if they made the game with an offline mode, it would get pirated.  So how do you stop that?  You force people to play it on your servers.  And how in the world do you force people to play your game on their servers?  If the data you have installed on your computer isn't enough to play, and you have to connect to their servers to access that missing chunk of data in the game."
,Rick_Terminal5,2012-05-26T06:12Z,"@ hexjoyce - what exactly are you talking about?  StarCraft 2 didn't hold it's *single player* items on a server online.  Until there is a server emulator (like the WoW molten servers) there will be no way to play this even in single player mode.  

Up yours Blizzard; you will not get any of my money unless I can preview the game.  Even then I wouldn't buy it unless I could use it offline - there would be no point, as I use my laptop all over the world, and an internet connection isn't always possible.  Who wants to pay for a game they can't use when they feel like it?!

Please stop! Think for a moment: you have nothing to gain by troubling someone into clicking your links, delivering your trojans and redirecting their browser activity to other websites (probably not yours) for a few minutes, until they decide to format their computers.

IMPORTANT REMINDER: Never click links to Diablo 3 cracks, unless they lead to a TPB.se upload. Never download that torrent unless it has over 1000 seeders and convincing favorable comments below and is posted by a green skull. By the way, I doubt that the real crack will be called ""D3 crack"". More like ""D3 proxy or offline server""."
,fdfdf4343,2012-05-26T14:33Z,"Just a word of warning, a lot of people in diablo 3 are being hacked and it might be unofficial blizzard clients, such as this torrent.

I dont work for blizzard but i just wanted to say that if you download this torrent for what ever reasons, dont use it to login to battle.net with your official wow or diablo accounts.

Antiviruses take time to get keyloggers etc into their database, and a lot of stuff like this gets infected with very fresh keylogger, so no antivirus will be able to detect it for weeks, or months, and you never know what else they have done to it.

If you bought diablo 3 download the official client from blizzard instead so you dont have to worry about being keylogged."

So posting these things, and saying 'wait for a crack' is a scam. There may be an emulator eventually (6-12 months) but no time soon (unless YOU hack the Blizzard servers and get the other 2GB of assets they withheld). This is nothing more than a 8GB waste of time right now. "

He's not lieing you dumb shithead, why do all you dumbasses keep saying Diablo III is like starcraft II, when it's not. Starcraft II was a COMPLETE game only needing an internet connection to combat priacy, there was crack out the same day of the games release because it was complete. Diablo III is MISSING 1+ GB of DATA, its on blizzards servers  and encrypte, again meaning Skidrow and others would have to make a server emulator and then program ALL the missing data, Sounds, Graphics and code. That can't be done for FREE. If you dont beleive me then google it. 

Fuck man, this shit is driving me crazy how many poeple are on here that know NOTHING about programming, just because you can mount an ISO and copy and paste a crack doesn't make some of you know it alls programing experts.

,Mrpepperson,2012-05-28T12:44Z,"about 12 years ago, Blizzard told us. 

  ""Diablo 2 has a completely new code, software, and what have you. It can't be cracked by today's technology.""

  A few weeks later... 

  Diablo 2 was cracked and hundreds of people were downloading it P2P. (Hundreds were a lot by that time, most people weren't hardcore PC ""nerds"" like today.)

  I have no doubt in my mind that this game will either be cracked, hosted on a private server, or have an emulator created for it. (Unless of course, you have to be connected to Blizzard's server and/or database to be able to see creatures spawn.) 

  I don't know much about Diablo 3, considering it doesn't even compare to Diablo 2 by my standards. I don't care to learn more about it or how its coding works. While you're playing Diablo 3, I'll be going through my 15th run of D2.

WTF is your problem, Im a member of TBP and have been for years, WE are suppose to tell members the quality of a movie file and if game torrents don't work. Im NOT telling priacy is bad a you must buy the game FUCKFACE. Im tellinng people that THIS TORRENT DOESNT WORK. This torrent is THE SAME DOWNLOAD client you can get from Blizzard anytime for free (in case tyou didn't know dumbo)

It's people like you confusing people is the reason people are still downloading this torrent. You keep saying wait for a crack. But you keep forgetting that this doesnt need a CRACK it needs a server emulater and the missing files. meaning that later on when the game is emulated it won't be from this torrent. So do something for the TBP community and help out or do you just like calling people names on the internet because of your own social issues?"

Starcraft II had the same encrypted shit, it doesn't had like 1+ GB on the servers, but it had the maps. They extracted the MPQ files and viola, they got the maps. And don't call me a dumb, the LOGIN system is VERY similar to SC II, that was I'm telling. Diablo 3 NOT perfectly the same as it, but it's very similar, I think you can agree in this.

Sorry about the last comment, I was getting slammed by some members and was in a bad mood. You are right about SC II and D3 having the same log in client. but with SC II I always thought the complete game was still on the end user, there was a crack out before the game was even released , you just could'nt save the game, if you remember.

So ya for everything I read, Blizzard kept the hero data, and some creatures, and items on there server so maybe not 1 GB but close. So I'll agree im sure there mught be a crack one day or maybe not, Some MMO's are not crackable because of this. WOW was becasue it's 10 years old and was coded different, so we can agree to disagree,

 But i'll always say this torrent is a bust, 1 it doesn't work and is the same data you can get from blizzard (un altered) and 2 after there is an emulater im sure it will be a complete game with differently coded filess torrent making this torrent  useless and SHIIT."

Depending on how much information Blizzard is keeping on their servers, emulation could take a very long time to create.  You can't just read the information being sent to and from the game, you have to figure out what each bit of information does.  That could take a team of programmers a long time to do.  Now it could be that Blizzard is just sending simplistic data that is easy to read, unencrypted, and easy to figure out. If so we should see an emulator in a little bit.  I doubt it though."
,bravo2011,2012-05-30T06:19Z,"@ volcomsktr4 

There's lots of confusion on this torrent with the comments but the answer is:

YOU CAN INSTALL THE GAME BUT YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT GAME KEY AND A BATTLENET ACCOUNT.

, its the same download client you get from the battlenet web site for FREE (then you buy a key). 

So a server emulater needs to be programmed., the missing files need to hacked from blizzards servers and then decypted, then decompile all the data from this torrent, then program those missing files into the game then compile it into a working program, then re-uploaded it into a DIFFERENT TORRENT, simple enough, so hold tight"
,bravo2011,2012-05-30T06:35Z,"and @ MudaThuka

Hacking into secure encypted sites, isn't easy, (EG online banks) and programming large chunks of missing data from games is also alot of really hard work. If skidrow or others get this to work it would be after countless weeks or months of programming labour for FREE. Most of the time these games just need a very simple NO CD bypass or set of files made to emulate a server connection, which if you know what your doing doesnt take long and is easy. "

I've been asking around, and checking on the net and as far as I can tell, NOBODY is working on this. D3 should have been called D3 Online. It was programmed just like any mondern day MMO, and most of those havent been hacked, WOW was but it's 10 years old. 

Basicly, Blizzard put to much of the game data on thier servers. Thats why you can download this EXACT torrent from them for free. The Files on this torrent are completely useless without the data on Blizzards servers. To all the other haters that keep saying anything can be hacked, not true, most MMO's are'nt because just like D3, the server has all the player data, items, monsters. etc. A hacker would have to get all of that data and have a TEAM of programmers working around the clock for a year, for FREE to get this going. 

So for the other haters, say what you must, but it wasn't my fault blizzard did this and it's not my fault on the amount of effort it would get this to work. 

Again im not sayng buy the game, I don't care,  I was answering questions to people who were asking does this torrent works? (NO IT DOESN't) and if it ever will? (NO IT WON'T)

yes, i know how it is, nowdays i only buy online games (or indies, cause they need support) cause the online service from the original game is a lot better than those ""free""

but diablo 3 they made a check mate to those who wanted the game, because to create a server, even a local one WILL TAKE TIME, is the same of creating a WoW server, since npcs, scripts, itens, itens drop, and everything else is stored server side, they will have to create EVERYTHING. and this will take a lot of time, they can do it, i am sure of it, but no so soon

But it breaks my heart see people labelling others because they don't agree with each other.

Look: I guess as you said, you gonna buy the game right? So, following the logic, you are not the owner of the company who made it. This is correct?

And here comes the 1 million dollars question:

Why people cannot live in peace? Why people do not accept each other the way it is? 

What you did in your message is like the army that crushes a country for some useless reason. In the current situation you behave like US, using words as your weapon to invade Tibet. I hope you meet Buda inside yourself one day.

A can answer that question. Because I live as one with the universe. But can you?

Don't label brother! What you see in me is only a reflection of what you see in yourself. So, if I see light in you is because I see light in me.

And... whatever... I see light everywhere.

And if I don't want to buy a game that is made to play for two weeks maximun, I will not. And if you don't agree with me, no problem, brother, I will keep loving you (as brother, LOL), the same way: unconditionally!

In time: if you are a game buyer, what the hack are you doing here in piratebay?

Before finding the power of the words you must live in the path of truth.

I'm very glad you are enjoying it! It's such an awesome game. 


Torchlight is made by the same people who developed Diablo 1 & II! They were formerly of Blizzard North, until they their studio was shut down. A few of them started Runic Games studio and then created Torchlight. So that's why the game is so damn good! They even have the original Diablo music composer, Matt Uelmen.


Don't forget that Torchlight 2 will come out next month (July 2012). It will have 4 classes, more pets, overland areas with multiple hub towns, a longer campaign, multilayer co-op (LAN and internet), and even mod support!

,axinte,2012-07-01T14:16Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
,senate1,2012-07-01T18:23Z,Ok UMMM...I have a question...if you already have a battle.net accout with an authenticator...cam u download this and register it just like I bought it? Asking because authenticator prevents hacking so...?
,MAA11792,2012-07-02T14:25Z,"Do not bother to download this superb piece of crap. I've followed several users instructions but no matter what I do it simply won't install.

First I tried to rename my folder and then chose the one above it in order to download the game client from Blizzard's webpage and then update the game myself which didn't work.

Second I tried to auto enable Windows second login feature which didn't work either.

Last but not least I tried to download the client and patch/crack/run the server emulator from there which didn't work at all.

To all you Diablo fanboys, don't buy the game.. wait for a crack!"

,buck3th3ad,2012-08-04T22:12Z,@magister19 yes you can download it and no you can't play it offline ... game needs files that are located on blizzard server .... until there is server emulator you won't b able to play it without logging in the battle.net
,magister19,2012-08-08T20:28Z,so what is the way to play it offline? can i download the required files to play offline after i download the game?

Every time i open the setup and hit install it says, ""Could not install.
Invalid installation options. Please Try again."" 
I have tried everything to try and make it install, re-downloading the setup.exe, changing path and  updating it. Any ideas would be helpful, Thanks in advance."
,IMPAQT,2012-09-19T11:06Z,"For all u idiots who cant connect, you have to buy a licence for the game to play it on the official battle.net server. I been playing it for about 4 months now and i have to say it has ruined the diablo franchise. Dont bother buying it or downloading it to play on a pserver when one becomes available, its a total waste of time and a shitty game overall. And all you fanboys out there who wanna try and say im only downing the game cause i suck better check my resume bitches. Battletag: Cuttingedge#1888"
,Valrex,2012-09-22T05:29Z,"IMPAQT speaks 100% truth unfortunately.

I don't know what to say about this game.

Except, don't waste your time.

Fucking Torchlight was better than this money-hungry-repetitive-grind-fest of a failure.

And now instead of PvP update, 100 more ""levels"" to grind through on this piece of shit.

Jesus blizzard, I didn't expect you to ACTUALLY shit in my mouth..."
,OPirateiroBrasil,2012-09-22T22:10Z,"It is obvious it can be cracked,WoW was cracked,and it is a server side game,why Diablo III couldn´t be cracked?are you crazy guys?
soon enough it will be cracked,by server emulation (i think),just wait,or learn programming and do it yourself,simple as that."

,k1nozie,2012-09-24T16:03Z,"Wow, people are still trying to get this game to work? Just buy the game already! And why not just get Torchlight 2? It's really fun and it is also very similar to Diablo 3.
