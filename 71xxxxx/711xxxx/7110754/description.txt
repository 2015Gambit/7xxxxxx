This is not something new. I have just put together different study materials I found through various sources, compiled and compressed them into a single .rar file. The files in The rar archive has many redundancies and duplicates. Don't blame me for that. Its not very convenient for me to search and delete each redundant file. I have made up for the extra space required for the "extra" files by compressing it to about 69 percent of its original size.

It even includes video tutorials and previous years papers.
