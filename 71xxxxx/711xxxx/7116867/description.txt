PARTY time at ManchesterΓÇÖs Apollo Theatre as The newly reformed Nolans performed a faultless set. 

With an enthusiastic audience containing a fair smattering of celebrities such as Beverly Callard (CorrieΓÇÖs Liz McDonald), Gaynor Faye and Kerry Katona, the four sisters delivered ΓÇô and then some. 

They performed most of their new album that contains their hits and some disco and diva anthems. 

ΓÇÿHolding Out For A HeroΓÇÖ started us off and gave the crowd their first view of the all-male dance troupe (well it was billed as The Ultimate GirlΓÇÖs Night Out). 

ΓÇÿItΓÇÖs Raining MenΓÇÖ came next ΓÇô and the hit songs continued. 

The girls had a few costume changes, and by the end they were in the figure-hugging lycra. The first change came after the sixth song; one of the highlights of the show too, the Coleen-led ΓÇÿEternal FlameΓÇÖ. 

Halfway through, each sister had a solo spot, Coleen first, whose ΓÇÿLoose WomenΓÇÖ colleague Denise Welch was also in attendance. 

Then Maureen did a cracking version of Amy WinehouseΓÇÖs ΓÇÿValerieΓÇÖ, Linda sand ΓÇÿMercyΓÇÖ with emotion and Bernie rocked the joint being every inch a rock- chick. 

The girls have certainly improved their stagecraft over the years and they are now seasoned pros; but not so high and mighty as to refuse a young fan a photo. They even invited her onstage to have the picture taken

ΓÇô a gesture that went down well with the audience. 

The excellent party night ended with a rousing version of ΓÇÿI Will SurviveΓÇÖ and everyone was on their feet, dancing and singing to ΓÇÿIΓÇÖm In The Mood For DancingΓÇÖ. 

The show had everything: glitz, glamour, fun, and four gorgeous female singers called Nolan. 

What more could you ask for?
