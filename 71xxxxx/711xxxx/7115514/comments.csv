Not everybody has or wants an iPad, you know :)"

I know VLC plays it just fine, but most digital multimedia players sold can't play mp4's (I expect newer ones will, obviously) and I have not yet found free software to convert media files to DVD-R's that takes mp4. 

Also the new mp4 file size structure fits poorly onto DVD's, which are my main backup medium, whereas the old 700/350/175MB structure fit very well.

Furthermore, since the mp4 format is primarily an iPad format, I just don't understand why the scenes are going that route. I'd have have thought that scenes would want to reach the most number of people.. not just the Apple Fanboys ;)

As I said, I'm not really complaining, and I'll happily take my files as I can get them, but I just don't understand the point of changing a well established format out for some very poorly supported iFormat."

Better quality, can even cut the file size down alot and still beat the old avi files picture quality. All People should know about VLC Player by now, it plays a even Dvd images like iso, img and so on. No other player can beat VLC. oh and THANX EZTV."

You can't just magically install VLC on the millions of standalone DVD players and Digital Media Players that exist in homes all over the planet.

Yes, mp4 is better quality and smaller file size, but it's still inferior to the mkv container which allows for multiple subtitles and multiple soundtracks in the same file... something that the mp4 can not do, to my knowledge.

It is therefore only marginally better, and very poorly supported compared to the AVI :)

Furthermore, I am not complaining about mp4. I do not complain about getting free TV shows online.

I am merely pondering the reasons for the move, because I see absolutely no 'real' benefit to anyone other than iPad owners. ;)"
