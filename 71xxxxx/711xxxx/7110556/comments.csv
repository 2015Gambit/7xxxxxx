,hench7,2012-03-18T21:20Z,Thanks mate
,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-03-21T05:38Z,"First, thanks for this, this is an AWESOME torrent!

...However, the file ""History.and.Lore.The.Field.of.Fire-House.Stark.BLURAY.720p.x264.DTS-TvT.mkv"" cuts off after 22 seconds.  It's the only one that's broken.

Could you re-rip that one and re-up it?  That'd be fantastic!  All the others work like a charm, that's the only one (and it wasn't a bad DL, I deleted it and re-downloaded and it still didn't work).

Again, thanks for this!  Fantastic up!"

,DEVILVSANGEL00,2012-03-22T03:25Z,"This is a great torrent and explains alot about the past of game of thrones as well as the usual extras u see from tv shows,

but as TabascoQuesadilla says History.and.Lore.The.Field.of.Fire-House.Stark.BLURAY.720p.x264.DTS-TvT is the only file not working correctly and needs to be riped again,

apart from that this is a great torrent and defently worth watching before season 2 comes out if u loved season 1 of game of thrones.

hope you enjoy it as much as i did,

thanks for the upload :)"
,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-03-24T20:31Z,"In case anyone's interested, here's how I've organized the History and Lore/Houses on my hard drive - it's more or less chronological, and when it isn't, I've organized it so you get more information with each one, without feeling like you're backtracking too much:

1. The Children of the Forest, the First men, and the Andals
2. The Old Gods and the New
3. The Night's Watch (Night's Watch's perspective)
4. The Order of the Maesters
5. The Age of Heroes
6. Valyria and the Dragons
7. House Targaryen
8. The Field of Fire (Targaryen's perspective)
9. The Field of Fire (Stark's perspective) (broken file)
10. House Stark
11. The Night's Watch (Stark's perspective)
12. House Lannister
13. The Night's Watch (Lannister's perspective)
14. House Arryn
15. Mad King Aerys (Baratheon's perspective)
16. Mad King Aerys (Lannister's perspective)
17. Mad King Aerys (Stark's perspective)
18. House Baratheon
19. Robert's Rebellion (Targaryen's perspective)
20. Robert's Rebellion (Baratheon's perspective)
21. The Sack of King's Landing (Baratheon's perspective)
22. The Sack of King's Landing (Stark's perspective)
23. The Sack of King's Landing (Lannister's perspective)
24. The Sack of King's Landing (Targaryen's perspective)

Again, just in case anyone was interested.  I feel this is the best order to watch them in, but that's just me."
