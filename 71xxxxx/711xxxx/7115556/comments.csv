,southunit,2012-03-20T04:14Z,"@ 6ril
Notes:
READNFO... WELL CAM AUDIO... IS NOT GOOD BUT WILL DO FOR NOW."
,6ril,2012-03-20T06:16Z,"well, i'd still like a second opinion as it's where comments can be helpful..."
,i.heart.me,2012-03-20T09:20Z,"i thought a r5 was an advaced copy from somewhere like a russia?(single source) and so it goes cam, then T/S (two sources hashed together) then R5 then dvd rip. im not being a c*** im just semi curious?"
,coolhanddool,2012-03-20T09:21Z,"Hey 6nl, why dont you just download it and make your own opinion."
,ElLoco,2012-03-20T14:17Z,"the audio is pretty bad, the picture is nice, like a R5... But it is in 4:3 format...im gonna wait"

great service"
,freak6148,2012-03-20T23:01Z,"A-3 Very Poor
V-7 Good Quality, but it is not full screen, it has been cut to 4:3

Could only stand to watch it for a couple minutes as the audio was so bad. Thank I will wait for a better DL. Thanks anyway"
,Creyz1,2012-03-20T23:44Z,"@i.heart.me   Wrong, here's a link

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R5_%28bootleg%29

I must say that 2-3 years ago an R5 rip was pretty much DVD quality, but nowadays most R5's look more like cam quality. 
I guess it just sounds better."
,exarmy28,2012-03-21T00:12Z,yea pretty shitty copy but thanks anyway....any chance of a good copy of sherlock holmes? its been out ages and no good copys on here..
,Bolerophon,2012-03-21T00:22Z,So how is this AC3.. when the soun is from CAM!?.. JESUS.. where's aXXo!
,dayglo666,2012-03-21T02:36Z,not an r5 usual froggie poor quality aint seen a decent up from this guy in a long time
,Heffy001,2012-03-21T08:34Z,"This will tell you all about the different types of formats eg. R5, Cam, DVDR etc

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types"
,i.heart.me,2012-03-21T09:19Z,"thank you Heffy001 Creyz1 for those links, if im honest i probably could have googled it myself, dont get me wrong im not trying to bring quality control into pirated shit, i was bored and waiting for stuff to download and just wondering. As for the A/V. Video is clean probably a 7 and the audio is, as everyone else pointed out about a 4, and it will effect how you enjoy the film."
,coolhanddool,2012-03-21T10:59Z,"I wish a standard could be set and that everyone would be honest enough to use the proper one like this:
1-CAM
2-TS
3-R5
4-R6
5-SCREENER
6-DVDRIP"

I'm sure they spent a fortune collecting this cast, why didn't anyone bother paying the script writer? Worst spy plot ever since XXX. I think the MPAA and Relativity Media owes me money for wasting my time and bandwidth. "
,christoph.thomas,2012-03-21T22:23Z,"@ fantsisam5 - I could not have said it better - and there should be huge fines for making bad movies ... like 1000000$ for each projection where people risk dying out of boredom ! And jail sentences for actors, directors and screenwrites - through them in Swedisch prisons until they make decent movies!!! "

,chrisepsi33,2012-03-27T18:36Z,thanks nice
,tommyhawkster,2012-04-08T07:18Z,"just curious, how does someone get a hold of a good video source and an awful audio source?  Are they not already together when you get the leaked source?  When I rip DVD's I get both audio and video during the process.  Any ideas?"
