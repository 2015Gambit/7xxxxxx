Collect data and enter it in MacFamilyTree on your Mac or MobileFamilyTree on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Genealogy work has never been more convenient and rewarding. MacFamilyTree's intuitive user interface makes the otherwise time-consuming work of entering all information about family members comfortable and purposeful. Whenever you encounter new information, adding it to your data is a breeze.

Built for Mac OS X

MacFamilyTree is not just another cross-platform application written for MS Windows and ported over to Mac OS X. Being developed exclusively for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and Mac OS X 10.7, MacFamilyTree profits from the latest and greatest in Apple's Core Technologies. Many convenience features in MacFamilyTree make heavy use of CoreAnimation to point out important information, create shortcuts for you and just make you feel right at home as a Mac user. The CoreData database technology performs well even when browsing family trees of tens of thousands of entries. And on the more recent Macs with Mac OS X 10.6 or Mac OS X 10.7 installed, MacFamilyTree even runs in 64 Bit, squeezing out that last bit of processing power so you don't have to wait for your Mac to catch up with your own working speed.

14 Years of MacFamilyTree
