I mean, come on, I'm willing to put up with the switch from my preferred .avi's to .mp4's but do we have to change HOW I get the shows too?"
,canagprm,2012-03-20T08:52Z,agree
,zr92,2012-03-20T12:27Z,"Use a torrent client called TIXATI. Reads both torrents and magnets link, exceptionally stable too. Bam! Problem solved. 
But I guess it's easier to just whine and cry like a little b*tch on an unrelated torrent, right? Right? 
STFU. 

Good release btw, thank you. "
,spacetragedy,2012-03-21T13:29Z,fuck lame mp4s
,assfaic,2012-03-21T22:00Z,instead of whining like little bitches just download format factory and convert it to the format you want
,Pyrogoeth,2012-03-22T04:28Z,"You guys realize, this is an AVI and not an MP4 right? So bam the other half of your argument is nil too."
,steezo1986,2012-03-25T00:59Z,"2 things I can't stand, ""Lazy people"" who find it complicated to take ten extra seconds to download a torrent thats as simple as copy and pasting link address or finding a new torrent client... And I can't stand those who make complaints for something given to them for FREE, Christ sake what more do you want it's FREE.... Thanks for the Download!!!! And Thank you for those with common sense!! "
