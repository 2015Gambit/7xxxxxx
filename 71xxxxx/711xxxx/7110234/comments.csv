,RaionTek,2012-03-23T18:35Z,"Hey LuxLOL, is this version's mswsock.dll safe from being blocked by antivirus???? I had a pain with you January 2012 release, which forced me to use my other XP SP3, which so slow in booting.... I hope you pinpoint this annoyance.... I am using a cracked @v@st Internet Security, the one by Loco... if I remember it correctly, it's the one cracked til 2050.... I hope you can take a look with this mess and release something which will be AntiVirus safe.... tnx..... love the job.... except for the mswsock.dll problem"

Can you access to the ISO file from your virtual machine? Looks like the ISO file has been unmounted by your MAC.

@RaionTek
The file ""mswsock.dll2 is a system file you should use a better antivirus program that doesn't make false positive on update system files.
Use another antivirus like AVG it's also a lot better then the one you using now.

,Burton878,2012-03-31T05:40Z,"Hey LuxLOL, nice work, I love it, runs beautifully! Just a couple quick questions: 1) any way I can get the sleep and hibernate functions; and, 2) any way I can install Outlook Express? (the second questions may seem silly, but I still prefer it over all other email clients)
Cheers"
,LuxLOL,2012-03-31T11:15Z,"If you have no hibernate function then you need to install the mainboard driver, if you have a intel mainboard you find the driver here:

Intel速 Chipset Device Software (INF Update Utility)

And the free Outlook Express has been replaced by Microsoft by the free Windows Live Mail and the not free Microsoft Outlook 2010"

Go to the windows update center and install .NET Framework.
.NET Framework is not pre-installed in WinXP i did included a costume All-in-One NET Framework installer in previous BE versions but i removed it again because it could course some problems with new  .NET Framework updates. And a user then would need to reinstall all .NET Framework versions.
So install .NET Framework over the windows update center is the way to do it to avoid any problems.

@chrisb92
Are you sure you have done a format of your hard disk drive before re-installing? other ways you did an upgrade and this you should not do.

@Gh055twr1t3r
Let's see how Win8 will be and then i will see if i do a Win7 or Win8 Black Edition. ;)"
