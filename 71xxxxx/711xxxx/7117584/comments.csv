i know how hard it is to convert them so take your time and thanks in advance..."
,sweet1969,2012-03-25T04:56Z,"This was a bad quality 1080p.  I would go as far as to say many of your 720p videos are better than this.  Can see all sorts of pixels in the dark spots.

I really think you should STOP uploading 720p and ONLY do 1080p for about 2gb each.  

People complain about the size, but it's 2012 now, and people need to realize good quality vids take more than 700mb of space, so they need to bet bigger hard drives or faster internet speeds.  I'm Cambodia with speeds 512k and I have NO complaints about slightly bigger file sizes so the quality is much better.... thx!!"
,laylaw,2012-04-23T10:50Z,@sweet1969 Totally agree: quality over size. Also @YIFY thanks
,koensmurf1997,2012-05-13T19:48Z,Nice thanks i am downloading it now!
,GyrnNEY,2012-06-13T03:21Z,"Video has some pixelation during certain scenes, and audio over-saturates in places.  Vid/Aud = 9/9"
,nfnity,2012-07-09T20:01Z,izzz this safe cause i was emailed a msg from some company after downloading the file... i still have the movie but jus wondering

,LAllen11,2012-08-14T01:18Z,I uploaded this after downloading it from you. It was my first upload ever. A moderator commented on it with a link back to yours. Is it bad form to re-upload an existing torrent? I thought I was being helpful. Thanks. 
,RingoChan,2012-08-17T03:54Z,Got an email from DreamWorks regarding this torrent. Be careful guys.
,nfnity,2012-08-21T16:47Z,"Yea i got an email as well, this isn't a safe file"
