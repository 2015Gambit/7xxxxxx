What do I do?"
,LHRRecon,2012-03-24T04:54Z,"uninstall Photoshop, After Effects and Premiere(if there installed) then rerun the master collection install and only install those. before you do that download flash player. or update it. then replace the  host and .dll files and it will work. same thing happened to me when i first made this if it pops up again repeat. if that doesn't work just click continue then replace the dll files and host and it should bypass the error.

,Noob1985,2012-03-24T17:17Z,"I have another newb question LHRRecon...(Seriously...my newbness knows no bounds!) 

I did what you said and it worked this time!  I've replaced all my 64bit files with the dll files like you told me.

My question is this:  do I also replace the 32bit folders that are just in my regular programs files or do I leave those alone?  I have a 64bit HP TouchSmart...wasn't sure if I change those files too or just leave it alone.  

Thanks!  :D"
,LHRRecon,2012-03-25T22:38Z,if it works then just leave them alone your fine! =)

,marsfx,2012-04-02T06:40Z,"Hey LHR Recon,
 I'm having a real problem getting the 64 bit programs to run.

x86 (32 bit) programs are now running fine!

When I re-install the 64 bit programs, I'm constantly encountering the error about Flash 10 ActiveX not being there!
I downloaded flash 10 with activeX from Adobe.
re-installed and copied all those DLL's again and still cannot get 64 bit programs to run.
Please help!  I have spent 9 hours today trying to get this to work!

,LHRRecon,2012-04-04T06:05Z,"@ marsfx
 Hello, before i turned this into a torrent and uploaded it i customized everything and i re-configured, re-installed several times. anyways to fix this problem just uninstall the active x and re install it, then replace the .dll files and the special active x file if you didn't already do that.

,LHRRecon,2012-04-08T20:41Z,"@claloren
replace the host file again then try it. if that doesn't work replace it again then the dll files. if this still doesn't work then uninstall everything and reinstall.

thanks."
,MikeJr84,2012-04-12T15:57Z,"You are the man LHR Recon!!

Question though....followed your 'step 2' instructions  off of thethingy's cs5.5 comments. Everything works except for X Pro, it says 'error detected....app lib.....Please reinstall'. Pretty new to this so dont rip me a new one of this is a dumb question....is thhis an effect from replacing the 'amtservices.dll'? Whatever it is, do you know of any workaround???

Any advice would be awesome!!"
,LHRRecon,2012-04-13T22:50Z,"@MikeJr84 
and anyone else who is having this or a similar problem. just replace the host file again then reinstall the non working program. then the dll's."

How do I fix this?  I get it when I try to install after effects by itself!"
,Etika,2012-04-21T18:55Z,"I mean, I know you say "" download flash player. or update it. then replace the host and .dll files and it will work.""  But Download Adobe flash?

I don't have the Exit Code 7 problem, it's just this loading problem."
,LHRRecon,2012-04-29T06:07Z,"@Etika 
Everything for installation is in the instructions, the where, how, etc. of the folders. but to fix  your problem with the aftereffects only. is that you can't just install aftereffects only. the is the adobe SUITE is a all or nothing kind of package. if you try it will say it downloaded but you need sertain packages in acrobat x and other programs that are in the suite for the whole thing to work.

,LHRRecon,2012-05-18T01:05Z,"@ Ekulach
Your adding an extra number or something because this key does work and it's the right number so triple check it or just type it in, instead of copy past."

,imidgetman14,2012-05-26T20:32Z,"Hey,
I have everything installed and all .dll files replaced.
I have a 64-bit computer.
The issue is whenever i try to open one of the programs it doesnt open. Nothing happens.
I opened Photoshop and it instantly stopped responding. It gave me an error that said it was caused from temp files.
The error thing only happened once though.
My main issue is that nothing happens when i open the programs.
Any ideas on how to fix this?"
,imidgetman14,2012-05-26T20:46Z,"So now im getting a different problem.
For 32-bit applications i get this error whenever i open them.

The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the application.

It pops up in a little error window before the program can even start.

For 64-bit applications i get this error whenever i open them.

First the program stops responding before anything opens then i get this error report


Files that help describe the problem:
  C:UsersEthanAppDataLocalTempWER714F.tmp.WERInternalMetadata.xml
  C:UsersEthanAppDataLocalTempWERE160.tmp.appcompat.txt
  C:UsersEthanAppDataLocalTempWEREAF3.tmp.mdmp

It one of the windows error report that ask if you want to send it to microsft to find a solution.

I dont understand it so i was wondering if you might know what is happening."
