For the first time ever you can experience both nights of the Wembley concert with this DVD package! This package includes the Friday (In it's whole) and the Saturday concert all remastered. Also includes a bunch of bonus features including the weekend when the concert was held, behind the scenes, and the "Final Tour" documentary. Please check my account for more Queen stuff! ^^
