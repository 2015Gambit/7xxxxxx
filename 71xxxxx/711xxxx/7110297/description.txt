The BBC delves into its archive to celebrate Valentine's day with the best romantic duets 
performed at the BBC over the last fifty years. Whether it is Robbie and Kylie dancing 
together on Top of the Pops or Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge singing into each others 
eyes on the Whistle Test, there is plenty of chemistry. Highlights include Nina and Frederiks 
Baby It's Cold Outside, Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers, Sonny and Cher, Shirley Bassey and 
Neil Diamond, Peaches and Herb, and a rare performance from Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush.
