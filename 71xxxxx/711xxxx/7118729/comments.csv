,Booi3ie,2012-03-27T23:23Z,hey man how do you get itunes movies on here without the drm? i have a ton of movies from itunes and want to share them but idk how you do that. Any help would be awesome thanks.
[T],tr108,2012-03-28T02:17Z,"Booi3ie- my films aren't actually pulled from the iTunes store. I actually rip films from blu-ray discs (or ups from other users here) and encode them as .m4v files. I put iTunes in the header so that peeps know what universe they're meant for.

That said, there *is* a piece of software that can (supposedly, haven't tried it myself) strip the DRM out of iTunes stuff tho, it's called Requiem (https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7070391/)"
,Booi3ie,2012-03-28T08:48Z,Tr - thanks man. I love how you did it iTunes stylee. Saves me the time from using subler. And thanks for the link
