,nas.ebooks,2012-03-20T13:32Z,"Thank you, concilium - this is a very nice listing of Project Gutenberg books, and I am happily downloading at this moment.

to Gwelli: If you click the number to the right of the word ""Files:"" under the header above, it should give you a list of the files in the Torrent, which in this case also includes the book titles.
