,CRCNO1,2012-03-20T10:16Z,I Want AVI not fucking Mp4 file
,MotaRoma,2012-03-21T07:51Z,"CRCNO1, any player that can play .avi files encoded using x264 can also play .mp4 files encoded with x264.  The container format doesn't matter as much as the codec, which is why it specifies the codec, not the file extension, in the title.  But feel free to make more posts showcasing your ignorant sense of entitlement, they amuse me."
