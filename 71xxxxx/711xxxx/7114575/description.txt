I really have no idea if uploading this is illegal but I will take it down if it is. Since Starwave (the CD-ROM) creators went out of business I assume their copyrights are either valid with no interest in defending them or invalid since they are issued to a defunct company.

If any legitimate representative contacts me I will gladly remove this torrent but until then I would like to insure this classic game can continue to make people happy and be backed up through redundancy of downloads. This game was way before its time but still needs a 32-bit operating system. Make a virtual machine if you do not have Windows or are running a 64-bit version. Again, my honest assessment is that by uploading this game I am not harming anyone since the company is out of business. Please let me know otherwise. Thanks and enjoy.
