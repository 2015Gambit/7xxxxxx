Details:

The opening salvo from his major label debut EP, Half Naked & Almost Famous, is locked and loaded with hilarious jabs and raw rhymes announcing the formal arrival of hip hop's new outlaw. Cassie's sultry hook only adds to the intensity as MGK shouts out Jay-Z, Eminem, and Nikki Sixx with equal reverence. "I'm a real rock star," he assures as gunshots blast and his hypnotic verbal violence takes over. It's quite the opening to the five-song collection, painting in blood just how diverse and intricate the rapper is.
