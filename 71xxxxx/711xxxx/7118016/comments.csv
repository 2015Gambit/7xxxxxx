But speaking of the Stern show -- how much more lame can that be? I used to be an avid listener and paid for years of Sirius ... now I don't even want to download it for free :)

I appreciate that you do the breakdown by the way -- it is very helpful to skip right through all that AGT bullshit, or his wife paddling puppies. How much more can he sell out? Where is Artie to laugh at all this gay bullshit?"
