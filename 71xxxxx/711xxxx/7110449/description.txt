Well, what an album! Robert Gordon has always been known for his high musical standards on stage and in the studio. With this new album he is in total control of his craft and demonstrates yet again what a terrific interpreter he is of the musical style addressed here. He possesses one of the Great voices around today and Robert Gordon's new album more than adequately captures the brilliance of his work.
