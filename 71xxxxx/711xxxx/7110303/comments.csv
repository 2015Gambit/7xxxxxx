[T],AncientRome,2012-04-06T02:17Z,"No password is needed, I did not password protect it and I don't recall needing a serial either."
,LuvEvol,2012-06-04T18:09Z,"I read the ReadMe note, and step 5 said ""Copy the cracked content from Skidrow folder to game install dir."" Am I doing it wrong, because it says there's not enough space to copy and paste?"
