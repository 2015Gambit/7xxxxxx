Good evening there

Here it is a new version of Cyberlink PowerDVD 12 Ultra working perfectly fine.
By new,i mean fully functional with all options for BD as well.
This is a fixed version and it is the true ESD full retail version anyway.
Installed and tested over more than 15 different computers already including laptop/notebook as well....
and in each case,all is still working fine.
If you need or are looking for a true 100 % functional version,this is definitively your,now...right now !
No bullshit.No more fake...
Just the best for you now of course.
Special thanks to BetaMaster for his great job on it.
Credit goes to BetaMaster for sharing.
This version is not really fully tweaked but you should not have to register this last one anyway ;)
Hope you will like it so.
Share and seed mates,please !

PS:
you are not allowed to sell,resell,or rent or make any profit with this file anywhere like few stupid
morrons are often doing from "your tube" or other bullshits anyway...
Shame on such stupid guys...
Sharing is universal and must stay such a free act like the love should be... anywhere...
all around the world so...
Love is such gold and sharing is still such an act of love...
Forever to ever...
Never forget that,that's just the way to do it.
And our best wealth...nowhere else than just in our hearts...
And our tears as our gratitude to the grace and love of god...
as the most beautiful river of forgiveness...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Peace and love for/to all
and long life to TPB aswell.
Sharing is our priority...
Because we like you to please.
So what about you ?
...
Enjoy and regards
