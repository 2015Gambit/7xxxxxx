,Swollenfish,2012-03-19T13:15Z,The ear splitting volume of these downloads man. D: I have to put it through an audio filter in VLC just so I won't go deaf. It's high quality but it's pretty loud. :S

,trazer31,2012-04-03T11:02Z,"I know what it's like to upload bro. You do a great job. 
Constructive critisism is important though. Every couple of episodes theres a tiny lag of 1 second that doesnt match the audio. Probably the converter.
I'm seeding though. I'd appreciate it if you would seed this small txt file.
