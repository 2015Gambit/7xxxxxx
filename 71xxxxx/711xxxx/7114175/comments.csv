Almost all files of all types can be played by VLC player which is free

When there is a quality problem use splash lite player which is also free"

My mediaplayer doesn't play the files either! It plays for 3 seconds and freezez..all of the files! 
On the pc thought I can play them fine with VLC.

Fuck man..I wanted to watch this on the tv! "
