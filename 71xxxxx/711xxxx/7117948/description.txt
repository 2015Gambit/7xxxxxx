Ok I know this game is starting to get fairly old but I recently was trying to get a copy again and ran into a few issues that apparently quite a few others have had as well. After messing around for a couple of hours and reading around the net I figured out what was wrong with everyones collection and collected all the proper files. So this is just a re-compilation of most of what's on here + a working v1.4 no-cd patch.



				Thanks goes out to: 

djDEVASTATE - whose iso and patch 1.2 was used in this collection, and whose files made me realize why others didn't work.

Rouge1423 - whose patch 1.4 was used in this collection (btw your no-cd crack is for v1.0 and thats why so many people have problems with yours.)

Inferno - whose members provided the no-cd patch for the 1.4 version (pretty much only working one I found so Thank You)
