,RS2309,2012-03-20T15:20Z,"Just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to ettv as this ULer still does avi thank goodness. All others are doing mp4 which i have to convert to avi to watch it on my tv and it is not as good quality. avi is like digital dvd quality and mp4 is like the old vhs tapes on long play quality. I only get progs from ettv now as the others are not good.
THANKS and please keep upping avi's."
