Minecraft now has a demo. Procrastinating excavators: you no longer have an excuse for skipping our favorite open-world game. Better yet, it has branded cows that Notch made for us. Keep in mind that these animals are specially-programmed to act as voodoo cows: when you punch them, each PC Gamer editor feels a mild thud in their chest. Be gentle.


The demo is generous: every tool, mineral and item is accessible, and you can dig, frolic, and build in your world for 90 minutes before it ΓÇ£locksΓÇ¥ and becomes uneditable. You can create as many new worlds as youΓÇÖd like.  Let us know what youΓÇÖre makingΓÇôsend us a screenshot of your demo world to letters@pcgamer.com.
