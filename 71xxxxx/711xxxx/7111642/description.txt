A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far awayΓÇª

Shot back in 1975 at the original Lucas Studios with a Super-8 camera, these are
the highlights of the original casting auditions from Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher
and Harrison Ford. You'll also see what may have been if Kurt Russell, William
Katt, Linda Purl, Robbie Benson, Cindy Williams, Terri Nunn, Frederic Forrest or
Amy Irving had been cast as our beloved Han Solo or Princess Leia; even more
amazing are the audition scripts that are used for these screen tests as they
include dialogue from the original 'Journal of the Whills' draft.

This DVDr was created from one of two VHS to DVD transfers; one I acquired in a
trade many moons ago (I really forgot where or who it came from - sorry!) the
other from eBay about a year ago. Most VHS versions (I have two VHS versions -
both of lower quality) I have seen are only 30-60 minutes long this version MAY
be the longest cut of the auditions coming in at 90 minutes. This "Angrysun"
version has simply taken the original disc and re-authored it to included a no
frills menu and chapter stops NOTHING fancy but functional.
