,snuffyboots,2012-08-10T10:44Z,I really hope that this copy has awesome audio!  I'm actually (mainly) getting it so I can grab the audio and make my own more complete soundtrack--as these guys keep releasing ones that are woefully missing my favorite instrumentals in the middle of these songs.  Wish me luck... maybe I'll post it on here when I'm all done!
