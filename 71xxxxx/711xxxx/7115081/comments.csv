I don't share files @ web toilets.

Thus, I don't put my torrents up or leave files on web toilets."

,thunderbum,2012-03-20T21:36Z,"@CAPTAIN7SS: Believe it. It is real. I can attest first hand that it's real. I got one of their poison pen notes by one of their admins after I made a pointed comment regarding their so-called prophet. I also read some disgusting crap regarding our Lord, I sent a 'send to an admin' and asked if that was as offensive to them.

Long story short: if you can get your hands (and ears) on a copy of the Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades, it would serve you as a starting point in understanding:

1) what's in the koran 
2) what they think of non-believers, especially jews and christians (hint - descended from apes and swine and suitable for destruction)
3) and after you've learned about the doctrine of lies and half-truths known as taqiya - you'll better understand obama.

Let me know if you need more learning links. All that crapola about 'radicalized' and 'non-radicalized' can be more accurately stated as those who are currently active in following the dictates found in the koran, and those who haven't - yet."
