PLOT:

R. N. Renfield (Nichols), once the slave of Dracula, is now an insane vampire stalking a modern metropolis (Bayou City). Known as "The Bayou City Butcher", he is pursued by Detective Paul Cranston, a driven homicide investigator who always gets his man.

Renfield is also sought by Mina Harker (newcomer Roxy Cook), now also a vampire, and her hybrid-vampire son, Quincy (Tackett). The dark pair are seeking a relic in Renfield's possession: the skull Of Dracula. It is their intent to use the skull to resurrect Dracula and restore the house of Dracula.

It is a game of cat and mouse in which the mad vampire Renfield reveals his ancient past with the Vampire Lord Dracula and battles the forces of darkness and the mortals of Bayou City.
