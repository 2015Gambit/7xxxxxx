Whatever level or porn we are talking about is irrelevant.  It's just pictures and/or video.  Wanna pirate something?  Pirate a gallery app which hides pictures and videos so you can insert your own stuff onto your phone.

And if your argument is ""but I don't know how to..."" then you're simply too stupid to use one of these phones... get your money back or pay someone to do it the right way for you."
