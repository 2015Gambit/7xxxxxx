No need to delete a folder that Ubisoft will be: C :/ Documents and Settings / Administrator / Application Data
   2: Paste the crack in C: Program Files / Ubisoft / Related Designs / ANNO 2070
3-Run the install.bat reloaded, it will copy the folder to C :/ Documents and Settings / Administrator / Application Data / Ubisoft / ANNO 2070/Accounts
4 Copy the UBISOFT there (3rd) and paste it into: C :/ Documents and Settings / Administrator / Application Data (this folder is hidden, ie gotta take the occult)

,jakeweed11,2012-04-25T03:42Z,directions make no sence.

,ClipperCigars,2012-04-27T04:15Z,"No, the directions can't be any clearer and make perfect sense. That you are to fucking stupid to follow simple instructions is your own damn fault. Either learn how to use your brain or go buy the fucking game. "
,safaelsafa,2012-04-27T13:14Z,"All right guys, no panic. Just do these:
1. Copy CRACK folder from the ""image disk""(which you opened with an emulator and installed the game) and paste it to the folder ANNO 2070 in th ""Program Files""
2. Open the CRACK forder there and run install.bat (it will say copied bla bla bla, enter any key to exit)
3. Then just take the other two files from that same CRACK folder: Anno5.exe and solidcore32.dll
4. One page back to the game folder and PASTE them, off course replace them with old ones
5. Run the game and enjoy with login: RELOADED (attention, with CAPSLOCK) password: 1"

hi, I was having the same problem like every body else, ""(no ships for trading)"", and so I started war lol!~ yeah, the girl in the map? one that holds the entire island, attack her ship yard and you'll get your mission completed and get the trading routes too. so build battle ships and attack her island and her ships and best of all, destroy her sea port!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and check for the error if and you'll find it fixed =) and remember after you destroyed her sea port/ship yard, build one of your own on that island!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~ 
that's all
************************************************"
,Bmuzammil,2012-05-08T08:07Z,"hi, I also updated Anno 2070 to Anno.2070.Update.1.01-RELOADED that might also be the cause of me getting error fixed if you just attacked her and didn't find your self fixing the problem just update the game and then attack lol that's how it worked for me, I loaded my previous game in which I had that problem and I do have ships in trading now. build war ships, build one of all types and you'll understand  which ones are doing trade. simple and easy. 500 MB update, download and update now."
