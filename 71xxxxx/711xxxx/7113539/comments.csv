Any suggestion is appreciated. Thanks."
,ColdWolf,2012-03-29T16:14Z,"PowerDVD launches, it even launches in Taskmanager, but then it shuts itself down. If I click on a Bluray movie for it to run, it shows up for 1 second, and it shuts itself down again. Help??"

,GEEK1945,2012-05-27T11:02Z,Great comments track install with REVO if you botch install it will do a complete removal.
,Vulcan219,2012-06-10T20:28Z,"Works Great, thanks scene4all, all anyone just have to do is just follow the directions and make sure you run the ke gen in admin, and it will work fine. I like this version better than 10. has way more control on it. can even zoom the whole movie as well, which is very cool."
,townsvillanpjm,2012-06-14T07:09Z,Thanks for this. I got one problem the MP4 movies dont work right it's not in sync when I play it is there any way I can fix that
,SpiritWolfe,2012-09-02T04:46Z,"@townsvillanpjm

You might want to this:

1. Uninstall
2. RUN A REG CLEANER (www.auslogics.com has a decent free one)
3. Go to CODEC.com and download latest 32 & 64 bit codecs for ALL A/V files and install
4. REBOOT
5. Install K-Lite Codec Mega Pack (both 32 & 64 bit version utilities and CODECS)
6. REBOOT
7. ENJOY!

Now you do not have to install the CODECS. Sometimes, however, there are benefits to installing them. There are also nice benefits for tweaking Windows with them as well. Also, sometimes there might be an updated Cyberlink driver that Cyberlink did not (or forgot to) release in their latest patch.

Either way once you uninstall, REG Clean your registry, REBOOT, reinstall, and REBOOT again... the issue more often times than not will take of itself...

Hope that helps....

Cheers!
