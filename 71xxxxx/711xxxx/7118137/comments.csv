,stvnbchmn,2012-03-20T23:19Z,Is the torrentbox download backup still in the works ?
,Annoyme,2012-03-21T02:45Z,"I actually did a test upload of today's podcast at torrentbox this afternoon. It shows up as uploaded, but it is not in the public listing.

I will try a different site tomorrow.

I will update in tomorrow's torrent if and when I get a secondary backup working."
