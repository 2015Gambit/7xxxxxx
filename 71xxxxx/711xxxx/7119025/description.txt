The debut album from Portland-based dreampop band Blouse.  Featuring pensive lyrics, lush instrumentation, and stellar female vocals, this record is a rare jewel in the seas of overproduced hybrid music.  From the dark almost-grunge haunts of "Into Black" to the 80's new wave/synthpop of "Videotapes," there is something for just about everyone here.  Blouse most recently performed at SXSW to rave reviews.  Two bonus tracks from Blouse's previous EP are also included.
