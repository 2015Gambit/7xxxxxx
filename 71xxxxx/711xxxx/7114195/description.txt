Description
Interpath
This application allows for a remote pathologist to review and navigate high quality images of diagnostic quality using either the cellular network or WIFI networks on the iPhone. Using the application rapid specialist referrals can be made, without access to a computer, a microscope or the original specimen. The pathology image can be reviewed by the pathologist and used to provide a diagnosis used in cancer and other disease treatments.

The user is able to enter the address to their own Aperio Spectrum image server so that the images on their server are then displayed.

Important: This application is intended for use by those who have, or intend to buy a supported image server and requires access to one to work. A example link is provided to the Aperio (CA, USA) image server.
