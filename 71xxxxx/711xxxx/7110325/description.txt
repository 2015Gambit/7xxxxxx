A remarkable ensemble of screen legends, including Gregory Peck, Stacy Keach, Lloyd Bridges, Geraldine Page and Colleen Dewhurst star in one of the most compelling, thoughtful and comprehensive Civil War films ever produced. Based on the works of Pulitzer Prize winner Bruce Catton, "The Blue and the Gray" is recognized for its historic accuracy, dramatic intensity and spectacular battle sequences. Filmed entirely on location in Arkansas with over 160 characters and 6300 extras, this searing saga contains all the stirring conflict and narrative lyricism of such cinematic masterpieces as "Gone With the Wind" and "Glory". The film brilliantly reconstructs an eternally fascinating and controversial era in American history - when families and nation were divided between black and white, North and South and "The Blue and the Gray".
