For 15 years, dynamic web content has been written in a single language: JavaScript. Now, for the first time, programmers have an alternative that doesn't add an extra layer of abstraction or require plugins. CoffeeScript provides all of JavaScript's functionality wrapped in a cleaner, more succinct syntax that encourages use of "the good parts" of the language.

CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development is aimed at programmers who want to get a grip on this new language while improving their understanding of JavaScript. You'll learn about time-saving features like list comprehensions and splats, organize your code into modules with extensible classes, and get your feet wet with jQuery by building a fast-paced word game.

The book also introduces Node.js, the foremost server-side JavaScript environment. Node and CoffeeScript turn out to be a great match, allowing you to develop the front and back ends of a web application in the same language. With CoffeeScript in your toolkit, you can write great code anywhere.
