Body Electric are a great Vancouver band, but do You, by any chance, possess their 2nd album Walking Through Glass (1987)? Do You possess also Vancouver gems like Idle Eyes' albums Love's Imperfection (1986) and Standing at the Edge (1988)? Also, as far as Canadian bands are conserned, I wonder if You have Age of Mirrors - Screenplay (1987).
Thanks again.
Cheers."
