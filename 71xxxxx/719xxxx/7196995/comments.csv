,Violentos,2012-04-19T07:28Z,The audio is unfortunately messed up about halfway through the file. It skips ahead from that point to the end. Unwatchable =(
,Minato9,2012-04-19T07:29Z,Can someone confirm that the sound is in sync?
,Violentos,2012-04-19T07:30Z,"Sorry, please ignore my first comment. That was meant for the original upload. This repack may be fixed."

,Xepher227,2012-04-19T10:38Z,"Excellent quality!!!

thx you again!"
,3v0$.,2012-04-19T11:54Z,"Out of sync audio, should be deleted."
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-19T12:10Z,"ignore 3v he's talking about the original upload
this repack is fixed and audio is in sync all the way
great quality "
,joegreg13,2012-04-19T12:11Z,the video is perfect but this is one of the worst episodes ever. Especially when they become real people. 
,WobSawd,2012-04-19T13:13Z,One of the worst episodes South Park ever made...
,bondjing,2012-04-19T13:16Z,"Works perfect. About 17 minutes in might be the funniest moment I've ever seen on South Park.
Super fucking funny!"
,Kalambaka,2012-04-19T15:50Z,"Out of sync, another lame rip by ASAP"
,BUGAB000,2012-04-19T16:29Z,"Bollocks!!!
The audio is fine! there is nothing wrong with this upload! (thanks eztv for another flawless upload)

However, jesus mother fucking beaver balls sucking christ, it is with regret (as a huge Southpark-fan) that I have to to inform you all that I almost died of boredom watching this episode, if it wasn't for that Challenger shuttle explosion / Indian bus bonanza. Trey Parker and matt Stone outdid themselves in uninspired 端ber-lameness, dafuq!?!? Really, all charm is lost when U have to watch 'live' actors scoring for Razzie awards. Hope next episode will kick some arse again cause this one was as exciting as a wet fart!"
,carrot_muncher,2012-04-19T19:47Z,"Audio is perfect in this on, it's the original that was out of sync...

Thanks for the up EZ."
,orfax,2012-04-19T19:58Z,Worst. Episode. Ever
,qwerty409,2012-04-19T20:19Z,Why is this ep nearly double the usual size?
,qwerty409,2012-04-19T21:29Z,I thought this episode wasn't so bad - except for the portion where the characters are portrayed by real people - please let them never do that again. Mostly I thought it was not the worst ever.
,skod123,2012-04-19T22:35Z,"Thanks.

But this is a really lame episode. Not fun at all."
,subjectiveboredom,2012-04-19T22:51Z,"eztv is the only man you can trust when it comes to south park. thankyou

I have almost died of boredom listening to supposed South Park fans slate another great episode. If you miss the 'good old days' so much then please, do everyone a favour, and go die of boredom watching season 6 on repeat."
,kkeenn123,2012-04-19T23:09Z,"Good quality, SHITTY episode.
I agree with everyone, the live action segment was entirely unnecessary and stupid."
,lostpigeon,2012-04-19T23:23Z,"i read the comments to find the best quality rip... (as always eztv, cheers)... NOT to be told what happens in the episode.  if i wanted to find out before i watched it then i could go to some south park forum or suchlike.  so in the future post those sort of comments elsewhere and not reduce the enjoyment of eztv's excellent work for others...  there's a word in scotland for folk like that...  ""fannies"".  "
,soletar,2012-04-20T00:06Z,"Please Eztv, i know you guys are very busy. I really appreciate your generosity and sacrifice. Please could you upload ""The Apprentice UK, a complete season 1? i know you usually upload single episodes, but i wont mind it all in 1 pack.Thanks in advance"
,Tinny_pb,2012-04-20T01:36Z,"A10 V10. Audio is in sync, picture is perfect (720x404). Thanks EZTV.

File size is probably due to the live action parts, which don't compress as well as animation."

,aapb,2012-04-20T05:12Z,Violentos please get your shitstained facts straight
,joegreg13,2012-04-20T07:20Z,"@lostpigeon 

Really? well here in America we like somebody to tell us if something sucks. I'm guessing you are the only person the planet who actually liked it. We all know this has been the worst season of south park period. This episode just put the dingleberry on top of the pooppile"
,Tinny_pb,2012-04-20T09:26Z,"Joe, season 16 of South Park is clearly making you angry. You should stop watching it. Here are some practical tips for dealing with anger:

,lostpigeon,2012-04-20T10:03Z,"joe, after watching that episode i wouldn't entirely disagree with your comment about it.  but i would have liked to find that out for myself.  "
,dred05,2012-04-20T14:08Z,hmmm audio became out of sync about half way through...
,petden0,2012-04-20T19:20Z,"u r idiots. THE AUDIO IS FINE, this is the repack version, they fixed it. the episode is great. and STOP FUCKING SPOILING IN THE COMMENTS, FUCKING ASSHOLES."
,joegreg13,2012-04-21T01:44Z,"petden0

What are you on I would really would like to know?

Only way you liked that episode is if you like the adult swim original shows "
,joegreg13,2012-04-22T02:56Z,that is fine .I didnt know I had a sis until I was 20. So I don't really care. I hope you enjoy yourself and realize this season is the worst one 
,mocthezuma,2012-04-22T23:32Z,"Why do people post negative comments on a videos they haven't watched?

Are you all retarded?"
,Tinny_pb,2012-04-23T10:16Z,"They've presumably downloaded the old, buggy version of this episode, then come back to TPB and left a comment on the wrong torrent. Same episode, same uploader. It's an easy mistake to make. "
,makisunn,2012-04-24T05:41Z,I got good english subs for this one. http://www.addic7ed.com/original/61748/10

@ makisunn thanks for the subtitle link"
,RJdeWit,2012-04-25T16:47Z,"@Joegreg13:

I beg to differ. This is hardly the worst season. 15 was far worse."

,cormaczoso,2012-04-28T19:31Z,"why is anyone posting comments about the 'quality' of the writing, etc ... are you just stupid? 

this site is to download, hopefully, quality media offerings from people who have taken the time to obtain them and upload them for those of us who are either too lazy, ignorant, or drunk to do it ourselves ... 

don't complain that this is the worst season of south park ... wtf does that have to do with what the uploader is offering? do you think they have something to do with the writing and production of the series? or are you just drunk and stupid and somehow have found your way to this site?

comment on the quality of the media offered and nothing else ... if you want to whine and piss and moan and show your drunken stupidity then feel free to go to one of the many message boards online where all you little fags ('fags' defined as in episode 12, season 13 of south park) can post your whiny pissy comments and argue about which of you douche-bags is more clever (btw the answer is none of the above) ...

go show off your swiss cheese brain somewhere else ... this isn't the place for it douche ...

oh yeah, and thanks eztv for another quality upload ... 

that's something else to do here ... thank the people who taken the time to do this for free and for very very very little thanks ... and then on top of that they have to stomach the dipshits like you joegreg13 ... 

i'm sure you have a boner now since you got to see your name online again ... so take your boner and your inappropriate comments and go pound sand ... that's something even your syphilitic-riddled brain and dick can probably still handle ...
"
,TheoBirch291,2012-04-29T23:15Z,"@joegreg13

Strange that you're getting so riled up about this season not being to you liking. I strongly disagree, in fact I think it's as good as ever. It's getting more consistently smart as time goes on in my opinion,  maybe more toned down, but more subtle. The commentary is spot-on, such as in the episode where the issue of the only two black kids in school pairing up results in some ridiculously politically correct objections. I thought that was inspired writing. "
,Masterteabagger69,2012-05-10T13:59Z,Every shut the hell up South Park is South Park it's like one of the best comedy shows ever made. I dont care if the episodes crap because it's still better than the best episode of the Simpsons or Family guy. Respect my authoritay. Plus all shows have ups and downs.
,BayDwella,2012-05-15T19:18Z,"thanks gr8 quality

to all these obviously talented critics, if you can do better, present it......"
