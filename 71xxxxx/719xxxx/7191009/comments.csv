,lansmart,2012-04-19T06:22Z,download success. game works. however. Trojan found after download. 
,-Udp-,2012-04-21T02:46Z,"No, this is not safe. The trojan found is Chifrax.a, a trojan that has recently been active and is spreading. Kaspersky found it, Zonealarm found it, and Panda found it. Just saying. Download at your own risk, guys. Also, i dont know about the rest of you but last time i checked.. a trojan wasnt a ""common hacking or cracking tool"" for games.. again,..just sayin.."
,sopabad,2012-04-22T18:38Z,"@-Udp-  You're an idiot.  Software that is used to get through security measures in another program will typically set off anti-virus alarms.  The last time I checked; cracks, keygens, and patchers all do this...  it's not going to steal your credit card information or destroy your computer, they allow you to play this amazing game."
,-Udp-,2012-04-23T20:03Z,"@noobaBAD, NO SHIT SHERLOCK, I know certain programs, cracks, lines of code, keygens and patches are used. Thats why I said last time I checked, A TROJAN was not part of these things. L2basics of cracking before you speak. You tell ME what purpose an IMBEDDED TROJAN could have in a small dinky ass game like this. That kind of shit isnt even in MAINSTREAM games. This kind of game shouldve had one install file and something else alongside it to simply bypass shit, certainly not a TROJAN. And of course the trojan installed wont steal my info.. the people that are connecting to my computer from server side will.. since it'd make my computer a host for all my shit to be up for grabs."
,-Udp-,2012-04-23T20:03Z,..And since it sounds like you installed this game... ENJOY THAT SECURITY BREACH :)
,IonAphis,2012-04-25T07:07Z,UDP is going around torrents calling them out to be fakes... Someone works for the RPAA...
,xryanwk,2012-04-25T18:13Z,Worked fine for me.
,MortarFire,2012-04-25T20:32Z,@-Udp- I checked this file on a 2 computers. One with virus protection the other without. BOTH computers work perfectly fine after multiple restarts after installation. It's a false positive. Get over it.
,Hancock79,2012-04-25T22:23Z,@IonAphis which torrents so we can see?
,Reesatta,2012-04-26T19:07Z,What's this !!Mreader.exe file?
,Reesatta,2012-04-26T19:09Z,What is !!Mreader.exe doing?
,froesen2000,2012-04-28T08:38Z,So.....is there a trojan? Two people said they found one. I want to be sure before I try it.
,sin_tax33,2012-04-30T13:27Z,Tried to buy on steam but they region locked me. DRM is forcing me into piracy! ^_^
,GObonzo,2012-04-30T16:02Z,just a fuckin idiot that doesnt kno bout DRM bypass and false positive
,Gir-Ra,2012-05-03T22:06Z,"One SHOULDN'T be forced to bypass DRM, as far as I am concerned. Complaining about it is as justified as can be."
,ontheone,2012-05-09T01:58Z,"I don't know about this one.  As soon as I finished downloading this torrent, Kaspersky jumped all over it with many warnings.  I didn't even touch the files.  I would stay away from this one until we hear more success stories."
,theinvisiblenop,2012-05-19T12:04Z,I'm going to analyze it in a safe environment and report if it's fake or not.
,theinvisiblenop,2012-05-19T13:39Z,"After some quiet simple lookup, here are the two things i found : 
http://isthisfilesafe.org/md5/4C9A8E82A41A41323D941391767F63F7_details.aspx

This is for mmReader.

http://www.isthisfilesafe.com/sha1/2AA45715F18BD12D0BE0D2144C752F4CC989727F_details.aspx
This is for the installer. 

!!Mreader seems to be a simple demo for the fun of it. You don't need it. It's not a virus, just a demo opengl video, oldschool crackers loved to do that ^^.

The installer and the game itself looks clean, I checked network usage before and after, it doesn't change it. So I guess this doesn't have any trojan, just a false alert.

And the game works perfectly well, so all I can say is, go ahead and have fun !"
,Zamzumin,2012-06-01T07:07Z,"Malwarebytes identified TDU500.exe as a malware. Here is the log:

Malwarebytes Anti-Malware 1.61.0.1400
Database version: v2012.05.31.01

C:Program FilesSuperbrothers - Sword & Sworcery EPTDU500.exe (Packer.ModifiedUPX) -> Quarantined and deleted successfully.

Not sure if the file ever ran, but the computer needed to be restarted so that Malwarebytes could quarantine it, so maybe it was running in the background. Anyway, the game runs fine so just delete this file asap and hope for the best."
,sputnikwood,2012-06-03T12:19Z,"from u guys, gonna stay away form this THETA release. ive tried other theta releases and virus scanner always find something."
,UnicornSchlong,2012-06-10T22:01Z,Every THETA has a virus that doesnt do anything.
,darkrisen2,2012-06-18T04:23Z,you must be to THETA cracks udp.....
,Revenir,2012-07-09T00:08Z,"I took a risk and downloaded it... I couldn't get the thing to work. Every time I opened the folder and clicked on the .exe file, explorer.exe would completely freeze and didn't start working again until I deleted the file. I wouldn't trust this file, personally. :/"
,DakotaG,2012-07-13T01:06Z,"works perfectly for me 
thanks"

You obviously do not know what a trojan is.
Try reading about it on wikipedia.

Maybe it's malware free, but your method of checking is worthless.

GREAT MUSIC! +1
great upload!

Love the music given in the folder already! You don't need to look for the Sound Track!"
,Izzotheschizo,2012-08-12T20:10Z,"you need a video card with 128 mb ram to run this, my laptop video has 32 mb ram.  It took forever to load, and it was unplayable."

,FoodoDasSkou,2012-09-06T20:12Z,"Great Torrent, can you do it for Mac? :D"
,dantejean,2012-09-07T04:30Z,"@izzotheschizzo  Are you at all surprised that a modern game, albeit retro and minimal, requires 128 MB of video ram to play?  Would you prefer that game developers only make games that can be played with 32 MB of vram?  What is this, the late nineties? Buy some modern hardware or shut the fuck up. Nobody wants to hear about what games your piece of shit antiquated laptop can or can't run."
