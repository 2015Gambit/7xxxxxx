,hamz22,2012-09-02T14:46Z,works great. big thanks to the uploader for this one. for anyone having trouble getting the game to work. remember to copy the contents of the SKIDROW folder on the iso to the folder where you installed the game. else the game won't run and launch Steam instead.
,littleghostz,2012-09-22T13:24Z,Just use skidrow saints row crack to replace it and it's playable. But i was unable to save the game. Anyone having the same problem?
