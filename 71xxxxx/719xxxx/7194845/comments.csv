,UMPX,2012-04-18T22:54Z,"all of my attempts to install re install and not be on the internet to run this game have failed T_T.....


what am I doing wrong here, Im using the .exe in the program files folder too.

PLZ HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP"
,UMPX,2012-04-18T23:06Z,it will act like its going to work for maybe a split second and the window prompt at the bottom shows like a window is going to open and run the game but then instantly crashes... so Im at a loss
,Zero.G,2012-04-19T03:23Z,Kaspersky detected a trojan.
[H],GrooTheWanderer,2012-04-19T13:07Z,"torrent is clean, checked with sandboxie.Also most of thetas releases get flagged by antivirus because of the tools they use to crack games.
installed and played fine in my pc. If anyone is experiencing problems should look elsewere for the solution, like drivers etc"
,-Udp-,2012-04-21T02:47Z,"No, this is not safe. The trojan found is Chifrax.a, a trojan that has recently been active and is spreading. Kaspersky found it, Zonealarm found it, and Panda found it. Just saying. Download at your own risk, guys. Also, i dont know about the rest of you but last time i checked.. a trojan wasnt a ""common hacking or cracking tool"" for games.. again,..just sayin.."
,MortarFire,2012-04-25T20:33Z,@-Udp- I checked this file on a 2 computers. One with virus protection the other without. BOTH computers work perfectly fine after multiple restarts upon installation. It's a false positive. Get over it.
,Radcobra101,2012-05-11T11:50Z,"-Udp- you've said the same thing on another torrent,

with that said a ""VIP"" and a ""Helper""
both say this is good... i trust them over you."

Malwarebytes Anti-Malware 1.61.0.1400
Database version: v2012.05.31.01

C:Program FilesSuperbrothers - Sword & Sworcery EPTDU500.exe (Packer.ModifiedUPX) -> Quarantined and deleted successfully.

Not sure if the file ever ran, but the computer needed to be restarted so that Malwarebytes could quarantine it, so maybe it was running in the background. Anyway, the game runs fine so just delete this file asap and hope for the best."

You answered your own stupid comment. Read the ""virus"" name.

C:Program FilesSuperbrothers - Sword & Sworcery EPTDU500.exe (Packer.ModifiedUPX) -> Quarantined and deleted successfully.

See the ""Packer.ModifiedUPX?""
That means the program was simply repacked by THETA. Go look up UPX.

Torrent is clean and runs fine.
Thanks ontotita!"
,digriz61,2012-06-19T01:25Z,"Listen, the whole point of comments is to post positive and negative observations about torrents. No need to be pissy because someone's antivirus or malware alerts them, and they post it here. It's not bullshit, Malwarebytes does alert about it, so there's no need to be so goddamned upset about posting information, even if it is a false positive.

Besides, nearly every cracking organization instructs downloaders to simply ignore alerts, so we're expected 100% of the time to not use our own critical thinking and rely blindly on what we're instructed to do by complete strangers. I'm sorry if you're offended, but I'll err on the side of caution and at least CHECK what other people have posted and am appreciative if someone posts, even if it IS a false positive.

I think the pervasive shitty attitude by people being offended when someone posts an alert sucks, and they, themselves, should chill the fuck out. After all, that's what comments are for, an exchange of information."
