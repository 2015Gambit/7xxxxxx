Why does your torrent contain a RAR file?
Video files are not compressible, so there is no point in RARing them."

probably the later since i have been out of the scene for a few years."

There is no need to select individual files when you create a torrent.
You put the files into an appropriately named folder, and then use your bit torrent client to create a torrent of the folder."
