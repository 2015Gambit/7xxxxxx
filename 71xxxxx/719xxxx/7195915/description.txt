This self-teach, interactive, multimedia CD-ROM contains comprehensive lessons 

covering the UK IMC Rating ground and flight training syllabi. The scope of the 

course is vast, enabling you to prepare for the ground examination and practical 

flying test for the IMC Rating more thoroughly, effectively and enjoyably than is 

possible using traditional study methods. As a General Aviation pilot with a 

current IMC Rating (IMC stands for Instrument Meteorological Conditions), you will 

possess the skills and qualification to fly your aircraft by sole reference to 

instruments, and be qualified to fly in a wider range of meteorological conditions 

than the pilot who holds just the basic PPL. For instance, outside controlled 

airspace, and in both Class D and E Airspace, the IMC Rating will permit you to 

fly out of sight of the surface, in cloud, and to take off in reduced visibility, 

and land from an Instrument Approach Procedure.
