DMXCrew present - jean michel jarre essentials and rarities

The old enmity between Jarre & Francis Dreyfus has for decades been settled and returned to the old Jean Michel Label Disques Dreyfus.

One CD contains fifteen restored and remastered versions of his most important pieces such as "Oxigene 4" and "Magnetique Fields 1" and the other is filled with sixteen rarities from his early phase, which could be heard in part to previously available only on limited edition vinyl.

There is, therefore, to discover a lot - new sound experiences and not yet well known songs!
