,nosnavis,2012-04-20T21:05Z,"Thank you. 
By the way, whay a shitty security system they have in nick."
,philip1201,2012-04-21T12:56Z,"If there are any other idiots like me around, just FYI this is not the entire episode, just a mid-episode spoiler."
,jade007,2012-04-21T17:52Z,"yeah, and when's the actual episode due????"
,Sogarr,2012-04-21T18:06Z,The actual episode is due later today. If even says the air date in the torrent description. 
,rjcripe,2012-04-21T20:16Z,"Aww, MKV? Why? Me so sad... I can't stand not being able to watch shows via my HD plasma and the files have to be AVI to work on my 360. Oh well, the episode will have it's ""official"" versions  (and by ""official"" I of course mean copies ripped directly from their original airing) are already being uploaded.

Also, on a related side (and important) note, it would be really great if, in the future, you could try clarifying whatever filetype you've used by including the relevant info in the title/description/(whatever else you prefer).

It's just a bummer to wait a half hour for the episode to download only to see it's incompatible. It happens a lot with new torrents with have high leech counts. This is especially when you consider that, thanks to TPB's new magnet policy, you can't check the torrent's content nor filetypes as you add the .torrent to your client instead having to wait until a sizable chunk's been downloaded. And I don't know about you but I tend to get distracted and forget to check until the completed torrent notification pops up in my lower right toolbar, causing me to go back to find a more compatible version to download (which, as with any new torrent, can take a long time).

It would be super awesome... just consider it. It's an easy change to make and would help many people besides (and in addition to) me."

Files: 1 
Click on that, and it will reveal the files in the torrent along with format they're in. 

@SNDSfag
lol. I thought that was revealed in trailers? "
,Jerryified,2012-05-05T09:01Z,Can you please add the full episode like you did for the others? I love your torrents because there are no watermarks with Nick on it or even commercials! Everyone else's have a watermark with Nick on it and ads advertising the show which I don't like that much.
