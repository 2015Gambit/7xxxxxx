,bubbanuggzz,2012-04-18T09:25Z,thanx for the up.the show is ok but they really need to bring back Destination Truth...its sssoooo much better
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T09:34Z,"im let down in this one as the freeze man is nothing
new and been on many other shows

they could of done another ghost or ufo

story

this show is different though they debunking
youtube said to be real clips
and in some cases get their own weird ufos
or ghosts while debunking 

destin truth is better then most shows on para
cos they do a real investigation using all the tools
unlike so many clone and non clone TAP shows"

although the GA step it up half the program is
them fooling about.. so although its turns on the girl
fans.. doesnt do much for me :))"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-04-18T12:20Z,"i think GA do a great job because of their confrontational methods,but i do agree that they spend too much time on the ""history"" part of the show just goofing off.as far as TAPS goes....havent been a fan since the second season,plus they've been caught faking evidence at live events & half their evp's dont sound anything close to what they say they do"
