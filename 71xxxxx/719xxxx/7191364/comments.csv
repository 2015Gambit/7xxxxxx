,Tgod420,2012-04-17T16:17Z,"You got full Coachella? Can't seem to find anywhere , please!"
,coppsta,2012-04-17T18:42Z,has this got the tupac hologram in it??
,JayMonsta,2012-04-18T03:14Z,Please seed it im putting up the Dr. Dre one and I have to stop seeding it I will seed when I put up Dr. Dre and Bon Iver and a few other.
,tbrownies,2012-04-18T04:22Z,to be clear this IS NOT THE ENTIRE WEEKEND OF COACHELLA.  this is one set of some dude called THE WEEKEND.  all 3 gigs are one single act.  false boner for sure.
,JayMonsta,2012-04-18T09:23Z,Oh sorry to anyone that got confused why can't we edit descriptions anymore? And it is spelled Weeknd not weekend. And I will upload Dre and Snoop right now and then I will go from there I recorded a total of 13 shows.
