QM 06 - Tetryons [Matter]

The equilateral TETRAHEDRAL geometry behind MATTER in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Advancing the equilateral geometries of 2D mass-ENERGY into a 3D Tetrahedral geometry provides the foundational geometry of Matter as it pertains to all Quantum Mechanical processes and particles is revealed.

Revealing the 3 types of Matter quanta and their EM standing wave geometries, a number of scientific mysteries surrounding the definition of mass & Matter are finally resolved for the first time in recorded history.

The sixth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as a foundation for the definition of mass & Matter in the Sciences of the new millennia.
