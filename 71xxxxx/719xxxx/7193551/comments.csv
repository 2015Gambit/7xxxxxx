Took me 1 hour.. now im a seed"
,THESKITZ,2012-04-19T19:56Z,"I downloaded this with no issues. It downloaded very quickly. Unfortunately I am having a great deal of trouble trying to play this movie, for some odd reason. When I try to play it, it doesnt play. It just opens media player and the screen stays black and stays frozen at zero seconds. There is no audio either. Does anyone know what is wrong. I have the mkv codecs and all the necessary audio codecs. This isnt the first time this happened either. DFor some reason this happens every now and then. I will download an MKV Bluray rip from piratebay and the file will do this same exact thing to me. If anyone can help me, it would be greatly appreciated if you can help solve my issue."
