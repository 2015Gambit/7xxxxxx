[V],psspss,2012-04-18T07:50Z,"good stuff you didnt forget it was on

i like this show.. even if the debunking at times
is bad.. like the spider in the web for a ghost
when they have a video photo expert lol


and of course relying on a stupid voice lie detector which has been debunked on the web
and the uni prof who debunked it as 
not reliable had to remove his anaylsis 
or be sued by israel lol"

[V],psspss,2012-04-18T07:51Z,"is this season 3? as tvrage lists it as episode 14 season 2.. technically I guess its been a long break and seasons of the year have changed so a new
season seems plausible"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-18T07:51Z,I don't wanna hear any bullshit about which season this is.  5 months since the last aired episode is a new damn season to me. Don't like it? Rename the thing yourself when it downloads.
,loredanaella90,2012-04-18T07:53Z,"It's no the best show out there, but it's highly entertaining if you ignore the minor flaws.

Thanks for the up!"
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T07:56Z,i added to demon for you.. more will start to connect soon
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T07:58Z,"lol tne settle down no ones complaining..
I agree with you

i think syfy who produce if they call it S02E14
or S03E01 thats the name to use
else it gets messy later one"
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T08:07Z,"well reading this on syfy its a new season

===

It Is Real - Fact or Faked. Ben Hansen talks about what to expect in the new season of Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files, premiering Tuesday April 17 at 9/8"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-18T08:27Z,"my first comment was said before seeing any other comment. hell this torrent was posted for only a few minutes and there were already a few comments. what i said wasn't directed to kole or psspss, just a heads up that there's conflict of listing for season/episode.

very confusing syfy can be about their seasons. half of the tv show guide sites are saying it's a new season and the other half are saying it's still season 2.  the guide on the hd box does say it's S02E13 so i guess that's technically what it should be and next week will be released as S02E14."
,pploco12,2012-04-18T08:43Z,thanx 4 the up
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-18T08:53Z,"k so now scene is saying they're gonna go with s03e01 as well

HAH

guess they were going off the same logic as me - previous episode was 19 weeks ago - the past seasons were only 12 eps -  time for a new season

next week will not be S02E14 but S03E02

i just love when there's conflict of listings like this, how about you?"
,leander3932,2012-04-18T09:14Z,"t and n, take it easy. geezzzzzzzzzzze. just a torrent, take a valium. lol"
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T09:39Z,"they dropped the ball doing mr freeze in this one
(its so old news and been on many other shows
not just usa but also uk shows)

when a good ufo or ghost you tube video to prove
or debunk would of been heaps better

at least they doing one ghost one in it"
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T09:42Z,"its funny though that not even the commerical sites can get their own naming right..

ive seen a mess on many streaming sites with the name and orders... like on screen it says episode 1 season 1 but the file name says like season 2 episode 1.. I wouldnt be surprised if the host comment about it being a new season is wrong too and really they going to call it season 2 after all LOL
