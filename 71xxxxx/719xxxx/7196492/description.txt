Review by Rádio Universitária do Minho's Sérgio Xavier,
from the artist's official web site:

"The final phase of 2008 brought us one more wonderful
album. The Partisan Seed, Filipe Miranda's most personal
project, is an artistic compromise to sincerity and, above
all, with great quality. An acoustic base that sometimes
takes us to the most melancholic folk, but on contours and
silhouettes with exotic fragrances, influenced by the
Mediterranean feeling.

Lyrically rich, Filipe Miranda is inspired by literature,
dreams, religion and the reality surrounding him. It's a
record made of simple songs, and using Filipe's own words,
'songs with subtle messages, like the words of a muezzin
praying very softly'. An enchanted smoothness that requires
silence and care. The gods don't sing much ('if you know
the gods who made all the laws / ask them to sing a little
bit more', in Sound, We Make Sound). But we'll always have
the angels."

Second free album from this Portuguese act. Downloaded from
the artist's Bandcamp store, including front cover, ID3
tags and file names cleaned up, and everything packed comme
il faut. No reencoding, of course.
