Hailing from South Wales, UK, The Dirty Youth are a female fronted quintet setting their sights on world domination. Not nestling in to one specific genre is their gift, as they blend rock anthems with metal riffs and a punk attitude.

The Dirty Youth released their debut album ΓÇÿRed Light FixΓÇÖ in late 2011 via Universal.
