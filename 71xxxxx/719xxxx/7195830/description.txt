The living dead have overrun rural Texas! Four gritty Texans have survived the initial onslaught and have banded together to take on the Zombie Horde. Lead their struggle to survive!

Zed, a swaggering Texas Cowboy, is deadly accurate with weapons such as his .270 caliber deer hunting rifle, but has a poor rate of fire since he refuses to put out his cigarette even during the Zombie Necropalypse.

Candi has poor accuracy and slow reload time, but she is very pretty.

Toby has average accuracy and reload time, but has a very high rate of fire. He reasons that the solution to the rise of the walking dead is simply a matter of putting enough lead in the air.

Oma is the deadliest of the survivors. She's a grandmother of eight and a great-grandmother of four. She has nearly perfect accuracy and good reload time, having lived in Texas all of her life. She's seen worse than "this whole livin' dead thing" and she knows everything will turn out fine in the end.

Guide the survivors to scavenge the wreckage of the town by day for additional resources such as guns or bombs, or instead spend daylight hours improving your survivors' defensive positions. But when the sun goes down the Horde awakes, so at night there is only ΓÇª Zombie Defense!
