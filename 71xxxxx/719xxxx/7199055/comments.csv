My Droid X2 is connected wireless, I checked ""allow 3rd party"" , all the obvious ""noob"" errors. Seems to happen most often w/HD titles, it will DL about half and then the DL fails or just crashes, taking me back to my app menu. A couple say ""sd card not detected"" (I have an 8 GB installed} Cheers"
