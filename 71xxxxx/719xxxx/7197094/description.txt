Philosophical Investigations is one of the most influential works by the 20th-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. In it, Wittgenstein discusses numerous problems and puzzles in the fields of semantics, logic, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of psychology, philosophy of action, and the philosophy of mind. He puts forth the view that conceptual confusions surrounding language use are at the root of most philosophical problems, contradicting or discarding much of that which was argued in his earlier work, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.

Product Description
The Routledge Philosophy GuideBooks painlessly introduce students to the classic works of philosophy. Each GuideBook considers a major philosopher and a key area of their philosophy by focusing on an important text - situating the philosopher and the work in an historical context, considering the text in question and assessing the philosopher's contribution to contemporary thought. Wittgenstein is the most influential twentieth century philosopher in the English-speaking world. In the Philosophical Investigations, his most important work, he introduces the famous "private language argument" which changed the whole philosophical view of language. Wittgenstein and the Philosophical Investigations introduces and assesses: * Wittgenstein's life, and its connection with his thought * the text of the Philosophical Investigations * the importance of Wittgenstein's work to contemporary philosophy.
