Any ideas or help with this please?"

When I play it in VLC player (2.01) and try skipping from the beginning to the middle it hangs for a long while before resuming playback. Worse still, if you try to skip to the end it just crashes period. 

As skweets pointed out I think the end got cut off or garbled somehow so it's unplayable. It's a shame really cuz the A/V quality for the rest of the movie looks very good."
