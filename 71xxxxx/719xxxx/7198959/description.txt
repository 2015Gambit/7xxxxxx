Mormonism and the Book of Mormon - a Collection:

With Romney as the most likely GOP choice in the next US presidential election, Mormonism came under the spotlight. It is interesting to note that Mormonism as a Christian sect started in 1830; they have their own Prophet and Bible (Book of Mormon). Myths and miracles play important role in shaping their doctrines.
