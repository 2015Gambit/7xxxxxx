some comments on Kerrys interview I found on website. I leave you to decide if they valid comments :)

====

It was annoying to watch and listen to two adults communicate in such an immature manner. The argument seems invalid on both sides, each is assuming there is only one race of alien and they are either good or evil? What, like all humans are good or evil? That is quite an assumption and I think that people having both good and bad experiences with these beings speaks volumes that we﻿ cannot generalize what may be many races and individual personalities, if that even sociologically applies to them.

Steven appears highly informed, intelligent and extremely knowledgeable in his area, Kamelot comes across as just hacks trying to compete in the same﻿ space.

In my opinion Project﻿ Camelot ruined this interview by asking the same question over, and over, and over again. Waste

That Kerry woman does my head in. Don't need to raise your voice louder to be heard luv!!!!! Thats what the mics there for...These amateur journos/interviewers/filmakers whatever they like to﻿ call themselves really do a disservice to some of their guests. Love the passion Dr Greer!!!!!!!

[V],psspss,2012-04-20T14:42Z,"website greer talks about (in radio talk)
http://www.theorionproject.org/en/energy_solutions.html

and that better solar cells tech has been buried
from general public..

which makes sense.. I think those mars rovers must have better cells then we know about
since they lasted so long even in a hostile environment"
,metalcore.,2012-04-21T15:20Z,greer is both a hack and fraud.
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T11:21Z,"yeh ive heard some say that and also that hes
a gov disinnformation dude. lol

but alot of what he says rings true.. espc about
rich and oil coys buying up alternative energy
projects and burying them

thats what happened to the EV1 after all
it was just to good and it wasnt even using
the best batteries

have a watch of the docu = who killed the electric car.. your see a intervieew with a guy that
invented a battery that was heaps more efficient and it got buried in a unhanded way"
[V],psspss,2012-04-22T14:00Z,"looks like one video truth got the date wrong in avi
should 2007.. seems 2011 is when some ripped it to the web

hmm i must admit in that one he did sound like a nut job.. talking about out of body stuff and
his past so I dont know..
about him what to believe
hes certainly able to speak well and
without using notes and spits out all this
stuff like its well known to him"
,pharkit,2012-07-02T18:16Z,"Regarding your comments about good/bad ETs you have to understand there is a MASSIVE push by the intelligence community to SCARE the public about ETs. Alien ""abductions"" so-called cattle mutilations are all HUMAN activities. Dr. Greer's view, which makes perfect logical sense, is that no civilization capable of interstellar travel would still be locked in the sort of self-destructive paradigm that humans are in. Yes, we have lots of really bad sick people here on Earth and No, we aren't traveling to other star-systems.. make sense? It takes a LOT of spiritual maturity to get to that stage. Regarding out-of-body experiences I guess I must be a nut-job too because I've had plenty of them. :-)"
