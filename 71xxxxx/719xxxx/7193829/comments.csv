,maxd1978,2012-04-19T12:41Z,"According to the Holy Quran, the holy Prophet Mohammed who was 53 when he married a 6 year old girl by name Aisha and had sex with her at the age of nine. I don't mean to sound offensive or disrespectful but wasn't that child abuse? How could a 56 year old man have sex with a 9 year old girl?

The Holy Quran forbids pornography, but is quite fine with sexual abuse against children."

but SINCE I'm here, lol, I just want to answer maxd: the story you mentioned, is not from the Quran. and if you do some research, history experts have proven otherwise, that Aisha was atleast 18 to 21 when she got married to the prophet, peace be upon him! I'm not starting an argument, but you seem like you're interested in the story, so I'm telling you to read more about it."

They 1. won't come searching for porn and post comments on it declaring themselves as muslims.

and 2. STOP MAKING Muslims look like fucking idiots you jerk. I'm not muslim or even asian, but I still completely despise hateful garbage like you.

,Yamcha67,2012-05-09T21:48Z,"I'm surprised that we have a religious discussion going on around a porn video.. But I must say that I see a lot people critiquing those who follow a certain religion & prophets.. I think what you fools fail to realize is that the fundamental teachings of Islam, Christianity & Judaism are the same..

In fact If you were to say that Islam, Christianity or Judaism are evil and you belong to any one of these three faiths then It's as if you are putting down your own religion..

Personally I'm a Muslim, by no means a good Muslim.. Thats essentially why I'm here but I'm also young so I'm naturally inclined to watch porn..

But I see everyone talking about Prophet Jesus who I have great respect for, but It's a bit ironic that while people do revere him, not many people follow his own teachings..

Things we know about Prophet Jesus.
- He prayed with his face on the ground just as Muslims do.
- Jesus kept beard just as Muslims do.
- Jesus did not touch women outside his own family, Just as Muslims do..
- Jesus never got intoxicated just as Muslims don't
- We know Jesus would fast for about a month just as Muslims do..
- We know Jesus never ate swine or pig just like Muslims don't eat pork..
- We also know that Mary mother of Jesus covered her hair and body just as Muslims do..

So really I just find it funny that while you guys may claim to love Jesus pretty much all Non-Muslims fail to follow any of his teachings.. "
