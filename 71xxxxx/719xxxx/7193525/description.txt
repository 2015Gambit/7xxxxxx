Greatest Hits III is a compilation album by English rock band Queen. It is a compilation of latter-day songs, the band members' solo hits and the band's collaborations with other artists (hence the album's credit to "Queen+"). It was released on November 8, 1999. Despite being a greatest hits compilation, the first two tracks actually made a debut on this album, although these are only new versions of classic Queen songs (a number of such albums have typically included at least one new track to help drive sales).
