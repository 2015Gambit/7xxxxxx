"In 1990, to protect his fragile mother from a fatal shock after a long coma, a young man must keep her from learning that her beloved nation of East Germany as she knew it has disappeared." (source: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301357/)

- Full DVD of the film as sourced from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4018444/Good_Bye_Lenin_Full_DVD
- Spanish audio dropped
- English subtitles added (SRT, not burned in), sourced from http://subscene.com/english/good-bye-lenin/subtitle-104480.aspx, -14500ms delay added for sync

Converted using Handbrake's "High Profile" preset. 1.5Gb so I'm guessing this is high quality SD, definitely not HD.
