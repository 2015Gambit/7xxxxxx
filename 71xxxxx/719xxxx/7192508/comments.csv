[V],globeplus,2012-04-17T16:01Z,"Hi ... after Glomulator , Glomulator Plus , Glomulator Gold , Glomulator Gold Plus , Glomulator Diamond and Glomulator Topazio , now it is a new version more refinated than ever , the Glomulator RUBY that it is available by April 17th 2012 , this adventure started few years ago when i found out that was complicate have a general use of my downloaded emulated games systems , with the emulators disperse and the games for each game system tough to remember where they was , even if i joined and do carefull work with the emulated games systems , they was too many and sometimes tough to organize , it was then after this constant inconveniences that i decided to created a tool that taked close 8 weeks work , the Glomulator with the best emulated games systems available on the PC easily available from a enjoyable interface menu and with extra tools like the searcher to get games fast for any of the available games systems or the cheater to help to complete that old games systems enjoyable games that are tough to complete and we really like it to go progressing on the games or the recorder to have for fun our great gameplay on the games recorded for the posteority and so on , the GLOMULATOR it is a complete free state of mind when we are talking about emulation on the PC , where everything makes sense and it is easily accesible for any of the best emulated games systems that can be played on the PC ... simply adorable ...

I recommend to all the users to start reading the First Time Users.txt available at all the sections and loose the necessary time to understand and have the emulators ready before start playing , i think an hour or two can be enough and for the expert users not even that time , remember that when ready , you got available on your computer the ultimate emulation tool for the PC and anything relationated to emulated games systems for the PC have a place to go ...

enjoy and happy gaming ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-04-17T16:09Z,"To pyhunter101 : come on , you know very well specially for the PC games that false positives can be detected by the antivirus programs , any special worked executable can get get a risk of a false positive but everybody knows that they are innofensive to the computer but because the little strange appearence of the executables or dlls the antivirus can suspect from virus files , what you have to do is disable the antivirus if you really trust on the executable that you want to run , that´s it and happy gaming , this file is free of virus no doubt and it is the antivirus programs that can implicate with the little different structure of the executables or dlls but absolute innofensives to the computer ..."

,pyhunter101,2012-04-17T17:47Z,Didn't think it was the antivirus.I will try it without and get back to you.Thanks for help.
,pyhunter101,2012-04-17T17:54Z,"I'ts not an antivirus problem.I have turned it off.It says ""Created with unlicensed Compiler"". Then underneath ""You may NOT distribute the invisible EXE with the free version of the compiler."

[V],globeplus,2012-04-17T18:35Z,"To pyhunter101 : what exact executable and what exact file you are talking about ? i don´t have any indication in all the work about any executable that can cause a problem like that , explain better to see if i find a solution to the situation ."

[V],globeplus,2012-04-18T01:06Z,"To saiko222 : sorry but bug detected on 2533 version of the emulator , please do the next thing and trust me  : use the internet shortcut for the Automated Jpcsp builds on the emulator folder and download the 2536 version , after download and make the extraction do the next thing : copy all the folder folders and files in 2536 and confirm the overwrite on the current 2533 version on the RUBY , this will correct the bug and you can start the emulator with the starter.exe independtly of what version of the emulator is beeing used , this bug was completly ununexpected but easily corrected , of course don´t forget to install the help exes on the left button of the game system ...

Sorry for the inconvenience and happy gaming ... "
[V],globeplus,2012-04-18T01:18Z,"Hi again and this is a complementary information about the before comment : i don´t recommend the 2534 or 2535 versions because the bug on the 2533 was corrected on the 2536 , so the ideal is to download the 2536 and overwrite on the PSP RUBY folder , i already did it and tested and 100% approved this move ... happy gaming .

,pyhunter101,2012-04-18T11:16Z,"Globe, I have now re-downloaded and unpacked with the antivirus off.I get the same error when running the Easydosbox.exe. I have tried every exe (game folders) and get the same. The only exe file that doesn't show this error is the dosbox.exe in the cheater folder.I've tried xp and win7."
,pyhunter101,2012-04-18T11:24Z,"Globe, when I run the Easydosbox.exe it runs ok.I get the error when I select a game in the dosbox menu.I have re-downloaded and unpacked with antivirus off and tried xp and win7 with same results."
[V],globeplus,2012-04-18T20:14Z,"To pyhunter101 : do the next thing to run the games : open the dosbox games folder , choose a game then run the DosBox 1024x768 (noconsole) , if still problems drag and drop possible games bats or executables on the dosbox.exe of the game you are trying to run ."
,pyhunter101,2012-04-19T18:36Z,"Globe, thanks for your help but I had already tried running the games out of the folders and the drag and drop start.bat doesn't work either.I thought it was just me but if you look on the Easydosbox comments other people are having the same problem."
