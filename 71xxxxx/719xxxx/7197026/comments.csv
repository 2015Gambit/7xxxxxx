polisdavid is one of the most prolific uploaders on this site. I've never had any problems with any of his torrents. Are you 100% sure your issue was related to a torrent from him?"
,socalterrorist,2012-07-18T02:32Z,"polisdavid, I have enjoyed many of your quality uploads, is there any way you can get a copy of My Living Desktop. This great screensaver app is nowhere on the web. Either way, thanks for the other ups!"

You are the best.
