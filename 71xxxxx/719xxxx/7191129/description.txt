It's a bit late and not HD but the only rip of sky f1 that I could find, since it was perverse to get, I wanted to share here (PS! I don't do any ripping, just sharing this one). No offence, footy - we love your fast uploads as we do next weekend as well. But for me, having seen both the BBC and now the SKY broadcasts, I must say I enjoyed SKY F1 many times more than BBC with Coulthard, Humphrey and Jordan. The post race analysis and all the broadcast commentary and interfaced overview is just so much better. After watching them, It suddenly felt like BBC wasn't talking about much anything this weekend, just joking around. Not all that bad though. Just a bit different styles and different notions in case of race commentary.

Still, for an F1 fan, I really do recommend watching this one as well, after all it was a fabulous race hence why not watch it again.
