I just hated having to see him every round last year. Besides, Martin Brundle is THE best for commentary, and Crofty is great as well. Plus Ted Kravitz is the best pitlane reporter around. Basically, all the good talent from BBC went over to Sky (Okay, okay, I do actually like Jake Humphrey, he's a good host)."

But, no Martin Brundle anymore.

And anything without Martin Brundle isn't worth watching

Sky ftw"
