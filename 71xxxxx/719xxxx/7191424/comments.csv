I AM SO SICK OF GETTING YOUR TWISTED PERVERTED SEXUAL PREFERENCES SHOVED DOWN MY THROAT!

GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELVES!!!"
,IllusiveS,2012-04-18T01:52Z,"That's true. And I think even the author shows it. That bald castrated guy.. he's a homosexual too. And he said ""you may be surprised by the resauts. Lords come and go. Big fish eats the small fish, but I keep on paddleing"". How come?

I mean this show is vulgar as it is, and the amount of gayness is too damn high!"
,Ba1tuks,2012-04-23T19:38Z,"Those two over my comment is 100% pervs and gays :-D 
The show isn't full of gayness. And if it is, the show just gives you the true, what had been happening at the medieval times. Everything is so true and naked(not the gay or porn meaning, but the facts itself about heroes, kings, rules, lords and poor people which were killed for nothing) that sometimes chill runs down my spine :-)"
,bigbadpirate,2012-06-04T07:46Z,"For the first two comments: Recent research has shown that people who are bothered by homosexuality are very often gay themselves, but trying to hide it. They're refusing to admit it, even to themselves.

Here's my take: In a perfect world all guys would be gay. Except me. Imagine - all the women of the world, just for ME!"
