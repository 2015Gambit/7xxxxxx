Narratives:

2011 album from the British Doom Metal trio. Blood Lust was recorded in a dilapidated barn known as The Slaughter House. Using old fuzz pedals and broken amps to create a lo-fi saturated sound, the entire album was laid to rest on tape in the space of four cold months. Blood Lust tells the story of a drug crazed sadist who embarks on a witchfinding killing spree before meeting his own demise at the withered hands of Satan. The bands intention was to create an audio equivalent of a 60's exploitation horror film. After a steady start in sales, demand for the album eventually grew beyond all expectations with all pressings quickly selling out, including a Rise Above vinyl pressing of 350 which sold out in just 24 hours.
