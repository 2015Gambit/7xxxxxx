Life is Beautiful-AVCHD DTS BD5

An amazing combination of humor, romance, photography, and tragedy, a movie that will leave you with wonderful memories. It's particularly exciting for me personally to see the wonderful Italian town of Arezzo again, in glorious high definition video. If you visit Arrezo, you will see reference to the classic movie everywhere as tribute to Benigni, who is deservedly revered for the genius of his work.  For those who have this movie on DVD, I highly advise udating to the high definition version as the photography is stunning.  The US version of the DVD was especially poor quality video and audio.

Note that while a dubbed English DD5.1 audio track is available, I find the best way to watch is with the original Italian DTS track using the included English or French subtitles as needed.  The video was re-encoded using fully compatible 1920x1080p resolution, and is quite nice considering the relatively low bitrate (3110 bps) needed for this BD-5 / P2P special release.  The DTS audio captures the beautiful musical soundtrack very well.  If burned to a single sided DVD disk using UDF-2.5, it will play in most BluRay disk players.  Other releases with cropped video (outside BD specs) will not play in BD players.
