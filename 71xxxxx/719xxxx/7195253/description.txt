Rls Notes:

Dustin Bint a.k.a Mr Peculiar has been pleasing people's body and soul since the 90's with a varied range of music but mainly focusing on melodic twilight trance. Dustin's fifth album, 'Alternate Worlds', is a psychedelic trip down trance lane, and is about to set a new standard in psytrance, encompassing a wide range of styles. His newest release in four years is proudly being released on French label Hadra Records.
All of the tracks featured have been tried and tested on dancefloors around the world and refined to create an audio journey that evolves and twists through many emotions, taking the listener to an 'Alternate World'. To coincide with the release, Dustin will be launching a tour of Europe and Australia from March 2012.
