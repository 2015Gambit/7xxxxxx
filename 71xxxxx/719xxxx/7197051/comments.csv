,brianxxx,2012-04-23T13:56Z,Thanks! Worked well. One thing though...under Windows 7 64bit (only one I tested) the BACKUP feature crashes the program. Anyone else?
,mohiergauth,2012-04-26T02:08Z,"@brianxxx Yes, XPsp3, backup crash also.

However, this program fixed alot of drivers  I couldn't find (because all drivers host in China apparently in secret underground bases), and for this I am grateful. You may have my first born.

PROST!"
,mohiergauth,2012-04-26T02:09Z,"BTW, why don't you pinkos give this motherfucker some ratings? 

Are you really that lazy and posh?"
,Suomisisu,2012-04-30T09:16Z,"Worked fine.

Downloaded.
Ignored the serial.
Copied the cracked .exe over.

Says registered to (yourusername)

Downloading a ton of stuff for my outdated hardware now. Will see how it goes. I don't really trust these programs but I really need updated GFX drivers if they exist..."

,By.cioaua,2012-05-26T16:02Z,Worked fine for me thanks.
,jman037,2012-09-19T17:49Z,"Doesn't work.  Installed as instructed.  Chose a driver it listed to update.  It connects to the server and then eventually times out trying to download the driver.  Unless I am missing something, this product is garbage."
