Under Pressure
Everyone has babies on the brain and it's driving Khloe crazy! Family members and even complete strangers can't stop asking when she will get pregnant, and with Lamar struggling on and off the court, she doesn't need any more stress. To Khloe's delight, Kim flies out to Dallas to offer some sisterly companionship, but instead offers unwanted fertility advice that sets Khloe off. Meanwhile, Lamar continues to sink further and further into a deep depression. Can he pull himself out of his funk and get it together on the court?
