2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Is there a better way to start off your Monday morning than praising our Lord through music?  The most reiterated command in the Bible is for us to sing our praises to God.  As a matter of fact, music (in one form or another) is mentioned well over 1000 times in both the Old and New Testament.  So here's your chance to do just that with 29 additional releases, bringing the 2012 year-to-date count up from 288 to 317 titles.  This torrent contains some great ones too.  MercyMe's new single, Josh Wilson's newly released live album, the much anticipated Papa San project, Evan Craft, Dave And Dill have a nice little hymns release, and even Planetshakers adds to their massive discography with "Heal Our Land."
