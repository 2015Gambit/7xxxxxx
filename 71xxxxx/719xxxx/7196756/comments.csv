,maxvail,2012-04-22T22:36Z,"Sorry, newb here. Is there a way I can convert this into a regular mp4 that I can watch with my computer?"
,maxvail,2012-04-22T22:39Z,"Is there a way I can watch this as a regular 2d movie with my computer? If so, how?"
,maxvail,2012-04-22T22:40Z,"Sorry for double post, didnt think the first one worked..."
,dhumich,2012-04-27T22:31Z,@maxvail ... yes you can convert it to normal 2d...but you need some softwares like I am too 3D converter...but its takes way too long...instead dwnld a 2d rip...but there are no players which converts 3d to 2d and play it like media playerss... I think...not sure if there is any other softwares...
,jcrpost,2012-06-07T07:53Z,"@maxvail you don't need to bother with converting or getting another version if you already have this. Just use the Nvidia 3D Vision Video Player.. it's free and can switch between 3D and 2D on the fly.

I had issues with one version, but version 1.7.5 seems to work perfectly. Download that, click monoscopic, and enjoy :)"
