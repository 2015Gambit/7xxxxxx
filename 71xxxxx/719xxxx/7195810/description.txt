The highly anticipated 3-D journey inside a brand new world with a deep, dark secret in the most ambitious project ever from Hustler Video. A feature that is the first ever adult movie made specifically for 3-D televisions!
No cost was spared and no detail overlooked during the filming of Hustler Video's This Ain't Avatar XXX 3D. Live parody versions of "Avatar" people were created from what were computer-generated Avatars using prosthetics, wigs and plenty of blue paint.
In addition to the film's version of what a live Avatar might resemble, the most important element in turning the original film into a parody is the fact that the entire film was shot in 3D. The difference between what your parents saw in 3D and what you're going to see in 3D today is the illusion that there is depth of field. Characters aren't seemingly jumping out at you and there's no need to watch the film in fear that something ΓÇô or someone - might hit you at any time. We made a film, where, when you're watching it in 3D, everything just seems to come alive. It has dimension, depth, and the sense that you could literally walk in to the frame at any second.
