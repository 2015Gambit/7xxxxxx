Jeena Loves Pain is the best BDSM movie!!!

Apparently many of the more explicit BDSM scenes were edited out for the U.K. version. The film does perhaps make too much use of video editing/mixing/effects in the post-processing, but all in all is a very nice movie, tastefully done and well performed. The SM is on the lightweight side and the bondage is fairly elaborate. It is definitely worth watching. The plot is (as is usual in this gender) essentially meaningless; the major (submissive) character is apparently reliving memories of past fantasies with the help of a written diary that is illogically being read by a dominant female who performs the various punishments involved. But, we are used to the various plot ploys employed by makers of this genre of film, and most of them have less logic involved. In any case, it is beautifully filmed and worth watching just to admire the cinematography, if nothing else.
