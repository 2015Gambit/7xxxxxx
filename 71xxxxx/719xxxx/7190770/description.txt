Vijay Kumar is an young man living in a small town in rural India, who makes his living farming. He hopes to change his lifestyle and that of the townspeople by building a hospital with the help of attractive young doctor Rekha, who he is in love with, so much so that he is willing to donate his land. Rekha suggests that he approach the District Collector to get permission to build a hospital at another vacant spot, which he does. The Collector assures them that necessary approval will be granted. But the local Zamindar of the region, Ranjit Kumar, has other plans of his own, as he intends to build a Cinema House in his lovers (Sheela) name. When he faces opposition, he quietly backs away, and lets Rekha, Vijay and the townspeople lay the foundation of the hospital. Thereafter chaos breaks out in Vijay's life, as he is arrested by the police for killing Sheela. Vijay is tried in Court...
