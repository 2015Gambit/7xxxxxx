,beso140,2012-04-17T19:25Z,"HERO MASTER U ARE REALLY HERO, PLZ PU GAME
Company Of Heroes Tales Of Valor
last version plzzzzzzzzz"
,Gangplank,2012-04-18T05:35Z,Thanks for the game ;)
,RegPulp,2012-04-18T11:53Z,"company of heroes tales is already on piratebay, and the patch can be downloaded from relic website, and the crack for 2.602 is and has been available on gamecopyworld for a VERY longtime....

also you can use the mini-image instead of using the crack if you want the game protection system left intact.

am i missing something, or are you missing a brain?"
,RegPulp,2012-04-18T12:01Z,"as for this game, there are a few features that were never done for this game that this game needs, the company who done this game is very small, and ultimately for financial reason has to release the game to stay out of the red, however they are aware of this (they probably new this before release), patches will be coming fast and steady i'm sure.

this game is missing some polish touched that are needed, but now the company are getting some money coming in, they will turn there attention to creating some of those more technical demanding features that take time to program.

short story!!! game will be far better in about 6 weeks time when it's been patched several times.

it's a good game, but definitely feels.... it does need a few more things under the hood, but it's very good what they have done, ""Dangerous Waters Simulator"" turned into a GAME!"
,Szurix90,2012-04-18T12:49Z,"Unfortunately I cant load any map with any of the available releases. My firewall or antivirus does not mark this as harmful.
When clicinking on a tutorial mission it loads for 2 secs then goes back to main menu. 
When clicking on a campaign mission, the menu screen fades a bit as if starting to load something but nothing happens. It does not even return to main menu.
Did anyone else have similar failures? 
What could be the solution for the problem?"
,TPBuserNL,2012-04-18T13:15Z,"Can someone tell me how to mount this file / with what? All I get is a .bin file and a .cue file and of course the .nfo info file, but nothing to use with power-iso or to execute."
,RegPulp,2012-04-18T15:06Z,"powerISO can handle BIN format (convert it ISO)

or just use

Daemon tools lite."
,dahlert,2012-04-18T21:24Z,can't get it to work. whats the crack? it says i need to log on steam
,dahlert,2012-04-18T21:34Z,where is the crack? :s
,slico9921,2012-04-21T12:37Z,"thx heromaster, works great easy install no lag :)"
,budzman700,2012-04-22T02:23Z,"i cant play lan
some one plzzzzz helppp"
,RegPulp,2012-04-23T01:24Z,"i think this is infected, it's been flagged by my antivirus, when you run the executable, it also extracts another executable into windows temp folder, then it tried to run that (it was blocked by my antivirus), a setup executable that extracts another executable file into window temp folder...... very very wrong tome.

be WARNED!!!!"
,RegPulp,2012-04-23T01:36Z,"you can extract the setup.exe file with 7zip.

inside is

""setup.exe""
""file.exe""

that is bad..... surprisingly 3 antivirus programs did not cach it, microsoft security essentials did.... MSE is quite good.

Trojan Dropper Win32/Sirefef.B

file.exe is the one infected, the setup.exe inside the setup.exe is OK from what i can tell.
"
,colonelcanuk,2012-04-24T03:06Z,Has anyone else confirmed the virus in this torrent?  I was looking forward to trying this but I am going to wait until the virus is either confirmed or denied.
,RegPulp,2012-04-24T17:44Z,"i already explained what to do,

the setup.exe fil has 2 files in it,
""setup.exe"" & ""file.exe""

""setup.exe"" is the one needed, and is the real setup program for the game.

i don't know how to explain myself without causing confusion, i have tried several times to write instructions, but it doesn't look well.

maybe someone else who is a bit more articulate can explain better.

this release is OK to use as long as you do not run the setup.exe that comes with it, you need to extract the setup.exe, which will give two files, 

one of them being setup.exe, you need to replace the original setup. with this new one, DO NOT RUN ""file.exe""

simple."
,isotope,2012-04-24T22:03Z,Yes but why have a torrent up with malware in it...
,RegPulp,2012-04-25T22:19Z,"because HeroMaster probably didn't know it had malware in it....

seriously, you couldn't answer that yourself.

most people download these things from scene, then release on p2p, A thought B checked it, B assumed C checked it.... on and on it went until it's too late. That's usually how it goes.

one of the links decided to infect this release, usually the original release was fine, it's the journey in between that infected it.

B,D,F, U..... one of them infected it, because one of them is a traitor so to speak....

what you gonna do?

,Gexon,2012-05-01T02:02Z,"I'll see if i can confirm if there's a virus but i highly doubt it. There's a reason the uploader included a false-positive image in the description, these things happen all the time and it's probably the same here. Due to the way cracks work it trips your anti-virus into saying it's infected even though it's not."
,Gexon,2012-05-01T03:06Z,"Installed cleanly and the game runs smoothly as well, did a scan afterward but found nothing. Thanks for the upload!

Used daemon tools to mount the file(only one appears in the list), installed and copied the files from the tinyiso folder(For me it was in My Computer --> E:/) to the game directory and played. Hope this helps if anyone needs it."
,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-06-20T17:43Z,Not working win7 X64 screen goes blank and can not alt tab out or even task manager out have to reset restart pc BAD.
