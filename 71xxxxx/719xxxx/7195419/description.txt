Narratives:

One of the heavier industrial albums I've listened to in a while, No Youth by Wreck and Reference, is the followup to the project's 2011 album, Black Cassette. Hailing from California, Wreck and Reference are infusing heavy, doom-esque moments into otherwise spacious and hypnotic tracks. The track ôNauseaö even showcases some loud and mechanically delivered black metal-style blast beats.

No Youth sets a very specific mood, but utilizes a variety of percussion, and a large range of intensity to stand out amidst its peers. The album was even mixed and mastered by Colin Marson of Krallice, which definitely gives the album somewhat of a seal of approval in some circlesûthis being one of them.

Recorded by W&R in the Howling Wasteland, CA. Mixed and mastered by Colin Marston at Menegroth, the Thousand Caves. Photography by Brandon Gehres. Depicted: Walter Karl Marcus.
