     The story unfolds through the night      
     where the fine line between law and      
     crime is repeatedly crossed, leading     
     to unexpected situations, sometimes      
     very hilarious. The 4 guys who think     
     of themselves as very rough and tough,   
     macho men encounter situations where     
     they are forced to reckon with a         
     different truth about themselves.
