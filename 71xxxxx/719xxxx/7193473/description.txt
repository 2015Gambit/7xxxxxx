
Hi,

I had a hard time in compiling the monthly indie playlists. So much material but not much that could thrill me. It all sounded a bit intoxicated; tiered. So I was looking for supplemental tracks to make the lists complete.

So I came across some favourite indie songs and compiled two new playlists. An Easy and a more Inspiring one. Just the way Indie Rock sounds really new to me.

Enjoy and seed,
