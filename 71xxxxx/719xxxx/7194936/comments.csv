Any suggestions ? Verbatim 2.4x burn LT 3.0, i ran the disk through ABGX 1.6"
,Gnorhild,2012-04-18T17:24Z,It contains all 3 games? That sounds nice!
,razvan71,2012-04-18T19:29Z,"yes , but the ancient combat new realise is not working for me"
[V],boobsman,2012-04-18T20:36Z,@ razvan71 did you run the iso through abgx before burning? if so was it green (except for the online patch)? if so have you checked the burned disc with abgx? you may have had a disc error from burning.
,razvan71,2012-04-18T21:22Z,"i had it verified by abgx and burned after, it seams i'm not the only one with the problem, i read on some forums the same thing also with jtag and lt 3.0"
,razvan71,2012-04-18T21:26Z,"I had it verified with abgx and the burned, it's not just me with the problem , found a lot of ppl have it also with jtag or lt+3.0 http://www.xbox360iso.com/rs-nl-fr-t582625p2.html"

,sinfthedruid,2012-04-20T17:16Z,"a bit late but maybe you guys should actually know what the hell you're downloading before you say you have issues. this game is a comp. of both of the games, not a new 1. in other words, this is 2 games in 1, not three.

,Vaders--,2012-04-24T04:30Z,"No need for wiki, open your eyes to the top of the torrent description.

combines two explosive Deadliest Warrior games Deadliest 
Warrior: The Game & Deadliest Warrior: Legends 

Seems as though TPB gets all the illiterate type or the unwilling to read.


IT'S  2 Games in one with a huge arsenal of additional weapons and features found only 
on this disc.

,wildyracing,2012-04-29T18:47Z,"Hello,
I'm LT2+ and I also got kicked on the dashboard as soon as trying to start the disc. My brother is LT3+ on Xbox Slim and he also gets kicked out. We tried different methods of burning the disc, we started it from HDD as well as from the disc, but so far no good. At least I can say that the problem is from the game itself, not from bad burned disc or something. Please, who knows how to fix this? Help appreciated :)"
,co0ked_koKe,2012-05-05T09:50Z,"To all u out there who didn't read the description 1st(including me). i understand, we got more torrents to download cant be reading all this crap. half the shyt we already know. "
