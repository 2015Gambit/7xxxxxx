,Fegan,2012-04-18T10:41Z,The video is very dark and indistinct in many places. Not worth watching.
,jennifermcadam,2012-04-19T07:22Z,"Thanks froggie

,digimike50,2012-04-20T14:18Z,Many thanks!
,PrincessPink,2012-04-20T18:20Z,"I stupidly trusted another d/lder (subsequently removed by PB) which was password locked and needed a sign up to a website. Froggie, thank you for posting this in the true spirit of PB."
,cliff69,2012-04-20T22:08Z,Completely worthless.  Screen so dark can't see faces and often completely black.  Sound terrible.  DO NOT bother.
,cliff69,2012-04-20T22:12Z,Didn't poster notice this was unwatchable crap?
,theSlugg,2012-05-01T10:23Z,This is avid cam copy  don't waste your dl
,howiej0,2012-05-05T03:54Z,Thanks for the upload. Absolutely no thanks for the password protection and need to buy another product to see the video. Have no idea how good download is but won't look for froggie's downloads
,cheesy211,2012-05-05T20:35Z,"V - 4

Thanks froggie, way too dark for me to watch on this occasion."
,Criminet2,2012-05-06T12:33Z,"@ howiej0 .. ur a total retard .. if u got somethin password protected, it wasnt from froggie .. besides, how the fuck can anyone password protect an .avi file .. avi is just a container for media files .. there is no encryption or passwording possible"
,dougaldog2002,2012-05-10T14:57Z,"I'm really going off these magnate downloads. With the old torrent method you could pick and choose what files you downloaded. For example; I've read a couple of comments about how dark the screen is and I see there are samples in the torrent. Previously I could download just the samples and check out the quality before commiting to the whole film. Now I have to download all 14 files only to have wasted my time if the quality isn't what I expected. Any ideas on how to work around this?

This is not a poke at Froggie incidentally, just a general comment on downloading a magnet file."
,peilass,2012-05-10T20:26Z,"It's very easy to avoid having to download everything. After you select download, go to your download app (I use Utorrent), select the download then show the files - in Utorrent it's in the lower part of the window. You will see all the files that are being downloaded -- then in the Priority column right-click the file(s) you don't want to download and select ""Don't download."" Do this as soon as you start downloading. Very simple you see."
,rabbit42,2012-05-14T00:59Z,"if using a magnetic link and I do NOT dl every single file in the ""torrent"" the latest versions of both bit and utorrent usually wont dl anything or will dl at .09k even with 10K seeders... never had that problem with actual torrent files"
,nz77788,2012-06-06T03:53Z,Not worth the download. Wait for it to come out on DVD then download a DVDrip. It's hard trying to get into a good movie that has terrible sound and picture...
,lawrencew,2012-06-10T22:49Z,I've looked at it. This is a s**t download. Why are folks downloading it???
,invenio,2012-06-11T08:52Z,Way to dark to be enjoyable. Cam release. Would be appreciated to have that stated in the title.
,whitecat2010,2012-06-11T09:47Z,"Criminet2: It's not froggie's case, BUT it is very possible. For instance, I downloaded a torrent called The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2012 DVDRip XviD- OCW. It was an .avi, and it had a readme. I downloaded the readme first, and it said ""if you have problems watching, try with Windows Media Player"". I tried with VLC and it was just curtains of colour, so I tried WMP. It had a screen with the TPB logo and it asked for my TPB username and password to verify I'm a human. I had slept very little last night, so I made the stupidest noob thing, I put it in (fortunately writing my username wrong, for the same reasons!). THEN another screen, asking me to download a DivX codec. Then it dawned on me that it was a more sophisticated version of a fake/spyware torrent, and slapped myself, for having to change my password which I remembered so easily all these years!"
