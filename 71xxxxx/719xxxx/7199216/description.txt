For fans of Peter Kay (or just good comedy) Driven to Distraction
is one of the very first programmes he ever starred in and has
never been seen before on DVD. This ultra rare gem has him starring
alongside Matthew Dunster and Pearce Quiggley as they try to rob a
local pub of their eveningâ™s takings. With Kay as the getaway driver
though hilarity, and thoroughly unsuccessful robbery, soon ensues.
This short film, which was Peter Kay's first project for television
was made in 1996 and was transmitted by Granada Television, YTV,
LWT and Tyne Tees as part of the 'New Voices' series of dramas by
new writers and directors - it was released for the first time in
2005 on DVD...
