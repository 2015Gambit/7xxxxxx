,ToonPal,2012-04-24T07:43Z,"I downloaded this torrent and peeked through it a little.  It's basically a blast from the past; a custom Windows XP Setup CD image made in early 2006.  This torrent feels like someone ripping old CD-Rs and posting them on Pirate Bay for smirks and snickers.  Anyway, I made a bitprint for this file on Bitpedia which can be accessed at the URL below.

,zi443r,2012-04-28T00:45Z,i've uploaded this for a friend abroad not for something else.
,ToonPal,2012-04-29T00:05Z,Just for one person? Why not just upload directly to him? Why choke up Pirate Bay with your junk? Is that the same story for Drivere Acer Extensa 5220 and WIndows Xp Gysmo?
,zi443r,2012-04-29T22:51Z,"why not pirate bay?
there are thousands of other things withous seeders here:)
gysmo and xt are unique , you will not find them anywhere else:P "
