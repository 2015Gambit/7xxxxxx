Game Description
Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi is the closest thing you can get to battling inside the actual DBZ animation! Redesigned battles not only hit harder, but have been overhauled to look and unfold more like the animated TV series. Enjoy complete character customization as you choose your character's face, hair, body, clothes, even his battle style and special moves. A new Impact Break battle system means you can pulverize your opponents and demolish the environment while you do it. Unleash Ki blasts that carve through the sky and blast giant craters in the ground as you defeat bosses 15 times your size and battle deep into the DBZ universe.
