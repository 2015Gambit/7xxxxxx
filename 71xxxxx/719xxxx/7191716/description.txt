Notes: Busy with wheel of time series, haven't had the chance to watch the episode yet , Enjoy :D!!

The timecodes below are for people whose players don't switch between 2.0 and 5.1, others just ignore it.


Time Codes : 00:01:36.013

GUIDE: Open up the encode in MKVToolNix by adding
                 Go to the "Global" Tab.
                 Tick "Enable Splitting"
                 Select "After Time Codes and copy and paste the 
                 bits in bold, I've put above "GUIDE".


In a nutshell
