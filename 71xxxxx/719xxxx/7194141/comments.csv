The sound crackles really badly in parts and gets muffled. The video is pretty blurry. But all in all you can watch it and get the jist of everything being said."
,Tankerbot,2012-04-21T21:58Z,"Checking this one out now. Hopefully won't have audio sync issues out of the box. (I won't be converting it to anything).

God I wish TBH would stop using magnet links. I f***ing hate them. What happened to traditional torrent files?"
,asercv,2012-04-28T00:22Z,"Christiany214 says the same bullshit on every torrent, with his bullshit link. fuck him"

,kornbred69,2012-05-07T09:22Z,I quite dislike the magnets as well... no file list... and a great potential for misuse 
,doobieev,2012-05-11T06:48Z,"@kornbred69, had to login to comment on ur crappy  thoughts. Use the file tab in utorrent. If you do not have ut you suck."
