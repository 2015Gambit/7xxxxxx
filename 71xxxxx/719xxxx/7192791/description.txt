Changes in 1CLICK DVD Copy 4.2.8.9 (April 16, 2012):
 - Updated: CPRx updated (version 1047) for new movies.

If you are searching for a free third party decrypter, you have two choices: DVD43 and DVD43 Plug-in.
 
DVD43 works on 32 bit Windows, runs in the background, and decrypts DVDs on the fly.
 
DVD43 Plug-in works on 32 and 64 bit Windows and provides an interface that DVD copy programs can use to decrypt.
 
You should not use any other decrypter at the same time as DVD43 or DVD43 Plug-in if you want to avoid errors when using 1CLICK software.
