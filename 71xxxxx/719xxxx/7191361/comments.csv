,greenwheel,2012-04-17T20:11Z,whatever SirDIZEL sceneline is just releasing the work done by other groups. He doesn't even bother to unrar before releasing. Laaaaaaaaaaaaame!

[V],spastik64,2012-04-18T01:53Z,"Lol I hate when ppl trolls without any knowledge.

The file size depends of the encoding, the encoding is made by the group (DIMENSION) who recorded that show. Sceneline and we only share files, so if you don't like something about our stuff tell it to ripping scene groups, not us."
,emdzi,2012-04-20T06:16Z,@spastik64: Don't you do your unrared releases anymore? They were pretty decent alternative to this...
