History Of Samplers and Sampling:

There are two versions of the album, each containing a different version of the track. On the original release, the introduction to the tune is played on a Turkish flute, whereas the later reissue of the album uses an Arabian string orchestra for the introduction. The flute version also has a different vocal accompaniment, as sung by an Arabian vocalist. Revolutions contains reworked samples of an unpublished composition by Turkish Kudsi Erguner (Ney Flute), which Jarre had acquired from ethnologist Xavier Bellenger. Erguner took his case to court and won a modest indemnity. Jarre removed the ney flute part from new releases of the record and from live performances.


This is the version with the flute.
