The Secret History of DB Cooper #2 [ONI Press]

A missing daughter. A broken marriage. An empty house. Dan Cooper is a man who has lost everything but his mission. The CIA's premiere psychic assassin, Cooper is on the verge of losing this job, too, as his government handlers reconsider the insanity of their situation and the unstable nature of Cooper's tortured psyche. But Cooper's assignments are more than names on papers in sealed envelopes--they're a calling that he has no choice but to answer.
