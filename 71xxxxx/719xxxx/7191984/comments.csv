,cmax1,2012-04-17T21:49Z,Is this the BBC or Sky version?
,doser69,2012-05-04T15:26Z,"It is the Sky HD recording, 50FPS

Thanks WHEELS

I wish people would stop recording BBC

THERE IS NO MARTIN BRUNDLE, WHY WOULD WE WANT BBC?"
,doser69,2012-05-04T17:53Z,"Ignore what I said.

The commentary is Croft, Brundle

HOWEVER

It is from an Australian Station, is missing 25% of the race to adverts (edited out)

So, this is not the full race, and it is not Sky.

It's better than BBC though.."
