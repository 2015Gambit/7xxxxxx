Release: IonCube PHP Encoder v6.5.9


The ionCube PHP Encoder makes it easy to protect your PHP 4 & 5 source code from easy observation, theft and change. Plus, with PHP licensing features built into the Pro and Cerberus editions, licensing PHP scripts to control where your code runs is easy too, and you can even give your files a time expiry! Optional encryption of non-PHP code is also supported if required.


Installation:
Run setup first
Then run patch to activate the program


Available in two editions, Pro and Cerberus, all ionCube PHP Encoder editions offer bytecode PHP encoding plus optional encryption of non-PHP files. Pro and Cerberus also include optional PHP licensing features for time expiry and restricting where code can be used, allowing licensing models to be effectively and easily implemented.

The PHP Encoder is available for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Intel OS X. All versions offer command line access for encoding, and also for creating license files using Pro or Cerberus. This feature is ideal if you wish to automate processing. The Windows Encoder also includes an easy to use GUI, and the Windows Pro and Cerberus editions include a Linux based license generator for PHP scripts too, allowing scripts to be protected using Windows and creating license files from a Linux based web server.
