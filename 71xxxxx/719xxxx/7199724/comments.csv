[T],nobody2007,2012-04-20T21:45Z,"15GB? ***headshaking**
Eine Menge Bits and Bytes f체r den Mi.. von Office. Welcher Idiot l채dt sich schon solch ein riesiges Paket herunter?!?

MSDN = Was soll das bedeuten? - What does it mean?
Ist hier der Source-code f체r s채mtliche Projekte enthalten?"
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-04-21T05:58Z,You can shake your head later - but i would appreciate if you could have wrote your comment in English which would be easier for me to explain. Though it seems that you would like to know what is MSDN - Everything is cleared in the RAR file.
,Jero2000,2012-04-21T12:26Z,"@nobody: If you take 10 seconds out of your day to have a look at your BitTorrent client, you will see that you can easily choose which part of a huge torrent file (like this one) you want to download. If you don't want to download the whole 15 GB, you don't need to - just pick the language version that suits you.

And if you don't like what prathaprabhu has provided here - just keep it to yourself, thank you. You can easily find out what ""MSDN"" means, it's as easy as typing those four letters into Google.

Last but not least: versuch's hier einfach mal auf Englisch, dann verstehen dich die Leute auch. Es sei denn, du willst gar nicht, dass man dich versteht. (= try posting in English, people might understand you better that way. Or maybe you don't want to be understood.)"
,hydraone,2012-04-21T22:15Z,it seems that there is an error in the archive (english) and it will not expand. Has anybody had a similar experience?
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-04-22T05:49Z,"of course not, if so then your download must be corrupted or incomplete.

Cheers"
,VicVega,2012-05-03T15:16Z,Your pay site stuff really sounded fishy so thanks for making torrents again.
,adij57,2012-05-05T11:36Z,"Prathaprabhu your password for the RAR file doesn't work. It always ask me to enter a password in order to decompress the archive ..
Have you any solution ?"
,atakdog,2012-05-05T20:10Z,"No, adij57, the password works fine.  I used UnRarX to un-rar; I then mounted the iso and the opened the dmg without diffculty.  (Snow leopard, fwiw.)"
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-05-06T07:46Z,Office for Mac 2011 SP2 is released do reach me over given email to obtain it.
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-05-06T07:50Z,@ VicVega - what do yo mean by my site if fishy? If you don't know what it is please don't comment at all or you could have posted your comment in the respective site.
,Kasan05,2012-05-08T09:40Z,In the Danish language version the Office installer is asking for a product key? 25 digits.... I need help! 
,Kasan05,2012-05-08T09:48Z,The danish language version is asking for a product key? 25 digits. Can you help?
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-05-09T06:20Z,You need a genuine key to install and activate. It doesn't matter which language it is.
,VicVega,2012-05-11T04:28Z,I meant what I said. Charging money for warez is always fishy. Sharing is caring.
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-05-14T01:22Z,"What i have shared is not warez so everyone knows.

Thanks for the understanding."
,tfco,2012-06-16T09:30Z,"Why not just include in your description:
*this download is free but you have to pay for the activation key*

Anyway, I just finished the DL, going to search for the activation key. "
[T],prathaprabhu,2012-06-21T09:00Z,All my uploads are untouched and I am here to share the untouched products from Microsoft. Which wasn't done by anyone else. 
,VicVega,2012-06-22T16:25Z,Yeah but you also want money. And you don't give any of that money to Microsoft. That's what I meant by fishy.
