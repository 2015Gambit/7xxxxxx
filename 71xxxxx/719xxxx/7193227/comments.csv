In SILENCERS, he finds himself up against the elusive ""Big O."" But have no fear, Helm isn't alone in this mission, he's always got a handful of sexy ladies by his side. The soundtrack features numerous Dean Martin tunes such as ""If You Knew Susie,"" ""On the Sunny Side of the Street,"" ""South of the Border,"" and ""The Glory of Love."" In MURDERERS' ROW, Helm is recalled from retirement to rescue Ann-Margret's father, a world-renowned scientist. WRECKING CREW features European landscapes, exotic women, and martial-arts action choreographed by none other Bruce Lee himself, in a near-perfect spy picture. Finally, AMBUSHERS sees secret agent Matt Helm recruited to locate a hijacked American spacecraft, but he has his hands full when he comes up against double-agent Francesca Madeiros, who's as curvaceous as she is criminal.
