Do Not Download This Torrent This Torrent The Torrent Is Garbage If You Want The Official Album And The Right One Go To The Following Link
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7187377/Cascada_-_Back_On_the_Dancefloor_%28Album_-_2012%29__320_kbps_

The Tracks In This Torrent Work Unlike This Torrent Where The Track Truly Madly Deeply (Radio Edit) Sounds Like Some Dude Singing It Instead Of Actually Cascada The Link I Provided I Downloaded And Tested And The Tracks Sound Like Cascada And Not A Dude."
