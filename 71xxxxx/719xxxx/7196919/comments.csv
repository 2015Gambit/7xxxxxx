,sicanddisturbed,2012-04-19T14:54Z,"Love and Death is the new band name for Brian ""Head"" Welch. He changed the name of his band because people were confusing band dates with speaking engagements. I have the free song that P.O.D. and Love and Death offer on their websites. Love and Death has a song called Chemical and P.O.D. has a song called Lost in Forever. Here is a link to Love and Death's website http://www.loveanddeathmusic.com/"
