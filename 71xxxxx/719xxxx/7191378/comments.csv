Oh i forgot this is The Pirate Bay LOL"
,Diminias,2012-04-17T05:29Z,Sorry bud just quick using this to get this to a friend then its coming down...
,zx6rider,2012-04-17T05:49Z,Whats weird is that this game is free to download directly from their website...whats weirder is that it takes about 1/8 of the time to download this game from their website as opposed from here. Makes me wonder why someone would take the time to make it a torrent and upload it...virus or Trojan software...
,Diminias,2012-04-17T06:08Z,Tera has several issues with patch downloads and corruption.  There are hundreds of pages on their forums detailing such.  My friend has followed their recommendations to the letter and has failed miserably.  So I zipped up a good copy from my own computer and I'm using this to get it over to him.
,The4X3R,2012-04-17T08:28Z,"Don't like the speed or anything else? Do not download! You want to forbid people post torrents they want/need? That's stupid.

Also I have a question: this game is f2p, so where's the catch?

Thanks in advance."
,RooTPB,2012-04-17T08:35Z,"Chill out guys. He's only putting it up temporarily for a friend, who obviously is unable to visit the website in order to download it properly."

,geminireaper,2012-04-18T06:20Z,Diminias Please keep it up a bit longer. Im having same issue and Tera support is no help.
,v0j4,2012-04-19T19:55Z,using the tera launcher my download speed is 10KB/s :( it would be awesome if you keep the torrent up for a little bit longer.
,v0j4,2012-04-19T20:02Z,"oh, is this the NA version or the EU version? :)"
