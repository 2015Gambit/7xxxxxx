ENGLISH (there is a Portuguese version for this in the torrent - existe uma versão em português para esse texto no torrent):

This is a compilation of the best videos from X Japan's concert in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
on September 11th 2011.

The videos were selected regarding the image quality, audio quality, and video length,
which means only the videos that had the best image and audio quality, steadiest image
and with the longest length were selected. Because of that, some of the videos might not be
ideal for a compilation, but were chosen because they were the best available. Also, nobody had
recorded (or, at least, had uploaded up until now) the entire "Art of Life's" intro in good video
quality, so that's why the second half of the violin solo and the beginning of the playback
piano intro are missing. But it's nothing that compromises the fun.
Except by the RedeTV!'s video, all videos were downloaded from YouTube.
