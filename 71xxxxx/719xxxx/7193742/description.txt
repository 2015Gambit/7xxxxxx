2010 episode that I don't believe was capped when it first aired. I caught it on a repeat.


Episode description:
How long does hope last? Presumed Dead tells the extraordinary stories of three ordinary Canadians who disappeared without a trace. It was supposed to be a romantic getaway, but Mark Comey and his wife Robyn's Mexican holiday turned to tragedy and mystery. One evening Mark headed down to the beach and just never came back. Was it death or deceit? Former Canadian Football League star Al Brenner vanished more than three decades ago. While police at the time suspected foul play, his family has always believed Brenner might have escaped into another life. The manhunt for missing 14-year-old Julie Bureau made headlines in Quebec for weeks before her trail went cold. For three years her grieving parents wondered what happened. Finding out the truth about Julie would be harder than losing her.
