,maddogeleven,2012-04-18T05:41Z,"Also, thanks for the quick release, Sceneline!"
,flg8rfan,2012-05-01T03:45Z,"Yeah, maddog, it is too hard to seed.  I don't download sceneline releases when there's any other option, and I don't reseed any of sceneline's releases, because watching it and reseeding it means I have to give up 2x the space for each episode, since it's in .rar form.  I recombine the .rar files, and immediately dump them and the torrent, and only keep the finished product."
