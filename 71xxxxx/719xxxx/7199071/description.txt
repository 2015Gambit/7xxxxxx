TAPE magazine ΓÇô a new fashion and music magazine dedicated to the best. TAPE features the forward-thinkers, the free radicals, the ΓÇ£donΓÇÖt just talk, doΓÇ¥ people. TAPE is about the most interesting fashion and the most creative design, the most innovative music and the hearts and minds behind them. Most of all, TAPE is for you. The reader.
We could bore you with platitudes and the familiar sound of that dusty and scratched record stuck in a groove, telling you about how innovative we are ΓÇô but TAPE isnΓÇÖt about us. ItΓÇÖs about the creatives whoΓÇÖs work fuels our (and hopefully your) imagination. TAPE is about the artists who put smiles on our faces and make our hearts beat faster.
