Some phones dont come with it, they have to download it via the market, and for some , like mine has done, wont update it on its own, so im having to download and install manually to actually get it on a device that should have come with it"

Never mind the fact that a lot of android tablets aren't supposed to run the typical google services like the android market. Don't know if this version will work on those tablets, (about to test it on mine) but that's the boat I'm in. A little ticked off because the vender advertised my tablet as coming with the android market but its not on here and apparently isn't supposed to be. "
