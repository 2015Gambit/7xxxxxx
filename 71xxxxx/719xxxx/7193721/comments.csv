I thought the show sucked at the beginning because the writing was so strange, but near the middle of the season it just picked up and I really fell for it. I HOPE they end this well in case the show isn't picked up!!! Better not be some lame ass cliffhanger and then be cancelled! :( THANK YOU! :)"
