,M0r1d0rn,2012-04-18T03:21Z,"I don't know why.. but all your newer uploads I got a problem with audio, theres a 2 second delay between picture and audio. Does anyone else experience that?"
,PivotAX,2012-04-18T14:40Z,"@M0r1d0rn I have aswell, but all you need is to use VLC where you can add delay to video/audio by pressing the ""j"" and ""k"" keyboard key :)"
,clintabn,2012-04-19T01:26Z,"@M0r1d0rn
It's most likely because it's an mp4, which don't seem to be as stable as the usual avi (i.e. loses it sync rather easily)
Might be a one off, but if not I'd advise looking for avi's."
,holywars6,2012-04-19T15:32Z,"MP4 works a lot better with Quicktime, whilst AVI is really VLC territory, just switch your player"
