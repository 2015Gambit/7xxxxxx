and he gave to the poor.
Stood up to the man
and he gave him what for.

Our love for him now
ainâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t hard to explain.
The hero of Canton
the man they call ... Slaughter. 

Doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?"

(A/V=10).

Castle is growing better episode after episode, and this one is a real treat !

It's as if the writers told themselves :""Let's revive the spirit of Firefly in this 45 minutes episode of Castle""

Baldwin is great, the suspense is omnipresent, best episode of this season so far ! "
