,TurkishMasta,2012-04-18T01:22Z,Thanks for the upload. Lately your uploads have been quite large in terms of byte size. I think everyone would appreciate smaller files if possible. If not we are always grateful for your contributions and thank you very very much.
,HamoDude,2012-04-18T01:38Z,"Perfect VIDEO and AUDIO and a another hot one from Kate in tight leather.

What is wrong with u..just do ur thing n leave"
,xViviDx,2012-04-18T07:20Z,TurkishMasta:  i prefer the larger file size when its xvid avi. can be less bytes when its x264 with vbr and vfr mp4 or mkv. extremezones uploads are always good quality though.
,pploco12,2012-04-18T09:14Z,thanx 4 the up
,follybeachbum,2012-04-18T09:15Z,"I see there are alot of ungrateful peeps talking about extreme, but yet your on extremes torrent coping there work!!!!! Extreme is one of the best here......and insteed of talking crap go get your torrent somewhere else!!!!!! "
,danboy1200,2012-04-18T09:35Z,"Probly get loads of shit for asking this and yes, yes i am a noobie! But, ive got shit loads of dvds and blu rays, how do i upload and how do i get round the copying protection?"
,xViviDx,2012-04-18T10:37Z,"danboy1200:   download a ""video encoder"" online. it will rip dvds. heaps to try. handbrake is an easy one and dvdfab is good with avi. dvdfab also can make avi with .264 which can b good. you can also rip dvds with dvdfab as ""mkv passthrough"" which is exact quality of dvd."

,newworldodour,2012-04-19T10:42Z,"I also think the filesize is larger than it need to be for this quality,It does not not mean I am ungrateful to the uploader so if any twat wants to abuse me  or flip out over what is just an honest opinion,please consider going & fucking yourselfs you 'unfuckinbelievable' 'Cunts' '!!!!!' etc etc"
,questar,2012-04-19T16:28Z,"I watched this last night. The A/V quality is excellent. There are two reasons why the file is larger than normal:

(1) The film is very dark, lighting-wise. Dark movies do not encode well. The image compression process preserves the bright information at the expense of the dark information. To get good quality in a dark movie you have use more bits.

(2) There are a lot of strobe-light scenes. Even some strobe-light torches! Strobe lighting also requires more bits to encode well because the entire image is changing all the time."
,danboy1200,2012-04-20T09:30Z,"watched the whole film last night on ps3 but half way through its got cinivia audio protection or something similar, although its almost worth watching in silence just to watch kate in a catsuit it would be better to be able to hear the film. Any ideas would be apprieciated, cheers"

,DACreech,2012-04-22T09:31Z,"I am Very Happy with this Upload. No complaints here with this at all. To me it's not too dark at all. It looks exactly how the previous Underworld movies are filmed. Dark as it was intended.  Thanks for sharing!

,NuSeble,2012-04-23T02:48Z,"I haven't seen the movie in theatre yet, but so far the quality on this is perfect from what I can tell. My only question is.. Are there subtitles for this movie? About 30 minutes in, they start speaking in their tongue and if so, where to get them?
Regardless, another great upload.

,1Atheist,2012-05-10T21:22Z,"Is this one Cinavia free?? It's sad that this has to be asked at all, but... We ARE under a Monetary System hosted by a Totalitarian Government (U.S.) which is actively seeking to rid the world of Liberty. :-/"
,1Atheist,2012-05-12T07:08Z,"Nevermind. I know now. It IS, in fact, Cinavia Protected. DAMMIT!!! [>:-("
