QM 03 - Zero Point Fields

The equilateral geometry of Zero Point EM fields in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter].

Building on the equilateral geometry of mass-ENERGY, the geometry of Charged quantum mechanical fields is revealed.

Uniting equilateral Quantised Angular Momentum and mass-ENERGY to form the two types of charge that exist, the true geometry behind PlanckΓÇÖs Constant is revealed for the first time in recorded history.

The third chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Charged fields and the EM basis for all mass-ENERGY-Matter interactions behind the Science of the new millennia.
