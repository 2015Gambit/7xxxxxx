Matey :) I will try and explain to help. :) sorry to everybody if I haven't in the past.

If my torrent says CAM it is basically a Cam and I try and rate to save people downloading and being disappointed with the qualiy.

If the torrent says just (IPOD) etc then its a DVD re-code.

If my torrent says (HD) then its HD.. (you will not see many on TPB)

So this movie is DVD encode :) 

As for downloading new stuff , really All I do is encode something for me to watch on the way to work etc, and then just share it.  If there is a movie that you want then I will always try and help.. 

Sometimes I download old stuff because I thought the film was really cool, Like this one ..

Hope this helps "
