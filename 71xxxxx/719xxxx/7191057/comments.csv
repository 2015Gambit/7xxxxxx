My favourite show is Survivor! I love watching the lengths people will go to backstab each other for $1 Million!! That and Curb Your Enthusiasm"

Does anyone still have this torrent active? Nobody seems to be seeding. If anyone can seed for awhile then I'd be happy to carry on the baton for a while. MIC S02E09-11 and MIC S03E01-03 seem to have seeding problems.
Thanks"
