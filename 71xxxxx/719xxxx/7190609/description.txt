Based on the real-world route, this expansion for RailWorks 3 will take you across the East coast of Scotland on the UKΓÇÖs most scenic rail journey. As the crow flies, this route is around 80 miles in length but once you have taken into account the twists and turns the whole route is around 120 miles.

Travel from Waverley station in Edinburgh past the foot of the castle to Haymarket. Take in the iconic Scottish Rugby Union Murrayfield stadium up to what some would say is the eighth wonder of the world, the Forth Rail Bridge over the Firth of Forth between Dalmeny and North Queensferry.



Then its down the steep incline into Inverkeithing past the Rosyth Royal Naval dockyards and onwards. Drive through RAF Leuchars and on to the Firth of Tay over the rail bridge, passing the stumps of the old bridge, and into the City of Dundee. The route also extends from Dundee through the villages of Invergowrie and Errol along the banks of the river Tay, over the single line Perth viaduct, then into the majestic town of Perth.

Scottish East Coast Main Line is loosely based on the 2006-2007 period when the GNER operating company was just turning into National Express and Waverley station had just been rebuilt.
