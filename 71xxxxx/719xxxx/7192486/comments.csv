,ScarletteSpider,2012-05-30T02:42Z,"excellent quality upload, v10 a10, however, less than 8 hours on my machine and my internet provider Century Link shut down my internet acct for having this movie. watched it as soon as downloaded, then dumped it and did a registry clean and got nailed anyways. If its something thats in the coding in the movie to ping as an illegal download its still in there rat-ing us out. had to do some fancy verbal tap dancing to get my internet back"
