TO ALL:

This is a INSTALLED version of Rosetta Stone
There are 4 files in this RAR file

1. Readme!!.txt
2. RS_Preinstalled.pdf
3. RS_Preinstalled.iso
4. PowerISOSetup.zip

I have included detailed instructions in both the txt file and the PDF.
I hope this solves a lot of the problems people have been having.

I have UL'd the Spanish (Latin America) Preinstalled.ISO (which has all 5 levels).

Try it out and let me know,
