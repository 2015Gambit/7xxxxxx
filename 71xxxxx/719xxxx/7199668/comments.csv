So cheers Mr Dobbs and congrats on the green skull sir. "

,69DrugDealer,2012-04-21T01:40Z,"Usually I don't give a sh** to leave a comment ,but in this case I have to say - GOOD JOB MAN! best torrent file of this movie in entire internet, no glitches, no cut offs & its full length - FIVE STARS! "
,69DrugDealer,2012-04-21T01:42Z,WILL SEED ON NO LIMIT !
,theeccentrik,2012-04-21T09:12Z,"69drugdealer has clearly been smoking too much of his shit to give it 5 stars, seeing stars maybe!
Just released and like all 1st torrents it's not great, (not uploaders fault), inside ship scenes of which there are plenty are pixelated to shit on 56"" sony, some scenes out of sync and slanted.

But as i said it's the norm for a new movie cam and with all the CGI would ruin it. Thanks J.R"
,weavermage,2012-04-22T11:17Z,better quality compared to the others. watchable and no shaking/weird angles. Blurrier in darker area but okay on a big screen. thanks
,Heavytoe53,2012-05-04T07:10Z,"Great work, thanks!!"
