These are scaled down and badly compressed with an outdated format.

h264/AVC/AAC in *.MKV are usually HD (720p) the *.AVI releases are usually 480p/576p with bad compression.

Stop uploading and downloading inferior quality. This format was adapted after the early 00's!

Wake up pepole!"

,woodbooger,2012-05-03T15:57Z,DO you want a go cunt? 
,Mr_Gamer,2012-05-06T11:56Z,"@pornznz: Thanks for understanding! It is really frustrating when you DL something and it winds up being awful!

In fact, the only hit and run's I perform is when the quality sucks. 

@woodbooger: Sure, I'm grateful to people uploading rips, but if you ARE uploading rips, why make it crappy when it can be made good?

Also, grow up. Stop acting all high and mighty just because you can say whatever you want and hide behind a screen."
