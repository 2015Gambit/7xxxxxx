,Maths01,2012-04-19T19:39Z,where is the fix ?
,smoglr4,2012-04-21T07:44Z,"Torrent works fine for me. The fix is already applied since the 1st door I came across workded xD. Only negative point is the crackling in music for the game menu. The sound is fine once you start the single player or multi-player.
 The torrent starts of slow but really picks up pace and is downloaded within the hour for me.
I will seed!!

Thank you very much for this game, once the price has dropped on steam I shall buy it!"
