,LSO44,2012-04-19T00:42Z,Thanks! Needed a internet security key after ThumperTM's got flagged.
[V],.BONE.,2012-04-19T01:39Z,thanks works fine 
,mike18xx2,2012-04-19T06:15Z,I have fond memories of actual keygens.
,reyasl,2012-04-19T13:12Z,every few hours i get the lame warning who say my avast is illegal..any idea how to stop that message?
,MrTimeOut,2012-04-20T00:58Z,"Excelent post DarthXP, i did it on monday and i haven't recieve the message from avast... i will keep in touch"
,omarrrio,2012-04-20T17:59Z,"the warning is always poping up , any fix to that plz ?"
,mada8967,2012-04-20T18:42Z,dose stop the avast message saying pirated version. thanks
,mada8967,2012-04-20T18:43Z,"does this stop the message saying pirated version.
thanks"
,vonwisdom,2012-04-21T03:15Z,Awesome thank you
,nyao,2012-04-21T04:48Z,I changed to the Avira Free Antivirus + COMODO firewall. COMODO have sandbox they are like a avast.
,telepirat,2012-04-21T17:24Z,"I have Avast 7.0.1426 and whatever licence I put I get a message after a few hours that I'm using an illegal (pirated) version and that it will be shut down. Now I put this Oct 2013 licence and it said it was good, but there's a problem - firewall is still off and unavailable. All the other services are active. Will try Nod32."
,theedud,2012-04-21T20:27Z,Working for me so far with 6.0.1000.  Somehow Avast managed to update the program and I was getting the pirated version nagscreen; clean reinstall and this key seems to make it happy again.  
,DarthXP,2012-04-21T23:58Z,Thanks for the feedback guys. :)  The current Internet Security key for Oct 18 2013 does NOT bring the nag screen. I do not know about the rest. Please continue to seed and comment! THANK YOU
,telepirat,2012-04-22T05:41Z,"I gave up on Avast and switched to NOD32. I don't know which one is better but the NOD32 torrent has a crack, not a licence, which makes more sense. So if you still can't get Avast to work I'd recommend this:

,romeodiggz00,2012-04-23T10:37Z,"even if the ""illegal copy"" thing still pops up there wouldn't be any problem in terms of protection from viruses right?"
,wackyr34,2012-04-23T22:35Z,it works i just gEt tired of illegal warning
,DarthXP,2012-04-24T05:14Z,"Yes even if the illegal message pops up it still works. I don't know what telepirat problem is but it has nothing to do with my keys. Yes the program protects from viruses. YES, YOU CAN UPDATE THE PROGRAM!!! Please continue to seed! :)"
,lebanesecheese2,2012-04-24T09:06Z,thanks bro :)
,singh11,2012-04-25T17:17Z,"thanks bhai darthxp 
great working my is 7.0.1426 , i will get 544 days remaining. (mast lisence hai bhai ) we love u yarr"
,LSO44,2012-04-26T23:32Z,Just got a notice about it being an illegal version when using the first key for internet security.
,idkeither,2012-04-26T23:52Z,"is avast cracking down on this? cuz i just got the pop up agian for these, but i had it since they were out. or is it more then 1 person registering to avast with these keys?"
,CrocoDuck,2012-04-27T06:30Z,"They all got detected.
It was good while it lasted"
,prabho,2012-04-27T10:08Z,"thank you bro
it's working"
,Carrot_Bottom,2012-04-27T23:34Z,THANKS
,spunkster,2012-04-28T18:14Z,"This works for a few hours or a few days but eventually it keeps popping up with the error ""illegal copy"" or whatever. Does anyone have a real crack instead of these bullshit licenses? "
,revolver75,2012-04-28T20:57Z,ye didnt last long have been through all of them now they last a few hrs before legal waring pops up again so there all dead.
,soulcoma,2012-05-01T04:25Z,"@telepirat: Happened to me, too. Then I realized that some of those keys are for Avast Pro and it changes the file structure. Simply go to Unistall and choose Repair. It will re-install the Firewall files. (Doesn't stop the pop-ups, though). Keep an eye out in the licenses for Pro or IS. They are mixed and labelled wrong sometimes."
,Ordinaryme,2012-05-02T20:20Z,"soulcoma- i tried your advice. It doesn't let me Repair the AV to get back the firewall settings. It shows some kind of an error. Know how to get around it, or bypass it?

Thanks"
,permaponics,2012-05-08T04:30Z,well avast has finally caught on. i got the illegal version note for a month then it said it was expired. then i added a new key an upgraded to pro. that was flagged within an hour. so its time to try a new AV. yes it still works but says i have 27 days left

,CrazyAaron84,2012-07-03T22:54Z,"@nyao thats why you dont use JUST an antivirus software

i see your post also said nothing about detection rate... 'nuff said..."
