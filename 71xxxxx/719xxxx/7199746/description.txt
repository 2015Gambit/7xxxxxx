
The equilateral geometry behind Classical Mechanics 

Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Building from a simple geometric premise the quantum geometry of all Classical Mechanics is revealed.

Elaborating on a new geometric view of common mechanical terms such as mass, ENERGY, and  momentum and visualising it with the aid of equilateral geometry a clear geometric picture of the Classical mechanical forces is achieved for the first time in recorded history.

The second chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the quantum geometry of Classical Mechanics and Forces as described by Newton.
