WHATS SO FUNNY about the first prepper

1) why woyld you buy dog food in tins when you
can stock pile proper meat in tins for humans

as he said if dog food is left people arent going
to worry but thats only if its the one thing left LOL
they go for the better foods first

unless hes hoping they leave the dog food
for him.. NAH.. they take it all refardless

2) he shows his hidden lair and how to open it
and his full face on the show
i kinda think think the community and neighbors will pay him a visit if they need too now :)

3) none of the shelving was quake proof.. it
throw it all of on the ground :)"
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T11:21Z,arr dam typos.. Regardless i mean
