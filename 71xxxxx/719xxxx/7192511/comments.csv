,Cakezilla,2012-04-24T22:24Z,"-Only needed seasons 6 & 7 (and the extras). But everything I've seen so far is outstanding.
-All of the seasons are .avi format.
-Extras are a little bit of every format.
-Download is VERY SLOW but definitely worth it if you're a fan.

Thanks for the upload.

,Duphapotimas,2012-08-12T18:50Z,The download speed on this torrent is fair. I was getting about 400-500KB/s. I only downloaded seasons 1-2 but I seeded about 40GB.
