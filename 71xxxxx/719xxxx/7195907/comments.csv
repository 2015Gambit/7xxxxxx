,ShockDiamond,2012-04-22T17:00Z,"Huge confusion with seasons.  This is not season 10 - it's season 9.  What previously has been marked season 9 is actually season 8 part 2, season 8 and part 1..  There are seasons 1-5, then seasons 6, 7, 8 and 9 are two-part seasons, where someone's made a bung of it along the way. :/"
