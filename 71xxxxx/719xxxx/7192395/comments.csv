The film is the love story of John (Santhosh Pandit) and Radha who are from rich families, born in different religions. They fall in love and get married against the wish of their families and had to live separated from their families. They struggled financially and were in the middle of several other problems. Two young girls Rugmini and Sreelatha came in to John's life and caused chaos in their married life. John's enemies teamed up against him to make John's and Radha's life worse. How John fought against all odds and what John had to sacrifice form the rest of the story.""Krishnanum Radhayum is way better than many films released in Malayalam; it has a solid story, and has strong continuity. Viewers will not feel bored. The heroine has acted well. The film received more centres in the following weeks and also some audience, especially youngsters Amidst criticism, Santosh Pandit and Krishnanum Radhayum received some praise for National Award winner Salim Kumar, complementing the effort and commented ""This is indeed a big achievement considering the fact that these days even superstar flicks are getting continuosly bombed at boxoffice""
