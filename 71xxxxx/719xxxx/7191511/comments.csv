,steppenwolf27,2012-04-17T15:33Z,Can someone please post an XVID version of this? My DVD player can't play mp4s.

Just a suggestion."

Are you burning all the shit you want to watch to DVD's? Damn, that's old school. Get yourself a cheap system to hook up to your TV like an Boxee,  Apple TV, Roku or something of that sort."
