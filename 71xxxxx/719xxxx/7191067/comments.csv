So by full video, i'm guessing it's not the terribad russian copy thats been floating about.

I hope it's a good copy, this film still isn't even in the cinemas in the UK till the 2nd."

,gtw1212,2012-04-17T02:58Z,"Ok I've Downloaded this.

The .avi file seems to be broken in some way, it won't open in any video player apart from VLC and even then it has to do a repair.

VLC will repair it but it's is horribly out of sync with the audio.

Overall, quality is poor but it's the best there is so far.

i dont think so. There is missing a ""big"" part of the movie."

this is only 1hour and 9 minutes long, so there is like half an hour missing on the end."
