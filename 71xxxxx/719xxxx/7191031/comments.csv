Thank you all for your comments,i had noticed yesterday when i logged on.Just finnished decorating the kitchen.
You lot seem to miss me more than my mrs,lol.
As for the survivor,i did look yesterday for this but couldn`t find anything yet,as it is new it will prob be a few weeks before it goes up somewhere so remind me again then if i don`t find it before then.
""Happy Reading!"""

Nice to see you back.

Thank you once again for the Fred Vargas.
