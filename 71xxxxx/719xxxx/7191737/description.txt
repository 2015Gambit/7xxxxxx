Gandalf Murphy & The Slambovian Circus of Dreams third studio album, "THE GREAT UNRAVEL" has their trademark 'punk-classical hillbilly-floyd' brand of folk-rock, with a hefty dose of sixties psychedelia running through it all. (ie: The Great Unravel, Pushin' Up Daisies, Clear Channel, Summer's Day) Not wanting to neglect their Celtic roots, the band called on renowned uilleann pipemaker Seth Gallagher, (who recently joined The Chieftains for a few tunes at Carnegie Hall and builds pipes for the luminaries of traditional Celtic music).
