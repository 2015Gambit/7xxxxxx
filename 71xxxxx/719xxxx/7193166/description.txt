Winner of the Golden Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival in 2009, 'She, A Chinese' tells the story of a young Chinese woman, Mei, who escapes the monotony of life in a remote village, first to the excitement of nearby city Chongqing and later to the west.  In Chongqing she falls in love with a hit man whose past tragically catches up with him, and with the money he leaves she impulsively travels to London.

London turns out to be tough, not the place of her dreams, and even harder as an illegal immigrant.

The director Xialu Guo has already proven herself as a writer with such novels as 'A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers' and '20 Fragments of a Ravenous Youth'.  Now she shows that she is a confident and creative film maker.
