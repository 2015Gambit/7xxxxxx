thanks for this classic sci fi - in 1080 as well--
a great choice "
,azeramath,2012-07-10T21:46Z,"this is not in 1080, its in 800p cause it says 1920x800, if it was in 1080 it would be 1920x1080, so this is a LIE and alainpain you need to start checking your resolutions more often then. But it is a great movie but im looking for the true 1080 version"
