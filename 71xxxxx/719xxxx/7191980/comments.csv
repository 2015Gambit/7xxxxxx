,BostonAl2012,2012-04-22T16:26Z,"Why is the English version taking so long? It seems to get uploaded and deleted~~~Does that mean FAKE?

[T],immagical,2012-04-23T23:32Z,"@BostonAl2012,

most likely if a torrent is up and suddenly dissapears, it probably has been a ""fake"" and the mods/staff have took it down of the bay."

Why is the English version taking so long?

uhhhh the movie wasn't released until the 27th. I think a better question is ""Why haven't you taken a camcorder to a theater and risked being arrested so you can upload it for us?"""
,kimitybk,2012-04-29T04:00Z,"Inspite of Russian audio it's very good. And for CAMRip it's good quality too. To our american friends- according to Kinopoisk.ru premiere of ""The Raven"" in USA will be 4/27/12. So english audio will be soon))))"
,MethuselahMr,2012-04-29T07:02Z,Russian =( but English isn't far behind you are correct
,dervqeiq,2012-04-30T18:37Z,"Yeah,  this copy sucks, an American film in Russian? Got an English version tho at freemovie.macwallpapers.eu go check it out dude!"
,bad446999,2012-05-01T03:23Z,I cant believe there is no english version yet WTF!

,klereuk,2012-05-11T21:08Z,Its not under The Raven Its Under Poe
,ummn00,2012-05-12T03:21Z,It's odd this movie is taking so long to come out in English.   If I had a camcorder I'd do it myself and probably do a better job than most of the cams that are put out When it comes to video I'm a bit of a perfectionist plus there are 2 drive in theaters near which means TS the first time.
,Caddymann64,2012-05-14T23:29Z,This Movie is taking forever to reach the U.S.
,Shizty,2012-05-15T02:55Z,could u put this up in english?
