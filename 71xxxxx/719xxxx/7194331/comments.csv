,krikri3,2012-04-19T23:10Z,"people, please learn
the original bluray is 1920x1080 resolution. this was reduced to 1920x800, so it is a BLURAY-RIP (BDRIP).

Don't come at me with the ""I cut the horizontal black bars"" shit, cuz even if these were present (which is NOT ALWAYS the case), its size would pretty much be zeroed by the h264 compression!"
