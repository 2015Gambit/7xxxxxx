Overview: A second collection of 24 books about Biggles and his aviation adventures written between 1932 and 1942
"Biggles" (nickname for James Bigglesworth), a pilot and adventurer, is the title character and main hero of the Biggles series of young adult oriented adventure books written by W. E. Johns.
He first appeared in the story "The White Fokker", published in the first issue of Popular Flying magazine, in 1932. The first collection of Biggles stories, The Camels are Coming, was published that same year. The series was continued until the author's death in 1968, eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes ΓÇô including novels and short story collections ΓÇô most, but not all, of the latter with a common setting and time frame.
While the purpose of the Biggles stories was to entertain adolescent boys, in the First World War Biggles stories Johns paid attention to historical detail and helped recreate the primitive days of early air combat ΓÇö when pilots often died in their first combat and before devices such as respirators and parachutes had become practical.
