Bob Marley & The Wailers
December 05, 1976
Smile Jamaica Concert
National Stadium, Kingston, Jamaica

Here's a nice piece of reggae history. This is the only known video of Bob Marley performing at the Smile Jamaica concert in front of 80,000 people in 1976. You all know the history of the shooting that took place days before this concert and how Bob performed anyway. At the very end of the show, Bob opens his shirt to show his bandages before walking off the stage.

This has nice menus and an extra feature of some photos showing the whole scene of the show. It was definately a massive event.

Share freely and enjoy!
