This is Angela Tucker's 2011 documentary (A)sexual, a documentary about the formation of the asexual community with a particular focus on David Jay and the Internet organization he founded -- AVEN, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network, the first web site dedicated to the asexual community, currently located at asexuality.org. The asexual community hopes to foster dialogue about the sexual orientation of asexuality, defined by a lack of sexual attraction to other people, and related identities. The documentary features both members of the asexual community and people from outside the community (including well-known sex columnist Dan Savage), who react to it with everything from bewilderment to open hostility to enthusiastic support.
