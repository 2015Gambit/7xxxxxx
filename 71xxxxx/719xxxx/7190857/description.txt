The Complete Francis Hancock Mystery Collection - Barbara Nadel

All from CD. 48 kbps / 44 kHz Mono, Fraunhofer CBR MP3.
All are narrated by Martyn Read.




This excellent crime series is set in West Ham in the East End of London during The Blitz (1940) and features undertaker Francis Hancock, a half-Indian shell-shocked Great War veteran.

Barbara Nadel's sense of time and place is outstanding. We really do experience something of what it was like to live through those terrifying days of the London Blitz, and the mysteries themselves are good also.

The sympathetic portrayal of the lives and customs of the people rings true, and all in all this is a most satisfying mystery series.
