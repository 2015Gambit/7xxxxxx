All you gotta do is extract and put in the 2 folders from 29c in the DD folder. All we need now is more players here... Everyone else is on the SKIDROW version -.-"

By th way, I'll upload Patch as soon as new will be realesed. So at April 26/27 wait for 7.30.

,Donzko,2012-04-20T15:14Z,"Sweet, thank you Kompas."
,alexgr000,2012-04-20T17:16Z,it s game spy?
,Donzko,2012-04-20T18:14Z,"Yeah, you gotta use GameSpy make an account and you can play online :)"
,crazyedex,2012-04-20T18:28Z,You can go online but I see 0 rooms most of the time. Max I saw was 3
,alexgr000,2012-04-20T19:41Z,because i have this =>http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6756474/Dungeon_Defenders-SKIDROW and its steam and i cant change it
,alexgr000,2012-04-20T19:45Z,how i do the update?
,kompas909,2012-04-20T21:57Z,"For gamespy:
 Open the dundefconfig.exe in the binaries folder, at the bottom it says online platform, pick the gamespy option!

o aply patch is quite easy. Extract 7.28c, when oon top of him extract update."
,alexgr000,2012-04-21T03:27Z,yes but it writ me can't save configurasion files 
,kompas909,2012-04-21T11:02Z,"If there is any command/action left without any bindings, it wont save your changes. I had the same thing happen.

So try again and make sure to put a keybinding for every command/action."
,Donzko,2012-04-21T22:40Z,"Remember to also trying ""Run as Administrator"" by right clicking it worked for 2 of my friends. 
Your progress, characters, weapons, everything, are in the file ""Binaries/Win32/DunDefHeroes.dun"". Copy and paste that in to the same place of newer versions when you update ;)"
,Arcardo,2012-04-24T01:20Z,"Thank you, very very easy. Will play and eagerly await whenever the new version is out."
,Jawshewah,2012-04-24T01:29Z,Is this the full game or just the update? I'm on 7.12E from THETA still.
,Donzko,2012-04-24T02:36Z,full game + update ;)
,xDV8x,2012-04-24T04:04Z,"Game works perfectly, only issue I have is the Dev Kit does not work...but it doesn't work on any cracked release yet(as far as I have seen)."
,NotOurKing,2012-05-01T17:59Z,"Is DunDefConfig.exe the only way to launch the game, or am I missing something?"
,kompas909,2012-05-01T20:18Z,"Dungeon DefendersBinariesWin32DunDefGame.exe

You should launch from there"
,NotOurKing,2012-05-01T21:56Z,Thank you Kompas. I didn't think to look there.
,kompas909,2012-05-01T22:12Z,No problem mate :)
,m4ttbt,2012-05-05T18:58Z,can someone tell me how to install this because i don't see an iso file
,kompas909,2012-05-06T10:34Z,"you don't need iso file. Just use winrar, or 7zip to extract the game from archive, and play it :)"
,5proCent,2012-05-19T22:10Z,"Hey guys.
Did/do some of you play this game throug Hamachi? If so, do you have a pc/network setup tutorial?
5proCent"
,Matthewedwin,2012-07-24T13:18Z,"It does not work for me, I think i am just doing this all wrong, i got the torrent, and it has two rar  files v7.28c and update 7.28c to 7.29c 
i go to binarieswin32dundefgame on each one and it doesent work, it just says that application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect, i keep trying and trying and nothing is working."
