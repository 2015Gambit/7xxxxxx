,XxBaka_NekoxX,2012-04-20T13:16Z,Cried so bad in the end.. One of my favourite characters.
,Slayer_ch,2012-04-22T07:54Z,Thanks so much for all the episodes. Love you. But would it be possible to have better picture quality? 115MB for 20 minutes is not looking very good.
,whmxtra,2012-04-22T09:13Z,"Slayer these aren't my rips for Dance Academy. Most of the eps I uploaded came from a Korean source and were HQ but with subtitles.

That source has stopped making rips available now that Australia has caught up and passed them.

So my only source is a friend in Australia who has zero experience in ripping or encoding and also has a crappy computer.

So unless and until I can find a better source it's all I can do, which is better than nothing as none of the scene ppl ever cover this show (which for those who care has been renewed for a 3rd season now).

I do what I can to at least provide something watchable, even though I prefer to do my own HD rips for most things that is not possible where I live (at least not for this show).

As it is I already have the last 2 eps from this season, but I haven't uploaded them yet because they are even worse. They are watchable but LQ and there's some stuttering with the audio and/or video in some places (someone ripped them from netf*ix and not very well I might add). So I'm waiting till my own source at least can do them, which won't be till Monday and Tuesday as that's when they air in Australia."
,Slayer_ch,2012-04-22T09:31Z,Thanks for all the info. I live in Switzerland so there is now way I can rip the Australian channels. :-) Otherwise I would be able to capture them in HD. By the way THANKS for the info about the 3rd Season. Was not aware of that.
,whmxtra,2012-04-22T20:44Z,"I have the same issue, although I'm Australian I live in Canada now so I can't rip them either. And even though I have a NetF*ix account being in Canada I still can't access the last two eps directly and make my own rips.

Wish I could but options are limited for this show. What I'll probably do is upload the last two eps in LQ for those that absolutely can't wait to see what happens then upload the better but still not great rips my friend sends me when the eps air in Australia this week.

Won't have a true HD source for this till it comes out on DVD, then I can make new rips of the whole season. Till then I do what I can :)

And yes, nice to know a season 3 is coming (just found out myself last night), catch there is it was 2 years from season 1 till season 2 came out so there's no telling how long we'll have to wait to get season 3 (fingers crossed hehe)."
,karaoky,2012-04-24T10:30Z,"Can you pls upload the last 2 episodes, even in LQ, you can remove them later when you have them in a better quality. Thank you!"
,whmxtra,2012-04-24T20:58Z,"I opted to wait because the LQ and video stutter in those versions completely ruined several key moments, I have better versions now and I will be uploading the last two eps shortly."
,karaoky,2012-04-24T21:39Z,"hurry, HURRY!!!    :P"
,whmxtra,2012-04-24T23:23Z,"Eps 25 and 26 now up. Bring tissues, there will be tears. And now begins the long wait for season 3 :)"
