QM 07 - Quarks

The Tetryonic [12pi] equilateral geometry resulting from oppositely charged fascia in Fermions in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

The attractive geometries formed by Matter quanta as it forms Fermion Matter through quantum mechanical interactions are revealed.

With sub-elemental Tetryonic charges of [-8,-4,0,+4,+8] a geometric foundation is paved for the understanding of Quark geometries and their role in subatomic Matter for the first time in recorded history.

The seventh chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to Quark geometries.
