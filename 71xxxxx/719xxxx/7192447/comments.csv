,fushimoze,2012-04-23T13:09Z,"thx for this downloading it now. But the torrent says kurohyou which would be from the Yakuza-Series. Which one is it now? I don't mind either way, but this confusion should be explained"
,fushimoze,2012-04-23T15:09Z,Just checked it...it's neither Dynasty Warriors nor a full game. It's the demo for Kurohyou 2
