Winner of the 1983 National Book Award, The Mathematical Experience presented a highly insightful overview of mathematics that effectively conveyed its power and beauty to a large audience of mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike. The study edition of the work followed about a decade later, supplementing the original material of the book with exercises to provide a self-contained treatment usable for the classroom. This softcover version reproduces the study edition and includes epilogues by the three original authors to reflect on the book's content 15 years after its publication, and to demonstrate its continued applicability to the classroom. Moreover, The Companion Guide to the Mathematical Experience—originally published and sold separately—is freely available online to instructors who use the work, further enhancing its pedagogical value and making it an exceptionally useful and accessible resource for a wide range of lower-level courses in mathematics and mathematics education. A wealth of customizable online course materials for the book can be obtained from Elena Anne Marchisotto (elena.marchisotto@csun.edu) upon request.
