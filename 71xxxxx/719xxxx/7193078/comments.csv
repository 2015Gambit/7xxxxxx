,largedcup,2012-04-19T00:29Z,"You got your ass spanked because you discovered the space bar key and attempted to make everyone's life miserable. People politely complained and you did not listen- so the computer gods came down on you- and now you are acting like a complete turd by advertising some other site- which of course is totally against the rules.

Stop being such a total turd and just post screens HERE, for each posting, just like millions of other people do on a minute by minute basis. And use a good site just displays the screens and not attempt to load malware- such as what the God mentioned- http://bayimg.com/

Everyone, including you will once again be happy if you just go with the program and not stand out as a problem. We don't want you banned- we just want you to do what you used to do before you discovered the space bar and decided to become a big fat turd and bug everyone- including the Gods.  

For a reminder:

please stop with bad img hosts and finding lame ways to get around the block.
This is simple warning, if you keep up with this you will soon find your account demoted. If you still do not get the hint and keep going, you will get your acc banned with all your torrents removed.

if you want a img host then there is plenty clean ones.
here is one:
