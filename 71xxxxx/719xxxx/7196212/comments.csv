you are right game is bugged... found on steam forums that they removed the game and waiting for update to fix the bug!! crack good... game no good"
,fb92z,2012-04-19T02:40Z,"The bug is actually a developer block against cracking, we'll just wait for an update/fix from ""SKIDROW"" probably not too long I'm guessing, the gameplay is not bad, no bugs in it so far, I find it free of choice how to defeat the monsters, powers are interesting, it's like Kratos and that other playstation title where a woman is lead character had a baby together, this would have to be it, thanks for uploading and thank you ""SKIDROW"" for cracking."

,mek01,2012-04-19T05:10Z,"My game runs without problems, but i got stuck in the part after when you press the button to open the big gate. To get out i should open the door with the rotating mechanism, but i press E and then proceed to press LMB repeatedly as usual but no matter how i do it, it just drops the door at the end. 

I just tested again with a controller but no matter what, the door gears start opening and drop at the end, similar to when you stop pressing the button (which i don’t)."
,mek01,2012-04-19T05:15Z,"Dammit i should read the comments before posting, so it seems other have the door problem too. I was just looking if someone else had that problem and if it was a crack problem, but now i know. 

So it seems a developer problem, i'm really surprised how a game breaking bug like this one ended up in the game after release."

Wrong version of Blades of Time in Steam‏

Ivan Rybalko

Add to contacts
Good afternoon,

There was a totally unexpected confusion with the Blades of Time distribution files, currently available in Steam, which are of an old version, most likely to be stuck during the first level.

Therefore its keys were removed from the shop for selling and will be added as soon as the problem is solved. The correct version should be available with an update coming during 24 hours.

We apologize for the caused troubles and hope for understanding.

You can try it but if game crashes at the start may be just another problem and need another solution. By the way neither have a proper description. (100% WORK LOL!)
