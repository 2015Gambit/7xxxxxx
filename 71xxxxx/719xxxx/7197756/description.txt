The most talked-about  Czech gaming studio in the last couple of years are preparing the release of one another beautifully attractive point & click adventure: Botanicula.
The “organic” title, and personal project of one of Amanita Design’s members: Jaromír Plachý, will give you the control over 5 plants, stick insects or… botanical creatures that while wondering around their own ecosystem (a big tree) will try to stop dark spiders who seem to be sucking the life out of everything they encounter.
