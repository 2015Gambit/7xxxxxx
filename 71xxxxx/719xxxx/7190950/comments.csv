Anyone checked the other episodes?"
,infiniphonic,2012-04-20T00:11Z,There are only twelve episodes in the third season. All the releases i have seen have been way off as far as the numbering of episodes in their respective seasons. I got them all but had to go to the HC website and sort through everything as to have every episode in the right order.
,lobo345,2012-04-24T19:39Z,"Looks like the original uploader vanished. I've been downloading single episode torrents and then added them to this torrent.

It would be nice if someone else downloaded episodes 8 to 15 and added them here. I've got kind of slow internet so it might take a while for me..."

,lobo345,2012-04-26T18:28Z,Thanks! :D
