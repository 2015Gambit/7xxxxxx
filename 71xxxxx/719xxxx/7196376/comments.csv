,agungsp2000,2012-04-19T06:35Z,thanks yify !
,u.duwadi,2012-04-19T13:22Z,"YIFI - all your rips have great video quality but terrible audio qualities. May be your can extend a little size and make both audio and video the best. If someone can download 1.4GB movie, he won't mind to download another 200MB extra for best audio quality.
Thank you advance!"
,Sgt.MoFo,2012-04-20T03:50Z,how the hell do you manage to get a 1080p rip into 1.4 gb of size without losing that pic quality
,fofo141,2012-04-20T04:43Z,"Thank you so much YIFY Team 
and special thanks to Sundox"
,blasterpierre,2012-04-20T13:36Z,"Dear YIFY, I admire your torrents so much, but is there any way you can make 720p file but with a better sound quality? let's say 5.1 channel 48Khz with 256Kbps bitrate. I'm sure it'll still have less file size than the 1080p torrents you've uploaded.

It'll make the home cinema experience a lot better ;)

Thanx, u're the best!"
,FaTh3r_25,2012-04-20T20:20Z,"can somebody tell me if this upload have the same problem when u out it on the PS3 i apreciate if somebody can tell me cuz i don't wan't to spend time in download this one if got that problem..

,Neokidoji,2012-04-23T03:16Z,Has anyone else been experiencing chipmunk audio on ps3 with yify latest releases? I've been having this happen with everything from last few weeks. Run fine on 360. 
,beboroch,2012-04-24T15:25Z,"hey just wanna say a big thank you for the great job you have been doing. i was hoping for the 3d version of this from the YIFY team, however this will do for now."
