going to assume this is the program ""top shot"" Why does this program seem to have two names? Most curious."
,Dantar12,2012-04-19T05:44Z,"This is NOT Top Shot, this is sort of a sister show to Top Shot where they examine 3 guns of a certain category and talk about the pros and cons and shoot them all. Generally they are the same guns that will be used in that weeks episode of Top Shot."

they have similar titles though which confuses people this week"
,Dantar12,2012-04-19T08:40Z,"Much respect to psspss, you bring good quality torrents and are by far the best uploader of the less main stream stuff like Canadian Pickers. Keep it up man, we have the same taste."
