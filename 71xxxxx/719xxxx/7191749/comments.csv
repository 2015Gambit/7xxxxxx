,ex5bn,2012-04-19T10:33Z,"Never mind that it doesn't get to 100%. I renamed the 99.94% complete file as a .rar and used UnRarX to opened it which worked fine!

You'll need to download the Waves v9r2 offline installer from their website and use it to install just the single NLS plugin on top of Assign or DYNAMiC's Waves Complete bundle. Then just replace the NLS.bundle file with the one in this torrent.

Great plugin! I'll seed it for another week or so."
