Narratives:

Backroad Records' high-powered duo The Lacs are now serving up their intoxicating blend of southern rap and rock on their sophomore album, 190 Proof. The highly anticipated release includes collaborations with country music stars Big & Rich, as well as platinum selling rapper Bubba Sparxxx, and new artist Crucifix.

Taking the partying, country mud truckin' lifestyle to the next level, 190 Proof is creating quite a buzz with songs like "Drinks Up" "Shake It (featuring Big & Rich)" and "4 Wheel Drive." Produced by Phive Starr Productions and Shannon "Fat Shan" Houchins, 190 Proof is filled with 14 tracks of their unique inebriating mix of slinky southern guitar riffs with booming beats and rhymes about life in the dirtiest parts of the Dirty South.
