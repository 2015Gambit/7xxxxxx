I'm No Monster: The Horrifying True Story of Josef Fritzl 


The true-crime story that stunned and appalled the world. With photos and never-before-revealed information.
For 24 years Josef Fritzl held his daughter Elizabeth prisoner as a sex slave and, with her, he fathered seven of his own grandchildren. But the true depth of his depravity was yet to be uncovered in the underground bunker his children called home. Over the years, his secret family knew next to nothing of the outside world. Incredibly, Josef's submissive wife Rosemarie never suspected a thing. It was a tale so appalling, so unbelievable, it reverberated in shock waves across the globe.
In defense of his own moral character, Josef Fritzl made a stunning statement. "I'm no monster," he reasoned. "I could have just killed them and no one would have ever found out about it." With exclusive interviews, and never-before- released information, award-winning journalists Stefanie Marsh and Bojan Pancevski tell the complete story of an abominable crime.
