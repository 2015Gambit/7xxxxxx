   Using ex-SAS men, this is a detailed recreation of a typical close      
                         protection mission.                               
     SAS team is assigned to protect a British Minister on a foreign       
     state visit. Initially the team's meticulous planning pays off,       
      but they are overruled on security by local forces. When the         
      Minister and foreign leaders are kidnapped, the team must don        
             their 'Black Kit' and launch a rescue mission.
