,joedoekoe,2012-04-19T11:09Z,"ipullin: thanks; seeding is needed for bit torrent. Lot's of leeching on this one tho :-(
I always seed twice i got at the least."
,go6ovei,2012-04-19T18:48Z,"The same like DP2,only 64 support with 5kext-32bit.
WARNING-NO MORE arch=i386."
,ofekinger,2012-04-19T19:40Z,"DOESN'T WORK!!!!
I installed it but after I've restarted my mac to complete the installation process it kept crashing and I had to restore it from an older backup...
Please release the fixed version so we can install it on our Macs properly."
,go6ovei,2012-04-19T21:02Z,"ofekinger-This work like sharm,dont needed Fixed version,your Mac is?"
,Arsventure,2012-04-19T22:31Z,"Didn't work for me in Parallels.

Anybody else have any luck?
"
,warmthhhh,2012-04-20T01:04Z,Way smoother than DP2 so far. Seems the laggy animations and resetting wallpaper issues are fixed. Two of the most annoying from the previous build.
,sierrajuanm,2012-04-20T06:28Z,seed!!!! plsss
,ofekinger,2012-04-20T12:16Z,go6ovel - I had to wait 4.5 hours to restore it from backup... it kept shutting down my iMac...
,go6ovei,2012-04-20T16:32Z,"ofekinger-Get Carbon Copy Cloner for fast restore,my restored point is a 50gb for 10min"
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-04-24T08:38Z,Where is the sharedsupport folder so I can create a bootable usb? I want a clean install like on the previous previews. Something's wrong here
,go6ovei,2012-04-24T09:55Z,vitor.fernandes1983-Open dmg. with hidden files and restore Base system dmg.after copy Packages folder
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-04-24T21:41Z,"Well I just did upgrade instead of clean nstallation, helll, I think thats even better, nothing was lost, feels like a new instalation anyways, smooth as hell, only one app was not compatible, transmit, everything else perfect, using ssd, you have to reactivate the trim again. Thank you for this. I guess this is as fast as it can ever be, no way they can make it faster."
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-04-24T21:47Z,"I did the upgrade instead of clean installation. Everything working perfectly, smooth as hell. No issues at all, just have to enable trim again for the SSD. Only one app was not compatible now, Transmit which I used to FTP PS3 games."
,richard94,2012-04-28T07:46Z,"Hi everyone, I want to just upgrade from OSX Lion to this, will this cause any issues with updating apps or buying the real ting when it is released in July?
Cheers "

,LNG33,2012-05-15T08:16Z,"downloaded this the day it came out only to have it crash and burn my hard drive a few days ago. lost all that was on the hard drive as i had to erase and re-format it so that it could be written on again. And so far i can't reinstall an os onto it atm. Lucky i kept my other hd with lion on it. but now the apps on it are too new for lion, so mail won't work among others, so I'm redownloading lol"
,nonukez,2012-05-18T20:52Z,"@virus.app
You lazy prick, why are you whining that no one posted a review for your benefit? If you want to know so badly, install it yourself.
Jesus, so many people (presumably kids) are so goddamn spoiled. They deserve a good beating."
,jondaven,2012-05-21T00:06Z,Is it easy to install this over an older version of osx?
,leonjoko,2012-05-25T01:36Z,Downloaded in about 1 Hour - Installed on a Partition in about 20 Minutes - Works perfectly fine! Big Thanks!
,Vid299,2012-05-27T00:25Z,"it look same as Developer Preview 1.....if its Preview 3, why i can't see that ON/OFF button in Notification area that only Preview 3 have?"
,richard94,2012-06-06T08:30Z,"I am running this mountain lion dev preview 3 with updates perfectly, great download. Just checking... does anyone know if you can upgrade this straight to the retail version?? Thanks!"
