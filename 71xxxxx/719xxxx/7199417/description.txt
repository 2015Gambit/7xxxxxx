PLOT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disheartened when his story about Canadian snipers possibly mutilating corpses 
in Afghanistan is buried, Luke (Nick Stahl) quits his job but is even more 
determined to return to Afghanistan to get the real story. With his offbeat 
buddy, Tom (Nicolas Wright), tagging along, Luke returns to Afghanistan and 
intends to gather enough evidence to get his old story into print. But he soon 
finds that the country is an even more dangerous place than when he left. To 
make matters worse, his old friend and fixer, Mateen (Stephen Lobo) has been 
hired away by Luke's journalistic nemesis, Imran Sahar (Vik Sahay). Soon the 
trip for Luke and Tom in Afghanistan turns into a surreal and perilous 
adventure, a journey into an alternate reality, filtered through a haze of 
gun smoke.
