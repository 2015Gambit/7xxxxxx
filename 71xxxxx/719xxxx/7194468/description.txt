"Let Them Drink Their Haterade  
                       (Lake Manyara, Tanzania)"

The Race takes an unexpected turn when an early 
alliance is betrayed, and an unforgiving team 
savors the opportunity to exact their revenge 
in a game twist

Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower+
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
