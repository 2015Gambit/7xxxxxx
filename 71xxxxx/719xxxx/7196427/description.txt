Dr. John - DIscography
FLAC images + CUE sheets

Compiling the discography of Dr. John is quite a feat. There are so many collaborations, Live takes, bootlegs and compilations of leaked sessions floating around. I've kept my mind on compiling the discography the man's homepage lists:

That + The brand new "Locked Down" is in the 'Official' folder, labeled by [year] of release.

In the 'Bonus' folder you will find

"Triumvirate" - A collaboration with Mike Bloomfield and John Paul Hammond from 1973

"All By Hisself" - A live/solo recording from 1986

"Funky New Orleans" - A Live collaboration with the Donald Harrison Band from 1991 (released in 2000)

"Bluesiana Triangle I + II" - A collaboration with Art Blakey and David Newmann (I) - With the passing of Art Blakey reformed to include Davud Newman, Ray Anderson, Will Calhoun, Essiet Okon Essiet, Jay Leonhart and Joe Bonadio (II).

"Loser For You Baby" - There are at least three different albums released under this title, all containing sessions that were never meant to be released - another handfull of permutations of tracks from the same tapes were released as several "Zu ZU Man" entitled albums. You will note the offbeat drummer and general poor sound quality. 

I've Included the scans I've been able to come by in the folder of the same name.
