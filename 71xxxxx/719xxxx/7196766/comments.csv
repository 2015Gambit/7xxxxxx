Tha movie has bad aspect ratio. "
,TsarB0mba,2012-04-19T10:33Z,"FYI it is watchable if you set the aspect ratio to 4:3 and then crop that to 16:9, but you're losing a lot of resolution from an already low-res rip. Can't win 'em all ettv. :)"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-19T22:03Z,"it's not ettv's fault.. it's TRANSiENCE - whoever that is... this has been nuked by scene as it is an analog source and not digital

if MOMENTUM doesn't get a release for this out soon then I'll post a real HDTV release on Monday when the episode re-airs"
