QM 04 - EM fields

The equilateral geometry behind all Electro-Magnetic fields as derived in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Applying Electric Permittivity and Magnetic Permeability to the equilateral geometry of mass-ENERGY a clear understanding of the geometric relationships behind EM fields is developed

Elaborating on the classical and Tetryonic  interpretations of Quantised Angular Moment, a clear geometric understanding  of the origin of Charge is presented along with the EM various relationships for the first time in recorded history.

The first four in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometry of EM fields that form the foundation off Tetryonics - the Science of the new millennia.
