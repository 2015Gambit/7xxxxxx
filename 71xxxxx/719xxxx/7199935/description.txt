QM 05 ΓÇô Bosons

The transverse equilateral geometry of Bosons in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Building on the equilateral geometry of EM fields ΓÇô the ODD numbered TRANVERSE EM geometries of Bosons forming the geometry of Quantum levels is revealed.

The geometry of Bosons and its relationship to CHARGE is explored along with their relationship to SCALAR square Energy momenta for the first time in recorded history.

The fifth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an overview of Bosons and transverse EM energies in the Science of the new millennia.
