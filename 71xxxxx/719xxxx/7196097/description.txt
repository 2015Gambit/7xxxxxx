This is almost my favorite Mike Leigh movie, so considering Secret & Lies is a classic, you can guess why I bother..

I'm not one for synopsys. I'll just say this is a must watch, tough you might not want to watch it when you're deep in melancholia.

Technical aspects :

The video was encoded according to AVCHD specifications so I guess a DVD-R readable by your Blu-Ray player is doable.

Picture :

The source is HD DVB-T, tough the quality was inferior to a potential BluRay, yet still much better than DVD (also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted!).

Very few and almost unnoticable imperfections because of the reception (which was close to perfect), they should not be a concern.
