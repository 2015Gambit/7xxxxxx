,kadicel,2012-04-22T05:06Z,thank you for uploading this eztv but community is going down the shitter ruining this show :((((((((
,NinpoLore,2012-05-17T23:58Z,"kadicel - Nice try, but Community is better than ever. You dislike the show now because it's moving away from the self-contained, pop-culture inspired format of seasons one and two, but the writing has just gotten smarter. All those references that made you feel so smart when you watched it are still there, except now the characters don't tell you that they just made a reference.

My defense of the most amazing comedy of the past five years aside, thank you eztv! Awesome upload."
