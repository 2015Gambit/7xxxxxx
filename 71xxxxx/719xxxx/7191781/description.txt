I took a pdf of "Unintended Consequences" by John Ross, ran it through OmniPage Professional(ocr program), and used the result to create an unencrypted .prc file that works with any kindle reader or kindle app. 

The result is a very readable kindle reader file that may have a few incorrectly scanned letters. Much, much better than a pdf if you use a smaller screen reader.


"Unintended Consequences is a novel by author John Ross, first published in 1996 by Accurate Press. The lengthy (863 pages) story chronicles the history of the gun culture, gun rights and gun control in the United States from the early 1900s through the late 1990s. The story is heavily laced with accurate historical information, including real-life figures who play minor supporting roles. The novel also features unusually detailed and intricate facts, figures and explanations of many firearms-related topics. "
