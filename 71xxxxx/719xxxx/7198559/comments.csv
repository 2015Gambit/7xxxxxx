Can you tell I'm excited?

Many thanks to HeroMaster and Wendy99.  I'm stuck in a care facility.  Luckily I have a laptop and a wireless connect, otherwise I'd be more insane than I am.  As I have 60 dollars discretionary cash each month (that has to cover sodas, snacks, and pizza when the institutional food gets too horrific) you have been a godsend.  I no longer have to spend a chunk of my limited funds on gaming sites.  You're doing a humanitarian service, people.  Seriousely."
