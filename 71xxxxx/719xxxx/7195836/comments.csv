[H],HeroMaster,2012-04-18T19:10Z,ENJOY Kingdom of Amalur Reckoning Teeth of Naros DLC New it needs the original Game by SKIDROW!
,beso140,2012-04-18T20:47Z,hero plz put here sniper v2 demo plzzzzz
,Sky_block,2012-04-18T23:03Z,Do i really need the skidrow KoAR original game can't i use the THETA upload? (theta has an included installer and i'm super lazy -_-) also worried bout my saves
,kaslyn,2012-04-18T23:20Z,"@Skyblock its easier to have the skidrow original game, if you want to keep the THETA you'll have to manually find the install for the game when it asks you to, and you'll have to move your saves"
,KidRapper,2012-04-19T03:39Z,Thanx. Was waiting for this.:)

,oorenotsoo,2012-04-19T17:12Z,"Thanks a bunch HeroMaster. About to finish Dead Kel and I've been looking forward to this one. 

Also, glad to see the images on imgur instead of those other places. I hope it becomes to norm."
,BuMbAh,2012-04-19T18:48Z,ive got it installed and played it it looks great and works fine ty skidrow
,stekko,2012-04-19T18:51Z,"htdeagle, check the path of the installer.
By degfault is c:program files/EA gamesKingdom...

If you instaled the original game in diferent path it wouldn't work. I just have the same issue, but after instaling in the right directoy it worked."
,nico356a,2012-04-19T19:48Z,so is it possible to use it with the THETA?
,Sky_block,2012-04-19T20:03Z,@nico356a yes it is possible i did it and it works but i can't find where the skidrow game puts the saves and now i'm lvl 3 was lvl 34 -_-
,Sky_block,2012-04-19T20:20Z,can't find the place where the SKIDROW saves are plz help
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-04-19T20:34Z,"@ Sky_block:
The path of the saved games of Skidrow releases is this: 

X:Users-YOUR USER NAME-AppDataLocalSKIDROW

(where ""X"" is the drive of your windows installation)

Make sure that you have all your folders/files visible (done via Folder Options/View) as the AppData folder may be hidden. Also if you have installed many Skidrow games you may find many sub-folders in your ...LocalSKIDROW  folder. If this is the case just check to see which sub-folder is related to the Kindgoms Of Amalur.

Hope this helps..."
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-04-19T20:37Z,"for some reason my comment entered wrongly, 
the path is: 

X : Users / -YOUR USER NAME- / AppData / Local / SKIDROW"
,mllo0oky,2012-04-20T01:30Z,"DONE
nice game"
,ckraven,2012-04-20T02:14Z,"if we have the THETA version we need to ""save"" the saves and then copy them to the new SKIDROW folder? because if thats the case then there is a bigger issue to deal with . All my SKIDROW save games are in files with numbered files like 930,22560,22370 etc and i dont know which is which. And where are the THETA saves anyway  :)"
,nico356a,2012-04-20T15:02Z,i do exacly what u say i need to do in the guide but when im done with that and i copy the files from the SKIDROW folder its the same! when i get into the game nothing have changed and it still says Teeth of Naros DLC is available now! someone please help me thanks :)
,nico356a,2012-04-20T15:16Z,nevermind i got it to work now and OMG thanks for the upload^^
,macfly59,2012-04-21T10:31Z,"install the game

sorry for my english ;)"
,ometecuhtli,2012-04-22T03:27Z,"Hello guys, for all who have problems with this, I played the game now and even tho it doesnt say the DLC is working on the main login it does, after playing around 30 min you'll get the first DLC quest.   Good luck!"
,Leolus109,2012-04-22T08:18Z,Why is the img for KoA:R The Legend of Dead Kel used?
,HSuperV,2012-04-22T16:01Z,Can somebody tell me if you can put the camera distance a little bit farther??? And also if you can lock a target when using a bow???
,Peanutt010,2012-04-22T23:11Z,Thank you HeroMaster... you the .. well uhh... master :)
,Peanutt010,2012-04-22T23:13Z,"o and @ HSuperV  
Nope m8, unfortunately the camera is fixed that way. You can press | (above enter) for over shoulder view but thats even worse then default cam.
Also theres no lock'on."
,CitrusFruit,2012-04-24T21:08Z,"After hours of painstakingly trying to figure out why this wasn't working during the install phase, I figured out that you have to upgrade the version first haha.  Just thought I'd post this in case anybody else has a minor brain fart."
,Sunny16,2012-05-02T17:09Z,"Thank you, HM. :) "
,dolfijn96,2012-05-04T17:11Z,"Does anyone know if this download works if you don't have the original game, but the cracked version of Skidrow?"
,Djents,2012-05-12T10:37Z,"I tried to move my saves to the skidrow folder in the appdata, but it doesn't do anything when i load the game, just wants me to make a new profile. so i do. then i restart the game and it wants me to make another one."
,3BDRR7MAN,2012-05-18T20:17Z,Will this work for Theta?
,Gumbwa,2012-07-14T23:38Z,"At certain points during this DLC quest line my computer keeps suddenly restarting. When I use a ""primal magic"" item, and lately when groups of sprites appear in front of me. Can anyone offer explanation/help?"
,dasnawq789,2012-07-16T19:39Z,"do i need to finish the reckoning 1st then play this patch?
or can i just install this add-on??
and do i need to patch the KoA 1st to have this add-on?
sory broken english"
,estneked,2012-07-19T21:25Z,"pls help me, i got both this and the other dlc, both from here, i made back up saves, at least i copied all files from C/user/me/Docs./Mygames/Koar folder, but when i paste them back, nothing happens in-game, cant load previous game T_T got a win 7, pls some1 help me"
,CommonsCarnival,2012-07-25T06:55Z,"Has anyone got this to work with the Theta version and if so, could you please provide instructions? Thank you. Truly appreciate it. Kingdoms of Amalur truly has to be on of the best games of 2012 thus far. Too bad 38 Studios went bankrupt; I heard they were working on an MMO version of the game?"
,AustinH69,2012-07-26T14:57Z,It installed perfectly.. But do you really have to give us all of the items immediately? I know I'm not the only one who doesn't like to cheat..
,spidaz84,2012-07-31T03:10Z,"What do you mean give the items right off?I installed perfectly and got the quest update ingame immediatly,but not the items."
,mettyuart,2012-08-07T13:39Z,This upload is a realy good one... works like it is meant to... thanks for it...
