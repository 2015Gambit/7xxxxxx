RELEASE NOTES

For decades the Kollossae, a proud people of faith and large stature,
have wandered the face of Amalur in pursuit of the destiny that is due
to them, but all does not appear right. Upon your expedition to Teeth
of Naros, Secandra and her band of Kollossae warriors require your help
to solve the riddle of the Titans. A mysterious force beckons the
Kollossae toward a destiny they may not entirely want nor are ready to
embrace.

Take on a crucible of faith filled with fantastic new enemies and
determine if you are fated to be favored by the gods or forsaken by
them. In an epic new journey filled with tons of side quests, adventure
through a paradise seen by few, and for good reason. Ascend to the
floating city above Teeth of Naros and get a glimpse into the future of
Amalur.
