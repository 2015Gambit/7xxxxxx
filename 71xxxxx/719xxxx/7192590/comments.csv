,thedudesoner,2012-04-28T12:58Z,"The torrent is a rar file I did it like this:
1. Create a new folder Called Demolition Company (I called it DC)
2. Copy the RAR into that folder.
3. Extract it using WinRAR or WinZip (I use WinRAR)
4. Open the folder called Demolition Compay (The one you extracted not the one you created)
5. Open the folder ""CD take this folder...."" 
6. Mount the ISO with PowerISO, Daemontools.
7. Run Setup in Administrator mode.  
8. Serial: 8QY3J-CPQ7Q-PM2ET-ALL83-FENMQ
9. Copy all files that under the CD folder to the installation folder."

,quinzBay,2012-05-03T03:54Z,"If you're having trouble with the game still being in German, pay attention to Step 9 of thedudesoner's instructions: ""Copy all files that under the CD folder to the installation folder.""

Copy all the files that were extracted from the bin file. into the folder where the game was finally installed, typically C:Program FilesDemolition Company."
,DjChrisEvis,2012-05-03T23:00Z,"make a folder in ure desktop. and call it DC 2011.
Then extract the winrar file in to that folder and take that folder you did make in to C: programfiles. Then, in that folder you will find a folder called CD go in to that and mount that file with Daemon tools. and you should have it on English!!!!

Ifyou know any good programs to make a Desktop video then i can make a video of it to all you guys out there"
