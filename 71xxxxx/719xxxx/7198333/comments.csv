,BostonAl2012,2012-04-20T09:51Z,V? A?  Is it worth the 4.4 gigs?  
,StaplerUk,2012-04-20T13:37Z,"It says cam2dvd, So its more than likely the cam versions already about but converted to dvd files, So not really worth the 4.36gb risk."
,BostonAl2012,2012-04-22T20:35Z,"That's what I was thinking too!  someone must be bored~~~:)

This movie is just way too busy to watch the cam version~~~You really need the DVD/BR version to appreciate it?"
