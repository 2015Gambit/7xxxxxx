elles Will Ring member Aiden Roberts finds his own voice on this whimsical, melodic and, yes, even faintly psychedelic new album of folk-infused songs. Nick Drake is an admitted reference point for Roberts, though the influence is perhaps more apparent in texture than actual sound. This was, after all, recorded in RobertsΓÇÖ Sydney home ΓÇô itΓÇÖs folk music baked with inner-city Australian sun. That said, songs like Barking Dog & Swallow occasionally bring to mind Joe BoydΓÇÖs more lush arrangements for Drake. There are acoustic-psych touches to the material, but itΓÇÖs more subtly-toned than the widescreen Byrds vistas of his day-job band. Roberts is ultimately his own man ΓÇô while itΓÇÖs inevitable parts of his record collection seep intoΓÇª
ΓÇªthe music, they never overwhelm the songs. You wonΓÇÖt find any blatant facsimiles of other artists here, not even of Belles. Instead, youΓÇÖll find a low-key selection of songs that Roberts delivers in an almost-reluctant voice ΓÇô in the wrong hands, this could sound indifferent and uncommitted, but RobertsΓÇÖ hesitance sounds vulnerable and even a little bit haunted. It adds an interesting dynamic to what are essentially sun-kissed and, at times, even vibrant songs.
