,taz420nj,2012-06-03T12:11Z,"Seriously, what is the point of RARing things anymore?  Out of terabytes of downloading, I don't think I've ever had a single file that was corrupted in the download.  Only files that were fucked from the source which a RAR piece wouldn't help anyway. We all have broadband, we don't need it broken down into pieces that can be downloaded in chunks so as not to tie up a phone line."
,taz420nj,2012-06-03T12:12Z,And for the record I am not bitching.  I am thankful to all those that do what you do to make it possible for us to enjoy.  I just don't see any point in doing the RAR thing at this day in age.
,taz420nj,2012-06-03T12:16Z,It's just an annoying extra step that takes time to unRAR it.  Kind of like how this comment was broken up into three parts when one would've been just as easy and less annoying.
