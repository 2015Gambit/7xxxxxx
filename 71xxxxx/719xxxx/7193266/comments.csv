,swisgood,2012-04-21T22:11Z,"Thanks :), dynstab2 you are by far the best textbook uploader on tpb and probably the internet!!!! (not joking)

1. you upload constantly
2. you put textbooks (and even regular books) in .pdf format (universal extension)
3. you get the best textbooks
4. textbooks about math, science mostly
5. you zipped many to conserve space and still good quality
6. bookmarked perfectly
7. better than bought kindle editions, nook editions and others because of no limitations (no passwords or limited-computer viewing)
8. Many followers, so fast downloads
9. You are educating the world with Free downloads of important subjects (as most downloaders can't buy these textbooks due to the massive, abominable price
10. Trusted uploader with amazing quality textbooks
11. Not photocopied (photocopies are hard to read and slipshod interface)

THANK YOU :)

Friendly Suggestions:
1. Please, expand your subjects to maybe humanities, foreign languages, etc.
2. Nothing, you're doing everything anyone can expect!!! (better than the bought etextbooks, no limitations and Free)

Questions:
1. Do you buy all of these expensive textbooks?
2. If not, how do you get them so all can upload to share information.

THANX AGAIN, every seeder respects & supports your hardworking ethics to help bring knowledge to everybody in the world.

I, for one, will keep seeding and supporting your constant, quality uploads!!! :)

(p.s.: please respond back on this page, thank you.)"
