Recorded on September 21, 2010 as Sting was smack dab in the middle of his Symphonicities tour, Live in Berlin -- available as a CD/DVD set, a Blu Ray, and a condensed single-disc CD -- offers further orchestral reimaginings of StingΓÇÖs songbook, retaining a healthy chunk of the songs on the 2010 album Symphonicities and finding room for other highlights from his past, both obscure and quite familiar (ΓÇ£Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Russians,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£King of Pain,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Every Breath You TakeΓÇ¥all pop up on the video). Compared to the studio album, the symphonic flourishes donΓÇÖt seem quite as overwhelming -- the attention is drawn to Sting and his songs, not to the orchestrations -- and the show is paced expertly, turning Live in Berlin into a bit of sophisticated comfort food for longtime Sting fans.
