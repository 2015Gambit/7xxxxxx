I would like to thank the original uploader of New American Language but since the torrent has disappeared I don't know who it was. Thank You! Audiochecker Log included for this rip. If anybody has anymore Dan Bern please do make available in Lossless! (DicktheSpic I'm sure you got some!) Thanks! And just to add, Tiger Woods from Fifty Eggs has to be one of my favorite songs of the 90s. Pure Brilliance!
