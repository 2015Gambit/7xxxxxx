QM 12 ΓÇô Hydrogen

The Tetryonic charged geometry of Hydrogenic particles as explained in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Resulting from the Coulombic attraction between oppositely charged elemental particles, the geometry of the Hydrogen family of particles is revealed.

Hydrogen genesis, quantum Energy storage and release is fully explained in electromechanical terms providing a scalable quantum solution to our present day Energy needs.

The twelfth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometry and possibilities of Hydrogenic particles.
