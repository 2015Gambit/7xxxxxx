In the Two Weeks in Hell, you are given a pass into the intense training and testing that determines who will be allowed to become a Green Beret candidate. Over two weeks, the most insane, mind-twisting games are played, and physical limits are stretched beyond imagination to enable the watchers to select the right individuals. During the Green Beret Two Weeks in Hell, you will see some of the most intelligent and creative individuals alive, and witness brutality of training like you have never before seen.


Two Weeks In Hell features the U.S. Army Special Forces Green Berets, America's unconventional warfare specialists. Whereas the military's focus usually is on brute-force tactics, the Green Berets rely on creative, innovative, and stealthy tactics to destabilize an enemy from within. The Green Beret Two Weeks in Hell shows that they are experts in guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and subversion. They live as the locals do, and they live by their wits. During the Special Forces Two Weeks in Hell, you can see that time and again, their tenet on how to win wars proves true: "Humans are more important than hardware." ΓÇö have the right man, in the right place, with the right mix of special tactics and smart thinking.
