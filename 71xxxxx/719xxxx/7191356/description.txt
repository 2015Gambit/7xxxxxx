Great album and wanted to share it or upload it in case anyone else was looking for it.

Band Bio [Last.FM]:
Like Yesterday emerges from the New York City indie rock scene with unique vocals and a guitar-driven soundscape. The band recently completed the North-East leg of Taking Back SundayΓÇÖs Fall 2004 tour, and more recently played sold-out shows with The Used, My Chemical Romace, Coheed and Cambria, Midtown and Starting line which solidified Like YesterdayΓÇÖs strong and growing fan base. 

Like Yesterday has also completed their first EP with Producer/Engineer Paul Mahajan (Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV On The Radio, The Liars) and Producer Jamie Siegel (Lauryn Hill, Smashing Pumpkins, Del Amitri, The Movie Life) and went on to record a mini-album set to be released in May 2005 under Brian MaloufΓÇÖs Columbia imprint label Bandha Records.

Mark Holmes (vocals), Dave Holmes (guitar), and Joe Tomino (drums), were working on putting a band together when they encountered the strong songwriting of newcomer, Seva Granik (guitar). As Mark Holmes explains, ΓÇ£I had been looking to put something like this together but didnΓÇÖt know where to start until I met Seva. He had these great songs without any lyricsΓÇöI instantly knew he was someone I wanted to work with.ΓÇ¥ GranikΓÇÖs songwriting talent comes together perfectly with lead singer Mark HolmesΓÇÖ piercing, and emotional vocals and the versatility and technical prowess of Joe Tomino and Dave Holmes.
