,liviud,2012-04-18T18:35Z,How did you guys get past GFWL ?!
,markofbear,2012-04-18T20:10Z,"To get past GFWL just click on ""create new account"" and then ""make an offline profile"" (think it could be local dont rember)"
,liviud,2012-04-18T21:33Z,@markofbear the game requires live activation through serial key. How did you not get this ? Seems that I can't play with an offline account
[T],azaq318,2012-04-18T22:08Z,"Just press ""Esc"" on this, create offline profile ..."
,darkony1992,2012-04-18T22:57Z,Works like a charm! I didn't had any gfwl problems. Thanks!
,Lubibaby,2012-04-19T00:39Z,"I'm having problems getting it to work. The installation is weird with a lot of file names and options a bunch of random characters. The additional software doesn't want to install, probably because I'm running 32 bit. I manually looked up and download the 32 bit versions of the software, but the game still doesn't load. Whenever I start it up, it say ""Could not find FCengin.exe""."
,Lubibaby,2012-04-19T00:44Z,"It says ""Could not find FCengin.exe"" when I start up. How do I fix this? Otherwise, all the files appear to be in place."
,Lubibaby,2012-04-19T00:45Z,Sorry for the double post...I thought my comment disappeared.
,Pessa666,2012-04-19T00:51Z,"ok good fast dl, 1.5MB+

,runtaylor,2012-04-19T06:32Z,I can launch it but the screen stays black. I can open and close windows live but the game wont happen
,ugreppa,2012-04-19T13:03Z,"Thanks, works just fine. Would have bought this but GFWL.. nope"
,AarD8067,2012-04-19T15:54Z,"There is a virus in that thing, at least it behaves like one... I use ESET NOD32 v5, i download a lot of game which it thinks the executable is a virus so i created an exception in NOD32 for the «Play.exe» file, when i tried to lauch it my AV automatically quarantined and i saw that in the mean time, the Play.exe created multiple «is-XXXXX.tmp» with the exact same size as the Play.exe... i would wait for another release if i were you guys, just saying."
,Arial1070,2012-04-19T20:45Z,"Please help me! I run the game, and it says ""Could not launch game. Please, make sure another instance of game is not running"" (everything else is closed, antivirus protection too) Sorry for my eng, if i make some mistakes."
,bluethegreat1,2012-04-20T04:43Z,"what markofbear said.  click ""create new acct"" then some where in the description is a link to ""create local acct"" or ""local profile"" or something like that.  click that enter your nickname then gtg.  least thats how it worked for me"
,SLoneTiger,2012-04-20T06:18Z,"Having same trouble as ""Arial1070""
1.- AV inactive.
2.- Install as admin.
3.- Install extra software.
4.- Double click game icon (Icon looks weird though)
Message pops-up: ""Could not launch game. Please, make sure another instance of game is not running""
5.- Tried running FCEngine-GFWL.exe alone and it loads Steam client."
,skapaw,2012-04-20T06:52Z,"TO THOSE WHO CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE AN OFFLINE PROFILE:

The one thing nobody is mentioning here is how to get to the menu that lets you do this. Once you're on the title screen of the game, hit Esc to close the current GFWL box, then hit the HOME button on your keyboard. The option to create a profile will be there. Somewhere in the description of creating a profile will be a link to creating a local profile. That's it!"
,Dima8040,2012-04-20T08:58Z,"The same as ""Arial1070"" and ""SLoneTiger""
""Could not launch game. Please, make sure another instance of game is not running"""
,psdasila,2012-04-20T18:57Z,Very Nice Game Thx
,Vant97svk,2012-04-20T21:14Z,"Yes thank u very much :)
and there's another thing, i got the game in german, is it cause my OS language is german ? i guess yes but i want the game english for my bro, i understand german by the way"
,SLoneTiger,2012-04-21T05:17Z,"The problem is that it does not even load the game to display the ""GFWL"" screen, it just returns the pop-up to ""check game is not running"" not sure what am I doing wrong."
,PoppaChubbie,2012-04-21T10:19Z,"Same problem as others on this page: ""Could not launch game. Please make sure another instance of the game is not running""; there is DEFINITELY no other instance of the game running. Tried installing twice and have all redists installed; OS is Win Ult x64. The icon ""Play.exe"" to start the game has no pic and there are no other game exes to try. Seems to me this torrent is flawed and my advice would be to avoid it and try the skiddy dl. Thanks anyway for ur effort uploader but this definitely has problems."
,Arial1070,2012-04-21T14:35Z,"To everyone that has ""Could not launch..."" problem, i have downloaded skidrow version and it works fine :)"
,PoppaChubbie,2012-04-21T23:35Z,"Yeah, I installed the Skidrow version too and it works perfectly. Will keep seeding for a week."
,onimusha410,2012-04-23T12:16Z,"This works 100% 

If anyone has the ""black screen"" problem, just download the NO INTRO FIX from http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_insanely_twisted_shadow_planet.shtml

Enjoy!"
,DarkSilhouette,2012-04-23T18:55Z,"Works well, I was iffy about the turning off AV thing, kept an eye on my processes and double checked my BFE and registry files. seems there is no virus :-)

The whole install had me shaking, the characters were odd, everything was odd, would stall for long periods of time. After all of this it worked 100%.

Thinking of writing a save game mod or at least making it so you can have multiple offline profiles. Ill give it a try and if enough people want it ill put the mod up here."
,ag_orange,2012-07-02T15:40Z,Thanks...it works perfectly!
