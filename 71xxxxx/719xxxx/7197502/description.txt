Teach Yourself Algebra is a great introduction for learners having no prior experience with this ancient branch of mathematics. It acquaints readers with algebra and its basic components, such as equations, exponents, and indices. Then, using many examples and exercises, it shows them how to solve equations of all kinds, including linear, simultaneous, and quadratic; determine simple sequences and progression; and plot graphical representations of quantities. This book provides an introduction to the principles and foundations of Algebra, with particular emphasis on its applications to engineering and allied sciences. The progressive exercises are designed both to test the reader's under-standing of the subject and to give him practice in the essential power of manipulation. Only a knowledge of Arithmetic is assumed, though some reference is made to theorems in Geometry and Trigonometry for the benefit of those students who are acquainted with them.
I had scanned & uploade earlier Teach Yourself Statistics. I also have Teach Yourself Calculus by P.Abbott which I shall scan & upload in future if possible.
