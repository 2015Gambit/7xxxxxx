This is an iso created from the original CDROM with all the extra cars I could find added in. They don't automatically install when you install the game. You have to open the CDROM/ISO (depending on whether you burn it or just mount it) and navigate to the folder named "extracars".

Enjoy. And SEEEEEED. :)
