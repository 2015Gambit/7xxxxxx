,baconninja,2012-04-19T16:10Z,Funny how Red hood wasnt supposed to be a Bat Title---that didnt last long.
,Maddogsargent,2012-04-19T19:06Z,"TNBG, you can download Near Death 7, 3, 2 and 1 on Demonoid, and if you go on google and search for Near Death 004 cbr, you can find that one on rapidshare I believe and 5 and 6 pretty easily using the same method. I would upload myself but haven't got round to learning how to make a torrent yet, sorry!"
,TNBG,2012-04-20T19:33Z,"I don't mean to hijack the comment thread here, but Madd, I can't seem to find them as I believe they've been pulled from Rapidshare and Demonoid is either not working for me or the registrations are closed.  Could anyone help a guy here?  I apologize if I seem noobish but I do usually try look myself before posting."
,TNBG,2012-04-20T19:39Z,Never mind.  Got 'em thanks.
