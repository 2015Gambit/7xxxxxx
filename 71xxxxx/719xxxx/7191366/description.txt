Review by Público's André Jegundo, from the artist's
official web site:

"The Partisan Seed or the return to the essence of the
song: (...) Visions Of Solitary Branches, Filipe Miranda's
first solo album, released in December 2006, reveals an
original composer within the context of the Portuguese
musical scene: using the guitar, or the piano, Filipe
Miranda is a composer of intimate and deloused songs,
intensely instrumental, accompanied with melodic lyricism."

First free album from this Portuguese act. Downloaded from
the artist's Bandcamp store, including front cover, ID3
tags and file names cleaned up, and everything packed comme
il faut. No reencoding, of course.
