Notes:   Issued in a cardboard sleeve - no jewel case liner !

These four songs were originally released on a different label a year earlier but were mastered too fast on the original disc. They are featured here at the proper speed but still suffer from sound quality problems due to the badly abused acetate that they were found on.

"Hearts Of Stone" is a historical find - long rumoured to have been performed on the Hayride, it wasn't until this acetate surfaced that proof existed !

"Hound Dog" is an absolutely WILD version with the crowd almost out of control !
 
With covers! Enjoy!
