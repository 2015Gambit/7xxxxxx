Hey guys
I wasn't able to find any decent encodes of 24 seasons 1, 2 and 3. Therefore I encoded the first season myself with high quality settings.
Maybe I'll share seasons 2 and 3 as well if there's a need for it. This release won't work with portable devices or console crap.
I recommend VLC Player (2.0+) or Media Player Classic with CoreAVC (3.0+) for playback. Your player MUST support 10bit!


All episodes got cleaned up before encoding (DVD sources are often messy). This helps greatly with compression.

The quality is a lot better than XviD stuff (624x352 [219648 pixels] vs 720x576 [414720 pixels] with x264 10bit).
However, one can still easily notice it's a DVD source (there's no HD source available).
