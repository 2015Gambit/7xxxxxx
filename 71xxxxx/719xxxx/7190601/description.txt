The online MP works, but if anyone else in your lobby has the same game serial as you the game will not start. I have tried the local multiplayer with hamachi, and it works great.

Warband expands on the original game by introducing a sixth faction, The Sarranid Sultanate, increasing the political options, allowing players to start their own faction, and incorporating multiplayer modes. Reviews of the game were generally favourable, with the addition of multiplayer the most highly praised element. This anticipated game won many awards, such as a nomination for the "Best Indie Game of the Year'.

The new multiplayer mode removes all of the RPG and map elements from the single-player mode, instead focusing on direct combat. Multiplayer matches cater for up to 64 players, split into two teams based on the kingdoms selected.All players are provided with a balanced 'template' character (which can be altered for each server) based on three general types: Archer, Cavalry, and Infantry. Characters are customised by purchasing the equipment available to their selected kingdom, with better equipment purchased after earning denars (the game's currency) in the multiplayer matches. There is no link between a player's multiplayer and single-player characters, and no way to level up the multiplayer character or alter its characteristics from the templates (other than through the purchase of equipment).

Eight multiplayer modes were included in the original release of Warband. Most were similar to modes found in first-person shooter games (such as team battles and capture the flag), although other modes, like the castle sieges from the main game, are also included.
