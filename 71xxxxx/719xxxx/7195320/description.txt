Notes   Tracks 19, 20, 22 - 24 were recorded on August 5, 1972, Midnight Show. 
The Wonder Of You springs from another show since it wasn`t sung during the MS this day. 
Carry Me Back To Old Virginia (excerpt) was sung during the MS and is listed here without being done!!  
This show was taken from a CD-R floating around in collectors circles for years now. No efforts were made to improve the sound. Poor cover design.
  
  Concert:   The show is typical for this Vegas gig. Elvis isn`t very talkative. The first time he really speaks to the audience is when he starts the intros. This lack of interaction with the audience makes this show somewhat boring although the songs are performed with great passion. (Ciscoking) 


With covers! Enjoy! Thanks to the JAR blog!
