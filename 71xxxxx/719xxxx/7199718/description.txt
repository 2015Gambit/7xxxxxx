"Murphy Brown Lied to Us"

Jack sets Liz up on a blind date to 
show her what she's missing in her 
relationship with Criss. Meanwhile at 
KableTown, Jack has to scramble when 
his plan to manufacture couches hits a 
speed bump. With Tracy's help, Jenna 
orchestrates a public meltdown to get 
Paul's attention. 

18/Slower+
