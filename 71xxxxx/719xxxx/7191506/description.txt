Notes

[US+hardsub] + [CEE-hardsub] = [US+CEE]

a. As the main source is taken the US source, as it has much less blocking artefacts than CEE, and in general the US.BD better.
b. Hardsub was removed, where there was no visible damage of the video.
c. Some frames contained defects, e.g. dots, scratches etc, were fixed.
d. ESiR encode has a glitch at 01:20:02 and dropping frames
TW BD was used to fix frames
