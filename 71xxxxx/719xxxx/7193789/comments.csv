i wont bother with this one to save bandwidth
never like best of recaps stuff..

,1pbmember,2012-04-18T06:03Z,Thanks TrialNerror.
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-18T08:31Z,"nope, psspss, there's possibly 3 more episodes coming. for sure another new 'special' ep next week"
[V],psspss,2012-04-18T11:09Z,"i see some are renaming your episodes
Season 2

but Im not sure how they get that
as the intro said a few times from season 1
missing bits couldnt put in..

so beats me.. wouldnt be surprise if they
calling is a season 2 now

how can they make from missing footage though
another 3.. wow

unless they catching up with the guys back in usa"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-20T09:23Z,"next week is ""weapons tech"" and yea there is an episode of a sit down interview with all the guys at once that is also to have previews of the real upcoming season 2"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-20T09:29Z,maybe they might throw in a 'behind the scenes' ep as well?  idk. could be 2 more eps or 3... or just that 1 next week. we'll see
