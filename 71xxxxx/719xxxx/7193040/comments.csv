,OmniNegro,2012-04-18T02:14Z,"People saying you need the original, can you show *Any* reference to your claim? Or are you just media trolls?

Read the nfo. It says this is all you need. It says this has all the DLC. It describes the EE as different from the original in many ways. It never even suggests you may need the original. And looking around to find it for sale, I see no need to purchase the original if you want EE.

Media trolls go away. Those who doubt this, feel free to post your opinion, but do not insult everyone by stating your opinion as a fact. That likely will make you a liar."

,OmniNegro,2012-04-18T03:25Z,"http://en.thewitcher.com/ee_manual/

Check it out yourself. The EE patch is 36 separate files. This is one ISO. The size is basically the same, but that means nothing since almost if not all the content is replaced.

If this is not the whole game then many people will be greatly disappointed."

,OmniNegro,2012-04-18T14:37Z,"My comment last night was never successful.

I was going to say that no-one should EVER reply to questions like that asked by cody5458 as it was worded in a way LEA can use to say that the K-lite Codec pack is software to assist with piracy. 

He/she could have asked something to the same effect but without the legal BS, but he/she decided to try to associate a known and respected tool for media users of all types with media theft.

All of this is implied, obviously since EZ does not post stolen videos at all. :)

Either way, a quick search using ANY search engine would have told you all you need to know. Really, what is there to tell about the K-Lite pack? 

It has presets so you need not bother to do anything but select ""Lots of stuff"" and click next a few times. It will make the file associations too. But it is NOT in any way illegal, nor does it ""Circumvent"" copy protection in any way. 

It is merely codecs used by a plethora of things and a really nice player that is better than WMP in a billion ways.

Now back on topic, Seed you fuckers! Are you so blind that you restrict your client from uping anything? You are literally shooting yourself in the foot."

,Swiftwinter,2012-04-27T07:52Z,"Everything works great. Need a pretty good rig to run it on max with a decent frame rate, though. If your rig isn't that great, I'd recommend turning off things like shadow quality, SSAO, AA, motion blur and effects, v-sync, all the depth of field settings, and obviously ubersampling. Those are the settings which effect frame rate the most. You can set the rest to whatever you want with little to no frame rate change. Another thing you could also do is turn down the resolution. The lowest I would set it to is 1680x1050. The noticeable difference between that and 1920x1200 is very subtle, and will gain you a 10-15 (20-25 from 2560x1600) frame rate boost while still looking gorgeous.

,OmniNegro,2012-04-30T20:37Z,"Regarding performance issues, please pull your heads from your asses.

TURN OFF ANTIALIASING!!!

Problem solved. Most of you cannot even tell the difference in visual quality anyway.

Or if you absolutely refuse to disable AA, turn it DOWN. you absolutely do not need 16x passes of AA. If any, you need 2x. And each pass means it has to do a boatload of work for each and every frame.

Try it and see for yourself. You can leave v-sync on and all the other details to relatively high settings, but AA KILLS FPS. Period."
