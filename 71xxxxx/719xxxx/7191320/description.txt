The timeline leased to currently by this Danish quartet has long since been cut.
The rough Psychedelic Hard Rock of early 70┬┤s has caused it , as well as the Psych-Folk and infectious Garage Rock of late 60┬┤s
As old-fashioned as timeless, as consistent as brutal, Baby Woodrose are great on gender as Monster Magnet, or Bevis Front with nothing after this. A mind-blowing Psychedelic Hard Rock monster, which is aptly named after a Hawaiian vine whose seeds contain the highly hallucinogenic drug LSA.
For the rock musical journey through time, please enter here. But do not say I did not warn you!
