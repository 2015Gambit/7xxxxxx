This is the Europe version for the GTA IV 4 100% Game Save PS3, i have also uploaded the USA & AUSTRALIA versions.

How to get it on your PS3;

Step 1. Take the "PS3" folder out of the .ZIP file you downloaded (this file).
Step 2. Copy the "PS3" folder to a USB memory stick (make sure this is the only thing on the USB memory stick for less confusion)
Step 3. Put the USB memory stick in your PS3.
Step 4. On your PS3, go across to "Game" and down/up to "Saved Data Utility (PS3TM)".
Step 4. Go down/up to "USB Device (Storage Media)" and click on it.
Step 5. Go to the GTA 4 Save, with the GTA 4 picture next to it, press Triangle, and then press copy, it will automatically copy to the correct destination on the PS3. The it will be complete, just go on the game and it will load up.
