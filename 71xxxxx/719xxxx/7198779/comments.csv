Why am I the only seeder?

A unique package you can't find anywhere else due to the customizations I personally made and included with the standard and bonus materials.

Without help seeding, without feedback - Why would I continue to seed this.

This torrent is in danger of being pulled to free up bandwidth for other seeds..."

,Crowed,2012-06-04T05:11Z,"Thanks, brutal_product. I truly appreciate the help. I know comments and ratings are hard to come by and also understand there is a LOT of leaching...

I'm just not going to wear out my computer by always being on to seed pet projects.

I'll look and see what you have up and I'm sure I'll find something to support.

Some of my other torrents are way more self sufficient now with lots of seeding help so I can make room on my seeding list.

Here's my share for the past month:
