,jack.durain,2012-04-29T10:30Z,"this copy is pretty fucked up, after playing it for 10 minutes via DNLA on my Samsung bluray player, the following message appears on the screen:
“Audio outputs temporarily muted. Do not adjust the playback volume. The content being played is protected by Cinavia™ 
and is not authorized for playback on this device. For more information, see http://www.cinavia.com. Message Code 3.”"
