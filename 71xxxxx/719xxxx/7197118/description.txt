Narratives:

Last year, the immensely talented multi-instrumentalist was the first jazz musician to win a GRAMMY« Award for Best New Artistùjust another feat in a slew of amazing accomplishments, including teaching herself how to play violin by age 5, dropping out of high school from sheer ennui, then earning a B.M. from Berklee College of Music by 20. Despite the high expectations that come with such achievement, Radio Music Society delivers, displaying the versatility of her musicianship and vision, such as the soliloquy to spice ôCinnamon Treeö with its Joe Satriani-esque guitar flourishes and the artfully arranged cover of MJÆs ôI CanÆt Help It,ö on which she collaborates with jazz saxophonist Joe Lovano. Every song on the deluxe version of Radio Music Society has a corresponding video.
