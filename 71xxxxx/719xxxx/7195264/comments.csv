Thanks btw. Brings back alot of arcade memories."

@ TyMod: I haven't tried it yet, but I've ripped the installs from the original CD, it should work.
I'll upload an emulated Dreamcast version soon (ripped from Midway Arcade Treasures 3) with 2-player support and with everything unlocked, including the bonus levels! :D

@ mustang1966: You can extract it via the 7-Zip context menu. Right click ""Hydro Thunder.7z.001"" > 7-Zip > Extract to ""Hydro Thunder"""
