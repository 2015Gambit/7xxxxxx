Hydro Thunder is a powerboat racing sub-series game, originally an arcade game and later released for the Sega Dreamcast as a launch title in 1999. The PC version was released in 2001. It's one of my favorite old games :D

The gameplay of Hydro Thunder consists of racing high-tech speedboats through treacherous environments, from the cold seas of the Arctic Circle, to a post-apocalyptic, flooded version of New York City.

CDKiller released a NoCD cracked exe back in 2003 but it only works correctly for the English version. Each language has it's own executable and although they have exactly the same size, they are not the same (different word sizes and commands).
This release contains 6 language versions, each with their own installer (from the original CD) and NoCD cracked executable.

Languages: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish

Install: Extract with WinRAR or 7zip
Open the language directory of your choice and run the setup

Happy Hydro Jumping!
