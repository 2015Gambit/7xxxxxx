,GIANNIS511,2012-04-20T10:20Z,"Well I use comical 0.8 and I can read the files perfectly. If you use an older version of comical, maybe you should download 0.8. Also you can try re-downloading the files. Finally you can use winrar to open the files and see if they are downloaded correctly (If they aren't it will start sending messages)."
,MuserClair,2012-04-20T11:36Z,"works fine with cdisplay (v 1.8.1.0 if you need to know).  never have a problem with cdisplay unless the files are corrupt or incomplete - great free reader.
and GIANNIS511, thanks for the ul :)"
