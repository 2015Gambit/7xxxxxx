,randallytxt,2012-05-07T07:42Z,".... Yet another sf movie for brainless people, unfortunately 99% of todays public. A pity Mr. Oskar Schindler took their money to star in this embarrassing flic. So, we sent a message to a planet 20 light years away and shortly after they invade us, if they arrived at a speed FASTER THAN LIGHT they then must have tremendous weapons, not the sorry earthly ones we saw in this movie. A flic just to make the US Navy look good. Besides, why didnt they use tactic nuclear weapons and atomic submarines to counter the threat? Maybe too expensive for their pitiful budget. Always earthlings against all odds defeating the alien threat ! Like in Independence  Day the nerd connecting TO AN ALIEN COMPUTER and infecting them with a virus... The alien obviously didnt have a Norton or Panda antivirus... How long will these brainless producers continue to abuse the public with an IQ greater than 50 with their silly plots? "
,manuelbarros,2012-05-07T13:15Z,itÂ´s possible subtitle in portuguese ? and i have a mac wich is the best movie player to see the movie with subtitles ?
,ealomari98,2012-05-07T14:58Z,"@manuelbarros

if you use vlc player, you cant go wrong.. you just have to search for the subtitle file and if you have it, go to (on the menu bar) video/subtitle track/open... then choose the subtitle file that you should have downloaded for this movie :) sorry if i confused you.. i just realized how to use the subtitles :$"
,randallytxt,2012-05-07T18:49Z,"
By the way, in spite of my above comments, this uploaded version is quite watchable, thanks, not bad quality for a cam..."
,SaltyNadsack,2012-05-09T07:46Z,"@randallytxt - dude goto a movie review site if you want to qq about this, all we are interested in is a/v....not your opinions on US movie producers."
,randallytxt,2012-05-09T09:46Z,"I only try to help people who expect a blade runner and find a three stooges s/f movie, so they dont waste time."
,legio9,2012-05-09T20:20Z,"Problem reside is the lack of standardization in the ratings, where some compared it to the format used, other one the quality etc  etc  rating should be on QUALITY, no matter the format.

here is one that we should ALL use so that we ALL speak the same ""language"":

Legio scale: 

10 = Blue ray quality
9   = DVD quality
8   = Excellent
7   = Superior
6   = Very good
5   = standard quality
4   = Bellow standard
3   = extra bellow quality
2   = Horrible
1   = crap
0   = unwatchable

THIS movie thus:

A = 4
V = 4"
,randallytxt,2012-05-10T03:47Z,"I disagree, I would give it  V 5  A 5.

,meandmonty,2012-05-15T15:31Z,"randalltxt.....you pompous arsewipe, people watch films because they ENJOY them, viz a viz if something becomes popular it generally means that people enjoy it. If you want a club that will admire your wit and obviously superior intellect - fuck off and join MENSA"

,luciano.duarte,2012-05-18T04:51Z,"V=3
A=1"
,vreyhr676y,2012-05-18T09:04Z,"@legio9: before suggesting a quality scale in your pompous arse name, learn semanthics: Excellent means there ISN'T anything better, so that would be BR, Superior=DVD, etc.

@randallytxt: this is not a review site and nobody come here for that or even asking for it so STFU your big mouth."
,vreyhr676y,2012-05-19T13:20Z,"I downloaded and watched:
V:2
A:3
M:4
Horrible low quality, out of focus sometimes, sound saturated, filmed too close to the screen and from an angle, probably to hide the camera and the Italian subtitles.

No subtitles.

For 1.44GB I expected a good quality movie, the guy filming is a retard and the uploader too, I didn't enjoy it because of the above, but I wanted to see it. I don't recommend this TS movie."
,xalamanderx,2012-05-22T05:19Z,"@a-1991  

Thanks, youre one of the intelligent ones...

@meandmonty

As I said, I was trying to save some people the pain of wasting two hours watching this crap. But if you like the Three Stooges kind of humor, then you must have enjoyed Battleship.
