A fleet of ships is forced to do battle with an armada of unknown origins in order to discover and thwart their destructive goals. 


NOTES:

Where too begin ....pass

Right got 2 lots of audio and 3 lots of video ...now all have issue with missing scenes or audio except the worse one
out the bunch by 26k.
So had no choice but too use the audio off there except the begining and also used it for the 4mins missing scene.

The main body of this video is from deep cheers for the files ....the video had borders all round it,which needed too
be fixed along with the AR and then the normal brightness,contrast and colouring etc....which we fixed the best we could.
Now this release had a 4mins 14 secs chunk missing so thats beed added from 26ks release...but we did clean the video up,as
they could have been related too the hulk they were so green.

The audio the start is from a friend and then it switches to the audio off 26ks release,which was not bad but loud scenes were
too loud and it gets distorted on them ....so clean all the audio files the best i could.
Syncing was a pita aswell ...because on top of the big chunk there was also several 1-2 secs missing in different places which made
all shrink/stretches off the audio a pita too do as i needed too find the missing parts and work out how much was missing then add too
my stretches/shrinks.
Anyway several hrs later and some hard work it done and all there and the best i can could with the sources given ....now watch the
R5 drop FFS lmfao.....
