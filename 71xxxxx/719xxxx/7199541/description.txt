Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On today's show, Alex talks with director and producer James Lane and Holland Vandennieuwenhof about their latest effort, A Noble Lie: Oklahoma City 1995, an important documentary now available at the Infowars Store. Produced in Oklahoma, the documentary takes a fresh and in-depth look at the circumstances surrounding the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Instead of accepting at face value the Federal GovernmentΓÇÖs deeply-flawed investigation, A Noble Lie features ground breaking information and eyewitness testimonies that refute the official story. Among those interviewed are General Benton Partin, former head of weapons development for the Air Force, State Representative Charles Key, members of the Oklahoma Bombing Investigation Committee and Jesse Trentadue, whose brother Kenneth was tortured and murdered in Federal custody in the days following the bombing.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
