You don't have the latest firmware version.

And now you've been flagged as well.

Black screen of death as I've heard it been called. If ever you face the black screen you are supposed to immediately power off your console. My past experiences with this have included both black screen and the DVD menu. As soon as I logged onto XBL again I was banned. Even with a legit game in the tray.

You should look into updating and checking your profile for flags. You can google Gamertag Flag Checker or something of the sorts.

Good luck."

Thought I might ask some people who have successfully modded their consoles.  If you have a link to a good guide or how-to please feel free to post.  Thanks.  

1.) If I flash the latest firmware can it eventually ""expire"" and leave me vulnerable to being banned, and if so how do I stay up to date with whether or not mine is the latest release? 

2.) Can I back-up my current firmware before I attempt the mod/flash in case something goes wrong and I need to revert back?  

3.) What is the best burning software to use for burning these games?  I use Nero 7 (better than the new bloated versions) for almost everything and it works great but I know certain tasks require certain software.  

* I'm not an expert user but I've done my fair share of modding stuff but its just been a while and I want to avoid some of the common stupid mistakes"

Thought I would help some of you people lacking some knowledge.  Maybe it'll help, if not could give a fuck less.

1) All Games must be patched with Abgx360, which updates Topology to LT 3.0.  If your running another firmware have fun.

2) Prototype 2 is an XGD3 disc. Meaning? There is 3% worth of data at the end of the disc that you need to write. Truncate method seems like it works, but your missing this 3% and risking the chance of getting your console flagged and xbox live account permanetly.  Only 6 burners on the market will write these successfully NO you can not substitute a burner.

3)  I was having issue's when I downloaded this game and tried burning it off a couple times, everything verified great Kprobe results but installing to hard drive it died at 49%.  Fixed this by Re-Installing my burner max firmware.  When disc is done, run through Abgx 360 and see if it complete's CRC check you should be good to install after that.

@tommyhawkster
1) Your firmware will expire when Xbox updates their dashboard, you will know because it will ask for an update randomly without disc inside.
2) Yes you can backup firmware for future restore.
3) IMGBurn with an iHas rev b dvd burner google ""xgd3 disc burner"", should list off 6 models.

,Assassinprofessor,2012-06-16T22:08Z,"all you guys that have 'unsupported disc', before you start the game, fro the xbox menu play any mp3, so while u start the game let the mp3 play a song...then after 2 or 3 minutes just remove the usb with mp3 and violaaa...worksss..."
