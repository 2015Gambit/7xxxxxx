There are more than 15 videos available in youtube for this song and we added one more :). 
All clips were shot at London using Canon 600D. My friends in the video are Shadma, Muthhu and Kushal. 
And I do not believe in the rumours associated with this song i.e. it belongs to a IIT student who died of cancer after composing this song for his girl friend etc etc etc.
Intro and Exit templates were taken and slightly edited from the below website

Thank You for watching it.
