,CCALLUMM,2012-04-19T21:33Z,what does the update actually do ?
,Mercyflush64,2012-04-20T08:22Z,It's not very big and it has no asset folders etc. like other updates so I'm guessing you will also need a previous patch. For that matter do you need any updates before the 11.9b or does that have everything up to date before this one? 
,Mercyflush64,2012-04-20T08:31Z,No way to edit but I meant before the 11.0b patch not 11.9b
,tpb_4_ever,2012-04-20T21:54Z,"@Mercyflush64. You just put the files in your railworks directory, There is no assets folder because it isn't an add-on, it updates the version of railworks."
,Mercyflush64,2012-04-20T23:35Z,"I understand all of that. My question was about a fresh install of the game, I believe it is version 6 something. What updates do I need to apply so it is completely up to date.

And by the way, awesome work you do in allowing us access to these great files. Your hard work is very appreciated. "
