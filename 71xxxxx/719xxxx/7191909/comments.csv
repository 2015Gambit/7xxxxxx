,Vaisya,2012-04-20T14:56Z,"seed, this is free"

,DrPeperoni,2012-04-22T14:00Z,seeeed it stops at 23% 
,mycophage,2012-04-25T15:28Z,"Well, it looks like this torrent isn't completely dead. After a long freeze at 23%, it seems to be picking back up - it went up 5% overnight and now is up to 29%. 

I think the original seeder is on a slow connection, but I appreciate that they're sticking with it - thank you!

I'll stay on and (assuming that the file works) will seed >10x as per usual."
,mycophage,2012-05-05T13:59Z,Bah. Completely stalled for 2 weeks at 36.4%. Abandoning.
,bsevs,2012-05-15T02:26Z,"Good lord would someone seed this, no chance of getting past 36%"
,vampyromorph,2012-06-15T00:19Z,"Help! I downloaded it, installed it, but when I went to play was prompted with message that said ""Please insert Rome Total War DVD-The DVD must be present to play"". What do?"
