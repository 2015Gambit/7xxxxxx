Episode 1:

On either side of Nightingale Wood through one idyllic year in the late 1930s, hearts beat and minds scheme, as the dowdy Wither family tries to compete with the glittering Springs. Bookish Tina Wither is in love with Saxon, her father's handsome and aloof chauffeur. Her shopgirl sister-in-law, Viola, has fallen for Victor Spring, the lord of the manor. And Madge is in love with a dog.

Episode 2:

Viola Wither finally has the chance to escape her stifling in-laws in Essex. Whilst they are spending a month in the Lakes, she and her sister-in-law Tina escape to Stanton on Sea. Viola is still pining for the dashing Victor Spring - who has kissed her - and Tina for the beautiful chauffeur, Saxon - likewise. But is it all hopeless?
