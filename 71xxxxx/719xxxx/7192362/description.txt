'Titanic: The Aftermath' 
On 15th April 1912, the RMS Titanic hit an iceberg and sank, claiming the lives of 1500 passengers and crew. Beginning where other accounts usually end, drama documentary 'Titanic: The Aftermath', tells the story of the remarkable mission to recover and identify the bodies of victims. Meeting the descendants of three people involved in one of the greatest civilian disasters of the 20th Century, this compelling programme explores the fate of their forebears, and reveals the impact of the sinking on those they left behind. From the violinist who died playing soothing music to calm the frightened passengers; to the richest man aboard the ship who perished after ensuring his pregnant young wife was safely aboard a lifeboat; and the Halifax registrar whose respectful and efficient methodology became the model for modern forensics, hear the poignant tales of three families, whose lives were changed by this tragedy. Featuring emotive drama and unseen photographs of the Titanic dead, this is a powerful and moving record of an unknown aspect of the Titanic story.
