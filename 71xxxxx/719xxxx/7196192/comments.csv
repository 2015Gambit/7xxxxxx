,xbox360fanatic,2012-05-08T17:36Z,"Get your DVD drive in your xbox 360 flashed with LT3.0 to play LT3.0 games, costs a tenner usually. To burn the disc get liteon ihas 124b dual layer dvdrw SATA connection(拢15), put it in your computer download burnermax firmware (free) flash it to your liteon and use imgburn software (free). Use verbatim dual layer discs for best results. Cheaper Aone discs need a modified burnermax firmware."

,xbox360fanatic,2012-05-08T18:32Z,"I do not know about running from usb I just do the discs, you could try running it if you want and comment."
