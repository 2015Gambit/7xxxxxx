A few months back OdeonDeathstalker forwarded me a message from n0ak containing a link to xDark 4.5 x64 in 25 files in a mediafire folder. The mediafire folder has since been removed, and apparently this file no longer exists on the internet.

Thankfully, I managed to save a 4th copy that I forgot about since I deleted my other 3 backups.

Thank you Odeon, I hope this proves useful to you.
An even bigger thank you to n0ak for releasing his amazing work.
