,visual12345,2012-04-22T22:49Z,"How can i remove the subs from the mkv file? im using ps3 media server to stream from pc, have checked the 'definitely disable subtitles' box in the transcoding setting but no joy. Is ther a program that i can use to do this?"
,EatingMushrooms,2012-04-29T22:33Z,Visual12345; you can remove the subs with the program 'MKVExtractGUI'. Search on Google and you find the download and the 'how to' extract info. It's easy and take a few minutes.

,Handicapped_Ent,2012-05-08T20:41Z,I use MKVtoolnix to remove subtitles.
