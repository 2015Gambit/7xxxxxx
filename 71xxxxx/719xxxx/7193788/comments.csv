,MrsSuicideSheep,2012-07-20T13:30Z,"Why can't anyone upload the vid's in MP4 or MP3? I've gone through hell and back trying to get them to be watched through my PS3. I know we can just get a Converter and change them just like that.. but.. Is there something that's preventing someone from Uploading them in Default vids? Besides, wouldn't the Torrent get better likes and ease off more stress that way? It's just my Opinion though. "

MKV does a lot of useful stuff, especially for an international level of use. I'd rather add a $50 streaming media player box to my system than argue with the people who run the PS3 and Xbox operations."
