[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-30T08:58Z,subs work fine
,JazzTracey,2012-05-08T07:58Z,"Hi Daman2Iife, you have very good torrents. :D I would like to know though, if this is 8bit or 10bit? Or is you default 10bit unless otherwise stated? Thank you. :)"
,Jonasoap,2012-05-10T00:41Z,"db is right, the subs do not work"
,PSThWii60,2012-05-11T23:48Z,How is it that the subs do/don't work? What problems are being experienced?
,PSThWii60,2012-05-12T00:43Z,I found (when playing with VLC) that the English option for subtitles doesn't work. But the Japanese option for subtitles shows the English subtitles just dandy. I DLed and shall continue to see for some time! TYVM Damn4life!
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-13T23:20Z,jazz i default 8bit. Some people still have no idea what 10bit is so i dont want to deal with green screen comments.

,QuisEs99,2012-07-14T23:19Z,"Hexetera, VLC is the best player for ANYTHING. never use WMP it just absolutely blows"
,KuroKiss,2012-08-19T05:47Z,"I'm not sure if it's just me, but the audio on this seems a bit wonky.  I'm watching on VLC and haven't had an issue before but for some reason on this the voice quality actually sounds pretty poor.  I have to have it turned down so I practically can't hear the dialogue in order to not be bombarded with almost static-y sounding overtone whenever a character speaks loudly.  I don't have this issue with anything else so I know it's not my speakers.  Just my experience with it so far though."
