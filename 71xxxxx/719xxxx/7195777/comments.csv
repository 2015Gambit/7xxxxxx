,vali31,2012-04-18T21:09Z,Can you tell me how you got this to be 4.3gb.  I have the source file but I used convertXtoDVD and I get 2.9gb and a subpar video.  Please help me do the same as you only as a NTSC though.

,miltonyukio,2012-04-20T08:52Z,Beware!! This download is a cheating!   There is image but there is no sound though!

,vali31,2012-04-20T18:31Z,TeukkaS what program did you use to convert this to DVD PAL?  I want to have it DVD NTSC.
