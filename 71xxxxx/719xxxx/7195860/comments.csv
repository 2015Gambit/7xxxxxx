,Mihawkfuu,2012-04-23T22:44Z,"Havent downloaded this but every episode should be around 150 - 200mb , making this file way to big."
,univ_code,2012-04-27T02:54Z,Nah. Each episode should be between 500-700mb. Thanks splix.
,MySQL_Error,2012-04-29T15:18Z,"Mihawkfu is right, they should be about 150MB each. Compare to other 720p x264 releases and you'll see.

I'm not saying there's necessarily viruses in these however, they might just be badly encoded (most likely with an unnecessarily high bit rate for audio). Still, I would stay away from this torrent (no uploader name either which suggests an unreliable source)."
