So let's quit moaning ans stop expecting to be spoon fed  .  
Thankyou Natalia ."
,animalmcburger,2012-04-20T21:01Z,no it doesn't take 20 seconds to download so don't make up excuses for your laziness.  Everyone has to go through folders and delete pictures of every torrent they don't like now?  No one is bashing you for your uploads but just admit you didn't feel like doing it and someone else will.
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-04-21T01:23Z,"IT DOESNT TAKE MUCH LONGER THAN 20 SECONDS , AND HOW THE FUCK AM I THE LAZY ONE , YOU ARE THE LAZY CUNT THAT WANTS IT ALL DONE FOR YOU , AND IT MUST TAKE YOU AGES TO DELETE A PHOTO , LOL , YEAH LIKE A SECOND . AND IT WONT BE YOU THAT WILL START UPLOADING SINCE YOU HAVE NEVER UPLOADED ANYTHING ON TPB . 

WHAT NEXT , DO YOU WANT ME TO COME AND WANK YOU OFF TO SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE . LOL.

CHEESUS."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-04-21T01:29Z,"HERE IS THE EASIEST WAY TO GET THE SCREESHOT QUICKLY .

click get this torrent , if you are downloading using utorrent , all you do is click on files tab in middle of screen next to info , peers , ratings , trackers , speed . 
You will see all the files in torrent there . 
Right click on image file , and set priority to high , therefore that should be downloaded the fastest . probably 20 - 30 seconds or so . 

AND IF THATS TOO MUCH HARD WORK FOR YOU ,  YOU REALLY ARE A LAZY BASTARD ."
,animalmcburger,2012-04-23T17:06Z,"No one said it was THAT much harder.  My point is that uploaders can stop whining about how people complain that there isn't a screen shot.  How can you argue with the fact that it's THAT much easier to browse through the torrents that you don't like?  The next time you see a link to a screen shot, by all means, DON'T click on it; download the torrent file, open it and download the image file and check it out.  I simply stated that this is LESS efficient for the end user i.e. the WANKER"
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-04-23T20:26Z,"Yes of course it's easier to get a straight link , but if there is none , and it's in the torrent , I don't see a problem .
Maybe uploaders get a little fed up of constant whinging , remember how much time they are sacrificing , I can assure you it takes a lot longer to upload stuff than it takes to click on the download button. 
And most people don't even say thanks  .
And to be honest , the fuckers that really piss me off are the ones that moan if there isnt an IMDB link for a movie . They take more time to log in and whinge than if they would just google it . 
And as usual it's the people that never upload anything that do the moaning . Maybe if they done a few uploads themselves they would appreciate the time and effort thet went into it . "
