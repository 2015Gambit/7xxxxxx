,omegaviper,2012-04-24T08:28Z,these are out of order at least season 2 is I am trying to figure out which ones but it may take a awhile.
,omegaviper,2012-04-24T08:32Z,"season 2 has random episodes of season 3 and tv specials labeled as season 2 also these falsely labeled episodes don't have subtitles, but the correctly labeled season 3 and tv specials do seems very strange."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-25T03:53Z,"Everything is in order dude and yes they all have subs 
Use VLC or MPC "
,omegaviper,2012-04-26T04:14Z,"I have both vlc and mpc I prefer vlc but that has nothing to do with it.  

I can clearly see that eps 2-22, 24-32, 34-79 are not season 2 they are season 3 it says so in the show and I have watched those already and I know that they are not season 2 there may be more but I am still checking.  Did you check your files before you uploaded this?  Did you check your files before making that comment?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-26T23:32Z,"season 1 has 23 episodes
season 2 155
season 3 50
they are all there "
,omegaviper,2012-04-27T07:26Z,"@Daman4Iife are you foreign or just really dumb?  I never said that numerically they were not there.  I said that earlier episodes in season 2 were falsely labeled as season 2, because in fact they are from season 3 and random ova's and tv specials.  I re-downloaded those falsley labled episodes today and they are now, actually season 2 with dual audio and english subs.  I did keep the original files I downloaded first, to compare and they are still falsely labeled so you must of fixed it.  Anyone with English as their first language should be able to understand this unless their iq is very low.  So don't be all like ""they all there dude"" or ""they have subs"" or some bull shit when those statements are very vague and not targeting all my points of interest.  Too reiterate this torrent is complete and up to date and has dual audio with english subtitles when applicable.  But it was not before."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-27T12:15Z,"i didn't fix anything.
and like i said before they were all in order to start with."
,omegaviper,2012-04-28T05:06Z,"there is no sense in arguing with ignorance.  I said it as best as possible with all the info anyone could need.  Everything is fine now, like I said earlier so everyone else downloading should be too, that is all."
,pagaria,2012-07-04T07:28Z,"hey man can u do upload this in dual audio please please i really want it if there is dub version!
hey do u have page in facebook or sth? its would be really great if u have one!"
,gravediggernalk,2012-07-04T15:49Z,"Out of curiosity, are any of these files Dual-Audio?"
,NTA-Pro,2012-07-20T01:26Z,I doubt it unless he forgot to put spoken audio as Japanese/English >_>
