PLOT

Lovable mutt SMITTY is left behind by his owners when their
home is foreclosed and they are forced to move. After a cross
country trek, the dog ends up captured and placed in a pound
in Summit Town, Iowa. Meanwhile, thirteen-year-old city-brat
Ben Barrett (Brandon Tyler Russell) has been arrested... and
his struggling, single mother (Mira Sorvino) has had enough of
him getting into mischief. Now, Ben has to spend the summer in
Iowa on a farm run by his tough old grandfather, Jack (Peter
Fonda). Jack figures Ben needs a friend and takes him to visit
the dog pound, where they find SMITTY. Even though its not
pals at first sight - Ben hates that SMITTY insists on
checking his every move - gradually SMITTY, Jack, and their
friendly neighbor (Louis Gossett, Jr.) soon teach Ben life
changing lessons about friendship, family and responsibility
