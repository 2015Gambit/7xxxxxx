The concert held at Haleakala Crater in Hawaii in July of 1970 was supposed to be part of the 
film Rainbow Bridge, but very little of the concert footage was used in the film. Stranger 
still, none of it was used on the soundtrack album Rainbow Bridge. The set has been bootlegged 
in the past, but this marks the first official release of this material. The first set kicks 
off with "Lover Man," and has Hendrix running through a handful of newer tunes before finishing 
the set with several "old favorites." Things start off loose, though not disinterested,
