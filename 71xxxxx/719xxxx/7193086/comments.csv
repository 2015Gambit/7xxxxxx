I still have 2% left (hasn't moved for a couple of days) once it's done I'll gladly seed so you aren't the only one."
,jocool2u,2012-05-23T04:47Z,hey is this subbed?
,Xaftz,2012-05-31T03:51Z,"No this doesnt have subs... 
If you wan't most of the best anime to download in torrents... I recommend http://www.bakabt.com/
they have a ton of seeders, very little leechers, different versions of each torrent, and all with subs.

Just make sure to seed if you download their torrents and don't forget about this torrent if you downloaded it too."
