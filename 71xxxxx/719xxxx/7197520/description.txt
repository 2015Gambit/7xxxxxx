The Kalama's Quartet - Early Hawaiian Classics 1927-1932 (CD320kb)

The Kalama's Quartet performed some of the most beautiful Hawaiian music ever recorded. In many ways they were unlike any other Hawaiian group. They were one of the few to ever use two acoustic steel guitars, and their four-part singing was beautiful and deeply moving. The twenty six selections on this CD represent some of the finest Hawaiian music from the late 1920s.
