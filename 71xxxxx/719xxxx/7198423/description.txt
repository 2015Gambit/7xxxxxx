The complete fiction works of American suspense/mystery writer Michael Connelly, with a few omnibus editions but don't worry even though there are omnibus editions, the books are available individually as well. Still all are retail quality. Compared to the trash available elsewhere. EVEN Blood Work is retail quality cause if you downloaded Blood Work from some where else its just LOADED with errors.
