And yeah antaniuks comment is just a spam thing, but then again why would you click a link to a page that links to http downloads for free when you can jsut click the download link here and get safe and good quality from our beloved eztv :)"

Oh well Episode was AMAZING!!! (no surprises though) but Epic none the less :D"
