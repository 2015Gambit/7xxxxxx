,briebee72,2012-04-19T21:32Z,"OK this is the first cam in a long time that the movie was good enough for me to watch the whole thing even with the cam quality. Useual cam quality picture out of focus in some parts and sound is hallow. and the picture is out of aquare but you get over it in the first 10 mins or so.

Now if someone could just do something about that FUCKING CINIVA SHIT.  Looks liek they finally found something to detur piracy. that sound water mark survives even through cam audio.  cant play any newer films on and newer players or that fucking ciniva cuts the sound and video off after 20 mins when the protection takes hold. I am getting tired of watching this shit on my computer screen because newer equipment detects that ciniva shit.

cant blame them i guess . got to admit this new ciniva shit is a bitch.

For those who have older equipment or watch thier movies on pc its no problem. but this shit suvives the audio being recorded through cam or even phone and newer equipment pics up the audio water mark it sucks. this movie has it too. anyone with newer equiment knows what im talking about... sucks cant watch new shit on tv have to watch on  pc."
,jcadman26,2012-04-20T01:43Z,anyone have any idea why when i start download it says element not found?
,Black_Burd,2012-04-20T16:36Z,When i downloaded it and watched this on VLC... The quality and sound is Shit. Totally Shit.
,corbath,2012-04-20T18:17Z,for a cam this is not bad nice one BONE
,spifkitten99,2012-04-20T23:41Z,"Cropped so much, that it's unwatchable.

For fuck sakes, stop cropping it.  It's not that fucking hard to get the whole picture in the view, and then adjust the angle and size afterwards, without losing so much of it.

Cams are just getting worse and worse."

,spifkitten99,2012-04-21T10:28Z,"The people who call this a ""good cam"", must never have seen a good cam.

I don't blame them, because good cams have become very rare.

There used to be some great cams once. But it's like nobody gives a shit anymore, or there's a new generation that just has no concept of how to do it, and no concept of quality, and then they fuck it up completely, both when they record it, and then again, when they crop and re-encode it.

This is shit. Cams CAN be infinitely better than this. But unfortunately it's been quite a while since I have seen one.

So now people mistakenly think that junk like this one, is good."
