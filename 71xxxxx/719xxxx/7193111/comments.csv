,dimekoza,2012-04-18T19:09Z,"aspect ratio anyone? is it in 16:9? I don't know why nobody rips the movies in 16:9 but i this stupid  21:9 that has the stupid black lines , does anyone have a 21:9 tv?"
,kornchild2002,2012-04-19T01:07Z,"dimekoza, you are retarded.  Different movies are shot in different aspect ratios.  Some directors use ~16X9 to bring the audience closer to the action (as Spielberg did with Jurassic Park).  Others choose the wider aspect ratio to provide a more cinematic experience.

People don't rip wider movies to 16X9 as that would be retarded (like you).  They would have to crop a large portion (~30%) of the movie off the left and right sides just to get rid of those black bars you hate.  Get over it."
,Shadow416,2012-04-19T07:26Z,"Outstanding video quality. The audio IS CINAVIA (or w.e) PROTECTED....so watch on your pc or watch on an xbox360 or a player (dvd/blu ray) that isn't pre-built with cinavia protection (ex: ps3 has cinavia protection so it will detect it)....

Anyways, so i played it on my 360 instead of ps3, worked perfectly, it's just that sometimes the audio would seem louder in some scenes and really quiet in other scenes. This is not uploader fault im pretty sure it has everything to do with the dudes who made the movie n w.e steps they took to putting it on blu ray

however i still give the quality v-10, a-8.5
the movie i gives a 6 at the most...nice action...but movie ended really quick...what was a 1h28min movie felt like 40 minutes"

,Merkarov91,2012-04-22T18:17Z,"thorkis maybe you should do some researching before you make yourself look like an idiot, oh well too late. most films are made in 1.85:1 and 2.39:1. not 16.9 and 16.10, thats what most 'hdtv's are. many blurays come with the black bars and are actually only 1920 x 800, its to do with aspect ratio, not resolution, you do not lose any image quality from 1920 x 800."
,nogloryrory11,2012-04-22T22:18Z,"spkifuhgn,

I think you forgot to qualify that with, 'if you were the last guy on earth and she was in a coma', lol."
,Mr_Gamer,2012-04-23T02:18Z,"Commenting on this aspect ratio thing -

I have a 16:10 screen, before I had a 4:3. A 4:3 was of course great for 4:3 movies. But with widescreen movies I got black bars which made everything smaller. 2.39:1-movies where SOOOO tiny it strained my eyes.

I don't know it mathemattically but I think that only half of my monitor was filled vertically at the time!

Nowadays I - and everyone else - actually have the same problem. 

I damn near hate cinematic formats! Not only because of the black bars, but for the fact that ANY movie shot in - for example - 2.39:1 has the exact same horizontal resolution as a 16:9 movie.

A 1080p 16:9 movie runs at 1920x1080, a
A 1080p 2.39:1 runs at something like 1920x768. So a widescreen movie keeps the 1920, but not the 1080.

So in essence, anything that is >not< 16:9 (and in a sense 4:3) has a LOWER total number of pixels that isn't compensated with a higher horizontal number.

it would make more sense to keep the vertical number at 1080p and then INCREASE the horizontal to ~2592 or so.

That way, an ultra widescreen movie would have MORE DPI instead of less, just becaused the producers and what-not favored that format over a screen-covering 16:9.

Well, that's all I have to say on the matter, feel free to correct me. But don't comment on obvious things, like format limitations that I left out, this isn't really a forum. :D"

When people rip the movie all they have to do is adjust the settings on their rip software so that the AR and resolution stay the same.  2.40:1 aspect ratio is for cinema but for home use it's all in 16:9 as you can see here

,sickEVILmutant,2012-05-25T01:15Z,"Mr_Gamer, resolution has nothing to do with aspect ratio.  

Many different resolutions and aspect ratios are used in actual filming.

Blu-Ray or DVD have specific formats.  These formats include specific combined resolution and aspect ratios.

The fact that one movie may be filmed at 1.85:1 and another at 2.35/2.39/2.40:1 is meaningless when talking about specific media formats, which is why people often praise or complain specific film transfers.

Maybe you ought to google 'aspect ratio' to better understand what the term actually means.  :P
