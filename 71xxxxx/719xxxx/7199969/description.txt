QM 11 ΓÇô Gluons

Neutral Charge Matter quanta that provide an attractive force between similarly charged Matter quanta as described in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Equating the role of hypothesised ΓÇÿGLUONΓÇÖs to the role of neutral Tetryons in Baryonic Matter the dielectric role of ΓÇÿGluonsΓÇÖ is revealed for the first time in recorded history.

The eleventh chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as to explain quantum processes holding Baryonic Matter together at the sub-atomic level.
