S02E05: The Midland Bank Robbery 

On 3 July 1995, 4 masked raiders ambushed a Midland Bank van as it pulled up to the Midland Bank District Service Centre, Salford. As one of the guards entered the building, the driver (Graham Huckerby) was threatened with a pistol and forced to drive to street nearby. Huckerby was forced to open the van, blindfolded, and tied to railings. He was told that his colleague had been taken hostage and would be killed if he did not cooperate.
