,error1169,2012-04-30T13:45Z,"my antivirus is tracking the keygen as a torjan, nice"
,Sacredava,2012-04-30T20:43Z,"When I put in my Authentication code it says that ""The number you have entered is invalid."" even thou put in the number it says in Keygen. Help plz"
,krushed18,2012-05-01T06:22Z,@cristos33 what message does it show? and when? can u describe it...
,krushed18,2012-05-01T06:24Z,@error1169 keygens are sort of trojans because it cracks the softwares and changes the root keys and all... so u've got to turn off the anti-virus and then use it...
,krushed18,2012-05-01T06:25Z,@Sacredava did u check the installation notes...
,sickman112,2012-05-01T11:43Z,"Yeah dude, do I have to register it? Because it says if you don't register you'll have to put in an auth code and the one from the keygen doesn't work."
,mjoraid,2012-05-01T12:04Z,"Ok,, just installed it, went very smooth every thing works perfectly. 
follow the instructions and everything will go well. 
turn antivirus if it causing troubles. 

Just install the current version, do not update. "
,xii13,2012-05-04T03:17Z,"Hey I'm most likely sure i messed up in the key gen i pasted the serial code in but acidentaly hit generate again, would that make the auth. code invalid?"
,Sacredava,2012-05-05T09:10Z,@krushed18 Yeah I did everything according to the installation instructions.
,krushed18,2012-05-05T13:04Z,@sickman112 and @Sacredava i think u both have same problem and it's that u both would've clicked the generate button and entered authentication code of different serial key..i've added in notes that do not click generate button after entering serial key because then it'll show authentication key of other serial key. so try once again. and follow the instructions properly...
,krushed18,2012-05-05T13:06Z,@mjoraid that's absolutely right... please seed =)
,krushed18,2012-05-05T13:08Z,"@xii13 yes, for sure because when u hit generate button it shows totally different keys from the other ones... so u'll have to go back enter correct serial n authentication keys. please seed..."
,Diadoom,2012-05-06T00:55Z,"I have a problem with my keygen. When I start it, even with admin mode, it opens and closes in an instant. Then it disappears, as if it's deleted. I can't find a solution, so I'm hoping someone can help me.
Thanks."
,Diadoom,2012-05-06T11:21Z,Nvm. I solved it. :)
,Lepec93,2012-05-08T03:04Z,Sony Vegas 10.0 and the shared plug-ins file don't show up in the same folder for me. I get an error when patching.
,krushed18,2012-05-08T17:21Z,@Lepec93 u'll find them in the folder in which u have installed the sony vegas...
,Lepec93,2012-05-08T20:18Z,"@krushed18  You are right! But now I am having problems with the authentication code. I am not clicking generate after I enter the serial number like some of the other users might have had trouble with but it is still not accepting the authentication code. I pressed ""register online"" like the instructions said but I saw that someone on youtube had registered via another computer and used an application he had downloaded to register it...is this related?"
,krushed18,2012-05-09T08:06Z,@Lepec no i don't think so...
,reduxx,2012-05-11T03:20Z,Works absolutely flawlessly on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit! Thanks krushed18!

,DarkMatterHeart,2012-05-24T22:48Z,"I followed the instructions correctly but the activation code won't work properly. I've noticed a few other people having this issue as well, has anyone figured out why yet?"
,melly_mac,2012-05-28T17:10Z,"i did the instructions perfectly but when i copy the activation/authentication code, it says its not correct. i didnt press generate to change it, so what am i doing wrong?"
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-05-29T13:16Z,@krushed18! Keygens are not sort of trojans. You can make them without trojans. If you are getting the alert is because someone put one in there to screw up people systems. Injecting a trojan into the exe so easy to do. That is why the antivirus is alerting people. I had the luxury of looking over the exe and and there are 3 injectors in this exe. If you ran it! they are in your system.
,KALIBURN,2012-06-14T04:55Z,MAKE SURE TO RUN  THE CRACK AS AN ADMINISTRATOR OR ELSE YOU WILL SEE AN ERROR AFTERWARDS. - HOPE THIS HELPS.
,vecuccio,2012-06-16T10:43Z,Doesn't support XP64 - that goes for both the 32bit AND 64bit versions. It just says you need to have SP3 blah blah blah - the usual message for non-support of XP64.
,Deko260,2012-07-02T07:11Z,"Dont download this shit, this have a Trojan!"
,SinisterH,2012-08-26T11:08Z,SO does it work or not???
