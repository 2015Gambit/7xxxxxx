Stair building combines precision carpentry with tricky math, so even experienced builders can find it challenging. But as this extensively illustrated book demonstrates, any builder who can measure the distance between two floors can plan and build a stunning set of stairs. By clearly laying out the geometry, planning, and construction involved, author Andy Engel takes the reader from a simple structure of framing lumber to a set of stairs fit for a king. From building and installing railings to using off-the-shelf stair parts, Building Stairs lays out the process clearly and completely. All the reader needs to is a router, saw, drill, and level. This elevating book fills in all the rest -- step by step by step.
