Anyone else having issues opening the twixtor exe, I keep getting the warning that 'Internet security setting prevented the file from being opened'. "

go to control panel, type internet options

go to security tab

go to rescricted sites, and lower everything

then use ""run as administrator"" on installer

raise the security after install
