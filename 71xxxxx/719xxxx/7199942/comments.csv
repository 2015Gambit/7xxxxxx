The idea of being so ""dangerous"" or whatever to the powers that be that they would persecute him is like a wet dream to his type. In reality even were the gov't really like he imagined a man like him would be beneath notice. He managed to run afoul of the law, but naturally it was all ""persecution"". He was probably never happier than when arrested and imprisoned, validating his sense of importance, and  ""proving"" in his mind the truth of his claims."
