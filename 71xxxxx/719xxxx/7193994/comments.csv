,poyoxpodri2,2012-04-20T19:12Z,"Hey, help me with the subs (English-Spanish) 
SUBS 12, how Can I do, to insert them in the file???"
,srbtzrtvgsdfbetrtriihjb,2012-04-21T23:48Z,"people are not seeding because this is a terrible, terrible movie. 
i ain't seeding that garbage either. "
,OKAPI,2012-04-22T13:03Z,"In reality, this is a movie, without any sense!!!
Many known faces and Gina carano running from side to side, punching a lot! Argument (!!!) ZERO!!!
One of the worst movies i ever seen!"
,zamora21,2012-04-22T15:38Z,"Hey BOZX, la bajĂŠ completa, pero no corre, no funciona, not function, not play"
,telepirat,2012-04-25T02:20Z,"I downloaded a different rip, but I read the comments on this page bashing this movie and I felt like I had to reply to these idiots that are so stupid they don't even know they're stupid: guys, you're so stupid you don't even know you're stupid. This movie is great in so many ways. I just wish that it finished some 15 minutes sooner, with the denouement left for a sequel!"
,scrubs1818,2012-04-26T13:59Z,"so does that mean that there's subtitles for non spoken english parts but no subs in the movie??? 

sooo tired of downloading movies with foreign speaking parts and there's no friggin english subs for it...absolutely ridiculous "
,telepirat,2012-04-27T10:16Z,"The movie is entirely in English. Oh, exept for one line where a guy says ""Ija de puta""!"
,scrubs1818,2012-04-27T13:09Z,thx man
,Aim_To_Maim,2012-04-28T12:42Z,@UlrikR You've got a fucking browser loser so use it to find some subtitles instead of just being an ungrateful dick. LOSER =)
,FANKAAR,2012-05-01T16:39Z,"A / V = 10 

movie sux though ..."
,Powerslave0,2012-05-11T06:28Z,"Horrible movie... Bad acting, bad fight scenes, and just overall slow...  The choreography is horrible.."
,vianiznice,2012-05-14T18:37Z,@UlrikR: Because fetching your own god damn subs's so hard. Perhaps you should take a few linguist lessons and you wont have to tunnelvision those subtitles.
