,m00sehound,2012-04-26T04:02Z,Sorry about the strange file size etc - could only find an mp4 of this episode & converted it to an avi before uploading here - don't know too much about the converting process but figured any kind of divx would be appreciated and there wasn't any other copy of it available on here at the time.
,sween64,2012-04-26T06:03Z,Yes thank you again. Where'd you find the mp4?  I hope you upload episode 2.
,m00sehound,2012-04-27T02:23Z,Found this Ep on a blog called Magzcrib - had links to the mp4 & grabbed it from there.  I see they have one for Ep 2 on there this morning too.
