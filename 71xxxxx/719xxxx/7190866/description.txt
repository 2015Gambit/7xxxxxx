All recordings are unabridged Mono CBR Fraunhofer MP3 and from CD.

These are narrations, not dramatisations.

The narrators include - James Saxon, Rosemary Leach, Rosalind Ayres, Stephanie Cole and Joan Hickson.

I have paid particular attention to narrators and have chosen the ones that I consider the best for each book - sometimes there was little choice due to narrator availability and/or sound quality!

I have deliberately tried to avoid readings by Joan Hickson, but it would appear she is the only narrator available for the two volumes of Miss Marple short stories.
The title numbering is by year of publication of the original book.
