,sammyboblammy,2012-04-18T07:55Z,Well done and thank you. The DEEP video is very good and the audio sync is good enough. I imagine that a lot of work went into this and it is much appreciated. Keep in mind that I think it is more than watchable but I am using a handheld device. Thank you for up Hero.
