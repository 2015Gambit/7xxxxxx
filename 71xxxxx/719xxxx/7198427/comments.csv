,summer1967love,2012-04-20T02:38Z,"thanks for the taste, cuz..."
,DrBromberg,2012-04-22T15:55Z,"the real question is what is the source? because this looks like a shitty webrip from a youtube or soundcloud stream. and for anyone who thinks you can ""upconvert"" a song, go an-hero. just checked the spectral and this appears to be one of those aforementioned ""upconverts"" of a 160kbs streams. 

you cannot add audio data that is not there!"
,stl98789,2012-04-25T03:00Z,"torrent is crap. Low quality direct youtube rip, not properly tagged, no artwork."
,ExitTheSpine,2012-04-30T20:46Z,"of course its low quality, look at the date. When I ripped it, the ONLY source even available was the one from YouTube.

This torrent exists so that you can play that song from YouTube on your mp3 player and at least have the song until the album comes out. And when it was ripped from YouTube, all the settings were maxed out, so I got from it the best I could've while staying in MP3.

As for no album artwork, just save the fucking picture from the top of this page it's not that hard.
