Rls info:

Ovnimoon Records welcomes Trinodia aka Daniel Eldstroem to our label with a presentation of his newest full length album titled 'Stargazing'.

From track one through to track eight the listener will be shocked and amazed to hear such artistic and perfectly crafted old school style Goa trance music made with completely modern production quality. The album gets capped off with track nine giving a taste from his down-tempo chill-out side project Voxel9.

'Stargazing' is a concept album with each track having a focus on deep space observations, presented through intelligent and epic melodic sounds and patterns not heard often in current music trends.

Daniel is from Sweden and first found his love for performing psychedelic trance in 1992, since then he has been perfecting his sound and releasing his musical creations on his own and through net-labels since 2003.

All psytrance fans are sure to enjoy this musical adventure through the cosmos while at home or while trancing on your favourite dance-floors anywhere in the universe. Be prepared for much more amazing music from Trinodia as well as upcoming albums from his Voxel9 ambient side project.
