A race of creatures known as the Scythe have become a plague in the universe. Cunning and powerful foes, they possess the ability to transform into anything from which they have consumed DNA. On a mission to stop the plague that her people unleashed, a beautiful alien named Ava has followed the Scythe to Earth. Meanwhile, six college friends blowing off steam on a camping trip find themselves caught up in a cat and mouse hunt with the Scythe. Not knowing what to do or whom to trust, they struggle to protect themselves and keep it together. Reluctantly joining forces with Ava, they quickly learn what they are up against.
