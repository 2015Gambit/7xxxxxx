,sloweddi,2012-04-17T03:01Z,The same cam as all the other cams.  so nothing new
,Hilpi75,2012-04-17T08:20Z,In what Fairy-Tale world would this be watchable??  This is the WORST COPY OUT THERE!!  Sorry globeplus but it's the truth..  Can't see a thing in this version..  Like someone used a 5 year old Mobile Phone to record this movie
,Iceman480,2012-04-17T12:44Z,Sorry Globe I have to agree with Dom. Yes I am a fan of your work. But stick to what you do best. Thanks for the try anway.
