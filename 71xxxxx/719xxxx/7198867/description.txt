Note: big thanks to inspiral for there mission again on this one
work-wise i got it to the 48.50 mark to chop both videos and filter
each part diffrently i do believe inspiral append 41secs of 26k
release near the 59mark plus this is an extra 1min longer bonus enjoy 

Note2: only did 1 sample as it shows it going
over to the other source plus did more screens
of the new source then old to show the new abit more
