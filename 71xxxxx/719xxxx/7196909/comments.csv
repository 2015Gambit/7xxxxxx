Is Set it Off the actual 2004 version? or the original 2001? if it's the 2004 then there is really no need for that's what people do, because it is just the 2001 version of set it off + that's what people do."

,elgo2006,2012-09-01T18:34Z,"@TorrentTracts, Set It Off was originally released in 2001, and later re-released in 2004. The version you have listed for 2004 is the version that was released in 2004. You can check it out on Wikipedia:

By any chance do you take requests?"
,tholleyos,2012-09-12T07:37Z,"Yes, I forgot to check back on here, but eigo2006 is right, it was re-released on T&N, and they just added That's what people do to the end of it, and added a new song to the start.  It does look misleading though the way you have it that Set it Off is after phenomenon, because Set it Off was their first major release, then Phenomenon came after."
