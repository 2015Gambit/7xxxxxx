,TorrentMan7120,2012-04-17T16:07Z,"update: only the operating systems (OS 9.2.2 and OS 10.1.2 are for powerPC). 

Roxio Toast WORKS (tested) on both Intel and PowerPC macs (works on hackintoshes, too)

The Apple App. disk included might work on intel macs / hackintoshes. 

The Apple Hardware test might also work on intel macs, i don't know what results it will produce on a hackintosh. "

Works like a charm. 

Just a question: Do you have a MacOS10.5 for G5-CPU? If you could upload this, it would be very nice. "
,TorrentMan7120,2012-04-17T23:44Z,"@jumjumb: 

Glad i could help out. I don't have MacOS 10.5 for PPC CPU (G5), unfortunately. I don't even own / use a mac, i found these disks @ a friend's place and decided to share (especially MacOS 9.2.2 which is quite hard to find). I think you can find MacOS 10.5 for PPC somewhere here...

Cheers !"
,jumjumb,2012-04-19T11:21Z,"Torrent man thanks anyway. :o)

here are some torrents with the Mac OS 10.5 version, but they don't actualize the previous OS. They overwrite it. Thats why I gave a try by asking you. 

Thanks anyway. I hope to see more good uploads like this one in the future.  ;o)

Best Regards from Greece."
