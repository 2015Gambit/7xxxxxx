This is a torrent, containing multiple ISO's created after the original CD's bundled with a PowerMac G4, back in 2000.

Most ISO's are bootable and can be burned from any OS (Linux, Windows, MacOS) by any ISO Burning capable application (UltraISO, Nero, etc.). The discs produced can only be read on MacOS. The images are 100% identical clones of the original discs, nothing added, nothing removed. No serial number protection to my knowledge.

If you don't need the whole package (this is quite big) only download the ISO you need from the torrent. 

This release is for POWER PC Processors ONLY; it won't work on Intel Macs and Hackintoshes. 

Will work on PowerPC G3, PowerPC G4 (tested). May work on other PowerPC macs as well, find a wiki on MacOS 9.2.2 and MacOS 10.1.2 on google and check it out.  

To boot from a CD on a G4 inser the disk, restart the computer while pressing the 'c' key on the keyboard. Only release the key when the boot sequence has started from the CD. 

Cheers !
