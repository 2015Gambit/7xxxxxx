      1 x 90:00 min Four days after the first SCUD missiles fell on        
      Israel and weeks before the official start of the Gulf war, 8        
   members of Britain's SAS entered Iraq in secret. With many fearing      
    a nuclear retaliation from Israel, their mission was to find and       
    destroy the source of the missiles being fired. But the operation      
       went spectacularly wrong. The SAS force was discovered and          
   attacked. Some of the men were killed while others tried to escape      
        by walking 200 miles across the Iraqi desert. Essentially          
    abandoned, the men were left to fend for themselves, deep inside       
      Iraq. For the first time, retired USAF General Charles Horner        
      reveals why the men of the Bravo Two Zero Patrol were sent on        
     their perilous mission and surviving members of the team, Cpl.        
     Chris Ryan and Sgt. Andy McNab, recall their harrowing ordeal.
