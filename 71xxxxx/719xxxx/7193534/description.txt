Couldn't find this anywhere on the internet in any of the SparkChart collections. So I figured I would scan and upload mine. Six pages in .PDF format, high quality. Once I get the "German Verbs" and "German Vocabulary" ones I will upload those as well.

Hopefully this will be of great help to those studying the German language, as it has helped me. Be sure to seed so others can get it too. 

Viel Spa√ü!
