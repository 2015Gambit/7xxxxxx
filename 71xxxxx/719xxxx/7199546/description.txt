About the Game

Zombie Panic: Source is a cooperative survival horror Half-Life 2 Modification, the sequel to the popular Half-Life Modification "Zombie Panic". As a member of a party of survivors you find yourself without provisions or any military support. Fending off the undead has never been more difficult, but with a large variety of fire arms, explosives, and unique items, the task is not impossible. This time through we introduce you to new characters that you can control, numerous weapons including a large list of melee weapons, and the Carrier zombie which can turn friend into foe. We started it all and are happily continuing the fight!
