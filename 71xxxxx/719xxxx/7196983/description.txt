Pleased to Meet You is the ninth studio album by British rock band James. The album was released in July 2001 via Mercury Records. Despite it being the band's first album not to reach the top 10 in the UK since Strip-mine (excepting the experimental Wah Wah), the album was widely regarded as one of their best pieces of work. Indeed, Allmusic described the album as their "tightest, freshest, most contemporary batch of songs, weatherproofed to stand the test of time". One single, "Getting Away With It (All Messed Up)", was released from the album.

The album's front cover features a composite image of all the band members' faces.
