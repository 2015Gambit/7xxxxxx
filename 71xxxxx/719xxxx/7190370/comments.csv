,amerikhun,2012-04-16T20:06Z,"dudes you can download 1.09 patch, thats the latest one... actually i dont know what that does with this version. but i think its okay http://www.ausgamers.com/files/details/html/547"
,amerikhun,2012-04-16T20:19Z,"okay so the game is currently 1.08 version, and if you want to play on 1.09, you have to use the iso file, install to the DEFAULT FOLDER, not anywhere else, and you overwrite the files from my .7z file, to that installed directory, and you run the patch.exe"
,amerikhun,2012-04-16T20:21Z,"if you do this, the game wil lbe in C:Program FilesDiablo directory, so if you are on win7, you need to type 
@echo off
taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
C:Program FilesDiabloDiablo.exe
pause
start explorer.exe
exit
 to your .bat file"
