,evilg0d,2012-07-03T13:34Z,Thanks for sharing this. I truly appreciate it.
,evilg0d,2012-07-03T18:00Z,"ÂľTorrent states ""Error: Invalid download state, try resuming"". All attempts to resume or re-download torrent has made no difference.
I'm an experienced pirate but I've not encountered this before. Do any of you fine folk have any suggestions that may help?"
,nedand,2012-07-07T11:40Z,Thank you very much!
,TxJag,2012-07-13T08:13Z,"@evilg0d did you alter the torrent file as you were downloading? Did you delete ""Torrent downloaded from demonoid.txt"" even though you selected all files to download?"
,resmith,2012-08-26T13:50Z,Would Hells Corner be in this collection? Also you can convert these books to pdf at www.convertfiles.com/convert/ebook/EPUB-to-MOBI.html or  ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-pdf The odd time I need to use both links. 
,resmith,2012-08-26T13:55Z,"23 books in total & Hells Corner is here as well. Thanks so much, now I can read this in bed & my novel during the daytime hours. Much appreciated."
