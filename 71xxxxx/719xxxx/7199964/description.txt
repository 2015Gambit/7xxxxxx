QM 10 - Baryons

The Charge 36Pi geometry of Baronic Matter in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

The Second elemental charged geometry of Matter [Baryons] with elemental charges of [-12,0,+12] are revealed.

The full geometry of the ΓÇÿParticle ZooΓÇÖ Baryons is illustrated along with numerous examples of Baryonic Matter geometries for the first time in recorded history.

The tenth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as a foundation into Quark interactions and Baryonic geometries.
