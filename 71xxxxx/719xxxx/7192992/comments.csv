There's a very easy fix for this:

1. Go to imdb.com and enter the movie name - remember... YOU MUST PRESS ENTER OR SUBMIT. You can't just type it in.
2. Select the appropriate title from the search results. You must click on it. Computers are NOT telepathic (yet).
3. Gather the information you seek about the title from the title page. This is typically done by ""reading"". For the sake of this tutorial, I'm assuming you can do so. If not, there are plenty of resources in your community (many of them free) that can assist you with furthering your education.
4. STFU and quit being a pathetic whiner. No one likes a whiny loser that constantly complains. If you're incapable of doing this, please remove yourself from contact with other (somewhat) normal humans.
5. If you need help with any of the above instructions, feel free to contact me. I'm sure the above may seem challenging, but you can do it!

Thanks!"

My apologies for misspelling your screen name. I'll try to avoid this in any future contact we may have.

I also just realized you may already have an answer to your first question. Given the title of this release, it probably has something to do with dragons.

Best of luck!"
