,canopener,2012-04-24T17:52Z,"+1. Good download. I always try to go with DTS instead of AC3.

V: 9/10
A: 9/10
M: 7/8

Something was a little off with the ""quality"", but it was still enjoyable.

I enjoyed it, but thought the movie was imitating Neo from the Matrix, Alice from Resident Evil, and some Blade and Ultraviolet moments. They were just too easily taken down...."
,dimekoza,2012-04-25T14:16Z,"At galnegg well i'm not going to watch it in a cinema, i'm going to watch it on a 16:9 tv, and btw i bet that 99% of the people downloading are going to watch it on their 16:9 tv sets. so when you rip the movie make shore that you adjust the resolution hence the AR so that people can watch the movie without the black lines on top and bottom"
