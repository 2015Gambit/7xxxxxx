ocalPoint 2 is an amazing new application that allows you to simulate the blur and depth of field you would think could only be done in camera. But what if you can't shoot a f/1.2 or even f/2.8 and you want that soft, creamy background? That's where FocalPoint 2 comes in to save the day.
FocalPoint 2 lets you create realistic selective focus, depth-of-field and vignette effects that tell your viewers exactly where to look. The intuitive FocusBug controller is just like using a tilt-shift or selective focus lens right inside of Adobe Photoshop.

Set your area of focus and then select a lens to simulate or create your own by controlling the amount and kind of blur, even in 3D. With the new FocusBrush tool you can paint sharpness or blur where you want it. It has never been easier or faster to focus your viewer's eye and minimize distractions.
