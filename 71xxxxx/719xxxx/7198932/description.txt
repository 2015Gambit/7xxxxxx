This is the "No Network Available" CybercafePro fix. It is a temporal fix as we await for the able support team of cybercafepro to come up with an online fix for the same problem as they had promised. Replace this with your new DB folder in C:Program FilesCybercafePro Server folder and you are good to go. Incase of any questions, let me know via bomb2030@yahoo.com or bomb2060 on youtube. I will provide  a youtube video for this fix, if Cybercafe pro support team would not have reacted by next week. Please let me know if it works well with you.
