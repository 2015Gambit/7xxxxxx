,macfaji,2012-09-08T07:59Z,"Trying to open this with Daemon Tools lite.

When I either drag the .iso or click mount to the virtual drive I always get an error message: ""Unable to access image file""

I've also tried with the physical DVD drive disabled and also with Safedisc4 running.

what am I doing wrong?"
