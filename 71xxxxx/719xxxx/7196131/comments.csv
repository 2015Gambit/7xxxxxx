,temporary2010,2012-04-19T03:35Z,"I can't about this specific torrent, but Underworld.Awakening.2012.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-DON
has been floating around other sites (direct download) for a couple of days.  I'ts an undersized P2P release, though, so I'm waiting for a Scene release.

Just Google the filename, and check for other people's comments."
,DarkComp,2012-04-19T06:31Z,"Underworld.Awakening.2012.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-DON has very good quality.
I guess the other releases are in very good quality too. :)
Download and seed pls."

,bobbysg,2012-04-22T05:06Z,"The proper term is Tetralogy, not quadrilogy. Quadrilogy is a neologism made up by marketing buffoons unable to differentiate between latin and greek. Don't be like them.

For that matter, a trilogy, tetralogy, etc, should refer to a completed series of the given number of works, not a series in progress. I would assume Underworld will be back with a fifth and probably a sixth entry. In cases where the series is yet open ended, simply use the word ""series.""

OK, rant over. I'm sure you did a fine job with the upload. "
