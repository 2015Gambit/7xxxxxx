,ShangaiMoon,2012-06-12T00:26Z,"Great torrents, works like a charm!

However, for all the newbies like myself:

1 - Run core_keygen.dmg (in keygen folder) and click on Patch
2 - Run Setup.dmg (in setup folder)
3 - Run AcrobatUpd1013 (in update folder)
4 - After those two installed, run the program, it will ask for a key: go back to keygen, click on Generate, put the key where asked.
5 - Enjoy a great program :)
6 - Seed and thank to the uploader


Thanks Ching_Liu! :)"

It should ask you for a new key, grab it from the keygen and you're good to go."

,tryingout,2012-06-23T00:45Z,I followed the directions but when I try to view a PDF it asks for a serial number. Any idea how to resolve? Thanks!
,krmark,2012-08-05T23:12Z,"Aug 5, 2012 - worked perfect for me! Thanks Ching_Liu for upload. Followed ShangaiMoon's instructions and no problems here. Not sure what Step 1 does, but followed anyways, and works great! Thanks Shangai! Running on new Retina Display MacBook Pro and works great. "
