You know what I love? Free music. You know what makes free music even better? When it's attached to a rad game. The Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP PC edition will be offering just that (as if you needed any other reason to check out the quirky, critically acclaimed game). 



Jim Guthrie's legendarily epic Sword & Sworcery LP: The Ballad of the Space Babies is a landmark prog rock concept album from the noted composer. Jim's compositions were named "The Best Videogame Music of 2011" by Kotaku, while Double Fine's Tim Schafer said "The music is amazing. I want Jim Guthrie to score my life."
