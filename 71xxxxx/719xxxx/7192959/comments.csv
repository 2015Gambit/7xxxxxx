[T],bill_214,2012-04-22T05:35Z,"Hey uploader!

If you don't know what the fuck you're doing why don't you get some help? 

NOT ONE SINGLE ONE OF YOUR TORRENTS IS DOWNLOADING!!!!!

There's no fucking way that a torrent this size is dead in just a few days if you actually uploaded it at all....

... are you sure you remembered to actually delete the torrent you uploaded and then to download the torrent from this page? 

JUST ADDING THE TRACKERS TO YOUR TORRENT WILL NOT WORK! You absolutely MUST delete the torrent you uploaded and then download the torrent from the site and point it at where you have the file... otherwise you will get what you have with every single one of your torrents, no one able to download.

Notice your ratio on your uploads, if it's ""0"" then what I have described is likely what's happening (or NOT happening, as is the case)

Don't sweat it, everyone has to learn somewhere... don't mind helping you out with some tech support if you need it."

Thanks, I did not know that at all and I looked for instructions when I had something that I thought would be of interest. I thought I was doing everything right. Do you have any useful links?"
[T],bill_214,2012-04-24T21:37Z,"No useful links for you on this subject but most trackers tell you that much on their uploading pages/forms.

You can also find stuff on the forums although I haven't looked for any of it in years and it may be gone since they chenged the forum format... I'm betting you can still find stuff there.

Pornbay also has/had some useful info on setting ports and such but I haven't been there in a while because they pissed me off with their idiotic/inconsistent rules a couple years ago.

Most private trackers also have some type of forum and usually you can find titorials and such there."
