[V],psspss,2012-04-19T11:49Z,"this is great quality btw even if its not a mp4 :)

oddily I was the first to add to public p2ps by looks

i used a higher bitrate on this one

again taps drop the ball.. why no full spectrum or
thermal when walking the halls?
or laser grid as they could see movement

hmmm"

,Santa-san,2012-04-23T13:29Z,"And Rambo107: I couldn't agree with you more -__-""  ""Jason & Grant Show"" spot on"
,Optimus_past_my_Prime,2012-05-17T03:29Z,"@Rambo107 I couldn't agree more with what you're saying about the camera never facing where the action is happening. After what, 8 seasons and still no concrete proof these guys aren't really helping the cause for the proving existence of ghosts."
