,AnOkAlias,2012-04-30T20:49Z,"Thanks so much for sharing this!

It's unfortunate that there's no album art included with this, but... what IS here is top quality, so... many thanks!

I'll seed this... for a while... to at LEAST a 10:1 ratio."
,AnOkAlias,2012-04-30T21:03Z,"Well... ""problem"" solved. I took a lil look around & found some high quality scans of the front & back covers of the CD, as well as a scan of the CD itself. To keep it as simple as possible, I just uploaded them to imgur as an album... here's the link.

,kilowees,2012-09-22T02:45Z,Not very good quality. Really scratchy at high volume...
