"Salon of the Dead"

To celebrate their official coming out as a 
couple, Blair and Dan host a glamorous 
British-themed Salon, including guests 
Julian Tepper and Jenna Gribbon (founders 
of The Oracle Club). Lola lands the 
audition of a lifetime, but Gossip Girl may 
have other plans for the Upper East Side's 
latest It Girl. Meanwhile, Lily and Rufus 
disagree over the best way to handle the 
Ivy situation, and Serena and Diana face-
off over secrets they both would prefer 
remain secrets.

Evolve... or die.
