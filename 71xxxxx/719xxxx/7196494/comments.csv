,raymond_u,2012-04-19T11:19Z,Hey mate - is this S08E05 or S07E05? The current Apprentice UK is Series 8.
,tonygestaple,2012-04-19T11:54Z,"@raymond_u...I don't think they did a 'You're Fired' for the first of the apprentice series, only started from the second, which is why they're one number behind. It confuses me at times! lol"
,raymond_u,2012-04-19T20:25Z,"@tonygestaple thanks for your reply. So this will be the one attached to the S08E05 episode of Apprentice, right?"

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 9 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum & fakes (after theyve been online at least 60mins)  thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
