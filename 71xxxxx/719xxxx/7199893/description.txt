Gareth DicksonΓÇÖs 2009 release ΓÇÿCollected RecordingsΓÇÖ showed the world that beautiful acoustic/ambient music could be made with simply an acoustic guitar, a spot of vocals and just the right amount of reverb. Dickson rather successfully created an album that at times resembled something that one might expect to hear from the likes of Brian Eno and at other times managed to pull off the vulnerability of Nick DrakeΓÇÖs vocal style. It was a luscious album that progressed through its tracks with such a startling beauty. ItΓÇÖs an album of raw, barely touched (in the studio, I mean) soulful folk musicΓÇª
