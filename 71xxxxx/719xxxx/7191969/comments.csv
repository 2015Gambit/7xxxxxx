,alexzcamp,2012-06-04T00:04Z,"you guys are stupid as shit. That's AVG acting up because you have the keygen .exe... which is actually a doc file anyways. Worked for me, and NO virus :D"
,AFantasyBabe,2012-06-04T23:46Z,I downloaded it and let it get past my firewall... yes I'm blonde. But now that its on there the result is that notepad opens like a Bazillion times. How do I get it off? And if its not a virus it sure acts like one. I tried opening it in safe mode but nothing worked.
