Hi,

I had a hard time in compiling the monthly indie playlists. So much material but not much that could thrill me. It all sounded a bit intoxicated; tiered. So I was looking for supplemental tracks to make the lists complete.

So I came across some favourite indie songs and compiled two new playlists: Black Balloons and City Lights. An Easy and a more Inspiring one. Just the way Indie Rock sounds really new to me. And I think both playlists are in a way the best so far.

 
Enjoy and seed,
