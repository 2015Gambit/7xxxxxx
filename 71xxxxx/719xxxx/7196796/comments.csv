,cactjunk,2012-04-19T04:39Z,Released 6 minutes after airing - it really is mental how quick scene releases are today and how much we take for granted. Cheers ettv
,extreme_one,2012-04-19T04:47Z,Lovely!
,cactjunk,2012-04-19T05:05Z,Audio becomes out-of-sync about 15min in - avoid. ty anyway though
,extreme_one,2012-04-19T05:11Z,"yeah, audio is broken =("

,BlackandBad,2012-04-19T05:50Z,nuked file....and boring episode fyi
,strathmeyer,2012-04-19T06:07Z,"So apparently this 'proves' ettv is just stealing the file from eztv. Explains the unnecessary extra files and unnecessary comments on the show. Not sure why ettv is marked with a green skull, is there any way to block his posts entirely?"
,eurasian_farmer,2012-04-19T06:14Z,"Lame!! Sound goes WAYYY out of Sync!!!

,akshaii,2012-04-19T07:13Z,"DONT DOWNLOAD THIS AUDIO FUCKS UP IN MIDDLE OF THE EPISODE, THERE ARE COMMERCIAL SOUNDS PLAYSTATION ETC., INSTEAD OF TALKING SOUND, SERIOUSLY CRAPPIEST EPISODE OF SOUTHPARK EVER EVEN IT WAS PROPER :("
,Spudgun17,2012-04-19T19:02Z,"It amazes me how much people moan like frig about pretty much anything. I've downloaded shit loads of stuff from ettv, and so far the quality has always been top notch, and his green skull is well-deserved in my humble opinion. There is another ettv upload of this episode - 175.1mib, and the A/V is 10, so I recommend you download that version. And remember that stuff from Pirate Bay is bloody FREE!!"
