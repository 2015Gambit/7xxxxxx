,Kalohux,2012-04-17T04:12Z,"NOW THE CULTURAL MARXISTS HOMOSEXUAL HELL HAS SPREAD TO THIS SERIE ALSO! 
I AM SO SICK OF GETTING YOUR TWISTED PERVERTED SEXUAL PREFERENCES SHOVED DOWN MY THROAT!

GO FUCKING KILL YOURSELVES!!!"
,zx6rider,2012-04-17T05:54Z,"Thanks a million Dibya great torrent as always.
@Kalohux I think your a latent homosexual . You commented on every single Spartcus torrent about the homosexuality now this.Your posts prove that you have watched these shows and you continue to. Why would you complain about something that you obviously have an interest in?"
,grpm,2012-04-17T06:06Z,"@Kalohux Homosexuality has existed since the beginning of times, in the ancient Rome, middle age and nowadays, so stop being a jerk and learn how to deal with it."
,PouKii,2012-04-17T06:41Z,Why is this too slow? Too many leechers?
,PouKii,2012-04-17T06:56Z,"oh, there it goes! Thanks!"
,Ponyoo,2012-04-17T07:11Z,cheers
,cayrikan,2012-04-17T07:40Z,Kalohux you halfwit fool 
,Kalohux,2012-04-17T12:12Z,"Yeah and people that think puke is disgusting, latently love puke."
,Hokrollo,2012-04-17T22:09Z,"Is it possible that you could compress the file somehow in the future? Just to cut a bit of the huge size. It just takes an enormous amount of time to download, due to the size and bad seed/leech ratio. "
,cayrikan,2012-04-18T04:54Z,its the speed the problem more than the size of the file. I dont want to watch every show on tv as 1080i but for crying out loud game of thrones is better than 90% of movies out there. However i dont know how compressed these are and why they arent in deinterlaced/progressive mkv. 
,zx6rider,2012-04-19T06:37Z,"You are not going to eve find a 1080i file under 3 gigs, no matter how its encoded or compressed."
,joemama77ca,2012-04-19T08:10Z,The title says DD5.1 (Dolby Digital 5.1) but the audio is actually only 2 channel.
,cayrikan,2012-04-19T19:48Z,"only the intro is 2.1, the rest is 5.1, thats how it is with every video."
,mia_b,2012-04-22T03:10Z,Is anyone else getting those vertical lines whenever the scene changes? I'm just wondering if it's my computer or the torrent.
,joemama77ca,2012-04-22T05:38Z,When I open the file in MediaInfo it says it's 2 channels: L and R.
,cayrikan,2012-04-22T23:36Z,"@mia_b

you have to deinterlace, if using vlc, go to video and turn on deinterlace, mode can be bob/linear/yadif2x 

@joemama77ca

use vlc's media info tool and you will see it change as it plays."
,joemama77ca,2012-04-24T02:01Z,"@cayrikan Ah yes, you are correct! Interesting! Thanks!"
