I have a website that promotes what I believe to be the best House music in existence.  I've also made a separate 30 second sample torrent containing samples of all the tracks I list on my website.  I have gotten a few complaints from people who were all rankled because I only had 30 second samples of the tracks I selected in the torrent instead of full length remixes.  The reason I only had that torrent with 30 second samples was because the situation is this: good, decent House music is dying.  In a perfect world where money didn't exist I would be more than happy to share my whole collection with everyone.  Even if I did share my whole collection it would be about 52 Gigs!  That's too much for me to upload.  People aren't purchasing music like they should anymore.  And because of that this genre and music you find in this torrent are no longer being created.  I created my website to highlight which remixes by the various top House music producers were actually released and could be purchased.  All this file-sharing has been great for getting the word out about certain music.  But music as a business is very hard to be sustainable especially when people are not buying the music and are just downloading everything for free.  That's why in this torrent you get the best of both worlds.  I included 30 second samples of what tracks are released and that you can purchase (these are marked with a '$' in the torrent), plus I included his full-length remixes which I have determined to the best of my ability are not released and you can't purchase on the Internet.  That's not to say they won't ever be released in the future!  But if they are and you know they are then you are obligated to purchase those tracks as well.  We can't let this genre die!  Also you might notice a few tracks with this '造' symbol at the front of them.  These tracks were available for purchase at one time but have since been removed from wherever they were sold.  Keep an eye out and if they get released again, please purchase them."
