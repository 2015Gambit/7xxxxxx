Lift off into the latest Zombies epic with "Rezurrection," the new downloadable content pack for "Call of Duty: Black Ops," and the first to launch players into space for a new dimension of undead action!
Old school Zombie strategies get blown out of the airlock in "Moon," where armed with new perks and a space-age arsenal of weapons, our heroes must overcome undead astronauts and fluctuating gravity as they unearth conspiracies that began in 1943.
Rounding out Rezurrection are the 4 maps that spawned the Zombie phenomenon: "Nacht der Üntoten," "Verrückt," "Shi No Numa" and "Der Riese."
The Rezurrection content pack includes:
The all new Moon level
Four re-mastered levels of Zombie lore: Nacht der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa and Der Riese, the Zombie factory that started it all
An enhanced Zombies Soundtrack including, three tracks never before available for purchase
A new Zombies Moon theme
For our fans that purchased the Black Ops Hardened or Prestige Editions, the entire Rezurrection content pack will be free, including Moon, the four re-mastered maps, the soundtrack and the theme, by simply re-downloading their Classic Zombies Pack.
