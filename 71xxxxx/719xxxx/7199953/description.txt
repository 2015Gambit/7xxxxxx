QM 09 - Mesons

The sub-atomic geometry of Quark-antiQuark pairings in Tetryonics [the Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter]

Providing a window on the geometry and decay paths of all Meson geometries within Tetryonics.

The geometries and interaction angles of Charged 12nPi geometries is revealed for the first time in recorded history.

The ninth chapter in the premier release of Tetryonics - The Charged geometry of mass-ENERGY-Matter it serves as an introduction to the geometric maths behind the Science of the new millennia.
