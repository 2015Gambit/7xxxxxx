Nanosaur 2 is a continuation of the original Nanosaur storyline, only this time you get to fly a pteradactyl who's loaded with hi-tech weaponry, and the game is much larger than the original 1998 Nanosaur game. In addition to the three level adventure mode where you blast enemy dinos and save eggs, there are also six two-player levels including racing, capture-the-flag, and battle.
