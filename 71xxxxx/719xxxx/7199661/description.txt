"Virtual Systems Analysis"

When the biology final exam is postponed, 
Jeff encourages everyone to join him for 
a three hour lunch, but Annie convinces 
Abed to let her spend some time with him 
in the dreamatorium instead. What starts 
as an innocent simulation of "Inspector 
Spacetime" becomes a more serious 
examination of the study group members 
and Annie learns a little bit about what 
makes Abed tick.

Evolve...or die.
