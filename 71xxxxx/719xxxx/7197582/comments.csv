Even if you use VLC, you might be better off downloading the EZTV repack, which has better video quality and opens in every program I tried:

,Swegin8r,2012-04-20T08:04Z,@Tinny_pb: Do any of the programs you used provide a log? If so that could help in finding the reason for the failed import.
,Tinny_pb,2012-04-20T09:58Z,"BigLtcs: Staxrip said ""Indexing error: Can't open"". AutoGK and ConvertXtoDVD (yeah, I even tried that) said ""unknown file format"". DivX Plus Converter failed with no error message or log.

Then I wised up and used VLC to successfully convert the file. (Duh.) The result plays fine on a WDTV Live.

Thanks for your response, and sorry for badmouthing your torrent. :)  A9 V7."

If anyone else experiences a problem please let me know so that I can determine if it is an issue on my end and try to correct it. Thanks everybody!"
