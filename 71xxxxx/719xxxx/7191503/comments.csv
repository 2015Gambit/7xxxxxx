Please stay connected after your download is finished to help seed this show for people still downloading it and enjoy the show!!! :D"
,ACSportsFreak,2012-04-17T07:57Z,"Excellent Job! I have to say, you are quickly becoming my ""go-to guy"" for 720p wrestling releases! I have now downloaded all 5 of your new releases, and I continue to be very impressed! 

From one wrestling fan to another: Much appreciated, and, keep up the great work!!"
,xeatsa,2012-04-17T11:00Z,"thanks!

but still I'm not connected to any seed - just downloading from other leechers. So speed goes up and down."
,LordJCS,2012-04-18T19:58Z,"WTF mate?! 

Audio but no video? what's up with that?!"
,Akatsuki15,2012-04-23T13:28Z,Yeah.. audio but not video. And even if you manage to get images (with bs for example) its 5-10 seconds lag. This is the first time when I have issues with a 720p from those who are making monday night raw and same thing happened last time. This stuff its not working like its supposed to. Don`t download this !
[V],Petey85,2012-04-23T19:25Z,"enough bullcrap!!

There's was NOTHING wrong!!!!

SCSA420, keep up the good job!! :)"
