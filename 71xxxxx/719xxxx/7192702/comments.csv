,lukewhatisee,2012-04-18T05:08Z,"Last working version is 8.1.73.  Newer versions refuse to enable DVD copy.  Had a previous subscription, and will not allow CHATTCHITTO name as registered to.  Using my sunscribed name.  Tried REVO to remove old copies and registry cleaner, but still will not register to CHATTCHITTO..previous versions prior to 8.1.75 work. Have windows 7 64, but program loaded in Program files (x86) What happened in new versions?  How to fix?"

Had a previos subscription two years ago, and all versions >8.1.73 continue to register to my old expired subscription name.  Tried using REVO advanced to uninstall and clean registry...but still wont allow crack. Using Win 7 (64), but install path is programs (x86) What happened in newer versions?  How can it be fixed?"

,Bean-Bandit,2012-05-13T17:36Z,"Worked like a charm, just like all the rest that have come from ChattChitto.

One question, I noticed now the cracked is the exe file and not the dll I think it was. Did you have to change how it was cracked?"
,Gustavo_ES,2012-05-17T18:38Z,"Agradecimentos ao ChattChitto RG pela disponibilização do programa. 

Thanks to ChattChitto RG the availability of the program.

After you download, please help seeding. Thank you."
,cpres,2012-05-19T20:56Z,"ChattChitto thanks for the awesome software.  I did see that someone made a comment that a Trojan was found in the software, but it was later removed.  
This is the first time this has happened, and I was wondering if that an be fixed.
FYI a scan of the file itself does not reveal any viruses, its only during the installation."
,meehi,2012-05-22T08:53Z,Installed and cracked but when opening dvdfab nothing opens :( Win7 64bit
,stamp2k1,2012-05-24T02:34Z,I have Windows 7x64 and this version stops at 36% when converting. I reverted back to v8.1.3.8 and everything converts fine. Any ideas? It happens on my comp and another one too.
,duckyducke,2012-05-25T08:44Z,"@plupp65: the song is by Loreena McKennitt, a famous irish singer ;) Check out ""The book of secrets"" album. Best ever for dreaming."

@meehi

I ended all the DVDFab processes in task manager and tried again and it seemed to work. Try that :)
