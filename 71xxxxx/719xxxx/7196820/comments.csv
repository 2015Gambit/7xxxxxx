,bismarket,2012-04-19T07:00Z,"WTF Not again, around the 10min mark, it goes WAY out of sync, this is happening a lot with IMMERSE. Needs to maybe do less but do better?"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-04-19T13:13Z,May you should check the quality before u post it.
[V],spastik64,2012-04-19T14:22Z,"IMMERSE is one of the best TV Rips group. Be gratefully of that so if there is a nuked, download proper. No more."
,Kilamite,2012-04-20T21:22Z,"I appreciate the teams who record, encode and upload TV torrents.

But the audio goes way out of sync halfway through (just after where the ad break has been edited out). I know this is free, and we should be grateful, but come on, check your torrents before uploading!"
