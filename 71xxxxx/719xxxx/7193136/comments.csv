,dimekoza,2012-04-18T19:08Z,"aspect ratio anyone? is it in 16:9? I don't know why nobody rips the movies in 16:9 but i this stupid  21:9 that has the stupid black lines , does anyone have a 21:9 tv?"
,AppleTV1080p,2012-04-19T03:45Z,Pretty sure dimekoza is a retard. Everyone laugh at him
,GarbageGuyUK,2012-04-20T10:43Z,1080 is the aspect ratio ?
,AppleTV1080p,2012-04-21T02:37Z,WTF!? We have 2 retards making comments :S
,dimekoza,2012-04-25T13:40Z,"At AppleTV1080p dude you are the retard. a resolution of 1920x800 gives an aspect ratio of 21:9 which on a 16:9 TV set shows two black lines on top and bottom, in order for the video to be in 16:9 i has to be in 1920x1080 resolution or at least 1280x720. Most of the people posting videos are too lazy to check the settings on their rip application to set the resolution and hence the aspect ratio. 

Retard!"
[T],tr108,2012-04-26T01:27Z,LOL! A dude with NO torrents to his username is calling uploaders lazy and uninformed. You gotta love the internet...
,AppleTV1080p,2012-04-30T06:06Z,"Dimekoza, I didn't say you were a retard because you said something about 21:9 aspect ratio (you probably googled it lol).   The reason I called you a retard, which you have further proven to us with your comment about tr108, is you downloaded a perfect torrent, watched the torrent and then took the time to write a stupid ass comment on here"
