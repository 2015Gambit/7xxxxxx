,integernull,2012-04-20T01:17Z,so are they releasing best of compilations now since they only release a new episode every other week?
,Jamdude1,2012-04-20T01:49Z,I think this best of video has been made to mark the end of a season and to start the interval before the new one is released which will probably be in a few weeks.
