Papa San was raised by his Rastafarian grandmother and turned to Christianity in 1997. This is also reflected in his style, as he started off as a true dancehall deejay, later adopting traits of Gospel and Christian music.

He is the brother of Dirtsman, who was murdered in 1993. He has six children and lives in Weston, Florida with five of them and his wife, Debbie Thompson.

Papa San sponsors a concert known as Papa San and friends, to raise funds for orphanages in rural Jamaica. Since becoming a Christian over ten years ago, he has continued to produce his roots reggae sound, but with the message of Christ to the beat instead of his previously popular secular music.

In 2011, Papa San and his wife, having been ordained ministers of the Gospel, were launched into pastoral ministry and started "Our Fathers Kingdom International Ministries." O.F.K. is dedicated to the expansion of the Kingdom of God.
