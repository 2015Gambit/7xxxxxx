"The Don't in the Do"

When a corpse is found at a landfill, 
dyed in a blue substance, intern 
Arastoo Vaziri discovers a method 
that helps eliminate postmortem 
damages to the corpse, which leads 
the team back to a hair salon where 
the victim worked. Meanwhile Bones 
is feeling uncomfortable in her post-
baby body, so Booth decides to do 
something special to boost her self-
confidence
