,BAPEsta,2012-05-02T20:27Z,"Srry for previous post, didn't read all the comments correctly. Any date for the release for the CS6 keys?"
[V],thethingy,2012-05-03T03:50Z,"BAPEsta, its not the keys its getting the key validated as the keys need validating after 7 days or the app stops, if you used a key now then it would be pointless because you would still need the dll, kind of got the 7 day check disabled though and so is another dude so itll happen before cs6 is properly out"
,rian85,2012-05-05T05:30Z,"@ soahs thanks bro, i appreciate all the help...but i came across a few mistakes on my part..btw great file thethingy, ur the best...but my problem is im sure my system is a 64bit..cuz when i go to ""my computer"" then click on the ""system properties tab"" above, and it says my system is a 64 bit operating system...yet i got the ""program files (86x)"" which is where adobe cs6 is at...i put in the 64bit dll file in both the adobe bridge, and photoshop, and just now used the adobe tool to patch...is there any specific directions to use this? or is it the basic ""check host"" then patch afterwards? im still getting the trial version, says i got 25 days left...plz help...anyone with help if they dont want to post it on here can write me an email at evil.banana.3 at gmail ....but would love to keep this instead of the trial, thank you"

,Ginjasnapz,2012-08-16T04:31Z,Why was I directed from your instructions in the Photoshop CS6 torrent to this torrent when it clearly does not have serials for CS6?  What am I supposed to do now without a serial for the torrent?
,headbanging_bitch,2012-08-17T01:11Z,"@Ginjasnapz 
maybe you should read the text file labelled funnily enough ""INSTALLING INSTRUCTIONS"" contained in the folder, you were not directed to go anywhere, the download adobe tool link is part of METHOD TWO ( did you try method one? ), which is left over from cs5.5, thethingy was kind enough to change the folder names for you, but if you had taken the time it took you to whine here and visited the link at the top of the page maybe you would not have needed to whine about your inability to read simple instructions, or is it you cannot be bothered and expect everyone to run around wiping your arse for you, manners like everything on the pirate bay are free."
,Sieniej,2012-08-21T06:40Z,"When will you add a serial for CS6 extended? 
In your CS6 torrent you say to download this but there is no serial for it."
,redfire187,2012-08-23T11:06Z,"To make things short, thank you very much. Sorry for the long post . . .

This may sound a bit stupid on my part, but due to various reasons my computer became corrupted with some nasty viruses and I decided to disconnect my internet cord and obliterate my hard drives (Very stupid of me). After calming down I reinstalled a number of programs from a backup including CS5. Somewhere along the lines the file either became corrupt or I failed to properly install it. After a few months I was asked to use the program to which I had to refuse. Around that time I found thethingy and CS6. After downloading it I learned of the tool. Although I didn't realize the tool wasn't tweaked for CS6 yet It somehow resurrected my old CS5. It was like magic! I really must thank you. I hope it wasn't too much trouble."
,Ickbale,2012-09-11T13:23Z,Does this work for CS6? 
,Naveek,2012-09-24T01:58Z,When will 2.2 come out?
