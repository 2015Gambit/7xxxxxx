,smiletop,2012-04-18T17:05Z,Thanks for the upload. I wouldn't mind someone posting an avi though
,gps1976,2012-04-18T18:22Z,"Not sure why anybody would prefer the x264 - hardly any external media players play it, and I prefer not to watch all my tv shows on my laptop. Xvid/ DivX .avi's should really remain an option - thanks anyway"
,NippaDeeDooDah,2012-04-25T10:40Z,MP4s - much appreciated.!

My player doesn't play .mp4s. So there. Fine, you want your .mp4s for your iphone or whatever, I have an older player which wont play them full stop.

What's your massive problem with both formats remaining available and in use?"
