I really loved MIP, it was the best femdom site ever. Its a shame Kink closed it and started Divine Bitches instead. :/"
,crystal_fan_01,2012-04-19T05:02Z,Many many thanks!
,wingz15,2012-04-19T11:10Z,more penny flame thanks!!!
,MrHM,2012-04-19T19:17Z,merzedes & shallow2 you people rock!!! You are the one stop shop for BDSM. (More Penny Flame please)
,shallow02,2012-04-22T01:54Z,"Agree, Penny Flame was/is awesome! And most of her shoots have been upped when they were released. We mostly just upload the higher res MP4 re-releases when they surface.."
,wingz15,2012-04-29T23:04Z,any chance of reseeding / uploading more old penny flame? thanks for ur hard work
,Mdawg13,2012-06-19T14:05Z,"Man I havent heard one person who prefers DivineBitches to MIP. Great decision KINK.
For anyone who wants all the old MIP or Captive Male shoots all you have to do is get a 1 month subscription & you can download their entire fucking library. For $30 thats not a bad deal, hell I think CM is only like $20. I know downloading rocks but lets not be greedy, these sites will go out of business if we dont start coughing up some money here & there."
