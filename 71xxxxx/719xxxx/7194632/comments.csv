I try everything.
I uninstalled previous version of game, and remove all. Install with instruction and try other thing. But not working.

Always same error. Saying its wrong cd-key"
,Buxaroo,2012-04-18T20:43Z,"BTW, for those who are having issues installing this because of the instructions aren't very clear, I did a re-wording of the instructions for to make it a lot clearer:

1. Mount sr-dswld.mds and install using serial number 4899-7585-8107-3086

2. Run the DistantWorlds-ReturnoftheShakturi-SetupRelease-PL-v15.exe and when you get to the point where you have to input the serial number, run at the SAME time DWSetupCrack.exe and click the ""Crack Setup"" button. When it says complete, THEN you put in the serial number 4899-7585-8107-3085 and click next until it's installed.

3. Run the DistantWorldsLegends-SetupRelease-v1700.exe and when you get to the point where you have to input the serial number, run at the SAME time DWSetupCrack.exe and click the ""Crack Setup"" button. When it says complete, THEN you put in the serial number 4899-7585-8107-3084 and click next until it's installed.

4. Run the final patch DistantWorlds-Legends-Update-v17013-Beta.exe and when you get to the point where you have to input the serial number, run at the SAME time DWSetupCrack.exe and click the ""Crack Setup"" button. When it says complete, THEN you put in the serial number 899-7585-8107-3083 and click next until it's installed.

5. Run the game and ENJOY!

Remember, when installing the patches/expansion, just let the DWSetupCrack.exe from the DWSetupCrack.exe folder run until you get to the serial number part of each patch/expansion, then hit the crack button and then input the respective serial number and finish the patch/expansion installation. All the crack does it make it where you can input the correct serial number and install each patch. I had to figure this out on my own because the actual instructions aren't very clear and this is the first time in 10 years of pirating games that I have had to do something like this at the same time as installing the game. Not bitching about the process mind you, just that the instructions aren't worded to explain it more clearly."
,Buxaroo,2012-04-18T20:44Z,"Also, even with installing it correctly, it still gives a ""Error Code: 300"" when it checks to see if it's registered, even with it blocked in the firewall. "
,RezMar,2012-04-18T20:50Z,"I did the same thing and its not working... :(
I even installed in different stile and same thing.
Idk what to do :("
,RezMar,2012-04-18T21:14Z,"Ok i finally get it to work :)

I do this>>>>
1. run sr-dswld (image file) - Installed Distant Worlds with this serial number: 4899-7585-8107-3086
2.When u install core game you then stat DistantWorlds-ReturnoftheShakturi-SetupRelease-PL-v15 and Install the expansion with the same cd key: 4899-7585-8107-3086 *again use the same key
**Do not run DWSetupCrack
3. When u finish installing first exp. now u install second DistantWorldsLegends-SetupRelease-v1700
and now start at the same time DWSetupCrack (start when you got to serial section), and use this cd key: 4899-7585-8107-3085
4. Now you need to update the game with DistantWorlds-Legends-Update-v17013-Beta, and stat at the same time DWSetupCrack (start when you got to serial section), and use this cd key: 4899-7585-8107-3085 *again use the same key
5. Now the game will work perfectly :)

PS: Update DirectX and dotnetfx35 there are in game folder /redist"

,neem5693,2012-04-24T23:51Z,"Thx. It is workd.
Thx, again"
,onixbg,2012-06-09T12:30Z,I remember playing this game 1-2 years ago and few days ago I decided to go and play some space strategy games. I was looking over internet for 3 days until i find the exact game i played back then until i find it on one forum. The download speed was 500 KB/s quite fast and the game is working perfectly. Thank you all for the seeding and for the uploading/cracking this wonderful game.
,Dejakritz2,2012-06-12T07:35Z,"Anyone have 1.0.7.15? I found 1.0.7.14 a while back, wish i remembered the link. Some important fixes in these two patches."
,MarQan,2012-06-15T19:47Z,"Thanks RezMar!
Worked for me."
,lobo7922,2012-06-26T19:38Z,"The serial number for DistantWorldsLegends-SetupRelease-v1700.exe doesn't works for me. I have tried all the serial numbers and none works.
Any Idea what can I do?"
,Camaris85,2012-07-15T02:59Z,"@lobo7922 follow the intructions left by RezMar and u will be ok. Remember to activate te serial crack BEFORE introducing the serial.
Woks fine. Awesome game! "

,thefowle,2012-09-01T00:21Z,"Followed instructions closely: game installs ok with application of DWSetupCrack.exe, but when it comes time to run the game there's an ""error with your serial number"" ... ""error code: 300.""

Would love to try this game out. :/"
