Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore
one should not give up the work born of his nature, even if such work is full of fault.
ΓÇöThe Bhagvad-Gita (18.48)
My wireless (mobile) garden is full of flowers with varieties of flavors, for example,
CDMA, OFDM, and so forth.
Last year I realized my ΓÇ£OFDM flowerΓÇ¥ has become a ΓÇ£paragonΓÇ¥ with the successful
completion of the work of of several masters, doctoral, and postdoctoral
candidates, for example Mohindar Jankiraman, Dusan Matic, Klaus Witrisal, Uma
Jha, Richard van Nee, Shinsuke Hara, Hiroshi Harada, and so on. Therefore, I
decided to put together in one place their interesting and valuable contributions,
particularly of those of Klaus, Jankiraman, Uma, and Richard.
Although I coauthored OFDM for Wireless Multimedia Communications with
Richard and Multicarrier Techniques for 4G Mobile Communications with Shinsuke,
this book is very different in that it presents an overview of the wireless local
area network (WLAN), wireless personal area network (WPAN), frequencydomain
channel model, a novel hybrid OFDM concept, and a practical OFDM
system.
Figure P.1 illustrates the coverage of this book. This book illustrates the role of
OFDM in developing an adaptive system by designing OFDM-based wireless wide
area networks (WWANs), WLANs, and WPANs. It is based on the contributions of
several researchers who had or have been actively involved in growing the OFDM
flower in the wireless (mobile) garden under my gardenership.
As a gardener, I have tried my best to provide enough water and energy to nurture
the OFDM flower up until this point. In the future, it will sow several other
interesting colors, which I will bring to you at that time.
