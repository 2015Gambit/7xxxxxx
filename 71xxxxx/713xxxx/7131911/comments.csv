,gosensgo,2012-03-26T04:48Z,Could anyone report as to whether this was ripped with the 'soap opera effect' on?
,Xclibr57,2012-03-26T06:37Z,"@gosensgo - Soap Opera Effect?
Anyone know of a version of this at 50fps?"
,nobodynever,2012-03-26T07:03Z,You pretty much need 720 with F1.  Thanks for doing this.  I know its probably a bitch to cut the comercs.  Thanks again from Canada.
,novsan,2012-03-26T10:31Z,Thank you
,Bali2011,2012-03-26T11:25Z,Thanks!

,jir63,2012-03-26T20:38Z,"U all should be ashamed of yourselves!
Torrents would surely die if you guys example were to be followed.

10-20kbs with 120 seeders!! How is that even possible?!? 
Any Private tracker would push my fiber-optics to the max with that amout of people that shared.

This was my last time on a public-tracker. (But of course I will seed 3:1 as always)"
,madboy21,2012-03-26T22:38Z,"why dont more people seed? I will.  And by the way, thanks plus keep up the good work."
,synchronicityii,2012-03-27T06:46Z,"These are great, thank you so much!"
,magicarp,2012-03-27T08:18Z,Amazing.  The download was worth the wait. Please please keep this up for the season.
,giffo5,2012-03-27T23:45Z,"Wow....thanks so much for the hard work ! 
Keep up the great work ! 
I would be prepared to Pay for this shit ! 

lol

Thanks ! "
,ht0fff,2012-03-28T03:43Z,"awesome work. thank you very much!

one suggestion though: could you split it in 3 parts and name them e.g. buildup, race, after-race"
,gosensgo,2012-03-28T06:19Z,"Thanks footy!! No soap opera effect, I think that's what 50fps does to the video. Keep going with 25fps!! Thank you"
,bihsethy,2012-03-29T10:07Z,"Intro is not in ac3 audio. Could you please just provide ac3 audio for Intro (with exactly the same parameters as race p1 and p2) part of this torrent. I would be very grateful. Trying to merge all parts, but can't, because I can't find a good transcoder with a 6 channels audio option. "
,cvonc,2012-06-04T11:13Z,pretty sure this is the hannibal cap from thebox
