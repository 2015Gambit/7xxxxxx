,muffbuffer69er,2012-03-28T02:58Z,"Euro Truck Simulator is verified to be compatible with Apple computers using the following (and of course newer) graphics chipsets: NVidia GeForce 8 generation, ATI/AMD Radeon 2xxx class or higher, Intel GMA X3100, and Intel HD. In practice, this includes any and all Mac Book, Mac Book Pro, Mac Book Air, Mac Mini and iMac computers purchased since late 2008. Some ranges, like iMac, or Mac Book Pro were equipped with sufficient graphics chipsets since 2007.

On older chipsets including Intel GMA 950, GeForce 7 series and ATI 1xxx class, the game runs too slow, and we don't recommend using it unless you are really a die-hard fan of the game.

Please note that the OS X version of the game currently doesn't support steering wheels, gamepads or joysticks, we are working on the support and it will appear in the next major update, hopefully in a matter of several weeks."
