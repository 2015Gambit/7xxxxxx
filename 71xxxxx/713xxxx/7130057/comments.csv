,hoffy97,2012-03-31T04:55Z,"A few issues:  there are no subtitles at all, so there's nothing during the Dothraki parts.

Also, I had the audio cut out in the last 3 minutes of Episdoe 7.  Haven't gone through the other eps yet."

thanx honchorella31 your one of my entertainment provider"
,hoffy97,2012-04-03T13:53Z,"Only reason I mention the subs is that ""Dothraki"" is a fake language made for the show; this isn't the case of looking for Russian or Spanish.  I thought they were hardcoded from the studio, but I guess on the DVD they are separate to allow for other language.  Not sure the sub scene would be picking those up.

As far as Ep 7, I had tried VLC, MPlayer, and Perian (Quicktime), all of which choked, so figured it was the file.  It's only the last 3 min or so.  If I figure out the subs, maybe I'll pull these again.

Beyond that, the quality is excellent.  Long time fan of Honcho's releases."

I can't find english subs for it yet that have ONLY those parts, without having english subs for the entire episode.  That was how it aired, for what it's worth.

,dude8888,2012-04-03T16:29Z,"UPDATE:
I now have watched all 10 episodes & the quality is excellent on all of them

Yes, there are no Dothraki subs :( 
(I was able to find them or extract them from other subs that were easy to find)

Thanks to honchorella31!!!"
