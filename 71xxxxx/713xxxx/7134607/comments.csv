No good source. I can try but... I've seen something close to ... Even a rip ..but...  I'll see what the chances are."
,abhikrit,2012-03-27T22:18Z,thanks :) if i come across any good source i will let you know. just watched the BABEL rip of yours today. 
,abhikrit,2012-03-28T22:25Z,"hey cody, there's a source of 21 grams you might be knowing.. as follows: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5898134/21.Grams.2003.720p.BluRay.x264-CHD


but there's a rip, but the bitrate (video) is less i guess, can you tell me whether its a good rip, if it is, then dont do 21 grams..here is it: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5842860/21_Grams_2003_BDrip_h264_720p_AAC_eng-swesub_jbr


And i do have a request, its like a die hard request. We dont have a SINGLE rip of REC and REC 2 movies. not a single 720p rip of those. Please dude, will you do it please! you are one of the best encoder. Just downloaded your BRAVEHEART today.. currently seeding, was perfect as usual. 

the source for rec and rec 2 (if you need):

Thanks a lot! "
,abhikrit,2012-03-28T22:38Z,"i was an encoder myself and i am such a huge fan of your work that i decided to promote you :) SEARCH FOR THE FOLLOWING IN FB (facebook)(TPB wont let me post the FB link here) CodyReleasescodyboss1969


If you could share it in your descriptions as well, it would be perfect. Just trying to help you man, hope you like it. Will update that page soon, by tomorrow..only if you support it. "

Thanks. I don't know how good is this ideea , but I'll consider it. Maybe it'll be a solution to go with FB link in the description [sort of..]"
,abhikrit,2012-03-29T20:17Z,"^^ of course, did it for the same reason. will be updating it gradually, thanks for supporting. and are you considering the REC movies to upload? "
,blackwolf1023,2012-04-03T19:47Z,"hey codyboss1969 i can't get the sound to work and was hoping you would have a solution for me 
ty in advance"

On a Windows PC you must have installed the AC3 decoder [it comes with a good codec pack like K-Lite Codec Pack] or...use VLC media player that uses his own [integrated] codec pack..so it's independent of the system codecs!

Cheers"
