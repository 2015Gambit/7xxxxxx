1- open .dmg file
2- drag LOTRO (lord of the rings online) into your applications
3- run lotro 
Note: you are now able to log in but it will not work, the client will be out of date
4- in the window that asks for your password and username go to Tools>Patch>Start. This can take up to 30 minutes on older machines
5- after it finishes you can close and run lotro (you mat need to exit and reopen the application after patching)
