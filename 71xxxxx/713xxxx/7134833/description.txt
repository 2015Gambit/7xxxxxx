The Cleveland 20's & 30's Meetup Group Greatest Hits II: Do Something Crazy! is a custom music compilation release from Tootie. It is Tootie's official sequel to his preceding Cleveland 20's & 30's Meetup Greatest Hits (...or not) compilation release. The compilation mostly features songs well-known to the Cleveland 20's & 30's Meetup Group, songs heard during meetups of the group that occurred before production started, as well as the theme for the then-upcoming Adult Prom Night.

The compilation is completely sourced from lossless material. All of the compilations' songs utilize playback gain values from Tootie's personal volume-leveling procedure, resulting in a consistent overall listening experience without the need to adjust the volume between songs.

Notes:
The audio quality gain from mixing to 24-bits over 16-bits is fairly marginal. However, it restores some of the definition lost from mixing to 16-bits, especially on tracks that were mastered very loud.
The use of the tracks in the compilation independently is not recommended as most tracks are intermixed in some way. Many are shortened.
