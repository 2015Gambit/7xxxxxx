[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-27T10:07Z,"Azavala415 man I don't know I use Vuze.  Never used Utorrent, so I wouldn't even begin to know how to help you with that.  Sorry :(

Hopefully someone can post something to help you out."

,Korriban,2012-03-28T19:36Z,with a name like Sackilla you would think you would have the new X-Raided - Sacramentally Disturbed! please get it?
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-28T20:06Z,@korriban man it's been so long sice I picked up an X-Raided cd.  Until I can recover my full collection the only one I know I have is Xorcist.  My HD crashed on me & I lost 25+ yrs of music.  Trying to get it all back from my peeps.  I'll check into that new one for you tho.
,Korriban,2012-03-29T19:52Z,@ SacKilla666 - thanks ! a do you have any C-Bo ?
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-29T21:41Z,"I pretty much have all the C-bo's, but there's a torrent on here that has most the albums as well.  I'll try & upload them today.  

On a side note I just found out my homie just mailed me back my collection, so in a few I should hopefully have a few more X-raided as well"
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-30T00:06Z,@Korriban I just put up 11 C-bo albums homie.  Anything out later than that I haven't picked up.  Been strugglin for a while so I haven't picked up to much new music in about 4 yrs.

,TaiTheGuy,2012-05-14T01:03Z,"Lemme just toss in one more 916 reference.

Holdin it down for Sacramento & northern Cali.

Sorry Earl. If I was mobile, with some free time, & more than 80 measly dollars to my name, I'd shoot up to Dimple & buy your shit...
But I pay for the shows though, so it all works out."
