After Venus disbanded in 2007, it didn't took one year for Marc Huyghens to start a new band, called Joy. This is their first, eponymously titled 2010 long play album. Not surprisingly, the sound is pretty much where it would evolve after Venus' Red Room. The album contains a Venus cover - Vertigone - as well!

The group features Françoise Vidick on drums and vocals, Marc A. Huyghens on guitar and vocals and Céline Chappuis on cello.
