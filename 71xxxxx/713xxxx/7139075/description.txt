                           DESCRiPTiON 

 TV and radio presenter Reggie Yates explores the dangerous world of teenage 
 gangs, and considers whether young people can be adversely affected by their 
 environment and as a consequence turn to crime. He meets two 22-year-olds who 
 found peer pressure and the temptation of easy money hard to resist, but are 
 now trying to turn their lives around. He also visits a rehabilitation scheme 
 in St Helens, Merseyside, where he talks to a former member of Manchester's  
 ruthless Gooch Gang. Part of the Criminal Britain season
