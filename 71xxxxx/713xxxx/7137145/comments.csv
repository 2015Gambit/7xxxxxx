[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-27T22:22Z,"@ teeroy35 it's on the Figgaro presents Fillmoe 2 Hunters Point Vol. 1.  I'll be getting around to posting it.  Instead of randomly putting these up, I'm going in alphabetical order.  Probably going to be putting another 25 torrents up in the C's to D's.  Once I get to the F's it'll be up here.  Just give me a little time & I'll get all my bay slams on here.  The world needs to get hip on the old school YAY AREA shit."
