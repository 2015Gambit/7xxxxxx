[T],immagical,2012-03-26T01:30Z,"Cheers man..      your comment must have had a delay, as i'm sure it wasnt here before i put them screenshots up...:)  

 at least i know i can put samples in now to.    Because before, i just deleting any samples i made using the record on vlc media player as i couldnt work out how to get 2 files at once..:P      It wasnt until you said about 'make sure they in same folder'  that i noticed the 2 option for saving new torrents to..    ""ive been awake 2long"" lol  

I'm gonna put a 690mbs ""machine gun preacher dvdrip up next..   then am gonna shut me eyes for a while, im struggling here with one eye at a time.. :)
