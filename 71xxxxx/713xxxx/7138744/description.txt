Top Gear Super Cars Across Italy 2012 BRRiP XViD AC3-MAJESTiC

PLOT:
Closer to home, the presenters set off on a glorious road trip across Italy in 
three incredible supercars - the Lamborghini Aventador, the Noble M600 and the 
McLaren MP4-12C. Their adventure starts with an eye widening max speed run at 
the vast Nardo proving ground which tests not only performance but also sheer 
bravery. After that the boys head towards Rome, encountering relaxed policemen 
and work-shy mechanics along the way, before continuing north for a date with 
one of the toughest and most dangerous challenges they've ever faced, hot laps 
of the uncompromising Imola Grand Prix track. Great cars, wonderful scenery, 
hilarious banter and the Stig's Italian cousin, this is Top Gear at its very best.
