... WHY!?? I don't know. It could have warned me. Anyway google for 'Kaise123's Minecraft Torrent - Always up-to-date Info' to find it."
,GreenGERMBUBBLE,2012-03-29T08:08Z,"Hey Kaise123 can you make a cracked Technic SSP 6 or tell me how to do it, which both would be awesome :p. Thanks!"
,kaise123,2012-03-29T10:25Z,"I am planning on doing a cracked Technic pack when an up-to-date version is release (For 1.2.4 at this stage). I don't think there is one out yet and i don't want to spend time making an outdated version because I have to pay to buy phone credit to be able to upload (I have dial-Up)

Thanks for understanding :P"

,jonnx,2012-04-03T01:38Z,dude that shit keeps logging me out and idk how to use commands
,jonnx,2012-04-03T02:02Z,dude i cant use commands and it always tell me to log in
,kaise123,2012-04-04T14:01Z,"@9V9; Thanks :)

@elc2k; Haven't tested, but it should.

@TbombPirate; This Does have modloader already. or do you mean the new API in 1.2.5?

@1997rub; This is 64 & 32 bit already.

@jonnx; If you can't help yourself i'm not going to help you. This is a stupid question, it tells you what to do when you log in and as for not playing on servers, the server has to be cracked. If you need more help registering (Other than the blatantly obvious advice it gives you when you join) go to how to register tk"

,kaise123,2012-05-10T01:49Z,Without the weird characters. Just type it normally.
,mikestell,2012-05-10T04:26Z,mods won't work for me ever since i updated it. why is that
,kaise123,2012-06-01T15:20Z,"Don't update it for 1.2.5, 1.2.4 still works on 1.2.5 servers and vice versa. I'll be updating it for 1.3 when it comes out though."
,tcg7938,2012-08-11T04:32Z,"Kaise, have you got 1.3.1 released yet?"
,kaise123,2012-09-02T06:22Z,"Yeah, but it isn't on TPB. I'm currently working on a 1.3.2 torrent that will be released shortly"
