Narratives:

Amazon Customer Review: I Don't remember ever hearing of this duo until I did a freestyle search and discovered this great CD. This is really a solid dance CD with only one ballad which is the title of the CD. The first two tracks are exceptionally hard hitting dance tunes with thumping bass. The third and fourth tracks ANYTHING FOR YOU and DON'T SAY GOODBYE are just plain great with that classic freestyle sound. Track 5 SHOW ME THE WAY is a somewhat slower freestyle tune similar to the TKA groove of the early 1990's. LOVING YOU and CELEBRATE are nice dance tracks backed with that familar euro dance beat and the vocals of NAYA. The CD closes with WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT a piano ballad and a remix of LOVING YOU. Overall this is a solid CD for freestyle/dance fans. Also these guys have a single remix of CULTURE CLUB'S "Do You Really Want To Hurt Me" which is also pretty good.
