A Good Thief Tips His Hat" was voted "Album of the Year" in Rhythm & News Readers Poll 2000 and picked as one of the "Best Albums of 1999" by Mixx Magazine. "Eerie yet jovial", this description best sums up their music- raggedy-ass hillbilly punk-floyd folk pop with primitive classical elements and spooky surreal overtones.
