corruption and jittering of picture!

I played this video with VLC 2.1 Mar beta and it plays
badly.. seems all the VLC beta play xvids worse
then the alpha builds.

I recommend the latest 2,0.1 alpha build as it plays
avi/xvids much better.

more so if you set

GPU on.. 

and real-time video sharpener and slide knob a little
to the right.. it will enhence the video heaps and
brighten the whites.. try and see what i mean
your never go back to no using this FEATURE

shame i cant find a similar filter plugin for
the video converters to do that the same
none compare"
