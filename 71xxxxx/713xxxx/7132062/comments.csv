,rjcripe,2012-03-29T04:55Z,"@Iceburgslim  Completely agree.  I hate the new trend of not uploading AVIs... my DVD player and Xbox can't play anything but AVIs and I fucking hate sitting in front of my computer to watch my shows.  But, Iceburgslim, heres a tip: any video that includes ""x264"" in the title will NOT be an AVI (they are always either .mkv or .mp4).  If you are in the same boat as I am, and it sounds like you are, that will help a ton whenever you are looking to download video torrents."
,joe6pac,2012-03-29T20:18Z,@iceburgslim get a fuc*ing life and buy a decent media player
,BreakingBadFan,2012-03-29T22:45Z,@rjcripe I would reccomend just streaming from your computer to your tv if possible. I plug hdmi into my computer and then to my tv and it never fails or you could simply download convertxtodvd or something similar and convert the file to avi if its that big of a deal. 
,BreakingBadFan,2012-03-29T22:48Z,or WinAvi All in one converter
,p3r0x1d3,2012-04-02T05:00Z,"ps3 plays the x264 encoded .mp4 files just fine, get rid of your shitbox 360 imo."
,vbeloded,2012-04-03T03:51Z,"Apple tv doesnt play anything but mp4, and this one is a great quality, keep up, good job!"
,GoLoboGo,2012-04-03T15:26Z,"rjcripe - 

Idon't know what you are talking about. My XBOX plays MP4's just fine. Also, to get your xbox to play mkv files, download and install the shark 007 codec package, as well as the 64 bit package. Set up Windows Media Center on your PC then set up your xbox as a WMC extender. Then WMC on xbox will use the codecs installed on your PC to play anything. There's plenty of guides out there, just google. 

Thanks uploader and seeders!"

,Kedict,2012-04-09T05:02Z,"converting media formant is hard, how exactly do i internets?"
,Laszlo_Panaflex,2012-04-17T00:56Z,"To all the fucking idiots who complain about downloading mp4's, mkv's, or anything other than avi; click on the the number beside ""File"", and it will tell you what the file type is. Quit yer fuckin whining, go look for your avi's.

Thanks eztv
