,madtagger,2012-03-26T18:55Z,"It says ""file corrupt or unsupported"" when trying to play it on my newly acquired Sony bdp S580.

It plays all mkvs except the ones with the 5.1 MKV profile (profile, not the 5.1 audio) was this done with the 5.1 profile instead of the 4.1?? 

I remember I could play the older releases of yours from young justice and the file names looked just like that. 

Are you using the mkvmerge 4.0 or newer?? You should release a fixed version. I love the Dolby Digital sound, the other 720p version is from the web and has no DD, only stereo :("
