,FS_Junkie,2012-03-26T15:40Z,So ... has anyone installed it yet? Any ideas as to what version?
,e157191,2012-03-26T20:17Z,"@FS_Junkie
It's the old one. The only problem is that I can ""feel"" the wind blowing over my feet when I fly this bird. (missing VC texture around foot pedal areas in FSX) So I was hoping if it would be the latest v1.11. Still thanks for the upload P51."
