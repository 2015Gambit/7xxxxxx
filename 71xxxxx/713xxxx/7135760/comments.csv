,scoobysnak,2012-03-28T23:42Z,Cool movie.  It's like watching the backstory to a vault you'd find in Fallout 3.  
,samhell44,2012-03-29T00:15Z,thanks but after 50min of movie i quit rape is not my genre of film
,XXSEED,2012-03-29T02:35Z,"~~UPLOAD & MOVIE RATING~~
Audio : 9.8 (It can't be any better compared to the size of the video)

Video : 9.8 (It can't be any better compared to the size of the video)

Movie : 8.7

SPOILER FREE COMMENT :

The Movie it self is really good. 
The only thing is that you won't get much of a story about what caused the nuclear explosion. 

Yet the movie has a great *dark* theme which will really impress you.

OVERALL : TOTALLY WORTH THE WATCHING.

Thanks for reading."
,chrisepsi33,2012-03-30T15:21Z,nice thanks
,gratefulforthis,2012-03-31T14:30Z,Have to agree with XXSEED. :)
,LtDrebin,2012-04-02T11:47Z,"Great story about the human inner nature!
Definitely worth watching!
Quality is very good, a-9, v-9.
Thanx uploader!"
,snabbnudlar,2012-04-06T16:16Z,"A:10
V:8
M:8

Actually a really good movie if you just give it some time in the beginning. Really messed up movie though so be warned."
,jeff1957,2012-04-09T12:36Z,"I thought the movie was alright really, though it took a bit of time to get going.  Some sceneâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s are quite disturbing and your not given any reason for the nuclear explosions.  But very good quality & sound.

Cheers Jeff"

,chernye,2012-04-11T15:03Z,is this the unrated version? thank you!
,Manderz,2012-04-13T14:53Z,"A-10 V-10

Perfect quality. Downloaded in about 6 minutes. It's broken into 2 segments because the movie is 2 hours long, but it's a small price to pay to get your hands on a prereleased movie."
,Manderz,2012-04-13T14:56Z,"And to the guy who compared it to Fallout3, it's funny that you say that because I've yet to actually watch it yet, but judging from the previews, that's the first thing that came to my head, was this was a backstory to one of the vaults or something in FO3. "
,ust2,2012-04-13T23:28Z,"A/V:9 but suspect that's just how it was made (very low budget)

M: Only skipped through it to check it out, definetly screams low budget B-movie and with people doing pretty much what you'd expect from this type of movie.

 I'd only DL it if you really have nothing else to watch at all."
,ViolentC,2012-04-15T14:17Z,"A/V 7/10
I Highly recomend this film. Very Dark, disturbing and full of twisted shit.
@ ust2 please don't ""skip through"" a movie and then tell people what you think of it. perhaps what you skipped past was a brilliant movie..."
,WobSawd,2012-04-16T15:34Z,"Really worth watching, it's a great movie, not some B movie. Great music, great movie on it's own and just really well made.

If you like apocalyptic movies or just random destruction look no further. I have no idea what everyone is moaning about though, really enjoyed it."
,achillesdave,2012-04-28T15:41Z,"Had my internet blocked by cox cable until I removed this file from my PC. I had already watched it. I must say, Sam is the biggest pussy/idiot in post apocalyptic history."
,klark.kent,2012-05-04T23:53Z,extremezone is cool men! :)
