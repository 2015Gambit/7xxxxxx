I searched for ""Serial Box"" - 2 words, because that's what it's called. The most recent result that came up was January. The other torrent didn't, probably because it's labelled wrong. Took me 2 minutes to find it on another site with Google and download it. I didn't try SerialBox, Seriel Box, Cereal Box, Serialz Box, or every other misspelling I could think of.

More than 100 people downloaded this in the first 3 hours I posted it, so it seems I'm not the only one who didn't find the other torrent. Complaining and criticizing is easy. Doing something useful requires more effort. ;)

P.S. Thanks to the other uploader for posting it too. Notice I didn't flame his torrent with a useless comment like ""Hey XXX, it's called Serial Box, r u stupid?"" Nobody's perfect. :)"
