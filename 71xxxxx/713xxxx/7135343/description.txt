Hunted The Demon"s Forge - Kaos

Requires 12,7 GB
It is repack because original kaos installer crashes every time for me.
I divided archive because of FAT32 users

1. Extract archive to folder where you want to have game
2. Run ~unpack~.bat (it takes about 12 min to install)
3. To play game run Binarieswin32haunted.exe

To download fast

If you are using mobile internet - forget to download fast - because of ping (yes it matters)
If you are using router first configure NAT/PAT - read uTorrent faq or forum and router manual
