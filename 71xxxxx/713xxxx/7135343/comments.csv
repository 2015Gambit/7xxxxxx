,RegginRellik,2012-03-27T18:46Z,hey dude is it possible to play coop?
,ryzy,2012-03-27T19:15Z,"@RegginRellik

I didn""t try. But in menu in adventure there it seems that there is possibility to play coop. Maybe get hamachi to create virtual lan"
,ryzy,2012-03-28T17:59Z,I'm working on other languages' subtitles for this. Probably tomorrow or on friday
,Cerebral222,2012-03-30T05:16Z,"I have a problem with this, when I try to install all I get is this:

any ideas as to why this would happen? everything is upto date on my rig, spent alot of time downloading this, would be a shame to see it was for nothing."
,ryzy,2012-03-30T10:24Z,"@Cerebral222 you just didn't read instruction correctly.
Extract .rar archive first then run unpack.bat (unpacked one of course). I guess you just opened archive and run unpack.bat."
,Cerebral222,2012-03-30T11:37Z,"I've been doing torrents for years, I'm no stranger to the unpack.bat process, I did extract the files into a folder, and all that happened was, it started to install, then it stopped, almost 4 gig went missing in an instant, that's all, that's why I'm trying to fish out some info, thanks for your reply though."
,ryzy,2012-03-30T12:33Z,"@Cerebral222 
I spent time for prepare my torrent's. I unpack,and play every game i upload here.

The error you got occur when files are missing. % ago i unpack, run install,bat and game works. Below  is an image and it should be like this:

Check this maybe you have some files missing"
,Cerebral222,2012-03-30T13:35Z,"Thanks for the info ryzy, turns out there were files missing; I use Comodo Internet Security, I used to use Norton 360, but comodo blocked files during the extraction process, but didn't let me know about it, after dropping Comodo, extraction worked perfectly, this is why I ask Q's first, thanks for the upload, a well earned +1 from me, Cheers."
,ryzy,2012-03-30T14:07Z,@Cerebral222 so you solve problem by your own. Glad to hear that. I wiil save this problem in case of future torrent's problem. Thanks.
,Swe_Jakke_Swe,2012-03-31T21:26Z,"Hi

I got the same error message as Cerebral but all 6 files seem to have been extracted properly. When I run unpack.bat (after extraction) this error message appears and the files data01, 02, 03 and Videos all disappear. 

If you have a solution for this please let me know!"
,ryzy,2012-03-31T23:36Z,Probably just like before it is antivirus fault. I promise that files are clean. If you are using vista/7 it can be also rights fault. So make sure you running unpack.bat as admin.
,Swe_Jakke_Swe,2012-04-01T03:07Z,"Yeah I also blamed the antivirus at first, so I disabled it but it didn't make any difference.

I ran the unpack.bat as an administrator (I'm using windows 7) without any success. Do you have any other suggestions? Is there anyone else who is using windows 7 who made this work?"
,Cerebral222,2012-04-01T07:21Z,"Just FYI, I've installed this twice on 2 different PCs, mapped the game to xpadder, been playing this for hours now, there's no bugs, I've scanned it with AVG 2012, came up clean. Output size is 12.7 gig, the game is one of the best I've played of this genre, so my thanks again to ryzy, best of luck Swe_Jakke_Swe."
,Cerebral222,2012-04-01T07:38Z,"@Swe_Jakke_Swe, sorry I forget to add that yes I'm using Windows 7 32bit.
NOTE: Dropping Comodo AV was pointless as it still monitors in the background, I completely uninstalled it, then installed the game, then afterwards put on AVG. My second rig is offline, with no AV at all, your AV might be stopping you from installing the game in the backgound."
,ryzy,2012-04-01T10:11Z,Advice - use Avast New version is pretty good and light antivirus - no problems for me
,Swe_Jakke_Swe,2012-04-01T18:10Z,"It appears that the antivirus was not the problem here. 
I had been trying to extract the files to a different map located in Program(x86), just to save space on my desktop. I'm now extracting the files to a folder located on my desktop and so far so good (AVG enabled), I'm looking forward to play this game (I hope coop works..). 

Thanks a lot for your support Cerebral and ryzy! Great upload!"
,SirReaper,2012-06-15T21:35Z,"Can i create a hamachi virtual lan, as you said, offline? Im going to try this and seed ^^"
