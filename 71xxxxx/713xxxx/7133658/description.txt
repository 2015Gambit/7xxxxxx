Details:

Without any doubt, this is a really good album but a bit overhyped already, in my humble opinion. There are a couple of top-notch and quite catchy tracks here like Destiny or So Will Be Now, but there are some quite average too. The main features of the release are masterly done soft sounding balearic rhythms and melodies in 80's style which create a laid-back, very musical and cosy atmospere which is so easy to perceive and enjoy. Overall, this is by no means one of the highlights of 2012.
