,samhhain,2012-03-25T16:04Z,Thanks for the spoiler you fucking asshole.  Nice way to take your fellow human beings into consideration.  I hope you have a miserable life because you've made the life of those around you miserable since you were born; you only deserve the best.
,magic5,2012-03-25T16:24Z,"Is there a way to get an RSS alert for a specific user. I've been clicking back to footy regularly for a while waiting for the race. :-)

Obviously thanks to vreza87's spoiler we all know why we have to wait a bit longer. I'd still rather not know :-("
,vreza87,2012-03-25T16:36Z,"sorry guys.

just out of curiousity, hv u ever been successful staying in the dark, *these days*? talking about the flood of information u have to avert ur eyes from.."
,Bali2011,2012-03-25T17:00Z,"Waiting patiently for the race.

@vreza87
Thanks for the spoiler, are you going to tell us who win the race as well? Many people here don't go online / social networking to avoid hearing the news."
,aasimp,2012-03-25T17:06Z,"Waiting for hours now, Please upload the Race, Desperately waiting..."
,miffroo,2012-03-25T17:10Z,"yes, i normally manage to stay in the dark. My dad is currently watching the highlights so I had to sing to myslef while making a coffee. 
Wasn't a horrible spoiler - apologies accepted here :-)

have only just looked at RSS feeds  in utorrent, I think the website has to set up the feed, and so only the categories in http://thepiratebay.se/rss are available.
I've added fooy's page as a feed, dont think it will work though"
