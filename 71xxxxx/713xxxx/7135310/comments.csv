,wadkcaj,2012-03-27T10:17Z,The .jar crack file doesn't work (OSX Lion) but the application still works in the freeware mode
[V],polisdavid,2012-03-27T18:30Z,"wadkcaj , I'm running X.7.3 and it worked just fine for me - remember to patch first! THEN enter username and click generate.

AND.  Thank you Seeders!!  Â´>)"
[V],polisdavid,2012-03-27T18:34Z,"Oh and wadkcaj , you must drag the generated license file to the invisible .TheBrain folder in ~Users/~/

I used FileBuddy to do it...."
,fiercygoat12,2012-03-28T04:22Z,polisdavid did you try to make PesronalBrain work on a PC? I tried to patch it but it says access denied.thanks
,fiercygoat12,2012-03-28T05:24Z,"Finally, i made it work on a pc! Here are the steps, which are pretty much the same with the steps you are provided with.
1. Download the latest edition from their website
2.Run pb.jar
3.Click the Patch button and look for thebrain folder in the program files then, you will see the brain.jar file.
4.. Enter whatever name you like and click Generate
5.Save the info7.bin license file it will create to the Desktop
6.Make sure the hidden files are visible by going to control panel/folder options/view. 
7.Block all internet access on the program by making a rule in your firewall that will deny access to thebrain.exe
8.Now, open program and shortly you will notice that still you are using the trial version.(important step)
9.close program and cut and paste the license file info7.bin into c:/ program data/thebrain

That's it, you are done."
,GSPT,2012-03-28T07:29Z,I didn't get a generated text file on my desktop.
[V],polisdavid,2012-03-29T07:53Z,"GSPT, reread the crack file - 1. press patch with no name ....THEN.... 2. press generate with a name

hope that helps - You can try it as many times as you want, you just have to install theBrain.dmg each time you try it for as fresh copy of the files.

,iszy3,2012-04-28T04:56Z,"hey polisdavid, I got lost at ""click Patch button..."" I have winzip and i unzipped pb.jar but then i see a file called patch.properties and i can't open it."
,iszy3,2012-04-28T05:32Z,"So if anyone has my problem... http://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html
this site gives this free sofware called jarfix and it allowed me atleast to run the pb.jar file. 

:D"
,babybruce,2012-05-02T23:35Z,"Hi, Thanks so much for this upload.

,vitaly1,2012-05-03T03:44Z,"Hi! 

When I downloaded The Brain 7 and installed it as per fiercygoat12's instructions on my PC, I already had the protrial version of Personal Brain 6 running on my computer. The protrial version expired today and as I expected, I don't have access to some of their features like adding attachments. However, The Brain 7 is working fine and I am happy with that. But I see that it is still a protrial version and it says that it will expire in a few days, too. What should I do? I can reinstall but I don't want to lose all the mindmaps that I have created using the software. "
,waj28,2012-05-03T14:39Z,thank you so much. However should i re-instate network connection after? Otherwise I followed the instruction and worked pretty well...
,waj28,2012-05-03T14:50Z,"hey polisdavid, can you try to crack iMindMap 5 ultimate for Mac OSX. I have been looking for this app but the only version they have are for Windows PC. They also use Java for their app but it seems so complex. I really need this app, I mean real bad. You seemed to be good with Java files too complex for me...I even tried using you app for personal brain but there are way too many. If you can, please reply on pirate bay forum on this thread that I have already set up: https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=120699. really hope you can help."
,1word,2012-06-16T10:11Z," Hello guys, does anyone know where I can get iMind Map 5 for Mac OSX (keygen) or application? I searched everywhere and nothing for MAC. Thanks"
,1word,2012-06-16T10:20Z, Any news on crack iMindMap 5 ultimate for Mac OSX
,tenche10,2012-08-13T21:31Z,Works on Windows! Thanks!
,dreghren,2012-08-28T21:27Z,"When I click on Patch, it gives the path name of the file as well as (Access is Denied) right beside it. Will that cause problems?

Also, I've used The Brain 7 before and the trial period has run out. Will I still be able to do this?

I'm using Windows 7. The .dmg file won't work for me right?

Replies greatly appreciated, thanks. =)"
,dreghren,2012-08-28T23:58Z,"It's alright, I've got it already. I basically changed the security settings of the brain.jar file to ""Full Control"" for Trusted Installers, then I proceeded with the patch. 

Worked like a charm, thank you so much. Just want you to know that you've helped an entire batch of university students. Our lecturer is very sadistic and gave us notes using TheBrain... which we know is unprintable in the free version. 

Thanks again!"
,klearvue,2012-09-06T05:58Z,Works on Linux too.
