TheBrain 7 (formerly known as PersonalBrain through version 6)

It starts with a single Thought and grows more powerful as you use it. Think of it as a living mind map with unlimited space for everything you want, are learning or need to remember. Each idea can grow and evolve with all related Thoughts instead of being separated in folders or lists. Use PersonalBrain to manage specific projects or as an "everything in your life manager" to get the big picture on your ideas and find the right information in seconds.

See and do more with digital thinking.

Where can you really go on your computer today to hash out a new idea, current event, or expand your plans in a meaningful way? PersonalBrain lets you digitize your mind so you can literally see your thinking and refine your ideas. Each of your Thoughts comes to life on-screen with connections to other related Thoughts, creating a context for thinking and action.Integrate all your information in one place.

Your Brain can store an unlimited amount of all kinds of information. Write notes for all your ideas. Save files, web pages, images and even emails into PersonalBrain for instant access. Adding things is as simple as drag and drop.Integrate all your information in one place.
