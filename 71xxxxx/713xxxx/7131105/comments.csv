[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-25T22:27Z,"I had plenty of time, but I wanted a source with the original AR [1,85:1] not 16:9. But ... Proper 1080p Amiable wasn't available !

So...the best available was:
 The Talented Mr Ripley (1999) 1080p Blu-ray DTS x264-CHD

For a proper QF [quality factor] [ Bits/(Pixel*Frame) = 0.113 ]  I had to go to 2,8Gib and this way minimum video bit rate was 2500 kbps.

Enjoy!"
,abhikrit,2012-03-26T10:08Z,"yeah i noticed the change in this one, you kept 2500 video bitrate in it :) anyway, as usual, its gonna be great i am sure, downloading it currently :)

What are your upcoming uploads, thought of anything yet?"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-27T00:00Z,"I have not enough bandwidth to sustain multiple new uploads !

I already have something ripped [ a few ] !"
