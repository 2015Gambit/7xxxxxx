RELEASE NOTES

The standalone expansion to the award-winning Total War: SHOGUN 2
explores the conflict between the Imperial throne and the last
Shogunate in 19th century Japan, 400 years after the events of the
original game. A dramatic clash of traditional Samurai culture with the
explosive power of modern weaponry

Guide ancient Japan into the modern age, as the arrival of America
Britain and France incites a ferocious civil war which will decide the
future of a nation

Dramatic 19th century Japan setting
Based on the backdrop of the Boshin War period, the new campaign starts
in 1864, a time of growing resentment against Western colonial power
and influence. As Japan begins to modernise and industrialise, the
inevitable social and economic changes lead to increasingly militant
nationalism and antipathy towards the Shogunate

6 new playable clans
Play as a clan supporting the Imperial throne, or the last Shogunate:
Shogunate clans: Aizu, Nagaoka, Jozai
Imperial clans: Choshu, Satsuma, Tosa

New foreign powers
The American, British and French nations play an important part in the
story of the Boshin war, and your relations with these foreign powers
will be integral to unit recruitment and to advancing your technology
trees

New 19th century Japan campaign map
The new island of Ezo extends the SHOGUN 2 campaign map northwards
Fully refreshed towns and other campaign map features reflect the new
time period, with railways making their first appearance in a Total War
title

Campaign map railways
Develop your own railway network to move armies and agents between your
regions
Railways can be sabotaged and transport can be blocked by enemy armies
who take control of parts of the line or stations

39 new land units
Including modern ranged units - such as the Gatling gun and Armstrong
gun - controllable in a new third-person mode
New units can also be recruited from foreign powers, including the
British Royal Marines, US Marine Corps and French Marines"
[V],extremezone,2012-03-26T22:29Z,"10 new naval unit types with a total of 21 ships
New steam-powered warships, heavily armed with modern artillery
Foreign ironclad ships can also be purchased, including the
Warrior-class ironclad

New port siege battle type
This new battle type triggers when attempting a naval assault on an
occupied enemy port
The attacking fleet must sail into the harbour and capture the port
running the gauntlet of coastal gun defences

New land and sea unit interactions
During a land battle, armies can call in offshore artillery support
barrages
Conversely, costal gun emplacements can target enemy ships during port
siege battles, when ending their turn within the range of upgraded
coastal defences
Campaign map bombardments: offshore naval units can bombard armies and
cities in adjacent coastal areas on the campaign map itself

3 new agent types
The Foreign Veteran, the Ishin Shishi and the Shinshengumi
Each new agent has its own skill tree, and Ninja and Geisha agents have
had their skill trees updated with new abilities

Improved siege battle mechanics
New upgradable tower defences can be built with a specific defence
specialty: archery, matchlock or Gatling gun
Multiplayer 2.0
New Conquest map reflecting the 19th century setting

Brand-new Fall of the Samurai avatar, including:
Over 40 new retainers
Over 30 new armour pieces
New 19th century avatar skill tree
Multiple avatars: players can enjoy multiple careers and progression
across Shogun 2 and Fall of The Samurai

[V],azizex666,2012-03-28T03:54Z,"Game works perfectly fine and here is the solution to all the people who are getting crashes due to ""modified exe"" error.
1- install following the directions provided by the uploader.
2- block shogun 2 .exe in your firewall from accessing the internet
3-enjoy 
Thanks for the up EZ!
also this game is heavy on system resources so make sure u meet the minimum sys requirements."

,dyfan91,2012-03-29T04:56Z,"@S8W7

Think that SEGA out-smart crackers by putting activation after crack. As you select a faction to play the description tells that the game is tampered with. This is only a guess though. (Also, I still use floppy disks sometimes!)"

When I apply the crack and everything, the game just won't start when I start it. Nothing happens at all. No notifications or CTDs, anything.

Maybe it could be because of CPU? But I played Shogun 2 normally, and still my CPU was below minimum."
,gfv1ct0r,2012-03-29T19:20Z,"Actually, my CPU is not below minimum. I fucked up something. Its okay. But still, why I can't start it?

The reason I said mine stops on the 9th turn is because an overwhelming amount of people are getting hit with CTD's and freezes on the 4th or 5th turn... even people who are using legit, steam copies... okay, genius?

If I feel you are willing to rip my money off with several new DLC, I won't be willing to give you anything.

THIS IS ONLY FOR THOSE WITH THE APPCRASH AT THE START OR A LAUNCH FAIL.

Alright guys this might help SOME of you.

To those who had the older version of Shogun 2 and used a different torrent then this one OR use any mods such as DARTHMOD and other stuff...

YOU NEED to go to START->USER->APPDATA->ROAMING->THE CREATIVE ASSEMBLY and delete it.

This is because you may have been using other mods and it is not compatible with this torrent version.
Ultimatly causing a crash.

Took me a week to figure out why I was crashing right at the start or why the game would not launch.

Although this crack does work to a certain point it did crash on me in game at a random time, so far its been only one crash but I only did one battle in custom war. I'll report for more crashes and will try the other cracks avalible here on the pirate bay."

,fitz093,2012-04-29T12:45Z,how do you get the lan to work. Unable to host a game
,ZalHack,2012-04-29T18:41Z,"HOW TO INSTALL AND FIX CRASHES

Alright folks I been messing around with this download about a month. I'll discribe what I expirianced since you may had the same problems.

Okay first off I had to wait a good few weeks till the download was done, pretty big file and more leechers then seeders so please be sure to seed once you got the download.

After plenty of waiting I finally was excited and went straight for the install. (I deleted my older shogun 2 the one with the phonix installer because this one seemed much more easy to install allot more comfortable and with all DLC's and full uptodate.) Once I installed this game I ran the provided crack for it. IT FAILED.

I was frustrated thought the provided crack in this download was not working so I went around and tried to get some other cracks and I found and read that certain cracks did work for other people and they were able to run the game even in this forum people claimed the crack did work but they had other problems then me at the time being.

A week passed I tried all cracks avalible and still no success. Then finally it got to me I made a NOOB mistake.

Since I had Shogun 2 before installed I was using mods like AUMSHO or DarthMOD. So I forgot to delete those scripts.

For people expiriancing this type of crash with this crack that you can't even get the game running I sugguest the following:

Go to: Start->User->Appdata->Roaming->The Creative Assembly and delete your shogun 2 from there!!!

Once I done this the crack provided in this download was finally working and I had reason to smile. But as I discovered not for long. I was finally playing and I was thinking to my self FUCK YEAH! Then suddenly in middle of a battle CRASH! I tried this a few times thought it may be just by chance and discovered anytime I did battle it would crash on me, I tried campain crash and was unable to even finish one single turn. This rendered the game unplayable. I was expiriancing the crashes that many in this forum were mentioning.

So I went again and tried some other cracks starting with this one:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7174234/Total_War_Shogun_2_Fall_of_the_Samurai_CRACK_FIX_

Many people their claim it works.
However when I tried it I was getting a very different crash, I was unable to even launch the game since I would get a crash instantly after clicking the crack.

So the fix for people expiriancing crash instantly with that crack is this one:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7134069/Total.War.Shogun.2.Fall.of.the.Samurai-SKIDROW-CrackOnly

It might not work for you or you might crash in game in that case try mixing the cracks.

It worked for me."
,ZalHack,2012-04-29T19:05Z,"Some more details about mixing the cracks.

Make sure you back up the original crack provided in this download.

And Back up this crack

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7174234/Total_War_Shogun_2_Fall_of_the_Samurai_CRACK_FIX_

And this crack

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7134069/Total.War.Shogun.2.Fall.of.the.Samurai-SKIDROW-CrackOnly

Lets label the cracks A, B and C respectivly.

Apply crack A from here and apply crack B BUT D NOT OVERWRITE the shogun2.exe

Try if that works for you.

If not delete the applied crack B and apply Crack A fresh again.

Then apply Crack C and DO NOT OVERWIRTE the shogun2.exe again.

See if that works for you.

If not try all cracks and OVERWRITE even the shogun2.exe

Should do the trick.

As for LAN gamepaly:

You can go into the multiplayer menu but are unable to host since this game needs steam to do that.

I have an idea BUT UNTESTED AND RISKY!!!

Get a new steam account for safty.

Get Hamachi or tunggle and run it.

Run steam and go to Game Library and click add a nonsteam game.

Then add the shogun2.exe and run shogun 2 from steam.

You may be able to host a lan game now but I have not tried this since it is risky however I can confirm that I was able to play DEAD ISLAND RELOADED with UPDATE V1.2 and V1.3 UPDATE.

But this might not be this case and if you have purchased games on steam then you might get banned for trying this out so DO IT ON O+YOUR OWN RISK!

Hope this helped!

AND SPECIAL THANKS TO SKIDROW FOR THIS AWESOME DOWNLOAD!!! AND THANKS TO Sengok20 AND MBB15 FOR THE CRACKS AND TO ALL YOU SEEDERS OUT THERE!!!"

Sorry to reply so late but it makes no difference since I do not know why that is the case, maybe a cpu problem or graphics card related. Check that your PC specs require the minimume settings even if its a bit smaller then that you can tweak your pc somewhat to increase the preformance such as Game Booster or doing some maintaince as in cleaning up junk files and uninstalling stuff you don't need a great program I would recommand that helped me ALLOT would be Advanced System Care PRO, speeded my computer up at least 40%.

And to everyone else I can confirm the games works flawlessly."
,ZalHack,2012-05-17T17:18Z,"Now we just need to figure out how we can play this through HAMACHI or TUNNGLE lan.

We can access the menu to create or join a lan.
It says steam is required to play, what I did is create a fake steam account and added it as a nonsteam game...

However the error remained the same, that steam is not running, I'm assuming this may be due to the steam_appid.config code. Since it creates a virtual steam so the game can run without it.

Any sugguestions of how we can all play this together?

I read allot of online forums, but the cracks they provided seemed EXTREMLY suspisius, asking me when applied if ""Do you want to run shogun2.exe?"" on the start up and my virus scan detecting it as a virus. Could be a false positive but I would not recommend it to anyone.

Wanna play with someone together :D

Please give me some ideas or tell me how we can play via hamachi or tunngle.

Great game and special thanks to skidrow and sega."

Hey man, sorry I can't...

Thats the thing I'd like to play via lan as well, but as far as my research goes it seems it is not possible (as of now).

I found various links such as this one:

http://www.patheticreviews.com/2011/03/19/install-shogun-2-total-war-with-download-links/

It gives a great detailed installation notes for THIS torrent. But when it coes to the LAN sections it says its not avalible for the time being.

I tried it with steam and still no joy.

So I can't help you unfortunatly.

However... I think there are ways to play it online via lan, but this does not apply to this latest shogun 2 version.

But I cannot confirm it for I rather not mess around with my installed game or download a older version.

We have to wait I guess till a multiplayer crack or something comes up."

Pretty much what NzLucifer said, I gave detailed instructions on page 13, try that and see if one of those work for you.

And Thanks NzLucifer.

@MakkeCrash,

I think I know what the problem could be, since I also had that type of crash.

If I remember correctly, this crash only happens if you had a previous shogun 2 installed and you were playing with certain mods such as Darthmod or AUMsho mod, anything that is a mod really.

Go to: Start->User->Appdata->Roaming->The Creative Assembly and delete your shogun 2 from there.

That should solve the problem."

As for anyone else, I've been investigating how to play this game via lan, I went through several sites, and many claim it works..."
,ZalHack,2012-06-18T06:20Z,"BTW sorry if I'm writing part wise, but somehow I can't send all at once :S

I will show you a few examples of those sites.

Here Senryakku just mentions saying one needs ""green luma"" in order to play via lan.
But fails to go into details...

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7141454/

Appearently skidrow has also made a lan version, (didn't work for me though) here is a link to that site:
"
,ZalHack,2012-06-18T06:27Z,"http://cs.rin DOT ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=59035&start=570

And lastly here are some links to the tools one needs for the lan,

Green luma, a modified steam make sure to make a fake account and use it a own risk they might perma ban you at steam so make sure you know what your doing if you purchased games etc: 

media  fire /?s99km7k4se4n537

And this is tunngle a sort of hamachi for those unfimiliar with it, its pretty kick ass, i think its even better then hamachi:

just write in tunngle download in your search bar

I tried alomost everything and NOTHING, worked for me, for those that wish to play lan please check these out you might discover something, and I would really be interested knowing how to play this via lan.

I hope to meet you all on the battlefield some day :D

Cheers!"

3. here is a link:http://mytopfiles.com/programs/file/install_flash_player_11_plugin_64bit/572627.htm
4.or copy the original installers name in google or whatever u use and rewrite 32 to 64

You need to find command line, run it like administrator, thru right click. Then write there /set  IncreaseUserVa  3072
After that restart pc. Game should now work fine. If you wanna recover the old setting, just again wrote there /deletevalue increaseuserva"
