The best 100 tracks in our opinion for 2011/beginning-2012
all in 320kbps high quality MP3
all have been manually edited, equalised, normalised, and had all volume/level issues on the original tracks (surprisingly many!) repaired, so this is in most cases better quality than the version you can buy.
If you like these songs, BUY THEM FROM THE ARTIST. Its the only way people like myself and the other producers can make any money. I'm providing this as a chart, and a sampler, for you to make an educated purchasing decision ONLY. Not for use beyond a brief trial to determine which tracks you like.
