,vonwisdom,2012-03-28T20:18Z,"Yes works,with genuine Embrace keygen.
Just make sure you fill in all the ""user id and key id ""so the offline option becomes usable.
also run the disable update when your done in the keygen folder.

tks for sharing Rise."

,Lestat57,2012-04-13T13:13Z,"Confirmed valid and working, version from january 2012, no trojan, works just fine on win7 64bit, keygen fully working, no problem with soundbanks, it even has a few exercise tabs included (from guitar method) . 

Thanks to the uploader!

Note: DOES NOT include them ""bonus"" additional soundbanks which we are all desperately looking for. Just the regular ones which we had before."

algunos antivirus detectan un virus en los keygen, pero en realidad no existe ese virus.
pon en tu antivirus al keygen como una excepción.
NO TIENE VIRUS!!!!

,max33CA,2012-05-13T11:02Z,"Problem. I followed the instructions and disabled my McAfee but the files I end up with are the GP6 .rar (extracted); .exe file; Guitar.Pro.v6.0.7.9063.Windows.Keymaker-EMBRACE and 'disable-updates.reg, but no keygen. Help please! Thanks"

Don't forget to install the soundbanks."
,Deimon7,2012-06-09T08:12Z,"Para lo que dicen que tienen el KeyGen: A mi me paso, es por el Antivirus que los bloquea, en el .rar aparecía, pero no lo descompromía, todo lo demás si. Yo lo que hice fue: reinicie windows en modo seguro (Al inicial la pc aprietas F8 y aparece la opción. En modo seguro descomprimes el keygen, abres el GuitarPro, ejecutas el keygen, pegas la clave y listo!"
,Stressor,2012-09-21T14:54Z,Virus: Used sandboxie and it tried to install wajam among other things. So many fake comments or people that don't have a clue what goes on in their computer.
