These are the official soundtracks for the elder scrolls games. I have gathered and organized them myself. This is as close to a pretty looking iTunes release as you're going to get. All the songs have proper tags (artist, album, song name) and they all have the album art. This is probably the easiest way to get it right on your iPod becasue I have done all of the work for you. I promise there isn't any bullshit you'll have to deal with later in this torrent Enjoy and please seed.
