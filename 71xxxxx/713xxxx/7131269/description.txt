Details:

Black Friday is Faderhead's fourth album. It was released 8 October 2010. It is the first album title not to follow the FH album trend, as unlike previous albums, Black Friday is Faderhead's first concept album. There are 16 tracks, each a new part of the overall story arc. It tells the story of a Friday night gone wrong, from the end of the working day, to the fun in the clubs, the inevitable crash, and all the chaos in between. A short film has been shot to tie in with the promotion of the album, and portrays the story in a visual medium.
