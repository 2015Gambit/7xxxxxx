,BakaBaka11,2012-03-27T14:56Z,How to get WAMP to work properly? I can launch it just fine but it does nothing (the game cant find www.desura.com/external/games/projectzomboid.php). Followed instructions and stuff. p.s. Win7 x86
,rapsis2x2,2012-03-27T16:09Z,"I don't have a ""hosts"" file, only lmhosts."
,dannyboy108,2012-03-27T16:24Z,"Look if you're going to send out this game.
Send out the entire game, cracked.
Don't leech from THEIR download servers.
That's just poor man.
Support the developer don't make them pay just because you guys want a freebie.

Think about it, it's a win-win.
You try the game, you buy it.
Not leech the files from their servers, which costs them money. This is exactly why the game was taken down at first!"
,MrFeebl,2012-03-27T19:53Z,"Great, now get to work on 2.0p :D"
,Boxmanbr,2012-03-27T22:21Z,"I'm on #terraria irc on IronDust server, if you want (I don't care if I get banned, I can enter the server through proxies)

@BakaBaka11
Possible causes:
You didn't do the step 6, 7 and 8 incorrectly or you didn't opened WampServer, you have to start it everytime you start your windows

@dannyboy108 okay, I missed about this fact, but I would have to reupload the game everytime it updates itself (frequently, at least for now), that's why I didn't included the game on this folder.

@MrFeebl Probably it works, but I will check if it doesn't, if it doesn't, I will leave a message"
,Boxmanbr,2012-03-27T22:25Z,"@dannyboy108 but I was on forums and I changed my mind, since I saw how bad it was, so I will upload the game with the files.

@rapsis2x2 maybe, if it includes ""127.0.0.1 localhost"" inside the file, It should work"
,Boxmanbr,2012-03-27T22:31Z,"Yes, I see that lemmy did a update to make exactly my crack don't work with the game, I will check if I can circunvent this"
,watdis,2012-03-27T22:46Z,"@Boxmanbr Not to defend or anything but lagging 1 version behind would be better for IndieStone. Besides, they are pretty fast anyway and last few versions were just adding some protection aka nothing that usual player would benefit from."
,Boxmanbr,2012-03-27T22:53Z,"About newer versions:
Sorry everyone, I saw they have made a protection to http://127.0.0.1/external/games/projectzomboid.php, I will only be able to crack the newer versions if I has the knowledge to decompile files (I know how to decompile from other languages, but not java yet). I don't know how to do it yet and I'm bored to do it, I will try when the full version of Project Zomboid be released, unless someone do it before me.

About how I found the way to crack it:
I didn't decompiled the files to crack Project Zomboid, I just saw readable words on GameWindow.class, so I tested things and I had found a way to crack it. Nothing big, just luck."
,Boxmanbr,2012-03-27T23:04Z,"I don't know how to decompile java yet and  they did a protection to http://127.0.0.1/external/games/projectzomboid.php, so I'm not able to do a crack anymore, only if I be able to decompile and compile it, I'm bored to do it, but I will find a way when it goes to beta stage"
,Boxmanbr,2012-03-27T23:06Z,"About the irc thing, I mean't #projectzomboid channel on freenode server"
,rhodee,2012-03-27T23:23Z,bomb could you put 2.0o up  the game files?

,lordedoome,2012-03-29T00:34Z,"Hey man does this Crack still works with all the versions or only 2.0o
