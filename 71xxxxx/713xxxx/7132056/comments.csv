There are only the original four maps, and you will not be able to update this version to play online. 

wsolp, you should have mentioned all this when posting this download."
,Blopayo,2012-03-29T06:34Z,"Agree. Also, it's with all episodes availables from the beggining.... Where's the challenge?"
,wsolp,2012-04-01T04:37Z,sorry.
,xlevelx,2012-04-01T19:36Z,"wsolp... it takes a big person to say they're sorry. 

I see you have put up other things you feel strong enough to share. It's a lot more than many do. 

Don't stop!"
,Fullcheater2,2012-04-02T15:45Z,DUDE YOUR A JERK WHERES THE FUCKING PROGRAM THAT RUNS THE GAME!?

,xlevelx,2012-04-21T19:04Z,"To Fullcheater2... If you had looked at your desktop, and/or also in the folder, you'd see the Left 4 Dead launcher. It's the Red thing that is labeled ""LEFT4DEAD"". 

If you are that inept in downloading, and as impatient as you seem to be, go out and buy the game instead of broadcasting how big of a dumbass you are instead of trying to insult someone when it is you that are completely clueless in how to use something you got for free."
,xPSwerv,2012-04-22T21:27Z,"In detail, where is the launcher file? It isn't on my desktop."
,xlevelx,2012-04-23T06:09Z,"To xPSwerv... You'll need to run the setup file in the download folder. It runs in DOS mode, after which, the ""LEFT4DEAD"" icon will be placed on your desktop as well as in the folder. "
