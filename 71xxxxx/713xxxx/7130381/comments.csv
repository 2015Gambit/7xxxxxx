Thanks everyone for the donations."

,fixx0red,2012-03-25T19:59Z,"Please dont post spoilers in comments. I'd like to enjoy the race without knowing what happens ahead of time, an it's hard to avoid reading comments that may relate to torrent quality.

Thanks again slicknick."

,gkc135,2012-03-26T03:01Z,It's not a spoiler. He is lying. He has done this before. Just watch the races and you will see the true results.
,whatarrow,2012-03-26T05:36Z,Thanks Slick! Love your work a lot!
,SooperX77,2012-03-26T08:29Z,Barcia sure is an asshole rider. He deserves the broken leg!

,MxRob,2012-03-28T23:14Z,"Hey Slicknick, I'm watching the races from 2010 you put up in 720p, nut sure what you do different from then and now but the resolution is WAAAAY better back then in comparission of now, why is that?"
,slicknick610,2012-03-31T00:30Z,@MxRob I used to capture and post in 720p 60fps and I had a different cable provider. Now I capture in 1080i 30fps and post in 720p 30fps. A while back I did notice the difference but then I had a problem capturing in 720p 60fps with my capture device. Now I figured out how to fix it. This weekend I am gonna capture in 720p 60fps and post in 720p 30fps. I do not want to post in 60fps because it takes double as long to encode and it takes a lot of processor speed to play it and a lot of people will not like that. Also no one else posts in 60fps on the internet.
