Head Hunter [2002] VHS Rip

A night security guard finds himself trapped in a warehouse with an escaped serial killer.

TJ Owens used his GED to get the best job he could find that would let him remain a loafer: a security gig at a local warehouse. It seemed easy enough, but the job quickly becomes far from routine when he is trapped in his workplace with a serial killer who gets his jollies by mentally torturing victims before decapitating them. TJ must go from slacker to survivalist if he's going to make it out alive.
