Narratives:

The Origin of the Feces is the second album by Brooklyn band Type O Negative, which was released in 1992. The album was produced to sound as if it had been recorded at a live show by adding crowd noises, banter with the fictitious audience, and even a song stopping because the venue supposedly had a bomb threat called in. This was done to simulate some controversy the band had on tour in Europe for the Slow Deep and Hard tour. The band is well known among fans for weaving this type of dry humor into their often gloomy music.
