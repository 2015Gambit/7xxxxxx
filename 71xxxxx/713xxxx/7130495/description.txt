The Decemberists have announced the March 13 release of We All Raise Our Voices To The Air (Live Songs 04.11-08.11), a 20-track live double-album (and triple-vinyl set) culled from the band's 2011 tour supporting their chart-topping, Grammy-nominated album The King Is Dead. With songs spanning their entire first decade as a band--from their debut EP 5 Songs through each of their six LP's--We All Raise Our Voices To The Air is the first-ever live album from a band that has grown into one of rock's most thrilling live acts.
