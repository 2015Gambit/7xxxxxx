Asalaamo Allykoum,

Here is the English translation in subtitle, of the arab documentary film exposing Shiite deviant teachings in Iran. Some of the images may be considered graphic but these misguided people cut themselves in their misguided festivals.

Some of the websites mentioned at the beginning are no longer working for some reason, but may Allah(SWT) reward the brothers who translated this for the English speaking Muslims.
