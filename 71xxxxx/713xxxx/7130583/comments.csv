,kalle512,2012-03-25T17:12Z,Thanks !!!
,jb4thewin,2012-03-25T17:15Z,"Yes, footy, love you! 
Just because Skysports is so good, I won't watch anything else, and you make it happen for us. Don't mind people bitching about HD, it's the show that counts."
,Moonleaf,2012-03-25T17:18Z,"Thanks M8, does anyone know what happened with the BBCs F1 broadcasting?"
,Torporo,2012-03-25T17:23Z,Thnx!!!
,Torporo,2012-03-25T17:25Z,Moonleaf: I think it's a shared broadcast thing now.
,b_petrov,2012-03-25T17:36Z,"magnet link ??? What is wrong with good old .torrent files? How I am suppose to download it and seed in my server if the rtorrent client doesn't support magnet...
Very very disappointing :("
,ghasrac,2012-03-25T17:37Z,Wonderful! Thanks footy!
,Xclibr57,2012-03-25T17:38Z,Thanks bro! You are a legend!
,Xclibr57,2012-03-25T17:40Z,"@Moonleaf Sky is the official broadcaster now, BBC still has their own broadcast but it is delayed. Sky commentary is WAY better tho"
,MukBro,2012-03-25T17:41Z,Thanks footy!
,EdoSensei,2012-03-25T17:47Z,"Thanks. Just 2 races of the new season in and footy seems to be the best F1 uploader who's appeared on TPB! Swift, complete Quali and Race plus extras. Even with a large TV, SD is the better option because HD files are just too big! And less people DL them so there's fewer seeds.

A sterling job you're doing FOOTY.  Much appreciated."
,darren21,2012-03-25T17:50Z,thank you so much footy!!!!i will kiss ur ass if i have to!ure the best!!
,yokou,2012-03-25T17:50Z,Bravoooo!!!
,therarewoollyone,2012-03-25T17:51Z,"Thank you so much, once again - I will be relying on you and people like yourself for the whole of this season. The BBC obviously, will be doing 10 shows live, but, for all of the others - you're my guy! Thanks thanks thanks!

(I see from your other torrents, you've done some HD/720p uploads - will you be doing this with this race and the others? -either way, ta again!)"
,Bali2011,2012-03-25T17:58Z,Thanks boss!
,tasshab,2012-03-25T17:58Z,thanks a lot appreciate it
,mutineer,2012-03-25T17:58Z,"Thanks again Footy,
All us F1 fans in North America depend on people like you, and we all really appreciate your hard work.
I can wait for HD later in the week, it""ll give me a chance to watch again, so never mind those that whine.
Besides, some people have download limits on their ISP acccounts, and SD is good for them, just based on file size.
Cheers Mate, and thanks again,"
[T],footy,2012-03-25T18:01Z,"@b_petrov

Search the Info hash on google, you can get the torrent from a different site than TPB.

HD rip up after 2 Hours."
,old-dominion,2012-03-25T18:09Z,Footy Saved Me! (missed the race at 4 am)
,durenkian,2012-03-25T18:09Z,Fantastic footy. You're the best.
,Peter_Alien,2012-03-25T18:11Z,"Excellent, thank you footy"
,gustafssondesign,2012-03-25T18:17Z,thx
,nex-s,2012-03-25T18:20Z,"Waiting for HD, haha.

I don't understand some people who think Sky is much better though. In what way? In the unexperienced commentators? Hill is ok, and M. Brundle and the other people that are from BBC, but everyone else is pretty much ***... I hate how they advertise their own stuff, how the filmed interviews and videos repeat both before qualification and race, how all the interviews seem forced, how they make drivers explain the race track etc. BBC was much more relaxed and, in my opinion, informative. Better commentary, better jokes, better everything. Want those BBC funny videos with F1 drivers back."
,tasshab,2012-03-25T18:23Z,"hi there everyone.
would highly appreciate if they seed as long as they could pls because the speed is very low
thank you"
,kekebook66,2012-03-25T18:43Z,Thankyou Footy! Much apreciated! You are a legend!
,Flytrap0,2012-03-25T18:43Z,"Thanks footy... I really appreciate your uploads... so, my comment below is not intended to be critical of the effort i know it must take to get the race posts uploaded so quickly.

But...

Damn it, man... this is soooo slow. I am uploading at up to 10 times the speed that I am downloading and have uploaded about 4 times the volume I have downloaded, so far.

With so many seeders, why is the download so slow!?"
,angh_rock,2012-03-25T19:29Z,great man...fantastic!!
,leichtbau,2012-03-25T19:38Z,Thank you very much!
,killem2,2012-03-25T19:47Z,"Thanks for uploading this. Is there a reason it shows over 1000 seeders and only 2 are active?  I mean are you other 998 mother fuckers really that pathetic or am I doing something wrong?

I see after I am done, but i generally never get to seed until about 24 hrs after the upload because cocksuckers don't seed. 

Should I have initial seeding on? DHT?  I don't know what half this shit does, all I want to do is download this, share it, and do it again next race. "
,sec_11,2012-03-25T19:55Z,"Thanks for uploading footy, but the download speed now is just awfully slow! Come on guys, please seed!"
,popeye013,2012-03-25T20:05Z,"Is this the Hannibal one from TheBox ? 
You'll know because it will say along the bottom of the screen at various times....? 
Thank you though"
,surfboi,2012-03-25T20:15Z,"Thanks a lot,Swedish coverage sucks ass..."
,nex-s,2012-03-25T21:01Z,"When's the HD rip coming footy? 3hrs now, hehe. Hope I can start downloading it today and enjoy it tomorrow after work."
,playjay1987,2012-03-25T22:00Z,nice one footy keep them coming. and would you be able to do practice and qualy to? 
,ttford,2012-03-25T22:10Z,Thanks
,giffo5,2012-03-25T23:18Z,"Thanks so much Footy ! Your a star !! 
We all really appreciate the hard work ! 
I will seed as long as i can.
As far as the Sky coverage.. I love the fact they took Crofty to run with Brundle in the commentary box.. that makes it so much better. Damon hill is a bit stiff, but im sure he will relax with time. I dont see the point of the stupid SkyBox where the stupid blonde and and Anthony davidson explain things in more detail. Sack her and have Anthony out in the pits talking to the drivers with Ted Kravitz ! OR just doing extra videos like Martin used too.
Martins Grid walk has always been one of my favorite things about the build up, so im glad we still have that. We dont get full use of all the SKY features of course...like driver cams and helmet cams n stuff... so we dont see it all, but my mate in the UK loves it ! lol... Im just happy to get the uploads of the race n qually ! ...so thanks again Footy !!"
,SerSpec-V,2012-03-26T01:06Z,^^^I agree with you giffo5. I'm glad that Brundle is on Sky but I miss Jake and Eddie. The stupid SkyBox should go. Thanks footy!
,1F1,2012-03-26T02:11Z,YOU are amazing sir! THANK YOU FOR THE UPLOAD!
,killem2,2012-03-26T02:43Z,"As far  as the coverage, sky has a lot more frills, which I tend to like, but I would have at least liked to have DC back.  

And as far as the torrent goes, shame on these fucking leechers.  You know you could at least seed at 25k/sec  it may not be much but if everyone did it, it would be great. 

10k/sec down load speed,

600k upload

seems fair. : "
,sabesm,2012-03-26T03:37Z,Thanks for the release
,Chuck2012,2012-03-26T04:02Z,Can someone upload this a little faster. 25k/bs is a fricking crying shame
,1F1,2012-03-26T04:38Z,Cmon guys! Seed seed seeeed! I'm at 27% and it's going like 50 kb/s and I've already uploaded 2.9gigs! gogogo!
,mysticsquee,2012-03-26T07:25Z,"thank you so much. you are a king among men. 
fantastic effort and fantastic race. please keep it up. 

i agree sky isnt as good as bbc, but hey, we get to see formula one racing so who gives a f**k?

and sd/hd? if yr that concerned fork out for sky so you can watch it in ""glorious hd and dolby surround sound"" fah!"
,Chuck2012,2012-03-26T07:32Z,"Thanks for speeding things, to whomever did it. "
,ali_nba,2012-04-08T14:29Z,"awesome torrent,,thanks alot Footy, keep up the good work"
