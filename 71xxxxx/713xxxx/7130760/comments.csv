,romeo2539,2012-03-28T17:20Z,"This chick dated this guy with Asperger's and then let her family convince her to abort the child stating that the child might have Asperger's and that she should finish college first. This girl, RUTH, killed their unborn child and Shane (the boyfriend) started to lash out by posting her pics online. The media seem to lose track of the lies told by the family and this Ruth chick. Funny how Ruth is now begging for attention in the media but told the courts that she gets depressed and want to kill herself everytime she thinks about what happened.....THEN WHY IS SHE STILL TRYING TO GAIN PUBLIC NOTICE IN THE MEDIA TALKING ABOUT IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN? Now i am not saying what Shane did is right but what they did to him and his unborn child is far worse than right. They even lied and claimed that the Child was aborted due to this harassment. That doesnt make sense as she still called him boyfriend and stated multiple times that she went to him for support during the harrassment until she found it to be him. Something just doesnt add up.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2055678/Shane-Webber-stalked-girlfriend-Ruth-Jeffery-online-jailed-4-months.html#"
