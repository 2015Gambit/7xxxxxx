Prager 20120327  3 Ultimate Issues Hour: Something from Nothing

Prager H3 Dennis builds on a topic he started yesterday. A new book by a prominent scientist says that something 
(like the universe) can come from nothing based on certain universal physical laws. 
But where did those laws come from? The truth is that science canΓÇÖt prove how the universe began. 
ItΓÇÖs nonsense to suggest that it can.

Prager H2 The Trayvon Martin case gets more complex as new information emerges. Still, we donΓÇÖt know what happened
 at the scene, so everyone should restrain from making judgments. The media and ΓÇ£black leadersΓÇ¥ like Al Sharpton and
 Jesse Jackson havenΓÇÖt got the messageΓÇª The second day of the Supreme CourtΓÇÖs ObamaCare hearings dealt with the core
 issue ΓÇô are there limits to the governmentΓÇÖs power?
