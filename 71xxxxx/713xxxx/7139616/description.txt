Description:

The idea in making this training manual was to create my specific style so it could be replicated. My mission was to train my two new Photographers to do what I do. I needed to create a "Formula" that was easy to learn but allowed my photographers room for their own creative expression, whilst showing them all the incredible things I've learned and developed over the last 17 years shooting women.

I built 14 shooting sets in my shooting room with 14 different light & tone scenarios that they could incorporate with my poses. Posing is just not taught anymore and these cards are about teaching simple & gorgeous posing techniques to make women look great and want to buy all of their portraits.

The cards of this manual explain the poses of these scenarios, how they are executed with one window, one reflector and natural light. I've learned over the years to direct with expression body language movement and personality. This deck has 80 double sided easy to learn postcard sized cards all from real shoots, a great way to get inspired before a shoot.
