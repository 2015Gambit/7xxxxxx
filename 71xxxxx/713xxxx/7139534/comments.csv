I know people all over the world who use it. You just need a supported pay menthod."
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-02T20:46Z,"He said Howard TV you retard.  Learn to read.

The answer is no... as HTV service is not even available in the US in some places and isn't available on DirectTV or Satellite.  Only select cable providers.

Although it is available outside the US.  They offer it in Canada on ""Roger's Cable"" or something like that.  Not too familiar with Canadian providers but I know that's one of them."

Even though he is jewish he will believe in it if it means more time off!

In the meantime they will be airing ""20 Years Gone: A Tribute To Sam Kinison"" all week long (even thursday & friday).  The specials are 7+ hours long so give me time to post them.

They will return live next Monday, April 9th.

PEACE & LOVE."
