He desperately needs you to visit his website full of stolen content so he can make milk money off the ADs he plasters all over in order to support his drug habit to drown out the fact that he still lives with his mommy and daddy.

Make sure you deal with the 1000 redirections and advertisements just to download some third rate recording he stole from the newgroups and took credit for.

Clearly he doesn't know how getting a job works.

Feel free to call him and let him know.

You locking your site down and not uploading torrents in time actually gets him more revenue.."
