GX Developer supports all MELSEC controllers from the compact PLCs of the MELSEC FX series to the modular PLCs including MELSEC System Q. This software shines with a simple, intuitive interface and a short learning curve.

GX Developer supports the MELSEC instruction list (IL), MELSEC ladder diagram (LD) and MELSEC sequential function chart (SFC) languages. You can switch back and forth between IL and LD at will while you are working. You can program your own function blocks (MELSEC QnA/QnAS/System Q series), and a wide range of utilities are available for configuring special function modules for the MELSEC System Q. And "configure" is the operative word here - you no longer need to program special function modules, you just configure them.

The package includes powerful editors and diagnostics functions for configuring your MELSEC networks and hardware, and extensive testing and monitoring functions to help you get your applications up and running quickly and efficiently.

You can also test all of your program's key functions before they are implemented with the GX Simulator offline simulation mode.

GX Simulator also enables you to simulate all your devices and application responses for realistic testing.
