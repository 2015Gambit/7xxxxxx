Who knows why they called it Hardbreak Ridge, probably the same reason why the most famous ice creamery based in Arizona named their franchise "Cold Stone". Everyone knows that there are no cold stones in Arizona...pause. The only thing hard in this movie are the cocks going into these three hot gals ridges! The creamery comes later, after they've had their "fill". It`s why we love the 80`s classics so much!
