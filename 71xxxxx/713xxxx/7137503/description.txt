The blades of Karma's saw spin once again. 
Around the beginning of 2011, I asked a good friend of mine and fellow musician, Floyd Murray, to lay down a guitar lead on Karma In Remission, track 3 from Pressure & Obsession. I always though that the groove-heavy middle section of the song needed a solo, but I was never capable of laying down the right type of lead that I thought it needed. Floyd was, and tracked it perfectly. It was recorded at Floyd's house during January & February of '11, and released for free on the RM Soundcloud page on July 3.
