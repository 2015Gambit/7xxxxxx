[T],AncientRome,2012-03-29T05:10Z,"You make it seem as if I haven't tested these one by one, as if I'm giving garbage.

Through simple observation you can see that I don't advertise on your torrents, I expect the same in return."
,ryzy,2012-03-29T09:22Z,"Of course you can think like this.
But thruth is that I tested 100% (i completed game) all my call of duty series. I think that 50 GB is hard to seed in one torrent and just is my opinion i'm not criticize your torrent."
[T],AncientRome,2012-03-29T16:54Z,"You implied again that mine are not 100% tested.

I made sure all of the images worked properly, both being burned and being mounted, installed, and played through the entire set games to make sure they worked.

Unless you have proof that they are not 100% working, and are completely inferior to your releases, I would the conversation end here."
,leahken357,2012-05-19T02:05Z,more seeds please..i'll seed this torrent after i finish downloading..
,filasouf,2012-05-27T01:05Z,Seed please !! :(
,filasouf,2012-05-27T01:08Z,"It's rarely to find this great collection with the full releases, that's why we need to seed and seed

*_* 

Thanks"
