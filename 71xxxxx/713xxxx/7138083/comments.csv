,calebs1,2012-04-01T03:19Z,The audio is off in the videos.
,Salt(1),2012-04-01T13:09Z,"Off as in audio is non-existent or off as in off sync? I just checked all the episodes for audio and any distortion, using Windows Media Player Classic, it seems fine to me. Are you maybe using Windows Media Player? I tend to have off sync audio when I go to full screen due to lack of RAM and a bad video card."
,squiggsy,2012-04-01T19:35Z,"The subs are terrible, although they seem well translated they disappear at random points and on ep8 they overlap some other hard subs and become impossible to read at the start, it gets a bit annoying after a while I'm not gunna lie... Other than that though, this is a pretty decent torrent."
,calebs1,2012-04-03T23:23Z,"Off as in the audio is off synch. Of course I don't use Windows Media Player Classic. I use VLC Media player and it has never given me trouble. Also, I have pretty decent amount of ram along with VLC never giving me trouble. I'll try redownloading and see if it was just that."
,Scarecrovv,2012-04-18T22:53Z,"Audio is off sync, tried both VLC and WMP (not classic), the sync is large enough to keep it from being watchable. "

,bno112300,2012-04-19T04:58Z,"the audio is defiantly off by a number of seconds.
does anyone know how to correct this issue either by re-encoding or by altering some setting in VLC?"
,darkdragon0493,2012-06-08T08:03Z,"VLC>Tools>Track Synchronization>Synchronization

mess a little in that tab to check if you  can synchronize the audio or the subs."
,KOTYAR0,2012-06-21T19:31Z,"The audio/video sync at the 1st episod is totally FUCKED UP (sorry for language but that's annoying as hell)
Yeah, and in 8th ep. 50% of comments are written on previous comments, so you cannot read A DAMN THING (audio/video sync is ok though)
Maybe smb can help with all this audio/video recoding stuff?
P.S. i haven't watched others, so I dunno yet how are they. The most disappointing thing is what quality nad subtitles are very good... really"
