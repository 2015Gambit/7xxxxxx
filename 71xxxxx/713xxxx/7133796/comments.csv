,caixa,2012-03-28T16:54Z,"Why does this need a [k]? As it says on their website ""Sublime Text 2 may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must be purchased for continued use. There is currently no enforced time limit for the evaluation."""
,soikmd2,2012-03-29T04:11Z,What about windows version? Please seed it!
,tmemphist,2012-03-30T22:19Z,"@caixa, read the website:

""Please submit any feature requests to http://sublimetext.userecho.com/ ""

,pkp6795,2012-04-24T18:47Z,how do i crack it? the patch button is disabled?? please help
,qcom,2012-04-26T07:11Z,"@pkp6795, don't worry it's simple.

Just open the dmg file first (I'm assuming you're on a mac).

Once that's done, open the ""patcher"" (from the other zip file).

Select your Sublime Text 2 application (most likely you dragged this into your ""Applications"" folder and drag it into the icon on the patcher.

Select ""patch"" and you're good to go."

Thanks, it works!"
,mortein79,2012-05-10T21:40Z,"Weird. Drag the icon, ""Sucssesfull patch"" but nothing to be changed. Stay the UNREGISTERED message, and sometimes bring up a ""donate"" window."
,tobsn,2012-05-19T14:02Z,crack doesn't work.
