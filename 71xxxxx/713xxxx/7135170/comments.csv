,evan111,2012-05-25T23:09Z,Uhhmmmm.... I can't get it to work. I even downloaded software that plays MKV files. Still nothing.... help?
,ffsihateu,2012-06-01T16:22Z,"[khemist], as well as 1080p, could you upload 720p BD rip? I'm just worried that this web download will have inferior quality and maybe it's censored?"

Beautiful work. An excellent option for people with limited hard drive space but a taste for quality rips.

Heads up: WDTV Live compatible, though I experienced slight audio glitches during parts of some episodes. Likely rather an issue with player than files."
