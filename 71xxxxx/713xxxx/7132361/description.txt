x264 AAC 720 x 404 30fps

PS Last weeks 2Hypocritical sd 264 was a
nuke due to being crf 19, however even
though ours at 21 was, frame by frame
superior, we did not proper like they
would since that is just lame.

PPS Also using US in the directory for
this show is banned by both sd and 720p
x264 rules, but since we are not
desperate douchebags like FQM, we do
not waste our time sitting around
nuking for directory mislabels. 90
