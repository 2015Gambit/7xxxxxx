,deim0n,2012-03-26T15:00Z,@Poffik It's not his fault you have a crap Internet connection. I downloaded it in under an hour. Stick to standard def stuff and stop complaining.
,poffik,2012-03-26T15:19Z,"I live in sweden, my connection is 50mbs Download and 30Mbs upload, i literally upload about 8 GB's on scenelines torrents before my download even gets to 5%

his torrents are being uploaded from india or something"
,poffik,2012-03-26T15:21Z,"It's not my problem, it's his shit upload, take a look at seeder to leech ration, can you honestly not see the problem? -_-

,Max200088,2012-03-26T16:13Z,Won't connect to seeds. What the fuck is wrong with this torrent?
,pbox1128,2012-03-26T17:55Z,"Does anyone know why in God's name people still break up videos into RAR files? Doesn't bittorrent completely obviate the need to do that?

Furthermore, the rar in this torrent fails the CRC check and the video dies while watching at multiple places in it. So basically, this torrent is pointless and corrupted."
,perezbros,2012-03-26T20:05Z,File is corrupted. Failed CRC check after unrar. Rar files in torrents are just trouble.
,balanced,2012-03-27T01:05Z,scenline's ups are shite in so many ways.  The only thing it has is usually that it's the first up.  I always wait a while and get someone else's and I encourage other's to do the same so that torrents uploaded correctly get more seeds and peers.  strangle the mofo.
,uhh1,2012-03-27T08:37Z,"Though it did take a while to download, and it was a bit annoying that it had to be extracted from rar files, I would like to say that the video played just fine for me, and did not ""die"" at any point during playback.  I was using the most recent version of VLC player."
,fieldof,2012-03-27T12:42Z,"Have not yet played the whole video, but seems to work OK.  I'll guess this was originally posted to a newsgroup - why else split it into 60 rar archives?
