Many thanks m8! Just keep the great encoded episodes come!"
,JChanty97,2012-04-03T11:01Z,No new episode yet?
,kipenz,2012-04-10T08:30Z,Still alive PHR?
,PHR16384,2012-04-13T06:30Z,"@kipenz:  Yeah, I'm still here.  There was a thrilling altercation involving hordes of pirates, ninjas, zombies and PEZ dispensers... but that's a tale too detailed for a comment on TPB.

ZR and YayPonies only just released #23 and 24 yesterday.  I'll post the torrents in an hour or two."
