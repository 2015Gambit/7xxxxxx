the audio is just a weebit out of sync
maybe nost havent noticed?

+100ms in vlc seems to adjust it enough

you can fix this in avidemux.org in like 1 min
if want too.. tick time on the side and enter 100
then go file pulll save video.. and enter a name
1 min.,, its done."

and some intro to video editing and conversions

beta 2.6 is much better it actually works with mp4s
and dont crash on loading them kiek the alpha build!"
