Roger Sessions is primarily talked about as the teacher of Mr. Who-Cares-If-You-Listen himself, Milton Babbitt; thus, his name usually evokes memories of the dry-as-dust inversionally combinatorial pitch set partitions of that Most Esteemed Demigod of American Academic Music, sending most of us to the exits. Imo, this is unfair; I believe Sessions is an interesting composer who deserves to be listened to on his own terms. He may, in fact, be one of the 2 or 3 *good* Pulitzer-Prize-winning American composers amidst all the mediocrity. :-) The selections and performances on this disc are, I think, excellent, so definitely give them a shot. 

Please note: Because of the MPAA/RIAA's pathetic new campaign to make ISPs their 
flunkies, I am now *requiring* full stream encryption for all BitTorrent connections. All modern clients support encryption; if you're using something that doesn't, upgrade!
