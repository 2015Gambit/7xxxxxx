Greatest Hits (2008)




After ushering in the era of pop-metal with their 1986 blockbuster Slippery When Wet and its hit singles ΓÇ£You Give Love a Bad Name,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Wanted Dead or Alive,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Living on a Prayer,ΓÇ¥ Bon Jovi wound up transcending the big-haired ΓÇÿ80s, withstanding changes in style and sound to become one of the biggest American rock bands of their time, selling over 120 million albums worldwide, and sustaining their popularity well into the new millennium. As the times changed, so did the bandΓÇÖs sound. They slowly peeled away the arena rock guitars of the ΓÇÿ80s, occasionally scoring on the adult contemporary charts and sometimes singing country music without ever rejecting hard rock, a move that illustrated how they never abandoned their roots and became second only to Bruce Springsteen in defining the sound and spirit of New Jersey rock & roll.
