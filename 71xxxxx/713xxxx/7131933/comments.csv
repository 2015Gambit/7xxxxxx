 was nice to find a trainer i can use with my laptop since the customizers dont work for me and no num pad"

I'm not complaining I'm simply pointing this out so that S4A who's done great stuff may take a look at this and fix whatever has gone wrong with this torrent.  I'm a seeder and not a NOOB so please I would really like a working trainer cuz as the other comment I'm on A Laptop Have no Num-Pad and Im sure Scene4all would want this working.  I've gone to other sites and found this very torrent and got the same errors last night and wont go through that mess again as Pirate Bay is the place to be.  So please S4A could you at the very least take a look at this I'm only getting what I think is 2 of what should be 3 files.  Either way thanks,  studly22"

,studly22,2012-04-08T02:14Z,"I guess scene4all is not interested in fixing his uploaded torrent which is sad.  See I fixed my downloader and still get element errors for this torrent.  After scanning it's not my downloader, not my system it's definatly the torrent.  So please for those lonely folks who have laptops and no Number Pads (Not number keys) cause the other trainer requires a num pad.  So please re-upload or at least respond letting everyone know you arn't going to fix it please and thank you.  Truth be told you are a great uploader and I thought you would want to fix this.  At the very least one person got it to enjoy."
