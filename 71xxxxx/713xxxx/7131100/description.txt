Faith is George Michael's first solo album, released in October 1987 via Columbia Records/Epic Records. 
The album has won several awards including the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1989. To date, 
the album has sold over 20 million copies worldwide, and received diamond certification from the 
Recording Industry Association of America. Faith spawned six top-five singles that substantially helped 
it dominate the chart of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 480 on Rolling Stone's 
"500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The album was also notable for entering the R&B albums chart at 
number-one making it the first album by a Caucasian artist to hit the top spot on that chart, mainly 
due to the R&B/funk-leaning singles that were released from the album, most notably, "One More Try"
"I Want Your Sex" and "Father Figure".
