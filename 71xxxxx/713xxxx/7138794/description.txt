
Jan Siegel: Twisting Reality March 2002 


Jan Siegel was born Amanda Jane Askew and published her first work under her married name, Amanda Hemingway. Though her first novel, Pzyche (1982), was SF, her publisher persuaded her to write thrillers instead; four followed, from Tantalus (1984) to Soulfire (1994). Then she decided to pursue writing fantasy under a new name, Jan Siegel, beginning with Prospero's Children (1999), followed by The Dragon-Charmer (2000), and continuing with Witches' Honour (The Witch Queen in the US) forthcoming in 2002. She currently lives in Brighton, England.
