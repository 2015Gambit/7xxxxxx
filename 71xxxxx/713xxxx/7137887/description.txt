"Hogging All the Glory"

When attention-seeking Sarah Louise 
announces her plans to run for another term 
as chairperson of the Natesville church 
group, Burt decides to run against her. To 
test Burt's ability to handle a community 
task, Sarah Louise assigns him pig-sitting 
duties for a blind church member. But when 
the guide pig accidentally becomes family 
dinner, Burt must find and train a 
replacement pig before Sarah Louise finds 
out and ruins his chances of being elected.
