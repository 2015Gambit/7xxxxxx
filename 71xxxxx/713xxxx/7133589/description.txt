Ruined Machines goes electronic. 
Quite a departure from the normal stuff. For quite some time, I've been looking to put together an electronic track somewhat in the vein of Orbital's "Halcyon + On + On". There's nothing quite like the feeling and emotion that song provides. I wanted to create my own "Halcyon", and this song was it. I put it together in February and March of 2012 and released it on March 20 on the Bandcamp page. I made the no-leads version of the track available as a free download, and the original version with a couple bonus items available for $1.
