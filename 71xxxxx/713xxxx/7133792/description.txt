I was sick of all the horrible quality rips I kept finding of this album, so I bought it, and ripped it in the most common/desirable formats.

Just select which format you want to download and skip all the rest. I will seed for a while but it definitely helps when others seed to help share it as fast as possible.

If in Vuze, go to 'File -> Open Torrent File' and select the torrent file, and then deselect the formats you do not want.

I will also be uploading "Take This To Your Grave" in V0, ALAC, FLAC, and CBR 320. I bought that one too because I couldn't find a good quality rip that didn't skip on "Homesick At Space Camp."
