beachwalkr. I am currently collating a complete collection of Dick Francis books, just trying to find the best versions of each. I expect to publish the torrent sometime this week. I have 43 books, but the metadata is a bit crappy for some of them, and others look like they were types by an infinite number of monkeys on drugs, so I am selecting the best and cleaning them up."
