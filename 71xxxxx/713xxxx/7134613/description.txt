Similar to scene release name for naming conventions sake, not a scene release. It's a pirate bay release if anything, though feel free to share it anywhere you want.

1080p Dr. Horrible. As the bay did not seem to be blessed with it already, I ordered the BD and ripped it. Seem to me most torrents of DR horrible lead to horribly made rips. Hopefully you won't find this as bad.

Format profile ended up 5.0 so there's far from any guarantee it will play on your standalone. Software players will play it back just fine with DXVA and all.

Included audio commentary track as well.

Did not de-noise video as I feel that is a decision for a director or technical director to make. Instead I've raised the bitrate (ow well it's CRF 21.5) in order to preserve the filmy grain that the source has.
