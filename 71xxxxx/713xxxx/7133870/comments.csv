,snhw1234,2012-03-26T21:04Z,"is this any better than the rest?
and is it really a TS or just another cam?"
,AriGold45,2012-03-26T23:57Z,"Can't tell from the screens alone, I'm downloading a copy of the cam and this one to compare.  I'll try to post back later"

,BigLloyd,2012-03-26T23:58Z,Thanks AriGold45
,prefix911,2012-03-27T00:34Z,Will we get the whole movie including the end credits???
,some-young-guy,2012-03-27T00:43Z,"The screens included in the description suggest that the video quality is about a 5 maybe 6 if being generous, but not 8 as the other comment suggests."
,AriGold45,2012-03-27T02:39Z,"This is the same source as the other CAMs, only this torrent has less seeders.  I don't know if it was intentionally mislabeled as a TS to get more downloads or what, but it's the same source as the other CAMs I downloaded, although it has been color corrected and touched up.  

If you want it fast, go for the CAM with the most seeders... If you want a slightly better looking copy, get this.  And even though it has been edited, the picture isn't any clearer, just tone corrected."

,Shadowym,2012-03-27T04:30Z,Good movie.  This copy is the same as the rest.  This movie doesn't have much in the way of effects so you can still enjoy a CAM without feeling like you are missing much.

,jrcurrie,2012-03-27T06:39Z,good rip. video is the same as the others but the audio is much better on this one in my opinion. thanks again tvteam 
,hotrodisgod,2012-03-27T08:05Z,@Arigold45....it has not been mislabeled.....a TS is a cam but with audio from a different source
,keallineage,2012-03-27T20:55Z,"There is a difference between a TS and CAM bootleg. 

CAM is someone hand-holding a camcorder.

A telesync (TS) is a bootleg recording in a movie theater, with a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth, with a direct connection to the sound source.  

A TS is a higher quality type than cam, with better-quality audio and video."
