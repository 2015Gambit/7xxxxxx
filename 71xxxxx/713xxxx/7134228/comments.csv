,Wuppertaler79,2012-03-27T09:10Z,Does it works on Battlenet?
,jebusfuss,2012-03-27T10:42Z,does this work on windows 7?
,nemesite,2012-03-27T11:10Z,Download and find out. Thanks for this.
,jebusfuss,2012-03-27T15:32Z,well my computer wont let me run the key gen because it keeps saying that its a virus trying to fix this and i will let you know if it runs on battle net and on windows 7
,jebusfuss,2012-03-27T15:33Z,well the key gen is for just the expansion? is there a key gen for the full game too?
,jebusfuss,2012-03-27T16:50Z,"keygen doesnt allow for battle net and i cant get it to work for windows 7 btw here's some keys for the full game (without the expansion) the keygen should work for the expansion

,jremio,2012-03-28T05:42Z,"Hi there is both keygens for the normal d2 install and the LOD expansion. From what I know its virus / trojan free, scanned it with ESET NOD32 with latest virus definitions. Probably a false positive if you get a virus / trojan notification.

Ive installed this, and playing it on VMware Workstation 8.0.2 running Windows XP (guest OS) while the whole thing runs on my win 7 (host OS)

Patched Diablo 2 LOD with 1.12a patch to make use of D2MultiRes "

,jremio,2012-03-28T05:49Z,ALL keys do not work with battlenet. I made this torrent with the intent for playing while waiting for the release of D3!
,rhkzwd,2012-04-03T05:12Z,"what do you do after installing to get this working? jremio, what crack did you use or what did you do to get around the CD requirement?"
,rai3idwolf,2012-04-03T19:11Z,"So I am mounting the playdisk with Daemontools Lite and when I click the shortcut it is asking to insert the play disk.

Did full install, no issues with CD-Key... what am I doing wrong?

Disabled my non emulated optical drives in case it was defaulting to my DVD instead of daemon. Really frustrated."
,oliray,2012-04-15T18:15Z,I am quite new to this and I don't know what to do. I tried openning the install.exe and setup.exe but it's only say to put the install cd
,ksmilof,2012-04-23T16:12Z,But I installed the disc but I need help what to do
,Exialus,2012-05-04T10:24Z,"For those asking what to do with the ""insert disk"" problem...when that pop ups just mount the iso of the disc it asks for and dont auto-run it just close that popup out and click ok on the installer"
