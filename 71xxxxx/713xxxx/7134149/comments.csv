thanks you"
,Swiftyba,2012-03-26T21:53Z,is there any way you could upload just the fall of the samurai? i think you can play just fall of the samurai without having shotgun 2
,Kalibane88,2012-03-26T21:56Z,"awsome, thank you so much!"
,macfly59,2012-03-26T21:59Z,it's multilanguage ?? 
,booobp,2012-03-26T22:13Z,Thanks. But many of us already have the first two Shogun games. Possible to get only Fall of the samurai.
,S8W7,2012-03-26T22:20Z,Thank you so much! I've been checking here every two hours since the game was released. 
,S8W7,2012-03-26T22:23Z,Thank you so much!
,volound,2012-03-26T22:26Z,"getting 20kbps despite devoting my entire bandwidth to this torrent :(

are there private trackers? been waiting days for this."
,Xees,2012-03-26T22:31Z,How the hell in 22 minutes there is 100 seeders?
,mm665,2012-03-26T22:35Z,"Dude, thank you! I've been waiting for 4 days for this game."
,hrissker,2012-03-27T00:23Z,"SEEEED PLEASE lord have mercy its extremezone and heromaster they are both trusted, i can verify rofl SEED fiber optic cable is not spossed to have 200 kb/s thats agasnt moral code. i promise you i will seed when im done.."
,hrissker,2012-03-27T00:24Z,"2 weeks and 5 days, RIGHT...OH WHY IS THE RUM GONE :( lol i hope theres more tomarow oh please god i want this game"
,iohannfus,2012-03-27T01:12Z,crash on desktop ... the crack need a fix ...
,hrissker,2012-03-27T02:34Z,"8 seeders 326 leechers, .....WOW lol thats like 4 weeks, thank god the people uploaded it but DAMN "
,volound,2012-03-27T03:13Z,"please seed when youve downloaded it. 

we are lucky to live in a world where warez is possible. sacrifice some of your bandwidth (that you probably wont even use) for the sake of the group. every mb downloaded needs to be uploaded. come on guys.

we have a seed/peer ratio of 30... dont just remove the torrent from your client when its done, come the fuck on."
,ivankralj,2012-03-27T08:46Z,which disk is fall of the samurai i only want to install it plzzz reply if i have to install all plz give my a link to a torrent with only fall of the samurai 
,S8W7,2012-03-27T09:37Z,"Downloaded and installed successfully, but the game crashes after one turn."
,booobp,2012-03-27T15:27Z,"Installs, but constant C2D. None of the cracks work."
,booobp,2012-03-27T15:34Z,Doesn't even load. Both versions seem the same so it cant be the game. Just crack.
,booobp,2012-03-27T15:51Z,"I'm on the verge of buying this, because a working crack is taking so long. Has CA managed to beat pirates?"
,Bluemartian,2012-03-27T18:35Z,Why bother uploading this if the crack doesn't work? I bet you don't like this game and for that reason you didn't even bother to boot it up and see if it works. Typical Americans.
,Reddeh,2012-03-27T22:28Z,"Typical americans?
not all of us are simply stupid,fat,and/or obnoxious
I pride myself in only being lazy
but I do not pride myself in being able to get a torrented game such as this to work
its common sense
so if you (not blue martian) cant get the crack to work

your fucking retarted i have NEVER had a crack or game by these guys that didnt work (thats why they have a skull next to their name) so its not their fault its not working
it yours"
,paulst1,2012-03-28T00:43Z,Is this working ???
,S8W7,2012-03-28T01:09Z,"Reddeh, it IS the crack. lol

No offence, but NO ONE has been able to get this to work. Yes, the game loads. Yes, you can play... for four turns, and then it crashes."
,Reddeh,2012-03-28T02:54Z,"ohgod
sorry i thought it was the usual idiocy of not following directions
this is a first a crack being 
glitchy i geuss
sorry for my bitching
hope it gets cracked soon
now, to memebase to wait"
,Reddeh,2012-03-28T02:56Z,"if only dl speed was larger than 1/2 kb a second
greedy leechers"
,booobp,2012-03-28T05:20Z,"Seems like some files are missing, such as the campaign folder. Probably why it doesn't even load."
,A-10,2012-03-28T14:26Z,"LOL 18 hours of downloading and you have this awesome game ! so stop filling the comment section white seed this seeds that, there is need of a crack fix so no need to hurry :)"
,v7DusK,2012-03-28T16:48Z,"@ A-10......
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED damn it!"
,Nounread,2012-03-29T09:33Z,they wont be able to crack this game becuase it's new atni crack code. give up and buy it of you want to play.
,S8W7,2012-03-29T14:36Z,Nonsense! 
,E-PRO11,2012-03-29T20:41Z,"Nounread- so how do you know it won't work? can you show evidence for it? do you have a link about this new development? oh, i didn't think so. why don't you not say it unless you have prove."
,anuzbitt,2012-03-29T23:09Z,"@Nounread
so funny lol i hear that about every new game... still its out on piratebay"
,E-PRO11,2012-03-30T01:30Z,"Nounread _ Really you do Nounread? cuz I've downloaded Shogun 2 by itself and it worked perfectly. Shogun 2 was an easy game to get to work. it took me like a total of 30 secs after installation. I've download many games that work recently. so, why are you acting like you know for a fact that this time it won't work? do you know something that we don't? otherwise, why the fuck are you even saying it? if you don't want to download it that fucking go buy the game. most of us will eventually any, but if not why be a negative nancy and pretend you already know it won't work. you think you're some kind of genius and you know better than us. go reprogram the fucking game yourself than. cuz I bet I would get a lot closer than you.

,Timbo6669,2012-04-05T06:09Z,NounRead reckons he works for SEGA..XD he wrote this on other torrent.. so i'm thinking he's full of it... A 12yr old kid who has rich or well off parents pretending to be holy and just... F.u.c.k.off  .. they'll crack it eventually... you do realise that the ppl they hire to protect games are usually the hackers themselves?? so equal knowledge..but i bet the skidrowdies will win..no doubt..
