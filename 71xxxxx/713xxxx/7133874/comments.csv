,rikiviki,2012-03-28T21:08Z,"well, you can't update the virus signature and keeps showing that the last update was on 08 09 2011 ?? "
,xk3nvel0x,2012-03-28T21:38Z,"@rikiviki

Dude, install ESET as a trial version... when promted restart your pc in safe mode... go to crack folder and run eset pure fix, then restart your computer and do all updates you want ;) Enjoy"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-03-28T21:45Z,"Updates work fine, i try it myself... For me work perfectly, if you have another questions post me a comment or contact me via suprbay (xk3nvel0x my nick on forum)"
,rikiviki,2012-03-29T13:34Z,"glad it work for you, but doesn't work for me. I followed you instructions, even reinstall it and again can't update the virus signature - date of the last one is now 22 09 2011.  Anyway, thanks for your effort.   "
,xk3nvel0x,2012-03-29T19:21Z,"@rikiviki 
When you try to update you recieive an error from the program or only eset don't download updates ?

PS: DO NOT UPDATE PROGRAM AFTER CRACK IS ENABLED I RECOMEND. IF YOU WANT PROGRAM UPDATE USE TRIAL FOR 30 DAYS DUDE, PROGRAMS UPDATES CAN REWRITE CRACKED FILES AND ESET WILL BE BLOCKED FOR LICENSE"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-03-29T19:22Z,Do the updates only for virus signature
,rahaal,2012-03-30T14:51Z,"Thanks xk3nvel0x

It works fine with me no problems

@rikiviki

as xk3nvel0x says, then try to activate don't write anything on the activation screen just press next and then try to update the signature.

Good luck dude"
,rikiviki,2012-03-30T16:05Z,"thank you guys. I really appreciate your help. Finally today the update of virus signature stared by itself ?? Dunno how and why ....am happy it worked. :)
thanks a bunch  xk3nvel0x. "
,xk3nvel0x,2012-03-30T22:53Z,"For all who receive virus detection at Eset PureFix Crack i notify you thats a false positive detection, some antivirus programs report file as a trojan or tool crack (like avira antivirus) don't worry its not affect your computer. Cracks are sometimes reported as a virus, but its a false positive detection. Sorry for my bad english...:P"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-03-30T22:55Z,All my torrents are secure and clean don't worry
,vonwisdom,2012-04-05T01:15Z,My Installed  ESET ate the crack
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-06T11:29Z,"@vonwisdom 

ESET detect this crack as a virus or a malicious application, don't worry cracks are sometimes detected as a virus, but they don't affect your pc, detection is a false positive. All my torrents are clean & tested. :P"
,pinochhio,2012-04-07T11:57Z,Thanks a lot....but this is older 5.0.93 version. You must upload the latest 5.0.95 version.
,puedefallar,2012-04-10T15:51Z,"when i went to the crack folder it was empty. should i download again?
i'm totally new to this.
thanks!"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-10T20:55Z,"@puedefallar

Hi, i recommend you to turn off your antivirus software, then re-download the torrent and you will find the crack, some antivirus software detect crack as a virus and remove it, but don't worry it's a false alarm, torrent is clean. "
,puedefallar,2012-04-13T04:29Z,"@xk3nvel0x 

Thanks! I was able to get the crack and run it. but still i can't update virus signatures. the link just doesn't do anything. i still hope it would do it automatically one of these days like the person above, but if you have any good ideas to try i would really appreciate it. thanks for your help"
,puedefallar,2012-04-13T04:37Z,"it just took a while, but after trying several times the update worked perfectly. thanks!!"
,xXgOrAiZeXx,2012-04-15T00:58Z,"It worked for me.

1.) Installed 
2.)Instead of trial i put the other one and left it blank and just put next.
3.)Restarted in safe mode
4.)Enabled crack and it worked. 

Question: If i update to 5.0.94.0 will the crack work?"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-15T15:55Z,"@xXgOrAiZeXx 

I said above, i don't recommend PROGRAM UPDATE, i suggest only DEFINITION UPDATE because pPROGRAM UPDATE CAN MODIFY CRACKED FILES AND IT WILL DOESN'T WORK saying INVALID LICENSE or license blocked"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-15T15:56Z,"and don't use crack for other setup version only for setup from my torrent, for other versions crack will doesn't work"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-16T15:07Z,if you want to upgrade program version you will need to use the crack again
,xXgOrAiZeXx,2012-04-17T05:57Z,"Ok thnx, if you find a crack for 0.94 or 0.95 let me knw thnx."
,telepirat,2012-04-21T18:11Z,"Thanks, installed and ran crack as instructed and it works. Only thing I'm not sure of is how to enable automatic definitions updates. Is that what they call ""program components""?"
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-21T19:37Z,definitions update its only for virus database not for program version
,ventadorn,2012-04-21T23:15Z,"Thanks dude! Works like a charm. God bless you... :-)

I really can't understand people who are complaining here... Hey, guys, what do you want?! Here is place where everyone can take some good software (which often costs a lot of money) absolutely for free... So, please, feel free to download, test etc. at your own risk, but PLEASE STOP GRUMBLE! If you have some complaints - please go to official vendors, open your wallets and that's it!
Moreover, the most of the bad comments often come from guys which really don't know what exactly are doing in front of their PC's, or what are they talking about... As one cool uploader here said: ""Reading is so simple, so please try it!"" (I mean RobbingHood)...

Anyway, cheers xk3nvel0x and thanks one more time! :D"
,telepirat,2012-04-21T23:24Z,"OK so apparently the virus signature database is updated automaticly by default, that's what it says, and you can always check manually if you want. I also had the crack quarantined by NOD32 itself, after the installation, when I tried to copy it to a USB memory stick. Solution: go to setup -> enter advanced setup -> exclusions and then add the NOD32 dowload folder and the folder you want to copy it to as exclusions, then restore the file from quarantine (tools -> quarantine). The same principal should apply when it's quarantined by some other antivirus program."

,ianjai,2012-04-25T15:17Z,empty crack folder!
,xk3nvel0x,2012-04-26T17:09Z,"@ianjai

close your antivirus prog. and re-download torrent ! :P Antivirus remove crack"
,martin971,2012-04-27T22:44Z,Works fine for me thx ;)
,rikiviki,2012-05-05T07:28Z,"well, it stooped updating the virus definition on 1th of May. Tried with the crack in safe mode again,   not working either. Any solution xk3nvel0x ??  "
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-11T22:29Z,the update works fine.... if the problem persist try to re-install it... i tested but works well no problem or error during update...
,rikiviki,2012-05-18T12:31Z," I've reinstalled it already, xk3nvel0x. Works like charm again...only I got some 'i - mark' on the icon. Could be a warning to upgrade to next version ( I know it will not work if I do that) Thanks a lot mate. cheers"
,sahil99,2012-05-19T11:06Z,Guys seed....
,rikiviki,2012-05-20T12:37Z,"@ sahil99: Dude,I've downloaded this torrent 6 times with aim to seed, but ironically, my installed  NOD32 blocks the torrent and deletes the crack over and over again. "
,xk3nvel0x,2012-05-22T16:48Z,add path to the downloaded files to exclusion list and eset will not delete the crack any more.... and now you can seed the torrent
,BigDog1337,2012-06-14T00:36Z,"K the crack doesnt work, you have to download ESET Purefix V2.02"
,techo49,2012-06-29T19:58Z,Thanks xk3nvel0x works fine no problem installing !!!
[T],TrettioSju,2012-07-01T20:26Z,"I think we can trust this uploader, but do understand what can happens IF you install something in safe.mode. Simply what-so-ever-shit can be installed whithout any complains from the antivirusprogram you NOT use in this moment, becuse you do are running in safe.mode.

I have 2 computers, 3 OS and install the crack everywhere (XP_32+XP_32+W7_64).
I found no problems (after temporary deactivate 
NOD32 so the crack not move to carantain over and over again LOL).

I did not even check what NOD32-version I got, but it seems to work because there's no text anylonger said something like 'Valid until xxxx-xx-xx'.

I don't know for how long it will work either, but I be back if any problems occour."
,xk3nvel0x,2012-07-25T13:07Z,"For all sceptics you don't need to update the crack if  you install latest version of the antivirus program, don't need to use v2.01 or whatever (like BigDog1337 says). If you want just select when you install eset ""download latest version"" and when prompted use the instruction for crack it (if needed). For all who want latest version but they have installed and enabled the crack, update it to the latest (on update tab via eset interface), and when promted if the eset will be blocked you may need to re-enable the crack or just re-install the program and select ""download latest version"" like above."
,pbntomi26,2012-08-25T14:25Z,"Works like charm, so thank you very much! But when I uninstalled the antivirus and afther that installed it back again it wouldnt work. Now I'm using the smart security so, there's nothing wrong, I just thought I mention it. But aniway, great torrent, worth downloading, and dont forget to seed! :)"
