I have downloaded & installd dis stuff bt wen i am launching it, an error msg is coming up stating:-

Could not launch Cyberlink PowerDVD.
Possible reasons:
1.Your VGA driver needs an update.
2.There is not enough VRAM in your VGA card.
3.Remote Desktop under Windows XP is not allowed.

What am I supposed to do???

My system config is:
Intel core i3 2nd gen
4GB RAM
Intel HD Graphics 3000
Windows 7 ultimate
500 GB HDD

Someone plz suggest a solution..."
