,yuioooot,2012-03-28T16:37Z,Low budget rubbish with TV-series actors. Zzz.
,Janizar,2012-03-28T19:01Z,"Crap movie. What makes it worse is that it gives a bit of hope for a great Sci-Fi flick about 40 mins into it, but it takes a dive into cheap shit instead."

I regret that i watched it, it was watchable but dissapointing cuz ur always expecting something more."
,dalle7777,2012-03-30T01:40Z,"Well agree that quality/sound is good. 
I never expected the movie to get so sick and twisted though. For a 2hour movie the first hour especially first 10-15min was actually okay/quite good I think. Last hour was just too sick for my taste. Schizophrenic and nausia took over the last hour and sick fetish sex. A shame Michael Biehn was in this movie - that guy in my oppinion belongs to better movies. 
I do however give kudos to some of the other actors (Michael Eklund in particular and Milo Ventimiglia did okay aswell) to play that sick role they actually did gr8. 
I cant however recommend this movie unless you enjoy these type of movies I just described :)"
