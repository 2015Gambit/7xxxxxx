Change Log:
----------

# Bugs fixed:
- WinRAR did not store NTFS "Compressed" attribute, when creating RAR archives.
- WinRAR crashed in command line mode if @filelist parameter was present and 'filelist' did not exist. This bug affected only WinRAR.exe, not RAR.exe.
- if -x*somefolder* exclusion mask was specified when archiving and if name of current folder contained 'somefolder', WinRAR excluded all files and stopped creating an archive.
- GUI self-extracting archives did not work in Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).
