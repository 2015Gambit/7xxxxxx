,fieldstone,2012-03-29T02:09Z,Call me retarded but i dont understand the key installation thing. I saved to the installed folder but its still the evaluation copy.
[T],3R01,2012-03-29T14:07Z,"@fieldstone, double click to Keygen, and then install license.
have fun"
,fieldstone,2012-03-31T05:47Z,"@3R01. Thanks for replying. After clicking on the keygen the only option is to ""save"" . I clicked on save and it has you browse to where you want to save.I saved to the install folder but still shows evaluation copy."
,truthspeaker,2012-03-31T08:39Z,"same problem as fieldstone.

,Gargrevar001,2012-03-31T22:20Z,"This is what I did:

First, make sure there is no rarreg.key file in the WinRar folder (show hidden files and folders)

Run keygen

Click 'Save License'

Navigate to the WinRar Directory and save it there

When successfull box pops up close it, and it's done."
,brbsoup,2012-04-06T22:57Z,"run the keygen as administrator, save the file to winrar install directory. thanks for torrent :)"
,ukdonuts,2012-04-07T17:07Z,"The keygen works as it should, just make sure the name you input is at least 10 characters long, otherwise WinRAR will remain in evaluation mode. Cheers for the upload 3R01"
,denoslack,2012-04-09T07:22Z,"No fuss, no muss; works fine. Thank you!"
,Tkk999,2012-06-09T13:53Z,"Guys when the keygen is on, "" YOUR NAME "" Should be "" More than 10 Characters"". Thats it."
