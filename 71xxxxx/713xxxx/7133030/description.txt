Värttinä have invented a unique roots-based vocal/instrumental style combining traditional Finno-Ugric vocal elements with original compositions and dynamic performance. Blending ancient Finnish runo poetry, distinctive vocal harmonies, traditional and modern acoustic instrumentation, complex rhythms and imaginative arrangements, the front line of three female singers with a band of acoustic musicians are forging their own path in contemporary music. The highlight of Värttinä's career include world tours, huge festival shows, top selling albums and collaborating with Indian composer A.R. Rahman on writing the score and performing live in Toronto and London's West End for the stage adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. (musicrow.se)
