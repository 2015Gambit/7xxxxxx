,midurix,2012-03-30T12:21Z,"For some reason this is the only video file my Samsung tv won't play properly, I get audio drops every 5-20 second for maybe half a second at a time. So I end up missing out words. Very weird considering that the TV will play absolutely everything else I throw at it and I have owned it for just over a year and nothing else has failed to play absolutely flawlessly. This only happens with this torrent and Family Guy also LOL."
