Just Planes (World Air Routes) - SN Brussels Airlines - A330-300




SN Brussels Airlines was created in 2001 to replace defunct carrier Sabena. The airline operates a fleet of Avro RJ aircraft and Airbus A319s on European routes.


This program focuses on the airline's African operation which is serviced with a fleet of Airbus A330-300s operated by Birdy Airlines.


The dvd takes you on 2 round trip flights from Brussels to Africa. First we fly to Sierra Leone and the Ivory Coast, later we visit Senegal and Gambia. During the flights you will get a presentation of the cockpit, you will also follow the pre-departure briefings, get route information, follow the arrival briefings, aircraft walkaround and hear communications with Air Traffic Control including "blind transmissions" over Africa and last, but not least, a detailed cabin presentation and look at the excellent inflight service provided by SN.
