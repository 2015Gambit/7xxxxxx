,iEslam,2012-03-31T08:36Z,can anyone verify this torrent?
,leroytcw,2012-03-31T09:54Z,"I'd verify it, but since its going to take 24 plus hours... it might not be legit"
,D4rkSp4wn,2012-03-31T13:12Z,"It is legit, check this thread use google chrome coz the tread is in portuguese."

,leroytcw,2012-03-31T19:34Z,This torrent doesnt work. When you tru to run the setup windows explorer crashes and nothing happens...
,D4rkSp4wn,2012-04-01T06:13Z,"This torrent works, if you windows explorer is crashing its why ur system is fucked up, mount the iso, run the setup.exe as administrator wait, play

dont be such asshole telling people thats dont work if u dont even know hoe to use ur operational system"
,leroytcw,2012-04-01T06:39Z,"D4rkSp4wn After you mount it and click setup, it takes 30 mins for the installer to actually start. Then when it finishes the game crashes in the menu screen after about 30 seconds... so dont give me that crap"
,Lestat57,2012-04-01T13:05Z,"Works like it should. All dlc's, music, everything is there and working.
Installation took over 1 hour but meh. No crashes whatsoever.

One little thing - voice commands are in spain or whatever it is, is there some way to change it back to eng?"
,changedmyself,2012-04-01T13:20Z,"Thanx!! at last updated and Great torrent
100% works"
,D4rkSp4wn,2012-04-01T18:10Z,"@leroytcw it takes 30 minutes to start the setup.exe coz u have the UAC enabled on windows, disable the windows lame """"User Account Control"" and run the setup.exe as administrator."
,D4rkSp4wn,2012-04-01T18:12Z,"@Lestat57 Go to extras menu and disable the Prophet vocalizer menu or 0800 vocalizer menu and it should go back to english, have fun"
,FarStryder,2012-04-02T11:37Z,Setup started up fine enough but the game won't start. Gives me some kinda exception error every time I try. My OS is WinXp so no hassles about UAC there. =(
,D4rkSp4wn,2012-04-03T01:59Z,"FarStryder, the setup takes 2gb of ram to install the game bro, make sure to install it in a short path like C:Games, also make sure that the steam is not running when u try to play, make a shortcut to desktop for the left4dead2.exe and put these launch parameters -steam -novid"
,dzcrossfirex,2012-04-06T07:28Z,"this works flawlessly. registered an account just to write this comment. online games available too (i think). you guys are certainly l4dead elite. downloaded just to try and make sure i wont waste money buying stupid games. this game is real fun and im gonna buy it. 1000 thanks

p/s: i dont have hamachi, tunngle or garena installed but i still see matches on steam server on this game. is that cracked server or what? can i really play online? sorry for noob question, im curious about the system"
,D4rkSp4wn,2012-04-07T07:46Z,"yes Cracked servers, i dont recommend u buy the original game coz there are only noobs on steam to play online just click the server and join, if u receive a vac plugins bla bla bla message just create a shortcut to left4dead2.exe on desktop and add the parameter -steam  , then you should be able to play on cracked servers , cheers and please help me seed."

,asspoop,2012-04-17T05:11Z,"It installed fine but when I try to run it it fails immediately. The windows report says it is caused by the file steamclient.dll when I remove this it still doesn't work.

Thankx! It worked, it was problem with my drivers or something, I was running it in windows 8, guess that's not a terribly wise idea after all :-P.
Also, my angry birds wouldn't start. I formatted with windows 7 yesterdays, installed it, ran like a charm! Flawless!

ps: my angry birds started working too.. :P

Kudos! Respect! Peace! Love!"
,LooneyTunesXtreme,2012-05-08T12:12Z,"@aaryan0077 w8? did you know that up to now there are no compatible applications/games with it? Hell yeah, it's not a wise idea. Good thing you came back to your senses. w7 and lower OS (especially wXP) will run L4D2 or angry birds flawlessly. BTW, you sure it works? Really sure? Thanks."
,LooneyTunesXtreme,2012-05-10T16:47Z,WORKS GREAT ON WINDOWS 7!!! Thanks D4rkSp4wn :) I finally found the Left 4 Dead 2 that actually works.
,aaryan0077,2012-05-15T10:47Z,"@LooneyTunesXtremee

Yeah man, download it without any second thoughts. It works like charm, though graphics are horrible, and that's because I have this cheap ass pc without any graphic card, the only reason game even started in first place is that my motherboard supports pixel shader 4.0, guess I just have to settle for angry birds now (it runs flawlessly!) till I buy a expensive ass pc with a expensive ass graphic card...

But again like I said, there is no problem with the game (thought it take a quite some time to install, took about more then 1 hr in my pc!)"

then one day, ALL 4 of us could not access L4D2,
after entering the game, it sends us an error message saying L4D2 has stopped working, right after a few moments at the starting loading screen.
so i cross checked with some of my other friends,
some had the crash, some didnt,
BUT THIS ALL HAPPEND at the same time.
so i tried a number of solutions.
reinstalling the game
restarting my computer
checking for updates at your site.
(BTW the link in the forum doesnt display for some odd reason.)
ive reached my wits end, could you PLEASE help us? were really grateful to teamcrossfire to have been able to play L4D2 for free, but the crashing is ruining our fun..."
