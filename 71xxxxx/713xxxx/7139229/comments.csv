,zeeeQ,2012-03-29T05:20Z,"Can an admin remove NLUPPER's VIP, he keeps posting cams and shit quality rips in the DVDR section."
,BEupper,2012-03-29T14:44Z,"dvdr isn't a dvdrip 
dvdr is the format all dvd players support
if you are searching for a dvdrip then type dvdrip
think twice before you say something"

,Raepic,2012-03-30T22:04Z,Im so lookin forward to this movie! But the quality is baad right? And so becomes the movie.. poor quality equals bad movie
,somesomeguy,2012-03-31T16:26Z,"DON'T BOTHER

I made this account to comment since so many valid commenters have helped me in the past-

this is video taped from theater, I'd say bad but I have nothing to compare it to

the subs are put on after so the off center retaping is more obvious

the files are several .VOB files which I imagine would be annoying if I could stand to watch in the first place

HTH, thanks to all valid informative commenters!"
[H],Eppo,2012-04-01T12:21Z,"@zeeeQ
he will not. The uploads are legit, he just uploads TS2DVD (easy to burn on DVD), just read the title. :)"
,Dominicjuh,2012-04-01T19:28Z,"DON`T DOWNLOAD, No sound."
,Kikula,2012-05-02T22:27Z,Shit.
,Chrissa87,2012-05-13T23:09Z,WHY DO YOU HARDCODE THE SUBS?? WHYYYYY? ITS SO IRRITATING FOR EVERYONE ELSE THAT DONT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE!! PLIS STOP IT! 
,d1rty7,2012-05-14T01:00Z,"@ gismopjes

,Qwert100810,2012-05-28T09:53Z,yeah right !! it's a crap... amp
,SeeD419,2012-06-09T19:18Z,"A bunch of comments saying it's shit and all dead links on the screens.

Yeah...I'll pass."
,zombiekiller123,2012-06-13T20:09Z,lol wow i go with the ppls vote!
,Tmiller333,2012-06-16T02:13Z,"How the admins allow nulpper and froggies shit to continually be uploaded in improper categories is beyond me, i can only imagine what their house looks like. To make the majority of the pirate bay users sift through the junk mail deserves them a swift kick in the nuts. Iv done my part by suggesting a cam section, the rest of u should do the same.. through the proper channel of course (although i suspect they hardly take notice of it)"
,cheeseonline,2012-06-17T04:43Z,its fake!!! cam copy
,cubstudios,2012-06-21T15:41Z,Just another cinema cam made to look like a DVD with annoying Danish subtitles. Wait for a proper DVD to come out.
,haotiay,2012-06-24T06:43Z,Thank you very much...i download the film for an invalid men..
,dmass71,2012-07-03T02:08Z,"I apppreciate the work you do, downloaded fine, i have have a question what is best software to change to ISO and/or what is best software to burn to dvd. thank you"
,Boltik,2012-07-09T05:43Z,"wow so many haters. read the title ffs its clearly marked as TS not a dvd rip. uploader has simply saved everyone the hassle of re-encoding to burn to dvd. 
Put up or Shut up people!"
,dukkeman1,2012-07-11T18:52Z,"Hey i'm having problems downloading the torrent. It tells me that i need to upgrade the torrent client, so i tried downloading it all over and i've also tried other torrent clients but it still doesn't work. Anyone know what to do?"
,JustJinxed,2012-07-12T06:22Z,"I think people are just peeved cause it's a 4.19 gig download for a crap quality that could have been 600 megs. Not to mention if you're going to go through the trouble of DVDing something, you should probably NOT hardcode subs. (But I think that's what Ts2DVD does when you tell it to add a sub file, correct me if I'm wrong)

I keep seeing ""who cares"" well obviously the people who took the time to comment. But ya, DVDR just tells you what format it is in people. It's not getting moved just because the quality doesn't fit your expectations. Obviously it hasn't been released to DVD so you know it's quality is going to be less than perfect. Quit being noobs :P "
,ControlTheRoom,2012-07-18T06:38Z,"The Hunger Games will be available on DVD & BlueRay on AUGUST 18, 2012 in the United States. Should see some better links around that time I would think :)"

,shownin1,2012-07-26T14:28Z,"totally crap, i can't believe i wasted my 4 gb on this shit.. WTF  vip hannnn...???"
,Crazy-Nish69er,2012-08-02T04:43Z,I'll pass 2....but don't give up keep it up...later
,sm1ff,2012-08-02T05:15Z,"do us all a favor and never ever release cam or ts, or even dvd again, they are not worth downloads, only 1080p is worth it atm, and still waiting for some movies for a 1080p version like the raid!!"
,nimagiga,2012-08-04T16:22Z,i saw 1 which is small size..but this 1 i think its craft..use your brain dude..
