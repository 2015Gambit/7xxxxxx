Nearly three years since announcing their arrival with debut mini album, ΓÇÿForward MarchΓÇÖ and a series of shows that saw Uncut declare the band ΓÇÿGodΓÇÖs own orchestraΓÇÖ and NME go goggle eyed at their ΓÇÿapocalyptic preachingΓÇÖ The Strange Death Of Liberal England return with their full length debut album, ΓÇÿDrown Your Heart AgainΓÇÖ.

Recorded with producer Dave Allen (The Cure, Depeche Mode) at the helm after he tracked down the band and with a crew including the massed brass, strings and percussion of The Richard P Horne Youth Orchestra at The Old BlacksmithΓÇÖs Studio in Portsmouth, ΓÇÿDrown Your Heart AgainΓÇÖ is an album lyrically steeped in the coastal environment from which it sprung, musically shot through with elements of mariachi brass, military drums, sweeping strings, punching brass and psychedelic echoes. It is a full return on the early promise many identified on ΓÇÿForward MarchΓÇÖ, intelligent, experimental, but, at heart, a pop record.

ΓÇÿDrown Your Heart AgainΓÇÖ is the product of the eighteen months following last single, ΓÇÿAngelouΓÇÖ that saw the band remove themselves from public view. With the benefit of experience from their first taste of band life and a unified decision to ΓÇÿnot take the long way roundΓÇÖ in the words of lead singer and lyricist Adam Woolway the album was crystallised by the bandΓÇÖs one public performance in that time, a sold out, fully seated, orchestral show with The Richard P Horne Youth Orchestra at PortsmouthΓÇÖs New Theatre Royal that set the tone and bar for the album sessions.

To call the album a labour of love would not be amiss. The studio gave free time, Dave Allen lived in a camper van outside it for the duration of the sessions (that later was used in a car-bombing at a Nissan garage in High Wycombe but thatΓÇÖs another story), the orchestra gave their time for free, making ΓÇÿDrown Your Heart AgainΓÇÖ the product of a community.

The Strange Death Of Liberal England are Adam Woolway (vocals / guitar), William Charlton (guitars), Andrew Wright (glockenspiel / keys / percussion), Kelly Jones (bass guitars), David Lindsay (drums).
