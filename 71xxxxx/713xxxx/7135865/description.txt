Information
------------------------------

Austin travels to South Africa in search of leopards. Feared as man-eaters, these deadly hunters are so elusive that few people ever even manage to spot one. But Austin is determined to find a mother and her cubs, and come home with a rare family portrait.

After stocking up on supplies at a village shop, Austin heads to the spectacular savannah at the country's eastern edge. Tracking leopards on foot is highly dangerous, so Austin conducts his preliminary searches from his truck. But after staking out a popular leopard haunt and catching a few brief glimpses, Austin decides to head out into leopard country alone and on foot.

When he eventually finds fresh leopard prints and a half-eaten kill hidden high up in a tree, he knows he's hot on the trail of leopards. But can he get close enough to get his photographs? And will he get out alive?

Also in this episode, Austin encounters numerous savannah animals including a herd of deadly buffalo, giraffe, elephants, a rare wild dog pack nursing their pups, a thick-tailed scorpion, a boomslang tree snake, and an agile and venomous tiger snake.
