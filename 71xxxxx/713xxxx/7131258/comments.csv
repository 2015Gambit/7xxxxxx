I would recommend using tags - otherwise it's impossible to find when searching.

Sorry about double posting."
,TxJag,2012-03-28T16:13Z,Yeah I probably should have my apologies.
,1ndnjman,2012-04-03T05:58Z,I've been waiting forever for these books to come up on here! thanks! Long shot...but do you happen to have Crusader by Edward Bloor or know someone who does have it?
,TxJag,2012-04-04T16:28Z,"@1ndnjman Yeah, it'll be a long shot cause any books that I have are ones I've gotten from downloading as well. I bought these books though but Ill look around to see what I can find."
