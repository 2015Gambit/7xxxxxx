Remember the old Avance Logic ALS 4000 sound cards? I have quite a few of them from salvaged machines.The hunt for the driver was a bitch since all the sites that supposed to have it was instead pushing a spyware driver updater program.I found the driver itself and posting it here for your use. It will work under Windows 7 in compatibility mode.The driver is normally for Win 9x and XP
