,ccal,2012-03-26T21:35Z,"Why is it that I CAN'T download anything from thepiratebay any more?

Instead of ""download this torrent"" it appears ""get this torrent"", and I click, I click... and nothing happens. It's my all time computed and others seem to be able of download it... wth is happening?"
,harmscc,2012-03-26T22:06Z,"Read what it says below ""GET THIS TORRENT""

PB went to Magnet links only, you can figure it out. "
,ywr989,2012-03-27T14:37Z,"click ""get this torrent"". it will ask to launch the application. click OK. than another pop box will appear. give it the destination where u want to keep it. i.e. d:/desktop and press ok. dont worry if downloading is not started in torrent. it will automatically start after maximum 5 - 7 sec."
,ywr989,2012-03-27T14:39Z,"@ccal same happens with me but you should really check the solution that i discovered.. :p
and nothing happens i have upgraded utorrent but still magnetic link is disappeared!"
,NaXm,2012-03-27T14:50Z,"Thanks!

ccal:
You could just right click on ""GET THIS TORRENT"" and copy the link adress.

Âľtorrent: Ctrl+U and paste the URL
Vuze: Ctrl+O Add An Adress or whatever it says (i'm using another Language so i'm not 100% sure)"
