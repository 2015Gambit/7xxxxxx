Today kicks off three straight days of oral arguments before the Supreme Court over the constitutionality of Obamacare. If the court ends up siding with the right-wing state Attorneys General who are in the pocket of the for-profit health insurance industry, then 50 million Americans will lose access to healthcare.
 
Not to mention - 17 million children will be denied insurance coverage because of pre-existing conditions - and more than 100 million Americans will have to live in fear that their insurance company will cap them just when they need a life-saving procedure. While Obamacare isn't perfect - and our nation should eventually adopt a single-payer system that makes health care a basic human right like in the rest of the developed world - the law is at least a start.
 
So now all eyes are on the Supreme Court and whether five unelected right-wing judges will put politics and corporate profits above the health of the nation.
