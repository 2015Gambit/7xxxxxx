Gigantic VST pack with everything you will ever need.
Compressors, equalizers, limiters, or crazy effects...

A big part of the VSTs released since 2005 are there... If you can't produce decent mix with that you can't produce decent mix at all.

There are vst 2 and vst 3, but also x32/ x64 plugs.
There are also freewares.


Note: I am aware that there might be trojans in some release group keygens; free to you to scan and remove the faulty ones but then good luck to find a working one...
I would be pleased if you told me every not working piece of software in the comms.
