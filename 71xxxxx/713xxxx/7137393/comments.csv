,daikatah,2012-03-28T00:30Z,Hmmm I don't know why but every single file under 350 kb (roughly) doesn't seem to be found by utorrent... Help anyone?
,daikatah,2012-03-28T11:39Z,"SO I made this torrent with all the files on my computer but utorrent doesn't seem to find the files...

This is very strange: when I right click on files that show ""undownloaded"" and go to ""Open reception folder"", the files are right here... What to do please? Because I'd like to be shown as a seeder..."
