Start your apps or call your best friends - but with style!
This widget will help you to start your prefered apps or call your best friends - but with style!
You can add some frequently used apps, contacts or bookmarks to this launcher and start those apps, contacts or bookmarks with one click from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line. Use the included launcher icons, load your own image or use a icon from any icon pack (CircleLauncher icon packs and ADW launcher icon packs supported). If you slide over the icons, they are animated a little bit mac-like ... just try it!
Additional features in the full version:
- custom icons for the icon on the homescreen
- support for ADW icon packs for the icon on the homescreen
- vertical and horizontal launcher versions
Some icons in the screenshots are from 'CircleLauncher IconPack One' and the wallpaper is 'wp clock full'.
