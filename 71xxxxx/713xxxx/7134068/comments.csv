,XZeppoCoreX,2012-05-11T17:51Z,"It's like the 90th time I hear the album and i'm still in love with the sound. Awesome job, man and love the parts where you use that sound (like in 2:40 of Demolish to Rebuild).  Thanks a lot for letting people from the other corner (Argentina for example) download and aknowledge your music. =)"
