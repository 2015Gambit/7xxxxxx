Surveillance Culture' is the sixth studio album by Swedish
electro punk powerhouse The Pain Machinery. It's also their most  
daring and confident LP yet, combining retrofuturistic            
electronics, crisp danceable beats and assertive vocals that are  
more upfront than ever before.
'Surveillance Culture' is the first TPM album on the new          
Complete Control Productions label: "It's fantastic to finally    
be able to work with like-minded people and we have a lot of      
promising things up our sleeves. We're heavily involved with the  
label and it's definitely a long term commitment on our part.     
Watch out for lots more mayhem later in 2011!"

Having experimented with samplers, synths and drum machines       
since the late 1980's, Anders Karlsson released his first work    
as The Pain Machinery in 1992. The initial idea was to mix the    
raw energy of UK street punk and the sound exploring              
possibilities of electro/industrial music. Later joined by        
vocalist Jonas Hedberg, The Pain Machinery has continued to       
expand on their original formula through the years. The band,     
frequently described as the missing link between punk, house and  
Electronic Body Music, has gained a lasting reputation for their
intense and physical live shows around Europe.
