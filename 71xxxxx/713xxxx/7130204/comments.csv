This is brilliant.

Whilst you are finding the classic crime books can you find the books by Ngaio Marsh and Dornford Yates?

Thank you very much indeed.

Have you heard of the author Joyce Porter?  Her books are supposed to be similar to Simon Brett's Mrs Pargeter books which I love.  Can you find any of her books?

Regards.

Thank you very much for all your books. I can't believe the amount of classic mysteries you have.
Are you able to get Elizabeth Peters - Amelia Peabody series?
Thank you again for your help"
