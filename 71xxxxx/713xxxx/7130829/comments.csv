,CookieMunzta,2012-03-26T02:55Z,"For some reason whenever I start this up, I get past the Ubisoft logo, and then I hit a black screen. The game's still 'running' under processes, so it hasn't frozen.
I've installed the game via your unpacker, and tried manually unpacking it myself.

And help around this would be much appreciated, thanks."
