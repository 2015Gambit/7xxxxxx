ABC - Big Ideas, March 19 2012: Alain de Botton on Religion for Atheists

Philosopher Alain de Botton gets a huge welcome at The Wheeler Centre talking about 'Religion for Atheists', his latest book. He seems to have a great ability to connect with his audience whether heΓÇÖs talking about status anxiety, philosophy, travel, happiness or how Proust can change your life.

His critics deride his attempts to make complex ideas more accessible and entertaining to his readers but there was no evidence at this event, that this audience felt patronised in any way.

He declares his atheism from the outside and his firm belief that ΓÇ£there is no godΓÇ¥ and goes on to talk about being ΓÇÿfully humanΓÇ¥ and being able to ΓÇ£lead a good lifeΓÇ¥ outside of any formal religious structure. He has strong praise for the many formal aspects of religion and suggests these can be extracted , ΓÇ£picked and mixedΓÇ¥ and applied to aspects of art, culture and education.

He sits, he says at the softer end of atheism; heΓÇÖs no ΓÇ£hard core atheistΓÇ¥ like his friend from North Oxford, Richard Dawkins.
