In my "2012 - The Year In Christian Music (Bundle 08 of 08)" thread, sicanddisturbed posted, "Do you have the new TobyMac Dubbed & Freq'd: a remix project? I would love it if you could upload that and all his stuff if you have it."  So I'm bundling together that new 2012 release, along with everything else I have from TobyMac for sicanddisturbed, and all of the rest of you TobyMac fans out there.
