Jessica Hynes (Doctor Who, Twenty Twelve) and Douglas Hodge (Robin Hood, Mansfield Park, Unforgiven) star in a tense and compelling new four-part drama by Paul Smith for BBC One made by BBC Drama Production.

Set over one blisteringly hot summer's night when nerves are frayed and tensions ride high, One Night is the story of four ordinary people whose fates are linked by a seemingly inconsequential event.  In each episode the events of the night are re-told from a different character's point of view asking the question: how well do we really know each other?

Hilary Salmon, BBC executive producer, says: ""Paul Smith's raw and funny scripts look in intricate detail at four real lives within an ambitious and original framework. We watch with growing empathy and alarm as each of the four characters tries to do the right thing for themselves and their families but is scuppered by misunderstanding and misperception.""

Episode One opens with Ted's (Douglas Hodge) story. After years of hard work, Ted's future looks uncertain. It is crucial the barbecue he is throwing for his boss, Kenny, is a big success! When an abusive teenager from the nearby estate refuses to pick up the litter dropped outside Ted's house, he decides to take action â&#x20AC;&#x201C; but little does he know how the ripples of his decision will change his life and those of the other characters forever.

In Episode Two, the story centres on Rochelle (Georgina Campbell) the seemingly rebellious teenager from Ted's story â&#x20AC;&#x201C; but will Rochelle's bright academic future be in jeopardy because of Ted's actions?

Episode Three focuses on Carol (Jessica Hynes), Rochelle's mum. Carol has to contend with three kids and a job she dislikes. She also harbours an ambition to have her own on-stage career. But when her eldest son, Jake (Joshua Osei), tells her the police are looking for him, will she defend him or hand him over?

Finally, Billy Matthews plays 12-year-old Alfie in the final episode. A few hours short of his 13th birthday, after an evening out with his mates, a rite-of-passage event forces him to make the most grown-up decision of his young life.

Cast list also includes Saskia Reeves (Luther, Canoe Man) as Sally, Ted's long-suffering wife.

A BBC co-production with Masterpiece on PBS for BBC One, One Night is written by Paul Smith whose credits include Desperadoes and two of BBC One's acclaimed Afternoon Plays. The producer is Ewan Marshall (Every Time You Look At Me and Desperadoes); the director is David Evans (Whitechapel, Unforgiven) and executive producers are Hilary Salmon for the BBC, whose award-winning dramas include Criminal Justice, Five Days and House Of Saddam, and Rebecca Eaton for Masterpiece.

One Night was commissioned by Danny Cohen, Controller, BBC One, and Ben Stephenson, Controller, BBC Drama Commissioning. "
