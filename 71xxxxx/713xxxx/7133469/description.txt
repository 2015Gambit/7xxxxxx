The second RM full-length album. 
One year after The Grasping Hands of Possibility, the second RM full-length comes out to play. Infinitely more raw and riff-heavy than its predecessor, and using familiar motifs and thought patterns, this album trades in outer space for underground. Made available for free download on July 8th, 2008 and put on iTunes shortly after, it was also printed up on CD (approx. 150 copies) and continues to be sold today with a limited edition art print by Michal Brodka.
