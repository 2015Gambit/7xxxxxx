Narratives:

Three months into the year 2012, thereΓÇÖs already a sleeper in the oversaturated hip hop market. Planet AsiaΓÇÖs Black Belt Theatre with its inspired 70ΓÇÖs kung fu flicks hits you in the face like a swift kick from Jim Kelly in Black Belt Jones with the opening track ΓÇ£Lost And Found.ΓÇ¥  

At 35, Fresno, CaliΓÇÖs Agent P.A. is still going strong on BBT. Standout tracks that deserve the repeat button are ΓÇ£Fuck RappersΓÇ¥ (featuring Willie the Kid and Fashawn), the love ballad ΓÇ£FurnitureΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Bruce Lee.ΓÇ¥  With guest appearances from Talib Kweli, Raekwon, Ras Kass, Asia reminds us that he is still lyrically sharp and makes sure that he is not outshined on the albums guest tracks.

Although BBT is lyrically and musically on point, it does have a few negatives.  With 20 tracks on BBT, some songs just seemed like filler. Tracks such as ΓÇ£Diamond LifeΓÇ¥ (featuring Camp Lo), and ΓÇ£The Line of FireΓÇ¥ couldΓÇÖve been left out.  Overall, Black Belt Theatre is so far one of the best albums to come out this year. Fans of boom-bap and hip hop during the 90ΓÇÖs will sure love this album.  Most of the production provided by Dirtydiggs, Khrysis and Oh No hold this effort down.  The overall sound does give the listener a nostalgic feeling, which is welcomed and appreciated.
