,Cavaletta,2012-03-27T16:27Z,Could you possibly upload a 320 rip of Between the Heart and Synapse by The Receiving End of Sirens? I've been looking all over for a good copy and all I can find are 192 or lower.
,rusted-embrace,2012-03-27T20:26Z,thx alot. could you get the new black breath album?
,MastaGlenn,2012-03-29T20:57Z,"Thanks! Digging the bonus tracks on this.
Would it be possible to request the new e.p. from I, The Mighty called Karma Never Sleeps?
It's another difficult to find anywhere one, but a great album.

,leracos,2012-03-30T10:06Z,"Request confirmation of track listing. Official data shows the following track listing for the album proper, but no data for the Deluxe Edition has popped up yet. Since the track names don't match, I wondered. Track listing from official sources is as follows:

1 	I Come Alive
2 	This Fire
3 	Hands and Faces
4 	Put Me Out
5 	Shine
6 	Now That You're Dead
7 	Give Me Love
8 	Moving On
9 	Getting Over You
10 	Kiss It Goodbye
11 	Kinda Hectic (Interlude)
12 	Hurt No One
13 	Together Burning Bright"
,leracos,2012-03-30T10:10Z,"Small correction - track 11 should be entitled ""Hurt No One""

Otherwise great release, thanks!"

Great torrent, great quality!!
I just wish the album was better.  There are only 3 songs in this whole album that are actually good to listen to.  The rest is just crap.  What the Hell happened to The Used.  There last album was amazing.  Then when you think that there next one will be better.  It all goes to SHIT!!!!"
