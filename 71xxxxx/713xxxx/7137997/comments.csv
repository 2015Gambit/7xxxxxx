,Dimmis80,2012-03-28T10:21Z,Hey mate.What about Tuesdays episode are u gonna upload it today.?
,disnfab,2012-03-28T13:32Z,"Thanks again jmanwf!

Please be patient Dimmis80, we get free episodes but not the uploader he/she? gets his/her episodes from iTunes. I'm sure it will be uploaded soon enough, just be thankful we get DooL here for free and wait like everybody else."
,Dimmis80,2012-03-29T06:43Z,@disnfab first of all u don't know me so u can't tell that i am not patient.!!Believe i am very very patient.And i just make a simple question.!And i am very thankful and grateful and i have told @jmanwf a lot of times.And i think @jmanwf if he/she wants can talk on his/her self.And i don't think that u are his/her lawyer or his/her consulting or something.So mind your own busines and don't tell me that i can't just make a simple question.!In PB u can tell whatever u want.!Capish.!
,SoWErA3,2012-03-29T18:09Z,"Sorry Dimmis80 but you seem rude to me, I agree with disnfab especially since we know that Itunes ain't exactly fast with uploading new releases all the time of each show ;(

I really appreciate you jmanwf for all your hard work I hope you keep it up and ignore some of us who ain't appreciating you as much or as good at expressing themselfs in a good manner ;)"
