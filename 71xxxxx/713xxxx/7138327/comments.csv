,Odin1066,2012-03-28T14:33Z,Thanks! Great films you've made available. Gun Crazy is awesome for its time. Any chance you may have Hell's Angels 1930. The largest file of it is 1.22GB and its picture isn't very good.

There's a DVD9 ( 7.69 GB) on BitSnoop with Eng Sub / Eng Audio.

You'll find it If you type in this words in the searchbox .... : 
""Angeli ada""

Maybe I can do another suggestion: you don't happen to have William Wyler's The heiress with Montgomery Cliff.
I can't find it on dvd where I live."
,Odin1066,2012-03-29T20:26Z,Thanks Agentbay I found it and it is downloading right now. VLC plays ISO files and it can record anything it is playing. I'm not sure though IF the recording may not be as good as what you would have burning the ISO.
,WHIPCRACKER,2012-03-30T15:31Z,Odin1066---you can unpack an .iso file with 7zip or winrar to a VideoTS file and burn it with CloneDVD. That way if there is anything you don't need---you can remove it for fitting a smaller space.
