,now192002,2012-03-26T01:28Z,"For a Cam, the video is VERY good, the audio, however, is something to be desired. In terms of cam v8/a5"
,Gavrill,2012-03-27T01:35Z,"Okay did anyone else have this problem? i burned this copy to disc. Like everything worked fine.. but once on disc, my audio would NOT work. :S Like help?"
,zx6rider,2012-03-28T04:52Z,There is an audio watermark called cinveia in most new movies in the theaters . This cannot be removed and will disable the playing or sound in most of the new generation DVD/blu-ray players and the Sony PS3 . This may not work in your conventional players so you may need to stream via another media box or play from your computer .  Ido not believe the x-box 360 have the cinveia protection and it may work fine in that box.

V = 8
A = 5 or 6"
,imojack,2012-06-07T11:00Z,Watchable. Audio is a bit loud but still understandable. Good job
