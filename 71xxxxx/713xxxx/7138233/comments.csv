,grotesco1,2012-03-29T15:21Z,"This movie is completely horrible. The story is really bad. Movies with airplanes are not new, and this movie do not bring anything new or special. All the same, with bad actors and bad production. It is far from be realistic. Somethings is very annoying and makes no sense. Any person with sense about physics and sense knows that these things no make sense. This is not a fiction movie, so should not bring these kind of things. The special effects are terrible! 
Explosions, smokes, atmosphere, etc are completely ridiculous"
