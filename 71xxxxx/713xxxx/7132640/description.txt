The nation of Panem has risen out of the war, disaster and the ravaged ruins of what was once known as North America. 74 years ago, the thirteen poverty-stricken districts of Panem rebelled against the wealthy, controlling Capitol. After its crushing victory, the Capitol devised the Hunger Games as an annual reminder to the twelve remaining districts of its authority, and as continuing punishment for the rebellion. Every year, each District must hold a raffle (known as the "reaping") to choose one boy and one girl (ranging from age 12ΓÇô18) to participate in the Hunger Games, a competition in which each of the twenty-four contestants (known as the "tributes") fight to the death in a televised arena until only one is left alive.
 
In District 12, an impoverished but coal-rich region of Panem, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) cares for her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her sister Primrose "Prim" (Willow Shields), since her father died in a mining accident. Katniss often hunts illegally outside the boundary fences of District 12 with her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth). She uses traps, snares, and a bow-and-arrow to kill her prey for food and trade with other residents.
 
Prim, now age 12, has her name placed in the reaping for the first time and despite the odds, it is drawn. Katniss volunteers as tribute to replace her sister in the Hunger Games. She competes against other tributes, including a baker's son named Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the male tribute from District 12.
