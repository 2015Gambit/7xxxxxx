,t-townjuggalo,2012-03-27T03:28Z,like this one
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-27T03:58Z,Not sure everything looks ok.  Could be not enough seeders & my bandwith is being eaten up on other downloads.  If you like hit me up with your email & i can piece the album to ya.
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-27T04:00Z,or maybe just try again a little later.  The new E-40 has my bandwith on lockdown.
