Propellerheads ReCycle.v2.0


ReCycle is a creative tool that helps you make the most of your grooves. In simple terms, ReCycle lets you do with sampled loops what you can do with beats programmed from individual drum sounds ΓÇô like alter the tempo, or replace sounds and process them individually. A tool for quickly editing sampled parts, chopping up riffs, remixing and doing mash ups.

How is it done? ReCycle will analyze your groove and break it up into its rhythmic components. You are now in complete control and free to change the tempo or the pitch, without one affecting the other. And that's just scratching the surface.

Then what? Load the resulting REX2 file into your audio sequencer or software sampler and you can be the master of your grooves, once and for all.


If you like it, buy it.
