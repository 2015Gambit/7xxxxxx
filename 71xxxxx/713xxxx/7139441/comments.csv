,Altaraz,2012-04-04T22:04Z,"Yes, yes you're right I'm sorry about that. I don't know what I was thinking putting these movies under HD category (I guess it was a late night, I was tired...) I'll see if I can fix the category thing."
,Altaraz,2012-04-09T03:05Z,"PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A HIGHRES MOVIE - IT IS A HIGH-QUALITY DVD-RIP. AS SOON AS I FIGURE OUT HOW TO MODIFY MY TORRENTS, I'LL PLACE IT IN THE CORRECT CATEGORY. I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE."
