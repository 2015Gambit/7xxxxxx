Converted to mp4/m4v for Apple TV 2 and other compliant players by using Handbrake with an ATV2 preset. (1280 × 720)

This was converted from the ultra-fine up by JrDickie (*many thanks) of the BluRay rip of this concert. Since I play my videos on an Apple TV and an iPad I thought I'd simply share my conversion to save others the trouble.
