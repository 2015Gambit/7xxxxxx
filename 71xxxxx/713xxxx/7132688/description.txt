To all players who worry about process left in the memory after they quit the game - the game contains in-app purchases and this background service is common for all such applications. It just stands in background and listens to potential changes of in-app purchases status from Google servers, doesn't use any processor resources. It's being created and maintained by the system and we are not able to shutdown it after the game is closed.
