Can't Stop the Music [1980] VHS Rip

In this pseudo audio biography of the Village People, Jack Morell (a thinly disguised character of the group's founder Jacques Morali) is a struggling composer desperate to gain fame with his songs, but all he needs is a group to sing them. With the help of his roommate Samantha and a lawyer named Ron, Jack forms a group of six "macho men" from his Greenwich Village neighborhood and the rest of the film details their rise to fame from New York City to a climatic concert in San Francisco.
