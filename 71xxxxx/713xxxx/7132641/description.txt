We created this game as a tribute to the old-school manic shooters (aka bullet hell or danmaku) but enhanced with a modern, touch based game-interface and easy to read HD graphics. As gamers ourselves, our first goal was to create a game that we wanted to play.

Some developers try harder, and that describes the creators of Shogun: Bullet Hell Shooter. You can see real effort in the details of this space shooter and those details flesh out the whole experience of playing, and ultimately make the game more fun.
