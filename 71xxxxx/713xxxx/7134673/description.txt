((A State Of  Trance 550 Day 5 Miami UMF + Split + Unsplit + Armin's Closing Set 720p HD Video + SURPRISE FROM INSPIRON!!))



Hey guys, first of all please notice that live feeds on my new page on facebook, follow up, and this is a gift for you, because i couldn't get the closing set of armin, so i uploaded the video of the set, i think it won't be necessary to have the split track of a track of it because there is a set of him and most of the song he already played, so i thought it would be nice to upload the HD video of the party, so PLEASSSEEEE PLEASSEE : HELP ME SEED THIS BECAUSE IT'S OVER 2 GB !!!!


second of all, please don't post stupid things like upload the final set and stuff like this, just enjoy it and the rest is much better to come in netherlands, so just enjoy it, and help me seeding, because this is much work for me, i am uploading the unsplit and the split to make everyone satisfied, so just understand, and sorry for being late, it's just the uni and life i have to have fun a little and so on :D
