,maniak242,2012-03-27T17:02Z,"Thanks, great torrent! I wish they fix the magnet link so we can choose what files we wanna download, otherwise we must wait for torrent to load on uTorrent so we can choose what we want to download."
[T],-inspiron-,2012-03-27T17:14Z,"@maniak242 : NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT !! the magnet link is no different than the torrent file man!!, as soon as you start to download the files, just go to ""files"" tab in utorrent, and choose the files you don't want to download and right click> don't download !!!! that's it mate , cheers"
,FileList1,2012-03-27T18:37Z,"@-inspiron- Yeah that's right, but you have to wait 2-3 sec for downloading the file list, and after that you can unselect something. During this time the download starts for that files you don't want to download."

,RnAoDm,2012-03-31T04:55Z,"Hey Inspiron. I've been a long time fan of your downloads, truly a great person for doing this for thousands of people you don't even know...I just have a question regarding these ASOT 550 torrents. Some of the files are corrupted, I have tried downloading the torrents multiple times and each time there is some songs that won't play, and are even unrecognized as valid files.

I guess my question to you is, do you have the working files on your machine? I would happily make a donation for your efforts if you could provide these files for download. Anyway, here are the files:
