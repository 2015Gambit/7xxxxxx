And you are real troll. Try doing something useful with your life.

,7117,2012-03-27T10:19Z,"what reason you duplicate Polisdavid torrents here again? you downloading other users torrents and uploading same torrent again, why?such a wanna beiber its not even funny"
,zeeowl,2012-03-27T10:44Z,"@ 7117 READ THE TORRENT DESCRIPTION! I found this (with Google using ""Serial Box"") on Kickass Torrents, not here."
[T],nobody2007,2012-03-27T12:20Z,"@zeeowl - quiet plz - thats an old serial box from march.

In only 5 or 6 days we get the april box. What reason for posting this 'history'-file? Leechers: 6 - Seeders: 11"
,zeeowl,2012-03-27T12:58Z,"@ nobody2007
""quiet plz"" ? Says who?!?

""What reason for posting this 'history'-file?""
Because I wanted it, and thought other people might want it too.

""Leechers: 6 - Seeders: 11""
That's NOW, as in ""at this very moment"". At least 50 people have downloaded it so far... I lost count. So it seems to be a useful torrent for many people. If you don't want it, don't download it. Who knows what will happen in 5 or 6 days?"

Thanks for the torrent. Works great and it's just what I was looking for."
,zeeowl,2012-03-28T12:32Z,"Thanks to all the seeders.

Huge thanks to CodeTempest for producing this great app.

And special thanks to Mr. Troll for providing some entertainment. This torrent wouldn't be as much fun without you. :D"
,zeeowl,2012-03-28T12:34Z,"@ letshare2
You're welcome. Appreciation is always appreciated. :)"
,man4unaz,2012-03-29T01:14Z,Thank You.... 
[V],polisdavid,2012-03-29T01:47Z,"The name of the app is ""SerialBox"" not Serial Box"
,zeeowl,2012-03-29T11:10Z,"@ man4unaz
You're welcome.

@ polisdavid
In every copy I've ever downloaded (past 3-4 years) here or elsewhere, it's always been ""Serial Box"". This is the contents of the ZIP file I got from Kickass Torrents:
iSerial Reader [v2.0.10].dmg
Serial Box [03.2012] + iSerial Reader [v2.0.10] + SerialSeeker [v1.3.6 (B2)] [MAC] [Universal] [CodeTempest] [DESCRIPTION].rtf
Serial Box [03.2012].sb2
SerialSeeker [v1.3.6 (B2)].zip
Z - CodeTempest 7.jpg

Text in the RTF file:
""Serial Box [03.2012] + iSerial Reader [v2.0.10] + SerialSeeker [v1.3.6 (B2)] [MAC] [Universal]
SERIALS for MACs.
...[CodeTempest]""

Unless somebody is going around making modified copies with a space added… but then, look at the icon labels in your own torrent… How did that happen? :D"
[V],polisdavid,2012-03-30T18:12Z,"When searching for a dupe eliminate the space in the search, i.e.

SerialBox* for Serial Box
BluRay* for Mac Blu Ray Player
AnythingElse* for Anything Else

just to make sure that there are no dupes already posted"
,zeeowl,2012-04-05T13:47Z,"@ polisdavid

Good suggestion. Though of course, not everyone will think of doing that. And then there's all the other possible variants. ""Cereal Box"", for example. I design user interfaces, so I tend to always try to make things easier for people, rather than intentionally more difficult. ;)"
