Blackbox is a brand new free operating system with a host of fresh apps. Our goal was to create a user friendly familiar desktop that stays consistent and stable.  We believe that the wheel shouldn't be reinvented with every new release.  If it works good, leave it alone.  Our focus is on a feature rich, easy to use, familiar user desktop.



While boasting good looks and powerful applications, it requires surprisingly low system resources. This is accomplished by using a custom xfce desktop. 




We do not have a timetable for new releases, as they are based on community feedback and requests.
