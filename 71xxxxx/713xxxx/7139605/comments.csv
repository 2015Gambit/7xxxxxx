,kristijanH,2012-03-28T20:14Z,This one has no password.
,kristijanH,2012-03-28T20:21Z,Can someone please tell me how to prevent tropico4.exe through my firewall? I'm on Win7. zhanks.
,kristijanH,2012-03-28T20:57Z,This one is NOT password protected. The torrent that was protected got deleted.
[V],azizex666,2012-03-28T21:00Z,"@ketchikan420
this is not password protected so go die in a lake of fire"
[V],azizex666,2012-03-28T21:21Z,"@kristijanH
which firewall program are you using?  "
,kristijanH,2012-03-28T21:24Z,Default Windows firewall. I can add tropico to the blocked list but it doesn't help. I have to disable my ethernet controller to play. I had the same problem with T4.
,misu587,2012-03-28T23:02Z,"Thanks to the uploader, does it have the 1.05 version with it i have the freezing problem. Once again thank you"
[V],azizex666,2012-03-28T23:44Z,"ya, the game version is 1.05.339"
[V],azizex666,2012-03-28T23:45Z,and I've been playing it for a while without any freezing problem.
,anuzbitt,2012-03-29T10:42Z,guys with problems blocking thier internet. jus unplug ur internet connection fr a sec enter game and plug cable again works same way until we get a proper crack
,Revrant,2012-03-30T20:50Z,"Comment didn't send, yes it works fine totally legit, you can get an offline launcher for normal Tropico 4"
,Soolgoolg,2012-03-31T15:17Z,"Mine keeps freezing and crashing, is that the actual game of the DLC and how can I fix it, if anybody knows"
[V],azizex666,2012-03-31T15:23Z,"@Soolgoolg
this is expansion pack for tropico 4.
1-make sure u meet the minimum system requirements and have flt version of tropico 4 installed.
2- make sure to block the game from accessing web thru the firewall before running.
hope this helps."
,Soolgoolg,2012-03-31T16:31Z,"For some reason i cant block it, so i simply disconnect the ethernet cable from the router, and i far pass the system requirements, and I do have the FLT version, when it crashes the log says something about an inability to read a map file, or something similar, i may try just reinstalling the whole thing, also, I dont install it in the default directory, could that be a factor, sometimes games act odd when not in their default"
,NNobre,2012-07-25T05:07Z,"Dudes,

I figured out how to make tropico 4 works without disconnecting the ethernet cable.

Just block ON ANTIVIRUS the url launcher01.kalypsomedia.com and then use the serial provided by heromaster. Block on firewall too as other people already said. In the first time, it'll ask for the serial, but after one time, it'll never opens the launcher again.

Worked with me with the Airlines Tycoon 2 and Tropico 4 Modern Times.

Hope it works for you

Cya"
