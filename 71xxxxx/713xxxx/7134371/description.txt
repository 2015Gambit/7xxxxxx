Open the "Adobe Patch""Block Activation", and run the batch cmd.
(If you have issues with it, scroll down to my FAQ reply)
This will edit your "hosts" file, I set mine to read only after
I have done an edit. I have encluded a shortcut in the patch folder if you
do not know where your Hosts file is. 

Open the folder named "AdobePSCS5" and run the setup app. 

Enter one of the serials I have supplied in the patch folder.
Select your language (this is not Multi, it is ENG.)
Skip "enter Adobe ID"
Install 

Open the patch folder,I am running a 64-Bit System
so I will use the "64 Bit System" folder.
(Those with 32-Bit Systems will OC use the 32-Bit folder)
Inside of that folder you will see four (4) folders.
Two (2) are batch folders. Running a 64-Bit System,
I will use the 32 & 64 bit batch files.
In the 64-Bit folder exe the "DLLCopy64b"
Do the same in the 32-Bit folder. 

Open Photoshop
go to"help""updates"
