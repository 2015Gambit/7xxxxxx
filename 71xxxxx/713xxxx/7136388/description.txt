
OCULA is a unique collection of plug-in tools for NUKE that solve common problems with stereoscopic imagery, boost productivity in post production and ultimately help deliver a more rewarding stereoscopic viewing experience.

Problems addressed include:

Colour matching - fixing differences introduced by polarisation and mirror rigs

Vertical alignment - correcting vertical offsets introduced by mismatched camera rigs and keystoning

Focus matching - fixing focus differences between cameras by deblurring and view reconstruction

Interaxial shifting - altering the interaxial distance baked into a stereo pair by rebuilding views

Retiming - stereo motion vectors for retimes with correct stereo alignment

Disparity generation - for automating and speeding up day to day compositing tasks including automated roto view generation, convergence manipulation, depth channel generation, material QC and more.
