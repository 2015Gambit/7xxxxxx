[b]Moyers & Company, March 23 2012: Moving Beyond War[/b]

Nine years after Baghdad erupted in ΓÇ£shock and awe,ΓÇ¥ weΓÇÖre once again hearing in America the drumbeat for war in the Middle East. Now, the bullΓÇÖs-eye is on Iran. But what we need more than a simple change of target is a complete change in perspective, says [b]Andrew Bacevich[/b], a West Point graduate and Vietnam veteran-turned-scholar whoΓÇÖs become one of the most perceptive observers of AmericaΓÇÖs changing role in the world.

This week, on an all-new [i]Moyers & Company[/i], Bill Moyers and Bacevich explore the futility of ΓÇ£endlessΓÇ¥ wars, and provide a reality check on the rhetoric of American exceptionalism.

ΓÇ£Are we so unimaginative, so wedded to the reliance on military means that we cannot conceive of any way to reconcile our differences with groups and nations in the Islamic world, and therefore bring this conflict to an end?ΓÇ¥ Bacevich tells Moyers.

Bacevich also answers the question of whether Iran is a direct threat to America with a definitive no. ΓÇ£Whatever threat Iran poses is very, very limited,ΓÇ¥ he tells Moyers, ΓÇ£and certainly does not constitute any kind of justification for yet another experiment with preventive war.ΓÇ¥
