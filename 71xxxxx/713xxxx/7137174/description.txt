THE TRIALS OF OSCAR WILDE

Simon Russell-Beale stars as Oscar Wilde in a recreation of the doomed libel action taken by Wilde against the Marquis of Queensbury. Old Bailey, the main courthouse in London, had never presented a show quite like the trial that captivated England and much of the literary world in the spring of 1895. Celebrity, sex, witty dialogue, political intrigue, surprising twists, and important issues of art and morality--is it any surprise that the trials of Oscar Wilde continue to fascinate one hundred years after the death of one of the world's greatest authors and playwrights?

Wilde in the dock, from The Illustrated Police News, 4 May 1895

Wilde was imprisoned first in Pentonville and then Wandsworth Prison in London. Inmates followed a regimen of "hard labour, hard fare and a hard bed", which wore very harshly on Wilde, accustomed as he was to many creature comforts. His health declined sharply, and in November he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger. His right ear drum was ruptured in the fall, an injury that would later contribute to his death. He spent two months in the infirmary.
