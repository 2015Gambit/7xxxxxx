Workdone:
First off we used UnKnowN's 720p source and sync it with the Line Audio which was not easy took us 6 to 8 hours. If it goes out of sync for a sec Im sorry. There a spot that appears not to have audio when he is telling his boss the miranda rights, so it goes out of sync for a few sync's then back into sync. Did the usual filters which I wont bore you with.

Audio: Cleaned it up and did some audio enhancements
