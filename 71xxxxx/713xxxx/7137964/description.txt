i HAVE USED THE 4:3 ASPECT RATION DVD/CAM AUDIO VERSION AND SIMPLY SET SOME ADJUSTMENTS USING CONVERTXTODVD TO CONVERT IT TO A COMPLETE DVD WITH START MENUE AND TITTLE SETS..   

YOU CAN EITHER BURN IT STRAIGHT TO A DVD-R USING A SOFTWARE/FREE IF YOU FIND ONE OR SIMPLY PLAY THE VIDEO-TS FOLDER ON YOUR PC.    PLAY ON PC YOY JUST SELECT THE FOLDER AND RIGHT CLICK AND PLAY WITH WHATEVER MEDIA PLAYER YOU USE.



COULDNT FIX AUDIO BUT ITS ALL IT SYNC WITH NO BRUCE LEE STYLE MOUTH MOVING THEN SOME TALKING..LOL.
