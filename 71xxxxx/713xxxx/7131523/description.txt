Project management made painless

OmniPlan is designed to help you visualize, maintain, and simplify your projects. Break down tasks, optimize the required resources, control costs, and monitor your entire planΓÇöall at a glance. Collaborate with your colleagues and share every detail, update a calendar with your days off, or mix and match. Accept and reject changes one-by-one or all in one go. OmniPlan provides features like Gantt charts, schedules, summaries, milestones, and critical path highlighting to let you manage all of your activities. From customizable views to fast data entry, OmniPlan helps you manage projects that are as simple or complex as you need them to beΓÇöwithout the complexity.

Publish & Subscribe

Stop, collaborate, listen. Make changes to your project and see those from your collaborators with syncing; customize your availability and have your colleagues' calendars update instantly. Mix and match your publish and subscribe actions to meet your needs.

Change Tracking

Use change tracking to keep tabs on and review the changes you've made in your project so far. If you're syncing, use change tracking to review, browse, and then accept or reject changes (task by task or en masse) from your collaborators.

Smart Scheduling

Establish a schedule with OmniPlan's calendar view from which your actions can be scheduled. Customize calendars for the project as a whole or on a resource by resource basis. Create exceptions to account for holidays, office closures, that too-sunny-to resist day offΓÇöyou name it.
