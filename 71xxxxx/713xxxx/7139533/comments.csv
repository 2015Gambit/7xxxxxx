[V],wushdishmeen,2012-04-02T20:49Z,"HOWARD IS ON VACATION ALL THIS WEEK FOR EASTER HOLIDAY.

Even though he is jewish he will believe in it if it means more time off!

In the meantime they will be airing ""20 Years Gone: A Tribute To Sam Kinison"" all week long (even thursday & friday).  The specials are 7+ hours long so give me time to post them.

They will return live next Monday, April 9th.

PEACE & LOVE."

I wasn't replying to you you self centered imbecile I was informing people that he is on vacation.  Go bother someone else."
