Star Warped

I used to play Star Warped for hours and laugh my ass off the whole time...
fifteen years ago, under Windows 95. Now I'm sad to find that I can't get it to
run under Windows XP Pro: "This program requires at least 3MB of free memory to
run." Of course, I have way more than 3 megs of free ram. Glance at
Star_Warped_System_Requirements.gif before you download the whole torrent if you
like. It's made to run under Windows 3.1 or 95. Oh well. Your mileage may vary,
or perhaps you have an old Windows 95 box sitting in the corner. If so, give
this thing a shot. It's well worth it. When you finally get to play "Tell You I
Will" with Yoda, cuss at him... but be sure you aren't drinking milk at the
time.

If you get it to work under XP, please post a reply to this torrent telling how
you did it to help myself and others get it going. Mac comments are also
welcome. I hope somebody gets some use out of it.
