This is a massive collection of resources for use with RPG Maker. It is the same collection that can be found on youtube, but I made a few modifications, including the following:

1. All .jpg, .gif, and .bmp files have been converted to .png
2. All .png files have been compressed and had useless data removed from them using PngOptimizer
3. All .mp3 and .wav files have been converted to .ogg
4. Use a much stronger compression to vastly decrease the size of the download.
