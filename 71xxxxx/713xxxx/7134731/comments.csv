This torrent is really only here for those who use RPG Maker and recognize my name, know I have a good rep, and are likely being linked to this page from a post I made in another forum. If you don't use RMXP/RMVX, then this is of no use for you, don't just go posting that it is an ""obvious virus"", when you have no idea what the hell it is. 

Do you really think I would be stupid enough to try to pass a virus as an .exe and name it ""Pandora's Box"" of all things and expect people to fall for it? "
