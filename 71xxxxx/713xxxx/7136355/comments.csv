,Pettingson,2012-03-29T20:31Z,"Thank you for reupping this game and for me it even worked without any compatibility mode :D 
However, even if i have the folder in its ""original"" place at C:Corsairs So that all the folders in the ini are the same. It doesn't find the video files. Should the folder really be called intro or?"

,The_Skum82,2012-03-29T21:43Z,"Hi. Thanks for the comment.

There is some kind off problem with the program on startup, but i does not have any effect on the game, what so ever. I actualy dont know the problem there. I think it has something to do with the .dll file in the corsairs folder. I simply cant get the video files running."
,The_Skum82,2012-03-29T21:45Z,I think it is some kind of codec problem.
,skvjovik,2012-04-07T13:50Z,"Hi! Thank you for seeding this torrent! Though i have a problem... I did just what you said above and placed the folder ""CORSAIRS"" in c: and changed the compability of the .exe file to win95 and clicked setup. 
I then got the message:
!!!ERROR!!!
MEMORY
ERROR N째00010002 LINE:99 FILE:courmem.c.

What have i done wrong and how can I do it right? I really wanna play this awesome game...

Once again, thanks for seeding! :)"
,The_Skum82,2012-04-07T15:40Z,"skvjovik

Just extract the rar file in c: and run the game in win95 mode. Worked fine for me."
,skvjovik,2012-04-07T20:00Z,"When you say ""run the game in win95 mode"", do you mean to change the compability of the setup file to win 95 or something else? :)"
,The_Skum82,2012-04-08T12:02Z,Yes
,The_Skum82,2012-04-08T12:03Z,There shoul not be a setup file in the download. Only a rar file called corsairs.rar. I think u have the fist upload i made. Try and download this one.
,Arntzenichov,2012-04-16T20:02Z,"I can't save the game when a i am playing, how can i fix this?"
,giannaras4,2012-05-06T10:47Z,"my problem is that when i choose campaign to play..while the game is loading it crushes

,jacoobi43,2012-05-08T15:02Z,"I have the same problem as skvjovik. It keeps saying that there's an error... after extracting the game, i changed the compatibility for windows 95 but it doesn't work for me
help please !"
,wadafack,2012-06-19T01:38Z,"I seem to be able to play the game, even tho i get a message error in the beginning, something about an intro video missing.

Anyway, the biggest problem is that it has no music! Which is one of the main reasons why I love this game. Is kinda boring playing it without the soundtrack.

I have all the sound effects, tho.

U know how can I fix it?

btw, thanks for sharing!"
,Nadrojz,2012-07-07T17:25Z,"I can't save either, any idea why ? I'm on Windows 7 extracted the game on c: and running it in win95 mode."
