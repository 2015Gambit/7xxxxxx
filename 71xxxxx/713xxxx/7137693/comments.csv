Also killing kids is not that great a show."

,salazam1,2012-03-30T11:35Z,"@thatdude5124 This movie sucks balls. My friend said when he saw it in the theater, like halfway through people just started talking about work and shit. I'm glad I d/l it, I watched the thing with my finger hovering over the ff button. It's a kids movie. An immensely boring one at that. Character development is weak and uninspired. Plot is pathetically lame and unbelievable (i.e. totally predictable).
If you wanna watch some real movies that provide an accurate commentary on the survival nature of humans (albeit kids) when pitted against each other, I recommend the 1963 version of Lord of the Flies, or Battle Royale."

 In no way does saying ""Fuck you"" in a comment section about a movie say that you have ""courage"". If you dont like it, dont watch it. You want courage? Strap on a pair of boots, a military uniform, and an M-4 and spend the day wasting strangers for defending their own way of life,their beliefs....in THEIR country. Then tell me how disgusted you are at your own self-entitled stupidity. 
The movie, even though controversial, is just that...a movie. And furthermore....it was a BOOK first. So saying fuck you to the moviemakers is just idiotic.

hey bud as an 11B officer i would like you to know that not only is your little comment about ""wasting strangers for defending their own way of life"" one of the most deplorably STUPID and counter productive things I have ever heard an enlisted soldier say, but I also think you should understand that it is punishable under UCMJ when uttered on an INTERNATIONAL forum. Hearts and minds scumbag hearts and minds. And as an addendum it doesnt take courage to do what you describe it takes ignorance and the strategic intelligence of an 8 year old with a hand full of GI joes! going to a foreign country and operating with restraint and precision takes courage"

,suddengreetings,2012-03-31T09:35Z,"Quality good enough, but the movie sucks.  Even more so because Hollywood decided to cast a couple of magic niggers in very prominent roles and totally ruined it, visually speaking. The book is essentially describing a world that is implicitly white and does not mention a bootlip and a shezilla with Eistein's brains. So why are they there?  Well, because without magic niggers you can't have a movie these days.  Anyone seen Thor? LOL.."
,TheProHallak,2012-03-31T11:39Z,@hakon1290 they only made it less violent because they wanted to increase the rate of people watching it so they changed it from pg 15 to pg 13 so more people watch so it so they cut off some parts

@suddengreetings - Did you even read the books? I can't believe some of the horrid racist remarks coming from people about the black actors in this movie. The tributes from district 11 (Rue, Thrash) are SPECIFICALLY IF NOT BLATANTLY described as having DARK COLOURED SKIN in the book. Even Katniss is descibed as having olive skin. And if you did read the book, you'd know that apparently in the captiol, having lime green skin is all the rage. Where do you get this implied white world? The lack of reading comprehension along with complete racism over the casting is abhorrable. Get a life people. What, black people can't be actors now? Want only white people in your utopia?

Spoken like a true american. Fix your problems at home before you stick your nose in everyone else's.

"
,sickEVILmutant,2012-04-01T03:00Z,"The US presence in the middle east is needed because the UN is worthless and the EU has no balls and is too afraid to offend Arab countries.  Just look at WWII.  Europeans tried to remain neutral while all their neighbors were being overrun and when they decided it was time to actually do something about it, it was too late.  So, Americans to the rescue again.  Fucking idiot."
,Cargoniancastle,2012-04-01T03:16Z,"@tyranosaw: Spoken like a true retard. Be capable of fixing your own problems before you tell Americans to ""fix"" their own.

Then when the big bad bullies come and knock down your door you're all like ""America, why aren't you helping us?"" 

@tao34: Don't pretend to be a Soldier. First six words in your comment gave you away. 11 Bravo is not and will not ever be an ""officer"" MOS as any real Soldier knows, from the real 11Bs to people as simple as 09 Romeos or 92 Sierras. And read the UCMJ. He never stated that he was an ""enlisted Soldier"". What Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, or Airmen say on their own time is no one's business, as long as they do not affiliate themselves with the military. However, it is a court-martial offense for an officer to behave in an ungentleman-like or unlady-like manner, as you did. Officers are ladies and gentlemen and held to higher standards of behavior than enlisted troops. ""Sir""."

This will work...while waiting for a screener. 

It's always a delight to see an excellent book brought to life on the screen, and this is more likely to happen when the author takes a hand in the production. Collins worked on the script. The other side of the spectrum is disaster, like 'Starship Troopers.' What a waste that was, but Heinlein was already dead, bless him.

This may not be the textbook definition of a Telesync but, in the pirate community, it's sometimes as close as they come. A telesync is sort of loosely defined as basically a cam with higher quality audio, rather than using the camera's built in mic. It can be done using tools designed for those with hearing impairments, drive-in movie FM broadcasts, line-in audio, etc. The audio can sometimes be quite good but, unfortunately, the video is subject to the usual limitations of sneaking around a movie theater with a video camera. The best TS screeners we see are usually those rare ones where they're filmed from the projection booth. Those make for (relatively) great vids."

,ProphetZarquon,2012-06-26T01:32Z,"Agreed, this is no TS.  TeleSync is a very specific process, not ""loosely defined"".

I'm far from on expert ont his, but here goes...

AFAIK, in rough order of quality, you'll see:

Cam = Camera in a theater.
Line = Camera with Line audio patched or dubbed in.
Screener = A pre-release or promo DVD released to preview audiences.  Usually with watermarking and sometimes even missing final edits or effects.
TeleSync = Film to digital direct transfer via a dedicated machine.  Traditionally this was actually done by the studio?  Very rare these days with modern cinema.
R5 = Region 5, a foreign DVD release which generally preceds US releases by a wide margin.  Usually has American audio dubbed in over the foreign footage.
DVDrip = Exactly as it sounds, quality depends entirely on encoding used by the release group.
HDTVrip = Often misused, please don't call it an HDTVrip if you are encoding a video that ends up below 720p!  720x480p is *not* HD, that's DVD, or ""Standard"" resolution. 1280x720p is HD, 1920x1080p is bigger, but not always better on all displays.
BRrip = BluRay rip, again, often misused.  If you started with a BluRay at 1080p and encoded it into an x264 MP4 file at 576x240, that's NOT BluRay quality and certainly not HD.  Honestly, if the final resolution isn't above 720x480 why even bother using a BluRay instead of a DVD?
R3D = RedCam footage. 125 minutes took over 30 hours to transcode to 1080p MP4 on my system, since I don't have a Red Rocket. :(

I won't even get into 3D formats as that's a whole mess in and of itself.  Suffice to say I'm not a fan of anaglyph or active-shutter."

The only thing Telesync is, is a direct line audio or special emphasis on remastering the audio, or setting the framerate of the video capture to that of a digital display recording. It has nothing to do with remote processing of the video at the time of recording. Many cams can be telesync'd audio wise. I'm not sure why more people don't get ahold of their local theature managers and complain they are hearing impaired and use this.

So in the word of the famous Rodney King, ""Can't we all just get along?"" Or ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" & ""Do not judge least you be judged likewise"" The way I like to put it is ""Mellow out! Grrrrrowl! Mate."" Just kidding.

I know my teenage daughter loved this movie and I had to go and buy her all the books also. The only reason I watch these movies is I'm disabled and broke and have memory damage so I download movies and watch them repeatedly until I can either remember them or I watch them once every month or so and it is like watching a new movie again.  I appreciate the fact that this is hard to get into trouble here when you download here. Yea the quality is never really as good as the actual DVD's or Blue Rays but it is good enough. That is with the Rips. These guys are working hard to allow the world access to what the big wigs want to charge bucco bucks for and we are getting it all free thanks to these guys. So the least you can do is be polite to each other and be appreciative that this site even exists especially with all the governments and movie and music industries trying to shut it down. Even though I am poor I have bought a lot of DVD's and I may not have had it not been for me seeing them first here  off the internet. Some are worth it. Some aren't and here is where you find out which you think are worth it and which are not worth it. I have seen many movies that most people say they do not like, yet I found them very entertaining. Many they say they like and I found them not entertaining at all. Each person has their own opinion so the best thing to do is be polite about it and not cuss and threaten each other and if you feel it important to state your opinion, do so but in a nice manner.

Bone, keep up the good work and ignore all those people who are upset. It may be that they have a lot of frustration going on at the home front and most do so they use this as a place to air their feelings kind of like psychological therapy. Deep down everyone has a nice side to them and many do not really feel as mean as they sound. They just need to learn another way to release their frustrations and they would mellow out. Thanks for all your hard work though. They really appreciate it but like to grand stand and act tough. SO forgive us all and continue your fine work knowing some really do appreciate it and are not afraid to admit it. Take care everyone."

,Denimoth,2012-08-01T08:35Z,"For everyone asking, the DVD will be released (in North America) on August 18, 2012. Look for a DVDRip sometime around that date."

You don't seem to know how streaming videos work. You're still downloading a large file, but it gets temporarily stored on your computer then deleted when you're done viewing it. If you're going to download it, it might as well be in a format that you can keep to view it more than once. But, that would be the smart thing to do..."
