The first book by an American pscyhotherapist to win and endorsement from the eminent therapist Alice Miller, "Reclaiming Your Life" lays out a powerful program for healing the effects of childhood abuse. Using examples from her private practice over fifteen years, Jenson demonstrates that twelve-step and similar programs, as well as traditional therapies, do not fully deal with the phenomenon of repressed pain. Until this pain is "processed" - retrieved from the unconscious, fully experienced, and grieved over - she believes adults will still be trapped in the patterns of childhood.
