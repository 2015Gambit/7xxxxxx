Personal message:

I recommend turning the intensity to max and not play for over an hour at a time. I played for 2 hours and felt like my eyes were going to fall out and my head was going to explode. 

I am unsure if the multiplayer works because i have not tried it yet but single player should be enough for anyone because of the intensity.

Good luck.

SEED!!!
