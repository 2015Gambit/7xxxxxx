@mattynoonan

Before uploading the file make it a DMG. file so you can mount it when download is complete and the data wont get f*cked"
,mattynoonan,2012-03-29T08:29Z,"ok everyone i am sorry that the game isnt working and i will re-upload it as a DMG as Grapeflavouredpop as requested, i will do this in approximately 2 hours as i have other commitments at the moment so stay posted. thank you "
,mattynoonan,2012-03-29T10:17Z,"This is the new torrent that has the files in a DMG. and hopefully this will work for you all. tell me if it has worked.

,mattynoonan,2012-04-01T15:23Z,"Sorry to disappoint again but nothing is working for me atm. i tried to upload to a filesharing website that actually lets me upload files that are over 200mb and it got to 13% and stopped so idk what to do. you will just have to keep trying this torrent and if it doesn work then maybe sometime when i get back i will try to sort all this shit out. 

im very sorry to everyone who was looking forward to playing it :("
