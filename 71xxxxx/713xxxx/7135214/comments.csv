,darkdragon0493,2012-03-27T14:36Z,sorry if upload speeds are slow at the begining but it's cus im seeding other torrents. i will be back by like 12:45 p.m. u.s. central (about 7 hours behind thepiratebay's time i think) from there just comment on here and ill stop my other torrents to upload this one. 
,darkdragon0493,2012-03-27T23:04Z,i have access to a second computer at home so a second seed should be coming up in a little while. It will have the full torrent that this one has. im simply trying to get the torrent to other people faster.
,darkdragon0493,2012-03-28T06:34Z,since there are two other seeders for now i will resume my other torrents and keep this one going. if i see that more seeders are needed i will stop my other torrents and continue only with this one.

,darkdragon0493,2012-06-12T21:27Z,ill try to get u the link
,darkdragon0493,2012-06-12T21:58Z,"for anyone that doesn't want to wait... i made another torrent with the .txt file with the link to the direct downloads. just click on my name and then download the other torrent. I promise, I don't spread viruses and would not enjoy making people suffer."
[S],soda,2012-06-13T01:35Z,"This is a torrent site, not a direct download site.  

I've deleted your torrent of links.  No doubt you're going to be pissed off at that but the alternative was banning you.  I've cut you a break.  Don't try anything like that again."
,darkdragon0493,2012-06-13T20:58Z,"wow... umm, okay, thanks for the second chance! I guess i wont happen again!"
,darkdragon0493,2012-06-13T21:00Z,"BTW, im currently having network problems so i might not be able to upload until later in the day."
