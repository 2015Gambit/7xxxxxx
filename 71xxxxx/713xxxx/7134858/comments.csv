,keenan123,2012-03-29T02:18Z,How do i get the clip art and other stuff that comes on a disc when you buy the program??
,swimtwobirds,2012-05-29T02:32Z,"Thaks for the download - I had X6 16.0.0.707 loaded using this keygen, running fine under Win 7 SP1.  I removed Coreldraw and purged my C: drive to clean out troubling corruptions, and when I tried to reload Corel, every thing seemed to work fine - keygen generated serial number, Corel made an installation code which I put into the keygen but Corel then rejected the activation code generated.  I have tried to reinstall four times now, but can't get past this point. Can you please advise me?  Is there some hidden file where Corel hides a message to say 'already loaded trial on this machine', or records teh first serial number entered and then won't acccept any different serial on that m/c, or similar?   Thanks in advance -"
,swimtwobirds,2012-05-30T02:29Z,Please ignore the above - I had forgotten the bit about entering the serial code by hand - oopsie!
