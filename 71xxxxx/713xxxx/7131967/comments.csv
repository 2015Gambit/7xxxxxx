,EdoSensei,2012-03-26T06:54Z,"I was about to say, footy, you are the God! Also, because you do AVI files which work on the PS3 AND my portable player.........

........but this is an MKV file. Yesterday's MotD you uploaded as an AVI. Why the change? It doesn't mean you've converted to MKV forever does it? Even your upload of Sunday's F1 race is an AVI.

Please stick with the AVI format. I'm sure many others would appreciate it. The only benefit I can see with MKVs are that the files are a little smaller, but not a huge difference."
,EdoSensei,2012-03-26T06:57Z,"Actually on the file size........

Yesterday's MotD was 85 mins and 659mb whereas this MotD2 is 50 mins and 612mb. Therefore your AVI is a smaller file per minute of programme!

Up the AVIs!!!"
,Davkar2,2012-03-26T07:23Z,"People complain about this being an mkv instead of an avi.

If they do a search for the ""AVS Video Converter"" they can convert files from one format to another. I have used it to convert DVDs saved in ISO format then decompressed using WinRar. You can then convert the VOB or IFO files into avi files. 

mkv and mp4 files give good quality in a small file size which saves bandwidth and download capacity for those of us who have greedy ISPs. "

,XenoPT,2012-03-26T14:01Z,"@albiondean you know of course that there is a certain individual who sells his TV captures...

So imagine if anyone would do the same: A HDTV + set top box + HDD recording a TV show who's rights belong to that TV channel BTW, and then selling those on the internet... how's that sound for you?

I don't care about if a person is sharing another one's TV capture, as long as it keeps them free! You should however allways credit the original caper... (unless he's the person previously mentioned)"
[V],albiondean,2012-04-07T21:25Z,"XenoPT, What a Nieve twat your are, do you think sharing sites exist for the love of sharing with out making a profit ? Do you think charity donations that people donate to 100% goes to that charity ?

This file sharing is a money racket for many sites, believe it or not."
