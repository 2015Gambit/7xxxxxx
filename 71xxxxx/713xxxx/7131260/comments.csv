http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6462848/Heavy_Metal_Magazine_1977-20011___Specials_(541_issues)
Just download the folders 2011 and 2012. All other files are the same even if their names are different. 
I have been doing some work organizing this collection. Files were renamed in the same pattern. Duplicates were removed."

I have just tried both unpacking the file with WinRAR and opening the file with ComicRack. All worked just fine. The file is not password protected and there shouldn't be any problems with it. Try again the way I have mentioned. Hope this time it is ok."
