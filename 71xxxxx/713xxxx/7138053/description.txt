Details:

This Texas-based worship leader infuses her sophomore solo release with a quiet but ever-present spiritual urgency that emphasizes GodΓÇÖs loving nature and redemptive power. JobeΓÇÖs breathy, vulnerable vocals often recall the waif-like tones of Leigh Nash, though she's also capable of dramatic flourishes at key moments. Under the sure guidance of veteran Christian music producers Ed Cash and Matt Bronleewe, Where I Find You mixes simmering electronica settings (ΓÇ£Stars in the Sky,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Run to YouΓÇ¥) with piano-centered pop balladry (ΓÇ£What Love Is This,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Love Came DownΓÇ¥) and rousing upbeat anthems (ΓÇ£We AreΓÇ¥). Jobe is at her best when she rises from fragile verses into stirring choruses, as on ΓÇ£Find You on My Knees.ΓÇ¥ Throughout, she displays an ability to deliver messages of praise in personal terms without losing their universality. The closing track, ΓÇ£Here"ΓÇôa heartfelt invitation to accept ChristΓÇôsums up the album's sweet yet strong essence.
