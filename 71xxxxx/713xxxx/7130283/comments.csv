,Spambolo,2012-03-27T19:57Z,"Despite the lack of HD episodes, these 175mb files have been pretty good so far. I watch mine on a USB stick plugged into a Samsung 42'' plasma TV, and they look absolutely fine. There was only one - Orion Pax pt. 2 I think, which was really blocky and pixellated. Otherwise, I'd recommend them whole heartedly."
,BakaRed,2012-03-28T05:10Z,"I disagree Spambolo, these SD uploads look like crap and the last one had parts of the frame cut off with awful audio quality. The HUB broadcasts the episodes in HD, so why the hell is no one capping it in HD? We can get fucking My Little Pony 1080p uploads the same day but we can't do the same for Transformers?"
,cruse2382,2012-04-01T08:50Z,@BakaRed if it bothers you that much do something about it or stop bitch at least  {C_P} is something be grateful for what you get
,MystiTsu,2012-04-01T22:58Z,"TVTeam was the uploader that used to do TFPrime in HD for season 1. I supposed they simply lost interest. If I knew how to do it, I would and if I figure it out I will cause this is ridiculous.  However, Thanks to {C_P} for uploading it at all.  "
,BakaRed,2012-04-02T21:51Z,"@cruse2382 If I could do something about it I wouldn't be here bitching about it, now would I? I also don't see why I should be grateful for shit quality caps when I know they could be doing better."
,9seconds4u,2012-05-06T18:40Z,@BakaRed maybe upload something yourself before you complain.  People are going out of their way to provide this content...zip your lips.
