He was the first or one of the first Asian rappers from the Bay on Sick Wid' It.  I lost my CD years ago and they dont make it anymore so please please if you have it...upload it.  "
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-28T04:18Z,"Funny you as that EngineeringTheEnemy.  Rhythm X was my roommate back in '93-'95.  I grew up with that fool back in the old UBC (Universal Breaking Crew) days.  It is called Coming from the Mountains & unfortunately I lost that cd with my collection as well.  Once I get my shit back from my homie in Philly, I think he might have it when I sent him copies of all my rap.  Ray(Rhythm isn't out here anymore, so I can't just go ask him for it, but once I get it I'll definately post it for you."
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-28T04:22Z,oh btw incase you didn't know Rhythm is now going by Raytona500 and is heavily into doing commercial music for Nascar.  He still produces Sick Wid' It stuff and cuts for other folks as well.
,EngineeringTheEnemy,2012-03-28T09:01Z,Oh thats pretty cool! Hmm I guess I could buy the CD on Ebay or Amazon.  He was great... i'll look for him doing that Nascar stuff...  
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-28T10:28Z,"Naw don't buy it.  I just found my Vinyl copy of it.  I might have the cd version in the next week or so, if it takes longer than that I'll just rip it off the LP.  After you posted I went & found it.  I'd just rather wait for my cd collection to arrive back in the mail before I resort to vinyl."
[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-28T10:43Z,"Ok here's 2 pics of the album & like I said if it doesn't get here within a week I'll rip it off the Vinyl.
