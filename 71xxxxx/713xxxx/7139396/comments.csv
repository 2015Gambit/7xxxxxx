[V],JanOve2011,2012-03-29T15:54Z,"Hej muumtaz1 :) No it is not FLAC. Just as the info says it is ALAC, which stands for the (nowadays) open source and royalty-free ""Apple Lossless Audio Codec"". I donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t know why the bay doesnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t have a ""lossless""-category if they would want to sort out the lossless FLAC from the rest of available lossless codecs."
,brnblnk,2012-03-29T19:55Z,"This is crap, not FLAC!  Quick sucking apple's cock."
[V],JanOve2011,2012-03-29T22:29Z,"@ brnblnk,
Lossless is never ""crap"", since it is.. lossless. Also, I don't own any apple-products if that is what you are trying to refer with the homoerotic statement of cock sucking."

[V],JanOve2011,2012-04-12T20:43Z,"Farfalo: Glad you like it ! yeah, my portable device is android based. On it I use ""poweramp"" and that player is not only neat, it also plays about any codec."
,vismcfly,2012-04-16T02:09Z,Can you pleas convert Tchaikovsky and Chopin. and upload them. i really want to download but the filesize in ALAC is enormous. i have a limited internet :/ please. 
,RZRecklezz,2012-05-19T17:32Z,"@vismcfly Hehe, that's the idea, it's lossless, it's not meant to be small ^^"
,RZRecklezz,2012-05-20T17:45Z,"This download completely jams my pc (playing in WinAmp) I first thought it was because of the m3u, then I added the songs manually and again my pc was completely jammed.
I don't know what this is, and I am sorry but I can't be bothered to investigate it, every time something like this happens I can't use my pc for 15-20 minutes (unless I restart)"
