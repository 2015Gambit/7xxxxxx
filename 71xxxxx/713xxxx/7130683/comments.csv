,Raikkonen94,2012-03-26T09:52Z,Doesn't work for me! :( Gets an error about unknown format and that it is damaged...
,Majin3,2012-03-26T11:20Z,When extracting? Update your extractor to something that supports LZMA2. Recent 7-Zip and WinRAR are fine.
,Raikkonen94,2012-03-26T19:12Z,"Ok sorry Majin3, you were right. I was using an older version of WinRAR. Just updated it and I could extract the file. Now played a few minutes and everything seemed to work fine. So don't pay attention to my previous post, it actually is a great upload!"
,Raikkonen94,2012-03-29T16:52Z,"I was playing for like a hour now, yet I recognize an new problem. The game freezes (black screen) when I want to enter Verdant Court in the Arbor Area.. Any solution?"
,erekevan,2012-03-29T20:39Z,"hi majin3 thanks for the upload,when i load the game after i start new one my emulator always  crushes ,do you know how to fix this thanks agin"
,Majin3,2012-03-30T14:33Z,"Raikkonen94: Hmm, not for now. I actually didn't test it at all, so a bug is possible. Try to use the normal release to get past that scene and see if it works again.

erekevan: Update Dolphin."
,Raikkonen94,2012-03-30T16:57Z,"Majin3: with ""try to use the normal release"" you mean I have to buy the game in real or do you mean something else?"
,Majin3,2012-03-31T17:54Z,"Raikkonen94: You're asking me on The Pirate Bay if I meant to buy it? lol
This one: PokePark.2.Wonders.Beyond.PAL.WII-SUSHi
If it freezes on this one as well, there's something wrong on your end."
,Raikkonen94,2012-03-31T21:51Z,I downloaded that version. It worked perfectly without any bugs. So it's clearly this version that doesn't work. 
,Majin3,2012-04-01T02:42Z,"Raikkonen94: I see. Not sure what could cause a crash, but if I ever get to play this I'll fix it sometime. Thanks for the report."
,jo1111,2012-04-16T15:36Z,"Hi, can anyone help me?
How do I play downloaded games on my wii?
I have got as far as downloading the game, putting it onto an SD card and putting it into the front of the console.
What software do I need to boot the games?
Thanks for your time

,Skyer12,2012-06-03T10:43Z,"I don't know if this happens to anyone else but it stops working when reaching ""Verdant Court""
