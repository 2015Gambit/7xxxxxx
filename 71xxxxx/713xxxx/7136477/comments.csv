Her daughter discovered her body in the dining room (unbelievable, in their home) with a note saying, ""go back to your country, you terrorist"".. She was taken off life support after she was diagnosed brain dead. The Trayvon Martin story is already bad enough, but this one really bothers me. I don't know what I hate more...Fox, Limbaugh and just the entire soulless parasitic GOP or the suckered stupid in this country. This shit is getting out of hand. God...I feel so bad for their family
