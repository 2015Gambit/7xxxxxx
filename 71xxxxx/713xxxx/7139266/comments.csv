,jfy88,2012-04-03T07:24Z,"Hey guys.  So I just installed a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate on my machine.
After installing my loader, the Status field under the Installation tab says Trial instead of Licensed as in the screenshot.  My Windows properties still states there are 3 days until activation.  
Checking http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate it detects that my Windows is genuine!
Did the loader sucessfully activate my Windows or not?    "

,b0bbly,2012-04-17T21:53Z,"Registered to mention that you're a cunt Liddermans. Adding a link to a ""direct download"" for  a torrent that's password protected with some scammy ""click these websites to get the password"". Lowest of the low, and that's damn low."

Thanks, Daz."
,maduke52,2012-04-18T22:18Z,"maybe i sang praises too quick; after successful installation and verification of genuine windows, it takes about 6 minutes for my pc to start where I can sign in and then first move I make it freezes..."

,Magestrix,2012-04-27T11:51Z,"This is the ONLY one that works, the keys are genuine, and on some laptops I've even managed to flash the EEPROM holding key's from Vista to Windows 7. 

Thanks to Daz and all uploaders of Win7. Hopefully when W8 is out, the Win7 will be free.."
