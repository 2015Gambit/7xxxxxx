[V],gansuk,2012-03-26T23:13Z,"its good if your into monkeyisland type stuff, but its very short,"
,LiveInABox,2012-03-30T14:43Z,Thanks for this but it doesn't seem to work for me. Everything is fine until I click the exe to play..I can hear the music and stuff but just get a black screen.

,jimlevins,2012-05-15T16:37Z,The game worked perfectly fine from start to finish for me using the install.exe. Thanks
