,Holy Divr,2012-03-29T02:57Z,Mr Who can you resize this?
,tt54,2012-03-29T04:43Z,"Resize yourself.  If you are a Windows user get Image Resizer Powertoy for Windows XP (Microsoft makes this).  There is also one for Windows 7 at CodePlex.  Google search it.  Right click a picture of a group of pictures and choose the resize option and then set the height or width (not both) and bam, it does it for you."
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-29T09:52Z,"@slowquin. Huge thx for this. Good to see you uploading FG. +1
@HolyD. I have resized and will upload it now.
@tt54. It's not only about resizing, also a need to download smaller files for many users."
,Dalsekanu,2012-03-29T13:47Z,@tt54  Think about those that pay on a per/Gb basis..
