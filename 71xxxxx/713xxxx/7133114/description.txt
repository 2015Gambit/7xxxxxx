 An epic story of love and death, faith and betrayal, War And Remembrance - The Final Chapter completes the grand saga that began with The Winds Of War. World War II continues to rage and the Henry family is swept up in the battles of Europe and the Pacific. Natalie and Aaron Jastrow experience first-hand the horror of Hitler's tyranny - including the Holocaust at Auschwitz - and the world changes forever with the American decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan.
