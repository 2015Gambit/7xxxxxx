,Bookeek,2012-03-27T21:49Z,"oh excellent, I'm always looking for better quality books.
thanks"
,Bookeek,2012-03-27T22:15Z,"It's impossible to delete these post once they are up, but TxJag has a excellent post and I recommend you download Frank Peretti  here -

,TxJag,2012-03-29T20:18Z,I've got a request though. Greg Iles and Gregg Hurwitz. They are good suspenseful writers. Any luck with Preston & Child and Patricia Cornwell?
,Bookeek,2012-04-01T16:01Z,"You have great posts TxJag! I bookmarked you.

Cornwell is gonna take me a while. The quality of the stuff out there is very disappointing.  

Douglas Preston is almost finished...probably this week.

My request list is very long TxJag, but i'll place Illes and Hurwitz on it

cheers

,TxJag,2012-04-02T04:00Z,"Yeah the Cornwell would be in bad shape, I myself found it deplorable as well. Most of your P&C was pretty good. The ones that were needing a ToC will give me some small work but formatting and such are good enough for me."
,Bookeek,2012-04-02T16:19Z,How do you create a TOC
,TxJag,2012-04-02T19:50Z,"Have you used or heard of Sigil? Basically what it is is a WYSIWYG editor for ePubs. You open the ePub file in Sigil and see how the file is presented. MOST ePub files when downloaded and are in bad shape are bunched together to look like 4-5 different sections. Luckily, using Reliquary as an example its in EXCELLENT shape. what ill do is go through to EACH and every section and change the heading to hierarchy the Parts higher than the chapters. Thus creating the ldrop down look you would see in Calibre if you do a View eBook.

I usually open the ePub file from the folder in Calibre. So go to the root Calibre folder and find say Reliquary again right click on the file that says ePub. Then do an ""Open With.."" and it will pop up with available programs that would work and select Sigil that way when you finish and save the edit will already be made to the file in the Calibre folder of Reliquary."
,TxJag,2012-04-02T19:53Z,"Once you finish editing the headings for the sections be sure to select ""Generate ToC"" to check your headings and the look if something looks out of place or you messed up a heading you can know before hand and go back and find it."
,Bookeek,2012-04-03T21:33Z,"damn! i use sigil, but I been using an old version and when I updated I didn't notice that it generated ToC. I'll try it next time. thxs "
,TxJag,2012-04-03T21:49Z,"haha, I went and cleaned up the few books of P&C. like a I said they were in good shape, just needed the headings adjusted."
,Bookeek,2012-04-05T15:35Z,you are welcome to re-post them!
