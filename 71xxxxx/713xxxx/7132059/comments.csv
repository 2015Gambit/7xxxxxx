,rocket221,2012-03-26T19:50Z,Whats up with the file size?
,luv2fly1791,2012-03-27T00:54Z,Is this the new episode from last night? I thought they were on season 12?
,Norade,2012-03-27T01:21Z,"They're on season ten, they started in 2003 and they group seasons by year."
,luv2fly1791,2012-03-27T01:29Z,"Hmm, according to IMDB, last night's episode was s12e01. Season 11 ended in November. However, checking Wikipedia, it states there is no consistent naming structure used for live airing, DVD content, etc. I was just confused because in November, here on TPB, episodes were being posted as s11e00. Thanks for your reply though. Cheers."
