Sort the Chaos in your picture files
 
Ever experienced that uncomfortable feeling of your picture files being spread all-over your PC , with meaningless names and in a highly unorganized fashion?

Unique in its conception, Smart Import is a Digital Media Importer and Sorter.
It greatly simplifies the task of keeping in order your growing media collection.
The software can perform different tasks, the primary of which is taking photos and videos from your camera or other device (PC Drive, flash, memory cards etc..), and copying/moving them to a chosen destination at the same time performing  an automatic rename by subject, date or other criteria. It also creates all the necessary folders, using the specified ordering criteria.

Another task is to reorganize your media files on your pc any time you want. For this goal you can use different renaming and sorting options and you can just drag-drop your files from windows explorer into the Smart Import browser to have them ready for being reorganized and renamed.

If you are a photographer who takes hundreds pictures in a week or even in one day you may want to have a fast way to put your pictures on your computer, organize them and give them meaningful names. Smart Import can use exif data to extract details about the shots like the date-time and add it right into the name of the imported files or folders.
Very Easy to Use and Intuitive
 
In a comfortable browser you can view the pictures on your media device or your hard disk. Small previews are available at your preferred size.

On the top is displayed the source folder, while at the bottom you can select the destination folder where the files will be  imported.

Check the import options and the preview to evaluate how the files will be renamed and reorganized.

Press the Copy or Move Button to start the reorganizing process.
