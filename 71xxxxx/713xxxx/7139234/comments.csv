,Yot212,2012-04-26T19:39Z,"Worked for me. Was at 29 days demo, followed the steps and now at 30 days."
,i_kill_bombs,2012-04-27T12:08Z,Tested under Lion. Worked perfectly.
,logpot,2012-05-04T02:15Z,Worked perfectly (lion) and every patch seems to work fine! Thanks!
,schneeber,2012-05-11T20:11Z,"GUYS, IMPORTANT! just in case people may not know how this works..
(this is on snow leopard but i assume it goes for lion too)

resetting the demo worked the first time, but the second time, it didn't with the original fseventer log. this is because it creates folders named with a random string of letters. so it wont be the same twice.

so make sure that once you have removed the files with Universal Demo Remover, repeat steps 1-7. do this every time you reset it!"
,guitargraham,2012-05-24T22:03Z,Worked perfectly for me just following the directions in the help menu for the UDR. Using imac  Snow Leopard 10.6. Been after this for ages. God bless you IKB.
,marteinn_o1,2012-05-30T21:03Z,Thank you! This is amazing!
,redsaito,2012-06-16T07:38Z,"HELP ME!

FSEventer for me on Lion 10.7.4 with Max6 
isn't working right i think.

Apparently i should get:

ex)
4 fake pref
2 unknown attribute
2 invisiable folders
2 xml resourceFork attributes

but FSEventer for me gives 
0 fake pref
0 unknown attributes
0 invisible folder
0 xml resourceFork attributes

Any hints? 
I think that my problem is that FSEventer is not capturing the events."
