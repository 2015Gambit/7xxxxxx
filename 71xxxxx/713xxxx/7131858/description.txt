Here is a possible solution for those who cannot get these language level to activate

NOTE: DO NOT use this if you have other languages installed.
OR if you HAVE NOT installed the Rosetta Stone programs I UL'd

Instructions:

If you have ONLY Spanish (Latin America)installed then you copy this file to the 
ProgramData-Rosetta Stone folder, and you should be set.

HOWEVER, if you have ANY OTHER languages installed, then you must APPEND this file
to the existing Products.xml file.
