,epic_seeder97,2012-04-03T13:41Z,stop this shit ryzy dont reupload others torrents
,ryzy,2012-04-03T15:06Z,Said the person who haven't any torrents :)
,ryzy,2012-04-03T15:34Z,One thing ok some of my torrents are reupload by most of them not. They are a little bit different than other. Open your eyes man
,ryzy,2012-04-03T18:55Z,One more thing to be clear. The same i meant the same material not torrents
,epic_seeder97,2012-04-03T19:03Z,"@ryzy
no offence i just want to say tht there is no need for u to upload others torrents like this one this torrent is not at all seeded getting no speed 

and here is the original torrent 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6254520

i dont upload torrents cause my upload speed is not so good and so i wont be able to seed properly like ur torrent which is not seeded :P :) 

again no offence i just mean to tell u tht this is already uploaded by a kaoskrew member"
,ryzy,2012-04-03T20:13Z,"Its ok man, thx. But if you take a good look I will notice that my torrent also include sound fix yeah there was a lot of sound problems in homefront. It works this way: I download other torrrents and try to complete them. You know: DLCs, subtitles, patches, fixes.

Ok you wrote ""no offence"" but you had written ""stop this shit"" before so it was offensive. I think that things called ""shit"" and meant to be stop are only fake torrents not reuploded one."
,ryzy,2012-04-03T20:21Z,"One more thing look at this

http://bayimg.com/eAnLOAAdM

2,32 TB uploaded since 1 february 2012

And tell me that iam not seeding ;p"
,epic_seeder97,2012-04-10T08:19Z,"@ryzy
maybe u are seeding but look at this torrent only 4 seeders and 5 peers i am trying 2 dl this but i am getting only 10 kbps.my speed shld be around 250 kbps.

so tell me wht is the use of uploading torrents when i cant even finish my download. i have been downloading this for a week and have completed only 5.6%"
,ryzy,2012-04-10T12:31Z,"@epic_seeder97
If this only torrents runs for you slow is probably my peerblock fault. If your ip is on blocklists - than sorry. I won't turn it off."
,ryzy,2012-04-10T12:36Z,"There vreason why you get slow is obvious.
People are not seeding - that's it
Look at my Dragon Age 2 - Rip I am seeding now and i,ve seeded almost 16 copies of this but this torrent have 3 seeders. It is so sad."
,epic_seeder97,2012-04-10T19:43Z,"@

,ryzy,2012-04-11T11:32Z,"I didn,t mean ""come seed my torrents because i want to"" I mean,t ""you should seed any torrent you downloaded"". Seeding even to 0,9 ratio will be great"
,epic_seeder97,2012-04-11T17:02Z,"@ryzy

i hope people hear u cause at this point of time this torrent and some other torrent of urs are not looking good

anyways i always seed to a ratio of 1.0"
,james9946,2012-04-18T15:34Z,i want to download home front but i want to know this game is full working or not
,ryzy,2012-04-19T15:44Z,Yes it is working 100% just follow instruction and make sure you have up-to-date drivers. Don't look and stupid comments :)
,pakistanzindabad,2012-04-23T11:11Z,i downloaded this but when i ran install exe it just made a 230 mb folder i think i have to unpack it manually
,Vladel,2012-05-11T19:20Z,"Yes, I'm having that problem, too. I unpacked it, and a folder with 231MB size is there. What should I do?

The folder includes:
1. Binaries
2. GCGame."
