Simian Ghost is an alternative pop act from Sandviken/Gävle, Sweden. It was initiated as a recording project by musician and visual artist Sebastian Arnström. He has released one full-length album, Infinite Traffic Everywhere, which was received with blog praise and excellent reviews. It topped the critics chart for three weeks in Sweden[ and was voted record of the year by the readers at Dagensskiva.se. Six months after the release of said record he signed with Playground Music and released a 7 song EP called Lovelorn. They also re-released Infinite Traffic Everywhere, originally pressed on vinyl by Nomethod Records.

Simian Ghost performs live as a trio, consisting of Sebastian on vocals and electronics, his brother Erik Klinga on drums and Mathias Zachrisson on guitar, (both members of Light Vibes). They have already shared stages with among others Mount Kimbie, SBTRKT, Niki & The Dove and Tony Buck. Now a band, Simian Ghost is currently working on their second full-length album.
Sebastian has also been awarded with the Bo Linde scholarship for his work as a musician and an artist in the Gävle region. (wikipedia)

'Youth is a relentless assault of noise-pop loveliness, which barely puts a foot wrong.' That's what we said about the album, and we stick by it. From start to finish, Youth really is a beautiful album, and a perfect follow up to 2010's Infinite Traffic Everywhere. (thefourohfive.com)
