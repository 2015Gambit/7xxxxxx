The P-U-R-R-FECT vacation!
When Joe Thursday goes on vacation, he doesn't necessarily go off duty; especially when the hotel he's staying at turns out to be an Illegal Cathouse! When Joe's suspicion's aroused, he tries to enlist the help of local law enforcement, only to discover they are also involved in the carnal conspiracy. But Joe stands rock hard and keeps plunging until he cracks the "Case of the Crooked Cathouse."
