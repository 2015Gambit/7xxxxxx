thx guys, great line btw.

Encode:

DVD itself was ok, still needed some work done
fixed brightness,contrast,rgb and denoise
for the audio not much to say, was very nice and sync already, made the usual cleanup just in case and entered it back into the russian 5.1 track.
very watchable now
enjoy
