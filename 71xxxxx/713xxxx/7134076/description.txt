On the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with pastor and author Lindsey Williams about the timeline on the financial crash, what currency is a safe bet, and why Obama may not be re-elected due to his involvement in Keystone Pipeline. 

Alex also covers the latest news items, including the latest revelations on Jon Corzine and the MF swindle, sagging morale at Big Sis' Department of Homeland Security, an effort by the globalists to allow their Green Climate Fund front to operate around the world with immunity, and developments in the Trayvon Martin case as victimhood and reverse racism opportunists turn the unfortunate death of a teenager into a possible race war.
