,lazarusperik,2012-03-26T21:43Z,works perfectly gj gansuk like always  :)
[V],gansuk,2012-03-26T22:48Z,"glad u like it guyz, this one was passed onto another member of kaos after the failed version, and he actually made a repack what is smaller, this one even beats the smallest rip ""atm"" in size even though they removed all the movies and music. we are proud of this one enjoy :P"
,Machine4578,2012-03-27T00:12Z,Thanks alot KaOs and gansuk. You KO'd the other rip. Works perfect!!!!!!!
,jacksparw,2012-03-27T07:44Z,I am little confused here.....does this repack includes the movies and the music or not
,nipunb,2012-03-27T11:08Z,"@jacksparw: read the description dude, all movies and audio are there in the repack......"
,THOR4,2012-03-27T14:28Z,I can't get past Ubisoft presents (3rd logo). Any suggestions? Thanks to gansuk anyway.
[V],gansuk,2012-03-27T15:08Z,"try turning your av off wile installing, either one of the tools has been deleted or it was blocked from doing its job."
,qamyar,2012-03-27T18:38Z,its a great upload thanx alot .....but i think the in game language is not in english 
,qamyar,2012-03-27T18:40Z,i mean to say the subtitles and everything is in english but the characters does not speak in english
,himanshu7,2012-03-27T18:46Z,works great .. good game 
,k0rp5e,2012-03-28T00:17Z,"I have the same problem as THOR4, and it's not the av's fault, because I even added the exe and the updater to the Trusted list. My pc can run this game, but I can't figure out the problema, if anyone can help it would be much apreciated."
,rage6410,2012-03-28T01:07Z,everything is working except for the in game music how do i fix that
[V],gansuk,2012-03-28T09:39Z,its the file injection what sometimes gets blocked as some avs class it as suspicious activity so adding the game .exe to trusted list wont work. your av should be disabled or the whole folder needs to be in the trusted list.
,Kv99,2012-03-29T07:02Z,"@gansuk
I'm having the same issue with music as well. KaOsi.ExE crashes every time I try to unpack the audio, would this have anything to do with it? For me, it seems like audio.arc is unpacked, decoded, KaOsi.ExE crashes, and then all the .wav`s are deleted - leaving nothing, which doesn't seem right. Running Windows 7 x64."
,mafia1000,2012-03-29T08:38Z,does dis wotk???
,mafia1000,2012-03-29T08:41Z,"yeah , man the torrent's great ........works fine.......!"
,bohara,2012-03-30T08:04Z,runs smooth and a compress size is 2.2gb
,Pichulman,2012-03-31T21:54Z,Can someone tell me how to play two player ??????? mail me to secutordata@gmail.com
,pete_k,2012-04-01T09:19Z,"Works butter smooth. right from installation to playing. no crack needed. updates included.

brilliant size. god knows how you fit a 2.2 GB game into less than 400 MB without any loss in game quality(i played for almost half an hour just now.)
videos are noticeable low resolution. but the game itself is absolutely gorgeous.

+1 and many, many thanks for doing these rips:)"
,eaglee955,2012-04-07T21:06Z,thanx man 4 your hard work really really thanx
,bb7891,2012-04-07T21:23Z,"after unpacking, 
size of the folder is 198MB, and there's a file c:Rayman.OriginsdumpCrashf2eedb80-d4e0-4e6d-a773-4ae2c18b0583_BETA.dmp
(134MB)

game unfortunately won't load"
,5hurtugal,2012-04-17T06:10Z,"install worked perfectly, but as far as i can tell there is no game to be played"
,keeks7,2012-05-11T10:45Z,"works, superb uload"
,Frunchwah,2012-08-23T11:39Z,"Registered just to say that this works perfectly.

I did, as was suggested, turned off my AV while installing and then scanned after (just 'cos). 2 player works like a dream (if said dream had the necessary qualifications, excellent work ethic and good references). 
Thanks uploader! "
