,premiado,2012-03-28T01:55Z,why do you keep uploading this over and over again!
,OmniNegro,2012-03-28T01:57Z,"I just wanted to chime in that I too hate the cheathappens scammers. (Anyone even remotely associated with cheathappens is a scammer and should die in a fire slowly.)

I do not even have the game, but I thank you for providing another option for those who do not want to fight with memory editors like Artmoney to do this.

Fuck cheathappens with a freight train!"
,premiado,2012-03-28T01:58Z,"My bad, didn't know your doin a new version. but still update the torrent title with the updated version to avoid confusion."
,hisazul,2012-03-28T06:47Z,"meh i would if i could... editing is disabled and i cant even remove old one... oh well... this is last update there isnt anything else worth bothering with besides fixing ugly looking full body armors and thats a question of taste
adding new armors requires putting id so any new dlc that goes ontop would have issues with that.
so this truly is as far as there is to go with this anyhoo have fun"
,plastecuti,2012-03-31T09:25Z,A war asset cheat would of been perfect.
,DevilOnYourBack,2012-04-03T09:25Z,"slightly confused as to how this works. I get the whole putting the files in their proper folders etc......but how does this make the new console commands work exactly? is it automatic, as soon as you put the new Coalesced file in the folder, you press the corresponding buttons shown here and pooof works?

or do you need to enter each command you want into that exec file? because the current exec file only has ""fly"" in it, and all I wanna do is add all the DLC weapons. I already got From Ashes via Origin, and I got the dvd retail base game.

so, I put the Coalesced and untouched exec files in their corresponding folders, and I can press 7, 8, 9 to get all the stuff......or do I need to put something into the exec file to make that happen?

and Hisazul, you saying that if Bioware releases a new DLC, this will no longer work, and you won't be able to update it afterwards? won't that make the given DLC weapons disappear?"

,Jaskbi,2012-04-14T16:46Z,"How does one add armor, im looking for codes as nothing i try has worked"
,hisazul,2012-04-14T19:43Z,"put any console command you want to ru into exec.txt save file then just hit home key... it runs it... minimize game change whats inside exec.txt tab back into game and hit home.
home key is simply executing any console command thats put into exec.txt as i said before u can separate commands with""|"" so you can stack as many as you want.
and on subject of armor.
you dont press anything to add armor. if you put coalesced.bin where it should be. 2 dlc armors will be unlocked by default meaning when you get to ... armor station?... you can select them those 2 are full set armors not pieces and both are fairly terrible.
same deal for casual outfits they are just simply always there."
,Jaskbi,2012-04-15T18:39Z,"@Hisazul, thanks for replying, everything already worked fine, its just im looking to add extra armors, like ones you pick up in game as you go along, are there any ""give all armor"" locks

Thanks "
