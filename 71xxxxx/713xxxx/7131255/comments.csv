,Espana25,2012-03-26T17:09Z,Thanks for this definitely a worthy upload....good work with bringing us this amazing addon! 
,zuooo,2012-03-26T17:55Z,"Anybody tested it? Does it work?

If yes - a huge thank you for uploading! This is a great addon!"
,_SnakEye,2012-03-26T19:26Z,"I love it how PPL, shoot here questions ""Does it works?"", etc.
why not try it yourself and see, it will steal exactly 5 min of your time testing if it works or not."
,zuooo,2012-03-26T21:31Z,"Many of the torrents are shit, with not working cracks, trojans, etc. So it's perfectly understandable question if you're not an imbecile who is installing everything without thinking for a second."
,AeroZoft,2012-03-26T22:17Z,"@ zuooo 
please point me to one torrent here for fsx that has a trojan.I'll down load it emmediaely and prove you wrong.The only FSX addon that people for the most part had issues with we're the ATR from flight1 and that is a false alarm as same for any of D.Cracks torrents here.


People here are very dedicated. They don't waste their time trying to fool some one. Your presence here is very annoying.

Be smart and leave."
,taknbyd,2012-03-27T00:55Z,"@Rapterman_123, Thanks bro, didn't realize that all I had to do was to just upgrade through their site. I had the 1.5 upload, but figured you needed a crack or something for the update. Thanks a million bro. :o)"

,_Green199,2012-04-27T12:28Z,"It's quite complicated process, but i ve managed it only by carefully reading the manuals (i'm noob). Main problem, that i had after instalation, it was no traffic at all. The reason was, that i had scenery with bad .bgl files witch killed all traffic in radius of 300 nm. My advice is to read manual very carefully. As i sas i'm total noob, but i did it. Good Luck and THX to _SnakEye again for this superb appload."
