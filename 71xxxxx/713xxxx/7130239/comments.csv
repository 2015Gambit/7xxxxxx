,konx,2012-03-26T02:30Z,"I have some trouble playing this video, it shows a complete green screen with audio on VLC player. Could someone please enlighten me.."
,xts3kwpg,2012-03-26T08:48Z,@konx: I had same problem. I upgraded VLC Player to 2.0.1 from 1.1.11. It now plays no problem. Try upgrading.
,Otero,2012-03-26T16:38Z,Are the korean subs hardcoded?
,StyggaKillen,2012-03-26T20:00Z,@Otero .. Are you too lazy to read the Title .. OR the description .. ?? jesus ...
,mallrat4k,2012-03-27T00:53Z,"a/v 10/10. 

but the english subs doesnt help that much since they are under the korean subs ..."
,bigough,2012-03-27T01:53Z,@mallrat4k I think you can remove the encoded subs using MKVMerge.  
,bahlu,2012-03-27T06:35Z,"i had same problem with the green screen, i updated my VLC to the 2.0.1. version and it played fine, korean subs hardcoded sometimes get in the way but overall a very watchable copy:)
thnx for the up!"

,Vallence172,2012-03-28T19:06Z,I thought this did not come out on DVD till next month?
,HaxarN,2012-03-28T21:39Z,"dafuq, how do the Koreans get all these movies?"

,Torrents4us,2012-03-30T21:39Z,"A9/V9/M7

Acting is pretty poor but the story line is decent, worth a watch.

Thanks for the upload."
,joepa007,2012-03-30T21:57Z,WOW! I can understand why MPIA and other content-producers and copyright-holders hate torrent-sites and file-sharing. Can't wait to finally see this 10/10/10 legally and w/o worrying about The Man coming at me like one of these Seals. Balls!
,Truth_Teller...,2012-03-30T23:53Z,"a/v 10/10 m:9.   D movie is real cool deff worth watchin, very realistic n once u get into d movie  hardly notice d korean subs. Tnx for d upload."
,status00001,2012-04-04T17:09Z,"A9/V9, hardsubbed korean overlapps with hardsubbed english subs, but not that big of a deal.

About the Movie, just keep the jump-forward-key rdy as it has some very boring parts between the rather good action

The Pentagon gave them a Nuclear Submarine, it seems. For that, you get annoying recruiment speeches all over.

hf (at least with the action)"
,yogdagon,2012-04-18T20:11Z,"V-9
A-9
M-6 (the really good thing was the uninterrupted action)
Thanx"
,HerpesOutbreak,2012-04-20T09:00Z,"V: 5
A: 7
M: to each his own

however, why the fuck did you burn the fucking subs in? I mean, yeah, thanks for the upload, but if I woudda known you do half-assed job, I would've gotten it some place else."
,forex7,2012-04-20T21:33Z,oh great movie i cant wait for 1080p quality
,0100001001100101001000000,2012-04-21T20:08Z,"this is AMAZING QUALITY!!!
