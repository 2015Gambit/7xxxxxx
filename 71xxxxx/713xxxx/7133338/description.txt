Information
------------------------------

David Suchet follows in the footsteps of his grandfather, the famous Fleet Street photographer Jimmy Jarche, in a quest to capture on camera how Britain has changed in the past century. Talented amateur photographer David is sent on assignments across Britain to experience what it is like to be a press photographer. He shoots similar subjects to those his grandfather found, a task that involves tracking down unknown Welsh mining villages and taking pictures of the miners and their families. He experiences what it is like to be a war photographer when he photographs a training exercise with the British Army and feels the pressure of the paparazzi as he takes pictures of David Cameron and the Queen.
