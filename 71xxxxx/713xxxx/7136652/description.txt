From Wiki:


Black Lab is an alternative rock band founded in Berkeley, California and currently based in Los Angeles and Montana.

They released one album on Geffen Records, entitled Your Body Above Me, and scored two rock radio hits in the US, "Wash It Away" in 1997 and "Time Ago" in 1998. After leaving Geffen in 1999, the band signed to Epic Records, but did not release any material, and left the label after two years.

The band is now unsigned. They have independently released an EP and three full-length albums since 2003, the latest being Two Strangers released in October 2010. Passion Leaves a Trace, released in 2007, featured the single "Mine Again" and gained significant exposure through internet media outlets. Paul Durham and Andy Ellis are currently the core members, with Isaac Carpenter and Brian Paturalski accompanying in the studio.








Your Body Above Me 1997


Your Body Above Me is the debut album by the alternative rock band Black Lab. Released on Geffen Records on October 21, 1997, it featured two US radio hits, "Wash it Away" and "Time Ago." The album was also simultaneously released as a three-sided vinyl LP with a press of the album artwork on the fourth side.[2] It was released outside of America in January 1998.[2]

The band split with Geffen in 1999, and in October 2006, lead singer Paul Durham announced that the album would be re-released as Your Body Above Me: The Director's Cut, with an alternate track listing and two bonus tracks, as well as two minutes of additional music cut from the original tracks.
