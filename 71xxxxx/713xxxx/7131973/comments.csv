There is no consistent system for organizing MythBusters episodes into seasons. The show does not follow a typical calendar of on and off air periods. The official MythBusters website lists episodes by year.[1] On the other hand, Discovery sells DVD sets for ""seasons"", which sometimes follow the calendar year and sometimes don't.[2] In addition Discovery also sells ""collections"" which divide up the episodes in a different way.
