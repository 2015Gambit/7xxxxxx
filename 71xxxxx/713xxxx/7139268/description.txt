This clip is ripped from Michael Jackson's - This Is It Blu-ray (3D Enhanced Edition)

Amazing 3D is the name of the game here, as we see a little girl dancing and prancing through a forest, then eventually cut to random animal footage. There are no technical flaws to be found, and the amazing colors and constant 3D use make this a great watch, a good little piece of demo material that was supposed to be the last song in his concert.

Note: This video is meant to be played on the 3DS

Resolution: 400x224 (original aspect ratio)

Copy the movie to the DCIM/100NIN03 directory of your SD card
Open the Nintendo 3DS Camera app and press View Photos/Videos


Cheers,
