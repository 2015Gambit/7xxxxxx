Rustic rural charm.

Located in Snohomish Washington and snuggled between the Snohomish River and surrounding farms, S43 Harvey Field is the continuation of Heiko Glatthorn and Andreas Hegi's tip of the hat to classic airfields which we all enjoyed in FS2004. This time though, expect their usual seriously amped visuals and fanatical attention to detail this developer duo have now become renowned for. Featuring exquistely modelled houses, hangars, cafe and many other buildings in the precinct, everything has been based on photos taken on-site and there is a distinct feeling of being at the actual airport itself, such is the authenticity of this scenery. S43 also features a large photoreal area with full seasonal support which seamlessly joins their W16 Monroe project.
