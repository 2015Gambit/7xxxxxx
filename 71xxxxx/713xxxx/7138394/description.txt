This is a R&B mixtape and i got plenty more to come! I like to think the way i do my arrangement and slow the music down is better than most and again i dont chop i just screw!But im sending shouts out to all the djs who still screw music because we are a minority and we gotta keep it alive! More up to date mixes on the way but i have no set order so collect em all and keep what you want and scrap the rest lol!!! Enjoy installment number 2!
