,booobp,2012-03-26T06:41Z,Needs a warning that old saves will be deleted.
,CookieMunzta,2012-03-26T07:02Z,"My saves weren't deleted, but then again I'd already patched mine to 1.02 beforehand."
,slackass99,2012-03-26T07:35Z,"I have the skidrow patch in the skidrow game, installed this DLC yet the quest is not triggered in the game.  Tried installing the patch and DLC in a number of differnet combinations but the quest never shows up.  What am I doing wrong?"
,AlotStuff,2012-03-26T15:02Z,Does this DLC include patch 1.0.0.2?
,AlTaiRius,2012-03-27T06:51Z,"The savegame problem stems from if you use a THETA version and then add the SKIDROW DLC.

SKIDROW and THETA use different save locations for the game profiles.  Copy your THETA saves from C:UsersyournameDocumentsMy GamesReckoning folder into C:UsersyournameAppDataLocalSKIDROW102500 folder.  This will then recognise your saves."
,Adonis605,2012-03-27T09:33Z,"for fcks sake, I was in the last area almost finished the game, and this deleted ALL my game saves... I tried your method of copying from my games to skidrow folder but it didnt work....
WHAT THE EFF DO I DO ?!?!?!?   I HAVE CLOSE TO A 100 HOURS IN THIS GAME, I AM PISSED"
,gAnssalez,2012-03-27T14:28Z,"copy the old folder save in c: Userappdata SKIDROW102500Storage

Create an account necessarily with the same name that was, and your character will appear

sorry for my english. I use a googletranslator"
,Alex2715,2012-03-27T16:06Z,"Hi, I have the same problem as slackass99 i have installed it and moved the crack into the game installation folder and used the launcher but there I dont see any new quests. Any help would be great Thanks."
,BoosterT,2012-03-27T16:11Z,I cant get it to work?? ive installed it copied crack over nothing happens... 
,Alex2715,2012-03-27T16:19Z,Just solved the problem where quest was not triggering. Install the 1.0.0.2 Patch again. Hope it helps anyone
,BoosterT,2012-03-27T16:23Z,Any1 know what to do?
,Adonis605,2012-03-28T01:31Z,"@ gAnssalez

thanks a lot, this method worked, just like you said when it asks for you to create an account, just use the exact same name from your previous one and the continue option will appear and it will load your saves from before.
THANKS AGAIN !!"
,Leolus109,2012-03-28T06:43Z,"I have all the save files working, but not the new quests. I even tried re-updating the game to the 1.0.0.2 Patch, and still no dice. I'm thinking it's because I bought the game from origin."
,Leolus109,2012-03-28T06:49Z,"Apologies for double posting, but I found my problem. If you're using this game with the retail copy from Origin, you install this game into C:, Program Files, Origin Games, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning and NOT C:, Program Files, EA Games, Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning.

I hope this helps, in case anyone else is in the same boat I was."
,JVHK,2012-03-28T19:41Z,"I have KOA-Theta, along with update 1.0.0.2- Theta and just installed this DLC, and I know how to fix my saves between the Skidrow and Theta version.

But now I get the error upon loading a saved game:

""Requires Unavailable Content: This save files requires downloadable content that is not currently available. You  must install the downloadable content again.""

So, what gives?"
,neto1977,2012-03-29T04:29Z,"Hi guys, first of all, thanks for the awesome game. I want to ask why the achievements of the game are already unlocked???
There is a way to reset them?

Thanks again for the answer!!!"
,kratosvg,2012-03-29T07:33Z,"just copy all save files to here 
C:UsersyournameAppDataLocalSKIDROW102500Storage
and put exact same name of your old profile..."
,kratosvg,2012-03-29T07:35Z,JVHK theta KOA comes with the dlc packs ( fate toyched weapons and armor packs)
,surinen,2012-03-29T17:27Z,I don't want to be disrespectful for uploader but I want to ask kratosyg: where can I obtain theta version of this patch because I'm really eager to have all those dlc ( amors etc )
,MrHardbun,2012-03-30T02:20Z,Can anyone help me? when i tried to open the set- up it closes immediately. Help please :(( sorry I'm noob
,ayahuascan,2012-03-31T02:39Z,"some guy said 100 hours?! i racked up around 20 hours on mass effect 3 so was looking for another long game, after reading this would take 80 hours just doing normal quests and 200+ hours doing everything (the reckoning game, not this DLC) i downloaded it... 9 hours 7 minutes later game completed, only done 2 side missions as they were so repetitive and boring but 9 hours  is no way near 80 hours so was rather disappointed... just downloaded this DLC, works fine just doing the first mission now. didnt lose any save games either"
,ayahuascan,2012-03-31T19:11Z,"oh well finished this too now... added another hour to the game atleast lol anyone actually have any decent game recommendations?? finished skyrim, mass effect 1, 2 and 3, BF3, dead space 2, dead island, i want something good :( "
,Amtech,2012-04-01T16:55Z,"TO RECOVER / RE-USE YOUR OLD SAVES
------------------------------------------------

Copy from DocumentsMy GamesReckoning to

C:Users[Your Username]AppDataLocalSkidrow102250

The number before your old game saves needs to be the same as for the DLC.

You need to use  software like Bulk Rename Utility (google it) and replace the old 512205save...

Files with the number for the DLC.  I replaced mine with 373823 and it worked, dunno if the numbers are the same for everyone but I think they should be.

If you are not sure then start a new game and save then look in the Storage folder and that will tell you the number you need to prefix the saves with.

You are welcome."
,Amtech,2012-04-01T16:57Z,"There are some forward slashes missing from the last post.

If you don't know what I refer to then download a software called Everything (Search Everything, google it its by Void software).

Install it and then in the search box type ""102500"".  You shouldn't have that many 102500 folders on your PC."
,wymm666,2012-04-01T23:37Z,anybody's got any idea how to reset the EVERY achievements that are pre-unlocked??????

Or just gimme a mean to unlock the demo items.
