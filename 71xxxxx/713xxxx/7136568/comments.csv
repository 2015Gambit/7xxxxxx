,stinger_ne,2012-04-14T20:40Z,This torrent has no realmlist set so you need to add your own.
,Aninga,2012-04-15T01:32Z,"@nicvamp as @stinger_ne said this torrent has no realmlist, therefore if you read the step 2 of the guide i gave you beofre you will be told how to properly set it"
,Sublimin,2012-04-30T22:21Z,Why wouldn't you include a realmslist.wtf set to NE from the get go?
,Minedmaster,2012-06-29T20:39Z,Seeds please? im not downloading that fast
,nvrendhelpmatt,2012-08-20T16:04Z,"everytime i click download i am sent to re-download iLivid. I have alreay downloaded iLivid 3 times, how do i pass this step and actually download WOW through bit torrent"
,EFYOUSEEKAYx,2012-08-30T01:55Z,@nvrendhelpmatt  Lol i'm going to assume you're new to this. Go download uTorrent or Vuze and delete iLivid. Comeback and click get torrent.
