,boss352,2012-03-29T15:48Z,"thanks, work well. "
,monkeysandwich,2012-03-30T14:03Z,"Can't get it to work... 

T4MT-R3ZX4-H9FEB-PA2XU-2E285-E8KK7 works at first, and then it asks for username and password. When I registered and filled in the details, it said the product key is invalid! What am I doing wrong?"
,monkeysandwich,2012-03-30T14:08Z,"Never mind, got it to work :)"
,ahoi1,2012-03-30T19:29Z,^ what did you do? I have the same problem and can't get it working.
,ahoi1,2012-03-30T19:31Z,"ah oh well, I didn't correctly disable tropico 4 in the firewall."
[V],azizex666,2012-03-31T00:46Z,"once u input the serial key, you dont need to register for an account, just exit when it asks for login and password and start the game again with tropico4.exe, make sure to block the .exe from accessing internet"
,md.ford,2012-03-31T02:24Z,"Blocked the exe in windows firewall but it still kept getting through some how, so found out you can add this to your ""Hosts"" file if anyone else has problems.
127.0.0.1 launcher01.kalypsomedia.com
worked for me"
,Toffeli,2012-03-31T10:56Z,"Yep, md.ford. Adding that to the host file worked perfectly! Thank you!"
,Soolgoolg,2012-03-31T15:16Z,"Mine keeps freezing and crashing, is that the actual game of the DLC and how can I fix it, if anybody knows"
,Riael_Krane,2012-03-31T15:51Z,"I've downloaded, installed, it works but i can't see the modern times buildings, yet I can see the timeline and the new edicts."
,Riael_Krane,2012-03-31T15:56Z,If you take it this way: The only thing working for this addon is that you can play it and see half of what it gives...
,Riael_Krane,2012-03-31T16:06Z,"Or to put it in other order, it doesn't work."
,Riael_Krane,2012-03-31T16:57Z,"Found what's wrong: The FLT version is 1.00, modern times will work ONLY on 1.05+"
,calienteswe,2012-04-01T20:27Z,@Riael_Krane I've got the same problem.. How can I solve it????
,RedCobra4,2012-04-01T21:41Z,you unlcok buildings as the game advances in age but none are unlocked in the starting year
,ahoi1,2012-04-02T15:48Z,"release is not fully working. When you play the normal compaign, you'll get asked to fullfill impossible quests, due not having access to the addon buildings.

It's still playable (if something seems strange in those quest requests, just deny them), but less worth than a legal copy."
,AxDeath,2012-04-03T21:36Z,"Junta, Plantador, Quick-Dry Cement?

Where can I get the content from the other three expansions?

I've made moderate search efforts, but only gotten spanish forums"
,robrub,2012-04-07T07:48Z,so where do we get Tropico 1.05 ??
,robrub,2012-04-07T20:53Z,"Just installed it over FLT's version (1.00) and it works fine.

After installing, BEFORE RUNNING FOR THE FIRST TIME, It's very important to block tropico4.exe in your windows firewallby by making a new rule to block outbound. google how.

then it just asks for the key & that's it.

great game btw. feels like tropico 5, the new buildings can be too big though."
,juhl88,2012-04-07T22:10Z,"It crashes when the ""space program launch film"" starts to play, making it impossible to complete the campaign!"
,Sirxavington,2012-04-11T16:36Z,"Remember to block in your firewall and use '4MT-R3ZX4-H9FEB-PA2XU-2E285-E8KK7' to install, or it won't work. "
,dusty-2011,2012-04-12T01:15Z,"""It crashes when the ""space program launch film"" starts to play, making it impossible to complete the campaign! ""

I can verify this. As soon as the space program building has been completely built, the game crashes.

For that reason, I say: *** NUKED ***"
,Riael_Krane,2012-04-14T10:29Z,"@robrub
That is fucking impossible because 1.00 doesn't have the buildings of 1.05"
,aticha,2012-04-14T13:23Z,"Can someone please post the Junta Military, Plantador and Quick Dry Cement add-ons as well."
,Renargen14,2012-04-15T13:22Z,"Install with this code.

,dusty-2011,2012-04-17T16:41Z,"@Renargen14 2012-04-15 13:22 CET: 
One should block tropico4.exe from accessing the internet, following this guide: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947786%28v=ws.10%29.aspx
The guide you posted is the wrong guide, it is meant for blocking a certain TCP or UDP port. For blocking a specific application only, it is much easier to use the guide I link to above.

@Riael_Krane 2012-04-14 10:29 CET: 
It is not impossible. I've installed this addon over the 1.00 FLT release, and I do have access to all the new buildings in the campaign mode. So, the game does work to some extent. However, as I've posted previously, the game crashes when you finish building a space program building. As soon as you finish building a space program building, a special mini-mission is supposed to load, as is written in the game's manual. However, instead of loading this mission, the game crashes. Since building a space program is a required objective, it is impossible to finish the campaign mode.

Since I've seen no reports of this happening on legally acquired versions of the game, the crash is presumably caused by the crack by Reloaded. Therefore, this release is ***NUKED***."
,na9oooooooor,2012-04-18T23:22Z,"it worked for me !!
i just got myself disconnected from the internet and i ran it , then i put the key after that it worked...

thanks"
,johnmourik,2012-04-30T17:14Z,"What's  the rar password?
the link takes me to a scam ""free gift"" site

Thanks"
,gur955,2012-05-17T12:03Z,how can I make a new rule to block outbound on windows xp?
,Lascz,2012-06-09T11:15Z,"for those getting crash at the space video, just turn down your graphics. it works.  

on another note, i need the dlc's real bad :| still can't get em anywhere?"
,mockin_czin,2012-06-21T20:58Z,"If you try blocking through Windows Firewall and still fails, you can do it with your antivirus software firewall. It may requires a reboot to work, though."
,JVHK,2012-06-22T17:00Z,"Very quick download, thanks!
Although I have one problem. I downloaded Tropico 4- FTL, and of course, this add-on. And the .exe is blocked from accessing the internet.
But I'm not sure if this add-on installed properly becuase the splash screen of the game still says Tropico 4 with no indication that an add-on is installed. 
So, how could I find out that the add-on is working?"
,mockin_czin,2012-06-26T21:15Z,"@JVHK

From what I know, it should display ""Checking Downloadable Content"" or something like that. Start a new game yourself, there should be 'Modern Times Campaign'."
,unopposed2sex,2012-06-27T17:53Z,"monkeysandwich i'd love to hear how you came from ""invalid product key"" to working. i'm stuck at that part as well, after a couple hours i'm giving up. i'll be back later to see if anybody's answered"
,Hokrollo,2012-06-30T11:35Z,"Installed on FLT 1.03, but requires key. And the key T4MT-R3ZX4-H9FEB-PA2XU-2E285-E8KK7 and XXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX doesn't work."
,NNobre,2012-07-17T16:23Z,"Dudes,

I figured out how to make tropico 4 works without disconnecting the ethernet cable.

Just block ON ANTIVIRUS the url launcher01.kalypsomedia.com and then use the serial provided by heromaster. Block on firewall too as other people already said. In the first time, it'll ask for the serial, but after one time, it'll never opens the launcher again.

Worked with me with the Airlines Tycoon 2 and Tropico 4 Modern Times.

Hope it works for you

Cya"
,clintbeastw00d,2012-08-16T02:02Z,I have the FLT version.. how do i put this into it?

Seems this includes the 1.05 update thankfully!"
