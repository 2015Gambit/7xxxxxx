Information
------------------------------

The fastest, the most powerful, the most cunning, the most voracious . . . the hunt is on to find the world's most deadly natural born killers. Steve Leonard runs the gauntlet through air, land and sea to find them. 

A simple theme, an awesome tour-de-force. Ultimate Killers tells story of assassins and arsenals far scarier than you see in the movies. The series is presented by Steve Leonard (co-presenter of "Vets in the Wild" and "Vets in Practice"). Steve runs the gauntlet with the world's most deadly natural born killers, using six categories; speed, strength, toxicity, strategy, defence and capacity for man-eating. He and his crew travel the world in search of the deadliest animals - deadly in terms of their strength, speed, venom and pure killing ability. Steve swims with killer whales, stalks with lions, hunts out snakes, and dives with killer-jelly fish to let us experience, first-hand, the killers at work. In one episode, Steve meets an army major who happily offers arm to a scorpion and a centipede to judge which has the more painful bite. By the end of the series, Steve judges from a phalanx of lethal animals six he believes to be Ultimate Killers.
