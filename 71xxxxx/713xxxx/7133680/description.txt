I'm not sure if all of these are complete.  They usually have a tag saying
"The End" on the last page, but numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5 don't have it.  Now I'm
pretty sure that number 1 was a single page, and number 3 looks like it came
to an end, but numbers 4 and 5 kind of leave me hanging.  So to speak. 
Anyway, I scoured every resource I know of for days and found several copies
of each book.  The ones mentioned above all had the same number of pages from
each source, so I guess it's a good bet they're complete.

I went through and compared for quality and eliminated all but the very best
of each image.  Then I renamed for uniformity and ran them through jpegtran
and put them into cbr and here you go.  Along the way I found a bunch of
miscellaneous stuff and included it all as various extras.

Have fun, ya fuckin' perverts.
