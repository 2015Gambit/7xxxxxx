,Antarte,2012-03-29T02:05Z,Why LOL begins first episodes as AVI and last episodes as MP4? (and in other series the same...) 
,botcrawl,2012-03-29T22:07Z,"@Antarte Why don't you report it to the police?
Complaining about something free and most likely illegal in your area is disrespectful and I hope your family dies because of it."
,Nanostronghold,2012-03-29T23:38Z,"@botcrawl You're not all that intelligent are you. Before you wish cruelties on your fellow human being you should check you're doing it for the right reasons first. If you were to actually read @antarte 's comment you'd see that they were not criticising the torrent, merely fielding a question on why the poster of the torrent has changed file types.

In future think before you speak/reply."
