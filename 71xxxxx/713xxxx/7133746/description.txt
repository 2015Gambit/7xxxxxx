A young woman named Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) is staying at a lakeside house in the country with her father, John (Adam Trese), and Uncle Peter (Eric Sheffer Stevens), fixing it up in preparation for sale. Due to fighting between the men, her uncle takes a break, driving to town in his car, leaving Sarah and her father alone in the house.
 
A knock is heard at the door and, since her father is upstairs working, Sarah answers. The visitor is a friendly young woman about Sarah's age, named Sophia (Julia Taylor Ross), who claims to be one of Sarah's childhood friends. Sarah doesn't remember her and Sophia suggests they meet again later. Sarah agrees and the girl leaves.
 
Soon after, Sarah hears strange noises upstairs and notifies her father. He goes upstairs to see if anything is wrong, but finds nothing. Sarah, calmed by her father, goes to her room to pack. Not long afterward, she hears him walking down the stairs, falling, then nothing. She frantically searches for him and finds him unconscious with a bloody wound on his head. He appears to have been deliberately knocked out.
