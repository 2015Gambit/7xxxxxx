Assalaamo Allykoum,

These are good quality episodes. Better quality than those currently archived at forsanelhaq.

This upload consists of all 52 episodes of Islam 101 hosted by Shaykh Abu Usamah Adh Dhahabi in the UK and shown originally on HUDA TV. The amount of topics covered is very inclusive, from What is Islam, Quran, Sunnah, How to treat Neighbors, Marriage,  to Deviants, Jihad, etc. May many benefit from these good teachings, insha allah.
