Escape From New York Commentary - John Carpenter + Kurt Russell

Ripped to WAV from the Esacpe From New York Special Edition DVD and synced to the 
Blu-ray release.  Then Converted to 192k AAC.  I think MGM was to cheap to pay Carpenter and Russell royalties so it was left off the Blu-ray release.

After matching the waveform of the soundtrack up to the commentary it just needed 2 seconds of silence inserted to the beginning of the track.  So it was pretty easy :-)

Use MKVmerge GUI (available here - <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix">MKV toolnix</a> ) to remux this file to your Blu-ray rip!

This is a fantastic and educational commentary track that shouldn't be lost to time!
