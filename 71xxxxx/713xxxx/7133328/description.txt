Stephanie Lang and Chris Avery share dreams, loves, hopes and fears. Together they suffer the rigours of dancing school, the cruel but brilliant tutorship of Volmar, leader of the National Ballet, the attention of Bunin, relentless sexual conqueror from the Kirov.

But only one can reach the top - and at a tragic cost of heartbreak and rivalry.

Searingly authentic, Ballerina is an unforgettable novel of love, ambition and friendship.

"It's the right moment for the big ballet novel, and this one is it."
