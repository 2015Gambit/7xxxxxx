The License is banned."

If i found another License that works i upload it. :D"
,IXPLAGUEXI,2012-07-18T19:55Z,"@3R01 & others reading this

ignore the license message that appears as it continues to download

go through settings and turn everything off or to manual that will make avast connect to their server

block avast.com i used router to block it 

ive been using this license for 2weeks with no illegal message popping hope it works for you guys"
,IXPLAGUEXI,2012-07-19T15:20Z,"EDIT
-------
seems router stopped blocking outgoing process
to block illegal message after using license try using opendns.com setup and in personal settings block      .   "
