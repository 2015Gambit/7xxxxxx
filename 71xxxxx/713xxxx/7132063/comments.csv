,dragonkeeper06,2012-03-31T18:34Z,"I am stuck at 13.6 percent, is anyone else stuck? I seem to be uploading fine, but my download hasn't moved for days. Any way to fix this? "
,dragonkeeper06,2012-03-31T18:37Z,"@Niffy00o 

Seeders are the people who are hosting the file for you to download. The more seeders there are, the faster it goes. When you are finished downloading a file, you start seeding it for other people. You should always seed at least 1:1 (upload as much MB/GB as you downloaded. When you click on the torrent you can see how much you've uploaded). "

,dark10angelxxx,2012-04-10T02:21Z,why wont it work for me . i have windows seven and it wont open up ?? i spent 3 ours waiting for this to download :(
,wsolp,2012-04-10T03:31Z,use daemon tools or alcohol 120% to emulate the DVD
,Topgun999,2012-04-11T05:47Z,"Excellent torrent, mate! For noobs like me who are having trouble with installation after getting the files:
1. Download Daemon Tools Lite from their website (Google Daemon Tools, it should be the first result)
2. Go through the installation for Daemon Tools
3. Open up Daemon Tools
4. On the large toolbar near the bottom, click ""Add Image""
5. Open where your torrent's files are, and select what should be the only file shown, the .mds
6. Click on ""Mount,"" and the installation for TS3 should open up in a couple of moments.
7. When it asks for a product key, try these:
EEPF-SXJP-9GFQ-V9GL-VRLD (I used this one)
QMJS-HJVH-4943-749Q-8RLD
R7WW-5UZ4-D546-ED5S-ARLD
MQA2-4HQA-3BYU-L3BN-ZRLD
8. The game is installed, now it needs to be cracked. Navigate to the main directory, which for most will be C:Program Files (x86 if you use a 64 bit system)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3GameBin
9. Put the crack into the above mentioned directory, and overwrite when prompted. Making a backup of the crack somewhere wouldn't be a bad idea.
10. The game is now installed and cracked. For convenience, you may want to adjust the shortcut with these optional steps. By default, it will not go to the cracked exe, and ask for a CD.
11. Right click on the shortcut, and select ""Properties.""
12. There will be a dialogue box marked ""Target."" It will lead to Sims3Launcher, which will ask for a CD. Replace the target with this one (with quotes, they're important):
""C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3GameBinTS3.exe""
13. All done! Game is installed, cracked, with a proper shortcut. Enjoy the game."
,wsolp,2012-04-12T04:03Z,THANKS! Topgun999 SO MUCH!
,JackSomerville6,2012-04-14T11:49Z,What is the Serial key?
,arual48,2012-04-18T04:15Z,Topgun or any one. What's the serial number for daemon tools lite????
,Topgun999,2012-04-19T00:03Z,"@JackSomerville6: If you're referring to the one requested during the game installation, use any of the codes in my guide. If they all fail, google for Sims 3 Product Key, they're posted in plenty of places.
@arual48: You shouldn't be requested for a serial key if you're installing Daemon Tools Lite. Be absolutely sure you google exactly that, go to the first link (which should be the official download page), and click the green download link. Once you're at the download page for DT Lite, click the tiny download link below the small lists of various stats. You should get an exe that installs it, and make sure you click ""Free License."""
,MissJRose,2012-04-20T00:20Z,"So Ive done everything! But I cant crack it? I go inot the whole systems 86, then I dont know what to do! so many folders! hheeelp =("
,McCortez,2012-04-20T10:56Z,@Topgun999 i don't really get the part about cracking it could you please explain?
,Topgun999,2012-04-21T07:42Z,"Included in all the files from the torrent should be ""TS3,"" which is the cracked exe. This means that the game will not check for a CD, and allow you to play. The exe from the base game (which performs the CD check) must be replaced in order to play. The directory may be different because of your operating system and computer setup, but it is most likely (Every dot is a backslash, my previous comments didn't show slashes for whatever reason) C:.Program Files. Electronic Arts.The Sims 3
Inside that folder will be a folder called ""Game."" Open it, and inside will be another folder called ""Bin."" This folder will contain the game's essential files, and the base TS3 exe. Find TS3, and delete it. Move the cracked exe from the torrent into the folder, and the game will be cracked."
,Topgun999,2012-04-21T07:44Z,"Also, be sure of what type of operating system you're using. If it is a 64-bit operating system, navigate ti Program Files (X86), rather than the Program Files folder."
,zalthazar_666,2012-04-22T00:30Z,"Im running windows 7 64 bit. 
When i try to run the Auto run or the Setup exe, i get a message saying ""Invalid WIN32 application""

,halygram,2012-04-24T10:23Z,"Everything about the torrent seems to look perfect & I'm hoping will eventually run smoothly, haha, but @Topgun999, needing your help.  Your instructions were wonderful & definitely easy to follow, yet I have no idea why after I've already installed the game (I used the last of the product keys you listed) I still can't access the game.  When I try to play, it prompts me to re-enter the registration code & when I do it just prompts me again, as if incorrect.  Should I try reinstalling with a different serial code?  I don't understand why it should work while installing yet not aftwarward :(

I appreciate all your efforts, though!"

,jonnymat,2012-05-13T23:39Z,"@Topgun999: My computer is a 32-bit and I was wondering if the part where i have to change the target to ""C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3GameBinTS3.exe"" would be the same?  Its not working :/
