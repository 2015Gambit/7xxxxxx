Details:

Kids in the Street is the fourth studio album by American rock band The All-American Rejects, released worldwide on March 26, 2012. These Oklahoma hitmakers are in their 14th year together as a band, but they're still mining teenage dramatics for buoyant, chant-along tunes. From confronting a cheating girlfriend at a party to sighing about feeling claustrophobic in a small hometown over gyrating New Wave synth, pinup singer Tyson Ritter is a hook wielding bard of frustrated young suburbanites. Thankfully, his band shows signs of cracking through its own arrested development, especially in the sinuous groove of "Bleed Into Your Mind" and the sweetly vulnerable orchestral ballad "Affection."
