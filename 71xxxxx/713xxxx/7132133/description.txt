In the U.S., Central Park Media/Anime 18 released both UROTSUKIDOJI: LEGEND OF THE OVERFIEND, and UROTSUKIDOJI 2: LEGEND OF THE DEMON WOMB uncut on a double-bill DVD called THE PERFECT COLLECTION.

The series was presented on two discs.

Disc two contains the two episodes that were edited together to make UROTSUKIDOJI 2: LEGEND OF THE DEMON WOMB. These are titled, LEGEND OF DEMON WOMB, and BATTLE AT THE SHINJUKU SKYSCRAPERS.

The full runtime for both episodes was 97:37. This was nearly eleven minutes longer than the version that is presumed to be the uncut version.

THE PERFECT COLLECTION release retained the original credits for each episode, along with the plot recaps. This explains the extended running time for this release.
