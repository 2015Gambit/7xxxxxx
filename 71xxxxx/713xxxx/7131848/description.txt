What Would You Do?
When people see a situation that cries out for action, do they step in, back away or just walk on by? Suppose you saw a friend's spouse cheating -- would you tell her? What if you saw a young girl being cruelly taunted by other girls - would you confront them? Using hidden cameras, ''Primetime: What Would You Do?'' sets up everyday scenarios and then captures people's reactions. Whether they're compelled to act or mind their own business, John Quinones reports on their split-second - and often surprising - decision-making process.
