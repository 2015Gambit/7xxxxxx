Hey! WeΓÇÖre Laura&Claire, two female musicians and lifelong friends with a love for creating ΓÇÿhaunting harmoniesΓÇÖ (Not our words!) with a mix of alternative, pop and folk. This musical story of ours began when we were 9 years old and since then we have taken stories of love and loss and transformed them into acoustic songs for your listening pleasure. 

Based in the Northwest weΓÇÖre constantly gigging in the Liverpool and Manchester area but make sure to look out for upcoming gigs as we hope to take our music to as many new places as possible! WeΓÇÖre currently trying to put together an EP, with possible title ΓÇÿChasing Social ButterfliesΓÇÖ, each track will be released as itΓÇÖs recorded and available to download for free here!

Here are 4 tracks we have so far, hope you like!
 
Love L&C x
