With Windows Server 8, Microsoft have concentrated more on virtualization and cloud-based applications.

On the virtualization front, we can expect Hyper-V 3.0, which gives the ability to perform multiple Live Migrations at the same time, increased scalability ΓÇô you can now run it on a host machine with a maximum of 160 logical processors (compared to Hyper-VΓÇÖs current support of 2) and 2TB of RAM (compared to Hyper-VΓÇÖs current support of 1TB). Windows Server 8 also packs a new virtual hard disk format (VHDX) that supports eight times the current 2TB size limitation that applies to ΓÇÿoldΓÇÖ VHD files.

Coming to the Cloud front,Microsoft mentioned in the whitepaper that Windows Server 8 offers a ΓÇ£private cloud solutionΓÇ¥. This optimized cloud functionality that Microsoft states comes with new various features. For example, identity federation with AD FS, which assists with cross-premisesscalability and management capabilities of multi-server deployments were also touted.

Lots of improvements in place,so you can check out the 92 page product whitepaper Microsoft provided for a nice overview of the many new features and changes in Windows Server 8.

You may grab the bits officially through MSDN or Microsoft TechNet.
