Description

Plot: Four young people are forced into a desperate situation as their paths cross in this independent drama. Carly (Brittany Snow) and Lena (Christian Serratos) are college students and close friends who are in an emotional funk — Lena is struggling with the aftermath of an unpleasant breakup, while Carly’s family wants her to become a lawyer and she’s not sure how to stand up for her own ambitions. Their problems suddenly seem trivial when they’re carjacked by Kevin (J. Michael Trautmann) and Dre (Evan Ross). Kevin, the product of an abusive upbringing, is emotionally unstable and wants to join a local youth gang; Dre, who comes from a crime-ridden neighborhood, is smart and ambitious, but he’s too loyal to his friend to let him go out alone. When the carjacking goes wrong and someone gets shot, a tense negotiation takes place as everyone tries to keep the situation under control before the law steps in or someone dies. 96 Minutes was the first feature film from writer and director Aimee Lagos.
