A very rare bootleg of Queen's first rare concert in Brazil. 

After their record breaking concerts in Argentina which drew a crowd of 300,000 in total, The band faced a great challenge in Brazil, Sao Paulo was their only show in Brazil during The Game Tour. They did 2 nights playing in Est√°dio do Morumbi (I also have 2nd night on DVD). They played to a crowd of 130,000 this night. The largest paying audience that Queen has ever had (Rock In Rio doesn't count because many bands we're performing in the festival and it was estimated that 45,000 out of the 250,000 people we're actually there to see Queen). Everything was televised including interviews and sound check and Globo was the TV network that was filming and showed it to the rest of Brazil.
