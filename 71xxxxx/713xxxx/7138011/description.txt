Secrets' "The Ascent" is provoking and experimental (Genesis). The strong stable that launches the album forward pushes "The Ascent" into new heights. The album kicker, "Genesis" grabs the listener and immediately gets you comfortable with their musical intent. I would have to say that Secrets makes me believe in intuitive, experimental resolutions on songwriting (The Oath, Heartless Part). Their approach to incorporate piano keys is pure genius. This element elevates songs providing unexpected twists (Melodies).
