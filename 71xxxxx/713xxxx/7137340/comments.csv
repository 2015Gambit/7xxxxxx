,torrentsyndicate,2012-04-14T04:44Z,it doest work it work a half way an after i accept the mission and it say [need cd to play]
,pakistanzindabad,2012-04-16T19:14Z,it works dude maybe you didnt enter the cd key correctly 
,a16,2012-05-23T16:47Z,torrentsyndicate is right. this doesnt work. when pressing the mission button or the missions in the campaign the window of the game closes and after that it say CD required.
,pakistanzindabad,2012-05-26T20:32Z,you have to install it not directly mount and play and if you want CD key cerebral222 has posted it
