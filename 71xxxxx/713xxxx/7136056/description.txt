Description:
The Daedalus Encounter is an interactive movie puzzle adventure game. The game follows a trio of space marines who fought in an interstellar war: Casey (the player character), Ari (Tia Carrere) and Zack (Christian Bocher). After being in a horrible space accident, Casey's body was all but destroyed, and he is now only a brain grafted in a life-support system. Upon awakening, you find out that the war is over and that Ari and Zack have become pirates on board their ship, the Artemis, stealing salvage from the war to survive. During a salvage mission, the trio crash into a derelict alien spacecraft, which is on a collision course with a star. It is up to you to help your partners and explore the mystery of the Daedalus spaceship. In order to save themselves, the trio must explore the huge alien ship and solve a large number of puzzles, which are mixed with acting sequences from Carrere and Bocher, whose interaction with the player creates some light-hearted comedy.
