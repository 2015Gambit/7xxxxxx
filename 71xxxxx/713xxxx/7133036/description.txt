Django combined swing music with classical music and Roma music in a unique way that later became known as Jazz Manouche or Gypsy Jazz. Gustav has taken this further by arranging Django swing compositions in other rhythms from different parts of the world, elements of Spanish Flamenco, Cuban Son, Rumba, Bolero, Samba and Brazilian rhythms from North Africa and the Balkans. Of course there are also several swing numbers recorded. Gustav Lundgren himself plays 13 different instruments on the album. With him, he also has a number of distinguished musicians from Stockholm, Thomas Eby in eight tracks and the whole group Stockholm Swing All Stars in 'Nuages.'
