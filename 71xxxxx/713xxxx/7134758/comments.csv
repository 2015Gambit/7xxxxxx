[T],Sackilla666,2012-03-28T01:51Z,"I don't believe I have Skip Dog & the EZSD'd i think I lost.  I recently lost 25+yrs of music when my backup drive crashed on me & I just started getting my collection back from my homies that I let get copies.  My homie in Philly actually has all my rap collection & I'm just waiting for him to ship it back to me, so I can atleast reclaim all my rap.  I'll have a better idea once I get that back.  Pretty sure I did have EZSD tho'"
