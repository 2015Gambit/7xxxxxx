[V],polisdavid,2012-03-27T05:10Z,"I just scanned the (app) file with Integro VirusScan X6 and there were no viruses detected. I also scanned the dmg, and the zip archive - no viruses.

Which virus program did you scan it with, which files?"
,repairman4,2012-03-27T15:38Z,"first off, it wants to accept incoming connections when you launch it.  The real Sandvox does not do this.  Why would it need to accpet incoming connections unless it was acting as a proxy?

Second, ignoring the incoming connections, it only increased the 5 page HTML limit of the free version to 6 pages. this is lame.  What did you do  to increase the limit?  I have spent many hours in IdaPro looking at it.."
[V],polisdavid,2012-03-28T05:59Z,"My apologies repairman4, 

It does seem that this is a trial version.

Don't download this torrent and expect to get the ""RealDeal"" - it wasn't cracked properly
