This is the Win 7 driver for the ALPS touch pad driver. I seemed to have disappeared from elsewhere - it was a right pain to locate. First ever upload.

*Make sure you uninstall other ALPS driver before you install.

Extract and then use DPInst.exe

**This was from a Toshiba but they seem to work across most makes.
