Penny Play is back on the mat for Ultimate Surrender. During her time away Penny was busy training and wresting on other mats. She is not the same wrestler that left some seasons ago. Penny is coming back to be a contender at Ultimate Surrender.

 

Audrey Rose surprised everybody with her decisive win over Serena Blair, a win that catapulted her up the rankings. She trains off the mat every week, and takes Ultimate Surrender very seriously. She is a fighter, and a lover, but a fighter first.

 

Ultimate Surrender, the only non-scripted real wrestling league on the net.
