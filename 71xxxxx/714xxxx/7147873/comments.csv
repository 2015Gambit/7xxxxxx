Strange thing. I got this uploaded on several private trackers and none complained about it. Probably is something from you. Let me see if I find out  if there is something I can do for you."
[T],-Gabe-,2012-04-05T23:38Z,"You're right, VLC plays it with delay!

There is something you can do. Just install and use Splash Pro Ex. It plays the video correctly. And by the way, after 1 weak of use you won't come back to VLC. I've been a VLC user for 2y til I found this app.
