Thanks."

,treska,2012-04-13T14:52Z,"Yes, the sn works, at least. This build barely serves its purpose because it is BUGGY, code completion is broken and works for some classes/methods only. I learned this the hard way after few days of use.
Urgently needing a newer build (7022 currently), otherwise just stick to 5.9.5. My 2 cents."
