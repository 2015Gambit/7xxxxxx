T-bag, a sociopath with a prosthetic hand and a mean streak to go with it, makes a bloody escape from prison and sets out on a path of vengeance. Initially, the Breakout Kings deduce this infamous criminal is on a mission to see a girl, once they find the remnants of a shaving kit and learn he's stolen a woman's ring. But the plot thickens as his post-jail break crimes escalate. The team must figure out who he's headed to see and stop him before he crosses the border to Canada and reaches his freedom. What is it that is really driving this mad-man and can the Breakout Kings bring this wild ride to an end once and for all?
