,latros,2012-04-15T19:55Z,You should go into last.fm it's a great place to let you know among music lovers. Great music by the way!
,Klumzy,2012-04-15T20:37Z,"Good stuff, 8/10"
,DctrEvil,2012-04-15T23:25Z,"Why do people insist on praising people just because they're on the same side? Just because Monster Cat thinks TPB is nifty does not mean that their music is good. In fact, if their music was good, they wouldn't be so willing to give it away for free. Their music is terrible whiney emo shit. This 5 song EP is below the quality of the mix-tape CDs that radio stations give out at events.
Stop pandering to this band's ego just because its expected of you or because it is the status-quo among pirates to shower compliments on anybody who uploads something. Have some goddamn self respect and tell these guys to go back to working at starbucks."
,nuneral,2012-04-16T00:38Z,"@DctrEvil
I actually agree with a few of your points about some of these bands. Typically it is garbage in my opinion but what I don't do is antagonize the fans and attack the artists. I simply remove it from my computer because my tastes are no better than anyone else's.

So if you could restrain your adolescent behavior and quit being such a monumental asshole we would all appreciate it.

I should note that I actually do enjoy this band though. Music is emotion and it's been displayed wonderfully here. Sure, they have some room to grow and I'll be looking forward to that, but they are off to a fantastic start."
,Menecucho,2012-04-16T03:04Z,"Me gusta mucho el 04 The Courier, buena mĂşsica !!

I like very much the number 04 The Courier, good music !!"
,mek01,2012-04-16T03:20Z,"@DctrEvil
Well, just because you think their music is bad, doesn't make it bad either. Oh the hypocrisy. "
,ergohack,2012-04-16T07:07Z,"@DctrEvil stfu
@nuneral agreed
@mek01 quite true lol
my 2 cents. A leecher who complains is an asshole; a leecher who complains when the actual copyright owner AND creative talent gives it to you straight from the studio, is a royal piece of shit."
,abj642,2012-04-18T06:50Z,"thanks
will give it a try"
,Daeshan,2012-04-25T01:40Z,"@DctrEvil
you're a complete piece of shit pessimist.
every piece of support helps our community.
they support us, we support them."
,Daeshan,2012-04-25T01:48Z,"once i start to become an artist (which may happen in the future)
i make electronic music, and random genre's
I WANT IT TO BE PLACED HERE /

THINK ABOUT THIS!!!
how hard will it be to get a album from the beatles, or pink floyd etc. in the future, it will become VERY rare and hence, nobody will care about them anymore, or even afford to buy the actual cd"
