[T],ADHDerby,2012-04-02T16:46Z,"You can find them @ YouTube:
Search for ""3D Stereoscopic Movie of Fireworks Display"" and ""Fireworks Symphony""
I removed the intro logo and the credits at the end (saves some space on your SD card)
+ I've lowered the brightness a bit and converted it to a 3DS movie"
