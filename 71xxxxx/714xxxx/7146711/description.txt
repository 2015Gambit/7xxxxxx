Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, March 30 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Fritz Springmeier, author of Bloodlines of the Illuminati, an encyclopedia of rare, unbelievable information that exposes the dynasties that make up the global elite.

Alex also talks with depleted uranium expert Doug Rokke, who served as a member of the 3rd U.S. Army Medical Command's Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical special operations team. Major Rokke has been subjected to ongoing retaliation from Department of Defense officials for reporting the adverse health and environmental effects of uranium weapons. 

Alex gets into economic issues today with broadcaster and film-maker Max Keiser. Prior to being a broadcaster, Keiser was a stock broker on Wall Street.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
