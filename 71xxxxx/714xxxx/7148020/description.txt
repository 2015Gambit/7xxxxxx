Catholic Ghoulgirls [2005] DVD Rip

Catholic Ghoulgirls is the loosely-based sequel to the Razor Sharp Productions' controversial cult classic Escape From The Dead. Perhaps quite arguably film director Eamon Hardiman's most impressive effort to date, this 55 minute zombie film is certainly the most ballsy as it makes no apologies when equally exploiting everyone from the Ghoulgirls themselves to the current state of the media and even addresses the concepts of brainwashing.
