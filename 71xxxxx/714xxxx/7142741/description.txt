Decided to take a new approach using Virtual Box to see how it goes. If this proves more useful than the VMware builds then I'll move to Virtual Box. Should fix the Apple Logo issues, but you have to make sure to read the release notes and watch the setup guide (linked in torrent) to get it right. If you don't have Virtual Box just Google it.

Enjoy, let me know how it goes.
