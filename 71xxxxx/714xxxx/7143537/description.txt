"Oregon" 

Detective Britten suddenly becomes a 
suspect in his own case when an FBI 
agent, Santoro, questions his 
methods of tracking down a serial 
killer thought to be dead. Meanwhile, 
in the wake of her son's death, 
Hannah is finding comfort in 
exploring the possibility of moving 
to Oregon and going back to school. 
Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans believe 
that if Britten moves out of Los 
Angeles that his healing will 
progress and that his dreams will 
disappear.

Evolve...or die.
