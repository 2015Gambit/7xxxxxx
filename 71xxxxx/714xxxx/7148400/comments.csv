,Rickele,2012-05-05T07:02Z,I do trust froggie since I've d/l'ed many of his stuff..But I've never seen any torrents with so many files attached. Can anyone tell me what these files mean? Like the .png files and why there are so many txt files? I'm a tad new to TPB so please bare with my questions...and I saw this movie in theaters when it came out and LOVED it. I almost died when I heard my fave book was going to be a movie. 
,Tek28,2012-05-07T00:50Z,"@Rickele

PNG files are image files. You can read about the file format here en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics

The TXT files usually describe either the group releasing the copy, or the movie itself. Either way, these are not harmful as they are straight unicode text files.

NFO files, commonly attached to Torrents, is usually just another file format like a TXT file that describes the group and/or movie together. However, Windows usually tries to read these files with its native NFO viewer.. Simply open it with Notepad.

Other image files, common and uncommon, are JPG, JPEG, and GIF. There are a LOT more image file extensions, however, I have not seen any past what I have listed attached to a movie torrent."

Hi,

Not with this file of course but there are sometimes .srt files attached for subtitles. That's for the benefit of the questioner. I'm pretty new too .srt are the only subs files, am I right?

I'll be dl'ing and seeding for 2-3 days minimum as I always do. I have dual internet access so it's viable for me to do this, I appreciate a lot can't do the same. I just believe if you dl you should seed at least long enough for 30 people on slow connections to dl as well. 10 a day seems a likely level.....

,baz5tud,2012-05-09T04:13Z,"BTW

Just by changing to utorrent and doing a little reading up there is the valid point that also you can pause your torrent and access the list of files set fior/being downloaded and have your torrenting software ignore any extra unwanted files by right clicking (usually, right click in utorrent :-) for sure, then ""dont download"" ) and selecting ""don't download"" or ""skip download"" etc on each file that you don't want. 

It should be extremely obvious from the file sizes which is your actual movie torrent file target so you can save a little time this way.

That said, generally the files are so small you may as well just let them download if your internet speed is OK.

:-)

,baz5tud,2012-05-09T04:25Z,"Thanx froggie,

Torrent looks pretty damn good so far, and only 57 mins to download, thanx seeders :-)

I might try and ""clean it up"" a bit and attempt my first upload later tonight/this morning once I have watched this and 2 others I have to catch up on.

Disability does give plenty of one thing at least, apart from pain and dyslexic errors in my comments now and again..lol.

Plenty of time is the thing disability gives me anyway. I can't cope with the Cinema and love movies and always did before chemical poisoning caused disability for me in 2004.

I wish i'd moved to toreents long ago, they are a lifeline for me, almosst anyway....

Real bad A/V

I would not recommend "
,sdweasel,2012-06-17T08:02Z,Asshole showed texted language english.  Hardcoded hungarian distraction.  Unwatchable...  Deleted immediately.
,ftgfloors,2012-06-17T20:02Z,you're not going to do much better than this for a cam.. im actually very pleasantly surprised.  thanks.
,12scrappydappydo,2012-06-18T02:17Z,Just by looking for cam/ts surely you expect to loose quality so quit whining if your not prepared to watch poor quality films uploaded wait for the proper copy or maybe go to the cinema and spend some dollar
,12scrappydappydo,2012-06-18T02:21Z,froggie my hero fanx

It says right in the notes :
Notes -
....
""HAS HARCODED HUNGARIAN SUBS...Didnt feel like blurring or croppping them out.. dont take away from 
vid much... enjoy.....""

You need only to look in the mirror to find the asshole, for you are the one that did not read the entire torrent description provided by the uploader, which included all the pertinent information about the free movie, including the fact that it has hardcoded Hungarian subtitles (as do all the ""New Sources"" provided by Beowolf unless the encoder cropped them out)"
,TawnyLeffler,2012-06-26T11:34Z,"i almost never watch TS (and never ever cams), so ill wait for the dvd-rip for this one too.
appreciate the time you guys put in though :)

im only wondering, what happened to the promo dvd-rips that came 13 a dussin back in the days?

did the industry put traceable watermarks or something?"
,UMREBEL,2012-07-22T02:41Z,"I will explain something to all those without a brain. Most instances when a foreign language is hardcopied, it was Recorded via camera in a foreign country where in the theaters they have said countries subtitles. Big Suprise! please think before writing a comment. 

Also Pirate Bay's Domain is swedish so often dvd rip's have swedish subtitles. Sad but easy to zone out on a large tv."
