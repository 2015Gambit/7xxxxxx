,Shin00bism,2012-04-05T02:29Z,"Thanks for the upload. 

The game has potential, but the button config is broken. I'm okay with the limited button configurations if they actually worked. 

Remap to type 2 Xbox Controller - no deal, it still functions as type 1. 

Remap to anything but type 1 on keyboard - no deal. Doesn't work. 

The dubstep is annoying but I can at least change the songs. 

Can't stand using the right trigger to accelerate though. Played too many SNES and Sega Genesis racers. If I could use type 2 button config, I'd be set. "

,RXDimA,2012-04-08T12:25Z,So now they're fusing Burnout and Trackmania together. Magnificent.
,Drunkenbert,2012-04-09T21:30Z,"ok for those with the crashing problems and after the update. especially when you hit start and it crashes. the problem is that you are not letting your pc account take full control.

1.go to the installation folder
2.find the RRU application
3.right click it >choose properties > choose securities.
4. now some may look different than others but find edit button under groups and user names.
5.in next box choose users (will say your pc name) and on bottom select full control tab and will enable the game to run for you. 
6.click apply and ok and you are all set!!

i know im a new member but i have been downloading for a while just never created account."
,Drunkenbert,2012-04-09T21:32Z,This also allows you to run the game with or without steam. please read carefully the instructions

,ANTI-GADAFFI,2012-04-22T12:29Z,"Works perfectly. You need to disable the RRU.exe from connecting to the internet and you are sorted.

I am having problems with the controls however...I can't accelerate I don't even know how to move! I tried changing the controls settings but still nothing..anyone know a solution?"

maybe  the input are little tricky if you dont have a xbox360 controller, but a little program called xinput1.3(xbox controller emulator) is a perfect workaround with vibration too....anyway work perfect for me and despite of all who said this game is a shit, is not true, you have a great game for only 1.5 gb(uncompressed 3)...so, is a very big deal, very very funny and racing game ever....
