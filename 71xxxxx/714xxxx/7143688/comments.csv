,makado19,2012-03-31T17:18Z,"@bryentheartist

is just came out what do you think."
,AznAssassin,2012-04-04T12:55Z,"The Hungarian subs is the only really annoying thing in this :(
Everything else is pretty good. Of course you have the standard Cinemas-recorded Sound and the low res images but its very very watchable. 
BEST version out there thus far. 

V: 8 
A: 7.5 

Highly recommended.
Thnx BONE!"
,AznAssassin,2012-04-04T12:59Z,"btw to those whining bitches, this is cinemas recorded stuff. Dont expect any 720p HD bullshit or DVD quality crap u retards. If you want 100% perfect quality versions GO TO THE CINEMA AND WATCH IT. If you dont like it, you shouldn't be torrenting a movie that still in the cinemas. Even a monkey can figure that out. "
