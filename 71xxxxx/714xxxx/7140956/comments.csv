Just so you know, the flv and mp4 are the same file actually, just different formats, will take till saturday usually when lifetime releases it to find or make a true HQ rip.

But then again I've been wrong before :P"
,geeteebee,2012-03-29T07:07Z,"Thx for the education.  I've been D/Ling for a long time and never U/Ued.  It was an experience.  ENJOY your vacation.  It's past my bedtime, goodnight.  Thanks again."

thank you!"
,blilmot,2012-03-29T08:21Z,for me it says 0 of 28 seeds 36 peers do you know where i could be going wrong please?
,Jessd138,2012-03-29T08:58Z,Yeah this isn't working for me as well. It's just stuck on 21 seeders 0 connected.
,whmxtra,2012-03-29T10:27Z,"It's not you, it's people that download but set their upload speed to next to nothing.

Give me 5 minutes and I will upload this same torrent, might not be as fast as usual but getting pretty good speed around here so should be good and I don't limit my upload speed."
,whmxtra,2012-03-29T10:32Z,"Ok scratch that, my sources just put it online and I was able to rip an HQ version, will upload that in a few minutes"
,whmxtra,2012-03-29T10:39Z,"Ok my sources on the ball again this week, have an hq rip, it's also mp4 but that's just because I needed to lower the file size as I'm paying by the meg at this place. Will seed till there's 20 at least and I don't have an upload speed limit set so should be good for you all.

Credit to geeteebee though for helping out, that's what TPB is all about :)

Blame the hit and run ppl for the seeing issues, but can't win em all lol."
