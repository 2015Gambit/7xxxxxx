,Xpatriated,2012-03-29T22:07Z,"And yay!  You got me and MrD in the list!
Sadly, wowcabbage (aka ""WOW Guy"") hasn't been around since January.  His presence is missed.

Any tips.  Hmm.  I would label the torrent instead of using the ""same as file"" option, but that's mostly asthetics.  I'm in favour of linking to the rest of the series (or arc when it starts getting to big).  Also a bayimg of the cover helps the whole thing look more professional.  And (some disagree, but I prefer) it helps, if you ever come across a c2c book, to edit out the advertisements.  Not everyone does this, but it's a nice touch.
Best of Luck in your future endeavours.

,bucbag,2012-03-30T01:14Z,"lol yeah, i wish the edit feature worked. there was another one i did like this too, i think. 

ill keep converting the c2c's to noads in mind, it really is a kindness for most. i might be too lazy for bayimg. ill play with it in my next few ups.

thanks for the tips!"
