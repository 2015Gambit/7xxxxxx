,Gatito360,2012-04-08T12:59Z,Hi there I got a huge problem with most of the episodes. I can only hear the audio but no visual. Please help.
,Gatito360,2012-04-08T13:02Z,Nevermind false alarm. I just play all the episodes with VLC. Thanks for the torrent much appreciated :)

I also use nothing but VLC."

,azoraxxx,2012-08-05T20:46Z,"try updating vlc or redownloading. A person I know had the same problem, and I just gave them a different version (i'm guessing) of vlc which they used and it worked for them. Try using Media Player Classic if updating vlc doesn't work."
