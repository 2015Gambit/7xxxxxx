"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"

When Carlene's Uncle Burl (Bruce 
Boxleitner) returns to town with 
his wife, Bitsy (Donna Mills), Gigi 
promises to throw them a homecoming 
party requiring guests to come 
dressed as their favorite Texan.
Meanwhile Blake recruits Amanda to 
consult for Cricket and Blake's 
denim line, Pastor Tudor counsels 
Sharon and Zack during their rough 
patch -- resulting in Sharon's 
working at the church and Zach's 
taking over Sharon's duties at home 
-- and Heather is after Burl's 500 
acres of land for her client, 
Andrew (Tom Everett Scott).
