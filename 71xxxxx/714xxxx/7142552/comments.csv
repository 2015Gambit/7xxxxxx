Thanks for the torrent :)"
,Salt(1),2012-03-30T13:07Z,"Rest assured, I seed all my material for atleast a week. I'm running off of a laptop with 35gb of memory, 8gb is for windows 7 and the rest is available for my anime. I also primarily just upload MP4s and the occasional AVI because I prefer to watch anime on my ps3."
,NurseBlood,2012-05-14T03:34Z,This is a good download the only problem is there is some screen glitches when watching it in episode 3 and a few others lilt 5 and 6 but other then that its great.
