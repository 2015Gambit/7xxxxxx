,theeccentrik,2012-04-01T17:00Z,"Very good picture quality m8, audio not so great. V-8.5, A-7.
The Audio needs to be filtered as reducing your volume on your tv's helps with the background noise but makes the dialogue too low to hear.
Defo the best on PB at the mo + apart from audio very watchable, thanks again."

>TOTAL LOSSAGE!<

I guess it says ""Okay, I am computer-challanged, once the movie is downloaded, what do I play it with?""

Talk about NOT being able to get a point across... Complete n00b."
