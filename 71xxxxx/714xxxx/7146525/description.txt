Information
------------------------------

One group whose music has become synonymous with the ethereal sounds of "Celtic" music is the Donegal band Clannad. Their music has been used in movies, television shows, and commercials, heard in diverse venues, from "The Last of the Mohicans" to Volkswagen. 

Clannad have given a unique voice to modern Irish music. They have combined a deep love of traditional strains with a bold approach to writing and recording. Their legacy is a hugely impressive collection of albums, touching on folk, rock, ambient, jazz and world music. Many of these records have featured lyrics in their native Gaelic tongue, while others have been performed in English. Either way, those vocals have plugged directly into the popular imagination.


Clannad continues to enjoy success and has made almost twenty albums to date. In recent years, Clannad has not toured or recorded on a regualr basis. The last studio album was Landmarks, released in 1997.
