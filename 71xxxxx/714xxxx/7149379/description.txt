Mitch finally convinces Sarah Holt to 
tell him the truth about her case, 
despite the potential danger this 
exposes her to. Meanwhile, Mitch makes a 
mistake in his defense of a man accused 
of murder, and the error could land his 
client in jail for life. Abby makes an 
important discovery with the help of 
Martin Moxon's wife Danielle, while 
Tammy enlists the help of a hacker to 
scrounge for any clues on Sarah Holt's 
laptop.
