The following cheats

NUM3-INF GOLD
NUM0-INF EXPERIENCES

Also if u don't like the noise the trainer makes (on windows 7)  right click on the Speaker icon on the bottom left of ur desktop and open volume mixer and mute the trainer program. :) hope that helps"

you add the points, they do not save, and they don't alter anything.

only wanted to use it to get by the impossible dispels on some chests."
