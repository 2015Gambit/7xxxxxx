The ADINA System offers a one-system program for comprehensive finite element 
analyses of structures, fluids, and fluid flows with structural interactions. 

With the ADINA System, there is no need to use one finite element program for 
linear static and dynamic structural analysis, another program for nonlinear 
structural analysis, and yet another finite volume based program for fluid 
flow analysis. Furthermore, the ADINA System is the leading program for fully
coupled analysis of fluid flow with structural interactions (multiphysics).
