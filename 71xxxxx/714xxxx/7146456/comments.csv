,sunnyape,2012-04-02T10:46Z,"Thank you for the rip. A little pixelated though with some harsh gradations in areas.
V=8, A=8, M=6"
,evilg0d,2012-04-02T10:49Z,"Very watchable, quite a bit of pixelation during the sandstorm which I believe is perfectly acceptable considering the file size but the audio was extremely quiet. I have never had the volume on my tv that high before."
