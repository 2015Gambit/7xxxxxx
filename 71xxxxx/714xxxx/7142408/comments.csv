,brianxxx,2012-03-30T01:22Z,Thanks! Nitro PDF is awesome!
,tomasSC,2012-03-30T12:53Z,Does it have OCR??
,CTR-3000,2012-04-01T15:17Z,This is the 32-bit version not 64-bit.
,CTR-3000,2012-04-01T15:23Z,OK so the torrent has the real 64-bit installer but the EXE and dills are 32-bit so it is Nitro PDF's fault.
