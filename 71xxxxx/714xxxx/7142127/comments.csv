If you want the original HD quality check out this one: (have in mind tough that as my upload sucks it could took you quite a long time downloading it cause HD files are huge)

You will get best results (quality/size of file) if u encode ur HD captured file using the x264 (MPEG-4 AVC / H.264 ) encoding -
