,udumfux,2012-04-01T02:34Z,hey psspss any chance u have come across the theme song for this show ?? if so u should up it for us :)
[V],psspss,2012-04-01T16:11Z,"i say its a reg song they just used part of.. perhaps its in the credits and can google it

you can always rip the song from the video

you can edit the video so only have the song playing
then go audio and save main track as wave
or can encode it to mp3

using avidemux.org prob take 5min to do"
