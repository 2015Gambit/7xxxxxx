,SCSA420,2012-03-31T01:04Z,This shit dont work the game crashes as soon as you press start button to start the game and I have a custom built PC with a Liquid Cooled Intel Core I7 2700k cpu running overclocked at 5.2 Ghz and 2 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580's in Quad SLI mode so dont tell me my pc isn't good enough.
,Inciner8r,2012-03-31T02:41Z,"No, it does not seem to work. Pretty sure it is an issue when it tries to connect to the servers after pressing start. Tried a couple of different uploads and cracks, and the same thing happened. Other releases are experiencing the same things though. Thanks for the upload DibyaTPB, great work as always! "
,Inciner8r,2012-03-31T03:01Z,"Let me add that it is actually hit or miss. Most of the time I get a CTD, however, on occasion the game will work past the connection screen and no problems. Nothing else that I have done to the firewall seems to lean it either way, but it does manage to start here and there."
,Inciner8r,2012-03-31T03:14Z,"Ok, last comment, I swear! Making sure my PeerBlock was off and running in Vista Service Pack 2 compatibility as well as running as administrator..and everything works 100%! Track editor does not work though. But the game is good so far, pretty fun!"

,sudeep_58,2012-04-04T20:18Z,"If game crashes after pressing start, disconnect internet connection or block RRU.exe in your firewall settings.

For corrupted graphics in ATI cards just set all settings in catalyst to application controlled"
