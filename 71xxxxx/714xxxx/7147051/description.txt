           Desc: From hit records to home studios, synthesizers 
           are used in almost every genre of music. This book 
           fills the know-how gap left by skimpy or garbled 
           owner's manuals. It maps out the components of 
           contemporary synths in clear, concise detail, and 
           discusses how they can be harnessed to achieve 
           specific musical effects. Each chapter presents 
           hands-on projects that help musicians hone their 
           skills. The companion CDROM contains audio examples 
           that teach programming techniques.
