Best picture quality out of all the releases. Worth every gigabyte."
,Hasjarl,2012-03-29T01:25Z,"Great encode, thanks Diaz!"
,Hasjarl,2012-03-29T01:31Z,This is definitely the best encode out there.

Is this nigga serious."
,Hasjarl,2012-03-30T10:46Z,"@iamtehshit
Why the fuck are you using VLC, and why are you talking about the container when it has nothing to do with video quality?"
,PhoenixRuby,2012-03-31T19:26Z,"@iamtehshit

firstly, you should use MPC over VLC

secondly, learn to update your media player, its most likely because you're trying to play something 10bit on a player only capable of 8bit."
,DBZMagus,2012-04-01T21:15Z,Any of you fags mind actually seeding? Unbelievable amount of leeching going on here. 
,Sykehoff,2012-04-03T07:04Z,Seed please!!!
,iamtehshit,2012-04-04T01:40Z,"@Hasjarl 
Because VLC is the best media player!! why do you think all the nerds recommend it and it comes with the portable apps pack so I can run it on my dads computer lol.

WTF is a container? I never mentioned a container I was taking about video files mkv, avi and mp4

if you have nothing smart to say don't comment at all. 

@PhoenixRuby

Why would I use a media player from the 90s this thing is probably older than me xD

and VLC auto updates than you very much! >_"

You're way too obvious."
,kuadlet,2012-04-09T18:29Z,"Quality is top notch, but I can't vote it up as it's been encoded in a way that most popular streaming devices can't read it. It's for watching on or streaming directly from the PC only."
,Svaneper,2012-04-10T17:36Z,"@Iamtheshit

I feel sorry for you, comment all you want but you just made a hell-of-a-laugh off yourself, you dont know shit apparently. I posted your comment on 4chan, go and see, its commented all over already, lol@you longtime"

,warboar,2012-04-19T05:02Z,"So PowerDVD 12 plays all of my other MKVs but not this one, nothing happens. VLC will play sound with solid green screen. MPC will play it with a bunch of artifacts and color drop outs. What is going on? "

I have the same problem, can anyone help? how do you play 10 bit files?!?"
,MortenSify,2012-04-23T16:04Z,"Great download!

100% BluRay quality. Worth every gigabyte."
,Errorx404,2012-04-25T20:57Z,"@Imshit

He is so right, the encoding sucks... 44GB to the trash. 

PPL don't download this giant piece of shit"
,Crovax1234,2012-04-27T14:44Z,"@Errorx404

You don't know what you are talking about. Download Potplayer and play it on that, it can handle 10 bit. I play it on that and it looks superb, can't get any clearer.

Audio 15/10
Video 15/10"
,saulops,2012-04-28T04:04Z,"why this file doesn`t play on boxee and any other player (sony bs480, lg lw6500) ?

just play on my notebook"
,Gyzome,2012-05-09T02:06Z,"For all the people that can't play this on their archaic equipment: it's encoded in a high-performance profile (Hi10p) that uses a higher bit depth (10bit). Unless you know what you're dealing with, you're better off avoiding this. If you want to watch it in this glorious quality anyway, the easiest way is to get VLC (which makes for a poor excuse of a player but gets the job done).

Alternatively, if you're ready to get your hands dirty, read this guide on setting up a decent 10bit video-compatible player: http://haruhichan.com/wpblog/index.php/205/hi10p-info-guide.html"
,Gyzome,2012-05-09T02:08Z,"Errata in my last comment: if you decide to get VLC, make sure to get the LATEST version.

I should probably also point out that so far, only computers have support for 10bit. Trying to play this back in on hardware players (like a boxee box) will only result in modern art."
,Origin64,2012-05-09T21:50Z,"None of the media players I had installed could play this. VLC got all laggy, MPC skipped audio, PowerDVD 11 displayed a black screen and XBMC had all the colors fucked up (no 10bit support)

I had to download a new version of CoreAVC to get this to work, but let me tell you it is glorious. It's 44GB but not a waste of space."
,jmgmad,2012-05-21T02:15Z,"Hello,

Can you help me please? I´m with some problems when I try to run this vid in my television through my external hard drive... it show me the following message: ""...this format is not support"" but my television supports .mkv files... but not these files of Game of Thrones! Why!? Can you tell me, can you explain me please?!

Thank you in advance
