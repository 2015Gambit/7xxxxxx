great job... kudos to you pal... 
Keep 'em coming....

I know .mkv can be difficult but the encoding on this one allows it to be played on "".avi friendly"" players like the KMPlayer, with the addition of the combined community codec pack: http://www.cccp-project.net/ Even us card carrying commie pinkos like a fine western classic now and again!"
