,SoulSeekers,2012-03-29T14:04Z,Nepotu! Do you think Jeremy Lin is any good i personally don't believe the hype! The knicks creamed us bro! What the hell happen with the magic this game? Amazing quality A+
[V],Nepotu,2012-03-29T14:49Z,"I don't know, bro! Orlando lost too many games. Jeremy Lin must grow a little bit more. until to be ""Linsanity""."
,SoulSeekers,2012-04-04T05:29Z,Bro your very right about lin i don't think all this hype is the real deal..The guy is out for the rest of the season his body couldn't even hold up to the grind of nba basketball and the guys shoots 20-25 shots a game even more then amare stoudamire....
