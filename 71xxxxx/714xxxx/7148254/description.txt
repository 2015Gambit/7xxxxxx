Ancestors in the Attic S01 to S04 - Canada FamilyTreeHunting Type Series (2010-2012) Season 1 to 4 Collection2 (like Who Do you think you are)

docu-reality show.. where people go looking into the past of family trees
some say this is way better then who do you think you are?

however I converted these from a low bitrate webstream.. video is
not too bad but audio has some harmonics.. which you can improve
using VLC real time audio EQ setting like FLAT preset!

this is the rest of the programme I could source.. theres a few episodes
missing in Season 1 but rest are complete
except some of Season 4 I previous uploaded so go and grab that
to complete the set
however I see only 55 downloaded it and one only seeding it still :((
so good luck getting those.


IF GRABBING HELP TO SEED!!!

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
