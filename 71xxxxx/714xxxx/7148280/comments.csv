,moshster,2012-04-05T09:33Z,"Is this finally the all English version?  By that I mean the credits and on screen captions are in English also, not in French?"

,bob8164,2012-05-05T04:59Z,Thank for the excellent quality download. I shall keep seeding for at least a week.
,anyang88,2012-06-03T05:08Z,"actually i was wondering if all the artist high res version copy are 4:3 instead of 16:9 as in is this movie not made for wide screen, because i`ve been downloaded a couple of versions although picture quality is HD but the display ratio all seems to be 4:3 leaving two big black chunks on each side of my tv "
,FreeAtLast00,2012-06-27T06:30Z,The movie was shot 4:3. Yes it's weird but it was trying to give you the old feel.
,anyang88,2012-06-27T08:15Z,is there any 720p or 1080p 16:9 version copies out there? so far lots of version i got are all 4:3 or this film does not have a widescreen version at all?
,p.zeyher,2012-07-10T02:27Z,Thanks!
