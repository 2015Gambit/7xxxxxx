This is originally my first upload but i had to fix the files to make it so the files weren't becoming corrupt.
Thank you 'Grapeflavouredpop' for the help and hopefully this time it will work for everyone.

Personal message:

I recommend turning the intensity to max and not play for over an hour at a time. I played for 2 hours and felt like my eyes were going to fall out and my head was going to explode. 

I am unsure if the multiplayer works because i have not tried it yet but single player should be enough for anyone because of the intensity.

Good luck.
