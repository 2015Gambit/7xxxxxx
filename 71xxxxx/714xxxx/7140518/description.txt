We have some of the Vivid old school in this one. Our featured actress is Melissa Hill with the rest of the cast rounded out (some are very rounded) with Madelyn Knight, Kaitlyn Ashley, Sahara Sands, and Mia Ciccero. Frankly, Vivid has done such an awful job of the box cover, promotional material and credits, that I had no idea who was who in this film. After diligent research on the WWW, I have found out a couple things. 1) The redhead is Melissa Hill, and 2) The brunette is Madelyn Knight. Everyone else is severely blonde. The guys are Steven St. Croix, and Bobby Vitale. I personally donΓÇÖt like Mr. Vitale all that much, he reminds me of the greasy club owner from Boogie Nights.
