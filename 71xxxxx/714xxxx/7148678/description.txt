From the Infowars web site,

Alex talks with Rawsome Foods owner James Stewart, who faces multiple felony charges in California for the serious crime of providing people with farm fresh food. Stewart's Rawsome Foods in Venice, California, was raided last year and he was arrested on criminal conspiracy charges stemming from "the alleged illegal production and sale of unpasteurized goat milk, goat cheese and other products." 

Alex also talks with Mark Anderson of American Free Press and ace journalist and Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker. 

Alex welcomes back to the show Dr. Corey Gold, a former dentist who is a talk show host, nationally recognized speaker and trainer in the entrepreneurial world of network marketing.
