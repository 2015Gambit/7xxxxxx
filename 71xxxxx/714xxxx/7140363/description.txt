A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by British rock group Queen, released in November 1975. Co-produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was, at the time of its release, the most expensive album ever recorded. A commercial success, A Night at the Opera has been voted by the public and cited by music publications as one of Queen's finest works.

The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film A Night at the Opera, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording.[2] It was originally released by EMI in the UK, where it topped the charts for four non-consecutive weeks, and Elektra Records in the US, where it peaked at number 4.
