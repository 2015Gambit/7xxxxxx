My format is fail yet the only reason you can watch this is because it comes from a conversion of my release.  

Seriously an inbred brain dead idiot.

Poor piece of shit bastard that can't even save a couple hundred dollars for a PS3 or X360 which plays the x264 AVC format no problem!  There's bluray players available now for around 100 dollars which play the x264 AVC format no problem!  You my non-friend are the damn fail.  Get a job, punk. Save a few dollars, bitch. Get with the times, hoe.  Most the planet has, what is your hold up?  Oh yeah, inbred brain dead idiot."

its not about replacing older gear... its about making use of the older gear still

one can connect a i7 laptop to bigscreen afterall"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-02T07:17Z,"Keep the old gear and get a piece of new gear.

HD TV Media Players plug into the TV, connect to your network, and play anything on your PC.

You can get a decent one for around $50.

I just don't get what the freaking fuss is about going to avc/aac mp4.  There are so many devices that support it and if you don't have one they aren't at all expensive to purchase.  Some of those media players probably cost the same or less today than that DVD player bought a decade ago."
