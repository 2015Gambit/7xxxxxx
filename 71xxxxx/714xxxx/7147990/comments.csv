,beso140,2012-03-31T14:29Z,can i play this game in online ?
,nightvol,2012-03-31T14:47Z,"I can not see the content. I do not want to download the game, the update and the ost. I just need the Texture Pack and modes. Can someone please tell me how to do that? I'm using BitTorrent 7.6"
,Matinator10,2012-03-31T16:09Z,"when you open the torrent, just select the files you want."
,nightvol,2012-03-31T18:19Z,"I see nothing. The list with files is empty. It has been like that on piratebay for the past few weeks. 
I solved the problem by searching for the same file on another website and then i loaded this over. "
,GObonzo,2012-03-31T19:40Z,magnet linked files do not show content until the download starts and some bits have been placed on disk.
,fans4lfc,2012-03-31T19:41Z,"I have older skyrim,and i have a problem after playing a month ,steam says when I start the game 
something with skyrim platform modules
if I dont download the game only the fixes and texture pack,may it work or I must download all?"
,fans4lfc,2012-03-31T20:35Z,"i have solved the problem with update 8  
:D"
,jokerdude3,2012-04-01T02:36Z,"i would like to know how to get the mods to work with my game, ive also been having a lot of trouble figuring out how to start the game? please help"
,calebmc,2012-04-01T16:00Z,"im having the same problem, i click on play and it just goes back to the menu, i never get to the main menu, just the launcher."
,fire3k,2012-04-03T11:46Z,"anyone know about mega mod V1 v2 v3....v7?
what is the difference between them. are they same mods in defferent versions? if so can I download the latest version 7. please if anyone about it tell me."
,Kutra,2012-04-07T09:18Z,"I have the same question about the megamods, do I need to use all of them? In the files list I only see megamods 1-7 but the description says it has 1-8, confused."
,xhizors,2012-04-17T02:00Z,"@fans4lfc: thanks for sharing, you jackass"
,xhizors,2012-04-17T05:27Z,"Got quite a few viruses from this, after installation, can't tell if they're from the skyrimlauncher for the patch, or not, but the patch's skyrim launcher seems to create a phoney ""steam_api.dll missing"" dialog and is 800KB vs the one provided by razor1911 which is over a MB. Use at your own risk. After playing check CTRL+ALT+DEL and see how many beautiful little viruses you now have. :"
,xhizors,2012-04-17T06:23Z,"also no uninstall, so good luck getting rid of the game if you ever need to."
,tikitroll,2012-04-20T10:23Z,The update (at least) on this has a VIRUS. 
,bryk,2012-04-21T18:26Z,"So is this clean or does this have a virus? Can someone confirm, please?"
,bryk,2012-04-21T18:28Z,"I don't need the game or the update, BTW, just the mods. And is Mike's Mystic Mounts mod included?"
,SomeoneFromBelow,2012-04-21T20:09Z,"@xhizors ever heard of ""select folder"" and then [shift]+[delete]? it is quite handy"
,derpetron,2012-04-24T11:29Z,"tl;dr Yes, it's infected. No, I'm not the type of idiot who posts ""VIRUS!"" because an anti-malware program reports a cracked game file as infected.

Long: The updated SkyrimLauncher.exe file (about 800 kb) is a trojan that creates several faux-Microsoft folders in Users[name]AppDataRoaming. If ignored it eventually expands into Windows system directories and installs a rootkit. I stupidly and naively thought that the warnings were false-positives like most other cracks (this was before the other comments about infected files were posted), and eventually had to reformat everything. To be sure what was the cause of the problem, when run with the right precautions in place, it was definitely the cracked executable. The uploader commented in one of his other torrents that he checks everything with NOD32 and AVG first. He's either bad at doing that, or knowingly put up a trojan. It doesn't help that he never addressed the previous claims of a virus. If you're still seeding or leeching, you should stop and just look elsewhere."
