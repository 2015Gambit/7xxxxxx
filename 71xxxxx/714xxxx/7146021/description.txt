Sorry Supagran2,
Blame those that will not continue seeding after their download is complete.
 
I do not like to leave my old PC on all night.
I seed until ten others have downloads, then I go to bed.

 
But when I see hundreds of addicts waiting for their fix next day, it does make me feel important.
My fifteen minutes of fame. 

 
God, I am so sad !
 
 
 
 
If anyone has an old laptop that they could sell me, I'll seed overnight.
