Our eighth album of deep and mysterious longform ambient music.

A continuous, hour long piece split into seven parts.

A heavenly choir with sweeping, slow notes and deep bass.

The music is generative: 
each note is played in a long loop, the length of each loop if different for each note, so although the music may seem to vary only slightly, it never quite repeats itself.

The tracks on this album (and albums to follow) are named after Apollo near-Earth asteroids, objects whose orbits cross that of Earth.
There are many hundreds of known Apollo asteroids, though only a few dozen have been named officially, so I may run out of names from this list as quicly as I did with TNOs.

Albums 'Nine' and 'Ten' are ready and will be released over the next couple of months.
I have also been working on surround sound mixes of previous albums. These will become available over the next few months.
