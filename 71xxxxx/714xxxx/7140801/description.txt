
England s psychpop guru Paul Roland reissues one of his most sought after albums - Masque has been out of print since its original release on French indie label New Rose back in 1990 and has become a highly priced collector s item on ebay and Amazon. Now it is remastered with 11 retouched tracks plus additional previously unreleased bonus tracks and a 12 page booklet featuring complete lyrics and extensive notes from the artist explaining what extra instruments and vocals have been added to enhance this much acclaimed cult album. During a 30 year career, Roland has recorded 15 albums featuring other cult artists such as Robyn Hitchcock, Bevis Frond, Nick Nicely, Andy Ellison of John s Children and various members of Caravan. Members of the Velvet Underground and film composer Michael Nyman also offered to work with Roland whose highly original character-rich narratives have earned him the title of the Edgar Allen Poe of Pop . He also toured extensively in Europe amassing a loyal cult following and garnering rave reviews and interviews in the major music weeklies in Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Belgium, Holland and Spain as well as in the USA and Japan.
