That's not an easy installer. That's only the .jar file. My version is an easy installer that will install Minecraft 64 Bit automatically. Very usefull for people that don't want to spend much time to get a free Minecraft!"

1 copy paste done.

-No Installing-"
,fmetalf,2012-04-02T21:05Z,"For minecraft to run 64bit, you need java's 64bit edition. The fact this does not include Java's 64bit version for the player, makes this torrent a sham. ""You only need is a 64 Bit OS and Java 64 bit"" is silly - You say this torrent has what they need when it doesn't and you expect the player to do it on their own. Default computer setups will only support this torrent as a 32bit. Good job."
,FatFreddy359,2012-04-03T15:57Z,"@fmetalf

At the and of the install, the installer asks if you want to install Java 64 Bit. If you don't do that it doesn't work -.-''"

,l187l,2012-07-21T22:41Z,Doesnt work and it blocks access to modify it...
,slybulldog,2012-08-16T21:36Z,"Don't waste your time with this one, requires serial and no way to get it unless you use their software. I for one don't want to add their crap to my browser/pc. If you don't agree to let it install it just takes you to a page that is no longer available so you can't get the serial number."
