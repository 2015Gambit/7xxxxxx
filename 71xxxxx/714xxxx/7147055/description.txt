           don't want to get bogged down in a stuffy college

           It's a practical, no-nonsense book ideal for: young 
           musicians learning guitar so they can play rock, folk
           or blues; DJs who've started recording their own 
           tracks and need to know how chord progressions work; 
           anyone who wants to play from the chord symbols in 
           sheet music; classical musicians who want to do more
           than just "read the dots," and countless others. 
           Covers: intervals, scales, modes, triads and advanced 
           voicings; interpreting chord symbols and reading 
           sheet music; voice leading, chord progressions and 
           basic song forms; classical, jazz & pop; and more, 
           with helpful quizzes and answers.
