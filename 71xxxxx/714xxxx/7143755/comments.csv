,geek4real,2012-04-01T12:04Z,"I'm getting pink screen flashes throughout the video in the last 5+ episodes from both EZTV and ETTV, regardless of the player I use (VLC, Splayer, Pot Player, 7mc, MPC-HC.)  Tried various download sources including official showRSS site.  None of my 30+ other shows from EZTV and ETTV have this problem.  Anyone know what's up????

I will try hunting for a 720p file.

Win7 32bit, Nvidia GT430, v296.10, also tried Intel G860 graphics."
