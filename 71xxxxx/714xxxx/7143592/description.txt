In Bellatorus Deluxe, Good and Evil have new ways of inflicting pain upon their enemies. This new version of Bellatorus has many new features, including a single-player campaign - lead all three factions in missions of increasing difficulty. Many more cards and decks are available, and the new Village Improvements action adds new layers of strategy to the game.
