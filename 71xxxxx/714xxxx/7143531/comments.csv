All Episodes are ""Being Human"" Season 4!"
,gendalv,2012-03-30T05:04Z,what about 720p verion?
[V],manOtor,2012-03-30T06:24Z,"Usually konashine is the guy for season packs in 720p.
If he doesn't put it up you'll have to download the 720p episodes individually, I'm afraid."
,askantik,2012-03-30T22:38Z,"Netflix only has the first 3 seasons (ugh), and I don't want to wait another 100 years for Netflix to add it, so this is much appreciated.  Thanks."
,gendalv,2012-04-01T14:28Z,"the problem is that i don't know what to download.
it seems that all episodes after 5-th have audio issues"
[V],manOtor,2012-06-02T22:42Z,"^^ Regarding any issues:
The files are fine, I have no problems (audio or video) watching them whatsoever.
Just use VLC to watch."
,mulletboy,2012-06-09T13:46Z,"why the hell are the second half MP4's? my player wont play that shit, the first 4 eps were alright, sound was shite tho, and i can't watch the second half."
[V],manOtor,2012-06-20T00:14Z,"@mulletboy:
Get VLC and you won't have to whine anymore ;)"
,mulletboy,2012-06-27T12:49Z,"yes, that would be fine, except that i wish to watch them with my wife, on the tv, not on the computer. i have sourced the others elsewhere now, i just need ep 6 as a decent file type."
,folderol1,2012-08-30T23:52Z,"@mullet and anyone else complaining that it's not convenient.  SHUTUP!  You know your issue, fix it.  If there is nothing wrong with the download, say THANKS!

@manOtor THANKS!!!"
