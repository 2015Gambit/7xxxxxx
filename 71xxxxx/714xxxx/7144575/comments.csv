,Tinny_pb,2012-04-14T13:15Z,"File extension is FLV but they're H264 files. They even play fine on my WDTV Live. So if you have an irrational fear of FLVs, simply rename the extension to MP4.

Resolution varies from 624px wide to 640px wide. Image quality looks great to me.

Episode broadcast order is:
1 PelĂŠ 
2 The Jelly Fox 
3 King Tutta 
4 Phone Cake 
5 Mash Potato Utopia 
6 Tiger with Chlamydia 
7 BBQ Breakdown 

Small files, good quality, obscure show. Nice work, torrentzonex987!"
