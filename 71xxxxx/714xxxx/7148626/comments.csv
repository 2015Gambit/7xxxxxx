,dmalik984,2012-03-31T19:19Z,"@shivam03

well it depends on the aspect ratio of the source bluray , if its nativly 2.40:1 then the encode will also be of same aspect ratio and if source is of 16:9 aka 1280*720 then the encoded version will also be the same."
,hawk-eye1,2012-04-01T00:56Z,"Hi Shivram

Plz Note that Handbrake (and a number of other programs) 'crops out' the 'black bars' on either side to save some space in the file, so your height will not be 720, but rest assured that it will be what you know as '720p quality'.  In fact 720p quality without the 'black bars' is 1280x534.  So, look at the second number in the equation !"
