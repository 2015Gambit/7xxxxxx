Bomb.Patrol.Afghanistan.S01E11.hdtv.xvid-][ Bonus Episode#1, Donkeys ][ 28-Mar-2012 ] avi

I converted this to a HQ xvid.. its 2000bitrate not the usual 1000-1100
hence its twice the normal size. this should improve the
quality to big screens.. if you have trouble.. you can convert
it to a lower bitrate using the free tool umile encoder 3.x
it will take about 10min on a i7 to do it..

some are wrongly calling this Season 2 but watching the intro
clearly says missing episodes from S01 as bonus 2 episodes

if grabbing help to seed! this is a big file and prob cost
me 1gb to seed out and will take a bit longer then normal

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
its it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
