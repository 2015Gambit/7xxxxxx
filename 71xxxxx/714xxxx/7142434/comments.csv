,Norsz34,2012-04-02T18:10Z,licenses works great thx man ;)
,annspain,2012-04-03T13:13Z,"downloaded it today and it works great, thank you so much.
Once the program has downloaded you must disconnect from the net.
Open up the program and select custom download and proceed
once the program asks for the licence you must click get from file or similar because only the program itself can open the licence file
Then when you have browsed for the licence in downloads click on it and the program will then proceed to install
Follow the installation to the end and close
re connect to the internet and then reboot the computer and there you have the full working version
Hope this helps because i only found out through trial and error"

,telepirat,2012-04-17T18:45Z,"I'm already using Avast 7.0.1426 and I downloaded this to install on another computer, but as soon as the download finished Avast said a trojan horse was found and it moved the file to chest, so now I'm only left with the licences folder. I don't know if it's really malitious or Avast is simply trying to prevent me from using the pirate version."
,spunkster,2012-04-20T04:34Z,"It works but then pops up with a red alert message saying ""THIS IS AN ILLEGAL COPY"". I inserted another license from the folder; hopefully this one works."
,spunkster,2012-04-24T01:52Z,"NOTE: THERE IS A TROJAN IN THIS!!
Avast Antivirus found the following virus hidden in the setup executable: http://www.nictasoft.com/viruslib/malware/Backdoor.Win32.Delf.sfk

""Backdoor.Win32.Delf.sfk
Detection added: 27.08.2010
Behavior: Backdoor Trojan
Backdoor Trojans provide the author or hacker with remote-administration of victim machines. Backdoor Trojans can be instructed to send, receive, execute and delete files, harvest confidential data from the computer, log activity on the computer and more.""

There's probably a reason it's hidden in an antivirus. They assume you're not protected until AFTER you install it (and launch the trojan). Skip this and find a clean copy."

,chrystz,2012-05-27T05:23Z,"VIRUS ALERT! AND HOW TO REMOVE IT! 
Alright so he got a virus added with the extractor so it executes when you try to install the Anti Virus.. 
Shit idea though :]
Extract the downloaded file ""avast_internet_security_setup"" with winrar and delete the server.exe file which is the virus.. 
Incase you have opened the file by double clicking without extracting.. you will have a process called winsvchost.exe on your process list.. 
open location the process and end process and then delete the file too.. 
though the Antivirus and hte licence looks legit.. "
