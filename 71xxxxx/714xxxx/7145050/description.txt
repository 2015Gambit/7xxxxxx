Description:
Welcome to Anachronox, an abandoned alien city planet at the centre of the universe, now home to lowlifes, thieves, and scoundrels. Here we join Sylvester "Sly Boots" Bucelli, a down on his luck PI, and a cast of six other unlikely heroes on their quest to discover who or what is trying to destroy the universe. This title is a very unique game in many ways. The combination of jRPG style combat, extraordinary characters with their own personalities, an epic and brilliantly told story, and absolutely hilarious humor is something very rare. You will travel through galaxies, explore bizarre planets, and journey through space and time. There are no easy choices in this game, no obvious, predictable events, no black and white characters. This complexity made the game well reviewed (it has showed up on PC Gamer's Top 100 PC Games list three times) and will keep you fascinated and amazed for many hours.
