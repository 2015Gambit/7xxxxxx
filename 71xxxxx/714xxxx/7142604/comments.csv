,bismarket,2012-04-09T15:11Z,"What's up with this,..It's a documentary, i'm trying to find the movie. Your claiming it as the movie, you've even got the cover of the movie up. No movie though, is that a genuine mistake & you'll be posting the movie next or what?"
,cjdool,2012-05-21T22:52Z,Waarom zet je de docu erop terwijl ik eindelijk hoopte dat dit de film zou zijn... :((
