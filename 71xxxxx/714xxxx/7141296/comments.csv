,adequatelyinadequate,2012-04-02T04:25Z,Do you have some sort of installation instructions.... I'm not good at this stuff just don't want to have to purchase the software again for school. I ran the setup.exe already. It created a start menu folder with 9 different options. What order should I run them in and is there anything else I need to do?
,adequatelyinadequate,2012-04-02T04:54Z,Nvm I get it. I didn't see the new icon on the desktop. Working through the installation now. 
,adequatelyinadequate,2012-04-02T06:48Z,Finished the install opened up each program they all appear to be running fine and none of them have the activation screen. No issues so far. I will keep the page bookmarked in case I encounter any later on. Also love the installation it made the whole process very simple and easy to follow :) Great upload thanks again!

,kokalong,2012-04-19T21:59Z,"Hi
I just downloaded this and it all went well. But when I try to run the program it keeps asking for a new serialnumber each time and the last one I used can't be used again. I'm running out of serialnumbers real quick. Is there any way to avoid this, did I do something wrong? I'm new at this. Thanks in advance"
,elfenliedtopfan5,2012-04-20T07:14Z,"@kokalong when you start your ment to click replace hosts and once thats done you install master collection then replace dll files and then it should work 

the chances are you forgot to do the host files first try installing it all and do it in order of the program hope this helps you "
,kokalong,2012-04-25T18:59Z,"Now I got it, many many thanks!"
,JeMaCa,2012-05-13T05:36Z,"Thank You very much. It is a very beautiful work and installs the same. I installed on Win7 64 bits and It installed all as 64 bits. I did it with a Win Vista home premium 64bits and it installed as 32 and 64 bits combination. Please Do not ask me why because I do not know. I had to install ""hosts"" manually on vista."
,elfenliedtopfan5,2012-05-14T16:13Z,@JeMaCa yes i haven't added support  for vista haven't installed it in like since 7 came out i think the dir is diffident to to host is diffident in windows vista to windows 7

,Marcos1982,2012-09-10T19:19Z,"Firs of all thank you for this torrent, it will be very useful! I have a little problem with the installation. When I try to copy DLL files, i get an ""Unhandled exception"" and the copy does not work, I donÂ´t get the ""file copied"" message. Then I run the programs but they ask for diferent serials each time. Any idea? "
