Lyrics:

I am confident but
I still have my moments
Baby, that's just me

I'm not a supermodel,
I still eat McDonalds
Baby, that's just me

Well, some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything,
Because of where I
Had my start and
Where I made my name
Well, everything's the same
In the La La Land machine

(Machine, machine)

Who said I can't wear my
Converse with my dress
Well baby, that's just me

Who said I can't be single
I have to go out and mingle
Baby, that's not me

No, no

Well, some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything,
Because of where I
Had my start and
Where I made my name
Well, everything's the same
In the La La Land

Tell me, do you feel the way I feel?
'Cause nothing else is real
In the La La Land appeal

Some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything
Because of where I
Had my start and
Where I made my name
Well, everything's the same
In the La La Land machine
Well, I'm not gonna change
In the La La Land machine
I will stay the same
In the La La Land

Machine
Machine, machine

I won't change anything in my life
(I won't change anything in my life)
I'm staying myself tonight
(I'm staying myself tonight)
