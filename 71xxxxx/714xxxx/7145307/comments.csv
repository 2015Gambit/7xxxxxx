And i don`t use DVD sources, for the low resolution. And besides that, there are already dvdrips of these movie`s..

Anyway, I hope you will enjoy the 2 movie`s I did for you... Cheers :-))"
,eidref,2012-03-30T19:59Z,"yo man. many many many thanks for the two movies. i will of other great movies that i can request. meantime i enjoy these two greats. man, may the good lord bless you always."
,eidref,2012-03-31T20:14Z,no brainer really. if it comes from you its surely awesome. how bout air force one and victory my friend? if you could also find Alive that would be great. thank you so much
[T],Caveman44,2012-03-31T22:10Z,"Air Force One is possible, there are Bluray source which i can use.

For your request Victory, there are is`n any Bluray sources. Sorry, can`t help you with this.

For Alive, is that the one from 1993? I can`t find any Bluray sources from it. Also one that i can`t do,Sorry.."
,eidref,2012-04-02T05:06Z,"That's okay if there are no bluray copy of victory and alive. At least there's Air Force One which is a big big hit by Harrison Ford. Its so nice of you to find time to answer comments and requests from people whom you even dont know like me but keep on requesting movies. I hope you wont change even after you reach the green skull status or any of your goals. Stay humble caveman. Again, thank you so much.."
