The Tube
A look behind the scenes of the London underground as it undergoes the biggest overhaul in its history, focusing on key members of staff and some of the problems they face. The series follows key members of the London Underground's 19,000-strong staff, from CEO Howard Collins through to the litter pickers who clear miles of track every night. Drivers, station staff and emergency response workers reveal their unique perspective on the travelling public. Capturing the tube in all its guises, from tourist transport to suburban commute, or the last train home for partygoers, this series also looks behind the scenes of the tube's ten billion pound upgrade - and how the process of dragging a Victorian infrastructure kicking and screaming into the 21st century doesn't always run on rails.



6)  Maintenance 
Every night, 10,000 workers descend on the Tube to maintain, repair and clean it. We follow this invisible overnight army as they work against the clock in the four-hour window when the power is off - from hard-working Bulgarian cleaner Vladimir, who is amazed that the British government pays for people not to work, to 23-year-old Harry leading his gang of 'fluffers' picking fibres and lint from the tracks. Meanwhile, pest controller Mick is called to a smelly problem at Hounslow Central, while emergency response worker Roy gets inside one of the Underground's disused 'ghost' stations, Down Street.
