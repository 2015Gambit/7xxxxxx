These older films relied on talented actors and good scripts. True, not all of them were masterpieces, but many of the lesser ones were still quite entertaining, nevertheless.

Too many of the more recent offerings rely on whiz and bang, forgetting that there is supposed to be some art in the film. Much like the fellow who helped me build my shed - he brought his air-powered nail gun and used it instead of elements of carpentry. I had to undo most of his work and remove a good many nails that were shot through walls into empty space!"
