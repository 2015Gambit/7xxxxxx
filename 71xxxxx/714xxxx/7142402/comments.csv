,baybeh,2012-04-23T05:54Z,"Something's wrong. It didn't ask me for any key/license number. Also, the features are not the ones of the full software but the ones of a free avg software (which was already installed). Whats step was I supposed to take? Is it important to first uninstall the free avg software from the machine before installing this one? Doesn't it uninstall/reinstall on its own? "

THANK YOU!!"
,baybeh,2012-07-10T17:30Z,"Thanks tr99tr for the instructions.

Also, for the past few days I've been getting an AVG window that says AVG has crashed, and if I want to send a delivery report to AVG. Mostly I click on 'no' but just now I clicked on 'yes'. Could it be that AVG is surreptitiously keeping track of people who are using unlicensed software? In any case, why do I keep getting these error reports? The anti-virus has been running fine all this but now this is happening everyday and I'm wondering if these errors mean anything? "
