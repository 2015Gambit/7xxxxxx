In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews Ed Harrison from CreditWritedowns.com. He talks about the Goldman Sachs's prediction for third round of quantitative easing sometime in April or May and what will another round of quantitative easing do to the US economy?

Edward Harrison is a banking and finance specialist at the economic consultancy Global Macro Advisors focusing on global economics and corporate strategy. Previously, a diplomat in the Foreign Service and a partner at the consultancy Lion Strategy Advisors, and worked in various consulting, strategy and M&A roles at Deutsche Bank, Bain Consulting, the Corporate Executive Board and Yahoo.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
