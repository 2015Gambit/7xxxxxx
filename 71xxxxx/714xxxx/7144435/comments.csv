,The Real Chicken,2012-03-30T11:15Z,"I'm a bit confused now.

Is this The Devils Bridge (2010) as the title claims (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1595838/)

or

Is this Bringing Up Bobby (2011) as the comment claims (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1656170/
)?"

,e8hffff,2012-07-15T23:37Z,Stupid IMDB is full of Fags and Zionists. That's why it's got a low score there.
,e8hffff,2012-07-15T23:48Z,The Welshman needs to be a better shot.
,e8hffff,2012-07-15T23:54Z,Moral of the story is don't hang around idiots that can't keep their mouth's shut. 
,e8hffff,2012-07-16T00:15Z,Shit it ended badly
,e8hffff,2012-07-16T00:19Z,"Bit of propaganda in there in they try to indicate the Welshman is a Nazi with tattoos.

The Ending isn't so bad... after all."
