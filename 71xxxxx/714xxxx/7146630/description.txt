Note : Enjoy the new film starring Luke Wilson & Sam Jackson before it even hits theatres! Encoded from a 720p HD wmv Digital VOD Rental. Source file included DD 5.1 audio, so naturally we included that aswell. Did the usual stuff, turned out nice as always.

READNFO NOTES: This IS our own progressive scan source from a 720p wmv digital VOD rental. Not a reencode of MOMENTUM's cap off of an interlaced HDTV source. If you dont believe us we really dont care, but take a look at all of our previous VOD releases with the same quality and our own sources. With all the crap that comes out reencoded nowadays we really dont care if you believe us, but we already coughed up 15 bucks for this rental therefore its gonna get released, so if you like our VOD releases, enjoy our encode of it from our own source!
