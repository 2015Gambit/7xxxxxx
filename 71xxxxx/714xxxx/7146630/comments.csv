,zakimar,2012-03-31T14:00Z,"Sam Jackson is an a-hole and makes any movie he's in, unwatchable."

Take your malware link and fuck off and die of anal bleeding"
,Staffieone,2012-03-31T19:23Z,"@Zakimar

No doubt most of his movies have been crap especially lately but Pulp Fiction is anything but unwatchable."
,diamond-guy,2012-03-31T20:19Z,"you lot of dick heads are supposed to comment on the films, not give your fucking stupid views on actors. PS Samuel L Jackson is a GOD"
,TAP6945,2012-03-31T20:21Z,"A-10 V-10...... Really good movie! I enjoyed it, SJ is crazy in this!"
,severed1314,2012-03-31T21:28Z,You can comment on whatever you want. An SLJ is the motherfucking man. One of the best actors ever.
,rondo_h,2012-03-31T23:16Z,Thanks for a good jackson movie!

,Christobel,2012-04-02T01:00Z,"Faaip1990 your an asshole. Its people like you falsely accusing people of racism which causes even more discrimination in this world. You need shooting.

,michan123,2012-04-02T15:47Z,"its not supposed to be a horror movie...more about evil on a figurative level
av 9
really liked the 90s feel of the movie"
,thenaughtons,2012-04-02T23:00Z,"yes SLJ does have some crap films (snakes on a plane!), but for the most part he is actualy a great actor. he just has poor choice in roles....sometimes. low budget productions throwing all of their money at SJL = crap! blame the director. remember, a good drector can make crap look good."

,KosmicHadj,2012-04-13T18:39Z,"I couldn't get past the horrible dialogue in the first couple minutes. A stranger knocks on your door, asks you for a push instead of calling a tow. then his car shoots you, he asks to take you to the hospital, you go, he stops at a gas station, you appear not to be in pain, then he takes you for a drink during the am? I had to turn it off there."

,GIGABITT,2012-07-08T17:08Z,"All of you movie critic fairies need to keep your thoughts to yourself and stick to rating the quality of the upload which is the main purpose of coming to pirate and getting free shit. As for the rest of you idiots just getting here, take 5 minutes to view through the site and figure out why you are even here in the first place before typing nonsense. Will rate the quality after I upload this one."
