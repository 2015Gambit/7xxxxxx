,darraman,2012-04-01T12:46Z,can anyone please help me: i need to how can i watch 3d movies on my pc without 3d card..
,ethanpp77,2012-04-01T20:00Z,"Darraman, you need either nvidia 3d vision (graphics card with glasses and special 3d monitor), or you need a 3d compatible tv. Once you have either of those you need to manually set your monitor or tv for side by side 3d viewing. I recommend Stereoscopic player for any SBS or Top and Bottom 3d movies. 

Thank you Yify, your work never ceases to amaze me. Please if possible put out more Top and Bottom 3d rips as most people have passive 3d, and the top and bottom allows the majority of us passive 3d users to see in higher resolution. "
