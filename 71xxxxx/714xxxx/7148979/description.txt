A modern-day Bonnie and Clyde escape from prison and go on a crime and killing spree. After the pair murders a cop, the breakout kings race to catch them before they kill again ΓÇô and also before a dozen other law enforcement agencies catch them first. That would mean the breakout kings would not earn the time off their sentences. In the midst of the chaos, Julianne tests the romantic waters with one of the kings.
