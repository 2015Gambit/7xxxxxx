If you guys are interested check out the next false flag event at the 2012 Olympics  "
,JS7839,2012-04-07T00:31Z,"You guys should check out DVDVideoSoft's FreeStudio Version 4.3.6.80 if your having trouble with 2 disc downloads. 

Been using the software for 2+ yrs now and it always stitches them together barely noticable of the switchover from 1st disc to 2nd. 

I still use the older version of the softwares ""Free Video to DVD Converter 1.2.4.68"" and ""Free DVD Video Burner 2.1.2.58"" that are included in the old version of the studio manager and never update those two software tools to the ones in the newest Free Studio Manager. 

So, download the entire old studio (version mentioned above) and you can upgrade the other individual software components to the latest versions (i.e. YouTubeDownloader) if you like but I would advise to use the older versions of the converter and burner that I mentioned above. 

I've always had problems with those two components when I upgraded and always ended up reverting back to the older versions.

Your experience could differ from mine but if you run into trouble just go back to the old tried and true.

,swampmatt,2012-06-05T02:35Z,"I also don't care for the 2 CD movie files. What would be a good MAC app to stitch them together??? I've got HandBrake, but don't see joining files listed anywhere as a feature/option."
,Patriotcrossroads,2012-09-21T00:01Z,"I hope this version is truly in ENGLISH, I tried downloading from a few others that said it was in english and it was in RUSSIAN. I'll come back and comment again."
,Patriotcrossroads,2012-09-22T20:12Z,"Great movie! Everything was as it should have been. Thanks!
