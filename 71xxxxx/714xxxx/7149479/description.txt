A Mini-Library of Poetry in English

Most poetry is still better read on books that can be built to any shape or size or matter to optimize for a given title.  Still, if youΓÇÖre a financially-challenged poet or reader of poetry looking to give herself a wide-ranging survey of whatΓÇÖs around, this wouldnΓÇÖt be a bad place to start.  ItΓÇÖs curated, which means some quality control.  There are poets here who are not to my own personal taste, but in those cases they have followers I respect.  Please do download the whole thing, share, and seed, seed.  Help keep the common intellectual heritage of poetry alive.
