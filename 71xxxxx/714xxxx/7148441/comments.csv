This copy is zoomed & cropped & looks like shit!  It's so bad it's impossible to watch.  Whoever records {C_P}'s vids doesn't know how to set up thier pvr &/or conversion software.  It's the exact same with the new Thundercats 2011 ep.  Last weeks eps were just as fucked as this one.
{C_P} claims that these are a week ahead of schedule; but he is just showing his ignorance as they are released the same day they air on CN.  I'll be sure to avoid any {C_P} vids from now on!
check Wikipedia' episode listings:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Green_Lantern:_The_Animated_Series_episodes"

* STOP downloading ancient XviD garbage
* STOP download C_P"
