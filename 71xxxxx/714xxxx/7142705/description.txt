"... a stunning success, forcing us to rethink our assumptions [and] listen with greater sensitivity to what Bible writers originally intended to communicate." -- Douglas R. Clark, professor of Biblical studies and archaeology, La Sierra University

From Amazon.com:

In God, Sky & Land, theologian Fritz Guy and scientist Brian Bull take us back more than three thousand years and re-create Genesis 1 as it was heard by its original audience. With their unique retro-translation, based explicitly on the Hebrew text and dubbed the Original Hearers' Version, they lead us into the world of Genesis 1 that the post-Exodus Hebrews knew. Guy and Bull explore the explanatory concepts of the ancients and the ones we have added in the millenniums since. Most useful to the science/theology debate, the authors show how unhelpful it is to place modern scientific demands on an ancient text. The authors affirm that Genesis 1 is God's truth but does not and could not include all of the truth we have been given since then. They steer us away from trying to inject Genesis 1 into scientific debate and back to the rock-solid truth it reveals about God.
