 PLOT:
 Kill Keith: Volume 1. Keith 'Cheggers' Chegwin is a household name 
 and has been at the top of his game for nearly 40 years. He's an 
 all round entertainer and has lived with us via our TV screens on 
 Swap Shop as kids through to GMTV as parents. He is undoubtedly a 
 national treasure, and for nearly four decades has been much 
 loved by viewers young and old. The year is 2010 and hidden away 
 in a damp dark and blood stain cellar is a stranger, a man, a 
 figure in the dark, someone we'd rather not know. He sits 
 through the small hours torturing himself watching Swap Shop 
 on fast forward over and over again. Cheggers Plays Pop posters 
 decorate the cellar walls. The stranger moves slowly around his 
 memorabilia filled shrine; terrifying equipment of torture fill 
 the cellar together with several slabs of dead meat hanging from 
 meat hooks. In the corner a man is bound and gagged in a cage 
 while being subjected to archive TV clips of Keith Chegwin...
