Thank you!"
,jctcom,2012-04-03T18:33Z,Thanks for the up.  But I will wait for one that is not rar'd.  Still don't understand why you keep Raring them.  There is no point to it and it's a waste of hard drive space.  Or worse yet people delete the seed to save hard drive space and so there are less seeders for these rar'd torrents.  Please stop RARing it doesn't make any sense at all.
