I imagine you'd need a reader application that the tablet supports.  Beyond that, I don't know.

@tantonj
A quick pirate search shows that blackhawks 7 and firestorm 7 were posted by  thepiratebay.se/user/bucbag  approximately 2 hours before you requested it and ichiro posted the collection, if you want to grab the individual issues rather than picking through the whole week."
