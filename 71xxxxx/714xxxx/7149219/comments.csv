,realpeh,2012-04-05T02:50Z,"@samgirl its real, the full episode with 2 hours is 50 minutes of episode and + 1h with extras"
,jose15458,2012-04-05T03:16Z,How did you get the final episode before the air date?
,elietania,2012-04-05T04:02Z,theres stuff missing in that episode wait for a good upload tonight ... its only a 51 minute episode that one .. the last episode supose to be 2 hour!
,jordanh13,2012-04-05T04:20Z,"how did you get this before the air date?! also for everyone saying it's not real, it is. the episode went for 50 minutes and there was an hour of extras with the cast looking back on the show."
,masterpeace,2012-04-05T10:14Z,yes this is real BUT it doesn't include the cast interviews which were before the final episode tonight. 
,masterpeace,2012-04-05T10:16Z,this is a dvdrip. the dvd comes out april 10th guess they got it early and uploaded the episode. they should have included the extras.
,Leyla15,2012-04-05T12:26Z,"since you got the DVD sooner than most people, could you PLEASE put up all the extra material ?

THANKS !"
