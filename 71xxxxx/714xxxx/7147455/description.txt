Dan White is a leadership development consultant and global learning 
and organisational development director at pharmaceutical company 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

This book is unlike any other management book on the market. In a crowded market place full of well-intentioned books with advice and guidance on how to be a better leader, The Terrible Leader goes completely against the grain. In this irreverent, funny, challenging and at times caustic look at leadership, Dan White creates the anti-leader the worst possible manager you could imagine and encounter in the workplace! This is the manager whose style is autocratic, who makes employees miserable every day, who abuses his power, who enjoys tribunals, and who thrives in a blame culture. Creating this worst-case scenario of leadership is in fact not so difficult (and is often clearer than the right thing). But it is by looking at the dark side which then allows us to examine the opposite of Terrible with greater clarity, to gain insight into the Sensible. If you want to be a great leader, first study the terrible leader and learn.
