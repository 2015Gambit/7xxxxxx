,Nasuteru,2012-04-02T00:29Z,"I have one question - could you try to encode the episodes in mkv container? It will allow you, if you use m2ts rip from tv, to preserve the quality and enhance f.e. the lvl of encoding in H264 from High4.0 to High5.1 and set the bitrate slightly higher, because mkv has smaller filesize. I know you may lose the compatibility with some DVD players or other non-PC devices, but if you encode in 1080p I assume that you have quality in 1st place. Think about it."

i will see what i can do about it, but i can't promise anything. =(
Maybe i can upload both, but it will be sended with a lower rate at max 3mb/s"
,Nasuteru,2012-04-03T00:08Z,"@lolejudo Don't force yourself, it was just a sugestion, but it can really help with quality(it should even be easier, because mkv can contain almost every format). I have another question - will you be angry if I use your video, add subs in my language and post it somewhere?  Also, I forgot to say earlier - great torrent and great speed - please keep up with good work^^"
,musclestud1,2012-04-03T03:05Z,thank you soooo sooo much!!!
,loledujo,2012-04-03T18:01Z,"@Nasuteru
Sure you can =)
"""" post it somewhere? """"
Can you say where? =)"
,loledujo,2012-04-03T18:24Z,"@Nasuteru
And also.
If MKV file is a must for you, you can always wait for PHR16384 to upload.
He normaly use it, but he is a little slow to upload his torrents, sadly.
One of the main reasons i started to upload, so pep like you and me can watch the episodes as fast as possible and in 1080P"
,Nasuteru,2012-04-04T00:48Z,"@loledujo I sometimes translate anime from english, and thought that maybe i will translate MLP too, because there are only 2-3 people who translate it and they take too much time. By somewhere i meant f.e. some sharing site(warez type) or maybe torrent site. I didn't think that far yet^^
I know PHR16384 uploads, 'cause i usually w8 for them, but i'm growing more and more impatient week by week:D"
,THEBADGUY1988,2012-04-08T01:26Z,"Good torrent. I always dl PHRs, but he have been very late with the upload. But this will do just fine!
And you even got ep24 up to! Thanks mate!"
