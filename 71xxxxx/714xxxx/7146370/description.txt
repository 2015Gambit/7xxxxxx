749 DOS games+DOSBox+Frontend for Windows *PRE-CONFIGURED CLICK AND RUN*

Here's something new to PirateBay. 749 DOS games, setup to work with the emulator DOSBox (so you can play them in Windows).

What's unique is that each game is already pre-configured to work with a single click. Other torrents require you to manually configure EACH game. Here, it's all been done for you.

A front-end is included, the *amazing* D-Fend Reloaded. You can view your games by company, year, genre etc, and screenshots and boxshots are included for many games.

List of games is shown after this text.

If you download this, then please comment to let others know that it works.

Sorry that it's a single RAR. But there are over 70,000 files. And I didn't want to RAR each game, as I imagine that most people will download everything.

You can manually add DOS games to D-Fend. The configured game can then be exported as a package. Share your pre-configured games! Eventually we can have every DOS game configured to play with a single click.
