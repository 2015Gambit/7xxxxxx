,Louis771,2012-06-27T14:39Z,OldGameIsBestGame:  Thank you!
,Dinky_Peters,2012-07-08T03:40Z,i really hate that this is one huge fucking rar. i have to download the whole damn thing to do anything with it.
,blombardo,2012-07-26T00:58Z,the reason a huge rar is a good idea  - is so that all the games stay available - not just the 'good /popular ones ' - yes it is a pain - but it is for the greater good...  These kind of things get modified upon use so they would corrupt the torrent of people tried using them - then sharing them after playing... its not like a wbfs file...  THANKS
,blombardo,2012-07-27T02:01Z,AWESOME work - amazing collection - works great on windows 7 64bit - if playing laura bow 1 choose Celie (top left) to bypass copy protection
,blombardo,2012-08-16T22:13Z,Oh be sure your anti-virus is up and running... I installed this on 6 computers already - one had the AV turned off = and boom... 4 hours worth of virus removal - really nasty one hidden in there someplace - SCAN THE SET... = has no effect on my Avast pc running with Malwarebytes and Spybot...  killed my kids pc...
