Journey To The Beginning Of Time (USA - 1960)

Adventure / Live-Action / Family / Sci-Fi


NOTE:  At the same time but separately I am uploading the original
1955 Czechoslovakia version "Cesta do praveku" with Czech audio and
optional Russian and English subtitles, the original version has
distinct and interesting differences from this partially re-filmed 1960
USA version - both versions are enjoyable and worthy of collecting.

written by. . . . William Cayton, J.A. Novotny, Karel Zeman

although very watchable do not expect remastered quality, file appears
to be a VHSrip from an older film print, it is mp4 and plays with VLC


Four young boys visit the American Museum of Natural History in New York
City. After viewing the dinosaur skeletons, they rent a rowboat at the
lake in Central Park. They enter a cave, and come out on the other side
into a strange new world.

Produced using a combination of 2-D and 3-D models, it was the first of
Zeman's productions to include actors in conjunction with stop-motion and
special effects, and won awards at the International Film Festivals of
Venice and Mannheim.
