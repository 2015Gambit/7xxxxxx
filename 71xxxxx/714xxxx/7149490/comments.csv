not searchable = impossible to find."
,dududus,2012-04-09T08:22Z,"Also, no torrent over 50 gb ever gets seeded.. let alone one this massive where most people already have half the titles. 

People will choose the 5-10 games they dont yet have and never be seeders, so either you have to seed for everyone for a few months or the torrent will die.. 

My advice, delete this and start again. But thanks for the effort! You have a lot to share so do it properly and the torrents will still be alive in 2 years time."
,Shanther,2012-04-10T15:26Z,I download a lot so I will be seeding until it starts to die...I have a couple of titles that took me ages to find and the biggest collection anywhere...I know I should split it up but that wouldn't be as fun in my eyes even though it would be more practical. I will even be setting up a second computer hosting 50% of the torrent to seed at a second location to double the upload speed...I can only hope a couple of people seed as there downloading so it doesn't die as quickly...fingers crossed...and to seeders be smart and seed...even if it's only a couple of games. 
,Shanther,2012-09-18T12:48Z,It's almost fully uploaded at last...a few more hours and it will be 100%...enjoy people as it took me 5 months to upload.
