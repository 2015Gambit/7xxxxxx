i just wanted to tell that i think the video u upload is not complete. Its duration is 59 minutes and in wikipedia u can see that the duration of KCA is 90 minutes. "
,j7lr,2012-04-02T15:41Z,This isn't the full version. It's only 'bout 20 minutes long. Don{t download.Wait for the complete version
,gorira5769,2012-04-04T06:15Z,"This is a full version, it is not only 20 minutes long, and its not suppose to be 90 minutes, sure its 90 minutes if you count all the commercials that went on, but the actuall time is 59 minutes and some secons. Good Upload"
