Despite its title with the word "Banned" in, it has been shown on reality tv as well as many European/Asian TV news channels when most of the things happened. It is banned in the United Kingdom by the BBFC because they argue that the footage was presented as entertainment.

Whatever current relevance the images might have had when they were originally photographed has been lost in the general compilation of horrors".
