Narratives:

Dave BarnesÆ acoustic-based sound gets a modern pop makeover on Stories to Tell, but his music remains rooted in down-home rhythms and everyday lyric themes. The Mississippi-raised singer/songwriter continues his knack for capturing romantic themes from a Christian perspective, offering his tales of young love and family life with an easygoing demeanor. With bright synth textures and rippling programmed grooves, producer John Fields adds a radio-friendly sheen to BarnesÆs latest tunes without obscuring their plainspoken charm. Whether heÆs delivering a soulful plea for forgiveness (ôWhite Flagö), daydreaming about domestic bliss in the country (ôLove Will Be Enough for Usö), or cuddling with his sweetheart under a Southern moon (ôWarm Heart in a Cold Worldö), Barnes can be simultaneously wholesome and seductive. Regretful tracks like ôMissing Youö and ôSeventeenö add some blue notes to the prevailing mood of happiness. In ôMine to Loveö and ôOne of Us,ö Barnes celebrates a child's birth with warmth and gratitude.
