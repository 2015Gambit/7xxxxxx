So what makes these different from the ones available for free from Shrapnel?

These have all patches pre-installed (up to 5.0 and 6.0 respectively) to save you the hassle of installing them one by one, also include missing mission and campaign descriptions and PDF manuals, work in CD mode without free version limitations.
