,D0gmeat,2012-03-29T22:41Z,Is this the CD version i.e. you can play at the higher resolutions?
,jayjay66,2012-03-30T20:27Z,"I already had the free versions of these and i was wondering whether these were the full CD versions with the higher resolutions.

I've given them a try and they are! Resolutions up to 1600 x 1280. 

Thanks a lot TacticalBro- nice upload! Still the best hex based wargames ever made imo!"
