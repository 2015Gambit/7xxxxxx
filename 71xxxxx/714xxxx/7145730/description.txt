 Four In A Bed is a reality series which sees four different bed and breakfast 
 business owners competing each week to be crowned the best bed and breakfast 
 business each week. The different owners visit and stay at each business and 
 at the end of their stay pay what they think the stay was worth. The series is 
 an afternoon version of the popular prime time series Three In A Bed.
