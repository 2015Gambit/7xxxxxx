You already know this was included on the dvd as 525, so all there is to
explain is why we are still releasing after DVDRip.XviD. This comes from
a much higher quality than DVD source, and thanks to the usage of x264
AAC is a much higher quality final encode. We included a cut from the
dvdrip to match our sample, and as can plainly be seen, the difference is
night and day. [Not REWARDS fault, jsut the outdated format's fault]

As we continue advancing forward with SD x264 you will continue to see
HDTV.x264 SD releases being of higher quality than DVDRip.XviD. Let the
good times roll
