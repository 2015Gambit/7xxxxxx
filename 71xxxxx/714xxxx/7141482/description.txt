"Something Black, Something Blue"

Alex and Whitney head to City Hall to 
make it official, but finding out that 
Whitney's driver's license is expired 
sparks a chain of unusual events that 
interfere with their plans to wed. 
Later, Whitney's dad seemingly comes to 
the rescue, but it may be too late. 
Elsewhere, Neal and Lily lead Mark to 
confess his feelings for Roxanne. 

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
