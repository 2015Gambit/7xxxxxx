Heavy Mental 1 features the playing of studio drummer Tony Morra and the
massive acoustics of the Big Boy Room at The Sound Kitchen. Drummer Tony
Morra puts his heart and soul into this collection. It must be experienced
to be believed!

"Each multitrack loop is split into tracks that can be mixed at will. You
get mono Kick, Snare, and Hat tracks, and stereo Toms, Overheads, Room
Big Room, and "Gak" tracks. Besides verses, choruses, fills, bridges
intros, and endings, each song has Punctuation Mark loops, which consist
of bass-drum and cymbal accents. Some songs have Crash and Burn endings in
which Morra fills wildly. All have Bash tracks, in which he keeps time but
hits cymbals on all the downbeats. Including drum solos in a loop library
was a novel idea. You get three solos: two that are less than 30 seconds
long, and a third lasts for more than two minutes. Morra blazes through
them...the solos have lots of cool parts that could be cut up and used for
fills or in other short sections." From EM's Discrete Drums Heavy Mental
