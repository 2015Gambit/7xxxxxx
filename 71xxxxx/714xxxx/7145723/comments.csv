,TheHealingDr,2012-04-02T23:32Z,"@exodus67, I just want you to know I created this account simply as a favour to you: You are being an arse - stop it.
Firstly MKV files mean having something of great quality in an awesomely sized package (in this case, smaller is better - don't let people tell you otherwise ;) )
Secondly, the subtitles can be removed by right clicking in VLC, going to VIDEO > SUBTITLES > OFF.
Or just delete the included file in the folder ;)

Have a nice day, and let's give Anonymous a massive thanks for the upload.. thank you Anon. :D"
