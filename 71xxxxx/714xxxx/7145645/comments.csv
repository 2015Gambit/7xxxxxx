I figured out how to make tropico 4 works without disconnecting the ethernet cable.

Just block ON ANTIVIRUS the url launcher01.kalypsomedia.com and then use the serial provided by heromaster. Block on firewall too as other people already said. In the first time, it'll ask for the serial, but after one time, it'll never opens the launcher again.

Worked with me with the Airlines Tycoon 2 and Tropico 4 Modern Times.

Hope it works for you

Cya"
