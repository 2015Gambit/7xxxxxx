- ARTIST
Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 ΓÇô June 25, 2009), often referred to as the King of Pop,  was the most successful entertainer of all time. His contribution to music, dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The seventh child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of The Jackson 5, then the Jacksons in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971.
In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. 
He has sold over 750 million records worldwide (Thriller is the best-selling album of all time with more than 110 million)
