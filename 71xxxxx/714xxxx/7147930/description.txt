30 years ago, to the scruffy Irish poet Shane MacGowan, for those who do not know it , singer of The Pogues, doctors gave him six weeks of life. Diagnosis that  fortunately, not  fulfilled   and during all this years only  lost some teeth
As any fan of The Pogues you may imagine,that  the story of Shane MacGowan was meant to be funny, sad, exhilarating, depressing, but  also absolutely irresistible.
This is an excellent testimony to the marvelous  elevation,  sometimes sad , of  Shane MacGowan┬┤s world. This is a compelling story and honestly, beautifully shot and carefully constructed , from  Irish poet who was able to develop that particular sonorous mix of punk and traditional Irish music, I hope you enjoy it ...
