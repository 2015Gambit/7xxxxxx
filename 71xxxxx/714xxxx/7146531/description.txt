TeamViewer is an intuitive, fast and secure application for remote control and meetings. As an all-in-one solution, TeamViewer can be used to:

- Provide ad-hoc remote support to colleagues, friends, or customers.

- Administer Windows servers and workstations. You can run TeamViewer as a Windows system service. This allows you to access your computer even before you log into Windows. 

- Connect to other platforms such as Mac OS X and Linux. 

- Connect from Android or iOS mobile devices to Windows, Mac or Linux computers. 

- Share your desktop for meetings, presentations or team work. 

- Connect to your home computer while you are away and work on documents, check your e-mails, or download images from your home computer and edit them. 

- Connect to your work computer while you are away (such as when you are on a business trip and need important information). 

TeamViewer works behind firewall barriers, NAT routers, and proxies with no configuration necessary.
