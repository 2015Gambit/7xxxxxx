,snowhow,2012-05-27T19:59Z,"The patch doesn't work. The license in the about window shows ""Corporate"", and then below, it shows ""7 days remaining"". I have tried installing as Free, Corporate, and Commercial and it does the same thing. I even found a copy of an ERD 2010 disk booted into my computer off of it, deleted every trace of TeamViewer from the registry and hard drive and it still says I have 7 days left.

Sorry folks, the patch doesn't work... :("
,gmf20187,2012-06-13T14:35Z,Yes.  It does work.  Make sure you kill the TeamViewer process AND stop the TeamViewer service before copying the files in the crack folder.

(connection still can be made)   When you update instead, then Team Viewer won't start. (failed to load resource DLL, teamviewer_resource.dll)."
