,bismarket,2012-04-01T18:47Z,"OK so here goes, D/L'd fast & am seeding to at LEAST 3. Sadly not as good as i'd hoped but the best out there (so far) V6/A9 It's dark in some places so if using VLC you are able to adjust a bit so making it a little better but definitely watchable. Hope this helps? "
,Juggernaut62468,2012-04-01T20:46Z,"Before calling it a fake, You should know your $hit dude. Scenebalance always uploads their files in Rar.  Little information for you. "
,Stakrina,2012-04-07T19:24Z,A/7 V/7 Watched the entire thing. Movie was kind of dark. Also had the address to a Russian website pop up every now and again.
