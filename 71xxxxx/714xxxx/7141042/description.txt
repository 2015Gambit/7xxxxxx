AppCode 1.5 adds a set of very important "extract/introduce" refactorings: extract parameter, extract instance variable, extract property, extract typedef, extract macro, extract constant and the killer extract block parameter.

Additionally, a number of opposite direction "inline" refactorings have been added for methods, functions, local variables, parameters, constants, macros and typedefs.

Hopefully, the name of the refactoring "Convert local variable to ivar/property/parameter" speaks for itself.

The new "Refactor This" popup puts all refactorings under your fingertips for instant invocation and you only need to remember one hotkey
