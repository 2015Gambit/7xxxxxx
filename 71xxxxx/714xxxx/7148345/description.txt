Narratives:

Some bands really do ripen nicely with time, and New YorkÆs White Rabbits are a prime example. TheyÆve always had a certain confidence and coolness, and each release shows a new level of maturity and depth. The sextet features two drummers, two guitarists, and a brilliant balance of piano, synths, and acoustic and electric guitars, making the bed upon which singer Stephen Patterson lays his hugely appealing vocals. The slinky, sneaky electro-groove of the album opener, ôHeavy Metal,ö segues perfectly into "ItÆs Not Me,ö which has the feel of The BeatlesÆ Revolver. Next is the grand synth and piano drama of ôHold It to the Fire.ö The sleek and sophisticated vibe of ôDanny Come Insideö and ôBack for Moreö has a cinematic quality (the Rabbits could perhaps sell shiny black BMWs cruising a cliff-hugging Pacific Coast highway with these tunes). ôThe Day You Won the Warö gives a veiled nod to Prince, with desire-wrapped vocals and whip-cracking rhythms. Anyone willing to trade in obvious hooks for deeper-reaching, multitextured pop with a certain level of braininess will love Milk Famous.
