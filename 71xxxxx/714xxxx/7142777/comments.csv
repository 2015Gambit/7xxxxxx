,duriotic,2012-04-01T16:23Z,"I've tried it again...I have no idea why the files shown being downloaded previously revealed a list of ebooks.  THIS IS, APPARENTLY (I DIDN'T DL FROM THIS TORRENT AFTER ALL) THE RIGHT MOVIE.  No, I wasn't looking at the wrong torrent before, it's just weird.

I APOLOGIZE AND WITHDRAW MY EARLIER COMMENT.  GOOD DOWNLOAD HERE."
