Narratives:

"The Jammington" further establishes Chaundon as a humorist and a wordsmith of repute. The likelihood of a crew maintaining its conjoined unity within the genre of Hip Hop often borders on an impossibility, as egos clash and personal motivations create complications far removed from the elements that initially bring teams together. Spearheaded by Little Brother (producer 9th Wonder and rappers Phonte and Rapper Big Pooh), North Carolina's now defunct Justus League is divided amongst themselves after winning the hearts of purists by putting a refreshing spin on rap's classic ambiance a decade ago. Bronx representer Chaundon has one of the former crew's most tenacious spirits, still aiming for glory with his latest release The Jammington.
