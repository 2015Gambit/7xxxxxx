,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-29T10:28Z,"That ""Too Cute for TPB"" applies of course only to pictures, not movies (yet at least) :

IMDB tells : ""My Little Princess"", Eva Ionesco's debut film explores the intense relationship between mother & daughter. The film offers us a double controversy: The first being the relationship itself and the fact that the mother (played beautifully by Isabelle Huppert) takes erotic/pornographic photos of her under-aged daughter(Anamaria Vartolomei) and sells them. The second being that these very events happened in the director's actual life and caused a huge spark in France.""

About that Little Princess movie, i believe you want to find the original pictures of the girl ? It's easy enough, just do a Google picture search with the word: Ionesco (safe search turned off) and you'll find very beautiful black and white photos of the real girl Eva Ionesco (who now in 2011 directed this movie My Little Princess herself !)"
