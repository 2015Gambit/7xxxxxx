The second game in the Gundemonium trilogy, and continues the tale of humanity's war with hell brought on by alchemy. Its gameplay is a second extra-strength dosage of the kind of bullet-hell shoot-'em-up pandemonium found in Gundemonium Recollection, but with a dramatically game-altering "Flip Turn" ability. If you're tired of getting flanked in other shoot-'em-ups, now you can turn the tables and get your revenge. GundeadliGne also supports two-player cooperative play, so a friend can join the action and cover your six.
