,Dimmis80,2012-03-29T06:44Z,@disnfab first of all u don't know me so u can't tell that i am not patient.!!Believe i am very very patient.And i just make a simple question.!And i am very thankful and grateful and i have told @jmanwf a lot of times.And i think @jmanwf if he/she wants can talk on his/her self.And i don't think that u are his/her lawyer or his/her consulting or something.So mind your own busines and don't tell me that i can't just make a simple question.!In PB u can tell whatever u want.!Capish.!
[T],jmanwf,2012-03-29T07:07Z,I have a part time job and am at the mercy of itunes they are terrible at release the episodes on time but have been good of late i can only upload when i get time
,disnfab,2012-03-29T12:48Z,I'm sorry but I just think questions about when episodes are released are annoying to ME... Have a nice day. :)
,SoWErA3,2012-03-29T18:09Z,"Sorry Dimmis80 but you seem rude to me, I agree with disnfab especially since we know that Itunes ain't exactly fast with uploading new releases all the time of each show ;(

I really appreciate you jmanwf for all your hard work I hope you keep it up and ignore some of us who ain't appreciating you as much or as good at expressing themselfs in a good manner ;) "
