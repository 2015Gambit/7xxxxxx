Lyrics:

And I feel, I feel a deep connection
And I think, that we might be onto something, no
And I know it's something special
Seeing you here is not coincidental, mhh.

Well I've been walkin, walkin, behind enemy lines,
And I've been fighting, fighting, from the other side,
I've been saying, saying, I won't fall this time,
But now I'm walkin, walkin, within enemy lines.

See, I was trying to be everything you weren't expecting
All I ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing
But I'm falling way too fast,
I just want this love to last forever
Everytime I feel this way,
Oh somethings changed for the better

And I've been walkin, walkin, behind enemy lines,
And I've been fightin, fighting, from the other side,
I've been saying, saying, I won't fall this time,
But now I'm walkin, walkin, within enemy lines.

And now I'm walkin, walkin, behind enemy lines,
And now I'm fightin, fighting, from the other side,
I've been saying, saying, I won't fall this time,
But now I'm walkin, walkin, within enemy lines.
