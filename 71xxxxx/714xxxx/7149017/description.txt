An oversized inmate is poisoned and his coffin is used as a "Trojan Horse" for two inmates to escape the Cayuga Correctional Facility. One prisoner, out for revenge, brutally murders a prison guard, causing friction with the other prisoner, who only wants a big payday and to live in luxury. The murder also increases the urgency to catch the cons. Meanwhile, Ray dangles a tantalizing carrot in front of the team: between Erica, Shea, and Lloyd, whoever proves to be the most useful on this case will be the proud recipient of a tasty steak dinner.
