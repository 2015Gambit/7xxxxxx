,BrianKismRKO,2012-04-29T02:20Z,"Thanks Bro!!! , I Love this Game!!!!"
,dirugurl,2012-05-01T16:34Z,"i was told you needed a certain code in order to play this game for free, this is my first time playing sims for the pc. the last torrent i tried to get for this game had some code called [CRACK] well thats what the person called it and my brother told me that code would allow me to play for free. tho the code wouldnt work for some reason. is there a code on this torrent?"
,Puppsy,2012-05-29T10:10Z,"Ok so I am trying to install it and keep getting 'Cannot find SunsetValley.cache' or something similar.  How do I fix this?  Mounting the next file in line doesn't seem to help.  Used to whole disk isos and not so many file ones, sorry!"
,Ryuk96,2012-07-04T07:57Z,"im getting the same thing as Puppsy (sunsetvalley.objectcache) i tried looking for the file online to place in the folder during installation so it would detect it and move along but i couldnt. i did a Re-check and i have 100% downloaded.
im assuming its just a broken file in the download."
,Ryuk96,2012-07-04T09:27Z,"alright i found a solution, just didnt know how to deal with the iso part files.

download and install

run it, select add, highlight all the iso parts, then click join. mount with DAEMON and run"
,elSpain,2012-09-16T06:55Z,"So, is this download relatively fast? I've tried to download like three different torrents and they all get stuck at the same percentage for like, an hour, before they even move up the tiniest bit. ):"
