On her second album under the La Sera name, Vivian Girls bassist Katy Goodman changes things up radically behind the scenes but still ends up with a record that is just as good, if not better, than her excellent self-titled debut. On that record all the music was written and played by Goodman's friend Brady Hall, and he put together a gauzy and sweet update of an early pop/girl group sound that fit Goodman's charmingly direct lyrics and vocals perfectly. On Sees the Light Goodman takes a larger role, writing the music and playing bass as well as singing. She's helped out by Darker My Love's Rob Barbato on guitar and production, and together they go for a sound that is less reverb-y and less early pop, more spunky and more punky. Goodman's voice is brought up higher in the mix throughout and she proves herself to be a capable vocalist, belting it out when she needs to. In almost every way, Sees the Light is an impressive leap forward for Goodman that shows she's more than ready to make La Sera her full-time musical outlet.
