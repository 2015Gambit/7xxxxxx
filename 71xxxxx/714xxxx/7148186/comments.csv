Thanks heaps for a good quality torrent. I read the other reviews here before I watched it & thought they sounded harsh... They weren't, the movie totally sucked arse. I woulda given it a 0, but it got a 1/10 for having so many stars.  I think the highlight was the 20 or so seconds the lady that does Lisa simpsons voice was in it."
