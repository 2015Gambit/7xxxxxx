,Slangerb,2012-05-27T12:05Z,"-Happy seems to have epilepsy, look at how his eyes shake from side to side when talking to Blades.  
-Gil looks like Hornswaggle on stilts.  
-Jaime Kennedy shouldn't act.
-The jokes were too childish for this movie to be taken seriously.
-Edge's acting was alright, I guess.  But overall I think the movie was a giant load of crap."

,babet1,2012-08-02T01:34Z,"I enjoyed the movie it's a simple fun film, I don't understand the people saying it couldn't be taken seriously, Jamie never acts in serious films I really don't think they meant for this movie to be an award winning film or anything. If you're a fan of Jamie or Adam (Edge) I'd say it's worth watching, my only complain is I feel like it ended suddenly I would've liked to see a bit more happen at the end."
