Happy Seeding/Leeching!"

...please?"

,lisdead,2012-04-03T19:37Z,@khadhowf: thank you very much!
,khadhowf,2012-04-05T08:33Z,"I've seeded over 161,46 GB of this torrent now, but I can't stay on it forever. It would be great if any new leechers would seed at least 2x times what they leech. You know what I mean?
Download 2GB, Upload 4GB.

Then we'll get a good seeder base for the torrent.

When the eBook ""Homeworlds by Mac Walters"" comes out I'll probably post a new link here, adding it to the ""Media Collection"" ;)

If anyone have any sugestions of what I should add, please post a comment :)

For example: Should I add ""Final hours of Mass Effect 3""? To make it more complete? (and a link to Adobe Air)

Thanks for sharing!"
,khadhowf,2012-04-24T12:20Z,"I've seeded to a ratio of over x200 now, or about 416GB. I'm taking a break, since I have other things that needs seeding.
But I hope all you new leechers could try to seed at least 2 times what you download (at least those who read this).
I know most of people here are used to the hit-and-run kind of way of managing your torrents. If you're reading this, you're probably not one of those.
Thanks for showing your interest!
Happy seeding!"
