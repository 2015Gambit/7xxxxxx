The best rock and roll band in the America presented in Apple Lossless. All tracks were ripped from CD or converted from FLAC using XLD for those of us who use iTunes and want true lossless on their Apple products.

On a personal note I started following Aerosmith in early 1973. I was at the university radio station and the music director gave me a copy of the first Aerosmith album saying. These guys are shitΓÇªSteely Dan is much better." Taking it back to the dorm for a listen I immediately became hooked on Aerosmith and got a chance to see them live a month later as they opened for The Kinks (as I recall)

A fan ever since I've followed the bad boys from Boston through their ups and downs. Here they are for you to enjoy..in Apple Lossless. Ready to import into iTunes and "Just Push PlayΓÇª"
