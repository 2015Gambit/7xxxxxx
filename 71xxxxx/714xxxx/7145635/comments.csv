,Irminaz,2012-03-30T23:29Z,"Thanks, Skadugangaz! I thought you were joking at first, but this album actually is incredibly bad! What drugs is Varg on?"
,Behradeth,2012-03-31T08:59Z,"For crying out loud, what were you expecting? Filosofem II? If you don't like it then fine, but have no doubts that this album will have its fans too. I still can't see why some people try to actually prove that ""If we don't like it, you don't like it, and that's an order, rather than a statement.""

I think its good enough."
,Skadugangaz,2012-03-31T09:31Z,"Behradeth: A Filosofem II wouldn't be a bad thing, especially after releasing this and his other previous 3 albums. :)
Hell, I am forced to say ""No, Burzum is a shit band"", as there are more of these really bad albums compared to the few good ones. A good band doesn't release like 2-3 good albums, and like half a dozen of crap.
Add to that his grumpy asshole attitude, obvious lack of talent, and typical dilettante character - and the fail obvious."
,Irminaz,2012-03-31T09:54Z,"Excuse me for hoping for a good album. I can admit that that was probably pretty naive, given the fact that Vikernes is pulling an album out of his ass every year now (four albums since 2010!). I guess you can't have both, it's either quality or quantity.

And no, one can't argue taste. But I can certainly voice my opinion on this crapfest."

,Skadugangaz,2012-03-31T18:35Z,"Haters gonna hate = the most gay expression around. You may of course show your lack of taste by liking an album such as this, after all it's a free world. But hell, the great Norse guru can't even master pronouncing the words properly - but who cares? 99% of all the people listening to it goes like ""Wow, he speaks viking, right!?"" without knowing.

It's easy to love something for who did it, not for what it is (like an ugly painting made by your kid), worst part is when people can't see that difference... ;)"
,Awesomdor,2012-03-31T20:30Z,I actually really like this album. I hate to say people hate it because it's popular but that seems the case at this point.
,Diabolixxx,2012-04-08T15:24Z,"Nothing gay with ""haters gonna hate"", many, maybe not you, hate for the heck of hating. And this has gone on and on with Burzum for years... I for one genuinely like his work, read all of his books too. I do not agree with everything he says, but he has some valid points. And while his musical work strayed far from it's initial sound, he is simply trying out diffrent things, some good, some worse. This album is basically his way of trying to express Volusp책 poem of the Edda wich he wrote a whole book about in a melodic/skaldic way. Anyway, thanks again for the upload, enjoyed listening to this the whole week. :)"

,drag0naut,2012-04-12T22:49Z,"second wave black metal is dead you fucking babies

every good second wave band already realized that a decade ago and went elsewhere"
,MadMody,2012-08-28T20:00Z,"I like some of Burzum's work, he did some extraordinary stuff indeed, But I admit it, THIS  ALBUM SUCKS, really disappointing. "
