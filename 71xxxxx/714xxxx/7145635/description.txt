Varg Vikernes of Burzum will release this new album - Umskiptar - by 21/5/2012, well here you have it already, so that you won't make the mistake of actually purchasing it. I really haven't liked any Burzum releases since Filosofem, but this is really something extraordinary, he goes from mediocre to ridiculous with this new material.
Even some really hardcore Burzum fans I know, that still like him and what he does, says it's a big disappointment. So here you go, I doubt you will sincerely be able to say it's any good. :)

Here's what they say at Burzum.org, about this coming release:

The lyrics on "Umskiptar" are all taken from a Norse poem, Völuspá. For an English translation of the lyrics see the book "Sorcery And Religion In Ancient Scandinavia" [Skadugangaz note: You can download it here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7123681/Varg_Vikernes_-_Sorcery_and_Religion_in_Ancient_Scandinavia.pdf].

"The "Umskiptar" album is also a return-to-the-roots album for me, with a strong focus on atmosphere and wholeness rather than anything else. The vocals on this one however are more important than on any other album, with a total of 66 stanzas, some of them even repeated a few times, making up the lyrics of the album. The vocals are very important for the special atmosphere and are more important than on any other Burzum album, and more varied too – and as honest as it gets".

The concept of the album is "Umskiptar" (English = "Metamorphoses"), a deeply rooted European (i.e. Pagan) Stoic concept of changes. This concept was chosen in a world heading for a new Ice Age, and can therefore also be seen as critique of all the popular political movements of our age of lies". (V.V.)

And as always: If you like the album, please don't buy it - if you don't like it, spread it further so that others don't either. He deserves no money.
