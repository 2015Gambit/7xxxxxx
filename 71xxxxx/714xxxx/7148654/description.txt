Trips is the first Samiam album in five years, and despite the hiatus -- and despite the fact that the band has been together for over 20 years -- very little has changed. Their 2011 album has a sound akin to Foo FightersΓÇÖ self-titled debut and SugarΓÇÖs File Under: Easy Listening, playing just like an alternative rock/punk-pop hybrid from the ΓÇÿ90s. Like Samiam's career highlight, 1994ΓÇÖs Clumsy, this album is a slick and refined outing, full of straightforward, sweet melodies, yearning lyrics, and energetic riffs in an upbeat tempo. Iggy Pop/Green Day producer Chris Dugan recorded Trips onto 2" tape at Green Day's personal studio Jingletown in San Francisco, California, and this ΓÇ£back to basicsΓÇ¥ method is a perfect fit for the traditional craftsmanship. The songs ΓÇ£September,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Crew of One,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£MagellanΓÇ¥ are solid power pop songs that show that Beebout, Kennerly, Loobkoff, Bouchard, and Walker still know how to rock.
