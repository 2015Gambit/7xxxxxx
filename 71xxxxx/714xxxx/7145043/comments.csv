""6,95 gb?? ""
I guess it's becouse for full hd file it seems to be too small but notice, that MANY of full hd mkv files lately are smaller than they were, 2nd thing - it depends wat codecs, audio and bitrate encoder has beem using to make a rip, so YES, it is possible to get full hd file in a small size. Beside dat there is a 1080p copy of dat movie from WELL KNOWN group AMIABLE: The.Darkest.Hour.2011.1080p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE, which weight approx 6.6 gigs, so it's even smaller ;) U can grab dat one with no doubts about size/quality ;)
Here's the link:

I downloaded the Amiable 1080p rip and it filled out my whole screen, all stretched to do so and I hated it, people looked elongated and such. Will this one to do the same?? Answer please. Thanks!!"
