,GamingIndustryBlows,2012-03-30T12:59Z,"lol 1080p, get the fuck out of here with that"
,TeenGamer97,2012-04-04T08:11Z,"A=9
V=9
Great quality for cam considering it recently was released in cinemas. Keep up the great work"
,darkseidapokalips,2012-04-12T14:07Z,A very good copy given that it's a cam! Audio is clear though slightly echoes (doesn't affect the enjoyment though). Vid though sightly shadowy in places is great quality. Overall vid 8 out of 10; audio 8 out of 10.
,2gether,2012-04-13T13:01Z,so is scenetime really closed? One line says yes the next thing it wants a donation for a premium account.  Why donate if it's a closed community?
,luke444,2012-05-04T07:26Z,"Scenebalance your a legend, but dude you gotta start giving the people some screen shots with cams, cant expect everyone to go trial and error,. Your one of the very very few vip's that dont."
,.Leto.,2012-05-24T14:06Z,"Picture is REALLY blurry, plus you constantly see hungarian hardcoded subtitles. Sound is ok.
This movie doesn't look that great, I didn't see any action whatsoever during the first hour, so I'll wait for a better release."
,Orangeman123,2012-07-11T00:47Z,"Best version as of today. Other than the fact that it's from a cam (recorded in a movie theatre), very good 

V:8
A:8"
