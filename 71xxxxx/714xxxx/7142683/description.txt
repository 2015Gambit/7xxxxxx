Ancient and modern, old and young blend convincingly here. Erland Cooper is a twentysomething Orcadian, his Carnival includes former Verve guitarist Simon Tong, and their second album ranges merrily across the millenniums, at one point cutting old English literature with the sort of ambient fidgeting that animates Radiohead's latest. In clumsier, less charismatic hands this would spell disaster, but Erland's eerily crooned vocals and the trio's teemingly inventive arrangements find the common ground between garage psychedelia, folktronica and medieval dream poetry. The results are never less than intriguing and occasionally sublime, not least on the head-swirlingly lovely "East and West".
