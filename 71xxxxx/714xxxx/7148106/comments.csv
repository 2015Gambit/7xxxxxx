,SoulSeekers,2012-04-04T04:10Z,Nepotu! yes you are right i even feel sorry for my team this is another loss but by all means dallas is the defending champions but for them to come back and beat the magic like that in the 4th quarter makes me think the magic aren't solid at all!! Dwight needs to learn a jump shot and I am sure you are already aware of his free throw issues...
