Lots of movies these days have additional footage, dialogue, plot twists, outtakes, etc. over the endtitles. Even if this movie doesn't (and how am i to know that?) some people like to watch the endtitles, e.g. for the cast, etc."
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-01T07:26Z,"Well, still not many seeders. I guess no one believes a 250MB rip can be good quality.... and they're pretty much right.

The audio is unfortunately distorted. Not too bad, but has that metallic-robot overcompressed sound a lot. Should have given 50% more bandwidth to the audio *or* cut freq in half, e.g. 48KHz to 24 (not sure what it is). I repeat what i said: shoot for 300-350MB.... give a little more bitrate to the audio, and keep the endtitles. The video on this is very good. Thx."
