Storyine: Two sisters living in Lyon, one adopted, the other a single mother with a delightful little son, both close to their tough handsome mother. The adopted girl, Marine, manages a bookshop specialising in Anglo-Saxon literature. The first time she appears, she and her boyfriend, Alex, a restaurant critic, re-enact a French version of the bookshop encounter between Bogart and Dorothy Malone from the film version of The Big Sleep, which rather sets the general tone. The single mother, Lisa (played by Laurent herself), writes sad folk songs and works in a music shop. All three characters obsessively watch Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Charade. It's a wispy, tasteful, mildly touching, very French affair.
