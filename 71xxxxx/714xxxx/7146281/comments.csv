,DSCorp777,2012-04-01T13:10Z,Thanks dude ;D
,BossBadger,2012-04-01T19:25Z,You're welcome
,BossBadger,2012-04-01T20:02Z,"Please read:

If you get ""Activation failed"" in Office 2010 Toolkit after trying to activate, click ""Rearm"" and try activating again."
,hobags2,2012-04-07T08:00Z,Product activation failed. Tried rearm as mentioned still activation failed. Anyone else?
,BossBadger,2012-04-07T08:41Z,"@hobags2

Open Office 2010 Toolkit and go to the ""Main"" tab and click ""EZ-Activator""

It might take a while but it should work."
,Jakers2011,2012-04-09T06:06Z,"I didn't install MS2010 because I already had it installed. I just needed the toolkit for activation. This was a quick and easy download, and it works perfectly. All applications in my Office suite are activated. 
Thank you so much BossBadger. You rock!!"
,BossBadger,2012-04-09T08:30Z,"You're welcome, I'm glad it worked for you :)"
,nd2chs,2012-04-10T11:57Z,"Bro ! First let me thank u because the download was real fast.

I just came across a very silly problem though

my C: drive is all cramped up so I tried installing it in a different drive J: which has more than 150 GB.

But it keeps installing back to the same drive C: no matter I changed  the  drive selection in the customize option.

can u help please !!!"
,BossBadger,2012-04-10T19:53Z,"You're trying to install Office 2010 to Drive J but it's installing to C? I've never tried installing it to a different drive but it should work when you choose that drive during the install options. You could install it to C and then maybe delete some stuff off of it. I don't think Office takes up that much space. Sorry, good luck"
,nd2chs,2012-04-12T09:51Z,I think you are correct.I will remove some stuff from C: and try the install once again.Thanks BossBadger  [:D]
,nd2chs,2012-04-12T10:03Z,Thanks BossBadger
,BossBadger,2012-04-12T10:14Z,Oh cool. You're welcome :)
,mechanical68,2012-04-13T19:48Z,"i already had office installed on my computer, i just cracked as you mentioned, and remaining grace thingy said 180 days. but when i open office again. it saying 3 days left :(.. help please"
,BossBadger,2012-04-14T05:19Z,"I have no idea how to help you, sorry. Try reinstalling Office and using the activator again. That's all I can think of because it should work"
,aussietracker,2012-04-16T08:22Z,"all good ,worked for me ,thanks"
,BossBadger,2012-04-16T10:06Z,No problem
,lrp0126,2012-04-17T08:43Z,"It downloaded and seems to be working with everything else (thanks!), but when I open MS word it runs in compatibility mode and won't let me access anything that I couldn't access in word 2007. How do I make this stop? :/"
,wideyedworld,2012-04-21T18:59Z,"Thanks BossBadger! This worked great!!! This Torrent has EVERY program in the MS Office Suite-FANTASTIC!!!! A Tip for those installing, turn off your real time virus protection for the activator to do it's thing after you install the Office Suite. ENJOY! =) "
,asaljameel,2012-04-22T13:41Z,im a noob to this site how do i download it thanks
,asaljameel,2012-04-22T13:42Z,im a noob to this site where do i download
,BossBadger,2012-04-22T18:18Z,"@lrp0126 - Try reinstalling and make sure you use the installer in this torrent during reinstall.

@wideyedworld - You're welcome

@asaljameel - LMAO... start by googling Utorrent and download and install that program. After it's installed, click ""Get this torrent"" on this page. Now let it download in Utorrent and when it's done, don't remove it from the list in Utorrent so that you can seed."
,faequeen,2012-04-23T18:30Z,"This installed and activated well, but when I tried to start my computer this morning, I got a white screen. I set it to not load at startup, but still had the white screen. I was able to boot into safe mode, and all scans came up clean. I tried uninstalling several programs to give Windows more space (even though it had plenty to run), but only after I restored my computer to before I installed the program was I able to get rid of said white screen and get into Windows. I have deleted everything associated with this program from my computer, and it's working fine now. I don't know what it was that caused this, but it was in this program, so just wanted to warn people in case this happens to them."
,BossBadger,2012-04-23T21:17Z,"I doubt this program is the reason why that happened, are you sure it wasn't something else? I've never heard of that and people aren't really having problems with this."
,JDH1979,2012-04-24T08:13Z,"I'm definitely seeding this! Come one, come all! Thanks, Boss! Awesome work!"
,BossBadger,2012-04-25T02:09Z,"You're welcome, thanks for seeding :)"
,erothen1,2012-04-26T18:42Z,I downloaded the torrent and when i click on it and click on office toolkit it says i have to download a version of .net framework
,iszy3,2012-04-26T23:01Z,Love you
,Scubasteve1990,2012-04-26T23:27Z,"when i try to install it, i get set up cannot find file location, this is the one thats missing, office.en-usosetupui.dll, wont let me install? any ideas?"
,GamerX53,2012-04-28T01:01Z,Works perfectly DEFF seeeding
,masternavy,2012-04-28T23:13Z,"Thanks, man.  I loaded MS Office 2010 from my borrowed disk, and used the activator.  I t worked the first time, now I'm good for 6 months. "
,BossBadger,2012-04-30T03:14Z,"@erothen1 - google "".net framework 4.0"" and download it. It's something basic that all computers should have.

iszy3 - then make sure you seed ;)

Scubasteve1990 - The only idea I have is that you didn't download the torrent completely because it works for everyone else. Make sure you download it 100% then use setup.exe to install.

GamerX53 - Thanks for seeding :)

masternavy - You're welcome, remember sharing is caring :)"
,Cirrus_G,2012-05-01T00:32Z,":: ThankYou , BossBadger ::"
,BossBadger,2012-05-01T01:33Z,You're welcome :)
,raindeuxx,2012-05-02T08:18Z,"If you have trouble with the ""Activate"" button, like I did, then you can click EZ-Activator, which worked for me, 180 days of office :))) Ty Boss! :D"
,BossBadger,2012-05-02T23:45Z,"No problem, and yeah some people might have problems with that.. I wrote a comment about that but it's probably buried now lol"
,MSSYB,2012-05-04T03:08Z,Thank you so much! This was the third MS Office 2010 I downloaded ~ the other two were crap. But not yours! Easy directions and great seeders! Finally! Thanks! Def seeding!
,BossBadger,2012-05-04T05:16Z,"You're welcome, I'm glad it worked :)"
,ticks619,2012-05-06T22:48Z,"for some reason my activate bar in step 4 is not available as a option, the bar is there, but i cannot click it"
,snowdog13,2012-05-06T23:45Z,Just PERFECT.  Follow the instructions and everything will go 100% smooth.  GREAT job Boss!
,gadiraju,2012-05-07T21:01Z,"help!

it is saying failed, what to do now?"
,MasterRand,2012-05-08T07:44Z,"Amazing! Guys, I made this account in here just so I could comment on this torrent. I tried so many different Microsoft Office 2010 I was about to give up on 2010, I actually thought this one that I downloaded was 2007. It works great, I tried TheThingy, RedDragon, etc. None of them worked.

This is the one guys, keep up the amazing job BossBadger!"
,jjdoe43,2012-05-08T16:43Z,"well what can i say, it works like a charm, i'm impressed well done BossBadger!"
,auroralilly,2012-05-11T11:06Z,"Hey all, hoping for a bit of help! I've followed the instructions but it's coming up with error code: 0x8007000d - did a google on the code but couldn't find much help there (what I did find, I didn't really understand :-/ ) Anywho's, everything is working but every time I open anything within office it, of course, comes up saying this copy of office is not activated... Bit of a pain in the bum as I'm studying online and don't want to have to keep removing and downloading... Any help would be appreciated!!! "
,auroralilly,2012-05-11T11:31Z,"Hey, just want to scrap my last comment. I gave restarting my pc a go, and it worked. Everything is as BossBadger said it would be, 180 days grace, etc., so thanks a bunch pearla'!!! "
,seVen-kun,2012-05-11T22:23Z,"To activate: for me the activation tab did NOT work. the ""EZ_Activate"" in the main tab DID work.  Also it works with other copies of office 2010 pro plus so you can just dl the activator if you already have a copy of the program."
,GreeenJay,2012-05-14T20:04Z,"When I run Office 2010 Toolkit.exe, it does nothing. Windows only ask me if I'm sure I want to run this app but nothing else happens. What could be the problem?"
,fakerneverno,2012-05-26T07:08Z,Can I update the office?
,fakerneverno,2012-05-26T07:38Z,"works in 64bit?

,RyanHawk-,2012-05-30T09:56Z,Show the link of the torrent download! Please!
,bluetraveler8,2012-05-30T15:02Z,"I could not use the toolkit at first because I did not have the .NET framework installed. After installing it, I was now able to activate the product. It works perfectly! Great download. Thanks a lot! :)"
,MiaLanski,2012-05-31T22:12Z,"This works excellent.....THANK YOU, Bossbadger!! Thank you VERY much!"
,stewboor,2012-06-05T12:16Z,"Thanks for this A PREACHY ATED

,tyanna876,2012-06-15T23:24Z,"hey, when I run setup it says ""Setup has stopped working"" Help me plz!"
,raquilee,2012-06-21T17:31Z,"when i run the toolkit i had to click ez-activate instead of activate, but it worked fine afterward!! thanks"
,zaniac420,2012-06-23T05:11Z,It asks for a serial when I install.  This does not do me much good.
,zaniac420,2012-06-23T05:14Z,How do you get past the part where it asks for a serial number?  I thought the whole point of pirated software was to bypass that.
,aini_aian,2012-06-24T12:58Z,Thanks! It work for me :)
,hellwo,2012-07-25T10:09Z,"amazing! great torrent and it worked amazing for me.I had to do it a different way though
