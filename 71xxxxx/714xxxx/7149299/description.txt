Death Row tells the fascinating and controversial story of crime and the death penalty. Over the period of a year, Werner Herzog has interviewed inmates in America as they await their death and uncovered brutal stories of rape and murder. The second portrait is of James Barnes. Sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife, Barnes had already spent eight years behind bars when he became a practising Muslim.

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
