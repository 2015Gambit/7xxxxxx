,shaaani,2012-04-01T18:52Z,"@AliBaloch
why do u say 'Ending credits intact' when u cut them from the movie.

the original runtime is 2hrs 13mins and urs is 2hrs 7mins, so the u have cut the ending credits"
[V],AliBaloch,2012-04-01T19:12Z,"@shaaani Movie Run time is only 2hrs 6mins 26sec & all other time is Movie end credit & u r talking IMDB RunTime.i hope this info is more then enough for u if u still have any doughy then downloade full time rip from another uploader and compare with my Encode, i dont know why u guys not think that em actually saving low band wide data and time but i think u r those type of guy who r interested to watch end credit more then movie so if u need its end credit ask me will gave u link to downloade that shit credit"
