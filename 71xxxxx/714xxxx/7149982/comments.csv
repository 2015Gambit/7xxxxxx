NEW AMERICAN ROGET’S COLLEGE THESAURUS
IN DICTIONARY FORM and while page 9 says ""This edition of Roget’s Thesaurus is both a dictionary of synonyms and a thesaurus..."", page 10 states emphatically, ""This is not a dictionary.""

That having been said it reads like a dictionary(with synonyms for definitions) and is an excellent download.  Thanks. "
,jimbuck2,2012-04-01T21:35Z,Correction.  This download's cover (page 1) does say NEW AMERICAN WEBSTER HANDY COLLEGE DICTIONARY FOURTH EDITION but that is the only place.  Inside on page 3 it still has a different title page as a thesaurus.  Just be aware that you're getting a thesaurus as opposed to a dictionary.  It's still a cool download.
