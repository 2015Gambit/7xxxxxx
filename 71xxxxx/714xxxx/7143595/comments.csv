,botcrawl,2012-03-30T22:46Z,"good sound, good video, best quality in the world. i shaved my penis and it flaked away when i watched this i enjoy everything by patrick jane so much. best show to watch the dog"
,djnero,2012-04-06T12:49Z,"patrick jane is a character!
do you know in this country, people spit on soap operah actresses in the street for something her character did on the TV show.
do you know thousands of brits marched (for real on the streets) to release a fictional character from a fictional jail in a fictional soap operah.  and you look to us for what exactly? more madness.  thanks for uploading VTV"

Its also used heavily by politicians & actors, yup all those hand guestures too that they do,  some are NLP primers, an effective one they do is make a circle with thier thumb and index finger, be extra weary of the words you hear when they do so."
,djnero,2012-04-06T15:07Z,"and the sound is fine by the way. so its the case of ""awful"" sound system cranki, or are you ''actualy'' or ''literaly'' or ''totaly'' or ''actualy'' again, one of the crankies?"
,djnero,2012-04-06T15:14Z,"and there it is LOL, when he said ""how tiny and insignificant we are"" intro 19. watch again, watch his hand, this is like a seed planted in your sub conscious, so you flaked you penis off for a guy that is up to no ""good"" if he knows it or not, quite a few of them do know though"
