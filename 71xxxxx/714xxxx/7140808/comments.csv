,dewsaqed,2012-03-29T05:42Z,"Piece of shit torrent populated by fake, unconnectable seeders. There's only 1 real seeder on this thing. A pathetic attempt by the uploader to get hits to his shitty site."

,mattimahoton,2012-03-29T11:24Z,"Thanks for upload. Ps. I dont get the big deal complaining about rar files, its not so hard job to extract it. but of course I am curious to know, what is the reason uploads are compressed in rar files?"
[V],sceneline,2012-03-29T11:49Z,"how many seeders you want? i have one connection i can't seed from 10 user names if you want torrents with more seeders search for old one,

,MrSnickel,2012-03-29T13:17Z,"I don't understand what people are complaining about, my torrent is downloading at 2.8MB/s right now and it seems to be fine.

Sceneline, once again thanks a million for such an awesome upload :)"
