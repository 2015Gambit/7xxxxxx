,Thorlim,2012-04-02T02:47Z,"Sadly I paid to watch this shit at the cinema, it isn't worth it. This film ends up being worse than the first."
,Lolzalotful,2012-04-02T02:52Z,"Oh stop your whining it was FREE..... clarify that. You dont HAVE to download it but you did! Hackulus was good enough to put it up but morons like you who complain just make it plain annoying.

If its so shit quality, go watch it at the movies and bitch less here. Idiotic"

First 5 to 7 mins of the film, there is an obstruction in the way of the camera, film starts off with a double edge and out of focus slighly, like its recording a 3D film, but then switches to just slightly out of focus, bit bright in some area's yet dark in others, towards the end of the films climax, it switches to heavily out of focus so you miss the details in the climax 

Unless you REALLY must see this film, id avoid as the film is ruined by the out of focus shots at the end. thanks for the up though and thanks for the effort. "
,TehAgent,2012-04-03T16:20Z,"unless my comment magically reappears seems it was deleted for some reason. so with that in mind ill type the bastard again, and see if its still here later.

First 5 mins of the movie you have some thing in the way of the cam, its then doubled edged from a 3d source, going onto being a bit out of focus (blurry), its too light in some places and too dark in others, to wards the films climax, it switches back to out of focus so you miss a lot of the detail of the final fight scene.

Audio is ok for the most part, slight echo, but at least its got some base to it. 

If you really must see this film, its worth a watch, other wise id wait for a better copy to be released.

Thats for the up and effort, seems a shame that we cant get back the quality of cams from 7 years ago even though camera's have improved significantly from then. 

Oh and please, keep the comments about how good or bad the film is, i like to make my own mind up. "
