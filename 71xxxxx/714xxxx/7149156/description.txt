NOTES:

Russian video was nice actually.....best they've done for a while.Still had issues,over bright in parts,chroma too high in parts,last several mins look like from a lower Q sors....muxed too it.Theres a big ass watermark several times throughout and some slight camera movement.
Audio was nice for cam ...very nice.But like any cam audio as some issues ...

Video we opted to crop the borders that appeared.....lowered the chroma alot,altered the brightness and contrast to make bad look more real aswell as reducing the glares.
Also used as HQ smoother and slight tweak in the rgb colours and finally added some sharpness back to it.
Audio was nice so just synced it up too russian video ....needed 8 cuts due to missing secs here and there ....roughly 12 secs missing in total.
