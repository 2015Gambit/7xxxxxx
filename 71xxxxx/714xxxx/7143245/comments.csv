,MrFlamez,2012-03-30T22:52Z,":D I am glad you asked...
I have professionally prepared the file so all of the cracks and ETC are taken care of. It is indeed an untouched image.
NO PASSWORD
Just boot from the disk you burned it to :D
It has both x86 & x64
 Thanks for asking"
,MrFlamez,2012-03-30T22:54Z,"And it only has ultimate, and is only updated until '09. Build 7600 version 6.1.0"
,MrFlamez,2012-03-30T22:57Z,"Everything in this upload is everything I used to install it to my computer. I am using this version on my computer right now, and it does have Daz activate. It is his latest cracker that I know of :D"
,montcer9012,2012-04-01T02:22Z,It would be able to burn on a DVD 5 (4.5 GB) ??
,MrFlamez,2012-04-01T07:54Z,"Yes, I checked the amount of data that the .iso files contain and they are small enough for that, so yeah itll work :D"
,raindeuxx,2012-04-04T11:24Z,"Im having some trouble with this. Ok here's the deal. I have a Dell Inspiron N5010 laptop. I don't have any blank dvds or any money to get some. I do however have a 32 gig flash drive that has the Windows 7 ISO files and everything else on it. I reformatted the usb to NTFS, copied the files to it, changed the primary boot option to usb in my BIOS, changed my SATA mode to ATA instead of AHCI. My specific boot priority goes usb, hard drive, cd/dvds, diskette, network, then eSATA. When I select usb as the main option I get a ""BOOTMGR is missing"" message. If network is first I get a ""pxe-e61: media test failure, check cable pxe-m0f: exiting pxe Rom. BOOTMGR is missing"" message.
I'm at wits end, been tinkering for hours checking Google, trying the suggested solution, checking again after it fails or I get a new error. I'm lost at this point and I've hit a dead end. is there a step I'm forgetting? Just for more detail. The only things on this flash drive, I backed the files onto another laptop, are ""Windows 7 Ultimate"" and ""Windows 7 Ultimate (x64)"". Am I supposed to delete one? I want the x64 version not the x32 one. I have enough ram for that lol. Its unzipped and stuff. Im so confuse and its depressing Q.Q"
,Snoop83,2012-04-04T18:08Z,How do I restore all my files that are in windows.old??????
