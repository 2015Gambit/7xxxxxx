,ex3me4me,2012-04-04T18:53Z,"Kuryb, Thank You!!!!!!!!

If somebody needs a tip how to burn this on Mac computers leave a comment!"
,papukanga,2012-04-12T22:34Z,"Hi,

,papukanga,2012-04-12T22:59Z,"I need DVD cover for Nav 7.7. Can anyone get this for me. 
Thanks Kuryb. You did the great job. Its working in my car.. 2006 Maxima"
,Kuryb,2012-04-14T01:01Z,"I don't include images of the disc label because it would make it too easy for people who occasionally sell copies on eBay and Craigslist to deceive their buyers.

I doubt many people looking at this torrent will have the original disk, so you've made a request that's unlikely to be filled."
,furling,2012-04-16T13:31Z,Is there a option to remove maps data? To have only update of software? And Maps for Europe? thanks
,papukanga,2012-04-16T16:26Z,"It makes sense, thanks Kuryb"
,Kuryb,2012-04-16T19:26Z,@furling: I doubt that's possible with this disc.
,cokeguy_coke,2012-04-23T20:30Z,"Kuryb... I have followed the PDF instructions but what do you mean by ""Extract the ISO and
MDS files to anywhere on your computer. Use burning software (e.g. IMGBurn) to write the
image file onto a dual layer DVD. Direct the software to the MDS file.""???? 

I know what extracting the ISO is, but how do you ""direct the software to the MDS"" if you're burning the image file onto a dual layer DVD???  I am using the LG Burn tool that came with my DVD burner when I built the system.

Thanks"
,Kuryb,2012-04-23T23:36Z,I'm not familiar with the LG Burn Tool. Download IMGBurn and give that a go instead. It's free.
,cokeguy_coke,2012-04-24T01:03Z,"Kuryb,

 I'll try that, but my comment really was focused on what do you mean by ""directing the software to the MDS file""?????"
,cokeguy_coke,2012-04-24T01:05Z,"Do I create just one image file with both the ISO file inside AND the MDS file inside, or do I create an image file for just the ISO file, and leave the MDS outside but still burn both to the disk?

Just maybe confused on the wording of the instructions, or am I reading too much into this?"
,Kuryb,2012-04-24T16:39Z,"You're making this too complicated for yourself. You don't need to create an image file; the ISO file itself is a type of image file. All you need to do is extract the MDS and ISO files, select ""Write image file to disc"" in IMGBurn, then pick the MDS file."
,shivp09,2012-04-27T04:39Z,How do you burn it on a mac?
,Kuryb,2012-04-27T07:20Z,You can start by reading the instructions for mac users in the text file.
,nadrew,2012-04-28T07:43Z,@kuryb Thanks so much! Very much appreciated. Easy to use (on Mac OS X) following the instructions in the text file.
,skyfox16,2012-05-18T05:11Z,I have a MAC and cant get this to work.... what program do i need to unzip the file?

,Kuryb,2012-06-15T02:10Z,I put some troubleshooting suggestions in the text file. Which ones have you tried already?
,ZPrime,2012-06-15T23:52Z,Navteq/Infiniti pricing on these is absolutely insane.  My dad's FX thanks you.  ;)  I will try to seed this for a while to help out too.
,Transpose,2012-06-24T20:48Z,Thank you for your work!  Any chance for a Mazda Navteq?
,kuulguy12,2012-06-26T23:02Z,Thank you so so so much. you have no idea how helpful you have been. once again thank you
,amykhan,2012-09-01T15:48Z,"Hi Kuryb, 

I am looking desperately for a navigation DVD for my middle east Infinity FX35. 
It has the system where DVD goes in the trunk. Can you help me with it. "
,bigbway,2012-09-05T05:01Z,I was not able to burn ta readable disk on my Mac Air & super drive using dvd+or - R DL. all of the disk when loaded into the car (M35x 07 ) & just continued to load. I was able to see some day light using a desktop and external LG drive however the map loads and then continuously turns the main console off every 15 sec (using -r DL verbatim). Any insight would be great. I'm half way to having bought the disk from the dealer with my disk casualties. 
,ex3me4me,2012-09-06T16:40Z,"bigbway - When you burning disk with mac, make sure that option verify disk is unchecked and burn it on the slowest speed possible. 

Muskycm - Same to you, all that errors happened to me as well. make sure that option verify disk is unchecked and burn it on the slowest speed possible. "
,Kuryb,2012-09-08T19:14Z,"@amykhan: I do not have access to navigation data for the Middle East.

@bigbway: All of the troubleshooting tips I can suggest are already in the text file so please read it carefully. If nothing works, try using a friend's desktop."
