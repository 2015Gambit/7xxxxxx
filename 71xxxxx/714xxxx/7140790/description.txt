DISCLAIMER:

This is not the official release of the soundtrack. I simply downloaded the songs from YouTube and put them together in order; album like, with cover art;
I do not own any of these songs, as they are property of the artists who made them.

P.S:"Rue's Lullaby" is not part of the soundtrack, the version in the folder it's just some cover I found on YouTube and downloaded. I do not own it either.
