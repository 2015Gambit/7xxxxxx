HBO Game Of Thrones Season 2- There will be blood and lots of it.
    FANS prepare for their great gore-fest's return on Sunday.


The winds of Winter are blowing in April 1, when "Game Of Thrones" returns to HBO for its Second season, and to prevent your brains from totally exploding during the Premiere. For Those of you who read "A Clash Of Kings", 
the second book in George R.R. Martin's "A Song Of Ice and Fire" series, most of the Premiere will seem pretty much familiar - and it's just an awesome as you expect it to be.



BELFAST, IRELAND- The Game Of Thrones is not one of beauty. Dead and half-dying men lie strewn across the muddy, blood-soaked war camp, their missing limbs  and scarred bodies a harsh reminder of the ravages of war. Grimm-faced, bearded warriors sit eating  around campfires in full gear, the light dancing off their dented armour and sheilds. Soot-covered tents and supply wagons encircle the men, and the colourful banners of multiple noble houses stand.
