When Martin comes in contact with a homeless man who possesses the same obsession with numbers as Jake, he sets out on a series of seemingly unrelated tasks that connect an abused African woman, a group of African boys entering a dance competition and an outgoing woman at California's famed Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Meanwhile, Teller (guest star Danny Glover) pays a visit to Jake's board-and-care facility and emotions run high for Clea.
