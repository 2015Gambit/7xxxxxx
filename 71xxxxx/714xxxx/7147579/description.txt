Media Description:
Always & for Real' is an album that is uncompromising in every sense. From the sparkling recording, capturing their soaring Polynesian harmonies with absolute clarity, through to their obvious faith and cultural pride, to the outstanding quality of the artwork - this is one well put together album. Adeaze have an intentionally positive focus to their music, and this album is rich in songs that affirm family and strong relationships. There is more than a passing credit to their Polynesian heritage, yet without becoming too introspective. There's a sense that we're getting an intimate look into the lives of Adeaze, with an warmth that draws us into the Tupa'i family through both the style and themes of the music. Originals are interspersed with covers including the Bee Gees How Deep Is Your Love and Clapton's Tears in Heaven.
