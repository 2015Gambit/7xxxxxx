"A-Game"

When Alex (Amanda Peet) is invited 
to a wedding at her boss Bob's 
(guest star Larry Miller) home, she 
invites Ben (guest star Matt 
Letscher), hoping he can aid in her 
efforts to impress the partner's 
wives. When a last-minute emergency 
arises, Ben is forced to leave and 
Pete (David Walton) comes in to try 
and save the day. Meanwhile, 
Screwsie (Margo Harshman) is 
offered the catering job for the 
wedding and enlists Walt's (Jeffrey 
Tambor) help. Elsewhere, Alex's 
necklace goes missing and the crew 
falls under suspicion.
