Standard dvdrip quality takes about 175 MB for 20 minutes and 720p about 450-600 MB. So why are many uploaders flooding the HD section with videos that don't belong there? And yes, I know its free but its not an excuse to label things in a way that misguides people. What's the point of having categories they don't mean anything?"
