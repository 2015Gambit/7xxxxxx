Petty. Heartbreakers. As American as it gets. This collection speaks volumes to the greatness of the band.

Here's my Apple Lossless collection of Tom Petty and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Fourteen complete albums plus selected songs from the Playback compilation box set and other singles and B sides. That's over 13 hours of rockin'.

Presented in Apple Lossless. All tracks were ripped from CD or converted from FLAC using XLD for those of us who use iTunes on Apple products.

Enjoy!
