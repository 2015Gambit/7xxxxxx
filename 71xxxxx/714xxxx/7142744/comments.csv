,aeMaeTHs,2012-03-29T21:27Z,Since I never used simulink I'm not 100% if there's something missing so pls report any bugs!
,dwayne101,2012-04-15T05:17Z,so how does it work?
,medwatt,2012-05-23T00:18Z,"Don't bother downloading this for think this is full Matlab. This contains only the environment with only 1 toolbox installed. There is no symbolic math toolbox and all others.
It is useless. Better save yourself the time to download 1GB for nothing."
,njekt,2012-05-27T20:31Z,"ignore medwatt's comment. the majority of matlab users dont use its toolboxes, especcially students."
,medwatt,2012-05-29T01:41Z,"Yes, I agree, but the symbolic toolbox is very very important. Most students want to do integration to see an expression but not to get a numerical answer. 
I say it once again. This version doesn't have THE SYMBOLIC TOOLBOX so you cannot perform symbolic maths."

,ikk,2012-08-28T03:20Z,"Second on ignoring medwatt's comment. MATLAB, even if you buy it, does NOT come with a symbolic toolbox and CANNOT natively perform symbolic calculations. You have to get the symbolic toolbox separately."
