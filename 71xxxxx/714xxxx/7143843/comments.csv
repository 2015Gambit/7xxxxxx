,glounk,2012-03-31T13:22Z,"hello my friends;
is there something for PCs pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaase."
,777driver,2012-03-31T16:38Z,If your FD is not working. Try renaming /Enr to /Enroute on your iPad. 
,JPFT2010,2012-03-31T18:19Z,"The application runs, but when you try to insert an airport it says something about the coverages which means that it is not recognizing the information I put inside the ipad. Any suggestions?"
,JPFT2010,2012-03-31T18:23Z,My folder is enroute already since I installed the app. I can see the TC inside the FD but I cannot plan any trip because it doesnt recognize the coverages. Any other suggestions?
,kingflyer,2012-04-01T00:44Z,"i haven't been able to download the files but I suspect this is only the airportlist.bin file. 

If FD is not working maybe it's because you haven't unlocked the codes yet. try downloading the 1205 cycle for ipad and follow the instructions there. You need to upload several folders into your ipad for it to work."
,JPFT2010,2012-04-01T04:30Z,"I will try, and give feedback later"
,JPFT2010,2012-04-01T05:43Z,I did everything like explained for cycle 1205 FD ipad and it doesnt work. I replaced every folder and put the new ones. Can someone post here how to do it? As me there is lot of people with the same problem. Regards
