This is a zipped version of the Unreal Tournament 2004 Demo. Just download, unzip using the windows default program or any other program you have and then run the installer. No patches or mods, it's the original demo I just uploaded since I didn't found one on tpb. It works correctly on any windows, I currently use it on windows 7 x64bit. Enjoy :)
