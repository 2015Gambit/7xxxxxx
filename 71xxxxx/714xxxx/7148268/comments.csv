,CheaterBoy123,2012-03-31T17:14Z,"How to install this game (and other ISO and CSO games): Connect your PSP to your PC. Make sure you got a Custom Firmware, if not, download one and install it. If you got, you need to create a folder in ():PSP and name it to ISO. Then place the CSO or ISO to here and wait for the copy to finish and you can simply launch it from Game -> Memory Stick :D Have fun!"
