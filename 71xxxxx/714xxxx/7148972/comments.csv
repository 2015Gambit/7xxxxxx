,amerikhun,2012-04-17T17:40Z,"yeah, well lot of servers are different versions... it even finds counter-strike:source servers so if you find a cool cracked server, you should save into favorites... but if you download a lot of crap from a lame server, and it totally mods your CS, just delete the folder and unpack again:D thats what i like about it... cracked CS is crappy, but its cool sometimes... and its cool for LAN games too, cod you can carry it on your phones memory, or anything... no install, nothing... i needed to upload this, cos its great"
