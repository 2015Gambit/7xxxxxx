Narratives:

Norwegian pop band Donkeyboy release their new album on Mar 2, 2012.  I loved their last album Caught in A Life (which is available on iTunes) and have been looking forward to this.  Admittedly, after hearing their first single City Boy I became cautiously optimistic.  Now having heard the album, it is good and has a lot of the same elements that made the first album a fun and easy listen.  This time they lean more towards the electro side of pop.  With a little less than the guitar and "indie" feel of the first album, which disappointed me a bit cause I found that set them apart.  But I have to applaud them for trying something new.  The album is good, though the title track Silver Moon is the only song I went away with remembering (I've included the video link here).  The other songs are good, with the music being the strength on most tracks, catchy beats and unusual but enjoyable hooks, but the lyrics are weak, and often dont even make sense.
