I figured since you could get this exact file off of their site that this would be okay.  Once people start seeding it it should be a lot faster than their site, until that point it might not.

I will seed all tonight and tomorrow, but after that we will have to see (if no one else is seeding it then nobody probably really wants it in torrent format anyway).

This is the On The Verge episode taped on March 23 and released on March 28.  This is the 4th epsiode, with Neil deGrasse Tyson, trolling people in the iPad line, SXSW, and New York distillery visit.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did watching it.
