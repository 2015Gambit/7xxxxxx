Requires; 6,23 GB

1. Run Install.exe
2. Install game (about 10 min)
3. Installer doesn't create desktop shortcut so to play game run BinariesWin32ShippingPC-StormGame

It should works that way. If doesn't copy "ShippingPC-StormGame.exe" and "xlive.dll" from fairlight folder to BinariesWin32
This crack from fairlight works 100% I finished game with this crack.

To install addidional subtitles:

1. Copy "Engine" folder from "Multi 7 - subtitles" to game folder
2. Then from "Multi 7 - subtitlles" choose relevant .reg file and run it
(For example you want French so run FR.reg)
3. Click yes (or sth like that just to add key to registry)
