,Acriminal,2012-03-30T18:47Z,The only difference between this torrent and The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.7-RELOADED is that there are two additional lines of text added to his readme.txt file where he credits two more torrent sites for the download.
,Derc,2012-03-30T20:00Z,"Thanks S4A.

No virus, I have checked with PC Tools Internet Suite 2012 along with Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyware. False positive on what file???

Anyway, I will delete all my folders, saves (of course make the backup folder for them) and mods with main game. Hopefully this fixes the Crash to desktop issues.

   To all those having problems; have you tried running as admin?
Are you running W7 64bit?( some games/cracks require W7 and/or DX11 to run properly .)
Did you copy to the right folder? (i.e. the one witch requires you to authorize any number of files?
How dirty is your regestry? try cleaning that up.
When was the last time you updated your DX files from a validated source?
Try updating both windows and ALL your drivers. (newer high-end games that are packed full of glitches like this one usually require Everything to be up to date.)
Try rebooting your computer after the install or try running it on lower settings.
Make sure you have TESV installed in the x86 program files folder, and that its not in there too deep.
Double check the integrity of the torrent, the files, and that either you, or your anti-virus didn't accidently delete something.
Try re-installing/downloading with your anti-virus off, or simply re installing/downloading. (while making sure to use the correct installer, if their is more than one.)

   Lastly, make sure your not an idiot and you know WTF your doing, lol, ..and make sure your system meets or exceeds the requirements, along with all the pysx-shadder-bullshit 3.0 that these games need to work properly.

   If none of this or what was said in the other comments helps, take it to youtube or google. ...and try looking for problems related to your setup.

Peace bitches..."

An hour into the game and no crash, no mod or save incompatibility. I did not uninstall my mods, I did not delete my saves. I simply pasted the contents of the download onto my Skyrim directory(except for steamapi.dll, since I use CK).

I'm not even kidding.  Is this too good to be true? Or did anyone else also managed to do it successfully? I'm not complaining or anything, it's just that usually, when everything is all going great, there's a catch. So are there any repercussions I should expect for keeping my mods and saves?"

If you want to make a torrent file you will need to download a torrent client like utorrent or bitTorrent etc.

I'm using utorrent. It's as simple as starting utorrent, then file->create new torrent. Then you select the files you wish to include in the torrent.

Next, upload the .torrent file with your stuff onto TPB (that is - here). Than simply seed it long enough (seed it trough your torrent client - you have to start the torrent you have created) too get it started and you will heave plenty of other seeders in no time.

Hope it helps.."

But... that's what I've done every time! T_T well well gonna make a last try :p"
,JussiWarcon,2012-06-03T14:27Z,Okay so I just did it (as I've done 10000 times before) it did fix the stuttering and now the sensitivity isn't as high as it was before but it still feels a bit unnatural. 
,aethius_,2012-06-03T15:59Z,"guys, do I have to install all the updates one by one, or just the last one? thanx"
,AlexZero,2012-06-03T16:54Z,"What if I have crack from Razor? Can I install this one or not? 

What the hell, nobody is going to answer me, so I will just try and remain silent about the result. So you will have to try it yourself."
,PineappleStarz,2012-06-03T22:05Z,"@ JussiWarcon

the ini's are JUST SETTINGS!!

find the mouse settings and change them, or delete them and let the mouse driver control it.

Animation mods will most likely lead to that."

,markymonkeymark,2012-06-08T05:53Z,"sorry for my english...

i just want to ask, is the version of this update is latest? i mean, something like version 2.1 etc... thanks..."
,PineappleStarz,2012-06-10T04:54Z,"markymonkeymark ...

updates don't get versions...
they are beta or final

thats why we have update 6,7,8....9 beta
so the answer to that question is this is version 8.
:rollseyes:"

Do i have to download all of these (update 1-7) and THEN this, or will this one suffice?"

Thanks for enlighten me... 

last question...
how to know or where can i find the version of my skyrim?"
,JoonBoy,2012-06-13T21:16Z,Does this fix all the issues with esbern?
,Rein20,2012-06-14T14:46Z,"@markymonkeymark 
Find your TESV file in your Elder Scrolls folder. Go over it with the mouse but don't click it. A description should pop out. If not click over it -> right mouse -> Properties -> Details. There search for the file version. If you don't want to do that. Start your Skyrim -> Load a save -> After loading open your menu as for saving. In the bottom left corner of the menu you can see your Skyrim version.  You are wellcome  :)"
,TheRealRollie,2012-06-15T06:00Z,Update 9 final is now out
,SirReaper,2012-06-15T22:14Z,"@Eikkatin  

I googled that, there was an youtube video, but it says 1.6/update 9 beta..
Can someone explain whats the difference between this beta and the ""final"" previously mentioned ?

Guess i'll wait for a reloaded release or something."

,DerpyPaws,2012-06-18T05:43Z,"@Aadamski If you are running the game on Windows 7, your game will be saved in C:User>My Documents>My Games>Skyrim so they are not kept in the same file as the game itself. Game updates will never wipe out your saves."
