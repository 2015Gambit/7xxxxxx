[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-03-29T16:27Z,"Are you sure this isnt the same dvdscreener thats been out for a while , cause no one else has got a dvd rip yet , and the sample pics dont look dvd quality . 

You have uploaded quite a lot in the past so it would be unfair to call you a faker , but i do believe you have typed dvdrip by mistake . 

And if I'm wrong i will be back to say sorry ."
,THEONE1982,2012-03-29T19:06Z,"Sorry my man but this is how it came to me so this is what i take it for,

This is a legitimate uploader. 

Tnx!"
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-03-29T21:17Z,"Well i came back to say it's the best copy i've seen of this yet . 
TBH I still think its an r5 , anyway very watchable and good movie .
So cheers to      the one1982 ."
,peyotle,2012-03-29T22:29Z,"This is not a dvdrip. 

it is close to R5 and resolution is 720x400, so if you will watch it on any standard screen quality goes down. 

V:7
A:9"
,PauloFran,2012-03-30T01:10Z,"NOT DVDRip quality. Maybe TS, at most.
Thanks anyway."
,docz47,2012-03-30T18:25Z,"Jag är ganska kräsen av mig och hatar screeners.
Både video och ljud är av helt okej divx kvalite.
Men jag sklle aldrig köra den på en 42 tummarn.

trevlig helg

I'm pretty picky of me, and hate screeners.
Both video and audio are allright divx quality.
But I would never run it on a 42 screen.

nice weekend"
,lee280269,2012-03-30T18:41Z,"pointless upload. it's the same cam copy that every one else is calling a dvd screener etc.
The cam quality is blurry but not too bad just not what you expect from a 2gb file claiming to be a mint dvd rip."
,HellfireArrow,2012-05-25T16:38Z,C'mon people let's seed this awesome kick@$$ movie :)
