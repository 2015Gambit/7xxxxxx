[V],psspss,2012-03-31T09:14Z,i hope not.. havent had any of the 200 seeding it say so havent wagtched it yet myself.. i believe the intro is same as old episode but skimming it seems all new to me
[V],psspss,2012-03-31T10:42Z,"watched it all good another great episode
thought I saw a minor weather noise but thats all

cos it was a parellel universe the same story was
used in a different way while mixing in the
main plot which makes fringe so good"
