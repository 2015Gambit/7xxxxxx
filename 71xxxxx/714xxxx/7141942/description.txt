Cesta do praveku (Czechoslovakia - 1955)

Adventure / Live-Action / Family / Sci-Fi


NOTE:  At the same time but separately I am also uploading the 1960
English audio language version "Journey To The Beginning Of Time"
which has distinct and interesting differences from Cesta do praveku,
both versions are enjoyable and worthy of collecting.


directed by . . . Karel Zeman
written by. . . . J.A. Novotny, Karel Zeman


[original Czech audio, optional srt subtitles in Russian and English]


although very watchable do not expect remastered quality, file appears
to be a VHSrip from an older film print, it is mp4 and plays with VLC

Youngest of four boys one day finds a fossil of trilobite. So his older
friends take him on journey through prehistory, up to beginning of time,
to see real live trilobites.

Produced using a combination of 2-D and 3-D models, it was the first of
Zeman's productions to include actors in conjunction with stop-motion and
special effects, and won awards at the International Film Festivals of
Venice and Mannheim.
