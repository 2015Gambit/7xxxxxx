From the Infowars website:

On this, the Wednesday, March 28 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with investigator Bob Fletcher about weather weapons. Fletcher was interviewed during the Iran-Contra hearings and was a deposed witness for the Christic Institute's 24 million dollar legal proceedings against the Iran-Contra lineup. He is a founding member of the Militia of Montana. 

Alex also continues his discussion with pastor and author Lindsey Williams. In his Sunday, March 25 interview with Alex, Williams talked about the impending financial crash, what currency is a safe bet, and why Obama may not be re-elected due to his involvement in Keystone Pipeline.
