From the Infowars web site:

On the Friday, March 30 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Fritz Springmeier, author of Bloodlines of the Illuminati, an encyclopedia of rare, unbelievable information that exposes the dynasties that make up the global elite.

Alex also talks with depleted uranium expert Doug Rokke, who served as a member of the 3rd U.S. Army Medical Command's Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical special operations team. Major Rokke has been subjected to ongoing retaliation from Department of Defense officials for reporting the adverse health and environmental effects of uranium weapons. 

Alex gets into economic issues today with broadcaster and film-maker Max Keiser. Prior to being a broadcaster, Keiser was a stock broker on Wall Street.
