,mdx2035,2012-08-12T11:08Z,"The album ""Temple of Thought"" is an amazing addition to the Poets collection. This album really sounds a lot like Twilight Theater, which I love (considering it was the first POTF album I purchased). You get their classic rock feel in songs such as ""Running Out of Time"", and ""Kamikaze Love"", while getting the slower paced ballads such as ""Skin"", and ""The Ballad of Jeremiah Peacekeeper"". If that doesn't convince you, this edition comes with three more songs; all which are fantastic. I would recommend this to any POTF fan or any one else who would be interested. It's a can't miss. WARNING: Singing, Dancing, and Happy Thoughts are the side effects of this album......
Buy this album! And if you already own it, buy the bonus tracks!! "
