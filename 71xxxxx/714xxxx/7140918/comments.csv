,p1k4chu,2012-04-29T22:30Z,The savegame folder is missing. Just create a folder called SAVEGAME under XCOMA and you can save your games.
,bytetr,2012-08-02T07:37Z,"dosbox.conf should be edited for this game to be playable. I am running it on Win7 x64, but I am sure these changes are needed for older versions of Windows also:

fulldouble=true
output=overlay
cycles=max

Anyway, great torrent, mediocre game... Thanks for upload."
