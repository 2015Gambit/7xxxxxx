,p3r0x1d3,2012-03-31T06:06Z,"nvm, the begining was the same but then it changed."
,Spudgun17,2012-03-31T08:27Z,"Perfect quality as always from eztv, thanks! This is definitely the latest episode, bear in mind that Fringe is just plain bloody weird, what with all the multiple universes, duplicated characters etc. Cheers Pirate Bay!"

,kenywats,2012-04-01T01:15Z,"The order of the bests shows for me is: Game of Thrones; The Walking Dead; Dexter; Fringe. I don't Know how is Spartacus, but it has great audiences in TPB too. Others that I have usually wathing and I would recomend is Person of Interest, Alcatraz and Being Human US."
,pat3507us,2012-04-01T04:21Z,Hey aasimp. Its a great show. But you gotta start from season 1 episode 1. Its the only way.
