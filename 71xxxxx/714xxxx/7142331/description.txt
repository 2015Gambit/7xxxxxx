AnyDVD HD comes with same functionality as AnyDVD, but with additional features for full Blu-ray and HD DVD support, including Blu-ray and HD DVD movies.

Allows you to watch movies over a digital display connection, without HDCP-compliant graphics card and without HDCP-compliant display. No need to buy an expensive monitor. Sweet!

AnyDVD HD is the "must have" utility for the serious home theater enthusiast using a media center / home theater PC.

AnyDVD comes with its own UDF 2.5 file system, no need to install 3rd party UDF 2.5 driver under Windows XP. 

I downloaded the trial version and tried it with NOVA KILLER and all works fine. Just install anydvd, then run NOVA KILLER with admin priveleges and your done. Enjoy.
