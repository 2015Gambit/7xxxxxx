My speed has always been higher than the advertised speed and I live in a 35yr old building. Bitcomet will go as fast as your ISP allows. No need to change client.

The movie was good, but not as good as previous 1 or 3. The problem with this one was they tried to ad to much comedy, which made the movie look sloppy.
Seriously, the team made so many mistakes. The whole thing was based on luck, instead of awesome skills."

@asianjun810, i took a liitle time away fro PB, when I came back all the torrents had been changed to ""magnet links"" (what ever that means). As i understand, when you have selected to Dl Utorrent doesnt show any files if you wait for a few moments you'll see the files pop up in utorrent.

Some of the uploaders put a lot of time and in some cases risk into what they do, I'd like for the others like myself who only dl & seed, to post quality realated comments or at least show some appreciation to the up's.

Thanks extremezone & all the others who are out there..
