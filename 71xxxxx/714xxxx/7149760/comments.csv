,jbeed,2012-04-02T06:22Z,"hey! thanks for the upload!
could u guys please tell me if this works with my LT2 firmware or do i have to patch it from LT3 to LT2 like i did with soul calibur 5? 
and, is it true that in the future i wont be able to play my patched copies due to upcoming firmwares or something like that? THANKS!"
[V],boobsman,2012-04-02T14:59Z,"Sorry i don't have a console running LT2.0 so cannot test, you should really update to LT3.0 anyway as MS will only try to make things harder to play copies, you need to stay ahead of them by updating to the latest firmware."
,Carm1905,2012-04-02T22:32Z,Has anyone updated to 14719 via disc with LT3.0? Will this flash back to stock or is it safe?
