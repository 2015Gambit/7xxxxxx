,kornbred69,2012-04-09T02:36Z,"oh, i guess this goes without saying, but, @ home people if you like sunfly PLEASE SUPPORT SUNFLY! They are the only decent company left after Sound Choice went douche... I just found out sunfly will let a kj use digital media, and sell it digitally @ http://www.sunflykaraoke.com they even show you to decent software to host! 2eur a song or 2.67usd a song! 
If your a giging dj and are not supporting them, shame on you! "
