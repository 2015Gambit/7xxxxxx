As they say, Clapton IS GodΓÇªat least the god of blues guitar.

Here's my Apple Lossless collection of Clapton, mostly studio albums..some live. Twenty complete albums plus selected songs from the Crossroads 4 CD compilation box set.

Presented in Apple Lossless. All tracks were ripped from CD or converted from FLAC using XLD for those of us who use iTunes on Apple products.

Enjoy!
