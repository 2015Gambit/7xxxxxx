"Boogaloo", Zagreb, Croatia, 12.12.2011.




This is the complete Exodus show in Zagreb, Croatia, on December 12 2011, during the "Thrash Fest Classics" Tour.
For this tour they played only the songs from their first three albums ("Bonded by Blood", "Pleasures of the Flesh" and "Fabulous Disaster").
I recorded this with digital camera from behind the mixing desk and the quality of picture and sound is very good, check it on youtube:
