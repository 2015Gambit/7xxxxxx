The movie is pretty ok but in the beginning after the biznez meting until about 15 min that is the worst part of the whole movie and you need about 10 min to mentally stabilize after such extreme suckiness but if you do the rest of the movie is good"
,MCooper86,2012-04-01T13:54Z,Thank you!
,mutz-nutz,2012-04-01T13:55Z,"@lizardomanson

how am i a liar, in my opinion the movie wasn't great, or if your talking about how long it took me to download, then i don't care what you think, I know how long it took. You must have a shit connection aswell. "
,madtagger,2012-04-01T20:00Z,"Does this fills out the whole screen or have bars under and over it? I know it's a 2:35 aspect ratio, so it should have empty spaces on top of it, and under. I downloaded the Amiable 1080p rip and it filled out my whole screen, all stretched to do so and I hated it, people looked elongated and such. Will this one to do the same?? Answer please. Thanks!!"
