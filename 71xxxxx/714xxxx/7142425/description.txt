For those who can't seem to get the German languages to load properly (rob7812);

DL this ISO, and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!

DO NOT use this if you have NOT DL'd and installed THESE ISO's:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso

And YES you CAN manually install the languages, you just have to KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

If you follow the instructions on these ISO's then you will have all 5 levels of German
installed AND activated.

Aufwiedersehen,
