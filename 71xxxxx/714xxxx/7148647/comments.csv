,NYGMEN,2012-05-04T23:23Z,"This works...just follow the instructions in the ""How to Install and Activate"" folder. Install the update that pops up. Copy and paste the email address/product key both times. Install the codec pack too. Change settings in Windows Firewall with Advanced Security outbound rules under Media Center Extenders to allow. And you're good to go."
