,oldschoolforsure,2012-04-04T00:44Z,"Works fine, however......disks required for burning a file this size are expensive.  After all the time, effort, and money spent, you might as well just buy the movie new from your favorite retailer.  Also you should have a newer player for viewing, and you will need a newer writer, to get this bunny buned properly."
