They're all music from various other artists.

-Nr 1 plays in Ceasar Flickermans show.
-Nr 2 and 3. Not 100% sure about these two but one of them(3?) plays in the Cornucopia bloodbath, the other is either the main TrackerJacker scene or supplies blowing up. (only seen the movie once yet and there was so much stuff to pay attention to, especially when you know the book. I just remember that all of these scenes had really effective music.)
-Nr 4 is the intense moment leading up to the TrackerJacker scene
-Nr 5 when, you know who, dies
-Nr 6 plays in the final scenes (Cranes execution and crowning of victors) and was apparently also used in a movie called Hanna

Apart from Nr1 (which has a suiting comedic aspect), these are all one of the most fitting and unexpected kinds of background music I have heard in a movie.

This wide variety of interesting music coupled with the rest of the Score, by James Newton Howard really works amazing for the movie."
