thanks so much for this man, really appreciate it. but one thing im wondering is why each disk is separated in multiple files. in disk 1 theres like 23 different 1-4 minute clips. why not just combine them? and one last thing is in the 'update' rar., why did you put stuff in it like an alex jones documentary. dont get me wrong its an amazing doc. but it just seems random.

but that aside thanks for the upload, this should really be helpful!"
