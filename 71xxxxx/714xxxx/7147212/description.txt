Media Description:

Blending soul, rock, dubstep and drum and bass, their music is as dynamic, versatile and unexpected as their back story. Extended singer/songwriter jams incorporate dubstep sections as bridges, hard rocking guitar work duels with robust synthetics and thunderous low end bass over vibrant percussive rhythms, and in both voice and instrumentation infectious melody consistently shines through.

They're a band with songs that make just as much sense when listened to with headphones strapped on, as they do in the heat of a capacity concert moment. And with Tiki Taane as co-producer on their self-titled debut album, they have married what they're known for with where they're going. Leave your preconceptions at the door and let Six60 show you the world as they see it, one song at a time.
