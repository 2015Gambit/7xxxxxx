,ryan1993,2012-04-09T19:15Z,"yify, i have downloaded this movie and ""Hop"" recently and when i play them back on my ps3 they play 2X faster than the normal speed, which is odd as i have downloaded from you before and they have been great, do you have any idea why this is the case all of a sudden?"
,jsniper34,2012-04-17T04:48Z,"@ryan1993 this has happened to me too, only with this copy of New Year's Eve.  Worked perfectly on computer, but on PS3, 2x faster... very odd."
