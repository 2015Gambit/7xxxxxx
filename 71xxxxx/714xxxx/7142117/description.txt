-The Chosen Rejects Nirvana Bootleg Box Set (1985-1994) becomes the mother of all of Nirvana bootlegs,  leaving to  Outcesticide completely out of the race, both in content like in quality.
Each track chosen on The Chosen Rejects  was taken from the best sources available, and remastered by JWB, was compiled from the best sounding ,  EQ was properly adjusted for every track. Mono material was reduced to true mono. Most, if not all, of the tracks have been speed corrected somewhere along the line. There was no hiss/noise reduction used on any material! 
What follows is a collage of the rarest and unmissable Nirvana tracks,  divided into four different categories, giving to the listener a look to  Nirvana┬┤s discography that i think   than ever will never have  from an official release. 
Keep away your  "Outcesticides" this weekend  and enjoy the best experience with this  Nirvana classic authentic...
