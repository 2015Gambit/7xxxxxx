,darraman,2012-04-01T13:02Z,how can you watch 3d movies on pc..please help
,kubanored,2012-04-09T06:23Z,this 3d movie is useless too blurry  the 3d  effects for the eyes
,Ramrunner73,2012-04-10T23:58Z,"@kubanored and all who think this is blurry: See if it looks ok wearing your glasses upside down. I'm not kidding. If it does (like it did on my Samsung UA55D7000LM), you need to go in to the menu and in the 3D setting tell the TV to swap Left and Right. For some strange reason this YIFY release seems to have the left and right swapped. They don't normally. "

,Boanne50,2012-05-19T14:34Z,"Blurry, because L/R images switched.
You have to turn glasses upside down to get 3D effect.
Beside that, the quallity is EXELLENT(On Panasonic tx-p50VT30E TV)
