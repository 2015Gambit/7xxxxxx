,Altaraz,2012-04-04T22:02Z,"Woah there, Getthro. Why don't you take a pill? I've only just started doing torrents, so I must've put it under the wrong category. -SORRY- 

But I'm sure you're right, calling people ""idiots"" and ""thick"" for making a mistake MUST be the best way to go about things!"
,revolver75,2012-04-06T23:09Z,and yet you continue to do it with all your uploads this is not the first and it has been commented on before but u still do it.
,Altaraz,2012-04-09T03:01Z,"Actually, I did all of my video uploads at relatively the same time. For some reason, I'm not able to modify my torrents. I messaged TPB Admin about this but still no response. In future, I'll make doubly sure to ensure that I place my torrents in the correct category."
,Altaraz,2012-04-09T03:03Z,"PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS NOT A HIGHRES MOVIE - IT IS A HIGH-QUALITY DVD-RIP. AS SOON AS I FIGURE OUT HOW TO MODIFY MY TORRENTS, I'LL PLACE IT IN THE CORRECT CATEGORY. I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE."
