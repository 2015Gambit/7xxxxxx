Reunion is a live album by heavy metal band Black Sabbath.

After the departure of vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1979, Black Sabbath's line-up slowly lost stability 
and never quite recovered. Following a couple of one-off reunions in 1985 and 1992, the original 
Sabbath line-up of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward reformed, playing sporadic 
dates until Dio replaced Ozzy a second time, reforming the Heaven and Hell lineup to tour following 
the release of the compilation album The Dio Years.

This 2-CD live album was put together from the first two shows after the reunion, at the Birmingham 
NEC. Along with live versions of tracks such as "Paranoid", "N.I.B.", "Black Sabbath" and "Iron Man" 
it also features two new studio tracks - "Selling My Soul" and "Psycho Man". This was the only new 
material to have been officially released by Black Sabbath post-reunion until three new tracks 
appeared on the post-Ozzy compilation Black Sabbath: The Dio Years in 2007. The two new tracks on 
Reunion were also released on a single CD in the USA.
