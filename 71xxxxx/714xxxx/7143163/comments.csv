 M: Suprisingly not as bad as the comercials let on. But plenty of plot holes, moments of disbelief, and some pretty bad editting at times. 
 Atleast they weren't afraid to kill people off."

,st0gey,2012-04-01T10:10Z,"Thanks for sharing, SaM.



Audio and video quality are fine. The movie is f*cking terrible. Piss poor script, feeble plot and weak, unimaginative directing. I don't know what the threshold is for 'low budget' in movies these days but this piece of crap has 'B movie' written all over it. Honestly, even 'Skyline' was better than this horse shit.
Want to see a good Emile Hirsch movie? Watch the superb 'Into The Wild'. Want to see a good alien invasion sci fi movie? See the 1978 remake of 'Invasion of the Bodysnatchers', that's a f*cking classic."
