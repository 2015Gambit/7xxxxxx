,NinjaBear347,2012-04-10T12:42Z,"when it says ""in english and japanese audio"" is that like you can change it or half of it is in english and the other half is in japanese?

also are the subtitles on all the time or can you turn them off? cheers"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-10T18:35Z,"If you are using Vlc right click and go to audio click on Trak English For English Audio or Japanese FOr japanese AUdio
The subs can be On or off just go to subs option and Disable them"

Eh, it'll be worth it."
,rhenzblue,2012-08-04T02:04Z,Who was the subber for this? 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-04T23:28Z,rhenzblue if you ever see Dual Audio that means Funimation release a DVD or Blu ray and the subs are directly from them. 
,LunarisDream,2012-08-08T19:37Z,"Great up Daman, thanks a lot!
Seeded to 11.4 GB so far, will continue seeding for as long as I can (although it's sporadic).
A question though: I'm using VLC and the English subtitles aren't showing up for me. Is this happening to anyone else?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-08T23:18Z,"lunaris, make sure to turn the Subs on via track,"
,kupo603,2012-09-19T07:29Z,I will actually seed this.
