Demoniac [1979] VHS Rip

A disturbed priest, who witness an occult ritual, thinks the people are possessed and start a private inquisition to exorcise the demons by torturing them to death.

LetΓÇÖs all thank Jess Franco giving us this time capsule on film. The atmosphere of this French trash pile absolutely oozes 70s Euro trash pussystink from every pore. And the dialogue is something you have to hear to believe. A bizarre, perverted old man, on the run from Interpol, is murdering prostitutes while hot on the trail of a satanic cult.
