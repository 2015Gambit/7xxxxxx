No it's not. Say's invite only.
And, TvTeam. I'm not sure if anyone else is having problems with your torrents, but anything marked by AFG will play fine on my computer but when trying to stream to my xbox 360 it plays fine for about 1:20 fine and then goes into like a shutter voice/slomo mode and becomes unwatchable. This is for all AFG Torrents. I have come to completely ovoid these at all cost unless they are the only avi version available. Thanks for your time."
