Sons.of.Guns.S04E05.HDTV.xvid-][ Jesse James Surprise ][ 29-Mar-2012 ] avi

some call this Season 3 but im sticking with the old naming

converted to xvid 1100bit to improve quality for fast scenes
640x352 and mp3

I checked it quickly all seems good and in sync

take it or leave it but help seed if grabbing

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
its it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
