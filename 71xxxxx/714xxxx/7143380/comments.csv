Its a .rar file, but once you extract it with appropriate software [eg BitZipper], its a good watch.

Ignore comments of ""kohsamuikid"", its a good download.You need to extract it and your good to go!!!!"

Are you not uploading Panorama anymore? That's a real shame, I love that show. Might I respectfully request you continue to upload Panorama?
Anyway, thanks again. You upload some great and high quality stuff."
