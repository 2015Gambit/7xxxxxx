,iohannfus,2012-03-29T12:07Z,i suppose this is the same release ... with exe tempered 
,S8W7,2012-03-29T12:17Z,This release is a couple hundred megs bigger than the others. Hmm!
,MaceI,2012-03-29T12:47Z,that FIX.rar looks nice..but can't download it :(
,CanadianPsycho,2012-03-29T13:12Z,^^^^^ I hear that fixed does look nice cant wait to be seeded 9 mb's :)
,S8W7,2012-03-29T13:50Z,"Downloading, well... waiting for seeds. We'll see what comes of this!"
,Nounread,2012-03-29T14:13Z,everyone just hoping beyond hope the fix will work. when the odds are pretty low.
,dyfan91,2012-03-29T14:15Z,"@webchella

You wouldn't mind making a torrent with just the fix? Most of us already downloaded the Skidrow version and just want to get a working crack. Priority on the fix alone doesn't work for my torrent. It would be most appricated!"
,zhyper22,2012-03-29T14:24Z,"Is the crack working? If yes, then someone upload crack only please?"
,iohannfus,2012-03-29T14:29Z,yes ... the isos are good ... i'm sceptic about that rar file :) ... let's see :D
,iohannfus,2012-03-29T14:35Z,"if anyone have downloaded that fix.rar, plz upload it  
10x"
,E-PRO11,2012-03-29T15:38Z,why the hell are this users freaking uploading the same game with the same bad crack over and over? webchella did you not know that the files you upload don't work? did you try the game out before spending the time to upload it? why are you wasting peoples time? people will download this game and it won't work and it takes like 12 hours to download.
,E-PRO11,2012-03-29T15:39Z,can people profit in some way by upload this shit? is that why they keep upload shit that does work over and over again?
,E-PRO11,2012-03-29T15:53Z,"everyone stop downloading this it doesn't work. non of them do yet. wait for a better release, bc this is a steamrip and thats why it doesn't work. they have to totally re engineer the game to get it to work and they haven't done it yet. "
,S8W7,2012-03-29T16:57Z,E-PRO11: Why do you need to dash our dreams like that? :(
[V],azizex666,2012-03-29T18:28Z,"I don't see steam mentioned anywhere so this might be it, heres to hoping."
,qiucheng,2012-03-29T19:32Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, i have selected to download the fix and got stucked at 98%. This is probaly some fake just to keep your hopes up. So DONT WASTE Your time on this,"
,E-PRO11,2012-03-29T20:06Z,i'm not dashing your hopes man. i want this just has much as you guys. i'm just saying this is a huge waste of time. it's like repeatedly kicking yourself and expecting to feel no pain. look try this one it was just uploaded and it seems to be differently packed...so maybe it has the files we need to make the game run.  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7142139/Total.War.Shogun.2.Fall.of.the.Samurai-SKIDROW
,premiado,2012-03-29T21:32Z,"Oh please dude, the game detected a tampered .exe, it is obviously an imperfect crack, nothing to do with missing files."
[V],azizex666,2012-03-29T22:28Z,"downloading, will comment if it works or not when its done."
[V],azizex666,2012-03-30T03:48Z,shit is stuck on 50% forever
,CanadianPsycho,2012-03-30T05:56Z,This must be a april fools joke or some shit because I have been at 0% for hours. :/
[V],azizex666,2012-03-30T06:13Z,"@CanadianPsycho
are u trying to download just the FIX.rar?"
,E-PRO11,2012-03-30T06:42Z,I'm at 50% to...well I don't even know anymore if this shit is worth it. why don't we come back in like 2 weeks when they will finally have at least one working version of the game? or buy it.
,E-PRO11,2012-03-30T06:45Z,I think all the seeders have left this torrent...this is stupid. I'm just going to come back a lot later.
,AlexD86,2012-03-30T08:10Z,"The ISO's were being downloaded just fine. Anyhow, Im trying to download the FIX.rar for about a day, no luck there."
,piratedownloader171,2012-03-30T08:35Z,@23 Gbs and 3 seeds LOL
,nipozepek,2012-03-30T16:06Z,The crack in Total War Shogun 2 - Rise of the Samurai (2011) [PCDVD][MULTi8] works fine witaut creashin butt not for Fall.of.the.Samurai we have to wait for the crackfix !!!!!!!!!!!!
,LordDakier,2012-03-30T19:37Z,I can confrim the FIX.RAR is indeed not a fix. I'd give up on this one. Download the base files from Extremezone's and wait for another crack.
,whiteorc,2012-03-30T20:17Z,"Yes, this fix rar is not working with skidrows dvd's, but i will test it also on this release dvd's just to be sure."
,LordDakier,2012-03-30T20:44Z,"Doubt it will work but remember to delete the original files.

Also does anyone get the artillery limber and unlimber crash?"
,Cuna,2012-03-30T22:29Z,"ANYONE know how to host a multiplayer campaign? doesnt matter if its shogun or the expansions. just any. it says can not host game every time i try.

any ideas?"
,Senryakku,2012-03-31T03:33Z,"In order to host multiplayer you need greenluma to crack steam, and a shogun exe fix
It's a steam game, you can't play LAN that easily."
,regul13,2012-04-01T11:55Z,"I have a crack does not work, even the game does not start ((((Try someone else to run the game and accomplish your goal here to see prices"
,IAmShogun,2012-04-04T07:46Z,"All 3 games start well. All 3 games crash , mostly during battles."
,thugluv1877,2012-04-05T11:37Z,"aight to the retards who keep saying make a torrent with just the fix in it, you do release that on torrents in utorrent anyway you can pick which files in the torrent to download, its like pretty basic, retards!"
,persis,2012-04-21T23:18Z,"Anyway to get this game cracked?
the FIX.RAR is not a fix. we need a proper crack!"
,persis,2012-04-21T23:21Z,"yes, All 3 games start but all 3 games crash right away... the game detects the pirate version...
we need a real crack"
,aeeb12,2012-04-24T20:00Z,it sucks because it don't work
