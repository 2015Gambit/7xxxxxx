Can you please upload the Settle and Carlisle route? :)"
,SwainyHD,2012-04-07T17:20Z,"If your getting a consist error try making your own consist, sometimes buffers don't appear on trains and this means it is faulty thus meaning consist errors simply edit the scenario and re-add the trains in I did it and it works perfect, just use your noggin."
,DataAndroid,2012-04-07T19:23Z,"Got it to work, thanks
Thank you very much tpb_4_ever, you're the best.
