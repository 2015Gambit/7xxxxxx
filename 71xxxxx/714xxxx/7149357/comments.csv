,Flandreloli,2012-04-01T17:43Z,"Hm, this torrent does not seem to work.

The other two torrents works, but the extraction stops at 41% on this one with an error."
,ivanhoe68,2012-04-01T19:46Z,"There is some rar files missing in this one. Hey Totenkruez, you should try the games before you put them on the site, you could loose your SKULL."
[T],Totenkruez,2012-04-02T04:36Z,"01. There are 18 files in this torrent (16 ZIP archive, 2 text).
02. The 16 ZIP archive files extract out another 18 files (16 RAR archive, 2 text).
03. The 16 RAR archive files extract one installer.

Yes, it's double-packed.
No, I have no idea why scene double-packs small games.

Regardless, file extraction worked with no problems for me.

@Flandreloli: Force a hash re-check on this torrent in your client.

@ivanhoe68: I think you're having trouble extracting the ZIP files. Try selecting them all and extracting at the same time."

The problem is the installer.

When I have extracted all files and I run the installer it stops at 41% with an error."

It's my homemade repack of this. I've personally ran it on WinXP SP3 32-bit and played through the first three stages without a problem. Use that upload if you're having problems with this one."
