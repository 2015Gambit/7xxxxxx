The first game in the Gundemonium trilogy, and tells a story of alchemy gone wrong in an alternate 18th century. Its galvanized and finely tuned side-scrolling bullet-hell shoot-'em-up gameplay sets it well above most other games in the genre. The game is deceptively simple from the outset, but has very well-thought-out gameplay mechanics. There are multiple playable characters, expertly crafted enemies and bullet patterns, a variable-difficulty "Phase Level" system, a risk-and-reward bullet "Friction" system, a "Demonic Shift" ability that's not for the faint of heart, and much more.
