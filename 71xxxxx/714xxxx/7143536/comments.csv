,unnim2,2012-03-30T07:18Z,thank you
,Maddogsargent,2012-03-30T11:19Z,I'm guessing this is the start of Vol.7?
,bucbag,2012-03-30T12:33Z,"his is offa atomic-robo.com, outta Brian!s finger-mouth:

 ""Every issue is a collection of several short stories, four or eight pages each, with scripts by me and art by friends weâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;ve made over the years. This way Scott can keep churning out pages for Volume 7 and you get twice the Robo without putting him in the hospital or crazy house"""
,bucbag,2012-03-30T12:38Z,"oh, and Volume 7 is supposed to start in June, and i think itll be called ""The Flying She-Devils of the Pacific"""
