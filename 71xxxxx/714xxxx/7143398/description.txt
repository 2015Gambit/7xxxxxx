BIOHAZARD 2 & 3 as SoureNext re-released them.
Biohazard 2 is left intact and I've written a installer for Biohazard 3, as I could only find it in a ZIP file. (and damn, it was a very rare find!)

Both games were tested on Windows 7 x64 SP1 and did work fine. Thou Bio2 SOMETIMES did freeze before a cinematic. It was very rare. Biohazard 3 works fine, including The Mercenaries.

For those of you who do not know:
These are the japanese re-releases of RESIDENT EVIL 2 & 3 for the PC by SourceNext.

The re-release of Biohazard 2 includes 640x480 FMV scenes with 30 frames per second (as opposed to the original 320x240 @ 15 fps originals). This is not an upscale.
This release also does not have the save problems of the original PC release AND does feature a single executable instead of the original PC version's dual executables.

The re-release of Biohazard 3 also has slightly better FMV scenes and an added ARRANGE MODE, which is in fact the original Easy / Hard mode of the original PC USA version. (as the japanese difficulties are easier)

Both games present japanese subtitles and menus with english voice-overs. Only download if you can live with it, no complaints accepted. :P
