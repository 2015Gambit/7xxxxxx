,djeargazm,2012-04-11T18:56Z,"Works great on my HTC 3D EVO.  I was a little surprised though.  I assumed this version would just upgrade my previous version 1.1.23 but it didn't.  It installed a second instance of the game and I lost all of my progress.  Even when I tried to transfer the TW_Save.dat file from the old version to the new, I still needed to create a new profile and start from scratch.  If anyone figures out a way to get your progress over to the new version that would be great!"
,Timmmeh,2012-04-30T05:03Z,"Works great, but after a while it force closes. Not too big of a deal bc it saves wherever you are in the game, but annoying after a while. It was free so i have no issues dealing with it.  Samsung Infuse"
,prognosis,2012-08-08T21:27Z,Game crashes frequently on Samsung Galaxy S. Fun game but a got me into trouble with my ISP.  Beware!!! I have downloaded all games for PC and then I download this little file and it gets me into trouble.  Just keep that in mind.
