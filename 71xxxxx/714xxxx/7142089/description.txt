The Tube
A look behind the scenes of the London underground as it undergoes the biggest overhaul in its history, focusing on key members of staff and some of the problems they face. The series follows key members of the London Underground's 19,000-strong staff, from CEO Howard Collins through to the litter pickers who clear miles of track every night. Drivers, station staff and emergency response workers reveal their unique perspective on the travelling public. Capturing the tube in all its guises, from tourist transport to suburban commute, or the last train home for partygoers, this series also looks behind the scenes of the tube's ten billion pound upgrade - and how the process of dragging a Victorian infrastructure kicking and screaming into the 21st century doesn't always run on rails.




4)  Overcrowding 
The number of passengers on the Tube has gone up by a third in the last ten years. David Waboso, London Underground's head of upgrades, thinks he has the answer. But new trains on the Victoria Line keep letting him down because of a problem with the doors - and a newly-installed signal fails, causing huge delays. At Tottenham Court Road station, supervisor Barry Griffiths is keeping the crowds moving - in the midst of huge rebuilding works making the station six times bigger. But will his customers be impressed with the results?
