Titanic 2012 S01E02  

Show info can be found at:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_%28TV_series%29 and http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1869152/ 

The first episode apparently had a few more minutes of content when it was aired in the UK, which resulted in that version being labeled UNCUT. Whether that also happens with this episode is unknown.

This episode aired on Global Canada HD on March 28, 2012. It was recorded via analog and the quality is about A8 V8 - very watchable but not up to the quality of scene releases.

The file is undersized due to the behavior of AutoGK. err0001 is not part of the scene, so if somewhat lower quality or oddly-sized files are a problem for you, feel free not to download this torrent. 

Comments for err0001 can be left at demonoid or thepiratebay. They will be read, but may or may not be acted on.
