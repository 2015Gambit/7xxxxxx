The team tries to catch a ruthless woman convicted of murdering her husband by stabbing him 48 times, who escaped from prison on a school bus. It turns out the woman was tricking men into thinking she really cared for them so they would do what she wanted and help her escape. Charlie and Ray's special task force must catch her before she hurts more people -- and also make sure her 14-year-old son stays safe. Meanwhile, Lloyd's gambling debt increases and a scary Born Again inmate threatens his life if he doesn't come up with the money right away.
