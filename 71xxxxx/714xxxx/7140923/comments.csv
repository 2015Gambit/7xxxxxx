[T],MrDowntown,2012-03-30T07:17Z,RALKM  - It appears you did not SEED this torrent enough as it is Stuck about halfway. Try SUPER-SEEDING
,ralkm,2012-03-30T09:38Z,@MrDowntown And how do I do that?
,ralkm,2012-03-30T09:49Z,@mrdowntown It should be superseeding now. Thank you
[T],MrDowntown,2012-03-31T06:48Z,"It sucks, I know - esp if you have a slow connection and after someone gets 100% and then doesnt seed back you will get so angry, just stop it and restart and itll start super-seeding again. eventually those 169 leechers will turn into 100+ seeders and your job is done.

Also you should add thumbnail via bayimg:
http://bayimg.com/

upload a pic of the cover from either google or the publishers website (saved to your comp)

make sure you select:
Settings
 Resize to:
[X] 300x300 TPB - torrent image]

it'll then give you an img url, ONLY copy the 9 digit code at end and put it in bayimg box when uploading torrent to TPB (PS make sure you dont add a space before the code)"
,zeroxmaverick,2012-03-31T21:21Z,Has anybody found issue #14 uploaded anywhere?
,dbranson17,2012-03-31T23:53Z,Brutal! With these collections you might try one or two issues at a time and no more until seeding gets underway...
[T],MrDowntown,2012-04-01T01:24Z,3 days 92.6% - RALKM - we all appreciate the upload but you have to leave it seeding until the seed/leech numbers reverse
