My Dad comes home tomorrow or Friday, so all will be back to normal before the weekend."

Glad to hear the good news about your Dad!

Thanks for looking out for all of us in the meantime - it's really appreciated, especially given your circumstances!  Wow!!!

Take care and best wishes for a continued smooth recovery!
