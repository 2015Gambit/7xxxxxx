,alucardvt,2012-03-31T21:41Z,"Tested it and it really seems to work, my readiness went to 100% :) Running on a pirated copy"
,azisco,2012-03-31T22:27Z,"Glad to hear it, I should also point out that copying over your local_profile file will erase achievements and settings, which I just found out. Shouldn't be a big deal though since it doesn't seem to touch the actually game saves."
,PuN1sH3Rz,2012-03-31T23:18Z,Even with Readiness level at 100 % you will have sad endings :(
,GObonzo,2012-04-01T01:25Z,readiness was normal and endings were great even without this crap
,azisco,2012-04-01T02:54Z,Are you saying that it didn't work? Do you have a legal or pirated copy? Maybe it only works on pirated versions.
,OmniNegro,2012-04-01T03:55Z,"When a game requires you to do something you do not want to do in order to force you to cooperate with people you do not want to play with, the game is fucking broken. 

The entire ME series has been getting worse from the start. What is next? Blood, urine, and stool samples to play the copy you fucking bought?

Fuck them. They lost their fucking minds a long time ago. Thank you for posting this. I doubt I will ever play the awful game, but if I ever pick it up at a garage sale and have nothing better to do I will cheat my hairy ass off with this."
,PuN1sH3Rz,2012-04-01T04:05Z,I have original game with 100 % and you can still get same ending as 50 %. Depends on war score much.
,kaliver,2012-04-01T05:52Z,"Some people like to whine from a position of ignorance, though. I'm fairly certain I got the best ending with no MP played. QQ "
,prototype.06,2012-04-01T06:47Z,"FYI all: it is impossible to get 4000 EMS (2nd-best ending) by playing a perfect game single player (no mutiplayer, 50% readiness rating)... so aiming for the 5000 EMS required for the 'best' ending is even more so (heh) impossible without that 100% readiness gained through multiplayer (or this cheat). I'd done most everything and couldn't get past 3700 myself, so yeh... that's that."
,azisco,2012-04-01T14:55Z,"kaliver, to get the 4000 points you need to have imported a save and your choices have to have been close to perfect. Moreover in ME3 you have to pay attention to every side quest and then you might reach 4000 points. However expecting everyone to do that is foolish, and Bioware expects the players to play some multiplayer in order to increase the readiness rating. Reaching 4000 with a readiness rating of 50% is just making the game unnecessarily frustrating for yourself."
,afthika,2012-04-02T00:03Z,"so did anyone tried it if it works? it shows for me that readiness is 100% and I have 7k EMS, but somewhy still when I choose the destroying the reapers option, I don't see shepard taking a breath, when do I have to use this, from the start, or just before attacking Cerberus?

ps.: I used it from the restart mission when you get up on the Citadel, and also tried it with a save when I was between cerberus and going to earth on the normandy, I don't know if it has to be before Cerberus or what?"
,azisco,2012-04-02T00:31Z,"I haven't tested to see if it changes the ending, but I can't see why it wouldn't work. I'll probably finish it within a week so I'll know then."
,The4X3R,2012-04-02T05:42Z,Was looking for it!
,afthika,2012-04-02T23:31Z,"ok, nvm my question before, I tested it, so in short IT WORKS YAY! in a bit longer, if you use it during the last missions, cerberus and earth, anywhere between them, on the normandy or like this, it won't work, but if you have a save which is at, or before the point where after the ending the game drops you back, it'll work, so before you attack the cerberus base"
,khadhowf,2012-04-03T00:42Z,"@azisco Thank you so much for the up, azisco! It's working great!

@Everyone else:

Great Scott! It's working!

Confirmed working:
http://www.imagebam.com/image/01dc69182855570
http://www.imagebam.com/image/aab326182857479

With a Readiness Rating of 100% I can finally use up my hard earned Military Strength of 13125 and get an Effective Military Strength of 13125! Sweet!
I never played the multiplayer part of ME3 and now I never will :P
Before I only got about 6562 (because half of the soldiers couldn't aim or something, due to the Readiness Rating of 50% I got earlier). I know it won't matter for the ending but at least I can ""use"" all of the army. Oh well...
It feels like with a higher Readiness Rating most of the army would be more likely to survive. What do you think? (Just speculating...)"
,khadhowf,2012-04-03T00:44Z,"I got my Readiness Rating to 100% after just replacing the file mentioned file! Works like a charm.
And Yes, I use the cracked version of ME3 with all things unlocked (including DLC, Armors, Weapons, Dog, Clothing, etc) with all the firewall settings blocking every attempt of contacting the Origin servers :P

This will not change the ending to a happy one, sadly. But I knew it wouldn't. Just saying.

To cheer you guys up a little I just found out one positive thing. EDI = Sexbot, Confirmed:
http://www.imagebam.com/image/cd336b182856775 :P

If you're going to save the galaxy, you might as well enjoy the time. So I always bring EDI with my team, no matter if it's strategically correct or not. I confess it's just for the sake of spotting some sweet cameltoe in-game.

If you're interested. I played all of the Mass Effect games with all DLC's 100% complete
Female Soldier, Spacer, War Hero, 100% Paragon choises, Romancing Liara, Faithful to Liara throughout ME2, Recruitment / Loyalty Missions 100%, Saved council, Cured Genophage, etc (100% everything shortly speaking).
Tried all endings with the same outcome in ME3.

Hoping to see a DLC for an alternate ending soon, just like most of you guys."
,azisco,2012-04-03T01:06Z,"Wait so can anyone confirm 100% whether or not this changes the ending? Preferably in a way that does not spoil it for me.

It sounds like afthika got it working by using the cheat earlier in the game, but khadhowf seems to be sure that it doesn't change the ending."
,tikru2,2012-04-05T12:12Z,"I can confirm that this allows you to have ""the best ending"". I used this before the attack to the cerberus base and played to the end.

I tried changing my total military strenght with some tool and it didn't change the end.

So this is your best bet to have the ending you want. Unfortunately you don't have your achievements anymore."
,azisco,2012-04-05T22:48Z,"All right, thanks, that's a relief. Carry on everybody."
,azisco,2012-04-07T15:46Z,"Okay, just finished the game and it does seem to work. In fact I'm not sure why I'd think it wouldn't work.

Also I thought the ending was pretty great, I'm scratching my head trying to figure out why everyone is angry about it. It's basically what we expected, and if you don't like it there's always the indoctrination theory to give an interesting alternative perspective."
,tikru2,2012-04-08T14:03Z,"Well you need 5000 EMS if you don't save Anderson and 4000 EMS if you save him in order to have the breathing ending.

Yeah I didn't realise what was wrong in the end when i played it. Although I was crying my eyes out for the last 2 hours cos my favorite trilogy was going to end.

But then after looking from the Internet it's pretty clear why the end sucks. It is full of plotholes ja with absolutely no closure. Let's see what happens in summer when the DLC comes. I don't think it will be IndocTheory but I hope they provide something good to the end."
,azisco,2012-04-08T15:56Z,"Yeah I did look into the controversy and there are a lot of plot holes. I think the thing I didn't like the most was the mass relays being destroyed. Kinda ruins the outlook for the future.

Also amen on the crying I invested 100 hours into these games and to see them end, no matter the quality of the ending, is pretty emotional. Especially at 2 AM when I can barely tell what's going on."
,VAplomb,2012-04-13T22:40Z,"I replace Local_Profile but in the London mission, only 50% of ground forces arrived. Is that normal? i got 100% galactic readiness when I check before Cerberus and London mission and Hammer was still wiped out."
,azisco,2012-04-14T04:43Z,"*MAJOR SPOILERS*

Even if you have max EMS, only 50% of hammer forces land. EMS only affects your ending options and whether Earth survives or not if you destroy the reapers, as well as some other minor details. An easy way to know if you got the ""best ending"" is to do the ""destroy reapers"" option. If Shepard breathes when he's in the rubble, you got the good ending.

*SPOILERS ABOVE*"
,VAplomb,2012-04-14T05:56Z,Damn :/ hoped that would at least be different.... thanks for clarification azisco. 
,TheMasterMKD,2012-04-18T22:29Z,WORKS PERFECTLY! just copy the it and you're done ;)
,Fantomnz,2012-04-26T07:00Z,"Azisco  many thamks for the up..It works as described... Doing my play through now with my 100% ME2 Import :-)

Will comment on Ending once there & Done Again.

Cheers"
,hexjoyce,2012-05-28T01:31Z,"Hi guys , sorry if i intrude but I must ask you to help me by just clicking my blog page and letting me know , what do you think of the Mass Effect Book i began writing.Please , it will take just 2 minutes and i would appreciate it a lot. All criticism is welcome.

Thank you to the Uploader for ME3 cheat,
and thank you too.
Please don't go nuts on me for leaving a message here , i don't know what else to do."
,yamato74,2012-06-16T22:59Z,"Looks like it's working (didn't finish the game yet). But beware! This thing resets achievements! I almost freaked out when I discovered my paramour achievement was grayed out. I thought it messed up my romance, but further in the game I realized it was just the achievement itself. The romance was not affected."
,nowandever29tpb,2012-06-20T23:26Z,"Works like a charm!  It overwrote my custom key bindings, but that took all of 120 seconds to fix.  Thanks!"
,lightsR,2012-06-24T10:56Z,"Good time to use this, since the EC is coming out soon."
,martin_uliverov,2012-06-28T22:25Z,I have little problem.I put the file and there was 100 Readiness but then I started to acquire war asset and it didt show them on the monitor.Little help please :)
,couteau,2012-06-30T09:48Z,"i had the same problem like Martin, well what i did was just copy that file again, but it will delete all Achievements, it's annoying."
,martin_uliverov,2012-06-30T19:23Z,"For some time my readiness remained 100% but after curing the genophage it fell to 50%.It pisses me off :S :"""
,Gecko99,2012-07-06T17:48Z,I will SEED this indefinitely!! Works perfectly! Respect to the unknown coder!! m/
,Fantomnz,2012-07-07T13:49Z,"Hey everyone said Id comment once I fully thrashed this.
Well on my forth run threw with ME2 import-- just to get all the achievments 5000 Kills is quite a bit..LOL....BUT @azisco & everybody else it has worked excellently, except for one mission I completed it dropped my credits & my readiness...Reloaded that mission from the beginning ran threw again & I had everything 100% Readiness & my bucket load of credits!!!!!
So for those who have had a stange glich (which is all I could put it down to as only has happened the once) restart from an earlier save!
Also confirm If Shepard breaths you have the best ending!!!!

Great work many many thanks!!! No mult play for me Hahahaha!!!!!"
,Rorik01,2012-07-30T04:26Z,"What do you mean "" the file contains in-game settings (everything except saves) including EA user Data of a ""unknown"" gamer? that sounds like ""if you download this, EA will catch you"" type of thing?"
,Rorik01,2012-07-30T04:34Z,Anyone know?
,Rorik01,2012-07-30T05:15Z,Anyone at all?
,Rorik01,2012-07-30T18:11Z,"NVM Doesn't work, my readiness just stayed at 50% "
,Fantomnz,2012-08-02T12:40Z,"@Rorik01

As I like many others are using a downloaded version with DLC unlockers etc It cant be played as multiplayer online anyway so getting caught for this cheat is not possible. I have done several fresh installs & just recently the extended cut etc & the War Readiness has worked fine overal. I did have to redo a mission to get it back to 100% but that was later in the game.

All I can suggest is  reinstall the cheat & make sure all your patches are done etc etc

Hope that helps & works for you :)

,Semblance,2012-08-11T16:02Z,"Does what it is supposed to, but resets all of your achievements as well."
,Fantomnz,2012-08-19T08:02Z,"As Im now doing a Fem with the Firefight DLC (Also Extended Cut & all DLC content) I had my level drop to 50% which I thought Oh Faaark now Iv got to do that mission again!!!!

Hold the phone.....thought Oh well Ill keep going & see if it changes after Iv done something else (Visit the Citadel etc) which afterwards it was back to 100% & I had lost nothing, Just had to keep playing.

,wallitch,2012-09-01T02:24Z,Works perfect :) Can't thank you how much this helped me :)
,Fantomnz,2012-09-18T11:55Z,"@azisco and All others that created and provided this Gem!!! Thanks again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

Done the Leviathan run through now also a False positve with the Level dropping back to 50%...... But as Iv stated before ignore it & keep playing as it will come back to 100%
