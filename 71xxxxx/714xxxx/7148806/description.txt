First of all, credit to this forum where I found the cheat: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1123521-ME3-Cheat-f%C3%BCr-100-Readiness?s=d9493e2ae0361014484f63a25565d47b

I saw a lot of people looking for trainers or cheats to increase war assets/readiness level for people who don't want to play MP or simply can't, and after searching I found this obscure cheat on a foreign forum that works perfectly.

There is a save editor floating around out there that will increase your war assets, but I feel like that crosses the line to blatant cheating. With this simple replacement file the game will think that you played the MP to get max readiness, so you can get your war assets the legit way and play the game the way it's meant to be played. This works for pirated copies and will also work for legit copies as long as you do not connect to the internet (setting your firewall to block the game's requests will take care of that.

The Instructions folder has an easy to follow guide to help you on your way to the best ending. Credit goes to the forum once again for this wonderful workaround.
