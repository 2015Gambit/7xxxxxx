The Nitro Circus crew toured Australia & New Zealand back in 2010, this is how they got on.

Higher resolution than the tv rips and no MTV logos, all 8 episodes plus 4 extra clips, ripped from the original Austrailian DVD release, encoded to XviD AVI 720x404 resolution, 23.976fps, normalised audio.

Enjoy!
