This is a remastered version of the standard UBUNTU LTS 10.04.2 i386 disk with data acquisition software installed such as "comedirecord" and "xoscope". Both binaries and source code are installed. All programs are in the examples folder. Also, octave and all C/python development libraries are installed so that programs can be compiled and modified.
This iso image also installs nicely on a USB thumb drive and can then be used as an independent DAQ system. It's been tested with the USBDUX boards:
