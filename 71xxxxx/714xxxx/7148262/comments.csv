,Baaplo,2012-04-05T19:47Z,@extremezone do you have any idea when good dvdrip or BRRip will for Underworld:Awakening? thx
,Ludio,2012-04-14T23:18Z,"@movieman44 before you look into it more here are the following cases in which you uploading will be worth it:
1) your movie is not already uploaded
2) your movie is already uploaded but you have a better quality
3) your movie is already uploaded but you have it compressed more (saving some bandwidth)

if so understand the laws in your country, look up creating a torrent, and then uploading it"
