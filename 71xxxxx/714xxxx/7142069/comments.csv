,anyone2,2012-04-30T16:43Z,I am getting an alert for win 32/ Heur Virus as soon as I started downloaded the file. Anyone else facing this issue?
,harleyria,2012-05-31T11:06Z,"Cannot open file after downloading, just get a request asking what program do I want to use to open it... none of which work, of course... I have limited GB per month and can't afford to waste this amount of download on a faulty file... any help?"
,Du2L5r1,2012-07-18T19:45Z,"Nice one brother! I havent got the whole torrent yet, but i dont doubt its gonna be another sweet UL...
@adyv8, this is a torrent site, u'll have more luck on a walkthru/cheats site...
@harleyria, the files are good, u just obviously dont have the software to read em..try power iso/daemon tools, i assume its a *.ISO file yr trying to open.
And finally, virus boy ""anyone2""...2 words false positive (see in description above). when someone cracks/patches a program, theyre basically diverting the flow of data, or even commanding the flow of data away from problematic areas within the software like ""serial registration"" prompts, ""online activation"" etc. Trojans for example,r handy lil data bundles that carry many commands within them, that divert and disrupt the flow of data within the host program...hence the name, Trojan. So its very likely that the *virus* (scared face and dramatic music) that u talk about, is the very thing that is enabling yr cheap ass to play this game for free. lol, the word ""virus"" is a lot scarier than say ""bridge"", ""bypass"", or ""key"" for example, yet they describe the same thing...ok, my rants done, peace..oh and go easy on those viruses eh...theyre not all bad lol"
