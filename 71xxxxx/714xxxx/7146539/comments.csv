Where are the technical data for each movies? I mean source? runtime? resolution? aspect ratio? fps? video codec? container? video bitrate? audio codec? audio channel? audio bitrate? sampling rate? languages?

for example:

A Nightmare on Elm street 2 1985 Freddys Revenge:

Storyline: A teenage boy is haunted in his dreams by Freddy Krueger who is out to possess him to continue his murdering in the real world.
