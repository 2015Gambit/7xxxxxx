Watch ""Weight of Chains"" for truth about balcan wars they hate it when people know what and how it really happened. 
In war there is no victor."

There was a lot of innocent people who died. The crime was done on both sides. Politics is the one who decides who is right, but there were many crimes on both sides"
,mic603,2012-06-07T16:12Z,"I have a problem with the audio. I have 2 speakers and i can only hear talking on just one. On the other one there is no talk, only sound. I have this problem only with this movie. It's like the audio isn't converted right. Video is good, but i hate that there is yellow ""glued on"" subtitles. It wood have been better if the subtitles were separated. That's all, thanks for the video anyway."
