Great and realistic piano sound ! Thanks Anonymous for great upload! :)"
,ElekHours,2012-06-01T00:10Z,"I've got a problem. When I follow the instructions for installation PDF file included in the torrent, Piano in Blue still doesn't work for me. Kontakt gives me the message ""The patch could not be loaded (Unknown error)"" even after I do exactly as the instructions say. Am I missing something? I'm using Kontakt ver. 4.2.4."
