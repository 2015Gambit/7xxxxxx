We were provided a unique opportunity to preserve an important piece of musical history in its final days.  Word had come to us that the historic Clinton Recording Studios in midtown Manhattan was forever closing its doors, destined to be transformed into a modern condominium complex.

One of the many treasures contained therein was this particular Steinway Model D Concert Grand which used to live in the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios.  The CBS 30th Street Studio, ΓÇ£The ChurchΓÇ¥ was perhaps the most influential recording studio of the 50ΓÇÖs and 60ΓÇÖs producing dozens of legendary albums in various genres.
