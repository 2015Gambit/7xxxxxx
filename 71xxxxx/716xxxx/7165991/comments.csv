,PeachYo,2012-04-07T07:28Z,"matt, download WINRAR and extract the first file to desktop, when you do that winrar will extract all of them into 1 video format. Then you can play it."
,PeachYo,2012-04-07T07:29Z,"extract ""aaf-tuf.s15e05.720p"" with winrar"
,PeachYo,2012-04-07T07:36Z,"download winrar and extract it, dumbasses"

,popeye013,2012-04-07T12:55Z,"Just love how because someone asks for advice, they get abuse instead of help. some people need to get lives and grow up, because in real life, you wouldn't dare say that to the face of someone else, so don't do it on the net, its spineless and childish! 

mattm2047, if you find WINRAR to complicated, then download Free RAR Extract Frog, all you have to do it drag the file onto the picture and it does it for you, its a piece of piss mate"
,cinderelly,2012-04-07T18:21Z,popeye013 is right man why u gotta make someone feel like shit for asking for help grow up
,greenwheel,2012-04-07T18:39Z,releasing rar files in a torrent is gay as fuch anyway... we're not downloading via ftp here... we don't need rars... sceneline is a fag for not unraring it first.
,greenwheel,2012-04-07T18:48Z,"scene4all has one already extracted here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7166145/The.Ultimate.Fighter.S15E05.720p.HDTV.x264-aAF

get this one instead."
,LeonesUK,2012-04-08T02:13Z,"@PeachYo - Remember when you first downloaded a rar file....

Exactly, don't act so smart :P"
