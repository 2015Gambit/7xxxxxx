This doesnt use a loader or nothing as well. The only draw back to this, help files aren't there so i could keep it to a single file. Help seed, im sure some of you on dial up could seed for 20 mins or so lol"

[T],n2kmaster,2012-04-06T00:11Z,"Thats honestly why i use it, i had a hell of a time finding something that would record at a descent resolution for my device. Just something about my device that most software doesn't like. I've had some success with with others but the end result looked like crap and frame skipped like nuts and audio syncing was a serious issue. And this was on a dual core pc with a descent amount of ram, took me a while before i found the version i needed to be able to crack. I use it cuz it works great and that timed trial pissed me off badly enough to wanna break it lol."

,jazbrujah,2012-05-02T01:23Z,This is a beautiful thing. Thank you very much. Seeding!
,electroH,2012-05-12T09:25Z,I can't believe that good software can be so small
,SmokeTheChron,2012-07-17T17:14Z,"Love you for cracking this software my friend (love as a brother/family member :P) thanks for helping the rest of us out, and likewise that stupid fucking time-trial message was pissing me off as well. Big ups for the share and I'll seed this from here on out. This is the only decent software out there really"
