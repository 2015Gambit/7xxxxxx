The remastered mix of ""Incantations Part Four"" included, in the first pressing of the disc, a glitch consisting in the accidental omission of a percussive hit, causing a rhythmical irregularity. According to Universal Music, it was due to an improperly remastered edit point in the original 1977 master tapes. This glitch occurred between 12:36 and 12:38 in the first pressing; in the second pressing, a smaller and less noticeable glitch occurs at 12:40, where both percussive hits are present, but the rhythm still shows a slight irregularity."
