Please refer to STEP 6 of the "Oblivion Optimization (Testing) and Beautification (WIP)" guide at http://www.loverslab.com/showthread.php?tid=2351 for more information.

This torrent contains uncompressed and pyffi-optimized vanilla meshes for Oblivion.  If you use these in place of what gets installed with Oblivion by default, it will help to improve performance.  

Oblivion - Meshes.bsa was pyffi'd by somebody over on http://bbs.3dmgame.com/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=197&page=1 (Chinese website, I can't read their moon-runes, good luck).  The rest were pyffi'd by snarfies of loverslab.com using pyffi 2.1.11.

I am providing this simply because running pyffi can take a LONG time - we're talking a few hours on an Intel Q9450 (that's what I have).  Their distribution is almost certainly a copyright violation.  But I'm pretty sure Bethesda has already made a mint off of Oblivion since 2006 and is now focused on Skyrim, so I don't feel too badly about it at this point.
