I don't want to think of the possibility that the dropped light tower could have landed onto the wreck.

Other than that, thanks for uploading of these documentaries! I was waiting quite some time for them :D"

Matter of fact, he took it easy on the crew. They were a bunch of EXTREMELY over-funded IDIOTS!
What the HELL were they doing with that multi-million dollar sub that, for 1, had a depth range of about 25% the depth of the Titanic. And 2, ""mysteriously"" malfunctioned and SANK to the bottom on it's last mission. Which was ""luckily"", in shallower waters.
To look @ lights...? REALLY!?
AND THEN, u go and fuckin LOSE a big-ass piece of the hull. Come the fuck on people!

IDK if I can bring myself to watch the rest of this series."
