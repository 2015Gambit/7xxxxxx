Narratives:

Fronted by the prolific songwriting partnership of Gustaf Noren and Bjorn Dixgard, Sweden's Mando Diao ooze self belief. It's little surprise that this band have exploded in so many countries around the globe. In Japan, debut album Bring 'Em In went gold, and in the US the media went weak at the knees, while across Europe and of course Scandinavia, which has hardly been shy in offering fine music over the last few years, they play to sold out houses full of far from retiring fans. With "Hurricane Bar", they arrive fully formed, unstoppable, urgent and more ambitious than ever. For this album they hired Richard Rainey, best known for his work with U2. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
