,msc123,2012-04-05T17:20Z,"is this version contains auto activator in ISO or separate?? i have samsung laptop, it will not accept activator..."
,krushed18,2012-04-05T20:34Z,"@Rock_Flint because am a newbie in torrent uploads and i also i forgot the activator previously & the other one has too much peers..
avtually i was a bit tensed about seeds & peers..because my torrent had peers were too much & seeds were very less. then i got to know that the peers are those people who are still downloading. after download completes they'll convert into seeds..."
,krushed18,2012-04-05T20:40Z,"@msc123 yes it has an activator but it's in the zip with the OS not serperate sorry for that. but if u want it seperate, i've uploaded the same activator on rapidshare here's the link for it:-
rapidsharedotcom/files/2653192704/Windows_7_Activator.zip (put the . symbol at dot keyword)

 for it sets everything perfect according to the pc or laptop for example u have samsung laptop so choose samsung brand, etc and abt the other accept thing i don't think samsung has to do anything with the activator..actually the OS matters."
,helpful_comments,2012-04-05T23:53Z,"32-bit or 64-bit ?
And is the activator in the .zip along with the OS file or is it actually an integrated part of the OS because your reply didnt quite answer msc123's question clearly. 
Basically, what are the specific files within the zip folder."
,krushed18,2012-04-06T08:28Z,"@helpful_comments 32bit , and yes there's just one zip file in the torrent in which(in zip file) there's a .nrg file which consist of windows 7 ultimate pack. and there's one folder in which there's an activator for windows 7 and one text file of demonoid, why don't you check that by clicking on files at top left."
,helpful_comments,2012-04-06T16:17Z,"Because when files are included in a compressed format the files on a torrent page only show the compressed folder and not the contents inside. 
I only asked because your answer to msc123 was unclear. 
Just trying to help people get better info on your torrent because you didn't provide much info at all in the first place. 

So the zip file contains Windows7 .nrg file aswell as an activator which you simply run seperately after you're done with the install. 

Im assuming its the Activator by Daz? Very good activator and gives the user full genuine windows for updates as well as Windows Security Essentials download.

With that being said, good luck with the install guys."
,krushed18,2012-04-06T21:52Z,@helpful_comments well i've tried twice to provide the info on files..i don't why u didn't understand.. i've said it's not a integrated part it's just in a separate folder. and yes the activator is by daz..
,helpful_comments,2012-04-08T04:23Z,"""yes it has an activator but it's in the zip with the OS not serperate sorry for that""

How is that clear ? 
And thats all you said and then I asked you to explain it more clearly. 
You said it was integrated? Where? Haha. Cause I definitely asked if it was or not cause you clearly misunderstood someone else's question and gave them a completely different answer saying it wasnt seperate and where they could find a seperate activator.

My last comment was just confirming what you said after I asked the question for people considering downloading your torrent Because before I asked, you stated completely different information. 
I'll remember to not try and help you out with giving people info next time cause it seems you're trying to make me seem like an idiot for asking. haha. 

Great job dude. hahah. "
,krushed18,2012-04-08T17:38Z,"@helpful_comments i can't say anything to u about help me out or not it's ur own desicion on that, and as far as showing u as an idiot it wasn't my intention..."
,gunner1711,2012-04-14T13:24Z,"Thanks Mr krushed18 wanted a untouched version :-) saw yours and thought why not :-). Have a slight download problem and that is we are all stuck at 96.3% :-(. I no this is not your fault but hopefully when people read this it mite help :-).
Has peope may see there are more leaches than seeds.
Seeds are people who have already downloaded the complete file and remain connected so that others can download from them.
Leeches are people who are still downloading the file. With bit torrents, you can also download from a leecher, but only the parts of the file they have already downloaded themselves. This is what makes bit torrent so fast. Leechers can also mean people who disconnect as soon as they have downloaded the file. :-( 
If you have downloaded a torrent leave it open for a day or two so that you are helping others :-). I will leave this open and I will seed as long as possibe and if other can do the same I think every one can enjoy a much quicker download."
,krushed18,2012-04-14T20:18Z,"@gunner1711 well thanks i really appreciate that, and i think i've got much seeders now..so i think u people will get much better download speed..

Enjoy!! i'll try to upload much more torrents as soon as my exams are over. Thanks For Downloading."

,sparky1kob,2012-04-18T08:14Z,"Sorry , Ive d l the torrent and there is a nrg file and a zipped file what do i do now please, do i have to open nrg or just burn the whole thing to a dvd image? any help would be great. thanks in advance."
,krushed18,2012-04-18T12:57Z,"@sparky1kob u don't need to worry about anything, tell me do u have winrar installed. if yes then u can extract nrg file with it. and if u want to install the windows 7 via boot process then u'll hav to burn it on a dvd or u can also boot it with pendrive also, search it on youtube. u'll find ample of videos on it. else u just double click the setup file and after installation is complete go to the directory where ur previous os was installed, there u'll find windows.old folder just delete that and ur done.."

,ayoman93,2012-04-20T07:51Z,You really need to make a better description. I'm a mac user looking for a clean .iso file. Bootcamp wont recognize an .nrg file. 
,krushed18,2012-04-20T10:27Z,@ayoman93 then u can do it without booting also..
,CTW94,2012-04-21T20:20Z,"ayoman93, 
     install the XCodes package by registering for a developers account, (http://developer.apple.com/mac/) then download MacPorts, (http://www.macports.org/install.php) select the version for your Mac OS, 
then open a terminal and type 'sudo port selfupdate -v'
then install nrg2iso by typing 'sudo port install nrg2iso'
Then type nrg2iso   and hit enter.

It should convert it to an iso, the only problem is the activator is in .exe format..."

,MonnOmsap,2012-04-25T21:51Z,"Anyone been able to run the windows updates without problems on this ?? 

I installed windows 7 about 2 weeks ago from another source and I now have the ""windows is not genuine"" problems. It appeared when I installed windows update KB971033 (didn't know at that time not to install it...). Tried everything to fix it but just can't, so just wondering if someone was able to install the windows updates on this without that ""windows is not genuine"" problem ?"
,wvrmaster,2012-04-26T06:48Z,"I'm downloading this torrent. Excellent speed!

This Windows 7 comes with language in Portuguese (BR)? Thank you."
,bmccoy11,2012-04-26T20:45Z,Great! I didn't even have to use the activator (so far)! Thanks! The OS Is working great!

,watamouri,2012-04-30T02:48Z,"hello there guys, after downloading how do I burn it? I downloaded one and made an iso image of it then burned it using nero burner but it doesn't work!    "
,krushed18,2012-05-01T06:31Z,"@watamouri u don't need to create an iso for burning u could've just extracted the .nrg file in a DVD..and do not create folder in DVD just the files nd folders of windows 7 and exclude the activator.. and tell me what's the result.. or try to get some help on booting and all from youtube, u'll get plenty videos there. good luck =) seed please."
,blackhatmatt,2012-05-02T01:53Z,it works! great download. thank you very much krushed18. it's really untouched. she's still a virgin. 
,bmccoy11,2012-05-04T01:17Z,"Still Working Great! It's been installed for over a week now, with no OS Problems! I had to activate it after I checked to see if it thought it was genuine, it said it wasn't, so I used the activator by DAZ (not the one included in this pack) and re-did the WGA check, and HAZA! ""Your Copy Of Windows 7 Is Genuine!"" No genuine BS since!"
,smp2012,2012-05-04T05:19Z,"i have downloaded it and extracted it as well now should i run the setup directly or do i have to do something and if installed what about the old XP that is installed how do i get rid of it without any hassle , all answers welcome thank you ..."
,Andlav,2012-05-04T17:19Z,I'm sorry for the newbie question (if in case) but i would like to know if this one contains or already have - include service pack 1..??
,Adri2Cute,2012-05-05T02:41Z,"I have downloaded the torrent, extracted the file and double clicked the setup.exe file. It seems ready to install but should I do an upgrade or custom install? I really need to keep all my programs and files because I don't have anything to back them up with. Help anybody?!?"

,krushed18,2012-05-05T13:29Z,@bmccoy11 why is there any problem with the activator included in the torrent..
,krushed18,2012-05-05T13:32Z,"@smp2012 all u need to do is double click the setup and when the installation is completed. u'll see a folder named ""windows.old"" usually in ""C"" drive or the drive where u installed it, just delete that and that's it the windows xp is wiped off.."
,krushed18,2012-05-05T14:03Z,"@Andlav it's ok, and BTW there's no versions like service pack 1 and all, windows 7 OS is of 2 types one is ""Home basic"" and the other one is ""Ultimate"". and this torrent has the ""Windows 7 Ultimate"" version which is the best as in ""windows xp"" service pack 3 is. please seed..."

,chicali1969,2012-06-14T19:36Z,"I downloaded the software last night and was getting ready to install this morning I unzipped it. First I ran a complete system scan with avast and everything was ok, but it recommended a boot time scan also so I ran it and it said the activator file contained Win32:pup-gen which is a nasty little trojan that will corrupt and destroy your computer, so I removed it, now that file is gone completely! What should I do now? I really want the win 7 ultimate can anybody confirm this? "
,chicali1969,2012-06-14T19:48Z,"Ok the unzipped activator file is now deleted I ran another boot time scan with avast and it is detecting the Win32:pup-gen in the unzipped file here is what it says "">windows 7 activator.exe >autoplaydocsRemoveWat.exe is infected by win32:gen [pup]"" I see nothing but good commentary on here so what is going on? Let me know krushed18 or anybody else outhere feedback will be appreciated."
,chicali1969,2012-06-14T20:46Z,"Ok the win32:gen pup trojan is in the unzipped files, in the activator files it seems. I hate vista I want this to work, can I swap out the activator, or can I install and remove trojan later with avast. Does the activator come on when you install win 7automatically or is there a seperate process? help!"
