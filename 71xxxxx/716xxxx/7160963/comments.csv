,DarkerSkies,2012-04-06T01:01Z,Can someone confirm if this has the hard coded English subs for the Russian speech sections.  Previous download needed the English subs to be on constant  to get the Russian speech sections which was pain in the ass !      
,DarkerSkies,2012-04-07T02:41Z,OK i`ll answer my own question YES it does have the required English hard coded subs for the Russian speech sections.  It`s a retail copy with an edited retail menu i.e  the extras have been removed. Best DVDR copy available if you want the hard coded english subs
