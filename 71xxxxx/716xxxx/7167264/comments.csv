,.Leto.,2012-04-08T14:54Z,"@ Keisersozze: because the audio track is @ 1510 kbps there's already about 1Gb just for that. Not really useful since you won't hear the difference. Video bitrate is quite high too, 4679 Kbps. That's why this rip is 4,37Gb. Wait a bit, 2-3Gb versions will come soon."

,Shunrei,2012-06-09T07:29Z,"Oh God, sorry but i hear the difference, those crackling sound when his sister was singing, and so on, i think i am using a decent enough headphone till i can hear them.. I've been wondering why no one uses FLAC instead of DTS or AAC, AC3, Mp3, FLAC serves better, but well don't need FLAC for  a drama film i think. 

anyway good video and yeah just like what @.Leto. said, you won't hear the difference anyway so don't mind me. Overall this one's pretty nice. Thanks for the uploader."
