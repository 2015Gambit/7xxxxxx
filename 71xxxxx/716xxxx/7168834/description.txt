I did this as theres not decent video clips of this group about not in a complete
collection.. it runs for 33 minutes. Cant wait to see more convert music
videos.. as you need to watch them play rather then listen I think.
the girls make it not the music :)

This is my favourite 4 girls that make Classic String Instruments very sexy
indeed. its more Classic Pop though

I ripped these from various web streams and sources and also added som
of Season 2 Got talent clips of them playing

The quality ranges but all are pretty much High Quality

converted to 1000bitps xvid 640x352 mp3 128bit

HELP TO SEED if your a fan :)

enjoy

==I recommend VLC 2.0.1 alpha Mar 2012 to watch
xvids and to set real-time sharpener on and slide
the knob a little to the right (not too much) it
really makes a big difference to the video output
try it and see what I mean .. get it from videolan.org
it rid the noise and washed out feel and
brighten key white areas on the fly. also enable GPU
acceleration can really help playback speeds
try this before complaining about corrupted video
and bad video. also the 2.1 beta plays xvids
worse in fact but maybe plays mp4s better
however Im still wondering if ver 1.11.1 plays
better as it seems more smooth. MPC with K-lite is
good to but lacks the sharpener filter VLC has
===================================
Ps/3 , phone and xbox users may consider grabbing
the free tool umile encoder 3.1.1.2 it can convert
to most devices to make compatible in 8mins
on dual core or higher. as some of my converts may
fail for certain devices.. you will need a pc to run it
though. no link just google it..
