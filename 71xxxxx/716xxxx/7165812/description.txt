 Every ten days, a test page allows you to chart your progress, while throughout the book Dr Tom Stafford's incisive and thought-provoking text explores the wonders of our brain and how we can get better at using it to its full potential. Offering much more than other brain-testing books "The Rough Guide Book of Brain Training" answers mind-boggling questions such as 'does classical music make you more intelligent?' and 'can we slow down or stop the ageing of our brain?'. This guide is guaranteed to give your brain a thorough work-out.
