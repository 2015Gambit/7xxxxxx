,Mamba4ever,2012-04-12T19:55Z,"I have an iPad 3, is there a real noticeable difference between the 720p and 1080p versions on the small screen guys? Many thanks "
,link5a,2012-04-12T19:57Z,"hmmm the Pixar collection sounds like a very good idea but I'm quite sure that such a project would take some time to be done, specially when you take encoding very seriously in order to deliver top quality. So, patience, and we might be very lucky ;)
Thanks for everything so far T108 :)"
[T],tr108,2012-04-13T17:34Z,"@geup15

I can* totally* appreciate the excitement -- after all, it's Pixar!!! -- but, unfortunately, torrents are at the bottom of the priority list among all things going on in my (messy) life. That said, the Toy Story films should be up in 48 hours or so. In 1080p :)

@link5a - thanks for havin' my back, brother."
,link5a,2012-04-14T01:22Z,@tr108 any time bro' cheers on Toy Story!
,giannis96,2012-04-14T09:39Z,thanks man!!!can you upload hangover 1&2.thanks again
,billymatt,2012-04-26T05:16Z,"Hey tr108, these movie files are amazing quality but how come some of these movies have the chapter markers and some don't? I'm sorry if I'm a little particular but is it possible to re-upload these movies with the scene selections? If not, that's cool but I'm just curious.

Thanks for the great movies and let us know!"
[T],tr108,2012-04-26T15:36Z,"@billymatt - depends on my source. If I'm ripping the blu-ray myself, I include chapter information. If I'm using an uploaded file, it depends on whether or not *that* ripper chose to include chapter data. (No chapter info in this source file).

There will be no re-ups because a film is lacking chapter data but you can (rather painlessly) add chapter information yourself via Subler on a Mac or YAMB on a PC. 

Find or create the chapter info as a TXT file. I think http://chapterdb.org/ is a pretty good resource. (They didn't have the chapter info when I uploaded this film, tho they do now).

Then, if you're on a PC with YAMB, you'll need to mux (which means rewrap audio, video, subtitle & chapter information into a new MP4 file; should take only minutes) a la: http://yamb.unite-video.com/muxing.html.

If you're like me and on a Mac, it's even simpler as you can use Subler to import chapter markers into the M4V file you've downloaded via this torrent. No mux necessary, just hit Save and it'll create the chapter preview images for you."
[T],tr108,2012-04-26T16:37Z,"Whoops, brain freeze! I was asked this question earlier about We Brought a Zoo and was confusing the two source files. This encode for M:I-GP has chapter tracks, of course. :)"
