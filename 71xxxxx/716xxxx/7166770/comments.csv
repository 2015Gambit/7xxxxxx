,psoc,2012-05-23T21:18Z,what do you mean dont let the game go online>?
,billias1020,2012-06-28T17:54Z,does all the dlc items still appear after patching the game to 1.04?
,dmmm123,2012-06-29T18:10Z,"An addition to the previous comment, are the Exclusive and Promotional bonus items included in this torrent?"
,billias1020,2012-06-30T10:44Z,the pre order dlc and some more are not included..it seems there will not be not an update for the new patch dlc
,ryzy,2012-07-03T11:01Z,"This game is already 1,04"
,JaceB,2012-07-15T01:15Z,"When I try to run install.bat I get the message ""The system cannot find the file specified."" and then it stays at 0.0% for as long as I keep it open. and I've kept it open for hours."
,ryzy,2012-07-20T18:54Z,Ensure you have 9 files in directory
,goldendrag0n,2012-09-02T07:31Z,"Perhaps I'm an idiot or call me crazy, but wouldn't it make SENSE to keep the installation files in case one wishes to REINSTALL at a later date? I mean unless the installer was just a decompression file, and all you'd have to do is copy all the decompressed files to your DA 2 install directory... I  missed the part about installation files being deleted after install when I was looking for a comprehensive DLC pack for DA 2, had I seen that I knew this would be a one time shot download, I would have looked elsewhere."
,Dugatto,2012-09-16T02:31Z,"I've followed all the steps and manage to install it.

But the game crashes on startup.

There must be a CRACK or something missing. Please help!!"
,Dugatto,2012-09-16T02:41Z,"Will the game work if I download a 1.04 crack?
that's the version, isnt it?"
