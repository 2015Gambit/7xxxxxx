[V],HobbitGamez,2012-04-08T02:03Z,"It is important to note that this game requires a dual-layer DVD-R to burn and play properly.

Here is a prime example of what discs you would want to use (Sony discs also will almost always work):

Do not use DVD+R! Even in the rare case that it does work it is bad for your Wii's laser."

,thebigretard,2012-09-21T19:29Z,"Wii 4.3u, softmodded, USB Loader Gx- All updated. This ""HobbitGamez"" it a poor uploader. Downloaded this and his torrent ""Kirby's dream collection"". The kirby one actually launches and then crashes when selecting a game to play. This one doesn't do anything. It won't load on my hard drive, therefor I can't even see if it plays. No load = no play. Deleting this one too. HobbitGamez stop putting up fake bullshit that doesn't work."
[H],shirepirate,2012-09-22T00:33Z,"@thebigretard

as i have said to others, your failure to get my games to function does not mean they will not. if you give up so easily though it's not my loss. you can't expect every game you load from a usb loader to play with the exact same load settings, it simply doesn't work that way. did you even try different load settings? -.-

it's probably an easy-to-fix issue, but seeing as you just wasted GBs of downloads I doubt you are looking for a real solution at this point. good luck nonetheless"
