sound = ok

during audio strangee cuts of irritating ""queen"" tracks during the whole movie, louder than the movie itself, you can't even hear the conversations proparly.really really annoying.
as if someone is listing to the radio during the movie and not knowing recording it

very very very badd, it made me curse during the movie,

thumbs down for that one

,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T00:31Z,"Hi, i was going to explain to ya all why the movie is shorter than the retail one. But, it seems that the movie is acually shorter. Anyway, when you watch the real movie it's shown in 24 FPS (23.976 FPS) but when you watch it in the cinema it's played in 25 FPS. So i made a calculation out of it as you can see below.

Real Playtime: 6780 sec (24 FPS)
TS Playtime: 5416 sec (25 FPS)
CAM Playtime: 5101 sec (25 FPS)

Multiplier: 0.96 (1/25 = 0.04 | 1 - 0.04 =0.96)

Calculation: 6780*0.96 = 6508,8 sec

25 FPS Playtime: 6508,8 sec - Credits = (5416 sec || 5101 sec) ???

I belive that this is a correct calculation that removes 1 second every 25th second. However this means that the movie credits must be either 18 mins or 23 mins. In this case 23 mins cus this is the CAM version. And i don't believe that the credits is 23 mins. So why is the movie shorter than it's supposed to be?"
