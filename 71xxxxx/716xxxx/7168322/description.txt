Narratives:

Ahmed's brand new album With Endless Fire was entirely written, performed and recorded direct to analog tape by Ilyas Ahmed in Portland, OR. It is Ahmed's first album since his 2009 release Goner (Root Strata) and continues the much fuller sound presented there, giving us his unmistakable voice with a mix of acoustic and electric guitars, harmonium, organ, and drums.

Ilyas Ahmed on With Endless Fire : 
"This record started out during an extended period of decline and gradually shifted focus to let more light in, to reconcile the murky depths and the ecstatic highs of everyday life. I wanted to make music that was "of" rather than "by". It was the first time I felt there was no separation between head & hands, instruments & speakers, microphones & air, fuzz pedals & tape machines. The songs are inspired equally by memory, loss, love, and electricity."
