Files are CD+G but the program I use (Microstudio) changes them to a .bin file.  So if they do not work with your karaoke program change them bakc to a .cdg

I have a lot of older Sound Choice disks I can upload but if all I get are leechers I will not create any more so please seed!

REMEMBER, if you want more disks SEED!!!!!
