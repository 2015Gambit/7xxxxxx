http://tracker.prq.to:80/announce.php
copy this link, and go to the properties page of the torrent in your torrent program, add the tracker manually under the trackers list.
I will post more working trackers as I find them. As soon as one person downloads it off there I can seed it to you at 2MBps through 'Peer Exchange'. Cheers!"
