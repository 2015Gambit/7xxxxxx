RELEASE NOTES

Men of War: Condemned Heroes is the newest installment in the
best-selling Men of War series which fuses tactical thinking with the
action-packed direct control mode.

Men of War: Condemned Heroes tells the story of one of the infamous
Soviet penal battalions during the WWII. These battalions are famous
for being formed under Stalin's "No step back" order #227. They
consisted of court-martialed officers that were given a chance to
redeem their crimes, or incompetence, in blood by serving as the lowest
enlisted rank in a battalion that was assigned the most dangerous
tasks. These battalions images are surrounded by many myths, and this
game tells the truth about these regiments based on real evidence from
their former members.

Take command of one of these notorious companies and lead it to victory
against all odds through most of the war on the Eastern front. Fight
from desperate battles in 1942 in the area of Volyn in the Ukraine, to
the massive operation Bagration in the Brest area, Magnush bridgehead
and Warsaw area in Poland and finally to attacks on the German Altdam
and Stettin near the end of the war.

missions telling the story of the penal company from crucial 1942 to
