,Sivos,2012-04-08T02:10Z,"LaNPaRtY1987 is the first idiot of the comments.  Learn what a trojan is, noob."
,yyywww111,2012-04-08T02:12Z,"Thank you HeroMaster, it'll be good to see how good the game is before I pre-order it for retail release :P"
,BakaBaka11,2012-04-08T02:51Z,"Works fine, win7x32"

p.p.s. If you like it, but it!"
,zimsmoke,2012-04-08T03:30Z,"Trusted uploader.
Release info matches the package info from (site).

And theres far far far easier ways to infect someone than transfering 1.7gig to them.


skidrow.dll is not a trojan.
And you are too clueless to be pirating games.  Or be on the internet at all really.  "
,Timbo6669,2012-04-08T05:44Z,"Thanks heromaster  - and trojan my ass, for all you NOOBS, google -""why do cracks show up as virus',"" and, ""what are false positives"" then you have the right to comment.. maybe..."
,LaNPaRtY1987,2012-04-08T08:43Z,hey sivos suck my cock u are noob!!

,yyywww111,2012-04-08T16:12Z,"Hey guys, I'm getting the standard crash once past dev video thing (""can't get back buffer"") and I know it's due to my screen resolution. My comp. is configured at 1680 * 1080, and I also know that in mydocuments/mygames/Menofwarcondemnedheroes is a file called 'settings.set' which allows me to force the game into booting with another resolution.

The problem? Every res I enter gives me an input error because it doesn't recognise how I formatted it (E.g. ""1680x1050"" doesn't work). Can't find any help for this online, and the problem's been around since Assualt Squad at least"
,BakaBaka11,2012-04-08T17:01Z,"yw1, try reinstalling your video driver (removing it completely then installing again, latest drivers btw) because the game works on quite old ati/amd, nvidia and even intel cards."
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-04-09T00:08Z,Shitty graphics..
,SergioFCPorto,2012-04-09T00:30Z,thanks
,SergioFCPorto,2012-04-09T00:33Z,thanks
,zimsmoke,2012-04-09T01:12Z,"Works perfectly.

BUT it needs the crackfix.   Huge battles get pretty slow even on high end machines."
,ycebotz1,2012-04-09T12:15Z,Why it doesn't have co op?
,ag_orange,2012-04-09T20:18Z,Can you upload Captain Morgan and the Golden Turtle? 
,yyywww111,2012-04-09T20:44Z,"Update:

Found the fix for the backend problem. Just go to my documents/my games/Men of war condemned heroes/player and open the 'options' file with notepad. Then replace the '{desktop mode}' line with this and save;

			{mode ""1024x768""}
			{refresh 85}
			{depth ""32""}"
,luk_skv,2012-04-10T07:48Z,"vinnie, it's a folder, just open it :D

game works like a charm on my laptop (samsung rf511) on highest details"
,TotalKr,2012-04-10T14:25Z,"SKID is getting sloppy. New Total War DLC and now this. Download crack from GameCopyWorld instead, perfomance different on my PC is 20 vs 80."
,fcb...6,2012-04-11T05:11Z,seed!!!!!!!!!
,tpb3571,2012-04-12T00:39Z,"you guys calling the virus a false positive are the true idiots.  You're so used to these ""false positives"" from cracks that when you come across one you don't bother to look into more to keep yourself safe.  That's why you retards have your shit fucked!  the skidrow.dll injects another file called obfuscator.xz into your win32 folder.  No game ever needs to do that.  Grab the reloaded crack and bypass this one.  We don't even know if the crack really belongs to skidrow because previous dlls from skiddy never has this issue in their false positive.  "

,imasinner,2012-04-13T20:39Z,Virus in the crack (skidrow.dll) do not download.
,JamesChalpkin,2012-04-13T20:50Z,"ok, can anyone help? when i try to launch the game, its sayes ""the dynamic library ""rld.dll"" failed to load."""
,simsiuss,2012-04-14T14:09Z,"This works perfectly, very happy with the download, had to turn of AVG shield whilst playing or it wouldn't work, and come up with the dll.rll error.

Just wondering, does anyone know where to get a good Trainer for this game?"
,mejinuf,2012-04-14T19:06Z,"I cannot move the mouse pointer at all, even in the menu screen, anyone with the same problem?"
,streetbum149,2012-04-14T19:23Z,"this time ill take yall's word for it and dl the gcw rld crack, if not just for the additional fps rate. BUT i do think that this is just another false positive. if not just for the fact that the uploader has a blue skull and none of you have a skull to begin with."
,streetbum149,2012-04-14T19:24Z,and if gcw or gbw don't have a trainer yet just wait and im sure someone will make a cheat mod. was done for all the last ones.
,simsiuss,2012-04-14T23:38Z,"ok Streetbum, how long did it take last time for a trainer to be released? i see there is one from CheatHappens, but that says you need to be a member and pay for it, which i am not inclined to do "
,luk_skv,2012-04-17T20:17Z,"This cheat works like a charm. 
It needs CheatEngine 6.1 installed.
