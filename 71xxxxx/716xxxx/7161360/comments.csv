What a way to end the season; with a fizzle and dud."
[V],psspss,2012-04-06T00:49Z,"e13 dont think its season end - midseason break perhaps

I find GH and GHI all boring now days.. nothing changes much

still did you see that.. how many apparitions do they see if only they had a POV to video what they looking at.

there is a theory or experiments where they can now beam images in to human brains even though a image is not visible.. this is interesting makes me wonder if some people can see them and others cant cos its produced in the brain not visible light with sight"
[V],psspss,2012-04-06T02:53Z,"rambo mp4 is not failed format just xvid will do for some of our needs

mp4 encodes video so the pixels arent changed however xvid groups pixels down to a single pixel/color

so xvid changes the original source but mp4 doesnt

however faster gear is needed to decode mp4

xvid doesnt and is faster"
[V],psspss,2012-04-07T04:31Z,"seems this encoder throws it playing on ps3
if you want to convert it quicklu google umile encoder 3,x its very fast and can make a compatiable ps3 or phone version"
