When communism crumbled in 1989, it created an opportunity for wildlife. 
The Iron Curtain that divided communist Eastern Europe from the capitalist West had
created a no-man's-land protected by barbed wire and minefields - a last haven for
many rare animals and plants. This film tells the story of the movement, led by 
biologist Dr Kai Frobel, that set out to save the wildlife of this precious strip.

Now as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain, we can also
celebrate the birth of the biggest conservation movement in the world, a ribbon of 
life stretching 13,000 kilometres across Europe, protecting everything from bears and
wolverines in Finland to rare eagles in Bulgaria.
