This takes advantage of the fact that computer hardware tends to fail either very early in its life or after many thousands of hours of use. Typically BurnInTest should be used before a PC is put into service, as the failure of a computer that isnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t being used for a critical application and doesnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t have any critical data is much less damaging, (especially if it is still under warranty).

The application includes the following additional features:
