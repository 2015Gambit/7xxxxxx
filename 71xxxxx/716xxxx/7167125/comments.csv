,47lars,2012-04-09T13:57Z,Stuck at 99.7 %. When done I will be able to tell ;-)
,diomifro,2012-04-09T21:47Z,"@47lars. Everyone get stucked at 97% but u only need the crack. An you can extract it anyway, although from 97% file. If u want the ableton suite go to ableton site and download the trial version. Use the crack from this site an u got it. But be carefull, somehow i have problems with Ableton Live version 8.3. Read my previous post."
,diomifro,2012-04-12T20:07Z,"So dont panic, everything is o.k now. My fault. Fxpansion's Tremor 1.0 was the culprit. Now everything works fine."

,kx288,2012-04-16T00:40Z,"Keep getting a ""Windows doesn't have acces to the device, route or specified file"". Any help?"
,Rondeath,2012-04-16T15:35Z,And where is the .auz authorization file 8.3?
,Nepag,2012-04-24T00:02Z,"I don't manage to patch it, because the patch can't find Ableton Live 8.exe (and neither do I ..)
What can I do please ?

Thanks a lot."
,mcwire,2012-04-25T22:59Z,the crack isn't working for me... i put it in the install folder and followed the instructions but when i start it it is still in trial mode.

,daenof,2012-05-11T02:48Z,Is this 64bit only or something? I get some error when running the Setup.msi and it says something about 64 bit.
,SWSeigler,2012-05-12T02:08Z,"the instructions in the READ ME document should be a tad more specific, but other than that, this works like a charm"
,AJCdef,2012-05-13T09:53Z,"I'll just leave this here:
http://v.virscan.org/Generic.dx!bdv4.html

Spoiler alert: it contains a virus in the patch. Watch out!"
,AJCdef,2012-05-13T10:05Z,"I derped, I would like to know if this is a virus or not."
,ramsesc,2012-05-19T18:11Z,"Thanks for the upload dude, worked like a charm.

,Awevi,2012-05-24T21:44Z,Avira detects the windows patch as containing Dropper.Gen
,rafaeldk,2012-06-18T09:03Z,"for those who had this message ""this authorization file not valid on this computer"", paste the FILE (not the folder) Ableton.Suite8.3-patch.exe on the folder youdirectory/Ableton/Program and then click on ""patch"". After that, there'll be a .auz file and on that same folder. Click on the file and the authorization will be suceeded."
,tostadora_rota,2012-06-22T16:48Z,"Instalation fail. I install Ableton Suite v8.3, then I Uncompress ableton.suite.8.3-osx_win-patches in the correct directory and after this.... I can not continue, the win folder is empty, I can not find any Ableton.Suite8.3-patch.exe. ANY HELP??"
,Zerojohnnyx,2012-06-27T18:59Z,"Sophos, my antivirus, detects ""Troj/Agent-WFN"". Can anyone tell me if they got a virus from this, thanks?"
,Active1s,2012-07-02T21:48Z,After about 3 weeks my ableton says it requires autorization 
,madd_twatter,2012-07-02T22:31Z,"After installing I looked through Program Files and Program Files (x86) and couldn't find an Ableton directory, therefore I was able to patch anything. The one shortcut that appeared in my start menu didn't work either. Wouldn't download twice."
,Active1s,2012-07-03T00:12Z,"madd_twatter The folder is in program data you should find it there. My ableton asks me for authorization again after some weeks, any ideas?"
,gyaradon,2012-07-03T07:17Z,"A suggestion for those who get ""license is invalid"" messages after a while: under Preferences > Licenses and Maintenance, turn Get Software Updates to Off."
,gyaradon,2012-07-03T07:18Z,"Of course, you have to do this before your program has a chance to update. Make sure you're running 8.3, not any newer version."
,0Figment0,2012-07-18T14:42Z,"For those claiming ""OMG Virus"", you guys need to learn that Patches and Cracks will USUALLY report as a virus... It's just the way they work... If you're that paranoid either A: Buy the software or B: *Jack Nicholson voice* ""Roll the dice and take your chances""
As for me.... I'm hitting the ""This authorization not valid for this computer"" wall.. I've tried copying the patch and auz file into the ProgramData folder and running from there. No dice. Windows 7 64 Bit. Everything installed fine and the program runs... Just no authorization. Anyone found a fix for this yet?"
,gyaradon,2012-07-21T18:05Z,"0Figment0, if you're having problems with the authorization, try this:

1. Uninstall and then reinstall.
2. Use the authorization crack.
3. Set the program not to automatically update itself. If your program directory has created a folder with downloaded updates in it, delete that folder for good measure.

I was having the authorization problem, but it was because the program was silently updating itself to the latest version. Check your version number. It should be 8.3, not 8.3-point-anything. The build date should be 2012-03-29, and not one day newer."
,Seeker19,2012-07-29T15:31Z,"Thanks, works like a charm.Just remember to disable the update in preferences.Otherwise it won't work for too long."
,salterp,2012-08-10T09:19Z,"It says: This authorization file is invaid on this computer. 

Any ideas why?"
,dftpnker1534,2012-08-12T01:06Z,"cant run on windows7 HP 64-bit says something about ""side by side configuration""

waste of time."
,68680,2012-08-12T14:40Z,"Gyaradon, you are asking to delete the ""update"" folder in case there is one to prevent for future updates.

Did you have this folder? Where was he located?

I think my Ableton is also silently updating. Please tell me how you blocked the silent updates.

Of course in ""preferences"", I have turned update to off"
,simonXR,2012-08-15T17:07Z,Works like a charm! Follow his instructions and all will be K. Something that he maybe did not mention was that you're supposed to open the .auz file with Ableton!
,tnkbuster,2012-08-25T20:58Z,"Hey there. Thanks so much for torrenting this. I installed without issue, but Max is not cracked and needs to be activated. Would you happen to have a cracked version of Max 4 Live?

I really need this and would greatly appreciate your assistance. 

Thanks again."
,bobbyxgames,2012-08-26T06:23Z,"Hey I've gotten the 30 day trial license installed but when I go to patch it, there are no working patch files. I have a windows vista 64 bit. I think it's because this torrent is only meant for macs. There's an osx and windows folders but nothing is in the windows folder. I clicked on everything in the osx folder and nothing worked. The auz file just said that it wouldn't work on this computer. It would have been nice if this worked on windows. If anyone has gotten it to work, can they tell me how? The instructions are very limited."
