Ciel Phantomhive is awakened by his butler, Sebastian Michaelis. Sebastian informs Ciel that Damian, the head of Funtom Company, which is Ciel's confectionery toy manufacturing company, is coming for a visit. Sebastian orders the household staff, Baldroy, Finnian, and Mey-Rin ΓÇö them being the cook, the gardener, and the maid, respectively ΓÇö to prepare for Damian's arrival. Their attempts result in disaster, as Baldroy overcooks the food, Finnian kills the garden by spraying herbicides on it, and Mey-Rin breaks all of the china. To resolve the situation, Sebastian orders them to rearrange the yard into a Japanese rock garden and has Bardroy make beef tataki. Damian, impressed with the staff's preparations, plays a board game with Ciel in which his character loses his legs and is ultimately incinerated. Following the dinner, Damian calls his associate, commenting that the factory he owns has been sold and he is attempting to fraudulently acquire more money from Ciel. When Damian attempts to return to the lounge, the scenario in the board game occurs. Damian breaks one of his legs, and Sebastian locks him in the oven, to be burned with the dessert; he later limps away from the mansion, as Ciel and Sebastian laughs in amusement.
