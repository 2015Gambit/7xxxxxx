Yeah, don't hold your breath!

Sceneline used too, but for some reason they've stopped uploading 720p versions of epl games.

I miss them too! :("
,fall1en,2012-04-09T10:08Z,"There is a website that sells pirated copies of epl games on disc. Some are HD. You will from time to time get a game that has audio problems, but that's the risk you take. The website is about 6 weeks behind the current round, so you have to be patient waiting for them to catch up with the round you want.

Anyone interested in knowing about the website, email me, & I'll email you the link.
