,Aemo,2012-04-09T19:46Z,"I got this off of XDA a while back. Worked for about a week before dropbox figured out it's pretty easy to check what type of cellphone you're on. Currently only works for HTC's One series phones, and on them it's pre-installed."
,throwaway_342tr,2012-05-18T22:45Z,"to the comment above me, not all One series come with dropbox, I bought my Htc One x from at&t the day it came out and weirdly dropbox wasn't installed. but when i got it from the android store and logged into my account dropbox auto added the extra 25gb to it.
