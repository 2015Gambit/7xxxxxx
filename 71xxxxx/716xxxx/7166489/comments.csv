[T],trialNerror,2012-04-07T11:35Z,"xvid takes me too long to make a release.
an hour minimum and that's from an analog source (hd capture card).
twice as long if encoding a digital source (hd stb to pc via firewire).

With x264 I can be done encoding and uploading as fast as 20 min after the show airs.

ya know you don't HAVE to convert the x264... you just choose to. (; if scene had went with the even newer x265 format yea I'd understand the need to convert since nothing supports that yet.  within a few years you will probably see it floating around.

the xvid phase will gradually fade out as more people realize oh shit that x264 mp4 DOES play on my game console or brand name mobile device.

hell i can't stress enough how great those tv media players are.  50-100 bucks and you can watch anything you download in just about any format on the big screen; avi, flv, mov, wmv, mp4, and even that mkv many people will never like - even tho it is the BEST multimedia container out there.  newegg or tigerdirect are terrible places to shop for one of those media players.  use amazon or even google shopping. there's a few brands/models of tv media players out there to choose from. :D"
[V],psspss,2012-04-07T12:25Z,"great episode they really step it up and experiment

they beat taps hand down

great quality just watched it all.. all converted in good quality and sync.. might be the first time a tne mp4 has HAHA"
[V],psspss,2012-04-07T15:59Z,"im sure TNE loves being hassled back

i wish I could sit on him until he shuts up about
bl00dy mp4s

i had a play with converting to 3gp man small and
brilliant quality even on a phone screen
i guess thats a mp4 variant but seems phones have some hardware decoder for it over standard mp4s mkvs and xvids"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-08T01:47Z,"s'all good Rambo. i get it you were mad cuz i suddenly switched to x264 after a year or so of XviD.  sorry to piss you off but hey I'm just going with the times and any grown man knows nothing lasts forever; change is inevitable. sorry about releasing some crap x264 stuff at first that gave playback/conversion problems but i'm sure all the bugs have been worked out since psspss has been converting them without a problem for at least a couple weeks now.

speaking of that old fart... you're right. i don't give a damn if someone will flip shit to me but i will flip it right back. :D

and i wish i could sit and fart all over psspss until he stepped into the new era of encoding with x264 lol greater quality with smaller file size can't go wrong

3gp, hm? yuck. that is pretty much strictly a mobile container. it will hold the xvid or x264 avc video formats like avi or mp4/mkv files, but for mobile compatibility the video/audio formats have to be encoded with specific limitations/ restrictions/ dimensions/ bitrates/ bla/ bla/ bla for the particular mobile device. not worth it. besides for shows like this if there's any visual evidence you wanna see that shit on at least a 36"" display not a 3.6"" one. :P"
[V],psspss,2012-04-08T02:08Z,"for fook sake your still talking mp4 still

smacks hit in face with a wet fish

my friend converted his 8gb motor bike ride at 200miles/hr camera does HD in mp4

he converted it to liek 90mb 3gp and even on the pc it looks darn near perfect his phone plays it without stalling now not sure what specs it was but it was high bitrate and 480x240 i think

however hes pissed of he can edit the mp4s in movie maker 6 or live versions has to converted to shitty windows mwv format to edit it

they make the soft worse in win7 stupid menu pastels colors and remove functions that everyone loved.. and didnt add in avi and mp4

ms are screwed in the head"
,twijjit,2012-04-08T03:12Z,"Either way I'm glad you guys are able to hammer it out, cuz 90% of my tv episode collection came from both of you (psspss and tNe). I like to stick to the tried-and-true formats, but I know with you guys doing all the heavy lifting, whatever I get isn't going to be garbage. :)"
,elitecrusher,2012-04-10T18:32Z,"THANX A LOT PSSPSS, much appreciated!! Keep em coming. Well be looking for for the 6th episode next. Thanx again!!"
