DESCRIPTION:


Sri Ramcharitmanas is a great Hindu scripture and poetic classic 
written by Goswami Tulsidas (16th Century CE). 

This poem is also known as Tulsi-krita Ramayana, or "The Ramayana of Tulsidas".

Today, Sri Ram Charit Manas is considered one of the greatest works of Hindi literature, 
and with its composition the story of Ramayana was available for the first time 
to the common man to sing and perform, and over time this gave birth to the tradition of 
Ramlila, dramatic enactment of the text.

Sri Ramcharitmanas bestows upon its readers the gifts of Devotion (bhakti), 
Divine Knowledge (Gyan) and Salvation (Mukti).
