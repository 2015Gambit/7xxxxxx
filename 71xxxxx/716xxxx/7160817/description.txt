Are you a bit strange? Extraordinary? Creative? Then this game is for you! Help Emily race on her skateboard through 36 levels. Visit Paris, Moscow, London and New York together! Prove your STRANGE by using (and sometimes surviving) the amazing power-ups (or are they?) 
Ride in Slow Motion, turn the world Upside Down, or beam from one place to another. Perform cool moves as you catch big air, play head banging air guitar, do a Handstand or the famous Ollie Airwalk!
