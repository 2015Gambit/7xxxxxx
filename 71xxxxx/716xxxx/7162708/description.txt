Jack White's Third Man Records Collection Vol 4 (Vinyl Rip) MP3

Credit to the Original Rippers.  I have taken the Origial FLAC Vinyl Rip
Files Converted them to MP3 @320Kbps, Correctly Tagged the files. For this upload 
I've increased the Volume on The Raconteurs as you could barely hear the Tracks from Original Rips but I've been conservative as I didn't want it to sound Processed. 

ENJOY!
