This is the fifth album from czech downtempo project called Gem Reflection. All tracks was written and produced by Martin Brandejs (Brendy), former and only stable member of this project. This album was recorded with significant influence of guitarist Ondrej Benkovic (Benki), who joined project in 2010 and who plays with Brendy at live performances since then and plays on most of the tracks too.
Some tracks was recorded in studio but this album also captures how this project sounds live,  approximately half of the album was recorded at psytrance festivals in 2011 season. On last track "Odpoledne" (Afternoon) you can hear violin played by our friend Binary Paranoic.

Gem Reflection is czech downtempo project founded in 2004 by producer, composer and musician Martin Brandejs /brendy/. His music is influenced by breakbeat, psytrance/psychill, reggae, ethno, triphop and also early electronic music from Amiga era or czech film music composer Karel Svoboda. 
 
In 2010, guitarist Ondrej Benkovic /benki/ appeared with brendy at Cyklista psytrance festival and after another few live performances he joined the project.
