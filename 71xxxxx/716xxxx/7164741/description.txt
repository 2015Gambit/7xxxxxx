For editing Canopus Edius Pro3 and TMPGenc3 is used and for DVD authoring standard Vista Windows DVD-maker.

For the basic static video and soundtrack I used a MiniDV on a tripod  with a Audio Technica Pro24 cardioid mic mounted on.
The two main angles are handheld X-vid cameras( Digilife 720 and Sanyo Xacti C1)
All the other angles are loose original photocamera-clips from  gathered from multiple Youtubers. 

For extra Punch in the sound a 48khz WAV track is dubbed in recorded with a Edirol R-09 with Core Sound Omnis
