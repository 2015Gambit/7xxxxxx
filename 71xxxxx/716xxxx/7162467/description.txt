Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, allows users to conveniently run multiple operating systems on a single computer. Users can switch operating systems as easily as they switch applications instantly, with a mouse click. Because each virtual machine acts like a standalone computer, each VM can has its own sound card, video, hard disk(s), network card(s) and its own processor.

Since each VM runs its own operating system, users can install and run most x86 operating systems. Microsoft fully supports the following operating systems running in a virtual machine on Virtual PC: Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP and OS/2, but users can also install Windows 2000/2003 Server systems, Linux builds and other operating systems. The operating system that runs on the physical computer is called the host operating system and the operating systems that run on virtual machines are called guest operating systems.
