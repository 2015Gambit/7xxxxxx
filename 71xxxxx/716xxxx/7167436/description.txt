This is )was) a free version of the platform.

It connects to many many brokers, including IBΓÇÖs TWS.  It can place brackets and fades, trailing stops, etc. with ease, right from the chart (visual trading).  It shows all of this on the chart, very very nice.  

It was introduced on Feb 1, 2011 and discontinued on March 19, 2012.
