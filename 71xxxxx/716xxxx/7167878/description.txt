"After a year plus of very hard work, Abrasive Peace is
finally available for listening, download and purchase.

As told before, the record features an unbelievable
performance by the immense Dirk Verbeuren. If you're a fan
and follower of Dirk's work (and even if you're not, eheh),
you should definitely check this out!

(...) Abrasive Peace was 100% self-financed, so any support
you can give to COLOSSO would be very much appreciated! Buy
the limited edition digipack, the full download, and share
the page and music with your friends!"
