DESCRIPTION:

Shoot Many Robots follows P. Walter Tugnut on his mission to kill as many robots as possible after a factory begins to ominously produce killer robots. With an RV full of guns and beer, gamers will experience a four-player co-op run-n-gun side-scrolling RPG shooter filled with tons of weapon and item customization. Shoot Many Robots will also feature two game modes: Traversal, where players must progress linearly through a level, and Survival, where players fight against waves of robot hordes, delivering hours of robotic carnage and fun.


FEATURES:

* The Story: The game stars P. Walter Tugnut, a lovable hillbilly who's been 
stock-piling his RV with guns, ammo, and beer awaiting the robot apocalypse. In case you're wondering, the "P" stands for "Pickles" - but don't call him that.

* Guns & Gear: Equipping items (like a tutu) affect Walter's attributes, and some even give him special abilities. Using nuts dropped from dead robots, you can buy bigger guns and better gear - of which there are hundreds to unlock!

* Level Up: Killing robots gives you XP, XP makes you stronger, and the stronger you are, the more robots you can kill. It's all one big cycle of robot murder.

* A 4-player co-op run-n-gun action shooter that throws you into a tidal wave
of degenerate robots with an array of weaponry that would make any mama
proud.
