With many artists giving away their music on here now days I decided I agreed with their decision.

I present to you my latest album called Friction which is a mix of genres really.. Ambient music scapes, piano, electronica and a hint of industrial flavor.

I hope you enjoy it.. if you do, check out my facebook and let me know.. 

If you're interested in buying a copy to show you liked it, you can find it pretty much anywhere.. amazon, itunes.. you name it.

Thanks for listening,
