,adam_aintnoscrub,2012-04-05T23:22Z,"awesome, not out for another 12 days 
but downloading so slow, i usually about 900kB/s but only getting 40 so far"
,steg28,2012-04-05T23:43Z,"boobsman you always deliver pal, thanks dude"
,pychuuu,2012-04-06T02:48Z,"Jest polski ale tylko napisy, to jest wersja europejska, więc jest po angielsku i ma napisy m.in. po niemiecku, francusku, rosyjsku etc. Pełna polska wersja będzie z dubbingiem i tylko na polski rynek (przy czym mały apel - kupcie ją, to tylko 120 zł a do tego kupa dodatków :) )"
,pychuuu,2012-04-06T02:53Z,"There is polish language in this version, but only subtitles (also En/Ger/Fra/Spa/Ita/Ru)"
,unbsjo5qev,2012-04-06T04:39Z,ETA on the ntsc/rf version? waiting for this one lol
,adriano101,2012-04-06T06:30Z,downloading soo slow... 20kb/s is it downloading fast for anyone?
,jebotetata,2012-04-06T12:32Z,Will it work with topology on LT2.0 ?
,SimStim,2012-04-06T17:26Z,"@boobman Thanks a lot for this title. Would this work with the Xmas Xgd3 topology data (disc profile ID 0C3DF524599094E6CB87ECC8-F87A804E), or is it already patched?"
,Assassinprofessor,2012-04-06T17:28Z,"@jebotetata 
of course it'll work, just like the rest of XGD3 games ;)"
,jaycee88,2012-04-06T19:20Z,so can we play this and not get banned? and when will abgx360 be updated to add this game?
,isrmicha,2012-04-07T15:50Z,"Nice, thanks you boobsman, i still w8 for ntsc :D"
,niels207,2012-04-07T16:09Z,The enhanced edition should contain all dlc from the pc version. Is it on the dics or are there dlc codes for that?
,dunko_83,2012-04-07T16:39Z,Hey boobsman any word on a RF? I would really like to get this game And your games always work please and thank you.
,aldo45,2012-04-08T04:34Z,"Ok, so all the other XGD3 discs I've burned work with no problems.
I have a PAL 360.
Tried burning this with ImgBurn on Windows and ISOBurn on Mac.
Doesn't work.
Loads dashboard, comes up in info pane - press A to play The Witcher 2, then tries to load and says 'This Disc Is Not Supported'....

5th Disc I've tried. Do we need Topology Data or does the ISO need patched?

ANy help would be appreciated because, like I say, all the other Boobsman XGD3's have worked for me, I'm using the same method here that's worked in the past, and nothing....not supported...."
,Kelvin93,2012-04-08T06:20Z,anyone else getting slow speeds such 3kb/s or is it just my Utorrent being weird
,adam_aintnoscrub,2012-04-08T12:37Z,"@Kelvin93 i keep getting unpredicatable speeds with this, although looking at the seeds/leech ratio i'm not surprised. 
i've been downloading this on and off since he uploaded it because i keep stopping it to download other games that download at constant speed.

and @everyone else having problems, get an xkey, so need to patch the iso or whatever or wait for things to be updated to support this, once the xkey is installed just run the iso of an ext HDD and it works as simple as that, straight from the download folder to hdd and nothing else needs to be done.
peace."
,greg74511,2012-04-10T03:23Z,"Hi, Having exactly the same problem as aldo45, haven't found any solutions yet, anyone else having any luck? Cheers"
,Blown240sx,2012-04-11T07:21Z,If you are getting disk unrecognized that means the game requires the XGD3 patching. Try patching the game manually with abgx or xbox back up creator. Reburn and it should work.
,greg74511,2012-04-11T23:29Z,"Problem solved. I had tried patching it with lt.2 topology, but it didn't work. Tried again with another version of the topology (i'd be pretty certain it would be the samer file, so shouldn't make a difference) and updated imgburn. I can only assume updating imgburn was the fix. Cheers."

,Codetester47,2012-04-13T18:44Z,Thank's a Bunch!! 
,drnorris,2012-04-14T07:43Z,Any reason why it's going so dirt slow? Come on now.
,Greenbor,2012-04-15T10:04Z,Hey boobsman can you upload Skullgirls for 360?
,Assassinprofessor,2012-04-16T03:48Z,"after 2 weeks , finally dloaded..n now i'll seeeeeed for another 2 weeks "
,aldo45,2012-04-17T18:59Z,"Sorry, but still got the same problem as before. Have tried patching but still not working.

Could someone point me towards a working topology please? I've tried 3 different ones and they all don't work for me.

This is the only XGD3 I've had any problems with, the Boobsman d/l's are usually as simple as d/l, burn and play for me so I'm bamboozled with this one."
,Assassinprofessor,2012-04-18T17:14Z,Confirmed. It works with topology :)
,draziz,2012-04-18T18:47Z,"What is this topology everybody is talking about?
and even more important, does it work on Mac?????????????"
,neszko,2012-04-18T22:36Z,can anybody write step by step what is this topology? i am downloading backups for a while and this is the first time i see it. please write what it this and how to change it in order to play this game. thanks
,aldo45,2012-04-19T07:02Z,@Assassinprofessor - Please confirm which. Thanks.
,Assassinprofessor,2012-04-19T14:40Z,"burn just like the rest XGD3 games.. layer break should be 'Calculate Optimal since i had a problem once when i burned with User Specified..LB 2133520

Any chance of RF or NTSC/J in the near future??
Cheers."
,TheCarpenter,2012-04-28T21:09Z,Do i need both DVD's to play the game or the second is just extra modes (like it was in Mass Effect 3)?
,yammyhihi,2012-04-29T15:00Z,guuuys would this one play with my NTSC-J console? :( i have been looking for an NTSC-J version but there are none
