Re-compression of the 800+MB mkv files found in the 16GB per season torrents of this show. Didn't want to waste 80GB of disk space on this show. Even at 175MB per file still decent quality. Will share this but I don't have that much upload speed available so please seed during and after download. Without a bunch of seeds you would probably be better of re-compressing it yourself.
