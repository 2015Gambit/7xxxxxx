,bec9211,2012-04-14T09:43Z,hey does anyone know how to watch a mp4 when u have vlc player..or do i need a different player?
,gwapsako,2012-04-16T19:48Z,"@bec921
vlc is one of the best players available around. u wont need another player.
im guessing your default player is something else thats why u cant play it with vlc.
just right click the movie, go to ""open with"",choose vlc or change the default player."
