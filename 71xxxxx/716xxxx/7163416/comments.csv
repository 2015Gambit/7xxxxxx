an exe for a boot disk?"
,XONi49,2012-04-09T17:19Z,"its an exe because it a program that allows you to add drivers to the boot disk as its being made 
this has been around for 5+ years and if you dont trust the exe you dl from here just get the new one from the site and use the serial or better yet buy a serial from them so they keep making new versions of this"
