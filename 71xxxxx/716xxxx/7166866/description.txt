 ORIGINAL SOUND BLASTER 16 CD - Drivers & Applications from 1995.
 =======================================================================
 To all you retro geeks born before 1980 :) Long live old school!

 This Sound Blaster 16 CD contains later DOS, WIN 3.1 & WIN95
 Audio drivers.
 Also included is the complete application suite for each OS!

 I lost this CD for many years and recently found it, I thought I will   upload   this CD to bit torrent since anything from this CD being made   available  by Creative is long gone.
 I have not tested the applications under DOS BOX, when I do Ill mention
 what works etc.
 
 The only thing removed from the original CD is the crappy Audio tracks 
 (which bumped up the file size to over 200 meg)

 Enjoy :)
 
 
P.S. I will leave this torrent on my seed pc permanently, if it has 0 seeds just be patient :) If you found this torrent useful, please seed.
