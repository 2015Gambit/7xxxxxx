I've never uploaded here, but it's probably the same as other torrent sites. You need to download the torrent file from here and start it, but when you do, you need to point the download directory to the directory that holds the files or folder that you want to seed, and your torrent should start out at 100% downloaded and will start seeding as long as you did it right."
