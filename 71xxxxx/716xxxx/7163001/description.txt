Lyrics:

Last year's old news
I'm breaking out my six-string
And playin' from my heart
It's not déjà vu
'Cause it's another summer
That's how this chapter starts

I'm gonna run so fast till I can't breathe
Come along and follow me
Let's make some noise we never did before

It's a brand new day!
Don't you see me?
Changing up my ways
So completely.
This time I'm gonna sing
And you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day
And I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good

So drama free
I'm all about the music
I just wanna sing
Watch me live out my dreams
I'm gonna rock that stage
And give my everything

I'm gonna dance until my feet can't move
Come along; get in the groove
Let's shine bright more than we did before

It's a brand new day
Don't you see me?
Changing up my ways
So completely.
This time I'm gonna sing
And you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day
And I'm feeling good

(What you gonna do? What you gonna do?)
I'm gonna laugh through the summer with you
(Who you gonna be? Who you gonna be?)
You'll just have to watch carefully
(Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?)
Anywhere my heart wants me to go
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna dance
I'm gonna write, I'm gonna play
I'm gonna try, I can do everything

'Cause it's a brand new day
Don't you see me?
Changing up my ways
So completely.
This time I'm gonna sing
And you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day

It's a brand new day
Don't you see me?
Changing up my ways
(It's a brand new day)
Changing up my ways
So completely.
This time I'm gonna sing
And you're gonna hear it
This time I'm gonna show you that I got the spirit
It's a brand new day
And I'm feeling good
(It's a brand new day)
It's a brand new day
And I'm feeling good
Feeling good
And I'm feeling good
