The movies themselves are boring, half-baked splatters with no redeeming elements apart from Takeshi Kitano's participation in the first one. Heck, even the occasional japanese-schoolgirl visual tidbit is too fleeting and buried among ridiculous shooting scenes to count as voyerism-worthy material."
