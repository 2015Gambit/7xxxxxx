Narratives:

The indie rock album by We Were Pirates released in January, 2012. Change is an appropriate album title, as the formerly solo Mike Boggs adds contributors Gabe Fry (The NRIs) on guitar and Kate Rears Burgman (The Alphabetical Order) on cello and bass. In another change, the mastering process was outsourced to T.W. Walsh, who has worked with David Bazan, Ra Ra Riot, and the original hipster-Jesus, Sufjan Stevens. You'll finally get Change you can believe in.
