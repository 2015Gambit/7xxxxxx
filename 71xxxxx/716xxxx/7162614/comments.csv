,boxxxy,2012-09-06T19:18Z,"Do you have any punk rock, specifically the Misfits or (heavens help me) ""Call Me Maybe""? I keep getting asked for these songs and I honestly can't find them anywhere. I'm not having much luck in finding 'good' torrents for karaoke creation either. 

Either way, thank you so much for these files. You rock."
