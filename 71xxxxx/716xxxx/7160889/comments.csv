dont forgot the dead files season 2 starts with a special of lizzies house on the 20th April too"
[T],trialNerror,2012-04-05T20:07Z,"This is the end of the season.
GH returns to finish off season 8 next week.
I'm not doing The Dead Files.
Nothing against psychics, it's a possibility, but when the opening line of a show is ""I see dead people"" ehh, no thanks, M. Night Shyamalan."
[V],psspss,2012-04-06T00:55Z,"did they end of E13? surely just a mid season why it was a non exciting end..

dead files is actually quiet good.. a detective working with a Medium (who talks and sees the dead) a psychic predicts and see flashes of the past
so im told. (well was stated in long island medium.. that woman is so funny if anything.. 
she loud and comes out with the funniest statements)

I think kids etc may have brain chemistry where they
see things with the brain and not eyes.. recall that bbc docu showing how they can beam photos into peoples heads.. a military experiment I think.. stimulate the region of brain that processes images bypassing the eyes,... very interesting cant recall the name of doco but was worth a watch"
