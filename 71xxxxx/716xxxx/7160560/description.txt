Masters of horror Stephen King (The Shining) and George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead) have created a ΓÇ£gripping, creepy, frighteningΓÇ¥ (L.A. Reader) film that ΓÇ£thrills, shocks and works us overΓÇ¥ (Los Angeles Times)! Featuring an ΓÇ£intelligent screenplay and first-rate castΓÇ¥ (The New York Times), including Oscar winner Timothy Hutton. The Dark Half will keep you captivated to the chilling end.

Horror writer Thad Beaumont (Hutton) hopes to distance himself from his murder novels and from George Stark, the name he has used to anonymously author them. To achieve this, he cooks up a murder of his own: a publicity stunt that should lay Stark to rest forever. But when the people around him are found gruesomely slainΓÇôand his own fingerprints dot the crime scenesΓÇôBeaumont is dumbfounded until he learns that Stark has taken on a life of his own...and begun a gruesome quest for vengeance.
