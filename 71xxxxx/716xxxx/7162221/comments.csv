,ionlyknow,2012-04-06T09:15Z,"This does not work. If you try to enter keycode while offline, it will not give you the option to browse because it can't connect to the server. "
,maulerguy,2012-05-31T00:41Z,"Easiest way to use .key files is to disable internet, disable any licenses you already have active, then on activation screen choose to activate as trial. When it can't connect to server it'll give you a screen prompting you to try again or to browse for a .key file."
