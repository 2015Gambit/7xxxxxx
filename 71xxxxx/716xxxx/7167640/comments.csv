I transferred the discs > SHN > CDR back in 2001; this is FLAC encoded (using EAC) from those CDRs. So not a perfect geneology, but here it is.

Would love to track down the Love Sick 8-track single if somebody has it in FLAC; I only have it in 192k MP3 but am going to up that anyway. Another hard collection to find..."
