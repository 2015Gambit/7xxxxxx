And is it a real account of the theft and destruction of Palestine by Britain, Zionist jews, and the continued support of APARTHEID Israel by the USA, or more Zionist lies/propaganda? Thanks."

Yes, it is available in English under the name of ""Palestine"".

Joe Sacco has conversations with Israelis and Palestinians and judges them the same way, so it has nothing to do with propaganda, in fact I could call it ""anti-propaganda"". Cheers!"
