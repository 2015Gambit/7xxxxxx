May we know to whom the credit goes for crafting this Portable App?

I started downloading with 88 seeders in few hours its 141!!! In few days it could rake to a thousand!  Its simply... 

HOT!  

HOT! 

HOT!


Many thanks  huandi.  Many hungry pirates were waiting for this... Just one thing, lets us give the credit where it is due.

If it is with virus it must be undetectable because it passed anti-virus...

First try... it ran... thumbs up!
I'm seeding... definitely.

Thanks for the wonderful torrent! 
I encountered a minor inconvenience though; the activation wizard pops up every time I open any program. Although the program works, this is somewhat annoying. Is there a way to stop it from showing? 
And thanks again man! great stuff :)"
,huandi,2012-04-10T17:58Z,i am happy to serve the pirating cause

,prizedr,2012-05-06T05:29Z,Am I the only one for whom the Ink Tools don't work?
,huandi,2012-05-09T22:56Z,I would suggest for any malfunctions you guys may encounter just re download it and make sure antivirus dosent scan it because it may pick up something on the Microsoft office and delete something on it claiming it is a trojan.
,meta9911,2012-05-10T10:23Z,Best Office upload I've ever found.  TNKS

,jpaz790,2012-05-24T14:22Z,i dont get whats going on. downloaded fine. turned off security. extracted. when i click on the application it looks
,jpaz790,2012-05-24T14:26Z,"i also went to a document on my computer and chose open with, searched for the program winword, and clicked open. it appeared to be loading but then nothing popped up? i have tried the other applications also and nothing worked."
,jpaz790,2012-05-24T14:43Z,redownloaded it with security off. Worked! but then soon as i turned security back on it wount work anymore. so unless u have no virus protection this program will never work
,huandi,2012-05-24T23:02Z,I don't know what to say about your predicament you may be able to program your antivirus to not scan word or to mark it in your antivirus as an exception to scan.

Greetings! I have been using TPB and thought I must start giving back to the community. When I want to Virus test a large file or an ISO I use RAR to make archives of 29MB.
Then I go to https://www.virustotal.com/ and upload each archive to be tested.
I use RAR to make small archives because https://www.virustotal.com has a 32mb Limit per upload. Very time consuming BUT YOUR 99 Percent sure your Virus FREE. Never Sure100 Percent!"
