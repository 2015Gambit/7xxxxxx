Big Fat Simulations proudly presents "Radar Chaos", a fun realistic radar-based 
air traffic control game and simulation. Unlike the Airport Madness series, this 
game is all radar. Instead of controlling an airport's runways and taxiways, you 
instead control the 400 square miles of airspace that surround the airport. 
Radar Chaos is intended for everyone, regardless of aviation experience.
