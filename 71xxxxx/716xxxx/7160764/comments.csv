because ettv has a 350 mb file for
624x352
and its container is avi.
while eztv has an mp4 container
for 384 mb"

Will seed 3 times the file size. "
,anon73a,2012-04-13T02:54Z,"@n1 - Who cares about the file size?!? The main point is ettv is using the archaic .avi, while eztv has the superior mp4."
,tunaFishX,2012-08-01T13:16Z,"About anon73a: Not sure what this blithering idiot is going on about. AVI/MP4 is just a wrapper. The actual codec can be anything. Using MP4 over AVI as the wrapper has a few advantages in terms of extra features such as subtitles etc, but aside from that it is exactly the same."
