The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On this Sunday broadcast, Alex Jones airs his special video breaking down the veiled occultic messages contained within the latest Ridley Scott film, Prometheus. Behind a sci-fi thriller that many are calling a prequel to the Alien series is an esoteric doctrine held by the elites that believes alien contact directed life on Earth and empowered our rulers to dominate the population and transcend into supermen destined for the stars. David Icke joins the program to add his unique perspective on the grand schemes at work, reminding listeners simply that 'This is Not a Bloody Game.' Later, Alex talks with music icon Billy Corgan, founder and head of the Smashing Pumpkins, in an exclusive interview about his brushes with the halls of power, his experiences inside the music industry and his take on humanity's awakening to the establishment's system of control. In another exclusive interview, metal legend Dave Mustaine, founder of Megadeth and former member of Metallica, discusses his own journey through the music scene, his political awakening and take on the current political scene.
