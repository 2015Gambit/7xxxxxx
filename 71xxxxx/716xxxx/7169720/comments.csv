,GDeAngelo,2012-04-10T15:14Z,"Once this downloaded, all it shows is multiple 150mb files that don't open to anything. There is one video clip ""that is great quality"" but it is only one minute long. What am I doing wrong?"
,raskoljnikov,2012-04-10T19:07Z,"Thank you very much for the upload. The quality is fantastic.
@GdeAngelo: these are compressed files. Download FreeOpener to extract the files from the folder. Go here to download software: http://www.freeopener.com/"
,GDeAngelo,2012-04-10T20:08Z,@raskoljnikov I guess that is only for Windows. My Mac doesn't work with it. What I need to download is some time of file opening software?
,eissie,2012-04-10T21:35Z,@GdeAngelo: You could Google keywords: Mac rar freeware and take your pick.
,sfnchz,2012-04-14T08:21Z,"Thanks for the download. Sample works great. I've installed Free Opener but I'm wondering what the file extension of the original files should be changed to so that FreeOpener can extract the .mkv file...   If the extensions are left as they are Free Opener just says 'Sorry, we do not currently support this format'"
