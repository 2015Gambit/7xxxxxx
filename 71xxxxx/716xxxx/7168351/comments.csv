,Agisek,2012-04-20T12:02Z,it needs about 20% more seeds...
,imdajoker,2012-04-20T13:30Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!

The audio is not synced properly and the framerate is extremely choppy"
,3XRated,2012-04-22T21:02Z,Very good torrent and I am currently seeding.
,Skrakablam,2012-09-08T06:35Z,"Just to be clear, these eps were taken from TV and have all the Hub watermarks and this does not contain the last ep. This was put together because before the season ended there was a lack of working torrents that were up to the current episode. Now that the season has been complete for a long time I'm sure there are some stunning full season 780p iTunes torrents around.  If this is what you are looking for then awesome but if not you have been warned!"
