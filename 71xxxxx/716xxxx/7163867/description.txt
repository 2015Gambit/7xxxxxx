Don Linden's Classic Children's Stories Collection Vol 1-8


About Don...

Don Linden, a popular New Zealand entertainer and broadcaster, brings together this collection of children stories and songs that in some cases have not been heard on radio since the 1960s. 
 
 While his Sunday Morning radio programme, Small World, was targeted at children, the audience included all generations, as parents and grandparents alike shared in the childhood memories of the timeless, enchanting stories, some of which are featured in these recordings.
