seeding...."
,AnxiouslyCalm93,2012-04-22T22:08Z,"Fast download,

i didn't install yet because it wants me restart.

When i do install do i have to disconnect from the internet or something? and make ""rules"" idk what that is but let me know if i have to do it."

Disconnect from the internet before installing, and before you reconnect, create rules to block the following applications:

Applications/Little Snitch Configuration
Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch Network Monitor
Library/Little Snitch/Little Snitch UI Agent ""

there you go "

,byterider,2012-07-15T14:01Z,"Does not run on 10.8 Mountain Lion.

Try this: http://www.obdev.at/downloads/LittleSnitch/dp/LittleSnitch-DP4.dmg"
,fatallonglost,2012-07-26T15:34Z,Any idea on when there will be a way to crack 3.0? the link above is to a trial that requires a valid license.
,Hakkr,2012-07-26T23:47Z,"I had a previous [K'd] version of Little Snitch, but when I upgraded to Mountain Lion it stopped working. However, I used the SECOND download at the following link to update my version of Little Snitch to 2.5.3 manually. It seems to be ""licensed"" and working, to my surprise.

I don't know if this will work for everyone, but I have Little Snitch on Mountain Lion, and it's not asking me for a serial or anything."
,Hakkr,2012-07-27T02:44Z,"Ok it did stop after 3 hours of use. However, the following serial key activates it. Just be sure to block Little Snitch's outgoing connections with Little Snitch. Oh the irony...

Five family member license key:
