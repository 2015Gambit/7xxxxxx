,Palaistid,2012-08-25T12:10Z,"Viktor227, its really simple. Somewhere in your computer [probably on your C:] must be a folder called mods with the games of the kingdoms. move third age folder in there and there should be no problem on starting playing. But when you go to a battle it says there is a problem with mtw2 and it closes. Can anybody help?"
