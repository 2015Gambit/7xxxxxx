Awesome Medieval 2: Total War Kingdoms fan-made mod. More info on TWCenter. Torrent includes latest version of mod.



Requirements:
- TATW 3.1 is a stand-alone version and does not require any existing installations of TATW!
- If you have installed a previous version of TATW, it is recommended to delete the old version before installing TATW 3.1.
(Note that TATW doesn't change any registry settings of your system, so you can also delete the old TATW folder (Third_Age) manually.)
- TATW 3.1 requires the 'Medieval 2 - Kingdoms Expansion' and is compatible with the official patch 1.04 and 1.05. One installed campaign of the 'Kingdoms Expansion' is enough.

Installation:
- Install TATW_3.0_Part1of2.exe, TATW_3.0_Part2of2.exe & TATW_3.1_Patch.exe into the default 'Medievall II Total War' directory.
(Normally this is: 'Programs/SEGA/Medieval II Total War')
If you have installed Medieval II into another folder, please select the folder manually.
- Start the mod with the 'Third Age - Total War' shortcut on your desktop
