Thanx, Annoyme, for getting the word out so quickly. "
,thunderbum,2012-04-05T23:11Z,"LOL!! I'd love to hear/read that letter as well! Should prove interesting (to say the least! I'll bet the legal obamabots in the WH just about had fits trying to come up with the required 'home work' and parsed every word 20 times! LMAO!!

Annoyme - as always - thank you for today's podcast! :) Much appreciated!"

Here's the document in question - and it works out to 2 full pages plus about 1/3 of page three.

You're posting these means a lot to those of us living on the far side of things.
As to your ""teach a class"" comment - this entire regime experience has, I HOP, taut the U.S.A. a needed lesson about what is right and what is wrong.

And yes, in spite of all I've seen, I am still an optimist.

Albeit, a very well armed optimist."
