2012: The Final Prophecy
Having already foreseen World War I and the 2006 Asian tsunami, should we take seriously the Mayan prophecies that the world will end in 2012?
What if the Maya were right about the end of humanity as we know it? Would fire pour from the sky, buildings shatter, floods destroy Washington DC and Los Angeles slide into the Pacific? That's how Hollywood has interpreted the end of the Maya great calendar cycle on December 21, 2012, in the movie "2012" with John Cusack. 



This captivating documentary looks for the truth behind the compelling myth - is there evidence of global upheaval on a massive scale? We follow scientist Adam Maloof to three continents on a detective story that spans eons, with clues embedded in the oldest rocks on the planet.
