Hawaii doesn't have its own state police force but the Governor has set up a special task force, which becomes known as "Five-0", to investigate serious crimes on the islands. Reserve Naval officer Steve McGarrett heads the team with Danny Williams as his second in command and together they tackle a range of crimes with more far-reaching consequences than those dealt with by HPD, including terrorism and serious organized crime.
