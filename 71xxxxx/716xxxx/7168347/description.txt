Deep Cuts, Volume 1 (1973ΓÇô1976) is a compilation of Queen tracks between 1973 and 1976. Unlike other compilations released by Queen, Deep Cuts contains songs which are largely not as well known as Queen's hits. The album was released on March 14, 2011 as part of Queen's 40th Anniversary. Deep Cuts Volume 1 was released at the same time Queen's first five albums (Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack, A Night at the Opera, A Day at the Races) were re-released. The songs picked were all personal favorite songs that weren't hits selected by Brian May, Roger Taylor, and Taylor Hawkins (the drummer for the Foo Fighters). It's the only release to feature the complete ending of The March of The Black Queen (on Queen II it segues to Funny How Love Is) and of Ogre Battle (on Queen II it segues to The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke). The three songs Tenement Funster, Flick of the Wrist and Lily of the Valley all segue into each other just like on the original Sheer Heart Attack album.
