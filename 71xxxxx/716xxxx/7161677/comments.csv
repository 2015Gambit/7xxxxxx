,blackarun,2012-04-06T12:18Z,"Use the latest version of vlc player or k-lite codec pack and everything will works fine. Some people experience problems because of using older decoders. If you experience any problems playing this file, It is time for upgrading your video player. Note: All future rip's will be on x264 algorithm because of its greater quality and compression. Get vlc player for all o.s. here http://ww w. videolan.org /vlc/ (remove space of above link or google it)"

,wipeout4w,2012-04-07T23:40Z,"This has the subs for the Targaryen scene, right?"
,murtaza786,2012-04-08T19:44Z,"a 9 v 8
very good copy for just 197 mb... so perfect for u if u ve a low download speed... the subs for targaryen scenes are missing but so are they in the ettv version, so no complaints there.. thanks blackarun
and i should not say this after detailed comments about the episode but to those who are still confused whether to download or not as the uploader does not ve a green skull or a pink one :) go for it, its 100 % legit"
,wtfname,2012-04-09T03:56Z,"@murtaza786  NICE TRY.... This is Spy Ware PPL!!  196Mb Really people.. You are that Thick?  You deserve this Mag Link if you were stupid enough to DL it.

The the Poster @blackarun You R SCUM... GTFO TPB NOW !!!!!!!"
[H],zMTz,2012-04-09T04:29Z,"Plays absolutely fine in VLC 2.01

Now stop with the fake nonsense."
,wtfname,2012-04-09T06:23Z,"@blackarun

My Apologies for writing what I wrote on your Mag Link.  If I could erase the former I would.  Admin/Helper from TPB claims it good & that's good enough 4 me.

I do not make a habit of writing on others pages & I jumped the gun on yours.. Again Many Apologies.  I Hope many did not listen to me!!"
,Heartlessboy55,2012-04-09T08:43Z,"When I play it on vlc player, it only plays the sound. how can i fix that?"
,ManlyDerp,2012-04-10T18:56Z,"Definitely not fake. Works just fine! In a .MKV format, but nothing wrong with getting a third-party application such as VLC or Perian if your OS doesn't have a default application to play it.

Thanks blackarun, my family and I appreciate it very much."
,trubby,2012-04-21T08:08Z,Thanks blackarun!!.... works great with VLC and no viruses...:)
