,godessnyx,2012-05-02T14:04Z,Thanks for this but mine has no audio at all?
[T],immagical,2012-05-02T15:09Z,"Cant think whats wrong,,    audio is there and working!!

have you audio when just playing the file straight from downloading on your pc??    or is it when you put the avi on a disc or usb you have no audio??"
[T],immagical,2012-05-02T15:18Z,"@godessnyx   just currious what media player have you tried.   try vlc as it has all the audio codecs to play all media.   and check you have the correct setting.   you may just have to select an different audio format on your player.

windows media player=working
vlc media player (video Lan)=working
windows media centre=working.
divX player=working.

these are all the players i have on pc and no prob's with any, so it does sound like you may have audio codec missing in whatever player you use.   check other files/movie's you have and compare the audio codecs see if they are the same and check if those have audio.

this file has :  audio codec:  a52

channels 6.  3F2R/LFE

Audio Sample Rate: 48Hz


let me no if you find what problem is.."
