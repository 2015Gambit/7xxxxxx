,mfmedia,2012-04-30T14:42Z,If you have problem with patching in the generator check if you are running the program as Administrator. If not right click on the file and run as Administrator. It worked for me!
,MWombat,2012-05-03T20:13Z,Great Ty =)  Software like this should be standard to come with an OS......

,Twilight_Princess_Zelda,2012-06-18T17:22Z,"ok, i dont know what the f*** im doing. you dont enplane all the step's that need to be taken in this program. i keep getting ""errors"" every time i try and open a file, and every time i try to register it, it does not register. when i do the free try out it tell's me i have to Download another program called ""Magic Disk"". i thought this was all i needed for opening what i indeed, but apparently not."
,calibur-death,2012-06-27T20:50Z,"I am a noob, let's get that out of the way. kay, I downloaded this so I could download something else. it told me to right-click the thing, and click mount. I did, and then it pulled up nothing but another option, to install. I click that, it pulls up a website that asks to download magiciso. Should I do so, even though I've already downloaded it here?"
