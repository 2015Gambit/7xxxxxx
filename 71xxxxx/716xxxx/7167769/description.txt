Welcome to the Freeworlds: Tides of War demo! In this demonstration package you will be able to fly over 100 vessels, see firsthand the improvements to the Freelancer graphics engine, engage in combat with the non-playable characters (NPCs) and engage in player versus player (PvP) combat with other players. This demo does not contain full gameplay functionality that will be in the final release such as dockable capital ships, dynamic economy, player influence system or any of the final canon star systems.
In the demo, there are two systems where all of your interaction will take place: the combat prototype system and the capital prototype system.
