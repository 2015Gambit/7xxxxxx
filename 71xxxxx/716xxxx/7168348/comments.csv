,JayNic,2012-04-13T04:29Z,"Hardcoded subs... Wait for a new release - there are loads of scenes with Russian, and Tagalog dialogue that you can't read the english subs for because they're overridden with fricken hardcoded korean..

Lame"
,spankdaddy,2012-04-13T15:00Z,I totally agree the hard coded subs are just brutal in this case and many conversations are impossible to make out. 
,extracube,2012-05-07T07:20Z,Thanks for the warnings.  I already have the Korean subs version from a month ago.
