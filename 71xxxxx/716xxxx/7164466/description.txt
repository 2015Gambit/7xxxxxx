An argument that began 150 years ago with a stunning discovery in Germany's Neander valley may soon come to an end in an ultra-sterile lab at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. Genetic anthropologist Svante Pääbo is teasing the genetic secrets out of bones that have lain buried as glaciers advanced and retreated over Europe. Today, the building is sweltering, the air conditioning is out, but Pääbo is coolly confident that he has found a way to reassemble the genetic code of a Neanderthal who lived in Croatia 45,000 years ago and who may provide answers to some important questions: Were Neanderthals a separate species from us? Did they interbreed with modern humans? Do their genes survive in modern humans?

"The big picture is that modern humans came out of Africa and replaced Neanderthals," says Pääbo, a bristly browed Swede with a penchant for wearing sandals and goofy socks. "The really important question is what the mutations are that became fixed in [modern] humans. What are these things that are unique to us with respect to Neanderthals?"
