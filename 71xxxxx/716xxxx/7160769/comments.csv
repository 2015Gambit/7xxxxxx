,botcrawl,2012-04-05T08:10Z,hell yeah this is good quality after waking up at 7am and having diarrhea.
,Spudgun17,2012-04-05T08:57Z,"Another top quality download from eztv, thanks! Soz to hear about your bottom gravy botcrawl, hope it solidifies soon. I've been up since 3am thanks to a bastard cat chorus in the alleyway out back, watching this episode is the perfect antidote to a fuzzy head. Maybe I should have breaded the little buggers. Cheers for free shit Pirate Bay!"

I don't know if that's a compliment or an insult..."
,xboxhaloalive,2012-04-05T09:34Z,im with fraddman wtf compliment or insult?
,SnedzyHD,2012-04-05T09:53Z,it sounds like he thinks it's the shit
,Spyxz,2012-04-05T09:57Z,"Of course it's a compliant. Anything has better consistency than diarrhea, even poor video quality."
,Geethirteen,2012-04-05T10:07Z,"i dont like these codecs atm they seem 2 really suk recently & i no its not my codec pack or player but all the mkv & mp4 files are no good

pixelated is an understatement lol end up using a different player running the same codec pack lol wtf
y did it need 2 change in the 1st place i dont get it what was wrong with the old avi/xvid etc???

same goes 4 moronic uploaders that compress for example a 700mb movie in2 690mb archive
whats the point if it doesnt really save you time or effort y waste ur time in the 1st place
just seem so stupid 2 me"
,Raapzaad,2012-04-05T10:32Z,Faith Hilling is NOT DEATH!
,Spudgun17,2012-04-05T10:40Z,"To fraddman and xboxhaloalive - SnedzyHD is partially correct about it being the shit. I was just saying thanks to pirate bay for free stuff/shit, that's all. Being English, I use the word shit, well, shit loads! When I ask my boyfriend if he wants tea (I'm not a 'he'), I ask ""Do yer want a right shittin gradely brew or what?"" etc."
,cactjunk,2012-04-05T13:40Z,Excellent sound + video as always 10/10. mp4 is practically indistinguishable from AVI/xVid yet its 10x as small - smaller file size = easier to seed to more people and better for those not blessed with 50mbps internet connections. Perfect UL again EZ 
,ajtdawg,2012-04-05T14:00Z,"a/v: 10

,thedude1979,2012-04-07T04:48Z,"nice quality. not a bad episode, just a Wtf  ending"
