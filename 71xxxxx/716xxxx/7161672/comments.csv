,Trisste,2012-04-05T14:02Z,"As in his previous films, Savage takes a critical look at the delicate theme of contemporary England, on this occasion examining social inequality. He originally planned a film about homelessness, but gradually found himself uncovering the problem as a serious hidden predicament of society. Here, too, he spent a lot of time studying the environment: he visited countless shelters and temporary accommodation facilities and assimilated the stories of dozens of desperate people. He set his story in a shelter for the homeless and other social outcasts seeking temporary asylum, where the lives of several characters experiencing deep crisis come together. Pregnant Michelle and her little daughter sought refuge from a violent husband, Robert has recently been released from prison, and journalist Yemi and his wife and child had to leave their native Nigeria in fear of their lives. Wealthy 40-year-old prospective father Mark (Colin Firth) feels shame and guilt in the face of those who have not shared his fortune in life. One day he starts a job as a â&#x20AC;&#x153;street workerâ&#x20AC;?."
