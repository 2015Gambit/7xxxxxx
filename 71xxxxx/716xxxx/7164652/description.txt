Latexotica was a site dedicated to the latex fetish that operated between 2002 and 2011 before it stopped updating. The site opened in 2002 as AmateurLatex before going on to adopt the Latexotica moniker in 2005. The site features different kinds of latex outfits in many different colours. For the most part the images are non-nude however, there are topless and nude pics depending upon when the set was shot and who was being shot.

Ealier this year, the Latexotica domain was transferred to the hands of one of the models who appeared on the site. Said model is Lilly Roma who appeared as Anastacia and was the most popular model on the site. Ms. Roma currently plans to re-open the site this summer.
