,velicity,2012-04-06T11:06Z,"This is NOT a BDrip

While I thank you for the effort, all other sites have relabelled this torrent as a HDRIP and a bad one at that due to the cropping.

A=6
V=3

,hkgrguy,2012-04-06T18:52Z,"This is seriously disappointing. Over 5 hours to DL only to find rar files in 86parts - WTF for????????? seriously dude... and on top of that... it is HORRIBLY cropped - probably from hard Korean - and definitely NOT BDRip. Very, very, very... VERY, disappointing."

""watchable"" - NOT BDRip or HD... and crappy crop because the hard coded subs can still be seen (slightly though)... therefore STILL very, very, very disappointing... especially coming from scenebalance who is supposed to be trusted... I'll wait for a true BDRip to "
