,QuickSoul,2012-04-07T12:30Z,Could somebody upload the LAN-fix required to play Lara Croft Guardian of Light on LAN? It is nowhere to be found and you need it to play over LAN even if and when you own legal copies of the game. 
,baelferuz,2012-04-07T16:25Z,can we play multiplayer in this using hamachi?

,anon149,2012-04-07T18:01Z,"This is EXACTLY why I do not pay Ubisoft.

There's no LAN support. So you can't play on LAN if you don't have Internet/Cracked version.

Anyone has a crack for Online?"
,WontEverSeed,2012-04-07T18:04Z,"omg this guys. Is is so hard to make a single player  HacknSlash first person perspective?

,bloodypandas,2012-04-07T20:18Z,Could you crack confrontation plz
,0rochimaru,2012-04-08T15:32Z,"^ Fail-person shitters are for retards.

This game has not co-op for the THETA version... maybe this one also.

There is a crack, but it's unconfirmed to work.

If anyone could confirm 2-player OFFLINE co-op working or not, it would be appreciated."
,tinytheboss,2012-04-08T16:10Z,"Can you crack warp?
looks fun"
,Tjuh,2012-04-08T16:11Z,"This version is just for single player, no co-op at all!"
,zendoang,2012-04-08T16:53Z,"this's bullshit , there's no iso file that we can burn or mount , and if I juts put crack on binaries without burned or mounted it , it won't work"
,Tjuh,2012-04-08T17:50Z,"@zendoang

The fault obviously lies with you, because it is a valid iso file, just no co-op is all."
,zendoang,2012-04-08T18:52Z,"@Tjuh 

what do you mean ? I can't even play .. everytime I open the file ( crack ) , it always close"

,pytech,2012-05-11T06:12Z,"Game works perfectly.  This is a side scrolling shooter.  You play a pissed off redneck who waging war on technology. Lots of weapons and upgrades.  Graphics are simple, so it should play well on most systems.

Mounted with - PowerISO

WinXP x64 - SP2
GT430 - DX9.0c
Intel I3-2120 @3.3GHZ
8Gigs Ram @1600"
