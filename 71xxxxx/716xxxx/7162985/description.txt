"That's Not My Penguin" 

While working a hostage situation 
with Detective Vega, Detective 
Michael Britten unexpectedly finds 
himself collaborating with Dr. Lee. 
In an effort to calm down Gabriel 
Wyath -- a patient who has threatened 
to blow up a mental hospital -- 
Britten is compromised, and the 
effects follow him into his other 
reality. Meanwhile, Rex introduces 
his girlfriend, Emma, to his dad and 
Bird shows concern over Britten's 
lack of focus due to his sleepless 
nights.
