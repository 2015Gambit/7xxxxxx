So today is my 26th birthday and to celebrate things a bit differently , how about a present for you?

Today, ItΓÇÖs my pleasure to announce the ΓÇÿLaunchΓÇÖ of the new look to the site, and to add the cherry how about a brand new song to boot.

Check www.macamusic.com (Links to facebook, twitter etc there)


IΓÇÖd just like to say a big thank you to everyone, family, friends that gave me their support and helped me  while I was making this track, especially Billy Allen who helped me get the final mix. I had a blast doing this track and thereΓÇÖs a lot more to come.

Since I own my material and I know everyone is ΓÇÿbrokeΓÇÖ (join the club) IΓÇÖm putting this track up for Free download. Fuck ACTA. SOPA etc. 

The only thing I ask you to do is to listen, IF you like the track then share it, seed it, tweet it or burn a copy for your friends.

DonΓÇÖt forget to like my page on facebook and follow me on twitter, it all helps!!
I hope you like Hardtime and if you donΓÇÖtΓÇª.. then tough shitΓÇª.

Thanks
