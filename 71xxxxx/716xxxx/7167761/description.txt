Zuill Bailey’s recording of J.S. Bach's Suites for Solo Cello (TEL3197802) was released in 2010 and went straight to the top of the “Billboard” classical chart.

Last year he brought out a critically acclaimed CD devoted to music for cello and piano by Brahms (TEL3266402). This, his latest release, features one of the most enduring works in the romantic repertoire, Antonin Dvorak’s Cello Concerto. The orchestra on the disc, which also includes two of the composer’s Symphonic Poems “The Water Goblin” and “In Nature’s Realm”, is the Indianapolis Symphony and the conductor is Jun Märkl.

Zuill Bailey made his Telarc debut early in early 2009 with a CD called “Russian Masterpieces for Cello”, a disc which featured music by Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich.

Towards the end of last year he joined forces with pianist Simone Dinnerstein in a critically acclaimed recording of Beethoven’s complete works for piano and cello. Since then his recording of J S Bach’s cello suites has been a massive success particularly in the USA where it spent four weeks in a row at No. 1 on the Billboard classical chart, and even made the top 30 in the New Artists chart.

Antonin Dvorak’s Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104, B. 191 was written in 1894–1895 for his friend, the cellist Hanuš Wihan. Dvořák wrote the concerto while in New York during his third term as the Director of the National Conservatory.
