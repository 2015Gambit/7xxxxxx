I fund these in the Fundamentals videos, haven't got to the other levels yet.

Am sure anyone who has watched the videos will be able to understand what I mean.

Anyway the Lynda.com Photoshop Elements 9 Essential Training video by Jan Kabili was very good, I found no such errors in her videos that I found in this one."
