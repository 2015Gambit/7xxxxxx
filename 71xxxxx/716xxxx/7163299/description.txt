Ciel and Sebastian continue to pursue Jack the Ripper and come to a confrontation at the house of the latest victim, Mary Jane Kelly. They discover that the murderer is a combination of Madame Red and Grell, the latter is actually a grim reaper. While Sebastian is busy fighting Grell, Madame Red attempts to kill Ciel, but she hesitates and refuses to kill him. Grell kills Madame Red because of this and her life is played back before her eyes, as grim reapers can see a person's memories as they die. She had always been jealous of her elder sister, whom married the Earl of Phantomhive, but could never bring herself to hate her sister. Even after marrying another man and conceiving a child, an accident killed her husband, and an abortion was to be undergone to save her life, making her unable to have children. The following month she visited her sister only to see the once great mansion colored with the red color she despised so much. When one of her patients approached her for an abortion, claiming children were a nuisance, Madame Red decided to kill those who would throw such a precious thing away. Later that night, she followed and killed her patient in crazed desperation. It was then that she met Grell, and the two of them murdered prostitutes that have had abortions as Jack the Ripper since then. Sebastian is then ordered by Ciel to kill Grell.
