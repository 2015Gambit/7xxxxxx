ReleaseNotes:

Disclaimer II is the second album released by the post-grunge band Seether. This disc is a recompilation of the band's first album, Disclaimer, from 2002. Although the 12 tracks from the original album are present, they have been slightly remixed and differ from the original. Also, the majority of the remixed tracks feature additional lead guitar melodies with the addition of a permanent lead guitarist to the band's line-up prior to the release of the album. In Europe, the album includes four tracks more than its predecessor; in the United States, the album has eight extra tracks, some of which had been previously released on soundtracks, such as "Hang On," which had been featured on the 2003 Daredevil soundtrack and "Out of My Way," which had been featured on the soundtrack to the 2003 horror film Freddy vs. Jason. "Fine Again" also appeared on Madden NFL 2003 and 1080 Avalanche. This is the uncensored version.


We rip the descriptions from cduniverse, allmusic, and
amazon. HHI does not express  any opinion either way with
regard to the quality of the band/artist etc.
We hope you enjoy the quality of the rip!
