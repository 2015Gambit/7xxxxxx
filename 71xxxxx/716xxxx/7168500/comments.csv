Any hope for that Holy Grail ""Vectorworks"" ??"

,Daave311,2012-04-09T06:44Z,"Perhaps I'm missing something but the Installation instructions say:

Install using STANDALONE license (NOT NETWORK)


Replace this file:

/Applications/Autodesk/AutoCAD 2013/AutoCAD 2013.app/Contents/MacOS/libadlmint.dylib

How exactly are you supposed to find this file? When you click on AutoCAD 2013.app it opens up AutoCAD. and I assume that beyond installing as a stand alone licence you are supposed to choose trial or enter in the serial number and key code provided straight away?"
,Daave311,2012-04-09T06:56Z,"Polisdavid, My apologize for my last comment I'm still new to OSX and didn't realize the function Go to Folder in finder to go directly to the folder to replace the libadlmint.dylib file.

Anyway thank you for the painless install."

,macomaniac,2012-04-11T05:23Z,"Hi Kpozo4!

Once AutoCAD installed, you can go to : /Applications/AutoDesk/AutoCAD 2013. Inside said folder, make a 'Secondary-click' (equivalent of Mouse 'Right-click' - if you have a Mac laptop, go to : Apple Menu/System Preferences/Trackpad/Check 'Secondary click' and choose method) on 'AutoCAD 2012.app' (not to launch it). Choose 'Display pack content'. Open 'Contents'. Open 'Mac OS'. Drag and drop file 'libadlmint.dylib' of the 'AutoCAD 2013 SN + Crack' folder to 'Contents' folder, choosing to replace the file already in place. Done."
,macomaniac,2012-04-11T06:27Z,[Forgive the typos. Read : 'AutoCAD 2013.app' (not 2012) ; Drag... to 'Mac OS' folder (not 'Contents')]

AutoCAD 2013 is fully compatible with Lion 10.7. This torrent contains the complete bundle of the app. Nothing else needed to have it working. "
,FireStorm50,2012-04-23T21:35Z,"hey guys, I'm having trouble installing this file, after removing the previous AutoCAD 2011 from my macbook, starting the installation file, typing up the serial codes, it can't seem to install AutoCAD in a Destination location, it keeps showing that Examing file stuff, even after 20 minutes, I can't seem to go past the Destination Location, can anyone help me out? thanks"
,c-w-g,2012-04-27T02:48Z,"So, I've downloaded the file, unzipped the zip file and... the ONLY file in it is the .dmg... WHERE is the crack??? No where is the libadlmint.dylib that needs to be replaced?

I don't even see an instruction sheet!

Are there files now missing in this download?

Please help... thanks"
,c-w-g,2012-04-27T02:52Z,Sorry... I see now this was buried WITHIN the dmg file. Unusual to see it packaged this way... 
,c-w-g,2012-04-27T03:17Z,"holy crap! installed... running... stable!!!

easiest install ever!

thanks!!!"
,c-w-g,2012-04-27T04:53Z,"I am wondering one thing though after install. it's saying ""unlicensed version"" at the top of the drawing. I installed the full version with serial number. Any words about this? Is anyone else seeing this? Does this mean it could stop working as if it's a trial version?"
,jamesnk,2012-04-28T17:24Z,i keep getting the serial you entered is not valid on activation screen. any help? new to this! thanks
,pedropunky,2012-05-10T16:28Z,"Hey everyone, apparently there are instructions somewhere... but all I can find is a zip file and two rtf files.. did I miss something?"

,sanmiglighter,2012-05-26T08:34Z,This is Frikkin' awesome! No brainer installations unlike the others that make you go through hoops of fire and still it won't work. Kudos polisdavid! Keep up the awesomeness!

,Ep0nA,2012-05-31T03:31Z,"Hello, thanks for sharing, polisdavid. I'm sure your intentions are good but, it seems I have a mysterious missing folder catastrophe, I found the ""thelibadlmint.dylib"" file already, but I can't find the ""AutoCAD 2013 SN + Crack"" folder to replace this file. I looked around everywhere on my hard drive and got nothin'! This is very frustrating. I'm stuck using the 30 day trial right now. I would kindly appreciate some advice. Thanks."
,Ep0nA,2012-05-31T04:14Z,Hey never mind! I found it already. Works great! Thank you so much for sharing.
,Ep0nA,2012-05-31T05:45Z,"Wait a minute... it still says ""UNLICENSED VERSION"" at the top of the screen even though I was pretty sure I fixed the problem please help!"
,sanmiglighter,2012-05-31T09:29Z,"@Ep0nA Yea, I also got this ""UNLICENSED VERSION"" text on top, is this going to be a problem later on?"
,zak_99,2012-06-05T10:29Z,"I am also getting the ""UNLICENSED VERSION"" text on top. tried reinstalling but the same, Can you help pls?"

,mdb1982,2012-07-24T16:03Z,"Anyone else getting issues with this crashing constantly?  Was working perfectly for a few weeks, then randomly closes completely saying an error has occurred...on relaunch it lasts about 20mins before happening again...any ideas?"
,davidryan,2012-08-17T04:58Z,"'UNLICENSED VERSION' does this mean it is not authenticated, or is it just a default thing"
,yussefsonda,2012-09-03T21:35Z,"Thanx bro, works perfect, and way easy to activate, regards, from Monterrey, Mexico XD"
,rgarjr78,2012-09-10T08:42Z,"those who are getting the UNLICENSED VERSION, there's another torrent on the Mac section that uses a keygen to activate AutoCAD. "
,Go-Pirate,2012-09-14T18:30Z,"Thank you very much!

Unfortunately, officially, it won't run in Mountain Lion.

AutoCAD 2013 for Mac Beta (Service pack) somewhere?"
