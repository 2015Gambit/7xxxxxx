The books of music history will reveal to you that Ian Dury and the Blockheads is a band that has enjoyed five hits and two Top Ten albums from 1978 to 1980, but this achievement undoubtedly is not a fair measure of what Ian Dury has left at hands of music lovers.
Product from the art schools of the post-war England, talented, modern and controversial, to Ian Dury, was never obstacle the physical disability that accompanied him since he was 7 years old, is more, I use it to parody the exhibitionism of a common Rock star standing on a bridge between Rock and Roll and the Music Hall.
This post is just to try to rescue the artist from that small place in rock┬┤s story that left to him his hit Sex & drug & Rock and Roll, this post is to share with you one of the best performances of Ian Dury with his Blockheads recorded live at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1985, with Ian Dury showing his way, own and inimitable through his most famous songs, though maybe unfamiliar to you , almost an hour of fun, joy and good music.
God bless Ian Dury....
