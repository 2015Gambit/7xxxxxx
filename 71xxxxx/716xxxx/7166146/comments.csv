,Nimh,2012-04-07T09:17Z,"Sir Paul can't encode.  

I dont know what he does but these are unplayable on other machines or you must use VLC player on a PC. 

Sir Paul, why can;t you encode your videos like everyone else so that they play or a variety of players?   please fix (not that you will)"
,Gingertiger,2012-04-07T09:35Z,"Yep it wont work on a PS3, I will try on a VLC player later lets hope its works ok ???"
,Nimh,2012-04-07T10:03Z,"It will work with VLC but thats my point Sir Paul's torrents aren't good. Why have your uploads limited to one player? 

DO NOT DOWNLOAD"

,mibmib007,2012-04-07T12:56Z,stop bitching about free stuff or rip yourselfe or just reencode it for other players.. pfft
,portydert,2012-04-07T13:55Z,"lol. everything on tpb is FREE. 

but there are good well encoded stuff and shitty crap...

,Nimh,2012-04-07T16:36Z,"This TV show is free too.  Its not PPV.  

How many others get their encodes right? Don't think its needless bitching to criticize Sir Paul's dodgy attempts at uploads."
,Labwrath,2012-04-07T17:12Z,one pass in mkvmerge and you're good to go. Works for every shitty encode.
,muky-clunge-junk,2012-04-07T18:44Z,sir paul sucks balls hope s4a isnt using this tool instead of rudous the king of sport encoding 
,A_Dying_Baby,2012-04-07T20:07Z,thank u
,marcman951,2012-04-07T20:31Z,"The download works perfect here. Install the latest k-lite codec pack and enjoy.
And the complaining is pretty adolescent, especially when the torrent is free..."
,Brainfryd,2012-04-07T21:11Z,"Works fine, if a bit large in size.  Thanks for the upload ;)

It's got a bit more stuff in it than it really needs, but less than a quarter of the 720p uploads.

For the PS3, well, the list of things that POS won't play natively is long.  Try using a media server for the PS3 instead.  Or encode it in something old enough for Sony to remember how to play.

I like my VLC player, it's great :)  If you don't want to use it, then get off your butt and learn a bit about encoding instead of whining on a forum about how somebody else didn't wipe your ass for you :p

FYI, tested on PS3, WMP11, VLC, all worked fine."
,Woogy,2012-04-08T11:37Z,"It's an avi file and works fine for me in regular stock standard windows media player. I don't get whats with a lot of these comments. Quality is also fine and it was a quick download. thanks sir Paul.

Nimh give yourself an upercut son"
,gyenizse,2012-04-08T21:02Z,"@Brainfryd...first off your an idiot..if a PS3 wont play something on the HD, then the media server wont play it on the PS3 either dummy..secondly, PS3 normally plays .avi files so this is an anomaly...thirdly, y did u say ""FYI, tested on PS3, WMP11, VLC, all worked fine"" if it doesnt work on PS3? and last but not least...PS3 will play everything except .mkv files, UNLESS your an idiot and cant figure out how to make it play everything else lol...UNFORTUNATELY BRAINFRYD IS actually brain fried, for this torrent was encoded improperly and will not play on PS3...other than this this uploaders torrents always work on ps3....thanks anyways."
,heytrid,2012-04-09T01:25Z,"if you are not watching with vlc or planning to re-encode then do not bother with this torrent.

That being said it was fast and does look/work fine on vlc"
,thehungriesthippo,2012-04-10T19:27Z,Sound is glitchy and completely desyncs with the video after 5 minutes if you download and plug into a tv via USB to watch. Utter shit do not download
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-04-23T06:42Z,"For a while I avoided this torrent because some of you were saying it wouldn't play on PS3. I just assumed that if it wouldn't play on there then it wouldn't on Xbox 360 either. Well, I just tried it and Xbox 360 opened it up fine."
,UINAbleDanger,2012-07-10T06:24Z,Password protected ...dont waste your time with this download
