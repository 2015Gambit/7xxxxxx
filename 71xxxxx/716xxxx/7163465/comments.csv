,0Gravity,2012-04-10T18:18Z,There is an update on google play(android market) that is available. And i dont know anything about these cracked apps. Is it possible for me to update this app?
,ZombieWarez,2012-04-11T18:26Z,"@0Gravity I don't know exactly what your question is but I will try to answer it...Ok for one this is the latest version as of now. You need to have the free trial version installed before using this. All this does is simply ""unlock"" or remove the ""trial"". If you already downloaded and installed this app and now your device is showing an update or a latest version for this app then no you cannot update because once you try to update you will have to purchase it. On my device is shows v3.9.0 but this is v3.9.4 Some apps vary on the version number from device to device. I try to keep my apps(torrents) up to date with the market but I only have time on the weekends sometimes and here and there when ever I get a chance to add a new torrent. But let me know what device you have and what version does it show for your device and I will try to get it uploaded for you."
