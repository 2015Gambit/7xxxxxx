Enjoyed the movie quite a bit :)

Only Sync problems occur for around a minute a short way into the film but it sorts itself out so well worth a watch. 

Great Upload

quality looks good, movie looks good = downloading..."
,omgwtfnoob,2012-04-10T09:54Z,"oh, and anyone with out of sync audio, play the movie with VLC, and then go to Tools > Effects and Filters > Synchronization, and set a time delay of audio over video to resync it up."

A 7
V 6

That one's very watchable, so i wouldn't waste bandwidth downloading another until there's an actual DVDrip or BDrip. Cheerio."

,Le Wobbler,2012-04-26T01:07Z,Never watched a CAM R5 before but this was fine - give or take a little audio sync problems in the middle of the film - soon righted itself.  V8 A7 only because of the sync problem otherwise the audio is fine.

,xtheghost,2012-05-03T00:33Z,"Do people need a lesson on how to rate these movies? 

10/10 is reserved for Blu-Ray (equivalent quality rips)

If it's not a crisp, solid rip why sit here and say that it is? Most of us don't NOT download something just because it's not perfect (if we don't care) but don't give it a higher rating just because it's best one available so far.

PS. This movie should be rated as follows:
V/7-8
A/5 (Cam Audio) 

**Pretty good for Cam Audio, but no where near a 10."
