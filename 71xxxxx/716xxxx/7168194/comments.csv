,dududus,2012-04-08T06:39Z,Thanks man.. but I think it's time the xvid format was laid to rest.. x264 just looks so much better.
,metalcider,2012-04-09T04:06Z,"dududus: sure, at the same bitrate x264 is superior to XVID in the same way that AAC or OGG are superior to MP3 for audio.

But often enough compatibility and support are more important than a slightly better quality (which most of the time is unnoticeable)."
