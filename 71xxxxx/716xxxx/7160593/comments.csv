[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-09T10:30Z,"The Bleach i Uploaded are the best bleach Quality Episodes you will ever find at this time, Before they release the Blu ray Seasons Later on. 
The Bleach episodes i uploaded were 720p but were Crop to 480p to preserve Size, the quality stayed the same tho.
Since all 720p Bleach episodes are just Upscales of 480p Tvstreams"
