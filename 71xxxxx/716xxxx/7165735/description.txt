Linda James: London University Trained phonetician with over 20 years' experience in teaching Speech in London drama schools. She is also a trained actress and has worked extensively in both theatre and television, including BBC sitcoms such as "Only Fools and Horses", "Keeping Up Appearances" and may others. 
Olga Smith: from Nottingham University, UK. Olga was struggling with her English pronunciation because of her strong Russian accent for 10 years. Olga managed to neutralise her accent only thanks to lessons with Linda. Their work became a source for this book.

There are two volumes: the first one teaches you how to articulate vowels, consonantsΓÇª; like any other speech/phonetics manual actually, but very well done. The second one is for advanced learners -which would be the very very advanced in real life- and deals with glottal stops, liaisons, linking /r/, instrusive /r/, intonation, speed flow, among others.
