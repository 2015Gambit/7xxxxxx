,golfillo,2012-04-11T21:30Z,"I am very grateful for this, but is it absolutely necessary to upload the whole program each time when the 2 main cab files would suffice? - It doubles the size and seems such a waste of bandwidth."
,j.barreiro,2012-04-12T18:38Z,"Once you had install it. First Start ask about registration and you have only 29 days to use the program without activation.

Anyone who know how to ""register"" it ?

what should I do"
,_SnakEye,2012-04-20T17:24Z,"precursor1188, thanks man for the link.
I D/L the file however I don't know where to place the extracted files exactly.
the Folder structure in the Zip file does not match the folder structure of my Installation."
,precursor1188,2012-04-21T07:16Z,"Snakeeye, my folder structure is also not the same as the d/l file. I delete all folders under Enr. Copy db_a, db_b and enroute_notices there. Then slelect & copy all files in Termcharts to Ipad Termcharts. Override the older files. You can check that you have the latest by checking with Jeppesen site on updates eff from 5 apr."
,precursor1188,2012-04-21T07:25Z,"Snakeeye, I think nobody has found the way to place the enroute_notices pdf file in FD to have it viewed in FD. So no point copying them there. Instead you can copy to some pdf reader app. I use goodreader. I think iBook also can."
