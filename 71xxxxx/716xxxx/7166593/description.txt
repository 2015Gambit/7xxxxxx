Review

These ten singular compositions by Gregorio share one thing in common: a rare
ability to express astonishing collages of sound, interspersed with outstanding
individual improvisation, resulting in surprisingly accessible sounds that
baffle as they fully absorb the listener. In an incisive essay the composer
cites varieties of constructivism and concrete art as influences and wisely
eschews the self-expression of so much of free improvisation in favor of "...an
event that can be shared, enjoyed, and understood by others...." Nonetheless,
this is abstract music, where graphic scores, odd meters, and geometric
constructs play a central role. The unusual instrumentation of clarinet or alto
saxophone (Gregorio), plus vibraphone or marimba (Carrie Biolo), cello or cornet
(Fred Lonberg-Holm), and a couple of string basses on a handful of tracks
(Michael Cameron and Kent Kessler), combined with brilliant composing, leads
repeatedly to unexpected results. The influences of 20th century classical music
are felt throughout (one of the pieces is dedicated to Luigi Nono), but the
sounds span and incorporate several genres in highly original ways.
