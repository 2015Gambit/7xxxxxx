,LJE111,2012-08-26T01:30Z,"Not sure if anyone can help me here - but I can never view the files before downloading from TPB. I always could from Demonoid.  The DL window opens ok but the box at the bottom, where it is supposed to list all the files and sizes contained in the DL, is always empty. I thought it was a TPB glitch until I saw posters here say they only downloaded the 4th movie - meaning they could obviously see the files to select from the list that is supposed to populate the box at the bottom of the DL window. I have BTGuard running, if it matters, but Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;m not sure why it always populated when downloading a Demoniod torrent, but never with TPB. 

Any help you can offer this grandma would be so appreciated!

Thanks PetaFOX for the DL! :-)"
