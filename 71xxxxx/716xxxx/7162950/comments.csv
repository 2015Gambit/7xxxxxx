Please, please, please UL an episode or two of Endgames. I'm a chess fan and would like to see how that new show goes.

Thanks!"
,UncleO,2012-04-11T07:19Z,"oops. it's endgame, not endgames, which is why i didn't find it."
[T],dramacore,2012-04-13T23:16Z,"thanks for sharing these, i'm from the usa and find the canadian version of this show just as interesting as the version we get here."
