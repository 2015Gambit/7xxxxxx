The Stabilizers - Tyranny (1986) FLAC format ripped with Exact Audio Copy (log included)



The Stabilizers were an American pop/rock duo founded in the early 1980s by musicians Dave Christenson and Rich Nevens. With Christenson on lead vocals and Nevens on guitars and occasional keyboards, they spent the first few years touring the Pennsylvania area and recording original compositions on a 4-track recorder. Then, in 1985, they were signed to Columbia Records and in 1986, released Tyranny, their first and only album.

"One Simple Thing" was a huge radio hit, and is still a truly excellent track!

This is an original release CD that has been out of print for 15 years.  Another in my long list of collectable CDs that I will be upping over the next several weeks.
