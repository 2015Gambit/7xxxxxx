Your Sinclair Magazine Issues 01-94 (January 1986 - September 1993)

** Note: This is a rework of a previously released collection. The
** content is largely the same, but the image quality is much better.

Your Sinclair was the successor to Your Spectrum, and focussed on
entertainment more than it's predecessor. There's still a fair amount of
technical content though, especially in the early issues. Towards the
end of the magazine's life, it went straight for the "yoof" market, and
as the Spectrum declined so did the page count.

These PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on
www.worldofspectrum.org . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used (especially in later issues), and by
the relatively low DPI of the source images. Also, paragraph formatting
is a bit random at best; again, this is worse in the later issues. 

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please checkfor more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and to all the visitors and donators to
RetroPDFs.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
