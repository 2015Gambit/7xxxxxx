E02 was E01 and some guides like tvrage are wrong !!

as said before

hmm maybe some guides have it wrong like tvrage
as spike tv says ice cold is the first episode

many places calling e01 something else blood and money perhaps it got renamed or promo name
thats the confusion

as usual someone f-ups the naming and guides
everywhere LOL

=== so rename these to E02 and E03 !! and
my prev E02 to E01!"

[V],psspss,2012-04-07T11:08Z,"they are fake seeders.. which are known as antip2p-ers hired by hollywoody to cause wasted
data and drag out the seeding times

i guess its easy to pay an indian a 1 dollar a day
to be a p2p hackers and annoyance.. LOL

make sure your using peer guardian 2 and load
level one ips to block most of them

of course if your seed seeders not sharing 
add them to utorrents UPfilter.dat file

can save a bit of frustration"
