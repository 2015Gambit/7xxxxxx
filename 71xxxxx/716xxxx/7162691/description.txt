DeskSpace maps six virtual desktops to a cube and allows the user to switch between them, similar to the cube plugin for the Compiz and Beryl window managers for the X Window System in Linux. Deskspace is the first desktop manager to make the cube-style desktop feature available on Microsoft Windows.[citation needed] DeskSpace makes use of and requires DirectX 8.1 in contrast to most other virtual desktop managers that use OpenGL. It supports up to nine monitors.
