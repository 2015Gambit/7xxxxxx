,marko997,2012-04-13T02:58Z,"@Mamba4ever i also have the iPad 3 an tasted a music video in 720 & 1080 and in some scenes u can notice a little tiny iny difference but with the iPad at 5 in of the eyes. But the file size difference doesn't worth the extra space. I'll stick with 720, most of all cause i have the Apple TV2 (only 720)."

I agree with Marko997, in most cases, 720p & 1080p encodes are almost indistinguishable on the iPad 3. Despite it's resolution being higher than even 1080p, the iPad 3's scaler does superb work.

Now, a lot depends on the encode, and on the source material, but I think the best bang for your (bit) buck is with 720p encodes."
