,Byff,2012-04-09T14:19Z,"V=10
A=5, diminished & hollow sounding
Thanks for the upload."
,HamoDude,2012-04-12T05:36Z,"A = 9 / Not as crisp and treble like as a proper DVDRip...But still very clear to hear.

V = 9 / Dark areas of the film are slightly strengthened...does not ruin the movie AT ALL !!

M = 8 / He may not be fighting Mythical Gods...but Sam Worthington still kicks ass !

Thanks HeroMaster for the upload...and to the Seeders."
