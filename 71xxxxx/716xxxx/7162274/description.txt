I acquired this program through the popular JapanesePod101 online language course. The premium subscription comes with a 100% discount to any product from their store, and naturally I chose the most complete one:

This is a collection of 8 executable files, covering nine proficiency levels, from Beginner to Advanced, plus a bonus file with survival phrases:

Level 1 - Introduction
Level 2 - Absolute Beginner
Level 3 - Lower Beginner
Level 4 - Beginner
Level 5 - Upper Beginner
Level 6 - Lower Intermediate
Level 7 - Intermediate
Level 8 - Upper Intermediate
Level 9 - Advanced
Bonus   - Survival Phrases

Note that their shop does offer each of these as individual products; this is merely a collection of those ten courses, and is not integrated in any way. They offer this "complete" download as a multipart-part zip archive comprised of seven 600MB files (rather than ten independent zip files) and I had some trouble uncompressing them (not many archive managers support multi-part files in the format z01, z02, etc.), so I though I'd make it a more convenient download as a torrent. You're welcome :)


This program requires .NET 4 (get it from www.microsoft.com/net)
