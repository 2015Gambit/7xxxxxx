,waldyrious,2012-04-05T19:42Z,"I am preparing another upload with all the lessons in mp3 + lesson notes in pdf. It will take me a few days to get that organized, but it should be cross-platform and the download can be customized to the lesson level. Stay tuned!"
,rayquest9,2012-04-05T21:39Z,thanks pls can u upload ARABIC COMPLETE 
,callysebers,2012-04-29T09:17Z,eta on mp3s?
,waldyrious,2012-05-09T09:39Z,"@callysebers yes! Actually the collection is practically ready, but I didn't have time to complete the scraping of the accompanying PDFs before my 1-month premium subscription ended, so I had to re-subscribe for another month in order to have access to the materials.

I now have everything on disk and have performed a huge amount of cleanup (you won't believe how messed up the files are, with inconsistent filenames, wrong filenames in some cases, breaks in numbering, incorrect MP3 tags, etc.)

Right now the only thing holding the release of a torrent is that since I now have another whole month of premium subscription anyway, I thought I might as well include the new lessons that are released until the end of my premium subscription, so that the incomplete folders would be less incomplete. I'm doing this because, naturally, I can't update the torrent to add new files once I release it.

But if you guys would prefer a release now (maybe discarding the ongoing seasons, to make it a self-contained release), I can do that. Everything else is ready. Let me know."
,Petersen1982,2012-06-06T16:15Z,"
Not wanting to give you too much of a hurry along, but how is your collection of mp3s going?
I've been quietly lurking in the dark waiting for your torrent, and I thought I'd let you know that there are definitely a few of us out here that would greatly appreciate your efforts.
Thanks!

,waldyrious,2012-06-06T22:40Z,"@Petersen1982, thanks for the interest. There are four ongoing seasons, and only 12 of the 25 lessons on each have been released so far. I guess I'll never be able to complete these seasons without subscribing for yet another month, so I might as well upload the torrent as a snapshot, with the incomplete folders.

I will do this now and post the link afterwards as in new comment."
,Douglasrs,2012-06-06T23:00Z,"I'm looking forward for the mp3s too.
Thanks."
,waldyrious,2012-06-07T12:50Z,"Hi guys. I have the torrent ready and am seeding it, but for some reason I can't upload it to TPB. I keep getting server errors (various php/mysql errors are displayed when I try to upload). I'm trying to leave here a link to the torrent file on my dropbox but I also get database errors when trying to save the comment. Maybe there's something wrong in the link sanitizing code or something?"
,waldyrious,2012-06-07T12:54Z,"Definitely sounds like a link problem. let me try:

,waldyrious,2012-06-07T12:56Z,"Ok, I don't know exactly what the problem is. I've tried multiple combinations and only the one above worked. Sorry about that.

Note that in some clients it might be necessary to edit the tracker list, because I forgot to add newlines between the tracker urls, and now I'm afraid regenerating it would maybe change the torrent hash or something. but it's no big deal anyway.

I'll try to upload it to TPB without any links in the description. Hopefully it will work..."
,waldyrious,2012-06-07T13:00Z,"Nope, even without links in the description, attempting to upload still gives me server errors. Is anyone aware of whether this is a known issue being worked on?"
,Petersen1982,2012-06-07T15:35Z,"I don't know either, I tried to upload it and it gave me errors too.
Maybe try again tomorrow....

Either way, it's coming down now, thanks so much for all of your effort, there's a shit-ton of good stuff here!

よろしくお願いします！"
,waldyrious,2012-06-07T18:01Z,"I think I figured what the problem is: the torrent file is over 200k, and there are more than 1000 files, which seems to trigger the problem described here: https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=67290

Maybe I'll try compressing the files then, generating one archive per lesson/season. I don't like that but it seems to be the only way to have this in a single torrent. Besides, it will still be possible to download the levels separately."

,waldyrious,2012-06-10T16:53Z,"FYI: I'm removing the torrent file from dropbox (linked above). I recommend anyone wanting to download the torrent to use the new version, linked in my previous comment, which can actually be added to trackers (and already has been)."
