Mr. Schneier is a vocal critic of "security measures" used by the Transportation Security Administration. He was invited to testify before Congress about TSA abuses but was "formally uninvited" after the TSA complained. He is the author of numerous books, including Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive, Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World, and Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World.. Alex also covers the latest news and takes your calls.
