Now, you might be concerned that the developers milked the title and merely reskinned the first game or recycled scenes. IΓÇÖm happy to report that that isnΓÇÖt the case. It appears a conscious and concerted effort was made to get us out of the proverbial house. I know I breathed a sigh of relief when I clicked the first door and read: ΓÇ£As soon as I even think about a door, it disappears.ΓÇ¥

The narrative hinges on the unexpected arrival of a supernatural organ to the House of 1000 Doors. Soon fireballs attack the Lancasters and their residence, and they stem from the Palm of Zoroaster. Only a song played on the organ made from Jericho pipes will destroy this demon-infused fire gem, and we are tasked with traveling around the world (Tibet, India, Jerusalem, and Madagascar) and through time via portrait portals to collect the magical skulls that activate the organ. The final and ultimate objective is to find the Palm of Zoroaster and place it in the organ.
