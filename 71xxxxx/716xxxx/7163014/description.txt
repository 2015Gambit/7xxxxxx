Lyrics:

Words don't come easy
Without a melody
I'm always thinking
In terms of do-re-mi
I should be hiking, swimming
Laughing with you
Instead, I'm all out of tune

But what you don't know
You lift me off of the ground
You're inspiration
You helped me find my sound
Just like a baseline in half-time
You hold down the groove
That's why I'm counting on you

And if I heard you on the radio
I'd never want to change a single note
It's what I'm trying say all along
You're my favorite song

I'm in a session, writing tracks
You got another class to teach
And then rehearsal with the band
You're always one step out of reach
I'm looking for some harmony with you
It comes so naturally
You help me find the right key

And when I hear you on the radio
I never want to change a single note
It's what I tried say all along
You're my favorite song
My favorite song

And when I hear you on the radio
I never want to change a single note
It's what I tried say all along
You're my favorite song
You're my favorite song
