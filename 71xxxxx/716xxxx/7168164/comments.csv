You have created a torrent without any music files in it.
First you need to rip the music from the CD, then you need to convert the audio files to MP3 format.
Then you test play them to make sure they are OK.

When that is done, then you can create a torrent. 

And you should NOT create .torrent files with other .torrent files in them."
