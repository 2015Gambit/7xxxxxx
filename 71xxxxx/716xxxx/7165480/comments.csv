,Breayuhn,2012-04-20T20:49Z,"Extracting now :D It's extracting awfully slow though (400kb/s, saying its gonna take 7/8 hours), any reason for this? D:"
,MaddieTheHijabi,2012-04-28T11:34Z,"Hi, I love the torrent! However...I can't figure out how to install it so I can use it in FL studio. I tried following a couple of youtube tutorials...no luck. Can you tell me? I appreciate it. Thanks"
,Falcito,2012-04-29T02:12Z,"Hi im the torrent uploader first at all update your ivoy vst plugin at this link is 1mb only 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7170548/Synthogy_Ivory__VST_update_1.64_lite

So by default your vst plugins are installed C:Program FilesVST

Just look at that folder in fl studio and open it"
,MaddieTheHijabi,2012-04-30T14:21Z,Oh thank you so much!!! 
,MaddieTheHijabi,2012-05-10T12:39Z,Please help me with the expiration problem!!
,Falcito,2012-05-12T01:28Z,"Here another key generator

http://k003.kiwi6.com/hotlink/7m928jb206/keygen.exe

Activate ivory "
,MaddieTheHijabi,2012-05-18T19:57Z,I tried it but it wouldn't open. It said it wasn't compatible. I tried different compatibility modes but still wouldn't open. 
,MaddieTheHijabi,2012-05-21T23:57Z,might be because im 64 bit?
,Falcito,2012-05-22T03:50Z,"Remember the ivory folder must be placed in your c drive C:Synthogy Ivory 1.50

I have some good feedback from 64 bits users, just fallow the read me file step by step"
,folcadoir,2012-06-09T10:58Z,"Thanks Falcito!!

Works fine in Windows 7 64bit. Make sure to run it as administrator otherwise it can't access the library.

If you're using it as a VST in Ableton Live, you have to run Ableton as administrator also, EVEN if you have updated with the 1.64 pstch in the comments. 

Going to test it our for a few weeks and if I like it, I'll buy it. You should too!"
,suciop,2012-06-28T03:01Z,"Falcito,

Thanks for the download.  I can't seem to work the program. I installed just as the readme document said to.  Please let me know what needs to be done.  thanks!"
,mjaow,2012-07-12T08:45Z,"Hi, somehow the program is saying that the grace period has expired, although I've activated it. 

Activate is also telling me that its authorized to run on the system, whats up?"
,GSP4ever,2012-07-15T08:43Z,"I am having the same problem as 'mjaow'.

Ivory keeps telling me that the grace period has expired, even though I have authorized it multiple times with the 'Authorize Ivory' and 'DYNAMiCS_Ivory_1.5_KeyGen' programs...

it's not resetting the expiry date."
,MaddieTheHijabi,2012-08-05T22:49Z,Yep same problem still persists...I guess I'll have to re-compose my songs on FL studio..
,lovemagic,2012-08-06T07:08Z,I could not extract keygen.exe! Everything else was extracted except this file. Please help!
