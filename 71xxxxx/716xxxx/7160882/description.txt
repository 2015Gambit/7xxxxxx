This hotly anticipated solo debut will surprise some people expecting more of the slightly hippy folk and funk influences that were evident on the two Duke and the King releases. Simone FeliceΓÇÖs career has seen him move on from the Band influenced ramshackle clatter of the Felice Brothers to the smoother and sunnier Duke and the King to this current presentation where he appears as if reborn into a more austere and starker world.
