Plot:With his unique brand of youthful storytelling, Donald Glover brings down the house in his hysterical stand-up special Weirdo. Filmed at the Union Square Theatre in New York City, Glover invites the audience into his life, sharing everything from childhood tales about his unrequited love for Cocoa Puffs and trips to Home Depot, to observations on ΓÇÿgetting famousΓÇÖ, relationships, the N word and why kids are awful people. Smart and hip with a fresh approach to comedy, Glover presents a solid hour of his hilariously original, wisecracking humor.
