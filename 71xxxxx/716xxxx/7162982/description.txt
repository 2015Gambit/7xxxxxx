Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, April 5 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with John Perkins, author of the New York Times bestseller Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. Perkins spent the 1970s working as an economic planner for an international consulting firm. In his book he describes how the globalists force the economic hegemony of the banksters, the IMF and World Bank on victim nations in the third world. "Economic hit men are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars," Perkins writes. He is also the author of The Secret History of the American Empire: The Truth About Economic Hit Men, Jackals, and How to Change the World and Hoodwinked: An Economic Hit Man Reveals Why the World Financial Markets Imploded -- and What We Need to Do to Remake Them. 

Alex also talks withjournalist and editor Patrick Henningsen about U.S. soldiers trafficking arms and drugs to DEA agents posing as Los Zetas.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
