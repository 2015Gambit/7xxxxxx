,shadowsmirk,2012-05-21T05:17Z,"in the name of all that is holy (and unholy), make sure you know what Rifftrax is before downloading.
That being said, thanks to the uploader! "
,GeneralTso92,2012-06-18T21:35Z,"If this is just the audio, shouldn't it not be in the Video section?"
,sarum114,2012-07-03T09:05Z,"Thanks for this wonderful upload! Rifftrax is great!!

Anyone know where to find Order of the Phoenix (Rifftrax) on PB?? "

Order of the Phoenix can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7459665/RiffTrax_-_Harry_Potter_Order_of_the_Phoenix_-_dual_audio_.mp4 I thought it had already been uploaded so only now put it up..."
,Ninja9989,2012-09-16T17:00Z,"Don't worry guys, I'll help to seed! (also, for all the noobs complaining that there's comments in the move, DUH! That's exactly the point of a rifftrax!) If you guys came here looking for the original movies, simply search up Harry Potter in the pirate search, and click on one that looks good! (that ISN'T a rifftrax) Oh and thanks to uploader for the nice riff!"
