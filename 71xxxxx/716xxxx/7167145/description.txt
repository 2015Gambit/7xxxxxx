Drake And Rihanna's 'Take Care' Video: Frozen Planet.

The video hit the web last night(April 6)and sees the couple embracing each ohter in the black and white shot footage,Directed by Yoann Lemoine - who has Katy Perry
"Teenage Dream" & Mystery Jet "Dreaming of Another World" in his list of directing 
credits. Lemoine told MTV that "There's a lot of space in the video and i wanted the visuals to pay tribute to that.It pays tribute to nature. When i listened to the track, I was seeing a landscape.involving animals and massive landscapes." It exudes both an incredible level of restraint and an over-the-top amount of pomp.
It is very serious,very cold,very pained. Nothing much really  happens, but at its its conclusion, You'll feel like you've been through an awful lot. 


Last Month, Drake admitted that he uses Drugs to cope with the pressure of Fame.
