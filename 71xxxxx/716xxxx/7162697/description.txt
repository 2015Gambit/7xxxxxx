Linux Mint 12 comes with a brand new desktop, built with Gnome 3 and MGSE.

"MGSE" (Mint Gnome Shell Extensions) is a desktop layer on top of Gnome 3 that makes it possible for you to use Gnome 3 in a traditional way. You can disable all components within MGSE to get a pure Gnome 3 experience, or you can enable all of them to get a Gnome 3 desktop that is similar to what youΓÇÖve been using before. Of course you can also pick and only enable the components you like to design your own desktop.

The main features in MGSE are:

    The bottom panel
    The application menu
    The window list
    A task-centric desktop (i.e. you switch between windows, not applications)
    Visible system tray icons
