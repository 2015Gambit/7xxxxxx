,sage1210,2012-04-07T18:21Z,"pointless to update this game.
in the end you can meet the three of true ending by only collect more army points in multi-players mode.

with out additional points from multi-players, the best you can do is just bad ending.

yeb, your hero will die even you do best. 

trust me. i did every things and gain every single points but it still can't pass the bad end. "
,Pirat47,2012-04-08T10:43Z,"Please, explain what this update brings about. Is it a patch only or a DLC?"
,AznAssassin,2012-04-09T03:25Z,"There's really no point in updating the game since:
1). The game had very few mission-breaking glitches and thus its virtually
2). Does not add anything new: Does NOT fix the stupid journal, no performance boosts (tho why would u need one?), no changes to missions/gameplay
3). The patch does not contain the Extended Cut DLC
4). It might fck up the DLC crack and Readiness Rating crack. 

The game is good as it is. Wait for the Extended Cut DLC and/or any further DLC packs. "
