,geeteebee,2012-04-06T05:46Z,Thanks for the U/L.  As usual I appreciate your efforts whmxtra.  What do you think?  This is not as good as the original.  Just my opinion.
,ShadsinOz,2012-04-06T05:50Z,"Seems to be dying after about 9-10 mins. :-(

The other half is getting cranky with me for not being able to download it lol"
,Stinky86,2012-04-06T06:22Z,I'm only getting play up to around 10 minutes.  Has anyone else gotten this to play through?  It says it has 45 minutes of video...  :(
,blilmot,2012-04-06T08:03Z,"yes shadsinoz and stinky86 thats what im getting
"
,whmxtra,2012-04-06T08:14Z,"Crap, *mental note* never use vids from firststop. Sorry about that guys, the video is corrupted or something, dies after 11 minutes or so.

Gimme a bit let me see if my own sources have a version up yet.

@ geeteebee haven't watched it (wouldn't have uploaded had I realised it was corrupt). I just blipped through the first few minutes to make sure it would run, didn't realise it craps out after 11 minutes or so lol. But I doubt it will live up to the original, there's no replacement for Abby :P"
,ShadsinOz,2012-04-06T10:45Z,"Thanks whmxtra, these things happen, thank you for trying!  If you could get another version up here that would be awesome.

Thanks heaps for the effort."
,blilmot,2012-04-06T13:34Z,"Thanks everyone glad it wasn't just me .
  and i agree if Aby isn't in it it just wont be the same lol"
