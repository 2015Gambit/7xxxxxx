Microsoft Office 2010 Toolkit v2.3.1.0 Beta
This is a set of tools and functions for managing licensing, deploying, and activating Office 2010. All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as this could conflict or damage Office 2010. The Channel Switcher, AutoKMS Uninstaller, AutoRearm Uninstaller, Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Office 2010 is not installed. For information about individual functions. To read further Click The Readme Button in Office 2010 Toolkit program, and Copy Button to copy the tabbed section contents.

Requirements:
- Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5
- Office 2010 for Office Support
- Windows NT 6 era operating system (Vista or later) for Windows Support

Microsoft Toolkit Changelog:
