This is a custom collection of music from the hit TV show Glee.
[ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327801/ ]

This is my first ever upload, but, since I couldn't find these songs elsewhere (and being a Brittana 'shipper), I felt I should put them up. I've used the original versions of these songs (though there's a better version of Monster Mash out there on a special collection I have on vinyl).

This list is revealed in the episode "3x13: Heart" ans is the list of songs that repeat in Brittany's head when she is with, or thinks of, Santana LÃ³pez.
