From the Infowars web site:

On the Tuesday, April 3 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts head-on the ongoing effort by the global elite to take down the Constitution. Obama directly criticized the Constitution on Monday as part of an orchestrated push to legitimize his unconstitutional Obamacare agenda. Minions of the global elite are now coming out of the woodwork in an effort to neuter the Second Amendment under cover of the inflammatory Trayvon Martin case.
