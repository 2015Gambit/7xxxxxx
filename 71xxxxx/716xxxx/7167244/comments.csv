,haZPT,2012-04-07T18:42Z,probably fake. I've downloaded a torrent named American Pie Reunion 2012 DVDSCR LINE XviD-playXD and it askes for a PW. This torrent doesn't exist anymore. I guess we'll have to wait.

,sekt03,2012-04-07T19:37Z,"I tried to download this torrent 2 times now, using the 3.1.2 utorrent and my client crashes.."
,mikiqex,2012-04-07T20:08Z,"It's NOT FAKE, but some parts (and maybe punchlines) are missing, few times plays ""We Will Rock You"" over the movie, so you can't hear anything from the movie. It's watchable as CAM though, but I don't recommend this because of missing parts."
,Zer0C001,2012-04-07T20:30Z,"There seem to be parts of the movie cut off, also the movie audio is interrupted a few times by music for what seems 20 minutes total ( not that i didn't like the music more than i did the movie ).
Still it's nice to know that, unlike the previous american pie movies, this one is not worth more than $0.10 for the DVD release."
,GrandMstrBud,2012-04-07T21:48Z,"Stupid, parts are cut out and some Queen music keeps coming on. Lame ass release that's for sure"
,Delsa,2012-04-07T22:35Z,"Don't recommend download as the movie is chopped together along with ""Queen - We are the champions"" blaring in throughout the movie"
,ehookah81,2012-04-07T22:51Z,What the hells up with the Queen music?? Bout as gay as playin that shit throughout the movie as gay as the lead singer is! Flame on queers! 
,SashaX,2012-04-08T00:12Z,"This is decent audio and visual quality for a cam rip, thanks!!

Downsides
-Roughly 28 minutes cut out
-Queen music inexplicably cuts in to several scenes
-Cam Quality

Pros
-In English (as opposed to all of the other American Reunion uploads right now)
-Decent Cam Rip
-You can still follow the movie even with the missing/cut short scenes
-Better quality rips will follow, this is the best you're going to get at this moment

Thanks for the upload!! :)"
,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T00:29Z,"Hi, i was going to explain to ya all why the movie is shorter than the retail one. But, it seems that the movie is acually shorter. Anyway, when you watch the real movie it's shown in 24 FPS (23.976 FPS) but when you watch it in the cinema it's played in 25 FPS. So i made a calculation out of it as you can see below.

Real Playtime: 6780 sec (24 FPS)
TS Playtime: 5416 sec (25 FPS)
CAM Playtime: 5101 sec (25 FPS)

Multiplier: 0.96 (1/25 = 0.04 | 1 - 0.04 =0.96)

Calculation: 6780*0.96 = 6508,8 sec

25 FPS Playtime: 6508,8 sec - Credits = (5416 sec || 5101 sec) ???

I belive that this is a correct calculation that removes 1 second every 25th second. However this means that the movie credits must be either 18 mins or 23 mins. In this case 23 mins cus this is the CAM version. And i don't believe that the credits is 23 mins. So why is the movie shorter than it's supposed to be?"

It's easy to critic something ! Sorry guys, we can't have it all !"
,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T01:07Z,"maximersk, read my comment above. Why is it shorter?"

,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T02:23Z,"I don't hate you. Anyway, you don't know cus you didn't record this right?"
,RaveHippie,2012-04-08T05:13Z,crap... the queen music is over so much it sucks... the last couple minutes r still in russian... and the sceens jump so its probably missing sceens
,RaveHippie,2012-04-08T05:15Z,crap... the queen music is over a ton of sceens... there is sceens missing or its just really glitchy... and the last min or so is still in russian
,Backius,2012-04-08T07:38Z,"*******READ BEFORE DOWNLOAD*****
Ok appreciated to this uploader but i would highly recomend waiting for a better version, every 5 mins ''queen songs'' come on via audio u cant hear the film and miss possibly some of what would be the best punchlines, a shame the person who did the video was a jackass. this version is on several sites streaming and torrent but thumbs up to (MAXIMERSK) for donating bandwidth to share  still a hilarious movie, but i wil be downloading a better version"
,KimmyK028,2012-04-08T10:18Z,please seed!!! download is stuck

You're new (on Pirate Bay) ? I understand you, my friend ! I download Tv Shows everyday (Encoded by DIMENSION, IMMERSE, COMPULSION, CTU...)
and nobody knows who are they ! Me too, I want to know, dude ! hee hee
To answer your question, yes it's probably QUATERPAST ! Maybe, he's alone or his a group...  I think is a group guys ! hee hee
All people who uploads torrents are only uploader (this is not their files)

Me, I upload my own torrents (my owns files) like The Big Bang Theory S05E20 720p HDTV ReEnc-[maximersk] 

So... you can't know it ! the one who created the file knows ! "

,misterp21,2012-04-13T23:47Z,"""We are champions and i love rock n roll""? Like seriously. WTF?!!!!!! That ruined the whole movie. Plus scenes kept skipping a few seconds ahead after them songs would play. This is the worst bootleg I ever seen in my life"
