Deep Cuts, Volume 3 (1984ΓÇô1995) is a compilation of Queen featuring some of their lesser-known tracks between 1984 and 1995. The album was released on September 5, 2011 as part of Queen's 40th Anniversary. Deep Cuts Volume 3 was released simultaneously as the third five reissues of the Queen studio albums (The Works, A Kind of Magic, The Miracle, Innuendo and Made in Heaven) from which the songs are sampled. In this release, "Khashoggi's Ship" has a drum intro (to separate it from the song "Party", which was not included in this compilation) and "It's a Beautiful Day (Reprise)" starts with 15 seconds of silence and ends with "Yeah" (which is a separate track in Made in Heaven).
