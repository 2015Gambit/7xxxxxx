,KilerG,2012-04-10T04:13Z,"Something I've noticed about these videos, why are they all 320x240? Standard Definition is 720x480, is this some sort of hardware or software issue?"
,JihadJake,2012-04-10T17:13Z,lol I have no idea. Its probbaly from the torrent i get it from on Demonoid
,KilerG,2012-04-18T04:17Z,Why haven't we seen any new episodes in the past two weeks?
,JihadJake,2012-04-21T19:24Z,sorry. The guy who I have been getting them from on demonoid said whoever he is getting them from isnt posting any more. I will keep looking and put new episodes when I can
,TheWalkingDad,2012-04-23T23:08Z,I'm uploading the next three episodes since I couldn't find them anywhere myself. I got them from iTunes and I'll share here.
,KilerG,2012-04-25T18:00Z,"Thanks for offering to upload, I haven't been able to see any new episodes because they only show at like 5AM and 8PM on saturday in my area...If they showed at like 9-11AM I'd be able to see them because saturday's are my only real day of getting things done. And I don't have iTunes anymore lol."
,TheWalkingDad,2012-04-26T11:08Z,"I can't find a shareware program for Mac that will remove DRM, so it looks like my files won't be any good to anyone."
,JihadJake,2012-04-27T05:03Z,"thanks for the effort TheWalkingDad.

Please if anyone else has the new episodes upload them or share the link to where it can be found"
,KilerG,2012-05-13T10:43Z,Damn you Apple and your DRM protection! Does anyone know how to remove DRM protection?! 
,foryouall,2012-05-22T09:26Z,"Some guys over on /co/, I believe, put together a download of all 10 episodes plus a rar with the show's songs on mediafire.
