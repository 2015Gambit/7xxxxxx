I've noticed that there's a lot of hitting and running going on with these discography torrents I've been sharing here on The Pirate Bay.  Where the downloader disappears once the torrent is snatched.  Yet, in contrast, all of my "The Year In Christian Music" torrents have good seeding support.  That said, I don't have the bandwidth or hard drive space to continue to support a torrent once it's fully seeded here.  I don't ask for much, and perhaps I shouldn't expect anything at all, but if you're downloading any of my torrents, (1) please consider sharing back what myself and others have kindly shared with you, and (2) please be blessed by the music, and allow others the opportunity to also be blessed by sharing it with them.
