,felmn,2012-04-11T21:01Z,"It works great, don't worry. Anybody having issues with this has the IQ of a doorknob."
,hordex52,2012-04-12T03:30Z,@felmn thanks it just feels better when people comment and also thanks for your comment so others know its not some sorta virus cause i get suspicious if no one comments for other downloads
,hordex52,2012-04-12T05:23Z,"And i will actually tell you how to mod this too
Go to
C:/Program File (x86)/facade/util/sources/facade/textures

Now just open one of the pictures and edit it or completely place a new photo there just save it in the same format (should be .bmp) and under the same name and ingame the item will look as you made it (i will not fix if you want the original items back though , just reinstall it)"
,ElectricNights,2012-04-14T23:10Z,"I can't get it to work properly. I get the loading window with the red curtains and after that I only get audio and a system message that says that the cumputer had to change the color scheme to Windows 7 basic. 

I dunno... Can anyone help me? "
,hordex52,2012-04-15T05:50Z,"@ElectricNights ok so that is how the game loads, it's more of an intro of why your character is going to the couples house. You can skip it by pressing space (maybe any key I'm actually not sure). on the note about the Windows Basic this game is actually pretty old that the program doesn't run well with Windows 7 Aero it does annoy me but you get used to it"
,ElectricNights,2012-04-15T17:19Z,@Hordex52 I meant that after the game has finished loading the games' video stops but the audio continues. I can interact with the couple and move around (I think) although I can't see anything other than a white/black screen.
,hordex52,2012-04-16T00:29Z,@ElectricNights ..... that is very strange all i could think of is your Ram may not be handling it correctly or the audio decompression/whole download may of messed up so un install and re install it
,ElectricNights,2012-04-18T22:35Z,"@hordex52 alright thanks for the help, I'll give it another go."
,ElectricNights,2012-04-22T12:27Z,@Hordex52 Seems like my computer was the problem. Thanks for the help :)

,Kristy18,2012-07-27T02:21Z,"Hello!

,hordex52,2012-07-29T02:17Z,"@Kristy, Hi well I have never gotten an error with this. I don't really know any ways to solve it besides uninstalling it and re-installing it."
,densus88,2012-08-28T06:58Z,"it not working,i tried to install it and it say ""this installer database contains the logic and data required to install .has stopped working,could anyone help me???,i really want to play this game!!!"
