Torrent contains the complete Japanese Basic I and II series, as well as NHK Japanese episodes for 83 episodes in total.

This torrent was originally created back in 2002/2003, so all of the files are fairly heavily-compressed DIVX versions.

The original episode material is from the 80s, so the cheese-factor is pretty high, however the information is still completely accurate so it's great for a student who wishes to learn the language and get some training from native speakers.
