Metal fabricator Jessi Combs hosts this automotive, how-to build show. 
In each 30-minute episode she and the girls work on two different vehicles, 
including: a 1971 Chevelle that was hacked for the track but must be prepared 
for the road; a barn find that the girls identify as a 1969 Z28 Camaro; 
a wrecked 2008 Suzuki Hayabusa that the girls get back on the road; 
and a 2002 BMW that is idling rough. Plus, Jessi provides welding tips and 
hints that any girl -- or guy -- can use in her home garage.
