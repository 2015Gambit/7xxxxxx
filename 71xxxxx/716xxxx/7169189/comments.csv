,Captain_Quizno,2012-05-18T19:51Z,"So iv been backround downloading and im seeing lots of comments on torrents that work perfectly... what seems to be happening to these comments are people having problems because of mis-installations, improper understanding of how to properly mount and run programs. I use Daemon tools and i have for everything. This program was slow on the start up but it worked perfectly, no skips no error messages, nothing. I run Windows 7 64bit. GOOD DOWNLOAD, PERFECT INSTALL, NO PROBLEMS"

Install all the games with the serials listed here & then do all the update patches from above.

Make sure you copy the serial numbers in the nfo posted here.

You will have to enter the Warchiefs serial a second time the first time you play it.

I installed the games using 3 iso's. There is also a GOLD Edition ISO. Both will take the above update patches & then run without a CD. I did not try using the Setup File here although it downloaded just fine."
,mesak,2012-07-01T09:53Z,"Hi, 

every time I start it asks for Serial. Also I can not see expansion packs anywhere. other than this, game works fine. any ideas how to fix problem with serial comming up every time?"
,johnalex10,2012-07-30T19:05Z,"To everyone asking if you can play online or patch from an online source; the answer is no. The serials are being re-used, and with non original serial keys or a crack program it will not verify the connection and might even require you to re-install the game to play properly. DO NOT TRY TO PLAY OR PATCH FROM THE OFFICIAL SITE! If you want to patch it USE A TORRENT!"
