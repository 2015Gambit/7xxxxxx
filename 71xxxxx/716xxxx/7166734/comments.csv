Oh, and to keep things on the same level so you could understand: fuck off you piece of shit idiot CUNT troll (sorry, it's all I could come up with).

Or hooking your stupid laptop to your plasma SHIT! I guest your parents won’t let you use the Home Theater yet LOL!!! There are Blu-Ray players that can play these files by USB or Blu-ray Discs…. JUST SO YOU KNOW MORRAN!!!"

This is in 10-bit X264 encode which is by far more superior than a ordinary 8-bit X264 encode which we commonly see scattered here in TPB, you just need to update your CCCP or just download MPCHC x64 as your player.

I downloaded Game Of Thrones Season 1 by ESIR in 10-bit and is the most superior quality I've ever seen here in TPB from its size vs quality ratio."
