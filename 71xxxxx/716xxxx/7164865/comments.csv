[T],dekeisha,2012-04-09T21:03Z,"THANKS.a brilliant piece of audio software,I tried it on my system which is a 32-bit os with just 1gb of ddr2 ram,processor 1.8 gigahertz, together with srs audio sandbox and it was awesome it cleared up the sound making a big difference from what i'm usually accustom to hearing on my pc.thanks nice one.+1"
,lif3isfr33,2012-05-18T08:43Z,Umm its an OK program.. but I don't like it a lot because it makes these cracks and popping noises when I raise the volume.. the sound gets distorted. Also sometimes it seems to lag my audio.. I would listen to music skip tracks and I would hear track 2 when I select track 3.. big lag.. but sometimes it will play fine.. this program is average not worth anyones time. 
,lif3isfr33,2012-05-18T23:13Z,"UPDATE: upon using it for a while cause it was pretty neat, it has officially blew out my laptop speakers. Well thats what I get for trying new stuff esp. on audio.. I suppose this program boosted the vol. too much it fucked up my speakers. I think it would suite a professional speaker system like a home theater but don't use it for small-medium speakers it will destroy it. Learned my lesson :("

It is the only way I have found to give sound enhancements to my hdmi audio output when outputting to hd lcd tv and then from tv to surroundsound. Windows only allows stereo config in this situation but with this program, no worries. Thanks a lot for this bro you are a legend."
