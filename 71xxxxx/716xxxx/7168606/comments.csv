,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T10:12Z,"Hi, i was going to explain to ya all why the movie is shorter than the retail one. But, it seems that the movie is acually shorter. Anyway, when you watch the real movie it's shown in 24 FPS (23.976 FPS) but when you watch it in the cinema it's played in 25 FPS. So i made a calculation out of it as you can see below.

NOTE: The runtime of this movie is not 1h 25mn it's 1h 30mn.

Real Playtime: 6780 sec (24 FPS)
TS Playtime: 5416 sec (25 FPS)
CAM Playtime: 5101 sec (25 FPS)

Multiplier: 0.96 (1/25 = 0.04 | 1 - 0.04 =0.96)

Calculation: 6780*0.96 = 6508,8 sec

25 FPS Playtime: 6508,8 sec - Credits = (5416 sec || 5101 sec) ???

I belive that this is a correct calculation that removes 1 second every 25th second. However this means that the movie credits must be either 18 mins or 23 mins. In this case 18 mins cus this is the TS version. And i don't believe that the credits is 18 mins. So why is the movie shorter than it's supposed to be? And how is this a new source when it is exactly the same length as the other TS versions?"
,mikiqex,2012-04-08T13:58Z,"HolyDuFF2: Your calculations may be interresting, but I actually watched it and some parts are really missing, sometimes the cut is in the middle of a dialogue, minute or two are missing and the movie immediately continues in the middle of the next scene. In second part the gang is talking on the hallway waiting for the four one to show up, CUT, all four are sitting on couch chatting. Don't tell me this is legit! :)"

,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T15:41Z,"simon200, i'm not trying to look smart, i'm trying to prove a point. And to find out why it's shorter and if it's because that it's cut or something and why that is. And what link are you talking about?"
