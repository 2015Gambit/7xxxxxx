,Xtra-x,2012-04-10T20:06Z,"It is not episode 401, it is episode 1 of season 4. The typical method for naming is 401 or S4E01.

Cheers to the work of his uploader, as I can't personally can't find a way to edit/split mkv files with any of the programs I have used. Any help would be appreciated."

1280x720 resolution too!"
,SecondVelocity,2012-05-05T22:16Z,"Season 3 ain't working for me, anyone else?"
,kristiangl,2012-05-14T15:30Z,"Great! Every Episode is perfect!

Any chance you could continue uploading season 4 as it airs? The ones currently available aren't good quality."
,alucard15,2012-05-17T09:29Z,i been hearing a lot about this show and now i found this torrent! thanks i'll be seeding until i get to 300%
,Xeokym,2012-05-23T09:20Z,uuuuugh...I hate mkv files. And almost 13 gigs?! jesus christ
,univ_code,2012-07-14T14:30Z,"@Xeokym

Some of us enjoy quality. Download the SD version instead and quit whining. "
,Kyle2011anon,2012-07-27T00:00Z,"Everything in MKV. I understand people enjoy quality but you can get the same quality in MP4 without being restricted to a single media player. I already have 1-3 on MP4 all in 720p and all play awesome on my PS3 I just want a good version of Incendium in MP4 is all.

Oh well. I'll wait cause if season 1-3 can all be in MP4 and in 720p then so can Season 4 it might just take awhile. I'll go check out Demonoid."
