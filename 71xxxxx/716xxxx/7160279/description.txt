Kids, if you don't stand, and unviolently war to save yourselves, your future is over. We older ones are too sick to save you.  But you can do it, without question, you can save yourselves, and we older ones at the same time.

In Truth, you young ones are the most powerful group on Earth.  Objectively.  If you devote yourselves to really understanding what's being done to you, and stand with the disciplined, unrighteious rage to which you are entitled, placing your bodies, no one elses, in harms way.  You will win.  You will win in time.

But if you younger ones don't do it, now, your future is Hell.  

These younger ones are beginning to try, and beginning to figure out how.  No one knows how.  But without question, if you see that your entire future is being decided right now, and if you dive in, you WILL figure it out, and you WILL win.
