Maybe, the science behind the topic escapes you?"
,omnichao,2012-04-07T09:22Z,"This rant comes off sounding like essentially the same BS they exposed in the documentary Jesus Camp and in general like the ravings of of any religious zealot. 

Worse yet is the attempt to induce children, who lack the experience, wisdom, information and ability to fully reason, to take up the mantle of your own personal (and woefully ill informed) crusade. I wonder if these are the tactics that KONY uses?

Ironically it is far too often that enviro-windbags will decry 'corporate exploitation' of children via the use of marketing and advertising of products, but have no compunction about doing the same in the name of environmental causes. Not to be outdone though, they will up the ante and bring their children to rally's, protests, demonstrations and the like.
