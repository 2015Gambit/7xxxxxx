,theeccentrik,2012-04-08T10:22Z,"Is this a dvdrip or R5 like the others, b'cos it's strange only 1 uploader has it as the others normally all copy/reupload it like mad?
I'll leave it thanks."
,spifkitten99,2012-04-08T14:26Z,"Put a proper fucking title, so people knows it's Russian without having to click on it."
,projectxsmoke,2012-04-08T18:41Z,"@spifkitten99 

grow up you fukin prick ! have you uploaded anything no 

suck my balls you fuktard "
,lattari,2012-04-11T15:02Z,@spifkitten99 You poor man were you inconvenienced? You should report the uploader to the staff. You clicked in vain. If that constitutes a problem for you than you should be very grateful. I hope the rest of your life goes as smoothly as it has so far.
,wishpalfrey,2012-04-17T13:53Z,"THIS IS A GREAT MOVE, good quality  .thanks Maxrus "
,wishpalfrey,2012-04-17T13:59Z,sorry don't know the quality commented on wrong download but this is a great movie just dont know the quality 
,Asjo,2012-04-19T13:19Z,"It's true - it is quite frustrating to download a movie, open it, only to find out it's in another language. If it's not noted in the title of the download, you will assume that the movie is in its original language, especially when there are so many seeders for that upload :)"
,xxxGAMExxx,2012-04-20T11:24Z,what i'm gona do with the russian language . upload it in english. NOOB
,tixan,2012-04-20T20:29Z,xxxGAMExxx: You can shut the fuck up and search for english version.. don't be whiny just because there are so poor english uploads.
,gamecocks23,2012-04-21T20:38Z,"Hey yo idiots who are complaining that it's in Russian and doesn't say it.. How about you look at the info, shit even the picture of the DVD obviously isn't in English. Open your eyes and STFU. You are the type of people that could be handed a million dollars cash to keep and complain that it was all 100 dollar bills. ""n00b"" Have you uploaded anything xxxGAMExxx? Probably not you pussy, go jump off a ledge"
,ds12,2012-04-22T10:41Z,"Dont blame the uploader for not labeling it as Russian, blame his parents for not smothering him.  Hes clearly stupid enough to think this is a Dvdrip, probably doesnt even know its not in English. "
,Asjo,2012-04-23T04:10Z,"gamecocks23: I think we each have our preferences as to how much info we check before we download something. I personally don't spend any amount on time on checking an upload if enough people have tagged it as good, it has the right size, name and amount of seeds. 

Obviously, I would expect the title to say if it was a dubbed version, so I'm not checking for that in the info :)"
,Rastamanse,2012-04-30T21:03Z,No Korean subs in this? 
,xtheghost,2012-05-03T00:22Z,"PLEASE PUT ""RUSSIAN"" IN ALL OF YOUR FUTURE UPLOADS. 

I understand you ""don't have to"" but it would be good for both of us. Russian's looking for this rip wouldn't be able to search it, since it's not listed in the title. (and obi everyone looking for an English version would stop bitching.)"
,Keepsix_,2012-05-04T16:22Z,"@spifkitten99 and anyone else bitching.
Why dont you grow a pair of fucking eyes, it has a picture of the Russian video cover, 
and it says "" Audio: Russian DUB Dolby AC3, 48000Hz 6ch, 384Kbps"" in the description.

you cant expect everyone to post all the details in the title... Learn to fucking read the description, or at least look at the damn picture you lazy fucks"
,Fadwer,2012-05-14T14:51Z,@kage_dk why* poor*
