Search on internet, example HirensBoot"
,machv5,2012-07-21T18:00Z,I checked into what happens when you change your system ID and found that the app newsid can do damage to your system and things like Windows SteadybState will no longer function. So personally I wouldn't recommend that anyone uses the newsid.exe app that comes with this torrent. And because that is needed for the thing to work right I am trashing this torrent and looking for another one.
