,Bubbers83,2012-06-06T04:02Z,Any chance you could post a torrent of the 3rd issue of Supurbia? have not seen one torrent of it in the month it has been out:( any help?
[T],MrDowntown,2012-06-17T00:23Z,So in the comic store today and saw issue #3 and #4 ... I dont know why no one has scanned these yet *GRUMBLE*
,sky042013,2012-08-17T18:12Z,"Any chance that you might have the 3rd and 4th issues? They've been out for a few months now, and it doesn't look like anyone has scanned and posted them."
,Xpatriated,2012-09-01T00:12Z,I can't believe 3 and 4 never got scanned.  So sad.
