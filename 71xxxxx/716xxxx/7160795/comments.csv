I don't understand people who need to be so rude about something that cost them nothing.
This is an excellent. Totally enjoyable copy, especially for those who can't convert to DVD...
... YES, their out there.
LAME...Saying that was LAME. YOUR COMMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST THE SAME WITHOUT THE INSULT.
Sure, you can get much better copies now, but it was GREAT THEN, and still FAIR now, not LAME.
BTW. What do you contribute? Or are you just another LEECH?"
