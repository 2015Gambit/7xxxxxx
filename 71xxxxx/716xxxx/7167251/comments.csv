,ndylostkid,2012-05-03T17:38Z,"ternyata penghuni TPB banyak orang indonesia jg yah?
klo bukan karna The Raid, mungkin identitas kita tdk akan pernah ada yg tau :D

God damn it, still cam?

,D932,2012-05-14T22:06Z,@ bogota62295 - Because it's from Indonesia.. And from this thread you can see they're too busy saying hi to one another to know the movie was chopped in their country. America FUCK YEA
