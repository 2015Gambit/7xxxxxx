Hello! Python fully covers the building blocks of Python programming and gives you a gentle introduction to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, network programming, and program design. New (or nearly new) programmers will learn most of what they need to know to start using Python immediately.


Programmers love Python because it's fast and efficient. Shouldn't learning Python be just the same? Hello! Python starts quickly and simply, with a line of Python code. You'll learn the basics the right way, by writing your own programs. Along the way, you'll get a gentle introduction to more advanced concepts and new programming styles.

No experience with Python needed. Exposure to another programming language is helpful but not required.
What Makes Hello! Python special
