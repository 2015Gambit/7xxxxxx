DivX Plus - a collection of codecs (DivX, H.264, AAC and MKV). Among other things, the package includes a free DivX H.264 Decoder for hardware acceleration with DXVA (DirectX Video Acceleration) for viewing high-definition video without worrying about excessive CPU usage. In short, now using some methods more complex and resource intensive compression is better than a compressed file with better quality, but requires less CPU - concerns came to the video chip, and even low power consumption of the system ( as netbooks) will be able to easily reproduce it.
