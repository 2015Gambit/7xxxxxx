Family Farm is an innovative tycoon game in the setting of 19th century farmsteads. It's a simulation of a farmstead experienced in stories which span a generation. Clicking cows won't earn you any cash! You control characters with RPG-like attributes, skills and needs. Keep them fed, develop their skills, upgrade house to accommodate a bigger family and grow their land in to a Family Farm!
