This wee movie captures the thick regional accent particular to the Northeast coast of Scotland (Aberdeen, Fraserburgh, etc.), usually referred to as Doric. The Doric lives in all of us, to one degree or another. However, you may find a Doric dictionary to be of benefit, in the interest of lucid communication. I know I do. Enjoy!
