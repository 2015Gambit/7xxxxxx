When youâ™re under pressure to produce a well designed, easy-to-navigate mobile app, thereâ™s no time to reinvent the wheel. This concise book provides a handy reference to 70 mobile app design patterns, illustrated by more than 400 screenshots from current iOS, Android, BlackBerry, WebOS, Windows Mobile, and Symbian apps.

User experience professional Theresa Neil (Designing Web Interfaces) walks you through design patterns in 10 separate categories, including anti-patterns. Whether youâ™re designing a simple iPhone application or one thatâ™s meant to work for every popular mobile OS on the market, these patterns provide solutions to common design challenges.

Pattern categories include:
• Navigation: get patterns for primary and secondary navigation
• Forms: break the industry-wide habits of bad form design
• Tables and lists: display only the most important information
• Search, sort, and filter: make these functions easy to use
• Tools: create the illusion of direct interaction
• Charts: learn best practices for basic chart design
• Invitations: invite users to get started and discover features
• Controls and feedback: help users perform actions, and provide them with timely feedback
• Help: integrate help pages into a smaller form factor
