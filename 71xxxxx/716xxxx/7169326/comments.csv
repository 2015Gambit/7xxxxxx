,bjmassni,2012-04-16T18:26Z,"Maby, yes I agree that KK is our only hope lol I don't think he has been here in a while because no torrents have been uploaded! It kind of sucks having nothing to download. But yes I do have his other Hurwitz torrent. Gregg Hurwitz is one of my favorite authors, I have read his most recent 3 (Trust No One, They're Watching, and You're Next) and those were 3 of my favorite books I have read."
