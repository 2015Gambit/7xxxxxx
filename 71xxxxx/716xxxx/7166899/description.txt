 Thirty years ago, after a decade of hits as lead singer with the Commodores, 
 Lionel Richie released his debut solo album, marking the beginning of a long and 
 successful career that has bagged him several number ones and awards. In this 
 one-off special the singer performs some of his biggest and best-loved hits, 
 including Dancing on the Ceiling, Easy, Hello and Say You, Say Me, and is joined 
 on stage for duets by chart star Pixie Lott and 2010 X Factor runner-up Rebecca 
 Ferguson. The programme also features an interview from his home in Los Angeles, 
 where he chats to Christine Bleakley about his life and career.  
                                                                               
                                          
                                 Enjoy!
