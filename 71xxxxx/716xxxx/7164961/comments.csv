I say to hell with doing a search before uploading anything!

If you had a brain, which I am doubtful that you do, you might consider the different uses for thepiratebay.com. I personally use it as a way to share music with my close friends. I upload these albums at a certain bitrate and tagged properly. Get off my page, asshole. "
,Dakins,2012-04-22T05:43Z,"Screw the haters. I was looking for this album, at that bitrate, and was glad I found it here.

I don't care about how many times it's been posted. I only care that I found what I was looking for. And I thank you, uploader, for that."
,datrobotjazz,2012-04-23T03:19Z,"Thanks, Dakins. I appreciate it! "
,ValdeFin,2012-04-27T17:05Z,"Nice speed, thank you very much! "
