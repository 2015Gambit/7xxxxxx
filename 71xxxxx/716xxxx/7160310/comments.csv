,Torium,2012-04-13T22:36Z,Thank you!
,RandomGui,2012-04-17T09:53Z,"Just wondering if these files are watermarked? I have all the episodes in various definitions, but I'd love to get a full 720p set without watermarks. Also, if possible, could you get your hands on 720p episodes of season 4 and upload them as soon as possible after they come out?

Cheers"
,dora_the_horror,2012-05-06T09:34Z,Is it just me or are some parts of some videos corrupted? 
,dora_the_horror,2012-05-06T09:35Z,The videos are playable and watchable but I see some visual and audio corruption. 
,tonyc9895,2012-05-31T02:56Z,"Under VLc and WMP I get some corruption, especially on my netbook. All that I've tried so far work perfectly in 
Media Player Classic on my laptop with a 2 Ghz core 2 duo. The codecs that I have are CCCP and 
Real Alternative."
,Beanies,2012-05-31T04:56Z,"I use VLC and some of these videos are corrupted in some areas. It's annoying but I guess I could live with it.

Thanks for the upload."
,tonyc9895,2012-06-03T07:17Z,"After some further experimentation, turning the video render on vlc to open-gl seems to get rid of all the video and audio corruption. Also, you can just rewind and watch the corrupted part over again usually."
,xDonarudo,2012-06-30T05:33Z,How about you guys stop using VLC and get a real video player and decoder. Just tested a random episode and everything checks out great. 
,misuchiru,2012-07-05T07:53Z,"Don't use Real Player because there is a tried-and-true history of: 

-Real Player Server Connect Issues (not connecting to its own server)
-Video and Audio Playback Issues
-DVD Burning Issues
-Failure to Update
-Compatibility Issues with Graphics Drivers (since when is it EVER okay to have a video player have issues with graphics drivers?)
-Other not-so-common Issues

This is the first I have heard of VLC having any problems with videos.  It will be resolved soon if it already hasn't.  VLC has already loaded from download the codecs needed to play almost every video type.

As for your testing a random video and being okay, if you noticed, people commented with ""Some parts of some videos"" that were corrupted.  You may have a point in using RP for the videos, or you just picked the good episode.  Good work none-the-less in making it work for you.  As for the rest of us, we will be sticking to VLC where everything else works as well.  

Good work with the videos.  Do appreciate.  Cheers."

He said in ""some"" areas. Some episodes may have it, some may not. Checking a random one doesn't guarantee the best results out of 60 videos."
,Andykings,2012-08-05T12:47Z,Screw VLC. MPC-HC ftw
,rickruin,2012-08-07T10:37Z,whats the source of these? HDTV? WebDL iTunes or Amazon? Little more info please!
,SansSerif,2012-08-15T03:21Z,"They are all HDTV rips.
And I don't know what the problem is with VLC making the episodes look corrupted, but they all look perfect on Xbox, WindowsMP, and some other players I've tried."
,blacksiopao,2012-09-16T05:40Z,"hey guys, ive done all the rainicorn subs for this torrent, hope you like it :) www,mediafire,com/?3ymycnt1hmwia63 just put it in their respective folders. enjoy!
