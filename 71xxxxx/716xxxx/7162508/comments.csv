C:/Program Files/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher (32bit)
C:/Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher (64bit)


Note: For users with Windows 7 64bit operating systems install Assassins Creed Revelations in C:/Assassins Creed Revelations. This will resolve errors while updating and while playing the game."

,Rando_q1,2012-04-06T10:22Z,@beso140... when u buy the game i guess.....
,beso140,2012-04-06T10:47Z,i m waitting for assassins creed 3 maerican revolution
,Philippine1,2012-04-07T16:48Z,DLC?
,Braga987,2012-04-08T00:21Z,"@Philippine1

No it is just simply updates for Assassins Creed Revelations that will allow you to play the game "
,spetzzz,2012-04-09T17:58Z,Working with SKIDROW'S???
,Braga987,2012-04-09T23:21Z,"@spetzzz

yup"
,minhsan,2012-04-10T08:42Z,im not sure why but does the 1.02 update normally take forever?
,Bad213Boy,2012-04-13T22:37Z,"This crack isn't that good. When I setup anything that triggers during the startup of ACRSP.exe, the game stops responding. This includes profiles for mice, keyboards, and Tridef 3D."
,Bad213Boy,2012-04-14T00:30Z,"I was able to get my game peripherals profiles working with v1.02, but not with v1.03. I did noticed that some files might be missing from v1.03, comparing to v1.02. I'm wondering if you need to apply v1.02 crack first and then apply this 1.03. I report back."
,Bad213Boy,2012-04-14T00:46Z,"Ya v1.03 works, but it's still fucked up. You can't use any devices with the game. You'll have to set the devices using default profiles. I think Nvidia's 3D works, but Tridef 3D does not."
,Braga987,2012-04-14T18:22Z,"@Bad213Boy

yup that is a problem with the game itself if your using a Logitech Rumblepad2 or Dual Action Gamepad you may want to try download the xbox360 joypad emulation, simply google ""assassins creed revelations rumblepad 2"""
,Cp6uH91,2012-04-16T03:47Z,"I don't download these updates, just turn off internet while i play and thats it.. But thanks anyways SKIDROW! "
,Bad213Boy,2012-04-19T04:25Z,"*** Gaming Peripherals Fix ***

Start the game and let it crash as usual. Then either log out of Windows or reboot. Once you're back in try restarting the game. Should work now. So far all my peripherals are working now."
,Bad213Boy,2012-04-19T04:27Z,Make sure you copy UbisoftGameLauncher.exe into: C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher.
,XarisMaster,2012-04-19T13:08Z,"Ok i think i found the solution.

,AuriCat,2012-05-10T21:01Z,I'm having an issue where the game launcher folder isn't writing... Anyone suffering similar?
,hisazul,2012-05-14T05:08Z,"so... this one for some bizzare reason is the cracked version that doesnt have a working desmond journey....
GREAT. im so happy for blowing a dozen hours in just to find that out."
,reichembach,2012-05-14T15:16Z,Same problem with Desmond's Journey! It crashes when you try to play it! I thought this was fixed in version 1.01! Anyway to fix this? (without losing your save data lol)
,hisazul,2012-05-14T19:26Z,this is basically the steam006 or something guys 1.03 bypass... however orbits folder is the one that has fucked up desmonds journey as if it was taken from the orginal nonpatched skidrow release and used -_-
,hisazul,2012-05-15T00:07Z,"ok found a way to get desmonds journey to work.
take the crack included in this.
copy to your main installation directory:
orbit folder,skidrow.dll, ubiorbitapi_r2.dll, ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll. NOTHING ELSE. all those executables... i honestly have no fucking idea why people include this crap it does absolutely fucking nothing.
go find a proper skidrow update 1.02 crack. from there all you need is UbisoftGameLauncher.exe its in orbit folder. replace the one you have in your orbit folder with the one from 1.02 crack. and BAM. desmonds journey doesnt crash. granted it will work funny... settings on launcher dont save. so u need to select offline mode every time and type in skidrow... followed by anything for password.
wish people would fucking bother to test shit before they start uploading it for chryst sake its like a race here. sadly its a race to release crap that half the time doesnt even work properly.
"
,reichembach,2012-05-15T02:48Z,"Thanks Hisazul!! That worked great!! (: Just don't forget to move your save files to the new location or else you'll have to start over! :P
Anyway, thanks again! Saved my life! :"
,pupuson,2012-05-19T17:03Z,what's the username and password? i Typed skidrow and nothing on password but it says login failed
,xhynnichiy,2012-05-28T15:48Z,thanks Braga987.. it works..
,Rezol,2012-06-09T23:49Z,"@pupuson
You have to type something in the password field. Just type whatever until no more dots are added (8 or 10 I think) then login."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-06-25T23:32Z,"does not work for me, game does not start up after....later i'll be uploading a legit torrent of this."

,kaloresi,2012-08-02T12:23Z,do i have to install first the update 1.01 and 1.02 before installing this one or i can install it directly?
,just1aim,2012-08-04T13:31Z,"update 1 and 2 work for some odd reason 3 is saying cant find source file blah blah

,jrmc01,2012-08-09T01:52Z,"@just1aim
You need the clean .exe files, not the cracked ones."
,Anonymous1234567890,2012-08-18T10:00Z,"doesn't work for me, i installed everything like the description says to and then cracked it, but when i open the geme, the autopatcher pops up for a second and then nothing happens.
