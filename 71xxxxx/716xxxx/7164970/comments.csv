,Dimmis80,2012-04-07T23:42Z,Hey guys.Scene4all good friend thanks a lot for the release of this latest episode of smackdown.Like always top job mate and awesome speeds...:-)Now i have a question.I have a media player-AC Ryan with 1080p Full HD capabilities and i am watching all of the vids in my TV.This media player plays all the known or uknown type of videos and formats and sound stuff.And i use both the 720p versions of your Smackdown-Raw and events shows and the HD version of Rudos and your other sourses.So did u change your video-sound format or something because some of your vids from Wrestlemania and now with this torrent it makes my player to froze and don't play the video and in the past i did not having any type of problems and stuff with all of your vids.It happens some times.I have problem with this torrent but all ok and fine with the HD Rudos version of Raw.!So again did u change anything.???Thanks in advance.????
