Undercover Boss Canada is the latest in a franchise of shows in more than a few languages which feature high ranking executives working among the commoners in the company to see what it is really like. Rarely do they ever seem to find anything bad. 


IN THIS EPISODE

Lisa Lisson, CEO of FedEx Express Canada, knows how to deliver. But as a single mother with a high stress job, she also believes in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. FedEx is consistently listed as one of the top 50 best Canadian employers and Lisa knows to be number one, the FedEx work environment needs to improve. She believes that when employees are engaged, committed and motivated by their leaders and work culture, they are driven to contribute to the companyΓÇÖs well being. Lisa goes undercover to ensure employees have the tools they need to succeed - and that FedEx not only delivers to its customers, but also to its valuable employees.
