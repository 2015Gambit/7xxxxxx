Source Used



INSPIRAL .........Thanks




V2 using the new source which i must say is better but because of the way it is put together it does still have flaws ...The 3D effect in some parts will put people off


Just done what i could ..........sample included..........which shows it going blurry with the 3D effect ..........your choice


Late on this one i guess so not so new a source anymore     


Enjoy
