I gotta hand it to Artogon Games, makers of hidden object game, Shiver: Poltergeist. They did something few developers manage to doΓÇösurprise me. Although the game's premise isn't earth-shatteringly new (the hero suddenly inherits a big house from heretofore unknown relatives), it's presented in a creative way that'll keep you (as it did me) guessing. Furthermore, thanks to deft storytelling, cool characters and truly spooky visual effects, they did another thing few developers manage to doΓÇöscare me.

The hero of Shiver: Poltergeist is no one special, just an average guy with an average life. Like many of us, he's terribly bored of the repetitive work/home/sleep/work routine, and wishes for something exciting to happen. Unlike most of us however, his wish is granted when a letter informs him he's the last remaining heir to the home of the once-great Kangale family. Gleefully, he dumps the daily grind and heads off to take possession of a huge English manor house located on its own tiny island. His joy is cut short however, when he finds out that along with the house, he's inherited a dangerous family secretΓÇöa secret that must be unraveled before it destroys him.
