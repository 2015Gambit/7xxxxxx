Amazon.com Review
Modern Western culture and technology is inextricably tied to the belief in the existence of a self as a separate ego, separated from and in conflict with the rest of the world. In this classic book, Watts provides a lucid and simple presentation of an alternative view based on Hindi and Vedantic philosophy.

From the Inside Flap
A witty attack on the illusion that the self is a separate ego that confronts a universe of alien physical objects.
