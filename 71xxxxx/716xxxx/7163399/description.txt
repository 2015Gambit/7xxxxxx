This is a full resolution, high profile x264 DVD rip of Sliders - Season 5 (of 5).  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, to output to a t.v. or such, then this may be for you.

NOTE: Since the only source I could get my hands on were DVD-5's, the quality is not quite on par with the rest of the series.  I did the best I could with them and they look pretty decent, however they were already compressed from the original DVD-9's from the start.
