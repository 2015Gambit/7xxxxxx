Excellent quality."
,ili2882,2012-04-06T18:42Z,"As these wore riped from a French R2 disk there are French (and a few other European Languages) subs available online see
http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/pimdbid-112167/season-5 or
http://subscene.com/french/Sliders-Fifth-Season/subtitle-493162.aspx
Unfortunately I can't find English 25 fps subs if I do I'll post a link (there are subs from the UK TV Rips floating around but those are hard to sync because of the commercials that wore cut etc.)"
[V],meech,2012-04-06T22:41Z,"Hi ili2882.  Thanks again for helping me find these disks...i gave you cred in the torrent description :)

I almost always include subs with my torrents.  I too looked all over for proper English subs, but couldn't find them anywhere."
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-04-07T06:39Z,"Thank you for uploading the final season of Sliders, and thanks for all the other quality dvdrips you've given us. I've been seeding for months quite a few of the series.
Can we convince you into doing Stargate Atlantis and Star Wars The Clone Wars? Or maybe you can go old school and do something like Kung Fu or Planet of the Apes tv series.
Thanks again for all your quality uploads!"
,ili2882,2012-04-07T15:23Z,"Well I've been watching some of your smallwille rips and got some nostalgia about the previous 90's Superman show, don't know if you watched it, Lois and Clark with Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain, I remember watching it as a kid and as far as I can remember it was an OK show I believe it was canceled in favor of a Nicolas Cage Superman Feature that newer came. I found scene 350M rips but those don't compare to your quality."
,ili2882,2012-04-08T15:40Z,"Well the French R2 DVD9's just popped up :(
there isn't much difference between the DVD5's, the DVD9 are about 32GiB with 3 audio streams and two subs (French and Dutch) while the DVD5's had only 2 audio streams and 1 sub and wore 22 GiB.
but if someone needs them they're on rutracker."
