I am waiting forever for a decent music CD or even better a DVD with the actual footage. I watched it live and it was such a beautiful experience."

@flak77: I have no idea what you are talking about. If you're burning it to a CD to listen to, make sure you write the tracks in the proper order. Seems to work fine on my end."
