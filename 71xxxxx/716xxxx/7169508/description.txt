Well, I waited forever for the Met Opera to release a recording of this wonderful production. 

They just can't seem to get around to it - so I've taken the 5.1 stream from their Live in HD broadcast and re-worked it so it sounds better.

I've also taken a fair amount of effort to re-engineer it so that the stereo mix of it sounds good. This is not just 5.1 automatically remapped to 2.0.

Both the 5.1 and 2.0 mixes are here (thus the large file-size) in 24-bit FLAC.

MPG AC-3 stream was remastered in a 32-bit workflow, and then saved down to 24-bit without dithering.

This is my FIRST TORRENT - let me know what you think!

(BTW - if they ever get around to releasing a CD, go buy it!)
