Enable you to freely personalize various widgets to a full range. Let's say goodbye to the traditional operation system.

Features:


Enable you to do multipul-operation, including auto-arragement, multipul-choices, add-to-folder, multipul-deleting, to the items by only one move of the finger. You can also check your folders in various ways.
TSF SHELL 3D has one app page and 4 personalized pages for our users. You can switch between pages by one click at the switch button in the lower left corner.
You can freely create one or more quicklinks for apps and drag them to any page. You can also distribute all the app icon (or even change their angles) freely in the personalized page.
The side column provides the most TSF Shell 3D charateristic widgets, including folders, contacts, music player, weather and so on.
The side column can be personalized as well, including changing the order and position of different catagories. You can create quicklinks of your most frequently used apps and contact in the quick launch in the side column.
TSF Shell 3D has a most powerful theme function. Apart from the difference in style, some themes even allow change in the transition animation.

Tips:
========================

1. The folder where the application is less than 7, only to circle the icon into the folder.
2. The folder where the application is more than 7, only to drag the icon ftom the folder.

========================
