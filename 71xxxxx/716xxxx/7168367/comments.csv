,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T10:11Z,"Hi, i was going to explain to ya all why the movie is shorter than the retail one. But, it seems that the movie is acually shorter. Anyway, when you watch the real movie it's shown in 24 FPS (23.976 FPS) but when you watch it in the cinema it's played in 25 FPS. So i made a calculation out of it as you can see below.

NOTE: The runtime of this movie is not 1h 25mn it's 1h 30mn.

Real Playtime: 6780 sec (24 FPS)
TS Playtime: 5416 sec (25 FPS)
CAM Playtime: 5101 sec (25 FPS)

Multiplier: 0.96 (1/25 = 0.04 | 1 - 0.04 =0.96)

Calculation: 6780*0.96 = 6508,8 sec

25 FPS Playtime: 6508,8 sec - Credits = (5416 sec || 5101 sec) ???

I belive that this is a correct calculation that removes 1 second every 25th second. However this means that the movie credits must be either 18 mins or 23 mins. In this case 18 mins cus this is the TS version. And i don't believe that the credits is 18 mins. So why is the movie shorter than it's supposed to be?"

The only thing annoying about this upload is that during the movie some scenes are cut out making the movie almost unwatchable. I rather wait until someone uploads the FULL movie."
