Lyrics:

How to choose?
Who to be?
Well, let's see
There are so many choices now.
Play guitar, be a movie star.
In my head a voice says
Why not, try everything?
Why stop, reach for any dream?
I can rock, cause it's my life.
And now's the time,

Chorus:
Who will i be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities
That I can see
There's nothing that i can't do
Who will i be?
Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I could become anyone and know the choice is up to me
Who will I be?

Yeah yeah..

If I decide,
I'm the girl to change the world
I can do it and it's an
Opportunity right in front of me
And the choices,all mine

Why not, try everything?
Why stop, reach for any dream?
I can rock, cause it's my life.
And now's the time,

Chorus:
Who will i be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities
That I can see
There's nothing that i can't do
Who will i be?
Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I could become anyone and know the choice is up to me
Who will I be?

I wanna find the 'who I am' inside.
Who will I be?
I wanna show the, the way that I can shine...
Yeah...Oh yeah..yeah..

Chorus:
Who will i be?
It's up to me
All the never ending possibilities
That I can see
There's nothing that i can't do
Who will i be?
Yes, I believe
I get to make the future what I want to
If I could become anyone and know the choice is up to me
Who will I be?

Ohh..who will I be?
Who will I be?
