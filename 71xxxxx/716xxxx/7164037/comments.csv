 Baron Manfred von Richthofen (Schweigh÷fer) is the most feared and celebrated
 pilot of the German air force in World War I. To him and his companions, air
 combats are events of sporty nature, technical challenge and honorable acting,
 ignoring the terrible extent of war. But after falling in love with the nurse
 KΣte (Headey), Manfred realizes he is only used for propaganda means. Caught
 between his disgust for the war, and the responsibility for his fighter wing,
 von Richthofen sets out to fly again.

 Repack notes:
 Our previous release was 60MB oversized, here's a repack with the correct
 size. If you downloaded our other release however, there's no real panic as
 you don't -NEED- to re-download it. Everything else is fine, but if you 
 want an unnuked release in your archive, here it is. Sorry for any troubles
 it might've caused you when racing or whatever.

 Enjoy this movie from your friends in CULTHD!
