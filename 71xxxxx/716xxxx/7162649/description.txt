Except for "Drums," and "Singing" these are not my rips. Singing has a group of damaged sectors intermittently for 15 seconds of track 9; I did not detect any problems with playback and, because of the lack of this album's availability in lossless, I included it here. Ripped with XLD in XLD Secure Ripper mode on a Mac G5 into Apple Lossless and then converted to FLAC.
