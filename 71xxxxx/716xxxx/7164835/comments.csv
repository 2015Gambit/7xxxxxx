Very frustrating when the film starts and the people are talking in Bosnian or whatever and I put the subs on and we have choice of Dutch and 2 lots of French!!??
Keeping the English subs wouldn't have made the   film much bigger and you would been able to satisfy a lot more downloaders. Thanks anyway, Video was excellent but no english subs on the foreign speaking parts spoilt the film for me. Now I'll have to chuck the DVD and burn a different copy
Fair enough..Sub languages are stated but still..having it in English would have made the film more avail to others.
Great film btw"

Maybe it's the case here.
For example i've ripped a DVD here :

No english subtitles available on the DVD :/"
