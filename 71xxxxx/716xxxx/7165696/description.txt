Between 2007 and 2011, twelve severed feet in running shoes have been found off the coast of Western Canada and Washington State. This is the only place in the world where severed feet are mysteriously washing up on shore. Police are baffled by this phenomenon as no other body parts have been discovered.

In the fall of 2007, a student had been videoing his history project on ΓÇ£Kanaka Pete the Axe MurdererΓÇ¥. In January 2012 that same video was leaked from the local authorities.

Will the "Mystery of the Severed Feet" finally be exposed?
