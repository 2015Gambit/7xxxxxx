I have reduced the size from 6.06GB down to 3.08GB to make downloading faster!
Please carefully read the text files when installing!"
,abccba2,2012-04-09T13:11Z,"Thanks, these have never worked for me so greatful to try someone elses.  The rar is downloaded OK and re-checks OK in client. Winrar extracts the tib OK.  Image Home 2009 gives an error when trying to open the tib. Can anyone confirm the tib is OK.  Surely I don't have to upgrade to True Image Home 2010?!"
,bloxwich0,2012-04-09T16:45Z,"The .tib file was created in Acronis 2010 and, from my limited experience, I don't think 2009 will do the trick for you...it has to be 2010 or later! Sorry!"
,abccba2,2012-04-10T21:35Z,"Thanks, if anyone doesn't want to install True Image, get a BOOTCD from here : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5092802/Acronis_True_Image_Home_2010_v13_Build_5055___BootCD__Serial

Burn CD, boot from it, use it to transfer Windows 7 from the tib to your USB drive and you're away."
,bloxwich0,2012-04-10T23:56Z,"Hi ABCCBA2, assume you've got Windows 7 working on a USB Stick or external USB HDD now!

Thanks for putting the Acronis Boot CD link up, it will be useful to most people!

Kind regards."
,abccba2,2012-04-15T09:48Z,"This works great. Completely unusable for about 50 minutes while the vast majority of drivers were auto installed from within Wndows 7 (no internet at this stage), then after reboot all OK; screen resolution, audio, video, wireless, internet etc.  On the second PC I tried, a recent netbook, only took about 10 minutes to reach this state.  I have nothing but praise for iMortaluz.

Is it advisable to allow auto updates or not?"
,bloxwich0,2012-04-15T19:15Z,"Pleased it's all working for you...don't know about updates, iMortaluz is the man to ask.

Try the following link to his website:-

There doesn't seem to be any warnings about using a Windows Serial number. If you check Control Panel/System/Windows Activation seems OK to me so iMortaluz must have got round that problem with the serial key.

Thanks again for your comments!"
