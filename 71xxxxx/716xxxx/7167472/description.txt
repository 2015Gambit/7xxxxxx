Preactivated version_silent installation by Master13.
as this specific version is a little bit different than Dimitry version,
i suggest you first,before installing any new one from Master13 to proceed like this :
A)uninstall previous installation
B)use regedit.exe
C)clean all reg key and registry of DVDFab
D)close regedit.exe and reboot
E)now,you can install a such version of DVDFab from Master13 in clean mode.

If some of you still get 29 days trial again,please,post here and therefore
i will up for each next torrent,Dimitry version only.
Sorry for this inconvenience anyway if you get it so.
