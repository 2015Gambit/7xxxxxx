has there been such an ambitious project to describe the state of the art in all the fields encompassed within the social 
and behavioral sciences. 
It comprises 4,000 articles, commissioned by 52 Section Editors, and includes 90,000 bibliographic references as well as 
comprehensive name and subject indexes.
