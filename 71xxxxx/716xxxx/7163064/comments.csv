,benbargain,2012-04-06T03:52Z,Why are all the eztv torrents in mp4 now? avi is better
,Foxie10,2012-04-06T05:04Z,New software out for the trackers to convert quicker and at higher res in mp4 with smaller file size
,Rothaqul,2012-04-06T05:21Z,"becouse too many shitheads have been complaining about it, mp4 is better for hand held devices, but if they cant afford a tv or computer to watch it on, they shouldn't. mp4 sucks ass and so do all the tards wanting it"
,rjcripe,2012-04-06T05:42Z,@benbargain @Rothaqul  Seriouslllyyyy.  So fucking tired of these MP4s.  I want to watch my damn shows on my Xbox!  Fuckers.
,godswallops,2012-04-06T06:13Z,Shut up you fucking whingers. If you want fucking AVI's convert the fucking MP4 your fucking selves you fucking dipshits.
,froznstuf,2012-04-06T06:50Z,MP4>AVI
,firexninja,2012-04-06T06:55Z,thank you!
,euchrid3,2012-04-06T10:09Z,"You can stream mp4s to an Xbox, just use TVersity. It does a lot of formats that Media Player doesn't."
,wertham,2012-04-06T14:07Z,thanks!
,magicmonkey9212,2012-04-06T15:43Z,"lets all take a breather, just because our free and effortless way of enjoying fantastic tv shows is in a different (and in my opinion, superior) format is no reason to insult each other, the internet is such an unhappy place sometimes :( thanks eztv!"
,kok_warlock,2012-04-06T15:51Z,"Stop whining you bitches, MP4 is just as good, if not better, and here at least, it runs smooth in my old Xbox(Original, locked and updated) without any need of a mod or anything."
,wenex,2012-04-06T22:56Z,"Oh listen to you bitches. Avi is NOT better. MP4's are superior in quality and size. That's just a fucking fact. Because you PREFER avi's do not make them ""better"". If you're having a hard time playing it on your TV - which by the way, plenty of us have no problem doing - google how others are making it work and emulate them. Or torrent a converter and convert them to AVI's yourself. "
,mysticsquee,2012-04-07T07:07Z,Thank You EZ! Top work as always. And you release them in whatever format is easiest for you my friend. We are gettin this shit for free because of yr tireless efforts. Thank You again!!!
,Pizza923,2012-04-08T10:47Z,"Don't you love how no one comments on eztv uploads? Because they don't have to. God damn you're amazing eztv, what would we do with out you?"
,ust2,2012-04-10T17:16Z," The smaller superior arguement isn't rerally valid when this one is the exact same size as the avi's used to be :P

 And as i've found out recently, MP4's just don't agree with every machine. So imo avi is superior since it's compatible with everthing."
,shWit,2012-04-16T01:23Z,"AVI isn't some magical format that works for everything.  MP4 is much more compatible with newer devices.  If you don't like the format, google how to convert it"
