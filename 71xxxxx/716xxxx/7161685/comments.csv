Thanks!

,nikitan1,2012-05-04T17:29Z,"Hi erPlay you welcome :) the subs can be enabled/disabled, so if you use VLC you can do from main menu ""Video""->""Subtitles track"".. in your case I suspect you have set the font size for the text too big.. again, if you use VLC you can lower the size from ""Tools""->""Preferences""->""Subtitles&OSD""->""Subtitles effects"" :) hope that helps.. ;)"
