Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision (1995) [NR] - 83 minutes

In this Oscar-winning documentary, director Freida Lee Mock captures the genius of architect Maya Lin, who vaulted to fame at age 21 when her sparse, modern and controversial design was chosen to memorialize the Vietnam War in Washington, D.C. While many voiced displeasure with her design and Asian heritage, the memorial has become one of the most powerful in the world. The film also highlights Lin's Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Ala.
