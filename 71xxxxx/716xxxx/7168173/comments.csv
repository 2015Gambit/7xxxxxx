I finally decided to upload this Maya Lin's documentary video.

The video file is ripped directly from DVD, so the video and audio quality would be perfect as the original.

There is no Blu-ray for this video so far.
But think, this video is very old, so I don't really think they will release this video in Blu-ray anyway.

Please seed.

Thank you.

So you can play it from your iPhone and iPad."
