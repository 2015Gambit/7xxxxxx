This is an English Language Packet of FIFA Manager 12.
For all of you who had problems with the language do the following steps:

1.Go to your FIFA Manag.12 installation folder > fmdata.

2.There, between other files you can see folders named: 
       "fre"(french) ; "ger"(german) ; "spa"(spain) ; "rus" (russian)

3.In the same directory "fmdata" create new folder and name it whatever, 
  ex: "backup languages" and put all those folders(fre,ger,spa,rus) in it.

4.Now after U've downloaded this torrent there should be folder named "eng"
   -put the folder "eng" into your FIFA Manag.12 installation folder > fmdata.

5.Launch FIFA Manager 12, it should be in english. =)
