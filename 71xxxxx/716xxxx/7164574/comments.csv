its not that people complain its more that they DEMAND better quality stuff from the person that uploads the movie/tv show or whatever, sure you can offer me a dogshit hotdog and I could say yes or I could walk away.. but I can also yell at you telling you to make me something better even though you just spent a week gathering shit from dog parks.

It would be a great service to say something is bad so others may not download it and save them time if it is really unbearably bad but to demand better quality,... well shit why don't they demand a raise instead so they can actually buy it or go see it in theaters?"

Ofcourse people demand better quality when it states it is a DVDrip when it is a screener. In this case, you buy a hotdog WITHOUT knowing it is shit inside. It is a whole diferent story then when they KNOW there is shit inside and still download it, when this happens i would probably agree with you. There where some warning the downloaders that it was a screener, but i bet many of the complainers downloaded this before those warnings came around, hence most of the flaming.

I think the your analogy of hotdogs with shit inside is wrong. It's not like this is a fake movie (in the same manner that a hotdog with dog poop inside instead of actual hotdogs is a fake hotdog). The better analogy would be of someone giving away free cheese hotdogs only to find out that he forgot to the cheese. Either way it's still a hotdog...but you don't complain right? It's free...

Anyway, what's with all the hotdog talks? I must be getting hungry...hehe..
