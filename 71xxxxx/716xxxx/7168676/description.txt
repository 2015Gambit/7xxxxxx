StoryLine
 
Dawn grows up in the shadow of a nuclear power plant. In high school, 
while her biology class studies evolution, she realizes she may have 
a hidden curse, an "adaptation." She lives with her mom, step-father, 
and hard-edged step-brother. She likes Tobey, a guy at school, and 
he likes her. She takes a pledge to remain chaste until marriage, 
so they date in groups, watch G-rated films, and don't kiss, but 
the power of teen hormones is great, so temptation beckons. Dawn 
has an admirer in Ryan, and when she breaks it off unexpectedly 
with Tobey, she turns to Ryan for help. Will he be her mythical hero 
and rescue her? Or can she find her way as her own hero, turning the 
curse into an asset?
