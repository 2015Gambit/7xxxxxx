DESCRIPTION:

The Catcher in the Rye is the story of teenager Holden Caulfield's turbulent last few days before his Christmas vacation. 
During these days, Holden leaves Pencey Prep, a boys' school he's been kicked out of, and takes off for a few nights 
alone in New York City. Holden tells the story as a monologue, from some sort of a mental facility where he's recovering 
from the stress of the experiences he retells.
