This is the original 1967 Incense and Peppermints album from Strawberry Alarm Clock. I can hardly find a torrent for the album and all the other torrents with the name is almost always that crappy compilation album with the same name, so thought I'd upload this for anyone who wanted the 'ACTUAL' album.

NOTE: Some of the tracks have like little scratch sounds in them, but shouldn't be too annoying, unless you're very picky :P
