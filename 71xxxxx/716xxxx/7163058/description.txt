"Nothing Left to Lose"

After reading Pete's discouraging 
KableTown self-evaluation, Jack takes 
on the task of making Pete a 
respectable man. Tracy regains his long 
lost sense of smell and finds himself 
particularly fond of Liz's scent. 
Meanwhile, Kenneth unwittingly helps 
Jenna plan revenge against the 
Pranksmen. 

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
