Are you beginning a creative writing course? Or thinking about taking one?
Doing Creative Writing is the ideal guide to what you should expect, what will be expected of you and how you can get the most from your course.
It clearly and concisely outlines:
* the contexts for creative writing courses, explaining where the subject has come from and why that matters
* the content, structure and delivery of the courses, helping you to understand how your course will be shaped, what you will be asked to do and why
* the skills you will develop, from self-discipline and time management through to the organisation of ideas, 'reading as a writer' and editing
