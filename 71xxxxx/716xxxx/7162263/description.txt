As the years pass and successive police chiefs hold office, it seems that the mysterious unsolved crimes have been swept under the carpet.
But in 1962, the day of reckoning draws near as Billy Dee williams, portraying Tyler Watts, Delano's first black police chief, becomes intrigued by the old case and the dark shadow it cast over the town. Unintimidated, despite threats, he perserveres to ultimately uncover the scandalous secret behind the forty year old mystery that is CHIEFS.
