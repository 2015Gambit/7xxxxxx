Live Magic is a live compilation album by British rock band Queen. It was recorded at various 1986 live shows during the European Magic Tour and released on December 1, 1986. However, it was not released in the United States until August 1996. It received strong criticism by fans, due to the heavy editing of many songs. For example, the opera section was removed from "Bohemian Rhapsody", the second verse was removed from "Tie Your Mother Down", and both "Is This the World We Created...?" and "We Are the Champions" were reduced to one verse and chorus. In July 2004, Q magazine listed Live Magic as one of the top five disappointing live albums from usually great acts.

Most of the performances were recorded at Knebworth Park on the 9th August 1986 (the band's last ever concert with its original line-up).
