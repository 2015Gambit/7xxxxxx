The 1960s, 70s and 80s saw the evolution of a new type of radio broadcasting around the British Isles. With the BBC being considered as a dinosaur completely out of touch with the younger generation, a number of brave souls decided to do something about it. 'Pirate Radio' was born. 

These programs document a number of these shipboard broadcasters in international waters. Follow each one from humble beginnings to almost hysterical success with British teens to their eventual demise at the hands of the British government. Also, we follow the BBCs answer to the problem with BBC Local (FM) radio.
