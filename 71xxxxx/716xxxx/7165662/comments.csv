,CCALLUMM,2012-04-08T15:31Z,@ showitoff Railworks is nothing to do with microsoft train simulator 
,roblovestastytrace,2012-04-08T18:24Z,"Hi tpb_4_ever, may be a silly question as you haven't uploaded them, but do you have the updated (TS2012) versions of the Armstrong Powerhouse scenario packs?"

,Conn000,2012-04-09T12:42Z,"Hi tpb_4_ever,
When I try to load any of the scenarios, It gives me error messages saying that it couldn't load rolling stock. Am I installing it wrong?"
,Thootje17,2012-04-09T16:21Z,"@Conn000
I think you are using a licensed copy of railworks, on which most of the illegally downloaded add-ons won't work. Use a skidrow copy and they will work perfect!"
,Conn000,2012-04-09T17:42Z,"@Thootje17
I think I'll just buy the route then as I have a lot of bought legal steam addons"
,voltrix128,2012-04-09T21:18Z,"@Conn000 You can use the addons you bougth on the skidrow version.
