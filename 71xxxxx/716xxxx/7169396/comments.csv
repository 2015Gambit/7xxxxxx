,gtw1212,2012-04-08T18:19Z,"tbh... the quality of all these American Pie: Reunion torrents is terribad.

Can't complain though as it's free and it doesn't come out in the UK till May."
,foxie93,2012-04-08T19:06Z,"gtw1212, 

That's because every release this far uses the same video source, the russian cam that is.. so some scenes are cut and it's some missing parts of the movie here and there."
[V],.BONE.,2012-04-08T21:59Z,^^ got it spot on this is it til new source they are all same just put threw different filters but you know the saying about polishing a turd :) 
,spifkitten99,2012-04-08T23:00Z,"Shut the fuck up about how you can't complain cuz it's free. It has no relevance that it's free.

Tell us about the fucking quality.

,benspocket,2012-04-08T23:54Z,"well i dont see my comments come up anymore maybe i said to much about the people uploading  just to take up space, well so far i have downloaded 3 of these  and none of them will even open up always missing something cant even pick a good uploader on this movir think i`ll just wait for a decent uploader to upload this movie"
,ShakeJunt,2012-04-09T01:20Z,Someone needs to ban these faggots who keep posting their shitty websites in the comments section on every damn torrent. Fuck you and your foreign websites!
,mcgillj,2012-04-09T01:45Z,"I am guessing this is similar to the one I have. the video for a CAM.. solid 6 in a/v.. nothing special but definitely WATCHABLE. But I will say there is roughly 15 minutes MISSING from the film. There are odd choppy cuts.. and just entire parts of scenes MISSING. Honestly. nothing you can't kind of figure out on your own, but still.. This is not the complete film."

I've gotta call bullshit on that you muppet.

http://www.odeon.co.uk/fanatic/film_times/s106/Lincoln/

Odeon says 2nd May.

Or how about IMDb?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605630/

Oh look! they say 2nd May too.
In fact, the only place I've found where they've said 6th Apr, they've taken the date from wikipedia... retard.

In fact, cineworld still says 'coming soon'
Don't troll me fucktard, and don't bullshit that you watched it in the UK in the cinema."
,gtw1212,2012-04-09T21:36Z,"My comment wasn't showing.
