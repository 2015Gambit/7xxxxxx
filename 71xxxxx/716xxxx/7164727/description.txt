Nocturne is a 3rd person action survival horror game for the PC, released October 1999.

Nocturne's gameplay is broken up into four independent Acts. Each Act is a self-contained campaign that can be selected as soon as the game begins. Although the four Acts can be played in any order, they progress in chronological order from first to fourth, so some minor details, such as which agents join or leave the Spookhouse organization as time passes, are easiest to see when the Acts are played in order.

Act I: Dark Reign of the Vampire King

Act II: Tomb of the Underground God

Act III: Windy City Massacre

Act IV: The House on the Edge of Hell


Xpadder with Xbox360 & generic PS3 controller profiles included.
Scanned with Comodo IS, compressed with 7zip.

PICS.
