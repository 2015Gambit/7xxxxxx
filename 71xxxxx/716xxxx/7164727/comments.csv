First google and download a file called Tridx8.dll, copy that file into the game folder, then go to the SYSTEM folder within the game folder and open the nocturne file, find the line that looks like this; rendererDLLPath=tridx7.dll 
now change the tridx7 to tridx8, this takes the game from being rendered with the directx7 dll file to directx 8.
