,Stinky86,2012-04-06T06:23Z,"Thanks for uploading.  Video is rough, audio doesn't sync in places.  But its watchable.  Thanks for getting something up for people to watch.

Any chance of The Real Housewives of Orange County?  You were doing it at one point but have stopped. :("
,HHHarper,2012-04-06T06:50Z,Thanks as always. The quality is a little iffy this week but it's still by far and away the highest quality rip available here. ;)
,whmxtra,2012-04-06T08:11Z,"I quote from my torrent description:

""Neither are my rips or HQ but they will do till my sources get them up and I can do my own rips for you guys.""

Often I find LQ versions which I upload for those that can't wait to see what happened. Then I upload an HQ version when my sources have it and I can do my own rip.

FYI that's actually already happened, I just haven't uploaded the HQ version yet, will do it shortly.

As for Real Housewives of OC, some others were covering it here and my source for this is kinda random so I figured not much point. I'll see what's on here and what my sources have but it's hard to do this show when there's almost no source out there for it and mine don't cover it consistantly."
,whmxtra,2012-04-06T08:46Z,"HQ verison up, still looking for a good full version of Miami"
,whmxtra,2012-04-07T09:43Z,"Regarding Real Housewives of OC, seems like it's already over, new one about Vancouver wives has started, and it's already here in TP, just search for Real Housewives of Vancouver"
