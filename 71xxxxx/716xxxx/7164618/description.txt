"There is nothing more dangerous in literature...than a character with no author." 


Psychology, poetry, philosophy, linguistics and social sciences blend together with the arts, as the author partners the reader through a disturbing, thought-provoking journey in which education, relationships, religion, politics and social behavior are stripped down to their bare foundations and de-constructed through the eyes of a man who has no name, no face and absolutely nothing to gain. 

A social activist who has always preferred anonymity over recognition, The author's name is not showcased on the book's cover, or within its content and his identity is only known to the Copyright Services and the legal departments which represent him. 

The Unwords take full advantage of their author's lack of identity and almost inhuman levels of introspection, as they elaborate on serious, contemporary social and moral issues with relentless honesty and uncompromising ethics, presenting to the reader a new alternative way of thinking and an unprecedented view of the society we live in.
