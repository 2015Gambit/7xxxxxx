,newworldodour,2012-04-15T00:23Z,"V4/A6 Video dark & blurry, Audio is a little better than video but still quite poor, I have seen a lot of cams & I would not even call this 'good for a cam', 

If you really can't wait then...bloody learn to wait.
Even a film as mediocre as this deserves being watched in better quality,thanks for the effort .BONE."
