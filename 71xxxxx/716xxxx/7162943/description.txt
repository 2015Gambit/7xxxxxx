Randy Rhoads Tribute (2007)




This live double album, released five years after Randy Rhoads' death, showcases a hard rock guitarist whose all-around ability was arguably second only to Eddie Van Halen. Osbourne leads his best band lineup through the entire Blizzard repertoire, plus a few Diary and Sabbath numbers. Of special note are Rhoads' unaccompanied solos, leaving no doubts about his virtuosity, and the studio outtakes of his short solo piece, "Dee." Rhoads' entire output is absolutely essential for guitar freaks, but he sounds even better live than in the studio.
