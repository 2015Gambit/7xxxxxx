,carlos140,2012-04-07T02:46Z,"Hey, what's with the 99.3 upload?  That's just cruel!
SEED, please!"
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-04-07T12:57Z,"How typical... Neither of you 2 dipsh*ts have uploaded a single torrent, yet you're complaining as if you feel the community owes you something.

Furthermore, I don't spend every waking moment on the internet, so try to learn a little f**king patience. Don't forget that you're getting this for free. If you don't want to wait, then buy the f**king album."

,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-04-08T00:17Z,"....or yet another non-uploading member could just spam the sh*t out of me.

This album is awesome and deserves to be heard, and frankly I couldn't give 2 sh*ts whether you get it from me or someplace else."
,FuckFuckFuck,2012-04-09T08:37Z,"rage on BaronVonWatermelon, rage on haha!"
,FuckFuckFuck,2012-04-09T09:00Z,"BaronVonWatermelon don't ever upload another torrent and nobody will care.

Life is too short, don't waste it on being just another internet tough guy bashing on your keyboard.

Furthermore, you suck. I look forward to your next shitty anger filled comment. 

Please reply and give us all another laugh and tell us to fuck off or even better....just delete all your crappy torrents that nobody give a shit about.

game over cocksmoker lol"
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-04-10T08:43Z,"Whatever you say, mate... I'll not be engaging in this conversation any further. "
,Raptor25,2012-04-10T16:40Z,"COULD YOU PLEASE RESEED????

I only have like 1% to go, and cant get it from anyone else and all other torrents of this album either are unseeded or fake.

Cheers mate!"
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-04-10T18:35Z,"Will do, Raptor."
,gkar_falcon,2012-04-12T06:25Z,http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7179223/No_Plans  all tracks are at 320kpbs and fully seeded
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-04-13T00:08Z,"As I have previously stated:

I don't care from who or where you obtain this album, just be sure to get it and enjoy it.

P.S. Maybe actually try uploading something once in a while and giving back to the community instead of bitching about seeds, quality, etc...?"
,saints66,2012-04-13T04:54Z,"One week now and still at 99.3% Could it be that the original upload was incomplete? Shame, as the Barnesy version, from Itunes, of the last track is different to the CD version, I believe. "
,BaronVonWatermelon,2012-04-13T11:55Z,"@saints66

I'm sorry, mate. Maybe I messed up somewhere with my original upload. I'm not sure how though, my utorrent reads 15 seeders and my ratio is 25.9.

I may just have to re-upload the whole thing."
