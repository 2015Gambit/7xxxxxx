ReleaseNotes:

Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces is the fourth studio album by South African
post-grunge band Seether. The album was released in South Africa and Switzerland on
October 19, 2007, and released worldwide on October 23, 2007. The cover artwork was
designed by David Ho, the same artist who designed the Vicious Delicious cover for
Infected Mushroom. The covers apparently display the same character: Candice the
Ghost. Three singles, "Fake It", "Rise Above This" and "Breakdown" have been released from the album with all three being top 10 singles, the former two reaching the top position on several Billboard charts, despite negative reviews, scoring a 39% on Metacritic. The album was reissued in 2009, featuring a fourth single, a cover of George Michael's "Careless Whisper", the final single from the album. It is the first Seether album to reach gold status in their home country, South Africa.
