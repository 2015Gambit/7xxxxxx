which I'm sure a few million people are currently using..
Also the EZ-Activator is discontinued and the tool in this torrent is intended to replace the old tool.. The old forum topic for ""EZ-Activator"" is locked and the author has stated that support and updates are now only for the new tool.
No offence, but i would advise people get their cracks from the original source when possible..
Here is the link to the release page for the discontinued tool

And here is the link to the official release page for the new tool (same as torrent)
http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/28669-Microsoft-Toolkit-Official-KMS-Solution-for-Windows-and-Office-2010

Also that forum is the same place that the ""Windows Loader"" by DAZ is released at..
