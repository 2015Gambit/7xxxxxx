,ImSoJaded,2012-04-09T09:59Z,"54 seed, 287 peer - but I cannot connect to any of the peers, and availability is like 0.001? Wtf?"
,mantikor777,2012-04-09T16:30Z,"Yeah, what ImSoJaded said - there is no doubt some problem.  I've been trying to download for 5 hours now and cannot connect to any seeders but am connected to a bunch of peers with only 0.1% of the upload.  It is screwed up somehow."
,mantikor777,2012-04-10T11:34Z,24 hours later I have yet to download even 1%.  I appreciate your trying to upload this but it is not working.
,mantikor777,2012-04-21T08:46Z,10 days later I finally have all but 2% of book five and it has been stuck there for the past 3 days - such a disappointment.
