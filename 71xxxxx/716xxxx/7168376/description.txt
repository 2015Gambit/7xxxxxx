Deadeye Dick was an American alternative rock trio that was formed in New 
Orleans, Louisiana.

The band, which consisted of vocalist/guitarist Caleb Guillotte, bassist Mark 
Adam Miller, and drummer Billy Landry, was formed in 1991 and took their 
name from a Kurt Vonnegut novel. The group built up a loyal following touring 
the Southeast. They self-produced their first album even though they still 
had not landed a record deal. A song titled "New Age Girl" off of this self-
published record became popular regionally and earned airplay in New 
Orleans and Atlanta. After receiving this airplay, the band landed a record 
deal with the independent label Ichiban Records. Ichiban released the group's 
debut album A Different Story in 1994. After its release, the song "New Age 
Girl" was selected for inclusion on the Dumb and Dumber feature film 
soundtrack. The publicity from the film caused the song to become a national 
hit, peaking at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March, 1995. The band 
released their second album, Whirl, in 1995 but were unable to reproduce the 
success produced by "New Age Girl". Deadeye Dick later disbanded. Caleb 
Guillotte and Mark Miller continue to remain active in the local New Orleans 
music scene as producers.
