[V],joshua13,2012-04-07T01:27Z,"about ""Crucifixion in the Ancient World and the Folly of the Message of the Cross"" you seem to have judged on book by it's cover. misled by the word ""folly"" int it's title. this amazon reviewer says it well  - "" When Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 1:18 that the message of the cross is `folly' to those who are perishing, modern readers don't fully understand what that means. Hengel's work surveys material on crucifixion from all parts of the ancient world. In doing so he reveals that for the people of the ancient world,.. crucifixion was not something you treated lightly or glossed over. It was absolutely obscene and wasn't referred to in polite company. That Christians could claim that the Son of God was crucified would have been not just outrageous, but offensive.... it is helpful in restoring our sense of just what an astonishing thing God has done through Christ. In a world where the symbol of a cross has become quite commonplace, and even something we might wear as jewellery, this book helps to change your perspective."""
