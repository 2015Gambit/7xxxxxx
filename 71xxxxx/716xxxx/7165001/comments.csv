The avg ""Virus warning"" can be ignore since it`s just a crack varning, but the one at install when Malwarebytes warns about is a serious threat. 

Hey gansuk, you should atleast try your own uploads!

I Apologize for my bad English. 
There you have it!"
[V],gansuk,2012-04-07T10:38Z,"""yawn"" people like you got nothing better to do.

[ False Positives ]                                           

In Some Cases Some Of Our Tools May Get Detected As Suspicious
Or As A Virus By Some Antivirus Software. This Is Also The    
Case With Some Cracks/No-CDs. We Assure You This Is A False   
Possitive And All Our Files Are Clean. If Any Of These Files  
Are Deleted The Chances Are The Game Will Not Start Or Will   
Function Incorectly.

,ivanhoe68,2012-04-07T10:54Z,"Well yawn at you to, i get a lot of false positives, and trust me i know what im talking about! This one on the other hand is not a false positive, i have 50 + downloaded games on my comp, and a lot of them is Kaos releases, but this one is something else. You are going to loose your skull! 

Just to let you know this game is the first one that got my Malwarebytes to react. "
,ivanhoe68,2012-04-07T10:59Z,"You know you can even ""quarantine"" the first file that malwarebytes warns about, and the game still installs fine, that means that the file that was moved to quarantine was not needed. INFECTED!!"
[V],gansuk,2012-04-07T11:59Z,and what was this file called?
,ShadoRyu,2012-04-07T14:09Z,did someone have problem with save ? cause when i quit and relunch the game all my progression are not save. anyone have solution ?
,houseofswing,2012-04-07T17:11Z,"I seriously Dont understand why every day I come on here and someone is always saying this has a virus or that gave me a warning i dont even use an anti-virus and i havent had a problem in years downloading all kinds of stuff, games, movies, books, no virus ever if i just look for the trusted or VIP. I guess it will continue forever, in like 3 minutes some dude will come on here and literally make the exact post Ivanhoe68 did on another trusted source game"
[V],gansuk,2012-04-07T18:45Z,"yeah your best off sticking to the users with skulls, the gansuk account has been a trusted source for kaos downloads for many years without any issues. this release is on many public and private torrent sites and ivanhoe68 is the only person to complain what tells you alot lol."
,eaglee955,2012-04-07T21:13Z,"Thanx gunsuk.

[T],PirateBoy,2012-04-08T03:22Z,Great upload guys. You guys are on fire. +1 from me. Back to back great uploads. :)
,Cerebral222,2012-04-08T05:04Z,"Thanks gansuk, game works well. The false positive is on the rld.dll in the binary folder, but you DO need that file to play, it's non malignant though, so +1 from me, Cheers."
,szkyline,2012-04-11T18:52Z,"I found this solution.First you must install the game in the default directory C:Program FilesTopGun â&#x20AC;&#x201C; Hardlock.Right click on the topgun.exe, open properties compatibilty tab and enable the compatibility mode and change it to WINDOWS XP SP3, and tick RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR, click Ok.
Run the game as adminitrator ,now the Savegame works fine for me.
I hope it works for you."
,ahmedkmshesh,2012-04-15T17:32Z,"i did exactly what u said but when i open topgun.exe ....... it says
the dynamic library ""rld.dll"" failed to load please confirm that : 
1) the file was copied over the same folder as the cracked executable.
2)the antivirus software is not false-detecting the file ( in which case white-list the folder/file)
............... so please guys if any one have a solution for this .....he can tell me"
,ahmedkmshesh,2012-04-15T20:30Z,come on guys ....... please .. can anyone respond to my problem ?!
,ahmedkmshesh,2012-04-18T09:13Z,"@ gansuk
why there is no one answering me ?!"
,szkyline,2012-04-19T14:37Z,U must ignore the rld file in ure antivirus program!
,ahmedkmshesh,2012-04-21T00:04Z,Ok i did so and the problem is gone but when trying to enter the top gun hardlock.exe nothing happen !!! Sorry for bothering guys but i really want to try this game...
,ikehendrix,2012-04-22T19:21Z,At first: This is a great game and a great KAOS release! Unfortunately I have a different problem: Everything worked fine but I tried to change the language. Since that the game doesnÂ´t work anymore even if I delete all data and reinstall the game. How can I fix that issue? I love this game and desperately want to play on... Please help me!
,Timbo6669,2012-05-08T00:11Z,"Thanks Gansuk, trying todownload but no seeds...:-(Thanks anyway, i know your always trusted but man, don't think i'll be able to get it, no matter how bad i wanted it."
,Majestik1,2012-07-14T21:42Z,"HEY!!! ivanhoe68

until you use professional grade A/V like ESET (v.4 or v.5) shut your fucking mouth.

and besides THAT you OBVIOUSLY don't know FUCK about 'False Positives'

I haven't even downloaded this program, but I know you are a wannabe loudmouth punk ass poser know-it-all bitch.

lick my sac working your way up to my freedom, and i MIGHT think about letting you swallow my load."
