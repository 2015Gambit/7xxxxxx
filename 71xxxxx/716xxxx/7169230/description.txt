Review
"This book is comprehensive, students like to read it, color enhancements are great. This is a textbook first and then can be used as a reference later."

"It's well-written, has good review questions, and good instructor resources. Also, the CertBlaster test prep exams from Student Downloads are an excellent resource."

"I like the step by step approach with complete images. This means that in lecture I can easily brush past these section and give shorter demonstrations because the text covers the material so well. I like the detail on other OSes in the appendix. The hands-on exercises provide the starting point for great labs without having to purchase an additional book."

"I love the fact that the software and hardware texts are complementary. When students take the sequence with me it feels almost like a year long course rather than two disconnected courses. There is enough in common between software and hardware texts that students feel totally comfortable with the 2nd text at the start but there really isn't much useless overlap between the two that it feels like a "rerun". The texts are written such that a complete beginner to the subject can understand yet the more experienced students learn as well. Great balance!"
