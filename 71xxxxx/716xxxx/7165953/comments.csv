Oh and PS3, X360, and mobile device users don't need XviD.

Those all support that improved x264 advanced video coding (AVC).

That is why scene opted to use x264.
A lot more devices support it than people realize.

x264 does not mean MKV.
MKV is a container.
x264 is a format.
They aren't the same things.
x264 works in MKV and MP4.
MP4 plays on those game consoles and mobile devices."

[V],psspss,2012-04-07T07:45Z,"i dont care TNE.. for fook sake

i want to know why ps3 is so sucky for xvid

seems very picky to me.. VLC and PC plays everything

gamers LOL they love their device with DRM

[V],psspss,2012-04-07T16:04Z,"so if anyone knows what PS3 xvid features throws it let me know so I can try to make it work for pc and ps3 as I havent a clue as I dont own one and cant experiment surely its not framerate less then 25 that some claim

monster man is interesting the face off is more
a FX competition when this is more a real job
following how the make it and work with the camera and film makers so its more a doco
when the other is more reality"
