For anyone who's never read Paolo, you're missing a brilliant writer on subjects that we're just beginning to need to know about.  Wonder what our food future might look like under Monsanto, Archer-Daniels-Midland and Cargill's corporate manipulations?  And I mean World-wide, not just in the US.  Read The Windup Girl.  SOON!"

Any Sandra Brown novels you can find would be great - can only find Tough Customer and Lethal on TBB...
Can you help?

Many Thanks for all you do!! You rock KK!

Best always,
