THE MOVIE...


A small group of Catholics led by an ailing priest
believe that Satan intends to become man, just as God
did in the person of Jesus. The writings of a
possessed mental patient lead them to Peter Kelson,
a writer who studies serial killers. They think it's his
body Satan will occupy. The youngest in the group, a teacher
named Maya Larkin, goes to Peter to investigate
further and to convince him to believe in the possibility of
Evil incarnate. Other signs come to him as he and Maya them
take a journey full of strange occurrences, self-discovery, and an
ultimate showdown.
