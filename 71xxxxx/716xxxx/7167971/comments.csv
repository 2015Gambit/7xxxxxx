,foxie93,2012-04-08T02:53Z,"This is the same video source as the others, which is cut and it's missing around 23 min from the full movie."

,humboldt46,2012-04-08T04:57Z,and that stupid queen song they keep playing!
,HolyDuFF2,2012-04-08T10:06Z,"foxie93 you say it's the same video source as the other TS versions. Then why is it bigger? Do they just convert then? Anyway, the music. Isn't it supposed to be there? And TS is TeleSync and means that it's filmed on a cinema with a digital camera and an alternate audio source like the once they have in the chairs sometimes to avoid laughter and ""music"" disturbing the recording. So i think the music is supposed to be there. Anyway, why is it cut if it was recorded on a cinema? I don't get it... Uploader please answer."
