After several Youtube excursions (check out the links below), the original Riff Brothers are back to take on a blast from our past: 3 Ninjas! Three middle school kids, who were trained in the mystical arts of ninjitsu by their grandpa (the late and great Victor Wong) become entangled in a kidnapping plot. Can they fight their way to freedom? Will their ninja-grampa come to their rescue? Well you just have to watch the movie to find out...

... or watch the movie as Riff Brothers Chris and Jordan tear it a new a$$hole! Though we loved this movie growing up, it has admittedly not aged too well and was ripe for a good riffing. And, as an added bonus, besides the usual barrage of bad puns, off-color quips, and scathing remarks aimed towards the movie, you'll get to hear both of the commentators take jabs at each other.

On the technical side of things: The video is dual audio, so you can turn us off and enjoy some early 90's nostalgia. Video quality is OK; this isn't a movie that warranted any TLC from its parent company, but it is definitely watchable. The audio was a bit of a b*tch to pull together, but you should easily be able to hear our commentary and the film itself. All in all, this is the best I could do with what I had, and hopefully you enjoy it!
