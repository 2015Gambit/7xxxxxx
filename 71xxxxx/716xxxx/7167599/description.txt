Review
"The Cambridge Companion to Herodotus is am odel of its kind and its editors should be proud. We are all in their debt." - John Dillery, University of Virginia

Book Description
At a time when the ancient Greeks' knowledge of the past relied on orally transmitted memories, Herodotus was a pioneering historical practitioner who explored the interplay of myth and history and the role of narrative in history. In this volume a team of experts discusses Herodotus' Histories and their influence. Topics covered include their relationship to Homer, their view of the natural world, their methodology and the Herodotean narrator. Each chapter presents the most up-to-date scholarship on Herodotus and offers a guide to further reading on the subject.
