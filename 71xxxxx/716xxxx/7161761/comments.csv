,FRDS,2012-04-13T04:00Z,"Can someone help me out here? I've downloaded this and I have a copy of the game. When I unzip this ""wrapper"" my computer thinks it's a copy of the actual game or something and says it's like 6GB. How do I use this with an actual copy of the game?"

,Kniteed,2012-09-03T06:28Z,btw this is only the wrapper guys! Download the actual game elsewhere. But you'll need this to do it.
