I have called all seasons "The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes", even though the series changed it to "The Return of Sherlock Holmes", etc. The episodes are named and numbered according to the episode guide at www.tv.com. If this doesn't agree with you, they are easy, if tedious, to rename.

Yes, it's a big torrent. Some episodes are quite grainy and a lower bitrate would have been detrimental to the quality.
