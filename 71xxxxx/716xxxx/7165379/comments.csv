,warriorone1,2012-04-16T02:21Z,Is it correct info that files ripped from PAL DVDs can be played on any computer using VLC? Thank you
,Tourniquest,2012-04-16T20:06Z,"Yes, it'll work just fine."
,duranachief,2012-04-21T22:19Z,"can anyone upload srt subtitles for this? samsung led does not play subtitles from an mkv file. it needs external srt files. i know that srt files can be extracted, but if the uploader would do everyone another favour and upload the subtitles, it would be great. by the way, the upload quality is very very good."
,debris-k,2012-05-08T16:27Z,"@duranachief  re: .srt subs, you can snag them all from this old torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6251706/sherlock_holmes_episodes_all
I have 90+% of them and I'm seeding (and I never even wanted them, even)"
,duranachief,2012-06-28T12:25Z,"guys please seed, otherwise this excellent torrent will die. dont be so selfish. i will seed this for at least 6 months."
