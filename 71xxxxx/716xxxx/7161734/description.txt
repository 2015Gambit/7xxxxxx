This is the Live Album from Deep Purple during the Mark I lineup. I love the MArk I line-up to death, maybe even more than the MArk II line up :). Anyways, couldn't find a torrent with this, so made one myself. This is the only 'decent' sounding live album I could find of the Mark I lineup, if anyone knows of any others, please leave a comment about it :D
