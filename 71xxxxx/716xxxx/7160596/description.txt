MegaTV of Greece recently filmed a two part documentary called Soldiers With
No Name, covering the rise of hacktivism as an international political force.
The documentary was aired in Greece in two parts.  The first part is about
Anonymous, what they are, what they do, what they've done, and some of the
repercussions of their operations.  The main focus of these documentaries is
on Anonymous' actions in Greece but other countries seem to be mentioned.
A number of information security experts were interviewed (their names are
unknown but if you really want to know you can zoom in on the credits and read
them) along with someone claiming to be Commander X, who was raided and
subsequently went on the run.  In the second episode a number of Greek Anons
were interviewed about their activities (in Greek, I've no idea what they're
saying).  The second episode appears to be more of the same though some
members of Telecomix were also interviewed to give a second viewpoint and to
provide information about what took place in Egypt, Tunisia, and Syria.  They
talk a little about their actions and why they do what they do.

Much of the audio is in Greek because it was made by a Greek television
network.  Most of the interviewees are speaking English and are subtitled in
Greek (hardcoded).  On-screen captions are in Greek.

File format: FLV, use VLC to play back.
