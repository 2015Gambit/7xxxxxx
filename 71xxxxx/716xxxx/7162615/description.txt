Conrad, a former Police officer was one of the few survivors in the Red Zone. However, he came across Ami Levin, a young boy who believed that god was punishing them for their misdeeds and Marcie, an art student. Conrad did not dare approach Blackwatch as he had witnessed the fate of those who had surrendered.

Conrad took his chance to escape when Blackwatch was busy killing the infected. He led Marcie and Ami to a Blackwatch base hoping to commandeer one of the helicopters. The trio managed to get inside one of Blackwatch's helicopters by hiding themselves inside a cargo crate. Conrad tried to force the pilot to fly them out of New York, however, the fight between them resulted with a crash in the Yellow Zone.
