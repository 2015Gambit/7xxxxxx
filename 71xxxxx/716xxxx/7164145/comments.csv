Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 13 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc"

There are enough seeders, trust me. You are not connectable (seeders or leechers) Try to download the torrent from publichd site or update your torrent client."

Happy Easter and keep up the good work! :-)"

Do you still want my enocded version? I think is in vain after this encode. I'm at 60% of it and my CPU laptop is just red hot. I didn't know a 5:21h movie can take so long!"

,sgleder,2012-04-15T17:58Z,"@Gabe
