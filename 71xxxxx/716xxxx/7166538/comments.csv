,DarthBubba,2012-04-08T19:47Z,"You label this file ""Kaspersky Daily Activation Keys 2012,""  yet your first instruction is: ""Open Kaspersky 2011 License Manager.""

Do you guys even bother to try out your own uploads?  Do you even READ your own instructions?"
,silmany,2012-04-09T15:54Z,I read all instructions...but how many day left for this key man?
,ya7hu,2012-04-09T19:28Z,"@silmany
 it's not for mobile. 30 days.

@DarthBubba 
Its mentioned as ""Kaspersky 2011"" because its the same method used in Kaspersky 2012 as in 2011.

Thank you for your feedback..:)"
