[T],bobnjeff,2012-04-07T15:10Z,in case any one wonders or cares i will be doing a 720p & a 1080p encode of each remux
[T],tr108,2012-04-07T18:41Z,"Thanks for this! I've always wanted this in HD.

I'm looking forward to whatever further 720/1080 encodes you do for this and the other Bruce Lee films. So, thanks for the update. Peeps do care. :)

I might actually do some encodes myself since I have the CBS Home Video DVD versions of these films with English dubs. They're only mono audio, and I normally HATE dubs, but considering all of the Golden Harvest films are dubs anyway (it's cheaper not to shoot on-set sound), it's better than nothing. After all, you're not hearing Bruce's voice either way.

If you want the Eng dub from the DVD, bobnjeff, PM on SuprBay, I'm techrod108. And thanks again!"
