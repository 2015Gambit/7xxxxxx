(Thank you for all your efforts by the way. It is appreciated.)"
,tretsim,2012-04-06T05:52Z,"Nevermind, the rars aren't named right, but the file is The Mentalist. Ignore my previous comment.
Thank you for the upload!"

,eljaa,2012-04-08T05:30Z,"@tretsim That's how Dimension names them...something like ""Psych without the humor"" or something...which is not a far off description...nonetheless the copy is flawless...
