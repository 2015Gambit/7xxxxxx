Yes, this is the first time I've ever uploaded a .torrent; but I assure you this is the real deal.

This file was sitting on Notch.net (a public directory located originally at http://notch.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dcpu.jar). I managed to snag it before Notch took it down.

It is described as a testbed for the DCPU emulation that will eventually appear in the "game".

This is not a runnable game, just merely a .jar with bits of code and some rough screencaps. It's good for snooping around and seeing Notch's messy source code.

However, this is the "GAME" that the fat greedy neckbeard already wants you to pay monthly for.

Enjoy.
