,TheOrangeWolf,2012-04-26T00:04Z,"The installation instructions are a little... vague as to how to install the actual game so if anyone other then me was a little confused

You first have to install the file ""「うみねこのなく頃に」ＥＰ４"" MDF (I used applocal, it worked fine)

Then execute ""[WH]_Umineko_English_v4.4"" and install to the 7th expansion folder to patch it.

THEN Install ""(C79)(同人ゲーム)[07th Expansion]うみねこのなく頃に散Ep8～Twilight of the Golden Witch～"" (Also used Applocal, whatever floats your boat)

THEN Execute ""[WH]_Umineko_EP8_English_v4.1""

And Done.

Love the torrent and this game/novel though, thanks a bunch Witch!"
,TheOrangeWolf,2012-04-27T04:16Z,"Also, does this cover all the arcs?"
,WitchOfRiddles,2012-05-18T03:03Z,The English Patches covers all 8 arcs of the entire Umineko Story to the very end! I apologize about my vagueness about how to install. I just hope it was explained well enough for anyone that dont know how is able to get it installed.
,mysterymaniac,2012-05-18T13:21Z,What is App Local? Do I Have to change the settings of my computer? Does this work with Windows 7 Home Premium? 
,mysterymaniac,2012-05-23T03:22Z,"umm hello...

,akoaysmurf99,2012-07-30T06:40Z,"Great upload!

BTW, any chance you'll upload all the tweaks for the ps3 version? the links provided for in umitweak wiki takes forever to DL(damn you RS). The MF link is not even updated."
