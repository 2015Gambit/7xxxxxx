SYNOPSIS:  
One of Alfred Hitchcocks darkest and most compelling suspense films tells the story of police detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart), who has a crippling fear of heights -- and an all-consuming obsession with a married woman. When an old friend asks him to tail his wife (Kim Novak), Scottie is drawn into a vortex of deceit and murder. But thats only the beginning as a mesmerizing score draws Scottie to the films haunting final shot.
