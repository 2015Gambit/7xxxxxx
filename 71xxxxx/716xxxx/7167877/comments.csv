""No french sub Auge !?"". It doesn't have spanish subtitles either, just english."
,Jesus_Christ,2012-09-11T08:55Z,"Auge, another great upload, but one question.  Is this version Anamorphic widescreen, or the old letterboxed widescreen version?  I ask because I have the letterboxed version and am looking for Anamorphic.  Hopefully you know what I'm asking."
