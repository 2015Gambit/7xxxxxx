,BossBadger,2012-04-07T06:57Z,Lol what was the purpose of downloading my torrent and then reuploading it?
,ESVRIO,2012-04-10T16:20Z,"@BossBadger maybe because he knew he'd get more seeds than you, sharing is caring :)"
,BossBadger,2012-04-10T22:11Z,That's retarded because if there was just one then all the seeds would be on one torrent combined...
,cowboywithoutjob,2012-04-15T03:22Z,Last track is missing 30 seconds!
,BossBadger,2012-04-22T18:09Z,"Yes this torrent is missing parts in almost all of the tracks.
