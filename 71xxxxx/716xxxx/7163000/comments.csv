http://x264.nl/tvx2642011-2.nfo

Unraring only takes 2 minutes. You dont like rar's ? Download from another uploader, but rar's are more trusted than no rar's. Rules of 720p scene groups:

- Releases must be packed in RAR file format
- Rars must be in multiples of 50 MB, no more than 101 files (.rar-.r99)
if using old-style naming, or 99 (.part01.rar-.part99.rar) if using new-style naming. 1MB = 1,000,000 bytes
