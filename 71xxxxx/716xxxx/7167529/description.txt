From the Infowars web site:

Alex talks about how the Obama administration, its supporters, and the establishment media are engaged in a transparent effort to whip up racial tension over the Trayvon Martin shooting in a bid to chill Second Amendment rights and polarize the American people as part of an election stunt. Alex also takes on the latest news, including an Arizona bill that will outlaw "offensive" language on the internet and Homeland Security's targeting of anti-abortion activists.
