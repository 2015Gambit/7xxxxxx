From the author of Lemon! , Extra Lemon! and Splat! comes this new sports mini-compendium of gobsmackingly stupid and jaw-droppingly awful sporting moments.

In Choke! , Tony Davis tracks the train wrecks of sports from around world: the 'unbackable' favourites who managed to lose the unlosable, the cerebrally challenged competitors who decked the ref, bit their opponents, or simply burst into tears and couldn't continue, and the fans who spectacularly interfered and changed everything.

There are fantastically unsuccessful cheats too, plus players and umpires who pocketed a fee for the right result, entire teams that took a dive and bizarre moments involving unexpected wildlife.

All the infamously legendary moments are here, including Greg Norman's US Open choke, Bradman's duck, and Hopoarte's finger. With photos, lists and breakout boxes, and full of Davis's trademark wry wit, Choke! will have sports lovers laughing so hard they'll, um, choke.
