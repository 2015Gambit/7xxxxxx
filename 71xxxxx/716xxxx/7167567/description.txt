From the Infowars web site:

Alex talks with John Perkins, author of the New York Times bestseller Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. Perkins spent the 1970s working as an economic planner for an international consulting firm. In his book he describes how the globalists force the economic hegemony of the banksters, the IMF and World Bank on victim nations in the third world. "Economic hit men are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars," Perkins writes. He is also the author of The Secret History of the American Empire: The Truth About Economic Hit Men, Jackals, and How to Change the World and Hoodwinked: An Economic Hit Man Reveals Why the World Financial Markets Imploded -- and What We Need to Do to Remake Them. 

Alex also talks withjournalist and editor Patrick Henningsen about U.S. soldiers trafficking arms and drugs to DEA agents posing as Los Zetas.
