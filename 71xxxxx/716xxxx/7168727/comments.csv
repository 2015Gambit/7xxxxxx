,conntexxt,2012-04-19T04:45Z,eng. subs http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4519833/oslo-31-august-en
,conntexxt,2012-04-19T05:36Z,the above eng. subs work well. I suggest using vlc player and changing the subs color to yellow so you are able to see them over the swedish subs which are hardcoded.
