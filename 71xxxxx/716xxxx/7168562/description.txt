Lt. John Dunbar, exiled to a remote western Civil War outpost, 

befriends wolves and Indians, making him an intolerable aberration

in the military. 

Lt. John Dunbar is dubbed a hero after he 
accidentally leads Union 
troops to a victory during the Civil War. 
He requests a position 
on the western frontier, but finds it deserted. 
He soon finds out 
he is not alone, but meets a wolf he dubs "Two-socks" 
and a curious 
Indian tribe. Dunbar quickly makes friends with the tribe, 
and 
discovers a white woman who was raised by the Indians. 
He gradually 
earns the respect of these native people, 
and sheds his white-man's ways.
