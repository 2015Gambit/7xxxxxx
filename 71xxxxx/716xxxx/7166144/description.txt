Derek Jarman: Life as art (2004)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401375/

ΓÇ£Impressive new doc tracing JarmanΓÇÖs life and (film) work, as recounted by friends and family. Interviewees include his sister Gaye Temple, his biographer Tony Peake, Tilda Swinton, Ron Peck, Nigel Terry, Peter Tatchell and Simon Fisher Turner. Super 8 interludes convey some of the textures of the films and there are some lovely photo-montages from all periods of his life. It was news to me that he considered both David Bowie and Terry Thomas for the part of Ariel! ItΓÇÖs thorough and engaging and makes an excellent introduction to Saint DerekΓÇÖs worldΓÇ¥ ΓÇô Tom Charity/TIME OUT.
