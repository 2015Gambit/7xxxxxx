Life is hard. ThereΓÇÖs only a limited amount of time in a day, and a finite amount of money you can spend. Is it better to start working right away at a lower rate, or spend more time in school? Should you rent, buy, or invest? While Life Quest 2: Metropoville takes an over-the-top presentation on what one can achieve in a lifetime, its parallels to real life decisions are surprisingly accurate.

Life Quest 2 stars you off with a custom character attempting to leave a bad neighborhood. Fleeing from a life of crime and corruption, you head for Metropoville, the town that promises a 12-step program to the perfect life. Filled with a cast of eccentric characters, Metropoville offers a lot to do, but only a limited time to do it.
