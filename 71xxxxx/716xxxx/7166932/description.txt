:: PLOT :: Tommy and his best mate Rod King (Maskell) celebrate their victory against spurs in the "meet" by going clubbing in the west end, where they meet two women that catch their eye (Tointon and Linfield) and eventually end up back at one of the girls houses to sleep with the women. Tommy wakes up at knife point with the girl's brother holding a knife to his throat thinking he raped her. Rod then comes to his rescue by grabbing a cricket bat and hitting the man over the head with it, allowing the boys to flee. At the same time, Fred (Hassan), the leader of Millwall's firm (The Bushwhackers) is covertly buying drugs from Billy Bright (Harper), an older member of the Headhunters, when he finds out that his brother had been knocked unconscious with a cricket bat. It turns out that Fred is the man's brother, leading to a heated feud between him and Tommy.
