"The Paper Route"

Brick takes a job as a newspaper delivery 
boy from the town's veteran newsman 
(Edward Asner) in order to buy himself 
night vision goggles, and Axl tries to 
convince Sue that a long distance 
relationship will not work between her 
and boyfriend Matt when his family moves 
away from Orson. Meanwhile, Sue tries to 
adjust to wearing a full-on headgear, and 
Frankie discovers that Mike has been 
secretly hoarding batteries for years.
