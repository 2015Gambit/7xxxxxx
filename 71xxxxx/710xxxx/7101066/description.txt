"What We Have is Worth the Pain"

Bridget's search for a missing Malcolm 
leads her to his hotel, where 
security footage shows that Andrew was 
the last person to see him before the 
disappearance. Meanwhile, Juliet links 
the attack on Tessa to someone in her 
family; and Siobhan explains to Henry 
why she faked her death.

Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
