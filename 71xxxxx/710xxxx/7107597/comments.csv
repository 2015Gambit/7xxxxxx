will u be removing the asian subtitles? or wont?))"
,whmxtra,2012-03-17T23:08Z,"I have no option to remove the subtitles, they are hard coded.

Only other sources I could find for this are much lower quality so I opted to stick with the HD version rather than spend bandwidth uploading things twice.

Honestly once you get watching them they really don't stand out all that much. Maybe once they have all aired and I have a better source I might do a whole season 2 torrent with HD versions without the subtitles, but atm I don't have a decent source for that."
