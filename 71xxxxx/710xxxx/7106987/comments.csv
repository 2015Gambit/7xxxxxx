,dude8888,2012-03-23T22:38Z,"IMdB says there are 6 episodes totalling 360 minutes or 6 hours

are there episodes missing in this rip?
The torrent comments say there are three 1.5 hour files (~4.5 hours worth of video)

,Theambassador,2012-03-29T11:32Z,"Amazon says that the run time is 282 Minutes... =4.7 hours. I am downloading awfully slow. Will seed this for months. On a side note, not promoting buying these, but this and WWII in HD together are only $32. I am goign to purchase them for my library. Great Great things to have on hand. "
,zilder,2012-06-21T17:26Z,Wikipedia says it's a 6-part. so why is there only 3 parts? :S
,lattari,2012-06-26T20:31Z,"IMDb usually includes commercial time in their runtime. This has clearly two 45min episodes in each video file, seems to me its all there."
