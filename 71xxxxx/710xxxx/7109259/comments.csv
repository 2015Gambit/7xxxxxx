,Khaled_UAE,2012-03-17T10:25Z,Thank you 
,Khaled_UAE,2012-03-17T10:27Z,PAL ? or region free please :)
,Sath1,2012-03-17T10:48Z,"I have a quick question bro.

I have a PAL 360 with Lt+ 3.0, but this game isnt  Region Free, can I still play it?
Isnt the whole point of modding also goes to play any game from any region?

If not, you think you can get us a Region Free?"
[V],boobsman,2012-03-17T11:01Z,"This game is NTSC/U and can only be played on NTSC/U machines n no the point of modding is not to be able to play games from any region, its to play games n not pay for them! (although you should support the manufacturers if you do enjoy :))

Im have a PAL machine n cannot play this so as soon as another version is release i will upload it :)"
,devilyrage,2012-03-17T11:22Z,is this game work on ntsc-j
,Sath1,2012-03-17T11:30Z,"Aha, thanks for the answer.
Its just so unusual to see YOU upload non Region Free.

I hope Region Free version is uploaded soon :)"
[V],boobsman,2012-03-17T11:42Z,"@ devilyrage abgx says NTSC/U only, feel free to download n test but i don't have an NTSC/J machine so cannot say if it'll work or not :)"
[V],boobsman,2012-03-17T12:09Z,"@ Sath1, these are scene releases i just post what i can, i'd prefer RF but if NTSC is all that's available i'll upload for those who want it :)"
,omegaviper,2012-03-17T12:11Z,"@boobsman how do you answer these retards questions with such patience they are are so dumb and the answers are obvious and right in front of them plus google is built into the upper right corner of the top 3 browsers.  If these people were near me I would kill them or at least beat them unconscious, they are just too dumb."
,reconhell,2012-03-17T12:11Z,On RGH consoles it shouldnt matter right?  All regions work cuz of Jtag?
,host92,2012-03-17T12:13Z,@boobsman- can u check onm abgx and tell us if it will play on ntsc-j
,Sath1,2012-03-17T13:31Z,"@Omegaviper

Because thats how knowledge gets passed on, you ask those who knows.

Stop being a douche and think a little bit before you post a comment like that.
Beat us or kill us? LOL ok Mr random internet person.

Its not because of patience he does it, he does it, its because he has a good and kind personality to HELP others who dont know this. What it is to you and so personal is beyond me, and that is what makes you dumb, not us who asks a legit question.

Again Boobsman, much appreciated for your answers.

"
[V],boobsman,2012-03-17T13:44Z,"@ host92 i've answered that question already, abgx says NTSC/U ONLY!"
,host92,2012-03-17T16:15Z,@boobman- sorry didnt see it and thank you

,95dcmimpapa,2012-03-18T03:41Z,"Works great on NTSU-U LT 2.0
Great game so far! Thank you for the upload."
,sage1210,2012-03-18T04:34Z,"@sath1: it common for Omegaviper. that why out side his bed room he has no friend and always be ignore by others.

who never give not deserve to take. who always look down others is the one who be look down. "
,the_champ108,2012-03-19T02:40Z,"hey can anyone plese help me understand this....i have been breaking my head for a week and still don't get it. can anyone use xgd3 or do u need an ihas burner to play these..i have a hitachi with all the latest on it,can somebody help me please."
[V],boobsman,2012-03-19T11:33Z,"@ the_champ108 XGD3 is the latest game format that MS is using. The XGD3 discs contain more data than the older XGD2 games, so much data that they no longer fit onto a standard dual layer dvd. There are 2 ways around this, you can either buy an ihas burner which will allow you to burn 100% of game data onto a standard disc OR you can use the trudicate method to burn the game with a standard dvd burner. this trudicate method will miss off the last 5% of disc data but as this is just disc padding it will not effect the game play, however it will make the disc visible when playing online and therefore you may be banned from xbox live. 

Either way to play XGD3 games you need to upgrade drive firmware if your console is flashed, you should ideally use LT3.0 but these XGD3 games will work on LT2.0 if you patch before burning with the downgrader."
,the_champ108,2012-03-19T14:02Z,"thnx boobsman,can u please tell me more about the (trudicate method) so i can use for now?..is there maybe a link u can post with a step by step tutorial?.thnx in advance u rock man! "
,Assassinprofessor,2012-03-19T18:21Z,IGN gave the game 3.0..AWFUL..wtf!!!
,herbsmokah,2012-03-19T18:57Z,"hey boobsman, i really appreciate the uploads man, im just having a problem...i click on ""get this torrent"" and it appears in bittorrent but doesnt appear to have any files. am i doing something wrong? thanks alot"
,lRyu,2012-03-19T19:15Z,"Hey Boobs, how do you know whether or not the game is verified? It isn't in AGBX's list yet and comes up as unverified."
,TimWithaT,2012-03-19T21:53Z,"I don''t get the region thing.. Is that new or something?

Can i play it on my xbox? i''m from NL... "
,TimWithaT,2012-03-20T08:03Z,"What do you all think about this game?
I've read that ninja gaiden 3 is one of the worst action games.

What would you all rate this game?"
,istuffedsunny,2012-03-20T09:40Z,Not worth the money. Worth a download though.
,TimWithaT,2012-03-20T17:03Z,Worth 1 of the three CDs i have left?
,eternal666,2012-03-22T06:33Z,"wont install for me 
goes black at start up 
when it does load when u select normal
the circle spins and spins and dont load the game??wtf man "
,salazam1,2012-03-25T00:36Z,"IGN is retarded. Their review of NG3 was the last straw in reading biased unreliable fanboy heartbreak hate-trashing. This game is nowhere near as epic as the first two... but no 3.

@lRyu game just came out, you gotta give abgx time to update their server. Till then, In Boobs We Trust."
,salazam1,2012-03-27T00:23Z,"I went back and played NG2... yeah, they kinda dropped the ball on this one when you compare them. As a standalone it might be worth a 6 or maybe 7... but when you consider its lineage it's a 4. It's like Ninja Gaiden for babies."
,herbsmokah,2012-03-28T00:00Z,this file does not work...it downloads fully but for some reason downloads fast to 1000% not 100? then when i insert it the xbox says open tray....i dont think this file works or i just dont understand these new magnet links....i got the .iso file when it downlaoded but do i need anything else
,natorj,2012-04-02T15:28Z,"Boobsman, this file requires a password, i dont find it, can u help me? "
,portustfs,2012-04-04T12:46Z,"Boobsman, can u say the password? I can extract the iso. Thank´s!"
,portustfs,2012-04-09T12:49Z,Anyone know the password for this file? Thank´s.
,Aurion77,2012-04-12T09:23Z,"Great

Thx For This Game

^_^"
,portustfs,2012-04-12T16:43Z,"Aurion77 please, what´s a password in this file? Thank´s."
,Tyclone,2012-05-14T12:16Z,RF Please!!! For NTSC/J users...we are many.
