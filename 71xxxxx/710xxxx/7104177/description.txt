Schoolux project is registered  as a Non Government Organization(NGO) in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. The full name is Schoolux foundation. The NGO was registered in 2010, under the companies act of 2002 in Tanzania.
Schoolux currently has a secretary and two board members.
The idea of Schoolux, came to the founder in 2008 as the development of Linux took a dramatic turn into becoming smaller, faster and very much more built for Third World Countries like Tanzania.
The clear lack of teacher and teaching resources is the main background or the wish to develop system that bypasses these obstacles as give the individual a fair chance of education, as computer education especially can be done on your own with a great success, unlike many other careers.
Schoolux has been due to lack of time from the founder, been sleeping for the last 6 months.
