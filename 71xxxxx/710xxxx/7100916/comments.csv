,nbrazil,2012-03-14T12:57Z,"I'm curious to see just how silly this gets. The Edison-type light bulbs are a very simple and highly documented technology and there are tens of thousands of people in the US alone that could specify a production system from scratch. The idea that superior versions of this are being kept off the market by a conspiracy is laughable.

The essential problem of the incandescent bulb is that most of the power is expressed as heat rather than visible light. Companies have invested vast sums over the last century trying to find a better way to generate the most photons at the desired wavelengths for the least input power. Compact fluorescent hasn't lived up to its promise and LED is looking to be the next big thing in lighting. The market for cheaper, stronger, and more durable LEDs is so great that a conspiracy is doomed by the immense rewards for the first to break ranks."

He says ""we all are economists"" which is complete false: most people are indoctrinated with keynesian crap (marxism, statism).
Summarizing: a lot of crap with ornaments of fact..."
,themistoklis,2012-06-05T14:42Z,"I want to point out the truth in this documentary,
i have an Epson dx6050 all in one and i want to scan something and because of an ink that is empty the machine doesn't work (chip in the ink cartridge). as it seems i am the only one that sees the elephant in the room, the documentary is not about the light bulb or any other type of light bulb BUT it is about the policy of companies that want us trapped.
(and please just watch the documentary) "
