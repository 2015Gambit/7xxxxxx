Black Mirror is a three-part television drama series created by Charlie Brooker. The series is produced by Zeppotron for Endemol. Regarding the programme's content and structure, Brooker noted, "each episode has a different cast, a different setting, even a different reality. But they're all about the way we live now ΓÇô and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy."[1]

An Endemol press release describes the series as "a hybrid of The Twilight Zone and Tales of the Unexpected which taps into our contemporary unease about our modern world", with the stories having a "techno-paranoia" feel.[2] Channel 4 describes the first episode as "a twisted parable for the Twitter age
