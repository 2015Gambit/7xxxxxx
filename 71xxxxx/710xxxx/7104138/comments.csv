,xlucas,2012-03-15T12:52Z,"been12, Thanks for the 3D release.
But the quality (of image and sound) are not too poor to watch in a Big TV (42 inch +), because the small size of the file (for 3D)?? In general for good image quality for 3D movies, the size stay around 10 GB or plus.
Thanks.
Forgive my bad english."

,been12,2012-03-15T13:09Z,keep em seeding my friends or theres no point me uploading anymore 3d its up to you i already have em
,xlucas,2012-03-15T14:59Z,"Thanks been12, for the attention.
I am still downloading (it is very slow, by the way), after finished I`ll send a feedback about the quality.
I used to listen that it´s not possible keep decent quality (mainly in 3D) with less than about 10 GB files.. but...
Please, don´t misunderstand, I´m not complaining, just trying to make a constructive collaboration, to help to obtain the best for all of us :)
One more time, Thank you, for your good will."
,been12,2012-03-15T15:07Z,no probz you will be happy with the quality trust me

,been12,2012-03-15T19:55Z,i no the download speed is slow but i cant do anything about that untill people seed i am still seeding this torrent so if u like the quality (which you will) then please help me out and seed when you have watched it. other wise its a waste of my time uploading any more 3d and ive got over 50 bluray 3d discs to get up on here thanks.
,been12,2012-03-15T20:03Z,i downloaded this movie this morning on my 2nd computer (yes i downloaded my own torrent) just to see if all was well seen as it was my first upload and it only took 20mins to download and was perfect strange dont get why so slow any help on that would be great.

,blackhawk43,2012-03-15T23:37Z,hi been12 its at 40.2 percent and no seeder 
,xlucas,2012-03-16T03:35Z,"been12, I'm still downloading. Is very, very slow: (... I do not know why, maybe because it was available via a link magnetic?? Or it makes no difference?
Anyway, I gonna wait the necessary time.
And please continue to uploading, and make available their remaining 3D. 3D are still rare, hard to find. Thank you."
,been12,2012-03-16T07:35Z,my download speed for this was 3.0kb/s my fastest ever download i only ever get to 1.0kb/s strange why its so slow stick with it tho its a good 3d movie
,been12,2012-03-16T07:43Z,ahhh right i can see you lot now in my torrent settings which country you are downloading from and what % you are all at if you get stuck again try in a few hrs time. i cant seed all day (got the day job to do) but will seed when i clock off work most of you are at 44% at the mo
,xlucas,2012-03-16T12:32Z,"been12, if available, please keep the subtitles and audio in Portuguese in their uploads.
As subtitles are very light (not true!?), Keep all that are available, will not increase significantly the size of the file and will be useful to more people around the world.
Thank you."
,yummy69,2012-03-16T16:08Z,"been12 please state the encoding dimensions and the audio info in your upload. 

sadly your journey to the centre of the earth 3D bluray 3d version is only 960x540 and has only a 320 kbps 2 channel aac encoding.
What we like here for a good quality rip is 1920x1080 (or less than 1080 if not 16:9)"
,xlucas,2012-03-16T17:02Z,"been12, when I asked for subtitles (and audio in Portuguese and other languages​​, too, if available, of course) I mean separeted subtitles, those who can choose to display or not. I hate subtitles embedded / burned in images.

Again, thank you (and still downloading ... :) undoubtedly the slowest download I have ever done: (... and forgive my bad english"
,been12,2012-03-16T17:24Z,i am seeding now untill i see that a few of you have downloaded then its up to you to seed
,been12,2012-03-16T18:15Z,@yummy69... yes pal point noted.. if this gose well and is seeded  my next uploads will include all specs. and all under 5gb
,been12,2012-03-16T19:50Z,and it says on the bluray 3d box that this movie is 1080p
,been12,2012-03-16T20:15Z,i read that the download speed is really slow why is this? any help would be great. and why did it only take me 20 mins to download my own torrent? dont get it. still im doing my best with no help from no one dont think ive done too bad so far. any help tho i will listen.
,been12,2012-03-17T08:03Z,could all you who have downloaded please leave comments on the quality and sound and any changes i could make in future uploads thanks 
,been12,2012-03-17T08:17Z,right then the seeding is well up now time to upload the next mmmm what to do? ahh right im doing hugo next under 5gb
,been12,2012-03-17T18:26Z,yeahhh im glad it worked for you i can upload some more 3d now i no they download ok 
,xlucas,2012-03-17T18:33Z,"Finally finished. I gonna seed, for a while, now.
Considerations: The quality is good, both video, and audio.
But in my humble opinion, could be better if:

Had 5.1 audio channels;
1920x1080 video;
subtitles included in the package in a separate files (maybe keep the other audios, in other languages, too;
save in mkv, which keeps the legends already in the film.

I think a bit more quality sound and video, compensate an increased final file size.
But is a good job, anyway.

Please continue uploading your 3D videos, even if is slow to downloading them.

Thanks, man :>)"
,been12,2012-03-17T18:44Z,thanks man.... your comments mean a lot like i said im new to this torrent thing. im no expert with computers but ile get there in the end .
,xlucas,2012-03-17T19:30Z,"been12, it is possible for you, if available, send the Portuguese subtitles (in a new torrent. They are so small that it will be fast)? By the way, please, always include all subtitles, remember, not all people understand English (or other language besides their own)
I found some subtitles in Portuguese, but they are out of sync, and even though I tried, I could not synchronize them.
[again forgive my english. I use the google Translate, to help me write my messages :) )]"
,xlucas,2012-03-17T19:45Z,"hey!! and Porno 3D?? Do you have some??? Please, upload them ;)."
,been12,2012-03-17T20:13Z,will try pal like i said im new to this and no computer expert.
,been12,2012-03-17T20:16Z,as for the 3d porn NOOP sorry pal i have a real life girlfriend who i live with and who would probly chop my balls off with a rusty bread knife if i even looked at porn on the net never mind upload it..+ why u want 3d porn? get the real thing dude its much better.
,xlucas,2012-03-17T22:41Z,"Thanks, man.
Well, I prefer real sex, too, :) ... but sometimes, I like sex ""unreal"", too. :>).
Just as we prefer to live our own adventures, but also like to ""live"" in the adventures that are provided through the films.

Thank you. :)"
,thaitran,2012-03-18T00:09Z,well done been12 a 10 for me run good on my 42 lg5700
,xlucas,2012-03-18T01:41Z,"Finally I found a subtitle in portuguese that´s sincronized :>)... 

Now watch... 
And dowloading the next 3D videos :>)... (and probably look for sincronized subtitles... :)"
,xlucas,2012-03-19T03:05Z,"Use MKV2AC3 to convert DTS audio to AC3.
It takes less than 20 minutes (without any change in the video, only audio is converted) to convert and preserve all original chanells and play perfectly in TVs LG. On my LG LW5700 42 ""works perfectly. :)

MKV2AC3 is freeware:

Handbrake converts audio as well, but is much slower because the video is recoded as well."
,jarb900,2012-03-22T23:59Z,how can i see the movie in 3D??? did i need a 3D tv?
