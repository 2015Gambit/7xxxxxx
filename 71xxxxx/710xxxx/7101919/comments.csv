,davidjg8,2012-03-14T15:04Z,"Looking forward to watching your conversation, thanks for taking the time."
,ofpirate,2012-03-15T06:29Z,intriguing.. anxious to see the results!
,FatFreddy247,2012-03-16T15:46Z,please dont all jump off when your download completes keep seeding at least what you have downloaded otherwise this might be my last effort
,ofpirate,2012-03-17T01:01Z,best practice would be to initially seed to.975% until heavily populated healthy swarm before allowing the swarm access to the last .o25%
,ofpirate,2012-03-17T06:41Z,"screened opening sequence and first scene.. without question this appears to the best user conversion ive seen yet.. looks virtually identical to what an official release might look like.. bravo, well done!"
,FatFreddy247,2012-03-17T11:37Z,"i did say it wouldnt disappoint the hard core fans.

if response is generally positive im considering converting:

300
Aliens
The Dark Knight
Dune
Jurassic Park Trilogy
Lord Of The Rings Ext. Trilogy
Star Wars Series
Top Gun
Transformers 1&2"
,JHGFDS,2012-03-17T13:05Z,"Hi adw_uk,

I have not downloaded this yet, but if the comments are anything to go by, you should do conversions for LOTR followed by JP first. (Star Wars and Transformers will be done soon enough anyway, so no point putting effort into those). How long did the process take?"
,FatFreddy247,2012-03-17T17:41Z,"just watching Top Gun 3D and the aerial dogfight scenes in 3D are awesome and the wife likes Tom Cruise racing the jet on his motorbike too.

will upload this too if i know people will seed, 50 have dropped off today already..."
,ofpirate,2012-03-17T18:16Z,"Seems like The Matrix would be a great candidate, as well as Aliens.. always felt District 9 would be spectacular in 3D as well - if you would be kind enough to document the process in greater detail, I would be willing consider banging out a couple myself!"
,ofpirate,2012-03-17T18:23Z,"BTW - though I doubt that Ridley would be to thrilled about something like this in the wild.. I do believe the Scott, Cronenweth, Paull and the rest of the original production team would be in awe of this print.. "

,FatFreddy247,2012-03-17T20:30Z,"the titles i listed are a wish list and realistically i can only do the one's where i have bought the blu-rays as you need to do this with a lossless source.

i actually only switched over to hi-def 2 weeks ago and so far have just 25 titles in my blu-ray library but  Top Gun  is just done and looks amazing,  300  is currently converting then i might go back to the sixties and do  Cleopatra  or  Spartacus  and see how a digitally restored classic movie looks in 3D.  key to all this is feedback and keeping seeders as i am not going to kill my broadband for days at a time uploading if leechers just grab and jump off the swarm.  i will document the proceedure given a bit of time but as an IT manager i am sure you can appreciate 40 plus hours a week on computers dont want to be tekkie at the weekends!"
,ofpirate,2012-03-17T21:46Z,"@adw_uk - when time permits (and if you are inclined), the above suprbay thread (official piratebay forum) would be the ideal place to further discuss your amazing conversion process.. I (and presumably others) have the necessary processing resources & time to throw at some of the above titles!"
,3Dazz,2012-03-19T09:56Z,"Ok, Ive watched this and all I can see is a bluray quality movie that you have wear 3D glasses too see. Theres no depth or any thing popping out at you, although as the original is'nt made with 3D in mind, this is not surprising. This is the same result Ive got when Ive tried to to do a 2D to 3D. Also the audio isnt in sync with the video, although I did'nt notice till half way through. A good effort, but no cigar."
,FatFreddy247,2012-03-20T00:04Z,"i did say there are no spears flying out of the screen but to say there is no added depth means that i and others who have messaged me are all imagining things that are not there.  if i had converted the movie and not been so impressed i would never have wasted the time uploading it as there are hundreds of blade runner rips already on torrent sites and my bandwidth could have been used elsewhere.  in VLC i get no sync issues but on my WD Live TV i press options and lip sych and set it back 3ms at about the half-way point.  i also had this with Top Gun and The Ten Commandments but not yet with Cleopatra, 300 or Aliens.  if anyone else agrees there is no added depth then i will stop uploading and wasting everyones time and bandwidth. "
,FatFreddy247,2012-03-20T00:09Z,"i have just checked on the conversion software forum and its a bug that will be fixed in the upcoming release but easily adjusted whilst playing in the short term.

,3Dazz,2012-03-20T09:28Z,"@ adw_uk, Im using a new passive polarised tv and I watch most 3D with an LG Smart Upgrader which streams from a server in another room. This combination may not be giving the same results as you are seeing. To be fair,I'll play this movie with a laptop using VLC. I was not having a go at your work, merely sharing my experience of it. I've tried doing conversion exactly how you have done, and I havent been happy with the results. I will post again when I have reviewed it. Cheers."
,3Dazz,2012-03-20T10:17Z,"OK, as I said earlier, I've rewatched the opening(with a Corei5 laptop connected via hdmi) and am happy to admit there is some depth to this rip. I might share this rip with a friend who has a Samsung active shutter tv and see what it looks like. As I said before, I have attempted the same thing as you, and have not been happy with the results. Reading your description, I guess I expected that you had found a new process. But youre only doing the same thing that many others have tried before. If you lift your glasses during a proper 3D movie, you see things in the foreground are clearly visible, and the background is out of focus. This gives the effect of depth when combined with a second image. Lift the glasses during a conversion and its all out of focus, the two images being overlayed give it some depth, but obviously not what we're used to seeing. Unless software changes radically in the near future, this is as good as its going to get."
,FatFreddy247,2012-03-22T12:54Z,"once the irritating audio sync bug is fixed i will delete this torrent and re-up along with a few other special titles, The Ten Commandments looks awesome in SBS 3D and so does Jurassic Park and Lord Of The Rings."
,FatFreddy247,2012-03-22T12:56Z,NOTE: All my 3D rips require an active-shutter 3D TV and glasses to get the full effect of the SBS encoding.
,thompson12000,2012-04-08T20:53Z,I thought it looked great and definitely added depth.  Anytime there was mist or cigarette smoke in the foreground it popped out of the screen.  If you don't want to seed the other 3d conversions I would like to buy them from you.  Send me a pm.  
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-10T10:28Z,i have spoken to a developer of the conversion software and the audio/video sync issue is a bug so i wont do any more uploads until this is fixed.  i have though a 1080p h.264 DTS 5.1 copy of Titanic that i am converting to 3D for myself as i have just seen the re-release at the cinema and can objectively compare the results
,FatFreddy247,2012-04-11T00:23Z,"ive spent 20 minutes trying to add the next torrent to TPB but it keeps failing so will try a couple more times then up at demonoid.

,grotesco1,2012-05-06T03:42Z,repost from another nick ...same size-same fake
,D4RK-KN1GHT,2012-05-09T13:44Z,"great effort, NOT a fake its a convert from 2D to 3D which is clearly stated in the description.  ignore the haters and thanks for your efforts!"
,D4RK-KN1GHT,2012-05-25T14:35Z,"we are all well aware that the studios employ people to become members and diss torrents to limit the exposure of the copy.  you can usually tell who they are as when you click on their name they have NO uploaded torrents so hello foley84!

to everyone else this is a very interesting torrent and gives you an idea what blade runner can look like in 3D.  there is a bug in the conversion software which means the sound goes slightly out of sync half way through the film but on streaming devices and VLC this is easily correctable."
