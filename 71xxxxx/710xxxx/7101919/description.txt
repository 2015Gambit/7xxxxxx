Yes it is true the seminal 1982 movie in Hi-Def Side-By-Side 3D.  

Hard core fans of the movie will NOT be disappointed, I sat and watched this with trepidation but was astounded at the depth this process offers.  There are no spears being thrown out of the screen but key scenes such as the opening, 'Hades Landscape' become even more breathtaking as the sweep to the Tyrell building benefits immesurably from the extra dimension, the Blush Response Rachel interview in Tyrells office, ALL the Oriental skyscapes burst into life.  

In essence you get to view the world Ridley created with added depth in every frame with no gimmicks.

Please only download this movie if you own the original Blu-Ray.

Process was:

Buy the Blu-Ray
Rip the whole disc to PC using Slysoft AnyDVDHD
Extract the 1080p video and DD 5.1 Audio

Please note you need a 3D enabled TV with SBS technology and active 3D glasses to view.  I stream from a WD TV Live over a gigabit LAN with no stuttering of video or audio.  On my system the Panasonic TV does not auto-detect the 3D till 3-4 minutes into the movie so as soon as it starts I goto 3D/Manual/SBS and its perfect then from the opening frame.
