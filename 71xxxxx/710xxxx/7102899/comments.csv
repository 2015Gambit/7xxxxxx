,ozanuyan,2012-03-17T15:08Z,This one does save the game but I didn't let it connect to internet so just to be on the safe side you should do the same.
,Arbiter89,2012-03-21T23:23Z,"The installation works properly, but the game is simply fucking horribad. It's suffering from a bad case of consolitis, 

I'm talking no mouse usage, no AA, arrow keys to move. Don't waste your time with it, the game sucks."
,VegitoDBZ,2012-03-24T21:43Z,"To be perfectly honest, this game is enjoyable. Controls could be better, 1 hit = death is a pain in the ass, but what really pissed me off in this game is how fucking accurate you have to warp. 1 pixel offthe ledge for instance , you die. I heard there are several endings? Cuz the one i got is comparable to ME3 where you tiy to accomplish something only to find out in the end, that you wasted your time. But this game was made by EA, so it's not really a surprise."
