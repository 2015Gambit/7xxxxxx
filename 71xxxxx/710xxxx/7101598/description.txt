Throughout the course of history, books have been torch bearers and great motivators. Some books make such an impact that they change the way the world thinks about things. This issue of Tell Me Why showcases some among such books. Of course, reading is subjective, and individual tastes may differ. Any such shortlists run the risk of being called subjective. Please feel free to suggest other titles you feel worthy, which can be included in a later volume.
Also, please note that religious texts are not included. Indian books that influenced the world will be published as a separate issue, in future.
