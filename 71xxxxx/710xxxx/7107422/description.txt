"The Ames Brothers"

Two of Alcatraz's most violent brothers, 
Herman and Pinky Ames, who were 
notorious for nearly escaping in 1963, 
find something mysteriously amiss when 
they return to Alcatraz in the present 
day.

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

We had contemplated doing tonight as 
108/109 since Fox pulled the Clarence
Montgomery episode at the last minute.
But as that episode was obviously 
intended to be 8th, and was available
as 108 on iTunes, we went ahead and
went with 109/110 for tonight. You
can still watch these with no 
continuity loss as 8-Clarence was a
standalone epiosde. Tune-in in just a
short 7 days for the scene missing
108 'Clarence Montgomery'.

Enjoy :)
