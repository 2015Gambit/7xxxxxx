I am not an ELP fan by any stretch...not even close, but I am huge Gary Moore fanatic. Moore plays lead guitar and shares some of the vocal duties on this album. There are also two Gary Moore penned tracks: "Nuclear Attack" & a song he cowrote with Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy, "Parisienne Walkways". As always, Moore does not disappoint. Thanks to Moore and his killer fretwork, most of this album leans toward the hard rock side.
