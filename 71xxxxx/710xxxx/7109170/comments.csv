,mkdhdh,2012-03-17T23:44Z,does it work on lion? because the blade crack didn't work wich is weird :p
,failzone,2012-03-18T02:53Z,Seed!
,hjafri12,2012-03-19T20:50Z,"@mkdhdh 
i had the same problem, but i fixed it. what you do is replace the content, but you keep both files that are LEGOCloneWars.macbin in the same folder. when it asks you if you want to replace, say keep both files. it should load up afterwards"
,manman2,2012-03-20T14:20Z,"Doesn't work for me, if i replace, or keep both files even. Is there another crack available? Asks me still for the code, and if i replace files it just jumps in dock and never loads."
,blebz232,2012-03-21T00:27Z,Can someone please guide me through the steps of placing the crack.... I've downloaded it and it all works fine I just dont know where to place the 7zarchive file???
,bobsuruncle,2012-03-23T01:59Z,I don't seem to have the proper folders to add the crack to. all I have is an application icon for the game itself and an empty folder
,g92012,2012-03-23T03:05Z,worked for me.......copy the same crack given by fail zone in the respected folder........but ONLY REPLACE the content file......and while copying LEGOCloneWars.macbin KEEP BOTH THE FILES (do not replace) enjoy :)
,g92012,2012-03-23T03:09Z,and yes it does works on lion
,bobsuruncle,2012-03-23T19:19Z,"I still can't find the proper folder(s) to put the cracks into. I'm running snow leopard, and all it's showing me is the app itself, no folders."
,g92012,2012-03-24T07:14Z,"@bob right click on d app nd click ""show package content"""
,bobsuruncle,2012-03-25T05:21Z,@g92 thanks. Now the only problem is my only option is to replace the macbin file as opposed to keeping both.
,bobsuruncle,2012-03-25T05:45Z,"@g92012  thanks.

now the issue I'm having is I have no option to keep both macbin files. The only choices presented are cancel or replace."
,derfazoid,2012-03-26T08:46Z,"same issue as manman2 (single replace, need code// both replace bounces and doesn't load)

,derfazoid,2012-03-26T09:28Z,replaced both and it works!! didn't realize I just had to click play and leave serial empty ;)
