                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Financial Times columnist Mrs Moneypenny runs down her top ten money-saving 
 tips, offering advice on subjects including holidays, insurance and mobile 
 phones. She also presents highlights from the programme's second series, such 
 as making a family face the unpleasant reality of a year's food waste and 
 showing a couple how much they spent on romantic trips. Plus, how the Fontaine 
 and Galvin families have fared since having their overspending challenged. 
                                
                                 Enjoy!
