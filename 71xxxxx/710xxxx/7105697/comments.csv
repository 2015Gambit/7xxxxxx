,omegaviper,2012-03-16T08:00Z,why do you make releases that are 3 times the size of yify's which are 720p also. it seems rather pointless.
,ShahinD,2012-03-16T13:29Z,"@omegaviper

you can download yify's.
most people want high quality releases and high quality releases are always larg in size because of higher bitrate.
High Bitrate = High quality = Larg file size"
,stegman,2012-03-16T17:58Z,"Get a clue, omegaviper.

While the screen resolution is the same in both releases - 1280 x 688,
this version has normal bitrate - 2299 kbps.
When you over-compress the file to achieve small file size (600-900 mb) 
all you get is pixalated, blurry mess.
In result you get quasi-HD quality, a file that completely defies the initial purpose."
,omegaviper,2012-03-20T11:24Z,"@stegman i have both versions and they look the same on my 50+ inch 1080p tv's, so your wrong I have been getting yify's releases for almost 2 years and he is the best that's why I made the comment."
,lewsur,2012-03-28T18:40Z,"So then go download his. Damn, no one has a gun to your head.

I'm getting this now and if I don't comment again then it means this is good quality."
,omegaviper,2012-03-29T14:16Z,@lewsur you missed the point I said this is the same quality as yify's which is smaller making yify's better.  They both have 720p quality and your a dumb ass.  You say to go download his I already said I have both what does a gun have to do with this you are so dumb you need to be killed.  I am so thankful ip tracing software exists.
