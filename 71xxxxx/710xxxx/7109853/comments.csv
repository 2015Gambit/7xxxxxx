,dwbeez,2012-05-31T22:30Z,loved this show and network treated viewers crappy when the series was absolutely cancelled without warning despite the great ratings. No notice and ending. it was planned to return another  season but the network changed the plan in the middle oh summer haitas and left the fans hanging without any closure. Worst decision made by a network that I remembered. It is also not available on DVD. I will be running this and hoping others have more seasons available
,dwbeez,2012-06-19T20:39Z,Anyone know where to get the other seasons? My favorite show and they didn't provide and ending as the show was slated to come back in fall lineup only to be cut in summer. Very Disappointed and can't find on DVD. songwriterpro@yahoo.com
