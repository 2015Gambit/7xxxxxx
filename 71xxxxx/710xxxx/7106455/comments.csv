,Herman_Whoracle,2012-03-22T04:19Z,"l3endik,

Just because YOU don't give a fuck about the reunion doesn't mean nobody else does, and this is supposed to be complete like the title says ""Jersey Shore Complete Season 5"", and this is missing the last episode. The reunion is an episode if you weren't aware."
,Herman_Whoracle,2012-03-22T04:21Z,"With that said thank you for the upload, I appreciate it, and I'm seeding this. I'll just get the reunion from another torrent. This is the first time I've ever had to do that. "

[T],FatFreddy473,2012-03-25T12:24Z,"it says ""Get this torrent"".. green letters"
,Maclaban1,2012-03-25T15:30Z,"Thanks I3endik but it shows that Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (magnet) isn't associated with any program. Any other advice?"
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-03-25T20:26Z,try google chrome or upgrading your torrent client
