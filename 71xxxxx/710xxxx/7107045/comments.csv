,badjoke12,2012-06-06T12:26Z,"

Also when it comes to installing this game copy the entire contents of all 3 dvd into a seperate folder then install using the blue setup.
Trying to install this by mouting with daemon tools you will encounter errors"
,inoksvere,2012-06-09T10:42Z,"This torrent is quite poorly put together, though I highly appreciate you uploading it as it is quite rare. 

My issue is that you didn't include any step by step instructions. Normally, you can mount the files and just install. This is weird. You have disc 1 broken into 3 parts, none of which are iso so they won't mount, and these 3 parts have to have the contents extracted? And you have to do this with EACH disc, which have their own separate parts?

Ugh. Here goes quite some time. :/"
,inoksvere,2012-06-09T10:55Z,"So, I extracted all the parts from Disc 1. Started the install and it wouldn't progress past like 45% or so. Some message came up in Japanese (the entire installer is in Japanese as well) and I hit the equivalent of ""Okay"" so it would continue installing. It wouldn't. At all. I had to end it. 

._."
,inoksvere,2012-06-09T11:00Z,"So, the installer stopped at 45% basically queuing me for the next disc, when it didn't even access part 2 -- or 3 -- of disc 1. Well, it wouldn't budge. I had to cancel out of it. 

Also, since the installer is completely in Japanese it's rather difficult to understand. I would have loved to have an english translation for the installer alone. 

Anyway, over two weeks downloading this torrent and then massive crap for the install. Awesome stuff. :P I'll keep trying and keep this updated."
,Braww,2012-06-09T21:00Z,"Alright, here's how I installed it. Hopefully this helps some of you, and keep in mind this game is in japanese so you will have to install an english fanpatch.

1. Download the Torrent,
2. The Torrent will contain DVD 1-3, simply open DVD 1 then there will be 3 more parts. Open DW7_DVD1_up_by_phonghanh.part1, and extract the .mtf somewhere. This will automatically extract the other parts of DVD1. 
3. Do the same for DVD2 and DVD3.
4. (I use Daemon Tools) Double click on the extracted DW7_DVD1_up_by_phonghanh, and install it. It's in jap, but if you've ever installed anything it has the same basic layout.
Halfway through the installation, a window in japanese will pop up. This means you need to alt tab out, double click on DW7_DVD2_up_by_phonghanh  (Make sure it's DVD2) to mount it, and once it's mounted simply alt tab back to the installed and click on the what I assume to be OK button. Do the same when it asks for DVD3.
5. Once the game is installed, drag or copy paste the crack into the installation folder.
6. Enjoy playing.

Hope this helps."

yes thank you"
,haveaquestion,2012-06-14T04:25Z,"GAME WORKS. LOOK UP Braww
"
,haveaquestion,2012-06-14T04:26Z,"Why does it say 6 instead of 7, I don't really speak Japanese?"
,dispray,2012-06-14T19:41Z,does it works on windows xp professional serive pack 3?
,Nghiluu,2012-06-15T15:17Z,"Yes, it works on XP SP 3"
,NakanoSan,2012-06-18T06:16Z,"I don't know when the deviation started, but this game is Shin Sangoku Musou 6 in Japan.

Google it."
,Aviator001,2012-06-27T03:35Z,"I can't run this game. When i click on the executable, the game shows a black window for a second, and then becomes unresponsive. 

Is this a problem only I have?

If so, can anyone help me find a solution? It took a long, long time to download this game"
,Aviator001,2012-06-27T03:57Z,"Guys I run a windows 7 with 3 gb ram, nvidia 9600 M GT on my laptop

This is about the only game I've really had a problem in, and surprisingly, I'm the only one across every website I've visited to have this problem

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game 3 times, installed 2005 and 2010 versions of C++ redistributable, downloaded all the missing dll files and have an updated directx 11.

I have no clue what to fix -.-
Help would be greatly appreciated"
,dark1crow,2012-06-29T04:50Z,Does anybody knows why Wang Yi's theme is not included among theďťż game's OST ?
,pancake62,2012-07-11T23:07Z,"Alright, two questions that need to be clarified:


1.   Is this Dynasty Warriors 7 or Dynasty Warriors 6?  The Torrent and the Installation seem to claim different things.

2.  Where and How would one get an English patch for this?  Someone posted a link to a tutorial earlier but I found it too complicated and dangerous."
,pancake62,2012-07-11T23:12Z,"Also, my installation was working fine until suddenly (while on the third install cd) an error came up.  Being as I don't speak Japanese or whatever it may be, I'm not really sure what the error actually was, probably something about a file unable to be installed or something like that.  Still, after retrying several times I tried just clicking 'Ignore', which in turn gave a constant error that would keep popping up after retrying, so I had to abort."
,popino01,2012-07-12T18:43Z,"It says 6 because the name in japanese is Shin Sangoku MusĹ? 6, but in english is Dynasty Warriors 7."
