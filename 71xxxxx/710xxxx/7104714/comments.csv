,village1diot,2012-03-17T05:05Z,"You want to debate the existence of god? checkout my youtube channel under the same name.

The one thing about Jesus you can be close to certain about is, if he was actually a real man(and yes, that is debatable), he did not raise from the dead or perform any miracles.

None of that hockus pokus miracle stuff has ever been proven. And since nobody can prove any miracle has ever happened, you can pretty much bet Jesus didn't do them either.

So this movie might actually be a good representation of the real man(if he actually ever lived)

Worth a look."

,Hungryghost76,2012-03-18T21:08Z,"Respitory: The Dead Sea scrolls ADD several gospels many of which contradict the 4 canonical gospels. The Gnostics who wrote them had many strange beliefs; they were basically Jewish extremists. Since the first gospel Mark wasn't written down until eighty years after Jesus death, (in Greek) they have been transcribed for LESS than 2000 years. Often by scribes who had little compunction about  altering facts to fit their favourite prophecy. German scholars(all fervent Christians) have discovered many inconsistencies in the ""historical"" gospels in the 19th Century.

,muvelvr,2012-03-25T23:06Z,"having not even seen this i already feel like it may be a more realistic depiction of Jesus and his disciples lol..

men are indeed just men, and men are not without sin. take the pope for example. remember folks, during Jesus' younger years he was just a regular ""dude"". he didn't start performing miracles until an approximate age of 30. its the message you should adhere to not the debate over whether or not he was a supernatural being without sin.  even if Jesus was a ""regular dude"" and part-time drunkard, yet still achieved the same ideals of ministry, why should he be respected any less. as ""sinners"" we would be more prone to relate to another man capable of sin, showing us that even with our imperfections we can make a better world."

I was an unbeliever until age 33 when the Lord got a hold of me.  I turned my life over to Him and it has not been the same since.  

When I was a non believer I NEVER bashed believers because I did not care about them.  I felt they were misguided but I still did not care.  I have looked into this and I do believe those that claim to not believe and then bash believers are really crying out for help.  They are lost, they know it and they desperately want help finding the Lord.

I work with the youth in several of our local churches and I would love to help any of you.  My Lord commands me to share the Word.  If you would like to talk to me even if it is just to bash me please send me an email at crsarm@gmx.com In case TPB blocks it here it is, just take out the dashes crsarm-@-gmx.com.

You probably have many friends you can't trust, have no way to put faith in another, and can't listen to another way to think without stooping to vulgarity and knuckle dragging verbiage. Go back to school and learn to put forth some actual thoughts... coherently. (if you don't understand that word, google it).  For the space alien bunch, for the atheist, even for the moron non-believers here, let me walk you thru this. Take a source, Jesus, God, alien, whatever, we got here somehow. Jesus, has made the most impact on the thought process and pro-human behavior outline the world has ever known. The Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule are the easiest to understand... even for the idiot comments on here. Which ones don't you believe in? You choose and I'll show you where your life is suffering. (If you don't understand the Golden Rule, look it up. Hopefully, it might make sense. If not, you're definitely a third world, brain-washed flatliner.) Sorry to harsh but I pray you can find value in your life.

,starlite2,2012-07-01T18:53Z,"shittiest rip evar... source was probably ok, but whomever ripped this really royally fucked it up... crashes my xvid player... audio all messed up... even handbrake chokes on this completely fucked up rip. When are posters going to learn? avi is a shitty wrapper from 1992, and there is no longer any reason to use xvid over x264. GET TECHNOLOGY YOU FUCKS (sorry neon... your posts are always tight... I'll assume you weren't the ripper here... because this is complete shit.)"
