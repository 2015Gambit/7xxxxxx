Despite their general objection to the 404p .mp4 format 2HD was nice enough to its fans to make a .mp4 proper of the episode in addition to the expected proper of the 720p .mkv so whichever format you want make sure you get the 2HD release. I feel kinda dirty for writing that.

 Please leave Canadian tv alone.
 Its fucked up enough already with the pot smoking hippies useing analog sources.
 Other guys used descriptive audio.
 


I THINK YOU CAN GUESS WHAT I THINK OF THAT DECLARATION FROM 2HD. Going after every other person and group that releases any Canadian shows and telling them to stop is pretty bold. Three little sentences to attack everyone else. Do i think i have what it takes to be part of 2HD? Why would i want to!!!!!
