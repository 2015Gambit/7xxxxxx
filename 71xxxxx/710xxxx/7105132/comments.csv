[T],iamgreat,2012-03-19T17:30Z,"By saying it is already fucked up enough 2HD are attacking the people who release some shows and who are not in scene groups. That is then being made worse by TWG and ASAP getting in on Canadian shows in the last four months or so. TWG isn't using analogue but 2HD can't stop insisting that they are. err0001 does and i at times also have used an analogue means of transfer. I waited half a day for anyone else to upload this release. This isn't the first time 2HD has gone on a rage like this in their nfo files. It won't be the last. 

Oddly enough last time they raged like this they were insisting The Bridge and Flashpoint are NOT Canadian shows and that being made in Canada and starring Canadians and being set in Toronto were commonplace for US shows.  I never claimed it made sense but 2HD does have a knack for attacking Canadian television from many angles. 

Do i have to see South Park? Last time i watched it they killed Kenny :("
,carib00,2012-03-21T10:17Z,"Like 2HD cares about P2P cappers like yourself. Since they do mostly do .ca shows I think they take it to heart when someone else trys to do them and fucks them up. Would be best if asap left .ca tv unmolested.

The south park thing was in reference to this release.
South.Park.S16E01.HDTV.x264-ASAP

Which was encoded at 60fps. So you had all of the video encoded at double speed with half of the audio of the show.

Have you looked into recording via firewire from the back of your setop box ?"
[T],iamgreat,2012-03-29T14:01Z,"Since i actually am Canadian i take it to heart when 2HD mouths off about how shows aren't Canadian when they actually are and then turns around and mouths off about other groups fucking with Canadian shows which they previously claimed are American and all those who said they are Canadian shows were called potheads by 2HD. Whether i release anything this year or not 2HD's comments are still offensive. I just happen to read them.

I know the arrogance of scene groups is akin to Wall Street executives. That is exactly why i prefer to be on the other side. I honestly don't know why they bother to acknowledge us little people regarding Lost Girl when issues with releases are found. With any other show they pretend we don't exist and the glitches are likewise treated as imaginary. So strange. 

I actually do firewire but every so often my cable co has an update which disables that output so i have to deal with it and that means analogue output. I might do Titanic since 2HD so far hasn't but no matter the quality difference in my favour people prefer releases from err0001 so it isn't exactly worth my time. And RiVER or FoV will come out with an ""UNCUT"" version on Sunday so even if i do a 720p it will be unwanted.  Why do i say that? When FQM cut about a minute from an ep of Being Human which i just happened to have recorded i put it out and only 1/2 of 1% of traffic here went to my complete episode.  99.5% preferred FQM's incomplete release. Exercises in futility.  

Was that episode of South Part by chance titled ""Kenny"" because it sounds like ASAP killed it. :)"
