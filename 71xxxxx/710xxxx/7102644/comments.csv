,michilllie,2012-09-13T09:29Z,"Hi, it's me again. The books downloaded...yay! But I can't seem to open them.  :(
There are 3 files for each book (aside from the cover photo) and I can't open any of them.  Here's an example of what the files look like:
metadata.opf
Bright Lights, Big Ass - Jen Lancaster.mobi
Bright Lights, Big Ass - Jen Lancaster.epub
Is there a special program that I need to open them? 
Please help. I'm really eager to get started.  And thank you for taking the time to upload these. "

Thank you so much for doing this. I really appreciate it!!!!!"
