,Lys0L,2012-03-16T11:37Z,A couple tracks in and this thing is AWFUL :O
,Qualtx,2012-03-16T11:38Z,It's real I just got it early and thought I would make an account to share it.  The album is pretty dope tho.
,danrman,2012-03-16T15:39Z,the fact that I have been downloading this for 10+ minutes and haven't yet reached 0.01% leads me to believe this is a fake.
[T],jmz619,2012-03-16T17:46Z,Yo you have to seed on your BitTorrent client. You can't just upload it to tpb. SEEED!! 
,Claus_x,2012-03-16T21:28Z,anyone able to confirm if this is the real deal?
[T],jmz619,2012-03-16T23:07Z,"Yep, it's legit the uploader has started seeding and i'm currently listening to it. Thanks for the upload. :)"
,Qualtx,2012-03-17T00:55Z,Sorry guys this is my first contribute so it took me a while to get the hang of things and figure it out.
,Claus_x,2012-03-17T02:22Z,"No need to apologize sir, excellent upload! Thank you very much.
Oh man, the album is great."
,phxsea,2012-03-17T08:16Z,"thanks for the upload

,danrman,2012-03-17T09:56Z,That embarrassing feeling when you call a torrent fake for not working only to have it download at 3MP/ps after trying it again.
,danrman,2012-03-17T09:57Z,"Yeah, This is amazing, thanks."
,mattokthx,2012-03-17T14:19Z,"this is the real deal, shit is fire- quality is great; will be buying it on itunes. golfwang."
,brown19,2012-03-17T15:32Z,not trying to be a dick... but earl is on the sone oldie... so yes he is on this album. he even said on twitter.
,Qualtx,2012-03-17T18:14Z,Yeah I know hes on the album but before it was released Tyler and the rest of them were saying he wasn't on any songs. It came as a huge surprise when everyone heard is awesome verse on Oldie.
,321ian,2012-04-02T06:31Z,good torrent  man
