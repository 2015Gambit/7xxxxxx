As for why? The selective application of comment moderation became untenable. 

Long live the consistency of thepiratebay!"

Thanks again!!


What's funny is that I got ""moderated"" for a comment replying to your ROFL MAO post!!!

Fuck demonoid!

,Annoyme,2012-03-16T22:45Z,"I responded to a troll, I was moderated and my comment removed, and then given a warning. The troll post was deleted with no warning. 

Two other people were given warnings for basically telling trolls to piss off. Never were the trolls warned.

,charlietexas,2012-03-16T23:33Z,"demonian has lost for some reason the audio book market, nothing much but muslim stuff there now. thanks for these limbaugh loads. regards j"
,Annoyme,2012-03-16T23:54Z,"funny you mention that charlie, if you say one thing negative about islam you get banned from ever commenting. I am on a message board where three people had that happen at demonoid. They can log on & download, but they can't post comments.

Something pretty screwy about that site. "

Another option is torrentday dot com"
,thunderbum,2012-03-17T00:28Z,"Thanks kindly for another great week of podcasts! Much appreciated!

Re: Demonium - stop and think for a moment: lots of islam stuff - and someone posts something negative about islam (and the poster gets banned), logic says the mods over there are (wait for it...) moslem!

And so when some moslem make a truly ignorant comment about christianity, I commented on islam and one of the mods sent a personal poison pen note to my inbox threatening all sorts of shite... *shrug*

would anyone know of a good, dependable place (other than here) where one can get a good selection of audio books? 

Have a good, and safe, weekend all! :)"
,thunderbum,2012-03-17T00:31Z,"I had a comment regarding the topic on hand but the damn thing didn't post! *ahem*

Anyway - hope you see my Thank You here for another great week of Rush's podcasts!

Have a safe weekend!"
,thunderbum,2012-03-17T00:32Z,It posted after all. Bloody hell. Anyone else have posts that either don't show up at all or show up later?
,Annoyme,2012-03-17T01:55Z,I am looking at T0RRENTB0X. It is hardly used and should be perfect for us.

Hey - you guys should join in the fun at Weasel Zippers (www.weaselzippers.us)

Mark Levin gave them a ""Hat Tip"" once or twice and I checked them out.

I post as ""woz"" over there.
