Overview: "I know he's that boy. The boy I want to marry, my prince, my happily ever after. I feel like I'm living in a dreamy fairytale. 

But then Pastor starts asking questions I donΓÇÖt know the answers to.
I have horrible wedding disaster dreams.
I canΓÇÖt find a dress.
I have to manipulate him to get my way.
An old boyfriend asks me to run away and marry him.
My best friend tells me I'm going to ruin everything.
And forever is starting to sound like a really long time.

Which makes me start to wonder. 

I wonder if best friends should get married. 
I wonder if I'm settling. 
I wonder if the fact that sex with him is so amazing that itΓÇÖs clouding my judgment.
I wonder if it's just cold feet.
I wonder if marriage is all that fun.

And then I have to decide. Am I willing to give up on true love forever, or should I say, What the hell, and marry him anyway?"


Enjoy!
