Original Release / Poor David's / 1030 / CD

Bugs Henderson and The Shuffle Kings - Gitarbazndrumz - Live At Poor David's Pub -Dallas, TX

Poor David's Pub...the local joint. Bugs has done it again. A live recording of the Henderson & Jones Album at Poor David's Pub which captures the essence of the artist himself, and his ability to consummately entertain an audience 'en vivo' as they say in Espanol. To paraphrase Bugs, "it's my best live recording ever."

In August of 1992 Bugs recorded first at Poor David's Pub an album "Gitarbazndrumz". PDP has been linked to Bugs since 1983 when first duo'ed with Ray Wylie Hubbard. Since then he has been a regular, because "he's so damn good." Every August PD'S has a anniversary concert. This August will be the 24th anniversary of the Shuffle Kings in one form or another. PD's is currently in its 22nd anniversary month and been a starting place for many renowned artists, e.g. Dixie Chicks, Sara Hickman, and Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets.
