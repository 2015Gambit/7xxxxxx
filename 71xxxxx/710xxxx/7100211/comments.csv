,djeking,2012-03-19T02:35Z,"V: 7 (Def not dvd quality)
A: 5 (Seems distant and muffled at the lower   frequencies)

But overall watchable.  I didn't finish watching it though cuz i like to find the best copy available to watch.  I downloaded the copy by ghostvs, has slightly better audio but same video quality."
