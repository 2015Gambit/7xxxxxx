""your an idiot.... you look like a crack head and you cant even use big words properly. Get a Life Stop smoking crack!...... you were so high during the filming you went to some random school and tried to pick andom kid hahah. CRACK HEAD GOOD FOR NOTHING FATHER WANNABEE""  by rb603139

The school apparently wanted to work out some sort of ""deal"" with me that i remove the video and im still not allowed on the premises for 30 days or im not allowed on the property at all. Seeing how YT removed it anyways, my opinion hasn't change and im not giving in, i mirrored it everywhere.  When visiting the link it says it was removed by the user which is a lie, cuz video manager says this:

Operation Paparazzi - Principal threatens â&#x20AC;Ś

 Rejected (content inappropriate)

So obvious YT's willing to lie to ruin someone at the persuasion of a government power in question. I however don't sway so easily."
