,FUCK-THE-ADMINZ,2012-03-22T16:57Z,"What is the FUCKING POINT of uploading this without subs?

If I could understand Spanish, I would download one of the MANY Spanish copies already acailable.

What a waste of time."
,idiot987,2012-03-24T03:42Z,i give up... looks like http://www.studyspanish.com/freesite.htm is the only option
,bazquux,2012-03-24T21:15Z,"Fer cripes' sake. Can't you complainers think for yourselves?

Run an online machine translation on whichever subs you can find (Indonesian, Malay)."

,piratubay,2012-04-05T03:49Z,"ENGLISH Subtitles:
http://bayfiles.com/file/740b/F6zBH2/Eva-EN.srt

Translated from the Malay Sub.
The best I could do..."
,Raccoonnookkeeper,2012-04-08T01:08Z,"Hello, piratubay: Thanks for the effort. Some English subtitles are better than none at all.

I know some Spanish, but the characters seem to breathe their words rather than speaking them, and very rapidly, at that, making it difficult to follow - for me, at least. Some Spanish subtitles would be very helpful.

extremezone: Thanks. The video is of very good quality. The SciFi film is one of the best I have ever seen."
,muratura,2012-04-20T18:20Z,here is subs in eng http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/4509224/eva-en .thanks for the movie
