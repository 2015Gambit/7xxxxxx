,MoonStrumm,2012-03-18T05:53Z,im new to this. how can i seed?
,engineer79,2012-03-18T23:46Z,"Just let your torrent client (uTorrent, Transmission whatever you have) open and don't delete or move this game where it is downloaded.  This way, you'll start seeding (seeding means kinda uploading without having to upload to a host like Mediafire, Rapidshare, Uploadstation etc.) "
,yammmmmmmmmmmm,2012-03-21T03:44Z,"Something is wrong with the game's graphics all the players' limb has glitch, it's all over my screen.. what is your current setting?"
,engineer79,2012-03-21T08:23Z,"Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400
4 GB RAM
nVidia GeForce 9600 GT
Mac OS X 10.7.3

If you use Intel Graphics Card, that's normal, I explained the hassle already.  "

,obdundar,2012-03-21T19:57Z,"Oh finally someone uploaded this game, thank you engineer79!!

Im gonna seed, but its downloading with 50kB/s."
,engineer79,2012-03-21T21:31Z,"@Gekkieaap
Thanks for the tip man.

@obdundar 
You're very welcome.  That's what I'm requesting you guys already so thanks for your understanding. If you don't seed, it's a pain for other people to download the game.  ""Please"" put yourself on other people and seed...

,Devy77,2012-03-22T23:07Z,Hey engineer79 thnx for the torrent (I'm seeding now btw). Have a lil problem though - how do I sync up my Xbox controller with the game? I tried changing controller settings (worked for some buttons)  but have a problem with movement (can only use keyboard)?
,engineer79,2012-03-23T01:25Z,"@Devy77 

Sorry, I have no idea about Xbox contoller compatibility of the game.  After all, this is a ported game, there might be some little problems compared to a native one.  Hope someone had the same problem like you do now will help you.  Thanks for the seeding."
,obdundar,2012-03-24T16:06Z,"It is working perfectly on my MacBook Pro 15"" 4 GB RAM. 
Still seeding btw"
,Gekkieaap,2012-03-25T16:32Z,"I have a problem whit the sound, cause it's not a good quality and later in the game i can't hear the sound anymore."
,yammmmmmmmmmmm,2012-03-26T19:35Z,@Gekkieaap Thanks man! Now seeding... Kudos to the uploader!

,Ewany819,2012-03-28T10:28Z,"Well I downloaded it, started a my player thing, played for about 2 days, I played on and off, meaning i closed the application many times. Then I went to play, opened the app, clicked my player and a wineskin error came up.  I redownloaded, started a new my player, finished playing, closed the app, opened it later, and it opened fine, but once i clicked my player, or anything (even the options menu) that same error came up.  Please help"
,Gekkieaap,2012-03-29T15:04Z,"Don't put all the settings high, set them on medium or low. May work betterr"

,jesse1523,2012-04-11T05:57Z,how do i download these apps nothing happens for me wen i click on the magnet
,mbananaaa,2012-04-11T07:01Z,"graphical glitches aside (there's some white dudes with black bodies), audio is really scratchy, cuts out completely at some point in the first quarter. by the second half, lag spikes and inconsistent game speed are making it almost unplayable (really hard to time a shot when the animation speed changes mid-shot). anyone getting the same things or find any fixes?

this port is nowhere near as good as the 2k11 port. they're basically the same game, no reason why this one should be so much worse."
,DavidisaBIMBO,2012-04-16T16:35Z,"@mbananaaa Yea man, same goes for me! Everytime I always play 2K12, there is constant lag spikes, bad game speed and dodgy gameplay (like the players, the glitches, audio, etc.) Thank God I'm not alone. Even turning down all of the game settings don't help. Shit."
,Jay_Rey,2012-05-19T08:50Z,"Hey, it isn't as bad as you guys above say although when i play my player, after winning the NBA with the heat, before the post game conference it says 2k12 has to close etc. what to do?"
,Jay_Rey,2012-06-07T09:59Z,"don't worry fixed that
