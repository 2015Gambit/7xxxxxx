[V],xtrancex,2012-03-16T20:26Z,"johan thanks but you get the original scene release this way and it`s easy to use ""medieval cue splitter"" if you want separate tracks. if i concentrate on just uploading i can do more releases. ;)"
,johan_9,2012-03-17T02:18Z,mate can you please split this album please would appreciate if you would specifically this album
[V],xtrancex,2012-03-17T11:41Z,"johan just google and download ""medieval cue splitter"" honestly it`s really easy to use. it`s drag and drop and will take you ten minutes to install and split this. the software is free. ;)"
[V],xtrancex,2012-03-17T12:58Z,"try this johan ""Swedish House Album (SPLIT + UNSPLIT) (Inspiron)"" i`m not sure exactly why inspiron bothered to upload both this way it`s pretty old music now to be honest. it`s at 1337x remember to say ty ;)"
,FileList1,2012-03-19T13:58Z,"So, this is good if you upload the unsplitted file with cue. So if somebody wants unsplitted... here it is. If somebody wants splitted... with medieval cue splitter makes it splitted. SO GREAT!
Thank you for all your uploads, and please keep up the good work !

One question: What about ASOT Radio Top 20 MARCH :) ? Can you upload it?"
[V],xtrancex,2012-03-21T02:43Z,FileList1 no date on ASOT but could be this weekend. if i get the Full Stereo wAx scene release i`ll share it sure. i wont uploads incomplete releases that have just been made up though. :)
