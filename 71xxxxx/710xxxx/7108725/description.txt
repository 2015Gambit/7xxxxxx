Dig, fight, explore, build! Nothing is impossible in this action-packed adventure game. The world is your canvas and the ground itself is your paint.
Grab your tools and go! You can do many things in Terraria: make weapons and fight off a variety of enemies in numerous biomes, dig deep underground to find accessories, money, and other useful things, gather wood, stone, ores, and other resources to create everything you need to make the world your own and defend it. Build a house, a fort, even a castle, and people will move in to live there and perhaps even sell you different wares to assist you on your journey. But beware, there are even more challenges awaiting you... Are you up to the task?

Q: What separates this from all the other Terraria torrents out there?
A: I have decompliled the game and edited the source code to do 2 things.
Remove all steam dependency. And moved the games save folder to the current directory. In doing so it allows the game to be played on ANY computer via flash drive or network. and even rewrite-able CD. All your saves are kept nice and tidy in the same directory as the application. I will start adding more features to the game itself. But as for right now this is all I have done.

Q: Can I play online?
A: Yes you can. Any server you can find! You can also host.
