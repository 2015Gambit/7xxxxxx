,shaneo88,2012-03-17T05:55Z,"Nice for all those people that dont want to buy the game OR dont have Steam on every computer they want to play it on... 

Just a quickie. What version is this?"
,AnthraX2112,2012-03-17T06:02Z,The latest. I forgot to add that xD
,RegginRellik,2012-03-17T18:14Z,"when i go to host, my game crashes with a long ass error? what am i doing wrong?
(note that this is my first time playing terraria)"
,AnthraX2112,2012-03-17T18:46Z,You have to have port 7777 open. Goto there website and download the server from there.
,ChampGeck,2012-03-18T18:35Z,"Whenever i close out of the game it deletes my save data, is the anything i need to do to the ""Terraria .exe"" file?"
,AnthraX2112,2012-03-18T22:24Z,@ChampGeek It didn't do that for me in testing. There's nothing special you need to do. You just run it and go. I'll look into it though. Thank you 
,Luciphage,2012-03-20T05:50Z,"Works well for me on my not-so-swift Acer netbook. I turn down the graphics to low, background off & it runs pretty smoothly. Portability is always a plus. Thanx!"

,AnthraX2112,2012-03-26T07:58Z,@xXaugisXx  Read the prior comments. It's the latest
,twotails,2012-03-30T06:26Z,"when ever i run the application  i get a msg that teraria has stopped working -.- im probably doing something wrong, i downloaded it, unzipped it. and ran the application "
,zaczac12,2012-04-08T05:29Z,"@ChamGeck i just use winrar and when i colse it asks me if i want to save file to archive, and it works"
,ftvguy,2012-04-29T21:41Z,i cant play the game if i drag it directly to my desktop i extracted it already and i can only play it from the file itself...
,Borgarath,2012-05-13T23:29Z,"^That is why you right click the terraria.exe and make a shortcut for it. Then drag it on the desktop and it works. If you want to change the icon picture,  get a 512x512 or 256x256 pixel picture and make it into a .ico file. Look up .ico converter and then right click that shortcut you made and look for 'change icon'."
,Jamm3r,2012-05-25T19:19Z,"When I click on the application, the mouse makes the loading circle and then it just stops. I'm rather new to torrents so how would I resolve this issue?

I will not delete system 32."
,DoubleDildoKunt,2012-06-09T20:39Z,"Protip: If you're having trouble getting this game to run, try installing Microsoft XNA and .NET Framework 4.0 included with the torrent."
,magikarpkilledkenny,2012-08-09T21:21Z,"Mine won't save when I close. If I quit and go back to the menu, then re-enter the game, it's perfect, but when I close out it entirely reverts to the save I had at the end of the first day I downloaded it."
