The Bleak Old Shop Of Stuff... S01 + Extras - TVrip - Xvid

Set around a shop - but not about one - The Bleak Old Shop Of Stuff is a brand new TV series from Mark Evans, 
the writer and creator of Radio 4 hit series Bleak Expectations.

 Inhabiting the same world as the radio series, but "inspired" by it rather than being an adaptation, The Bleak Old Shop Of Stuff is a new four part comedy adventure about Jedrington Secret-Past, an up-standing family man and owner of The Old Shop of Stuff, Victorian London's most successful purveyor of miscellaneous odd things.
