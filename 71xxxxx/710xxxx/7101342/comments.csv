,IotIP,2012-03-20T07:25Z,"Magnet links not working automatically OR manually (Open URL). Using newest Vuze and Transmission with Firefox and Opera... Always fails to load anything (auto), error or ""Failed!"" (manual).
Anybody know how to correct this (not just make uninformed guesses), know the proper forum, or how to grab the link and retrieve an actual .torrent file?"
