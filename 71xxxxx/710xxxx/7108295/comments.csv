Just wanted to say, ""thank you,"" and let you know how much your efforts are appreciated.  It's difficult to find documentaries on TPB, much less ones that are well seeded, quality, and interesting.  MVGroup is the trifecta.  Well done and rock on.

Request:  Biographies - Both Famous & Infamous (Politicians to Serial Killers).  Wait.  I think both of those examples would fall under ""infamous""...

Anyway, thanks again and keep up the good work."
