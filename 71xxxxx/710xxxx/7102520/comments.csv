,cp49100,2012-04-19T20:36Z,By the way could you make tick tack a torrent because my internet speed is also shity...
,Mulaman,2012-04-20T04:36Z,"@cp49100 and @leaner No, this game isn't patched and you won't find one, since I haven't know a single fansub group translating it.

@leaner all links for Tick Tack and Really? Really! are working just fine. Try downloading the links again, or try my other torrent for th games.

@cp49100 wish granted..check it out in my account torrents ;D"
