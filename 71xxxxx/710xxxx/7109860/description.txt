This DVD consists of Michael Palin's first effort at travelogue, a 1980 contribution to 'Great Railway Journeys of the World', and also a 1994 contribution to the same series, now gone and sadly missed, although I suspect there aren't that many great railway journeys left. The 1980 programme is about going from Euston to the far North-West of Scotland.

The 1994 programme, made after he'd been around the world a couple of times and was presumably humbled a bit by the experience, is about going from the North of Ireland to the far South. It's also interesting as a snapshot of the North in the last year or so before the first IRA ceasefire, when the society was changing to a less sectarian and less violently inclined climate but the political situation and the paramilitary groups hadn't yet caught up.

Yorkshire. His mission fulfilled at the Kyle of Lochalsh, which route will he
