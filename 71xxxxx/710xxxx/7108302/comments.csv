,thedownside,2012-03-28T06:16Z,"alright assholes.. you need to read some comments.. first things first Booi3ie has take time out of his/her life to provide you with a piece of software that your ass is getting without paying Apple the $99US for. Second if your not getting it as fast as you like.. find someone else to get it from and quit acting like little tits!! 

Thanks a bunch Booi3ie for contributing to The Bay. Keep it up.. I appreciate the up!!

NOTE: if you don't understand how to install software stick to music and vid's.. also google is a great start for trouble shooting ur problem not The Bay.. we don't care if you can't get it working in VB or any other VM software.. read there sites.. comments are for people to report viruses or broken/corrupt images not for help!!

with that vented.. kiss my ass,

fuck you very much!!
