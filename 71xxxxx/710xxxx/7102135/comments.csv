Th-thanks, you too.."
,JtHih,2012-03-15T06:48Z,How do I play the files WITH the commentaries? When I play them with Windows Media Player and Dvix player it just plays the normal episodes.
,hench7,2012-03-15T13:29Z,"Try to use VLC Media Player or Media Player Classic. 

In VLC after you've started the video you just right click, Audio -> Audio Track -> Track 2"
,koziliya,2012-03-15T20:15Z,"Somehow it doesn't open good on my computer.  Info says it's 0 bytes empty.
Can anyone guess what's wrong? (I updated Utorrent and it still doesn't work)"
,hench7,2012-03-15T21:50Z,"You mean the torrent? Well, they only allow Magnet links on Piratebay now (so they don't even host the .torrent files) and it's a 'problem' with Magnet links that doesn't show the info. You have to manually choose the files you would not like to download in the uTorrent client under the Files tab for an active torrent."

,XzonkeyX,2012-03-26T22:09Z,all of these have ended up as an .MKV files and wont play in anything. how can i play them?
,hench7,2012-03-28T02:50Z,Have you tried VLC?
,zombie19,2012-03-31T23:00Z,"It looks like this doesn't have the subtitles for the Dothraki dialogue.  It does have English subtitles that can be turned on, but that doesn't tell you what's being said in Dothraki."
,AlexTB411,2012-04-01T13:42Z,There are no subtitles for Dothraki. Can this be fixed?
,hench7,2012-04-05T22:17Z,"I dunno, I ripped the subs straight from the DVD.. you might have to download other subtitles then

Try subscene.com"
,oo_500,2012-04-06T17:04Z,There are no commentary tracks. I checked with Pot player and Media Player Classic.
,hench7,2012-04-10T03:13Z,"Then you are doing it wrong.

And like said in the torrent info, they didn't make any commentaries for episodes 5, 7 and 9."
