       Plot.........: Adolescence is like a heavy rain. Even though you
                      catch a cold from it, you still look forward to
                      experiencing it once again. 
                      Ko-Teng has several close friends who had a crush on
                      Shen Chia-Yi. Those friends of Ko's thus moved in
                      unison from Ching Chengs junior high school straight
                      into the senior high school division in pursuit of her.
                      Naughty in nature, Ko was ordered by their homeroom
                      teacher to sit in front of honor student Shen for her
                      to keep close tabs on him. The two hadn't hit it off
                      at first but Ko gradually fell for Shen, who was
                      always pressuring him to study hard. On the other
                      hand, Shen became impressed by the contrasting
                      values Ko represented. Ko started pursuing Shen
                      but Shen remained hesitant.
