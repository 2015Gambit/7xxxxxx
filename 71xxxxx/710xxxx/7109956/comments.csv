Have you problem only with this game or something else? Maybe it's sound driver problem because it uses directx too."

1. If you are using vista7 run unpack.bat as admin.
2. Check your antivirus. The cause of instant finishing game install is probably missing file(s)
3. Check you must have all this files in torrent in one folder with unpack.bat to install game correctly."
