For the first time, psychology, neurology & physiology are linked to explain the human condition.
Why love is an important ingredient in determining how the brain and personality develop, and how they affect us for a lifetime. He has developed a method for going back in history to the source of unhappiness, depression, anxiety and addiction to undo the damage.

Primal Healing is Dr. Janov's magnum opus, the culmination of decades of clinical observation and research. Here he melds current research in biology and neurology with his clinical work to produce a definitive thesis regarding how any psychotherapy that uses words as the predominant mode of therapy cannot make profound change. Dr. Janov traces the route of feeling from the brainstem to the prefrontal cortex, indicating how repression sets in to block our feelings to create a whole host of neurotic behaviors and physical symptoms. He illustrates how effective therapy or "cure" involves unblocking the repressive barrier and allowing lower level imprinted feelings to rise to the frontal neocortex. All this is explained for the lay person
