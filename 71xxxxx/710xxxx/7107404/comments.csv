1) Where did the problem appear? In one of missions or after launching game?

Possible solution go to game folder -> extras and run oalinst.exe
If still doesn't work try reinstall"

This problem occurred right after an ambush  mission then reunite at the crossroads, then after new mission loads this error(1 sound file are missing or in a bad format) occurs. Hope you get it."
