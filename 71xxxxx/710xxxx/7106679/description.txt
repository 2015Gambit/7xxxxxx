Another rarity, albeit not from a limited edition.
The tracks are taken from a live recording of a concert at the "Sound Depot" in Frankfurt, on March 24, 1991, and were originally "released" as a bootleg entitled "Day of The Dawn". A year later it got its official anointment by the World Serpent Distribution label. According to Wikipedia this company died of exhaustion in 2004. Hence I dare sharing the CD.
