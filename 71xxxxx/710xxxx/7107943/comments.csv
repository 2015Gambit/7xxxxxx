,RealJohnRob,2012-03-17T07:40Z,"I doubt anything is coming up, this is just a lame teaser from TD.com, not actually upping every thing to TPB. the A/V gets out of sync about 20 mins in, that may be because of sky's encrypting though."
,andyxb,2012-03-17T11:25Z,"if u can upload the grand prix practice,qually and the race think u will be the only ones doin it cos i cant find it anywhere....if any1 else has can u give me the link.....thanks"
,drew1972,2012-03-17T23:41Z,"Thank you very much for the upload.  Unfortunately, the video is jumpy, and for an F1 purist, it's impossible to watch.  Better luck next time with your compression software."
