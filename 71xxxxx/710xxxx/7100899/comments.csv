,FarmmZ,2012-03-14T02:39Z,stuck on 2.1 and what do you mean by VLC player?

,james78911,2012-03-14T03:37Z,"Sorry my router messed up, its back on now. The audio is slightly out of sync, if you don't mind then ignore it. But if it bothers you, follow my instructions. "

,plumb1039,2012-03-14T11:19Z,ive just downloaded it and its a compressed file which says i need a pasword to unlock it does anyone know the pasword?
,plumb1039,2012-03-14T11:21Z,the file has a password on does anyone know what it is?
,james78911,2012-03-14T11:39Z,"There is no password, its video file not even in a folder. Can other people confirm this?"
,plumb1039,2012-03-14T12:27Z,the one ive downloaded from this torrent is in a file and when you try to open it it comes up requesting a pasword theres also a read me file which says you can find the pasword at a link and gives you an address then when you put the address in it takes you to some pay monthly site.....
,plumb1039,2012-03-14T12:27Z,ive deleted the file and im going to try and download again and ill let you know what happens.
,plumb1039,2012-03-14T12:33Z,"works fine now i downloaded it again. dont know what happend, thanks for uploading it "
,midge4th,2012-03-14T14:07Z,"if any of you want a better quality then search for Geordie Shore S02E07 WS PDTV XviD-W4F on google, it will be links like rapidshare and upload, it maybe slow speed like 100kb but its steady."
,FarmmZ,2012-03-14T18:03Z,The file don't even play? piss me off when people can't just upload normal files? and the XVid or whatever your going on about it's a scam to fill out survey so your wasting your time.

,james78911,2012-03-16T10:21Z,"Well not really for me because I watched them on tv, but for you, yes."
,missworld,2012-03-16T18:08Z,"Yes It's out of sync and yes it can be fixed however, can't fix the fucking shit quality. Avoid"
,kimi86,2012-03-21T11:05Z,"Good job james, i love this show and dont have MTV i dont care if the video is shit and the audio is aswell because im not an ungratefull little cunt, yous wouldnt be complaining if nobody uploaded it and you couldnt watch it so just say thank you to him and shut the fuck up about it please"
,james78911,2012-03-21T19:10Z,"Thank you, someone who actually appreciates what I do. I don't think people understand that it takes TIME to do this. It takes about 3 hours of my time just so you can watch this, I get nothing out of it, I'm just doing you a favour so please return it and don't be a top cunt."
,xtrem65,2012-03-21T20:30Z,"I do love what you do for us, however. Is this the last episode? I dont see a new one for today :)"
