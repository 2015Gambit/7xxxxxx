,bobob0077,2012-03-14T06:14Z,It's not downloading... why??
,hamof,2012-03-14T07:12Z,"probably because it can't find any seeders, ah well. it doesn't take long for a peer to become a seeder on a torrent this size."
,vg22,2012-03-14T10:15Z,"it's like there are no seeders, i've been downloading this for hours and nothing happened"
,aldaron1,2012-03-14T11:12Z,I've had it running for hours with no seeds also
,ImSoJaded,2012-03-14T13:12Z,0 (11) seeds and 7 (288) peers. 
,hamof,2012-03-14T15:17Z,"those who have already donwloaded keep seeding, at least 10 kb/s, it can help a lot on a file this small."
,ImSoJaded,2012-03-14T18:12Z,Now it's properly seeded. Thank you.
