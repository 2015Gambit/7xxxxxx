There's also apps for android phones/tablets, not sure about iThings but probably. Honestly cbr files are just renamed rar files, so you can also just rename the files to .rar and decompress them using a unRar'ing program to view the image files within."

,darkscale,2012-09-08T10:03Z,They're really just zip or rar archives. Just use one of those to extract the images - you may need to rename the file if the progs don't accept them as-is. Then just use an image viewer like irfanview or faststone (both are free and high qual.
