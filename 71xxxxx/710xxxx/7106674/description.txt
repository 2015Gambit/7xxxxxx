ESET NOD32 Smart Security 4+Fix

this is Eset Smart Security 4 with mara trail fix.

(I have found that update does not work with this fix anymore. i keep getting the error message- "update information not consistant". to fix this i have entered the following server to the list of update servers in advanced setup tree:   http://update.eset.com/eset_eval/   
-this seems to fix the problem although u may have to manually choose this server each time u want to update)

tested and working on: windows xp pro sp3 x86
                       windows 7 pro sp1 x64

enjoy!
