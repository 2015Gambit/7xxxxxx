,lotus420,2012-03-15T04:23Z,Don't download!  Only 8 minutes long and audio is out of sync.  The rest of the south park torrents for season 16 ep. 1 are the same version.  Even on the streaming sites like watch series and 1 channel... it is all the same messed up version.  Does someone have a working link???  I am going to cry.  I never miss a premiere!
,carsten.666,2012-03-15T04:24Z,wait for fixed.
