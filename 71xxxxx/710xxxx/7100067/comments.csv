,hesus89,2012-03-13T20:09Z,"im sorry dude, but your savegame kinda sucks.

just google masseffect saves for more, theres whole website of them."
,wmd23,2012-03-13T20:41Z,"What Hesus89 said. That entire site has saves for just about every possible combination of ME1, 2 & 3 possibilities available."
,hedwerk,2012-03-13T20:43Z,"hesus89 -instead of moaning at the bloke simply don't comment! I mean.. wtf...

Oh no wait, I guess it made you feel superior for that fleeting moment in time..."

Dude, if you don't like it, don't download it..  Just because you just turned 13 years old doesn't mean you can disrepect your elders."

ps: the Tali suicide video is soo sad !"
,Dufox,2012-03-14T16:38Z,"i lost my mass effect 2 save and tried playing me2 after playing me3. simply couldnt do it lol

anywho i googled me2 saves and found a pretty sweet site

masseffect2saves
gotta put www. and .com (or can google it)

it has a picture guide on how to import and has alot of me2 saves. not sure if they have me3 saves but im sure they will soon if they dont.

this isnt spam i just found the site to be a godsend and figured id pass the word."
