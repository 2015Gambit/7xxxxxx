[V],mirrormaster82,2012-03-14T20:57Z,c2c
,Xpatriated,2012-03-14T21:25Z,"Hmm.  I see.  Hmm...
My OCD is telling my to post a noads version, but it just feels wrong.  So much like duplicating.

Hey Everyone!  You can remove ads from your comics at home by unpacking the cbr or cbz file and removing the unwanted frames before repacking as cbz!  Isn't that crazy?!  It streamlines your reading and saves harddrive space!  Try it today!

That's better.  Now I'll be able to sleep at night."
