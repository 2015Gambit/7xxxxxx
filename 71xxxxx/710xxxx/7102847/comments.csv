This record was made in the Trade Winds Club in Inglewood, California, on 16 June, 1952. It was re- issued in 1992 under the label Jazz Door (JD 1209). The sound quality is not ideal. There is apparently a warning on the original disk: ""Historic Recording: please mind recording date when judging the sound quality""."
