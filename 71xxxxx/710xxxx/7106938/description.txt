Continuing in the Jewel Quest Mysteries franchise, Oracle of Ur is the fourth installment this time following Emma, Rupert and Sebastian on their journey across the Middle East (and beyond) on their quest for the Oracle of Ur, the ultimate jewel board. Scattered along your path are duplicate jewel boards that may contain clues as to where to find the Oracle of Ur, and youΓÇÖll run into more than just a bit romantic tension between our three heroes before all is said and done.

Like past installments, Oracle of Ur is far more a hidden object game than a match-three one. YouΓÇÖll make your way through some fairly standard point and click gameplay, unlocking scenes or puzzles as you go along (like a tile rotation puzzle that has you opening a locked door, for instance), and only occasionally actually coming across a new jewel board to complete. These hidden object scenes simply ask you to find a selection of items on a list, but there are also jewel board fragments, gems and hint coins scattered throughout each location, making this a more lengthy experience if you wish to find each and every item available.
