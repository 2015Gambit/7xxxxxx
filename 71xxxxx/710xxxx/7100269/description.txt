Laure Pester, professionally known as Lorie, is a French singer. Her fame can be attributed to producer, songwriter and composer Johnny Williams (grandson of 'musette' accordion star André Verchuren) and her father–manager Dominique Pester (a former studio manager at French radio station RTL). She is sometimes also referred to as the French version of Britney Spears.

Lorie is a multi-platinum singer who has sold over eight million albums and singles worldwide as of December 2007. Her first studio album Près de toi was certified triple platinum in France and she followed it with five other certified albums. It was expected that Lorie would start working on a new album, the follow-up to her 2007 record 2Lor en moi?

Lorie is also a comedian. She lent her voice for many French versions of international movies such as Stuart Little 2. She stars in the TF1 TV film De feu et de glace, and guest-starred as a Parisian model on the highly successful American soap opera The Young and the Restless.

She has also launched a clothing line, “Lorie”, only found in the Z stores in France. Her contract with Z was over in early 2009.

2lor en moi ? is French pop singer Lorie's fifth studio album, and her ninth album overall. It was physically released on November 26, 2007 and digitally on September 27, 2007.

Lorie helped promote both the album and "Je vais vite", the lead single, by performing on shows like Star Academy (France), Hit Machine among others. She was also interviewed by multifarious magazines. Three singles have been released until now : "Je vais vite" (September 23, 2007), "Play" (April 7, 2008) and "1 Garçon" (December 5, 2008).

2lor en moi? has been very well-received by pop critics. Lorie's previous records were very similar to the old Britney Spears albums but now her come-back album sounds like Kylie Minogue.
