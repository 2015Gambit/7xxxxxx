Digitally remastered and expanded mono edition of this 1967 album from the Sunshine Pop act including bonus tracks. Insight Out, The Association's third LP, sported two of the biggest singles of the band's career: 'Windy' and 'Never My Love.' Produced by Bones Howe (5th Dimension, The Turtles, Elvis Presley), Insight Out showcased The Association at the commercial peak of their powers. This edition features the original mono mix of the album, which has been out of print since 1967. The 16-page, full-color booklet includes rare, unpublished photos and extensive liner notes featuring the participation of original band members.
