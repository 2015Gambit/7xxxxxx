I can't imagine you could look at an autistic child or any other child searching for some conclusion to his father's death; searching for something that will make sense to the madness that he and many other families and children had to endure and even hint that this amazing endeavor is terrible, let alone boring. It seems out of the mouths of babes this rhetoric comes, and I use that term very loosely."
