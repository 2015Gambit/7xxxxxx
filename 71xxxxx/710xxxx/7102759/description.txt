Overview: The last time farmer Dexter McCray went off his medication, someone wound up dead. So, after waking from an alcoholic blackout to discover his tractor stuck in a ditch and the body of a teenage girl in the cottonwood grove bordering his cornfield, things look worryingly familiar. 
With no alibi and a creeping suspicion that he might indeed be guilty, Dexter decides to investigate the crime himself. He canΓÇÖt tell anybody. Not his friend, the sheriff, who keeps offering to help him winch his tractor out of the ditch. Nor his estranged wife, whose love heΓÇÖs desperate to win back. And certainly not the Tollivers, his redneck neighbors.
Fortunately, DexterΓÇÖs not entirely alone. He has some help. 
In the shape of the dead girl herself.


Enjoy!
