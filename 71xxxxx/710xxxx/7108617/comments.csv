Seriously, if you have any suggestions for a better image host, please let me know.  I need one that makes it easy to upload multiple images into a gallery that I can link to."

Maybe because i'm using Adblock & Noscript with Firefox and Chrome."
[V],bestec1234,2012-03-17T21:10Z,"The ""continue to your image"" link doesn't show up all the time.  I think it's only if it's the first time you've gone to imagebam since you opened your browser."
