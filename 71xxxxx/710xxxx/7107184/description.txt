This game is a retro-styled platformer with puzzle and action elements. You take control of Yuri, an astronaut whoâ€™s come from the Great Mother Planet.
Low on fuel, now you need to find some way to get an alien power core and avenge your planet, defeating your arch enemy, Grigori.
The main game mechanic is the clever use of a teleportation device, to move around the levels.
