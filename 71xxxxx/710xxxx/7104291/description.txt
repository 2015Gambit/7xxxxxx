Hi there

This is an update from vlc media player 2.0.0 Final to the new vlc 2.0.1-Win32 version dated from : March 14,2012.
Beware as it is a beta version anyway.
Should/may solve few little stuff...
This new version is still under development and try to fix few different bugs found to last official Final version of vlc 2.0.0 TwoFlowers anyway.
However,i don't have yet the full change log of what has been already fixed so.
This version should also work on Win64 OSs.
As i have myself few little problems with vlc 2.0.0 Final i just decided to update to this new updated version 2.0.1.
See yourself if you wanna give it a try to this new one to see if better for you so.

enjoy and regards

a nice day to all
