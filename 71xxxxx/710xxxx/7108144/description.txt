Something of a missing link between Ornette ColemanΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Free JazzΓÇ¥ and John ColtraneΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Ascension,ΓÇ¥ this recording is superior to those performances in its freer, truly group-oriented format, with no specified soloists and accompanists. Joined by the trumpeter and cornetist Don Cherry, the saxophonist John Tchicai, and the trombonist Roswell Rudd, as well as by Peacock and Murray, Ayler guides the group through the powerful authority of his playing; the riotous revelry joins the joy of New Orleans traditions to the urbane furies of the day. ~ Richard Brody, The New Yorker
