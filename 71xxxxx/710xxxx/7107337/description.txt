Mud Men with Johnny Vaughan
This guerrilla archaeology series, starring Johnny Vaughan with his guide Mud God Mudlarker Steve Brooker, reveals the astonishing mud-covered, hidden history of London. Vaughan and Brooker are on an adventure, digging up the banks of the Thames to reveal a unique and original perspective on London s rich history. Armed with metal detectors and shovels the pair have just five hours before the tide rushes in to wade, search and dig the banks of the River Thames finding artefacts, from jewelled daggers to slave manacles, medieval tiles to cursed Bellarmine pots, which lead them on a quest



5)  Prisons 
Today's penal finds on the Millbank foreshore, site of London's largest Victorian prison, result in Mud Men Johnny Vaughan and Steve Brooker looking at life inside. Johnny gets banged up in the secret remains of London's oldest surviving prison while Steve experiences solitary confinement as he explores the Victorian idea of rehabilitation. And it's a painful experience for Steve at the hands of enthusiastic rooky interrogator, Johnny, as they get to grips with rough justice in the form of torture.
