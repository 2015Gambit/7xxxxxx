,DJ_SEVEN,2012-03-17T13:09Z,"Well this game was CRAP, pure and simple

RE4 and 5 is still in the lead

1.A.I really, really sux
2. Graphics are Horrible
3. Gamplay is average. no escape or jump feature
4. Choppy and laggy

Well after an hour its clear the fucked up this game, nothing comes close to the first series.

Shame though i looked forward to this, but no

Thanx to boobs though for the effort, got i from a much much faster place, NG3 is ok though, good action and ok for a sequal!"

,95dcmimpapa,2012-03-19T01:49Z,"Reporting back after playing for a few hrs, and I have to say I'm very dissapointed with this series. The graphics are seriously lacking compared to the newer games such as Gears 3 and MW3. Gameplay is very sloppy also.  Capcom really dropped the ball on this one, as I have been anticipating to play this game for a while. Rather we get a game that looks like a souped up Saints Row ""2"". I hope they dont continue this path with RE6."
,sage1210,2012-03-19T02:33Z,"honestly, i not surprise why graphic and story mode are so plain like this.

cause this game aim to sell as mmo co-op game. that why they reduce graphic to maintain frame rate and bandwidth for playing online.

in another word, this game not worth for play off line as single player mode.  

better wait to see what version pc look like in the next 2 months."
,rogue-op,2012-03-19T04:33Z,"why are some of the new games XGD2? 

I thought that all of the newer games are supposed to be XGD3. 

Does anyone know why? "
,Vertutame,2012-03-19T12:10Z,"THIS IS NOT region FREE version.

,kedawa,2012-03-20T06:44Z,"Something is definitely up with this torrent.  I've been getting less than 5k/s download for the past two days, but I normally get 200+k/s, and none of my other downloads are slow.
