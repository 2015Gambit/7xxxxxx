Details:

The album is McLean's first as a solo artist, although he once toured on his own as alter-ego Johnny No Name. McLean describes Have It All as "something fans of the Backstreet Boys will take notice of, thanks to it's slightly risqu√© vibe". For the album, McLean worked with a number of hitmakers like Kristian Lundin and Dan Muckala. "It's kind of a cross between a little bit of rock and funk and a little bit of dance," McLean said of his debut. "It's a well-rounded record. I'm really proud of it and I've been working on it for almost five years. It's going to be a great, great record."  McLean released a single from the album, "Teenage Wildlife", with a video directed by Wade Robson.
