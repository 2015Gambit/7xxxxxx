The new release of Eternity by Paul van Dyk, sung by Owl City's Adam Young!  I enjoyed Adam Young's "Youtopia" with ATB; it's nice to see another electronica release of his!

Bitrate is 213 kbps (VBR), converted from original Itunes download (256 kbps) using SoundTaxi Pro (to break DRM).

Enjoy!!
