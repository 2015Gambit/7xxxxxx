,HostZombie,2012-04-03T03:30Z,"Yes, This is a cracked app. You need a jailbreaked iPod, iPhone or iPad to use this. You'll need Appsync to sync this from itunes to your jailbreaked iDevice. Dont bother downloading this app from anywhere else than TPB its unreliable since the connection dies from Apptrackr Installous etc."
