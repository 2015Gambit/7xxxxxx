Hello everybody

After downloading a lot (and re-seeding), I would like to now participate;

This is my first upload, so be forgiving/cool about my possible/probable mistakes/imperfections ! (and I'm not natively english-speaking)

The following software is a bit old (2003-2006) but simple to use and works on PPC, core, duo and intel i5 including Snow Leopard (not Lion);

Makes basic statistical calculation,  linear or polynomial regression curves with adjustable coefficients, and various 2D plots with lots of colours and symbols; not quite like Excel or Stata, but MUCH easier to use;

I will seed several days; please do not hesitate to inform me about what I possibly could have done wrong;

thnx
