[T],iamgreat,2012-03-15T10:13Z,"This release was nuked because it has the described video instead of the standard audio... kinda like that release of Flashpoint near the end of s4.  That means when Jake gets smacked in the back of the head by Malachy because he again did something stupid the audio track would include ""Malachy hits Jake in the head and walks out of the room"". In the US they often call this ""descriptive audio"" but this is a Canadian show and in Canada it is called ""described video"".

The release from IMMERSE has the same problem. 

2HD did x264 720p and 400p PROPERs as well as an XviD release as usual. I'll wait a bit and see what gets uploaded by others before i decide on how to use my rather minimal seeding capabilities. 

And to IGGLE2, yeah these often have .rar files because that is how these scene groups package shows and some uploading groups don't unpack the .rar files but rather leave that to the end-viewer."
