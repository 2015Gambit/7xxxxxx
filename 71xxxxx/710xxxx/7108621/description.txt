The Visitor (1997) -USA SciFi miniTV Series (About UFO abductee who steals a craft and comes back home)

its a old series.. I watch the first episode but not the rest and quiet
enjoyed it

people in to UFOs Aliens and UFOlogy will like this series

not as good as Dark Skies Series I uploaded here last year
and a bit different then the UFO 1960 series and Project UFO
but you can find a complete list of scifi shows many of them
with a UFO or Alien theme here (sadly I have pretty much all
the collections.. 90 percent of them anyhow)
threshold was other good series that was canned half way through
if you not seen that one.. its also on UFO encounter at sea
