,Demon_Raho,2012-03-17T21:14Z,"@ far_kit I'm the same as you. But then I started using Convertxtodvd and it works with almost any format extremely fast and makes them look good. But I still don't like h264 because I play back a lot on the Wii now with WiiMC and it can choke on a lot of MP4 videos.

Anyway, thanks TvTeam."
