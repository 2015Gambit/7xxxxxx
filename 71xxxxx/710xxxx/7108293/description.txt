                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The story of Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton's 500-mile journey across 
 Antarctica in her latest charity challenge to raise money for Sport Relief. 
 With the help of cross-country skis, a kite and a bike, she travelled to the 
 South Pole in temperatures as low as -36C, and had to endure blisters, not 
 washing for weeks and a cough that threatened to give her pneumonia.   
                           
                                 Enjoy!
