ItÂ´s just the normal Fanmade translation, nothing super special^^
The usual stuff :D"
,alexff37,2012-03-16T12:01Z,"Its not so easy to patch it for dolphin. normal patch just crush the emulator.

You need Wiiscrubber (1.4) + partitionbuilder (1.1).

Load ISO in wiiscrubber

Extracting key partition files:
1. Expand Partition:2 (DATA)
2. Right click + extract the following files:
-partition.bin
-boot.bin
-bi2.bin
-apploader.img
-main.dol

Save them all to a folder like ""ff4sys"" or something.

Data files: Right click Partition:2 (DATA) -> Unencrypted Partition -> Extract
Save to a folder like ""ff4data"" or whatever you want.

Patch files: Download + Extract the patch files. You need to copy these to the appropriate folders in the data files partition you extracted (""ff4data"" in my example). These are the corresponding paths:
BigFontGhostList -> HideItem or SmallFontGhostlist -> HideItem
Chapters -> RSL
Credits -> RSL
Item -> HideItem
Menu -> Miya
Miya -> Miya
RSL -> RSL
Songs -> SNDSTREAM

Rebuilding the partition:
1. Open partitionbuilder.exe (make sure you have version 1.1!!)
2. Load up the files it needs (extracted to ""ff4sys"" in my example).
3. Source file directory is the data partition you extracted to a folder (""ff4data"" in my example).
4. Click build, remember the filename you saved it as.
5. Wait. When it finishes, exit partitionbuilder.

Back to Wiiscrubber:
1. Right click Partition:2 (DATA) -> Unencrypted Partition -> Load -> Open the partition img you built in partitionbuilder.
2. Wait. Once it finishes you can exit Wiiscrubber and you'll be all set.

Normal patch only works for real wii"
,mrpinkeye85,2012-03-18T00:43Z,has anyone tryed on a softmod wii? i tryed the other patched version and it freezes halfway through frist level. is this one better?
,alexff37,2012-03-18T01:11Z,Wuppertaler79 tried and it works
,Ryusei,2012-04-02T21:12Z,"Okay.  This is my first time trying to mod any game for dolphin.  This is also my first time trying to use wiiscrubber or partitionbuilder.

However, I'm hot having an issue with the instructions until I get to this part:

""Patch files: Download + Extract the patch files. You need to copy these to the appropriate folders in the data files partition you extracted (""ff4data"" in my example). These are the corresponding paths:
BigFontGhostList -> HideItem or SmallFontGhostlist -> HideItem
Chapters -> RSL
Credits -> RSL
Item -> HideItem
Menu -> Miya
Miya -> Miya
RSL -> RSL
Songs -> SNDSTREAM""

Where am I supposed to get the patch to do this?  I'm fairly sure once I have the patch I can figure it out, but I can't seem to find an active link for said patch.  Any help would be very much appreciated."
,alexff37,2012-04-03T08:53Z,It's already patched
,Ryusei,2012-04-03T09:16Z,"So we're to skip that step and go straight to the 'rebuilding the partition' section?

I was under the impression that I needed to do those steps to be able to play the game on dolphin.

Sorry for being such a nuisance I just don't want to ruin the file beyond fixing and have to redownload it if I didn't need to in the first place >.>;"
,alexff37,2012-04-03T10:41Z,No you don't need to do anything just run the game 
,Ryusei,2012-04-06T01:55Z,"Okay~  I've gotten it to work.  But now I've run into another issue.

The second time you play as Misaki, when you have to enter in the code for the intercom - I go up to examine it and as soon as I hit next it takes me out of the screen and back into third person view.  Is this a glitch?  Is there a way to fix it?"
,Ryusei,2012-04-06T15:45Z,N/M it fixed itself after I rebooted the game.  Strange.
,Im_Cortez,2012-04-07T06:34Z,"If anyone can please seed, I'll be more than happy to keep seeding after..."
,AndrewZsz,2012-05-06T06:23Z,"Burned at 4x with a smartbuy DVD-R and it DIDN'T worked ):  

I downloaded 3 FF4 torrents already, but none of them worked for me!  

I have a 4.3 wii softmoded and Gecko at HBC to force ntsc... gecko just doesnt load the game and the disc channel crashes to an black-error screen saying that i have to remove the disk and restart the wii... any ideas?"
,dieagain20113,2012-08-16T03:17Z,"1. so if I start game with dolphin, then its English in-game? I dont need to run any exe to make it English?   
2. can u play through chapter 7 male part 2. with someone's ff4 torrent.when there is a panel with 3 buttons, a bug didnt let me photo ghost air around the panel, cant progress story.   "
,Kaylei,2012-08-27T13:31Z,"Quick question.  I've managed to get the game to load and actually work - but now I've run into a bit of a jam.

Once I get to the title screen, I receive a message that I can only assume is an error message (sadly, I cannot read Japanese).

Does anyone know how to fix and/or bypass it?  I'm thinking I don't have my emulated remote set up correctly (using keyboard), or maybe I have to delete something to make it work properly.

Any thoughts on this?"
