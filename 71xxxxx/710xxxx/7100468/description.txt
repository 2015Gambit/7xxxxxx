Hi Supagran2,
 
Nice to be appreciated !
I like to give a little back for everything that I download.
 

I upload to Sendspace for a friend, before I upload to TPB, and that takes ~45 minutes. 
When I uploaded to TPB last night, it took ~6 hours !!

I don't like to leave my PC on all night, but I'll upload for a couple of weeks to see if it improves.
 

If you want a link for the Sendspace upload, send me your email to macmoe@talktalk.net, 
or text it to 004478 4546 8895
