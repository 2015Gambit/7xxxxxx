,dread404,2012-03-19T14:12Z,"this is dodgy - i wouldn't download, way too many seeds in very little time"
,satanicpiggy666,2012-03-19T17:12Z,"Now, this torrent is extremely dodgy, but I have listened to the music, and it's pretty good. I don't know if you're the guy who makes the music, just trying to get a headstart, or what. But it's actually pretty good. Don't download the torrent, you can get the EP for free off of his website. Just google Billy Van Dubstep."

,jokkum74,2012-03-30T01:12Z,How THE FUCK does this torrent get so many seeders??? Music is below average. No way this music will hit the charts!!!! 
,D3C3PT3C0N,2012-03-31T12:03Z,This music is actually pretty good. I downloaded it before I signed up and the sound was amazing. Billy Van should try to expose his music more.

Trance will never die!"
[T],FaeGiN,2012-04-15T00:07Z,"So many people with half a brain...can you not engage the brain before typing? At least google a bit...
This, like other torrents, has had the promotion of Utorrent, which will mean it has lots of seeds.
Whoever equates lots of seeders with a virus is fucking crazy!? What is the link?
Also it is a rare virus that jumps out of an mp3. . . Not impossible but trust me, it won't happen to you any day soon."
,OceanNanners,2012-04-19T20:27Z,"Ok so itÂ´s like (approx.) :
