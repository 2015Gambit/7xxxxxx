New, free instrumental EP from up and coming producer Billy Van.  Billy Van is a young producer from the Midwest making a serious run at the EDM scene. With a strong musical background and the willingness to push the envelope, his works range from gutΓÇÉwrenching dubstep to acoustic pop.

Stepping out of the producer role and into the artist spotlight, Billy has put together an EP of remixes.  This version, through BitTorrent, is an instrumental EP.

The debut dubstep album in its full form features remixes of LMFAO, Breathe Carolina, Chris Brown, Lights, and Eiffel 65. This mix of classic hits and current jams has something for everyone. Featuring the unique musicality that Billy brings to his dubstep and the signature growling basses and wobbles, this EP isnΓÇÖt one to skip 
over. You can get the full free download at http://billyvandubstep.com/
