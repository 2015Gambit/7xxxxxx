Rough Diamonds is the sixth album by rock band Bad Company released in August 1982.

Rough Diamonds, like its predecessor, Desolation Angels, was recorded at Ridge Farm 
Studio in Surrey, England in March and April 1981 and engineered by Max Norman 
(famed for his work with Ozzy Osbourne).

It was the last album by Bad Company's original lineup. The sessions were rough going 
from the beginning. First, their manager, Peter Grant, withdrew from view after the 
death of Led Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham in 1980. That same year, the murder of John 
Lennon made the band change their way of thinking. Then, on another occasion, a fistfight 
broke out between Paul Rodgers and Boz Burrell, only to be restrained by Mick Ralphs and 
Simon Kirke.

The album's opening track, "Electricland", written by Rodgers, was the album's biggest hit. 
Rodgers' "Painted Face" also received substantial airplay on rock stations.

The album became the original lineup's worst selling album, reaching a disappointing 
#26 on the Billboard album charts in 1982.
