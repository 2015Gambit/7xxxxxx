,sean468,2012-05-05T12:10Z,"SERIOUS WARNING GUYS: This game gave me 3 RROD Twice in a row, i ran it through abgx 1.0.6 and burnt it with imgburn, same method as i use for all xgd2 games. The first time it gave me RROD was when i was starting the game and i arrived at the group of people at the very start of the game, it crashed and poof, RROD! I reset the xbox a few times and it was working again, once i started to play the game again i started to think it was just unlucky, but then again, still as a kid in the start of the game i get a crash and a RROD that doesnt go away! I did end up fixing with the towel trick but i warn anyone who wants to use this, just because of my experience with this img, i would never use it again. I am aware that Bone is a respected member and i do not intend to disrespect him, im just reporting what happened to me, TWO DAYS after i bought a flashed xbox. was quite a shock"

I call bullcrud.  I don't think there's any way a video game gives you RROD.  And it's your fault if you use that crummy towel trick.  Man up, and actually fix the Xbox by cleaning up Microsoft's crud.   RROD is because of faulty solder and thermal paste."
,sean468,2012-05-12T17:00Z,"The comment from before was not ""bullcrud"" as in i was not being some troll just lying randomly. It just happened to be a co-incidence that the two times i ever ran this disc on my newly bought xbox it crashed and went straigh to RROD, i was aware that discs should not be able to cause such a problem, but the way it was happeneing really made me think the img must be dodgey. I would personally never have risked doing the towel method on anything i bought - unless the seller directs you to... so i did cos its his fault if it fucks up. anyways i sent it back and getting a replacement sent, it turns out my motherboard needed reflowing, it was just an unlucky situation.
