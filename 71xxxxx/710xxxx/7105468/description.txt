I wanted to share the wealth with you as this game is REALLY hard to find for Mac.

This game is the CIDER-port. It works quite good, just don't tweak the graphics as they will have strange graphical side effects. 

- Works on my Macbook Air 2010
- Works on Lion (Should work on 10.5 and 10.6 too)
- Its a Cider port. Works better (imo) then the WineSkin Wrappers

I wont't be able to seed 24/7, but if you download it, i'll do my best to seed as much as possible.
