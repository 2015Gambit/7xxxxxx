,aruna_r,2012-03-17T05:17Z,"Hi guys
I just downloaded this and installed it

but i cant seems to get it working
every time I execute the masseffect3.exe it shows error message saying
""Application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Re installing the application may fix this problem""

I tried reinstalling but problem remains same.

my system configurations are
Windows xp sp 3
2 GB ram
Nvidia Gforce 8500GT 256mb 

I know my graphic card is below minimum requirements but i don't see how this error is related to it. it would be logical if game starts with screwed graphics :(. 

Any suggestions on this?

thank you"

,Geminem,2012-03-31T15:17Z,"i knew the skull besides their name meant something. the game works like a charm and also allows character import as far as i can tell ( cause i havent completed the game so i wouldnt know for sure) but its a safe bet. Download , i am seeding."

,Shaboot,2012-06-06T08:49Z,"Any idea how to get the in-game Console Commands to work?  I looked up the tutorials and none of them seem to be of any help, i think specifically because this is a reloaded version. 

I could not find the proper offset lines to edit within my hex editor.

Any Help??"

,brk254,2012-07-02T10:15Z,"Works great! I was really nervous about executing a batch file. But it runs fine, I'm able to import my ME2 character, no problem with saves or sound or anything. Only thing I needed was to install a video driver. physX or something I don't know but the error message gave me the exact link from nvidia to download it and everything works fine."
