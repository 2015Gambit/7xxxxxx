,trunksy,2012-03-17T22:08Z,Why wouldn't we want to install this on Windows 8 previews? This isn't the technical preview with the Metro UI?
,foxeiy,2012-03-18T04:27Z,"Because even if you install it on windows 8 successfully, it'll fail to start the programs because it detects that the OS is not a version of windows 7"
,uchihasasuke2709,2012-03-27T21:57Z,"Doesn't Matter, just right click and select it to run in windows 8 and it will."
