,chedderz66,2012-03-15T02:16Z,All of these R6's SUCK! I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this looks like a TS  It's watchable if you're desperate but I'm waiting for a genuine quality R5  Thanks anyway. 
,STAY-AT-HOME-GAMER,2012-03-15T04:27Z,Don't download this torrent it is broke. First cd will not extract It says this archive is either in unknown format or damaged. The second cd extracted just fine.
,williebk,2012-03-15T06:05Z,Does this have hardcore alien subs like every other one?|
,williebk,2012-03-15T06:45Z,"Nevermind, the hardcore subs been cropped and cut up. I'll wait for a full-screen better non-hardcore subs copy.
Thanks for the effort."
