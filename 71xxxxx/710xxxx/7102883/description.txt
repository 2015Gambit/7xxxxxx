4)  Part 4 
The family face up to the reality of the food in the future. Mum Michele tackles the latest hi-tech gadgets making the move from restaurants to home kitchens, including slow-cook water baths that take an hour to cook the perfect steak, and liquid nitrogen machines that flash-freeze food - perfect for making ice cream in ten seconds. There are also super-fast soup makers and hot composters that turn a year-long job into one that takes two weeks. The family are also kitted out with the latest home-grow gadgets, including an aquaponics system that provides a self-sustaining fish farm in their greenhouse, a vertical veg patch for their garden wall (perfect for people with no growing space), and a soil-free growing machine invented by NASA They also discover how farming could become a high-rise urban industry. And they're not too impressed with the alternatives, as 'food futurologist' Dr Morgaine Gaye gets the family to try out future gourmet delights and cook up an insect meal, and we find out about a future that promises everything from lab-grown steaks to Japanese 'crap' burgers.
