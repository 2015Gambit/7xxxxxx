,PlumBastard,2012-06-01T19:18Z,Is it the installer or is it installed directory?
,LinDERP,2012-06-09T14:13Z,"After downloading and inputting the cracked serial, i have to mount the image each time in order to open the client, and when I try to play it either through mounting the image or launching the application it self, this comes up: ""Wrong disc inserted. Please insert the original 'Transformers - War for Cybertron' CD/DVD."" I is confused."
,PlumBastard,2012-06-16T08:32Z,"Okay guys, I've downloaded it and here are the details.
Game is an installer, installs right away real smooth. Yes it is CRACKED and in case you're downloading it from here, make sure you bookmark the page or copy the serial so you don't have to search for this page again for the serial.
On the whole, I still didn't play the game but just confirmed that it WORKS, and it does!!


System Requirements are as follows (I copied it from game documents):
    3D hardware accelerator card required - 100% DirectX(R) 9.0c-compliant 256 MB video card and drivers*
    Microsoft(R) Windows(R) XP / Windows Vista(R) / Windows(R) 7
    Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo E4300 1.80 GHz or AMD Athlon(TM) 64 X2 Dual-Core 4000+ 2.0 GHz
    2 GB of RAM
    9 GB of uncompressed hard disk space (plus 400 MB for the Windows(R) swap file and 12 KB free for saved games)
    A 100% Windows(R) XP / Windows Vista(R) / Windows(R) 7-compatible computer system including:
    DirectX(R) 9.0c (Included)
    100% DirectX(R) 9.0c-compliant true 16-bit sound card and drivers
    100% Windows(R) XP / Windows Vista(R) / Windows(R) 7-compatible mouse, keyboard and drivers
    100% Windows(R) XP / Windows Vista(R) / Windows(R) 7-compatible 6x speed DVD-ROM drive (600 K/sec sustained transfer rate) and drivers.


@LinDERP:
And for people who are having problems after installation, copy the file TWFC.exe from the disc's Crack folder to the ""C:Program FilesActivisionTransformers - War for CybertronBinaries"" and replace the older one with it. 

Thanks to the uploader, now I'm gonna see how the game is. :-)"
