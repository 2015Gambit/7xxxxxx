If you're going to criticize, make sure you have a good command of the language you plan to use to do so.

Your comment makes no sense. 

P.S., don't trust Google Translate!

Thanks sceneline!

What's wrong about that ???

That has been the way along years to release stuff from scene (to save net BW). Couldn't you just unrar the compressed stuff then in a couple of minutes get what you were looking for ???

TIA sceneline"
