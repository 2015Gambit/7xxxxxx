when I extract the .rar file I am left with amtlib.dll file.  I cannot find a copy of this anywhere in my photoshop content folders.  Please be more specific on what I am replacing and where..."
,Duglett,2012-04-12T13:14Z,"@DGinc I know you'll never see this, but your butchering of the french language prompted my response. It's ""Voila"" not, ""Wha la""."
,surfer236,2012-04-13T02:46Z,"Good crack, jhagopi.
Thanks"
,polomex,2012-04-13T19:45Z,"I registered simply because I had to say thanks. After scouring the Internet for serials and keygens and getting nothing but problems, this worked."
,D34THW41K3R,2012-04-14T04:30Z,"@neocrosby use the find function... ctrl+F in XP.. go to the program files folder, an then the photoshop CS 5.1 folder and copy the file there. simple as that"
,Futurella,2012-04-26T15:15Z,"Today I booted up my software to find it had reset to a trial, after having it for months. Guessing it was an update or something. But this crack got rid of that crap. Bravo.
One day, if I have enough experience with these programs, I might have a job that pays high enough to be able to BUY the damn software."
