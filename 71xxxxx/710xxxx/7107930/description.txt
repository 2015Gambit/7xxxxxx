After CIA Agent Paul Winstone was murdered, his wife, Becca, and their son, Michael, struggled to rebuild their lives. Now, 10 years later, Michael goes missing under suspicious circumstances, and Becca will do anything it takes to find him. Becca flies to Rome for answers, but no one takes her seriously -- so she takes matters into her own hands. Becca isn't just a mother looking for her son; both she and Michael's father were CIA agents, so whoever took Michael has messed with the wrong mother.
