,ScarletteSpider,2012-03-19T12:45Z,"Hey TVTeam, u do great work but are falling behind. Merlin season 5 debuted this past Friday night March 16th, so did the continuation of current season 7 for Supernatural, episode 16 was also aired friday night March 16th. Love ur high quality glitch free shows, just wish u were as quick to post them as Icefilms used to be. Getting ur stuff here because waiting 2 hours for a tv show to download from icefilms/(not so)rapidfire is freakin ridiculous"
