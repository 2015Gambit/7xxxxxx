I am pleased to announce the immediate availability of SolusOS Release Candidate 2
Many new features, fixes, and software versions have made their way into RC2. We hope you enjoy using this release. Please note that you can upgrade to final from the Release Candidates when  the time is ready.
We now have many updated applications, including LibreOffice 3.5.0 and VLC 2.0 ΓÇ£TwoflowerΓÇ¥. We are committed to delivering the most up to date applications that we can, on the most solid and stable base possible. This release also sees the introduction of the First Run Wizard. Documentation will soon be put on the SolusOS Wiki regarding the new tool, and the operating system. The tool helps you set up your system for the first time, including networking tasks, the firewall, graphics drivers, and how often to update the computer.
Now is the best possible time to get involved in SolusOS. Whether its in the forums, the IRC support or by contributing code or donations, you can help shape the future of our project. We are changing the current view on many things; the idea that you have to have a rolling or bleeding edge base system to enjoy new software is wrong. SolusOS refines many concepts, and allows you to enjoy modern software and stability, as it always should have been.
Last but not least, SolusOS is about enjoying your time behind the screen. Computing shouldnΓÇÖt be a mundane task, it should engage you and leave you wanting more from your computer, knowing that you can have more. Stick around, the ride has only just begun :)
