,ThCxProToTypE,2012-05-11T08:19Z,Could you possibly try correcting the patcher please?
,ThCxProToTypE,2012-05-11T08:23Z,"@tamer229 

Could you send me the files please? I can't seem to download the files from the torrent."
,Code11100,2012-05-29T01:20Z,"The Patcher doesn't work, 
actually, the installer is for the version 10.2.0.3 NOT 10.2.0.1, and the patch is for 10.2.0.1

Thats why the patch wont work!!
So This torrent is useless

i am 100% sure

By the way, thanks for the effort :)"
,unmarkedfaith,2012-06-10T18:25Z,sorry.  I'd not download this as 10.4.x.x is available in my torrents.
