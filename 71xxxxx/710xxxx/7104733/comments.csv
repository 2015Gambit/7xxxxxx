,Axeonus,2012-03-15T23:44Z,"I need something else to play?
like cd key, crack or sth?"
,Arbiter89,2012-03-16T00:05Z,"@Axeonus

Yes, you need to wait. Until 15th may, to be precise.  I'd love to see someone crack this, but the chances of that happening are slim to none.

Thanks for the upload!"
,BeyondMaster,2012-03-16T00:59Z,thx Espionage724!

,premiado,2012-03-16T04:52Z,"you need to be online to play this game, there is no single player. so there will be no crack."
,narmishe,2012-03-16T04:59Z,"tnx mate, no me3 was not cracked befor, it was cracked just 10 mins after the release!

,Espionage724,2012-03-16T05:46Z,I call fake on takeone_84's version. 4GB? The installer alone is 7.6GB...
,SkullRS,2012-03-16T09:33Z,"@ premiado:
There is Singleplayer and Co-op in the game. This is not MMORPG. But PVP arenas will be added later."
,steve30x,2012-03-16T10:33Z,@ premiado : You could say that about starcraft II also. Oh wait that wa cracked.
,Mighty Sheep,2012-03-16T12:35Z,"the difference is that diablo 3 map generation and most of other information will be server side like a mmo.
just because practically you can play singleplayer it doesnt mean technically you are not connected and no information is sent from the server. 
so yeah everything will have to be crafted by pirates from scratch. in the end it should be a fate of world of warcraft - so many years have passed and private servers are still buggy.

also notice how many recent mmos have private servers. not so many. only those that are simple grindfests of asian design or those that are rather old and pirates had time to build the whole emulator."
,Mighty Sheep,2012-03-16T12:38Z,"also note by 'information from the server' i dont mean something like ubisofts precious DRM for lets say assassins creed 2 or smth. that was one fundamentally flawed protection system.
it only sent 'keys' to unlock parts of the game, rather than ask server to generate actual content."
,Axeonus,2012-03-16T13:54Z,"@Arbiter89

Thank You for answer.
It's a shame that we can't play it now..
I was so excited yesterday.. :("
,agnosticj,2012-03-16T17:01Z,"@Espionage724:  No, the installer alone isn't 7.6GB.  That includes the game data."
,krksi,2012-03-16T19:26Z,Ok guys can anyone tell me if i download this game would i be able to play it afther downloading it

,krksi,2012-03-16T21:15Z,Ok guys can anyone tell me if i download this game would i be able to play it afther downloading it i meant to say is crack needed or...?
,j3ff78,2012-03-16T22:18Z,"***************************************
There WONT be any cracks for this game!!!! This is an online game. that means you need to connect to a server. So once again there WONT be any cracks for this game!!!!

But in time some people will come up with pirated(private) servers that you can play. But it will never be the same joy as playing at a battle.net server.
**************************************"
,Espionage724,2012-03-16T23:39Z,"@agnosticj what do you mean? I was saying that since the installer is 7.6GB, it would be far from believable that the game installed would be anything less then 7.6GB...

As for cracks, currently this (and the enUS version I uploaded) is encrypted by Blizzard. Basically, this is useless for anything except just having the installer ready for launch. There are rumors of people trying to decrypt it though. In any case though, there is a somewhat working emulator already for beta that ""in theory"" should be easy to port over to this."
,krksi,2012-03-17T07:54Z,Guys crack is not needed u neet to connect to main server this is like original cd it only needs conection to main serv and it works my friend triedi
,FuqDup,2012-04-09T19:25Z,"****
Finished downloading.
Ran Diablo III Setup.exe
Diablo III Setup: ""Updating setup files"".
Diablo III Installer: Install.
Diablo III Installer: ""The fire from the sky still falls. Diablo III has not yet launched.""

This is exactly how trying to install Diablo III will happen for most people. Crackers, get busy and thanks!"
,Tomax3,2012-04-25T13:04Z,"When executed offline it says:

,raiden92,2012-05-27T19:12Z,@Espionage724 now can I play online and single player mode?
,tflagger997,2012-05-28T01:00Z,"raiden92 - You have to buy the game.

No, there are no Cracks or Emulators that work with D3.
No private server, no access to Battle.net unless you actually buy a serial for it.

Everyone on YouTube is lying about having one, and most of the major crackers are not even looking into getting it working. What is really pathetic, is they will not even let their faithful fans know that they are not working on it.

So posting these things, and saying 'wait for a crack' is a scam. There may be an emulator eventually (6-12 months) but no time soon (unless YOU hack the Blizzard servers and get the other 2GB of assets they withheld). This is nothing more than a 8GB waste of time right now. "
,axinte,2012-07-01T15:38Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
