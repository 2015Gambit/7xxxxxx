Made in Europe is a live album released by Deep Purple, recorded on the final dates in 1975 
on which Ritchie Blackmore was a member of Deep Purple. It was released in 1976 after the 
group broke up.

Made in Europe features songs recorded live 4 April in Graz, Austria, 5 April in Saarbrücken, 
Germany, and 7 April 1975 in Paris, France with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. According 
to the liner notes included on Mk III: The Final Concerts, though, the material featured on 
Made in Europe came, for the most part, from the Saarbrücken show. Additionally, this 
performance is said to have experienced extensive studio editing and/or overdubbing of crowd 
noise and applause. Certainly there is a tape-loop of applause, given away by a whistling fan.

The songs featured on the album are from Deep Purple's Burn and Stormbringer albums.
