Thanks for the up :0)"
,QborT,2012-03-16T04:22Z,"This is labeled as 12 because of the confusion created by ""hearts of archness"" which some consider season 2 and others consider season 3."
,elDunge,2012-03-16T04:24Z,They actually released season 3 episodes 1-2-3 twice with different content. One of them probably were meant to be episodes 9-10-11
,rickrich9,2012-03-16T04:25Z,There were 3 episodes that aired in between season 2 and 3.  Depending on how you count them you might call this the 9th or 12th episode of the season.
,elDunge,2012-03-16T04:25Z,But I always wondered why is it still labeled 2009?
,Nirvelli2,2012-03-16T04:33Z,"@skweets The special 3-episode run last September was uploaded as the beginning of Season 3 at the time, but then when the show came back in January the ""scene people"" or whoever started over at S03E01, when it should have been S03E04. This is just correcting for that.

,Nirvelli2,2012-03-16T04:35Z,"@elDunge The ""2009"" is to differentiate from the other shows also named ""Archer"" from previous years:
