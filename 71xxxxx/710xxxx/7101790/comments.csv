It's the only disc the I get that erros, I always recored XDG3 files and always worked. Could someone help me? My Xbox is LT 3.0 +."
,ColbyCannon,2012-04-03T01:42Z,"Many thanks for this and all your other uploads boobsman!  I'm having the same problem with mine running on LT 3.0.  On my home screen it has the birds of steel icon with the option to ""Play Birds of Steel"" but when I run it I have the same disk error as kbnsalem.  Any suggestions or should I just try a third Verbatim disk?
Thanks again!"
