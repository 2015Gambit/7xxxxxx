,rooboy187,2012-03-17T11:26Z,Thanks mate for uploading this series. Much appreciated and like the avi format too. what program do you use to convert them from mp4 with ?
[V],psspss,2012-03-17T12:00Z,"i use free tools

google umile encoder 3.1.1.2

and also avidemux.org (more for editing and audio syncing without reencoding)

super converter also good with mcoder works with
some mp4 with audio issues but its installer is
riddle with ad ware tool bars so beware to untick them

perhaps i should bundle my collection with some
laypersons helpfiles sometime"
