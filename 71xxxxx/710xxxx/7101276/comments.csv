,xx.Morph.xx,2012-03-14T07:45Z,Many thanks for the up but what happened to Episode 10? was it uploaded?
,lifeson98,2012-03-14T15:16Z,I cannot find Episode 10 anywhere.  Please post that since I do not want to watch episodes out of order.  Thanks
,Doughie88,2012-03-14T16:16Z,"Yep me too.   S13E10 is AWOL, cannot find it anywhere.     Anyone ?  anyone?  Bueller??"
,H2010S,2012-03-15T01:08Z,I found the S13E10 by ettv in iso-hunt.
,H2010S,2012-03-15T03:43Z,"Sorry, looks like the one in iso-hunt are all fakes (according to the commenter over there).
Even with google search I can't found the 10th episode... --a"
,lifeson98,2012-03-15T13:33Z,Makes me wonder if maybe e10 was a recap show?  No one wants to watch those.
,blondynka,2012-03-15T16:30Z,"Ep 10 wasn't a recap. I watched the first few minutes of epiosde 11, and when they show the ""previously on the biggest loser"" segment at the beginning, none of the scenes are from episode 9. 

I am desperate for 10 :("
,H2010S,2012-03-15T16:47Z,"Yeah I think episode 10 was about... the eliminated contestant only.
But why is episode 11 only 369.64 MB ? The other episodes was like 700 MB. o_o"
,goodolandy,2012-03-15T18:31Z,"For those looking for EP10, go to rlslog dot net and in the comments for EP11 you will find two links for EP10 inside of comment post 19.

I have not watched it yet but did view some of the images displayed during my conversion from MP4 to AVI and it does appear to be a brand new episode, NOT a recap."
