,karimbaraka,2012-03-16T07:11Z,Thanks man keep em split :)
,SyndromeOfADown,2012-03-16T16:13Z,"I think it's crazy that armin keeps going with ASOT each week, even during the 550 ASOT celebration! The guy is legendary."
,rdb90,2012-03-16T18:46Z,"Dude! time n again ppl have thanked u more than those who wish u give unsplit versions... Well... We WANT split versions... and dude thanks a TON for that really.....

split that in class?? :O bow down to d expert!"
,MitsEvX,2012-03-16T18:52Z,"Thanks for letting us know your story! ;) I understand, but your work is still great enough :D Cheers and thanks! "
,buryking,2012-03-16T20:18Z,first when i started listening to the asot (episode 330) i was a big fan of unsplit 2hrs long run but then i found out some tracks are just not my type; started unsplitting myself and this was a hard work... so thanks for doing that tough job for me man; kkep it going man; thanks from poland!
,SyndromeOfADown,2012-03-16T21:21Z,"^ Same as buryking. I used to download unsplit and then get the cue file online and split with medieval cue splitter. Hell of a lot of work and this is why we appreciate you so much inspiron for your amazing turnaround time and dedication.

OH... and split tracks for ASOT 450 / 500 / 550 is like icing on the cake man. LOVE the way you split the artists into their own ""albums"" as 550.1 and 550.2 etc, so my music player easily puts them into albums "
,Andy-Ro0o,2012-03-16T21:21Z,"You are a God -inspiron-
As always I can count on you for my trance and progressive needs.
However, this time I'm putting in a request for something house ; )

Specifically, Armada House 2012 Vol. 1 "
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-16T22:07Z,"We thanks you for your quality! but come on adding the unsplit version to the side, is that (to time consuming?) THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU LIKE, all your fans (customers) want is the unsplit version on the side, let us choose if we want it or not "
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-16T22:15Z,"@Inspiron, checkout my ArtWork that i made for my PodCasts on my iPhone. I think you will like it, for next weeks episode!

[T],-inspiron-,2012-03-16T23:13Z,"OK ALL, I WILL QUIT UPLOADING , FOR GOOD !! I CAN'T KEEP BEING TOLD ABOUT SPLIT AND UNSPLIT !! SO I AM QUITTING UPLOADING



hahaha, scared right :P? i was joking, will not stop, but come on guys, what's the point of uploading files already exist online ?? it's not that i like or i don't like, it's because the files already there, but don't worry, i will do it the next time to see how ppl will be satisfied, :D :D that's good ? 

who's ready for trance videos vol 3 ? :D"
[T],-inspiron-,2012-03-16T23:19Z,"@mountainlion2012 : it's great, i like it, but the most important thing that armin appears in it, and the logo of usual a state of trance is in it, also as you see Qussay86 did with the covers, thank you :)"
,josegrande,2012-03-17T00:44Z,"Thanks inspiron!

,mountainlion2012,2012-03-17T04:53Z,"@Inspiron thanks for the feedback.

p.s. where online is the unsplit version then? (i just hate having to merge them in FinalCutProX, as it takes an extra 10min for the 2 hour show 2.30 hours for the ASOT550 shows)"
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-17T04:54Z,oops just reread what i missed thanks! and yes that saves the time above!
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-17T06:15Z,"ok thanks @Inspiron for the earlier critiques, i made some edits (started from scratch) hope you enjoy.

,7elos,2012-03-24T09:00Z,"Hello -inspiron- !

I just made an account just to say how much I appreciate you splitting and uploading these episodes. It means a lot to me! Love!"
,Shtefu,2012-06-23T07:01Z,"Thanks for uploading all of these, I was hoping I could find quality release here. Need everything from 552 and on.

And I gotta say I like them tracks separated, nothing wrong to it.

If people don't like the pause between they should just switch to foobar2000 player, the transaction is instantaneous"
