,SumHiDOOD,2012-03-16T03:56Z,how is this possible?they are on episode 9.where did 12 come from?
,logan-x-art,2012-03-16T04:04Z,"not a rant at ettv...but this switch to x264 and that shitty .mkv has the scene all jacked up...fuck these releases and fuck people who think they are quality...

...its shit...I would rather download a 500mb xvid.avi than download 150mb shitbird that is blocky as fuck...

...anyone like this jackass format should choke on a bag of dicks..."
,SumHiDOOD,2012-03-16T04:11Z,?
,jagr_200,2012-03-16T04:14Z,@ sumHiDOOD - the mini series in the beginning of the season was the first 3 episodes technically. It has been throwing off the numbers for everyone. It can either be episode 9 or episode 12. However you want to look at it.
,SumHiDOOD,2012-03-16T04:22Z,is it ep.9 or fake?
,SumHiDOOD,2012-03-16T04:23Z,ignore last comment..lol..thank you @Jagr
,DLord227,2012-03-16T04:27Z,I am afraid to sat this because of all the fun that was had at the number ing of the episodes earlier but did they put the special episodes in Heart of Archness in the season as eps. 9 10 and 11 Im not saying they did im just asking so dont take this as fact then say well DLord227 said so cause I dont know shit. Peace
,DLord227,2012-03-16T04:32Z,@jagr Its been established all season the Heart of Archness was NOT listed as the first 3 episodes of Season 3. They were made as a Special and not considered by the Archer website as well as the people running said site as a part of Season 3.
,maront1984,2012-03-16T04:37Z,"They are on episode 12 ""Hearth of archness"" 1,2 and 3 were the first of the season."
,Sparked29,2012-03-16T04:46Z,I too find the switch to MKV and h264 frustrating. I prefer XviD. I can play XviD files more easily on my devices. 
,jdveraser,2012-03-16T05:31Z,"you all need to quit your bellyaching, if you dont like .mkv or x264 then dont dl it. beggars cant be choosers. plus x264 is the new avi so either get with the program or quit getting quality FREE dls from eztv. btw, amazing work as usual ez."
,bassistk,2012-03-16T05:39Z,"I wish people would stop arguing about the numbering of the episodes. Here's the official list on FX.com and it doesn't show the Heart of Archness episodes as part of season 3.  

http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/archer/episode.php?season=3"
,TsarB0mba,2012-03-16T06:01Z,"I agree, FX has always had Heart of Archness as the last 3 episodes of season 2. I know it's thrown a lot of people off but up until this week everybody's had the right numbers (this is S3E9)."
,Agent4747,2012-03-16T10:48Z,Well Wikipedia says otherwise. This is technically E12. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Archer_episodes
,fryman1701,2012-03-16T13:09Z,"Seriously, quit bitching about .MKVs, They are becoming the standard in high-def video files.  Better quality than AVI's.  If you have trouble playing them, go download the CCCP and use Media Player Classic.  If your problem is that your PS3 or XBOX won't play them, quit using your stupid video game console to play your shows and play them straight from your computer.  Thanks for the up EZTV, great work as always."
,ag_orange,2012-03-16T15:47Z,Tnx eztv...excellent quality as always!!
,payodie1969,2012-03-16T16:52Z,"""quit using your stupid video game console to play your shows and play them straight from your computer""
wow what a jerk, I have three xboxes that my family use to watch video on and AVI's just work. I am not bitching because eventually the avi is always uploded so I just have to wait a little longer but really who would choose to watch on a PC when they could use a TV (btw my one big screen tv does have a PC on it running Media Portal, it's just easier to download avi's for the xboxes)"
,payodie1969,2012-03-16T16:53Z,"Agent4747 at 2012-03-16 10:48 CET: 
Well Wikipedia says otherwise. This is technically E12. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Archer_episodes 

And of course wiki always correct, even more so than the official website of the show..."
,aapb,2012-03-16T22:17Z,fuck me someone could have made it easier to keep track of the releases 
,gdogfolife,2012-03-17T01:18Z,"I agree with payodie1969, I'd say a good majority use their video game consoles to play these files. We all like to use avi but hey if its going extinct then o well, use another uploader like ettv for theyre still using avi for the time being."
,davedowler,2012-03-17T09:00Z,"Hey if it's blocky as shit, try using The KMPlayer instead.  and ya mkv ruined my day"
,MolnTHM,2012-03-17T19:03Z,"A season on FX is 13 episodes unless the show is in it's first season, or they have to cut it short for some reason (pregnancy, illness).  According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Archer_episodes (which is referenced as coming from FX) there are 13 episodes in Season 3.  According to http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/archer/episode.php?season=3 (which IS FX)  Heart of Archness does not exist.  In summation...who the fuck cares?"
,Granchy,2012-03-17T22:38Z,"These episode numbers are a clusterfuck, but thank you EZTV for the upload."
,ekimarcher,2012-03-21T20:00Z,"this isn't the new one, it's just a repost of ep 8"
,ekimarcher,2012-03-21T20:01Z,"woops, ep9"
