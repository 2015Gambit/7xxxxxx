,FrostyWinnipeg,2012-03-17T18:32Z,"Magnets are similar to torrents. Your regular torrent program should open them. It might be your browser too. If Firefox, i have utorrent set to open magnet files."
,lotusmaglite,2012-03-18T01:44Z,"CapoMarco: Whereas before, you had to download the torrent file, then point your client at it, now the magnet link gets automatically opened by whatever client you designate. When you press ""get this torrent"", it should automatically fire up your client (Vuze, et al). Then it seeks out and downloads the torrent file (which PB no longer hosts) and begins the process as normal. "

,camabron,2012-03-19T14:55Z,CapoMarco you need a newer bittorrent client like uTorrent or Vuze in order to open magnet links.
