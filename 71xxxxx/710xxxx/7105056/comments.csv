AND Xvid is not a video format â&#x20AC;&#x201C; it is a program (codec) for compressing and decompressing to the MPEG-4 ASP format. Since Xvid uses MPEG-4 Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) compression, any video that is encoded with it is termed ""MPEG-4 ASP video"" â&#x20AC;&#x201C; not ""Xvid video."" Good day to you sir."
