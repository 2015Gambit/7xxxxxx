SUMO- HARU Basho -Day 05- 2012 March
Osaka - Day 05 2012

Languages : English and Japanese
Day 05 of the Haru Sumo Basho from the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium in Osaka, Japan.
Due to some recording difficulties I will not make a dual language *.avi for today (somehow the timing is out.)  so I will let you decide which files you want.
 The *.AVI recording was made from digital cable through S-cable, then reprocessed to 720x480 Xvid *.AVI from its original *.MPG format.  There are *.AVI for both English and Japanese.  It is not HD.
Files included;
-	Haru.2012.05E.avi  (english language)
-	Haru.2012.05N.avi  (Nihongo)
-	This description  (Haru.2012.05.docx)
-	Torrent downloaded from Dxxxxoid.me.txt
