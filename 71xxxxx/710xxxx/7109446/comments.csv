directed by Andrew Stanton
Taylor Kitsch, Lynn Collins and Thomas Haden Church

Former army captain John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is war-weary from fighting in the Civil War, and tries his luck
as a prospector. During a chase by Indians, he seeks protection in a cave. There is something strange place, because his body
is inexplicably transported to Mars, where he ends up in a war of epic proportions between the residents
of the planet, which they called Barsoom. That world, populated by the oddest of creatures, is on the verge of collapse.
Carter realizes that he alone can bring salvation, and that the fate of the planet's inhabitants into his hands alone.
His encounter with the stunning princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) is an incentive to work for the salvation of Barsoom.
