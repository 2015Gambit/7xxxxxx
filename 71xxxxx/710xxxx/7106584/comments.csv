,djalarm,2012-05-20T00:18Z,"@ Dropolus : If your so curious to know why I have the password on my fan page, that's because I want to keep my fans updated about all my latest release and news.

,SrMLove,2012-07-11T00:20Z,"@djalarm: i am a DJ and that's B/S.... your ""latest updates"" for ""your fans"" can be automatically and directly sent by facebook from facebook itself to ""your fans"" emails,text message, any smartphones w/ internet, and/or of course twitter. all of my gigs and latest music releases are all handled that way. you are forcing people to go to your facebook just to get a password to get a torrent to work appropriately, that's not ""your fans"" checkin in. that is you wasting people's time. i think its sad you are this desperate for friend requests so that you can look like you have more people that are interested in your music than they really are. you arent fooling anyone that matters... as far as the music world is concerned. and EVERYONE will figure that out after they end up at one of ""your shows"".(im not sure if that is an actual venue or some shitty house party...most likely the second one). and for the record..... your DJ name sucks. you should work on ^all ^ of that. but i see no hope so we shall see. good luck"
