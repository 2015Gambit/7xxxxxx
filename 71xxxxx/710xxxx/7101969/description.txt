Canadian Pickers Season 01 2011 - Complete (webrips) xvids avi

all are rips from a web stream except 1, however all I could get is 400kps not the higher quality 800kps.. so looks more like standard tv over HD tv
some pixelling with fast scene changes.

I got fed up trying to sauce the 3-4 hdtv ones on the web as no one was seeding them at all or very very slowly and couldnt find any other sources 
except a couple of 720p which I couldnt be blowed getting and converting
was easier to do the webrip

again its very watchable and the sound seems ok but you can also
use VLC EQ and cut of the high freqs and base it more in real time

take it or leave it but IF GRABBING THEN SEED!

webrip FLV 400KPS to Xvids 640x352 600kps Mp3 128bit audio

enjoy
