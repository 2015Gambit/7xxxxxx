,lglenwoodc,2012-03-15T18:46Z,"Given up. Found Spartacus S02E06.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE not too bad. 

Thanks to uploaders anyway. You do nice work."
,lglenwoodc,2012-03-16T00:04Z,What I have seeds at approximately 60 kbps to start but within minutes drops to approximately 500 bps. I`m unable to seed back what I download. A seedbox appears to be the solution. Could someone please recommend one that will seed up to 100 gigabytes and a beginner can operate.
,multi7,2012-03-16T00:51Z,e4&e5 1080i will be uped
,lglenwoodc,2012-03-23T00:25Z,Thank you for seeding. Pleasantly surprised and overwhelmingly grateful.
