Tokio Hotel — twin brothers, vocalist Bill and guitarist Tom Kaulitz; drummer Gustav Schäfer; and bassist Georg Listing — were already multiplatinum-selling superstars in their native Germany when they decided to take the rest of the world by storm, and this tribute is the ultimate guide to the band. Featuring stunning photos of the band—in performance, off stage, and as children—this biography details their early days, their musical and style influences, and their love for their devoted legions of fans. Tokio Hotel translated their two albums from German to English and found North Americans just as receptive to their alt-rock music, moving lyrics, and distinct visual style. This led to a nomination for the MTV Video Music Award for best pop video and a win for best new artist in 2008. From facts and style information on each of the band members to a discography and videography of their work, this guide to all things Tokio Hotel is essential for any die-hard fan and a great introduction for those new to their music.
