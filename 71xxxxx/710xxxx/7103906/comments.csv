... best."
,john_doe123,2012-03-15T18:31Z,"@ Makb1: its pretty easy, all u need is a good media player just like zx6rider already said.
try a player with built-in codecs like the following:
- potplayer (the kmplayer redux, my personal favourite, easy to use by default but with a tremendous amount of functions if needed) 
- kmplayer 
- media player classic - home cinema
- vlc player 
they are free, safe and can handle almost any file u throw at them."
