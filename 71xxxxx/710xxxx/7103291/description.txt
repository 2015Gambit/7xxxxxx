Left this in flv format to save on size as converting it did nothing but triple the file size lol.

This is not HQ but it is very watchable for those that can't wait to see this weeks episode.

I will do an HQ rip on Saturday when/if Lifetime puts the episode up and I can rip from my usual sources.
