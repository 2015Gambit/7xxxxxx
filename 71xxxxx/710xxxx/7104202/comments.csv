depends how picky you want to be about quality
i think people waiting for your 720p though

its kinda a boring show lately I think... funny how they always hear loads of stuff but never ends up in the summary"
[T],trialNerror,2012-03-15T20:20Z,"I'll say this yet AGAIN - syfy network dropped multicast so I can no longer get anything on that network as quick as I use to.  That, and the first recording had a very bad segment of audio which kicked it out of sync no matter what. Had to get the re-air of it for a better recording.

People will just have to wait. Shit, it's free and without commercials. They can wait."
[T],trialNerror,2012-03-15T20:32Z,"Oh and the 720p came out too large - about 1.8gb
Making another pass to try and bring that down to a more sharable size.
Will release it later after I get off work."
