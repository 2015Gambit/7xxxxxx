,Nimh,2012-03-15T05:34Z,Have to put this comment in to see the actual comments because comments don't appear till over 5minutes later - unless you comment. Stupid system 
,Granchy,2012-03-15T05:37Z,"80MB?  That seems a little small, no?"
,Granchy,2012-03-15T05:40Z,Wanted to also say I love the MP4 formats.  
,C_Tripp,2012-03-15T06:46Z,"Thanks man, you're always dependable"
,em25,2012-03-15T06:52Z,Excellent! Thank youuuuuu! :)
,Dagrio,2012-03-15T06:54Z,Finally one that actually works...
,tpboss,2012-03-15T06:56Z,"I, too, was apprehensive at the small size. But rest assured, video is quite nice. Not stunning, but most releases aren't anyways. Absolutely comparable to most 180mb that come out. It's just the mp4 is always smaller."
,halofubar,2012-03-15T07:45Z,"hope this works, have gotten two already that were either sped-up or the sound disappeared halfway through (seems this happens more often with these MP4 releases than with AVI's)"
,halofubar,2012-03-15T08:09Z,"it works, it works"

,thiagoadecastro,2012-03-15T12:39Z,"Nice, thank you!"
,CosmAvngr,2012-03-15T15:41Z,"Small size is due to better encoder (x264 instead of XVid).

I wish everyone was doing this."
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2012-03-15T16:10Z,"Thanks for the up EZTV! This copy is complete and in sync A10/V10. Love the X264 instead of Xvid, keep em' comin!!"
