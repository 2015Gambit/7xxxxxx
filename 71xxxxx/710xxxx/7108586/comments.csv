,kelmar78,2012-03-17T20:59Z,You can watch it on a big screen now too. Just connect the tv to your computer and voila...
,DIGIUPLOADS,2012-03-18T02:07Z,I think all the complainers have shitty tv's or they are just dumb and too lazy to connect their shit.
,kemenyadi,2012-03-18T04:21Z,"i cant believe people still burn discs to watch avi.. just buy a mediaplayer like WDTV and play from your flashdrive, if your tv and pc arent in the same room.. otherwise connect the tv as second monitor"

,ninjacaity,2012-04-21T05:59Z,"The problem with .mp4's is that most DVD players and TV's don't actually recognise them. To watch videos on a TV by plugging in a USB, the only surefire way is with .avi files. They're pretty much the only ones that I've found work on everyone's TV's.

So I'm wondering, what's with the recent switch away from .avi files? I'm having a lot of trouble finding good .avi files, not only from eztv, but from other users as well. It seems most people are switching to .mp4. 

Which is really bad for a lot of people, as we're then forced to watch shows on our tiny computers, or even convert them ourselves, which can take a couple of hours.

So anyway, yes, why the sudden switch to .mp4?"
