,MiffleZwip,2012-03-22T14:52Z,How can you even call this a dvd5. Just taking the cam rip and converting it to dvd so peeps will download it.... My question is WHAT FOR?? Brownie points? This is just a cam rip folks do not wast your time downloading this crap it goes in and out of focus and is very very bad quality. BOOO to the misleading dvd5 crap that wasted 5 hours downloading if you are in a 3d world country thats a dirty trick Karma to you!!!!
,MiffleZwip,2012-03-22T14:54Z,And by the way.... Pedro11's is just the same!
,MiffleZwip,2012-03-22T15:03Z,"How can you EVEN call this s***t a DVD5 it is only just a cam rip converted to DVD Format. My question is... WHY? Brownie points?

Totally wasted my time 5 hours downloading for a VERY low quality rip... it doesn't even stay in focus!
