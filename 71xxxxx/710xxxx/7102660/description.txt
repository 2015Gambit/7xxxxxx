A motorcycle expedition on uncharted roads across the Himalayan state of Arunachal Pradesh, situated in North-east India. But more than an expedition, it\'s a film on friendship, camaraderie and the \"never say die\" attitude of five motorcyclists in the face of unforgiving terrain. Shot in the same format as \"Riding Solo To The Top Of The World\" with no back-up vehicle or film crew, in parts of India hardly seen, filmed or explored, the documentary captures the interactions and experiences of the riders who are trying to chart a route, which according to everyone does not exist
