I can only say W-T-F. "
,vreyhr676y,2012-03-26T12:26Z,"Rip is when you take the source from a digital media  you moron, not from an cam, because the cam might be digital but the source is analog (the cinema room screen), and hard coded Korean subs? are you stupid or what? no subs for the Russian parts... great dumbass... if you're going to release crap say so in the title/description, or better yet don't and get a DVD/BR Disc and rip from IT"
,pezed,2012-04-15T08:06Z,"I'm surprised, I downloaded it with out even reading the description because froggie has a lot of good quality movies, but this is not one of them, something went wrong with this one. Looks like a came with hard coded Korean subs and stereo? Thank you for the effort and all your other great stuff.
A good one to get at about the same file size by Bone is
