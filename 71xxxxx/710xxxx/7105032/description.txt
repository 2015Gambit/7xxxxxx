Sarra Manning - Nine Uses For An Ex-Boyfriend,Epub, Mobi, KK


Hope Delafield hasnΓÇÖt always had an easy life.
  
She has red hair and a temper to match, as her mother is constantly reminding her. She canΓÇÖt wear heels, is terrified of heights and being a primary school teacher isnΓÇÖt exactly the job she dreamed of doing, especially when her class are stuck on the two times table.
 
At least Hope has Jack, and Jack is the God of boyfriends. HeΓÇÖs sweet, kind, funny, has a killer smile, a cool job on a fashion magazine and heΓÇÖs pretty (but in a manly way). Hope knew that Jack was The One ever since their first kiss after the Youth Club Disco and thirteen years later, theyΓÇÖre still totally in love. Totally. And then Hope catches Jack kissing her best friend Susie ΓÇª
 
Does true love forgive and forget?

 Or does it get mad ΓÇª and get even?


Enjoy!
