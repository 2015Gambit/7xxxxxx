,Altium818,2012-03-28T16:10Z,"This version DOES NOT work. I spent one full day trying to get it to work without luck on a few different PCs. First during installation you have to change privileges on Preffolders.ini or it will fail to complete installation, and once installed I did exactly as indicated but once I start Altium it opens,  a windows flickers a few times with a progress bar and then it closes down, leaving the splash screen stucked. I don't even have the time to set the license file. Then DXP process has to be killed. "
,overl0ad3r,2012-07-05T00:34Z,"DON'T DOWNLOAD. IT'S CORRUPTED. Same problem here. Have to change PrefFolders.ini privileges (remove ReadOnly) very fast, after installation begins and before it ends. When try to run it, a window saying (Information: Please wait a moment...) flicks some times and program freezes. "
