,RecycleBin32,2012-03-19T11:20Z,"Danny, I'm back. I'm sorry to bother you again but I seriously could not rip like you. I was able to do something but failed. 
I really need to learn. Please mention some sites or something where I can learn this. And if possible, somehow arrange a tutorial. it would be amazing. :)"

try to use google, type for instance ""xvid encoding avs script"" or so.
Try to encode something using the software chain I've recommended, and at each step do answer yourself: what do I want, what is my goal, what result will I obtain by using this or that."
,RecycleBin32,2012-03-23T17:43Z,I have zero knowledge about languages and video editing stuff. :/ Problem.

I believe you could find needed infos in any language. What country are you from? What's your mother tongue?"
,RecycleBin32,2012-03-24T06:38Z,"I am from India.
Hindi is my mother tongue but I'm not that bad at speaking english.
Well, I tried a lot and I've reached somewhere. I've opened Virtualdub and the avs script using it. I am configuring Xvid which is confusing me."

I'll try to post some infos about XviD options or some links tomorrow. Sorry, I'm too busy today. Obviously it's not that difficult, but configuring the encoder requires some experience."
,RecycleBin32,2012-03-25T12:31Z,"Thanks a ton man. You rock. :)
Would be so cool if I have a friend like you :)"

Hi man, do you have some email address? Would be handy if you do."
,RecycleBin32,2012-03-27T12:39Z,"Sure man,

,RecycleBin32,2012-03-28T18:21Z,"Answer another question please. 
Danny, When I create a .d2v file, I get a separate .ac3 audio file. When I create a script and open it through vdub and save it, i don't get any audio in my .avi video. What should I do?   "

I answered you by email, you probably got no message."
