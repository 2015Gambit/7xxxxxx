Another album in a limited edition, released in 1994. Which is why I
guess it might be ok for them that I'm sharing it.
                                   
Atonal, electronic, dark ambient, industrial music. If you're familiar
with the novel by Hans Henny Jahnn, you already know the kind of
blackness that's expecting you.
