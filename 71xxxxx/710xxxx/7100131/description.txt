Sir Kenneth MacMillan's glorious version of "The Prince Of The Pagodas" provides a fascinating and magnificent spectacle of classical dance on the grandest scale. Benjamin Britten's exotic score, inspired by the sounds of the Gamelan, is the only one that he created for ballet. This production by The Royal Ballet, filmed at Covent Garden in 1990, stars Darcey Bussell in dazzling form as Princess Rose and Jonathan Cope as the Prince.
