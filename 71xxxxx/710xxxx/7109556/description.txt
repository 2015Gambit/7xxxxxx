  Sachin is an engineering graduate from      
  a middle class Mumbai family, but his       
  passion is for the world of cinema. He      
  is dreaming and planning for a future       
  as a director, when he sees Jessie. It      
  is love at first sight for Sachin.          
  However, Jessie is from a strict            
  Malayali Christian family, and her          
  parents would never approve of their        
  romance. The other problem is Jessie        
  insists that she doesn't want a romantic    
  relationship, but wants only to be          
  friends. Of all the girls in the world      
  why did Sachin have to fall for Jessie?
