,sykoskit,2012-03-20T05:59Z,"ez i have followed you for years and gotten almost all the shows i watch from your site or your torrents on here but now that you've changed your format to mp4 i have had to start looking elsewhere... why the change? why change something that's not broken? it was perfect before... i mean i appreciate everything you do for us, and i love your work, but... why? i just don't understand... can you please go back to using .avi? i would appreciate it... i would love to stay loyal and continue getting everything from you but if you keep posting everything as x264 .mp4 then i just won't be able to :("
,pkisme,2012-03-21T09:22Z,"@sykoskit - mp4 lets u achieve better bitrate in smaller size.

if its codec prob just dl K-Lite codec pack."
,sykoskit,2012-03-21T09:57Z,my main issue at the moment is that i am able to watch .avi files though my xbox on my TV straight from my computer without burning it onto a disc or using a flash drive or anything my xbox just connects to my pc through my network and plays the .avi files perfectly on my TV... but for some reason it's not reading the new .mp4s.. so i've been having to find other .avi files to download which kinda sucks because some have horrible seeding issues or just aren't as good quality as i've enjoyed for the past few years with ez's torrents :
