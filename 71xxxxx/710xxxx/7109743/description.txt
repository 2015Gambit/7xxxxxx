Comment: The Instructor's solution manual (ISM) for the long version (Mech. of Materials, 7th ed.) by the same authors will probably be of some help for this abridged version. Look for it on The Pirate Bay.

NOTA: The PDF file is archived (packed for transport) in 7-Zip format to reduce data transfer and download time by ~15% with no loss of quality. The 7-Zip "unpacker" to restore the file to its original PDF format (and size) after download is available at  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html (Win & Mac; freeware).
