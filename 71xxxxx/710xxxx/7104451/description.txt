Type: Anime-TV series


All episodes mkv format.
because they are mkv format it is likely you need to install a codec (I recommend media player classic), and then enabling subtitles in your media player may also be required

video-Width:1280
video-Height:720




Feel free to request (anyfucking) anime. I'll try to find it and compile it.
