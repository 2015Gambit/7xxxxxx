,Lee1237,2012-03-15T01:31Z,Thanks heaps for the AVI files can you please tell me why all of a sudden it almost impossible to get them everyone seems to be uploading in other formats. Great Work
,adamsMR,2012-03-15T06:15Z,"Hi Lee1237,
Smaller file sizes & better quality for Windows users from what I understand, but not so good for us Mac users."
,Lee1237,2012-03-15T06:38Z,Thanks adamMR I thought that might be what it was but what about those that want to burn it to a DVD and what it on TV and cant use the other formats.

,MnrBurger,2012-03-16T05:41Z,"Thanks for the avi :-D.  

Many DVD players cannot playback the mp4 and mkv files either.  Watching TV series on the PC is not option at my house.  That's just geeky..."
,adamsMR,2012-03-16T12:47Z,We don't have cable or satellite so I download the shows we like. We watch them on our TV hooked up to the computer. The picture & sound quality is very good.
,haze82,2012-03-18T18:23Z,Are you Mac users stupid?? x264 on mac only if converted?? Check this brand new (LOL) software for pc and mac...www.videolan.org

VLC is the only player I have ever used & I have tried all the codecs, versions etc. It has to do with my system (2003 PowerPC G4). 
One of these years I will have to upgrade. Until then... thanks for the AVIs."
