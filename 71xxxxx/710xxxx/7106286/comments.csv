http://hdvnbits.org/dynasty_warrior_7_jap_t47507.html"
,TheGenral,2012-03-16T07:05Z,"If anything the description is what really matters, as most people wont get how to work it considering its ALL in Fucking JAPANESE!!"
,TheGenral,2012-03-16T07:07Z,"Ill seed this for as long as i can, but definitely go to that link if things dont work out ppl.
Register the site yes, but youll get the torrent immeadiately and its free."
,TheGenral,2012-03-16T07:09Z,"Sorry for so many comments, but it works on my end, update the trackers a bit though."
,TheGenral,2012-03-16T07:32Z,"SEED BLAST IT!!!
I can seed for 2-3 days, which was how long the original took me to get, but after that............"
,TheGenral,2012-03-16T07:53Z,"DAMNIT ALL, I""M GONNA CALL THIS A FAILURE!!
USE THAT LINK I PUT< GET THAT TORRENT!! But this desciption is well worth it."
,kamotekamote,2012-03-16T07:55Z,"I'm downloading the 5GB version in their site. I don't worry about japanese thing, i used to play sangokushi. :))"
,premiado,2012-03-16T07:55Z,"I am playing a localized chinese version by 3dm, released 6 days ago. also if your using a xbox360 pad, i recommend you to use xpadder, else by default, you are not able to turn the camera on the right stick."
,premiado,2012-03-16T07:58Z,"also this is not call dynasty warrior 7

it is call ""Shin Sangokumusou 6 with Moushouden"""

i Did download this, the setup is english so it might be okay."
,premiado,2012-03-16T08:50Z,"If you wanna know how the game plays, search for ""acewincash"" on youtube, there is a video on it."
,TheGenral,2012-03-16T17:02Z,"Yep, this is a fail, but it is indeed that SSGKM6
japanese version basically, and the only PC DW7 will ever get. Would someone upload the other one thats like 5 gigs, that would be nice, and copy my descibition while ur at it."
,kamotekamote,2012-03-17T09:22Z,"I play the 5 gig version, it is good. "
,sr2005,2012-03-23T18:18Z,Is the game menu is in english?
,TheGenral,2012-03-25T06:51Z,No.
