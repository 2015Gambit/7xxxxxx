1. the release groups are the ones who decide the codec
2. get a new player, VLC works just fine

videolan.org"

vlc plays anything, even quicktime files and .flv files.

except for real media files.

also try to get a hold of windows media player classic. it gets second place."
,TheProFTW,2012-03-15T22:49Z,"Changing to x264 was a bad idea. My TV doesn't play it, there's prolly not going to be support for it ever, no dvd players play that format.

It's a bad idea!"
