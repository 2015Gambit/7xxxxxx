Details:

Scripted is the debut album by American rock band Icon for Hire. It was released on Tooth & Nail Records on August 23, 2011, and has gone on to break the label's new artist record for albums sold during the first week of release. This is the band's first label release; they had released two EPs prior to being signed, Icon for Hire EP (2008) and The Grey EP (2009). Three songs from those recordings reappear here with altered arrangements and lyrics: "Off With Her Head", "The Grey", and "Only A Memory" (originally called "Pernilla"). This is also the band's first recording without original bassist Joshua Davis; Josh Kincheloe would be brought in to replace him in 2011.
