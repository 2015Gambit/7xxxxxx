,saadatkhan,2012-03-14T08:15Z,"A?
V? please"
,carbonize,2012-03-14T13:06Z,Given how blurry the screenshots are I think I'll pass. Looks more like a cam in the screenshots.
,eatglass,2012-03-14T14:47Z,"Blurry? Please, don't think. In fact shut your brain down and never use it again. 

It's clearly not a cam. 

1. the pictures won't be clear because it's a still (screenshot) from a moving image. 
2. rolling shutter
3. depth of field
4. go away"
,silentinquiry,2012-03-14T15:51Z,MKV format with oriental sub titles. good quality overall. a/10 v/9
,freddy213809,2012-03-14T15:59Z,"Definitely a Cam or some other poor quality source. Colours are all washed out as well.

@eatglass: Those reasons are invalid. There are thousands of movies on here with clear screenshots."
,eatglass,2012-03-14T16:54Z,It's not blurry. The copy is poor quality but it's not blurry.
,eatglass,2012-03-14T18:36Z,"I say poor. It's only poor compared to today's high def revolution. It's a standard vhs-rip (old days of pirating). Upscaled on my TV it looks better than on the computer. 

Muchas gracias. "
,gratefulforthis,2012-03-15T00:32Z,"Cheers for the upload.

It's very poor quality and a total waste of 2 Gig! Could fit better in 500Mb.

But still, good work on getting hold of it :D"
,dr.ozono,2012-03-15T00:38Z,I watched it. VHS noised! Like a TS VHS...
,dr.ozono,2012-03-15T00:42Z,KOREAN hardcoded subtitles.
,dr.ozono,2012-03-15T00:43Z,"Your mission, if you chose to accept it is to learn Korean, reduce your ratio and watch on an iPod size screen!! Thanks but more like TS.
