,unnim2,2012-03-16T10:39Z,thanks Mr.D
,Xpatriated,2012-03-17T05:49Z,"It is going to continue.  If you pay attention to the author's statement at the end of the book (and the last page), it teases ""The Legend of Luther Strode,"" although it doesn't say if that will be a second mini or a continuing.  But in either case, nothing until October if they stick to the schedule."
