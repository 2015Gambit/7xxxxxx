Cosmic Osmo was an old, out of this worls exploration game produced by Cyan and released for the Macintosh in 1989. On the cd, there were 19 tracks, one for the game data, and the rest for its jazzy/blues soundtrack. This torrent contains just the music from the original Macintosh CD, for those who want to go back in time and enjoy the memories.
