,Dimmis80,2012-03-14T15:02Z,Hey great friend Nepotu.I can see that in the list of todays games are both Miami and Lakers witch that i told u before and i will remind u i am great fun.So very cool dude very cool indeed..:-)I hope u and your friends continue this awesome job untill playofs and above in the summer..U know with friently older retro games and stuff.I wonder if is it possible to find an old game with one of the great Legents that if i remember corectly has the most score in a game 100 points Wilt Chamberlein if i am correct mate.??I could love to watch this spectacle but i don't even know if they tape the games for TV and stuff back then.???Cheers.

,Dimmis80,2012-03-14T17:00Z,Ok mate but if u ever find it i would apreciate the upload.And i have an another request if u have already upload it or u will concider it for the future or for the summer for the brake a game or games with Bulls-Jordan vs Detroit Pistons Grand Hill when he to was young and plays some great games in his youth.A great player Hill was and ofcourse Michael Jordan the best player of all time..??
[V],Nepotu,2012-03-14T20:19Z,I uploaded some Detroit-Chicago games. If you search for example NBA.1989 you will find all the games uploaded from this year.
,Dimmis80,2012-03-15T04:39Z,Good morning dude.I found your torrents for Nba 1989 Detroit-Chicago games but the Detroit team is before the arival of Grand Hill witch i have a lot of interest to see.So no Grand Hill in the rosters.I looked in other torrents and i did not find any Hill-Detroit games.Correction i found one but without any seeders and its dead.So any change do u have to an another place any Hill-Detroit vs Chicago Jordan game or games.Or do u remember at least in witch team Hill plaeyd after Pistons so i could manage to find him in another team.???
,Dimmis80,2012-03-15T05:14Z,Update.I found that after Detroit he played for Orlando from 2000-2007 but the torrents that i found are dead to.So can u find at least for Orlando-Hill games.??
[V],Nepotu,2012-03-15T13:18Z,"I'll try, but almost entire collection of NBA was gone by mega upld foreclosure. So, you have to wait. And I don't know. Sorry, mate!"
