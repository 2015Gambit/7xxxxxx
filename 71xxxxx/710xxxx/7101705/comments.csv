I bought the deluxe from itunes and converted them to mp3 http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7097926/Miike_Snow_-_Happy_to_You_(Deluxe_Version)_[Album]_(2012)

[T],FatFreddy473,2012-03-15T14:26Z,"stumpie, why dont u start putting up the m4a files instead? then i might believe that u buy them"
[T],stumpie1971,2012-03-15T17:54Z,"Because Nobody Wants to download m4a files they want 320kbps ? i dont have to prove anythink to anybody, if people dont believe me then thats there problem but they will always still download my torrents....."
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-03-15T18:08Z,"dude, the things u upload arent 320 kbps, they're just converted to it, so the quality is still shit"
