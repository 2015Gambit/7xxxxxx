Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, March 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with investigative journalist and author Greg Palast, described as a "cross between Sam Spade and Sherlock Holmes." Palast is a recipient of the George Orwell Courage in Journalism Prize for his BBC television documentary, Bush Family Fortunes. He is the author of several books, including The Best Democracy Money Can Buy and Armed Madhouse. 

Alex also talks with journalist Jon Rappoport, who has worked as a freelance investigative reporter for over 30 years. Jon has hosted, produced, and written radio programs and segments in Los Angeles and Las Vegas at KPFK and KLAV. He has appeared as a guest on over 200 radio and television programs, including ABC's Nightline, Tony Brown's Journal, and Hard Copy. He has lectured extensively across the US on the question: Who runs the world and what can we do about it?

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
