,ManinBlue,2012-03-17T04:19Z,"burn to cd, boot from cd.

i recommend imgburn: http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download

after your pc boots from cd, press option #1- start windows 98 setup from cd.

as for drivers... after install, u should be able to update from within OS."

,ManinBlue,2012-03-17T20:42Z,"i agree george2473... virtual machine is best use for win98 nowadays...

as for your problem naveen056... i havnt used it on a ""real"" pc in yrs... u should try it on a virtual machine through either windows xp (vmware) or windows 7 (virtual pc). not sure what ur setup is, hope this helps."
,ManinBlue,2012-03-17T20:58Z,"just as a general rule... to my knowledge, when installing an operating system... whether it is windows 98... or windows 7.. once u create a partition on your hard drive... u need to format it before u can do anything with it... after creation, the hard drive is still in what is called ""RAW"" format. 
u must format it to either ntfs or fat."
