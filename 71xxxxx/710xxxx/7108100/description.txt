The Stereoscopic Player application was designed to be a versatile 3D movie player. It allows you to play stereo┬¡scopic videos and DVDs (external decoder required) and also allows you to watch live video from a capture device. Since it is based on Direct┬¡Show, it can handle almost any media format, for example AVI, MPEG, WMV and ASF. Videos can be coded in several different stereo┬¡scopic formats. Why is it necessary to use a special software for 3D movie playback? The reason is that there are a lots of different ways to watch stereoscopic content as well as different ways to store the content.
