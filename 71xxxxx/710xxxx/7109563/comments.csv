,tigerneko,2012-03-17T16:06Z,"hmmm? you can just look on the serverlist... just go to option and make sure that the serverlist is enabled, there are all the servers to paly on there."
,RMJ113,2012-03-18T02:08Z,"I highly suggest, just Get ""tunngle"" log in go to the Mw3  room , then just click the ""?"" mark on the top right of the page .

 get all the real INFO there

this guy is just trying to help, but he is missing so much INFO!"
,RMJ113,2012-03-18T02:12Z,"tigerneko , you were correct about some Info ,

but your not giving all!

I only played COOP this is why I said you have to use IP!

I suggest you create a HELP ""NFO"" allso
