,StagMan196,2012-03-14T22:36Z,Well done George Barnett !!  A Real Musician and a Real Good Bloke. I've known loads of Real musicians who have played for the love of playing and maybe get a few pints and a couple of quid at the end of a sesh but you are going to get a lot more because of your generosity and doing what the fuck you like. You're gonna get Kudos m8 and loads of it. A  B I G  Thnx to you and to TPB.

,simolino,2012-03-14T23:02Z,"Really good job, corporate music sucks, it's just a load of crap. Corporate music is just listen and throw away. Music should be folk just like in the old days, it was passed from generation to generation and it was the center of your family and friends, and everyone rejoiced and enjoyed it. And your grandparent and parents sang it for generations."
,lkjdf,2012-03-14T23:05Z,Awesome idea George-y. Thanks a ton!

,[Z],2012-03-14T23:53Z,"Wow This guy is really good. Really upbeat stuff. To be honest this is how I do all my music. I listen to it for free. If I find I enjoy it after about 1 month still, I will support the artist to what I see as equal to the amount of their music I enjoy. I never understood why you would pay for anything without knowing about it first. Thats why I generally don't go to the movies. I have had more wasted money on movies than I care to admit."
,zero2426,2012-03-15T00:07Z,I'd never heard of this guy before tonight. I've already just listened to his discography and am loving it. Way to go dude!

,MeattiusRex,2012-03-15T00:24Z,"Hey man, I really like what your doing. Its a complete reverse approach to marketing oneself...torrents are becoming huge in our society and it seems info passes underground faster through them. This will make you money, dude...keep it up"
,desiemmett,2012-03-15T00:26Z,"Congratulations on a well-executed publicity stunt.
This music is really excellent.
But who the fuck mastered this?!! I demand that he be shot at once!! 
I would gladly pay for a version that wasn't maximized beyond all reason. Seriously, what the fuck were they trying to do? This is too fucking LOUD- and those wonderful dynamics in your compositions have been destroyed. Pray tell me that there is a sensible master somewhere for purchase- I love this stuff."
,wobblyprop,2012-03-15T00:38Z,"Thank you young man! breath of fresh air, as a teenager in the early 1960's I have had to duplicate buying same albums in vinyl/8 track/cassette & CD, no way am I buying them again for my iPod, 4 times is plenty!

,KKKDownlow,2012-03-15T02:23Z,This nobody artist pretending that he doesn't care about money and uploading his unsuccessful album onto this torrent site must be just looking to try and win over some fans and hopefully actually get a career.

Keep with the good job bro."
,antinames,2012-03-15T08:45Z,"What is the bit rate/stats on this puppy? Listened to the songs off his website, and was pleasantly surprised. A genuine talent, and without going over the top, this is a really good album, with a Uni/College rock sound: I can guess the influences. I like that sound. Some of the instruments are too loud, which detracts from the experience, but that's a technical detail which can be fixed. In short, I need to adopt this kid because (A) he's going to blow up and be my meal ticket, and (B) to keep him safe because everyone's going to want a piece of him. I would love to see him in concert!"
,emerging_tub,2012-03-15T08:49Z,"@ KKKDownlow first off what the fuck have YOU done with your life besides talk shit about people with ACTUAL TALENT being repressed by a system concerned only with money, regardless of how shitty the music is that they're spoon feeing us. He may be a ""nobody artist"" now, but how do you think every famous band under the sun started you stupid prick. Why don't you go listen to your precious hip hap and wub step bullshit, and LEAVE MY INTERNET.

On a more positive note, love the tunes George. Keep up the good work, I'd love to see you live someday!"

,Terratari,2012-03-15T15:18Z,"Bad Album from a very talented Musician (6,5 / 10) !!
Why Bad? Well, it´s has steril boring beats in the background.
If you get some real Musicians together and play this stuff with a real band you will get an real enjoyable Album.
""Lone Rose"", ""Cassi"" and ""The Other Girl"" really have hit potential. ""Light A Fire"" has potential but needs some work. 

Every human being has stupid and genius aspects.
To get rid of the stupid aspects you need companions to weed out the stupid aspects and your genius will shine.

GET A LIVE BAND AND GET REAL - YOU WILL BE VERY SUCCESFULL !!!!

ps. Adeles album 19 sucks too - with 21 she got it right!

,Spurge42,2012-03-16T04:14Z,Just donated some cash to this guy. He deserves it. A true artist and I love his attitude :) Great job George.
,gayavenger,2012-03-16T06:15Z,"George & his brother Jack were in the UK band These New Puritans.  This is George's 1st solo album and it has diverse influences from classical-style piano to Average White Band funky horns to Sean Lennon (mid-2000's) and Elliot Smith (RIP).  Even though the listed influences of These New Puritans are The Fall/PiL and other punk and post-punk bands.

It is great rock/pop and George is obviously a (former) child prodigy ala Ben Lee (Noise Addict).

This is a great debut LP George with songs showing a mature outlook on life; which I can only assume will get better as you hit your 20's.

There are some really talented musos who have yet to hit the mainstream (my nephew is a future guitar god and the same age as you George); but when they do - well, it will be goodbye to generic rap and hello to 21st century rock/pop.

BTW If you want George's kind of loud voice message at 00 in the file listing not to appear on your burned CD copy - just take the tick off the file.

FYI: I've been listening to many musical styles going back to the 1920's through to today (which is a bit sparse apart from Interpol).

There is always some good throughout each decade of recorded music history.  I like both Paul Robeson and AC/DC (amongst several thousand other great artists who put all they have into their recordings).

Thanks again George for an impressive debut album.  I hope to see an even better and more soul-revealing 2nd effort.

Cheers mate + thks for the free."
