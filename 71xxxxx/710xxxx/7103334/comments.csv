,Speedpwns,2012-04-21T04:47Z,"Torrent is broken. The beginning of each track is missing. Meaning, for people who don't know what VLC Media player is, you cannot listen to it. Other wise, its okay, the tracks still start well before the drop."
,adiugla1,2012-06-12T04:32Z,I don't know what the bozo's before me were talking about.  This album plays perfectly fine.  (I use Winamp and K-Lite Mega Codec Pack for the record)
,jawb0ne,2012-06-22T22:55Z,the torrent is corrupted
,Odinoss,2012-08-23T01:40Z,indeed the files seems to be corrupted when playing then with windows media player. i recommend anyone to use VLC mediaplayer or find some else mediaplayer that works. i can also confirm that an ipod or any other mp3 player will play this fine.
