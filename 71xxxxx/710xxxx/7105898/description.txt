The present-day murders in Mystic Falls remind
Damon of a similar crime spree a century earlier

exist. Sheriff Forbes warns Damon not to get
involved in her investigation, but Damon is
convinced she's going after the wrong suspect
Elena and Matt resort to breaking and entering in
their search for evidence to prove Dr. Fell is a
murderer. For reasons known only to her, Rebekah
becomes interested in locating one of the town's
oldest landmarks. Finally, Elena comes to a new
understanding of the path her life has taken
and Damon makes an emotional confession to
Stefan
