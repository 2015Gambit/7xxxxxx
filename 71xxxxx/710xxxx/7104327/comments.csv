,godziothc,2012-03-17T02:58Z,"can you tell me why the hell cant i download any torrents from you spastik? the magnets just reset over and over again, got this issue with the new fam guy/ame dad/cle show and the southpark as well. Would love to know what the deal is since you're the only person with decent copies for the new eps apparently"
