,Hawkhell,2012-04-07T00:07Z,The series does not end at episode 77. 
,agentrogue,2012-04-20T16:24Z,"No, this is not complete, it is missing episodes 78-99, which had not yet had an uncut english dvd release yet."
,agentrogue,2012-04-20T16:28Z,"Also, since I didn't see this info up there, this is the Funimation English dub, however the first 35 or so episodes also have hard-coded english subtitles.
The video and audio is of very good quality."
,mkfanatic,2012-05-05T19:59Z,Seriously bro? Where's episode 71?

,BlackThaRipper,2012-06-25T07:07Z,You really shouldn't share torrents and give out incorrect information. There are quite a few more episodes than 77. 
,Celik7,2012-08-22T19:16Z,Subtitles sucks!!! can it be deleted from videos?
