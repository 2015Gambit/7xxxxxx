Just making sure. Thanks :)"

,superlol1,2012-05-12T00:40Z,THERE ARE NO FRICKIN SUBTITLES. 
,mikkel94,2012-05-22T23:16Z,"@superlol1

First of all... It's hard to find subtitles for this series.

Just be grateful it's here for you to DL at all...


@Khemist: Thanks a bunch :D"
,lidstenth,2012-05-23T16:43Z,im using western dig tv live box and cant view the subs
,ffsihateu,2012-05-30T19:26Z,"Subtitles are actually included, but your player may not support the format (.sup). The solution is to extract the subtitle stream using mkvextract, covert it to a different format that your player does support, such as .srt, and then repack using mkvmerge. I personally converted the .sup file to .srt using BDSupToSub."

If subs don't work, just google breaking bad season 3 subtitles...worked for me."
