[V],polisdavid,2012-03-16T13:07Z,"I saw so many people stuck at 94.7% I decided to repost the torrent above

SO hang in there you'll have to download the whole thing again, but I will continue seeding until there are no seeders left....

,nochwpfj9,2012-04-06T23:36Z,"Hey Polisdavid,

Thanks for the sick torrent! One question though, I've run the scan, it's found the documents I lost, but it keeps asking me to register the product and when I enter the serial no that came with the torrent, it doesn't work :(

Any suggestions as to what to do? My files are so near yet so far!! 

Cheers dude"
