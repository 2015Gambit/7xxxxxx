Jaguar Shark are…

One piece Kilian Raiser, one piece Shaun Lawes, one piece Benito Pflüger, one piece Filippo Cimatti, To create the incredibly morbid confectionar that is Jaguar Shark take a heap of battered shoe-gaze guitars and post-punk vibes, mixed with a disco love for ghost house and electronica. 
We are the musical embodiment of 2 decades spent in an ever-shrinking world, staring at distant horizons wanting change and above all NOISE! An experience that was narrated by Sonic Youth, Jesus and the Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Joy Division, etc.

Having come together from the far reaches of the European continent they spent 3 months writing and recording their self-produced EP. 

Now they are beginning to emerge from the confines of their kitchen to bring to you a piece of the cake.
