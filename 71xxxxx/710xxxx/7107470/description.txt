                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The stylist travels to China, where he finds out how the country is able to 
 produce goods in the vast quantities the West has come to rely on. He visits 
 towns dedicated to manufacturing, including a community that creates millions 
 of pairs of jeans every year. Gok makes his inaugural visit to the village his 
 father grew up in, tours a factory that builds London taxis and explores Thames 
 Town, a replica of an English neighbourhood complete with Georgian terraces and 
 a village green.
