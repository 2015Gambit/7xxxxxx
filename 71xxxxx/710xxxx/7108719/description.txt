The Sheriff's Daughter
Hub City Records
┬⌐2005

I found a whole stack of this CD, all new and sealed, in a FREE box on the
sidewalk a few months back. I had never heard of them, and when I gave the music
a listen I was amazed at how this talented band slipped through the cracks and
never became a national hit. They even let their web domain expire. What a
shame. Great work, guys, wherever you are.

I'm sharing The Sheriff's Daughter in three torrents. The FLAC and MP3 versions
are all cut into the listed tracks, but the Wave is one long file for those who
want to burn it straight to CD. I recommend the wave since the music flows
together and the small gaps between tracks are a distraction, to me anyway. All
three versions are accompanied by scans at 300 DPI.

Track list:

01 - Hey Hey
02 - Holiday
03 - Big Enough
04 - Charleston
05 - Music From Hell
06 - Medication
07 - The Battle Of Me
08 - This Cathedral
09 - Run
10 - Want It

Trust me, odds are you'll like this one.
