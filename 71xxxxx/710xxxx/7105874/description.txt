"The Letting Go"

Sheldon warns Sam that he may be in over his 
head when he insists on releasing Corinne from 
the hospital and caring for her at home; a badly 
beaten Scott arrives at the ER and is placed 
under the care of Pete; Amelia is encouraged to 
make a decision about her unborn child; and 
Jake's daughter grills him on his love life when 
he visits her at college. Meanwhile, Erica's 
health takes a turn for the worse. 

18/Slower
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy  :)
