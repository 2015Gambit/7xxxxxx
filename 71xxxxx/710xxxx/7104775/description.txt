This is the .dol for New Super Mario Bros Wii game. I hope it helps you!
All you have to do is copy this to your SD card (for your wii) and depending on what you use, see how it works out. I use Neogamma so I would place it in the Neogamma folder on my SD card (Not the one under apps).
To make it work, allow searching for patches and alternative .dol's on your loader.
