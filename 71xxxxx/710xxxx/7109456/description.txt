No need for me to write a  review of this album, only say that It is a masterpiece ,  one of my  favorite albums  and a disc  which  must have for those who like to "think" when they listen to rock, it is another journey through the mind of Waters on a great remastered version .

Anyway , I will play the CD version at  friends meetings , but surely  I will listen to the vinyl version when i┬┤m alone...
