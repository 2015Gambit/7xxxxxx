,OmniNegro,2012-03-17T07:05Z,"Since the Xpadder program decided to become doucebags and require you to buy it to use it, this is all but worthless. It would cost less to buy a Wireless Xbox 360 controller with a receiver for Windows than to buy their shitty software.


So why post this? Is that the full version of the software in the torrent? Or are you spamming the trial ware garbage?

Sorry if this sounds aggressive. I hope you are legitimate, but this is your first torrent. I have to suspect either malware or trialware. (Not that there is a difference.)"
,OmniNegro,2012-03-17T07:09Z,"I am thinking this is malware. It is 1.63 MB for the Xpadder 5.7 included, yet a clean version of the same here on TPB is ~560KB. (Rared verses yours being an executable.)

It could be legitimate, but I am loath to find out. Thank you but no thank you."

Mouse & Keyb forever!"
,jlocust,2012-03-18T16:38Z,"OmniNegro, I do understand your concern being this is my first torrent on pirate bay and is somewhat a small file... I have put the installer for xpadder 5.7 in the torrent, it is not a trail or malware or anything tho I did have the installer before xpadder became a paid app... I have downloaded the local extension for xpadder so you can run it locally with no internet connection needed... If u want I can dig it up... the profile works awesome for mass effect 3 with a wired x-box or ps3 controller (just see the extra step for ps3 controllers in the instructions) ... 114 people completed this on demonoid with no fuss... I have no affiliation to xpadder, just figured id included for those who don't have... skip the xpadder file if u want and just grab the profiles i made them personally... ;) take it or leave it, it works ;) "
,jlocust,2012-03-18T16:42Z,"and also OmniNegro in response to your file size... THIS TORRENT IS NOT JUST THE XPADDER PROGRAM, THE TORRENTS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE THE PROFILES AND BUTTON MAPPINGS SPECIFIC FOR MASS EFFECT 3,... THE PROFILES, MAPPINGS, XPADDER, INSTRUCTION TXT FILE IS INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT... I ONLY INCLUDED XPADDER TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR NOOBS TO USE MY PROFILE... ;) "

The purpose of xpadder is to map the buttons on your existing wired or wireless Xbox 360 controller to PC games that don't support the controller natively... again I appreciate your concern, id probably be cautious in your position too being this is my first torrent and small file... I just saw a lot of people asking for this because Mass Effect 3 doesn't support the xbox controller natively I don't believe, and this has my button assignments laid out already for the game... It works great and incorporates all the functions in game from your controller... just load xpadder (already unzipped the original installer is a stand-alone app.) and load up the included profile and xbox controller mapping and it plays like console.      "
,nerosyrus,2012-03-19T16:06Z,"ok i will say this,

,ap_1821,2012-03-30T16:31Z,"thnx, works great!  

Could you by any chance upload the xpadder profiles for ME1 and ME2 for xbox 360 controllers?   It would be greatly appreciated.  I can't find them anywhere and I tried doing it myself but it turned out like crap."
,SnivellingLittleShit,2012-04-14T22:01Z,"Hi jlocust
First off id just like to thankyou for uploading this, its exactly what ive been looking for.. so thankyou for that!! :)

Just one thing id like your help with if you dont mind... ive set everything up as instructed, but the right analogue stick doesnt move the mouse cursor, or show any signs of working at all, whilst all the other buttons do...

Any idea how i can remedy this?"
,SnivellingLittleShit,2012-04-14T22:58Z,"Its ok, had to reinstall motionjoy and it works now... discard my previous comment...
Thanks for the up!"
