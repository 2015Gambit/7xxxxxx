THIS CUSTOM XPADDER PROFILE WILL ALLOW YOU TO PLAY MASS EFFECT 3 (PC) WITH YOUR WIRED XBOX AND PS3 CONTROLLERS. I HAVE INCLUDED THE XPADDER PROGRAM AND INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY.

EVERYTHING TESTED AND WORKS GREAT JUST FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.

1. SKIP IF YOU HAVE XPADDER ALREADY INSTALLED... Before anything, first make sure you have already installed the necessary drivers for your game controller. (Drivers for a Original Microsoft Wired Xbox controller can be found at 
http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/xbox-360-controller-for-windows#support)

Now place the Xpadder5.7 folder in the directory where you would like to have it installed. (xpadder is a stand-alone app that does not require an install wizard) just place the folder on your hard drive wherever you like and always launch xpadder by right clicking and choosing RUN AS ADMIN.

2. Place the controller file(Mass Effect 3 RJ2.xpaddercontroller) & the mass effect 3 profile (Mass Effect 3 RJ MAPPINGS3.xpadderprofile) in your xpadder folder or wherever you save your xpadder profiles and controller mappings.

3.Plug in your controller

4.Right click xpadder5.7 and choose "run as admin"

5.After xpadder launches, There are 2 drop downs at the top of the window. The left one is for controller mappings and the right one is for specific game profiles.

FIRST - Click the little controller icon on the top left, and choose OPEN, Now browse your system for the "Mass Effect 3 RJ2.xpaddercontroller"

SECOND - Click the little page icon to the left of the second white box at the top of the window... CHOOSE OPEN, and browse for the
Mass Effect 3 RJ MAPPINGS3.xpadderprofile

after both files are loaded in xpadder you should be able to move your mouse cursor with the right stick... if its working your ready to play...

6. Minimize Xpadder and launch Mass Effect 3...
