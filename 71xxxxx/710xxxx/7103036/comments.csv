Found out today he is to have surgery next week to remove a foot of colon.

His Doctor is optimistic the blockage is benign due to blood tests not indicating cancer. Though at 72 all surgeries have inherent risk. But he has always been fit and healthy so the staff say he is in the best circumstance for this to be successful."
