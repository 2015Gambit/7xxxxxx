In response to removing the audio of this youtube flic:

Knowledge is free. Intellectual property is bullshit. If you created something be proud of it, and move on creating something again. Value of yours is not what you created but the skill how you apply your knowledge over and over again.

Respect and good luck for everyone in this ever chaning univers ;)
