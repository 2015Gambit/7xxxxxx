,thunderbum,2012-03-14T09:05Z,"Two petitions: 

1) one to get rid of Rush on military airwaves because he called a slut a slut (slut is as slut does)

2) one to keep Rush on military airwaves.

This time last week my colleague Leigh Munsil took note of a petition to ban Rush Limbaugh from the American Forces Network radio, which is broadcast to U.S. troops overseas.

Today, news comes of a new petition to keep Limbaugh on the AFN, though as of this morning it only has two of the 25,000 signatures required. Rick Maze of Military Times reports:

    Under that websiteâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s guidelines, petitioners have one month to collect 25,000 electronic signatures. If they meet this threshold, the White House promises an official response to the petition.

    The anti-Limbaugh petition needs less than 3,900 more signatures by April 3 to meet the requirement.

-----> The pro-Limbaugh petition needs to get 24,998 more signatures by April 10 to get an official White House response.

I'm sure Obama would love to pull the plug on Rush...
