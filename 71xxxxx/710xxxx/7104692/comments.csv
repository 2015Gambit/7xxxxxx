Just like to say you were being mildly racist, however that is not where you went wrong... u persisted being rude, racist, homophobic and chauvinistic. Admittedly you are entitled to your own views, but when they are as strong as yours i would keep them to yourself. Before you say it, I am from the UK, and although I do agree that we have an immigration problem, a vast majority of the immigrants who  live and work in the UK are honest, hard working, tax paying individuals, and in many cases helping the economy. Which is more than can be said for the british people scrounging for benefits without jobs! 

on another note, someone who has a passion or interest in fonts (especially helvetica) would not be called a calligrapher, they would probably refer to themselves as a typographer, and there is a difference, I suggest you look it up! just making the point if you are going to be opinionated and aggressive just make sure you are correct first. All the best mate...

[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-04-02T00:12Z,"Yes you are correct about it being a typographer , and i said i wasnt an expert in it, but I uploaded it for other people who like fonts ,  , but I typed it in haste and as you know , you cant edit mistakes afterwards .
I also agree that there are a lot of british that are  scrounging and  work shy and get benefits . And we should be harder on them too . 
And as i said , it's really the people who travel through europe , maybe passing 5 or 6 countries , end up at Calais , then smuggle into our country that really annoy me . You cant tell me they help the economy , for a start it's illegal for them to work . But they know their way round our system even before they arrive here , most of them fraudulently get benefits for everything under the sun . plus have jobs on the side . So therefore , don't pay tax .
I also stand by what i said about the legal immigrants , there are just too many allowed in this country , and it's because we are a soft touch , they know if they cant get a job they will still be looked after , so it's a win win situation for them .
I would like to see a system whereby you can't claim any sort of benefits unless you worked here for say 10 years . Yeah , something to put them off coming here .
If i was rude , i was only defending myself .
I'm not a homophobe , I think most people would have known that I was joking . 
But this pc world we have all been brainwashed into , wont let us even joke anymore . And whats quite funny is the Americans forget it wasnt long ago they made the coloured people sit at the back of the bus . And it wasnt long ago gays didnt have any rights . Give it another 20 year and they will probably deny it ever happened . 
In answer to you calling me chauvinistic , sorry , I don't think that's a bad thing , I love my country and would like a lot of changes .
I think I have answered all your points in a non aggresive manner .

I'm kinda torn reading your comments on immigration in UK. On one hand it's absolutely understandable to see you (I mean native Brits) upset and angry. To be honest I feel almost relieved to see somebody reacting in this manner as opposed to most people I meet here (Northern Ireland) who seem to be so brainwashed and gutless that you'd have to, I dunno, eat their children or something to get them to admit that there is a problem that needs solving.

On the other hand though, the question that right away springs into my mind is: do you really think that it's possible to behave like you lads (together with Yanks and the rest of the Western Europe) have been behaving for last several centuries and not pay the price of it? You have been dealing the cards for quite a while and the result is the world order where some have way more than they really need and the rest are burying their kids dying from hunger as we speak. Colonialism, drainage of natural resources, slave labour, puppet governments, war on terror (I mean war for oil, of course), political deceit, replacing original cultures with this meanignless pulp we see on TV. What is happening to you now is exactly what your ancestors  did to the whole world before.

I'm a Polish bloke. I assure you we know very well who fucked us over during the WWII. And no, of course I don't hate you and I realize that it isn't that simple, and that you are you and not Churchill and so on. But in the end - why wouldn't I spend few years away working for decent money where my skills are in demand and locals don't seem to be too eager to work themselves?

I think you are right but there simply is a bigger picture to the whole issue and by moaning you're becoming the part of the problem instead of the solution. If you really love your country start doing what's right. 
"
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-04-05T02:03Z,"You make some good points pjm77 . I agree in the past Britain has done it's fair share of crimes , I'm sure we didnt have our foot in one third of the world because those people wanted us there . I cannot defend the past , I also know Britain and their allies  let Poland down very badly indeed . And it was long before I was born . I am talking about the present though , and primarily the biggest annoyance  the people  have with our own government , is immigration . Lets be honest , they come to this country because it's a soft touch , with or without a job they will be looked after , if they know they need an operation , they can come here and get it free , they will be provided housing , schools for their kids , if they have no job they won't have to pay rent , they will also get money for themselves and their children . So I do see why they come , cause they would not get all this anywhere else in Europe . If our government stops all these perks for immigrants it would put many of them off coming here to start off with . These perks should be earned , as i said earlier , maybe have to work here 10 yr before you can get benefits . We have enough of our own abusing the benefits system without adding more to it .  "

,Roadeater,2012-04-12T10:05Z,"@Hugo222

By the very definition of the word 'race' it is implied as a competition. In the form of a 'team' if you will. Each team wears a guernsey/jersey/uniform for which they play, in this case the colour of one's skin. Being a 'racist' means you are a keen and passionate supporter/member of your own team, in a race, where the obvious goal is to win! I'm a competitor, and I freaking love my team!"
,pjm77,2012-04-12T23:51Z,"@steevo-be-thy-name - I totally agree that the way that immigration worked in UK (and many other Western countries) sucks big time, and it's hurting both local people and immigrants. I am personally disgusted to see some of my own people trying to abuse the benefit system, while back in my country that sort of scum wouldn't get anything else than boot in their arse. But in my experience it's minority, plus I have also seen people refusing benefits they were entitled to which left Jobs&Benefits clerks literally gasping for air. Witnessed with my own eyes number of times.

You say that you've got enough of your own benefit thieves so you want to get rid of foreign ones. The logical step is to change the social security system to more firm, which will take care of both. Targetting people based on their origin may prove to be a populist move that won't solve the problem but just provide some distraction for the time being. I'm obviously biased here (but not so much - I'm self employed so I don't give a fuck and don't receive any benefits) so I'm sure you'll do your own thinking but my reservations are:

- Pakis, Poles etc come first - OK. Who's next - short ones, bald ones?
- it's my wild guess based only on my personal experience but your economy may be at this point simply too dependant on immigrant people working for national minimum and paying their rents. It may simply all go belly up. Needs specialist expertise, there may be some, dunno...
- take a closer look at people who shouting against immigrants the loudest. You might be surprised to see some of the worst crooks and benefit thieves from your own neighbourhood. I come from a pretty rough background, seen and done a silly thing or two in my time, and I'm afraid that's the nature of such crowds."
,pjm77,2012-04-13T01:07Z,"@ultimate01 - indeed, two wrong things don't add up to one right. There is nothing you can do about the past and nobody with some wits about them is expecting you to do so. But there is plenty that can be done about the present. These are tough times, tough measures will have to be applied, there is no way to keep everybody happy, it'll all happen anyway. Yet keeping some basic standards of respect and listening to each other won't hurt. I never said that British people didn't work hard, empire of such magnitude can't be built without it. I'm simply stating that there was much suffering of other people involved as well. I'm not trying to play the guilty card here, I'm stating the fact and I'm very glad you guys don't deny that - I met some very different reactions many times before.

I can't generalize but the situation right now is rather different among people that I worked with. General standards of, broadly speaking, ""job well done"", particulary among younger generations of Northern Irish an Irish are very different from what I've been taught at home. Most of them are loud, incompetent, feel entitled, lack manners and faced with obstacles they give up or go nuts. I don't feel that it's about their nationality - it's a price of highly developed culture based on consumerism. It's happening in my own country right now but it'll take some more time to grow to such proportions. I'm writing all this being a son of a nation that is deeply flawed and has a lot to learn.

You really don't have to explain these things to me. Since quite an early age I've been a fierce Polish Nationalist. I'm very proud to be White. I was very radical at some point but life has taught me that these things, while very important have to come second to some very basic human values (and I mean VERY basic, no - we can't live forever, we can't all be beautiful and rich and nobody DESERVES anything unless we all work our asses off for it). I never bought this multi-culti and feminist shit. I believe that these ideas were very valuable and relevant at some point in time and most likely will be in the future but right now they have been taken to such an extreme that they have became absurd. Forcing them upon anyone serves no purpose, it never works in a long run. And there are people making serious money off it. It's wrong and politicians won't help us, they never do unless there's something in it for them. Ours as same bastards as yours. It's all about what we do with our lives and there will be no awards for doing it.

One thing that worries me is that I hear people talking about love for their nation and pride of their race and heritage and once they're done what comes next is a bucketload of hate, frustration, fear and often bigotry. These are human things and seem to be very repressed in our mainstream culture. But we can't just get stuck on this."

You're a halfwit, what does it mean to be racist when we're all fucking homo sapiens? ALL of us came from HOMO ERECTUS, and after that it becomes harder and harder to detect our lineage. So curiously enough, you think any one religion is better than the other, let alone color? If that's not chauvinistic I don't know what is, but chauvinism = ignorance. All people suck, some more than others, you clearly more than the rest; your own short-comings and failures have left you angry at the world and your peers. You want to be angry, direct your anger into the government rally your neighbors, demand sovereignty, tell them your not a fucking child and start getting educated. We're all owned and payed for by the same people. The IMF(International Monetary Fund) Controls all of our governments money, and is a U.N. Entity. It's all a facade you moron and those hateful ideas and propaganda you've surely read/watched is just to blind you from the bigger picture. I'm as white as they come, and if you think immigration in the U.K. is a problem, come here to the U.S. I'm 1609Km from the Mexican border, you know how many Illegals we have here, hah nearly 1/4 of my city's population is illegal, and they're not even the problem, who cares if they work under the table and don't pay taxes, don't know about your government, but mine doesn't appropriate it's funding very well, and I'm sure yours doesn't either. The real problem comes from all the people with more money than they no what to do with just sitting on their money. That's a fucking issue, economies die when you hoard the funds, hoarding = inflation. Even better, how about all the rich fucks in your country and in mine renouncing their citizenship to avoid taxes on their income? Get educated, I don't mind opinions when they have even a hair of intelligence behind them. Ignorance is what bred this fucking world, the only way to make it better is to evolve, and since we're done evolving our bodies, our next stop for expansion will be our brains, don't stop too soon, I look forward to a well thought out and witty response."

Unless you are trying to say everyone should just go into any country they want and scrounge off that country till they bleed it dry then move onto the next and so on , I think you would find a total collapse pretty soon . If you think I am a racist just because I dont want any more in , I'm sorry to say 90% of the UK must be one too . And I have already said it has nothing to do with colour or religion , and people renouncing their citizenship just to avoid taxes are very few indeed , believe me we don't need sean connery's tax and I doubt if it would help pay for all the illegal immigrants . They are totally seperate issues anyway . Thats like saying if we didnt waste loads of money on defence that would pay for all the immigrants . The point is we shouldnt have to subsidise anything for them to start with . So YOU get educated and stop trying to mix anything that comes into your head just to make the immigrant situation seem very small .
@ bfreixo Some of the stuff you have spouted about shagging our women as if you hate British people so much , well , why don't you fuck off back to where you came from . You say you were born in France , ironically the French people are very pissed off with foreigners also at this moment , as you will know underrated in the polls, Marine Le Pen has done better than her father: she has managed to gather 7 million people to protest against the system, against the elites, against the traditional parties, left and right, against immigrants, Europe and globalisation. so your own countrymen must be racists then . and for someone who has stayed here 22 years you might have learned English a bit better . Phool . No one is talking about pure races and we were not started by the French so don't talk shit .
