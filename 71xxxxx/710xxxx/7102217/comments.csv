V-4"
,chedderz66,2012-03-14T20:31Z,NOT HD  It's watchable but the color is washed out and bland comparable to a very good TS  I'm waiting for a quality R5 at least. 
,v7DusK,2012-03-14T21:12Z,"I don't know what makes this movie so great by Hollywood standards that it isn't released on DVD until April 17th. Can anyone help me figure that sh*t out? 
I have seen this movie a few times, reminded me... no wait it was EXACTLY like the first mission impossibles. Not much new to see here!"
,dac1949,2012-03-15T01:21Z,"thx for up!
V = Very good TS (6)
A = 8"
