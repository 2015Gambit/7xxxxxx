Product Description
A new translation finally appears of one of the seminal books in the history of literature. Adored by the Surrealists, Les Chants de Maldoror was hailed by them as a dark progenitor of their movement, and its author, Le Comte de Lautréamont (Isidore Ducasse) elevated to the status of literary idol. It was in these pages that André Breton discovered the phrase which would come to represent the Surrealist doctrine of “objective chance”: “as beautiful as the random encounter between an umbrella and a sewing-machine upon a dissecting-table”. Artists inspired by Lautréamont include Man Ray, Jacques Houplain, Jindrich Styrsky, René Magritte, Max Ernst, Victor Brauner, Óscar Domínguez, André Masson, Joan Miró, Roberto Matta, Yves Tanguy and, especially, Salvador Dalí, whose nightmare painting Autumn Cannibalism adorns this new, definitive edition of a transcendent masterpiece. Bonus features of this special ebook edition include a foreword on Lautréamont and Sade by Paul Éluard; a new psycho-biography of Lautréamont; and a two-part analysis of Maldoror as surrealistic nightmare.
