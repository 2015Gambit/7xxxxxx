Apollo 18 isn't real. It would have been but the last 5 Apollo missions (16 - 20) were canceled, partly due to budget restrictions. Instead of asking a stupid question why don't you try finding the answer first. A simple Google search would have more than answered your question. Or you could have tried www.NASA.gov"

Thanks Zen - great quality. The movie (key word ""movie"") is entertaining. Tad slow to start, then runs well. Definitely enjoyable and good A/V.    "
