some exe file missing!"
,ryzy,2012-03-31T11:27Z,"@maddydj52 It's not working for YOU - it doesn't mean that it is not working at all.

To play game run iw3sp.exe (or something like that) it should be in game folder (but i don't remember)"
,maddydj52,2012-03-31T12:27Z,"ye i have run that file.....

,ryzy,2012-03-31T18:17Z,"@omibrr 
Yes it is modern warfare 1. Look at my profile (by clicking name) and you will find rest modern warfares. Kaos - group preparing repack version of game. Their releases are highly compressed. The call of duty made by kaos take very long to unpack but the size is pretty small."

,skaburdie,2012-05-27T07:50Z,To all future downloader of  this game do not download this because it is a complete failure. Seriously it is not a good upload i tell you.
,razor5151,2012-05-30T02:31Z,"ryzy...

Man is there a typo in the unpack batch file..?
Coz when i open it just says all done :P Press any key to continue...

The archives from .r00 to.r29 have the winrar icon on them, but the rest don't.

the install.exe program doesen't work either. It says- The archive Call of duty Modern Warfare - Kaos is missing.

My antiv virus hasn't deleted anything, i'm 100 % sure of that.."
