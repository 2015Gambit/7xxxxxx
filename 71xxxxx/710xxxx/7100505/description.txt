Synopsis

By John Mortimer
Adapted by Richard Stoneman

It's 1959, and Rumpole is faced with defending a clergyman accused of shoplifting who although he clearly did not commit the crime, is curiously reluctant to be cross examined under oath, where he would have to tell the truth, but save himself from being be defrocked.

Meanwhile Rumpole's fellow barrister and friend Frobisher, a confirmed batchelor, announces his engagement to a very merry widow, whom Rumpole seems to remember he has met somewhere before...

And finally, Hilda, she who must be obeyed, drops a bomb of information which will have a profound effect on their marriage.
