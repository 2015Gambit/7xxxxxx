,Doxxer,2012-04-02T07:56Z,"Hi.

Is it possible to upgrade this torrent to Telerik 2012 - Q1 - SP1?"
,unmarkedfaith,2012-04-05T17:24Z,I am not sure I understand what you are asking. This package includes the Ultimate collection of the gold release of 2012 Q1 from Telerik.  I have also recently just published the recent Dev hotfixes as well for this package but as individual items.
,Doxxer,2012-04-05T19:07Z,"Hi, unmarkedfaith!

I see, I mean: Telerik recently released the service pack #1 for the 2012_Q1. (You may see here http://www.telerik.com/products/silverlight/whats-new/release_notes/q1-2012-sp1-version-2012-1-326.aspx )

So, Is it possible publish this package? 

Thank you."
,unmarkedfaith,2012-04-09T17:10Z,I posted the most recent hotfix patches last week. If this isnt it I will get my hands on sp1 asap.
,unmarkedfaith,2012-04-12T01:12Z,Service pack 1 is now live. look @ my profile torrents for the downloads

,VDCampos,2012-04-23T10:55Z,"Hey dude just want to let you know that Telerik Released Q2 2012 or R2 2012, which ever is right. Please give us a torrent of that because having the non-latest version of Telerik RadControls make me so mad and sad."
,VDCampos,2012-04-23T11:00Z,What was the link of Q1 on Telerik? Maybe I can make one for Q2
,rflfn,2012-04-24T17:08Z,Thx man! i download it...

,unmarkedfaith,2012-04-26T04:03Z,"If you would check the other torrents of mine you will see that SERVICE PACK 1 was released. I have each item as its own torrent.  Please look @ the recent ones.    Q2 is not out yet, I just checked their site."
