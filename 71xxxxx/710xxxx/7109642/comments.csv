,sarsars,2012-03-18T20:42Z,Dead? What happened?
,smokincorpses,2012-03-18T21:59Z,"It installed something called Futuremark, but its not them, it was a virus, hiding in %appdata% roaming - futuremark. "
,sarsars,2012-03-18T23:00Z,"Do you know what it did other than install the files you mentioned?

AVG didn't find anything when I checked it. What are you running? I guess I'll have to check my releases better. Thanks for writing"
,smokincorpses,2012-03-19T02:48Z,"Windows 7, 64 bit, it ran something called umd.exe or something, was only using 575k mem, avast picked it up after a ""quick scan""...... that took 3 hours. just slowed down the pc dead"
,HiArashi,2012-03-19T06:15Z,"Neither Avast!, nor AVZ with cureit found any threat. It could be some sort of glitch... Does this happen every time you try to scan it?"
,HiArashi,2012-03-19T06:18Z,"Oh... btw, didn't work for me. Game launches, menu works, but CTD with error ""floating point support not loaded"". But I think it is my problem, not that of release."
,s1raz1,2012-04-10T07:04Z,"Dont dl it, its not a skidrow release.

,BiggDocc,2012-04-18T23:02Z,"I am getting the same error ""floating point support not loaded"".  Don't know what the problem is..."
