RELEASE NOTES

Get ready to experience a revolution in tower defense that will send
you spinning. Unstoppable Gorg challenges you to defend the solar
system from fearsome aliens by sending satellites into orbit. Unlike
other tower defense games, in Unstoppable Gorg you can move your
towers by rotating the orbits that surround planets, moons and space
stations

Unstoppable Gorg is a lovingly crafted homage to vintage sci-fi films
from the 1950s. Flying saucers, rubbery aliens, dodgy effects, it's got
it all. The game's story scenes were shot on film using models
miniatures and live action actors and then edited together with genuine
archive footage to create a classic sci-fi experience that is out of
this world

Satellites in orbit replace the towers and grid layout used in other
