,pusepatten,2012-03-21T03:13Z,"Hey! lovely torrent! :D Was just woundering, when clicking the exposure4.exe it says that the Program cant start because QtGui4.dll doesn't exist :C you know why? :)"
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-21T09:43Z,"@'pusepatten ' :

You can get it here -

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7119551/Photoshop_Plugin_Alien_Skin_Exposure.4.0.0.439_missing_dll_file

Just follow instructions.

(Some systems lack certain dll files. You have not specified which is your OS , but follow the instruction and you should be fine )"
,thevideoguy,2012-03-23T01:42Z,"i downloaded the files and followed the instruction....but i did not get the ""register by email prompt""....any thoughts.."
,VinceJ,2012-04-07T23:57Z,"Excellent torrent, but I'm having difficulty with license code.  All the licence code entered at the Software Set up works but when I press next to activate I get a message saying 'Activation was not successful, the licence code was not valid'

Can anyone help?  I'm still running the trial version.   "
,Peter_GG,2012-04-08T20:45Z,Awesome work man - thx a lot! :-)
,nurd06,2012-04-10T22:56Z,"hey there, kudos for the upload!! however im having problems after keying in the key generated by xforce. how do i exactly go about by email activation? just email the support the licence code & serial? thanks again :)"
,eshimul,2012-05-18T13:28Z,"hey,  I'm facing same problem here with activation. Does anybody have an idea what to do??"
,imstark,2012-05-29T22:36Z,"I'm also having activation problems. When I start ""license activation tool.exe"" (program files/alien skin/exposure 4) after copying and replacing it, pops a window to activate and there's nothing about email activation or anything about keygen. Did I do something wrong? I'm using the trial version."
,dentist2112,2012-07-14T19:54Z,"VIRUS!  Yes, before you all jump down my throat, it is a virus.  Confirmed by ZoneAlarm, and the fact that it knocked my system out.  Assholes"
,SealTeam9,2012-07-30T17:19Z,It seems none of the current torrents cater to Photoshop CS6 x64.  Any news on that front?
,creetical,2012-08-06T00:43Z,"Guys it works.

When Activation fails:
1.) Copy The Installation Code and paste it on the Keygen's Installation ID
2.) Click Generate
3.) Copy the Generated Serial Number
4.) Paste it on Option number 3 of the Licensce Activator
5.) Close activator and keygen then retry if it still doesn't work :D"
,Auscultation,2012-08-08T18:14Z,"Will this work with Lightroom 4?  
I'm an Audio Engineer, but I don't know jack about Photography. Therefore, I'm starting w/ ""an easier program"" (LR4). Since you all are experienced, I'm throwing this out there for any feedback, thoughts, etc. Thanks in advance for the upload, to all those who ""share/seed"" & thanks for your time...   "
,nasospakos,2012-08-18T16:19Z,"@creetical: you're right dude, we need to be more careful. The codes should match in all tabs!"
,yetimeister,2012-09-02T20:20Z,"Seem to be getting an error with this crack while running Windows 7 x64 - ""A general error has occurred while starting the application. Reinstalling may fix the problem.""

First run of Exposure 4 was yesterday before crack and it worked great. Now with the crack i'm getting this.

Also note, I can run the Exposure 4 application perfectly outside of Photoshop CS6 in it's stand-alone form unfortunately they don't actually allow you to do anything with the stand-alone application. Is this a CS6 issue?"
