Do Not Download This Torrent. Do Not Seed this torrent. The file will only play the first 20 minutes of the episode and then it stops. I have no idea why this is. I have a complete version of it that i have tested as i always do on a 32 in 1080p hdtv but that is not what is being shared. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and I completely understand if you choose to no longer download From me. It was not my intention to upload a bad file and i hope my track record shows that. I will not be uploading Jersey Shore this week i have too much going on with work and school to reupload and frankly its 1:47 PST so im kinda tired. you all have my sincere apologies.
