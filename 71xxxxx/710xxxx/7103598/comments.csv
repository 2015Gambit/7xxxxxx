You can't import a video file for editing without running the program's serial number through an ""activation server"".  If done over the internet without a Serif validated and assigned serial number - GAME OVER.  However there is the alternative of contacting Tech Support and arguing the point with them.  However, the Program installs GREAT. "

I had a small problem with installation but I found the solution. This maybe is useful for the others  who maybe have the same problem.
After mount or burn you double click the 'setup.exe' and a language choice window opens. If you leave the default 'English (UK)' the program will never setup. You HAVE TO choose the 2nd selection 'English (US)'. After that,  everything will be fine.. enjoy!"

,armchair.53,2012-06-07T12:01Z,I can confirm that you need to select US as language.  And also confirm that you really can't do anything with this because of the Unlocker.  So it's pretty much useless
