,Terozer,2012-03-17T19:29Z,"Lyca77, full HD 2d movie is over 20gig uncompressed... This is full HD x2....
I do not like the 8gig~ movies because you can see its compressed and destroys a bit of the movie feeling.,.. "

Burn this to BD50 and have it played in Blu-ray player. Or mount the image with Daemon Tools or Alcohol120 then play the movie with PowerDVD/TotalMedia Theatre 5/TriDef 3D/etc."
