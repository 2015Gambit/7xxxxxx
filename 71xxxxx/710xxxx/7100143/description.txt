Tchaikovsky is considered to be Russia's great symphonic composer. In his music he achieved a synthesis of the national musical language of Russia and the compositional forms of the western European Romantics. His most famous ballets enjoy a position of honor in the Classical Ballet repertoire because of their melodic intensity and instrumental brilliance. 
In the fairy tale "The Nutcracker and the King of the Mice" written by E.T.A. Hoffman, on which Tchaikovsky's ballet is based, Christmas provides the realistic setting for a fantastic plot. Fiction and reality are woven together by means of strange and wonderous occurences to produce a fascinating and unfathomable labyrinth. In 1999, exactly 107 years, to the day, after the first performance in St. Petersburg, Patrice Bart's choreography of Tchaikovsky's worldwide success "The Nutcracker" was premiered at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin. Bart placed a prologue before the ballet in which Marie is abducted as a child in which everything is placed in a modern context.
