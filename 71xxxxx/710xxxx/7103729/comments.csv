,spenceri,2012-03-15T17:53Z,this is not season three seeing as how the 2nd season has 17 episodes in it this would be s02e11
,RoxanpunX,2012-03-15T19:46Z,"The reson for confusion is Comedy Network, called it the ""Season Premire"" causing everyone to think its Season 3. What really happened is the  network decieded to ""wait"" to finish off the remaining 7 epsiodes alongside with South Park (who actually did have a seson premire) It was there way of making mnore hype out of us, and leaving us confused thinking we missed episodes >.< or atleast i did"
