Details:

Tim Fite will help you recapture your wasted youth with his latest aural offering, AinΓÇÖt, AinΓÇÖt, AinΓÇÖt. With a background in hip-hop as one half of the early-00ΓÇ▓s duo Little T and One Track Mike, Fite inculcated an entire generation with the phrase ΓÇ£Shaniqua donΓÇÖt live here no more,ΓÇ¥ a refrain somehow embedded in the psyche of even those who have never knowingly listened to the song.
