Description

Plot: Follow the story of Jesus in this slapstick satire. With a name like “Jesus, the Total Douchebag” the movie should only be seen by people who enjoy blasphemous comedy, and as such, the comedy is focused on targets that are usually exempt. Director Bill Zebub explains, “Indie movies should revel in their freedom. They are not confined to the same boundaries as the big budget movies. They should give what Hollywood can’t.”
