,loreneth,2012-03-17T04:55Z,this is for the 32bit version of windows do you have the 64 bit version?
,t0017,2012-03-17T05:25Z,"I have windows 7 64 bits, and it works.

But you need to have the java 32 bits version."
,loreneth,2012-03-17T06:46Z,"erm no when i download it from their official forums it works perfect only it asks for a login and paswsord when trying to play and when i try to launch this it says 

Can't load IA 32-bit .dll on a AMD 64-bit platform
i think by removing the protection it removed some version check or something cause the original works fine. and i have downloaded both the 32 and 64 bits versions of java."
,free_thinker,2012-03-17T12:04Z,"I got the same problem but I found a way to start it:
-go to the game folder and choose a bat to launch the game, depending on your resources
-create a backup copy of it and open the original with notepad, you'll see at the top:

set path=%path%;%ProgramFiles%Javajre7bin;%ProgramFiles(x86)%Javajre7bin;
""%ProgramFiles%Javajre7binjava""

and you should change it with

set path=%path%;%ProgramFiles(x86)%Javajre7bin;
""%ProgramFiles(x86)%Javajre7binjava""

-save and run the bat you just edited and when it asks you for login and pass just click ""Log In"" and the game will start.

It worked for me, let me know if it helps."

,Alantos90,2012-03-21T22:24Z,"How do i delete the password, the key and the username on Desura from my PC? I was so excited, that i didn't read the important thing and my game is messed up. After launching it, there's character creation, then, after clicking start, there is a black screen... It doesn't respond."
,Alantos90,2012-03-22T09:09Z,"NOPE, it's just java out of memory error, someone knows how to fix it?"
,Yakkut,2012-03-23T14:20Z,"Whenever I try to start it through those .bat files, it just shows a prompt screen saying system couldnt find the path or something like that, then it says PAUSE and Press any key to continue. I press a key and it doesn't do anything.
