I'll be picking up the slack."
,zx6rider,2012-03-14T08:28Z,Thank you for your upload and time..  I do not mind late release.. is there anyway you can pack 5 of them in a weekly upload like you have done a couple times in the past?
[V],alexisthebest,2012-03-14T12:27Z,"@zx6rider

Id rather try and have them uploaded the day the episode airs.
I would only pack them up when i missed the majority of the week, sorry."
