,123487,2012-03-14T20:08Z,who is bobo66 anyway?
,goldfrop,2012-03-14T20:13Z,Something is definitely wrong here....
,poffik,2012-03-14T20:37Z,"reporting for fake, 4 hours of DL it doesn't go past 1% on 10mbs download connection. fake."
,Tortolin,2012-03-14T20:49Z,"How can you upload something and bail after just 4 hours of seeding?

To much hit and runners these days"
,greenwheel,2012-03-14T21:00Z,Thanks a bajillion!
,Wolfeye76,2012-03-14T22:35Z,This torrents shape is beyond the curse of JupiterÂ´s cock.
,ams89,2012-03-14T22:41Z,What a disappointing torrent.
,croweater,2012-03-15T00:46Z,What gives?
,a_hydra,2012-03-15T04:12Z,Horrible seeding =(
,sod720,2012-03-15T05:05Z,Where are the usuals? This one doesn't seem very hopeful.
,BurferTheGreat,2012-03-15T06:58Z,"It's a bona fide upload, but the seeds showing on this page don't show while d/l'ing.   (97%) shown on my client.   We need that last 3 % somewhere."
,BurferTheGreat,2012-03-15T07:13Z,"100 % of mkv file is there. It will not show as seeding in client (only 97%) but QUALITY is there.

,fzdread,2012-03-15T08:06Z,i dont understand... what do you mean that the seeds arent showing? im stuck at 96.6 percent...
,fzdread,2012-03-15T08:08Z,i dont understand... what do u mean seeds dont show? i am stuck at 96.6 percent
,fzdread,2012-03-15T08:12Z,any1 know? the file seems to play on vlc...
,zx6rider,2012-03-15T08:32Z,It is working just fine.. but like the comment above said it is not showing the last 4% or so DLed..  I actually watched it from beginning till end and it was all there while it was still saying it was downloading. excellent quality too 10/10 : A/v  Iam not sure why its acting screwy but you can watch it :)
,marmad,2012-03-15T11:25Z,"The bit that is unseeded (the .033%) is the sample and the .nfo file - the full episode is good.  Just set the other two files to 'don't download' in your client, and you're good to go."
,k_zildjian,2012-03-15T12:11Z,"At 96.6% the sample and nfo files seem to be incomplete, but the main mkv file is intact.  Party on..."
,ams89,2012-03-15T13:14Z,"I got the mkv-file another way, and has been uploading it through this torrent. The uploader bobo66 is gone."
,rok68,2012-03-15T14:39Z,"as zx6rider said - .mvk file is working perfectly, i'm stuck on 96,6% for second day now, but after zx6's post, i checked it out and it's working..."
,JakesterX,2012-03-15T16:54Z,"Download to 96.6%. Your done. Enjoy the quality video.The missing sample vid is the  3.4% that the torrent keeps seeking. Ignore.

Even better, set your torrent client to NOT include the sample or NFO file in the download and then your client will know the DL is done after the main video is complete."
,BurferTheGreat,2012-03-15T19:34Z,"This is a good up.  Just download to 96.6 and enjoy/seed.  The uploader/1st seed was canned by ISP while uploading. The lwhole show is there at 
a=10
v-10

Seed that 96.6"
,KLopeK_7,2012-03-15T20:34Z,"96.6 stop.

PLEASE SEEDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,KLopeK_7,2012-03-15T20:45Z,"Sample is incomplete, but the full episode is complete 100%"
,1Anarchy,2012-03-18T20:26Z,Since there is a lack of seeders I will be happy to seed at my connection maximum once it finally downloads.  
,Hard2Find2,2012-03-19T02:09Z,You must have deleated part of the file while seeding or something to cause this error uploader
