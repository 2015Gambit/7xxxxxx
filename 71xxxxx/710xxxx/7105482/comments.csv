No. You will have to replace the program itself if you want newer version. 

However, updating maps is no problem. Just remove the country from your selection in Sygic updater, and choose it again to be sure to have the latest map version. No more looking around to find new maps... :-)"

Where can I download more language voice guide?"
,trader7891,2012-03-31T17:19Z,"Just downloaded and installed on a Galaxy S2. 

Can just bluetooth from your com to your phone and run the apk file.

Make sure it's a clean install, i uninstalled previous versions, and voila, perfectly working. "

You are warned!!"
,QBall70,2012-06-11T01:01Z,"@ qusawa -

You are a babbling, blithering dipshit of a moron.  First off, the word is ""steal"", not fucking ""steel"", you fucking dumb-ass.  Next?  This doesn't steal a damned thing.

Go jam a STEEL rod up your whiny ass and disappear.  Fucking asshole troll.
