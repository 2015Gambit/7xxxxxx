,omegaviper,2012-03-15T05:33Z,"@dududus I understand your really dumb but come on if your downloading content meant for modded consoles, you should know that is like creating the data from nothing the ps3 code is completely different than 360 there is no converting it does not work like that.

@ everyone asking about jtag only... obviously it is there is no data that can be put on the 360 hdd that would not require it to be jtagged so assume all hdd only data that you see on the internet to download is for jtag only you stupid fucks."
,KingNico,2012-03-15T18:16Z,"@omegaviper

You're the fucking idiot, I was asking because there has been plenty of DLC that I MYSELF have been able to put on my NONJTAG 360 by using programs like Horizon and Modio, even when the uploader says something about installing to HD, thats what those programs are for when you are able to use a usb flash drive as memory for your xbox360, maybe you should go do some research first before trying to come off smart and making yourself seem like an omegadumbass"
,xxfalcosxx,2012-03-20T14:20Z,@ everyone asking about jtag only. It work for none Jtaged xbox as i do not have a jtag but you need program to do this youtube is your freind as is google. the main one i use is modio and a old one too.
,aznsavage7293,2012-03-21T19:32Z,Can someone help me and tell me how I use this torrent? I've downloaded it but don't know what to do next.
,Mr.BlizzardBeta,2012-06-16T04:28Z,"Ok. so I believe I have done it all correctly. But I know otherwise... I get the weapons. I get the option to play as the other team.. BUt. when I load the game. My chars all are there in in a black screen. and after a few seconds it crashes ?
