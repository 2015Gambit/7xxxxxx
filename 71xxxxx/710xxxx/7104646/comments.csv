,Espionage724,2012-03-15T15:44Z,"The .torrent file I uploaded is from the Mac downloader also for any curious:

Diablo-III-8370-enUS-Installer-downloader.app.zipDiablo-III-8370-enUS-Installer-downloader.appContentsResourcesdownloader.torrent

So this is in fact straight from Blizzard, unmodified, untouched in any way."
,seedMeister,2012-03-15T22:52Z,"i dont get it. is this the actual game, does it have the SP campaign?

can it run on W7 ?"
,Espionage724,2012-03-16T00:26Z,"this is the actual game. It is online-only, and basically the installer is useless until May 15th :p

This is for people wanting to get the installers before launch :)"
,takeone_84,2012-03-16T03:28Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7105821/Diablo_III_-_Retail_version

Full version"
,Espionage724,2012-03-16T05:45Z,I call fake on takeone_84's version. 4GB? The installer alone is 7.6GB...
,Mighty Sheep,2012-03-16T12:45Z,"yes you can play alone, but you are still getting information from the server so its not your classical 'download the game, play singleplayer, dont give a damn about multiplayer since that doesnt work anyways'. since game is more like a mmo by structure, cracks are highly unlikely. i mean look at beta emulator - beta has been out there for quite awhile and its still shit... and beta is only hour and a half long. imagine how long it would take to make everything else. its essentially scripting the whole game and its mechanics from scratch by using games files.

this torrent is pretty much for those who are buying the game, but have low download speed from blizzard server.

im not saying that you should buy this, but expecting an early crack is silly."
,tospeed1980,2012-03-17T08:49Z,this is waste of time...
,tospeed1980,2012-03-17T08:50Z,this is waste of time... i will pay for this 'til it released
,Espionage724,2012-03-17T12:54Z,"@tospeed1980 waste of time? Go download the installer at launch then, and then see how much of a waste of time this is :p

The purpose of acquiring this installer BEFORE release is to prepare yourself FOR the release (as in, you don't obviously want to download 7.6GB as soon as Diablo III comes out if your trying to play it ASAP, and chances are download servers will be overloaded at launch)"
,tospeed1980,2012-03-19T10:20Z,waste of time? not really but still i want to pay to Blizzards for Diablo III. Is this cracked or something get to play? Sorry I have bad english :)
,tospeed1980,2012-03-19T10:29Z,oh this is playable online until it launch - i will download
,Espionage724,2012-03-19T10:54Z,"This is only the installer, and isn't usable (to my knowledge) until May 15th. Even when May 15th arrives, the only way your playing Diablo III is if you pay for it. 

So you can still buy Diablo III, and download this, then come May 15th, you just run the installer, then patch it, then play :)"
,suiggy,2012-03-30T00:45Z,finally looking for this file. i ordered for the game collector's edition but won't get it for some time since i'm not from the USA. this way i could just get the cd key from my sister(who is in USA) and use it on this installer.
,suiggy,2012-03-30T00:46Z,just wondering. on launch date how do you get this to work?
,raiden92,2012-05-27T20:23Z,"@Espionage724 now does this diablo provide online and single player, and how can this work battle net is a private server "
,tflagger997,2012-05-28T00:54Z,"No, there are no Cracks or Emulators that work with D3.
No private server, no access to Battle.net unless you actually buy a serial for it.

Everyone on YouTube is lying about having one, and most of the major crackers are not even looking into getting it working. What is really pathetic, is they will not even let their faithful fans know that they are not working on it.

So posting these things, and saying 'wait for a crack' is a scam. There may be an emulator eventually (6-12 months) but no time soon (unless YOU hack the Blizzard servers and get the other 2GB of assets they withheld). This is nothing more than a 8GB waste of time right now. "
,Shadysmurff,2012-05-28T03:14Z,"@raiden92

Nope, theres never gonna be a cracked coz its server sided like WoW, there aint gonna be even such thing as crack for this, the only way i know WoW and Diablo 3 is gonna be a private server emulator, but will prolly take a year or so to make from private individuals, but every installers i said above are corrupt except for this one, you can install this and buy a CD key and play, this installer is the legit retail one. all of the others are corrupted installers or cant even install expect this one."
,Shadysmurff,2012-05-28T03:19Z,"[my Quoted Copy Past from other torrents]:

Ive Fkin tried re-downloading each of this fkin torrents like x2:

"
,raiden92,2012-05-28T04:28Z,Shadysmurff so there is really no point in downloading the game .
,raiden92,2012-05-28T05:41Z,@Espionage724 so is there a point of installing the game?
,Shadysmurff,2012-05-29T03:02Z,"@raiden92

There is, if you dont have a shop near selling the physical cd, and you wanted the installer and just buy the CD Key from Ebay without shipping, just sending the code to you, itll help you play the game sooner."
,Shadysmurff,2012-05-31T18:49Z,"Can anyone give me a enUS Guest Pass for Diablo 3, ive already downloaded the game client via torrent and have already installed it and fully patched with d3 server, i kinda wanted to try it before i get my Diablo 3 that i bought from ebay, that will prolly take about 1 month to arrive from us to asia with normal shipping as it said, and ill give the guest pass back to anyone who give me, after i get my Real CD key and the 3 free Guest Pass i gonna get from buying the Real CD. i also tried what this dude on forum said: http://forums.atomicmpc.com.au/index.ph â&#x20AC;Ś 77&st=1260 but i dont see any Game Client Download for Diablo 3 Starter Edition on my battlenet account."
,axinte,2012-07-01T15:07Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
,killereofdis,2012-07-21T10:20Z,someone help me i have it installed but on blizzard dont so what should i do for the game to work
