,thisisntart,2012-03-23T14:25Z,"I'm running this on a late 2009 macbook pro 13"" and did a wipe / install (using migration assistant) from 10.6.8 SL (2.26 / 8gb).

the pros: everything switched over, iTunes, iPhoto, all my docs, info, everything. Love the new features, its super chronic, minimal bugs on the whole.

the cons: the computer will sometimes flash black and I won't be able to click anything (hard reboot) if I push my computer hard while editing a website using wordpress running google chrome (w/multiple tabs open), coda, and mac mail. Each app initially crashed once, had to click it again and then it didn't crash (ie: notes, reminders, mail, all mac apps). Desktop plist was corrupt (image was stuck on SL image), had to delete the plist and we're all good. Opening Waves plugins v8 r3 (cracked) in Ableton Live (paid) had a glitchy screen on the plugin window when I dropped the plugin to use (it didn't have that in 10.6.8). Minimal things like the browser (chrome) acting weird when trying to upload a file into bandcamp will crash shockwave plugin browser when pressing left arrow.  Also, I was browsing files in finder and it didn't like me opening a folder with audio files in it (beachball for 20 seconds).  I think it was indexing the calculated sizes of the files in a sample library on an external drive.

Should you install? I think its worth installing but only if you are a die hard mac fan with an iPhone who absolutely needs these new cloud apps/features.  If it eventually crashes on me hard core I'll probably switch to Lion but I am really hoping they'll release Version 3 because the notifications bar w/cloud pushed reminders & mac mail is the most epic thing ever. Mac has rebounded."

,xinweittm,2012-03-24T03:13Z,"Hi, I downloaded this torrent but I'm unable to mount the dmg file as it says ""no mountable file systems"" Can someone help me with this problem???"
,Toaboy,2012-03-24T06:02Z,can I use this on my sony vaio? boot it from usb and install this on another partition?

,Doubzstep,2012-03-27T07:00Z,"Thank You very much. Going to use a website called ZBigz to download this. Check it out. 

PS That was not spam, just a good website for those who go to a college or workplace that blocks torrents and/or torrent traffic."
,Goodspeed2012,2012-03-28T02:29Z,"Hash (MD5) of downloaded file is 85a834c08706ff8d6ac92328c6bd6e1f
It's different from Info Hash
OK?"
,mojo-666,2012-03-28T22:00Z,my file also md5sum's to 85a834c08706ff8d6ac92328c6bd6e1f and it mounts fine. I think the Info hash is the hash of the torrent.
,CokeA,2012-03-30T06:42Z,"It works perfect for me. the only problem that i have, are the wallpapers. because when i change it, and then, at restart the imac, the wallpaper go back to be the original."
,pranav429,2012-04-03T21:27Z,"Okay now I'll explain you , how it is done.

you can take down these notes.

You wil have to install mountain lion in a new partition. 
The partition should be formatted as ""journaled""
You can run the mountain lion file from your lion/snowlepord directly, no need to write it on disc.
when you install make sure you select the partition that you select is the newly formatted one.
mountain lion will install and work on the new partition.
all your files, i.e documents , music etc on you remain hard drive will stay intact.
after installation, if you wish to start your laptop on the older os, the press option button while restarting.
I recommend that if you are a normal user, you would not find mountain lion's developer preview so interesting. as there is hardly anything new
iMessages is new but you can install it in your old OS also.
moreover, many softwares won't work on the mountain lion as they are not configured yet.
i suggest you install the mountain lion only when the full version is released.

If you have any other issue , feel free to contact me."
