,carrot_muncher,2012-03-17T11:41Z,"xViviDx

Putting them onto an external drive is what I do to, or steam them.
There's no need to split the file so people can burn them to CD's. We aren't living in the 90's still, I bet them people who moan they can't burn them onto CD's still have pagers. DVD's are cheap enough nowadays..."

[T],FRITZBox,2012-03-18T19:46Z,"@manhobrs magnets let you download the torrent from other peers. µTorrent does not get the metadata before you can start it. There are lots of alternatives to µTorrent, that do have great support for magnets."

,nowoka1na,2012-03-18T23:24Z,"""This way you can fit the while movie on two CD's"" - sorry m8 but who burn rips on to discs now days? Few Meg pendrive cost less then pack of CD's, if you are in need of fiscally walking around with it. And dont say you use DVD player to watch it. DVI-HDMI cable is much cheaper, even if you dont have USB port in your player. To far from pc to tv? Move your god-damn laptop, or your sisters laptop.

I am using utorrent as always and I tried to install the newest version of it but it doesn't work. I almost tried other torrentclient (vuze) but it didn't work too.

Anyway, is there a working solution for that symptom? What do you suggest?
