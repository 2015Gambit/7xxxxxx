"Urban Matrimony and the Sandwich Arts"

Andre (guest star Malcolm Jamal Warner) 
proposes that he and Shirley remarry and 
a wedding date is set. Britta and Annie 
get busy planning the wedding and Jeff 
prepares to give a wedding speech - while 
Troy and Abed get ready to be "normal" 
for the occasion. Meanwhile, Pierce and 
Shirley pitch a sandwich shop idea to 
Dean Pelton for the Greendale cafeteria.

Evolve...or die.

Community is finally back! NBC put this
show on hiatus, and now bumps Parks for
Up All Night... no wonder they are such
a failnetwork.

Enjoy :)
