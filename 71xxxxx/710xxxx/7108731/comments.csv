[T],promodsharma,2012-03-17T10:47Z,"@'edifirk' - Whose payroll are you on ? Everybody has problems with TPB. The TPB is great. If you do not like TPB, why do you return again & again & again (refer your history at TPB) and have the same grouse every time ?

Just stop visiting."

,bbox244,2012-06-29T21:21Z,"I never comment, but this one takes the cake.   As an American I can tell you first hand that the complainer is an American.  No doubt.  We expect everything for free, and get pissed when we don't get out free stuff.  We scam off our neighbors to get as much free stuff from our friends as possible.  We scam and sue people for little shit to get free money, we do everything we can to get money from hard working people.  This is the American way.  We even resort to crime which is why as a country America imprisons more people than any other country in the world.  The greed in the justice system has grown a giant thirsty Animal into a huge money grubbing creature begging for more blood and money.  Our prisons are overflowing, people are getting sentanced to dozens of years for stupid shit which effects NOBODY BUT THEMSELVES.  Thats just insane.  People going to jail for shit nobody knows about or cares about.  Victimless crimes are the number one reason people go away these days.  Do not come here, instead, please invite me over to your country so I can switch.  I hate it here.  Every day, more bills and shit I don't even know about, it's all insanity."
