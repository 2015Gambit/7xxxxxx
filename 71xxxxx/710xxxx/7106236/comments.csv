There will be a significant delay in posting this program. The source from which I normally get the show was AFU for both the (my time) 5PM and 8PM broadcasts, and Current re-broadcasts the Friday show only ONCE! :-(

So, if another source eventually comes through for the 3/16 program, I will post it then."

The alternate source I normally use has still not posted this program.

For timeliness, your best bet is to grab this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7109357/Countdown_with_Keith_Olbermann_-_2012-03-16_%5Bmp4%5D

FWIW, here is the info I would have posted for this program, had I been able to UL it:
