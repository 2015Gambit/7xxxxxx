Pause and resume downloads, get a huge list of files, and get everything in a site with GetBot - the free, no spyware download manager for Windows.

Relentless
GetBot is relentless, recovering broken downloads from errors and busy servers. If a dial-up connection is lost, GetBot can redial the modem automatically.

Speed
GetBot accelerates downloads with any number of simultaneous connections, even within the same file. GetBot saves files instantly if they're already in the Internet Explorer cache.

Control
GetBot tells you everything that's happening with a download. You can see how big the file is before it's downloaded, see what parts and percent are saved, and know the download speed and when it will be done. GetBot even tells you how long its been since the server responded before automatically trying again.
