Soviet Topographic maps

The size of the archive is 90 GB with 75000 files so I had to split it into multiple torrents.

This are Soviet Military Topographic Maps downloaded from server.   
http://poehali.net/ . The production date of most maps is from 1960 to
1989. This are very detailed maps, especially for USSR, the Far and Near East.
In many countries this are the only detailed openly available maps.

In the torrent you will find coverage.html , this map shows the approximate
coverage of each map sheet. A 1958 map symbol guide is available in soviet.pdf .

The map scales are

1 : 1 000 000

1 : 500 000

1 : 200 000

These maps were created using the Krassovsky 1942 spheroid, the Pulkovo
1942 datum.

NOTE:

This files are incorrect because our map source was incorrect. You have
to replace them with map data from a different source.
