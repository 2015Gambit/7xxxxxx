Do you get a massive orgasm everytime you read your own post? - Ur such a lame Fuck-tard..."
,tommyhawkster,2012-05-03T23:56Z,"Crash2701, If it doesn't work for you, delete it, and find one that does.  I guess you should have read your warranty agreement more closely.  Oh wait, there isn't one!  Your stealing and then complaining about your stolen product.  It was FREE man.  "
