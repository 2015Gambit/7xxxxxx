,we_r_nd,2012-03-15T01:15Z,where is the 175 MB avi copy???? 
,Jack8989,2012-03-15T17:20Z,"Hello, I would both like to thank you for taking the time to upload this but also explain why so many of us are frustrated with the MKV format. Its not that the quality isnt great its that the programs many of us use to burn DVDs do not support MKV and it turns a 2 minutes project with an AVI into a big project not worth doing. So please consider uploading AVI files if possible, if not thanks anyways."
