,dodsy2008,2012-03-16T15:55Z,@sceneline....It is such a shame U only upload MP4's (as apposed to AVI's which actually register with My TV-adapter).

I know it's a shame as my DVD player won't play MP4's either but what we gonna do. It is free after all.
I use MP4Cam2Avi to convert them it's free, easy and quality remains good.

Once you run it use the following optionson the right hand side:
Action = Batch Convert
Video Format = Xvid MPEG-4 TV Standard 16:9
Audio Format=Lame MP3 High Quality

I've been using it for while to convert x264 MP4's.
Hope that helps"
