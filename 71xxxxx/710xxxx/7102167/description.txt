For those who dance tango argentino.


As FÃ©lix Picherna (argentine tango dj) says, you should start learning tango music by listening to recodrings of Carlos di Sarli orchestra.

So here is it: a set of cds gathered from several people.

Details: Some of cds are not complete because I removed files with ripping artifacts or because some songs were lost. All the albums have musicbrainz info in them (if MB database contained appropriate info), and BPM tags calculated by mixmeister (may be innacurate, but still can serve as a guide for compiling songs into tandas)
