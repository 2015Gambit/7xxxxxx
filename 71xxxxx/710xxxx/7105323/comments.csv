GAMEPLAY:
Like its predecessor, Two Worlds II is a real-time role-playing game that takes place in an open non-linear fantasy world where players take the role of a single character with whom they can explore and undertake quests. From the beginning players can lightly customize the appearance of the protagonist such as shape of face and body, and skin colour. As is common in role-playing games, the player’s character will level up by gaining experience points through completion of quests and defeating enemies. Much of the in-game world can be fully explored from the beginning, regardless of how much the player has progressed through the main story arc. Despite being non-linear, many areas of the land are populated by strong foes with higher levels than that of the player initially and as a result, players may want to explore them once their character has improved. While players will travel across much of the landscape on foot, they are soon given the option to ride on horseback and even later, a chance to man the helm of a boat to sail across the seas between islands. In addition players can also fast travel using magical teleportation fixtures found across the map.
From the beginning of the single-player game, all players' characters begin at the base level. Rather than having players choose a character’s class and style of play, as they level up points are given to be spent on improving their four main stats; endurance (health and damage), strength (combat), accuracy (ranged), and willpower (magic) while also unlocking and improving various other skills and abilities such as forging items, special combat moves, sneaking, spells and others. Players can also mix skills instead of focusing on one type of character build.
Materials can be gathered throughout the game world, either found in the wild, purchased from vendors, looted from fallen enemies or recovered from unneeded equipment. Whilst some materials can be used in the forging/upgrading of weaponry and armor, others can be used in the creation of lethal devices such as traps or bombs. Many others however are ingredients for potions that can be brewed by the player themself. These mixtures can either be used to recover a player's health or magical reserve, to temporarily buff their skills or attributes, or to use against foes as poisons. Due to the large amount of outcomes, players can name and document their new creations.

EXPANSION PACK:
The Two Worlds 2 Expansion pack, Pirates of the Flying Fortress, was released in September 2011. It features new animations, new recorded dialog, customization options, and new map area with a 10 hour campaign. It will also include 4 new multiplayer maps."

,rolosdad,2012-03-16T13:09Z,"ok thanks mate, will give it a try."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-03-16T18:55Z,np. i think the problem with other torrents is ppl forget to or just dont block the exe files from accessing the internet. i might be wrong though. either way this works just fine. i havent had and troubles of needing to re-enter serial codes every chapter. only time i had to re-enter a serial was after installing the patch but the first keygen i used on the game didnt work so i had to get 1 that did work with the patch.
,EdensAria,2012-03-22T12:27Z,"Will i be able to play lan through multiplayer?
And do you also have the keygen for the patch?
if so thanks"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-03-22T21:21Z,"keygen for the patch is included in torrent. playing lan, u should be able to but im unsure."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-03-22T21:22Z,actually i didnt even know this had multiplayer
,mayor,2012-03-29T22:16Z,"Am I the only have issues with the keygen? The access code I get from the keygen is invalid. Could someone describe in detail since I´m probably doing something wrong. And yes, I´m following the instructions. ""then use the keygen fix
generate a key and type it in
then the game asks to activate by internet or phone, choose phone
will give you a code, type that into the keygen and press verify
now use the verify code."""
,hansiboy999,2012-04-14T14:32Z,"Ok... THIS IS BREAKING MY BALLS! I thought i had finally found a torrent that worked, but when I got to the end of chapter 2 and was about to start chapter 3 IT ASKED ME FOR A SERIAL NUMBER! The one I used when I installed the game doesn't provide the required level of access apparently... please, PLEASE help me, i love this game and I refuse to give up on it again (I tried it last year with extremezone's torrent). Did I do anything wrong? It appeared to have been installed correctly and I removed everything in the Windows Firewall list named Two Worlds II. I skipped the last two steps in your instructions because it looked to be properly licensed finally and I didn't want to test my luck... again PLEASE HELP ME!"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-04-26T11:34Z,"need to block it from accessing the internet, not allow it....... BLOCK IT from accessing the internet, that is most ppl's problem. BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK BLOCK. then....BLOCK some more. block the main exe file/s from being able to access the internet, windows firewall works just fine.

i have installed my own torrent using my own instructions and have no problems at all. though i noticed i forgot to paste the first set of serials for the non patched game, they are still located in a different txt file in the torrent."
,s_millar7,2012-04-26T18:31Z,Had some trouble with the extraction but once it happened my antivirus found a trojan.gen.2 is it just me or does this have a virus?!?!?!
,hansiboy999,2012-04-26T19:52Z,"I did that... I blocked it the hell of Windows Firewall, but I got the message anyway..."
,Evil-Phoenix,2012-05-04T14:41Z,All patches included ?
,Evil-Phoenix,2012-05-06T14:47Z,I blocked TwoWorlds2.exe adn DX10.exe but after i finished prologue game wants serial number.
,Evil-Phoenix,2012-05-06T21:15Z,"I will appreciate if someone one will upload this game that is already patched,installed and have reg files (game path and serial numbers).In that case we wont have to activate game."
