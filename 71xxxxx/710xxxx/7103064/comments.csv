 Actually, depending on what country you live in or who your ISP is, some people have to pay extra for different sized bandwidth packages.

 What's worse is if you go over the limit you get slowed down to a crawl and/or pay an overcharge fee for going over..

 Be glad we don't have to pay for our bandwidth useage yet, but sooner or later i'm betting we will."
