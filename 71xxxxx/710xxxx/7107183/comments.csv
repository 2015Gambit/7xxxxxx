,googleLT,2012-03-16T14:48Z,HeroMaster we need now wait for crack?
,XXSEED,2012-03-16T15:04Z,"Thanks for the upload.

One question: You guys will be doing a crack for this game before its release date or after ?.

Thanks !"
,.l.l.l.l.,2012-03-16T15:18Z,after the release buddy....
,GObonzo,2012-03-16T15:28Z,"who's ""you guys""?"
,mariodz,2012-03-16T16:07Z,french ???
,.l.l.l.l.,2012-03-16T16:20Z,"the ""you guys"" surely refers to skidrow reloaded 3dm theta fightclub .......etc etc scene groups......"
,googleLT,2012-03-16T16:23Z,aaaa
,booobp,2012-03-16T17:07Z,How can this game be cracked if it's online play only.
,macfly59,2012-03-16T17:28Z,multilanguage or only us ??
,Ykalondr,2012-03-16T17:33Z,Someone is gonna make a private server for it is my guess.
,ripture,2012-03-16T17:34Z,"@booobp

You need server-emulating software.  The same way you need to play unofficial World of Warcraft servers."
[T],rlf-rls,2012-03-16T18:54Z,Wait for scene! Nice Hero :) 
,godziothc,2012-03-17T05:52Z,"Yea and even now we dont have 100% functional WOW PS's. For SWTOR we still need to wait a year or two for the first servers to pop up...

My advice? Don't get your hopes up too high"
,gears3rocks,2012-03-17T10:54Z,"@godziothc there is a fully fuunctional Wow ,its Called Molten wow ,Look It Up on Google Its Amazing and as The Best Servers"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-03-17T11:55Z,"There will be a scene release soon enough, patience is a virtue."
,Derileec,2012-03-17T12:50Z,http://www.skidrow-scene.net/?p=2529
,godziothc,2012-03-17T14:22Z,"@gears3rocks

well i went ahead and checked and it's not 100% functional (a few dungeons are still undergoing development, there is a problem with a few quests etc.) It's of course playable and you can still enjoy the game fully but i just said it as an example. How long has WOW been around and how long we were doing w/o ANY private servers at all. Just look the ""PS's"" for Diablo 3 Beta (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7099267/Diablo_3_BETA_Build_8610_client_server - no BitMiner Here) they're around for a while now, and the only thing you can do is walk around make a few quests, kill a few mobs.

Again, i just want the people waiting for ""crack"" to realize it's not going to be here any time soon.

PS and let's not talk about wow anymore it's a d3 torrent dont want to start a pre-adolescence war, tpb servers might not take the impact :)"
,ovnoglavi,2012-03-17T16:34Z,"I guess that a big THANK YOU is in order... HA HA HA, my god, how will I wait til may?!?! Thanx HeroMaster... At least I wont have to search for a working torrent when the game comes out...just the crack (no matter which group will create it)!!!"
,pimpmobile,2012-03-17T21:09Z,"Man this is bullshit Blizzard its official your a piece of shit company now!  You took a cool game like diablo and turned it into a shit game that only can play online like world of warcraft!  I know the nerds who like WoW will love this, but as for people who dont want to play with people they dont know this is shit!"
,123qwertz,2012-03-18T01:17Z,"Soooooooo... 

let's say I am a linux user and I am totally willing to pay for this game in full, and I have no problem having internet connection for just singleplayer campaign...  I am assuming it will still be necessary to pirate the game in order to defeat some of the more basic copy protection so that the game will run on linux? and then I can just enter license key and play legit?

In light of that I would like to see a torrent of just the ""post-install"" files so that I can just run the game without having to install it (i've read from some reviews that the installer won't run under wine but the game will once installed on a windows partition)."
,boyzandoi92,2012-03-18T03:31Z,"I'm downloading...I want ask U a Ques, This setup is full version of Diablo III?"
,googleLT,2012-03-18T06:03Z,please seed wery slow for me :(
,googleLT,2012-03-18T17:48Z,how install this game? i need change my time zone or date? or what?
,baluka555,2012-03-25T12:04Z,"dont download it, its a fucking hacker program inside the installer!!!"
,stangerbr,2012-03-26T01:57Z,"Is thsi the same as Diablo3 PCDVD from webchella, if nope, maybe i should download his version, right?"
,Puppeh,2012-04-01T17:58Z,so the single player is online and they are gonna make a crack for this ?this isn't like SC2 offline mode you will only be able to play this game with internet connection like was WoW so i hope there are gonna be private servers for this game too
,narmishe,2012-04-01T18:33Z,"@Puppeh, yes even the single player mode syncs with bliz servers, yes u need a stable internet connection to play this, it sucks big time, even if your purchased retail game from bliz u need the internet to play, the worst part is if ur net goes down u loose ur progress to the check point, but u some how have the experience and loot u collected. and the crack might take a month or so after its release not quite sure about it."
,djnero,2012-04-05T00:04Z,f me these days you dont even know if the protection that comes with it is going to let you play the dam thing anyway yet you still pre order like some addict fool
,Doremonhg,2012-04-12T07:06Z,"It's 2012 and there are still a lot of dumbasses out there. They keep the game data in blizz's servers, so say goodbye with the fucking crack, and imagine that you are playing a fucking online game for christ's sake. Only way to play this fucking game for free is wait for a fucking stable private server you dumbfuck"
,Doremonhg,2012-04-12T07:07Z,"And it will take months, even years, for the fucking private server to be stable and playable, so STFU about play this game for free and stuff..."
,ventehxieteh,2012-05-10T08:50Z,"true, you can't play this game. the mechanics of the game are done server side. like MMOs so some one needs to reverse engineer the server or replicate it which i think is very hard to do, so kudos to blizzard for coming up with that mechanic so there is no way to play the game(for who knows how long look at WoW still no good private server to date) but to buy it from blizzard "
,Dufox,2012-05-15T17:23Z,"@baluka555

your an idiot.

@Doremonhg
there is no such thing as single player and uncrackable being in the same sentence todate.
if blizzard has found a way then my hats off to them but i highly doubt it can be done.

p.s i love the irony of you calling people dumbasses."
,htorbov,2012-05-15T19:28Z,"There will be no crack - it's online, like WoW. Just someone needs to make a private server or a server emulator (like mooege.com, but for the full version)."
,_Menace_,2012-05-16T19:24Z,"they could release the crack, they could, but i guess they're having too much fun getting abnormal traffic through their websites"
,_Menace_,2012-05-16T19:35Z,"HAHAHAHAHA, please"
,_Menace_,2012-05-16T19:36Z,"and oh yeah, its giving me an error when i install after i accept and all that jazz"
,bravo2011,2012-05-16T22:27Z,"I went out and bought this it's worth it. Also Blizzard set this game up to work in single player only if the game is connected to Battlenet. Battlenet stores all your items and weapons on thier servers, Meaning the game will never work unless you are connected to thier servers ONLY. Paying customers couldnt play single player when the servers were shut down last night. Sorry , but if you want to play to have to pay for this one. There's no cracks and there will never be one, Blizzard designed it that way this time."

,raiden92,2012-05-27T19:23Z,@HeroMaSTER I previously downloaded Walking Dead the Video Game and it worked perfectly. Now I am just wondering since this was uploaded March 16 2012 is it the full version or is it some kind of beta with issues . This was released last week so I was wondering if this is legit full game with all the  updates . Keep up the great work dude :)
,raiden92,2012-05-27T19:34Z,@HeroMaSTER I heard that Battle-net is private server so how is it suppose to work?
,tflagger997,2012-05-28T00:58Z,"No, there are no Cracks or Emulators that work with D3.
No private server, no access to Battle.net unless you actually buy a serial for it.

Everyone on YouTube is lying about having one, and most of the major crackers are not even looking into getting it working. What is really pathetic, is they will not even let their faithful fans know that they are not working on it.

So posting these things, and saying 'wait for a crack' is a scam. There may be an emulator eventually (6-12 months) but no time soon (unless YOU hack the Blizzard servers and get the other 2GB of assets they withheld). This is nothing more than a 8GB waste of time right now. "
,axinte,2012-07-01T15:41Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
