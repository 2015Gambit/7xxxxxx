,hawk-eye1,2012-03-16T14:46Z,"Hi Sujaidr.

I love your BR rips, they are A1 class.  Bro, can you please recommend the blu-ray ripper software you always refer to as 'scOrp'?  Can you please elaborate on this program, so I can source it over the net, perhaps a link would point me in the right direction ?  

Many thanks once again mate.  Thnx ! "
,abj642,2012-03-16T17:16Z,"@hawk-eye1
scOrp is not a software. he/they encode movies in a small size but with excellent quality"
,hawk-eye1,2012-03-16T23:45Z,"So which program does 'sijaidr' use to actually rip blu-rays ?  I have a collection of 100+ blu-rays, but don't know which program out there gives the best rip, ideally I'd like the program rips down to less than 1GB, in 720p.  Any suggestions ?  Thnx guys"

,stan1408,2012-03-17T09:22Z,hawk-eye1 he's using program called HandBrake
,hawk-eye1,2012-03-17T10:30Z,"Thank you 'Stan1408'

I've just begun using 'Handbrake', handbrake does not actually 'rip' the file, it only 'converts' files to either 'MKV' or 'MP4'.  The file needs to be ripped by another program, I've been recommended to use 'Make MKV' to rip the file first, then I use 'Handbrake' to strip the file down further.  I'd be keen to know if others use 'Make MKV' or maybe something better .  Am open to suggestions from anyone .."
