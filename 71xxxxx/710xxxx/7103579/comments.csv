,saint84,2012-03-15T10:40Z,"this is not a hdrip. why say that. high def , no. encoded in x264 does not make a high definition"
,DjengisKing,2012-03-15T19:19Z,"thanks for this..

BTW, any chance of a ""Oslo, August 31st"" upload? Can't find it for download, although I know it can be streamed somewhere on the net. "
,michaelrwatson,2012-03-19T20:53Z,"Very watchable copy with hardcoded Engl subs for the Russian parts. However, something is wrong w/ the framerate--it stutters noticeably in many scenes. Either the framerate was changed (never a good idea) or there's an IVTC issue, but it doesn't really matter. It's not like this is a good movie."
