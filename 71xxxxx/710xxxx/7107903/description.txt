Synopsis

Jack and his pals are in a bit of a rut.
They've spent 2 decades chasing women and fleeing commitment.
They're not quite alcoholic -- more like "alcohol-ish".


Jack is about to turn 40, and he's starting to see hidden messages in everyday street signs.


Snedden's goal in life is to f@#% his way through the alphabet.

Price is 1 drink away from a total meltdown.

Victor is a "fretrosexual" -- he never has sex, just worries about it.

When a long-lost friend pops up with his beautiful fiance, the result is a whirl of death, sex and booze and Jack realizes he may finally be ready to commit...to the one woman hopelessly out of reach.
