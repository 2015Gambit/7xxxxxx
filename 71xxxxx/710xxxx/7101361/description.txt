The reissue combines two live albums, 1967's Forest Flower: Charles Lloyd at Monterey and 1969's Soundtrack on one CD. The earlier release was one of the few jazz albums to sell a million copies, and it owed its popularity not only to its suggestions of bohemian romanticism but also to the strength of Lloyd's writing and to the empathic interplay between the leader and his then-unknown bandmates, pianist Keith Jarrett and drummer Jack DeJohnette. The three recorded the very similar Soundtrack two years later. --Geoffrey Himes
