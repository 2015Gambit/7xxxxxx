,Dlurker,2012-04-07T07:57Z,"Thank you for this.

Just install it(8.6GB) and it's working very well. This include IE9 and .Net Framework 4 and only 2 update not install (Windows Defender definition and KB971033) :D

With this version, i will definitely use it for the rest of 2012.

P.S More elaborated nfo file
lol it was a good guess DL this one, no regret"
,atzensuisse,2012-08-26T14:03Z,"Many thanks for this..the comments by other down loaders sound positive..fact that it doesn't install Windows Defender definition and KB971033 makes it all the more appealing. Reactivation shouldn't be a prob using Daz's activator, which works like a bomb! cheers!!!!"
