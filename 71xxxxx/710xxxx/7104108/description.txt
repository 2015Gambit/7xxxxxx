The Equatics - Doin It!!!! 1972 [2010] [Album]

"The stories of great high school funk bands are, thanks to an abundance of reissues, commonplace. The tales of great high school soul-bands are still rare. A ballad or two on the random Douglass High School Stage Band album or Timeless LegendΓÇÖs mesmerizing entry on ColumbusΓÇÖs 1972 1st Annual Inner City Talent Expo notwithstanding, high school bands rarely struck into the realm of ΓÇ£grown folksΓÇ¥ music. Enter The Equatics and their brooding masterpiece DoinΓÇÖ It!!!!

If this is categorized as a ΓÇ£funkΓÇ¥ album ΓÇô and it was for the last ten years, by those few lucky enough to own an original copy ΓÇô it holds its own. But it was as a soul band ΓÇô one as inspired by the melancholic musings of Bill Withers as the psychedelic-pop of the self-proclaimed ΓÇ£Black Moses,ΓÇ¥ Issac Hayes ΓÇô that the Equatics shone. These young souls offered world-weary, beat-heavy ballads that stand on par with any of the great independent organizations of the early 1970s. That a group of teenagers could offer such an angst-ridden plea as that of Leo DavisΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Merry Go RoundΓÇ¥ not only transcends the limitations that came from the bandΓÇÖs average age (seventeen, at the time of the albumΓÇÖs recording), but also the barriers the stood in front of this group of small-city hopefuls."
