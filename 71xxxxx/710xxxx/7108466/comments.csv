,masterpiece007,2012-03-18T19:59Z,I wonder despite having more than 200 seeders why is this torrent so slow with great variations in speed? Can anyone give a proper answer. I'd be very thankful.

,xny675,2012-03-26T07:47Z,3 hrs in 2GB and you still call it HD?  A SD rip at this bitrate would look better.
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-03-28T20:09Z,"Not the best quality. Some of YIFY's smaller sized 720p movies have looked better. This one disappointed, actually."
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-03-28T20:12Z,I'll wait for a proper BRrip. I hear it's (the bluray) being released in April... the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the ship.
,TitsMcGee7,2012-04-07T09:59Z,the 3d movie came out to theaters today. Cant wait to DL it haha. F paying for it on the big screen!
,dr.asad,2012-04-08T07:39Z,"can u pls upload the file, Dr. Najeeb medical video lecture in half of it's size. current file is 95GB."
,Jookycola,2012-04-12T11:26Z,NOT an HD version of the movie.  This is an SD version (Probably from the last remastered DVD)  Looks great for a SD-DVD.  But I just want people out there looking for a true BD/HD version to know this is not it.  But easily the best copy available right now.
,JrSlash7,2012-04-14T20:17Z,"why didnt i found u before??

,pore_wall,2012-05-18T03:18Z,"Video Quality is great, Audio is just 2.0 Stereo, but I think the new version is re mastered.. it seems like this is real old version.. "

Aw, man! Did you have to spoil it? The ship sinks?  haha!"

,Hitlerism,2012-08-31T16:22Z,"Hey there, YIFY dude, this is not the Blu-Ray version! This is just an upscaled HDTV version! Come on, the Blu-Ray version will be released in a week, and usually you've already uploaded it by now!"

Horrible rip for a 1080p BluRay. Mega pixels, awful colors.. It's like watching a 480p Youtube video."
