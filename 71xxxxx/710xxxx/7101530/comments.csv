I will seed for a couple of weeks."
,[Z],2012-03-14T23:42Z,good torrent thanks. Time to seed!
,kipenz,2012-03-16T03:14Z,"Ehh, I'd still like to just see them from you if not just to preserve the filename syntax.

""YP-7Z-02x20"" is.. well.. yeah."
,Jack-Purcell,2012-03-16T04:27Z,thx!!!
,dawo5010,2012-03-16T07:40Z,"I know it isn't possible, but filename... sigh."
,PHR16384,2012-03-16T18:46Z,"Oh yeah, the filename.  Allow me to clarify.  *clears throat*

********
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT ""NEW"" FILENAME:
********

The filename is like that because this torrent is copied from YayPonies, and not made by me.  I have no control over their file naming scheme.  (And no, I don't like their naming scheme either.)

ZR is now uploading all his/her colour-corrected MKVs to YayPonies, and they're making their own torrents out those files.  My own version of these torrents, at this point, would be the same MKV file, byte-for-byte, plus an info blurb in the form of a text file.

Both YayPonies and I agreed that it would be better for everyone if I posted their torrents here.  They put their torrents up faster than I can, and can seed at a better rate than I can by myself.

By doing this, we'll merge the peer swarms from YP and TPB.  You guys over here at TPB will get faster downloads in the beginning.  And for EVERYONE's benefit, the torrent will have more seeds over time and accumulate them faster.

Comprendo, se単ores?"
,kipenz,2012-03-17T03:48Z,"Yeah I think we understand. Could you write out what the filename would have been under the old syntax for these newer uploads in the summery field or something though?

I really am this lazy :["
