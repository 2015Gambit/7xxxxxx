If you can throw believability out the window and just enjoy, it's a heck of a good film

Storyline

Chris Hunter is a sly newsreel reporter. While in Shanghai doing reports on the Chinese-Japanese war, he meets pilot Alma Harding. At first she doesn't trust him, but by a trick he manages to get her hired as his assistant. During an adventurous expedition through the jungles of South America he manages to change her view of him. 

The special effects from the time era are so bad they are really fun to watch
