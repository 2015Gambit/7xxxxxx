,DC-Pirate,2012-04-01T17:37Z,"Download works fine, seems clean but crashes after 5 minutes of play. "
,Bopkinz,2012-04-04T20:09Z,"It closes after 5 mins or so...
When i downloaded the towns demo it closed after 5 mins (20 in-game days)
This leads me to think thats this torrent is the demo version but what would be the point? 0.o"
,FireFtw,2012-04-05T20:50Z,"@Bopkinz
Nope, this is the full version. If you keep crashing then my guess is one of your programs is out of date. "
,Threebob,2012-04-07T13:46Z,"Hey FireFtw,

Thanks! I loved the demo, and i wanna fully try it out before i buy it! i haven't properly started playing this, but i have done a full scan of it and there are no viruses, and this isn't the demo. if it was there would be a little notification at the bottom right.
Happy Playing Guys!"

What out of date program(s) would cause the closes?"
,FireFtw,2012-04-28T00:46Z,"v0.45 is out!

,seldon131,2012-05-03T06:17Z,"Actually the release of 0.45 is why I'm here, I bought the game to help support its development, but the new patch basically breaks dungeon crawling, and there appears to be no way to downgrade. After searching and even asking on the official forums, I'm snagging this, something I could have done right off, but damn I felt like I should at least try. So feel free to try 0.45, but be ready to head back here, there is a ton of cool stuff, some very cool, but with basically no dungeon exploring, it kind of stops the thing I got a kick out of most. Well that and editing the files in the /data folder to change stats on things, can make some fun odd setups. And now I've written a huge comment on a probably not that busy torrent, go insomnia."
,ChezTehL33T,2012-05-17T10:06Z,"For those of you wondering why it closes after 5-10mins, it's because Towns is not compatible with AMD graphics. There no patch or fix for this. So either so don't play it or save a lot."
