@pirateradiorocks2 Yeah, I dunno what to make of that exec. order. It's totally unnecessary in defense terms, contraindicated for a free society, and the perfect fodder for conspiracy theorists. Some nice such theorizing on this order can be found in the No Agenda Show #392.

My conspiracy theory...it's part of a long-term quiet alignment of ""dominoes"" of federal power poised to be tipped over to give justification to heavy-handed action against the people should ever an insurrection start."
