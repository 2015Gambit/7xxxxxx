Lyrics --->



i wanna be bigger, bigger than the fame,
 bigger than the lights, bigger than the money
 out on the stage
 i wanna be bigger, bigger than it all,
 bigger than the glory, so i could never fall,
 bigger than the sky, bigger than the clouds,
 we never coming down
 
i'ma, bit bigger like david taking goliath
 just trying to get my voice steady screaming out through the silence
 this industry makes me resort to violence
 'cause i've been kicked around too long, stuck these vice grips
 plus, when nobody supports you, they pirate
 so there's no money left to make the next of my hits
 other rappers ignoring me, now on my list
 'cause i've been keeping track of the dust left on my kicks
 ugh, and ya'll are bound to see
 i'm out to be much bigger than all those surrounding me
 while you're dreaming of stars, i reach for galaxies
 if you're doubting me, keep on, i'm bound to be
 
 ii wanna be bigger, bigger than the fame,
 bigger than the lights, bigger than the money
 out on the stage
 i wanna be bigger, bigger than it all,
 bigger than the glory, so i could never fall,
 bigger than the sky, bigger than the clouds,
 we never coming down
 (i'mma be bigger, yeah
 say i'mma be bigger, cool!)
 oh, ah oh, oh ah oh
 
so big, these haters here must stop
 'cause you talk a big game, but i learn to trust not
 been doing it long enough and i've had enough stops
 so i'll do it 'till i make it or until my lungs pop
 here so watch out, until i grow old and i'm a wash out
 i'mma be the biggest thing shining, so pull your watch out
 forget a platinum record, i'm bigger than first or second
 i'm larger than premadonna's, all you snakes and anaconda's
 not finished with my sentence, no period, put a comma
 this thing is running on, my message just getting longer
 there's a sauna burning up, with this world against me
 i'mma be the biggest thing that you ever did see
