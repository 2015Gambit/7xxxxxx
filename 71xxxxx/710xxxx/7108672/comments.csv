,ArpeggioCsharp,2012-03-17T05:35Z,"This upload is really Harry's Law s02e14 Les Horribles which aired on Global tonight.

The episode number is not right.   Harry's Law s02e15 with an episode title of ""Search and Seize"" is not scheduled to be aired until 23 March 2012 on Global(Canada) and 25 March 2012 on NBC.  This file ""Harry's Law S02E15 HDTV XviD-2HD"" for DLing REALLY is Harry's Law s02e14 Les Horribles that aired between 9and10PM ET on Global(Canada) tonight?

It's possible 2HD re-encoded some one else's Harrys' Law s02e14 file into an Xvid avi and mislabeled the re-encoded file as  Harry's Law s02e15"
,dumbasstheives,2012-03-17T06:46Z,"It's been dirfixed to the correct S02E14.
"
,dumbasstheives,2012-03-17T06:47Z,"And no, 2HD aren't reencoders. They are a reputable scene group. 3ELTON is a reencoder of Dimension. See their Supernatural release. "
