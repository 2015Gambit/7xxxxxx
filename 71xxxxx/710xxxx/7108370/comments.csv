Even on the best hi-fi system in the world, you are not gaining anything by going above 320 bit rate downloads. Loss-less with 320 bit rate means you have the entirety of the music data, as in all of it! 

If you go above 320 bit rate, the audio cannot possibly sound any better, but you will have huge files on your computer. Radio studio quality is 256 bit rate and you would have to have the most expensive hi-fis in the world, a properly set up sound room to listen to the music and exceptional hearing to notice anything above 256 bit rate if played back through a quality amp and decent speakers!"
