Historian Dan Snow charts the defining role the Royal Navy played in BritainΓÇÖs struggle for modernity ΓÇô a grand tale of the twists and turns which thrust the people of the British Isles into an indelible relationship with the sea and ships.

At sea and on land, Snow shows how the Navy became an indispensable tool of state, weaving the stories of characters like Drake, GodΓÇÖs Republican warrior at sea Robert Blake, and Samuel Pepys, administrator par excellence, who laid the foundations for BritainΓÇÖs modern civil service.

With access to the modern Navy and reconstructed ships of the time, Snow recounts the NavyΓÇÖs metamorphosis from a rabble of West Country freebooters to possibly the most complex industrial enterprise on earth.
