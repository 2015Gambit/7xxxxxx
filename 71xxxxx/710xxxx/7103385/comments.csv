As before, the file size of the game is huge. Please be patient."
,aceman2010,2012-03-15T05:20Z,"is this one going to work.
you really let me down last time"
[T],Totenkruez,2012-03-15T18:56Z,"@aceman2010:
You are aware of the ""Uploader's Note"" I wrote in the previous FF13-2 upload, right?

In case it was too subtle...

At the time of this upload (2012-03-15), there is no known way to play this. You can download the game now and hold onto it until such a method is available. Or you can just pass on downloading this.

Hope that clears up any misunderstandings."
