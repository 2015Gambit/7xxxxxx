,slicedt,2012-03-14T01:11Z,any reason you uploaded twice?
,MnrBurger,2012-03-14T06:02Z,"If you are going to upload the same thing twice, then at least do all of us who watch this on our TV sets via DivX DVD players, to have it in avi format.  WTF is with the mp4 formats that will only work on my PC?

So now I have to waste time converting this cheesy mp4 it to avi, and lose some quality in the process.  That sucks twice!"
