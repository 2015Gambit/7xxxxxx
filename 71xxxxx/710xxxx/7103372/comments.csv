,Shaneth21,2012-03-15T21:05Z,"You classify the language as English, however I am most certain that this game is only Japanese voices, just that the text is in English. Can you clarify?"
,omegaviper,2012-03-16T00:51Z,"@KingNico I am not ungrateful if you were not dumb you would know that the scene almost always gets releases on the net on time if not early so this is strange that it is this late.

@Shaneth21 I have a link that goes to gamefaqs with the release inff that anyone can google themselves I am implying that you are really dumb and this game was released in usa in English voices."
,lord_killa,2012-03-16T15:46Z,"@omegaviper abgx.net says CLANDESTiNE released the game on 15-6-2011, usually when release groups ripps things and releases them it is all happening in big servers they share around the world, now for ppl that use piratebay and other p2p networks, the release have to be leaked from those servers by someone so we can download it from a chosen p2p service. The delay between the scene release date and a torrent on piratebay can only be shortened by the users of piratebay."
,KingNico,2012-03-16T16:48Z,"@omegaviper

a simple google and you wouldve found this game online, it wasnt on TPB but it was on the net.  "
,Shaneth21,2012-03-21T18:45Z,"@omegaviper Actually you are dumb because I have researched everywhere on google and YouTube and GameFAQs answers and there are no English voices.
