,tarzanscousin,2012-03-23T05:02Z,Great quality but the profanity is edited/censored. 
,t0lkien,2012-04-01T12:11Z,"Good quality but why is this censored? You even cut the bit where he cuts up the kid's jacket in NY? What the? ""Shit"" is too much profanity? The censorship makes this pretty useless, sorry. For anyone wanting a decent copy of this movie, don't waste your time on this. Go to the other 720p version."

,AMV4CBN8M,2012-04-11T11:34Z,"The 1st movie in this torrent is the censored 93 minute ""international"" version. The word ""shit"" is way too offensive for the masses. Well, fuck that!

Does anyone know were I could find a torrent for the uncensored (104 minute) ""Australian"" version? So far all the ones i can find on TPB have the censored version. Thanks folks."
