,OmniNegro,2012-03-15T23:12Z,"I think you are missing the point. It downloads executables. Have you scanned them too?

By the time you have downloaded them, you may already be infected. It all depends upon how this thing is setup to work.

And as everyone *Should* know, just because a virus scanner says it does not detect a virus, that in no way means it does not include one. 

Take a virus and change any one bit and it no longer looks like a virus to those scanners. They can only detect KNOWN malware.

This may be legitimate, but why post an exe to download something when you can just make a torrent with the content it would deliver through it's unspecified method?

I say again, I think this is a trojan. I c an think of no real reason to justify it's use on a *Torrent* site. Torrents that link to other download methods are always to be suspected.

Sorry if I am wrong. I hope I really am. Good day to everyone."

,GenieHakeem,2012-04-26T06:06Z,"So we must still buy the game, if I am understanding this correctly. 
You basically get the client and have to unlock it with a purchase."
,mistsin,2012-04-30T21:19Z,please seed this torrent
,PyroTheGreat,2012-05-01T19:40Z,"Sure you should buy the game you fool. 
If you preorder it, you get the link to the official pre-load site. Then you download the installer and you just need to wait for your key. "
,Ykalondr,2012-05-02T21:02Z,"Not gonna say it will be impossible but it will be VERY, VERY HARD to crack Diablo 3. If you haven't pre-ordered or are not gonna buy the game, don't bother with this download. Diablo 3 requires you to be connected to Battle.net while playing so someone will need to create a fake battle.net server for us to connect to."
,axinte,2012-07-01T14:12Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
