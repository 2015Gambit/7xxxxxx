,comestaiii,2012-03-14T16:54Z,"...........if it is so bad quality of the movie so why you even watch the movie. secondly, it is free. and if you know the language, so it should not be a problem. what do you want subtitles for if you complain about the movie.................."
,themancminsh,2012-03-14T17:14Z,@comestaiii chink writing is fucking annoying and sounds like shit - you dont want to see that shit when you watch a movie - and this is a bad copy -grainy picture.. best to wait for better quality
,mbisdagame1,2012-03-14T18:01Z,"@comestaiii People are not complaining, they are voicing their opinion, which is a right all people have, and is greatly appreciated...you know nothing about such rights you filthy gook"
,lullaby99,2012-03-14T18:45Z,Quality numbers differ a lot. Could someone add something to the numbers already given?

,ya7hu,2012-03-14T19:36Z,"better than any TS out there, but decided to wait for BDrip DVDRip"
,spifkitten99,2012-03-14T19:52Z,"comestaiii, 

That it's free has ZERO relevance. If the quality is shit, we need to appreciate that people tell us, so we don't have to waste time finding out ourselves.

People giving their opinion about the rip (meaning quality of video/audio/subs/etc), is what the comments are for.

I don't care to hear what people think about the movie itself though. That I'll go to imdb for. But it doesn't hurt anyone that the info is there."
,aapb,2012-03-14T20:24Z,"read comments, dl aborted. cheers"
,mrfactsright,2012-03-14T21:19Z,"UTTER SHITE, WASTE OF TIME!"
,eatglass,2012-03-14T21:35Z,"mbisdagame1 people are complaining and making unneeded racist comments ""chink writing is fucking annoying"" - themancminsh.

That isn't what freedom of speech is about. 

Standards for rips are higher now with HD. Pre-internet days back when VHS existed, you would find copies like this were the standard.

Thing is, people don't need to bitch and make racist comments. "

,Papa17,2012-03-15T20:22Z,Can someone tell me why my Bittorrent has recently changed... Tried to download this movie but when the popup for Bit Torrent comes up it no longer shows me the files within it that will be downloaded....help?
,TheAsset,2012-03-16T01:26Z,"there is a version out that has english subs for the non-english parts.
i DL it from Demonoid last night coz i couldn't find it on PB.
that aside, i can't believe ppl think this is a good movie."
,spirit.in.exile,2012-03-16T01:49Z,"Papa17: Reason is that PB has uses all magnet links now, rather than hosting actual .torrent files. Using the magnet link method for download, you can no longer select individual files/folders from within the upload (as with uTorrent with a standard .torrent file download). This is inconvenient for some. But from what I've read, dropping .torrent file hosting significantly reduces the size of the site, so that it's less of a burden on the host(s)... and highly portable/restorable in the event that the site has issues or must switch hosts. PB going down over-long would be far more inconvenient to me, personally, so I'm cool with it."
,mglushed,2012-03-16T03:10Z,"the chinese subtitle is annoying, nice video/audio quality though"

,Rush,2012-03-17T00:01Z,"Just did a Convertxtodvd encode... and after playing the dvd on a home theater system the sound is not perfect but it sure the hell ain't all that bad. 

The picture, although grainy is very watchable... the Korean subs are annoying for about 10 min. and then you don't even notice em.  

Thanks to LegendET for all the hard work no matter what the disrespectful pukes say... If you can 't contribute  a better copy then shut the fuck up
