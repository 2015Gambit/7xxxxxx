St-Patrick's day is upon us. Typically we associate this Irish holiday with the color green, shamrocks, hedonistic celebration and of course, leprechauns. But on this St-Patrick's Day, we will meet a leprechaun who is not all about sing-a-long nor smiles. No. When Haley Young and a few of her fellow nurses at O'Sullivan's Mental Hospital for the Insane" encounter this feisty little bugger, asses get turned, peckers get slobbered and titties get twisted. Trust me girls and laddies, this leprechaun means business.
