,Shikalazy,2012-07-04T23:01Z,"So...I downloaded the iso no problem, mounted, and extracted it for the crack. Installed without too many problems. Everything installed. Put the Crack into the dir. And clicked it to play, and it came up with the same error i've had the past few times.
The program can't start because wxbase28u_vc_custom.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

I'm not new to torrenting, and usually i don't have a problem i can't solve on my own, or without previous comments...but seeings how no one has answered about this. i figured i'd ask. So.
Whats the fix guys? I made an account specifically for this issue. Thanks in advance. "
,TrueW0RDS,2012-08-09T15:36Z,"Good upload  + 1 

-When going in-game it will ask you to ""log in"" just skip the option and go in as no profile. The gameplay without a profile is no different from having one."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-17T06:37Z,"Lol at 1.6 GHz single core processor, this game doesn't even load up. But I assume it works, as well as I thought I would try. Wanted to see the lowest res. Thanks anyways! I can burn this and install on a better computer later. =)

Oh and @roumor2  Fuck you dude. EA is WAY better than plenty of other gaming companies out there. Especially Activision. Of course, every damn company has it's morons. They made another amazing game, and you basically say ""Fuck you"" to them? No, fuck you. This game is a wonderful game and they just gave Trapdoor a chance to make it. So screw you. You have NO idea what it takes to make a fucking video game, especially like this. 

Oh and @HeroMaster  I +1 this. =)"
