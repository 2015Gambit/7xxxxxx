You can do a clean installation this way:
- burn a DVD with the iso file you downloaded
- restart your PC and when ""boot from DVD drive"" appears on the screen press ENTER
- follow the indications and do NOT eject the DVD from the drive until ALL installation process ends
- Your HD will be wiped out and a partition alternatives will be offered to you.

Note: A Windows.old folder will be created on your HD containing all your old windows files. You can delete this folder if you need to save HD space. You will be warned to not delete some few old windows files. "

have you cx your computer boot system. make it first boot is cd/dvd rom. I'm sure that copy is
iso files. If iso, use magic iso or nero burning rom
to burn to cd in a speed of 4x. just to makesure that it wont missed a single files of the windows files."

last statement."
