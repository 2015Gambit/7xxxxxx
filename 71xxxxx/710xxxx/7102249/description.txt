UFOs Interview - Mar2012 - Project Camelot _ Twilight of the Old Boys Network (Retired, Cmd Sgt Major, Robert O. Dean & Sgt Clifford).web.xvid

The first thing to come from the UFO congress Conference an
side interview done by Kerry from Camelot Project who attended the
conference

Hear what 2 well known retired military men have to say on the subject
of UFOs , ETs and gov coverups on the subject

im sure theres more info on this..

your find I guess if search about

note the front is none studio quality and bad audio
once its a sit down in a room away from other background chat
and wearable mics its then more enjoyable

meantime best to tweak the audio using VLCs real time audio
EQ filters.. perhaps LIVE preset?

enjoy and HELP Seed.
