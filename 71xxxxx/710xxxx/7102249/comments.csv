preset made the first 20min better sound so could
listen to it.. beats me why the video makers didnt
do a better job and process the sound (like via soundforge) before creating the
video

thats the difference from handheld HD camcorders over
expensive studio camera :)"
[V],psspss,2012-03-16T03:02Z,"so hard to believe some of the things they say in these interviews

like the aliens eat the gold for immortality..

and walking around in the pentagon :)

some will call them crackpots or metally unstable im sure

but whats believable are the ufo crashes and retrieval stories
and different alien races visiting some friendly and some
non friendly and the goods ones disabling the nukes as
this has been said before by many people from different
areas and backgrounds

its a shame if its all real that we have the right to know
they exist and not told the story as it corrupted the fabric
of the world.. e,.g. silly religious believes :)"
