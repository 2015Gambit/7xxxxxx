Ray of Light is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on March 3, 
1998 by Maverick Records. After giving birth to her daughter Lourdes, Madonna collaborated with 
Patrick Leonard and William Orbit in developing the album. Following failed sessions with other 
producers, Madonna pursued a new musical direction with Orbit. The album is a pop and dance record, 
yet, it contains elements of electronic music within its composition, making it a departure from her 
previous work. Additionally, it incorporates several genres and subgenres, including techno, trip hop, 
drum and bass, ambient, rock and classical music. The album has several themes, including spirituality.

Upon release, the album received acclaim and was lauded by contemporary critics as a masterpiece. 
Reviewers commended the singer's new musical direction, calling it her "most adventurous" record, as 
well as its mature, restrained nature; the singer's vocals were also praised. Ray of Light won four 
Grammy Awards from a total of six nominations. Commercially, the album was a success, peaking at number 
one in numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. On the US 
Billboard 200, the album debuted and peaked at number two. Ray of Light has sold 20 million copies worldwide.
