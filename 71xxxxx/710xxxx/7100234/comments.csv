,ipodmonesta,2012-03-15T21:16Z,"this gonna sound stupid for some people, but what's cam? is t the same as DVD/TV/BR RIp?"
,mixdup1,2012-03-16T00:32Z,@ipodmonesta - Cam Means that it is a movie that is only out in theaters and that someone recorded it using a video camera. another one is R5 line which is slightly better than a cam where someone records of the output line in a porojector i beleive.
,TheDarkseid007,2012-03-18T03:17Z,"no, what they need to do is ban the spammer that post in these torrenta and after so many are reportsed, delete their fucking account, if they continue to make multiple accounts, then ban the ip. that will give us folks that actually post about the movie, instead of random spam links.

thanks for reading, and i'll comment once I get a chance to review the cam."
,kbrit,2012-03-18T21:05Z,The quality of this is horrible. Just plain awful.
,TheDarkseid007,2012-03-19T03:57Z,"Ok, reviewed the movie compared to 
Dr. Seuss The Lorax 2012 CAM Xvid-26k.

This is the same exact source, but yes I do have to say this is a little bit brighter looking and the audio is just a little better, so for the review for a cam rip on this compared to the 26k version, V:6 A:7 (Only reason better audio is the cleanup)

Folks just remember until it has been out for more than about 3-4 weeks, you won't find a decent rip for newest movies, you just either wait a few weeks before getting it or you can deal with what you get as a cam rip. Regardless nice work .bone."
,evath,2012-03-19T10:10Z,"I think Darkseid007 was altogether too kind.  most of these cam movies are pretty good (and, I know, what do you want for free)... but this one is terrible.  The opening minutes are like A & V: about 3.  Then the Video stays at 3, while the Audio jumps up to about 4.5 or 5.  I would wait for a better copy, unless you don't mind ruining your child's eyes."

,platano4567,2012-03-20T00:28Z,does anyone else have quality pleaseeeee
,FaptainAmerica,2012-03-20T23:57Z,"More like Dr. Seuss' The Low-res. There's someone talking the whole time in the theater, and certain parts get cut off (like right at the end of The Once-ler's ""How Bad Can I be?"")
I would wait for a better one to come out."
,chrisepsi33,2012-03-26T16:35Z,thanks

,phoenixnoname,2012-03-31T03:05Z,"audio & video is actually pretty good-however,there are pieces that are missing/skipped :("
,renisTPB,2012-04-08T16:24Z,when do you think the dvd rip will come out:D
,shipdog7,2012-05-07T22:16Z,"I don't know if you have this when you are at a theatre but an usher does his walk of the aisles at least 2 to 3 times during the movie looking for anyone using a cam corder. We always sit in the top row. I thought he was looking to see if we were ""misbehaving"". lol
I found this to be like looking through someone elses glasses. A little distorted. Wavy and blurry. "
