,ESS_fatal,2012-03-28T16:11Z,also remove the ad spammer from the installer I picked that up as soon as i lunched it kept on opening script errors on webpage from ads
,KM49,2012-03-30T06:21Z,Works... Kinda. I installed it but there's no way to switch to full version. Instructions would be very nice.
,failzone,2012-03-30T06:41Z,"The crack goes to the install dir.
Sorry"
,Hawk_Talk,2012-03-30T16:16Z,"Hey Just downloaded this, but cannot for the life of me find the install dir. any help would be greatly appreciated."
,failzone,2012-03-31T03:58Z,install dir is where you installed the program

You people need to learn how to crack something... "
,drazmain,2012-04-19T23:09Z,i still dont get at all how to crack it and get the plugins
,denbal87,2012-04-21T03:19Z,Don't download! I got stdrt.exe virus from this!!!
,xero11213,2012-04-21T22:05Z,"Gives you stdrt.exe when you install it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.

stdrt.exe is a rootkit virus that is extremely hard to get rid of, and downloads GBs of nothingness. It pretends to be Window's Media Center.

I repeat, do NOT download this torrent."
,failzone,2012-04-27T11:24Z,"All cracks have viruses usually. If you don't want viruses, buy the real one"
,sonicpunk32,2012-04-28T02:10Z,"After you've downloaded this, do not run ""FL10SETUP.exe"" no matter how legitimate it looks with it's Version tab info. I believe it's a trap.

If you have WinRAR, right click on the ""FL10SETUP.exe"" and select ""Open with WinRAR"" and you will it contains within it a file called ""FLSetup.exe"". Extract that into the folder of your choosing. Once again, DO NOT EXECUTE this one either. ""Open with WinRAR"" this file, and you'll see two files inside this one. One's called ""fl10inst.exe"" and another is called ""flaudit.exe"".

Extract ""fl10inst.exe"" and delete the other EXE files. That there is your real FL Studio setup file. I believe ""flaudit.exe"" is the stdrt.exe virus. This file ""flaudit.exe"" is self-extracted and run, along with ""fl10inst.exe"", when you execute the original ""FL10SETUP.exe"". It even has the Windows Media icon and says ""Windows Media Center Diagnostic Application"" in its Version description.

You can safely execute ""fl10inst.exe"" and install FL Studio. The files in the Crack folder work just fine for me."
,yotamdo,2012-04-29T16:22Z,"very quick download, thank you sonicpunk32 for your thoughtful advice, i removed a virus that norton wouldn't detect"
,WHOR3,2012-04-30T11:54Z,come on guise.. don't be idiots. we shouldn't have to worry about viruses on tpb. this is a good site. lets keep it that way.
,SpoogeBot,2012-05-09T21:27Z,"I'm sorry, but can someone help me with cracking this? The ""crack"" folder just has 2 folders, ""Artwork"" and ""Plugins,"" and a file FLEngine.dll - I copied and pasted these into the install dir, but I have a feeling there was supposed to be something else in there. Please help."
,zedin27,2012-05-13T09:37Z,Where the hell i find the intall.dir?
,zedin27,2012-05-14T00:21Z,"Never mind, i know what is install dir., but i have a question:
If i downloaded the FL Studio BEFORE puting the crack on the install dir., i got the Demo Version. If i put the Crack before the download, i get the full version?"
,EricWill,2012-05-14T08:57Z,"it installed correctly, but when I try to run the program, it says ""FL studio engine launcher has stopped working"" Any ideas?"
,joseer35,2012-05-14T18:08Z,"Shows as a .7z file, no idea what to do :/"

,Protomax1310,2012-07-27T01:27Z,"Here some instructions for people who have no idea what to do:

3: Launch the FlStudio application
4:install it
5: copy the files from the ""Cracked"" and paste them in the folder where you put the installation files from FlStudio
6: When asked, Replace the files
7: Enjoy and quit yo bitchen :P"

,Lamar154,2012-08-29T21:16Z,"Thank you sonicpunk32

After fallowing your steps
after I just went to the crack folder
copied and pasted those files into FL STUDIO folder found in program files, and replaced the files."
,htfissure,2012-09-22T22:31Z,"DO NOT INSTALL ""FL10SETUP.exe""!!! It will install the stdrt.exe virus!!! 

I got this before and wasn't sure where exactly it came from. Sure enough, it came from this torrent. Many of the other FL Studio torrents are the exact same thing, just with different titles. I had to reformat to get rid of it. Manual removal crashed my PC.

Follow sonicpunk32's advice on pages 1 in comments.

I will quote:
""After you've downloaded this, do not run ""FL10SETUP.exe"" no matter how legitimate it looks with it's Version tab info. I believe it's a trap.

If you have WinRAR, right click on the ""FL10SETUP.exe"" and select ""Open with WinRAR"" and you will it contains within it a file called ""FLSetup.exe"". Extract that into the folder of your choosing. Once again, DO NOT EXECUTE this one either. ""Open with WinRAR"" this file, and you'll see two files inside this one. One's called ""fl10inst.exe"" and another is called ""flaudit.exe"".

Extract ""fl10inst.exe"" and delete the other EXE files. That there is your real FL Studio setup file. I believe ""flaudit.exe"" is the stdrt.exe virus. This file ""flaudit.exe"" is self-extracted and run, along with ""fl10inst.exe"", when you execute the original ""FL10SETUP.exe"". It even has the Windows Media icon and says ""Windows Media Center Diagnostic Application"" in its Version description.

You can safely execute ""fl10inst.exe"" and install FL Studio. The files in the Crack folder work just fine for me."" : sonicpunk32"
,htfissure,2012-09-22T22:36Z,"BTW, I tried using 7-Zip and a few others, but WinRAR was the only one that really worked to unpack the ""FL10SETUP.exe"" and ""FLSetup.exe"" files.

And he's right. If you look, ""flaudit.exe"" is listed as ""Windows Media Center Diagnostic Application"" which is the exact description that the stdrt.exe virus had on my PC before."
