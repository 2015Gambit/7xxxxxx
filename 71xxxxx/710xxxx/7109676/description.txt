Review by Scott Yanow:
This follow-up to The Touch of Your Lips also has the trumpeter/vocalist joined by guitarist Doug Raney and bassist Niels Pedersen but differs in that the repertoire (Jimmy Heath's "For Minor's Only," Hoagy Carmichael's "Daybreak," Richard Beirach's "Broken Wing" and Miles Davis's "Down") avoids standards in favor of lesser-known pieces. Baker is in fine form stretching out on these six- to eleven-minute performances. 

01. For Minors Only   
02. Daybreak   
03. You Can't Go Home Again    
04. Broken Wing    
05. Down
