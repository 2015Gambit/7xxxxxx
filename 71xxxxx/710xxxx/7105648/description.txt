This rip was not created by me and is otherwise available anonymously on R@pidSh@re, but I am uploading it to TPB because of the rarity of the material. The files were created with EAC, and were originally encoded with Monkey's Audio (a lossless codec); For this upload, I've transcoded them to FLAC and cleaned up the metadata a bit. The files sound flawless, to my ear. All credit goes to the unknown original ripper for making these recordings available.
