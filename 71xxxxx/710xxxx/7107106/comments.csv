Thanks for the sick torrent! One question though, I've run the scan, it's found the documents I lost, but it keeps asking me to register the product and when I enter the serial no that came with the torrent, it doesn't work :(

Any suggestions as to what to do? My files are so near yet so far!! 

Cheers dude"
