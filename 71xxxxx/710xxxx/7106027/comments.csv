,omegaviper,2012-03-16T07:59Z,why do you make releases that are about 480p at twice the size of yify's which are 720p.  it seems rather pointless.
,Dude1217,2012-03-16T18:04Z,First off .BONE. great download thank you. Now omegaviper I would greatly like to answer your question. This can be answered simply by reading the info listed here and in the YIFY release. Thats hard for a lot of people so I will explain it. Basically this release as it says at the top if from a 1080p Bluray so .BONE. down mixed it so it has good quality in a lower resolution file thus a larger file size. YIFY doesn't state where the source was so I would venture a guess it was probably a DVDrip that was upconverted to imitate a higher resolution Bluray quality thus the smaller file size. So the question is if quality or the file size matters to you. I have a Samsung 3D LED 8000 series TV and see a huge difference between the two and the YIFY release looks fuzzier and has some pixelation in faster moving scenes. I used to rip and convert a lot so those are my guesses based on what I've done and would do. Hope it helps to answer a bit. It is a matter of what you would rather want out of a video. I mostly just convert from 2D to 3D now so I can definitely tell you that from that experience too that down mixing is much better than upconverting and again there is a difference in file size for that. I got tired of doing it for just 2D movies so I leave it to the professionals and I would say about 75% of my downloads are from .BONE. because his releases are great even in the cam stages. Hope that helps a bit in explaining
