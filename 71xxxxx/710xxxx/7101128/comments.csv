,Xinthose,2012-03-15T00:24Z,"if the size is 450 MiB, is the quality bad?  I just want the normal 700 MiB, not the HD 2.3 GB"
,michaelrwatson,2012-03-15T05:15Z,"Does this have English subs for the parts in Russian and Ukranian? Utterly worthless w/o those. 

Your info above is misleading--only *part* of the movie is in English."

,kensin2011,2012-03-18T01:02Z,Very watchable only thing missing is subtitles for when ethan speaks russki but it dont detract from  movie
[T],Vitamin_X,2012-03-19T23:45Z,"Get yourself this subtitle  and you shouldn't have any problem watching this.
Just rename this subtitle file to the original title name.
