BONUS BOOK - ΓÇ£Good to be King: The Foundation of Our Constitutional FreedomΓÇ¥
...is a must read for anyone who cares about the affairs of government. In chapterΓÇÖs one through eight, 2004 libertarian presidential candidate Michael Badnarik gives his unique introduction to the Constitution and presents a compelling argument of why, in America, you are a king. The next nine chapters Michael breaks down the Constitution with a sheer brilliance that comes with over 25 years of studying the document and the history of these united States. You will learn what this great document does and does not mean. In the remainder of the book Michael exposes corruption and treason within the united States and instead of leaving you with a grim tale of doom and gloom Michael also spells out a non-violent plan of hope that begins with you!

This book provides in depth analysis of the supreme law of the land with legal definitions provided by BlackΓÇÖs Law Dictionary throughout. Each chapter is short and to the point; Michael does not ramble or beat around the bush. This book is written to ΓÇ£edify and entertain school children and seasoned libertarians alike,ΓÇ¥ as Congressman Ron Paul put it. And instead of telling you to take his word for it, Michael encourages you to turn over every leaf and question all authority including his own. If you would like to experience what our founders entrusted congress to preserve for you, read this book. If you could care less and would rather watch TV than donΓÇÖt read it and watch your liberties go down the toilet.
