Hi,

********This is a re-upload from what was shortly available on TPB ********

It might be the program that Lenovo uses to create their factory default recovery partition, which works together with their one key recovery button (novo-button)

People who bought their laptop without OS, don't get the physical novo button to work, because lenovo not releases this part of the software.

I'm not able to test it myself, but i only know that lenovo laptop owners looking for it. 

Their is not much to find about the program (engineer version) on the internet yet.

So, don't complain if it is not what it says. Hope some tech guys can have a look at it and post their findings below.
