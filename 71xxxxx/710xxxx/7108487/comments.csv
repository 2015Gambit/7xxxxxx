,amalkamal,2012-04-18T10:36Z,Thanks man ... but please more info? I know that the first three seasons in DVD but what about the rest of 'em ?
[T],AncientRome,2012-04-18T17:34Z,"All of the seasons are TV rips, and are low quality (4:3) when it comes down to resolution.

The last season is in 16:9 ratio.

I no longer have any of the files on my computer to give an appropriate mediainfo and I'm surprised the torrent has so many seeders."
,CodeX96,2012-04-21T13:14Z,"u could easily change the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 16:9 using MPEG4Modifier or you could simply use a video player like Media Player Classic Home Cinema to automatically change the aspect ratio of every video file you play to the aspect ratio of your display..whether it be a laptop screen, hdtv, computer monitor...it will change it without having to do a single click..you can also get all files to automatically open in full screen mode soon as u open it! i love k-lite mega codec pack! u can get all of this stuff at free-codecs.com"
[T],AncientRome,2012-04-21T19:22Z,"Do not forget when changing something that is supposed to be 4:3 into a 16:9 ratio, you will chop off some of the video detail.

When I mentioned 16:9, I was referring to the last season being 720p, while the other seasons are 376p."
,CodeX96,2012-04-25T09:58Z,"the black bars arent hard coded it just stretches the video so it gets rid of the black bars...anyway wuts important is that the last season is not 720p if it was it would be a mkv or mp4 depending on what audio stream type is encoded...u cant encode to 720p x264 from a dvd as dvd is 480p but u can from a pvrĂŠdsr recording but it must be from an HD channel...the last season is 480p...i was dissappointed to see the first 2 seasons as MPGĂ¨s which is garbage quality but if u go on piratebay and search ""becker s01"" and ""becker s02"" u will find the dvdrip which is AVI thank you very much"
