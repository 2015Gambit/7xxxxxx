This is the latest release (date 16.02.2012)

@meszues
Install the package to view the map on the PC and send it (full or a small part) to the GPS.
Unlocked IMG map is ""ready to use"", you have to copy it on the GPS (Garmin or Map folder)
3DB, JCV, ASR,G2S and SQLite can be used on models that support those specific features."
