If you want to see it without the stutter, you could buy it from http://www.digitaltheatre.com/production/details/much-ado-about-nothing-tennant-tate/overview"

The first 35 minutes are not in sync, but after that point it seems good.  Well worth the download if you don't want to buy it from the link posted."
