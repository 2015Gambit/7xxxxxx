,omegaviper,2012-03-16T08:01Z,yify's 720p version about 700mb why even release this
,stan1408,2012-03-16T09:57Z,This is for those who want higher bitrate.

you can download yify's.
most people want high quality releases and high quality releases are always larg in size because of higher bitrate.
High Bitrate = High quality = Larg file size"
,omegaviper,2012-03-20T11:28Z,"@ShahinD and stan1408 i have both versions and they look the same on my 50+ inch 1080p tv's, so your wrong.  I have been getting yify's releases for almost 2 years and he is the best that's why I made the comment.  higher bitrates do not always mean better quality there is a minimum bitrate that will give you the best quality and size and yify does that.


So my point still stands, why do these exist?"
,richreg,2012-03-22T22:26Z,"700MB & 720P for an hour and twenty minute film? I haven't seen any full length film in that size & at that resolution that looks good on a big screen TV.  In fact, I haven't seen any in that size that even manage to achieve 720P. 

Regardless, at 700MB yify's torrent can't be in AC3. Most would prefer the audio track to be in 5.1 surround if played through their home system."
,omegaviper,2012-03-23T07:32Z,@richreg your really dumb and don't know anything yify has been around for years and has hundreds if not thousands of 720p and 1080p movies that look great on large screens just look search for him on here.  if you search for a movie especially a big name release and simply add the year and 720p like this. in time 2011 720p you will find his torrent for it and you can click his user name which has all his releases. here is a link http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6966984/In_Time_%282011%29_720p_BluRay_x264_-_700MB_-_YIFY
,teabag87,2012-03-25T14:49Z,"the bit rate difference is most notable in dark scenes, in the background.  With a low bitrate, you will see a lot of artifact production.  If that doesnt bother you, then go download a 700mb file.  "
,omegaviper,2012-03-29T14:19Z,@teabag87 except it doesn't if it is done well like yify consistently does and if by chance one of his 720p releases are not completely on par with a true 720p then you could get his 1080p release to make it perfect and it would still be smaller than these bigger 720p releases by all these dumb uploaders
