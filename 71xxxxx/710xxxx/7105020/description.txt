Leo, a psycopath and a silent, obsessed and deeply disturbed man, concieves a progressive fascination for Bilbao, a strip tease ballerina, who to reach the end of the month, she has to be a prostitute. Leo studies her movements and ends up kidnapping her, as if she was his object to add to his erotic collection.

The films of legendary Spanish director Bigas Luna literally overflow with symbolist and surrealist images, drawn from his seemingly inexhaustible passion for sex, food and his native Catalunya. Everything is oversized in LunaΓÇÖs universe, from womenΓÇÖs breasts to male egos; one of his great gifts as a filmmaker is to be able to satirize Spanish culture without deflating any of its mysteries. Born in Barcelona in 1946, Luna studied painting and design in college, and founded his own avant garde design company soon after graduation. BILBAO (1978), his second film, brought him international attention. The disturbing first-person narrative of an emotionally-crippled voyeur, BILBAO also reverberated with political implications: the title refers to both a prostituteΓÇÖs name and the industrial capital of the Basque region, long a center of resistance to Castilian control. Bigas LunaΓÇÖs most scandalous and controversial film has only been shown a handful of times in the U.S. where it was greeted with outrage by shocked audiences.
