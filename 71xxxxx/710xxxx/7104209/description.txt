CAROL WOODS' classic 1972 album Out Of The Woods finally makes it to CD! This digitally remastered edition, available from the UK-based label Fantastic Voyage/Future Noise, also includes two bonus tracks from a rare post-album 1972 single!

Out Of The Woods combines three singles and an album recorded for British independent label Ember. The tracks were recorded in New York and London, late 1970 through 1972 with the best of session men from both cities. The original LP now fetches more than ┬ú60 on the Internet and is a very collectable selection of seventies soul. This is the first time the majority of these recordings have been released on CD and they are all remastered from original tapes.
