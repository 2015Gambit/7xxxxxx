If I am wrong and it's not the same I will come back and let folk know. Bueller may know?"
,Wu_Lord,2012-03-17T18:29Z,"I was wrong. I watched the Sample and it was two black gurls. I should've known - Shawnda?

FWIW sample looked about V/8, A/8
Might just watch Dilemna again anyways... Later kidz."
,Wu_Lord,2012-03-17T18:31Z,Could be dual comment. Not same film. V8/A8 from sample.
