MOST of it is flawless and am looking into WHY audio gaps are occurring; one theory is already being tested...

720p will be 100% in sync - it's a promise - and if the issue can be resolved swiftly a repack will be posted"
[V],psspss,2012-03-17T10:19Z,":) told you in previous rips audio was a problem
with your mp4s as all converters had issues
i think I fixed the audio in my xvid up though
and yes the last segment was worse

yep some are waiting for 720p 
nice one ta. again for a source"
[T],trialNerror,2012-03-17T23:58Z,"The bad audio has absolutely nothing to do with the mp4 conversion.

The bad audio came directly from the ac3 in the .ts recording.

I tried a number of ways to fix the audio gaps with no resolve.

You can hate mp4's thinking that caused the problem but in the description it clearly says the audio issue was from the recording, not the encoding."
[T],trialNerror,2012-03-19T07:04Z,"Good news, folks!

Found out what causes audio gaps and even more importantly found out how to work around it so there will never be another last segment out of sync!  It wasn't necessarily the encoding process, but the encoder used. Found another one that doesn't get screwed up by ac3 audio gaps. "
