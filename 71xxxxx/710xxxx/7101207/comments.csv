,lobo345,2012-03-14T11:08Z,Excellent single file release!
,67steinip,2012-03-14T11:52Z,For me it seams to lag :s.. like it drops frames when  something quick is moving and i do have a good computer and it has never happened before.. 
,67steinip,2012-03-14T12:19Z,"however it's weird no matter what release i watch the whole ""drop frames"" is in all of them? wondering if that is just how the show was produced"
,Wartz,2012-03-14T13:10Z,"@67steinip Same here. Same problem, it never happened before. It's very annoying and for I can't tell how to fix it, I'll just wait for a better release or skip this week show. it's a shame though, it's one a my favorite with Justified."
,paulcx,2012-03-14T13:55Z,Yeah I'm also getting a jerkiness in movement - something different with the encoding??  Try another torrent maybe.
,barnhawk,2012-03-14T16:31Z,"Looks like it's been encoded with an iPhone or other mobile device preset. These tend to drop frames rather than reduce image quality, in order to keep the data rate down."
,Frito37,2012-03-14T20:43Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU LIKE GOING FROM 24 fps to 5fps over and over.... Don't upload junk like this if you didn't even check to see if it was encoded right.
,JRaiden,2012-03-18T19:43Z,Fuck up confirmed. Do not download.
