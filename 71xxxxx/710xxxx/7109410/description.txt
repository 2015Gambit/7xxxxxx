I've uploaded this great Android 4.0 ROM for you :D
It is Android 4.0.3 based on CM9 with Mike's new 2.6.35.14 kernel.
It was adapted for ICS and GT-540 in many ways like:

-3.2 kernel power(msm-battery) and CPUFreq drivers
-3.0.8 GPU core drivers(KGSL 3.0)
-Genlock and memalloc(new kind of memory managment stuff from Galaxy Nexus)
-The Bluetooth driver also from Nexus(It is needed for BlueSleep issue-thanks Mac┼éaw)
-It has got an LGΓÇÖs .29 Charging table restored to get real battery percentage
-Backported framebrufer from 3.0 to get rid of screen sleeping errors
-Netfilter from 3.0 for data stats(not implemented in system yet)
-Battery Voltage and Temperature is fixed
