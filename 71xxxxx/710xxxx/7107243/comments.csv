,damncrow,2012-03-17T02:47Z,"Works.
Except that I don't find Power and Glory and Mud and Guts cars anywhere? Even in-game DLC list shows only Live Bonus, X Games, Monte Carlo and ""Variety"" (being a fusion of CMR Vision Charity, Ken Block and Mini Gymkhana)."

,Rando_q1,2012-03-19T20:04Z,Local profile save's not working.... no dlc cars...
,JBumer,2012-03-19T20:35Z,"same as damncrow, works but no ""The Power and Glory Pack"" included, so tis is not the real Complete edition... sad but true... :("
,Rando_q1,2012-03-19T22:11Z,save's working sorry my bad 5. Run the file ProfileImport.exe once. It will create five blank savegame profiles. If any earlier (DiRT 3) savegame profiles exist on your computer the three first ones will be kept. (If you have other needs then prior to executing this step manually backup saved profiles and insert them later. Location is %USERPROFILE%/My Documents/My Games/DiRT3/savegame)
,Lud0L@,2012-03-20T23:57Z,"Mine doesn't start... When I start the game, the computer reacts like it is going to start, but no, it doesn't. Every time i ""start"" it a so called 
0.exe *32 file poppes up in my task master. Anyone knows the problem?"
,Rando_q1,2012-03-21T01:08Z,@ Lud0L@ try to reinstall games for windows live.... i had game not starting error with windows 8 and live client causes it....
,ANGRYUNIBROW,2012-03-22T21:43Z,"About bloody time someone uploads this! I have been waiting since launch day!

Many a thanks to you, palci12/FiGHTCLUB"
,piratot,2012-03-24T13:38Z,"this is how i made it work:

I used the crack from skidrow 1.1update PLUS the crackfix from fightclub. 

Do not remove the database restrictions files, because the game will crash.
I also cant see the Mud and guts car pack or Power and glory car pack, though i just started playing the game. it may unlock further in the game, i hope.
the other dlcs are unlocked in the game extras -> available  add-ons menu.

hope this helped someone."
,palci12,2012-03-24T16:41Z,ANGRYUNIBROW i thank you ;) this is my first torrent but i am disappointed becuse power and glory; mud and nuts dont work :(

,Graves69,2012-05-17T14:33Z,"This is just stupid, I downloaded this 100% but I still didn't get even one .iso file. And at the moment I was downloading this my virus scanner was beeping the whole time, defensing my computer from the possible viruses coming from the file. Now I can't even delete the game from my computer anymore because my virus scanner says that it's unsafe. This file is fucking cancer to my computer, 0/10 would not seed."
,bazoaka,2012-05-28T02:44Z,"Hello! :)  

I just can not save the game, and I followed all the instructions listed above .. Already created an offline profile, since the firewall blocked the game, already uninstalled GFWL and I went back again to install, ProfileImport.exe already installed, and yet I can not save the game! Always asks me ""Profile Creation Failed - you must be signed into Live to create a new save for your porfile."" Because I own it appears that when I created an offline profile?! .. can not understand. There is something here that is not right, it will be some of you that got it for the game to work, could you help me? ... I would appreciate it a lot!"
,tamparuim,2012-06-17T22:53Z,do not waste time downloading this crap because it does not work
