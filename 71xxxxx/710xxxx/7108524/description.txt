The game is based on the movie, which takes place after the team escapes from the pet store, Juarez and Blasters new home, and Kip and other FBI agents, gives players the ability to play as Darwin and Mooch to fight against Leonard Saber, the evil billionaire and his robot "household appliances" army.


Most sites give this game a 7.5 rating, I give it an 8, as I play this on a 52 inch LCDTV, at 1920x1080 whilst using an Xbox360 controller, and this game is perfectly crisp, and really fun to play.
