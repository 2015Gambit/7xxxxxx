,Leignheart,2012-03-17T03:49Z,"keeps crashing for me, dont know why. any help?"
,tedwu,2012-03-17T05:13Z,"several issues here too. First norton is a pain dont use it if you had a choice. Keeps killing false possitive files w/t your conscent. Though you can restore then set to ignore, it's a pain in the neck to go through for everytime. 
Another major issue is as stated here will not run after kicking in from intro CTP. Experience in the past suggest software does not support SLI/Crossfire. Been having that on few late 2011-12 games. Including Allan Wake, and several others.
Anyway Im gonna cut to point to say I will try few known options to me if I got sucess I will post. 
SYSTEM Spec: 4890 x2, 1200W CM, 1333Mhz mem 4Gb, win 7 x86, QX 9770, Rampage Ext.  "
,tedwu,2012-03-17T05:21Z,"I hope I have not double comment. TPB has a strange comment system can't see my own comment. 

Anyhow here to let you know that the original works w or w/t SLI/Crossfire. As for update patch no idea what have gone wrong. Please anyone knew please share."
