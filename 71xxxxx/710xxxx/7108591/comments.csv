,vault23,2012-04-15T04:13Z,"I couldn't get the game to load, kept asking for the cd to be inserted.  I wound up finding an iso of the game elsewhere.  Will continue to seed this copy, maybe the problem was just with my pc."
,x30001wtm,2012-04-15T11:23Z,"Ack.  I figured everyone would just burn the files to CD using Imgburn or something similar.  Guess I could have posted the iso.  Anyway, glad you found it, and thanks for seeding :)"
