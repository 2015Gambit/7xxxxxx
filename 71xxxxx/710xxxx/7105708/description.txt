SYNOPSIS:  
The first feature film to incorporate vocal musical numbers and some dialogue in an era of silent movies, The Jazz Singer stars Al Jolson as the son of a Jewish cantor who experiences conflict when he rejects his family heritage. He becomes a cabaret entertainer but ultimately realizes that he must find a way to balance career and family. The film received an Academy Award nod for writing and won a special Oscar for Technical Achievement.
