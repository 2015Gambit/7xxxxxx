This is my first torrent, just want to see how this goes... I played this game a few times over the years and packed it all in one to share.

The evil Lord Draak, who has the power to transform himself into a dragon, has recovered from earlier defeat and returned with his minions to the world of Uma bringing death and mayhem. You must find your way to Draak's lair and slay him in combat. On the way, you must locate the seven crystals and use them to recreate the time orb, without which Draak can not be defeated.

Easy to get running, no key required. Could just download, install, and play! I tested this on my Dell Inspiron 1525 with windows vista sp2.
Although, I never tried to go find anywhere to play online.
