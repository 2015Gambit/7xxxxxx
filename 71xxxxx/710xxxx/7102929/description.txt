prepare to enter a world behind bars. And we don't mean the ones in the Vic and R&R.
join us for an exclusive look into what life's been like on the inside for Phil.
Framed by beastly Ben for Stella Crawford's murder on his birthday,
Phil was carted away by the police and locked up.
While the rest of the Mitchell family work on how to get him out,

He's given the task of showing new young prisoner Devon (Tobi Bakare) the ropes,
but when Devon clashes with the prison's dangerous top dog, Craig Jenkins (Glenn Doherty),
how far is Phil prepared to go to save someone else?
