Tchaikovsky and Petipa's timeless ballet - acknowledged as the most pure and demanding piece in the classic romantic repertoire - is a stunning example of the sparkling virtuosity of Petipa's rich dance vocabulary. Recorded at Het Muziektheater in Amsterdam with Het Nationale Ballet (The Dutch National Ballet) in 2003, this version was created in 1981 by the English choreographer Sir Peter Wright, whose sensitive staging closely reflects Marius Petipa's original work. 
In 1989 the ballet was adapted for Het Muziektheater's larger stage. Philip Prowseís' ravishing Baroque sets and costumes add the glamour and grandeur essential to a ballet intended for the court of the Russian Tsar.
