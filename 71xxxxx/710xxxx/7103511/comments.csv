,spifkitten99,2012-03-15T03:06Z,mp4 is bullshit
,xtheghost,2012-03-15T04:12Z,"I actually prefer .mp4 files, just personal preference. "
,spgonzales,2012-03-15T04:14Z,thanks
,LJE111,2012-03-15T04:16Z,Love MP4!
,mosamlit,2012-03-15T04:23Z,Complaining about .mp4's is like someone giving you $100 for free but complaining that you're getting it in singles. 
,clothes_hoist2012,2012-03-15T04:50Z,"^LOL..  Kitten, Mp4 and mkv are much better for quality. Much better than the blockyness and pixelation that plagues AVI. Better quality and smaller filesize:)"
,mrmingus,2012-03-15T07:07Z,Plus no need to convert to add to your iphone/ipod
,nonukez,2012-03-15T07:53Z,"Very, very disturbing how many people need handholding to play MP4 files. 
I mean come on, talk about a lazy generation. People have access to ANY piece of information they want through the internet, yet they decide to whine and bitch in the comments, screaming they want AVI back because they can't spend 5 minutes learning how to play MP4 files. Such a shame really. "
,willis00,2012-03-15T08:15Z,Does it work on xbox 360?
,TheSageM,2012-03-15T08:23Z,"@spifkitten99: no, YOU are bullshit. Nobody is forcing you to download this version. Why are people so technologically challenged? "
,jdkhamba,2012-03-15T13:13Z,I fail to see the problem with mp4 files. Just download the latest version of vlc media player. It plays everything.
,jdkhamba,2012-03-15T13:15Z,what's wrong with mp4 files? vlc media player plays everything. No need for any codecs either
,morpheusxnyc,2012-03-15T20:06Z,"Not everyone watches these files on their computer. Some of us have media player devices hooked up to our TVs where we copy files over to them and sit down and watch them comfortably on our couches.

The problem is that many media players (such as the one I own) do NOT support MP4 or MKV, so it's a bit of a pain in the ass to convert them to AVI/MPEG each and every single time.

But I don't complain because hey - it's free.

But still, MKV is an unforgivable piece of shit codec to use. Virtually NO media players out there support it. "
,Wyldefang,2012-03-15T23:36Z,"Don't like mp4's? Don't fucking d/l it. 

Pretty simple you fucking simpletons"
,666ASPEN666,2012-03-16T00:01Z,thanx.. and stay with mp4 gives the best quality
,trywait4,2012-03-16T12:50Z,"Thanks for the smaller file sizes.
For my iPod Nano 5th Generation, seems that I
have to convert video to an *.mv4. I can convert in iTunes. Am wondering if any other MacPro compatible program can convert an *.mp4, maybe *.AVI to a *.mv4 for my iPod Nano 5th Gen."
,orangewedge,2012-03-17T01:41Z,"@morpheusxnyc Have you tried MKV2VOB? Dunno what your player is but it works for ps3
"
,Ruby_pirate,2012-03-18T04:39Z,"Thank you very much eztv! Perfect as always :D

spefkitten99, fuck you. LEARN how to say thank you."
,dielec,2012-03-23T04:57Z,"Why do all these whiners keep complaining about the video file type?! Just download it, watch it on VLC or GOM, and stfu!!

Thank you eztv."
,jamie007,2012-03-27T08:49Z,"First of all, a big thanks to ezTV as always and please dont think Im being ungrateful as you've given me hours of entertainment.

But to all those on here on their high horse complaining that those who dont like mp4's are ""technologically challenged"" or crap like that, no. The reason we like avi is because it is versatile, I can play it on any TV or DVD player in the house just by copying it to a flashdrive. mp4 might be fine for those who like to watch shows hunched in front of a PC monitor or who lug their laptop around, but for the rest of us it is a pain in the ass."
