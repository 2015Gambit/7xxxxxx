,potprinc3,2012-03-15T22:08Z,"thanks mate. a very nice movie. I must admit that Spielberg has playing some of his old tricks again in ""War Horse"", but after all these years they still work like a charm and a wonderful motion picture is the outcome. This will be another Spielberg classic to remember in years to come.

Back in old days of ""Saving Private Ryan"", it was Tom Hanks saving Private Ryan. This time it is a horse. ""War Horse"" tells the story of a destined encounter, and a later breathtaking journey across beautifully displayed landscapes. It is a story about the bravery of a young man who embarks on an odyssey to look for his lost horse.

This is indeed a war movie, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable ones I have seen about War World I (since most films go for WWII). But it is not only about the raging war of course. You'd expect more than that from one of the all-time favorite directors. And I can ensure you ""War Horse"" does not disappoint. It may not be as touching and tears-generating as the good old ""ET"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", but it is certainly an excellent addition to Spielberg's career.

Aside from the story, the cinematography is incredible, and it has to be one of the best of the year. The score is also surprisingly good. I was pretty worried that this would somehow get ""snubbed"" by the Academy with all the strong frontrunners going on right now but I am quite affirmative now that this has the potential and chances to grab a number of nods.

Watch ""War Horse"" if you've always enjoyed Spielberg's movies. It is indeed his style you will find in this film. It is an adventure for everyone to look forward to and one that is rewarding in the end."
