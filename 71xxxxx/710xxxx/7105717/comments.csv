,_moosie_,2012-03-16T06:33Z,"If you guys want to support the show so it doesn't get canceled again, watch the show on TV, or at least switch to the channel. Support the show!"
,loags11,2012-03-16T08:10Z,Thank god its finally back 
,anhctef,2012-03-16T10:22Z,What's with the recent switch to .mp4 format?
,MeattiusRex,2012-03-16T16:42Z,But seriously...please watch the show everyone. Our anguish happened because too little of the fan base actually tuned in to watch it. So just flip it on...Nielson runs TV...
,LOLSOPA,2012-03-16T18:49Z,Just FYI watching the show on the TV doesn't actually help because there is no way to get the real ratings. It only helps if you are a Nielson family who can report back that they watched it.
,chandlerboy,2012-03-17T00:05Z,Files blacks out twice. Shitty blocky new format?
