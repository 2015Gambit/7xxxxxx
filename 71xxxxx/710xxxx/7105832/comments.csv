...its shit...I would rather download a 500mb xvid.avi than download 150mb shitbird that is blocky as fuck...

...anyone like this jackass format should choke on a bag of dicks..."
,jagr_200,2012-03-16T04:13Z,@logan-x-art - chill out bro. If you don't like the quality(yes the switch is annoying. Id also rather download a 500mb file) then go to oneddl.eu and get the episodes. All files have a HD option. But you need a premium rapidshare account. It is totally worth it tho.

,QborT,2012-03-16T04:18Z,"logan-x-art your comment shows how little you know and it made me chuckle.  The new scene standard for tv isn't .mkv files they are .mp4, and they are indeed higher quality than the oldschool xvid standard.  End of story, you lose."

- This is episode 9, isn't it? Maybe my numbering scheme is jacked, but ettv's most recent releases were up through 8.

- 404px x264-encoded mp4s generally deliver more data, better-compressed, at a smaller file size per pixel (sometimes smaller than the less-efficient 352px xvid avis). Use VLC, it plays everything you throw at it."
