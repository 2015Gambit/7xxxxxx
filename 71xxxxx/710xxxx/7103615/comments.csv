[V],psspss,2012-03-15T05:10Z,"seems some dont even know how to click on the psspss username and get to see the list of all torrents by someone.. I think if you see over 200
torrents with seeders still it kinda tells you they
are trusted even if they dont have a SKULL :)

video I randomly checked for syncing.. mp4 can convert funny at times.. but havent watched it myself so can never be sure if any problems with it
but I think its all good with random checks

I see though yesterday someone post a fake episode of this and used a scane cappers TAG lol

anyhow you can preview stuff if you set utorrent
to grab first and last blocks then VLC player
you can preview the video without downloading it all!

videolan.org if not using vlc.. it plays corrupted videos just fine "

[V],psspss,2012-03-15T15:13Z,"yeh is good except the source froze at 29min in..

so this has the same cliche for a few seconds
pretty minor though"
