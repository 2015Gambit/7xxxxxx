2011...2012...2013..its all a blur to me. They go by so fast now."
[T],480v,2012-03-16T08:42Z,You know what...This probably isn't the first time I dated files incorrectly. I'm pretty sure I've done it before. Only this time I noticed it. 
[T],480v,2012-03-16T08:47Z,JUST A REMINDER. DO NOT CORRECT THE FILES' DATE UNTIL YOU ARE COMPLETELY FINISHED SEEDING. IT'LL MESS UP THE TORRENT.
