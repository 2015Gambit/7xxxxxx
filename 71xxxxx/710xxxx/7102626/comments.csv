At least in this area (Highres Movies) the audio should be proportionally Hi-Fi with the video quality... Not to mention that John Williams's music (original score) was nominated for Oscar, so one more reason for a high audio quality."
,fumo7,2012-03-14T22:26Z,I agree with muLineZu - this is a deal breaker for me too. Of course no big deal - I will wait for some other version with 5.1 sound and I understand that probably 80% of ppl don't have or use 5.1 sound system so they might prefer it this way. However AAC is really good codec and it can store good quality 5.1 sound at about 330-384 bitrate so you don't save much space by downmixing to stereo.
,elDunge,2012-03-14T22:50Z,"Because 1.88 GB becomes 6.54 GB and most people don't see any difference? I usually download a ~3.5gb version of my 720p flix, but this time it's not available and I'm wondering which one to take"

,muLineZu,2012-03-15T01:22Z,"@elDunge: I don't wanna start no debate around the audio issue, but you're wrong about the size difference. The encoder haven't specified the file's bitrate, but judging from it's size, I would say it's around 1.500Kb/s, and the video size would be around 95% of the file, so the 2ch AAC would be around 100MB. If you'll try a similar encode, but a 5.1ch AAC, I'd say you'll get a 200-500MB in plus to the file's size. So we're talking 2.0-2.4GB the final result, not in the least 6,5GB that would be obtained at a minimum 4.500Kb/s and a 5.1ch DTS..."
,SilenceMurderer,2012-03-15T14:29Z,"Hi,

muLineZu and are right, AAC is a superior codec what makes it able to keep as much as possible information in the video. AAC in combination with smart video encoding makes me able to upload videos in very small size, but still pretty much like the real Blu-Ray.

The reason I made it 1.88GB is because I made the bit rate a bit higher this time, plus the movie is relatively long, 146 minutes. ;)"

,SilenceMurderer,2012-03-16T13:03Z,"@11162 
Why not just stream the first bit?"
,SilenceMurderer,2012-03-16T17:08Z,"If you are searching for a subtitle you can download  them in 17 languages in my next upload (War Horse 1080p), you just have to select the files you donÂ´t need to ""donÂ´t download"". 

In BitTorrent it works like this:
Click on the torrent -> click on ""Files"" ->  right mouse click on the files you don't need -> click ""don't download"""
,J.S.L.Geeganage,2012-04-16T17:43Z,100% good for me. Good movie as well.
