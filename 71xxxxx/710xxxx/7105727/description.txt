White Heat is a new six-part drama series about the
interwoven lives, loves and betrayals of seven
characters whose relationships are forged in the
white heat of the Sixties through to present day,
written for BBC by award-winning writer Paula Milne.

Passionate, dangerous and compelling, the characters'
love stories and friendships are set against a backdrop
that takes us from Wilson to Thatcher, feminism to the
Falklands, hedonism to HIV - exploring the personal and
political journeys which shaped their destinies to make
them the people they are today.
