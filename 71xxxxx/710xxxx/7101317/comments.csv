RAR, okay by me. Only take a few seconds to unRAR.
x264 codec provides superior resolution and smaller files sizes, both are a plus. 
mkv, excellent versatile container."
,Jack8989,2012-03-15T17:21Z,"Hello, I would both like to thank you for taking the time to upload this but also explain why so many of us are frustrated with the MKV format. Its not that the quality isnt great its that the programs many of us use to burn DVDs do not support MKV and it turns a 2 minutes project with an AVI into a big project not worth doing. So please consider uploading AVI files if possible, if not thanks anyways. "
,we_r_nd,2012-03-16T01:02Z,I agree with Jack8989!!  Please put all TV shows in the user friendly AVI format of 175/220/350mb!!
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-16T12:17Z,"1996 -- DVD Movies
2001 -- Xvid
2003 -- H.264 (x264)
2006 -- Blu-ray
2012 -- ""The Scene"" Adopts H.264 (x264)

Old Tech vs. New Tech
xvid vs. h264
wav files vs. mp3 files
Vinyl vs. CD
VHS vs. DVD
Fire pit vs. the Stove Top vs. the Microwave,  ETC....

Eventually ALL Scene releases, and most non-scene release, will be H.264/x264

Older computers had difficulty playing mp3's and plenty of people complained.
CD & DVD meant ditching old tape drives or turntables and buying new hardware..plenty of people complained. Today is no different. Things Change. Get the fuck over it.

Yes, everyone knows why you are complaining...and you look like a fool for explaining yourself...for the thousandth time WE GET IT ALREADY....SHUT THE FUCK UP...THE NEW TECH IS NOT GOING AWAY. THE SCENE THAT CAP THESE SHOWS AND THE PEOPLE WHO LEAK THEM TO THE TORRENT WORLD COULD GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE CHANGES. THIS SITE IS NOT HERE TO PLEASE YOU. AGAIN, SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY. 

Grow up and realize that the world does not STOP advancing just for you. Spend $50 on a stand-alone Network/WiFi/USB player for your TV, or other hardware solutions. Or take your FREE torrents, your FREE time, and FREE apps to convert files to whatever format you choose. FYI: $50 divided by 10 years = $5 per year, or 42 cents per month. With a $100 stand-alone product you're still only spending 83 cents per month. That's less than a cup of coffee or a can of Red Bull. "
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-16T12:24Z,"btw, ConvertXtoDVD will convert mkv, and any other file type, and burn onto regular DVD. 
ConverXtoDVD is also available on TPB...just get from trusted members and block the app from accessing the internet to phone home. "
,Jack8989,2012-03-16T15:46Z,"Thanks for the informative post, too bad you had to be a douche first. The fact of the matter is EVERY show i download except the past season of Tosh has avi/mpegs up on the day of release and I find it very useful to download them, burn to a data disc and share with my friends. I made the post as a friendly suggestion to the Tosh.0 uploaders and you turn around and start pmsing everywhere, so goodluck with that. 
Besides Im pretty sure torrents will only be around for a few more months until the real crackdown. "
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-16T17:39Z,You thinking that your first post might help improve or increase the likelihood of more show being available in avi...good luck with that. 
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-16T17:48Z,"A few more months???
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You are living in a bubble."
,nyromeothug,2012-03-18T04:28Z,"dude wtf how bout puttin a normal video??? fk that bullshit about decoding it. i have every single episode of tosh.0 except the last 2 n i neva had to decode them, ur a asshole"
,Slayer_ch,2012-03-24T22:47Z,Why are those crazy people allowed to put comments. sceneline makes perfect releases as good quality mkv's and some dumbasses would like to have bad quality avi's to put them on a DVD? What the hell is wrong with you guys?
