,fillinthisspace,2012-04-08T03:36Z,"I went to SpastikusTV for a look. Almost every single link I clicked on opened a new tab containing an ad which made me wait 5 seconds before I could continue to where I wanted to go (and despite the fact the page was ad free thanks to AdBlocker). Even links to torrents don't download directly.

I won't waste my time there again."
