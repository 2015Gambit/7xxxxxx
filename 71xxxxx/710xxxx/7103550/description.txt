Why does every country in Europe have the same Human Rights laws but Britain under Tony Blair interpreted them totally different to every other country in Europe (of course we all know why, so that his lawyer wife Cherie could make millions). Why are terrorists & criminals protected by these laws but the ordinary person & victims of crime are not? Why is David Cameron doing nothing about it (because the so called Liberalists under Clegg has him on a strangle hold).
