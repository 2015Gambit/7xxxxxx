3)  Part 3 
The family discover the fun of the future as they get to grips with brainwave-controlled video games (including archery and tug of war) and discover how our minds might soon be altering movie endings. They also try exercise bikes which combine the best of the gym with gaming technology to encourage us to train harder, and the show reveals how similar ideas could be used to save lives in hospitals On a day trip to London to explore the world of future fashion, the family try on designer dresses that feature in-built light shows, and instant T-shirts that come out of a spray can - not to mention pants to protect you from passing wind. Teenager Miah gets to design her own little black dress online - but has to suffer mum Michele monitoring her with home-surveillance technology... There's also a look at how holidays will continue to change, from augmented reality travel guides on smart phones to super-small hotel rooms and the planes of tomorrow - which are built like cruise ships and promise to take passengers to Tokyo in a little over two hours. There's even some cool tech for four-year-old grandson Lucas to play with.
