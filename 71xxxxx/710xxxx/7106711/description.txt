0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform real-time strategy (RTS) 

game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a historically-based war/economy game that allows players 

to relive or rewrite the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years between 500 B.C. 

and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving state-of-the-art 3D graphics, detailed 

artwork, sound, and a flexible and powerful custom-built game engine.

The game has been in development by Wildfire Games (WFG), a group of volunteer, hobbyist game 

developers, since 2001. The code and data are available under the GPL license, and the art, sound 

and documentation are available under CC-BY-SA. In short, we consider 0 A.D. an an educational 

celebration of game development and ancient history.

Top new features in this release:
* The Roman Republic faction, playable on custom scenarios and random map scripts--in single player 

and multiplayer, complete with a new art set, including new buildings, units, and ships.
* A new combat system that adds bonuses and weaknesses to each unit, like rock-paper-scissors (e.g. 

spearmen defeat melee cavalry, but are countered by skirmishers and cavalry archers).
* A brand new trading system, over land with traders trained from markets, and over sea with 

merchant ships built at the dock. Establish a trade route between two markets or docks, and your 

traders will gain resources for every trip made. You can choose which resource will be gained by a 

trader.
* Over a dozen new random map scripts by Spahbod, wraitii, and mmayfield45.
* New animations: Rowing oars for ships, rams, some catapults, traders, some animals.
* AI improvements: 0 A.D.'s default AI, qBot, has had a performance increase and had a serious bug 

fixed with the attack code.

Music and Sound: Four new tracks and one re-made track, all composed and directed by Omri Lahav, 

featuring Marta Mc'cave on the flute and Shir-Ran Yinon on the viola. Two of the tracks celebrate 

the Roman faction with a very Italian mandolin.
* An Old Warhorse Goes to Pasture - An Iberian early peace track
* Juno Protect You - A Roman early peace track
* Elysian Fields - A Roman peace track
* Highland Mist - A Celtic early peace track
* The Road Ahead - A remade, neutral (not faction-specific) peace track
