[V],sidbizkit,2012-04-09T09:56Z,"if anyone is confused between the meaning of x86 and x64.. read this:

x64 and x86 have to do with your processor and operating system, i'll spare you the technical details of what each actually mean, but say that x64 is newer and will allow you to run things faster if you have the capability to support it. To determine what kind of system you have, use the following instructions

1. Click Start, then click on Run or Start Search. 
2. Type msinfo32.exe and then press Enter key. 
3. In â&#x20AC;&#x153;System Informationâ&#x20AC;?, review the value for the System Type item: 
For 32-bit editions of Windows, the value of the System Type item is x86-based PC. 
For 64-bit editions of Windows, the value of the System Type item is x64-based PC. 


If you have an X64 copy of windows, you can run x64 software, and also x86 software (windows will automatically run it in compatibility mode) If you have an X86 copy, you are limited to X86 software only. (X86 being older, everything has support for it. X64 is still somewhat new and isn't 100% supported)"
