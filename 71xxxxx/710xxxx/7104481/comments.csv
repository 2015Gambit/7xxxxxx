is this som kind of joke?"
,hdftw,2012-03-16T18:23Z,Please seed so some people get 100% and can seed. It seems like the original seeder never seeds... Those that got it apparently shut the seed down once they hit 100%...
,RatnikBelgrade,2012-03-16T19:44Z,"I seed all time. But others just download and delete torrent, obviously."
,Lawjon,2012-03-17T08:23Z,"I'm at 54% and it is still downloading
slow but working so far"

,RatnikBelgrade,2012-03-18T00:03Z,"@loader1947 Your weak net connection is not my problem... And why u still download when you find other navigations better then this one? :)
Dont get it.. Move on, man."
,EO2M,2012-03-18T01:22Z,"Works perfect. . . .seed is good but speed was 60 kbs but not big problem thanks RatnikBelegrade
loader1947 go and sell ur s**t away this torrent rocks,ur sygic su*ks, just original seeder keep seeding for other people ;)"
,loader1947,2012-03-18T19:47Z,@RatnikBelgrade: the point is that at this very moment there is not one single IP that has 100%. So you must be some kind of fake.... Btw - my connection is 100 Mbit/s. As we say here: bängarsle!
,RatnikBelgrade,2012-03-18T20:34Z,"@Loader1947 just move on the another dl. I really dont have time to discuss about your fckng problems every day. I seed, some people have it downloaded but they dont seed. What u want me to do, to go into their computers? o.O U have found perfect Sygic, why do you still dl this one???"

,EO2M,2012-03-26T13:13Z,"@toha8 I helped him,i uploaded america and evrope  ics compatible version,dont worry, btw if u ask me Sygic is trash,cuz allot of maps are incompleted."
,toha8,2012-03-26T15:39Z,"@EO2M
What maps are you refering to, would be good to know your expirance as Sygic looks great and I have avoid CoPilot because it needs root and 7Gb maps size.
How is Navigon compare to Sygic?"
,nexsta,2012-03-26T19:15Z,"my not working,fresh no see navigon"
,EO2M,2012-03-26T22:04Z,@toha8 Just some citys are incompleted in EX-yu btw im not lover of Sygic.
,Monterat,2012-03-27T01:11Z,"This sux, it's the Select version which usually is branded for providers. Map updates work fine but theres a No Go when launching the app."
