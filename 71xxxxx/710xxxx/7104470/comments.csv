What exactly do you mean by a Quasi-native PDF?"
[V],dynstab2,2012-03-16T12:59Z,"Native PDF as in press quality PDF, what the publisher sends to the printer to print textbooks (prior to any adjustment at the printer's end). What you rent from CourseSmart is a downsampled (or quasi-native) version to keep file size manageable (anyway you don't need press quality on a small LCD display for casual reading).
And you have further downsampling done at the uploader's end... but don't do too much of that or see these pics with DNA markers become useless... For this reason a biology text always has to be more ""quasi-native"" than a trig text (I can cut the file size of this Young trig text by half and you would probably be randomised in a blind comparison - to tell which is which on a laptop LCD - even with quasi-instantaneous switching...) In a nutshell, by ""quasi-native"" I mean good (enough) quality for the purpose. And I did not downsample this trig text. I swear on my mother's head.
Downsampling = digital reduction (aka lossy compression) of the image content of a PDF."
[V],gnv65,2012-03-16T17:22Z,Thanks for the info! I have been making scanned PDFs for past 3 years mostly with ABBYY.  And I save my OCRed PDFs in the highest possible quality that is good enough printing according to ABBYY. What you call native is probably true PDF.
