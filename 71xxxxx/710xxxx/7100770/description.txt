60 minutes of stuff compiled by Lou from 1982-1990.
Something like 37 songs.  This tape (C) 1990 Sebadoh

recorded with various condensor mics, a makeshift 2-track and
finally (88-90) a real 4-track... played on a 4-string acoustic
and ukelele but electric guitar was used on a few things
"sebadough" and "weed forestin" are the origins of titles used
later... none of this is likely to appear on future Sebadoh releases...
it's just old, presumably unlistenable, personal favorites, and recent
things that didn't seem good enough...

compiled 7/90, copied till the original master was destroyed,
revised 11/90
