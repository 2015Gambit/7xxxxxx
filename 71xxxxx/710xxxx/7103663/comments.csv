,QuasarDeathRay,2012-03-15T04:55Z,Thank you.
,Vexehms,2012-03-15T04:56Z,"The frame rate is fixed, but the sound still cuts off around 8:50. So this is still technically a nuked copy."
,ohitexplodes,2012-03-15T04:56Z,Is this legit? The original release didn't contain most of the audio for the episode...
,ohitexplodes,2012-03-15T04:57Z,"Yeah, you fixed it alright. What a stupid fucker."
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2012-03-15T05:01Z,Thanks
,retux,2012-03-15T05:02Z,"I'd download this, but I never download anything from an ""Anonymous"" account. If people comment on this, I'll give it a check. No offense to the uploader, hope you understand why the hesitation :)"
,SumHiDOOD,2012-03-15T05:02Z,fake or real?
,OkazakiLOL,2012-03-15T05:02Z,I'm afraid the audio stops after 8 minutes because the original file was not that long. I'm sorry guys. I did my best..
,elitper,2012-03-15T05:03Z,The audio cuts out half way through and doesn't come back. Still not fixed.
,ohitexplodes,2012-03-15T05:03Z,"Yeah, these comments are coming way too slow. It's annoying."
,Cjoshskull25,2012-03-15T05:04Z,The sound cuts out around the 9 minute mark :(
