it does phone home so if you are using this commercially i wouldn't use it in the shop a lot. just on site. other than that it's great to have in case of an emergency malware virus issue as it is it's own O'/S with the best independent virus malware scanning suite I've used called FACE in automated tools. You may have to add a file type to this. mine came in without an extension. Just add .ISO to the end and use a disk burning utility to get it onto a CD. try Magic ISO Maker. you can find it here.
