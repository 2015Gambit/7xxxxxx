,zappalogic,2012-04-21T12:39Z,"Yes this is a wery good torrent ;)

Just install it and its fully registrated as a original Win 7 ultimate activated - 
Just install.........  no probs

Only one small prob if you not are from holland - its display language is Dutch.  he he

But dont fear  - just download Vistalizator and the prefered mui languepack - run Vistalizator - instal language pack reboot - and there you are  

Vistalizator  is a non microsoft program - and it works fine
Just Google it and get it - and a language packet 

Download - install and enjoy your new OS - with your new display language  ;o)"

,pepperandice,2012-04-25T00:19Z,"im using the iso to install on parallels, it worked and i managed to get the language successfully to english but theres problems cropping up with other stuff, like it says the desktop folder cannot be found, downloads folder cannot be opened etc nonsense

Worst of all is that on the systems page it says '3 days until automatic activation. Activate windows now' when i click that it says the product key i typed is invalid for activation (the product key that is embedded with the iso installation, not something i actually typed in but came with the torrent installation)

Anybody who had it work did this happen, what did you do? where could i get a product key that works??"
,dnb25,2012-04-26T13:55Z,so its a shit copy?????
,zappalogic,2012-05-01T12:51Z,"to pepperandice

i have it installed  on 1 pc and it works perfect.

I did burn it and then made a new install - theres also an xp on same machine and the dualboot also works fine - all works fine

I have no problems with this version and it is fully activatet.

Did you install it on same drive ?    (i diddent)

Did you burn it                              (i diddent)


you DONT need to write anything in - other than your name - 
that means - you dont need a productkey 

Maybee you should try again ?"

This is not a shitty copy -  in my oppinion

have a nice day  ...

I wrote 
""Did you burn it (i diddent)""

It should have said 
""Did you burn it (i did)"""
