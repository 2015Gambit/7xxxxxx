Reload your shotgun, sharpen your sword and rev that chainsaw; Deadhill town is teeming with zombies, and itΓÇÖs your job to put ΓÇÿem down! The fate of humanity rests in the hands of four unlikely heroes: Jack, the gamer; Rachel, the girl; Brian, the geek; and Luxo, the alien. Go it alone, or enlist the services of up to three like-minded chums to survive the zombie apocalypse.

The spiritual successor to Burn Zombie Burn!, All Zombies Must Die! builds on the classic twin-stick shooter formula with a smattering of role-playing features. Level up characters, complete side quests and collect items to craft deadly new weapons. ThereΓÇÖs no shortage of options in how you choose to dispose of the undead, but the brain-chompers arenΓÇÖt going to take it lying down. The shuffling cadavers come in varying shapes and sizes, and are affected by four environmental modifiers; fire, radiation, sonic and shock. Use your weapons and the environment carefully, and you might just make it out in one piece.
