,Hishnegreb,2012-03-14T19:39Z,"Anyone know how to get the local co-op feature working? I haven't even seen an in-game button for it. It's part of the description on Steam too, so I know it's not just a typo here.

Quote ""Go it alone, or enlist the services of up to three like-minded chums to survive the zombie apocalypse.""

P.s. I believe it's only local co-op atm and there is no online feature."

,wadie321,2012-03-15T17:03Z,Hey has any one gotten a XAPOFX1_5.dll missing from your computer? It installed fine just does not want to launch? Is the a fake????
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-03-15T20:46Z,"kaspersky suxx and so does avast. this torrent is clean. works great too. already on 3 level. my pc is fine, not acting funny in any way shape or form. none of my scanners detect anything.

even if they did id have to say it's a false positive. why? well ask ur self a question, what do viruses do? they fuck ur pc up. making it act strange, run slow, and massive popups. well my pc isnt acting strange, running slow, no popups, and im not sending out unwanted info.

CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN....and to top it off CLEAN!!!!!!!!"

,Magic_friendly,2012-08-01T09:58Z,"This game is working JUST fine. I downloaded this game from mdusanjay at least 3 months before my laptop got a virus... It's clean. If you don't believe anyone, that's your problem. If you get the D3DCOMPILER.DLL problem like I did, (Switched to Windows 7 after the virus) then go to dll-files.com and download it. It's how I did it to get it work, and it works nicely now. Thanks! =D"
