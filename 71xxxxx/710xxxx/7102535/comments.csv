,fumo7,2012-03-14T22:39Z,"I don't mind SD resolution but I don't understand why ppl still use XviD. With x264 this could be at least 500MB smaller with the same quality. Why be inefficient?
The only valid argument is compatibility with some old stand-alone players because SD x264 can play even on very slow one core processor."
