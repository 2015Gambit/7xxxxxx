,bongoo396,2012-03-17T21:39Z,"Hello Inspiron!
The apostrophe is because im excited to finally get to say thanks for all your amazing work over the years. Ive been meaning to sign up for a very long time and comment but ive always seeded for quite a while.

Thanks again."
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-18T18:13Z,Thanks. p.s. now my iTunes matched version matches whats on iTunes (because of the unsplit!)
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-18T18:17Z,Also just out of curiosity how long does 11+ hours of splitting then uploading take? seems like a really tiring job on those ones.
