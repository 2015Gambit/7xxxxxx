[V],boobsman,2012-03-16T11:20Z,"@ marillionfan i have the RF version of Cabelas Big Game Hunter 2012 but i chose to upload Armored Core V, when that's seeded for a bit i'll post the game :)"
,Chrisva,2012-03-24T19:10Z,"Hi,

I checked the game with latest v of abgx360 1.0.6
It says that basic stelth check pased, but verification failed and autofix failed (did not fined the ini file in the online database), so stelth still is unverified. 

Do I do anything wrong or is it something wrong with the iso? T"
,madog9393,2012-03-29T20:12Z,"The abgx check DOES fail the autofix/verification check so it might NOT be safe to play it online, works in single player mode perfectly.
If you want to play it online wait for an abgx update or something until it passes.
Thanks for the upload mate, keep up the good work! Will seed for a week or so "
