For XVID AVI with MP3 audio, I think the capper deserves:
V=9
A=8 (128 is a little low for my taste)
.
From the twisty winding tunnels deep beneath UseNet, I bring you:
Someone else's Rip in glorious XVID AVI
Only the filename was changed to protect the inno ... aw, heck,
Just to claim credit for bringing it to you ... (by request)
