Julian Edwin "Cannonball" Adderley (1928-75) moved to New York in the mid 1950's

after teaching music in a Florida high school.

The first 5 tracks here are his debut recordings........... as a stand in.


Less than 2 weeks later "Cannonball" returned to Rudy Van Gelder's as leader

of a quintet, recording SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION and other tracks #6-#10


The dates of these 1955 recordings is uncertain but the quality of the music isn't.

Kenny Clarke, Paul Chambers and brother Nat Adderley perform on all tracks.

Cannonball sits out on track #6.
