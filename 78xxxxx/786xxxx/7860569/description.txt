When legendary blues and Jazz singer Etta James died of leukemia in January 2012, she left behind millions of mourning fans, one of whom was critically acclaimed and highly talented Soul singer Leela James. And although the two weren't related, Leela was so impacted by her idol's passing that she decided to record a full album of remakes of Etta's songs. The result, Loving You More ... in the Spirit of Etta James, is not only a loving and respectful tribute to one of the best singers in American history, it's an album that Etta herself would likely be flattered by and proud of. Loving You More, is a fitting homage to Etta's musical legacy.

There literally is not a missed opportunity or a bum note in the whole project. Short, volcanic, and totally uncompromising, much like its mother, the project leaves listeners wanting more and pressing repeat again and again. Etta would be proud. Highly Recommended.


These legends are sometimes forgotten and we got to keep them alive because in my opinion, they represent what music really is and what music is suppose to be. When they are physically no longer with us, their soul is still here so we I feel like itâ™s a duty to keep stuff in peopleâ™s face and this how Iâ™m doing it. This is how Iâ™m keeping her soul in peopleâ™s faces. - Leela James
