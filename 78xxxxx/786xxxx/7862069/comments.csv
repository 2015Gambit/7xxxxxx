Is there a way to fix or work around this ? Im using Windows 8 Pro .
Please help me."
,thewongg,2012-11-28T02:31Z,"Heads up:
This program dials home every time you first open it.  This will prevent the crack showing ""never expire"" in the license window.  Either block DVDFab in your firewall, or disconnect the internet when opening the DVDFab.  Note: blocking DVDFab will make it take longer for the program to open, but it will eventually open.
Another note: this version does crash occasionally,  cracked or trial version.  It has nothing to do with the crack itself.
I am using Windows 7 64bit."
