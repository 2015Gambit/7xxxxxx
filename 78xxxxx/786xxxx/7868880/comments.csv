Hey dude. Thanks for mentioning that it works on update 1.3. The update 1.4 is too large for my taste, so i was not gonna download this DLC if it didn't work with the older 1.3 update. :)"

Are you sure you installed it in the correct directory? For example my install directory somehow ended up to be ""D:Mass Effect 3Mass Effect 3"". So I needed to place the files one level lower. After I did that, the message popped up on the terminal. And that was right before Priority: Cerberus"
,ThereIsNoHiddenMeaning,2012-12-02T20:32Z,"Thanks for the upload, Do you happen to have the alternate appearance pack 1? It was released a few days before Omega but i can't find a torrent of it anywhere."
,nyxleviat,2012-12-02T20:42Z,Is anyone else getting an APPCRASH error when Dock 42 is loading? This is rather unfortunate. 
,Fantomnz,2012-12-03T08:50Z,"Hi All & Thanks scene4all Again!!!!
