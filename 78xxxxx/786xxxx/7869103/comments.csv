,FlyingMilkan,2012-11-29T04:02Z,"@DragonWand, wtf are you talking about lol"
,Oblivilot,2012-11-29T04:36Z,"DragonWand is posting these fake 'porn' comments on a variety of recently uploaded torrents. It goes without saying that this upload is 100% legit, and not porn at all. The name BOZX represents consistency and quality.

Of 'DragonWand', we know only this:

The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonourâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;d, and unsung. "

,2HardRain,2012-11-29T08:01Z,"@Oblivilot, that was rather poetic!"
,Oblivilot,2012-11-29T16:16Z,@2HardRain - best scene in 'Groundhog Day'!! It's from that part where Andie MacDowell recites that poem to Bill Murray's character. The poet is Sir Walter Scott : 'Breathes There The Man'

,Glenn_K9,2012-12-02T05:38Z,"Amazing quality very well done.  Move equally as awesome.  The Chinese part you should turn on your subs as there is an important exchange to the movie.  This was one of the best qualities I've seen on Pirate Bay and I've been here years.
