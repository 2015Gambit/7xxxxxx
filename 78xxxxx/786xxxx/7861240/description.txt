Uncovering the history of the nuclear arms race and revealing the many occasions when the world's superpowers have been on the verge of all out nuclear war. 
Explore how close the world has come to a massive holocaust. Blunders, brinkmanship, mad generals, bad computers, stray bombers & accidental launches have brought us to the edge of Armageddon.
For the first time ever, Doomsday tells the story of our many close calls with nuclear apocalypse.
Hiroshima. August 6, 1945: the atomic bomb explodes. More than 70,000 dead and much more wounded. In that day, humanity discovered the power of nuclear weapons, and discovered too the fear. When a few years later the H-Bomb exploded in the Pacific Ocean, fear and panic grew in an alarming way, and for the next 50 years and during The Cold War, there would be unbelievable occassions when all of humanity was almost lost in a nuclear apocalypse. In this documentarty, some military and war experts explain how the human race was almost extinguished in a nuclear holocaust. A very real danger that still exists today...
