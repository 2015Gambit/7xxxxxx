The Rolling Stones created rock history with this legendary concert recorded in
London on 11th December 1968. Originally shot for TV, the Rock and Roll Circus
brings together major artists of the time including The Rolling Stones; John Lennon
and Yoko Ono; Eric Clapton; The Who; Marianne Faithful; Jethro Tull and Taj Mahal.

THE ROLLING STONES ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS documents a December 1968 show, originally
intended for broadcast on British television, that featured clowns, acrobats, tigers,
a fire-eater, the Rolling Stones and a menagerie of musician friends that included
the Who, Eric Clapton, John Lennon and Yoko Ono. The show never aired. The Stones,
unhappy with their performance, shelved it. A clip of the Who performing ΓÇ£A Quick
One While HeΓÇÖs AwayΓÇ¥ made it into the documentary ΓÇ£The Kids Are AlrightΓÇ¥, but the
rest of the show remained on the shelf until the 1996 release of a laser disc, video,
and this soundtrack.

The Stones put together this circus shortly after releasing BEGGARΓÇÖS BANQUET.
Ringmaster/producer Mick Jagger recruited the above friends along with Marianne Faithfull,
Taj Mahal and the relatively-unknown Jethro Tull. Twenty hours of filming resulted in a
production that alternates between vaudevillian spectacle and magical rock and roll
performances. Especially noteworthy is a blistering version of the BeatlesΓÇÖ ΓÇ£Yer BluesΓÇ¥
by the Dirty Mac, a supergroup featuring John Lennon on rhythm guitar and vocals,
Eric Clapton on lead, Keith Richards on bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums.
