Comfy Partition Recovery

Comfy Partition Recovery was created as an all-in-one solution for recovering deleted files. The program is truly universal, since it recovers all types of files: digital images, archives, text documents, video and music files, executable files and so on. The tool recovers data lost after quick or full formatting, deletion of logical partitions on hard drives, flash drives and memory cards. The software will recover the structure of your disk after file system errors and corruption of the boot sector.

The program meets all safety requirements for data recovery. When scanning a drive and recovering files, it doesnΓÇÖt write anything to it, thus protecting deleted files from overwriting. When working with a damaged or faulty hard drive, it is very important to keep the number of read operations as low as possible. In such cases, the program allows you to create a virtual copy of the damaged disk and continue recovering data from it.

You can download the hard drive recovery program for free. A detailed help file and a built-in step-by-step wizard will make data recovery a task that even inexperienced users will have no problems with. The tool supports all types of drives: hard drives, memory cards, USB drives. It recovers files from desktop and laptop computers or any USB devices connected to the userΓÇÖs system via USB. The tool supports 32- and 64-bit versions of Window. Finally, Comfy Partition Recovery works with all versions of FAT (VFAT, FAT16, FAT32) and NTFS (3, 4, 5, 6) file systems.
