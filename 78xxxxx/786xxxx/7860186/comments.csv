A question"" Do you happen to know where the titles Feral #9 on and 
Crossed:Bandlands 17 on can be obtained?
"
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-26T19:34Z,It doesn't look like Ferals #9 or Crossed Badlands #17 have been scanned yet.  Danger usually scans Ferals and The Red Assassin usually scans Crossed Badlands.
