Remember the time that GAME OF THRONES guy wrote an X-MEN comic?

The same one where STEPHEN KING scripted three pages drawn by BERNIE WRIGHTSON?

In 1985 Marvel Comics published what I believe is still the single most successful charity comic book ever, HEROES FOR HOPE STARRING THE X-MEN. Raising money to help relieve famine in Africa, the greatest comic book writers (including CHRIS CLAREMONT, STAN LEE, ALAN MOORE, DENNY O'NEIL, JIM SHOOTER, and JIM STARLIN) and artists (including BRENT ANDERSON, BRIAN BOLLAND, JOHN BOLTON, JOHN BUSCEMA, JOHN BYRNE, FRANK MILLER, JOHN ROMITA JR., CHARLES VESS, and BERNIE WRIGHTSON) were joined by novelists HARLAN ELLISON, STEPHEN KING, and GEORGE R.R. MARTIN in a jam-session for the ages.

Now honestly, I can tell you that this isn't the best X-Men story. It isn't even the best X-Men story of 1985 (that's probably UNCANNY #198) ... but ...

48 pages plus covers, no ads, at least $500,000 U.S. dollars raised for charity! (Adjusted for inflation, that's almost $1.1 million in 2012 dollars.)

For the record, I don't think this special is available in any Marvel or X-Men torrent on TPB. All credit to the original scanner, and I hope to see a nice re-scan in the future. This is a comic that deserves it.
