Introducing the new "World's Finest" team: Superman and...Batgirl! In the dark canyons of Gotham City, a new warrior has joined the Dark Knight. Now Superman crosses paths with the mysterious Batgirl, as does another costumed denizen of Metropolis: the Thorn! Thorn is obsessed with the Metropolis-based criminal organization called "The 100", and now that cartel is making inroads into Gotham. It's Batman, Batgirl, Superman, and Thorn on a collision course on the streets of Gotham City.
