Description:

The Prophecy Club presents Gail Riplinger on New Age Bible Versions:
Gale Riplinger's exhaustive six-year collation of new Bible versions, their underlying Greek manuscripts, editions, and editors is culminated by this video. It objectively and methodically documents the hidden alliance between new versions and the New Age Movement's One World Religion. The emerging new Christianity - with its substitution of riches for righteousness, a crown for a cross, and an imitation for a new creation - is shown to be a direct result of the wording in new versions. Gale exposes new version editors' in agreement with Luciferians, occultists, and New Age philosophy in mental institutions, s√©ance parlors, prison cells, and court rooms for heresy trials, and most shocking of all; denying that salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ.

Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
