Arcade Games V0.96+                  Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator

This is an emulator.  Simply put, it allows a PC to mimic the internal hardware of 
a large number of stand-alone arcade machines.

Since Mame32 is emulating the original hardware, 
the software thinks itΓÇÖs still in an arcade and is starting up for the first time in the morning.  
Initial diagnostic screens are run through, as well as possibly some accounting information 
presented to the arcade owner.
The game should now be running its demo/attract mode.
