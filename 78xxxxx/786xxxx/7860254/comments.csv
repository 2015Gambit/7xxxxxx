I thought I might warn but of course maybe it's just me and it's working for some.

yes, I'm anxious for my dose of treme :)"
,itsart,2012-11-26T12:43Z,"I confirm botibol's findings above, this file won't open with any player one cares to throw at it "
,Barthanol,2012-11-26T17:33Z,"File is unplayable in VLC or Windows Media Player, I have all current codecs, don't waste your time as we have with ours."
