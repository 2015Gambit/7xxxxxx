"Passport to Magonia" By Jaques Vallee

UFO's + Folklore

Over two decades ago, eminent scientist Vallee wrote a provocative book about alleged UFO landings, folklore, and certain unexplained phenomena. "To a certain extent, this is a shocking book, and it should be." --from the Preface French ufologist Jacques Vallee's 1969 book did shock a lot of people. UFO believers were already familiar with Vallee. As one of the few scientists who had written detailed and careful analyses of UFO sightings that indicated that the witnesses were neither mistaken nor lying, he was seen as a valuable asset for their position. They looked forward to more of the same in his latest book.What they got was something quite different. As Vallee himself said in the preface, Passport to Magonia was not a scientific book. In reading older books, Vallee had noticed a curious correspondence between stories that were hundreds of years old and those he was investigating in the late 1960s.
