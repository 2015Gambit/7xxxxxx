Couple tips for downloaders: It took 3 attempts to get this torrent, kept coming in as a single unsupported file. it does work, don't give up it is a good torrent!. when unzipping them do one at a time or you will get an error telling you that they are corrupt. Stuffit finally did the trick though after explorer and winzip failed"
