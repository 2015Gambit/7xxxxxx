Recap:
In an effort to liven things up at his amusement park, Fischoeder focus-grouped some new attractions with the Belchers, and Bob suggested an attraction centered around the fictional movie The Deepening, a shark attack movie from the 1980s that was filmed in the town. Which, really, wasn't that bad of an idea. Fischoeder purchased the mechanical shark from the film (despite the cryptic protests of Teddy, who played Handsome Lifeguard #3) and set it up and let it run at his park.
The kids knocked over the sharkΓÇöLouise needed the mechanical shark fin to sell for mechanical shark fin soup, because, you know, the merciless finning of sharks is ripe for comedy... even if the joke was in keeping with Louise's general insanityΓÇöand it flopped through town, causing mass destruction.
The rest of the episode was a series of amusing attempts to stop the rampaging shark, including traffic spikes (that stopped drunk Shriners), an oil slick, and a big hole, the latter of which allowed the shark to chomp its way into the Belchers' restaurant. Bob, Teddy, and Mort headed in to stop the monster, ultimately pulling the lever on Chekov's ice cream machine.
It was a funny enough send-up of Jaws, complete with dolly zoom effects (which are commonly credited to the film, but actually first appeared in Vertigo), and I really appreciated Bob's "Really?!" at Teddy's quoting the movie's infamous "We're gonna need a bigger boat." I likewise dug Tina's 1980s- and Free Willy-inspired friendship ballad dream sequence, especially the removal of the friendship bracelet from the bitten-off hand.

Ok, well, as usual, MP4 file, 23.976 fps, blah blah, just enjoy. ^^
