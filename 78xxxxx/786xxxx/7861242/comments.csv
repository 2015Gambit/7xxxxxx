,Longhorn93,2012-11-26T19:03Z,"Thanks for all your work this season @footy. My first season with F1, now I am hooked for life. Getting the torrents from you have played a big part in that. Especially posting BBC and Sky for options. And love the Inside Grand Prix.
Thanks. See you ext year."

Anyway, thanks footy AND seeders."
