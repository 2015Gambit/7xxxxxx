Nick Slaughter, an ex-RCMP and DEA agent, who had dropped out of society after being fired from his job, relocates to the Florida town of Key Mariah to start a detective service. In the process he meets Sylvie Gerard, a local travel agent. Together they form a strong partnership and quite the detective team. However, the local police squad never made it easy so they often require help from their friends: Ian, Spider (owners of the Tropical Heat Bar at different times) and Rollie (local police mortician). The Town of Key Mariah will never be the same again thanks to Nick Slaughter and company.
