At just 24-years-old, versatile, bilingual lyricist Snow Tha Product is proving that there are no boundaries to her songwriting or performance abilities. She has established herself as an artist to watch, flexing electrifying, aggressive verbal acrobatics. Now signed to Atlantic Records, Snow is preparing her Good Nights & Bad Mornings mixtape for release this Fall.

In August 2011, Snow released her aptly-titled project Unorthodox in conjunction with Street Science Entertainment and her own Product Entertainment, preceded by the Unorthodox 0.5 mixtape hosted by DJ Whoo Kid. Currently on iTunes, Unorthodox is filled with original production from the likes of SuperStar O (Jim Jones, Waka Flocka, Wiz Khalifa), Florida beatmaker RedHook Noodles, California duo The Nominees, Texas multi-talent Essay Potna, Keise on da Track (Lil Boosie) and more.

Born to illegal immigrants, Snow tha Product grew up in both North and South California, and currently resides in Ft. Worth, Texas. Despite her remarkable talent, Snow sees herself as a ΓÇÿnormalΓÇÖ girl who wants to relate to people who hear her music.

With no formal promotion, SnowΓÇÖs video for ΓÇ£Drunk LoveΓÇ¥ is over one million views on YouTube, and received support from the national Mun2 networkΓÇÖs 18 & Over. Amongst all of her fierce viral videos, ΓÇ£Woke WednesdayΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Holy Sh*tΓÇ¥ caused quite a stir in 2011, racking up nearly 400k views each at the turn of the new year.
