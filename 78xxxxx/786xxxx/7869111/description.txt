On April 23, 1967, Prisoner #416J, an inmate at the notorious Missouri State Penitentiary, escaped in a breadbox. Fashioning himself Eric Galt, this nondescript thief and con manΓÇöwhose real name was James Earl RayΓÇödrifted through the South, into Mexico, and then Los Angeles, where he was galvanized by George WallaceΓÇÖs racist presidential campaign.

On February 1, 1968, two Memphis garbage men were crushed to death in their hydraulic truck, provoking the exclusively African American workforce to go on strike.
