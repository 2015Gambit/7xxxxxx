Recap:
In theory, thereΓÇÖs nothing wrong with the surreal conceptual jokes in ΓÇ£Turkey Pot Die.ΓÇ¥ Like Seth MacFarlaneΓÇÖs two other mock-sitcom cartoons, The Cleveland Show thrives on deflating viewersΓÇÖ expectations. Ostensibly, having Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington and filmmaker David Lynch respectively play an over-protective, anthropomorphized mother bear and a bartender is funny because thereΓÇÖs no precedent for it. ItΓÇÖs not just a random choice; itΓÇÖs funny because itΓÇÖs a totally natural random chance thatΓÇÖs that much more strange because thatΓÇÖs the status quo on The Cleveland Show. So by the time you get to ΓÇ£Turkey Pot Die,ΓÇ¥ the fourth episode of the showΓÇÖs fourth season, itΓÇÖs a given that Lynch, the writer/director of the nightmarish Eraserhead, is an awkwardly surly local fixture, while Huffington, multi-hyphenate and proud exploiter of ΓÇ£citizen journalists,ΓÇ¥ is DonnaΓÇÖs catty maternal foil. The fact that could be construed as normal is, theoretically, funny. But only in small doses.

There is more, but I'm really busy.
