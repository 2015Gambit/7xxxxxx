,will409,2012-11-29T02:03Z,"For reasons unknown everyone is stuck at 22%.
Please seed. Thank you."
,GeorgeWest,2012-11-29T02:29Z,I'm not a law student but I have enjoyed others in this series. Please put up other subjects if you got 'em. I'm also stuck on 22% for this one.
,will409,2012-11-29T05:14Z,"How are there two seeds when a group of us are stuck at 27.9% ? It makes no sense.
Can somebody do something?"
,Incantana,2012-11-29T17:53Z,Can someone PLEASE upload femings property? Im a 1L and this would be GOLD right now. Thank you!
,will409,2012-11-29T19:06Z,Wow over night we reached 53.4%. That's incredible for a 94 MB file!!! What the heck is going on here???? Can any one tell me?
,will409,2012-11-30T00:05Z,"Well thought took forever. But it did finally finish.
Thank you for sharing this information.

I am in this class right now and that is why I have been trying to get your attention for the last two weeks. I understand that you were busy studying but when you're desperate you're desperate. I was a day away from actually purchasing it because I did not get any responses to my initial inquiries.

Well I hope you find the Con Law 2 useful. 
(It was my first full torrent.)
I certainly found Civ Pro 1 useful and that is why I was hoping to get Civ Pro 2 asap. 

Man did it take forever to complete!
Anyhow thanks again for sharing. 
I am glad I was able to help you out. 
You certainly helped me out."
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-30T09:11Z,"Will: Yeah, no problem.

ace0rzz: I'd prefer agency/partnership or community property. If you could get your hands on one of those I'll meet you with any two from this series:

Flemings Constitutional Law I
Flemings Constitutional Law II
Flemings Contracts I (Outline Only)

Flemings Torts II"
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-30T09:14Z,Will: these were my first torrents too. Glad I could pop your cherry. thanks you for the information too.
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-30T09:16Z,"Will: Btw, civ pro I and II in the same semester? Or just trying to get hold of this before next semester? In any event, I didn't think it was so urgent for you."
,will409,2012-11-30T11:24Z,Well the way my school is doing it: it is the whole enchilada all at once. So my midterm (Nov.) was up through civil pro 1. Now the rest of the course is civil pro 2 ending in a final in January. So urgency was a factor. Thanks again for the info.
,will409,2012-12-01T20:32Z,"Hello there 
I think it would be nice if you could put up Con Law 1 - that way people may have a complete set of constitutional law. Con Law is a difficult subject so it would be a very nice offering. Let us know what you are planning to do. Thanks."
