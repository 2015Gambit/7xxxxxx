Luigi Francis Shorty Rossi, the tough-talking, fedora-wearing star of Animal PlanetΓÇÖs hit show Pit Boss, may stand only four feet tall but that hasnΓÇÖt stopped him from living large, becoming a successful businessman and an outspoken advocate for pit bulls, the most misunderstood breed of dog in the world.

A third generation dwarf, ex-gang member, and ex-con, Shorty knows what itΓÇÖs like to be misunderstood and in this candid memoir, he shares his personal story for the first time. No one expected Shorty to live let alone succeed, and yet he has, overcoming every challenge, from an abusive home to the violent streets and gangs of South Central LA, to the notorious cell blocks of Folsom Prison where he was imprisoned for attempted murder.
