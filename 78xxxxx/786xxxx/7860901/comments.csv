Thank you for not raring the whole thing in one big boulder."
,NeoThe1,2012-11-26T12:15Z,"thegreenfrog, thanks for the explanation. Through trial and error I figured out that I was getting the dreaded ""Error 4"" for two reasons: the torrent contained 2,249 files (before I RARed them by category) and the description in the .torrent file itself was too long (I removed it altogether for now, but I'm curious as to how many characters are allowed in there)."
