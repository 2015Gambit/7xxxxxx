[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-26T05:04Z,"If you look at last week's comments, there's some discussion of this. I just know it shows up magically and I pass it along.

Two weeks ago I was VERY suspicious, so I went and looked and every episode starts with a different ""last time on ..."" and since it wasn't a dupe, I took a chance that it was real ...

And it was.

I think something about gift horses seems appropriate here, lacking any true information.

Enjoy,

btw, is there anyway u can upload Oliver Stone's Untold History?  "

cindy25 - What I haven't seen mentioned is that the first instance of early posting has consistently been ""Once Upon A Time"". It starts showing up at 4pm for me on the west coast of the US, which at best means someone recorded, edited and completely posted it by 7pm Eastern, a full hour before evening programs start.

Maybe there's a hidden 51st state mid-atlantic? The Canada suggestion doesn't work as they have the same time zones as the US. I think daylight savings is nearly universal, but we're talking more than an hour here.

Ah, such sweet mysteries of life. Maybe some employee of the media company is feeding us stuff before it airs? Shh... don't tell nobody ...

Sorry, forgot the Oliver Stone question ...

sadly, like tonight's ""Talking Dead"", there is nothing beyond ep 1, of which there seems to be an XVID here already.
