Sрringеr | 2010 | ISBN: 3642128238 9783642128233 9783642128240 | 998 pages | PDF | 18 MB

This book gives an unparalleled, up-to-date, in-depth treatment of all kinds of flow phenomena encountered in centrifugal pumps including the complex interactions of fluid flow with vibrations and wear of materials. The text focuses on practical application in the industry and is free of mathematical or theoretical ballast. The book is focused on fostering this understanding which will benefit the pump engineer in industry as well as academia and students.

The scope includes all aspects of hydraulic design, 3D-flow phenomena and partload operation, cavitation, numerical flow calculations, hydraulic forces, pressure pulsations, noise, pump vibrations (notably bearing housing vibration diagnostics and remedies), pipe vibrations, pump characteristics and pump operation, design of intake structures, the effects of highly viscous flows, pumping of gas-liquid mixtures, hydraulic transport of solids, fatigue damage to impellers or diffusers, material selection under the aspects of fatigue, corrosion, erosion-corrosion or hydro-abrasive wear, pump selection, and hydraulic quality criteria.
The 2nd ed. has been enhanced by hydraulic design information on axial pumps and sewage pumps, turbine performance curve prediction, torsional rotor vibrations and recent research results on partload flow and hydraulic excitation forces.
