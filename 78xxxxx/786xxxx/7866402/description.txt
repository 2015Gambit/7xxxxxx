For those of you who are having the gamesave corruption issues, here are my gamesaves from Sequences 6-10. They are far from 100% and I kind of rushed through them, but it's better than starting over.

Copy the sequence you need and paste into:

C:Users(you)AppDataRoamingThetaOrbit

When you're done it should look like this:

C:Users(you)AppDataRoamingThetaOrbit54(1&2 save)

I don't think it matters if your folder is 54 or 103, just paste the saves into whichever one you have.

This will ONLY work if the above is already your save directory. If you are using the Skidrow crack or any other that keeps your saves in another location, these will NOT work for you.
