,believe65,2012-11-26T04:53Z,Thanks for these.
,Godsbestsinner,2012-11-26T04:57Z,Moron! Nobody wants a 4.34gig file of tonight's episode ... 4.34gigs for a 45 min episode? How fucking retarded!
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-26T05:04Z,No problem.
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-26T05:05Z,"@Godsbestsinner
Go somewhere else if you're too dumb to realize what this file is, ""moron."""
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-26T05:48Z,"And by the way, since it was posted, apparently over 3,000 people want it. So you're beat, kid."
,xKromatics,2012-11-26T05:54Z,"There's always somebody complaining about these. I find it funny. Anyway, thanks for this."
,Shinnyx,2012-11-26T06:31Z,"@Godsbestsinner

This is a 1080p download, what do you expect?
Seriously... -.-'

Thanks SecTPB !"

Every week it's always someone. That's why I love checking back on comments, to see the stupid things that pop out of some peoples' mouths, just so I can reply for my own amusement lol... and you're welcome. 

@Shinnyx
You're welcome! Enjoy. Great episode!"
,maur0,2012-11-26T11:02Z,what more good image web-dl 1080p using 1.6gb or this release 1080i using 4gb?
,dubblue4,2012-11-26T11:26Z,thanks
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-26T11:39Z,"@maur0
This is a TS, meaning it's a transported stream directly from the broadcast that aired. Same exact quality as aired on TV. There's no way of getting better than that."
,doodleb,2012-11-26T22:38Z,Thanks! Glad we have a dedicated person for 5.1 1080p goodness :)
,books64,2012-11-26T23:28Z,Thank you much! 
,heatcool,2012-11-26T23:39Z,"great work man, ignore the idiots /godsbestsinner ....etc/"
,Nitrousbird,2012-11-27T00:36Z,"@Godsbestsinner:  We understand you are one of those broke dick idiots watching on your crappy laptop and can't see the difference in quality from a 500MB file to a 5GB file.  For those of us with real TV's the quality difference is huge.  I'll take the longer download to watch these high-quality videos with proper surround sound, especially since most uploaders are awful at compressing video."
,xdamien,2012-11-27T02:30Z,"LOL @ Godsbestsinner

Someone ban him from posting comments please."
,diawkdfi,2012-11-27T02:44Z,"Many people still don't know the different between 1080p (progressive) and 1080i (interlaced).  That's fine.  Ignorance has always been its own punishment.  You know.. it used to be HARD to look up facts.  You had to drive to a place filled with processed dead trees called a ""library""."
