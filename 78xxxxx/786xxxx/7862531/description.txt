The follow-up to the now classic "Kraven's Last Hunt" story, arc. Written again by J.M. DeMatteis and drawn by Mike Zeck, with inks by Bob McLeod. In this story, Spider-Man is confronted by Kraven's ghost. Unsure what to make of this apparition, Spider-Man goes to Kraven's grave, where he sees an apparition that appears to be Death. Death tells Spider-Man that he and Kraven share a spiritual bond, and that Kraven's soul cannot find the peace it craves because of Kraven's suicide. Spider-Man is then forced to confront Kraven's body from the grave.
