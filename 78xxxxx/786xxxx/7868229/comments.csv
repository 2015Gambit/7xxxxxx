,oksorry,2012-11-28T23:55Z,when I try to install the game (run setup) it requires a CD key before installation. How do I stop this? thanks :)

No offense but you are doing it wrong. I've personally used this and there are plenty of other people using the reloaded torrent and this crack that got it to work.

Read ""lilwekim""'s post on http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7869515/Far_Cry_3-RELOADED"
,ant3dgg,2012-11-30T09:07Z,"no, not working"
,VooWorm,2012-12-01T10:37Z,"Man, stop giving hope. Crack doesnt work at all..."
[T],swebarb,2012-12-01T10:59Z,looks like the game doesnt run on xp then.. but the specs says its supported bah.... how lame is this

Well help us then, I'm trying my best to understand if I'm doing something wrong. I used this one alone, I used both crackers at the same time, I used the -offline on shortcut, I updated before putting the crack, I even stopped my internet connection when I tried to play but it still deleted my saves. Furthermore, the orbit directory or the directory inside the ubisoft luncher were missing. Any Idea?"
,retsknub,2012-12-02T06:00Z,"@swebarb No offense, but why the hell are you still running XP? You're going to run into this roadblock so much from here on. It's like someone complaining that a game doesn't support Windows ME. 

Regardless, I haven't gotten a crack to work yet. Saves don't save. I've played the intro sequence 4 times now. Looks like this one is in line with the rest."
,14luidh2,2012-12-02T14:11Z,"@Retsknub - Make a shortcut from 'Farcry.exe'

Then left click on the shortcut, and then properties. Add at the end of 'Target' ' -offline' (with a space in front).

Then put in all the stuff from this crack into the Reloaded crack, then play. Should work X)"
