,fistanleydo,2012-11-30T16:17Z,Please read this. It looks like the asshats are back trying to get extremes skull removed by giving -1's.  Please do your part if you enjoy extremezone's work and always give +1's.
,intrnetuffguy,2012-12-01T05:09Z,thanks man you deliver as always and if you havent heard yet all extremes shit is legit dont even ask 
,Scorpicore,2012-12-01T10:19Z,"Just because he has a skull, doesn't mean that its 10/10... Got a few crappy ones from VIP's and Trusted uploaders in the years that has passed. Only way to check the quality, is to DL it."
,jman93,2012-12-02T02:46Z,"*****WARNING! READ!*****

My friend was recently caught downlading this movie because Screen Gems Studios was (and still may be) monitoring this torrent and contacting ISP's. My recommendation is to watch it on Movie2k.com; it is much safer. BEWARE!"
,agnu,2012-12-02T07:43Z,"Thanx ez. All those who are giving -1's, get a life!"
,Vwaldi,2012-12-02T10:08Z,"good torrent, but better wait for YIFY upload, better quality and half the size"
