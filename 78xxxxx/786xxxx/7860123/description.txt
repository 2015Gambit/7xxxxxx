Threat of Peace unveils a galaxy on the brink of destruction three hundred years after the events of Knights of the Old Republic!

For decades, the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire have been at war-the Sith have gained control of the Outer Rim, but their efforts to penetrate the Core Worlds have so far been thwarted. Now, representatives from both sides attempt to negotiate a peace treaty-but deception by the Sith puts the Jedi in an unfortunate position.

One of the Republic's elite spies, Theron Shan, embarks on an assignment to uncover dark secrets that could shatter the fragile peace with the Sith and plunge the galaxy back into war!

An old Jedi, Ngani Zho--once Theron's mentor, and formerly thought lost in Sith territory--has returned quite a bit more peculiar than before he left . . . Unfortunately, he is the only one who can guide Theron on his mission. Quickly, Theron's hands are full with Zho, a troublesome thief, and the Sith who never should have let that old Jedi return to the Republic!
