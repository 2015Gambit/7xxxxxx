"Vengeance Dance Explosion" has landed: 20 perfectly composed and mixed hands-up hymns as extensive construction kits, FX, MIDIs and vocals! All areas of HandsUp are here! Rock hard "4 on the floor" beats, melodic "euphoric" hooks, strong shuffled / groove quantized sequences, chart compatible vocal pop, commercial electro vs. HandsUp melodies - all combined in one magnificent sample pack! All the loops are 128 BPM to 144BPM, each available as dry (no FX) and wet (with FX), as well as with and without sidechain (where applicable). All kits have an obvious root key and are thus easily interchangeable and combinable. For completely personal adaptation or editing, all the melodies are also included as MIDI files! Above and beyond all that, this sample pack also includes a bonus folder filled with one-shot vocals.
