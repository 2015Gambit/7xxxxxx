,JustRacey,2012-11-26T18:35Z,"Thanks from an American living in the Philippines. If it weren't for TPB and uploaders like you I think I would go insane living here. Making American TV, music and movies available for uploading in foreign countries IS the BEST foreign relations tool were could ever possibly have! When will our government actually realize this? Asians are always asking me ""Is it really like what it shows in tv and movies in the US?"" I almost always say yes, both the good and the bad. They are astounded that we are able to so vocally able to criticize our  government & leaders in the press and not get shot or thrown in jail. It makes them THINK and want more freedoms for themselves."
,ENHannigan,2012-11-26T19:57Z,Thank you very much. Your efforts are much appreciated by everyone in my household.
,m3nt4t,2012-11-27T18:25Z,"@JustRacey Wow, what an ignorant & jingoist comment. If what you said were true, you should know you have more freedom there than in the US. You can't DL thru TPB in the US without getting warnings from the feds."
