George Clarke's Amazing Spaces 
George Clarke explores the extraordinary world of small builds, where people turn tiny spaces into the most incredible places to live, work and play. He even tries making one of his own. For many the dream of having a bolt hole or a place to escape from their hectic lives can seem unobtainable. Architect George Clarke shows how such big dreams can be achieved in small and affordable places. George meets the creative people who are making homes out of shipping containers, horseboxes and old buses. Others are building tiny huts or incredible treehouses in the middle of the woods. George also undertakes a small-build property project of his own, buying a dilapidated caravan for just ┬ú300, with the aim of transforming it into a stunning second home for his growing family.


1)  Bus, Horsebox and Loo 
George meets a couple who have invested their life savings in the hope of converting a wreck of a bus into a holiday let. He also sees how an old underground toilet has been transformed into a stunning apartment and how a horsebox has been given a new lease of life as a family holiday home. And George's own caravan build gets off to a shaky start as his builder fails to see the potential in this hulk of rusting metal from the 1970s.
