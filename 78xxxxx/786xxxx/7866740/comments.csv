Here's a link to the episode list, all 6 parts and names:

Thanks for sharing, either way. I will D/L & seed if it's actually pt.3 Iron Men."
,r0ssxx,2012-11-28T09:34Z,Actually Iron Men and Empires are both episode 2 Episode 3 should be Survivors and Warriors. They air 2 episodes all in one go hence the 2 titles every week. You can think of it as either 12 1 hour episodes or 6 2 hour episode. Only The History Channel would air it as 1 two hour episode with the name changing halfway thru the program LMAO
