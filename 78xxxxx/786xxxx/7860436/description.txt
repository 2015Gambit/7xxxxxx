Fevered notes scribbled on napkins after first dates. Titillating text messages. It's-not-you-it's-me relationship-enders. In Other PeopleΓÇÖs Love Letters, Bill Shapiro has searched AmericaΓÇÖs attics, closets, and cigar boxes and found actual lettersΓÇôunflinchingly honest missives full of lust, provocation, guilt, and vulnerabilityΓÇôwritten only for a loverΓÇÖs eyes. Modern love, of course, is not all bliss, and in these pages youΓÇÖll find the full range of a relationship, with its whispered promises as well as its heartache. But what at first appears to be a deliciously voyeuristic peek into other peopleΓÇÖs most passionate moments, will ultimately reawaken your own desires and tendernessΓÇªbecause when you read these letters, youΓÇÖll find the heart youΓÇÖre looking into is actually your own.

ΓÇó "i think UR great. wanna have wine & Tequila again sometime?"
ΓÇó "I can't believe you're real, and I think about you constantly in some way or the other all day. I haven't given the finger to anyone driving since I met you."
ΓÇó "With you I learned how to fight cleaner, how to talk things out better, and how to make a strong loving family out of nothing. These are priceless gifts that I will carry with me the rest of my life. One more thing you did for me: you left, and I had to get through it."
ΓÇó "P.S. I look forward to your letters too much to call. Also, where do you stand on chains?"
