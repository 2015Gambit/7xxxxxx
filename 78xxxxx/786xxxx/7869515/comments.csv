My headphones are connected to my soundspeakers which usually works fine. Only issue I get from this convenience is that in some games I have to directly look at characters in order to hear them (guess it has something to do with stereo or whatever).

Not with Far Cry 3. I plain can't hear anything, no matter where I point my character (same applies for the intro scene).

alright, I figured out how to fix the save issue. you mount disc 2 goin into files, update the patch then copy and paste the rest into your far cry 3 app folder. it worked for me. ""

Wow. You mean you followed the instructions? I'm sure no one with save issues has thought to do that. You're some kind of magic hacker."

,lliwekim,2012-11-30T00:44Z,"Anyone with save issues, I had the same trouble. Save worked fine until I quit to desktop and actually restarted my computer, then it disappeared. 

So, I applied the patch update included in Crack folder again. 

Copied all that content to /bin folder again. 

Created a shortcut from the FarCry3.exe in /bin and added the -offline to the target for the shortcut.

I then copied over all the content from the Steam006 crack here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7868229/FAR.CRy.3.CRACK_ONLY-PROPER_STEAM006 into the /bin folder.

After that my original saves returned, and I have since been able to save again, quit, restart, and saves still there. Hope that helps anyone with the save issue. I had nothing for audio other than the weird thing that the in-game master volume was turned all the way down upon initial launch of the game, but turning it up fixed that (I sincerely hope that's not the issue everyone crying about sound is having...)

Great upload and game. Thanks EZ and the Reloaded team."

and open the crack folder

""C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftFarCry 3""
For me, this solved any and all issues with Uplay.

Be sure to right click on your desktop shortcut and to check ""Run as Administrator"" in the Compatibility tab. If you desire, add "" -offline"" without quotations at the end of your shortcut's Target Path. As the given instructions make perfectly clear, this removes unwanted Uplay menus that are useless with the crack anyway. For the less inclined, it should look something like this:

""C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftFarCry 3binfarcry3.exe"" -offline

If a file you've downloaded ever says ""corrupt"" or ""incomplete,"" there is a 99.999% chance that this is due to your download being interrupted or your connection faltering briefly. The only plausible solution is to re-download whatever files (or .iso files, etc) it says are corrupt."

1. follow instructions and install this version
2. create desktop shortcut of ""farcry3.exe"" file from /bin folder in install dir

5. download this crack:

Im still in the process of elimination but least I could say is I finally got it working. Like obliveron post over and over. 
Or what I did was simply used RELOADED crack; patched 1.01 update first. (goes w/t saying for most). THE KEY for me is shortcut -offline on target then unplug the internet. I blocked all internet access on game.exe but no use. dont know what's causing this.
I got old card 6870HD running Win7 high res, high setting no lags. So you can run it too. 
Thanks God for trainers to get back where I was fast and mostly no more intro again for the 5th time lol

I also tried to use the Steam006 crack but still nothing, Furthermore, the orbit directory or the directory inside the ubisoft luncher were missing, so there was no save directory to begin with.

After I've stumbled on some guys who were trying to run Far Cry 3 with whine and ubuntu.
Just download Assassin's Creed III reloaded crack like from gamecopyworld it's the newest crack from ACIII.
Take the ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll from there and copy paste it over the Far Cry 3 reloaded crack.

Meaning you install the patch 1.01 or just let the game be updated from uplay, then copy AC3(reloaded) ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll and FC3(reloaded) FC3.dll, FC3_d3d11.dll, orbit_api, uplay_r1_loader.dll in ""C:Program FilesUbisoftFarCry 3bin"" folder.
I'm using the default shortcut from FC3Updater with -offline parameter on XP sp3 32bit(x86) also you might wanna increase the gpu buffer in options it seemed to fix the lag if you have any, I'm using gts 250 1gb, but still get decent fps at max settings on 1440x900.
Also my saves work, but I get sometimes some crashes when I'm going through the menu too fast, like split second decisions back and worth so it kinda goes freeze, happens maybe once per few hours, might be also memory issue."

Really, I dunno how some people are having problems with this torrent...

Just install normally, run the patch1.01.exe into disk 2/crack folder, and finally copy all the files from the Crack folder in disk 2 (except the update exe)... and paste in the game installation folder 

TO REMEMBER, PASTE THE CRACK FILES  INTO THE ""BIN"" FOLDER

Far Cry 3 -> bin (PASTE HERE!!!)

So easy... you guys who are having problems need think a little...

And thanks again Extremezone for upload this great game... I'll wait the steam reduce the price to buy"

,racergsx,2012-12-01T21:48Z,"Incredibly fun game. Been playing for hours now, can't stop. Word to the wise, there's two executables, one to start the game in DirectX 9 (or maybe 10 not sure) and the other in DirectX 11. I would NOT use the DX11 exe. The DX11 version is VERY hard on even the best graphics cards. Even on low settings, on DX11, my HD 7950 still seems a little choppy, but when completely maxed out (ultra settings+max AF and AA)on DX9 (or 10 maybe), the game plays smooth as butter, the FPS stays locked at 60 all day long. ALSO, the DX11 and DX 9-10 exe's have SEPARATE SAVE LOCATIONS. Meaning, if you start the game with the DX11 exe, and get choppiness, and play for a while and then quit out to use the DX9-10 exe, you will have to restart the entire campaign. And vice versa."
,JOHN007C,2012-12-01T22:52Z,"Here is a weird problem

I used obliveron's method, except i used the dx11 version instead of the normal exe.

I got the game to load up and i was even able to watch the opening cut scene. I decided to go back to the main menu and change some graphics settings so it would look better.

I tried going to story mode and click on it and nothing happens, my mouse,keyboard, controller are locked out of the game. (I can only use Windows key, alt+tab and alt+F4 to quit game and ctrl+alt+del)
i removed the controller and i was able to use the mouse to navigate the main menu i click on story, nothing happens same thing with options the only thing i can access are the multiplayer options.

I guess i have to try to uninstall and reinstall"

,jpeter38,2012-12-02T19:55Z,"here's what you do to fix the save game issue. Create a uplay account at ubisoft.
 Run Uplay in online mode
install the game like normal from reloaded
apply patch 1.01
do not copy over crack
download crack from crack steam006 
copy the crack steam006 to both your game install folder and your game launcher folder which can be found under prgram files/ubisoft/ubisoftgamelauncher
find the exe in BIN folder called Far cry 3. 
when you click this it should come up in UPLAY. click play the game. 
from my understanding the reloaded crack does not need to be applied at all. because what we need is the cracked uplay instead. 
ALWAYS run the game from uplay. 
Also, the game wont recognize old saves, at least from my experience so start a new game using this suggestion and your saves will be there. I think it's because the saves are actually saved to Ubisofts cloud  sync. instead of the computer.  or it recognizes the save games from the cloud and not your computer. 
Good luck."

Now here is the important part... copied the crack to BOTH /bin folder AND /bin/Ori folder (I noticed that the .dll crack files are also in the /Ori folder as well, so i overwritten it also)

That worked for me... I hope it does for you too.

1 Download this torrent.
2 Mount disc one with daemon tools

5 Finish the install
6 Open the crack folder on disc 2
7 Copy all those files into the farcry3 bin folder
8 Run the farcry3 1.01 file (Updates)
9 Open the crack folder on disc 2 (AGAIN)
10 Copy all those files into the farcry3 bin folder (For the SECOND time)
11 Right click farcry3.exe and make a short cut
12 Right click the short cut and go to properties
13 Click in the target box and add at the end of the line after "" -offline
14 It should read:  blah blah farcry3 bin farcry3.exe "" -offline
15 Play the game.

-note: I also have farcry3.exe set to run as administrator still (even though that did not solve my issue, recopying the crack files did).
