Missing Sequences In US Cut

F1:1 - Swine shooting
F1:2 - Extra child
F1:3 - Close-up punch
F1:4 - Behind you
F1:5 - Worm's-eye view
F1:6 - Bloody body
F1:7 - Blood Spatter

Overcropped & Stretched

Both cuts maintain a constant aspect ratio of 2.4:1, overall the US Cut overcrops on all sides and stretches the picture; the CAN has much more picture in that regard, however it also sports a black bar on the right side. Scenes toward the end which LaBeouf and Wasikowska share, share the same aspect ratio and crop across both cuts

Colours

Self explanatory, there are only a handful of scenes where the colours are different.
