,foil1981,2012-11-29T06:22Z,"Right guys, this works fine tho takes a bit of work.

Runs great on 2 year old HD 5850@1080p almost all settings maxed.

1st thing is to install this and then do the uplay cracking which works fine if you actually read the readme.

Next is download and install the English Audio fix, 465MB one.  DO NOT delete any other files in game folder, just copy english files into correct folders.

To get English to work ingame you have to edit the gamerprofile.xml found in My docs/My games/Far cry 3.  Change language from russian to English then save and exit.

Theres also a reg edit for language change you MIGHT need but mine was already set to English, i didnt have to change anything but others might, changing: local machine/software/ubisoft/far cry 3 - Language to ""English and SKU to ENG"

Only thing is that you'll need to start a new game (as previous saves are located inside the Uplay app - which won't run with the game any more)

Download this crack 

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7869381/Far.Cry.3.CRACK.ONLY-RELOADED

It includes the patch and also the reloaded crack, so you don't need to go through Uplay anymore.

Copy all the files within the download, and replace them with the files in the install directory (bin). Play the game then, and it should have 1.01 in your main menu. No need to install anything.

P.S - you will need to start a new game as the saves are no longer saved within the Uplay app.

You can try copying the saves from that to C/Programdata/Orbit/46 and see if that works. Don't know if it will though"
