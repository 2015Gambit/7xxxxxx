,BlueMagicMoon,2012-11-27T02:19Z,"Many thanks!!!!

After 1&2 it went downhill from there....no one could fill Macaulay Culkin shoes...."
,dsmith7681,2012-11-27T03:46Z,great quality
,trace535,2012-11-27T03:48Z,Home Alone 1 and 2 were directed by Chris Columbus with scripts written by John Hughes and the soundtrack by John Williams. That was a dream team right there.
,iamchrislechat,2012-11-27T03:53Z,they should do a home alone where macaulay culkin is the bad guy. maybe a junkie trying to break in to get money for a fix
,door3,2012-11-27T03:59Z,I think this one is tv series.
,DJ_Pix3lbot,2012-11-27T12:20Z,"1 was AWESOME, 2 was GREAT, 3 was BOTCHED, and 4 was PURE HORSE SH*T! I doubt this one is any better...

Macaulay Culkin, we miss you so much. Please come back and save your beloved movie series from Cheap Crappy Sequel Hell! Just make sure you don't let Shrek out by accident!!!"
,love7hate,2012-11-27T17:19Z,"imdb says that this movie is not yet released ?
Spam ?"
,Ace.The.Bat.Hound,2012-11-27T18:18Z,"I have a feeling this will be really really painful to sit through but thanks for the upload I didn't even know of this movies existence 

@iamchrislechat
Thats actually a really cool idea but I doubt the studios are that clever and I don't think Culkin acts anymore"
,Bmack2013,2012-11-27T18:42Z,@love7hate u must be a beginner at this how could this be spam when the uploader has a glowing green skull thats only associated with trusted uploaders and is extremely hard to get so use your bandwidth and judge for yourself stop with the bitchin already thanx scene4all keep up the good work :)

,miniwaern,2012-11-28T14:13Z,"Naah, i dont know with you guys, but i would never watch a x5 sequel.. Never xD"

,norway32,2012-12-02T21:19Z,Thanks :-)
,abracadaver0,2012-12-03T06:15Z,"If you would like to see a movie where macaulay culkin is the bad guy, watch ""The Good Son""..1993 movie. He plays a great bad guy, even though he's still young there. I am pretty sad they're still milking this name, but it was a surprisingly good family movie."
