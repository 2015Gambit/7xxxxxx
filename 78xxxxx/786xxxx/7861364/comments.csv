English subs are in synch now.
Found the Nordic dvd9 but it is missing the Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish subtitles so need to find them and repair it.
That version is very nice, going make a complete dvdr, it has the old menu and the nice extras some people will like it.
And CCE12x u don't see the difference in a 9 or 5 dvd"
