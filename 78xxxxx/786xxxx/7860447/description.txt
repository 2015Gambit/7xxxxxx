A frank and witty tour of modern sexuality from a knowing young "sexpert" who's seen -- and done -- it all.
From her popular columns and website to her videos and lecture series, Tristan Taormino has garnered raves for her unabashed straight talk about sex. Now, for the first time in book form, she imparts wisdom gleaned from years of adventurous and informative sexual anthropology. As a sex educator, Tristan has listened to thousands of people's most intimate questions. In Pucker Up, she responds to those queries -- no matter how taboo -- giving honest, useful advice that doesn't shy away from sensitive topics.
All the basics are covered here, but Tristan also tackles such topics as strap-ons, female ejaculation, the latest sex toys, erotica and how it can improve your love life, and new strategies for hitting that elusive G-spot. Pucker Up is quite simply an indispensable book for anyone looking for healthy, adventuresome, mind-blowing sex.
