Release Notes:

Remastered and expanded version of t.A.T.u.'s debut album. Lena Katina
FTW. I feel that these ladies got some great harmony going on. Figures
that a few notable urban peoples have sampled t.A.T.u... Flipsyde -
Happy Birthday and Swizz Beatz for Lil Wayne - Anne. Someone should
try looping a sample based on t.A.T.u.'s Russian tracks... DJ Quik
dug up a 1980's Hindi track and it was a banger...

Dedicated to the sample collectors...
