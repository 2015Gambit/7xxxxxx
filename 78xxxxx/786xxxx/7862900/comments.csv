Could you explain how media center is activated with this please.  

Thanks for the UL sowinlibre"

A check of the downloaded folder would indicate a total file size of the full 3.4 gigs, but the included .iso was wonky, and at the given download speeds there was no way the whole thing could have made it in such a short period of time. Not sure what's the matter here, but perhaps another few pairs of eyeballs need to give this one a close looking over."
