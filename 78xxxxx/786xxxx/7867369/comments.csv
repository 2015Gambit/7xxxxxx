,vfan22,2012-11-28T16:27Z,"Why don't you ask Virginia at Fame Girls if she is happy with your contribution?

Owners of TPB don't want  contributions that hurt small, private companies like FG who struggle to defend themselves against those who violate their TOS.

,SR4T9US,2012-11-28T23:05Z,"why dont you go fuck yourself. You dont know what the ""owners"" of TPB want."
,vfan22,2012-11-29T01:48Z,"Oh wait......you are right, I don't know what the owners want.  Maybe they do want to hurt young models.

On 3 September 2012, Cambodian police arrested a co-founder of The Pirate Bay, 27 year old fugitive Gottfrid Svartholm Warg.

I can guess what he wants, and I bet it's nothing to do with hurting Fame Girls.
A little Common Sense people, and a little less greed and selfishness."

If contributions here could help small independent films why not other areas like photography? There is a reason on the homepage of tpb you see small people you never heard of. There is a reason it is nicknamed ""the promo bay"", for all the little guys to get noticed."
,helpFG,2012-11-29T18:26Z,"Wabbash, thanks for the link and thanks for your respectful comments.  You make a good point, however......
Promo Bay allows participants to choose what content is shared.  Fame Girls has struggled with haters distributing full sets for many years, long before TPB.  FG does not  want full sets shared just hours after they are published.  In the case here, you will most often see a plug for WMI, who gets income from links clicked on their site. That's income for them generated from misusing FG content.  That's income, none of which is shared with FG.  You can try to justify the misuse of FG content, but in the end, it is not something that Virginia, and the other folks at FG want.  Just ask them.  

So how twisted can you be, to tell TPB users that ""if you're not happy with my contribution then say so and I will not upload anymore! This the reason no Image tag!""

Does anyone buy that?  If so, then contact me. I've got some land in Florida for sale you might also want to buy.

TPB will evolve or perish.  I'm glad they are still in my country, but for how long?"
