,horrour,2012-11-28T02:49Z,People need to seed this!! 
,sloach,2012-11-28T02:49Z,Anyone having any luck downloading?
,Wowgamer,2012-11-28T03:15Z,No Joy here. Looks like 0 seeders to me. Nor even the uploader is seeding.
,Jalidork,2012-11-28T03:35Z,"Calm down people. There are nearly five times as many leechers as seeders. That means that everyone is likely downloading very slowly. You need the data to seed it, and people aren't getting it fast enough. A lot of people jumped onto this torrent, but it hasn't been up for 2 hours yet. I'm getting between 150 and 400 B/s. Happy New Year!"

,ariesvup,2012-11-28T15:41Z,Only says: Fixed an error causing the Tiller's guide not to load. I have downloaded this version and not have problems with the guides.
,Ulkterna,2012-11-28T17:40Z,"When I installed this version i'm still getting errors, When checking the archive ,I noticed they did 2 updates on the same day, so they had to fix something thats erroring if they rushed out a update a few mins after releasing the patched update."
,icegirl99,2012-11-28T18:50Z,This does not work on my Mac. WoW does not recognize it as an add-on. 
,accell,2012-11-28T19:09Z,Is it not TFR? When is TheFreeRevolution release?
,Cyber1982,2012-11-29T16:17Z,"THIS IS NOT -TFR-
THIS IS NOT WORKING!!!
Wow does not recognize this as a addon, it does not show in your addons list, you cannot load it in game, nice try but it was a failed attempt
 I have used all the -TFR- zygor guides, they worked perfectly, so i know how to install and use zygor and this one will not work"
,Flamebuilt,2012-11-29T17:23Z,"Eh....The guide works just fine for me. I only have one problem, which is every time I log in to a character I get an error that says:

Error loading guide MACROSDruidProwl or Mangle / Ravage
line: 4   step: 0
code: ???
error: spec Feral Combat either does not exist or belongs to the other class
Error loading guide MACROSDruidStampede Ravage

Other than that, this works perfectly."
,accell,2012-11-29T19:11Z,"@Cyber1982
try un-zip-ing it first
now i know its not TFR, and its not up to date, and people mention ""Tiller's guide not to load"" but i did some pandaria leveling with it and Tiller's dailes.
swatter did catch some errors, but it worked anyways"
,kc4vdx,2012-11-30T01:52Z,"This is working fine for me, yes I get a few error and the tillers module doesn't load but for what it is, free, it works fine

For the person who says wow doesn't recognize it, your not putting the right folder in you addons. When you unzip the file you get a folder called ""zygorguidesviewer"" that ****contains*** the ""zygorguidesviewer"" folder that you need to put in your add ons folder.

Thank you uploader!"
,qebm,2012-11-30T10:35Z,"Works fine for me, except when I log in with max-level toons as it try to open the tiller guide and I get an error."
,accell,2012-11-30T11:12Z,"@qebm, kc

try clicking -> arrow after loading Tillers. That or my tillers were alrieady loaded in 5.0.5 wow version, cus ive done tillers twice with this already.


btw, anyone heard of manavew booster and tyvoon gold? is there a way to try those in 5.1 patch?"
,Ulkterna,2012-11-30T22:13Z,"if anyone wants that tycoon addon, I managed to track down the entire manaview suite and have tested then uploaded it
