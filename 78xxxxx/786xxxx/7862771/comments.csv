,haveanotherpuff,2012-11-27T04:01Z,I agree with MagiciansFR
,michilllie,2012-11-27T07:28Z,"Yeah, I thought something was up. I'll have to try again. I wonder what it could be. Like I said, this is my first time. It's all trial and error for me. "
,michilllie,2012-11-27T10:15Z,I figured out what went wrong. I needed to convert the cda files to mp3's. I'm in the process of doing that now. Will re-up soon. 
,terrenmcconn,2012-11-27T20:16Z,"This time it worked.  You figured it out - good on you.  And thanks for the book, it looks to be a good read!  "
,terrenmcconn,2012-11-27T20:17Z,My bad - thinking of someone else.  Ooops - sorry.  
,michilllie,2012-11-27T21:06Z,I'm creating the new torrent right now. Good one should be uploaded soon. Figured a lot out and verified it works on Media Player and VLC. Thank you for your patience as I am learning.  Will post link to new one as soon as it's uploaded.  :)
,michilllie,2012-11-27T21:24Z,This one should work (I hope) http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7865600
