I have combined 3 Minecraft Maps into a ZIP file There are more Map Packs to come !!!
NOTE : I DID NOT MAKE THE MAPS, I JUST DOWNLOADED SOME MAPS THAT IN MY OPINION LOOKS AWESOME.

How to add the maps to Minecraft :
Macintosh Users : 
1. Unzip the Map Pack. (3 Folders will show up)
2. Open Finder.
3. In Finder, open your User (The one with the little house icon beside it).
4. In your User, open Library.
5. In Library, open Application Support.
6. Scroll and find the folder "minecraft" and open it
7. In the "minecraft" folder, find and open saves (if the folder doesn't exist, make one), drag and drop the 3 maps in it.
8. RUN MINECRAFT
