How We Invented the World
What are the inventions that have defined the modern era; the things that without our world would be utterly different? How We Invented the World looks at the four inventions that have had the most influence on the way we live now: mobile phones, skyscrapers, cars and aeroplanes. Each of these was not a thing in itself, created from nothing; but a series of connections, separate discoveries that came together to form the final product. Take the car: Henry Ford's adoption of the assembly line; Dunlop's invention of the pneumatic tyre and William Burton's extraction of gasoline from oil. We examine these connections and the people who made them possible.


1)  Mobile Phones 
The mobile phone has connected the modern world, but inventing it took the most beautiful woman in the world, Frankenstein's creator, the Titanic tragedy and the ultimate stroll down 6th Avenue.

2)  Skyscrapers 
The skyscraper - the ultimate symbol of power and wealth. But, incredibly, to invent the skyscraper it took a bird in a cage, a city in flames, a chance question from a college student and the humble horse and wagon.

3)  Aeroplanes 
The Aeroplane - it's made our dream of flight a reality, but the moments of genius and invention it took to invent it involved not just birds as inspiration, but bikes, a trip to the Moon and back, a pair of frozen eyeballs and two nervous breakdowns.

4)  Cars 
The car - so much more than getting us from A-B, but the eureka moments it took to invent the car we know today included a Scottish veterinarian, an ambitious wife, thousands of slaughtered animals and a terrifying experiment with boiling oil.
