Not this one though, it is a large pile of propangistic drivel intended to show how ""they"", ie USA, invented things that they definitely did *not* invent. Very strange, there's no need for anybody to ""boost"" the number of great US inventions (there are a lot of them). Here, in the first show, it's claimed that the mobile phone was an american invention where in fact the first functioning mobile phone system was swedish (in 1950) and Sweden also had the first fully working mobile network (NMT 450), many *years* before ppl in the US even dreamt about it.

Then in the second show it is claimed that the skyscraper/highrise building was an american invention. Well...no. When that building was erected in Chicago, the architect himself admitted that he had been influenced both by the Eiffel tower and the 10-floor high concrete buildings of ancient Rome and that he only put those two elements together.

I bet that, in the coming programs, ppl like Otto Lilientahl and companies like Daimler-Benz will be suitably forgotten when it comes to airplanes and cars..."
