Notes: Found a Nordic PAl DVDR9 Fuckup one subtitles missing, half working menu.
Find all SRT subtitles on the net and fix them back on the DVD9 added also English subtitle.
Fix the menu and encode it to DVD5 CCE 12 pass, avs filters enabled.
Extra filters used while encoding for the dots and noise.
Both filters set to minimum because a old movie has dots and noise.
Removing it all is a substantial change to the feel of the movie.
.
Well it comes out very nice, so enjoy this old movie.
