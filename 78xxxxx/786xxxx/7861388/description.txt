This Torrent is for the 'Instigation EP' 2011
I'm trying to find more of their stuff. Saw them at Bloodstock and a couple of times in London. This EP was a promo, but the recordings here are different recordings to what is on the '...Wasteland' album. It was limited to 100 in a card sleeve. Quite rare! I hope y'all appreciate it  My net is slow, but be patient - its worth the wait!!!! Seed please! and spread this awesome band!
