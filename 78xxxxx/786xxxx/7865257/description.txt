Cakewalk has done it again, this time taking their flagship DAW SONAR to the next level, adding tons of new features and functions. SONAR X2 is here and Eli Krantzberg is the man with the plan, showing you all of its ins and outs.

Eli begins with the basics such as basic audio and MIDI hardware setup and settings, interface overviews, bussing and auditioning loops, using the Synth Tab to browse and load soft synths and cool Time Ruler & Transport tips. Next, Eli goes deeper and gets into recording MIDI and Audio, customizing your workflow, editing in Track View, using Markers, the Track Inspector and Clip Properties.

Eli then shows you how to work with Groove Clips, the Piano Roll View, Auto-Punch Recording, Loop Recording and working with Take Lanes. Mixing is next on the menu with lessons on customizing the Console View, Multi-Port Instruments and Track Folders, working with real-time effects and effect chains.
