Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the live Monday, November 26 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex will take calls on the Mayan end-of-the-world 2012 rumor and also review the latest developments in the decelerating Israel-Gaza conflict. He will deconstruct former US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski's acclamation that a ΓÇ£resistanceΓÇ¥ movement is impeding the march towards a New World Order and Rand Paul's calls for amnesty, and will also offer a diagnosis of the prevailing brutish police thug-culture and gang-like mentality increasingly acclimating the public into submissive fear.
