General
Gnomes can be assigned to a workshop.  When a workshop has an assigned gnome, only that gnome will use it
Material filter for stockpiles
Gnomes equip the best available leather armor then the uniform is set to leather and any material
   
Fixed
Crash when stocking items
Crash clicking Remove uniform when there aren't any uniforms
Crash when loading butcher shop
Gnomes accepting jobs that have required components under water
Gnomes getting stuck in statues and pillars immediately after they are built

With Thanksgiving last week, today's patch is a little smaller than usual.  For stockpile options, individual materials will show up in the list as they are discovered.  As new materials are discovered, you'll probably want your generic stockpiles to include them and your specialized stockpiles to exclude them.  So stockpiles that have individual materials selected will exclude new materials by default and stockpiles that don't will include them by default.

I would have uploaded this earlier but it seems that my ISP blocked TPB.
I had to use VPN to be able to upload. If this situation continues I won't be able to upload Gnomoria anymore ;(
