Pepe Le Pew is a fictional character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie
Melodies series of cartoons, first introduced in 1945. A French skunk that always
strolls around in Paris in the springtime, when everyone's thoughts are of 'love',
Pepe is constantly seeking 'l'amour' of his own. However, he has two huge turnoffs
to any prospective mates: his malodorous scent, and he cannot take 'no' for an answer,
blissfully convinced that the girl is flirting with him, even when she physically
assaults him. Pepe is stereotypically French in the way Speedy Gonzales is
stereotypically Mexican.
