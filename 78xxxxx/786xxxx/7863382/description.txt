i caught the second half of this on tv and wanted to see the rest of it but i couldnt find a torrent of it anywhere. i found it on filetube and after 18 hours it finally finished. i though i would make it a little easier for the next person who wants to watch this great documentary.  

It is mystery 4.5 billion years in the making: how has our planet transformed, and why? New clues are being discovered not in volcanoes or canyons, but inside each of us. From a case of hiccups to the sensation of déjà vu to how we throw a football, quirks of the human body and mind all trace back to enormous transformations on Earth, millions and even billions of years in the past. Inside us are the keys to asteroid impacts, global mass extinctions, and shifting continents...ultimately revealing the epic story of Earth's past--and our own.
