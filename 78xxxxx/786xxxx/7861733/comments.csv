,yonostro,2012-11-26T19:44Z,what includes the DLC pack? extra missions outfits??
,fishboy11,2012-11-26T22:00Z,"everything is unlocked, you have to reach certain points in the game to access different stuff tho"
,FictionPC,2012-11-26T22:50Z,how about Blackbox? will it work?
,vizard0126,2012-11-26T23:53Z,"will it work on  ""RePack-RG Mechanics""?"
,fishboy11,2012-11-27T03:35Z,it should work with repacks
,pirconan,2012-11-27T04:07Z,"Definitely not working with Reloaded/Theta cracks (and repacks with these cracks, i have Blackbox repack and it's NOT working)

But it works if you replace R/T cracks with Skidrow's crack (dl crack only) and then install DLC Pack!

but it's NOT save game compatible."
,nikhil1911,2012-11-27T04:34Z,Does this unlock PIVOT points?

Thanks for the generous offer of free money if I let you assfuck me via e-mail for all eternity. That is just what I was looking for in the comments of a games torrent. :)

By the way, please die horribly."
