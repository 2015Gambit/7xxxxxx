In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a
recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female
photographer during the L.A. riots. Harry originally investigated
the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force
and never solved.

Now Bosch's ballistics match indicates that her death was not random
violence, but something more personal, and connected to a deeper intrigue.
Like an investigator combing through the wreckage after a plane crash,
Bosch searches for the "black box," the one piece of evidence that will
pull the case together.
