theyre such bad sharers and seeders 

its going real slow this seed out.. btw its not
good to leech of me.. cos soon I will run out again and you have to get alternative rips"
[V],psspss,2012-11-27T02:32Z,"For those having problems playing my VIDEO files.
===============================================

are you first sure the file is not damaged?

even though you downloaded it.. a bug in the client p2p
like utorrent or other may say its completed but
may have a missing chunk at the end or begin of the file
I use client utorrent 2.2.1 as was the best one
and still is, new clients can have bugs

also antip2p people can corrupt the file as well.. why I use peerblock 1.1

also you may have a bad fat32 or ntfs corruption and do a scandisk to be sure.. after in utorrent you
can right click on torrent and do a force re-check (it check the chunks match the hash table)

all my files will play in VLC 1.11 or higher its always tested before
upload and vlc has the codecs built-in hence why its a faster player and avoids bad codec issues

find it at videolan.org

if it says corrupted index or wont play with that you have a bad file"
[V],psspss,2012-11-27T03:20Z,"also you might need to install the K-Lite pack of codecs
and best of all is install the FFDSHOW direct show filters
which is all you need really "
