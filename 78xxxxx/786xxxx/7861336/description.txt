This is a Greek premium re-release of the original 2008 album.
But this release has 2 or 3 tracks less than the original and a different track order.




Barry White had been involved in the music business for several years, usually working in the background, before finally making the big time. His first success came via the Love Unlimited hit in 1972, Walking in the rain with the one I love. This paved the way for a series of solo recordings that yielded several major international hits.

After a promising start in 1973 with I'm gonna love you just a little bit more baby and Never never gonna give you up, Barry had his best years in 1974 and 1975. Can't get enough of your love babe, You're the first the last my everything (his only UK number one hit), What am I gonna do with you, I'll do anything you want me to, Let the music play and You see the trouble with me all proved hugely popular in many different countries. Barry's distinctive deep, husky voice was well suited to these soulful love songs.

Following those two very successful years, Barry had further hits but they were generally smaller than before. His last major American hit came in 1977 when he made the top five with It's ecstasy when you lay down next to me, which was only a minor UK hit. Nevertheless, he still had two more UK top twenty hits - Just the way you are (a cover of Billy Joel's classic song) in 1978 and Sho you right in 1987.

This compilation includes all of Barry's important British and American hits including everything I've mentioned. There are several single CD's of his music but this double CD contains a few extra goodies for those that wish to explore a little further. (Customer from Amazon)
