................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, November 27 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers a record number of firearms purchases on Black Friday as millions of citizens begin to realize a second Obama term may ultimately result in heavy restriction of the Second Amendment. 

Alex also covers a legal decision affirming the right of people to record video of the police and he tackles other important news. 

On today's show, Alex talks with tech industry wizard John McAfee who stands accused of killing his neighbor in Belize. 

Additional guests include Lord Christopher Monckton and UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Both will talk about the British state kidnapping children from UKIP members and other efforts to attack the anti-establishment political party.
