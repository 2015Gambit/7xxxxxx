,Dudu_sousas,2012-11-27T01:48Z,"@saidinho I randomly tried the user ""SKiDROW"" and the password ""password"" and worked"
,pirconan,2012-11-27T04:05Z,"Definitely not working with Reloaded/Theta cracks (and repacks with these cracks, Blackbox for example)..

But it works if you replace R/T cracks with Skidrow's crack (dl crack only) and then install DLC Pack!

but it's NOT save game compatible."
,zeroeight,2012-11-27T04:16Z,If you downloaded the Deluxe Edition then you already have the stuff that's in this torrent.
,kazpaz,2012-11-27T13:12Z,Yo Does it works with original AC3??
,VegitoDBZ,2012-11-27T13:12Z,Where do you get new items? When you play as Connor|?
,patlagik,2012-11-27T16:04Z,Can I install this if I have an original copy of the game?
,leehwgoC,2012-11-27T22:06Z,"Is there some special thing that needs to be done to import savegames?

I have found all the directories where each type of crack keeps their saves, so that's not what I mean. 

The problem is that when I rename and drop my savegames into the new directory for this unlocker's crack, in-game it tells me that the savegame is damaged and unloadable.

My saves were done with the Steam006 crack that hit the scene first (P2P) release.  The notes for this release say it's only the RELOADED/THETA saves that aren't compatible."

,leehwgoC,2012-12-02T04:58Z,"As far as I can tell, this is NOT the Digital Deluxe DLC pack.  

It only has the Benedict Arnold missions, not the other Sawtooth Sword mission, etc."
