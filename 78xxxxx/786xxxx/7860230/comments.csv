,eluent,2012-11-26T07:16Z,"If you change the file name, you won't be able to share it!
 Please don't do that. Just open the file in your software as is, or if you really need a file with mkv extension, just copy it and add the extension to the copy."
,fluffus,2012-11-26T10:29Z,Plz upload 1080p copy for this and ep. 8. They make all the difference.
,buttslaya117,2012-11-26T11:55Z,"Yep. Works great, just add the "".mkv"" that they left out."
