 Sixteen-year-old amateur motocross racer Jantz Grodzicki sustained 
 traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord injuries in a crash on 
 Friday during competition in the 250 B Mod Motocross class at the 
 41st Annual Thor Winter Olympics (also known as the Mini O's) 
 at Gatorback Cycle Park in Alachua, Florida. Jantz suffered a 
 severed spinal cord at the base of his skull and it is improbable 
 that he can recover.The body can not survive with this damage. The 
 family will most likely take him off of life support in the next 

few days. 
 Please support Jantz Grozdiki and his family through these tough 

times at 

 Thank you CBM Racing
 Godspeed #96!
