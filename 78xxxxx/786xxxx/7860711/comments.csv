,hal4000,2012-11-27T18:58Z,Thanks again for all your uploads jordan. Was waiting for this one. But man... Does it sound bad. They've mastered this so frigging LOUD. It sounds all distorted. (At least on my system.) These so-called 'engineers' have got no ears. It's about time somebody did something about this. Glad I didn't spend no money on this. I would take it straight back to the store for a refund. It really is a shame cause it seems like a solid album. Anyway thanks Jordan and please keep em comin'.

anyway, you're welcome, my pleasure."
,hal4000,2012-11-27T20:23Z,Yeah man. You're right there. But I don't think Mr. Cocker cares too much about sound quality. Few musicians actually do nowadays. It's pathetic. As long as it's LOUD it's OK for them. And man this is LOUD. Must be one of the worst sounding albums I've ever heard. (If not the worst.) This shit is what's killing music. I really don't understand how they dare to sell this. Cheers mate.
