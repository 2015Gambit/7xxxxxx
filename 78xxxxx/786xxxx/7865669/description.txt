Read Me!

I AM LIMITED TO MY BANDWIDTH. 
THERE ARE TIMES I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEED! SO PLEASE BE PATIENT!
Seeding may be staggered due to my bandwidth allocation. Seeding speed is around 10kbps to 20kbps! Don't complaint and do not PM me asking for high speed seeding, what you see is what you get! It may take sometimes for the torrent to complete, but my computer runnin' 365 days 24/7!... Enjoy!

Now y'all, when you're done please help me seed, i don't have much bandwidth & cannot seed for long, so PLEASE HELP ME SEED, Thanks y'all.
