POtHS - Christ in Music - 15 - Christmas Music Vol 3


POtHS Comments on This one: B E W A R E........... This is A lot of Music. Please remember that Christ was born in mid to late September and Dec 25th is a Pagan Holiday. Also Santa Claus is an invention of The Cocaine a Cola Company and has nothing to do with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. A Coke and Cookie and you can work all night.  ;-)

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.



Ephesians 5:11

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
