,ItsDozo,2012-11-27T04:21Z,You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this. Thank you. 
[V],Acesn8s,2012-11-27T06:26Z,I can't wait to see the people complain about the quality :D  1st off don't expect DVD/Blu-ray quality mates this film just released last week if you don't like it go to the cinemas :P
,shane3900,2012-11-27T15:11Z,V8/A8 very good copy for a cam and only a few day old. well worth time to download.
,SomeBoyFromVillage,2012-11-27T16:37Z,thnx!
,joegreg13,2012-11-27T18:46Z,I would say 8V and 6A. Th sound is fine but you can tell it does not sound perfect. What I mean is it is like 2 different sources  
,balrog814,2012-11-27T22:41Z,"Acesn8 you rock dude. I will abuse to death those, that write crap about the quality of the free uploaded torrents from you and the likes. Literally to death. They will swallow their tongues and asphyxiate from my writings, like Hannibal did :) If not, I'll catch them in the further and choke them there while they sleep:) Your work is more than appreciated in every second. Thank you very much."
,TARZ3N,2012-11-27T22:53Z,ain't no better quality than FREE quantity...mad props!!! Keep'm commin!
,Neraforesta,2012-11-28T00:07Z,"This is a genuine question I would like to know. What would be the recommendations on a cam i.e. nikon x1900, poloroid x1900, etc.. to use to go into the theaters with? Seems a lot of these are done with smartphones and such, but is there a forum that I can look to that has those actual recommendations? I'm not looking for a bunch of geek experts with their specs. I want to know the bottom line that a dumbass such as my self should know in order to do something as crazy stupid as to try n bootleg. Thanks for the feedback. :)"
,KmGa129,2012-11-28T06:36Z,Oh my gosh please seed!!!! Please please!!!
,MoviePirater,2012-11-29T04:30Z,When is pitch perfect going to be up?
,vegamax,2012-11-29T06:02Z,the sound is so not fine...the video is pretty awesome for a cam but geez you'd think someone woulda ran the audio through an eq or a filter or something...otherwise good up...sry just speaking my piece...thank you tho...it looks like a cool flick
