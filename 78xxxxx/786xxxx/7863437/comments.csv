https://thepiratebay.se/search/deals%20from%20the%20dark%20side/0/3/0

see bottom for my original xvids from canadian sources (7 episodes)

but theres still 4 more missing I think
the final was a double where he did a magic
act I believe with his weird swords and
blades :)

I see scene is recording the syfy repeats so
we should get the rest finally!"
,tisk,2012-11-27T07:36Z,Thx for the up...
[V],psspss,2012-11-27T07:45Z,theres actually 6 more (13 as listed on tvrage) for deals from the dark side so be good to get them when they air in a months time
,cancab,2012-11-27T09:26Z,"thanks a bunch eh! 
the avi for pawn are great....
I never heard of dfds show ....but I have now..
THX again!!!"
[V],psspss,2012-11-27T09:30Z,ok seeded out.. leave yas to it ;I
[V],rr-ne,2012-11-27T11:04Z,"these eps came out 1 week ago

the new ones are Sweet Pawn of Mine

and  The Offer"
[V],rr-ne,2012-11-27T11:09Z,"wikipedia is right, ive scanned through all ten eps and seen the description of some of the stuff getting sold in the correct eps"
[V],psspss,2012-11-27T11:09Z,:O
[V],psspss,2012-11-27T11:13Z,"i doubt scene is a week behind I suspect the wiki is wrong or they didnt air them cos of a storm or outsage

I suspect the titles on these look wrong though
tvrage is often wrong,, humans enter it after all ahead of time.. but thats what i use
and no biggy if they are wrong and change later"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-11-27T15:59Z,"@rr-ne wikipedia is known for turning 1 dumb person into 100 dumb people.these aired last night,I know because I watched them on tv.I just stoped by to say hi like I often do & saw the debate so I dl'd them & checked....oh,& by the way,HI :)"
[V],rr-ne,2012-11-27T17:28Z,"Did anyone else besides me know about the Special they had on november12, 13th?

They aired two eps on the 12th and 2 eps on the 13th..ihave these that match up 100% with all the descriptions of the eps.

[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-28T02:51Z,"If you're worried about your data cap, invest in a seedbox instead. I blew threw 320 GB over just a few days, but keep in mind I was uploading like 250 torrents over a few days and not your 10-15 each week lol."
[V],psspss,2012-11-28T04:59Z,"thats no good.. been through that before

you have to upload conversions to the seedbox

isps count all data ftp.web,vpn etc so your still stuff with data limit.. to pay for $50 on top for seed box might as well buy more data from isp

but im not all of us have incomes or work
some of us have health issues and put ont he scrap"
[V],psspss,2012-11-28T05:01Z,"plus seedboxes have one ip and prime target

vpns are cheaper (some) and can have many to choose from and bouse about country to counry

always best to alternate ips per torrent seed now days"
[V],psspss,2012-11-28T05:02Z,i guess your isp dont charge for uploads unlike here
,bubbanuggzz,2012-11-28T06:53Z,"@rr-ne ok,I see what your on about now.the eps. are right but the ep. numbers & titles are wrong.you'll notice your titles match up with the content of these eps. if you dl & watch them.""sweet pawn of mine""= slash's ID & ""the offer""= corry's job offer from another pawn shop.specials are hard to tag cuz one site will say they are part of new season,one will say last season & one will say new season but tag as ep00.confusing as hell to uploaders & downloaders alike"
[V],psspss,2012-11-30T07:46Z,"yeh I had thought that 2 episodes in the end of last season were part of these season and can see now
why 2 appear missing but we do have them all it seems as you say (above) easiest is just rename your episodes to match scene doing or move the other 2 from last season and push the numbers up "
