,GoodGravy,2012-11-28T12:29Z,"@nosTEAM, do you have an english version of Pirate Hunter?; very similar game to this game, but very hard to get a hold of, apparently the german version has the english files within it, but not the russian; I have the russian version."
,brianxxx,2012-11-30T16:42Z,"WOW...seeing this brings me back! I forget which somewhat outdated vid card I had at the time, but I played this all the way through and was blown away at how beautiful everything was. So, as soon as the next gen cards came out, I bought a high end card and played this game all over again! Good times!"
