Far Cry is a first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek Studios and published by Ubisoft on March 23, 2004, for Microsoft Windows.

He is searching for a female journalist he was escorting after she went missing when their boat was destroyed by mercenaries. 
The game includes thematic elements relating to the dangers of weaponizing genetic engineering and the genocide of local islanders as can be seen by the deformed creatures created by a mad scientist named Krieger.
Jack Carver has left his mysterious and bitter past behind him and dropped out of society to run a boat-charter business in the South Pacific. 
He is hired by Valerie Constantine to take her secretly to an uncharted island in Micronesia. 
After Valerie takes off on her own with a jet-ski, Jack's boat is blown apart by a mercenary rocket.
