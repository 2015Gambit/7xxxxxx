Lord Dunsany (24 July 1878 ΓÇô 25 October 1957) was a London-born Anglo-Irish writer and dramatist notable for his work in fantasy. He was influenced by Algernon Swinburne, who wrote the line ΓÇ£Time and the Gods are at strifeΓÇ¥ in his 1866 poem ΓÇ£Hymn to ProserpineΓÇ¥, as well as by the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. In turn, DunsanyΓÇÖs influence was felt by H. P. Lovecraft and Ursula K. Le Guin. Arthur C. Clarke corresponded with Dunsany between 1944 and 1956. Those letters are collected in the book Arthur C. Clarke & Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence. Time and the Gods, a series of short stories written in a myth-like style, was first published in 1906.
