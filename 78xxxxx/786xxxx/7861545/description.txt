Frozen Hearth is a Real-Time Strategy game, blended with exciting RPG
features to create a new experience for lovers of RTS games. Set in our own
unique, Dark-Fantasy world-setting, you can play alone, or co-operatively
with a friend, through an epic and brutal campaign. Taking on the role of a
powerful Avatar of the heroic, individualistic Danaan; you will try to save
them from certain extinction at the hands of an immense horde of ravenous
ice monsters ΓÇô known as the Shangur ΓÇô driven ever forward by an unstoppable
wave of moving ice and snow that consumes everything it shrouds.

Once you've mastered the many Skills, Spells, Structures, Units, and
tactics in the campaign, you can test your skills against your friends in
our wide selection of Player-vs-Player gametypes. Our Multiplayer game and
map-types offer both well-loved favourites, and some new surprises of our
own! Or of course, if you're feeling confident, just jump right into the
PvP action!
