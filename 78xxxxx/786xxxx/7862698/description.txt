Why should Liberty BASIC be your next programming language?

Easy Programming - Programming should be simple.  Microsoft Windows is very complex.  Liberty BASIC makes programming Windows easy.  For nearly 20 years we've been working hard to simplify programming so you can get a lot done with less work and dare we say, have fun doing it!

Affordability - For the cost of a video game Liberty BASIC gives you everything you need to write software right away, including a cool interactive tutorial system to get you started.

Powerful - Your programs can have graphical user interface (GUI) controls, draw graphics, play sounds and music, access external devices, and more.  For the adventurous coder its ability to call Windows operating system API functions and use external libraries make Liberty BASIC infinitely extensible.

Online forums - Our online community is one of the best and friendliest you'll ever meet, and has thousands of helpful members.  You spend more time doing things you enjoy, not banging your head in frustration.
