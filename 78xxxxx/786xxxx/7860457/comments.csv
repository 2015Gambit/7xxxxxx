,jebatibog,2012-11-27T14:35Z,Is this version better than Agricultural Simulator 2013-SKIDROW from Heromaster?? Can i go reverse with my traktor and other bugs are fixed??
,draxon1,2012-11-27T16:00Z,no its the same like the other... a new fix patch has released but no crack to run it.
,whateverthefuck,2012-11-28T05:05Z,"The crack works, but if you have an LCD/LED monitor, you need to do some work to make it past the company logos.

1- In the folder where you installed the software, there is a ""system"" folder, open it and open the ""device.ICOM"" file with wordpad.

2- Change the value of ""set device.windowed"" from 0 to 1.

3- Change the value of ""set device.refreshrate"" from 75 to the default refresh rate of your monitor (60 for a regular LCD/LED, 120 for a 3D LCD/LED, etc.)

4- Press CTRL+s to save the changes, and close the ""device.ICOM""

5- Run the game, change whatever settings you want, also now it's safe to turn back on the full screen mode.

6- That's it.

The game is still buggy as hell, and often freezes or crashes to the desktop on load screens, also at max settings my superclocked GTX 570 can only manage 8 frames per second, which is not really very cool :(."
