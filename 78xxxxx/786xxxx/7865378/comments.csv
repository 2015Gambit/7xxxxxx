,icek00l,2012-11-28T00:39Z,"thank you as always, but can I ask why this version would be uploaded AFTER the version 9 yesterday??, was there a problem with that newer version?"

No there was no problem at all, its working great :)
However some didn't like DVDFab v9 Interface and preferred v8, so we released for them v8 new update.
Also as you see on DVDFab website: http://www.dvdfab.com/download.htm They are still offering the two versions at the same time, So why shouldn't we :)"

,icek00l,2012-12-02T16:27Z,"thanks for reply CC
NB. I wasn't complaining, purely curious because I have dl'd both versions but not installed them just yet.

Thank you as always for your very reliable, superb uploads"
