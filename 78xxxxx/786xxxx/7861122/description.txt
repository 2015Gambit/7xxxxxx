Description:
Against Rome is a real-time strategy game that takes players back to the European continent's migration of nations period (roughly 200 - 450 AD). The challenge begins in an area yet to be conquered by the Roman Empire. This seemingly endless stretch of territory is referred to by the Romans as "Barbaricum," considered home by many "less evolved" nations. It is here that the player takes command of a restless tribe. This tribe, designed to stand out against the rest for its love of pillaging and plundering, sets the theme of the game. Three-dimensional graphics are designed to engulf the players as their tribe travels across the vast territory raiding other settlements for food, weapons, and gold in either a single-player campaign mode or against up to eight other players. As the tribe obtains more resources, it grows in both size and reputation, until eventually it is poised to take on the Roman superpower in an epic battle for the control of the Empire.
