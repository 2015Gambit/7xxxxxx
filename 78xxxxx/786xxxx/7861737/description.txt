Elmer J. Fudd/Egghead is a fictional cartoon character and one of the most famous
Looney Tunes characters, and the de facto archenemy of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the
more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself).
His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other
antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws,
so 'Watch the road, Rabbit', is replaced with 'Watch the woad, wabbit!' Elmer's signature
catchphrase is, 'Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits', as well as his trademark.
