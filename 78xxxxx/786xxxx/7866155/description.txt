The Dark Ages have been misunderstood. History has identified the period 
following the fall of the Roman Empire with a descent into barbarism - a 
terrible time when civilisation stopped. 

Waldemar Januszczak disagrees. In this four-part series he argues that the Dark 
Ages were a time of great artistic achievement, with new ideas and religions 
provoking new artistic adventures. He embarks on a fascinating trip across 
Europe, Africa and Asia, visits the world's most famous collections and 
discovers hidden artistic gems, all to prove that the Dark Ages were actually 
an 'Age of Light'. 

In the first episode he looks at how Christianity emerged into the Roman Empire 
as an artistic force in the third and fourth centuries. But with no description 
of Jesus in the Bible, how were Christians to represent their God? Waldemar 
explores how Christian artists drew on images of ancient gods for inspiration 
and developed new forms of architecture to contain their art.
