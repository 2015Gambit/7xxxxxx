 of unspeakable situations where unimaginable choices affecting human    
 life must be made. Features include, a gripping, storyline reminiscent

 and vertically oriented world, devastating sandstorms which can be      
 used in combat, a variety of multiplayer modes and maps, and deep

 It's been 6 months since Dubai was wiped off the map by a cataclysmic   
 sandstorm. Thousands of lives were lost, including those of American    
 soldiers sent to evacuate the city. Today, the city lies buried under   
 sand, the worldâ™s most opulent ruin. Now, a mysterious radio signal     
 is picked-up from Dubai, and a Delta Recon Team is sent to infiltrate   
 the city. Their mission is simple: Locate survivors and radio for
 Evac. What they find is a city in the grip of war. To save Dubai,
 theyâ™ll have to find the man at the heart of its madness—Col. John      
 Konrad.  
   
 Spec Ops: The Line is an action-packed Third-Person Shooter that 
 delivers heart pounding physically close combat through a squad-based   
 play mechanic. Players lead a team of three characters, Captain  
 Martin Walker, Lieutenant Adams and Sergeant Lugo. Each character has   
 his own distinct personality and specialized skills, and the mature     
 story they each play a role in explores the dark side of war in a
 realistic way, in which there are no good outcomes, only hard    
 choices. As missions are completed more advanced weapons and     
 equipment are made available. In addition, the desert environment of    
 Dubai is brought into the game in a unique way with stunning visuals,   
 and dynamic sandstorms that actively effect level designs, and which    
 can be used to help and hinder progress. The vertical interiors of      
 Dubai high rise buildings also provide tactical advantages and risks    
 that can used be by players. Multiplayer campaigns bring new modes      
 and unusual situations and environments to expand the single player     
 experience.
