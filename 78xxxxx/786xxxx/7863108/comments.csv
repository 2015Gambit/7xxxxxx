,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-27T05:21Z,also (from the venerable zero_assassin five years ago):   http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3925514/JLA_-_Avengers_1-4_(2003)   
,STFmaryville,2012-11-27T19:41Z,"SplhcbPrime, that torrent doesn't include the 2nd hardcover and its 70+ pages of content, including the original (unfinished) 1983 crossover, an interview with Dick Giordano, plot outlines and annotations. Hey blackcanary thanks so much for this -- I used to own this set but I had to sell it for cash when I was evicted in 2008. Seriously, thanks for all the uploading you do!"
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-27T22:15Z,You're welcome STFmaryville.  I think DobisP.R. did a great job with this scan.  Enjoy! :)
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-27T22:21Z,"hey stfmaryville:  i realize what u say is true; the torrent i listed also does not include the death of superman story, either."
,STFmaryville,2012-11-27T23:11Z,"SplhcbPrime, I need you to list every comic torrent ever created so I will know what to download and read!"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-28T00:05Z,"stfmaryville:  bizarre, u r."
