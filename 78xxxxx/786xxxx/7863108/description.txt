The most powerful characters in two universes collide as DC's premier super-heroes meet Marvel's.  Perhaps the most eagerly anticipated and memorable crossover of all time, as the Justice League of America unites with The Avengers. Superman, Batman, and the other members of the JLA join forces with Captain America, Iron Man, and the many other Avengers to fight a threat so immense it threatens two entire dimensions. The second hardcover in this deluxe set features art and articles chronicling this historic crossover--which has been over twenty years in the making.

Volume One:  The complete miniseries collected with introductions by Stan Lee and Julie Schwartz, character and creator bios.

Volume Two:  A compendium featuring George Pérez's 21 pages of pencils from the aborted 1983 crossover; the initial plot for the current miniseries and every character, place and incident used in the miniseries carefully annotated by Pérez and Kurt Busiek.
