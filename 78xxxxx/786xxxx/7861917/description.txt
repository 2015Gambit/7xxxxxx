I'll admit, this isn't my creation... but I am so overjoyed at finding it, I just had to share it.

Johnny Cash - Complete Recording Sessions 1954-69

A complete collection of all material that Johnny Cash recorded in studio between 1954 and 69 digitally restored by a friend of mine who now earns his living by doing the same on assorted prestigeprojects concerned with fifties music

This is the third time i reseed this hopefully it?ll stay alive for more than six months this time

Anyway the material is divided into different records all the songs are id3-tagged and there are complete linearnotes in html format the exception being the last records where the notes and tags aren?t completly finished since my friend got caugth up in another project

The difference between this and other realeses like the bear family?s is that this includes more material and personally i find this digitalization to be more true to the original sound.

All songs are encoded in:
MPEG 1.0 layer 3, 256kbit, 44100Hz Joint Stereo
