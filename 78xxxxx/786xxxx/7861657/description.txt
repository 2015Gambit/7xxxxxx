Woh Lamhe is a 2006 film starring Shiney Ahuja and Kangna Ranaut and directed by Mohit Suri. The film is supposedly based on Parveen Babi's life, her battle with schizophrenia and her relationship with Mahesh Bhatt to whom she was a lover as well as a mentor in his struggling days.

Bhatt said that it is his tribute to the actress and time he spent with her, hence the film is called "Woh Lamhe". Parveen Babi's character is played by Kangna Ranaut who is named Sana Azim in the film to avoid direct reference to the actress. Woh Lamhe was critically acclaimed for its screenplay, direction, and a noteworthy performance by Kangna.
