,Lebada3,2012-11-29T10:17Z,Where is Matt Damon? lol
,Shadow416,2012-11-29T15:35Z,"^ Matt, was left out of the picture for reasons i wont say so i don't spoil it for others who havent seen the first 3. The aim at this one was to follow a new character that's similar to Matt, but the writers and producers were smart about it, should this not work out they can always fall back on Matt to return, well that's what they said anyway.  

I highly recommend everyone see the Bourne Trilogy BEFORE watching this, it's more worth it imo."
,.Leto.,2012-12-02T21:46Z,"Horrible movie. Except for the motorcycle chasing scene it's extremely boring. Plus you can see that they were already planning a sequel, there's no proper ending. You're going to be seriously disappointed if you were expecting a good action movie... "
