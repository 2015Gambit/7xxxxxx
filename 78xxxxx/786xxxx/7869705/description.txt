OKAY, so after a couple of releases that had save games problems and videos not loading, here is the proper fix by propjoe and exetrimall. save games and videos fixed.works perfectly in single player. got proper confirmation by fellow players from KAT community that it works.

instructions -

download far cry 3 duplex version...install pkgs 1,2 and 3( duplex crack pkg). and THEN install this fix. thats it.


thanks to duplex for another great release.
thanks to thenoobish for another great upload.
thanks and credit for fix of course goes to propjoe and exetrimall. 

enjoy and seed!
