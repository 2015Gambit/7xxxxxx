,dududus,2012-11-29T07:17Z,"not really proper:


zoom in problem 

 It's like it zooms in ALOT and gun isn't in center, but on side. Can't really explain, but you can't aim that way so it's not right. I'm trying to fix it now, will report back if got it working. 


and also no sound on co-op intro.



just upgrade to 4.30 guys, stop fucking around with half-assed fixes"

,maxdesolate,2012-11-29T11:41Z," @ dududus. i uploaded this first on KAT last night.  no negative feedback there coz its working on single player for eveyrone. noone said anything about multiplayer coz its not for multiplayer or co-op.  if you love 4.30 rogero so much. why do even care and why are you trying to fucking fix a fucking half-assed fix. if you wanna leave a comment on my torrents, then be nice. otherwise piss off."
