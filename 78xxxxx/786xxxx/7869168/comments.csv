,wtipper,2012-11-29T04:12Z,"Help? The instMods folder only has Forge in it, and the launcher crashes after the Mojang screen."
,BloodravenD,2012-11-29T05:03Z,"If you know how to mod minecraft, just put the forge into the minecraft.jar and you should be all set to use it in a .minecraft folder. I do that because i like minecraft profile manager too much to lose it."
,Alecor000,2012-11-29T12:58Z,thanks. will seed all i can
,Richterx8,2012-11-30T05:25Z,"Yeah, this one seems to be busted"
,BloodravenD,2012-11-30T09:44Z,@Richterx8:  What're you talking about? it works fine for me.  If it crashes just take the forge and put it in the minecraft.jar and copy the files to your .minecraft folder.
,imnewandneedhelp,2012-12-01T18:38Z,"could do with a little help, i downloaded it all seems to work fine then it crashes, i read the bit about putting forge into the minecraft jar but this download does not have a file called forge, also you say put the files into .minecraft as well but you dont say what files to put there, iv got skidrows version of minecraft if that helps, any help would be great, thanks."
,Feeenrus,2012-12-02T02:28Z,"There is a new version of FTB, 1.1.1, and I believe it contains a new pack, the magic pack, would be wonderful if you updated, thank you for everything"
,Richterx8,2012-12-02T04:48Z,"@imnewandneedhelp forge is in the inst mods folder, also if you think your version of mc is bugged use Team Extremes version.
If you cant find forge just go dl the latest version from the forge site..."
,warri0r13,2012-12-02T06:47Z,"@Feeenrus modpack updates are not tied to launcher updates. The launcher will list all the modpacks that have been uploaded to their server. Currently there are only 4 modpacks in the ftb launcher: ftb beta pack a, voxel modpack, ftb retro for minecraft v1.2.5 and universal electricity pack."
