,Athletic11,2012-11-28T07:50Z,"@RedAutumn - Here is written two times that: ''Please do not update.
THIS VERSION IS NOT UPDATABLE !''
----------------
----------------
I don't see any problem if I don't update.
I never update stable versions of Windows.

Please if someone have tested this torrent, write few words...does it work ?"
,xtraB,2012-11-28T08:17Z,"hey T.F.K.  this windows are really cool, thanks man."

,insomn1,2012-11-28T09:32Z,"Wait can you be more concise on how to install. Every time I attempt to install it tells me to insert the x64 disc, but I don't know where that is at, all I see is the x86.

please reply ASAP"
,insomn1,2012-11-28T09:42Z,"computer says ""Use the other installation disc that says 64-bit. When you insert it, Windows Setup will restart automatically."""
,anni1994,2012-11-28T10:14Z,"T.F.K 
Thanks a lot it works perfectly. Can you tell me if the activator works permanently or only for 180 days"
,PiratePays,2012-11-28T10:43Z,I wish T.F.K. would leave the pirate bay.
[T],T.F.K,2012-11-28T11:57Z,"Somebody hack our pass on TPB,ahahaha people....WE RETURNED NOW!"
,nox234558,2012-11-28T15:04Z,is this working ? :P and untouched 
,nox234558,2012-11-28T15:21Z,guys can i update this ? or not 
,Shawdah,2012-11-28T19:09Z,"Hey T.F.K.
Am I missing something, or this torrent is missing the X64 version of Windows 8?"
,NeonYouki,2012-11-28T19:29Z,"This is most likley only the 32 bit edition.  If you don't have more than 4GB of ram (I think there might be a hack to get around this, but as 32bits by its nature only allows for so much, I'm not sure.) and aren't using, or plan on using, 64 bit programs, you should be OK with this release.  I haven't tried installing it though, since I need 64 bit myself."
[T],T.F.K,2012-11-28T20:49Z,@RedAutumn you are reported.
[T],T.F.K,2012-11-28T21:54Z,"@RedAutumn

,2tonape,2012-11-29T00:11Z,"How can I install the 64bit version, I don't see it when installing from disc at all, nor when I look through the files on the dvd. "
,Bakaboykin,2012-11-29T04:57Z,"windows 8

,boysmaki,2012-12-02T14:12Z,64bit is there or not with this torrent ?? I can able to find 32 bit  but not 64 bit
,mexican_panda,2012-12-02T22:50Z,"Do the live tiles and the aplicatons like the mail, games, store, all that work with this copy? Seeing some on other sites saying they are having issues. but not with T.F.K's just the Yarg copys in general."
,p1ncer,2012-12-03T05:41Z,"for anyone having:

""Use the other installation disc that says 64-bit. When you insert it, Windows Setup will restart automatically.""

try burning the iso to a disk, then boot using that disk.. works fine"
