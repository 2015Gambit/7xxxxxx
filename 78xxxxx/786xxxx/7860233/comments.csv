,maxjahnke,2012-11-26T13:10Z,"I'm not complaining. Just wondering why all the dexter episodes, either in 720p or in 1080i have diminished in quality. The 720p rip usually had 2.1GB and looked awesome and there was also some in 1080p, near to 5GB. Someone care to explain?
Thanks in advance"
,slightblue,2012-11-26T14:05Z,Thx for another top-notch UP!!
,DEHiCKA,2012-11-26T18:33Z,Thanks! Can you also make Homeland in 1080?
,susipus,2012-11-26T18:49Z,"The publichd 1,27 720 rips are probably the best the encoder can do. Maybe you have been watching 1080 rips and has been a little spoiled after you went back to 720?
Earlier years the rips was 1.1gig, but now many is only 0,9, i hope the encoder has been better, but as long as i download at least 1.25gid for a 45 min episode i'm satisfied. But i'll rather wait for these superb files from SecTPB ofcourse :-)"
