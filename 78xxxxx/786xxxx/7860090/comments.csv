,ScottyD7421,2012-11-26T05:46Z,"Hi, just out of curiosity are u guys affiliated in any way with ettv? It's just i noticed your upload of the walking dead is uploaded approximately 20 minutes after ettv's upload and yours is exactly the same size every time? This can be said for all 7 episodes this season so far. On appearances it seems you are downloading ettv's version just so you can upload it yourself which being that it is the same quality upload serves no purpose other than clogging up the bay. I could of course be wrong but was simply curious."
,sahilrox,2012-11-26T08:15Z,Next week is the season finale.......Only 8 episodes in this season.
,vampzcore,2012-11-26T09:45Z,"Season 3 has 16 episodes...




thanks VTV!"

,Roswell2048,2012-11-26T10:53Z,"People who post spoilers on T.V. torrents should be brutally beaten to within an inch of their life...then beaten some more until they're dead. But not because they spoiled a show for someone, but because the act shows they are horrible people out to ruin things for everyone else, and who wants to share a planet with someone like that? Also @ScottyD7421 VTV is a partner with EZTV and they share torrents. It's my belief that ETTV is actually the one that is re-uploading the torrents (since both EZTV and VTV were around long before ETTV showed up). But it doesn't really matter, with 3 uploaders if one or two misses an upload, the other usually provides which is nice."
