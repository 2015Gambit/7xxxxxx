,phaseone408,2012-11-26T11:57Z,Where the seeders at!?  in 15 mins of starting this torrent I've downloaded 32MB and have uploaded 176MBs.  WHERE THE SEEDERS PLEASE
,phaseone408,2012-11-26T12:05Z,"Thanks for the game man, at least its only going to take 4 hours now instead of 2 years!"
,blfunser,2012-11-26T14:59Z,will it work on 3.55??? it does not say if its for 4.30 or 3.55???
,Tegra3,2012-11-26T17:18Z,thenoobish... 3.55 fix or what? Thank you anyways.
,crysty936,2012-11-26T20:26Z,"WHAT?! WHEN?! HOW?!!! I tought the xbox 360 torrent must come before the ps3 one,or at least at the same time,was there some kind of additional protection given for far cry 3,why wasnt it leaked 10 days before launch like every other game on consoles?"
,phaseone408,2012-11-26T23:12Z,I'm installing the .pkg files right now on my PS3 part 1 is at 67% will report back once its finished.
,phaseone408,2012-11-26T23:42Z,Tested and Confirmed working on Rogero 4.30.  Thanks so much thenoobish.
,phaseone408,2012-11-27T00:52Z,"How are you people pushing ""Rate Down"" seems as if thenoobish just has some haters on this site.  Game works PERFECT on 4.30 CFW so lets rate it down?  Internet logic is great!"
,killerle,2012-11-27T01:27Z,wheres the pc and xbox version?? :)
,86ETA,2012-11-27T01:51Z,"Upload 360 version 

Fuck shitty PS3    :)  "
,xSakranx,2012-11-27T04:06Z,360 version?
,uchiwa7,2012-11-27T08:38Z,guys will it work on  3.55 kmeaw  ?  thx 
,phaseone408,2012-11-27T10:11Z,Pretty sure it wont work on 3.55 when i installed part 1 and 2 I wanted to test to see if it would load on 4.30 without the crack thinking maybe it was a 3.55 crack but that wasent the case.  The game wouldn't load until i installed the crack so I HIGHLY doubt it will work on 3.55.  Anyways why are you still on 3.55 Rogero 4.30 is just as stable as 3.55 kmeaw now.
,JuggernautOfWar,2012-11-27T12:25Z,Don't flame too much. Where do I start in order to download games for my PS3? I've always been curious. Do I need to install a custom OS or something?
,dududus,2012-11-27T14:33Z,"This game seems unfixable for 3.55

Time to upgrade, stragglers 8)"
,runtimmy,2012-11-27T17:26Z,Far.Cry.3 WOrks great on Rogero 4.30 V2.00 CFW 
,Sunfit,2012-11-27T21:31Z,Hey guys do you know if the torrent that was here before about Far cry 3 Razor 1911 was fake?
,phaseone408,2012-11-27T22:39Z,"@JuggernautOfWar If your PS3 is on a higher Firmware then 3.55 then you cant install a Custom firmware.  If your ps3 is a older model about 2 years ago but with a updated firmware then you need to buy a E3 flasher for about $80 to downgrade from the official Firmware down to 3.55, then to a CFW. "
,1tomer,2012-11-29T19:39Z,"someone that own rogero 4.21 works for him ?

please answer..."
,maxdesolate,2012-12-01T15:20Z,https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7869705/Far_Cry_3_PS3_Proper_fix_3.55_3.41  there you go guys.
,MAA11792,2012-12-02T15:25Z,"@86ETA the difference between the PS3 and X360 is non-existing, well you have better (fake-AA) but with an extra cost of framerates that is. My advise: get a pc, and shut that mouth of yours.. reeeal good!"
