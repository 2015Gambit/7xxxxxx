             The New Normal | s01e10 | Pardon Me | 720p WEB-DL


After recalling the disastrous dinners of Thanksgivings past, Bryan, David, Goldie, Shania, and Rocky decide that this year they are going to enjoy the holiday with their new family. Later, after realizing the horrible fates of the turkeys at the farm a sensitive Shania and Bryan pardon all of them and take them home as new pets. The move prompts a meat-free dinner menu and in the spirit of the pardon encourages everyone to invite over family and friends that they need to make amends with. David invites his mother (guest star Jackie Hoffman) and his father (guest star Barry Bostwick), while Bryan extends an olive branch to Jane, Goldie reaches out to Clay and Rocky puts aside her political differences with her brother Clint (guest star Sterling Sulieman). Though the pre-dinner festivities seem to be cheerful it doesn't take long for personalities to clash and for this Thanksgiving to go to the birds.
