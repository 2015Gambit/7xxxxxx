,awimaway,2012-11-28T06:09Z,Thanks again EZTV.
,bshaun2,2012-11-28T07:34Z,The audio gets way out of sync about half way through and stays that way for the rest of the video
,Rob2042,2012-11-28T07:52Z,bshaun2 is full of shit!  Nothing wrong with the audio.
,AucklandNZ,2012-11-28T08:55Z,Audio goes out of sync for me also but easily fixed by pressing j or k if using vlc media player
,truthtold,2012-11-28T09:01Z,"Confirmed for out of sync. You may or may not have watched out of sync videos before. If you have, even the slightest split second delay between audio and video will drive you insane."
,ETPhoneHome,2012-11-28T10:04Z,"Yes it is slightly out of sync, use VLC mediaplayer, and press k til you get around 400ms the problem is then fixed. Thanks @bshaun2 for the trick. Very useful and easy to do."
,sdfljfebd,2012-11-28T18:22Z,"Confirmed the video is out of sync with audio. Why won't my VLC play this? Most of the time when I try to use VLC, I get audio but the picture is mostly just grey."
,GPSman1,2012-11-28T22:32Z,"All i have to say is i met Ron Pearlman at Disneyland on Thanksgiving a few days ago and he is the coolest guy.  Down to earth, nothing like his shows, looks a lot different too.  Way cool, great show, keep up the good work...."
,jalucian,2012-11-29T00:09Z,"Rob2042 is either a liar or an idiot. The audio DOES go out of synch, but there are other torrents now that don't have this problem. Don't settle for tweaking with VLC when you can just get one that's not broken."
,2230cs,2012-11-29T02:02Z,audio is behind for me on quicktime.. im sure there is a way to adjust that though with some application 
,aawill,2012-11-29T04:03Z,Audio out of sync on Vlc player for me.
,tflagger997,2012-11-30T01:51Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7867003/Sons_of_Anarchy_S05E12_PROPER_HDTV_x264-2HD_%5Beztv%5D

EZTV posted another version without the sync issue."
,snaga007,2012-11-30T03:25Z,"audio IS out of sink, never tried pressing j or k with vlc, but I tried it on every other media player and it is definetly out of sink. 

That being said, still enjoyed the show and thanks for the upload!"
,lekz296,2012-11-30T06:04Z,which season is this?
