TutsPlus - Pro Workflow for Web Designers

ItΓÇÖs not enough to know how to design a website. Being able to hand off your designs, whether to a colleague or client, in a clear and organized way is what ensures your designs survive in the field. In this course, Dan Rose guides you through the workflow for building an organized web design in Photoshop. From clear layer labels to UI element states, Dan is full of tips on how to present your design in a way developers, designers, or dabblers can understand.
Note: this course teaches professional workflow and organization, not specifically on design techniques. It assumes a basic understanding of web design and Photoshop. If youΓÇÖd like to learn web design techniques and technology, please check out our design section!
