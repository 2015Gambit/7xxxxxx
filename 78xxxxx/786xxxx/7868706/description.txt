The Episode

Title		: Butterflied
Year		: 2004
Length		: 42min
IMDb		: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0534661/
Plot		: A nurse is found dead in her house by her friend, who's also a 
		nurse. The victim died in her spacious bathroom, posed with her head 
		facing the door. According to the friend, she was to have dinner with
		her new boyfriend, Dr. Michael Clark, who works at the same hospital.
		Processing the crime scene reveals very little evidence because the 
		killer has thoroughly cleaned the place and used bleach to denature 
		any DNA. Dr. Clark, initially a prime suspect, is later found, albeit 
		in pieces, in garbage bins behind the house. The precision of various
		cuts suggests that medical personnel is the killer. Meanwhile, this 
		case prompts Grissom to contemplate his workaholic life and whether 
		it is worth the life he may be missing out on.
