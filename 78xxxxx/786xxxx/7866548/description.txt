This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from the original stereo source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Notes and disclaimers:
It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

How much do I love this comeback? Let me count the ways, and then pretend Audioslave and Timbaland colabs never happened. Great in 5.1. Your thoughts on where I kept the rears volume-wise may vary.
