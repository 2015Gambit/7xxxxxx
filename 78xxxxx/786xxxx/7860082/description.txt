This book is a reprint of Haining's earlier book entitled "Terror: A History of Horror Illustrations from Pulp Magazines." It is a hardback with different cover art. While it's quite thorough in visually documenting the evolution of horror illustration from the "penny-dreadful" magazines of the Victorian age through the pulps of the '30s and '40s, most of the luridly colorful pulp magazine cover images are reproduced in B&W. Goes into interesting detail of the history of horror publishing, from England to the USA to pulps, and details some of the masters, and gives many excellent examples. Nice that it is in black and white, too, as far as horror goes.
