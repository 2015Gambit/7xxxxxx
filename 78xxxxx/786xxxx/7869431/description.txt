Fresh from the pages of Mike Allred's MADMAN: Snap City's favorite heroine is ready for her own crimefighting adventures! With the Atomics boys in outer space, it's up to It Girl to keep the streets safe. Easier said than done: The Skunk, the man who murdered her sister, is out of jail and back to old tricks. Meanwhile, Dr. Flem has a brand new space-time experiment and wants It Girl to be his guinea pig!
