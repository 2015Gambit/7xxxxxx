IPASuperior, blah blah. :P Who cares what I write anyway? Well, again, 720p, from Hulu, so there are NO watermarks or whatever. Just straight footage.

Recap:
Lois experiences a mid-life crisis, and Peter tries to keep up with her new, wild lifestyle. Meanwhile, Stewie finds a turtle at the park and brings him home as his new pet, unaware that the turtle is evil and determined to destroy StewieΓÇÖs life in the all-new ΓÇ£Lois Comes Out Of Her ShellΓÇ¥ episode of FAMILY GUY airing Sunday, Nov. 25 (9:00-9:30 PM ET/PT) on FOX.

Show Summary: The show follows the adventures of an endearingly ignorant dad, PETER GRIFFIN (Seth MacFarlane), and his hilariously odd family of middle-class New Englanders in Quahog, RI. LOIS (Alex Borstein) is PeterΓÇÖs wife, a stay at home mom with no patience for her familyΓÇÖs antics.

Then there are their kids: 17-year-old MEG (Mila Kunis) is a social outcast and the Griffin family punching bag; 13-year-old CHRIS (Seth Green) is a socially awkward teen who doesnΓÇÖt have a clue about the opposite sex; and 1-year-old STEWIE (MacFarlane) is a diabolically clever baby whose burgeoning sexuality is very much a work in progress. Rounding out the Griffin household is BRIAN (MacFarlane), the family dog, a member of Mensa with a penchant for dry martinis and dumb blondes.

Enjoy, and remember: SEED!
