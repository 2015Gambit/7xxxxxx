[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-11-26T19:46Z,"Dude, No need for such hostility, geez.  Unstable much... XD  
But as for your comment, people do rescans of older comics all the time.  Some, like theProletariat, will release them all in one big batch.  Some, like Mediozo, or DobisP.R. will release them issue by issue as they're done.  You just happen to jump on an issue 4 post, and complain that the whole set wasn't posted yet?  It will be when it's done, but that will not prevent the single issue posts from being uploaded as they're completed.  
Take your meds and calm down. ;)"

[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-11-29T03:38Z,Umm. Let's compare our two comments...  One is a reasonable thorough explanation of the issue.  The other is someone shouting maniacally in all caps.  I'll let the people decide who is the one with maturity issues :)
