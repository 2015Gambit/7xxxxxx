Messages from Heaven:
A Biblical Examination of The Apparitions Of The Vigin Mary and Other Supernatural Activity In The End Times. For instance, tens of millions visit apparition sites hoping to encounter the Blessed Virgin Mary. Many believe that these increasing manifestations signal the advent of a new era on earth. Thousands of messages that we are entering a critical moment in world history - cataclysmic changes may soon occur. Those who follow the apparitions believe Mary has come to turn us back to God, while others insist that these events are either fabrications or the working of Satan. Does the Bible anticipate apparitions, signs and wonders in the last days? Does the Word of God reveal the origin of these phenomena? How might the apparition of Mary and other paranormal events transform the world in the third millennium? (scripture not KJV).

When does the judgement start? Or has it already started? Or has it already finished? This is a very important topic that everyone needs to know, hence Satan has made a lot of confusion on this topic. This video hopes to remove that confusion.

The 7 Trumpets of Revelation:
Seven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to queue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the Revelation of Christ Jesus, by John of Patmos, as written in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament.  The seven trumpets are sounded by seven angels and the events that follow are described in detail from Revelation Chapters 8 to 11.  According to Revelation 8:1-2, the angels sound these trumpets after the breaking of the seventh seal. These seals secured the apocalyptic document, that was in the right hand of Him who sits on the main throne.

Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)

Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
