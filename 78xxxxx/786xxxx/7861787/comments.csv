,tapaleat,2012-11-26T18:42Z,how can I get eng. subs?
,lewek2001,2012-11-27T18:29Z,"tapaleat, you only have to wait patiently, like the rest of us, for some mercy of the ones who are able to prepare them;)"
,heydude6,2012-11-27T19:58Z,are u joking?;/ already episode 10 but still no subs for 9??;/ I don't have that much patience xD (headbang)
,lewek2001,2012-11-27T20:42Z,it is not a voice of a patient person...rather downhearted and resigned...
,folli,2012-11-28T08:43Z,"I can't believe that there is not person in the whole world who can speak Danish and would do the subtitles for the last 2 episodes :((( If I would have seen it coming I hadn't watched season 3 at all until 15 December , when it will finish on BBC and hardcoded subtitles will be available :(((("
,MissKnoxie,2012-11-30T08:20Z,"Well, the world doesn´t revolve around English as an only language you know. I think we should all just be grateful someone puts the torrents up, I know I am. All those people who don´t speak English are missing out on a lot of good shows too. This is something for all those scandinavian people who can understand Danish. If I knew how to put subs up for you I´d do it. Sorry, I dont´t. But cmplaining doesn´t help, it´s actually rather rude. Thanks for your work frakris. :) "
,folli,2012-11-30T10:43Z,"I'm not complaining, I'm worrying. You apparently could watch all the episodes so you have no idea in what situation people like me are. When you are watching from week to week and are waiting eagerly for the next episodes and when it gets the most exciting, you are not able to watch. Sorry, but this is quite annoying."
,lewek2001,2012-11-30T11:44Z,"MissKnoxie, you apparently missed the point. Everybody coming here for English subs, really really really appreciate the hard work of the translators and people adding torrents here. 

But... checking this site several times a day, and being unable to watch the last 2 episodes of this season can be really frustrating. 

It's not about rudeness, really. You should see the comments written by George R. R. Martin's fans;) "
,flamesong,2012-11-30T14:28Z,"If I might add another perspective on the discussion about the desire for subtitles, I think that levelling criticism at the English speaking people who are seeking and requesting subtitles is a bit narrow minded because they are the people who, despite being unable to speak the native language of the programme, are actually bothering to engage in the media of another culture. They aren't like the majority of a certain nation who would never dream of watching anything with subtitles and sit on their fat arses until Hollywood remakes everything for them in English."
,lewek2001,2012-11-30T20:47Z,"Flamesong, do you really want to deny the role of English in communication?  I'm not Danish, but I'm also not English (I regret, but no). I don't see a point of knowing all the languages of the world just because of some pieces I would like to know/read/see.
And that's why - yes, I'm sitting on my fat ass waiting for English subs so I could derive advantages from another great culture. 
Sorry to insult you, the one so much better then me..."
,edroonieoffice,2012-12-01T00:34Z,"I understand Danish but my wife doesn't. We have been waiting anxiously for the English subtitles, but this evening I gave in to my desperate need to watch the last two episodes :-)

What I really don't understand is that Danish television does not provide English subtitles for their programs. Not all citizens of Denmark speak Danish and for those trying to learn it, it would be a great help :-)"
,flamesong,2012-12-01T13:24Z,"@ lewek2001

I can only imagine that you have wilfully misunderstood what I said because your response blathers on as if you did not even read my post.

Sorry to draw attention to your inability to read. But you seem to be a moron and although that isn't your fault you ought not publicly to post idiotic shite exposing your lack of reasoning power."
,folli,2012-12-01T21:34Z,"OMG flamesong, calm down! I think lewek2001 accidentally mistook you with MissKnoxie.

So, I've given up looking several times a day for subtitles, I guess we have to wait until the series finishes on BBC in two weeks and then we will have the subtitles at last. :((((("
