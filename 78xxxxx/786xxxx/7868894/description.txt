Let's spend the night together in a TV tribute to the songwriting skills of
pop's original bad boy group -The Rolling Stones.

From the archives of Old Grey Whistle Test, Top of the Pops, Crackerjack
and the odd international pop show, come the likes of Gene Pitney,
Thelma Houston, Chris Farlowe, Patti Smith, Marianne Faithfull, Devo and
Melanie taking on Mick and Keith's songbook.

'Jumpin' Jack Flash', 'Gimme Shelter', 'Ruby Tuesday', 'Wild Horses',
'Stupid Girl', 'Under My Thumb' and 'She's a Rainbow' all get the cover
treatment; the surprises lie in who does what and how, all adding to one
hour of total satisfaction
