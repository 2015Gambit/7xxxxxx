""Citizen Kane"" is often considered the greatest masterpiece of the cinema, hailed for its story, dramatic technique, and filmmaking innovations. The film should have launched its director, Orson Welles, to superstar heights, instead, this singular filmmaker spent his career facing constant financial and organizational struggles. Yet despite these obstacles, Welles managed to produce two other successful films - ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" and ""Touch of Evil"". This encyclopaedia follows Welles' career from his early days as a radio performer with ""Mercury Theater on the Air"" to his rise and prolonged decline in Hollywood. More than 300 entries cover all aspects of Welles' life and career, including all of his film projects - even those never realized - major performers in his films; key crew members; sources of inspiration; music and composers; and television, stage, and radio appearances.
