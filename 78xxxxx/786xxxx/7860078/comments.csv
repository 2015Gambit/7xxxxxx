,Mc_IcePick,2012-11-28T00:49Z,"Thx for the upload bro, i was waiting for it ^^"
,BuLLeTs64,2012-11-28T05:46Z,"@Assassinprofessor I love both shows dearly. Both are simply perfection. However, Breaking Bad only has 8 more episodes remaining and then the entire series is finished, so I would say start there. Plus, the fact that Walter White is one of the most epicly awesome characters portrayed by a brilliant actor within the last decade or so doesn't hurt. JMO! "
