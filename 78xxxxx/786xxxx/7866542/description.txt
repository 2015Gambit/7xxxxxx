Transferred from a very rare Vinyl EP I had with me for years.  " Gaalimaathu ", a typical tear-jerker Kannada movie that came out in 1981.  Beautiful songs written by Chi. Udayshankar and composed by the dynamic duo Rajan Nagendra.

Unlike most audio enthusiasts, I have kept the original audio files pretty much raw by not applying any kind of noise reduction treatments, thereby preserving the integrity of the original sound as close to the source as possible.

Yes, they are in MP3 format rated 320kbps, so the quality pep-talk is rather redundant!

Enjoy!
