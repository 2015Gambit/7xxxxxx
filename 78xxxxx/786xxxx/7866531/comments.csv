,bco312,2012-11-28T08:08Z,This show is about to get canceled a big reason is a lot of people like myself watch on torrents sites and not on TV. If you like this show try to watch it on TV sometimes to keep it coming. At least til season 6 get renewed #LetsStealASeason6

Only people with Nielsen boxes have their tv watching habits recorded. If you don't have one then it doesn't effect tv ratings. "
