,Primuz017,2012-11-30T07:53Z,"Worst movies I've seen this year. 

At the end you will be like ""huh? wtf happend, did I watch a movie or what was that?

Plus this new guy sucks as bourne. Just saying. "
,.Leto.,2012-11-30T11:36Z,"Great A/V quality, no problem at all. But this movie really sucks. Except for the motorcycle chasing scene, which is very well done, it's really boring. Plus you can see that they were already planning a sequel, there's no proper ending. You're going to be seriously disappointed if you were expecting a good action movie..."
,PauloFran,2012-11-30T22:54Z,"Great video quality.
Thank you!"
,Primuz017,2012-12-01T01:11Z,"Don't download. Audio it shit.  You will have to turn volume up high as hell to hear them talk. And turn the volume down for the background noise since it'll be high as hell. 

Video quality: 10/10
Sound Quality 6/10 (due to what I said^)
Movie 1/10 ( worst action movie I've ever seen in my life)"
