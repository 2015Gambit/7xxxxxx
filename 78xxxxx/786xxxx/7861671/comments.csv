,Epipgames,2012-11-27T02:47Z,"Hey guys, I'm a developer of this game, and if you do like the game, we'd love it if you went out and bought it - we're a small developer, and need all the help we can get - also we're constantly adding more content and patches and fixes and more and will be supporting this game for a long time to come - come and join us!

You can find it in a number of places - raindg, gamersgate, gamestop, desura and more - hopefully on steam soon too.

hope you enjoy the game, and we really hope to see you in future! Enjoy!"

,kinroko,2012-11-27T06:59Z,"Except for the fact that I would never buy this game nor play it if it were free, good job getting it marketed anyway. Props. It takes quite the businessman to sell a pile of poo."
,EmilzTPB,2012-11-27T13:05Z,"I have not tried this game but kinroko, that wasnt nice..
Have you ever enevn made anything by yourself to speak so? Sure not,I dont even know why Im asking.
Go to your mommy now"
,DasGaming,2012-11-28T09:14Z,"@kinroko
You are a 12 year old fucking kid. Go plays your shitty COD. This game is a amazing RTS and deserves some credit for it. Also thank you developer for not flaming. Defiantly buying once it is on steam."
,tudekiks,2012-11-28T16:26Z,Game says there is mods installed that doesent work . so its unplayable . Removing the content in the mods folder did nothing . (after the game ran updates )
,limbaugh1015,2012-11-28T23:16Z,What about the Login information that is requested? I don't see anyone else commenting about it so I probably just missed something. Thank you!
