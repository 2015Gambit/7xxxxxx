        I found this movie very entertaining. It's a nice, funny movie, and well produced, specially when compared to many films made in Brazil at that time. It's really a "time capsule" that allows the viewer to immerse himself in the "Golden Age" of Brazil, the 1950's. You can see the city of São Paulo at the height of it's economic development, but in a moment of time in which the violence and urban deterioration of the present didn't exist; you can see the early days of television, the TV sets that appear in the movie are of the "Invictus" brand, the first Brazilian TV brand, and the TV studio scenes were shot at the studio of "TV Tupi" , the first South American TV station; you can hear the way people talked and the slangs used in Brazil at the time; see the early days of Rock and Roll. To the nostalgic crowd ( on which I include myself ), it's a movie that not only you must see, but also a movie that you must have in your collection. IMDB
