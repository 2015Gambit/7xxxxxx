Performance: The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd

D.H. Lawrence is of course best known for his novels, but he also wrote several plays.

This play is set in a dreary mining town, and the action is centred on the deteriorating marriage between a loutish miner  and his more refined wife . Holroyd is a drunkard who abuses his wife physically and emotionally, even bringing home younger women to flaunt his infidelities in front of his long-suffering spouse. In spite of everything, Mrs Holroyd still loves her husband.
Among Holroyd's workmates is Blackmore, a more sensitive man. In love with Mrs Holroyd himself, he offers a way out, but events take an unexpected turn...
