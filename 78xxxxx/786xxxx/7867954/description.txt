             The New Normal | s01e11 | The XY Factor | 720p WEB-DL


Despite wanting to be surprised, Bryan and David accidentally find out the sex of their baby. The slip brings one dad-to-be closer to his dream family -- minus marrying Kelly Kapowski (guest star Shannen Doherty, "Charmed") -- but creates a growing concern for the other that he won't know how to connect with his child. Elsewhere, a rousing performance by Shania during a school assembly stirs Goldie, reminding her that she still has dreams that she needs to pursue. Later, when Shania's choice of material not only gets her a poor grade, but also a suspension, Goldie dons her "lawyer suit" and goes to the school to defend her daughter. 


ABOUT THE NUMBERING
BS seems to have forgotten that CtrlHD released "Para-New Normal Activity" in its rightful 8th place and therefore this should be 11th. There can't be TWO episdoe 8 and you can't UN-release an episode.
