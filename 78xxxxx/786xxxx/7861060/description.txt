Ken Lewis takes you thru an entire mix, start to finish with no interruptions. Ken shows you every plugin, every fader move and pan adjustment, all of the mix bus processing, and explains in depth what he is doing and why he is doing it. You see and hear the mix evolve from a single kick drum thumping into a fully finished mix ready for radio.

This Mix Session features NYC indie rockers SKIDMORE FOUNTAIN and their song BLUR, which Ken produced and recorded from their album BREAK.
