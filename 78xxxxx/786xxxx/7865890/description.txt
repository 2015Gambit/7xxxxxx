Karl Christian Krumpholz is back with an all-new Byron adventure. After the events of the first Byron storyline (Byron: Mad, Bad, and Dangerous GN), Byron has come to the realization that life is not as it seemed to be. Now, he thinks he knows what's going on and that he's seen it all. He's survived drugged toads, vampire attacks, and the attempted realignment of reality. What else can go wrong? Now thinking of himself as some sort of 'Psychic Investigator', he's on the road, entering the wild places of America and searching for his missing brother, H.P.. How hard can finding a talkative two-headed pickled punk be? America may a big place after all, but such things tend to stand out.Over his search, Byron will meet fashionable hillbillies, christian dominatrices, mad bartenders, tiki zombies, fox and spider women, pagan hippies, saintly murderers, spirits, gods, the Book of Life itself, and a strange woman called 'Widdershin.' Byron already realizes that his life is not what is seemed to be. Now he's finding out that the world is not what is seemed to be either.
