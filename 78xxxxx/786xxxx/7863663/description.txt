Russian Roulette is a free Android game like the well-known game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder and pulls the trigger.

----------------

The term "Russian Roulette" originated in an eponymous 1937 short story by George Surdezof. "Russian" refers to the supposed country of origin, and roulette to the element of risk-taking and the spinning of the revolver's cylinder being reminiscent of spinning a roulette wheel. Because only one chamber is loaded, the player has only one in n chance of hitting the loaded chamber, where "n" is the total number of chambers in the cylinder. So, for instance, in a revolver that holds six rounds, the chance is one in six; for a revolver that holds five, the chance is one in five.
