Revolt by Ron Diesel.

The sites of Mesoamerica's incredible past; the indigenous aborigines without any outside influence had built cities of a beauty and size unparalleled in Europe at that time. It has been said that America is a continent without history, the stupidity of this comment is self evident when confronted by the archaeological sites of these mighty cities of such grace and beauty, and after listening to some of the colourful myths and legends I became enthralled, in particular after hearing the legend of a Toltec god named Quetzalcoatl (Plumed Serpent) he was described as a black bearded white man, who appeared a thousand years before the European invasion, he was a teacher, inventor, architect and painter.
