tatuDowns: 
I found the DVD on YouTube. It was uploaded in 7 parts. 
I had to download the 7 videos and cut out the introduction of
each video which contained the channel name and some messages
of the YouTube user 'lyublyutatu' .
Then I had to join the 7 video files to make 1 big file. So it took me some time.
In fact, it took me 8 hours, downloading,editing and rendering. So if you finished 
downlading it, please leave a comment and keep seeding the torrent so other fans can
download it as well.I would really appreciate it . 

Thanks and I hope you enjoy :D
