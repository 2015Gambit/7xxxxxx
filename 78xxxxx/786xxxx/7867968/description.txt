"ExtractPlus and PatternMaker")are packed in "PHSPCS4_Cont_LS1.exe" file of Adobe.

These are Legacy Plugins which were discontinued by Adobe Photoshop, somewhere 

near the CS3 or CS4 Era. However these are still Favorites with Old Schoolers like 

me and I am sure with many others like me around the Globe.



Unrar the plugins and simply place the .8BF Files in the Photoshop Plugin Folders

These Plugins are compatible with Photoshop 7 to CS6 and Windows 98 to Windows 8.
