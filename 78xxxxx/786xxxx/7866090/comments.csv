[T],n2kmaster,2012-11-28T13:42Z,"Wouldnt call it beautiful. Simple concept using very simple tools. Where can it be helpful at?  K you know all the surf exchanges who pay you credits for unique page views on the ads, this is for that. I used to have a pop up company as well that would pay pretty good for even tor hits (Can't get the sign up or login to work anymore over there, not an account issue their site has a problem) It not only gives you a complete page view, including your ads, popups, and all the stuff on the page (unlike the proxy hitters that only send a simple ping), it will help alexa rating and for some random weird ass reason it also boosts PR. Don't ask me how long it takes, or how it changes PR. Its one of them if it works don't break it kinda deals. Keep in mind this all was a simple project that evolved over time, got some pretty good reviews during earlier versions, and there was a fair amount of requests for it to come back out. Hope its profitable to you as it was for me."
