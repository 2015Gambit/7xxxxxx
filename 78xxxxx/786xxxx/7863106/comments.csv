[V],MgB,2012-11-27T09:39Z,"Next Release most probably  Savages or On the Road .... But those two wont be in DTS , as it was encoded long back and i deleted the source , dont want to waste time downloading n encoding those again in DTS ..... Total Recall old and new version will be in DTS , as well as Expendables ....Enjoy it"
,StevenH91,2012-11-27T12:04Z,Hey MgB. I love your rips but I was wondering why you have done this one in and MKV container??? Will your future rips be MKV too? Im asking because  I play your rips through my apple TV and yours always look incredibly good in comparison to most others. Cheers
