,botibol,2012-11-26T17:26Z,The illuminatti are preventing us from watching this episode. I tell you.
,Barthanol,2012-11-26T19:17Z,"Just get this one, not 720p but it's the best you will find right now at this point in time.

,Max200088,2012-11-26T20:56Z,WHY IS IT STUCK?!
,Barthanol,2012-11-26T23:34Z,"I've been seeding both Of Dibya's 720p versions all day, the more recent one is totally dead for me. Not 1 bit downloaded in the past few hours  from that one. So I deleted it. This one has been downloading at  1 or 2 kB/s. So I should be all set in about 32 weeks to 1 year & 12 weeks approximately. 

I do appreciate Dibya's HD uploads though. 
Perhaps they shut down their own seed on these. Not sure if I can hold out much longer for a 720p or 1080p. 

Bueller?"
,Max200088,2012-11-28T08:05Z,Malhereux indeed.
,Max200088,2012-12-02T06:25Z,Don't worry tho. It seems to be the very last file.
