,vdhosni,2012-11-27T00:27Z,low quality
,mothermonster,2012-11-27T03:23Z,"This is definitely legit you guys. The quality great, you can hear every word clearly and no harsh background noise. I'm not an audio expert, still it's not perfect quality. But for an early leak, this is def worth the download. Download was super fast.

The album: It's okay. I'm not a huge Ke$ha fan, but it's catchy enough; although it still lacks innovation (especially the lyrics). Supernatural is pretty cool. 

Thanks for uploading!"
