,dellamorte666,2012-11-28T02:46Z,"Like that other guy said. We need the ""multicommon_english.dat"" and ""multicommon_english.fat"" files."
,junk33,2012-11-28T02:53Z,"Did not work, audio in russian still, cannot change language in audio options."
,Whitessx,2012-11-28T02:54Z,Doesn't work.
,TheDeviantBlackbeard,2012-11-28T02:55Z,okay same disappointment. No voices at all. I guess the multicommon english files are missing! =( 
,Sanguinex,2012-11-28T03:07Z,This didn't work to fix the dialog issue.
,junk33,2012-11-28T03:35Z,Other fix deleted and this one don't work :(
,MAA11792,2012-11-28T04:13Z,What the fuck is this shit? :D
,nignug,2012-11-28T04:27Z,F.Y.I. this game won't be released for another week. Just be happy the game actually is working already. We can probably expect a fix for the in-game audio in the next few days.
,junk33,2012-11-28T04:27Z,Nf
,dellamorte666,2012-11-28T04:38Z,Will we see the english dialogue fix tonight?? I want to play so bad.
,fuqUfag,2012-11-28T05:25Z,"This bullshit doesn't work! These files are USELESS, do NOT download them.  Upload the ""MULTICOMMON_ENGLISH.DAT"" and the ""MULTICOMMON.ENGLISH.FAT"" FILES YOU FUCKING MORON!

,ShadowJax04,2012-11-28T05:55Z,"@fuqufaq

You are a lonely jew.

@Just find scavenge the remaining English files from other downloads."
,ShadowJax04,2012-11-28T05:56Z,"@fuqufaq

You are a lonely jew.

@Everyone else: just scavenge the remaining English files from other downloads."
,Caladbolg,2012-11-28T06:08Z,"@nignug

The hell are you talking about? This game is released tomorrow in Europe."
,nignug,2012-11-28T07:19Z,"@Caladbolg

You sir...are correct."
,fuqUfag,2012-11-28T07:20Z,"@ ShadowJax04

why don't you just tell us where you found the missing english files instead of dicking us around? ALL of the available FC3 releases have the missing english files problem, so how in the fuck where you even able to find them? tell us where to find them or stop lying"
,v3rbal,2012-11-28T07:52Z,"I don't think fuqufaq has the multicommon file that is missing for the game.  He didn't report that he got the audio working either.  You guys will just have to wait for a proper release or until someone comes out with an audio fix.  The game hasn't even hit retail yet, so thanks for the effort from the uploader to have it out already.  Plus no one has bought the game , what'd expect?"
,maloskenxD,2012-11-28T08:46Z,I have bought it :/ i just cant wait hahaha
,Cortana777,2012-11-28T09:18Z,"sound.dat/fat & and multicommon_russian.dat/fat are missing. You cant change the language to English, only the Menu is in English -.-"
,Zebra667,2012-11-28T09:49Z,"THERE ARE NO ENGLISH FILES FOR THE RUSSIAN COPY OF FARCRY3!

I say again (for those that obviously don't hear anything unless it's repeated) - THERE ARE NO ENGLISH FILES FOR THE RUSSIAN COPY OF FARCRY3!

All 'English fixes' as of 3am on Nov 28th DO NOT WORK! While you may get some form of English in the menus, you will have NO audio and no English voice overs!

WHOEVER SAYS OTHERWISE, again as of right now, IS LYING!

Clear enough?

The files needed are the English version of the 'multicommon' files and they DO NOT exist at this time...they may appear at any time from 'the scene' but as of right now, they DO NOT exist.

However, the game is still playable with Russian and English sub-titles...YMMV...

THAT IS ALL. "
,GrimThe,2012-11-28T11:29Z,I've applied this as directed but its still in Russian what am I missing?.
,Sicklymade,2012-11-28T12:44Z,"I replaced the files, and even DELETED the russian ones. I can' get this menu in ENGLISH! I don't care about audio, but some people are saying subtitles? I  will play with subtitles, but I need the menu in english to adjust video/audio options =/

Anyone know whats wrong? there isn't a russian file in either of the folders, how is it getting russing info?"
,paindamnation,2012-11-28T13:36Z,"click start on windows desktop , type RUN in the search file then type regedit press enter , then look for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/wow6432node/Ubisoft/Farcry3
Then
you will see language russian change it to English and you will see sku rus change it for EN
Remove the russian.bat and .fat files from the directories, and it will be in english."
,paindamnation,2012-11-28T13:42Z,"I also can confirm this is working just fine. Instructions were taken from another website, I kept the russian files in the main sound folder, you don't hear any dialogue audio, but gun shots car audio sounds all work, so once you get the english.bat /fat files should be fine."
,GrimThe,2012-11-28T15:21Z,So now the menu is in English but I cant change the subtitles to English?.
,greyMotion,2012-11-28T17:50Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7868450

Working fix!"
,greyMotion,2012-11-28T18:02Z,"Here's your proper fix:

,Bkp666,2012-11-28T22:49Z,Subtitles are still in russian :o
,virtualmatrix258,2012-12-01T21:04Z,Don't download greymotion's crap. It was taken from another failed upload.
