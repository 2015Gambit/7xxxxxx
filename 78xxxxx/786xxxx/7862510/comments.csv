,garry8,2012-11-27T21:13Z,"Yes, favorites do work on this version"
,Dem0n1337,2012-11-28T02:57Z,"No you cant save servers to favorites in this version. After you add the server, if you quit the game, the servers are gone. FUCK THIS SHIT."
,garry8,2012-11-29T17:17Z,"Yes, you CAN save favorites in this release of CS 1.6. It has been tested on Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8. If you can't, then you apparently have installed another release of game, not this one.."
