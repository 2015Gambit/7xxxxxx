Mayhem String Band  -  Land pirates (2009) 320kbps


Youngsters may not know this, but in the old days not all people knew how to danceΓÇöwell, not by city standards. They didn't have time to learn and many probably didn't want to. A little boot-stompin', a shuffle or a mild sway did for many. Others knew only the two-step or the waltz. Ever notice how much of the old-time music is in 2/2 or 3/4 time? There is a reason.

This album is packed with modern-but-authentic old-timey stuff, all of it reeking of barn dance. Slow waltz (Comoto Waltz). Fast waltz (Sins of Her Sisters). Two-step (and a fast oneΓÇöSatan's Bait). Regular two-step (Joy and Pain, which has an eerily close resemblance to what the Grateful Dead used to play at times). And the obligatory hoe-down (Fly Around My Pretty Little Pink, a very Darlin' Boys arrangement).
