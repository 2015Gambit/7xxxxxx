A fresh approach to one of contemporary composition's most iconoclastic and
inventive figures, issued on the occasion of John Cage's 100th birthday.
Early Cage is the subject here, strikingly original songs and piano pieces
from the 1930s and 1940s. Songs in which Cage sets words by writers whose
vision was as independent as his own - James Joyce, Gertrude Stein,
E. E. Cummings. As Paul Griffiths writes, "The music exists in singing that
has a raw, living edge, and it exists in piano tone that can be utterly simple
and utterly remarkable. There is also a third presence that of the producer,
bringing forward the extraordinary resonances that come from Lubimov's piano,
with preparation or without." Lubimov championed Cage's work in Russia and
later had a close working relationship with the composer. He grasps both the
playfulness of the music and its message of freedom.

Recorded December 2011 in Zurich.
