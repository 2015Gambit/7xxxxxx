Calligraphy is both an art and a skill. Unlike with many other crafts, a person cannot develop good calligraphy skills simply by picking up the pen and practicing. There are many details about how to load the pen, how to hold it at an exact angle to the paper, even how to form each letter of each alphabet style one stroke at a time. Without proper training, the crafter will soon give up and consider it too hard to learn. This book starts at the very beginning, teaching all the fine points about calligraphy with practice drills and easy projects to begin with. Then, new and more difficult skills are introduced gradually through more practice drills and projects. Like other books in the 101 series, the book is written for the absolute beginner with detailed instructions, tips, and quick references all aimed at helping the crafter achieve success.
