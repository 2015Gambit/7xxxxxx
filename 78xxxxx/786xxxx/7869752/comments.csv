[V],HeroMaster,2012-11-29T05:55Z,ENJOY Baldurs gate Enhanced Edition new PC Game by SKIDROW!
,nignug,2012-11-29T06:10Z,Thanks for the upload. Never got a chance to play this game. Now it will most likely work on new PCs of course. Sweet. :)
,PHDIKOULAS,2012-11-29T08:18Z,"i came 

thnx heromasta"
,sivistojko,2012-11-29T14:10Z,"Thanks!! Baldur's gate: EE, the best non hack&slash RPG of all time is finally here!"
,Bundzy,2012-11-29T15:44Z,"After installation, it says ""missing openal32.dll"". Reinstalled it, but nothing changes. Anybody?"
,Narcozy,2012-11-29T15:45Z,Great! Thank you!
,Bundzy,2012-11-29T15:50Z,"Downloaded freaking openal32.dll, put it in game directory, game starts, but no sound. I just got my machine in order (it's little older, but runs great), so I don't wanna mess it up with suspicious dll files. Can somebody confirm that this torrent works? I usually use heromaster's torrents, and they work fine"
,kratsss,2012-11-29T16:13Z,Download http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip to squash the openal.dll error. Enjoy.
,Bundzy,2012-11-29T16:41Z,"Worked like a charm. Thanks, kratsss. I'm off to forget social life and probably divorce my wife:)"
,anarchcow,2012-11-29T17:11Z,Any chance you can upload only the cracked content at some point?
,DAlignment,2012-11-29T19:31Z,"Having the exact same problem as Bundzy, if anyone knows of a solution that'd be great."
,DAlignment,2012-11-29T19:45Z,"Followed Kratsss advice and it seemed to work, sound and all, thanks!"
,Longhat,2012-11-29T20:19Z,When it comes to steam I will buy it. Im picky. Not a steam fanboy but I already have 110 games on it. 
,nAsylum,2012-11-29T21:04Z,"When I try to open it, a box pops up that says, ""You have signed out of your Beamdog player, please sign in and try again."" After I close that box, another box pops up saying, ""Application corrupt."" Help?"
,hellari,2012-11-29T21:11Z,"Guys,
Here's a fix for you:

I had same issue when trying to start the game (first asked for openal32.dll and after installing it still had problems).
The problem was that I had OpenAL installed already, so I went to CP and uninstalled it from the system, rebooted, installed it again and voila!, game works fine now.
You don't have to copy openal32.dll in BG folder."
,Tsusaku,2012-11-29T21:31Z,"Kratsss: thanks now it works, like it should."
,tikigod317,2012-11-29T22:44Z,I have the same issue as nAsylum... anyone know a solution?
,jon8282,2012-11-30T01:00Z,Thank you kratsss. Your link fixed my no sound problem!
,sdnl1j2,2012-11-30T01:37Z,"@Longhat

Agree with you, i only buy games on steam if its not on steam then this has to be the way to get it.
devs please keep this in mind."
,hashiro28,2012-11-30T02:15Z,"Installed, copied the crack that was provided, was getting the openal.dll error - Followed 'Kratssss' instructions & installed openAL - Now when I go to open the exe - Nothing happens. No error Message. Nothing. Ive tried rebooting, running as Admin, etc.

Any ideas?"
,hashiro28,2012-11-30T02:17Z,a
,hashiro28,2012-11-30T06:13Z,"I figured out my problem. I right clicked the exe > properties > forced compatiblity mode for windows 7, and to force always run as admin.

So basically, I forced it to open.. how it should open anyway, since im on windows 7 + admin.

No idea why that fixed it. but it did. 

(along with installing openAL)"
,michal_ssj,2012-11-30T10:09Z,"Guys, I have a very strange problem with this game. 

It seems to work properly but when the first cinematic shows up it freezes. The only way to proceed is by skipping it by a double-click. Then again - everything seems to work, I can create a character and so on but when the actual game is supposed to start it crashes to desktop. I tried reinstalling the game and even downloaded it from a different torrent but every time I have exactly the same problem. 

Please, help me. I've been waiting for this game for months."

,Bundzy,2012-11-30T10:29Z,"Installed openal drivers, game starts, there are sounds, so far so good. BUT there are still some sound issues. sound sets aren't playing, certain dialogs from key npcs aren't playing. Is that a problem with the game itself, or is it something with drivers? I am glad that TPB exists because otherwise I would be playing sollitaire all the time, so this isn't me looking into gifted horses mouth, merely technical curiosity."
,PHDIKOULAS,2012-11-30T12:10Z,"torrent is fine

,Serenifly,2012-12-01T01:29Z,"Did SKIDROW somehow mess with the folder structure? I can't get the override folder to work. People say there is supposed to be a ""data/00766"" folder, but it's not there"
,Qusity,2012-12-01T02:19Z,For the people having the Beamdog Player issue: Make sure you write over the .exe with Skidrow's crack.
,dayf0x,2012-12-01T04:53Z,"Its working fine, but i do not know why it lags so much when i play."

,fire__fox,2012-12-02T12:25Z,"For people complaint no sound, this is because two openal driver is missing. OpenAL32.dll and wrap_oal.dll. Just copy these two file to the game folder from other game folder, for example from :Mass EffectBinaries."
,JAEVEAN,2012-12-03T11:03Z,Thanks kratsss game works fine all i did was download open it and bang good game with sound first try!!

Edit the
