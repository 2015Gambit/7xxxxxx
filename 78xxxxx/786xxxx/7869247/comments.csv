,crwildman,2012-11-29T07:33Z,"So since this is a/v 10 / 10, I guess you think a blueray movie is 15/15 ?  Wtf dude?  If you don't know how to leave accurate a/v then stfu and don't even comment.   At best this could be a 9/9 if a blueray would be 10/10.   Think about it moron."

,jarvarro,2012-11-29T09:00Z,"@crwildman rating is based on the rip that it is, not against other rips. Why would you rate a cam or TS vs a blue ray. Think about it moron."
,crwildman,2012-11-29T09:44Z,"If your DVD is an aspect ratio of 4:3 then DVD's use (Europe) 720 x 576 pixels and all NTSC (north American) DVD's use 720 x 480 pixels. This means a perfect aspec 0.  Perfect.   And, since we must resize in blocks of 16 x 16 pixels, this makes the following the closest sizes. Remember that the closer to 1.33:1 it is the more exact the aspect ratio to a 4:3 TV screen.  This would be the perfect ratio,  and a 10/10.  
720 x 544	1.32:1    Anyways, not going to waste any more time feeding the trolls.   A/9 V/9  Thanks for the Upload, great quality as always from you."

,jakenator,2012-11-29T14:30Z,@crwildman: I have been downloading movies for years and I never heard of someone rating one movie quality to say a dvd rip or blueray. So get off your high horse of retardation and stop dissing people for rating movies normally.
,kevink9362,2012-11-29T15:10Z,No shit dumbass crwildman ok so if a perfect DVDrip is a 9/9 then whats a perfect Cam 8/8 ?? I need to know this correct rating system.... F-ing MORON you rate it 1 to 10 based on the quality jackass

,likman666,2012-11-29T16:18Z,you pipo here are not clear is this a cam or a true dvd rip
,tobbe908,2012-11-29T17:27Z,"@crwildman, Exactly what is a 10/10 in your perspective? DVD-rip: 1/1, 720p: 2/2, Bluray: 5/5 and 4k is 10/10? Couldn't find a place for 3D there, don't know how to rate it with others.
I think it's a bit smarter to rank them after the type of rip so we don't have to change the ranks after every new quality that comes out (Thinking on 4k there, don't think that's the last quality). Have worked for years on loads of sites and don't think you can change it anywhere, your system is just crap."

,SativaMeAt420,2012-11-29T22:58Z,"Thanks for the upload!

Just FYI: The ratings should be based off the format the file is in, if its DVD then a rating of 1/1 would be the worst DVD quality you've ever seen, a rating of 10/10 would be considered perfect DVD quality rip, if the format was Bluray then again a rating of 1/1 would be the worst Bluray quality and a rating of 10/10 would be considered perfect Bluray quality rip, it wouldn't make sense to have the same rating for all formats, get it, its not fucking rocket science people."

10/10 great upload!"
,Razr92,2012-11-30T00:31Z,"@crwildman 

1. Bluray is not the highest quality atm even , Moron.

2. The quality of the ""upload"" where you are commenting is based on a meter of 1-10, its not compared to any other upload or format, Moron.

3. The raw output format is Bluray doesnt mean it has a set resolution or same encode routine as others. Most movies these days use top notch direct encoders that use cuda cores right away and may perform bad on a generic pcs on entry lvl gfx cards when downgraded to generic bluray single or double pass rips. That doesnt mean its a shyt bluray rip or anything. Moron."
,Infecthead,2012-11-30T01:13Z,"Why do you guys keep saying ""1/1"", ""2/2"", ""5/5"", etc.? That's the exact same as ""10/10"", they both equal 1/100%/whatever. I'm guessing you're trying to say ""1/10"" with the ""1/1"", however it does get slightly confusing.

Downloading now, thanks Lum1x/s4a"
,SativaMeAt420,2012-11-30T02:11Z,"@Infecthead, The rating goes from 1-10 for both Audio & Video (A/V), the first number rates the Audio quality, the second number rates the Video quality."

Thank God. I though no-one else was noticing that. Like the guy who responded to you, who had no idea what you were talking about.

Perhaps a standard should be set?
I, like most people, rate the quality based on the rip.
So a 10-10 dvd-rip is about equal to a 7/10 bluray rip.

Its the only way to really make sense of it for people.

Many people rate it purely on quality, regardless of rip, which can prevent people from downloading a good quality cam.

And i'll end my rant by joining the mob by adding...

,flgator32,2012-12-01T01:01Z,"Thanks for your upload. I would said its about a 7/10 video and 9/10 audio. THE MOVIE WAS CRAP, sorry but it had to be a 2/10. Why do they stray so far from the games? The games are not girlpower fighting action games. They are slow, horrifying, gross tales that rely mostly on the element of mystery and surprises. This movie was so unexciting and never surprising. It was the worst thing ever declared resident evil cannon. I don't suggest avoiding it just don't plan to be happy with it"

Ratings should be based on the individual's opinion on the quality of the upload and not on a uniform/standardised rating vs format system. Anyone who is downloading this file knows it's a DVDRip and not BluRay or TS and being no 2 files are compared side by side only this file is being rated therefore if you think this DVDRip is perfect DVD quality a 10/10 rating is warranted. This is how i rate and anyone not liking it can disregard my opinion and move on to someone else. 

Again, mucho appreciato the upload :-)  "
