,southak,2012-11-30T20:18Z,Garbage tv show. 
,ScarletteSpider,2012-12-02T03:55Z,"episode 8 aired last night, plz upload? btw...anyone that read the green arrow comics in the 50's 60's and 70's knows that the storyline for this show is dead on with only a few updates to make it more current with the timeline of today. Anyone that trashes comic hero shows that are this well written, produced, acted and researched is uninformed about comics history. If you don't have anything good to say then stfu, ur negativity is unwarranted and unwelcomed. Not to mention makes you look like a sour grapes malcontent"
,ScarletteSpider,2012-12-02T03:59Z,"just listened to the latest Smodco pod cast by Kevin Smith and the Comic Book Men. They give this show a 4 stars out of 5 rating. Would have been 5 stars but the bearded guy is hard to plz, he wants the women dressed more sleezy before he gives it 4 stars lol"
,ScarletteSpider,2012-12-02T04:00Z,I'll listen to the comic experts of Kevin Smith and the Comic Book Men before some random faceless nobody taking snarky pot shots from their keyboard
,ScarletteSpider,2012-12-02T04:02Z,"I'll listen to the comic experts of Kevin Smith and the Comic Book Men before I take snarky comments from some random faceless person seriously. They I know, the one hiding behind the keyboard i don't know or they have any credentials to back up their opinions with."
