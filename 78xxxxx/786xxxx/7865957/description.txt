Ambience Music Overhaul Skyrim Mod

version-v1.1.5.24874

Deleted off of nexus, so I decided to upload it here. Music overhaul for skyrim. This version replaces all of the music in-game. Not the "replaces only some of the music" version. It can't beat the original soundtrack of skyrim, but its a nice change to listen to something different. Also Im new to the community so I thought I'd say hi with this.
I also liked the music alot, so I decided to convert the files from .XWM to .MP3 for those who didn't want to go through the trouble. Which I will upload after this is done.
