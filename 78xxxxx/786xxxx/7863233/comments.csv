If people force them selfs to see crap quality in the first place, all those get spoiled and don't care about HD, if HD were on in the beginning more people could slowly transit to that by forcing them to upgrade their shit old PCs, net and HDD space.

Ofcourse i hate low quality so much,  I basically rather don't watch it at all than torture my self. /rant

I wouldn't mind at all if HD wasn't hindered by dragging this old standard for so long."

Don't like or want them? Then don't dl them.
Some aren't ""forcing"" themselves to watch them, it's a matter of someone else forcing them by allowing, in many countries, very restricted and small quotas.  
Also, please enlighten us on how HD is hindered by dragging this old standard for so long?
There are people still using VHS tech but I haven't felt that they are getting in the way of me using Blu-ray 3D. "
