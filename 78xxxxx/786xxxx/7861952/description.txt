"A Tree Grows in Springfield"

Lisa tries to cheer up a down-in-the-dumps 
Homer by winning him a MyPad at the school 
auction. But he falls back into a funk when 
he breaks the magical tablet device  until 
Ned Flanders discovers a miracle tree in the 
Simpsons backyard with bark that spells the 
word HOPE.
