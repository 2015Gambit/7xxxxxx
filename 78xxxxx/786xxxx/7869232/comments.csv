I think it's real, I saw people on NFO Hump talking about it."
,samstaro,2012-11-29T01:37Z,"@mercs215 Yes, this is the real version."
,theurbs,2012-11-29T01:37Z,"It almost surely is. It's on SilverTorrent, and they're a great site.

Many thanks, srkfan :D."
,corei7,2012-11-29T01:41Z,"Not sure if someone has already said this since I can't see comments for some reason unless I make one, but this same torrent is one a few big private trackers already that I have seen so far.  Pretty sure it's legit."

,downsyde,2012-12-01T00:32Z,"Works great, kinda slow but moves faster at night. Crack is on the disk 2 iso file, plays really smooth with no problems. Thank you!"
,fossil79,2012-12-02T11:59Z,"hello i have a problem with the texture. Moves Maus everything is fine and does not move when I have a bit of color, it's unclear grass and trees have a little color. is OK while moving.Excuse my English"
,razorwindmo46,2012-12-02T15:37Z,Works flawlessly. Uploading as fast as I can at 70kb/s Thats faster than any of the other peers in my swarm
,razorwindmo46,2012-12-02T16:23Z,"OOPS! I said works flawlessly? Can't continue my game. Played last night fine but, when I tried to start it up again this morning, I get to the menu but no way it will start when clicking on anything. Only exit to desktop works. Yes the crack was copied over and yes I used all the shortcuts."
,razorwindmo46,2012-12-03T00:47Z,"Might as well buy the game. Only the first autosave works. Doesn't matter where you go, if you see a save icon during the game, you will still start over at the first autosave"
