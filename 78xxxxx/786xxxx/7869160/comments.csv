Especially this very oldest version that don't sort right.

But there is one clear advantage - you can start watching early (with MKV, anyway).

Download the first piece and then unRAR with ""keep broken files"" cancel when it asks for the next one

Watch a tiny bit and then do it again, downloading in order and unRARing in order.

Pain in the Ass, but you get to watch it quicker.
