,O1dy,2012-11-29T03:09Z,"@azaq318- can you please explain what ""Files just compressed"" means? Was any of the content removed/modified in-order to make it such a small file? The game is at least 9-10GB from what I've seen.

Thank you in advance."
[V],azaq318,2012-11-29T03:29Z,"O1dy
Nothing was removed. Game files just compressed. Audio 100%, Video 100%. Nothing was ripped. That's it :)"
,Jakx717,2012-11-29T03:35Z,people are saying its still in Russian....please tell me this isnt true:(
,Jakx717,2012-11-29T03:38Z,people are saying this is still only in russian...please tell me this isnt true:(
,Jakx717,2012-11-29T03:56Z,sorry about double post 
,mimifuqi,2012-11-29T04:00Z,"wait, everyone in the torrent rating comments is saying it's russian, it is?"
,Insomneac,2012-11-29T04:02Z,"Azaq, could you please confirm that this includes all the DLC content?

Thanks."
[V],azaq318,2012-11-29T04:03Z,"Jakx717

THIS Release is in ENGLISH for SURE."
,Hitman9000,2012-11-29T04:58Z,People are reporting that even after the patch it is still in Russian...can anyone confirm? 
,Chupacabra333,2012-11-29T05:25Z,"@azaq318 Wow there!! What do you mean with ""THIS Release is in ENGLISH for SURE"" ?
Dude you havent confirmed this right?
People is saying Its in Ruskie. So I think were all screwed here, even you."
,spyke8x,2012-11-29T05:26Z,Is there any way to transfer your saves from the Steam006 crack to the RELOADED crack?
,Chupacabra333,2012-11-29T05:37Z,"Dude you deleted my comment. You havent test this. ""English for sure"" thats the proof. You dont even know."
,caseyjones32,2012-11-29T05:57Z,"""People is saying Its in Ruskie. So I think were all screwed here, even you. ""

""people are saying its still in Russian....please tell me this isnt true:( ""

Where do you see this? His previous torrent? I do not see any comments on here claiming this except from you! All of azaq's other released have worked to the word for me (Including AC3 which had the same Russian issue with other uploaders; and luckily I didn't DL his last release of FC3)

It would be nice to have a second person's confirmation at least though, or at least knowing that the English is beyond the menu.

It is released now in Europe though so I believe it, lets hope so!"
,MAA11792,2012-11-29T06:10Z,"@Chupacabra333 the comments take time to load, the servers are slow, relax."
,Chupacabra333,2012-11-29T06:41Z,"Yeah, my bad. Imma take a chill pill."
,caseyjones32,2012-11-29T07:21Z,"Won't beable to play until the morning, but like I said looks like this is the real deal :P..will seed until proven otherwise
"
,Jakx717,2012-11-29T07:48Z,"azaq318

Ah okay thx for the confirmation:) Never had any probs with your other uploads so i believe ya. "
[V],azaq318,2012-11-29T10:09Z,"Guys, this release IS NOT my old PATCHED release.  THIS is completely new release that has RELOADED multi language BASE inside. And for those of you, who have troubles with understanding what i'm saying:

Again:

""Yes, I tried this, I installed update 1.01, compress files, kept registry entries - activated ENGLISH - text and sound. So game running just fine. Just don't forget exclude Cracked Reloaded files from AV scanning, otherwise it will delete Cracked content.""

ENGLISH RELEASE from RELOADED. I just compressed files."
[V],azaq318,2012-11-29T10:11Z,It has no RUSSIAN language inside what so ever. It has English. Text and Sound. Hope i'm being clear this time ;)

,Tang76,2012-11-29T16:15Z,"This one seems to be fine when you run in dx11 also, if your PC can handle it.  Must be the update that improved the performance and crashing issues."
,marl10796,2012-11-29T17:40Z,hey guys. does this have DLC or anything?
,AlienGamer,2012-11-29T19:38Z,"@ Marl

Dont know But the Deluxe Edition  supposed to have: The Monkey Business Pack, The Lost Expeditions, The Warrior Pack, The Predator Pack and The Survival Guide artbook 

They should have specified this in the above Nfo file. It remains to be seen. Hopefully someone will tell us."
,wontquit,2012-11-29T21:11Z,"@azaq318

1st off, I appreciate all your time & effort to provide  the rest of us (""us"" meaning those who simply DL games, apps, movies, music etc. & not post torrents for others) with quality torrents.

2nd, I appreciate that I have rarely had a problem with anything you provide or understanding your instructions.

3rd, I appreciate that you are one of the few up-loaders who will actually comment back to try to help the rest of ""us"" figure something out that we should have already known or figured out ourselves.

4th if 99% of the people that are leaving stupid fucking comments would take 2 seconds to look something up or at least try to figure something out maybe more up-loaders would actually comment back.  Who wants to weed through 5 pages of worthless bullshit to find 1 valid question?

5th, thank you again."
,hewey,2012-11-29T23:53Z,Thanks so much azaq318. Runs perfectly & totally agree with wontquit.
