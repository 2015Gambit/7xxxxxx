The Flaming Lips - At War With The Mystics {24/192} 2LP Vinyl Rip

This is a special edition 2LP release of this album, with colored blue and yellow vinyl.

I record all my vinyl at 192kHz sample rates and in 32-bit float. It is then exported directly to FLAC (level 8), 24-bit.

-I DO NOT use noise removal
-I DO NOT record at any other speed than 20% less than 33 1/3 RPM (this is done with my turntable's pitch control)
-I DO normalize my audio
-I DO perform manual click repair on many (NOT ALL) clicks

Gear used:

Audio Technica AT-LP1240 USB Turntable
Shure M97xE High-Performance Magnetic Phono Cartridge

Recorded to audacity at -20% speed to ensure quality pickup of frequencies
