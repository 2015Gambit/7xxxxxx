About:
"H5 is the best available bot for Race War Kingdoms (RWK). H5 levels your 
character, plays poker, raises your skills, gathers ash, or maybe even a combo 
of all four all without you. Why spend hours clicking to make minimal gains? 
Enjoy RWK at its fullest potential by cutting out all of the tedious work."

"Full automation.

Passes security checks automatically.

A ΓÇÿprofileΓÇÖ system that makes it incredibly easy to manage one or one hundred 
characters. Just load the profile and youΓÇÖre ready to go.
Ability to simultaneously level/ash/skill as many characters as your computer 
can handle.

Can be configured to stop clicking after a certain level or a certain amount of 
time.

Highly customizable in terms of delays ΓÇô after all, itΓÇÖs rare that your 
connection will be the same as someone elseΓÇÖs, and H5 takes this into 
consideration by allowing the delays to be set by the user.

Easy to use, just read the setup guide. Once it is configured for a character, 
the settings wonΓÇÖt need to be modified again.

H5 can be minimized and still click on your characters, leaving you to get other 
things done on the computer while H5 is clicking."
