[T],webmodelsindex,2012-11-29T06:48Z,"Strange. The screen links seem to be of some video game, and not the movie. Or maybe it was the drugs playing tricks with my mind. Wait, can't be that since I don't use drugs. I couldn't have been drunk, because I don't drink. Maybe I got some STD years ago and it finally made it's way to infect my brain. Am I dying? WTF. I'm dying, aren't I? The screens man, the screens! Evil!"

Tanks!"
,Lasse_Kl,2012-11-29T19:46Z,How do you get the eng subs to work with VLC?
,pouriaarab,2012-11-29T20:00Z,"download subs from http://subscene.com, it should work with vlc automatically "
,kchamz,2012-11-29T20:08Z,"Lasse_Kl In vlc, to open the subtitle file, play the video file first and then right click on the screen and go to subtitle and open the subtitle file. That's it."
,kchamz,2012-11-29T20:13Z,"If the names of the video file and sub file are different, Copy the video file name and erase the sub file name without the extension i.e. .srt, and then paste it. Therefore, subtitle will play automatically."
,Bmack2013,2012-11-29T20:29Z,This is shitty compared to extremezones recent brrip and its only 1 file not that 2cd crap just some friendly advice check it out browse ez's uploads you cant miss it thanx anyway uploader for the effort :)
,Lasse_Kl,2012-11-29T21:06Z,"Kchamz. Playing it through Vlc on a Mac, doesn't seem to work, but thanks anyway!"

A/V - Didnt even watch.  2 CD's is total shit."
,DodgeNeonRT,2012-11-30T02:29Z,"What's with this bullshit of splitting it into CDs? What is this, 1993? Give me a break.  Maybe not a problem if you're watching it on the small screen with VLC, but a total pain in the ass if you're streaming it to your TiVo to watch on the big screen."

,peopelle,2012-11-30T18:26Z,"Bmack
What the friggin' hell is your problem ?
What we have here is a great guy ( srkfan) who's been so nice and uploaded a very good copy of a movie we want to watch.
He makes it possible for us to download his piece of  work at no cost at all , no hassel , no problem.
Now you come in here criticising his fine piece of work , how the hell do you get that to add up ?"

,Bmack2013,2012-12-01T04:00Z,@peopelle 1st off he's 1 in a list of many who do this for us lets be fair on that i have no problem with the uploader im very grateful for every uploader out ther who takes the time to give us free movies games music etc on the greatest p2p file shareing site on the face of the planet the past 9yrs TPB!! so to your point yes this torrent is of great quality very true its a trusted uploader as you can see from the purple skull (trusted) how could it not be the skulls dont come easy its the 2 files thats the problem so all i was suggesting to people was you could download a much better 1 filed brrip from a different v.i.p uploader (green skull) which happened to be extremezone at the time who had the file up the exact same day as this 1 and its a whole lot better trust me ez's a v.i.p uploader on tpb (green skull) its were i get alot of my torrents hes been on here years srkfan is only a trusted uploader (purple skull) at the moment still great work from him like all uploaders with green pink and blue skulls he'll get a green 1 soon if he keeps up the good work hes doing so to srkfan keep up the good work man that green skull wont be far away for you :) well peopelle hope i added up enough for you thats if you even knew about the colour of skulls the beauty of tpb is thers always better quality here if you know were and what to look for seeders and leechers mean nothing if you know who to trust been on here years thats why i go with green skulls which are only given to v.i.p's says it all in my book !! PEACE FELLOW PIRATES :)

Read these two articles and read the comments:

http://torrentfreak.com/best-vpn-proxy-bittorrent-110618/

http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/

I've read both, but every service has people claiming it sucks. I don't know what way to go myself, but i need to get protected too. 

Anyone have any advice?
