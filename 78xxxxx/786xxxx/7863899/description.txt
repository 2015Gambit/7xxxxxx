At Paramedic College a class of new recruits are nearing their final assessments but before they can begin their on-road training there's one more hurdle to jump. The tough 'major trauma' assessment. They'll be treating a simulated patient.

If Reynir and Blake fail this test, they could be out of a job.

Jenna's been out of college for eight weeks with mentor Cleone. Today she's called to her first pedestrian collision. A car has struck a teenage-boy and, with pedestrian deaths accounting for about 13% of all road fatalities, Jenna's patient is lucky to be alive - although it's the injuries Jenna can't see that have her worried. Compassion is perhaps the biggest pre-requisite to becoming a Paramedic and after two months as a trainee, Rebecca's had plenty of time to reflect on this very human quality. When her father was dying of cancer, it was the compassion shown to him by a nurse that made Rebecca change careers and become a Paramedic. Now the mother of three is called to a job close to her heart when a 67 year-old cancer patient is in great pain.
