,pharmakate,2012-12-03T04:03Z,"Sorry you did so much work on this, because there are other versions out there, some of which seem better than this. I have one that looks like it's close to a retail version.

OCRing and proofing books is a great thing to do, but I recommend you visit relevant forums to ask other ebook sharing fanatics if a book you want to work on already exists in a good epub/mobi/rtf/whatever format.

These days ""official"" versions of classics are appearing so fast you're taking a risk of wasting your time if you proof any book that's in print and still popular - you may see a v5.0 a week after you finish your v1.0!"
