Dynamite Hack - Boyz-In-The-Hood

"...there have been many remakes, most notably a cover by alternative rock band Dynamite Hack, which hit #12 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks in 2000. The last line of the Dynamite Hack version of the song, "Punkass trippin in the dead of night... homie scored a key, hes gonna fly, punkass fly..." is sung to the tune of the opening melody of Beatles song "Blackbird"- "Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to fly." - Wikipedia
