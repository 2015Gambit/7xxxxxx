,lugia4000,2012-11-27T23:11Z,"Most of the torrents from this guy are real but they get alot of hate. Mostly because he doesnt include crack.

Also this is real guys. Other hosts indicate 7.3GB ISO in parts, its probably real."

in regedit search for your farcry registry then change the language registry to ""English"" then SKU registry to ""US"".
Then delete ALL files with the word russian voice files in data_win32 and worlds/fc3_main.
Full english! Enjoy!"

,Zebra667,2012-11-28T09:46Z,"THERE ARE NO ENGLISH FILES FOR THE RUSSIAN COPY OF FARCRY3!

I say again (for those that obviously don't hear anything unless it's repeated) - THERE ARE NO ENGLISH FILES FOR THE RUSSIAN COPY OF FARCRY3!

All 'English fixes' as of 3am on Nov 28th DO NOT WORK! While you may get some form of English in the menus, you will have NO audio and no English voice overs! 

WHOEVER SAYS OTHERWISE, again as of right now, IS LYING!

Clear enough?

The files needed are the English version of the 'multicommon' files and they DO NOT exist at this time...they may appear at any time from 'the scene' but as of right now, they DO NOT exist.

However, the game is still playable with Russian and English sub-titles...YMMV...

THAT IS ALL."
,Cortana777,2012-11-28T09:49Z,You need to upload: multicommon_russian.dat/fat (225MB) & fc3_main_russian.dat/fat (200MB) & sound_english.dat/fat (1KB) to get english voice output.
,jimbo_swe,2012-11-28T12:43Z,"How to get it work in full english (menus + voice)

Install game and crack Uplay.

Download english files from
http://malaysiabay.org:6081/torrent/7865913/Far_cry_3_ENGLISH_Files

Follow instructions in torrent.
Backup russian files in case.

open start in windows and search for ""regedit"" and a window will open.

Now search for ""far cry"".

Change every ""russian"" entry.
You will only see one hit at a time. So if can't see any or already changed every entry, you will have to go for the next (or shortcut press F3)
To edit an entry, just right click -> edit.
One entry should say ""SKU - RUS"". Change RUS to ""US"". You should see it when you're searching for ""far cry""

Play!

If Uplay won't start because it's ""updating"". Disable your network card, once you've started Uplay and see the login display, it should be no problem to enable your network card.

If you see a black screen after loading the game. reinstall Uplay and be sure you not start Uplay before you've disconnected your network card."
