"The But in the Joke"

A street artist, who is covertly 
plastering his art on a billboard, 
falls and lands directly into his own 
glue - and into human remains. So the 
team must not only figure out the 
identity of the remains, but must 
also find a strategic way to remove 
the part of the corpse that is still 
glued to the street artist. 
Meanwhile, Booth tries his hand at a 
comedy club's "open mic" night in 
order to seek out potential suspects 
and Angela's love of art leads her to 
become attracted to the street 
artist.
