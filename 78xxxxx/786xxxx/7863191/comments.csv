,tflagger997,2012-11-27T17:27Z,"Kripke usually does a boring before one with a lot of action.  Too bad the quality has slid so far from the first ep.  The show is down below 7M viewers, and with a four month hiatus (Mar. 26 is ep. 11 air date) it will probably be down into the 5.5M range which puts it on the edge of cancellation (Last Resort had 5.68M and it was just axed).

Thanks EZ you are the best!"
