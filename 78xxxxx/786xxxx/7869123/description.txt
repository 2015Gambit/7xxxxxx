When Lexie Marshall places an ad for a cycling companion, she hopes to find someone friendly and fun to cross the TransAmerica Trail with. Instead, she gets Tom GeigerΓÇöa lean, sexy loner whose bad attitude threatens to spoil the adventure sheΓÇÖs spent years planning.
 
Roped into the cycling equivalent of a blind date by his sister, Tom doesnΓÇÖt want to ride with a chatty, go-by-the-map kind of woman, and he certainly doesnΓÇÖt want to want her. Too bad the sight of Lexie with a bike between her thighs really turns his crank.
 
Even TomΓÇÖs stubborn determination to keep Lexie at a distance canΓÇÖt stop a kiss from leading to endless nights of hotter-than-hot sex. But when the wild ride ends, where will they go next?
