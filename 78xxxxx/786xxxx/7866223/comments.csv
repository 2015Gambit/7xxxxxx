,michilllie,2012-11-28T08:50Z,You're not kidding about the slow download. I've been trying for over an hour and it's still at 0% download. I guess I'm in for a long haul. Thank you for your efforts. I can't wait for it to finally download and watch it. The book was excellent.

thanks!"

Be patient!  Like I said, it would be a slow upload, and I am the only person who has this, so need to plead with the other seeders to seed this, as I am the only one.  Hang in there, and be grateful I am offering this in BluRay (vs god awful dvdrip...)"
