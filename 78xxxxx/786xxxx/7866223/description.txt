NOTE: THIS WILL BE A SLOW UPLOAD, TAKING AT LEAST THREE (3) DAYS AND POSSIBLY UP TO A FULL WEEK, SO PLEASE BE PATIENT!  I DO NOT HAVE CONSTANT INTERNET ACCESS, SO MANY TIMES THERE WILL BE NO SEEDERS.  TO MAKE THIS UPLOAD NOT QUITE AS SLOW, IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED IF YOU ALL UPLOADED TO EACH OTHER.  THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE!

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: The SAiMORNY release came with no subtitles.  I downloaded HDTV subtitles, but it was absolutely impossible to sync them up no matter what I did, so there are no subtitles.

NOTE: Two samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

Enjoy, please seed, rate, and comment!
