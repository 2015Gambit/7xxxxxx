The Inspection (Aired Nov. 14th 2012)

Description (from iTunes): A surprise inspection puts Tremont's survival in jeopardy. Robbie gets blasted with an earful while locked inside a repo> Bernice saves the day, but more bad news brings big changes.

Notes:

* I only post episodes for South Beach Tow and Operation Repo when xgimpyx is unable to. He's always done a great job at keeping us up to date on these shows, and several others. The real credit goes to him! Also, both SBT and Op Repo are (in some areas) available on iTunes in High-Def for $2.99 USD. Something to keep in mind if another episode is missed, and you want it sooner. :)

* The episode number in the title may not be correct, depending on which episode list you use. Title and description are provided to make sure you're downloading the right one.
