Handler co-executive produces this new weekly talk show starring Cummings, her laptop and her sidekick McCullough. Cummings will dish on Hollywood gossip, pop culture, hot news stories and more. Her stinky self-titled sitcom made us forget that she can be wickedly clever, and while the late-night landscape is suddenly crowded with female-targeted talk shows, Cummings should find an audience after The Soup.
