As the British singles chart celebrates its 60th anniversary, BBC Four will be
broadcasting a special documentary that will take a unique look back at the
secret history of the top ten.

Since 1952 - the year the NME invented the British singles chart - we have
mapped out our lives to the free ebb and flow of charting pop. We have ritualised
and shared the experience of the charts on radio and on TV. Whether sitting
around the television set with the entire family discussing an edition of Top
Of The Pops in the seventies or taping Dr Fox or Mark Goodier in the secrecy of
our bedrooms, our experience of the charts was a part of growing up. You couldnΓÇÖt
ignore them - at the very least they were a topic of conversation in everyday life

For their part, the charts, as the ultimate expression of the consumer, have said
more about British popular culture than the history books would care to admit
The charts show that the spirit of the age is sometimes better represented by the
really tacky than the profound.

From the record industryΓÇÖs involvement, to illegal downloading and the effect
this had on the sale of singles, to the 2006 surge in online music buying
the documentary will provide a fascinating insight into the secret history of
the top ten.

BBC broadcasters including David Jacobs, Pete Murray, Bob Harris, Paul Gambaccini
and Reggie Yates, alongside pop legends like Sir Cliff Richard, pop fans and chart
enthusiasts like Grace Dent and music biz insiders like Jon Webster and Rob Dickins
contribute to the programme.
