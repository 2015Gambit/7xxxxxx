"Emily and... The Question of Faith"

Emily and Tyra's infant patient seems perfectly 
normal until they discover she has a condition 
that forces her parents to make a difficult 
decision about her future. Emily's is assigned 
to Dr. Bandari's deeply religious patient who 
finds his faith shaken after a risky surgery. 
Will becomes impatient waiting for his 
patient's lab work and takes a chance on a 
possible diagnosis, breaking protocol and 
upsetting Micah. Meanwhile, Tyra is finally 
ready to tell her father the truth about being 
a lesbian and seeks out Emily for support, but 
before she can reveal her secret, she gets 
shocking news of her own.
