Ben Gurion Version 2.0 for FSX is completely overhauled and includes many new additions, caused by the work going on at the airfield in real life! Most of these changes did not exist yet back in January 2011.

The work on the real airport started a week or two before we released the first version and some of its steel under construction will continue for two years. What I did is I finished most of what will be ready in the near future. For example in reality the Runway 03-21 will be extended but as for now they didn`t start work on it and it is totally closed and blocked. The 12-30 will be also close for two years !

Changes/additions:

Seven new taxiways, all with: 
Standing signs and taxiway markings 
Taxiway lighting 
The sides blue light 
Green in the center 
Red on stops 
Changed most of the ground poly (asphalt with taxiway lines) 
Changed the AFCAD to fit the new taxiways 
Extended the 08 runway 
And finally drew all this on the photoreal Two Seasons and Night 
As a bonus I add few important buildings
