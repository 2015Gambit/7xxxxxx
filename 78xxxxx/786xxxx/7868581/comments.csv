Thank you Hollywood!"
,Bangarazz,2012-11-29T20:44Z,"I have downlaod the subs, but they wont play on the file. Do I have to burn it ?"

,michaelrwatson,2012-11-29T23:40Z,"NOTE: BOTH of those links above are to sub files for the WHOLE movie, i.e. even the English parts. Pretty stupid (although subs for the Mandarin parts are in there too). 

Why not just hardcode the subs for the Mandarin parts..?? This is an English movie, after all."
,nairobi19,2012-11-30T01:47Z,"a truly shit film. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. 

I give it 2/10. 

One point for each hot girl in the movie. 

Otherwise, piece of shit."
,beechyboy,2012-11-30T14:55Z,"You must be some kind of idiot nairobi19 to make a comment like that!
Rotton Tomatoes rates it 85% AND IMdB rates it a 7
Obviously your rating of this movie is a very limited opinion...  "
,PlutosCharm,2012-11-30T18:36Z,I think that girl's the model for the Indian in AC3
,76robert,2012-12-01T10:23Z,"This is not a Hollywood movie. This is another copy of European movie, more precisely the Franch movie. See the movie ""Coursier"" from 2010 and tell me which one is better"

I'm surprised the budget was that big for this movie, looks more like a 2-5mil movie.

M - 3/10"
