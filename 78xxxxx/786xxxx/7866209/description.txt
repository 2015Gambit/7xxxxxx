"The Walk for the Runs"

When the annual Angry Bowel Syndrome (ABS) 
1K walk comes to Natesville, the Chance 
family decides to band together and support 
the cause that Jimmy suffered from as a 
child. Meanwhile, Burt and Virginia start to 
feel the effects of aging, and Jimmy 
struggles to support Sabrina in a fight with 
her ex-boyfriend when she is clearly in the 
wrong.
