,rmekdaschi,2012-11-30T00:50Z,can someone tell me if this has the black bars?
,MrOpposite,2012-11-30T15:06Z,"@rmekdaschi

According to the video description the resolution is:
Aspect            : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 23.976 fps

That is 16:9, which is what most screens today uses.

If the description is correct, this movie shouldn't have any letterbox-borders on most screens today.


TL; DR Probably not."
,JoeMatey,2012-11-30T21:37Z,"@ rmekdaschi.  Yes, this does have black bars throughout the movie.  :("
,JoeMatey,2012-11-30T21:40Z,"Adding more detail.  The black bars are on the top and bottom of the screen during many scenes throughout the movie.  It is not a complete ""FULL SCREEN"" HD movie, throughout."

Aspect ratio
1.44 : 1 (some scenes: IMAX version)
2.35 : 1

Why is so hard to get proper fact before posting JoeMatey "

The reason for this is because some scenes were shot with an IMAX camera and others with the usual. The IMAX cameras have an aspect ratio of 1.44:1 while the usual one used in most films has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Because of this, some scenes will have black bars, because some scenes were recorded with a camera that records a larger portion of the screen than the one used in the scenes with black bars. There's no way to make it ""fullscreen hd movie"" without cropping out some parts of the scene or stretching it, which I think would be worse because it would not stay true to the intended look of the scene."
