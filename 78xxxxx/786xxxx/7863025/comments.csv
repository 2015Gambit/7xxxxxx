,JPodlewski,2012-11-27T06:40Z,what happens if i play online early with LT 3.0 ?
,angsang_wsj,2012-11-27T07:01Z,"^^^ OMG are people still asking that question
THANKS FOR THE UP !!"
,P_Greezy,2012-11-27T11:16Z,"wow been downloading for 7 hours and only at 8.2% ppl need to seed, ima try another source because this is way to slow"
,pirates4eva,2012-11-27T12:09Z,"@P_Greezy. why don't you try USENET (NZB'S) I downloaded this in 8 mins using usenet.Torrents are utter shite.All the leaching cunts....with usenet you aint got to care about leachers because you download directly from a server.Usenet FTW, Torrents for gimps.I only come on here to laugh at people downloading for days...I'll have had the game complete by the time most people on here have even downloaded 10%.USENET also gets the content long before they hit torrent sites..most of the time.I would realy recomend giving it ago..."
,P_Greezy,2012-11-27T12:35Z,@pirates4eva - Thanks bruh I will check that out! Do you gotta pay for a usenet account because that what it says on the site?
,ClipperCigars,2012-11-27T12:56Z,Not to mention usenet is truly anonymous. No need to use stupid proxies and crap to hide yourself from the trackers. 
,wakymaky666,2012-11-27T14:06Z,26 seeders and 4812 leechers. hahahah this will most probably take a month to download
,dadicer,2012-11-27T14:16Z,"@pirates4eva 

LOL you actually waste your day coming to the torrent sites just to post !@#$ and promote usenet?

Man you must be one lonely SOB.  

Torrents are good enough for the masses and if anyone is really that freaked out about the need to remain anonymous then get a Seed Box.  Helps boost ratios and keeps you off your internet providers !@#$ list."
,R0YB0Y,2012-11-27T15:07Z,Yes Usenet Is Great But it cost Money If you want a fast Download tr a private torrent site like torrentday or scenetime or speedcd!!
,P_Greezy,2012-11-27T15:31Z,"Btw, Im almost done downloading this game from another site, direct links are so much faster, will let everybody kno how it runs on lt 3.0 with overburn method!"
,phoeniks314,2012-11-27T16:31Z,i hope this runs on lt2.0+trancute???
,P_Greezy,2012-11-27T20:04Z,I can confirm this game works perfectly using OVERBURN method without ihas on lt 3.0!
,xbox86,2012-11-28T00:29Z,http://scebb.net/far-cry-3-xbox360-complex-rapidshare
,xbox86,2012-11-28T00:42Z,OK....goame
,CPx1989,2012-11-28T04:57Z,holy that is a lot of leachers and its not even that old and the game hasnt even came out yet
,phoeniks314,2012-11-28T08:51Z,Ok it works on lt2.0 truncate
,Abbotta4,2012-11-28T10:59Z,"Burning this game with iXtreme Burner MAX and flashing your drive with the latest firmware from http://c4evaspeaks.com/ is the only way you can play this game without getting banned if you are on a system without a chip/vanilla nand. Truncating the disc will get you banned. If you play the game before it is released, you will probably also get banned. For those of you (like myself) who like to play games early, consider looking into the ""reset glitch hack."""
,mamude,2012-11-28T18:49Z,"Why this rip is 7.45GB? I've downloaded from xboxpirate.eu (8.45GB) and truncate mode (LT 3.0) doesn't work for me, so if this torrent works with truncate, I will be glad if someone confirm. I never tried burning with Overburn method."
,Joey249,2012-11-29T03:04Z,"What is used to extrat the R files?
This is the first time I downloaded a game in this format.....
Im not burning to a disk, just need to extract it to the file contents to put on my USB and then JTAG.
Please, if you know send a email to:
JO3Y1997@hotmail.com
To be honest, I dont really care of I get spam mail from anybody as its not my mail email but I will be checking it for replies so please let me know what is used the extract the game when its in this format. 
Thanks :)"
,Ohyesuare,2012-11-29T13:10Z,Use WinRAR to extract the files. I find it odd you figured out how to download torrents and transfer files to your modded xbox but not extract a rar file.
,boneyjr,2012-11-29T15:06Z,"Answer: Yes

Question: Does this work, and is it the greatest game ever.

LOVE IT"
,fanfasnight,2012-11-29T15:44Z,OK people abgx verified....good playing
,mateka1992,2012-11-29T16:57Z,"I deleted the topology file with backup creator , then i burned the game with truncate... I have LT 3.0.. but the console said : Not supported disc... i tried to overburn the image , but it didn't worked..
 so what ?"
,samengo,2012-11-30T15:31Z,Is this an ISO. file or not?PLEASE answer quick! :D
,boneyjr,2012-11-30T17:09Z,Why is this torrent not showing up under the Xbox360 top 100?
,flatak,2012-11-30T20:27Z,"It does not work on my LT3.0 console, even with mp3 playback trick and installed game. Say: This disc is not supported :/"
,Acid6D94,2012-11-30T23:52Z,"Downloaded, ran through abgx, truncate burn, and it work perfect in my flashed LT 3.0 BenQ Xbox."
,wilA7X,2012-12-01T01:50Z,"if i play offline now and then i play online when the game is on sale, am i gonna be banned?? "
,wilA7X,2012-12-01T01:50Z,"if i play offline now and then i play online when the game is on sale, am i gonna be banned?"
,flatak,2012-12-01T02:36Z,When i ran it trough abx and did autofix level 3 and burn it again. It works. But suddenly unsupported disc pop up. But when you play mp3 hack it works!
,ryunax14,2012-12-01T02:42Z,Guys please upload jtag rip of far cry 3 please it would be nice thankyouu!
,DRUNKSOB,2012-12-02T10:33Z,wow 1407 seeders @17kbs wtf! oh well I have a derpy ass fiberoptic internet so I will seed @ 5meg for two weeks if I ever finish
,737842,2012-12-03T10:30Z,wilA7X - I have been playing every game that comes out 2 weeks to a month early since 2010... The only games Microsoft care about are there games (Halo series). You highly unlikely to get banned on a flashed Xbox anymore it seems like microsoft doesn't care at all.
