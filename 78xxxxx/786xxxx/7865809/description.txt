Reverend Glasseye And His Wooden Legs - Black River Falls (2001) 245kbps


Reverend Glasseye are American rock band, originally hailing from Denver and presently based in Austin. Reverend Glasseye has often been labeled dark salvation music; cautionary tales filled with American superstition and human frailty. Reverend Glasseye is the brainchild of Adam Glasseye (ex-member of Slim Cessna's Auto Club). His most consistent members have included drummer Timothy Maher (also of Slim Cessna's Auto Club), organist Piet Masone, bassist Paul Dilley (who later joined Beat Circus), and reedist Kevin Corzett.
 Their debut album, Black River Falls (released under the name of 'Reverend Glasseye And His Wooden Legs'), was warmly welcomed by press and radio alike, creating an international underground following.
 
Reverend Glasseye And His Wooden Legs are armed with traditional instruments that include clarinet, musette, flugal horn, banjino, dobro and qarqaba. 
With tracks like "50% Murder," "Blood O' Lambs," and "Carnival of Pills," the sound is in one word: macabre. 
These songs wouldn't make it to Billboard, but are suitable for a Hollywood Western. Fans are left with a whiskey-filled gut without ever taking a sip...
