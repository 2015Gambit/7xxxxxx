,macwun,2012-11-29T15:13Z,your rips are great but honestly not having 5.1 in this day and age is really outdated and I can't stand watching movies without DD/DTS. please get with the times YIFI. thanks

Thanks to the link to the BOZX rip. However, on his files the audio always clips on my system during the busier scenes. Any way you could please do some multi channel audio rips? 

You are the best though! Thanks for all your hard work. We really appreciate it!"
,alveolate,2012-11-30T01:20Z,"srsly, why are there self-righteous know-it-alls who think they can order the uploader to ""upgrade""? do you even know what the mission of the Y-team is? they want to provide very good quality VIDEO at LOW FILESIZES.

if you want to tout some ""day and age"" rubbish, why don't you start your own uploading team?

alternatively, you could stop being cheap with your DD/DTS/5.1 systems and buy the original Blu-Rays. who the hell buys a good system to play pirated stuff and then complains about the pirated stuff not having enough quality anyway."
,thereisnoother,2012-11-30T02:45Z,"Self righteous know it all? Are you serious dude?  I did not ""order"" an upgrade, I was making a polite request. Here is the end of my post again, since you seem to have missed it: ""You are the best though! Thanks for all your hard work. We really appreciate it! ""

I understand the point to keep files small, but if YIFY was able to include 5.1 audio, the larger file size would be well worth it from my perspective. Many others are watching these on 5.1 systems, and would agree with me. I see people asking YIFY if files are 5.1 all the time, so are they all self righteous know-it-alls just for asking??

At no point did I ""complain"" about anything, so it is unfortunate you took me the wrong way. I am just making a kind request, that would really make the experience better, and only if it is not a hassle.  

Either way, I support the cause and I am eternally grateful for the efforts of people who put so much work into giving all of us FREE movies to enjoy. I have told YIFY this many times on other Pirate Bay pages. And don't worry, I have done my share of distributing expensive software for free on a large scale, so I can personally relate with what team YIFY does and the risks that they take to help others like us. 

The YIFY files are excellent quality on a high end system - that's the only reason I bothered to comment in the first place. And I do end up buying movies if I like them, but like you and others, why pay for it if I don't have to ...especially if the quality is so excellent! Are torrents only for people who don't own surround sound systems? 
Give me a break..."
,leehwgoC,2012-11-30T05:44Z,"Thereisnoother, you just spent all that time writing paragraphs of irrelevant, tangential ""hur dur well this is what I want"" bullshit that completely fails to address the point alveolate already candidly pointed out to you.

Mult-channel audio would roughly triple the file-size.

Thus, it isn't going to happen with YIFY. 

Period, full stop.

If *YOU* want 1920*800 video-res and multi-channel audio, then this is what you need to do:

Download one of the full 4-5 gig Blu-Ray rips, and stop wasting time essentially asking YIFY to stop being YIFY.

You idiot."
