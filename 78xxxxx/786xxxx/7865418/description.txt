Book 1: There was something wicked about Beau that drew me to him. What was wrong with me? Why did I want to sin so badly

Ashton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent. Sawyer is perfect, a regular Prince Charming, but when he leaves town for the summer, itΓÇÖs his cousin Beau who catches AshtonΓÇÖs eye. Beau is the sexiest guy sheΓÇÖs ever seen, and even though heΓÇÖs dangerous, Ashton is drawn to him.

Beau loves his cousin like a brother, so the last thing he wants to do is make a move on SawyerΓÇÖs girl. Ashton is off-limits, absolutely. ThatΓÇÖs why he does his best to keep his distance, even though heΓÇÖs been in love with her forever. When Ashton wants to rekindle their childhood friendship in SawyerΓÇÖs absence, Beau knows he should say no.

Ashton and Beau donΓÇÖt want to hurt Sawyer. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the more intense their urges become. ItΓÇÖs getting way too hard to resist...
