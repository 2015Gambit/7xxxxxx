,Crusisx,2012-11-27T02:16Z,"@hackpsp7

Because the game is Halo Custom Edition, the halo 3 aspect is the halo 3 campaign style and main menu style you can add to your game if you want "

are the stages different or same ??
im concerned only with single player gaming"

Graphics are enhanced and all Halo 3 guns warthogs and such are in there Its more watered down because its running on a halo ce engine but hey can't go wrong there its pretty cool, as for single player its not laggy at all, anymore questions comment back or leave me an email @ crusisx@aol.com"
