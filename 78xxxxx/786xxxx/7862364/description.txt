Revised version of a short rpg I made using rpg maker vx ace. Scanned with kaspersky and is clean. This is purely for test reasons and not a serious game. I just wanted to make something for people to have some fun. 

Instructions:
Launch the exe file and wait for the data to decompress
Then just launch the game.exe file after the decompressing is done.
enjoy!
