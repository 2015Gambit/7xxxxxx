You can find it in a number of places - raindg, gamersgate, gamestop, desura and more - hopefully on steam soon too.

hope you enjoy the game, and we really hope to see you in future! Enjoy!"

,Power.D,2012-11-27T18:28Z,"Regardless of the awesomeness of the developers, do not use the launcher to start this game. It will patch and make you re-install the whole game again. Just use the cracked.exe. :D"
