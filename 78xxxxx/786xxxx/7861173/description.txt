Shashi is a middle-aged Maharashtrian housewife
who earns some money by making and selling     
sweet snacks. She is a dedicated homemaker who 
is taken for granted by her family. She is     
ridiculed for her poor English by her husband  
Satish and teenage daughter. Shashi is the     
object of potshots by Satish, who has little   
respect for her real talent and Sapna, her 7th 
grade daughter who is ashamed to even introduce
her mother to her school folks and teachers    
because her English is weak. However, her young
son Sagar loves her as she is.
