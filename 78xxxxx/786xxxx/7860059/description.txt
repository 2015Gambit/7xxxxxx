The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

Today on this live Sunday, November 25, 2012 edition, Alex Jones covers the stress points on society, with another Black Friday demonstrating how fragile order can be, and how quickly things would break down in the event of civil unrest. Meanwhile, Ron Paul has defended a growing secessionist sentiment sweeping across the country, even as the tyrannical feds clamp down with more drones, checkpoints and propaganda. Also, healthcare workers have been fired for refusing to take flu shots; Obama's latest secret directive on cybersecurity grants new police state powers over the Internet; and the hoax surrounding the official account of Bin Laden's death continues to unravel.
