,LemonJ-Lo,2012-11-26T18:11Z,"Thanks.  

A suggestion for your next multi-book post:  It is not necessary to create RAR files in order to post collections such as this, since most torrent creation tools allow you to create a torrent from the contents of a folder.  (In fact, it probably takes less work to do that than to make the RAR file and then create the torrent with that).

When you create a torrent from a folder, all the files are listed automatically by TPB when you click on the link next to ""Files"" above.  So you could have saved yourself all the work of typing and posting the list in your comments.

Posting as a folder also allows leechers to select individual files if they wish.  I already have many of the books you have posted (as e-books or real books) so might not be interested in the whole thing.

Not posting a RAR file also allows people to verify that you are posting what you say you are, and not some malware.  (Not that you are - no one with evil intent would have spent so much time listing the torrent contents). "
,mindscrap,2012-11-26T19:11Z,"LemonJ-Lo

I thought about that, and you are correct it does let people select certain files, though this creates incomplete torrents and as such eventually might create missing files when there isnt anyone with all the files. "
,hulivar,2012-11-26T19:29Z,i stayed at 0.1 percent for 30 minutes...
,mindscrap,2012-11-26T19:58Z,Unless you have a recommendation on how to upload only a single torrent there is not much I can do...
,sistromo,2012-11-26T22:37Z,Anybody been able to download this? I remain stuck at 0%.
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-11-28T03:03Z,"It is coming across very, very slowly.  I am now at 33.3%, BitTorrent shows 298 seeders / 650 leechers, but that can't be right - most of them are through DHT or Peer Exchange, which is often bogus.  The actual trackers only show 2 - 4 seeders.

The peer I am connected to that has the highest is at 33.6%; cannot connect to any of the DHT ""seeds"", so I am assuming they don't exist."
