But a crucial error threatens to derail the promise of a new career. Having passed his final test Reynir finds himself on the road with six-year paramedic, Mel. It's a Saturday night, the full moon is out and a drug overdose is Reynir's first official job as a paramedic. It's an unpredictable and potentially explosive situation for the fresh-faced recruit.

Despite the best training possible, nothing can prepare them for the unforeseeable circumstances that confront them on a daily basis. As for young Blake, he manages to scrape through his final test at College but his real test now awaits him. Life on the road as a paramedic.
