Marvin the Martian is a character from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons.
Marvin hails from the planet Mars, but is often found elsewhere. He is often accompanied
by his dog 'K-9', and sometimes by other creatures (one gag, first used in 'Hare-Way to
the Stars (1957)', being candy-sized 'Instant Martians' that become full-size on
addition of drops of water).
