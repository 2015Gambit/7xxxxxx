Every now and then when downloading a title from you, after I change the format in Calibre and upload to my ereader it says it cannot open title.  Ive noticed the ones that do it always have this (%282013%29_%28digital-TheGroup%29.cbr) in the title.  Can you or anyone tell me what this is and how I might work around it?  And as always thanks for your uploads :)	"
