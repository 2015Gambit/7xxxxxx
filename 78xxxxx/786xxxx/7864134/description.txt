Settle down to a fireside chat with Terence about the way things are going, or were going in 1996. You'll be amazed at his foresight and of course his delivery is as sharp as it ever was. In this episode we get a guest appearance by brother Dennis who heard some of this particular rant on the Costa Del Sol back in 2004.
