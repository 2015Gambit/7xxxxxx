Title: Living Things (SPEC DTS 5.1 CD by DKA) (SBU)

This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from the 24-bit stereo source utilizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal. Otherwise, you will hear static.

Notes and disclaimers:
It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.

If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.

Latest from a band I actually feel is quite underrated. This underwhelmed me during the first few listens but has really grown on me since. Separates a lot better than their other albums through SPEC as well, which was a nice surprise.
