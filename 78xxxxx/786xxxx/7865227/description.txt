Release Info:

Far Cry 3 players step into the shoes of Jason Brody, a man alone at the
edge of the world, stranded on a mysterious tropical island cut off from
civilization.  In this savage paradise where lawlessness and violence are
the only sure thing, players will dictate when, where and how the events of
the game unfold.  Players will slash, sneak, detonate and shoot their way
across the island in a world that has lost all sense of right and wrong.
