There was a gitch at the beginning of track 13.  Fixed now.


A classic.  You cannot like techno and not have this CD.  It's also no longer in print, and the only torrent I could find was dead.  Please seed.

I'm not a fan of every track, such as the tribal stuff in the beginnng.  I'll skip to track 3, have a smoke and bliss out.  For the love of god, seed.

The last few tracks are also some of the most epic of all time.  They just don't make techno like this anymore.

Pretty soon i'm not even going to have a computer.  I'm giving this a shot in hope that other people can start seeding.  Don't let this classic die.
