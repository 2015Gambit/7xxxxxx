,MrJumper,2012-11-28T16:57Z,OK I don't wanna insult someone with a skull but how in the hell is just one episode over 2 gigs.....A little confused here.
,MrJumper,2012-11-28T17:01Z,"I'm sorry if that last comment came off ""rude"" but I usually look for the eztv stamp, and I don't recall ever seeing a single episode that big, in my experience, a single episode of a show is usually no more than 200-700 mb at most, can some one explain for me plz, to help me avoid future confusion....."
,Phuxu,2012-11-28T17:22Z,"It's 2.32GiB because it's a 90-minute episode in 720p HDTV. Go figure, son."
,k9nk9n,2012-11-29T17:38Z,"THX SO MUCH FOR UPPLOAD!!!

BUT ITÂ´S NOT A 90MIN EPISODE, ONLY 60 MIN.
