DJ Dan returns with his new album Disko-Funk Odyssey A superb blend of disco, house and techno from an American dance music master DJ Dan DIsko-Funk Odyssey October 22, 2012 I encourage more dancing and less fist pumping! DJ Dan, 2012 Were taking things back in timeto a place when the DJ played a set of tracks that nobody had heard of before and the fans absolutely loved it. Before there were DJ sets filled with the sing-a-long tracks that you already heard a hundred times before, DJs took their fans on a journey. A master of ceremonies playing the sickest mix that got the party movinga proper education.
