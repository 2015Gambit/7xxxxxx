The most nostalgic and reflective of Evelyn Waugh's novels, "Brideshead Revisited" looks back to the golden age before the Second World War. It tells the story of Charles Ryder's infatuation with the Marchmains and the rapidly-disappearing world of privilege they inhabit. Enchanted first by Sebastian at Oxford, then by his doomed Catholic family, in particular his remote sister, Julia, Charles comes finally to recognize only his spiritual and social distance from them.

About the Author
Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966) was born into a publishing family in Hampstead, England, and educated at Oxford. After a brief stint as a schoolmaster, he turned to writing. His biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti appeared in 1928, but it was his sensational first novel, Decline and Fall, published the same year, that set the course for his career. Waugh wrote sixteen novels, including The Loved One, Scoop, and Brideshead Revisited.
