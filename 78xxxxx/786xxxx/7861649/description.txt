From Wiki:

"The Muppet Show is an American-British television variety show produced by puppeteer Jim Henson and featuring the Muppets. After two pilot episodes produced in 1974 and 1975 failed to get the attention of America's network heads, the UK-produced show premiered on September 13, 1976,[1] and five seasons were produced until March 15, 1981, lasting 120 episodes. The series shows a vaudeville or music hall-style song-and-dance variety show, as well as glimpses behind the scenes of such a show. Kermit the Frog stars as a showrunner who tries to keep control of the antics of the other Muppet characters (and his temper), as well as keep the guest stars happy. The show was known for outrageous physical slapstick, sometimes absurdist comedy, and humorous parodies.[2] Each episode also featured a human guest star. As the show's popularity rose, many celebrities were eager to perform with the Muppets on television and in film."
