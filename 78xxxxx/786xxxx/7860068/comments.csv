,sad-sam,2012-11-26T04:49Z,"so the prison actually doesn't get overrun this week, and redneck cyborg is finally united with his brother, although on opposite sides of the battlefield.  How tragic.  It's nice to see a little more action in this episode, and I don't think it matters one bit that the governor gets eaten in the final scene.  He was a boring go-nowhere character anyway.  I'm tired of him boring the shit out of me every episode.  

SPOILER ALERT:
I don't know why they can't just clear the zombies out of the prison finally, but it's bizarre how they keep finding more survivors there.."
,TheDank,2012-11-26T04:57Z,done. will seed at 2MB/s for 24 hours. sharing is caring :)
,aj47951,2012-11-26T05:00Z,Seed plz   Downloading at 45kbs and uploading at 956kbs :( Seed Guys
,Micke7406,2012-11-26T05:01Z,Seed assholes
,JamesDuke,2012-11-26T05:09Z,"Naturally you're going to have a lot more leechers than seeders this early on because you seed after the download is complete. The more people finish, the more people seed. Thanks again ettv! I know I can always count on your ups!"
,2230cs,2012-11-26T05:12Z,please seed whilst enjoying film

,jeradwtf,2012-11-26T05:13Z,downloading so slow.... I was one of the first downloaders and I still have 25 minutes left
,Dennis19,2012-11-26T05:17Z,Please seed. I'm downloading 1.2kbps...

,dehaj2425,2012-11-26T05:22Z,"Well, Dexter is cooking for me now, looks like I'll be watching The Walking Dead tomorrow night.  "
,dehaj2425,2012-11-26T05:29Z,"PS: I love the morons bitching about Seeders after the first 30 minutes and about their ""slow"" 45kB/s dl speed. I'd be more than pleased with 45kB/s, however so slow that nothing even shows up, that's a joke."
,road-killer,2012-11-26T06:00Z,thanks for sharing this
,rockodss,2012-11-26T06:06Z,I don't get why people are not getting download speed? wtf are you doing? buy better internet or learn to use a PC geez. I always get 1mb/s + on every single torrent I download.... even if its new.
,baba1089,2012-11-26T06:10Z,Why is this pasword protected and why do I have to pay for a stupid survey to get the password?
,weeler,2012-11-26T06:11Z,"any english subtitles, anyone?"
,HKCannibal,2012-11-26T06:13Z,"Guys, wait no use wanting everyone to download at the same time, the amount of seeders does not support the amount of seeders, a simple analogy, if a crowd is cono wanted to go through a small door, will not pass anyone in this case is the same thing, anyone can download why speed is extremely low, wait a few hours, and download speeds of your internet maximums."
,puntoexe,2012-11-26T06:13Z,"This is the real chapter download safe, no fake. Thx ettv!"

,mamalushen,2012-11-26T06:56Z,Do not look at comments page 1.  Some ASSHOLE is putting spoilers without a spoiler warning.
,bvorak,2012-11-26T06:58Z,"The only problems I ever had with a new torrent was b/c of my internet. For some reason, one time utorrent would never connect to the trackers. After trying a shitload of things, it dawned on me one of the most obvious: RESET YOUR MODEM.

Anyways, thanks!"

i think it real, they bend the barrel rather than remove the firing mechanism to decommission the gun. 
bit needy but there go.
top show with a british lead actor "

,whitedog6delta,2012-12-01T07:59Z,"hippiekiller1997

the main method of disabling a military carbine is either to remove the firing pin and trigger housing, or to file down the star chamber so that the bolt cannot physically extract a live round from the magazine.

At least that's how NATO does it, and they control the world so that's all you need to worry about."
