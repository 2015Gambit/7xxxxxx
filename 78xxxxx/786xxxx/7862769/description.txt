Concepts of Genetics is a one semester introductory genetics text that explains genetics concepts in a concise, engaging and up to date manner. Rob Brooker, author of market leading texts in Genetics and Intro Biology for majors, brings his clear and accessible writing style to this new text. He employs the use of experimentation and stresses the fundamentals of the Scientific Method in presenting genetics concepts, then further engages the reader through the use of formative assessment to assist the student in understanding the core genetic principles.

The integration of the genetics text and the power of digital world are now complete with McGraw-Hill's ConnectPlus. Users who purchase Connect Plus receive access to the full online ebook version of the textbook.

This is NOT Concepts of Genetics by William S. Klug that also appears on this site. This is the much less popular Concepts of Genetics by Robert Brooker than only my school seems to require for genetics. I found this textbook freely available online in the dark recesses of the internet and thought it best be posted here where it can live on before it gets taken down elsewhere.
