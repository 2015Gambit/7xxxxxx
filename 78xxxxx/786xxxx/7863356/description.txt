Well from the waist down, 
You don't turn around
Your body takes turns, 
Like the words, like the words, 
That are falling from my mouth, 
My jaw dropped down
My mind starts spinning, 
Starts spinning around all over again

I'd let you go, go do whatever, ever I
Hold you close, but your heart says no

This feels like high school, but nothings new, 
Every other boy tries talking to you
I guess graduating changes nothing at all
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/the_friday_night_boys/high_school.html ]
Well from the neck up, 
there's not much to say
I know I could do better, 
Could do better anyway
But I'm waking up, 
Here next to you
I'll be thinking to myself what the hell did I do

I'd let you go, go do whatever, ever I
Hold you close, but your heart says no

This feels like high school, but nothings new, 
Every other boy tries talking to you
I guess graduating changes nothing at all

So high school, all over again, 
Girls trick boys into thinking they like them
I guess graduating changes nothing at all

I got over you at last, but baby, I get the last laugh
Where you going, where you going? 
No one cares to know
