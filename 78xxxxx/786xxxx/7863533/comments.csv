It is disheartening to see that of the 6 downloads to be completed so far (as shown bt the trackers), only 1 is still seeding. I observed that the others didn't stick around very long at all. So far I have uploaded 3x the data of this torrent, and with 23 others downloading, if the early adopters don't stick around, then the others will be left out, because I have other stuff to upload. My ISP throttles heavily, I need others to help out to keep these more obscure torrents alive."
