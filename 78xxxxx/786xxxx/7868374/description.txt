Description:
Eyewitness To Jesus (2011):
A fragment of papyrus that has recently been re-discovered could be the link that can date the Gospel of Matthew all the way back to a time contemporary to the life of Jesus. The Gospel of Matthew may have been written by someone who actually witnessed events in the life of Jesus, a possible eyewitness to the last supper and perhaps even the crucifixion. In this fascinating documentary, Matthew D'Ancona of Magdalen College in Oxford travels from Egypt to the Holy Land in pursuit  of the evidence that can prove that this papyrus was written during the life and times of Jesus.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.
