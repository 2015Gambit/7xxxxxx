Attempted a rear shot from set #246. 

Was going OK, but that fishnet really is annoying so kinda gave up on this image.
This was my progress before moving on.

Probably be last of these I upload to this site.

May upload some to Bayimg and just put the links in the comments of this one, we'll see.
