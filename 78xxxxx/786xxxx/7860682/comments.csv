I only started uploading torrents today so I want your feedback (good or bad).
If you like, keep a lookout for my name in the future.

The old BitComet crap that you created this torrent with has been obsolete for years."

I've been downloading torrents for around 7 years so I am not new to the scene. I only decided to start uploading recently however to give back something to the community rather than leaching (dare I say it)! 
Over this period I started off using BitComet because I liked the emule plugin and used BitComet for maybe the first 5 years. 
Then I decided to check out BitTorrent and uTorrent and switched to using uTorrent for the last couple of years or so. 
However I found out that BitComet had launched a 64Bit version, whereas uTorrnt still only has a 32Bit platform. 
This was literally 2-3 weeks ago, and since I started re-using BitComet I found that my download speeds had greatly increased compared to the d/l speeds I got from uTorrent.
I understand that uTorrent is now by far the most popular and widespread used client but I will continue using what works for me the best at this present time.
Regarding your comments that BitComet is old hat, and hence you are finding my upload speeds slow, I would like to point out that this is the fault of my ISP and not torrent client software. 
I use the number 1 ISP cable DSL broadband supplier in  my country and for some strange reason they really throttle the upload speed. If I run any number of speed tests my download speed is typically 16Mb, whereas the upload speed peaks out at around 150Kb (barely enough to make an IP telephone call). Strange as a few years ago my DSL speed would be say 4Mb down and 512Kb up. 
That's my response. Hope it makes sense.
Cheers
