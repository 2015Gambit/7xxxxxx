As fascinating as a real visit to the world's famous museums and architectural sites, GARDNER'S ART THROUGH THE AGES: NON-WESTERN PERSPECTIVES gives you a comprehensive, beautifully illustrated tour of the world's great non-Western artistic traditions--plus all the study tools you need to excel in your art history course! A unique "scale" feature (accompanying the book's photographs of paintings and other artworks) will help you better visualize the actual size of the artworks shown in the book. You'll also find materials that will help you master the key topics quickly and help you study for your exams--for example, "The Big Picture" overviews at the end of every chapter, a special global timeline, and ArtStudy Online (a free interactive study guide that includes flash cards of images and quizzes).
