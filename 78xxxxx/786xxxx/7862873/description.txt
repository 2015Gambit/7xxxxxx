The music band "Asíkides" was formed on 2007 by Yannis Papaioannou, a greek oud player- multinstrumentalist settled since 2004 in Barcelona, as a music band of Greek traditional music.
The intercultural environment of this city as well as Yannis’ creative concerns gave a more personal tone to their repertoire.
On 2009 he started colaborating with Tal Ben Ari, an excellent and very promising Yemeni origin Israeli singer. Tal Ben Ari apart from her magnificent voice and presence brought also her songs that together with Yannis’ compositions formed the repertoire of the new album ("Hesperia") released on January 2011.
In this cd we can also listen to the great armenian musician Haig Yazdjián and the trumpetist of "Ojos de Brujo", Carlos Sarduy.
"Asíkides & Tal Ben Ari" have given many concerts around Spain and have also performed in Italy, France and Greece.
On March 2010 they colaborated with the great turkish musician Omar Faruk Tekbilek and on december 2011 they perfomed in the legendary jazz club of Paris, "New Morning"
