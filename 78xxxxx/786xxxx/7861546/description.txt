Operation Repo S10E21 First Class Clown (Aired Nov. 7th 2012)

Description (from iTunes): Matt and Froy are sent on a wild goose chase around LA for a mini-van, and when they find their debtor selling contraband out of the trunk, Matt is further convinced that Lyndah has been scheming against him. Sonia and Carlos repo a car from an airline pilot who is a little too tipsy to drive, let alone fly. And Lou and Sonia go after a sewage truck in a repo that stinks to high heavens.

Notes:

* I only post episodes for South Beach Tow and Operation Repo when xgimpyx is unable to. He's always done a great job at keeping us up to date on these shows, and several others. The real credit goes to him! Also, both SBT and Op Repo are (in some areas) available on iTunes in High-Def for $2.99 USD. Something to keep in mind if another episode is missed, and you want it sooner. :)

* The first few seconds of the video are glitched (the fault of SoundTaxi), but doesn't affect the overall episode. For some reason it only occurred with two Operation Repo Episodes.
