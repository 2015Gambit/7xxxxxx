Operation Repo S10E23 Smut Campaign (Aired Nov 21st, 2012)

Description (from iTunes): After Ronnie suffers a near-fatal wound during an attack on the lot, he reconsiders his role in the repo business. Ronnie and Carlos try to wrestle a truck away from a storage locker auctioneer, Sonia and Ronnie try to outwit a fast-talking politician, and the repo team learns that everybody has something to hide. Will Lou be able to keep Ronnie from walking away, or will this be his final hour?

Notes:

* I only post episodes for South Beach Tow and Operation Repo when xgimpyx is unable to. He's always done a great job at keeping us up to date on these shows, and several others. The real credit goes to him! Also, both SBT and Op Repo are (in some areas) available on iTunes in High-Def for $2.99 USD. Something to keep in mind if another episode is missed, and you want it sooner. :)

* The first few seconds of the video are glitched (the fault of SoundTaxi), but doesn't affect the overall episode. For some reason it only occurred with Operation Repo Episodes.
