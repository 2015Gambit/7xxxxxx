,youcankillcandy,2012-11-28T19:15Z,@1nter1908 then u have done somthing wrong becuz my game runs fine
,luky554,2012-11-28T19:16Z,i did delete all russian files ...game menu is still russian ..when i apply 3dm crack i cant hear voices again ... wtf
,Tang76,2012-11-28T19:18Z,My game did crash not far into it.  That could be my fault though from replacing and adding more files from another torrent.  I will say again though that this does work for English in game.
,1nter1908,2012-11-28T19:32Z,ok thanks works great for me now. follow youcankillcandy  instructions to change the menu to english. very easy to do thanks again
,gravexxi,2012-11-28T19:52Z,Is there a way to replace only sound without interface and subs?
,DoodleBop,2012-11-28T19:57Z,"The game doesn't launch at all ... it says ""LOADING"" then stays like that .. it seems like it freez, but i can still hit escape and have the menu."
,CMS93,2012-11-28T20:01Z,"Crashes all the fucking time now, it works tho..
Am I the only one with the crashes? I have played quite a bit with the russian subs and without audio but there wasn't any crashes, once I've installed this I'm getting random crashes every few minutes."
,greyMotion,2012-11-28T20:09Z,"@CMS93:

The game did crash for me when I tried to continue playing the saved game I had with the russian audio. So I started a new game and am now 3 hours in without any problems so far.

This is not by any means a solution. But it's at least something.."
,XmarcX92,2012-11-28T20:14Z,STILL NO AUDIO!!
,XmarcX92,2012-11-28T20:26Z,Thanks now my game is crashing!!!!
,CMS93,2012-11-28T20:48Z,"@greyMotion

I've started a new game but got crashes as well, guess I should reinstall."
,TheDeviantBlackbeard,2012-11-28T20:53Z,"Okay... This is frustrating. These random crashes are killing me. I also started a new Game, reinstalled... nothing. Keeps crashing and crashing."
,TheDeviantBlackbeard,2012-11-28T21:05Z,Reinstall doesnÂ´t work at all... -.- 
,Tang76,2012-11-28T21:24Z,"People that are getting the crashes.  What are you running the graphics on?  I changed to dx9 and so far no issues.  Even if you click the dx9 icon to play, make sure it's changed in video settings also.  Not sure if that's the problem but so far, so good."
,dellamorte666,2012-11-28T21:25Z,Game works perfect now! Thanks
,krispo.R,2012-11-28T21:37Z,"It works for me, but i only have 30 fps on ultra. If i change back to the russian version i have 80-100 fps.. whats up with that? :( Thanks for torrent anyways!"
,tornadotitan,2012-11-28T21:48Z,"Here how to get everything working (at least for me)
1. Copy downloaded files to Far Cry 3 Directory
2. Delete all the files that have Russian in there names.
3.Open run then type ""regedit"", once there go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Wow6432Node > Ubisaoft > Far Cry 3.
4. Change Language to English and SKU to ENG.
5. Safe Changes and start game.
6. Make sure in game options are all set to English, Should work fine now.
P.S. I started a new game to get the full experience so idk if it will crash when loading an old save, I wouldn't imageine it would, but you never know."
,greyMotion,2012-11-28T22:00Z,"I'm sad to hear about those who get random crashes, yet so you know I am running the game on medium dx9(win7 64bit, laptop). So you might look into the idea that the graphics option might hold you back. Hope this helps!

P.S. How easy is it to get side tracked in this game!? I'm not usually an achievement whore but I've spent more than half of the time doing side missions since I've started playing.. Love this fricking game! :D"
,123das123,2012-11-28T22:21Z,@tornadotitan  Thanks man! I'm not kidding this actually works!!!!!!!
,Tang76,2012-11-28T22:29Z,"Grey, thank you again for giving us these files.  Just curious as to which version of this game you have and is it on TPB?  I have a bunch of files that I got from another torrent, and also the steam006 torrent.  From the looks of it, the steam006 is missing more than just the few files you UL'ed, which could be why people are getting crashes.  ( I think it's the dx11 which is causing it myself.)"
,gir48922,2012-11-28T22:54Z,"Wow thanks. Before characters wouldn't speak, now the game doesn't load at all! Fucking nigger."
,hamza321,2012-11-28T23:00Z,I have windows 8 x64 pro.When i start the game it says loading and after loading black screen appears and nothing happens.I deleted all the russian files and added the english files and change language at regedit.After loading black screen appears and nothing happens.Please somebody help me if he has the same issue and he fixed it.I am waiting for 2 years to play this game.
,jesuz999,2012-11-28T23:14Z,"When I start the game, loading screen (with changing words) pops out and after a short while screen goes black and that is it. Any ideas why?"
,jesuz999,2012-11-29T00:08Z,"@hamza321
Do you have AMD GPU and running on Catalyst 12.11 beta?"
,Tang76,2012-11-29T00:18Z,"Wow gir48922, that's quite rude of you.  Grey tried to help us by UL'ing his files and I'd say for most of us they worked.  Did you follow instructions as given?  Delete the Russian sound files?  If so and no worky still I don't know what to tell you.  Wait for a better release or keep trying."
,Tang76,2012-11-29T00:22Z,"You people with the black screen.  Is something popping up in the background maybe?  I think the first time I had the same thing like it wasn't running in full screen mode and I could see the far cry 3 icon on my task bar.  Try alt+tabbing or something.. Just trying to help, not sure what is going on for you all with black screen."
,greyMotion,2012-11-29T02:03Z,"@Tang:
Thank you for your kind words and support, man. I have the Steam0006 version of the game and got the sound files from a Skidrow version I found.

There's also a Reloaded version available now, but I'll keep seeding for a short while for those who don't want to download the full game all over again.

For me the game still runs perfectly fine after nine hours, except for one time when I got the blue screen of death, but that mostly depends on the fact that I'm playing on my weaker laptop and not my pc(I'm not at home at the moment).

Right now I'm at the point of the game when you meet Citra and the game just keeps getting better! :D"
,CMS93,2012-11-29T02:19Z,Apparently switching to DX9 fixed the crashes. A bummer because it looked so damned nice on DX11.
,jesuz999,2012-11-29T03:23Z,"So the Black Screen after Loading is somehow related to Uplay crack.
