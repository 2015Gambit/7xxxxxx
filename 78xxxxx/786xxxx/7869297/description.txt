Towns brings a fresh new take on the citybuilding/management genre by introducing many RPG features.
 
Drawing inspiration from games such as Diablo, Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress, the game has you managing a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?
 
Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.
 
Craft unique weapons, obtain randomized loot and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!

If you have trouble un-archiving try using stuffit expander its free and works better than the build in mac one!
