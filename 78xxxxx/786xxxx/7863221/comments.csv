Thank you.
Question - what program does encode video?

I like to use VirtualDub for avi encoding. To open MKV or MP4 in VirtualDub, you will need the Directshow Driver Plugin. The summary of the settings I use is up in the description under ""Method used"". I need to add to it though to make it more complete.

Let me know if you have any questions about how exactly to do it. :)"
