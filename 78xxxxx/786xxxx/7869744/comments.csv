It seems to work properly but when the first cinematic shows up it freezes. The only way to proceed is by skipping it by a double-click. Then again - everything seems to work, I can create a character and so on but when the actual game is supposed to start it crashes to desktop. I tried reinstalling the game and even downloaded it from a different torrent but every time I have exactly the same problem. 

Please, help me. I've been waiting for this game for months."
