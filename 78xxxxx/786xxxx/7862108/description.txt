"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"

Jane disappears without a trace, forcing a 
despondent Henry to worry for her safety and 
sanity. When she suddenly pops up in the middle 
of Times Square dazed and confused and is taken 
to a hospital for observation, Jane discovers 
that a horrible fate may be waiting for her 
there. Meanwhile, Gavin has Victor Shaw held 
captive in The Drake's boiler room with 
Kandinsky torturing him to give up the location 
of the red box. Shaw, however, shockingly 
reveals to Gavin his knowledge of what really 
happened to his daughter, Sasha, and threatens 
to tell Olivia. Finally, to Brian's dismay, he 
discovers that unless he is with Alexis, his 
creativity vanishes.
