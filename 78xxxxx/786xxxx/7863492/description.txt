Sorry this took so long to get up, I was editing it in Sony Vegas and the capture card I use doesn't output squeaky clean files - after a several hour render last night it spit out a file with only half an audio track. Used a different software this time, came out clean. Also the quality is a bit lower than I'd like, not sure if it's the codec, probably the rain causing too many changes on screen. In the future I'll use a higher bitrate for races with a lot of rain.
