Fascinating set of very early promo films made by the Floyd for Belgian TV in 1968, a few days after SydΓÇÖs departure from the band.
The music for these tracks is the official studio versions so it is a little odd hearing Syd sing on some of tracks when heΓÇÖs not actually there but this is very much a document of its time and the promo films themselves are very trippy. However, the definite highlight  is the live ΓÇ£Astronomy DomineΓÇ¥ from a Belgian Festival held in the Summer of 1968 which closes the DVD. Great performance and a rare and very early look at Pink Floyd live
