[V],WTC-SWE,2012-11-28T00:41Z,"It's the ""complete"" season 4 (10 episodes) It was suppose to be 12,but for some weird reason the last two episodes were never broadcasted.Not sure if they were canceled or moved to season 5.

Aborted/canceled/moved :

11) Secrets of the Pyramids
12) Aliens and Cover-Ups


I've waited until the DVD Release (Date: November 20, 2012) was out,just to verify if thoose were included or not.To my disappointment they weren't.As you can see bellow,the discs from different sites have only 10 episodes.

DISC 1: The Mayan Conspiracy / The Doomsday Prophecies / The Greys / Aliens and Mega-Disasters

DISC 2: The NASA Connection / The Mystery of Puma Punku / Aliens and Bigfoot / The Da Vinci Conspiracy

DISC 3: The Time Travelers / Aliens and Dinosaurs


Anyways,i guess ten episodes are better than nothing.I added external english subtitles for thoose of you that wants them.It's a very interesting series that will keep you busy for sure.Enjoy and help seed people,thank you.

,mtracker_2009,2012-12-01T19:35Z,great upload. but is it just me or does it seem like this season is old material? it's as if they took the discarded footage from past seasons and edited it together to form season 4. I say this because all of these topics have been covered by Ancient Aliens. 
,programmm,2012-12-02T12:48Z,Seed ffs. So new upload and so slow speed. Anywhere to watch episode 11 and 12?
