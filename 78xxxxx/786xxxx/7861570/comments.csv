,dlawhorn77,2012-11-30T21:12Z,"anyone know the name of this episode because i thought it was (first class clown) and ep21 was (revenge gone wrong). I have been going in the name order on http://www.trutv.com/shows/operation_repo/index.html#hpt=nav_shows2 
so if thats wrong then trutv is missed naming ep20 if twijjit is correct with the naming of ep 21 and 22 then something went wrong with the naming.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"
,twijjit,2012-11-30T23:44Z,"There are some long-standing issues with episode numbers between TruTV, Wikipedia, and other sites that list episode numbers - I dont put too much faith in them, as long as the titles are correct. As for the ones I've uploaded, the titles themselves are correct, as they were taken straight from iTunes (and they matched the content of the episode itself, i.e., this episode did in fact have to do with 'revenge')

I watch the show regularly, and have not noticed any gaps between episodes from missing torrents, except for the one that aired this past Wednesday, which isn't available on iTunes yet, and no one else has upload. :/"
