Operation Repo S10E22 Revenge Gone Wrong (Aired Nov 14th, 2012)

Description (from iTunes): When Matt almost gets run down by a posse of graffiti-packing gangsters, he sets into motion a plan of revenge against Lyndah. Ronnie and Carlos use their powers to tame a wild woodoo priest, and Lou and Froy are held hostage in a violent robbery, but things go from bad to worse when the cops arrive. Later, when Matt's plan takes a violent turn, will the consequences be worse than he ever imagined?

Notes:

* I only post episodes for South Beach Tow and Operation Repo when xgimpyx is unable to. He's always done a great job at keeping us up to date on these shows, and several others. The real credit goes to him! Also, both SBT and Op Repo are (in some areas) available on iTunes in High-Def for $2.99 USD. Something to keep in mind if another episode is missed, and you want it sooner. :)

* The first few seconds of the video are glitched (the fault of SoundTaxi), but doesn't affect the overall episode. For some reason it only occurred with two Operation Repo Episodes.
