Kanhaiyalal plays a poor farmer living with his wife and two half brothers (played by Sanjeev Kumar and Jeetendra). Sanjeev Kumar studies law supported by his brothers while Jeetendra helps Kanhaiyalal in cultivating the piece of land they own. Kanhaiyalal loans some amount from local moneylender against this piece of land for Sanjeev Kumar's law studies. Jeetendra is also in love with this moneylender's daughter, played by Nanda. With the passage of time, industrialisation and circumstances compel the brothers to disperse. Married Sanjeev Kumar, after learning about the amount loaned by his brother, leaves his modern wife, brothers and decides to come back only after he has sufficient amount to repay the loan. On the other hand, Jeetendra moves to the city as a driver to earn livelihood. How the family values, proper education, righteousness and eternal bond between the brothers help them getting together forms the rest of the story.
