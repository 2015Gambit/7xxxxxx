This will become an unofficial mirror to Microsoft's DirectX SDK for April 2007. Eventually, Microsoft will remove and phase out this package, and we need an archive somewhere.

There are some old programs that will still require DirectMusic, and I don't know how long those programs will last.

The Pirate Bay is the place to put up a mirror ideally. No fuss, no hassle, and it's easy to upload/create a mirror/backup. I'm happy with it as it is.

If anyone is willingly to put this somewhere safe and in a place where people can still obtain this SDK package, please, by all means, go ahead!

Leave any comments below. Feedback is appreciated.

Enjoy! :D

There's no Bayimg image tag for this.
