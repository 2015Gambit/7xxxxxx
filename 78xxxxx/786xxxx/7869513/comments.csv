,DAlignment,2012-11-29T04:32Z,Utorrent gave me a warning before opening the file and Zonealarm alerted me to suspicious behavour when I clicked the Setup File. I think this is a fake.

Get Sandboxie at http://www.sandboxie.com/index.php?DownloadSandboxie

Believe me this is the way to test out keygens, and new untrusted installs. It will keep those files out of your system."
