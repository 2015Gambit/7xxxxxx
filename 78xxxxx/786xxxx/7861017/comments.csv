Beside this, the game is so dumb! One hour watching endless scenes where one guy is talking and talking and talking!
Then, we`re ready to kill! Yeah, wild pigs and goats and rabid dogs.Eventually collect some flowers and buy guns from vending machine.
What the hell is wrong with this garbage called ""games"" invading the market nowadays? 
I was planning to buy it - PC version  as a present for somebody , after i tested i changed my mind. It`s a piece of crap, installing hundred of megs into your system. Framework? No way dude! Delete , delete!
Thanks for the effort to upload this piece of crap!"
