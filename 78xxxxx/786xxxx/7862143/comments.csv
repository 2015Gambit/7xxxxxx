,BearTrapHarold,2012-11-26T22:01Z,is there a difference between these and the 1-10 that are on here already?
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-26T22:44Z,"I didn't download dbranson17's torrent, but I do have the scans from mirrormaster82's torrent - https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6895319/BATMAN_AND_SUPERMAN_-_WORLDS_FINEST.  The scans from dbranson17's torrent are about the same sizes as the ones from mirrormaster82's torrent, so they may be the same scans.

The Batman and Superman: World's Finest scans that mirrormaster82 uploaded were scanned in 2003 and are 1000 pixels in width at 150 ppi (pixels per inch), while these are 1440 pixels in width at 400 ppi.  The more pixels per inch, the sharper the image.

The scans that mirrormaster uploaded are good, but if you have a high resolution screen and especially if you read on a newer high resolution tablet like the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" (1920x1200), Nook Tablet HD+ 9"" (1920x1280), Nexus 10 (2560x1600), or Apple iPad (3rd and 4th generation) (2048x1536), the new scans will look much nicer."
