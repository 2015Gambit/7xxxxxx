From Damaged Goods Records:

"Often associated with such fierce and striking artists as Karen O, Siouxsie Sioux, and Chrissie Hynde, Roxy Epoxy made a lasting impact on the punk and indie community in her former band, The Epoxies. Now, freshly rejuvenated and ready to tackle the music industry with both fists and a great set of pipes, Roxy embarks on the next chapter of her musical career with her newly-minted band Roxy Epoxy And The Rebound. Their new album Band-Aids On Bullet Holes gets released on March 10, 2009 via Metropolis Records. ΓÇ£I think The Rebound are a bit more introspective than The Epoxies,ΓÇ¥ explains Roxy. ΓÇ£The music is more intricate and is a bit more rock than pop. When the Epoxies broke up, I had a ton of material at different states of completion and finally had the time to dig into it. I had wanted to head in a slightly different direction for a while. This is the result.ΓÇ¥"
