To celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Rolling Stones we delve into the BBC
vaults to deliver some timeless Stones archive. From the early days of their
career and some unforgettable performances on Top of the Pops with 'The Last
Time', 'Let's Spend The Night Together' and 'Get Off Of My Cloud' through the
late 60s and early 70s era of prolific song writing when the band were knocking
out a classic album every other year and offering up such classics as 'Honky
Tonk Women' and 'Gimme Shelter'.

The late 70s brought a massively successful nod to disco with Miss You and the
early 80s a stomping return to form with the rock 'n' roll groove of Start Me Up.
Peppered amongst the performances are snippets of wisdom from the two main men
The Glimmer Twins, aka Mick and Keith. Plus as a special treat, some lost footage
of the band performing 19th Nervous Breakdown on Top of the Pops in 1966 recently
discovered in a BBC documentary from the 1960s about women with depression
