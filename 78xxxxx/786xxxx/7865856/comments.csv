,OmniNegro,2012-11-28T01:38Z,Note that this is a demo only. And fuck you LastEnd for the deception. I will gladly stop saying this on your torrents when you bother to mention this fact yourself rather than try to trick people into downloading your demo.
,3picL0lz,2012-11-28T02:28Z,OmniNegro is right. You guys need to label that this is a trial version and not the full thing.
,3picL0lz,2012-11-28T02:30Z,"Also, this goes under Applications > Windows, not Games."

,nignug,2012-11-28T04:28Z,^They all right. This is a trial and it is not even a game.
,IndigoAK,2012-11-28T05:53Z,"Not this again.  There's no need to label this because people should be able to use common sense.  This file is uploaded by a user called LastEnd, the name of the company that also makes this product.  It is reasonable to assume that they would not upload a pirated copy of their own software and therefore, it is further a reasonable assumption that this is not the full version of the software.  It's not their fault that people on this site expect everything on it to be cracked or otherwise illegal."
,opaleg,2012-11-28T06:40Z,"On one hand OmniNegro is right, as it is not labeled as a demo or trial/etc.

On the other hand IndigoAK is more right just on general principle beyond this torrent. Although I don't know how people would see the user name and instantly know what the company's name is."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-28T13:23Z,"I do not expect LastEnd to give away his products for free. But I hate deceptions. I never complained that he did not include a crack/keygen or anything like that. I just want some friendly ""Truth in Advertising"".

While not everything on TPB is stolen/pirateware, much of it is. And I for one refuse to ever install trials/demos. Too many times I have been burned by a trial that was infact destructive to my OS upon removal.

This product may not be one like that, but I still do not trust trials.

For what little it is worth, I apologize for incorrectly using the word ""demo"" when LastEnd had already corrected me that it was not a demo but rather a trial in the last version he posted here."
