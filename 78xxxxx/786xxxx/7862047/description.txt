"Turkey Pot Die"

Cleveland takes a reluctant Cleveland, Jr. to a 
turkey farm in order to teach him how to hunt the 
familys Thanksgiving dinner. But Junior refuses 
to harm the innocent turkeys. So when Cleveland is 
accidentally shot, he and Junior embark on an 
elaborate mission to free all of the turkeys 
before Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, Rallo and Donna 
build a float for Stoolbends Thanksgiving Day 
parade, but Rallo takes matters into his own hands 
when Donna fails to embrace his artistic vision.
