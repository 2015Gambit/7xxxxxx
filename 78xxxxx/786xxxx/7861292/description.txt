In the early days of the CD (1987 in this case), A series of compilations

was created under the truly inventive title COMPACT JAZZ

I've got three of these for the Oscar Peterson trio  (mostly VERVE family)





Tracks 1,3,5,7,9            OP trio with Herb Ellis playing guitar



Tracks 2,4,6,8              OP trio with Ed Thigpen playing drums


Selected and sequenced by James Isaacs in 1987





TRACK # 4 will amaze you even if you've already heard it....A 10 minute rendition of Benny Golson's I REMEMBER CLIFFORD which starts out slow and relaxed and builds to an unsustainable level.
