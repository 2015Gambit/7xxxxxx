Link to 1.04 update, but some of the comment says that's only in italian, or some virus, i don't know"
,Awoken_1,2012-11-28T16:09Z,"There is a Digital Deluxe Edition of Mass Effect 3 version 1.4 available here one tpb,was uploaded on november 7.You can download that and just add the dlc to the game folder-prior dlcs are all installed with the DDE."
,Militance,2012-11-28T16:13Z,Can some one just tell us if it works with game version 1.03??? please.
,DudeAxe,2012-11-28T16:21Z,"I have the retail version, and it's not working. The game is telling me I have to purchase the DLC to unlock it. What am I doing wrong?"
,nox234558,2012-11-28T16:26Z,great upload heromaster pls can u upload windows 8 untouched :DDD 
,Awoken_1,2012-11-28T16:29Z,@ DudeAxe dude download the DLC unlocker uploaded by RELOADED and try with that.
,Awoken_1,2012-11-28T16:43Z,And yes the new patch would be more preferable coz it fixes allot of issues in the game and all original game users have it preinstalled from Origin so you do the math.
,Santusak,2012-11-28T18:08Z,Just finished Omega and it works even without the 1.04 patch.
,Militance,2012-11-28T18:28Z,"ok thx Satusak, and thx hero fer this."
,Mimiux,2012-11-28T20:31Z,"I didnÂ´t need to upgrade to 1.04 patch( I was playing it on 1.03), the DLC works just fine without it (except for some minor bugs and glitches, nothing serious though) Thanks for great torrent n_n"
