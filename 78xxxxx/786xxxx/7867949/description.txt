             The New Normal | s01e09 | Unplugged | 720p WEB-DL


When technology begins to interrupt their lives Bryan, David, Goldie, and Shania reluctantly give up their various electronic devices for one day. Shania, however, takes it one step further by suggesting they give up all modern technology including heated toilet seats. Meanwhile, Rocky unleashes an online beast when she shows Jane how to use twitter. Hoping to gain more followers, Jane posts a private video from Bryan which was meant to surprise David on their future wedding day. Shocked at the invasion of privacy, Bryan is appalled until the cast of his show "Sing" tells him what they think of the tweet.
