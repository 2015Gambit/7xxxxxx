Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane

Crossfire Hurricane, directed by Brett Morgen, is released as part of the ongoing 50th anniversary
celebrations of The Rolling Stones. This superb new film tells the story of the Stones unparalleled
journey from blues obsessed teenagers in the early sixties to their undisputed status as rock
royalty. All of The Rolling Stones have been newly interviewed and their words form the narrative
arc that links together archive footage of performances, news coverage and interviews, much of it
previously unseen. Taking its title from a lyric in Jumpin Jack Flash , Crossfire Hurricane gives
the viewer an intimate insight into exactly what it s like to be part of The Rolling Stones as they
overcome denunciation, drugs, dissensions and death to become the definitive survivors. Over a year
in the making and produced with the full co-operation and involvement of The Rolling Stones,
Crossfire Hurricane is and will remain the definitive story of the world s greatest rock n roll band.
