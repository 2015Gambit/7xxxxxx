Watch the thing before rating it.
Video is subpar and look upscaled
Audio is a mess. Levels are WAY off and franklt awful."

,dt7ll5op,2012-11-16T11:21Z,BAD AUDIO QUALITY! distorsion at all louder parts plus default volume level is high - feels like audio is clipping http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_clipping
,ECCHiDUCKi,2012-11-17T04:52Z,"I notice there are black-bars somewhere after the beginning of the movie and later there is none. That I don't get or it was intentional.
and the Audio is a bit funny at some part.
