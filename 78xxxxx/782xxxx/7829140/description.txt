Taken spans five decades and four generations, and centers on three families: the Keys, the Crawfords, and the Clarkes. Nightmares of abduction by extraterrestrials during World War II haunt Russell Keys; the Roswell incident transforms Owen Crawford from ambitious Air Force captain to amoral shadow government conspirator; and an alien visitor impregnates an unhappily-married Sally Clarke. As the decades go by, the heirs of each are affected by the machinations of the aliens, culminating with the birth of Allie Keys, the final product of the aliens' experimentation and the key to their future.



1 Beyond the Sky
Capt. Russell Keys is in the midst of a dogfight over Germany during World War II when his plane becomes enveloped in a mysterious blue light, saving him and his crew of nine men from certain death. However, none of them have any real memory of what truly happened or how they survived. After the war, Russell tries to return to normal, only to be troubled by bizarre nightmares and headaches. He learns that every other crewmember on his mission has died mysteriously, and feels compelled to begin his own quest for answers. Meanwhile, the unscrupulous Capt. Owen Crawford uses anybody and any thing to be put in control of the crash alien ship. A mysterious stranger named John comes into the Clarke family life and leaves, just as Capt. Crawford suspects him from being escaped alien.
