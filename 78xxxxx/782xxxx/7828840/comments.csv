,melsen23,2012-11-20T15:26Z,"So I have multiple Sims 3 games on my computer, probably half of them are downloaded off the internet. I downloaded this torrent, everything worked fine. I was able to bypass the launch by changing my .info stuff inside the game files. But after I load the entire game, and I'm in the main menu, it tells me to ""Insert game disc to continue"" (or something close to that) But I obviously don't have the game disc. Someone help me bypass this message so I can play!! Thanks!"
,GreenEyedJax,2012-11-26T13:52Z,I am going to seed for the rest of my life. Thank you!
