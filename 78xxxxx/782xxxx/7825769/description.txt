America as we know itΓÇöwealthy, powerful, assertiveΓÇöis not what Obama wants. He wants a smaller America, a poorer America, an America unable to exert its will, an America happy to be one power among many, an America in decline so that other nations might riseΓÇöall in the name of global fairness. To Obama, the hated ΓÇ£one percentΓÇ¥ isnΓÇÖt just wealthy Americas; it is America itself. In ObamaΓÇÖs view, America needs to be taken down a notch.

That is the startling conclusion of bestselling author Dinesh DΓÇÖSouza in ObamaΓÇÖs America. Building on his previous New York Times bestseller The Roots of ObamaΓÇÖs RageΓÇöwhich Newt Gingrich called ΓÇ£StunningΓÇªthe most profound insight I have read in the last six yearsΓÇ¥ΓÇöDΓÇÖSouza shows how ObamaΓÇÖs goal to downsize America is in plain sight but ignored by everyone.

DΓÇÖSouza lays out what Obama plans to do in a second administrationΓÇöa makeover of America so drastic that the ΓÇ£shining city on a hillΓÇ¥ will become a shantytown in a rather dangerous global village. Arresting in its presentation and sobering in its conclusions, ObamaΓÇÖs America is essential reading for those who want to change AmericaΓÇÖs course before itΓÇÖs too late.
