,shamanist,2012-11-17T03:35Z,"You almost need a shovel to move all the crap here.  So we have D'Souza, once a promising conservative scholar (kind of) who had to leave a posh job as president of King's College because of an affair and has turned out a series of nutjob, fringe books. There is more truth in a copy of the Watchtower than in this book. 

@drdoodoo---might want to change that name to drdingdong or drhoho. Obama has done less damage to this country than eight years of HowdyDowdy as prez. And if you want to point a finger try aiming it at some of the real culprits, like the dems and republiscum who deregulate the banking industryand threw out Glass-Stiegl, and helped to give us the crash of 2007. Or you might want to get your head out of your arse and review the Howdy Dowdy years for 2 unfunded wars, welfare for the rich tax schemes and no-bid contracts for the DOD. Remember, when Howdy took office, he had a surplus and when he left (after instituting TARP and other bailouts), we were left $11 Trillion in debt. Hell, that welfare for the rich scheme adds about #384 Billion to the budget every stinking year the nutjobs prolong it. 

@dr(ug)doodoo, I would guess that you voted for the bishop in magic underwear and the buff guy who is clueless. Maybe you could get a job managing the Golden Shower Boys (Rove & Limbaugh)! But as a prophet and pundit, you are a waste of space..."
,RTT2,2012-11-17T11:56Z,"Well said, shamanist! I've also shovelled a fair bit of libertarian waste speech on a few torrents here, not that the tea party members are worried about their position in the republican party...

kudos for the apolitical stance on bank regulation as both dems and reps were involved (though of course the philosophy was libertarian). cf libertarians and conservatives who claim to be 'moderate'. There was a study done that analyzed this and they found that Right-wingers tended to describe themselves as 'moderate' or 'centrist' (even though they aren't), and left-wingers tended to think of themselves as more left-wing than they actually are. Something to think about in the 'polarization' debate...

The 'welfare for the rich' made me think of 2 things: Steinbeck's prescient analysis of ordinary Americans who consider themselves not poor, merely 'temporarily embarrassed millionaires', and a great line from Futurama, when Fry is supporting an ultra-Right-wing Nixon's head, who is proposing turning the poor into fish food (paraphrased):

""Leela: You're not rich, Fry!

Fry: Maybe not now, but  someday I will be, and when I do, people like me had better watch out!""
