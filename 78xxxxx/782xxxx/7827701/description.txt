The WWE franchise has become an annual event for wrestling enthusiasts around the world, providing fans of the sport a realistic take on the spectacle. WWE ΓÇÖ13 looks to take us back to the most influential time in the industry, with its new emphasis on the Attitude Era. Providing gamers with a great history lesson of the WWE and the Monday Night Wars, which occurred in the late 90ΓÇÖs. Giving fans the best looking WWE game yet, along with a plethora of customization options 13 had a chance to become the greatest wrestling game ever made. WWE ΓÇÖ13 provides a great experience and is a great dedication to the era that made wrestling what it is today, but lots technical issues and lack of emphasis on current WWE proceedings, make this feel like a spin-off rather than a sequel.
