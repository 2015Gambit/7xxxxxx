It's a great show, but in my opinion season 10 hasn't been as good as the others. There's just something different with everyone. "

,Inpuris,2012-11-14T21:12Z,@MCarne - I totally agree with you.  It seems like the show isn't as exciting as it used to be.  The chemistry with the cast isn't the same as it used to be and the plots aren't as great as they used to be.  I keep watching because I've watched it for so long now and I keep hoping it will get better.
