,isepiq,2012-11-15T04:06Z,Big release from SPARKS here with one of the most anticipated film of the year. They released the 720p bluray to “The Dark Knight Rises” which is the triumphant conclusion of Christopher Nolan’s Batman saga. I’ve seen it last summer and really enjoyed it. Size for this release is 1.5 DVD-5 and english subtitles are embedded. Have a good one. (Quote From Release Log)

With ""normal"" movies you can just change the aspect ratio to 16:9 in VLC but with this movie it looks like the black borders wont go away..

The downloads have been extreemly slow latley?"
,LemCaution,2012-11-15T23:41Z,"Definitively:

The movie was shot--around 60/40%--in two formats: Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and true (15/65mm) IMAX with an aspect ratio of 1.44:1.

The IMAX footage was all shot 'protected'* for a 1.78:1 or 16x9 frame as this dual aspect ratio presentation is what was always intended for the Bluray release (and is what was used on the Dark Knight Bluray).

You shouldn't really notice if you're not looking for it. If you did, good for you. It's still correct, though.

[*Due to the obscene size of the IMAX screen, one needs to leave more 'headroom' while framing closeups of the 15/65mm footage, placing the eyes at the centre of the frame as opposed to the top third. This is in order to avoid the audience having to look too high up. I imagine much of the conversion from 1.44 to 1.78 was just trimming this.]"

I had to log in to post this because most of you are obviously retarded.  to those of you complaining about the aspect ratio changing, its because portions of the film were shot in IMAX.  Jesus Christ.  The director is anything but retarded.  IMAX uses a different size film, thus changing the aspect ratio to a full screen to accommodate for IMAX projectors and screens.  the rest of the film was shot in regular 16:9 aspect ratio.  Holy fuck.  if you want to learn more about the technical side of it then fuckin use google."

If he would at least keep some focuse on wide shoots for some scenes with wide plan but noo even close up gets some random imax shoot. THAT IS FuCKED uP !  and i dont need google for it to have my opinion about it . I dont need to go into technical details to see how dumb solution it was to shoot some scens for imax and other dont .  Awesome movie fucked up by dumbshit producers experiment who must feel bad it aint 3D . It is not director tho . it is not like director is good .. those pure fuckers have whole movie studio over their head wich in this case interfer to make something ""techincaly"" modern ... and you see how it turns out.

,ntfs777,2012-11-21T02:25Z,so which version of this movie has the best audio quality and no aspect ratio problem?
,hxxq,2012-11-21T03:54Z,"@comicNerd: I LIKE THIS TYPE OF ASPECT RATIOS SWITCHING BETWEEN IMAX & 16:9....
its Realistic.. one way to see wat imax looks like..

if u buy the BD which u gonna wait until dec .. then u wont see IMAX ratio anymore.. just the THE DARK KNIGHT...

IF U LOVE DA MOVIE WHO CARES ABOUT ASPECT RATIOS...

download the 12gb version of this play it on 50"" LED.. see how it luks."
,kevwil93,2012-11-22T03:04Z,"All of you whiny babies out there complaining about this FREE movie.  There is nothing wrong with this.  Maybe you want the uploader to massage your feet and stroke your dicks while you are watching this?  Get off you mothers' basement couches and get a life.

,Up_Yours_,2012-11-22T19:16Z,"@hxxq 

The aspect ratio on the blu ray will switch back and forth just like this does. 

And I don't understand why people are complaining about the movie switching back and forth from imax. Did you guys not see the dark knight?? It did the exact same thing. It was even announced that they would be shooting more scenes in the imax format for TDKR. "
,LemCaution,2012-11-22T19:54Z,"The DVD of The Dark Knight was cropped to 2.39:1 whereas the Bluray had switching aspect ratios.

Presumably, 'Rises' will be the same."

and i dont care all about transformers dude. Just point with example that hero falling , hero rising is kinda clitche but Dark Knight Rises from this directer is just about how he do it . How everthing around it all the details are great and  mood and especialy how awesome bad guys he make. "

,24to1,2012-11-27T16:33Z,"Hey guys..if your using VLC or similar players go to video and choose ""cropping"" and select 2.39:1...that'll put a 2.39:1 hard matte over the entire movie and preserve all scenes in 2.39:1 and crop the IMAX scenes a little but Chris Nolan composed for both scope and flat 1.78 so you won't loose to much. I personally enjoy shifting aspect ratios but many don't. I appreciate the upload very much and am downloading now!"
