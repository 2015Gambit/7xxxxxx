Dave Aju ΓÇô Caller #7 (Seth Troxler & Subb-an remix)

The divine boogie-fuelled electro pop of ΓÇ£Caller#7ΓÇ¥ stood out as one of the most flamboyant and ear- snagging tracks on the album, so who better to entrust the remix to than Seth Troxler and Subb-an? Seth of course is a long-time partner of Circus Company, stretching back to 2008 when he first recorded an EP for us with Patrick Russell. Subb-an may be a new cat to us, but there╩╝s no denying the impact he has made with his releases for some of the strongest tech house labels around.

In the hands of this formidable duo, ΓÇ£Caller#7ΓÇ¥ gets sharpened and honed into a peak-time floor-filler. The vocals from Dave and dOP╩╝s Jaw and that inimitable bassline remain intact, with the focus switched to boosting the rhythms that propel this party-starter while a disgruntled caller drops in on Radio KAJU to speak her mind like a true soul sister should.
