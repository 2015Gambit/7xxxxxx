Tell me, when do you get to upload the eps in your time? Is it consistant or whenever you get to it? I'd like to be able to schedule my downloads around it, is all, if possible.

Thanks"

When I have some days off, I do it earlier, but since I need to be at home for at least 3 hours because I don´t let my computer run when I´m not home, so I don´t really have a schedule..!  "

I work shiftwork too (power industry). What shiftwork do you do, if I may be so bold as to ask?
