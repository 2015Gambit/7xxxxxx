Grab your partner by the hand - the BBC have raided their archive and brought
to light glittering performances by country artists over the last four decades.

Star appearances include Tammy Wynette, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash and, of
course, Dolly Parton. All the greats have performed for the BBC at some point
on entertainment shows, in concert and at the BBC studios. Some of the rhinestones
revealed are Charley Pride's Crystal Chandeliers from the Lulu Show, Emmylou
Harris singing Together Again on the Old Grey Whistle Test and Billie Jo Spears's
Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad from the Val Doonican Music Show.

We're brought up to date with modern country hits by kd lang, Garth Brooks,
Alison Krauss and Taylor Swift, plus a special un-broadcast performance from
Later...with Jools Holland by Willie Nelson.
