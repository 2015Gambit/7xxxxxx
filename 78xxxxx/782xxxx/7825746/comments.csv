,IndigoAK,2012-11-14T22:18Z,"I have Steam installed as I actually use it for legitimate games from time to time, and this crack still doesn't work without changing my time zone.  Nor do any of the others."
,Cin2,2012-11-14T23:33Z,"I did everything, when i lounch SP or zombies it closes the game and asks to log in steam, whats the problem? can't seem to find anyone talking about this."
,vatel88,2012-11-14T23:45Z,"Only works if you change time zone to Honk Kong,  not an actual crack fix imo but their is a known workaround so the game is still playable. "
,Viciously,2012-11-15T01:14Z,Thanks.
,tedwu,2012-11-15T01:53Z,"Strangely time zone change does not work anymore. They must figured it out somehow. Newer patch is required.
For a while it worked until I get to the mission
where Mandez planed to control all the crews.
Great game and story though. Might actually be worth it to buy."

,jadawgkss,2012-11-15T08:52Z,"yeah, that was the key thomas_gabriel. Date = 11/14/2012, and run as admin. I've modified a batch script to do all this for me. Just save the following in a text editor as a file with the .bat extension. Also right click t6sp.exe and go to compatibility tab, tick the box for run as administrator.  Also you'll need to modify the lines for the location to cd to where t6sp is located and the time zone you reside in. Here is the text: 

@echo off
TZUTIL /s ""North Asia Standard Time""
set TMPDATE=%DATE%
date 11-14-12
D:
cd GamesCall of Duty 9Game
t6sp.exe
WAIT 1
date %TMPDATE%
TZUTIL /s ""Eastern Standard Time""
exit"
