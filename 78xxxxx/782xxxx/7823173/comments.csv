,eraevn,2012-11-14T08:11Z,"Scottjwkelly according to show promos, it was a 90 minute episode, not a double, so that would be where you were confused. Otherwise, thanks for keeping my Sons fix covered ettv!"
,JuggaloZeke,2012-11-14T08:32Z,Anyone else have a problem with the audio not being synced with the video?
,NearbyMitch,2012-11-14T12:47Z,"@bonnievilleangel, ACTUAL!!!! We origional old guys that have been brought up with avi torrents are in serious need!! All sons of anarchy torrents are getting over run by gay ass mp4 and shit like that. Although i love your work and what you do for us!! But it would be nice to share the way that we used to share about 1 year or so ago, with avi. 
THANKS AGAIN!!!!!"
,KEG09,2012-11-14T14:11Z,yep this didn't work for me the audio was muffled as the audio didn't match the video ;(
,a51c5,2012-11-14T14:54Z,"Thx for the quick upload, seeding it..."

,Hysterics,2012-11-14T17:50Z,"If you guys have such an issue with the format, try a conversion program and put a bit of work in yourselves? You're getting it free, these guys shouldn't be getting harassed into releasing these episodes in every variation possible lol... I imagine they have enough on their plates. Why do people even care though, I don't understand obviously. I remember the first torrent I downloaded was a Cam of the first Lotr trilogy film. I've been torrenting for awhile, and using FTP servers prior to that. So being old school really has nothing to do with it..."
,Jason310M,2012-11-14T19:33Z,"You people sound like a bunch of whining old ladies. Aren't you getting this shit for free? What a bunch of ungrateful pricks. Convert the fucking file to avi yourselves, it's not that hard. Lazy and ungrateful what a combo."
,arildus,2012-11-15T13:48Z,Thanx:)
,scottsasse,2012-11-21T13:37Z,"WTF, no 350MB rip this month? From anyone?? Oh well, I'll live. Thanks for another awesome torrent and thanks seeders!!"
