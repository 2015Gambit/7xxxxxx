,cujimmmy,2012-11-15T10:03Z,"Still does'nt change the fact that the TvTeam are D....H....s  for not supplying any info on any of their torrents check them out. And all you lot of TvTeam LOVERS are just as bad for supporting them. As far as puberty is concerned If only I could go back Google that! There are far better uploaders in the torrent community than them.
Goodbye all you Pussies I won't be revisiting"
