,s0bersky,2012-11-13T18:41Z,Why is it compressed into 20 *.rar files?
,M0fu,2012-11-13T20:00Z,It's a damn fake! Avoid people.
,nmdanny,2012-11-13T21:11Z,"This is actually real, but it's suspicious that it's split into 20 rars called ""how i nailed your momma"""
,expiry5,2012-11-13T22:28Z,"They have renamed the rars before and it's been alright. Just a joke I suppose. But I'll write here if there's anything weird with the file. No idea why they split up the files, but sceneline is usually one of the most trustworthy luckily."
