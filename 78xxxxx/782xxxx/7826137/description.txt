Maybe that's juste me, or the fact that both movie stars Marcello Mastroianni in a mostly nightlife context, but La notte, released just about a year after La dolce vitta seems to me to be the perfect counterpoint to Fellini's opus. Yet don't think for a moment the movie needs an external reference to justify its existence or viewing : it's an Antonioni masterpiece (means one of cinema highest point).
No synospis-no spoiling.
