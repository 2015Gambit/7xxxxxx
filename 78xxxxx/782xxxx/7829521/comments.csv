,suiteo,2012-11-16T02:48Z,Plot? IMDB Link??? Without either of these two items (not to mention the technical specs of the video itself) I just can't be bothered with any of your downloads.   Do you expect me to believe this is DVD quality otherwise?

Your new here aren't you? Do you see a description saying it's dvd quality? It's TS(telesync).. talking trash to the TvTeam - LOL"

Also, to add to dobe_100's comment: Are you really complaining about there not being a synopsis or an imdb link, like you couldn't just go to imdb.com yourself and look it up? That's downright lazy."
