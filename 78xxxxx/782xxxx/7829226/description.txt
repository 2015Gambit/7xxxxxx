The Villagers Band is led by Chris Adwar. The 11 piece band has taken Afro Fusion to another level having managed to pull a following that loves their heavily influenced Benga, Mbalax, Kwela, Mbaqanga, Hi-life and other forms of African music, fused with smooth urban chords and melodies. Before Sauti Soul, there was The Villagers Band. This is their first Album, Norfolk Hotel, released in 2010.
