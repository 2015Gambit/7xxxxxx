,tonarpos,2012-11-14T13:24Z,"Thanks murphy78, another quality upload. I've just heard that the T.F.K team are adding their name to this one and will be uploading it as soon as they finish gangbanging petrus7!!"
,H1TCH0130,2012-11-14T13:42Z,"hello is this torrent the same as this:

,murphy78,2012-11-14T22:00Z,"most likely tonarpos.

As far as what's better, it depends what you want to install.  For just straight English Windows 8 Pro x86, this is the best iso on the internet right now.  For other stuff, it depends.

Sorry T.F.K fanboys, I understand your discontent, but he steals my work and lies about it."
,lolipopus,2012-11-15T00:44Z,"Murphy, can you upload a new version of simkey to Cyberlink Powerdirector 11? (the new update is 2215 i think)"
,murphy78,2012-11-15T10:25Z,"lolipopus Some people were having issues with that upload because it was the trial download version that I simply replaced the simkey.  If they changed the methodology where the same simkey I used no longer works, then I'm at a loss.  I'm not a keygen creation guy.  Although I could probably figure out how to create things like that given enough time and effort, I prefer to stick to mostly windows integration stuff.

Once in a while, if I come across a program that I like that nobody has uploaded, I might up it.  I don't plan on spending a lot of time on personally bypassing security measures.  That kind of work really would take a long time to learn.

Sorry mate,

,H1TCH0130,2012-11-17T04:22Z,can you post some screenshots on your registration and validity of windows 8?
,murphy78,2012-11-17T05:24Z,"You should be asking for that stuff on scypt's torrents, not here. This is an integration release."
,H1TCH0130,2012-11-17T05:55Z,is this a retail channel?
,murphy78,2012-11-18T06:48Z,"I made the ei.cfg and set it to retail, but it won't affect the install or files installed at all.  The only way it will try to use retail methodology is if you use custom slmgr.vbs commands to activate rather than an activator.  Activators set the activation type.  Well, at least scypt's does.  I don't know about other ones.

I haven't seen an actual legit retail capture yet, but when I do, and I can verify; I will probably start using it.  I'm pretty sure the only difference will be the EULA though..."
,H1TCH0130,2012-11-18T10:49Z,so it means that this version of yours is the same as retail version out there?
