 His friends listen to what he has to say, and he returns the favor. He knows how to achieve the perfect knot in a necktie, and more important, he knows when he should be wearing a tie in the first place. Oh, and his favorite ball cap? He knows when to wear it and when to leave it at home on his dresser. Becoming a gentleman doesnΓÇÖt happen in an instant; itΓÇÖs a lifelong exercise in refining etiquette, social interaction, and personal discipline. It all begins here.
