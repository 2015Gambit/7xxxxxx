RELEASENOTES

We proudly present quality music, in quantity.
The differences between us and other groups is that we spend time and money on releasing, just  for fun.
Other groups are only doing this for the leech slots, fame, and glory.

We don't need fake trial members that will tarnish our group with their crappy releases.
That happened once and will not happen again.
If you  would like to offer something of value to us, we are always willing to listen, come find us.

About the Quality and Quantity:
All people have different tastes in music, so quality is subjective.
Keep your opinions to yourself and we encourage you to make our mission your mission (Quality and Quantity)
