ΓÇ£Leave it to Peter Heller to imagine a postapocalyptic world that contains as much loveliness as it does devastation. His hero, Hig, flies a 1956 Cessna (his dog as copilot) around what was once Colorado, chasing all the same things we chase in these pre-annihilation days: love, friendship, the solace of the natural world, and the chance to perform some small kindness. The Dog Stars is a wholly compelling and deeply engaging debut.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇöPam Houston, author of Contents May Have Shifted

A riveting, powerful novel about a pilot living in a world filled with lossΓÇöand what he is willing to risk to rediscover, against all odds, connection, love, and grace.

Hig survived the flu that killed everyone he knows. His wife is gone, his friends are dead, he lives in the hangar of a small abandoned airport with his dog, his only neighbor a gun-toting misanthrope. In his 1956 Cessna, Hig flies the perimeter of the airfield or sneaks off to the mountains to fish and to pretend that things are the way they used to be. But when a random transmission somehow beams through his radio, the voice ignites a hope deep inside him that a better lifeΓÇösomething like his old lifeΓÇöexists beyond the airport. Risking everything, he flies past his point of no returnΓÇönot enough fuel to get him homeΓÇöfollowing the trail of the static-broken voice on the radio. But what he encounters and what he must faceΓÇöin the people he meets, and in himselfΓÇöis both better and worse than anything he could have hoped for.

Narrated by a man who is part warrior and part dreamer, a hunter with a great shot and a heart that refuses to harden, The Dog Stars is both savagely funny and achingly sad, a breathtaking story about what it means to be human.
