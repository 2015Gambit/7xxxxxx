This download is a .ISO file intended to be written directly to a blank 4.4GB DVD. Then you can play it on your living room Blu-Ray console connected to your big screen HDTV. You can also play it on your computer DVD drive with appropriate software. The video is encoded in a hybrid format called BD5 that is compatible with all Blu-Ray console players but not likely any DVD consoles.

If you wish to play the download on your computer you can use a virtual DVD emulator utility, like the free DAEMONTools Lite, to "mount" the .ISO file as a temporary DVD drive. Then you can play the video directly using any Blu-Ray compatible media player application.
