The Red Balloon (Le Ballon Rouge) 1956 PDTV x264 AAC iPod mp4

This award-winning short film directed by Albert Lamorisse elegantly captures the adventures of a boy who befriends a seemingly sentient balloon and follows it through the streets of Paris.

Freshly restored and presented in the best possible picture quality, The Red Balloon (Le Ballon Rouge) is widely recognised as one of the most important films in children’s cinema, and this 1956 classic is the only dialogue-free film to win an Oscar for Best Screenplay.

Lamorisse was once described by the New York Times as "...a remarkable artist: one of the cinema’s best poets and a fearless explorer of the scary and exhilarating outbacks of the imagination."
