,Codine85,2012-11-14T23:36Z,"At NewportBox

I bet you have had a lovely life, with very little struggle and with your mothers Brest never too far away. Sitting behind your computer screen never to think outside of your little safety bubble about real life other than your self-indulgent, stereo typical, mind numbingly unintelligent verbal aids. Spreading across a sanctuary where people can come and say thanks for other peoples hard work and dedication to the cause.. I do hope you contract Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and die alone.. this must be a situation of the straw that broke the Camel’s back...."
,Codine85,2012-11-14T23:38Z,"Ps, Thank you for the up.. Much appreciated.. 
film good and quality is great.. Thank you.. :) "

and can u all stop wasting ur time with NewportBox, we all know hes hurt cause daddy rape him... instead of reminding him his miserable life, lets all make a complain on the piratebay support not here. "
,digital.dominion,2012-11-15T05:12Z,"@NewportBox

I guess there's at least one of every kind of person in existence out there in this crazy, fucked-up civilization of ours. I just hope in this case there's only ONE like you. You are an island, and the bridge that connects you to this world is a one-way road. You might be surprised at how good it feels to give back to others what they so freely give to you. You should try it sometime. I dare you..."
,funseeker521,2012-11-15T05:41Z,"@Newportbox you stupid kunt, seeding won't affect your download speed and unless you're some super geek programmer or DBA it won't affect your bandwidth either. And if you were that, you wouldn't be here cheaping out."
,repsolfireblade05,2012-11-15T05:53Z,"cheers ez great stuff...@newportcock oh sorry box ,,that means pussy where im from ..hey didnt you know that youve been hacked and your bandwidth is already dwindling away ,:-)"

thanks for the upload"
,omgwtfnoob,2012-11-15T06:44Z,"FOR PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT 2 FILES:
if you're watching on your pc, you can add both files into VLC to play them back-to-back which is the same as 1 file... you don't have to get up and start the next file or anything:
just start vlc, select both files, drag into vlc. part 2 will auto play after part 1.

Thanks for the up EZ, been waiting for this one, looks good according to IMDB!"
,magical_nut,2012-11-15T07:36Z,"You should try helping out the community in which you are obviously taking from NewportBox. It's a pretty dickish move to take and not give back, as I'm sure your boyfriend has told you. :)

mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -forceidx ./moviecd1.avi ./moviecd2.avi -o CombinedAvi.avi

For you Windows freaks, use Movie Maker if you can stand using such a buggy piece of crap that is."

It does this at the same times regardless of the player used. Using primarily vlc. Great quality picture and sound though as I'm sure this is an issue on my end. Any help would be appreciated.

,Krelkal,2012-11-30T18:23Z,"Just a warning, I live on campus and just got an email from my university telling me that they know I've been using file sharing services and if I continue, my internet will be cut off. I read the email further and it turns out that Alliance films actually emailed the university informing them that I downloaded this movie and another (Looper) and asked for them to store my information in case they wish to charge me. 

Just be sure to use proxies to cover you ass for this one. I've been getting a little lax lately."
