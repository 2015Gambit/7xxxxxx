,DTake2012,2012-11-20T19:16Z,Can you upload episode 2 please?
,freeme13,2012-11-21T09:59Z,Please post the second episode ))
,bearnerd,2012-11-21T20:21Z,ep 2 is wanted! 
,trickyjack,2012-11-22T06:36Z,The second episode of this series is impossible to find. Can someone please post it? Cheers.
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-23T23:30Z,"This happened to me once. The claim above that it is not HD, but which I presume takes issue with the HDTV label in the filename.

While technically correct (must be at least 720p), the convention here is different for a very good reason.

Here ""HDTV"" only means it's 16:9, but since you cannot put a colon in a filename, HDTV is used to signify such.

Besides, you'd have to convince ""The Scene"" to change and they listen to NOBODY.

,URAJERK,2012-11-25T20:08Z,"Episode 3 is out now! Please record ep2, it is on television in a few hours! PS-you are not a jerk tvteam"
,Atheoss,2012-11-26T11:21Z,"Where is episode 2?! :( I appreciate you uploading the first one but really enjoyed it, looking for 2 since 3 is coming out. "
,Tleilaxu_Ghola,2012-11-26T15:31Z,I wonder why the 2nd episode is nowhere to be found?? I have been waiting for over a week to download the 2nd episode of this series and like others here have not been able to find it anywhere at all. Wierd.
,Socius11,2012-11-26T21:34Z,"It's really weird that the second episode hasn't come out yet in torrent. The first one was posted the next day. If somebody could register the other episodes, please do us, from the other hemisphere, a big favor. "
,ghenghis1,2012-11-27T06:00Z,"Many thanks, this is a great series."
,gigarest,2012-11-27T06:04Z,"Re: ep. 2 being unavailable: This is a big conspiracy, the CIA is blocking all the torrents from this series from episode 2 onwards to prevent state secrets from being spilled out on the internet and also to get back at Stone for JFK.
(this was a joke attempt, I'm also looking forward to watch episode 2 and 3!)"
,jfhjr,2012-11-27T14:55Z,"Thanks a bunch for this - but WHERE oh WHERE is ep. 2? Not saying it's your ""place"" to upload it I just find it strange that it is nowhere to be found - Thanks again!"
,EJK22,2012-11-30T05:37Z,"Calm down, good people.

Episode 2 didn't even premiere until tonight, with Ep. 3 due next week.

I'm sure we'll see both (and the rest of this awesome series) very soon right here."
,pointus,2012-11-30T07:10Z,"Thanks EJK22, I was wondering what was up with that."
,Atheoss,2012-11-30T23:55Z,Thanks EJK22 but the showtime site said a new episode premeried every monday so... we were just excited and worried I guess. :D 
,linengray,2012-12-01T04:13Z,Actually I have seen episodes 1 through 3. Please put us out of our misery and upload them. We love your TVTeam
,Shlomir,2012-12-01T04:58Z,"Yes, eagerly await episode 2 & 3, not everyone is fortunate to live America to see this!"
