,tee_bee,2012-11-14T03:14Z,60 kbps???  trees move faster than that
,urntwrthy,2012-11-15T04:27Z,There's always the theater since all you want to do is complain.
,pmaltab,2012-11-18T03:12Z,"great, intelligent movie, i loved it! this quality sucked so i saw it on seed.opanasenko.com and it worked well for me, enjoy!"
,some-young-guy,2012-11-18T16:46Z,"Yo ^^^pmaltab^^^, stop fucking spamming your bullshit links.  There is no one torrent source that has exclusivity.  If there is any site that has a legit rip of a title, someone can rip it from that site and seed it here or any of the other file share sites.  So NO, we do not need to go to your fucking pathetic spam site to check out something that you dont have anyway.

Did your parents spawn any children that lived?"
,jawjackr,2012-11-18T17:31Z,This movie was typical Denzel. The man is a master actor. Saw the flick in the theatre but it was so good that I wanted to see it again. I'll report the quality of this after I've watched it.

,solarant,2012-11-19T00:04Z,Can someone upload a Blue Ray version of this movie
,some-young-guy,2012-11-19T01:21Z,"@solarant,

Yeah, just wait for me to run down to the BluRay store and pick up a fresh copy for you.  Gimme like 2 months and I'll get it right up for ya."
,lyon10,2012-11-19T16:02Z,@solarant- how did you get on this site? so you must have seen the preview to know that you want a specific quality of this film.. meaning you understand that its still in theatre and yet you still managed to find a way to ask this stupid question..
