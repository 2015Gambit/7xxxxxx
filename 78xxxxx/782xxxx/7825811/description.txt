Made by Monogram Studios

MP4 files (Nero Digital) ripped from DVD-R
512 x 384 

Audio: AAC 2ch at 128 kbs (mono)

THE APE MAN is a digitally mastered VHS capture of the VCI Home Video release which has the best audio track of any version of THE APE MAN I've come across. (Superior to the Alpha Video aka Oldies.com version)

RETURN OF THE APE MAN comes from the Sinister Cinema DVD-R

Please be aware that RETURN OF THE APE MAN is NOT a sequel to THE APE MAN. It has a new story, different director, different writer . . . 

Nevertheless, it seems natural to offer these two Monogram oldies in one sterling package.

Enjoy and share please.
