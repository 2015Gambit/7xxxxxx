I was about to upload another copy I had downloaded, but yours is better (this other copy was also a true pdf but had lower res pictures, so I presume it was the iPad version. Interestingly, it had a vector cover whereas yours was a bitmap this week.) Anyway, am looking forward to the Texas race, it seems to be a good track. Shame it's only highlights on BBC this time!"
,raymond_u,2012-11-17T06:44Z,"Yes - I'm quite sure the BBC are rooting for Alonso this weekend.

It would be an embarrasment for them if they missed:
1) the inaugural Austin GP
2) the WDC decider
3) the WCC decider

all in one go!"
