Anyway, who are NiL..?? I don';t think i've ever seen a better telesync. The video is an Italian source so there are a few Ital subs (for Engl text). Also, NO endtitles, but the movie appears complete. Otherwise, absolutely flawless. There is NO conceivable reason for anyone to be downloading 1.46 GIGAbytes, e.g. the UNiQUE release. 

V 9 (on ""cam"" scale--no flicker, no crop, no heads, no out-of-focus, no nothin)
A 8 (on cam scale, sync perfect)
M 6.5

Very naughty. I hate to recommend a cam so highly, but i do my part by going to see movies in the theatre periodically. Not this one tho!"
