For those looking for 720p, try one of the many public ""scene"" bbs"

,jfhjr,2012-11-29T12:18Z,"Thanks for the UP TVTeam! Any chance of ep 2 and 3? I wish the so-called ""purists"" would drop all the debate about resolution and just be happy that we get to see this series. Thanks again! (For ALL you do!)"
,EJK22,2012-11-30T05:38Z,"Calm down, good people.

Episode 2 didn't even premiere until tonight, with Ep. 3 due next week.

I'm sure we'll see both (and the rest of this awesome series) very soon right here."
,jfhjr,2012-12-01T12:53Z,@EJK22 - ah that's good to know! I didn't think TVT would keep us hanging like that - thanks for the info!
