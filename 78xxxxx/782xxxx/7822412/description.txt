Research and experience demonstrate two areas with which many new managers are completely unfamiliar: delegating tasks and work, and making decisions. Some struggle with this for years.
 But it doesn't have to be hard. 151 Quick Ideas for Delegating and Decision Making combines 50 years' experience of two managers, and the experiences of other managers who have been interviewed and observed.

Each real world idea has been tried and tested. The best ones are here, in an easy to understand form for you to use. Select those that fit your particular circumstance, for example:
 * Start with the End in Mind
 * Know which decisions to make when
 * Avoid group think
 * Show them, don't tell them
 * Put confidence in competence
 * Give credit and reward success

And even if you are already in a supervisory position, this book can help you do a more effective and efficient job at managing people and tasks.
