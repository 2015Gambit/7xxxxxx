 This guide will teach you how to analyse arguments, speeches, and newspaper articles. It will help you discern faults in reasoning from sound arguments. It looks at the structure of language in order to demonstrate rules by which you can identify good analytical thinking, and will help you to formulate clear, defensible arguments.

 With real life newspaper extracts, a glossary, exercises and answers, and a guide to essay writing, this is an invaluable tool for both students wanting to improve their grades and general readers wanting to boost their brainpower.
