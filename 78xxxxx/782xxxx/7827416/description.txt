This book of puzzles consists of problems that are mathematical or geometric in nature. A good percentage of the puzzles are clever and ingenius, and there are a lot of puzzles. These tend to be quite a bit harder than puzzles and problems in other books of this type, though, and don't lend themselves to a casual environment. You may have to sit at a desk with pencil and paper to solve most of these.
