[T],blackcanary,2012-11-15T15:59Z,"The acronym stands for Harbinger Active Resistance Division. The title's focus was a corporate strike team (representing Omen Enterprises) dealing with Toyo Harada, a character from the Harbinger title, and his goal of controlling all Harbingers. The characters were normal humans who were comatose and revived with an experimental brain implant that also enabled them to access an assortment of artificial Harbinger super-abilities via an operator named 'Softcore.' Capture or death causes the implants to explode, killing the Corps member if he or she was still alive.
