Even after updating to the latest beta driver still does not work. Plus changing the time does not work for most people"
,Taluen,2012-11-13T22:30Z,"SOLVED!!! Download and install steam. You don't need to login in or even have an account.

Also try this together with the timezone trick and ""run as admin"" trick.

Spread the words! Seems like a lot of people are stuck on this."
,mibmib007,2012-11-13T22:31Z,worked like a charm with just the repack crackfix not clock change needed for me.. just applied the crack as usual and voila
,luminatx,2012-11-13T22:35Z,"Doesn't work, but like stated above, set your timezone to +8 Hong Kong, and it works, I dunno why, but it does."

,hiyoelbrian,2012-11-14T01:48Z,"For anyone getting black screens and then crashing when trying to run SP, update your Nvidia drivers to the 310.54 beta, available here: http://www.geforce.com/drivers/beta-legacy"
,hiyoelbrian,2012-11-14T02:10Z,Also you should install the files located in the redist directory in the location you installed the game. After that set your time to +8 Beijing) and play. Worked for me so I hope it works for you.

,mibmib007,2012-11-14T16:48Z,no need for time 8+ hours just dl this one and install steam and it works fin.. dont have to do an account on steam just install it
,jsv88,2012-11-15T03:36Z,"A POSSIBLE FIX for those experiencing the unhandled exception at startup. Many have been saying to change your timezone to +8 Hong Kong, or update to the latest nVidia beta drivers (310.54). If these are not successful, as they weren't for me, change your date to November 13th. This has fixed the issue entirely, but since I also tried the other two fixes, I am uncertain if they are required also. Perhaps others who try it can elaborate."
,KEiGHT(R),2012-11-15T10:38Z,"1)Set time zone to +8 hrs - Hong Kong
2)AND change the date to the 14th

110% WORKS ;)"
