Part one of an occult repository including the old Occult Carrot including  as well as LHP texts and a few rare files I've stumbled across myself.  Includes a text on Tantra called Kiss of the Yogini and a few files documenting the abuses of William Breeze, current OHO of the Ordo Templi Orientis.  This is the second part which contains a trimmed version of the Occult Carrot with sensitive documents related to the OTO.
