,BCwader,2012-11-15T00:12Z,Thank you so much! Been looking for it. Seems I just can't get enough of Project Runway.

,funkypanda,2012-11-15T00:36Z,this is a bad rip. it skips about 3 or 4 times during the episode!
[T],rkstr,2012-11-15T01:21Z,this is the ONLY rip that me or anyone else will post.I hardly think 3 or 4 skips is anything to get worked up about but by all means do better if you can
,gsonQb,2012-11-15T06:14Z,"shut up punk @funkypanda,dudes busting his ass when he doesnt need to.. ungrateful prick."
[T],rkstr,2012-11-15T07:34Z,"thanks @gsonQb - I just watched the whole episode and it didn't skip once,in fact its a better rip than the previous episodes.Either way, the sheer ingratitude of Funkypanda is indicative of why I need time off from here"
[T],rkstr,2012-11-15T07:58Z,BTW all the series I currently upload will continue to be upped by someone deluded enough to take over from me for a while.They will be using using my log ins so it will be business as usual although he might not be as fast as me getting shows posted but at least they will be
,peachpuppy,2012-11-15T19:45Z,This is fine. Thanks!

,chernye,2012-11-17T02:30Z,"@rkstr
don't let these comments bring you down or annoy you, there always will be stupid people who don't appreciate someones hard work, but most of us are really grateful and we love you :)"

,saffronsghost,2012-11-17T13:48Z,"Yep, no problems with this file.  Love when assholes with bad PCs try and make uploaders feel bad.  Ignore them, and thanks again rk."
,KwaakBoom,2012-11-18T09:54Z,"Always appreciated!  If you don't like it, post your own or shut up.  As for me, big hugs for feeding my fix, rk!"
