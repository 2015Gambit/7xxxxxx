The seven remaining designers are taken the Melbourne Convention & Exhibition Centre where they are told the materials for their next challenge are in the boots* of the cars next to them. Alex tells them they must create a distinctive showstopping look featuring volume and curves. They realise this challenge will test their powers of innovation when they discover their outfits must be entirely constructed from recycled bags! Who will wow the judges and who will recycle the wrong kind of design?

 *In Australia we call the trunk of a car the boot and we call the hood the bonnet

A big thank you to all original cappers and posters
