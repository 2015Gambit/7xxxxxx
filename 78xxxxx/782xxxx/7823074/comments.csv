[T],FatFreddy271,2012-11-14T05:35Z,"This is real its been up on other p2p sites for a few hours now, as you can see by the green skull of course its real"
,piranical,2012-11-14T06:00Z,"@ GambitWallstar uploader has a skull, has taken the time and effort to upload shitloads of other excellent torrents here (as opposed to your 0) and has, again, given us an awesome torrent for free. that's about as 'real' as it gets. go back to your hidey hole in the basement you ungrateful wanker."
,wpdfa,2012-11-14T07:38Z,"I've been DYING to see this movie! It came to my theatre for like ONE week and then it was gone, so glad it's finally up but why is EVERY brrip of it like totally flooded with leechers?? Is that natural for brand new movies and will it settle down sometime and level out so I can actually download? I have all 3 high res ones downloading right now but LowOrbit's one is the only one that is even sort of going the other two including this one are stuck around 1 week remaining... what the hell people, did that many people actually already download it and delete it/not seed it and make it hard for everyone else to download it? is that how it works?>"
