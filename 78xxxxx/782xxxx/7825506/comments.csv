,mooserocka,2012-11-15T00:27Z,alot of people said this is a great anime im still debating on if i should give it a shot. What are your opinions daman?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-15T01:31Z,"i was the same as you, i was like this crap looks bad, gave it a try and it was hilarious, the Dub is amazing."
,mooserocka,2012-11-16T02:44Z,Ok daman i will give it a try. Thats why i always ask for a review or opinion. Ok lets see how it is. Thanks for the EARLY upload daman. So any of the other anime i listed comming out EARLY???
,Raigeki1091,2012-11-17T16:31Z,"Daman, do you have a release schedule or do you just upload anime when the blue ray is available?"
,mooserocka,2012-11-18T05:44Z,I think he should make a shedule cause sometiems he gets the anime out like THIS ANIME like 3 months before the release date.
,Manhackv12,2012-11-18T22:56Z,"Mooserocka, why so demanding bro?"
,mooserocka,2012-11-19T01:22Z,what are you talking about man the person before me said something about a schedule and i agreed? weird ne way it would be awesome. If not o well up to daman as long as he keeps doin what hes doin ill be happy. 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-21T15:02Z,"there cant be a schedule because you never know how long the Encoding and OCR process is going to take. 
1080p videos usually take around 1hour each 
while 720p are 30mins or so. "
,mooserocka,2012-11-22T01:25Z,o ok cool. So its basically whatever you get in your possesion you upload right away got ya. 
,mooserocka,2012-11-22T01:28Z,O yea also im gonna keep pushing for shangri la please lol.
