,chop007,2012-11-14T20:46Z,Who the heck wants 2.3.5 when I.C.S and Jelly Bean are out for this sgs2? 2.3.5 is older than my grandmothers hang nipples.
,sinan101,2012-11-14T22:41Z,"some people want the old version

because its fast and use less ram and battery

it's your choice :)"
,chop007,2012-11-17T18:32Z,"Absolute nonsense, ICS and now Jelly Bean with Siyah kernel and Extweaks is about 47 percent more battery efficient than 2.3.5, what the heck are you trying to do? Naa my friend I do not trust your torrent at all, you don't even know what you are talking about. And anyways, the 2.3.5 version is downloadable from xda and they do not put any spy applications/dodgy shit in their downloads. At least get a clue buddy before being all smart ass. Anyways, just warning others I do not trust this torrent because the uploader is a either a moron or a budding scam artist."
