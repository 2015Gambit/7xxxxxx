,ChocoboDreams,2012-11-14T17:39Z,"Thanks once again! Last Metallica you linked to was in beta, does this one require I back up ""Paris"" as well? Is it all one set difficulty, or will I be able to slowly adapt to the song?...I guess these are questions I'll have answered myself by the time you respond, but it'd be good for other people to know. Looking forward to Radiohead. "
,kdobbs74,2012-11-14T18:23Z,"No backups are needed for these custom songs. I believe they are all pretty much ""beta"" versions to try out. Some have different difficulties and some don't. The whole custom song creation still has some work but it is coming alone a lot faster than I thought it would. The guys working on the custom songs are really doing an awesome job and I will try and share what I find out with you via torrents. 
Just to let everyone know, the last two DLCs we are missing will be gifted tomorrow and there will be the complete DLC torrent out. Either Emp will up it or I will. Stay tuned."

,sulsa23,2012-11-15T00:50Z,"Wow, fantastic! Even though you can't do all the options with these songs, it's still amazing! "
,sulsa23,2012-11-15T00:52Z,I like how these songs were named. That way I can easily find them and delete them if they are ever updated. 
,noshirtnopants,2012-11-17T00:52Z,"I hate to be that guy, but I added these to my content folder just like all the others, but they are not showing up in my songs list. I am using the tinyiso release without the cable fix. Any suggestions? Or will these be in a different spot than the other tracks in game?

Theemporrer and Kdobbs74 you guys do awesome work, I don't know if you two are working the the google code page, but I am very excited in what this community will develop towards. "

,veky12,2012-11-26T14:12Z,"Great, cant wait polished versions of the songs, great work. Rocksmith Custom Song Project rocks!!"
,m0ranwad,2012-11-29T17:38Z,"I had no problem with the ""76 DLC"" torrent. However, I can't seem to get these to work properly. I followed the same process that I did with the other torrent.

Using Legit Rocksmith.

Suggestions?"
