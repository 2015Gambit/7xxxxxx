Even though there is about 10 different uploaders now."
,Damien74,2012-11-14T23:50Z,Red she-hulk? That's SO stupid. Moneymaker... but a bad one I hope ^^
,STFmaryville,2012-11-15T02:28Z,The character used to be interesting but after revealing her ID it has been all downhill. Not impressed by this issue. Thanks blackcanary for sharing it anyway!
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-15T05:37Z,"this issue was ul'd with the ads, even. kewwwl"
,kakuichi1,2012-11-16T01:27Z,"nice to see ppl still bitch & complain about free shit!  btw, the character has a personality all it's own & has been burnt by her father & banner.  The character's persona, especially the anger issues when in hulk form makes perfect sense.  Stop trolling & picking everything apart for no reason!"
