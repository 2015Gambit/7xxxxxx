Are you going to be uploading a 720p rip as well? Something not larger than 4.3GB would be ideal.

That other 720p rip is 6.5 GB. This is 'SD' and 1.4 GB.

,Xenirina,2012-11-15T10:10Z,"Users with slow downloads:

The slow downloads is because of the seed-to-leech ratio. This is a massive amount of people downloading and not enough uploading.

,term421,2012-11-15T13:29Z,"@ newportbox

only a fucking noob would set their upload speed to 0kb/s. yours and others' clients are going to skip over making peer connections because of it. again, fucking laughably noobish. 

also being proud of 300kbs down 100kbs up makes me think you're 12 years old and have no idea what sort of capacities truly high speed internet connections are available. 

lastly, the audio. either mine and mine alone sounds tinny, the rip isn't good, the rip isn't what it claims to be or the movie has shit quality audio at time itself."

If you're still burning this shit to DVD's you're a fucking loser, or part of the real problem with the file sharing community in that you're selling the shit to other people turning a side profit...

And for all you ""Non-Seeders and Proud"", you have got to be dumbasses. If you don't seed, your download goes slower, because your competing for information from other people that you could be providing yourself. Keeping the data pool diverse is helpful to your own download. Just like if your family would have kept it's gene-pool diverse it would have helped you. Oh well, too late.

Again, thanks for the upload Acesn8s, and all you non-selfish, non-inbreds, seeding at Max capacity. Your a credit to this community and the human race."

This movie is amazing because for the first time Bane has also a brain alongside his muscles.
The film yet contradict the second, but that's okay, because we can say that Batman is human after all. And before becomming a legend he has to be thrown on his knees. To RISE again.
And Batman, the Batman we loved from the movie, dies. But Bruce Wayne is not Batman
Batman is everyone and anyone.
I must say I loved this movie also I wish for a Director's Cut or an Uncut version of it. And it will be perfect. To me this Batman ends the way it was told before. Just the first two and you'll realize that everything was predicted. We do not hear it, but we understand it."

Quality could be a lot better for a 1.38GB file. Black bars at the top and bottom of the video are also unnecessary."
,tororosso85,2012-11-23T13:14Z,"The most STUPID rip i have ever watch in my life.
One time aspect ratio is 2.35:1, the other 1.85:1 and so...

For that reason 
V=0"
,mandly,2012-11-23T20:00Z,"That's because the film was shot in both the IMAX format and with 35mm, which is why the aspect ratio changes. Your statement is stupid, the rip is great."
,CarlZeiss,2012-11-23T21:46Z,"Video equals 10
Audio equals 10
Film equals 8

The opening scene was amazing.  Most of the movie I was sort of lost as far as the what the fuck was going on with the story.  Like most Christopher Nolan films there isn't a break with the score, the characters are always busy.  I'd say this is the best Batman film so far.  "

,MattandCindy,2012-11-23T23:08Z,"To extremezone, 

  Me and my wife just registered, even though we've been d/l and u/l your stuff for at least a year, maybe two. You are an AWESOME cog in the machine, and we wanted to thank you. We see people show gratitude for what you've done, and just like them, we want you to know that we appreciate all you've been able to do for us townsfolk, you digital Robin Hood. PLEASE...keep it up!

,DWLR,2012-11-23T23:53Z,"audio is weird for me. The guy in the mask is very loud and Bruce is very quiet. almost like a channel was missing during encoding. 
Also, file splitting is a little annoying."
,BurningThemDown,2012-11-24T00:25Z,"Watched this last night on a 42"" flat screen and it was perfect. Although, yes, it gets loud and quiet often it's still worth the download.

,Nusent,2012-11-24T00:32Z,"Why is this split into 2 parts, you fucking asshole."
,digitalflavor,2012-11-24T12:01Z,Please stop splitting files.
,bartaz,2012-11-24T16:52Z,"Seeders: 20471

So why i'm downloading this with 50kb/s? Please guys seed this with max transfer for some minutes.."

,Bloodsatanix,2012-11-24T17:44Z,"Good Quality, but these Batman movies just get worse.Dark,quiet and boring.I swear the only good movie DC has done is The Green Lantern."
,Bloodsatanix,2012-11-24T17:49Z,"Good Quality.
But just another overhyped boring batman movie.
The only thing DC has done that is good was the Green Lantern movie.

The Dark Knight Rises?, I thought I was watching Wall Street."
,ribamar84,2012-11-24T18:21Z,nice movie
,murderhole2012,2012-11-24T21:18Z,I fell asleep during this movie
,NotPopular2,2012-11-25T03:46Z,"thanks Acesn8s

@Nusent - Chill out. Maybe you need a girl in your life. Check out http://amaturematch.net and you can look for a horny one near you. It's better than complaining."
,TheobaldDancelot,2012-11-25T06:48Z,"thanks v much for this upload Sparks/Acesn8s.
and thanks especially for making it a split 2 x 700mb file. 

audio is fine for me..and video too of course

to all of you idiots, if people did not want split files why would this be top seeded file in history? just go download an alternative source and stop whining pls"
,ratednext,2012-11-25T08:05Z,"OMFG guys i have a solution for split files! are you ready for this? open your playlist... and put BOTH videos in there... your mind is blown right? right!? 

tl;dr its not a big deal. queue both files in a vid player and enjoy the full movie."
,ut_bhai,2012-11-25T16:21Z,humbs up! :) 
,oifwolf,2012-11-25T23:28Z,"just watching my networking class, 
thought i would share something with the class.
Pirates aren't killing the Block Buster and small video stores it is all the Red Box machines.
go to Mc.D off the dollar menu and get a red box dvd for under 5 bucks. who wants to buy a movie for 20?"
,yamato74,2012-11-26T12:28Z,"Why split the movie in 2 ""cds""? This is so obsolete."
,tracs,2012-11-27T02:04Z,"""Hi! I'm traumatised because I downloaded the latest BatMan movie for FREE but because it's a split file, halfway through I had to *GASP* press play a 2nd time. I'm currently in counselling to *SOB* overcome this horrific incident. I coped w/ being gang-raped in prison by the Aryan Brotherhood but this ""having to press play AGAIN in the middle of a movie"" is more than I can bare :(.""

Stop whining Softcocks ;)"
,fookju,2012-11-27T05:49Z,thx
,everyonepremium,2012-11-27T11:21Z,best movie
,topherb,2012-11-29T05:13Z,"Thanks to the uploader. Sure you can load up both CD's in a playlist or hit play twice, but for some people who run home media servers that depend on single files 2 CD's is a pain. I just find another torrent which is why I haven't grabbed this. But for those who don't care, thanks to the Uploader once again."
,SleazyAbe,2012-11-29T18:13Z,Worst Batman movie EVER. Or at least AS bad as Batman & Robin or Batman Forever.- Wtf happened? The first two were great...and now iÂ´m just stunned with disappointment:(
,Maylice,2012-11-29T19:25Z,"That's so annoying that I actually had to register just to comment on this matter.

Guys,
START USING KMPLAYER!
It plays as long as it finds anything to play in the given folder. There is just an almost unrecognizable glitch before the next movie/part kicks in. (One of the best ways to chain yourselves to the screen :) )
Hard to believe it hasn't been told several times at this site, but I had to repeat. Just to make sure...

Either way, I'm here now so let me have the chance to say a thousand times of thanks for wonderful uploads here. It's been a pleasure and will be - I hope - so long. So THANK YOU (x1000).

- Maylice"

audio is rubbish quality, rest is fine"
,Government10,2012-11-30T06:45Z,"Why dont you cunts QQ more about it being two files...

Either learn to merge the two files in a video editing program of your choice...  or add the two files as a playlist, again, in a player of your choice.

complain harder, about free shit.
