A towering talent in the future house scene and one of BristolΓÇÖs most adored exports, Eats Everything is about to deliver his first full EP for the kindred spirits at Futureboogie Recordings. Displaying his softer sound palate, the mid-tempo grooves of the aptly named ΓÇÿSlow For Me EPΓÇÖ are more slinky than slamming but every bit as cheeky.

Described by Resident Advisor as a purveyour of ΓÇÿfull fat houseΓÇÖ, Daniel Pearce aka Eats Everything follows up the monster ΓÇÿVertigo EPΓÇÖ on Dirtybird with an altogether moodier trio of tracks to usher you gently into the the wintry months ahead.

A-side ΓÇÿTone MusicΓÇÖ builds with a melodic structure of electronic droplets as rattling percussion does the driving. An injection of techno wonk stabs blended with pitched down RnB sampling, ΓÇÿTone MusicΓÇÖ is a sonic patchwork of futuristic beams and bleeps, synth shards, and shakers.

Moving into crackling, dubby terrain, ΓÇÿLo To HiΓÇÖ is a spooky affair with solid claps and a nifty little bassline groove. As warped vocal snippets float into the atmosphere, the swirling pads serve to envelop the senses and build a sense of tension and drama up to the break.

In keeping with the slower vein and bathed in warm, ethereal pads, ΓÇÿDoldrumsΓÇÖ builds with distorted synth melodies and chopped up vox until the rise of drums, and unexpected drop of heavy bassline throb along with subtle twists of acid swerve into the mix.
