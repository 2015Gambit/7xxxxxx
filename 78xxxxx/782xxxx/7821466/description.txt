A classic for all mystery lovers. The Big Bow Mystery by Israel Zangwill was the first locked room murder novel. It has been almost continuously in print since 1891 and has been used as the basis for three commercial films.

ItΓÇÖs a cold and foggy night in London. A man is horribly murdered in his bedroom, the door locked and bolted on the inside. Scotland Yard is stumped. Yet the seemingly unsolvable case has, as Inspector Grodman says, ΓÇ£one sublimely simple solutionΓÇ¥ that is revealed in a final chapter full of revelations and a shocking denouement. Detective fiction afficionados will be happy to learn that all the evidence to solve the case is provided. One of the earliest ΓÇ£locked roomΓÇ¥ mystery stories, The Big Bow Mystery is also a satire of late Victorian society.
