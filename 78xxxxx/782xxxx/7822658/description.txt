Cassie Nightengale (Catherine Bell) is a raven-haired enchantress with a hint of
magic in the Hallmark Original Movie "The Good Witch".  Police Chief Jake Russel
(Chris Potter), a widowed father of two who is captivated by his new neighbor
Cassandra 'Cassie' Nightingale (Bell), who decided to move into the long-haunted
Grey House for a spell.  As if that weren't odd enough to her new neighbors, she
also opens Bell, Book, and Candle, a wondrous shop full of unique items.  For
some, including the captivated Jake, Cassie is a breath of fresh air and a love
potion that spreads through the neighborhood.  But before she can truly become
a part of her new town, she will need to win over some of the more skeptical
neighbors who don't approve of her unique ways.  Is the town's new 'witch' the
real deal, or does her vibrant personality just have the neighborhood spellbound?

I'm posting because this is a better copy than others here (deinterlaced 720x480 30FPS, unmodified audio), and I want to give back a favorite to the community, now that it's becoming hard to purchase.  Hopefully this first movie will give you a taste to seek the rest!

Help by continuing to seed, as I will stop after 10x sharing.  This is an original rip representing my first effort using video tools to convert my disk collection into media files.  This file plays fine on a WD Live Media Player and with VLC (Windows/Linux).  After several less than satisfactory attempts, I think I got it right!  (enjoy the show)
