,jakenator,2012-11-15T06:09Z,"@Smallz94: Dont be a fucking dick! Just cause someone doesnt know as much as you doesnt give you a right to treat them like shit!
@badboyno1: Sorry you had to deal with that asshole but a normal person would tell you that the reason you cant use pirated dlc content on a flashed 360 is because its not something you can burn to a disc and since your actual system firmware is modded you cant play pirated content (you need something like a RGH/JTAG)."
,tech402,2012-11-15T10:58Z,"@jakenator. you sound like a parent no offense. 

@smallz94. you are a low life gamer, i can tell. you never go out anywhere except online and your penis has never seen action and will see action 5 years from  now when your old enough to realise you need hookers in order to get pussy.

@badboyno1. you are in the internet, ignore dumb replies, stop being gay. just ask the question, if you get an answer...good, if you get sarcasm move on.

@myself. why am i commenting on this.... i need more bluemoons and less internet. fuck you"
