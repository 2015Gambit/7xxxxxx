Clean Disk Security

What is Clean Disk Security?

Clean Disk Security gives you secure file deletion, ensuring that deleted files cannot be undeleted again. Deleting a file normally just removes the file's directory entry, but the data itself remains on the disk. This program completely eliminates the contents of deleted files. The highly acclaimed Gutmann disk cleaning method is now available as an option. This program also removes the tracks of Internet browsing, cleans the Window's swap file, cleans unneeded temporary files from your hard disk, as well as files in your system's Recycle Bin, and can clear the "recent files" list. The included plugins clean up after all manner of applications.
