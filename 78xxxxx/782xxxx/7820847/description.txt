The Patriot in Purgatory

When Brennan becomes fascinated with
basketball and the underlying
concepts behind Phil Jackson's
philosophy of "teamwork," she calls
upon five of her best "squinterns" to
complete the task of identifying
remains that have been deemed
unidentifiable. During their
investigation, the squints uncover
the identity of a man who died as a
result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks,
which propels the team to determine
if he was a perpetrator or a victim
