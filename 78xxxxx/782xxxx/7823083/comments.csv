,iambecomedeath,2012-11-14T14:34Z,Just watch it online or on basic cable if you're just going to delete them after you dunce. Not even a paid channel show lol. I just stream shit when I'm not keeping them.. maybe you should too.
,yasunori,2012-11-15T01:18Z,"Not everyone lives in US and therefore has it in the basic cable.
Not to mention the fact that who the fuck watches television on schedule anymore.

and they don't put his show on CC like some others, otherwise who would bother dling it."
