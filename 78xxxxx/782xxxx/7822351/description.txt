Keep up the hope, folks, even if none exists. The leadership of the Republicrat party will continue to disappoint you, but by now you should know who they are, and you should no longer be disappointed. That's why it is important to get involved in the primaries and vote conservative. Do not be fooled by these Washington types who tell you that only the moderate Republicans can win.
