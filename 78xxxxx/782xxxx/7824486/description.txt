The Casket Girls' debut album Sleepwalking is the result of a collaboration between Ryan Graveface and two vocalists he ran across while walking through the streets of Savannah, Georgia, Elsa and Phaedra. Graveface had already written and recorded a batch of songs and he asked the duo to write and record vocals for them. Graveface is one of the guys behind Black Moth Super Rainbow and the music he puts together here fully embraces that bandΓÇÖs approach of super gooey vintage synth textures with an underlying spooky and unsettling vibration. The words and vocal melodies the girls came up with only help reinforce that feeling as they tell tales of ghosts and visiting graves, and generally give off an air of soothing weirdness thatΓÇÖs occasionally touched by a sense of resigned dread. Their unschooled vocals and angelic harmonies make them sound like a haunted Shangri-Las, which only makes things creepier. There is a palpable melancholy that pervades and invades each song, sneaking in around the edges of the hooky synth melodies and the catchy choruses like a dark mist.
