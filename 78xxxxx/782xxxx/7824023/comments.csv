,Richy2012,2012-11-14T12:11Z,"man this sucks bad, why are tehre so many cracks released if none work? Do people even test them? prob betetr not to even upload them til it has been tested."
,GoodGravy,2012-11-14T12:17Z,"@DFC, do you have Steam installed?, & also, did you update the DirectX at the end of install?, make sure you have updated the DirectX within the redist folder. If you don't have Steam installed, here is a solution which allows you to play without it:

,DFC-Louise,2012-11-14T12:21Z,"@gh0stnet, same as for the most other people, black screen, bo2 has stopped working.

,5meester5,2012-11-15T05:59Z,"Okay, for all of those that cannot get this to work, here is what you need to do.

1. If you haven't DL'd/Installed the game, do that first. 
2. Do not run the game after you install it. 

3. Copy the contents from this zip over to your directory in which you installed the game. 

4. Then you will need to make sure you change the DATE to 11/14/12 and you may or may not have to change the Time Zone to +8 (Hong Kong). I did just because I wanted to be sure.

5. I also took the precaution to disable my internet and went into my Firewall settings and removed all of the Call of Duty Black Ops II SP, MP, & Z. 

6. Once you do all of this, you should be able to load the game and have it be playable. 
Hope this helps all of those who are having problems!

**Also, I created a .reg file called No_Steam_Play.  Here is what it looks like:

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREValve]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREValveSteam]
""Language""=""english""
""InstallPath""=""H:\Windows 8 Programs\Steam""
""SteamPID""=dword:00000000

,Shadow416,2012-11-15T06:03Z,"before this update using the time zone difference i get ""unhandled "" some shit crap something caught or w.e

,thomas_gaberial,2012-11-15T06:06Z,"1.Install the game
2.Copy the crack to Game dir
3.Install Steam
4.Change the Time Zone to +8.00 (Beijing, Hongkong...)
5.Change the date to 14th NOV 2012
6. Create a firewall rule to block the CODBO2 SP.exe
7. Create a exception for the folder where CODBO2 istalled.
6.Right click the Single Player ICON and Run as Admin
