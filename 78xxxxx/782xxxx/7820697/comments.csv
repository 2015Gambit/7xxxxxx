,tflagger997,2012-11-13T19:24Z,"TVTeam had the same thing up an hour before this one.  Please stop spamming.  If it is already on TPB and well seeded, then posting dups is clutter and robs the OP of the credit they deserve."
,mrholmes,2012-11-13T19:31Z,"god, that main character girl. is a fucking horrible actress. im this close to just stop watching the show. its to bad too, the show would be really good if she wasnt in it. her stupid facial expressions make me want to stab my tv. who makes this show? nbc? idk they should of found a better person to play her roll. i hope she dies at some point during the show."
,mrholmes,2012-11-13T19:33Z,"tflagger997, no one fucking cares other than you. you know how many times ive seen stupid movies posted and reposted on this site? like a thousand times. shut the fuck up, no one cares."

,vidiation,2012-11-14T02:47Z,"@ mrholmes: gawd, I though maybe I was the only one who hated that chick - thanks for the validation. I actually refer to her as Wrinkle Brow during the show. Really need another Hunger Games chick for this role."
,rudeboyskunk,2012-11-14T05:52Z,"@mrholmes and vidiation--  !!!!! I've thought the same thing since episode 1.  She always looks worried or confused, delivers the most stock Hollywood lines in the worst possible way, and is the most unconvincing actress I've seen in a long time.  My dick does better impressions of a vagina."
,Metalsand,2012-11-14T13:57Z,"AHAHAHA, I've thought the same thing too.  Though, I also think that some of the dialouge is cheeeeeeeezy as fuck sometimes.  Her acting, combined with at times TERRIBLE script writing is ruining an awesome concept!  If it weren't for the first episode, I wouldn't have watched this series at all, lol."
,Aquillum,2012-11-14T16:37Z,fastest download ever :P Ty
,AviBremen,2012-11-15T05:25Z,"Thanks ETTV, as always, for an excellent upload.  I look for your work and know to trust it.

The embarrassing truth about Revolution is that it's horribly written, terribly acted, and I watch it anyway.  I love post-Apocalyptic stories, and even crap like this.  The most predictable plot lines, the silly coincidences (they walk to Chicago looking for the uncle, don't talk to anyone until they enter a bar at random, and the first person they speak to is the uncle.  Amazing.) and the ridiculous premise that something can stop chemical reactions that create electricity (we'd all be dead instantly).  But I still watch it.  And so do all of you!"
,default8,2012-11-18T07:27Z,"@AviBremen
Electricity in electronic devices is the flow of electrons, electricity in humans is a gradient potential created from different charges in ions. Neurons firing is very very different to a current in a copper wire.

In other news I'm still waiting for that girl to get scripted out... Wanna slap her so bad!"
,MyKrossini,2012-11-18T11:44Z,"@tflagger997, You must be new here. Welcome. Now shut the fuck up and learn your place. "
,rudeboyskunk,2012-11-18T14:09Z,"If you're looking for the book series that the concept of this show was stolen from, it's called ""The Change Series,"" and the first book is called ""Dies the Fire"" by S.M. Stirling.  In the books it goes even further, saying that electricity, gun powder, internal combustion, steam and explosives all no longer work.  Also, the cause is unknown, there's no stupid family protecting the way to bring the power back, no stupid girl, no stupid stock Hollywood dialogue or plots and plenty of real character development."

,default8,2012-11-20T06:27Z,Cool story safta
