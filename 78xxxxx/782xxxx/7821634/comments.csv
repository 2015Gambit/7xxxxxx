A Doll's House Story (1985) renders in music the events of a tragic revolution of a few minutes' duration. The revolution broke out overnight in the toy department of a store. There did not seem to be any rhyme or reason to it, and indeed, it erupted over a petty affair - it appears to be petty in hindsight anyway. The toys (plastic dolls, tin soldiers, bicycled regiments, intrepid civilians, undercover chimney sweeps, smart police officers, clowns, dwarfs and giants) engaged in pitched battle of unprecedented cruelty. The fragmentary reports that have come down to us allow the reconstruction of but a few aspects of those events albeit rather important ones. I have discovered, for instance, that the very first minute of the revolution claimed nine lives (among them that of a Pierrot, a Columbine and a heroic Harlequin). Within the next five minutes, six more deaths occurred, all victims of base instincts running amok. The appearance of a night watchman put a temporary stop to the events, but fighting continued with even more bitterness once the torchlight had been switched off. The streets were overrun by ambulances with their shrieking sirens, tanks firing shells and other military vehicles - and soon there was silence. The presence of mechanized troops did its work: the rebels and fighters withdrew into their homes. The dead silence was only occasionally disturbed by the fumbling of a doll, groping cautiously in the dark for its lost limbs or head. In the morning, the shop assistants, tired and sleepy after a short night's rest, were incredulously taking in the mess, looking in vain for signs of burglary or theft. Later, in the course of the morning, a tiny wind-up guillotine swung into action but nobody took any notice."
