As an 18-year-old virgin, Romain feels depressed and outcast. Following a humiliating transgression at school, his mother Claire decides that the whole family needs to be
much more open about discussing sexuality. From here, directors Pascal Arnold and Jean-Marc Barr honestly depict the sex lives of three generations of family: Romain pursues 
an adventurous classmate, his brother and sister explore new loves as young adults, his widowed grandfather sees a prostitute regularly, and Claire and her husband try to break 
their humdrum routines. Sexual Chronicles Of A French Family is a revealing look at the hidden desires of ordinary people, and how the free expression of sexuality transforms 
each of their lives in numerous ways.
