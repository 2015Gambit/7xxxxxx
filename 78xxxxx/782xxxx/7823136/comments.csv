Any chance of seeing PSN games that are PSP compatible? Been looking for Final Fantasy VI from PSN to play on my PSP for ages. 10 bucks isn't too much tho."

I can get it to launch and about half way through intro psp resets. "
,VertigoMithos,2012-11-24T01:50Z,"Can someone please help with something. Where am I supposed to put the game file? I've updated to 6.60 PRO-C and it says here to ""make sure to have and ISO folder in the root of your PSP"". I have two folders when I plug my PSP in. ""MP Root"" and ""PSP"". There is no ISO folder so I made one myself in the MP Root folder but the game doesn't show up.

The only way I can get the game file to show up at all is to make an ISO folder in the PSP>Game folder but it just says data corrupted. So can someone please tell me what to do, really want to play this game!

Thanks! :D"

You know when you plug in your psp to the computer and you click on open view files ? Well that spot right there ? Thats the root. The root isnt a folder. Try again "
