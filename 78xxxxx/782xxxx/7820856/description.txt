NOTES:

VIDEO....was given some decent vobs for this and got too say THANKS.Q on it was ok,nothing special....there was
some cam movement,light on the contrast,too colourful,had a too smooth look to it and the worse thing was these
lines going down the screen ....like watching it through a dirty window.

Audio...ok cam audio but levels were all over the place and way too powerful.

WORKDONE:

First made a script for the vobs and then dropped them into vdub,from here i rotated the video slightly and also used
the perspective filter to pull the sides and bottom left.
However due to the movement it was impossible to get it dead right,without cutting into loads of small pieces....but its
now better.
Now to tackle the lines ...i opted to add more contrast and more than normal to hide the lines and also used a HQ smoother to
blend what little was left into the video.
Also toned down the colours and slight tweaked them aswell as a few more tweaks...

Audio dropped in AA and changed all the levels and lowered the DB's alot and resaved to mp3.

Enjoy folks :)
