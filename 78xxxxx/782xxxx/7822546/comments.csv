,RaddekRaptor,2012-11-18T17:26Z,key required ?
,ngein,2012-11-18T21:57Z,"There are no cracks or activators on this torrent. This is an exact OEM copy. So, a key will be required if you don't have a Dell PC with SLIC 2.1 BIOS. You can google to find a SLIC 2.1 bios for your dell. Other brands will have to have the XRM-MS license and OEM product key to activate.

As for turning this into Home Premium, I have no idea. I can't say I've tried it."
