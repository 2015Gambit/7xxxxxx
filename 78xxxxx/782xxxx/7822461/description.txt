It was 1933 and the Great Depression was just getting started. And so was the corrupt mob boss the Goblin. When embittered, angry Peter Parker meets a spider and its life-changing bite, he may have just inherited the force to honor the phrase, "If those in power can't be trusted, it's the responsibility of the people to remove them."
