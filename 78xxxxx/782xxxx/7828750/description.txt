This album is Mastered for iTunes. With their 2012 EP That Old Feeling A Rocket to the Moon has distanced themselves even further from their slick studio pop style for more rootsy tones. ThereΓÇÖs a prevalent Hammond B3 organ grinding its way around the acoustic guitar strumming in a slightly countrified version of ΓÇ£Whole Lotta You.ΓÇ¥ The following tune ΓÇ£Going OutΓÇ¥ even includes what sounds like the twangy sounds of an old Telecaster guitar. But before you assume that Nick Santino and the guys have gone full country, listen closely ΓÇö theyΓÇÖre still the same band playing the same hard-grooving guitar pop trimmed in catchy hooks. TheyΓÇÖve merely redressed these songs in a plaid western shirt with pearl snap-buttons. ΓÇ£First KissΓÇ¥ still sounds like the softer side of A Rocket To The Moon. But with a weeping pedal steel seeping into the chorus and a Byrdsy 12-string guitar jangling through the verses, those amazing three-part harmonies now sound more like Rascal Flatts than Paramore. Anyone with an aversion to such change will dig the harder rocking closer ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre My Song.ΓÇ¥
