yes its modded..

,dunit80,2012-11-15T19:39Z,Works just fine on my console. But I'm using an RGH console and dont have to burn the games. Just play right from my hard drive. Ive told people before that they are changing games and making them harder to burn. Only guaranteed way to get them to work is get your system RGH. You can easily find people to do it for $50 or less and never burn another game again.
