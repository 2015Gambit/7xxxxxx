By the way, the real stuff is a free download anyways and is readily available at fast download speeds. Sheesh the lack of brain power amazes me. And you can get those usb drivers from a downloaded kies package or xda. Please tell me sinan, what are you trying to accomplish with this useless upload, help me understand it, please?"
