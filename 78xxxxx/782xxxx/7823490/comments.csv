,ristopalazzo,2012-11-15T08:47Z,"You're welcome everyone. I feel the same way vintage_vinyl. Too many times I've bought the same album on cd over and over (original release, remaster, deluxe edition, etc.) hoping for good sound and have been disappointed by brickwalled garbage. I wish I had A) gotten into vinyl sooner, and B) more time to rip my collection, LOL.

A Perfect Circle is on deck!"

,vintage_vinyl,2012-11-15T23:52Z,"lol well i for one definitaly appreciate it and im glad to see others following suite on the pirate bay, now that demonoid seems gone, personally i like tpb more now that more vinyl is being posted on here i really like it more but i had to find specialized works on the other sights and glad to see people are bringing those special rips here im fancying on maybe posting one or two myself once i figure on how to do more things i can rip good quality stuff from my equipment however im a little lax in the uploading and posting and like i added before you have good equipment which makes the rip excellent quality, i run good equipment myself people were amazed back in the days of cassette exchanging when i recorded from vinyl to high bias chrome or metal tape the transfers sounded great so when i transfer to cd now it sounds even better now that theres definately no quality loss with the generations, so i would either have to upload in 16/44 right thru my cd recorder and then somehow beef it to 24/96 and this is where i get confused in  the digital transfer so i may have to experiment but i have lots of great vinyl finds which are in most cases pretty rare similar to the opeth albums which are really hard to find around here infact i seen one today at a local shop and he told me opeth is very hard to get in used or new and new was $ 32.99 which was kind of expensive around these parts lol especially in this economy so you take care my friend and thank u again for posting such great quality stuff and p.s. sorry for the lonwindedness i just enjoy vinyl talk, take care.........vintage_vinyl"
