Ep 1: Deadlines, Wine, and High Design
Mary's has a hard time pleasing her client, or should we say her client's canine.

 In the season premiere, Martyn is thrown into a panic when he hears of an issue that threatens to derail the installation of Tamara Mellon's 30 million dollar Manhattan apartment. Kathryn brings her housekeeper Jacqueline to check on the progress of a stunning home in California wine country, but they spend more time drinking wine than on design. Meanwhile, Mary must navigate the personality quirks of a major Beverly Hills client who defers design decisions to her beloved dog.
