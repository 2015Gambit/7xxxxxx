One of the precious few Bill Evans records made outside of the trio "context."

Remastered for CD in 1992.....LP configuration presented here (without

Use provided .m3u for cueing BURRRN  EAC Burrrn cue file never seems to work with 

individually compressed files. It works fine with compressed disc images....

but separate .flac files makes it easier to pick favorite tracks for a playlist



Eddie Gomez: BASS

Eliot Zigmund: DRUMS
