,reyloc,2012-11-15T02:36Z,Will this install over existing win 7.?
,crisvincent,2012-11-15T05:49Z,"Does your Windows 8 torrents allow for upgrading from Windows 7 64-bit to Windows 8 64-bit? Not a clean install. I'm saying this because most torrents say ""Use the other..."""
,murphy78,2012-11-15T10:34Z,"crisvincent the x64 only versions of my torrents should be able to upgrade just fine.  The actual setup files demand that you can only install the same architecture.

The grey area is in hybrid all in one releases.  Those require a 32bit setup file and support files to install both x86 and x64 setup from boot.

With windows 7 I found a hybrid iso where someone had created another folder for the x64 setup files and modified the setup file to launch different versions based on the running OS.  At this time there is no known version of the same thing for Windows 8.  If I come across something like that, I will definitely note the difference in my release.

,aLsordon,2012-11-16T01:24Z,Can i instal this from a USB?
,murphy78,2012-11-16T15:51Z,"yes you can install this from usb.  You either use diskpart instructions found on the internet, or the usb tool I included in this torrent."

,reyloc,2012-11-18T03:17Z,"Tnx murphy78 for great download. Runs like a dream. Problem is that I can't activate, have reinstalled 4 times and still will not. I do a clean install each time. Wants a Code which I bypass. Is it because I live in N.Z. Any ideas? Win 8 install takes out the activation of M S Office Pro, but no problem just put in the disk and run Repair Installation and it is tere again."
,DS1796,2012-11-25T15:29Z,"is this compatible with the WMC activator method? The one in which you install then KMS crack and then activate with WMC key from Microsoft?
