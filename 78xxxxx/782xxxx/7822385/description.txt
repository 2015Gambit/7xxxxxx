Judging Amy follows the life of Judge Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman), a single mother who left the fast-paced city of New York to be a family court judge in Hartford, Connecticut. Amy and her daughter, Lauren (Karle Warren), live with Amy's mother, Maxine (Tyne Daly), who is never afraid to voice her opinion. Maxine is a social worker who often butts head with her boss, Sean (Timothy Omundson). Now in Hartford, Amy is able to reconnect with her family, including her brother, Peter (Marcus Giamatti) and sister-in-law Gillian (Jessica Tuck).

Based on the true-story of Amy Brenneman's mother, Judging Amy shows the struggles as well as the joys of three generations of women facing the trials and tribulations of every day life.
