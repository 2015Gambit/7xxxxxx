The record this season is 6 damaged and 1 perfect (this one)

Wow - 7th time's the charm!

With WEB-DLs of this in very short supply, LOL appears to have graciously moved
this show to ""The Good Machine"", you know - the one that can encode on the fly
from live without the buffering problems that invariably cause GPEs.

If LOL has not the machines to do all in real time, then the slower machines
should be used to record AND THEN encode from a file. Loses a whole 45 minutes.
Big Whoop ...

WEB-DLs of this ARE in short supply...they don't exist."
