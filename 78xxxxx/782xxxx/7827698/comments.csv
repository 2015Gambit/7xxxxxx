,Pi.Rat,2012-11-15T22:57Z,"Thank you much to the uploader. 

No thanks to the spongy leeches. I've been 34/kbs UP and 1.5/kbs DOWN for the past three hours. 

Sorry, I'm jumping ship on this one. "

[V],NLUPPER002,2012-11-16T05:59Z,"@Pi.Rat

Simple solution, make a IP Filter and ban everybody bad seeder ti the filter, u can place as many bad seeders in it as u wish, in my filter there already 7852 bad ip addresses.
Use  Azureus banning automatic bad seeders, and if Azureus see 2x ip in range he give a block ban from 256 addresses"

,shutupm8urborin,2012-11-17T11:14Z,"most peoples biggest most anticipated film of the year, all 1080p versions have the slowest downloads I've ever seen, seed mo fo's, stop downloading and then running off without seeding, sort it out, or else lol"
,Pi.Rat,2012-11-17T17:01Z,"@NLUPPER002: Thanks for the info. I'd never experienced a problem up until now.

Your copy fits everything I want, so I'm back on board. I'll seed for as long as possible. I'm too young to sound old here, but I'm bewildered whenever I find that all of my and others' opensource work a decade ago paved way for so many entitled brats.

,repeat123,2012-11-17T17:33Z,HATSEFLATS! Bedankt kerel.
,goodprick,2012-11-18T04:12Z,"wow, so damn slow to download"
,plagasx,2012-11-18T06:31Z,If I only have the DTS audio one how do I convert to AC3????? please help.
,Pi.Rat,2012-11-19T01:14Z,"My DL rate was an average of 600 kb/s during my second download attempt. Props to the seeders.

Quality is stellar. 10/10. We've all been eager for this, so give it up to NLUPPER002. Also, if you still crave the bat afterward, check out ""The Dark Knight Returns part 1."" It's adapted from a Frank Miller series. Good shiznit.

@plagasx: There's a lot of freeware that'll do the job. I personally use Avidemux. Easy, breezy. "
,AJcrash,2012-11-27T23:43Z,Thanks.
