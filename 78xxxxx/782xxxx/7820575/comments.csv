,dinesha,2012-11-17T12:55Z,"Thanks a lot..

Is there anyway to  transfer the ""saved destinations"" from the previous version (ver 11.2.5) to the current one..

Thanks again.. will seed for long time"
,kanchudeep,2012-11-17T13:39Z,"@dinesha - Greetings,
By ""saved destinations"" do you mean ""Favourites"" or do you mean ""Saved PIOs""? Method varies for the two...

For ""Favourites"" copy the old file ""AuraResdbitems.db"" to the folder ""SygicResdb"".

For ""POIs"" copy the content of the old folder ""AuraMapsrupi"" to the new folder ""SygicMapsrupi"".

Anything else, please do let me know...

@5thElementGR, @rickric & @dinesha, you are all welcome!
Enjoy & please keep seeding..."
,kanchudeep,2012-11-17T13:40Z,"@dinesha - Oops! Text came out incorrectly...

For ""Favourites"" copy the old file ""\Aura\Res\db\items.db"" to the folder ""\Sygic\Res\db"".

For ""POIs"" copy the content of the old folder ""\Aura\Maps\rupi"" to the new folder ""\Sygic\Maps\rupi"".

Anything else, please do let me know..."
,dinesha,2012-11-17T17:20Z,"^^^^ Thanks a lot..
wanted to copy favourites ."
,dinesha,2012-11-17T17:45Z,"^^^^Thanks a lot
older version has item.dat in db folder, is it the same..
 No 'rupi' file/folder in the map folder in ver 11.2.5"
,kanchudeep,2012-11-17T18:23Z,"@dinesha - Hmm... Sorry, the file extension is .dat... But filename is ""items"" not ""item""... So ""items.dat"" not ""items.db""... Rest, if you have/had not saved/exported custom PIOs, there will be no ""\Aura\Maps\rupi"" folder, so don't worry on that account...

Enjoy & please seed!!!"
,dinesha,2012-11-17T18:25Z,"^^^Ok, installed as instructed .. works perfectly..

I copied the item.dat file.. this copied my ""favourites"" and the ""History"".. "
,dinesha,2012-11-17T18:29Z,"^^^^yes... ""items.dat"" not 'item.dat"""
