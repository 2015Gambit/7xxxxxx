EVA is quite simply the most full featured Siri-like virtual assistant for Android. Please try the free Intern version first if you have not tried EVA before.

Let's face it, there are plenty of wannabe Siri clones out there. If you are looking for an electronic friend to chat with then please go with one of them. On the other hand if you want a real virtual assistant that has useful functions that will make your life easier then please give EVA a try.

EVA has all the functions you'd expect your assistant to perform plus some that you probably never new were possible. Here is a list of some of the functions that you wont find in most of the competition:
Γÿà Home Automation with INSTEON. Turn on the lights and appliances, open the garage door and a whole lot more, all with voice commands or scheduled or based on your location.
Γÿà Location based reminders. Remind you to do something based on your location.
Γÿà Location based actions. Perform any function that EVA can do based on your current location. Have EVA automatically text your wife when you leave the office.
Γÿà Time based actions. Perform any function that EVA can do on a set day and time
Γÿà In car mode including wake up phrase
