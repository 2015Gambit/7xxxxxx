Witchblade: Demon Reborn #3 (of 4)
The Demon has been given a leave from hell. He's been using his limited time on earth to create a bloody trap for Sara Pezzini. Now, as the Demon's time runs out, the trap is sprung. Victims of the Witchblade's justice, long since vanquished to hell, return, intent on destroying Sara and dragging her soul back to the pits with them. Sara and the Witchblade must fight for themselves, and for a purely innocent soul: Sara's young daughter, Hope. 

Witchblade: Demon Reborn #4 (of 4)
The Demon finally has Sara Pezzini and the Witchblade where he wants them: in the pits of hell. To get back home to her family, Sara must fight through a legion of the Witchblade's victims. She must also finally defeat the Demon himself. The Demon is just as motivated. At stake is a place in the hierarchy of hell's bureaucracy, vs. an eternity of perpetual torment. All-out, hellish action in the final chapter in this twisted tale of revenge and redemption.
