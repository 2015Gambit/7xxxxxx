The version and source of this movie is new latest release version or still old source release version."

Made my BF's day giving this to him to watch. The quality is much better than the others I've tried so far. Audio is in perfect sync, and no hissing."
,CapPanda,2012-11-14T18:36Z,Thanks.  Best we're gonna see until someone can rip the DVD I think.
