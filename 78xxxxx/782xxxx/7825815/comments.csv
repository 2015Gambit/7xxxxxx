,marko8,2012-11-14T20:43Z,thanks
,missworld,2012-11-14T21:42Z,"Not good enough uploader.. Remember it's 2012 and we have HD. It's not 1988 with VCR's and Scart leads 

A/V/6/5"
,teabag87,2012-11-14T23:17Z,looks like a R5 to me 
,topeak,2012-11-15T01:02Z,"Garbage4All is more like it. 
A-4
V-4
M-10

This is an shoddy R5, not a proper DVDRip. Great movie, so skip this nonsense and wait for a decent release. "
,iamchrislechat,2012-11-15T09:46Z,"if you want to see what this movie could have been but wasn't  go get yourself a copy of timecrimes http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4829219/Timecrimes.English.DVDRip.XviD-TFE., a 2007 spanish movie that more accurately deals with paradoxes 

if you want to get your mind thoroughly fucked go get yourself a copy of primer http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5540120/Primer.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-DoNE a movie so complicated you can watch it a hundred times and still not understand what happened which was also made for about .1% of loopers advertizing budget

this is just an overrated generic pile of crap and what is wrong with hollywood these days"
,arildus,2012-11-15T13:59Z,Thanx:)
,muckymucks,2012-11-15T14:22Z,"This is not a DVDrip, then?"
,frkzoid,2012-11-15T21:20Z,"Thanks scene. To all the fucking whiners out there, check the description! Don't expect HD when it simply wasn't stated. The quality is good enough. A/V 8/10."
,YardBoy,2012-11-16T02:17Z,"I'm throwing the BS flag.  Don't be misled by a bunch of naysayers.  I skipped thru this on my netbook and things looked/sounded great, e.g. A9/V9.  Onto the Vizio next.

Thanks 5.08X."
,Juraviel,2012-11-16T02:29Z,"Yeah this IS the dvdrip quality and it's actually OK. If you watch it on a netbook, tablet or a small monitor you will have nice experience. Long awaited indeed :)"
,TBDarko,2012-11-16T03:34Z,@ missworld. Obviously this is as good as it gets for the moment until retail DVD and Bluray. If you don't like it then don't download it. Don't lecture the person who took his time to upload it so that you could download it for free you fucking idiot.
,jzenman23,2012-11-16T07:34Z,iamchrislechat knows what he's talking about. Two of the best - by far - time travel movies are Timecrimes and Primer. 
,hisazul,2012-11-16T09:56Z,"If you want blue ray quality why dont u fucking redneck inbred lab rats go fucking buy one then open your bitch ass jew ass after that? No too fucking retarded for that one? Stfu do us all a favor and blow your fucking brains out. Remove yourself from gene pool and save humanity.
To the rest its very much watchable. for measly 700mb quality is fine. Movie is nothing special though."
,aa1234779,2012-11-17T00:56Z,"haven't come across a highly rated bruce willis flick in a while.. I'll wait for a better quality rip..

thanks a lot"
,dawnofretaliation,2012-11-17T09:47Z,"Good picture quality, but low sound for me?"
,geoalmighty,2012-11-17T19:01Z,Ty scene ))
,H6imdall,2012-11-17T20:36Z,Thx a lot
,lubbydub,2012-11-17T21:54Z,"V=9
A=9
M=9

There's a lot of fuckin haters here but this is a good DVD rip definitely worth a download!

And no its not a Blu-ray quality and nowhere does it say that!!

Thanks uploader!!"
,pzxzxz,2012-11-18T03:32Z,"this is fine, it's listed as dvd rip, not hd or blueray.  a little grainy, but not bad.
v-8 a-9 "
,marvzki,2012-11-18T12:28Z,tnx uploader
,trixi50,2012-11-19T16:45Z,With all due respect....I find most of the movies uploaded have very very very poor sound.  Why is that?  The series sound is fantastic.  Why can't the movie quality be the same? It's become so bad that I hesitate to download a flick.  I realise it's all for free and blah blah blah....but series is fine.  Just saying.
,f20cs13,2012-11-20T03:27Z,"To all of those complaining about free shit. Fucking kill yourself. The fucking nerve you parasites have to criticize anything free is beyond me. IF your not happy, then please continue to funnel jew Hollywood at $11 a movie ticket. If not, then shut your fucking pie hole and enjoy your free movie. You fuckin leeches make me sick. "
,mernastr,2012-11-21T03:34Z,"it was a pretty fast download but unfortunately has an embedded link to subtitles and that of course goes to a survey.  i'm trying to see it without the embedded link--it doesn't seem to disappear on it's own-- VERY ANNOYING link and so far no luck. so i can't comment on the film; i find the angry,hateful rants in comments distasteful, to put it mildly."
,mernastr,2012-11-21T03:48Z,"i used Media Player Classic  MPC-HC and was able to tweak it and get rid of the annoying embeded subtitle link and get a perfect synch link to work...took too much time though and I'll have to watch this another time...I know, I know, too much info....This player is really great and is a free download."
,oak415,2012-11-21T06:34Z,"A-4  Audio cuts in and out. Really hard to hear. Nearly impossible to watch w/o subtitles
V-7"
,Aladarion,2012-11-21T14:34Z,The audio is sometime very low. It cuts in and out. But the video is good for DvDrip. The movie is great. Definetely worth it
,xMajesticMeteorx,2012-11-22T02:31Z,"This is what happens when Hollywood gay dudes and lesbian bitches are allowed to rule in decision making processes about what gets to see the light of day.

So sad :-(  what a waste..."
,CarlZeiss,2012-11-28T00:55Z,"@iamchrislechat - Primer and Timecrimes were good, but they weren't perfect either.  This movie isn't generic, it's actually very original.  Or, are you just one of those people who wants everyone to know you watched a couple of obscure indie movies?  Why not just say, ""I watched Primer and Timescrimes""?"
