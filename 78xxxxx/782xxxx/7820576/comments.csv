,ileeba78,2012-11-13T18:51Z,"This is what you shold do:

1. First of all you sholud install patch 1.42.130 here is the link: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7779883/Sims_3_Seasons_CRACKED_and_Patch_1.42.13

2.Install patch

3. After sucessful instal of patch extract Sims 3 Seasons. You sholud get 4 folders. Go to _install and run setup.exe

4. Use this key: 3Q9Z-J8UM-EMME-6XAA-VK83 and istall the game (dont istall EA Origin)

5. Now copy the crack files you have downloaded with 1.42.140 patch
Paste the crack in x:/Program files/electronic arts/the sims 3/game/bin

6. Now from extracted game copy remaining 3 folders (Game,Game Data,Tumbnails) to x:/program files/electronic arts/the sims 3 seasons

7. Open the Game/Bin folder in sims 3 seasons and rename from .ex_ to .exe

Your game should be running :D

If you get this: the serial have been used to maximum user
Do this trick:

 Go to program Files and find the Sims 3 seasons folder. Go to 'Game' then 'Bin' and click on the 'Default.ini' file. Scroll down a bit till you see : [Version] Change the 'Game version' to 16.0.136.019002. 8. PLAY! Have fun

You have to go to your Electronic Arts folder, then to the seasons one. Click ""game"", then ""bin"", and you'll see a file called ""default"". Click on it, and change the game version to 16.0.136.019001.
You can't just save it because it will say access denied. So you save it to your desktop and then copy it to the bin folder. It should let you do it then. Unfortunately, my game still isn't working. It got rid of the message, but it keeps crashing when it loads up a save file or when I try to start a new game. Can someone help me with this?"

This is what you should do:

1. First of all you should install patch 1.42.130 here is the link: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7779883/Sims_3_Seasons_CRACKED_and_Patch_1.42.13

2.Install patch 1.42.13+Crack (Paste the Crack in the Sims 3 BASE GAME #The Sims 3 #Game #Bin)
do not paste the patch crack in the Sims 3 seasons folder.

3. then use this torrent limited edition installer to Install Sims 3 Seasons. You should get 4 folders. Go to _install and run setup.exe

4. Use this keys:
3Q9Z-J8UM-EMME-6XAA-VK83
5PGY-F2LQ-GLEZ-RGS7-FTQH
C5S2-FGPR-CST9-ZQLS-BV6Z
XTMD-DH6S-ZD28-6NV4-86VP

and install the game (don't install EA Origin)

5. Now from remaining 3 folders, Paste the files inside the folder of (Game,Game Data,Thumbnails) to where did you install the Seasons.
Example:/program files/electronic arts/the Sims 3 seasons

7. Open the Game/Bin folder in Sims 3 seasons and rename from .ex_ to .exe

Your game should be running. if its not , then follow this FIX from IDIOTEFFECTS.

------TO GET RID OF THE LIMITED DOWNLOAD PROBLEM--------

Press the Windows key and search for regedit

Expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

Expand SOFTWARE. (Wow6432Node for 64-bit systems).

Expand Electronic Arts. (FIND IT MANUALLY!)

Expand Sims.

,AI,2012-11-14T22:28Z,"I managed to fix that stupid 0x0175dcbb problem, unfortunately it involved reinstalling the base game, and downloading ANOTHER version of Sims seasons, because frankly, this one sucked (for me)

I downloaded another version of Seasons and it's better because it's an iso, so you just mount it, and it doesn't involve any registry bullshit or editing.  Just google for it."
,k09876,2012-11-14T22:34Z,"No game disk found! Insert Sims3 Seasons disk...
How do I do this?? There's no .iso file :S"
,llara25,2012-11-14T22:40Z,"I'm confuse do I paste the things in game,game data, and thumbnails in the 
electronic arts--the sims 3 seasons--game
or the base game folder?"
,sigajnr,2012-11-14T22:52Z,"@flawlesssierra u have to download the patch http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7779883/Sims_3_Seasons_CRACKED_and_Patch_1.42.13

follow the instructions from @dhod4ever, works for me, probably will works for u 2"
,flawlesssierra,2012-11-14T23:39Z,"okay, so it let me install the game, and now I too am a bit confused with where I paste things. When I click on the simslauncher it says ""unable to start game"", so some files must be out of place, right?"
,yan_lex,2012-11-14T23:48Z,"IT WORKED FINE TILL NOW!!!! What you guys need to do:

EVERYTHING DHOD4EVER WROTE. It worked fine! Don't know if the game is stable... Let's see. "
,flawlesssierra,2012-11-14T23:56Z,"yes, I am having the exact same problem as ajeter"
,kelseyminnesota,2012-11-15T01:04Z,"""no game disc found"" FIXED you need to download Nraas 's no disc mod.

when you download the mod put it in your mods packages folder.
should work, worked for me.
your welcome :)"
,kelseyminnesota,2012-11-15T01:05Z,"oh almost forgot! the mod can be found here

http://nraas.wikispaces.com/NoCD+Phase+One"
,zaroba,2012-11-15T02:17Z,"a nocd mod?  lol

Just keep the iso mounted, problem solved.
It's worked for every expansion so far."
,zaroba,2012-11-15T02:18Z,"sorry, was looking at the wrong torrent."
,mirta000,2012-11-15T02:30Z,"Followed the instructions, installed the crack, used Ccleaner to clean the registry, changed the default.ini document in The Sims 3 Seasons and still getting Service Initialization Failed. Help? :("
,tatian74,2012-11-15T10:30Z,"I've done everything that was said here, used NRaas Mod and crack from this site, and it is stll doen't work! Error 0x0175dcbb. What else shuld I do? Help, please..."
,eimixas,2012-11-15T14:08Z,dosent work
,Aristaqis,2012-11-15T14:49Z,For those with BlackBox Sims 3: If you have already installed Sims 3 Supernatural: just follow dhod4ever instructions(all of it) and it will work just fine.
,tatian74,2012-11-15T14:51Z,"Well, it does work at last!!! I understood my mistake, so my advice is: if you have already cracked game (before Seasons), don't use any cracks. Just install the game and use nraas mod. That's all. "
,Wolverineeee,2012-11-16T06:27Z,I installed Seasons correctly but I have a ton of missing content when I try and play the game.  The new traits aren't showing up and every time I try to participate in the festival my sims freeze and I have to reset them.  I'm going to try reloaded and see if that version helps.
