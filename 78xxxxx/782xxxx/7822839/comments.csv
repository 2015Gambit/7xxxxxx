,teranomad,2012-11-23T13:17Z,Hy guys this torrent info  says that it has only single player mode .  I think they are some issues with other copies where in the Multiplayer mode was ripped and as a result the game stops working at the third or fourth mission due to some common multiplayer map being missing . any idea if this game has that same problem ?
,teranomad,2012-11-23T13:18Z,ps it sounds like Musiqmusiq is experiencing  the problem i mentioned . Reply
