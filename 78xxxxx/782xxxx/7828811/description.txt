G. W. Bridge and two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents land on Muir Island, intending to recruit Kitty Pryde 

for a single mission: computers aboard the Helicarrier have become unresponsive, but they 

indicate that Kitty is the only user they can recognize.
   
Despite Pete Wisdom's wishes, Kitty agrees to aid S.H.I.E.L.D. as an intern agent.  Dum-Dum Dugan 

and Countess Valentina brief Kitty on the situation, and she set to work, partnered with AI 

specialist intern Rigby Fallon.  Before they get very far, Ogun reveals himself as the entity 

behind the out of control computers; his recent possession of Lady Deathstrike has taught him how 

to infect circuitry.

Ogun then causes the Helicarrier to drift dangerously through Manhattan, and, imitating Kitty, 

phones Wolverine to come to her aid, and into his trap.
