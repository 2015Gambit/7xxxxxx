In the great British comedy series Blackadder, Tony Robinson was the dim-witted Baldrick, who always had a "cunning plan" to escape any dire situation. Performing before a live audience, Robinson careens through the story of his life and the course of history, sharing hilarious tales, family stories, and anecdotes that champion the little guy. "Tony Robinson is a god of history"--Eddie Izzard.



----------
Tony Robinson's Cunning Night Out! is the uproariously funny DVD of a stand-up comedy performance by British television actor Tony Robinson, perhaps best known for his role of Baldrick in the hilarious British sitcom "Black Adder", and his infamous refrain, "I have a cunning plan!" Tony Robinson gives the snigger-inducing scoop on everything from the secrets hidden within common surnames (many last names indicate that our ancestors worked horrible jobs, such as "Kellogg", which can be traced back to hog butchering), to the creation of the "Maid Marian" television show (ostensibly a children's program but so popular that one college closed its bar when "Maid Marian" aired), to when Robinson worked with John Wayne and was literally pushed into a river of liquid filth as part of the shoot. Fans of "Black Adder" will not be disappointed; he gives plenty of hysterical anecdotes from the series, including one particularly raunchy "Black Adder" joke that never aired (because the actress was too mortified and refused to say the line)! Truly a laugh-out-loud viewing experience, seasoned with just a dash of history for personal enrichment, highly recommended for comedy lovers everywhere and a "must-have" for "Black Adder" fans
