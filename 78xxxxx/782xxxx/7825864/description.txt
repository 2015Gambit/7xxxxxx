Notorious Nora Sutherlin is famous for her delicious works of erotica, each one more popular with readers than the last. But her latest manuscript is differentΓÇömore serious, more personalΓÇöand she's sure it'll be her breakout book...if it ever sees the light of day.

Zachary Easton holds Nora's fate in his well-manicured hands. The demanding British editor agrees to handle the book on one condition: he wants complete control. Nora must rewrite the entire novel to his exacting standardsΓÇöin six weeksΓÇöor it's no deal.

Nora's grueling writing sessions with Zach are drainingΓÇªand shockingly arousing. And a dangerous former lover has her wondering which is more torturousΓÇöstaying away from him...or returning to his bed?

Nora thought she knew everything about being pushed to your limits. But in a world where passion is pain, nothing is ever that simple.
