,gyld91,2012-11-19T14:22Z,"I'm new at this, so a few quick question.

Would this game work on an unchanged xbox 360 slim running the latest update?

Would I be able to play it online without having to worry about being kicked off xbox live?

Finally, could you post a step by step of what I would need to do to play the game?

Thanks."
