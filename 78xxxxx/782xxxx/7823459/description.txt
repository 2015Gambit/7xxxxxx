Hello world, first upload in a while.... hope some of you folks enjoy some of these rarities!

What we have here is a 240p h.264 encode of a VHS tape from 1986 of a Disney Channel Free Preview weekend for cable subscribers. (whew!)

The programs include: 

--Winnie the Pooh and A Day For Eeyore (animated) 
--Donald Duck Presents (featuring old Disney shorts) 
--a block of DTV (Disney cartoons recut as music videos) 
--an episode each of Dumbo's Circus and Welcome to Pooh Corner, two live-action series whose visual style was created by the man who brought the world Teddy Ruxpin, Ken Forsse. 
--Two episodes of the 1950s Mickey Mouse Club in glorious black and white, --The 1981 theatrical short subject "Once Upon A Mouse," described as a "whirlwind tour of the legacy of Walt Disney." Of note is a particularly excellent segment highlighting Disney villains! (I've seen no rip of this as far as I can tell anywhere else, so we can possibly assume this is an exclusive)


Also included, although not part of the Disney Channel Free Preview, is an NBC prime-time special from 1986 called "Disney's DTV Romancin'" which is a mixture of Disney cartoons and 80s music with a romanric theme. 

Original promos and commercials are included as separate files for the Disney Channel segments, and are interspersed throughout the Romancin' file. 

The files are numbered in the sequence that they appeared on the tape. 

Hope you all enjoy, and seed it up, as I don't always have a reliable connection. Let's keep this one alive!
