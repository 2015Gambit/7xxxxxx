,maf08d,2012-11-14T06:54Z,Awesome! I bow to you sir. On a side note I am super happy they released Rush. It gives me hope for other amazing classic rock like Pink Floyd The Doors and GNR among others.
,jetepones,2012-11-14T07:55Z,i could gift the emp the last two songs if i see him on tomorrow i gifted three already but i want the completed torrent so i'll see if he still needs them by the time im on and id like to thank everyone who threw down the cash for the dlc up to this point
