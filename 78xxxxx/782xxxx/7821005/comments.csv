m6=12 for the effects and effort, -6 for the hack script.

pity; it looks great and the basic story had potential, but the dialogue is disappointingly juvenile, and i ended up turning it off mid-finale. if not for the animation it wouldn't rate, but overall it was probably better than what was on TV."
