IDM UltraSentry

Securely protect and encrypt files and folders. Securely delete sensitive data.
Announcing the new, re-imagined UltraSentry 13.

Digital safety and identity theft are serious risks for anyone using a computer to store data. UltraSentry secures that data by locking and encrypting your most sensitive files and folders for maximum protection, and then securely deleting any old or unwanted data so that it is physically and forensically unrecoverable.

For years, UltraSentry has been the ultimate file/folder military-grade secure deletion tool. UltraSentry 13 is a re-imagined personal security application designed to provide a complete solution for your data security. UltraSentry 13 includes the same powerful secure deletion functionality as previous versions while adding new features and functionality to secure your most sensitive digital information!

New in UltraSentry 13: Lock and secure your files with the digital Locker:

Secure any file or folder by simply moving it to UltraSentry's digital locker. UltraSentry makes it easy to protect your data. Drag and drop any file/folder to your digital locker, and let UltraSentry protect it for you. After you close your digital locker, your data is password-protected and encrypted.

The digital locker works by using a password you specify to encrypt files/folders in a secure location. No one can access the data without your password. Adding files and folders to the digital locker is as easy as dragging and dropping them from UltraSentry's explorer window, or dragging and dropping them from Windows explorer into the digital locker from the Explorer context menu or with the all-new Drop Center.

Better in UltraSentry 13: Securely delete files and folders with the file shredder:

Delete files and folders to the point where they are unrecoverable. As you probably already know, simply deleting a file from your hard drive doesn't actually remove the file's data from your hard drive. UltraSentry's military-grade digital file shredder removes the deleted file's data by wiping the disk and over-writing the original data a number of times to make it unrecoverable, even by the leading digital forensic tools. The new file shredder in UltraSentry 13 makes secure deletion of files painless and hassle-free. You can also shred files directly from the Windows explorer context menu or with the all-new Drop Center.
