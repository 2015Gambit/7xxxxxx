Will be seeding anyway. Thanks!"
,BC_BATMAN,2012-11-15T03:50Z,"Pletar, that would defeat the purpose of trying to have the Marvel Now titles in their own torrent if you allow other non Marvel Now titles in. "
,FriendlySpidey,2012-11-15T05:15Z,"Sweet thanks. I was curious, if they're relaunching all these characters why is red she-hulk, which s on #59 a part of Marvel Now! Not saying it isn't, I was just ondering what the reasoning is behind it."
,BC_BATMAN,2012-11-15T07:14Z,"FriendlySpidey, I believe Hulk ended on issue #57 and they decided to use the numbering as continuation and start Red She-Hulk on #58 as a Marvel Now ""relaunch"".  "
,Doc_T,2012-11-15T09:03Z,Thank you!  This is much appreciated.
,STFmaryville,2012-11-15T23:37Z,"That is true BC_BATMAN, and Indestructible Hulk #1 comes out November 21st, along with Captain America (volume 7) #1"
,FriendlySpidey,2012-11-16T05:08Z,Thanks for the info guys!
