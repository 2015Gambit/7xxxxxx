As usual if I have missed something, or this torrent is not seeded after two hours, please let me know.  I am always looking for people who want to learn scanning and want a place outside of a group to show their work.  If you have comics you have scanned, or audio books you have made, or books you have scanned, please email me and I will work with you to get them out into the public.
