is taken for granted by her family. She is       
ridiculed for her poor English by her husband    
Satish and teenage daughter. Shashi is the       
object of potshots by Satish, who has little     
respect for her real talent and Sapna, her 7th   
grade daughter who is ashamed to even introduce  
her mother to her school folks and teachers      
because her English is weak. However, her young  
son Sagar loves her as she is.
