The f@ck it is! It's Russian over the original English soundtrack, it's like a piece of shit mixed with cream.
You should put your info in order, preferable to put Russian dubbed in title. ""Luckily"" it's swesub... I think Swedish people learn English from kindergarten, so I presume they would prefer the original English audio... Speaking of the audio part, I'm confused: how can someone rip a blu-ray at 6GB, and encode audio AC-3 @384KB/s? Lame..."

,shane3900,2012-11-20T14:49Z,if you want to get rid of russian soundtrack. try tsMuxer. you can download here on piratebay. is a very simple program to use.

It's called dubbing (search it on Wikipedia if you're interested) and it's generally intended for children. I don't have a problem with this neither; the only thing that I asked is to provide the right info..."
