i didn't like this game at all. but anyway, maybe there is someone who likes it. it's a repack I hate repacks but I couldn't get full. it works i have tested it. if you are asked to install or update the famous PhysX System Software, you only have to install the setup given in here; "PhysX-9.12.0613-SystemSoftware" an it will work perfect. oh, and this game doesn't support any gamepad, so don't waste your time trying with xinput or things like that because it won't work. the game was developed of that tway for pc.
