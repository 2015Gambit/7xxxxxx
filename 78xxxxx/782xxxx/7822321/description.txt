Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Today on the Tuesday, November 13 worldwide transmission of the Alex Jones Show, government insider Steve Pieczenik will blow the lid off what he says is the truth behind the tragedy in Benghazi and the General Petraeus mega-scandal, then Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, will break down ObamaΓÇÖs plan to eradicate the Second Amendment in his second term. 

Alex also covers the latest control freak craziness on the part of the EPA as it moves to imposes its bureaucratic will on San Diegans who dare wash their cars with government permission.
