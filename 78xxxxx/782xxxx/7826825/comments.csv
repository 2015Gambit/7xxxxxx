,BoonesFerry,2012-11-15T06:37Z,@NightWrath your ignorance is showing. 
,5arda,2012-11-15T21:50Z,Music is just ridiculously 2 loud
,greenwheel,2012-11-15T23:52Z,"thanks dib. 

@NightWrath you're about as smart as a bag of hammers aren't ya? This is a high res 720p encode that's why they're bigger. Its for people who like quality video. If you don't like big files and quality video then get the standard definition release. It'll be the one that DOESN'T say ""720p"" on the file name."

V: 9
A: 4"
