An expertly photographed film from the Czech New Wave that received a Special Achievement Award at the Locarno IFF. The story takes place in the early 18th century when a priest arrives in a small town to investigate the rumors that a miller's family, who survived a house burning, are in league with the devil.

Yes, as THE NEW YORK TIMES review says, "the subject matter is familiar to anyone who has seen The Seventh Seal, Day of Wrath or Mother Joan of the Angels", but the excellent cast and superior camera work are reasons enough to see this film. There are several dolly or tracking shots that are eye-opening: the repeated shot where the camera seems to fly from the hill above the mill down to the mill's front door, and the scene where the camera follows Martina as she runs to the mill to warn of the coming inquisitor, just to name two examples.

The score by Zdenek Liska is excellent. With custom English subtitles prepared for KG by Kostej and MENiSCUS.

Set in the 18h century when the Inquistion was still in force. A small town is one day visited by a priest who is there on a secret mission. He is a member of the Inquisition sent to investigate the activities of a local miller. The miller and his son are the descendants of an old family whose ancestral home burned down a century ago, but was rebuilt from scratch. The miller inherited much of his knowledge about the land, water, and a building's stability from generations of family experience. His reputation for finding water and predicting when a structure might collapse have come to the attention of the Inquisition -surely he must be in league with the Devil. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide

One of the earliest films of the Czech New Wave with typically ingenious music by Zdenek Liska, great camera and other elements typical for the CNW.
