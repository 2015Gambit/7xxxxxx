,Tanis138,2012-11-19T14:20Z,"@qwertatious Go f..k yourself, man. I'm thankful for dwjp90 for his uploads. The point of my post is that maybe dwjp90 encoded stereo sound by mistake (not intentionally). So, I noted it in my comment.
The name of this upload is ""Adventure Time - 5x01 - Finn the Human 720p 5.1Ac3"", but the content is stereo. That's all. No offense."
,dwjp90,2012-11-20T02:00Z,"Thanks Tanis138,

I'll reupload in 5.1 when i get a chance, turns out my box was set to output in stereo -_-"
