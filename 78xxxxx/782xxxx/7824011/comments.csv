,Okie2012,2012-11-17T01:05Z,"Something is not right here...

Downloaded 2 times now and files don't save to computer properly and actually stick the empty folder to my desktop.  This torrent is doing bad things on my computer...

Once is a fluke but doing the same shit both times???   

I thought it might be a file naming issue but no go,  I cant even get these empty torrents to delete from the command line...WTF "
,Okie2012,2012-11-17T01:08Z,"P>S   Much love for the Blue Skull and if it is just my dumb ass computer keep up the good work Hero.

I have never seen a torrent do what this thing is doing..."
,Okie2012,2012-11-17T01:15Z,"Comment keeps getting deleted???

Something is not right with this torrent is all i'm saying.

NO Spam,  No watch this movie here BS just a longtime User who actually set up an account just to comment on the weird things this torrent is doing"
,freeegatee,2012-11-17T16:13Z,Thanks a great deal.
,inxs_inxs,2012-11-18T02:50Z,"@blajas ""The system cannot find the path specified i always get that when i try to download it"".... I think your torrent application is set to unavailable folder for downloading, therefore, check your download folder in the torrent preferences and change it to a folder that exists in your system."
,Zytho,2012-11-20T09:04Z,Not fake. Watching now.
