During the last days of the Civil War motorcycles are introduced as fighting machines. Two drifters, Len and Coby, on the run and being pursued by a sheriff, steal an army motorcycle and a side car equipped with a machine gun. This contraption is also desired by criminals Ward and El Supremo. The Army recovers the motorcycle and imprisons Coby. Len disguises himself as an army officer and helps Coby escape and they steal the motorcycle once again. The duo is pursued by the army along with a sheriff, Ward, El Supremo and a crazy spinster named Miss Peabody. This 'Trinity' rip-off stars look-a-likes Michael Coby (Antonio Cantafora) and Paul Smith.

Picture quality is poor, but it's a classic.

If you like Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill you'll know what I mean.

The movie is missing a few seconds at the beginning.

First showed in Sweden as "Slå'n på käften" in 1975.
