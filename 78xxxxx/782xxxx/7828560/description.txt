Derren Brown (born 27 February 1971) is an English illusionist, mentalist, hypnotist,
painter, writer, and sceptic. He is known for his appearances in television specials,
stage productions, and British television series such as Trick of the Mind and Trick
or Treat. Since the first broadcast of his show Derren Brown: Mind Control in 2000,
Brown has become increasingly well known for his "mind-reading" act. He has written
books for magicians as well as the general public. His caricature artwork has received
gallery exhibition and is available in a single volume documenting his portrait
collection

"Derren Brown: Apocalypse" is a two-part special that aired on Friday 26 October 2012
and concluded on Friday 2 November 2012. It centred around one man named Steven, who
had been described as suffering from a 'lazy sense of entitlement'. In a trailer for
the show, he said he was "lazy" and "irresponsible", while his mother said that
sometimes she felt like he didn't love her anymore.

The show was supposedly an opportunity to give Steven a second chance at life and making
him realise how important his life really is. The setup was that a meteor shower hitting
Earth had caused the end of the world. Steven supposedly woke up two weeks after the
disaster in an abandoned military hospital to find that he is one of a group of survivors
now living in a zombie wasteland. He made his way through a carefully planned storyline.
