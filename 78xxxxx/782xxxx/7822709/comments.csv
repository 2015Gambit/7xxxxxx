THIS IS WATERMARKED every 10-15min for about 30secs with bright pink letters
saying ""Encoded by VYTO"", then some other shit--repeated throughout the movie. 

Hey VYTO: go suck your mom's dick. No one wants releases that are watermarked."
[V],varuttee,2012-11-17T12:20Z,"There are no watermarks. This noob michaelrwatson doesn't know the difference between a Watermark and Subtitle.  Encoded by VYTO, is from the subtitle, only comes at the end. Poor fella got crazy, coz he got banged up from behind :P"
