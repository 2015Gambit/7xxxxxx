,hiyoelbrian,2012-11-14T02:09Z,Also you should install the files located in the redist directory in the location you installed the game. After that set your time to +8 Beijing) and play. Worked for me so I hope it works for you.

,pojas,2012-11-15T22:51Z,"People who have problem to play the game, but after that the game crashes, I found the problem, anda the problem is about the file ""kernel32.dll""
Because that file don´t let the game roll... -.-
And I haven´t got the solution for the problem... but many people form other sites say to format the hard drive and install the operating system again ... = S

I´m not shure, but I think this is the problem!"

This crack really works !! 

You need also this torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7828581/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_II_SKIDROW_100__Working_Instruction

from myself I can suggest that you must install steam again even if you already have it ! Do it on the same partition where you installed the game."
