Rls Notes

Synergetic Records is proud to announce another
release in combination with Spanish producer
Lupin.

After finalizing his remix album on Synergetic
Records, Lupin started directly to gather
unreleased and exclusive tracks from nowadays
most powerful and interesting progressive trance
acts worldwide to compile his new compilation.

The result is just awesome as you can see by its
tracklisting, holding tracks by Liquid Soul,
Suntree, Zyce and Flegma, Hi Profile, Suduaya,
Elegy, Aviron and Eniak as well as Lupin himself.

So check the demos and you will see this high
quality progressive selection!
