For those who love 70s and 80s music these "GIRLS" have got to be on your list of favs. The Jones Girls had such hits as YOU GONNA MAKE ME LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE,  WHO CAN I RUN TO (remade by Xscape and I think EnVogue), DANCE TURNED INTO ROMANCE, NIGHTS OVER EGYPT, I JUST LOVE THE MAN and GET AS MUCH LOVE AS YOU CAN. These are just a few of the hits these "GIRLS" have laid down in their time. I was and still am a fan of the Jones Girls and hope you are too.
