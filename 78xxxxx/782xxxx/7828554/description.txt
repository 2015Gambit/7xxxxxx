This is an ORIGINAL copy of Window 8 Pro that I purchased DIRECTLY from Microsoft's website. All the other copies seem to be with UK English with everything spelled "wrong". For example, "color settings" will be "Colour Settings". 

After weeks of frustration searching torrent sites to find a legitimate copy I decided to just pay the $39.99 and buy it so I could share the one true copy with everyone through the interwebs.


When I installed this copy of Windows 8 it was the 64-bit version. You can try installing it with less than 8GB of RAM maybe it will detect that and install the 32-bit version. I'm not sure about that though. 


1. Burn ISO image to a DVD disc using Imageburn or other software
2. Install as per instructions

OR

1. Create a bootable USB Drive
2. Download "Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool" DIRECTLY from Microsoft
 (http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool)

3. Install and follow the instructions to create a bootable USB Drive

 


Check your BIOS so to select the proper "Boot Device Priority" so the USB drive is #1

 If that doesn't work check the BIOS "Boot Order" and select your USB Storage Device as the First Hard Drive to boot from.


**It might ask you for a Product Key during Installation, this is because this is a legitimate copy of windows 8. Try to leave it blank and continue...

**I had a pirated copy of windows 7 when I went to the Microsoft site to upgrade, the upgrade adviser did not check whether or not I had a legit copy, so feel free to pay the $39.99 for a key, and that's until January 31st 2013, then the price goes up.
