It will install as 64-bit

It is United States English

It is probably the only legitimate copy of Windows 8 on the entire internet (yes it's sad isn't it even though it's been out for weeks)

Plz tell me I want it..."
,john6425,2012-11-15T16:37Z,"@ abhaykv.13 

I don't for sure if it can install as 32-bit version, when the upgrade adviser downloaded this it didn't ask which version I wanted, I believe it auto detects your hardware (processor) to see if it supports the 64-bit instruction set, based on that and RAM it might choose which version to download and install. 

For example, it didn't even ask me during installation which version I wanted to install, so as soon as the install finished I went and checked ""System information"" and it was the 64-bit version. 

If someone could try to install this on a non-supported processor and see if it installs at 32 bit then please let us know!"

Notice that it put ""wrong"" in quations, it's an acceptable spelling, but you would certainly be ""Wrong"" to spell Colour, Tyre, or Metre like this

In fact, the above words are underlined by my browsers spell-check, that's why you have to define what ""English"" you're talking about. 

Besides, our way is better and no one in the US wants to have everything in windows spelled ""wrong"" while they're using it. But you bloody brits take offense to everything..."

There is no such thing as ""upgrade only"" file, when you install the ISO file you can choose to Upgrade or do a Fresh installation from the same ISO file, it's up to you. 

You can try it on the mac or with VMware and let us know."

,tonarpos,2012-11-16T11:41Z,"john6425, thanks for your reply. The reason your browser spell checker underlines the ""correct"" spelling of the words you mentioned is probably because it is set to English-United States. That you think your way is better again proves the point i made in my previous post about your arrogance. It is also ""wrong"" to spell offence with an s (i don't think were talking about one of the sports you yanks play that nobody else in the world gives a shit about). Did i say i was British ? i don't think so, i'm just defending the greatest language in the world spoken by about 3 billion people."

You guys are so used to seeing the pirated/cracked versions that you don't know what the real size of the file is suppose to be. Which is another reason why I just paid the $39.99 and bought it because I don't trust any of the versions that are out so far, it seems to me they are all tinkered with

Is this build 9200? I have no idea, but in this copy when you go to the desktop it does not have the ""Build 9200"" branded on the lower right corner of the screen as in all the other versions I've installed. I've got a pirated version that I still have running on another machine and it says ""build 9200"" when I go to the desktop. "

,a7maah,2012-11-20T01:52Z,"it's the best method to install it without a Product Key

1. Create a bootable USB flash drive to install Windows 8.

Navigate to :Sources

Save a file called ei.cfg in that folder with the following text:

[EditionID]
Core
[Channel]
Retail
[VL]
0
If you want to install the Pro edition, replace Core with Professional. If you want the setup to ask which edition you want install without entering the product key, leave the [EditionID] blank.

You can also set [VL] (Volume Licensing) to 1 (for true) and [Channel] to OEM/Retail

Now install as normal and the Windows 8 setup won't ask for the product key. This will work for every copy of Windows 8 that you can get from anywhere.

Also, if you ever to want to enter the product key, you can do so from the Windows Activation window or using the slui 3 command."

Tell that to Microsoft, it was downloaded directly from them to my desktop when I made my $39.99 purchase. 

This is a retail legitimate copy so maybe that's why the MD5 doesn't match, the other versions around the net have been tampered with or are the dev preview versions, or in most cases the UK English version. 

I couldn't find a legitimate copy I could trust, so I took one for the team and just paid for it and shared with all of you. "

I'm sure it's 64-bit, it's the first thing I checked after I installed under system settings. It doesn't mean that it won't install as 32-bit if you have a processor that doesn't support 64-bit (someone leave a comment about this if you find out)

After installation hover your mouse over the top right of the screen then search ""System"" under settings and you will see all your info including whether you are running at 64-bit version."
