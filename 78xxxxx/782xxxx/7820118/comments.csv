,BamaBoysFan,2012-11-13T19:38Z,I hate to bother you.. but why does it just stop at 98.1% and the d/l rate drops to .4?

,Reaper1218,2012-11-13T22:03Z,"@grga93, Sorry About That. I'll Upload A Better Torrent."
,BamaBoysFan,2012-11-13T23:52Z,"thanks Reaper!! I'll be checking back!!
question.. what exactly does ""seeding"" mean anyway?"
,Reaper1218,2012-11-14T00:41Z,"@BamaBoysFan, Seeding Means When You Finish Downloading A Torrent And Leave It On Utorrent Or What Have You. It Says Seeding After It Downloads. Hope That Helps"
,ergjam,2012-11-25T08:03Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! Only gives 98%
