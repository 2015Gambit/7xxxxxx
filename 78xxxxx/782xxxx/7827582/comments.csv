He doesn't have fucking anything - he's using a five year old Dell and a DSL piggyback phone line while sitting in a metal folding chair in his grandmother's basement.  Fucking piece of shit liar is all he is. LMAO. Fiber optic connection my ass.  LOL Pole-smoker wannabe loser. 
,Lordvicius,2012-11-17T05:33Z,thanks extremezone...nice movie...but batman needs TIM BURTON.
,Achiro,2012-11-17T05:43Z,I don't seed either because everyone who comments on this site has proven to be gigantic underage faggots with the same drooling mind capacity as those blithering retards that comment on youtube videos.

Best copy so far. file size is a bit large although the film is almost 3 hours in length. video is clear but slightly dark, pulses a bit in a few scenes, aspect ratio changes, and audio goes out of synch slightly in the last parts of the film.
great film, although my least favorite of the trilogy; catwoman's character and the ending are a tad weak."
,vlcboy,2012-11-17T11:50Z,"Completely agree with 'zerothdegree'! In parts it's quite jittery, the audio goes about half a second out of sync in the last 30mins and the ratio is constantly changing throughout the film."
,I_dogg,2012-11-17T12:55Z,"worst batmanmovie ever, dont waste ur time, this movie is a fucking joke."

 yeap mate .. perfect description of the torrent "
,statzakia,2012-11-17T14:28Z,Awsome  rip thanks
,Soto928,2012-11-17T18:11Z,"Decent enough rip. 95% of the quality is fine, but occasionally playback will stutter and you'll see a noticeable frame rate drop if it doesn't freeze completely. Thought it might be a codec error but even after re-encoding it still had same jitter issues and audio sync issues, so it is the file itself. Tried playback on multiple media players and still had same issue."
,darki699,2012-11-17T19:19Z,"The slowest download I've ever experienced, averaging at 5 kb/s !!!!

,hazza86,2012-11-17T20:57Z,"the ratio constantly changes because those are the imax shots...

,Granchy,2012-11-26T01:22Z,"I had major audio syncing issues with this.  I switched between VLC and WMP, and both programs showed the same issue.  Once I got about 2 hours into the movie, just about every minute of the remainder was out of sync in the most annoying way.
