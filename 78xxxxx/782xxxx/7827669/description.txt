Get Zaucy! IDW is proud to announce this special collaboration with 2000 AD and Rebellion Publishing, The Zaucer of Zilk, Brendan McCarthy & Al Ewing's phantasmagorical psychedelic extravaganza from beyond the fringes of imagination! This special 2-issue adventure features an inter-dimensional magician who travels across the realms to save his number-one fan from the dank clutches of arch-nemesis Errol Raine, as visualized by the brilliantly surreal artist McCarthy!
