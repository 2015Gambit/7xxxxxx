,KirbyisKing007,2012-11-15T01:50Z,Wow! Thanks for this in the correct reading order! Been waiting a while for this. Great post! Will be hopefully awaiting the follow up stories in such a good torrent like this one. Thank you again!
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-15T02:21Z,"# KirbyisKing2007:  when i was creating THIS torrent, i pondered creating one which encompasses the ENTIRE knightsaga.  thanx for the prodding, and i will hopefully have everything ready by next week.  same bat time... same bat channel..."
,KirbyisKing007,2012-11-15T06:35Z,This torrent in and of itself is AWESOME! Thank you again! Even with nothing else this is fantastic. I'm not even sure what would come next... There's Knightsquest and Knightsend but I'm not positive. Even better is the correct reading order. What an awesome torrent. Great job man
,DragoMaster009,2012-11-15T15:39Z,"Many thanks for all of your torrent collections, how do you find so many of these issues?  By the way, will you be doing any of the Aftermath issues from the listing shown here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightfall)?"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-15T21:35Z,"@ dragomaster009:  i'm glad u appreciate my efforts, and thanx for the comment;  thepiratebay has given me years of reading material et al entertainment, and some great sware, too; the torrents i create r just my humble way of trying to return the favor.

even now, i am using ur wiki website suggestion to create my knightSAGA torrent.  (i am at the troika point, atm.) stay tuned..."
