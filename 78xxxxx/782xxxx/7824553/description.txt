Forcefield II - The Talisman (1988)

Cozy Powell & Ray Fenwick studio only project, features the tremendous Tony Martin on vocals, one of the best voices in this genre.
Neil Murray of Whitesnake play bass.
The cover of Deep Purple's "Black Night/Strange Kind of Woman" is pretty nice.
Really Good traditional Hard Rock.
Highly Recommend album.
