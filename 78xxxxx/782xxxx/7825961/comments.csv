,nivea55,2012-11-15T05:02Z,"Serial instructions not working.  Fails 3 times and auto-terminates the installation.  PROPER with crack, or at least a true serial?"
,nivea55,2012-11-15T05:10Z,Using google-fu I have found the serial in the original copy of the FLT .nfo is not actually a bunch of X's.  The correct serial listed on their .nfo is (1885-3870-6836-8679) and it works.  Just fyi...

,qasmi,2012-11-15T12:42Z,"After installing the game when i play the game i got an error (crc check failed try reinstalling the application)i reinstalled it but again the same error what should i do

,WTFRUDoing,2012-11-15T13:46Z,Thanks for the working serial nevea55!
,funkymonkey501,2012-11-15T13:55Z,"Same, get CRC check failed.  FYI, if you have the original Panzer Corps installed, this game uses the same registry structure, so it copy over the registry files for the original game, meaning the original game will no longer work."
,funkymonkey501,2012-11-15T14:05Z,"Ok, I got it working.  Here's how:
1.  Uninstall your original Panzer Corps if you had it installed like I did.
2.  Uninstall Panzer Corps Afrika Corps if you already installed it.
3.  Reinstall Panzer Corp Afrika Korps using 1885-3870-6836-8679 as the serial.

If you leave the original Panzer Corps installed, the registry files for the two games will get mixed and neither game will work."
,funkymonkey501,2012-11-15T14:07Z,"If you have the original Panzer Corps already installed, then installing Afrika Korps will render both games unusable.

Fix the problem by uninstalling the original game, and reinstalling Afrika Korps using serial 1885-3870-6836-8679.

I did that and verified the registry was correct.  Game starts and runs fine now."
