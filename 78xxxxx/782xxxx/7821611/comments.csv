[V],Nepotu,2012-11-14T00:47Z,"I'll try to find that game.
@ofpirate: It was specified!"
,ofpirate,2012-11-14T01:20Z,"okay, so you posted moto2 twice.. will the motogp be forthcoming? (please)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-14T01:49Z,"Yes, because the ripper has posted in the same torrent another version of the race, in 720p. So, like it was specified, this torrent has qualifying sesion in 720p, the race in 1080i and the same race in 720p. 
MotoGP - very soon."
