This book on internal combustion engines brings out few chapters on the research activities through the wide range of current engine issues.

The first section groups combustion-related papers including all research areas from fuel delivery to exhaust emission phenomena.
The second one deals with various problems on engine design, modeling, manufacturing, control and testing. Such structure should improve legibility of the book and helps to integrate all singular chapters as a logical whole.
