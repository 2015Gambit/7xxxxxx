,hairyitalian4u,2012-11-14T17:57Z,"Good Morning MsFenmore!  I love your HD videos of the soap operas and seed when I can do so!  :-)  Do you get the soaps from CBS.com?  If so, can you provide me a link as to the software you use to extract the videos from the site?  Thank you very much for what you do!  Happy Thanksgiving and retirement of Stephanie on The Bold and Beautiful! "
