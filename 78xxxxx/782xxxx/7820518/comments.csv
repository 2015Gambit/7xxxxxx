,gangross,2012-11-15T03:25Z,i am sure im not the first to ask. but is there anyway you can get a hold of moto 4 
,HapyM3al,2012-11-17T10:25Z,on his twitter account he said he wont be uploading Moto4 because he would like them to keep making it. buy off itunes for $14. 
,slicknick0610,2012-11-22T02:09Z,I don't have Moto 4 is another reason. I was a little disappointed when I bought Moto 3.

Did anyone happen to get episode 2?"
