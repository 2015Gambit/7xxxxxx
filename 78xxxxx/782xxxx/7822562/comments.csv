though i guess since it has line audio, it's not technically a cam, rather a telesync as labeled.

THANK YOU!

A - 9
V - 9

sadly, thought the best part of the movie was the trippy intro. i've seen more complex plots in one of my own bowel movements. Casino Royale is still the BEST Bond movie ever made. "
,jeisurii,2012-11-16T04:30Z,Amazing quality. If only 007.Skyfall.2012.720p.TELESYNC.x264-iLG would get a wider public release. Or if someone would release the 1080i italian source they mentioned.
