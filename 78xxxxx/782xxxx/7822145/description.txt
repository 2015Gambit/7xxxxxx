======================================================================

This is not my rip but it has been CDDA validated with AudioChecker, screenshot and log are included.

I've also included the track "Is Your Love Strong Enough?", in FLAC, from the Dragon Tattoo soundtrack because I know how hard that album is hard to find in FLAC ;)
