,cmryan821,2012-11-13T22:42Z,Thanks for this episode and all the others you've uploaded.
,DarkLives,2012-11-15T07:39Z,Do you think you could upload the entire season 2 in one file? I know its alot to ask but it'd be greatly appreciated
,jamesgw,2012-11-18T08:34Z,"This should be episode 26 instead of 25.  I think we got off track around episode 15 which should have been ""Powerless"", but instead was named ""Assualt on 42."""
