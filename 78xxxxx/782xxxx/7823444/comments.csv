,Nomadzx,2012-11-14T12:42Z,Thank you murphy78 ;)
,jezuz_christ,2012-11-14T19:12Z,So what all needs to be done so this is legit and doesn't bitch to be activated?
,murphy78,2012-11-14T21:54Z,"not a thing, windows loader is installed automatically."
,RockNRobin,2012-11-15T03:26Z,"this worked great, accept I did need an activator which I found on here, as the dell key didn't work, but it booted just great and I'm a happy camper now. Thanks for the upload"
,algi49,2012-11-15T07:15Z,"Many thanks murphy78 - I did a clean install resulting with a genuine activation - 

I will come back and look for your futures releases

As an aside, will this issue work as an ""upgrade"" on an existing Win7 (SP1) ultimate system running with the WAT removal tool uninstalled?

Once again, many thanks for your hard work & take care"
,murphy78,2012-11-15T10:39Z,"algi I'm not sure if you can upgrade win7sp1 to win7sp1.  Removewat sounds good in theory until you realize that microsoft incorporates WAT in some of their software.  They require WAT for downloading certain things from their websites, which hilariously windows loader fools perfectly.  They also require WAT for upgrading service packs.  So if you removewat on this, you won't be able to install sp2.  There's really no reason to use removewat over windows loader.. Windows loader is much better.

,murphy78,2012-11-17T22:20Z,"Guys the windows loader 2.1.7 is giving some newer torrent clients some sort of virus alert, but it's not infected.  The loader is just on a virus list because it is a hacktool.  If you are concerned, feel free not to use this; but please note that it is just a false positive.  A virus is something that copies itself and spreads.  A hacktool is just a crack for operating systems.

Anyway, just giving info before people become alarmed if they're using newer torrent clients.  I'll release a new version of this in like a week or so with no windows loader for people that don't trust windows loader or prefer removewat.

Thanks Again."
,ElFlaco-77,2012-11-19T02:03Z,Oops! My bad. Just saw your other x64 torrent. My apologies.
,mew7946510,2012-11-23T10:07Z,Is the installation process the same as a clean installer?
