SKIDROW GAMES

The game has been promoted with a live-action trailer by Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows director Guy Ritchie, and starring Robert Downey Junior. One of the game's lead roles is voiced by Avatar star Sam Worthington.

But Anthony says that games can do things that films simply canΓÇÖt. 

The new Black Ops is the first Call of Duty game with ΓÇÿbranchingΓÇÖ storylines - ie where the player can change how the game ends.

"Have you ever watched an action film, and really invested in a character, and then he gets killed, and thought, 'I wish he hadn't died?' We have branching storylines - so you can actually reverse the situation. You can save them, or let them die.ΓÇ¥
