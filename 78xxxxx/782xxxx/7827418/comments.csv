Download and run MeGUI --> click on the 'One-click' button --> click on the 'Config' button --> click on the 'Encoding setup' tab --> click on the 'Don't encode video' check-box and then select the 'Audio Codec' of your choice (AC3 or AAC) and make sure below it it says 'encode audio: always' --> click on the 'Config' button and choose audio bitrate and channels and then OK everything. Audio encoding wouldn't take more than five minutes. Enjoy!"

,Coldblackice,2012-11-16T03:37Z,"How's the quality?

What's the bitrate?

Does this do well with dark scenes, action scenes, and motion? I heard that there might be issues with this one in that regard, like choppiness. But it might have been referring to a different 1080p torrent."
,Luck107,2012-11-16T03:47Z,"@Coldblackice I think ""choppiness"" depends on your Computer's hardware. If you have a decent GPU (and a video player that is optimized to handle HD content) you should be able to run this with no problems."

,skunky99,2012-11-16T05:32Z,"It looks great.  The aspect ratio kept changing, but I found out it's because different scenes are filmed with an Imax camera."
,Coldblackice,2012-11-16T06:41Z,"@Luck107 Sounds great, thanks. I have a good card, so it should be alright. I was just wondering if the choppiness was from a poor encoding. Good to know otherwise.

@skunky99 Awesome, thanks for the heads up. And ya, the aspect ratio changes are expected. There are actually a couple torrents where the original ripper didn't understand this, and thus, the resulting rip hat the IMAX scenes stripped of picture and zoomed in."

,Shlomir,2012-11-27T10:15Z,"POOR VIDEO QUALITY~!! Took 2 days to download, compression artefacts, sawtooth, jagged graphic, sound quality 10, but video poor for a 1080p rip. Watch the opening scene, aeroplanes look like Atari 2600 graphics!"

,t_amante,2012-11-30T03:18Z,"If you're not sure about getting this, do yourself a favor and GET IT NOW. This is as good as a rip can get. It felt alive in a 50"" new plasma Samsung. Watching this on a laptop is like paying 200 dollars to a hooker just to touch her breasts. If you're not going to watch this on a big TV, go get the shitty YIFY version."
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-30T12:45Z,"Finished. Looks great.. I reckon its an early official release rip someone has in the industry. lol. thanks. I don't see this as internal or cam rip. If it is, wow claps to you.

,b52u571,2012-12-01T09:47Z,"how is this torrent different from https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7836859/The.Dark.Knight.Rises.2012.1080p.BluRay.DTS.x264-PublicHD

why is there a size diff when its same res and dts?"
,3htthe,2012-12-01T10:13Z,"@b52u571

Maybe different rip settings? It's not only resolution and audio that make up all the size, there's more detailed recording settings."
,lif3isfr33,2012-12-01T13:54Z,"@b52u571 

does anyone read these days? if you go to the 16.92 GB file that one has directors commentary (2nd audio choice.) This one, ""alliance"" version is just the movie no commentary. So the extra 4 GB of space is going towards commentary. Not worth it for me. If anything, I would get the IMAX instead. "
,haenen3006,2012-12-01T14:44Z,"What a great movie, loved every minute of it. Too bad it is the last one. Bruce Wayne, Batman... You won't be forgotten.
A:10 What great music by Zimmer
V:10 Really 1080p!
M:100 Just amazing.

Thank you."
