Hey guys. here is a batch file I slapped together quick 
to make the timezone auto change for the game start-up, 
then change back again 20 seconds later. 
this works perfectly. 

just put the START.BAT file in yer black ops 2 game folder.
then run it!, it will handle everything automatically.
no having to change anything.

I have a few different versions depending on what timezone
you are currently in. choose the one that matches yer location.

enjoy!
