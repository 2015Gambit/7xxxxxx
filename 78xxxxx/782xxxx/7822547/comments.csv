,talon395,2012-11-14T03:32Z,Well I am surprised this will blow you away. After 2 days of trying this works 100 percent. Do not need steam either. You are the best FieroGT. Yes it works..
,mosbach,2012-11-14T03:37Z,NICE job Sir.

^ Actually fixes crack, no scripts"
,lolilove,2012-11-14T09:16Z,"Just as a note, if anyone is suspicious of .BAT files, simply open them up in Notepad by right-clicking and hitting ""Edit"" (or by opening up Notepad and manually navigating to the directory if you're paranoid like I am about somehow running it instead)."
,Se7entijz,2012-11-14T14:54Z,nope still not working for me :/
,Ismas,2012-11-14T23:25Z,works 100% for me!
,smoktup,2012-11-15T03:15Z,"This worked for me for a while, stoped playing for like 2 hours went to play again, and now it crashes with the black screen blah blah has stoped working... irritating."
,123das123,2012-11-15T05:05Z,"I installed the crack fix, started steam, used this file, and it's still crashing! What the fuck am I doing wrong!??"
,smoktup,2012-11-15T06:22Z,"Thanks FieroGT, this helps alot, it worked for a while after using this, those that still have the crash with this file then its somthing els, all this does is change ur time zone settings, it did work perfect for me, the game launched i got through several missions and just a while ago it started to crash on me again, hope skidrow reloaded or razor can figure it out and get it working aswell as zombies mode.."
,smoktup,2012-11-15T06:31Z,"ok i managed to fix it!!! anyone getting black screen, its not just the timezone!!! 
1.Install the game
2.Copy the crack to Game dir
3.Install Steam
4.Change the Time Zone to +8.00 (Beijing, Hongkong...)
5.Change the date to 14th NOV 2012
6. Create a firewall rule to block the CODBO2 SP.exe
7. Create a exception for the folder where CODBO2 istalled.
6.Right click the Single Player ICON and Run as Admin
7.Enjoy the game

basicly, change ur day to NOV 14'th and then run the bat file, this will make the game ruN!"
,123das123,2012-11-15T07:04Z,"@smoktup

 Still doesn't work!"
,smoktup,2012-11-15T08:39Z,"@123 thats odd, it worked perfectly for me.. maybe look into other solutions, but as soon as i changed my day to nov 14 it worked again for me, so dunno man"
,Djghost13,2012-11-17T16:02Z,"if it doesnt work for people you have to manually change the date to nov 13, not 14. I dont know why it makes a difference but 13 worked for me while 14 gave a black screen."
,Darkbebop,2012-11-19T01:04Z,works TY very much
