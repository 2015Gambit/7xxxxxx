,Mogwai79,2012-11-15T19:53Z,Has the resolution been scaled up from the dvd format in order to make it 720p? What's the source?

,kfirzig,2012-11-16T00:14Z,"i couln't believe it either but this is the real thing hd quality!!
comes with -russian and -english audio.
it changes the movie name to ""Petlya.vremeni"" probably the russian name."
,downloather,2012-11-16T18:28Z,"That's what it looks like when an idiot uploads something. Just look at the resolution: 720x428.

Is that 720p???

Hint: No."
,rosstitute,2012-11-17T15:00Z,"This is not HD. Mis-titled and in the wrong section. Needs to be 720p vertical resolution, not horizontal. Uploader is an idiot. "
