,ss4johnny,2012-11-15T05:14Z,Anyone else notice that the audio mix has the music overpowering the dialogue?
,Blind___Mag,2012-11-15T06:21Z,"I also noticed this, not with the ettv torrent but the eztv one. Went looking at other torrents to see if the others were the same.. Couldn't hear a lot of the conversations throughout the episode. Very Distracting."
,STAY-AT-HOME-GAMER,2012-11-15T07:12Z,thanks
,BoonesFerry,2012-11-15T07:16Z,"Yes, this one too.
Some parts of the show have background 
music playing at the same, or higher, volume as the vocal parts, which makes 
it difficult to hear what is being said.
It's not an ettv, eztv, tvteam, or scenline issue, these are torrent group names, they did not cap the show."

I am aware that eztv, ettv, tvteam ect aren't the issue I was just stating where I had gotten my torrent from."
