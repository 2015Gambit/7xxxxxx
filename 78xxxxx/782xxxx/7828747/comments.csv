,fearls101,2012-11-17T07:43Z,Just finished downloading.  Downloaded at an average of about 3.3 MB/s.  For 12GB it came in just as fast.  Have yet to watch the whole thing but  the quality looks amazing.  
,Nordentlig,2012-11-17T16:20Z,Takk.Bra kvalitet!
,captprice,2012-11-17T17:17Z,possible problem at 02:06:53... the movie stops by itself.. please confirm somebody
,Nordentlig,2012-11-17T19:12Z,@captprice Yes you're right there is a glitch there
,Nordentlig,2012-11-17T19:21Z,I use Gom player and it skips about 3 min ahead. Vlc stops.
,captprice,2012-11-17T19:37Z,@Nordentlig thanks...
,vivatpb5776,2012-11-18T11:46Z,"The audio and video qualities are excellent. However, I can confirm what Captprice and Nordentlig referenced. At 2:06:53, while playing via VLC, the movie just stops. I do not use any other programs (I will not insult the .torrent world but trying WMP)."
,vivatpb5776,2012-11-18T11:46Z,"obviously I meant ""...by trying WMP."""
,vivatpb5776,2012-11-18T13:25Z,"@spaga: .mkv files are only containers. Simply rename the file to .mp4. Then you will be able to play the video file.

FYI - VLC Player plays .mkv files with no issue."

,fearls101,2012-11-26T06:31Z,"Addition to my previous comment:

I also encountered the problem at 2:06:53

Easy fix when using VLC (If you do not have it, I highly recommend.):

After the video stops playing, Hit play again so it starts, and then hit pause

On the VLC menu bar, click ""Playback"" and then ""Jump to Specific Time""

Type in 02:06:54 and you are good to go without missing a thing.

It may seem like a hassle but the download speeds make it worth it

Thanks again for the top quality movie.

Also, this batman movie is fantastic"

I got anxious"
