What's New

The ThinApp 4.7.3 release adds support for packaging and execution of virtualized applications on Windows 8 operating system. The Windows 8 support enables cross-platform capability for many applications regardless of the operating system of capture. The cross-platform capability is an important component of supporting the latest Microsoft Windows releases for both managed and unmanaged endpoints.

New Package.ini parameter - You can use the PreventDllInjection=1 parameter to prevent ThinApp runtime from loading a DLL when another external application calls the SetWindowHook to set a global hook. This parameter should be used only when the hook is in conflict with a virtualized application. For example, if a virtualized application is unable to start because the other application NxPowerLite calls SetWindowsHook to set a global hook oehook.dll, modifying the package.ini with PreventDllInjection entry allows the virtualized application to start.
