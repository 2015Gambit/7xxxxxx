Control the machines in this Rampant Robot Factory to help one of the robots escape from the crystal mines.
The almost worked-to-death robots are too tired to move their legs so you have to use your brain and fingers to help the robots through 30 levels of dangerous saws, fires and lavapits. Select the machines you want to control and use the slider to manipulate:
The speed of the Conveyour Belts.
Fling away the robots with the Flips.
Transport the robot around and above the dangers with the Magnet and Tesla.
Required Android O/S : 2.2+
