,cancab,2012-11-15T10:28Z,It is bad same problem on ettv...who hardly ever has a bad file 
,aiigghht,2012-11-15T10:36Z,"I have to back up hhhhm's comment

The audio is shit, EZTV usually does a great job, but this is fucked, I don't even understand how you could fuck it up so much when its ripped from TV where the audio mix would have been correct in the first place.

Unusual for EZTV to release a bad rip but this is garbage. watchable but difficult to hear the dialogue in most scenes especially when the music comes in. 

Thanks anyway EZTV but sad to see you release this when you have such a good reputation."

,Sick3r,2012-11-15T22:51Z,probably ripped with 5.1 surround. no centre in 2 way so sound is terrible as fuck!
,Sinthyses,2012-11-16T10:50Z,"This isn't eztv's fault, it's CityTV, these retards don't know how to run a tv station. I've heard this happen on their station on the tv multiple times."
,JimElyria,2012-11-17T17:58Z,I don't know who's fault it is.  It's just awful watching these shows lately when you can't hear what people are saying.
,seanharm,2012-11-19T06:09Z,"Had the same problem with the most recent episode of The Middle, also uploaded by eztv."
,wazabiwatwat,2012-11-20T20:51Z,"It's bad, but listening to it in Mono makes it abit better."
,d.d.dudes.dad,2012-11-24T06:27Z,"Yeah but, the music track is really good and if you chilax, you can still hear the dialog. I was fucking with my amp 'cuz I thought I had tweaked somethin'. :-P

Love's me some Suburgatory, yo.

Malin Ackerman is so fuckin' wicked hot."
