Then if you still want djvu, convert from pdf? In either case you'd have a smaller file size than these djvu files."
,citizendonny,2012-11-13T21:46Z,how do you view these? never heard of djvu files.
,fernflitch,2012-11-13T22:10Z,@citizendonny: just google windjview and download from the sourceforge page; djvu files are similar to pdf files but generally have a much smaller file size.

,syksy,2012-11-13T23:01Z,"Besides, DjVu is specifically designed for storing scanned files, with one image per page, so it would not be a good idea to convert a .mobi or .epub to DjVu."
,fernflitch,2012-11-13T23:16Z,"@syksy: Thanks. But I'm pretty sure the 2 vol. set is still around in the usual places as epub and mobi files. And right, it wouldn't make sense to convert them to djvu. But maybe the scanned versions would be useful to people who need exact page references."
