I have an iPad with Retina display and the SD version of comics was a deal breaker for me, but now not any more, thanks to you! Can you tell me why some titles are in 1920 and others in 2048 px?! thank you very much!!!!!!!!!"

With regard to the different px widths on the HD releases: It really comes down to the scanner's preference on this.  1920 is a common monitor resolution width, and previously was one of the more common release sizes for high quality scan releases.  With the new retina displays on the ipads coming with 2048px resolution, it prompted some of the scanners to use that for their HD dimensions.  Now, certainly a 2048px release would look just as good if not better on a 1920px monitor, so I don't mean to say that one is meant for a tablet and the other a monitor.  Not that at all.  It's just that that seems to be the scanner's motivator for which dimension they go with."
