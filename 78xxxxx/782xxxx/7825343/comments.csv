,Green.Banana,2012-11-14T19:49Z,"Across more trackers, there are 1713 seeds (although many of these are probably duplicates).  Still, none of the peers have 100% of the torrent.  

Yes, I've seen G4TW's screenname on other torrents AND their website.  That just further hammers down their mistakes of using a RAR file for a torrent.  This EXPANDS the torrent size, it DOESN'T COMPRESS it, because you need to EXTRACT the files to use them.  An ISO can be run by anyone with Daemon Tools Lite, which is free for personal individual use thanks to good taste and professional honesty.  "

,hateyourightback,2012-11-14T21:47Z,"G4TW is very trustworthy, I don't trust anyone but them and extremezone when it comes to games. They know what they're doing and I'm grateful that they put up the games for download ASAP. So, instead of complaining, we should be grateful someone we can trust is always giving us games for free.

(hope my english wasnt so bad) "
,bam-bam7,2012-11-14T22:27Z,"@Beatitta not expert, but do think that problem is in laptop, maybe it is to weak for games like this. Or maybe just needs cleaning. I had the same problem, on my old laptop and didn't know how to fix it."

,Green.Banana,2012-11-14T22:35Z,"Um, you know, you really should seed.  Torrents are dependent upon file sharing, meaning that the person who provided the torrent has to distribute it and others must download it to 100% in order to share the entire thing as well.  You can see in the Peers tab in uTorrent that there are people with the torrent 100% downloaded who aren't uploading.  If you're worried about speed, then you should perhaps worry that you can run The Sims 3's expansion packs at all, because it's a real resource hog.  There are also plenty of trackers with several hundred seeds listed among them.  Really, please continue to seed.  "

,bam-bam7,2012-11-14T23:02Z,"@Beatitta hope it is just a bug. Know what you mean, I also really want to play it but no matter what I do no disc problem pops out. Hope that someone else will give you solution."

Also I don't trust Skidrow. Their upload of generations ruined my old laptop.

,Green.Banana,2012-11-14T23:39Z,"@CoolasAtorrent Actually, leaving the iso mounted won't make it think you have the CD in.  At least, doing so didn't solve this issue for the other expansion packs.  The ISO is essentially just having it compressed AND runnable at the same time, while keeping it self-contained.  A RAR has to have its data doubled in order to be accessed (which is why it's absolutely foolish for G4TW to use this archaic method and for people to complain when this fact is pointed out to them), and can become messy if people decide to move things in and out of it.  For not needing the CD, all you need is to just add in a NoCD mod, which sites like ModTheSims can easily spell out for people.  "
,CoolasAtorrent,2012-11-14T23:40Z,Lovefraz : RaR files are not better then ISOs U messed up your laptop because sims 3 is not met for a laptop And u cracked your game Thats what ruins your game If u keep the iso mounted with the virtual drives in POWERISO use automount u wont have to ever crack your game not 1 problem with updates or install if people just did it this way their would be way less problems.....

Funny, I've never had to use a no-CD mod or any crack for any of the expansions and they've all worked fine since the day Sims 3 came out (which also wasn't cracked).  Still get updates via the launcher as well.

It's nice being able to mount an ISO and not worry about anything not working."

Hope I helped!!!"
,loucaporsims,2012-11-16T05:58Z,"I have a problem help me please.
my sims 3 seasons when I play several times after appearing on ""want out of your game"" and I'll fuck ""cancel"" and he returns to repeat this several times and then me appearing on a ""checker.exe"" that says it was not possible to respond but then come back to the game and it works but repeats this several times, help me?"
,feedoesnotplay25,2012-11-16T07:00Z,"Those people who said it work obviously are lying. G4THEWORLD website is shut down. (They shut down right after they put this on piratebay) You should really delete this off your PC/Mac/Or what ever you have. These people are telling you to seed to be in your computer idiots. Those who are use to the torrent world , YOU ALWAYS RIGHT CLICK TO STOP THE SEEDING RIGHT???. Those who didnt get rid of your PC/Mac or what ever.  Seasons is the best thing that has ever happened in The Sims 3 ; hope you guys play it soon."

Sims clothes on creat-a-sim don't load and right after the game crashes"
,manouras,2012-11-16T15:04Z,for me it is working but i'm wondering why it is so small.reloaded version is biger.to make it work just install 1.42 patch with crack and then this torrent without crack and works fine
,manouras,2012-11-16T15:11Z,or just download it from extremezone!
,SXGFury,2012-11-16T15:52Z,"If you are wondering why this is smaller than reloaded one, first of all, this is a compressed .RAR file while the reloaded one is just a .ISO and .ISO files aren't compressed... hope this clear some people's mind about the size of the file!"
,TixaMukic,2012-11-16T19:31Z,FAKE
,Sajjanaryal,2012-11-17T03:06Z,works perfectly.. thanks. 
,Roshimitzu,2012-11-17T05:35Z,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! Works perfectly but so do all your torrents. Highly trusted. For those who are having the ""sims has stopped working"" error you might need to update your hacks.  I had this then realised I needed to update my overwatch package. Soon as I did that it worked perfect!! Game is also amazing possibly my fave EP!!!"
,Olivia717,2012-11-17T06:02Z,"No those of us who said the game works perfectly, said it because it does! We were smart enough to figure the shit out unlike people on here hating calling it a fake cause you're too slow to figure it out. all you have to do is ask for help. I've already left my contact info behind on an earlier post and walked 6 people thru the process in the past 2 days and it works for them as well...don't be ignorant."

They give AMAZING support! Everything I have downloaded from the works flawlessly!"
,haileighmontana,2012-11-17T07:36Z,"Alright, it's time to suck up my pride and ask for help. I had all of the Sims expansion packs and everything downloaded, but I got an error after downloading this the first time. After much research, I figured out I could only fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling everything. So, after I found a torrent that DIDN'T give me 15 Trojan horses, I did just that. The torrent I downloaded had all of the expansion packs except for this and Supernatural. After making sure that everything worked and playing the game for a bit to make sure it didn't crash, I installed this. As soon as the installation was complete, I tried opening the game. It gives me an error code that says it can't open and to reinstall the base game. This is the fourth time I'm doing that because of this error. Anyone know why this is happening? Anything would help, thanks!"
,dancingmystery,2012-11-17T11:57Z,"works great, thanks a million!"

,Lamalamalama,2012-11-19T11:13Z,"Works perfekt.
Please read the txt file!
Solve the ""CD"" Problem:
3. After the installation finished, open the ""# Crack"" folder in this .rar file and 
drag & drop (or copy) the ""TSW.exe"" and the ""TSLHost.dll"" file in there to exactly:
C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3GameBin (SO NOT THE EXPANSION'S INSTALLATION
FOLDER, BUT THE BASE GAME'S INSTALLATION FOLDER INSTEAD!!!)"
,Games4me,2012-11-19T16:49Z,Why dont Have new world ice lounge?!!
,AloeO,2012-11-20T01:16Z,Torrent works great. At first my game kept crashing after I went into the game but after I updated the overwatch mod it worked absolutely fine. Thank you for this great release
,peevedoff,2012-11-20T18:21Z,"Okay if anyone uses this one or the supernatural one after downloading the blackbox complete sims 3 fair warning it will NOT work at all if you do.

Ive tried multiple times with supernatural only for it to say it needs a disc or it doesnt work or it needs the base game reinstalled etc...

Too bad its an exercise in futility to get it to work."
,Rachouri,2012-11-21T19:38Z,"so the game is working fine, there's just one error: in the festivsal stands there is nothing on the list to buy... how to fix this?"

My girlfriend can't get enough of the Sims and didn't want to have to keep buying expansion pack after when  expansion pack (after the first 5 it seemed like a bit of a rip off seeings how there is 15). You are a saint to hard workers on a budget! Thank you so much for all your hard work please keep doing what you do.
