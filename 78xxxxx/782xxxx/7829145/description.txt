Take the ride of your life in this non-stop action winner of the 1986 Gay Producer's Association Award. Flying Sky America tonight are some of the hottest, horniest studs on both coasts. Ignore the "occupied" sign and check out the plane's lavatory. That's where the action is! 

Once you're on the ground at SFO, you'll want to tag along with Captain Joe and Steward Mel to baggage Lost and Found. Tall, handsome Leigh Erikson can be very helpful when it comes to straightening out passengers' biggest problems. He's got a drawer full of solutions! Kurt's had a long wait--keeping the homefires burning--but it's worth it once his flyboy lover finally lands in their bed. That is, until an uninvited visitor arrives at dawn and Joe is forced to put his asshole where his mouth was earlier!
