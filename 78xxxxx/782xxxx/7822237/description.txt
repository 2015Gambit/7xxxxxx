Before Coltrane became a legend he recorded recognizeable standards on albums 

formulated to sell to the general (albeit jazz-loving) public. "The sound" is

already there but none of the tunes would exceed 10 minutes in length as far as I've

noticed.  


This album was Coltrane's FIRST AS LEADER.  I love this old stuff.  Sahib Shihab's

baritone adds extra "meat" to some of these tracks. Johnnie Splawn fills out

the front line on trumpet.
