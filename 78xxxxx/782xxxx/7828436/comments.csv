,Themperror,2012-11-15T14:01Z,My mistake.. I miscounted.. There are 79 songs in this pack
,Themperror,2012-11-15T14:34Z,"Ugh.. Sorry guys.. I've made another mistake heh..

I accidentally repacked all the song with no app ID number.. (Also it's a bug I just found in the program)

Happens that if you DONT edit the number (or retype it) it will overwrite the appID numbers with a space instead of the current number..

So if they don't work.. you'll need to repack the song(s)

I'll do a proper re-upload if this also gives problems on the cracked version"
,maksstt,2012-11-15T16:16Z,"Man, I just wanted to thank you for Rocksmith's DLC uploads! U are awesome!"
,kdobbs74,2012-11-15T19:40Z,I'm seeding now.
,orff3445,2012-11-15T21:37Z,"So, if I buy Damnit by blink, then I just need to copy Content folder to the game? Anyway it is just great, that you made it to work with legit game. Cheers. "
,bc81987,2012-11-16T04:33Z,"i may have done something wrong but i seem to have everything except tighten up and mid eraser by black keys. besides that, thanks a lot for the dlc!"
,Selphiphi,2012-11-16T18:56Z,"I already downloaded the first pack of DLCs you submitted, and I've made some scores on these songs, so I would like to know : are the files which were already in previous packs named the same?

For example, if I download this torrent and then unpack all of it in my content folder, and disagree to overwrite of existent files, would it keep my data and just add the new songs?

Sorry for the silly question but this way I will know if I should download this pack or not. Anyway, thank you for the awesome work, you rock!"
,noshirtnopants,2012-11-17T00:56Z,"selphiphi your progress should be unaffected, the game progress is not stored in the individual songs."
,tein076,2012-11-17T17:25Z,"hey emperor the songs in your 61 song torrent are they in this one also right? if so should i just delete my old files, or what do you recommend? thanks for songs!"
,onurdogu,2012-11-18T05:11Z,Great collection! Thank you so much!
,ksalad,2012-11-18T16:09Z,how do you fucking unpack this? you only gave instructions for the steam version. 
,ksalad,2012-11-18T16:17Z,how do you install this? u only posted how to install on a steam version.
,kdobbs74,2012-11-18T19:44Z,"If you are running the TinyISO version just create a folder in the Rocksmith dir called ""Content"". Copy the files to the folder, run rocksmith and the song should be there.  I am using the Tinyiso version and all I had to do was make the folder, coppy the files and now I have ALL the songs."
,s1ak,2012-11-20T15:27Z,"there's no ""don't fear the reaper"" in this pack, but it was in previous 61 songs pack."
,ksalad,2012-11-20T20:08Z,"I can only see the songs on the standard crack from tinyiso, no new songs in RockSmithNoCableNew.exe ;/ how to solve this? I can't use tinyiso's .exe because it doesnt detect my guitar"
,veky12,2012-11-21T16:36Z,"Im reposting orff3445 post:

(So, if I buy Damnit by blink, then I just need to copy Content folder to the game?)

Has anyone tried this?

Themperror will this work on original steam release?

Thank you for your hard work."
,veky12,2012-11-21T18:19Z,"Disregard that, it works awesome, thank you themperror, you rock!!!"
,veky12,2012-11-21T22:22Z,You deserve a skull
,rees90,2012-11-23T12:35Z,Is there any risk of getting banned for this on Steam?
,treedude,2012-11-24T03:06Z,"I got it for legit steam :D.

Just delete 1 dlc you own, redownload then find it's app id.

Replace the rest of the songs app id with your legit copy.

It works with legit and acheivements.

For some reason the cracked version points only go up to the quadruple digits (8000, the legit version goes up to 5 digits (80000."
,shoot10,2012-11-25T22:06Z,"thx for all the dlcs, but i have two question. 
1. how many song are there, including the originals??
2. i want to learn tighten up by black keys but i can't find it anywhere any help?? 

THE BLACK KEYS - Tighten Up RS001SONG0000004.dat"
,nitrous991,2012-11-26T04:22Z,with that program would it be possible to create own songs i know it probly be a pain to create lol
,Michaelcr13,2012-11-26T05:10Z,Does this include bass charts?
,Selphiphi,2012-11-26T18:47Z,"Sorry to bother again, but Ihave a problem :/ Now my concert panel is broken, all the songs are ""undefined"", and when I try to get into the menu the game crashes..."
,Crimson.Thunder,2012-11-27T20:45Z,"This is a GREAT torrent Themperror. 

From what I can tell the only song not here is Tighten Up by The Black Keys (no big deal, really). 

I dunno if it was only me but there were a few songs that didn't show up with this torrent, so I had to use the last torrent (with 61 songs) and use those files. 

Thank you so much! I've bookmarked your uploads. :)"
,Themperror,2012-11-28T14:13Z,"I will upload a proper torrent of these songs + the new ones when I receive the new songs from the funk DLC 

a7x here is indeed missing the bass (which I will also fix next torrent) and I don't know about the missing songs.. But I will make sure ALL songs are there next time..

(also barracuda does not seem to like the app ID from damnit(if you are using legit rocksmith)) so try an other ID if it isn't found"
,m0ranwad,2012-11-29T17:36Z,"First of all, many thanks to you guys for all of your work on this game.

I have the legit version, but I have had success with your DLC (after purchasing Dammit and following the instructions). However, like you mentioned - there are a few songs that are not working (Baracuda, Tighten Up, Creep, Some Might Say).

I tried packing and unpacking these files again, and even editing the APP ID, with no success.

Perhaps I'm doing something wrong. Any ideas for those of us with the Legit game?"
,Crimson.Thunder,2012-11-29T19:08Z,"Yeah Barracuda was one of the songs I needed to get from the last torrent. You're a legend Themperror, this has saved me so much money! I was gonna buy RS and all the DLC if they joined in with the Steam sale, their loss. "
,Skairkrow,2012-11-30T16:24Z,"yeah, theres new content (DLC) for November and theres Christmas songs as well... it would bump the song list up from 83 to about 90.. if we could get them posted?"
,brasil533,2012-12-01T03:55Z,"How i install it on Cracked version? I create the ""Content"" Folder on rocksmith folder, and nothing happens, what i need to do?"
,Crimson.Thunder,2012-12-01T12:58Z,"@brasil533: It should be something like C:/Program Files/Rocksmith/Content

Then in that content folder just paste all the .dat files, open up Rocksmith and they should be there. Did you do all that correctly?"
,brasil533,2012-12-01T15:17Z,"@Crimson.Thunder: 
Hi, I managed to solve my problem.
I was using a crack NoCable Old, searched the internet and saw several people having this problem. So I downloaded a crack updated and the songs appeared to be able to play them.
100% Working
Very good!"
