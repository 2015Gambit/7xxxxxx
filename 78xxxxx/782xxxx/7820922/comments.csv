,rikairchy1,2012-11-15T02:01Z,"KMS (short for Key Management Server) is an activation method used for activating multiple Windows installations. The key is installed (its a legitimate KMS key) and activated by the server, just as if Microsoft's own activation servers had done so."

,tonycap44,2012-11-20T22:10Z,"Ok, Thanks"
,rikairchy1,2012-12-01T19:59Z,"PERMANENT ACTIVATION:

Once you activate via KMS, simply go to http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs to get Windows Media Center. After you get your key, simply go to Add Features to Windows 8. Click ""I already have my product key"" and input the key Microsoft has provided you. This REPLACES your KMS key, removing the need to activate every six months. You will have a permanent activation of Windows 8 afterwards."
