I have the steam version and the route is loading fine it appears, but when it's finished it just shows white ground and some signals and a few other things. I get no error message.
I can post a screenshot.

,IiTraxiI,2012-11-29T17:42Z,@phaids this was not intended to work with a legit copy of RailWorks but perhaps if your not getting an error message try clearing your cache from the main menu if that fails set your graphics a little lower and see if that works. If you not you will need to install a cracked version of RailWorks.

Thanks for the answer.:)"
