[T],mf-den,2012-11-19T13:23Z,"@xu9uz: Nah there are no audio problems, pls check properly. We do multiple checks in terms of quality before posting and again checked in once more for u but no such defects."
,xu9uz,2012-11-19T14:55Z,"ok ok, thanks for confirmation, i think something was wrong with my download or something. THANKS!!!"
,xu9uz,2012-11-19T14:58Z,"wow, i tried with win player, not classic, works really fine, audio came out, but when im trying to play it on classic, audio = 0
have u been experiencing this?"
[T],mf-den,2012-11-21T19:19Z,"@xu9uz: Weird, cos the first player that i tried when u told was media player classic only, works properly, tried in vlc, sm player, gom player n also in tv works properly. one suggestion - try downloading again if u can n see or try it in ur xbox or tv cos the a/v both r working fine"
