,frankiebdog0987,2012-11-19T03:11Z,"Hi kinda new to downloading these ""sims 3 store updates"" and when i download these and put em where there supposed to go. i know how to do anything but what do they do like do they give me the store items? or what"
,dhod4ever,2012-11-19T06:58Z,"@frankiebdog0987

if you are new about this stuff.. download the .sims3pack files only (installing .sims3pack takes more time).

read this for more info on how to install .package files
http://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files

also read rachel description in this torrent. by reading rachel description + the link i posted, you will understand on how this files will work and grant you complete store items."
,lordax,2012-11-19T12:34Z,Question: will this work on 1.38? Can't update to latest.
,dhod4ever,2012-11-19T13:40Z,compatible with the latest version 1.42.130 and below...
,alackey,2012-11-21T08:08Z,is this safe do download because i heard soon comacast will track bit torrent.. did they start the heavy tracking yet?? 
,alackey,2012-11-21T08:16Z,does anyone know when xfinity/comcast will start to track these downloads.. because i wanna download this but read soon xfinity will track bit torrent.
,dhod4ever,2012-11-21T10:30Z,"their efforts is useless unless the ""Internet providers"" will reveal the identity of that IP. If the ""Internet providers"" will reveal the identity of the IP owner then the ""Internet providers"" company can be take down by legel term (break of contract: Privacy). It's safe unless you are in some crappy country government CRAP LAW. XD"
,mvincent17781,2012-11-22T07:16Z,I don't believe this will work with the recent Seasons related store content patch that added snow effects to all of the store content. Can you confirm this? And if this is true is there a way you could edit these to make it work?
,dhod4ever,2012-11-22T10:12Z,"@mvincent17781

read the previous comment xD"
,kakifry,2012-11-22T13:58Z,"I installed the sims3pack through the Sims 3 launcher installer, and the game is telling me I need to purchase them to use them?"
,kakifry,2012-11-22T16:29Z,"How do we get these to appear in-game?  Using the Sims 3 loader installer doesn't work.  It says the installs were a success, but they don't actually appear in-game.  I used the sims3packs, so does the installer detect that they're not legit?  If so, is there a workaround to installing the sims3packs, and would using .package files create the same problem?

If I wanted to literally purchase the items, I would just purchase and download them from the store.  Is this torrent for people who have actually purchased them, or?"
,kakifry,2012-11-22T18:57Z,"UPDATE: I just read that decrapified files don't work!  EA updated the launcher to reject decrapified files, and double-clicking them just runs the launcher.  So to the OP: how the heck do you expect people to install these if they DON'T WORK?"
,dhod4ever,2012-11-22T19:39Z,"Rachel, thank you again... don't mind the trolls.. ;)

for those who have question, ask Rachel's kickass account. I'm tired of reading everybody's retarded opinions, so tired of this I could blow. fire in the hole! =P"
,kakifry,2012-11-23T08:02Z,"Trolling and retarded opinions?  The only retarded one is rachel.  Her torrent DOESN'T WORK.  GOOGLE IT.  DECRAPIFIED FILES DON'T WORK WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF THE GAME, MORON."
,kakifry,2012-11-23T08:09Z,She needs to address this fucking issue and quit being a moron about it and letting people get confused and wasting their time.
,kakifry,2012-11-23T09:14Z,"If you want instructions on how to actually get this stupid torrent to work, read them from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7800550/The_Sims_3_Store-October_2012_Update-admz0r_%28.sim3pack_.package%29

You'll need to download 5 ""fixer"" files from his torrent and install them to the directories that he indicates.  Also, use .sims3packs and not .packages, if you expect to get all of the game content, because some of the content requires .sims3pack format be used.  Thanks me, for answering my own questions as usual, and you're welcome.  Rachel, I appreciate your torrent tremendously - but if you hadn't uploaded these then someone else would have, and at least they probably would have included proper instructions because they'd probably be male and men are always thorough like that."
,kakifry,2012-11-24T00:12Z,"By the way, 5 of the items in this bundle are inappropriately priced for $1 (simoleon).  They are from 2 sets.

From December 2009, Happy Holidays Presents set:

Menorah Candle Holder ""lightingTableMennorah.Sims3Pack""

Kinnara Candle Holder ""lightingTableKinnara.Sims3Pack""

From January 2010, Dr Pepper Las Vegas set:

Lips of Loveseat ""loveseatVegasLips.Sims3Pack""

The Time Passé Lounge ""loveseatVegasRetro.Sims3Pack""

Lagomoprh in Neon ""sculptureWallVegasNeonSign.Sims3Pack"""
,Sunnaie,2012-11-27T01:15Z,"not sure what that kakifry person is talking about but this works perfectly fine with the game, all files accounted for in game."
,kakifry,2012-11-27T05:36Z,"You're not sure what I'm talking about?  Maybe you're all fucking retarded.

And by the way, the other 4 items of the Dec. 2009 Happy Holidays Presets are also mispriced.  Get your shit together."
,riverofsouls,2012-11-29T06:02Z,"Those store items have always been bugged, including the retail versions. Items that need to be installed via launcher would be worlds and lots. Otherwise, .packages are pretty good. 

The ""fixes"" you posted are by kissing_toast over at MATY. They are tuning fixes and do not actually include store content. KT's fixes should only be included with his consent. Besides, why include a torrent of his fixes when he updates them regularly at MATY? Don't get mad at Rachel. Rachel has already stated that TPB is buggy and won't let her comment.

Here's a link to kissing_toast's thread:

As always, thank you very much Rachel! I can't wait to get back to demonoid..."
,darquest99,2012-11-30T01:14Z,"I notice that the stuff I have downloaded so far is showing up as "".part"" files and I dont' know how to open those if that is how they will show after the whole download is complete???   (I am very familiar with installing package files)  "
