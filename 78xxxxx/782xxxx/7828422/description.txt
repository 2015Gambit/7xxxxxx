FigureBaby.com - Amber Chase in Fonz - 7 Nov 2012

This set is a sequel of sorts. A few years back Amber and I shot a set we called Happy Days. We called it that because I asked her to do a thumbs up like Fonzie, and she wasn't sure who Fonzie was, which struck me as odd. Most people in North America who are familiar with old TV shows can identify Fonzie as a character from a program called Happy Days. Turns out this once popular show is no longer prominent in our popular culture. But no one cares. Whether you know of Fonzie or not, it makes no difference when Amber Chase is showing her body. Turn off the TV and pay attention!
