"The Patriot in Purgatory"

When Brennan becomes fascinated with 
basketball and the underlying 
concepts behind Phil Jackson's 
philosophy of "teamwork," she calls 
upon five of her best "squinterns" to 
complete the task of identifying 
remains that have been deemed 
unidentifiable. During their 
investigation, the squints uncover 
the identity of a man who died as a 
result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 
which propels the team to determine 
if he was a perpetrator or a victim.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
