This hour-long documentary special looks at the woman behind those famous glasses, taking the cameras backstage as she discusses everything from her cancer diagnosis to her battle with depression. She also tells of her close relationships with fellow cast members and how she met her future husband on set, and talks us through the highs and lows of her Corrie career, including the storyline which rocked the Street almost 30 years ago when Ken discovered Deirdre's affair with Mike Baldwin. Featuring appearances from cast members past and present, including William Roache, Michelle Keegan, Chris Gascoyne and Johnny Briggs.
