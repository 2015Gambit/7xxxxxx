last 10 minutes no dialogue but there is music.
I think that is the way the film goes as there are no more subtitles either.
The story is completely told and then it's just music and sounds.
Will watch it tonight.
thank you"

don't know what you mean,the dialogue ends when the movie ends and then there are end credits with music just like any other movie."

,AacidusX,2012-11-16T07:44Z,"Legit.
Video: 8 (Expected a more crisp picture. Corrupt data on Xbox and PS3)

Audio: 7 (Can't get 5.1 to work)
When the movie starts, Bane's voice is very loud while the rest are low, after a few minutes it normalizes."
