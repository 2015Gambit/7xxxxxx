Java remains the global standard for developing various applications and enterprise software, and the launch of Java 7 brings with it exciting new capabilities for concurrent programming by way of the concurrency utilities enhancement. This allows developers to make the most of their applications with parallel task performance. ΓÇ£Java 7 Concurrency CookbookΓÇ¥ covers all elements of the Java concurrency API, providing essential recipes for taking advantage of the exciting new capabilities.

On your computer, you can listen to music while you edit a Word document and read your emails, all at once!
