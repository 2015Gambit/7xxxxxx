,Gav80K,2012-11-23T00:25Z,"Thanks for the effort you've put into this.  Unfortunately it's not worth keeping and I've deleted it and kept my original DVD rips.

The problem is it's 4:3 but you've encoded it as 16:9, meaning you've encoded two this horizontal black bars into the video.  Not only does encoding some black bars seem rather silly, it produces problems on displays that aren't 16:9.

Many people use 16:10 monitors or tablets, and on these displays the picture has to be shrunk to accommodate the vertical black bars that you've encoded as video.  This means you get horizontal borders at the top and bottom of the display that you wouldn't normally get with properly encoded 4:3.

This situation would be even worse if you were viewing on a 5:4 monitor or a 4:3 tablet.  In these cases the picture would also have to be shrunk considerably to fit on the horizontal bars you've encoded into the video.  You'd end up with a video the size of a postage stamp surrounded by massive black borders on all side.

The way you've encoded this it will only play correctly on a 16:9 display, and will look ridiculous on any other aspect ratio.

Is there any chance of doing a proper 4:3 encode?

Thanks a lot."

Didnt want to spend any more time with this mediocre series, truthfully"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-23T11:54Z,"Well i Doubt anyone playing 720p videos has a 4:3 monitor. 
16:9 has been around for years and has become the normal aspect ratio for most if not all Monitors soled and bundle with a PC.

The chances of me doing a 4:3 for this series are low. 
You can always crop it yourself:)"
