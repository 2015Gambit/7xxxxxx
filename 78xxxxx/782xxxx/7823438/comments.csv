,aakashkatoch,2012-11-14T19:30Z,activation validity???????
,murphy78,2012-11-14T21:55Z,"it installs windows loader at setupcomplete phase.  to check your activation, right click on my computer, properties."
,zero1zero,2012-11-15T06:49Z,Why did you leave out KB2685811 and KB2685813? Are those bad?
,chacrE5a,2012-11-15T09:57Z,"Hi Murphy,  Thanks for upload.   Will you be uploading a x86+x64 AIO (I mean both on same disc) like your others?  :)"
,murphy78,2012-11-15T10:48Z,"zero1zero, they are not available to download in a .cab or .msu file.  You can only download them from windows update at this time.  If I ever find them in an integration version, I will incorporate them.

chacrE5a I may, but I really wanna knock out some of my win8 language support versions for the new patch day kb files.  So many people are starting to use win8 that it's just been a little lower on priority.  We'll see.  They require a lot of TLC on integration and testing.  There is just naturally a lot more that can go wrong with an AIO, and everytime something does, I have to re-integrate and re-test everything.  It takes either a TON of rebooting and reformatting, or a really long virtual machine patience run.  I'm more of a reboot and reformat guy, mostly because I'm impatient.

cheers,
murphy78"

,shepe06,2012-11-15T21:34Z,which are the steps to instal it on a normal pc? help pls 
,kristina111,2012-11-17T04:24Z,"Murphy78,

your work is great. Can you tell me do you used Win8 or Win7 for yourself. 

I want to try it. Is this pre-activated or tell me the way I can activate it.

Great Job, "
,murphy78,2012-11-17T10:05Z,"For use, just burn the iso and pop in the dvd for upgrade, or just change boot options to boot from dvd.  The instructions from there are pretty self explanatory.

I have been using win8 lately, but with all the testing I have been doing, I haven't had much time to actually sit back and enjoy it.  At first I was annoyed at having to enter email password and lack of activation, but since I figured out that you can just install using a local account, and having saved my activations with tokens manager; I am not really bothered by win8 as much.  Now I guess I could get into the neat lil apps you can run from the metro thing for free.

I'm so used to using win7 still that it's going to be a while before I'm fully used to win8, but it's growing on me."

why your torrent has deleted From kat ph?"
,murphy78,2012-11-17T22:24Z,"Guys the windows loader 2.1.7 is giving some newer torrent clients some sort of virus alert, but it's not infected.  The loader is just on a virus list because it is a hacktool.  If you are concerned, feel free not to use this; but please note that it is just a false positive.  A virus is something that copies itself and spreads.  A hacktool is just a crack for operating systems.

Anyway, just giving info before people become alarmed if they're using newer torrent clients.  I'll release a new version of this in like a week or so with no windows loader for people that don't trust windows loader or prefer removewat.

someone on kat ph i think reported this false positive and I'm petitioning it atm.

My work is not infected, I give my word.  As a politician once said, trust but verify.  You can run a sha-1 or something on the loader in the oem directory and compare to every other windows loader 2.1.7.

,XprojectX2,2012-12-01T04:38Z,"I have used a few of your OS'S
They are great, Except : In every one that i have used i have found A BitCoin.EXE in every one ?

Now I understand why there is so many Versions.

Look in the Default user File in AppData it is there!  Every person who uses Any of his OS'S
are Bit minning for him ?
He just puts out a os every few days and people
use it - He gets Paid !"
