Phantom's Diwali Dhamaka - Sholay - Director's Cut in 1 CD

The director's cut of Sholay includes Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the Imam's son, Ahmad miyan is killed. 
The censored theatrical version was 188 minutes long, and was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years after 1975. The original, unedited cut of the film finally saw the light of day in 1990 on a British VHS release. Since then, Eros Labs has released The "director's cut" of the film in DVD preserving the full frame as shot, and is 204 minutes in length.
