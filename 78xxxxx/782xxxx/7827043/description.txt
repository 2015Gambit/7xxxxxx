"You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)"

Rayna wants to change her sound and seeks out 
the help of a highly successful music 
producer, Liam McGuinnis, Juliette goes on a 
sham date with a squeaky-clean NFL quarterback 
as a PR move for her tarnished image; 
meanwhile, Lamar's plan to delay Coleman with 
a police traffic stop on his way to an 
important photo op for both candidates works 
too well, and Scarlett's relationship with 
Avery gets rocky.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
