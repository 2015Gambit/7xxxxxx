This is a first: the first (and so far only) game played for lostbets.com where I wasn't there holding a camera. I had to drive Ashton and Mia home, so directorial duties were taken over by Prudella, my production assistant. Did she do a good job? You be the judge.

It's long red hair vs. long blonde hair in this match of Four-in-a-Row. The game itself was a weird mix of brilliant strategy and blind stupidity on the part of the players... you'll see what I mean. The forfeit? The loser drizzles all over the winner's feet, then has to lick it off.
