The Weather Underground explores the unbelievable story of the Weathermen, the notorious group of 70 s radicals who, outraged by the Vietnam War and racism in America, went underground to wage a low-level war against the U.S. government, bombing targets across the country that they felt symbolized the real violence.
From pitched battles with police on ChicagoΓÇÖs city streets, to bombing the U.S. Capitol building, to breaking acid-guru Timothy Leary out of prison, this carefully organized clandestine network attempted to incite a national revolution, while successfully evading one of the largest FBI manhunts in history.
One of the top documentaries, this award-winning film interweaves extensive archival material with modern-day interviews to explore the incredible story of The Weather Underground.
As former members reflect candidly about the idealistic passion that drove them to bring the war home, they paint a compelling portrait of troubled and revolutionary times, with unexpected and often striking connections to the current world situation.
