but it is sad to say that I find the audio too bad in Eastern Promises 1080p (66.4?)
A 96kbps would be legit for such low size files, just like YIFY. I'm not comparing just a lil sugegstion

,mbzyz,2012-11-14T19:59Z,"your video bitrate is too low for any discernible quality improvement over 720p. keep in mind that 1080p has more than twice as many pixels as 720p.  

i personally wouldn't go below 2200 Kbps for 1080p. also minimum bitrate for 48kHz stereo AAC should be 128 Kbps."

Love your work, Man. Keep it up. Works great for me. I guess he is watching it on the TV in Cowboys Stadium.

I have a question. Will you be getting a rip of The Dark Knight Rises early like you did with The Amazing Spider-Man?"
,Phenom100,2012-11-15T01:28Z,"@Zen_Bud"" lol.. that was funny, but Zen 96kbps aac would do, the rest all the video and everything is uber cool. please consider this. I'm not an encoder but I leave the choice with you.

http://i.imgur.com/f3E7g.jpg but mind clarifying abt what is this max bitrate thing?, I don't know what it its.. I see it present for every VBR movie rip 720p/1080p, any enocder's rip. What does it mean?
Btw thanks for Sting 1080p :) Loved it and Apocalypse Now Redux 1080p

,mbzyz,2012-11-16T08:02Z,"so which looks better?

anoxmous 1080p @ 1697Kbps:

kingdom 720p @ 1976Kbps:

1080p resolution is meaningless if you don't have adequate bitrate.  granted, kingdom's file is 400MB larger (mostly due to higher bitrate for 6-channel audio), but i'll take kingdom's sharp 720p with surround sound over anoXmous' blurry 1080p with tinny crackly audio any day.  "

,[qusawa],2012-11-16T18:36Z,@mbzyz You made a mistake because confused images  LoL
,tnyp,2012-11-18T20:20Z,"I like how when mbzyz provides proof of why these rips are of lesser quality than Kingdom's and tells you what you can do to make them better, you call him a troll."
,[qusawa],2012-11-19T02:27Z,"tnyp -have you SEEING him taking those screens?

NO so why do you believe what you read on internet?

And yes he is trolling, he post the same shit on many torrent !

This is my proof that you must be a moron to !"
