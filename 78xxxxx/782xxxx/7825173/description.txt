remove all previous installations of Microsoft office

remove all previous kms activations or cracks etc

install Microsoft office 2013 (retail or volume) 

add registry key suitable for your system

run "0-0-KMSmicro-normal.cmd" and it should open up a big window called "qemu"

once the screen gives you options, enter the letter "t" to set the time

once finished enter "13" to enter Microsoft office 2013

while the screen is blank, go back to the folder and run (as admin) "office 2013 activate.bat" (if running 64-bit)

it should say product activation successful

wait for qemu to finish then enter the letter "s" to shutdown

open Microsoft office 2013 and it should be activated, if not just try again

enjoy & seed! :)
