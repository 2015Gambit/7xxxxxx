,fpr8653,2012-11-17T12:08Z,"sorry guys, ive been informed this works for retail but for some reason only activates volume (VL) editions, no biggy just search TPB for a volume (VL) edition & problem sorted, make sure to keep seeding to keep this torrent alive for others! :)"
,sun2lookus,2012-11-21T17:42Z,"this KMS activator works great for Office 2013 (pro plus, project pro, visio pro) VL version, no matter you run under win 7 or win 8 pro.

Please read the instruction carefully.

Note: you must connect to the internet to use this activator (especially to synchronize with internet time)."

Thanks from Brazil."
