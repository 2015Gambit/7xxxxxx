Use this to get the gey from microsoft and then it is genuine and microsoft will think it is legit the key sends out with then a second enter your email then you go to it and bam there is your key."
,shaharoza,2012-11-19T14:53Z,My personalize option is disabled in windows 8 pro after activation also it is not enabled . plzz help
,libertycity,2012-11-19T19:13Z,"Is this version really 100% untouched and original?

if not, could you please copyrightstealers explain what tweaks have you done to the .iso?"
,copyrightstealers,2012-11-20T04:18Z,"Liberty city 

This is the original. I did change the serial activation around with a code simulator. I changed it so that when it activiates with microsoft servers it automatically activates it genuine. So you can have all the Microsoft support and software you want from them."
,copyrightstealers,2012-11-20T04:20Z,Shaharoza I will take a look at my computer as I have 25 different computers. I will see what is wrong with the personalize option. Did you corrupt the USB burn? What user as you using? Admin? Guest? 
,copyrightstealers,2012-11-20T04:30Z,"Shaharoza 

I installed a the same iso the torrent got the key went to personalize and I changed the backround.

If you download team viewer I will help you. "
,libertycity,2012-11-20T09:30Z,"I have not much clear, so I need the wmc key for this or not? 
btw, if you have made that changes I guess this can't be called ""original iso"" right?"
,copyrightstealers,2012-11-20T19:06Z,"My mistake no this is the original my other one is the modded all you need for this is the key from the link and your done its legit.
cheers"
,libertycity,2012-11-21T12:55Z,"Can't find your other one...

But to can activate with wmc key must have included a data.dat isn't?"
,copyrightstealers,2012-11-22T04:29Z,All you need is the key you install it you enter the key and wallah it works. 
,libertycity,2012-11-22T10:24Z,"Yes, I know... but you know what I'm asking, the iso had already a data.dat included right?"
,copyrightstealers,2012-11-24T00:36Z,Listen its the original iso when I bought it from Microsoft I uploaded it and then found the key from Microsoft that's why it works. Don't ask me how it does it just does. You can scan it with every single av noting will show up.
,libertycity,2012-11-25T11:09Z,"1-. No one original iso have already windows media center ENABLED by default.

2-. No one original iso (without wmc) works with wmc keys IF not replace the tweaked data.dat in Windowssystem32sppstore

So this is why I must ask, you don't really explain what changes you did..."
