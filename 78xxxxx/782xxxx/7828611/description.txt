Let your Sims swim in the ocean on a hot summer day, bob for apples in the
autumn leaves, test their snowboarding skill on the half pipe, or welcome
spring showers with a walk in the rain and a colorful umbrella. All-new
activities, like soccer, and big seasonal festivals and celebrations bring
the spirit of each season to life. Your Sims can pucker up at the kissing
booth at the spring festival, or see what Halloween surprises await in the
haunted house. Dress for the weather with seasonal fashions from sun dresses
to raincoats and snow gear. With new foods, dΓÇÜcor and weather effects, your
Sims can enjoy the bounty and beauty of the ever-changing seasons and play
with life like never before!
