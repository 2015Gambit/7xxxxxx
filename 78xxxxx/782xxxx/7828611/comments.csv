,deathundothee,2012-11-16T18:38Z,"I was able to install the expansion and replace the files, but when I press play the error ""The Game process cannot be started"" comes up, and The Sims closes. What have I done wrong?"
,RCalypso,2012-11-17T11:01Z,"I downloaded this torrent, installed it correctly and copied the stuff over. Didn't work. After about 30mins of struggling I deleted it and tried to play the game with my other expansions. Turns out the torrent fucked up my ENTIRE game. I had to uninstall all my expansions and Sims 3 and install everything over again. "
,peppi_le_piou,2012-11-17T11:38Z,Can someone that has the keygen from the Crack folder upload it please. I have Seasons from another source and don't want to dl a huge iso. I prefer to have a unique serial not one that is passed around.

,AnastasiaM,2012-11-20T16:05Z,@K1NGj what i have to do? 
,jacky09,2012-11-20T17:12Z,"The problem was that i was trying not to use a crack but a mini image. Then when it didn't work i tried with the crack but nothing, Then i realized daemon wasn't reading the mini image so i change it to power iso and now its working just fine. Thanks!"
,JDFS22,2012-11-22T01:58Z,Hmmm just to make sure... why the TS3W on the crack dir is at 0kb? while the one from Sims 3 is at 13kb? this is not normal...
,supachan,2012-11-25T18:35Z,"Works fine on MAC OS X too, however, you need to get a crack fix of the TS3W.exe file to work: The one one this torrent gave me an error when starting the game."
