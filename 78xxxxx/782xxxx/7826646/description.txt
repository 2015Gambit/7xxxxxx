Following his breakthrough success with the New York Times bestseller This Is Where I Leave You, Jonathan Tropper's latest novel is a moving, outrageously funny look at one family's attempts to conquer life's surprises.

In 2009, Jonathan TropperΓÇöwhose previous novels have been acclaimed as superb, tender, smart, honest, sweet, deft, and magnificent, among other praiseΓÇömade his Dutton debut with This Is Where I Leave You and promptly landed on bestseller lists nationwide. And now, with One Last Thing Before I Go, he offers his greatly expanded readership a novel every bit as hilarious, every bit as heartbreaking.
Silver has begun to accept that life isn't going to turn out as he expected. The exwife he's remained friends with is about to marry a terrific guy Silver can't quite bring himself to hate. And his Princeton-bound teenage daughter has just confided in him that she's pregnantΓÇöbecause he's the one she cares least about letting down. As the wedding looms and the pregnancy sinks in, this broken family struggles, bonds, and wrestles with each member's individual anxieties. Lives begin anew, change radically, or, in Silver's caseΓÇöas he discovers that he could die at any moment without an operation he refuses to haveΓÇömay be about to end in an instant.
One Last Thing Before I Go demonstrates yet again Tropper's deft touch with the darkest of materials and his ability to make readers laugh out loud in one paragraph and move them to tears in the next.
