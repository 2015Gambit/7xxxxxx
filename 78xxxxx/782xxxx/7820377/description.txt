FYI--
For those TRULY interested in this Torrent...
As of the time of .torrent creation I personally do not own a tower computer. I only have access to a portable. That being said, in the early circulation of the files I will NOT be able to seed consistently. In order to DL you WILL need to be patient. As of now I can say that I will most likely be seeding through the better part of each night (PST) and seldomly during daylight hours. I urge you to attempt to DL anyway if you are interested and please know that I wouldn't spread this stuff if I didn't think it was worth downloading.
