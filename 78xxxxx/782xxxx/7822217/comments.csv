,mt_phile,2012-11-14T00:10Z,Spanish not Swedish right?
[T],-Gabe-,2012-11-14T12:29Z,Right. Did I miss something?
,mt_phile,2012-11-14T15:42Z,"The info block at the top says ""Spoken language(s):
 Swedish"", but the nfo text below does say Spanish.  Movie is Spanish, just wanted to be sure this wasn't some odd re-mux.

THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD!  Great up."
,yafi_pl,2012-11-14T19:25Z,"I got this (GABE release) from diff. tracker.
There was missing audio last 7 min. of the movie and no present Eng. subs.
Could anyone verify this one is a GOOD version?"
,charlesboyer,2012-11-14T21:54Z,"DAMN IT!!!!!!!!! you're right, the audio is missing for about 7 min. at the end of the movie."
[T],-Gabe-,2012-11-15T13:36Z,"Guys, I'm so sorry about that :( I think I will upload the audio and join it easily by yourself with mkvmerge or just reupload the good one. 
It was becouse of my fucking annoying freezing hdd error so after this time the audio encode stoped without any notice."
[V],GoodFilms,2012-11-15T15:10Z,Just the audio would be useful for those of us who have already downloaded :)
[T],-Gabe-,2012-11-17T20:06Z,"There you go mates
