the scene has released the Nov 12 airing as 203 but I think they missed an episode "
[T],iamgreat,2012-11-14T09:44Z,"Cindy, what LOL/DIM are doing is releasing according to the ABC (aka delayed) schedule and claiming they are from Citytv. Citytv is normally a day ahead of ABC but thanks to the hurricane Citytv was 8 days ahead of ABC. This is the sort of shit you get with the LOL/DIM-faked-from-tv-in-Canada releases.  Any shows these days on Citytv have the logo come together like the reverse of a piece of glass shattering. The simple fade-in hasn't been used on a real Citytv broadcast since circa 2005 and these days is a clear sign of it not really being from tv. But most Americans don't know that and so LOL/DIM continue to get away with their faked-from-tv releases. What they numberd s2e3 is s2e3, but it was on last week not 28 hours ago on Citytv.  I record Happy Endings but not Don't Trust The Bitch In Apartment 23. The CA iTunes has the eps come available according to the US schedule so s2e4 won't be available until next week."
