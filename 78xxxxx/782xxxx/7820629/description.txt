        The Secret Of Crickley Hall | s01 e01 02 03 | WEB-DL XviD


Based on the novel by best-selling British scribe James Herbert, the thriller begins a year after the disappearance of Cam, the son of Gabe Caliegh (Tom Ellis, "The Fades") and Eve Caleigh (Suranne Jones, "Doctor Who"). As the couple and their two daughters attempt to start anew, they head to Crickley Hall ΓÇô a seemingly perfect countryside house. But when cellar doors start to open on their own, phantom children's cries are heard through the night and a frenzied cane-wielding specter rears its head ΓÇô the Caleigh's realize the house comes with a lot more than they bargained for. Just as they're ready to move out, Eve Caleigh hears Cam's cries and all bets are off. 

Shifting between 1943 and 2012, the Caleigh's are desperate to find the source of the crying and the connexion the haunted house has to their son. Will they find him before the evil that stalks Crickley Hall finds their other children? Adapted and directed by Joe Ahearne ("Doctor Who"), this classic haunted house spine chiller is full of scares, yet underpinned by the heartbreaking story of a family needing to heal and ghosts who need to be laid to rest.

And to all those who are saying this is an American show, just because it is shown on an American channel doesn't mean it is an American show. By that logic Grey's Anatomy is Irish because it is on RTE 2 and Hawaii Five-0 is Australian because it is on ten. Pretty silly right? The Secret Of Crickley Hall is from BBC Productions Salford. Salford is just north-west of Manchester.
