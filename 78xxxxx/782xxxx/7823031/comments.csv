Why hasn't anyone posted a dvdrip yet?
The webrip posted earlier was pretty decent, but I would like a quality rip to show friends... :)
Pretty sad that a lame hollywood comedy will get ripped within an hour and this coolness trickles out like an after thought...
The truth will set us free, and I want my freedom now DAMN IT!!! :)
p.s. Love all the hard work done on TPB, peace out... E:)"
,flamesong,2012-11-20T11:08Z,"@Phoenix70 Maybe the reason there is no DVD rip yet is that a DVD has not been released yet; ergo no DVD - no DVD rip. This, I suspect, is a fan edit.

And, I suspect, that whilst the stream is still available for people to cough up for (another few days) there will definitely be no mention of a DVD anywhere on David Icke's website."
