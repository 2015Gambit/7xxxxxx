MY RATING OF THIS EPISODE: 3 of 5 stars

The demonstrations shown to Jesse in this episode were not very impressive compared to videos I've seen and Jesse and crew apparently watched. There just wasn't enough time to really get into this topic in 1 episode, I think. The theory of directed energy weapons used to take down the twin towers is still interesting, but the jury is still out...of course. ;)
