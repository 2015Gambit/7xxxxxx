,mrjlr93,2012-11-15T08:25Z,Thanks this is a great show but i hope they cover some more exciting topics in the remaining episodes 
,k3nd00d,2012-11-15T08:36Z,"Well, apparently Time-Warner/TruTV directed Ventura's production team to include more far-out topics with less meat (so possibly less effective) and then Time-Warner/TruTV had to let government censors (DHS) in our great free country ((sarcasm, we are in a lie machine police state in the USA)) review the 8 episodes of season 3. The result, a 1 year delay, 1 episode on TSA and the full body cancer machines in airports will never air even though a finished edit was made, and the remaining 7 episodes were re-edited before they could be aired."
,WheelWithinAWheel,2012-11-15T08:41Z,Thanks for the up!
,EliteBeast,2012-11-15T08:44Z,I love this show but exposing the New World Order still hasnt helped. Americans continue to be mindless sheep. Ron Paul gave his farewell speech which is sad. Jesse Ventura said he will run for president in 2016 but only if they can get him in the debates. I dont think there will be a USA in 2016. 
,curse,2012-11-15T09:01Z,k3nd00d - Thanx for sharing this episode with us.
,WheelWithinAWheel,2012-11-15T09:13Z,"Yeah, I voted for Gary Johnson.  I could not believe that only 1% of Americans were fed up enough of the same old tired %$#@ to vote for a third party. With people being so numb to reality and so engrossed in their tv and  facebook and video games, true enlightenment for Americans is going to be one hell of an uphill battle."
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T09:49Z,"ta but i cant get it no seeds on any http tracker :/

[V],psspss,2012-11-15T09:50Z,"cant wait for free energy one where the guy was

,k3nd00d,2012-11-15T10:30Z,"I don't know why trackers I have used for years would not work for you. I will add fr33dom tracker from now on. I added it to these two CTwJV S03 episodes. If you add it manually on your end, maybe that will help?"
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T12:33Z,"ok I got afgs version another way so dont matter now

here is a useful list of S03 episodes
=---------------------------------------

301 (16) 	""Reptilian [19]"" 	November 7, 2012 (2012-11-07)
Ventura looks into one of Time Magazine's ""Top 10"" ranked conspiracies â&#x20AC;&#x201D; that some world leaders and other influential people are really shape-shifting lizard beings from another planet who are manipulating the world in human form. Tyrel and Shawn interview a self-proclaimed hybrid, while Jesse reviews video of alleged shape-shifting in progress, searches for a rumored alien base in Dulce, New Mexico, and finally interviews the man who popularized the conspiracy, David Icke. 
302 (17) 	""Death Ray [19]"" 	November 14, 2012 (2012-11-14)
Ventura looks into rumors that the government is using directed-energy weapon technology, not only for strategic missile defense, but as a tool for assassination and possible false flag operations. Ventura feels he's on to something when he learns numerous people involved in the project have died under mysterious circumstances, (including whistle-blower Fred Bell, who died two days after an interview), and a theory that a ray may have been used to disintegrate and collapse the World Trade Center towers on 9/11.

,furthur11,2012-11-16T18:08Z,"THANKS FOR THE UP!!! this show isn't as good as before, his kid is a tool. the Stone kid is a moron and they are both really bad actors. not to mention the chick needs to get a better wig."
[V],psspss,2012-11-17T10:04Z,"ive added the C2C interview with Jese here

,cindy25,2012-11-21T01:58Z,"any chance of Untold History 102?

probably the scene will post it 5 minutes after I write this, but in case they don't"
,SerSpec-V,2012-11-22T03:01Z,"I can't believe John Hutchison was passing off a $150 store bought 1W 445mn laser pointer as his own portable ""Directed Energy Weapon"". He lost a lot of credibility with me with that craziness. Anyone can buy those."
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T01:18Z,"John H always been crazy.. and yeh was same laser my friend has.. which are banned in my country as well.. since the BS about shinning in plane windows.. they arent that good but they will glow a cloud good as it disperses the beam the more distance
he used it to prank teens driving by his house thinking it was a UFO in the clouds LOL

but yeh they will burn through a cup at close up

but I recall the docu about him being evicted as his experiments where causing the fly screens on his neighbors to open and close by them selfs

the prob with his high power and energy experiments is they cant be do on call.. its random happens why only one video is still being used.. hence he filmed it and so no one has backed up his claims either!@"
