Maui... From The Beginning

Enjoy a relaxing sojourn by bringing the 
ambiance and timelessness of Maui into 
your home with this remarkable CD.  
Steven, a 20-year resident of Maui, has 
recorded the unique and stunning sounds
of this idyllic paradise.

Combining inspirational instrumental guitar 
music with the songs of Humpback whales, 
gentle surf, the melodies of exotic birds, the 
chorus of cascading waterfalls through the 
tropical rain forests and the romantic 
rhythms of soft rain falling on palm leaves.
