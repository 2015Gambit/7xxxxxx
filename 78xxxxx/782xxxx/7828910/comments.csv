[T],PirateBoy,2012-11-17T12:56Z,We can not say if the krew will release a game until the game itself is released and we test it out.

Thanks"
,genocide44,2012-11-19T04:00Z,"will there be an hit man absolution and Assassins Creed III rip as the retail is too big for me to download,needs to be at least half its size."
,asdfkjjj,2012-11-22T11:30Z,"Problem here is the uploader (gansuk) has no idea what KaOs will rip and release next, and since they are ripping other releases they wont show on orlydb too bad,  these highly compressed rips with installers are a great bandwidth saving re-release."
