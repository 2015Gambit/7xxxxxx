Fresh out of the desert; Zombie Shaker Box brings an infectious blend of heavy and honest metal to the table. Featuring a lineup of music veterans from across the country, and globe, lends to their polished yet high octane stage shows.

According to Steve Eggleston, industry expert and tour de force behind Vegas Rocks Magazine, Zombie Shaker Box can be described as, ΓÇ£Bone-shakinΓÇÖ, hard-rockinΓÇÖ, sweet riffinΓÇÖ soundΓÇªwould blow away the crowd at Cruefest or Warped Tour!ΓÇ¥

The band is fronted by vocalist Kirk Hulshoff who formed the band Legacy with bass player Marten Andersson. His vocal range is the antithesis of the whiny noise heard on the radio as of late. It more closely steps in line with legends like Layne Staley, and Jerry Cantrell. HeΓÇÖs backed by wizard guitarist Dylan Mueleman, bassist Cory Kay whoΓÇÖs opened for bands like Godsmack in his previous incarnations, as well as Tomonori Sugiyama who brings his bag of drum tricks all the way from Japan and has worked with some of the best in the business.

Zombie Shaker Box is now in the studio finishing up their first album and the music video for BlowNΓÇÖSmoke is nearly complete. They currently play shows in Utah, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and are always looking for more places to go. Their self titled EP is now available on both Itunes and CD Baby. ZSB is currently looking for distribution, label support, sponsorships, and touring opportunities.
