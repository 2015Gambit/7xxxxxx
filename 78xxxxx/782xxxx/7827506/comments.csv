Are you going to be able to seed these files
along with the Nov. 13 Randi show again?

You must have uploaded them hours ago because they're not moving for me.

Thanks."
[T],480v,2012-11-16T02:17Z,Windows kept nagging me to reboot after updates and I simply forgot to restart utorrent after doing so. Please seed people. Why do I have to seed for days? 
[V],TheExecutive,2012-11-16T02:20Z,Got them both -- thanks again!
