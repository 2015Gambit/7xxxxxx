,simon200,2012-11-13T23:31Z,"V 8(for a cam)
A 8(for a cam)

Cheers for the UL Acesn8s"
,tonguefu,2012-11-14T00:06Z,"@fiberoptica, I nominate you for the prestigious Hysterical Twat of The Day Award. Now that you are a winner, do the whole world a favor and donate your computer to charity. "
,shadowy15,2012-11-14T00:48Z,Does this one fix the problem at the end? Where the video breaks off and the audio continues?
,...TPB...,2012-11-14T01:43Z,"oh my God  that's hilarious, what a dumb-fuck."
,crumrugin,2012-11-14T01:58Z,Yeah fiberoptica got it wrong this time but now he feels like shit and you meanies make me fell sorry for him ..awww 
,MiniM33,2012-11-14T02:31Z,"LOL, he sure did go through a lot of trouble to be a moron though, gotta give him/her credit for that :)"
,MVC78,2012-11-14T06:24Z,"Fiberoptic is a FUCKING IDIOT who shall be shamed for all of history. 

On to the movie, really good stuff for a TS. If you usually cringe at the sight of TS uploads after having your fair share of downloading total crap, this is not one of those TS's you need to worry about. Lighting is fairly good even in the dark portions and the audio is fine as well

Overall (for a TS) I'd give it

A: 8
V: 8

Definitely well worth it for those of us who don't want to wait four or five months for the DVD rip. "
,maxmaxpayne,2012-11-14T13:27Z,"better quality than the last one, i might try watch it if my attention span doesnt stray. i blame technology, not beer."
,jeniesis1,2012-11-15T08:22Z,"Great copy (considering its a TS.) It also has waaaaaaaaay better audio than the CAM copys. Thanks Acesn8s!

I'd say:
A = 8
V = 9

And to the moron who commented that this is a fake, shame! shame on you. "
,UnoAphex,2012-11-16T00:58Z,"for a TS this is definitely watchable. the last copy was seizure-iffic. Thanks Mr Aecen8s for a quality TS, could almost pass as DVD if you didn't know any better. "
,UnoAphex,2012-11-16T01:15Z,"Just curious though, at the last few minutes of the movie it keeps having this weird glow, it's nothing terrible just thought weird. "
,shadowy15,2012-11-17T07:27Z,"@ UnoAphex 

At the end of the movie, it switches over to the Russian cam vid that was posted a while ago.

I guess he couldn't get all the movie, but hey, nobody's perfect, and this is a damn good torrent!"
,Achiro,2012-11-20T13:35Z,"This is a terrible fucking torrent, stop uploading cam rips. It's god damn embarrassing. "
,nani1983,2012-11-22T10:31Z,"WOW super great for cam, but the last few mins is messed up, it looks like the the movie is glowing but it's still watchable i don't no how 2 rate a cam but i would give it 8-9 for audio & video (if it weren't for those last minutes i would have gave it a 10) enjoy :D"
,MrPanaFonic,2012-11-26T10:56Z,"It was a good movie and pretty good for a cam defiantly going to buy when it comes out on DVD 

last like 5-6 minutes are messed up but it is just the outro and not anything big so i forgive it

A: 9
V: 7

Great download speed as well "
,DMF_McNasty,2012-11-27T06:02Z,"so does anyone wanna meet a real russian woman? just sayin

V:7
A:8"
,nevi36303,2012-11-28T00:34Z,"really nice cartoon, a lot of great CGI scenes, i loved it!
this copy kinda sucked so i found a better one at seed.dimsumtrust.com worked well for me
enjoy the movie"
,Luisppk,2012-11-29T04:38Z,waiting for a movie with the lasts minutes ok.
