,zyron666,2012-11-15T01:37Z,"there's NO ONE and I mean NO ONE who uploads high quality movies like you, man. 
Great movies, people can choose quality, you often put subs in, I have no words to describe amazing work that you do!

In my opinion you are the best movie uploader right now on the planet.
Thank you so much. "
,anup2007,2012-11-15T02:48Z,"hey @yify .......
what about looper and the apparition(Eva green ) starrer .. HUH !!!! plz be quick before other up loaders "
,xidio,2012-11-15T04:07Z,"zyron youre an idiot, ifyou want QUALITY you dont go Yify because he compresses th shit out the videos making them in 98% of the cases very pixellated and sometimes out of sync. But who knows, maybe you watch them on an old SD tv."

,kingbmw,2012-11-15T07:56Z,yify waiting for dark night rises
,Teck1,2012-11-15T08:55Z,"@xidio, just like the sound of your name...YOU'RE AN IDIOT!!! If you don't like his uploads, get movies from another uploader or better still go to the cinemas, spend some money on the original Blu-Ray copy. Thumbs up YIFY, thanks."
,hxxq,2012-11-15T20:12Z,"I downloaded this torrent only to be fucked wid a BAD YIFY AUDIO..I think YIFY HAS HATRED TOWARDS AUDIO... EVERY MOVIE OF YIFY HAS 99% ISSUE RELATED TO AUDIO DUE HIS EARDRUMS FUCKED UP... 

Thought of getting Dark knight rises , but i wont , i wud rather go for BOZX... even though file size is huge..

GOODBYE 4EVER YIFY... LONG LIVE WITH UR FUCKING AUDIO.. "
,abudix,2012-11-15T20:33Z,hey guys im sad to inform you that it doesnt work on PS3 :( I only get a black screen but i do get sound tho
,lawyertv42,2012-11-16T03:50Z,"My english its no very good.. not offend to YIFY, we don't paid nothing to him, so, we canÂ´t demand.. always YIFY torrents had video quality cool, but the audio is not good, he knows that.. a film with 2 gb its very fine, 2 in a dvd.. 300 mb for audio would be very fine. for a 5.1 or dts sound.. thanks to the uploader, your upload are very accesibles, but you can put better audio quality."

,titziano,2012-11-17T19:28Z,"Man ..The quality is the BEST...but...WTF  this is not
1080p : 
Lawless (2012) 1080p BrRip x264 - YIFY 
Wrong..:
RESOLUTION...................: 1920*800
So do not say that is 1080p...caus its not...."
,Amafule10,2012-11-18T12:35Z,"Great quality and an amazing movie.
Thanks"
,sonufriends2000,2012-11-18T13:24Z,yify...    can you upload Dredd
,bb236,2012-11-18T17:38Z,"Xidio... I play this on my 60"" 1080p television and it looks fine. The audio isn't 5.1, I'll give you that, but pixelated? You're on drugs. As for any other haters, just as lawyertv42 said, you're getting this for free. It's 1080p (well, 1920 by varying heights), so shut the FUCK up and enjoy the movie. The YIFY team does everyone a favor by investing their time into posting dependable quality uploads, so hop off and go download somewhere else if you feel so inclined to open your mouth. 

As for YIFY, thanks for the quality upload, once again. Don't listen to these hating fools, they probably have their eyes closed when they're watching your files if they think that they are pixelated."
,s1raz1,2012-11-18T18:38Z,"Thank u YIFY 
+1 :D"
,titziano,2012-11-18T19:29Z,"bb236
All i said is that the Torrent name shouldnt be 1080p.....thats all... 
He should write the exact video format in the torrent name..thats all.."
,harry218,2012-11-18T19:40Z,"Thanks, good quality for such small size."
,quickrush,2012-11-20T02:47Z,"YIFY knows the quality of the audio in his rips you don't have to tell him this.

I don't care about the audio not being 5.1 and if I did I wouldn't download a 1.7GB file from YIFY and expect it to be 5.1 with 1080p picture quality. 

I am thankful that YIFY takes the time to up all these movies for us who enjoy them.
