The three Bondurant brothers run a bootlegging operation during the depression, up in the mountains of Franklin County, Virginia. Crooked Special Deputy Charles Rakes is after a share of the brothers profits. Compounding their troubles, the local competition is elbowing in on their activities. Forrests boisterous defiance and Crickets knack for moonshine production help the brothers gain a local monopoly.
