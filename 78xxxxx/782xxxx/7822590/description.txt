"What Up, Bro?"

When Jimmy finds a childhood photo of 
himself with an older boy and a family he 
doesn't know, Burt reveals that he and 
Virginia gave him up for adoption for a 
short time when they were teen parents. 
Jimmy recruits Sabrina to forge a scheme to 
meet and bond with his would-have-been big 
brother Brad. Meanwhile, Virginia and Burt 
question their decision to take Jimmy back 
when the would-be adoptive parents turn out 
to be affluent and nurturing.
