,hpham228,2012-11-17T05:11Z,"TO ANYONE WHO TRIED EVERYTHING BUT STILL COULDNT GET IT TO WORK (UPDATE CRACK, CHANGE TIMEZONE AND DATE TO 13TH 14TH ETC....) YOU GOTTA UPDATE YOUR WINDOWS. I BELIEVE MOST OF US ARE USING PRIVATED WINDOWS 7 SO ITS NOT GONNA AUTOMATICLY UPDATE ITSELF. IN THAT CASE, YOU GO TO ""START"" BUTTON, CLICK ON SEARCH AND TYPE ""UPDATE"", THEN CLICK ON ""WINDOWS UPDATE"" AND LET IT DO ITS JOB, AFTER THAT, LET YOUR COMPUTER DO A REBOOT. BEFORE YOU TRY TO RUN THE GAME, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THE DATE BACK TO THE 14TH AND TIMEZONE +8:00 (JUST IN CASE)...NOW YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. ENJOY :D"
,HeavyMetal1021,2012-11-17T06:13Z,Works! Good job man. Even though the date/time problem was small it was annoying as hell haha.
,wayned1985,2012-11-17T10:39Z,"Finally got this to work, windows 8 x64. Go to: C:Program Files (x86)ActivisionCall of Duty Black Ops IIredistDirectXDXSETUP.exe

Run and install. Set the date and time to the 14th Nov, +8 hong kong.

Run the game.

Alternatively use this crack with the game and all is good!

Game is working fine so far! No black screen or crashing. "
,jpmeyer038,2012-11-17T17:06Z,"Had to tack on a .RAR extension on the downloaded file.  It works great though!  Thank you!  
But dear god, the graphics in this game are horrendous "
,coolsmith,2012-11-17T18:47Z,"The whole point of this crack is that you don't have to adjust your time zone.

Just use the crack that comes with the Skidrow release first, then copy and paste this crack to the same install directory of the game itself, click yes to all when you unzip the file and your good to go.

No time zone adjustment is needed from then on.  "
,Da_Jiggler,2012-11-17T19:55Z,"Cool, works fine. Now I know what time it is, thanks."
,iTzNick,2012-11-17T21:50Z,Works Great! This is the third crack I tried and the only one that works. Thank You!

,annon-TPB-helper,2012-11-18T16:35Z,"*****If your getting black screen and random crashes and you dont want to mess up your computer time, use this fix, no more swiching the timezone around, All credits go to GngnmStyl who is the maker of this fix, hope you enjoy campaign, good luck loading the zombies havent figured that out but when i do i will post!*****

1.Download this torrent
2.Mount Iso sr-codbo2
3.Run setup.exe
4.Install Game but dont run it yet
5.Overwrite files in the Call of duty Black ops 2 folder with the ones in the skidrow folder which you find in the iso
6.Use this crack at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7829714/Call_of_Duty__Black_Ops_II_DATE_FIX_FINAL
7.Block executables with the firewall and enjoy"
,goingmad1,2012-11-19T16:18Z,Still not working. Still can't load colossus mission. Still same error. After clean install and everything. Im not even sure if this game is worth proper crack. Just rehash of other cods with same outdated gfx.
,chriscrash,2012-11-20T02:04Z,"this fix works on cracked skidrow's version?  copy the dll files on game folder, but the fucking black screen still there man, what is that source folder anyway?"
,office10,2012-11-20T06:55Z,"  WELL PEOPLE.
1. Download from Extremezone the OPS -2. 
2. Then install the game, but don't try it yet.   
3. Then copy everything, from the skidrow folder replace everything from in the installed game folder with the items from in skidrow.
4. Download from here the crack, copy everything also into the game folder. Which then you don't need to screw with your computer clock. 
5. There isn't any ""Need"" for Steam. I repeat there isn't any need for steam.

Thanks goes out to (Extremezone) & 
(GngnmStyl) aswell Skidrow. You all ROCK Thumbs UP......  "
,Sly_Face,2012-11-20T23:57Z,Thanks David it's working fine...

,octacon22,2012-11-22T06:25Z,"I GOT it Working!!!!!, Go to Superblaquesmith Channel on youtube., but you  need Skidrow 15g version "
,fear_09,2012-11-22T11:45Z,"Games starts normally, but before the first mission starts, right after the briefing page, the game just closes. No crash report, no error shown, just closes. 

These are the steps I followed. Downloaded SKIDROW's version uploaded by Stifmeister. Installed and cracked. Downloaded this and copied the files to the game folder.

My PC specs are old, but i don't think, that is causing the problem is it?
Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 64-Bit
Intel Core i5-750 @ 2.67GHz
Nvidia GT 240 1GB
4GB RAM"
