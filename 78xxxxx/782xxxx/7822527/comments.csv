[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-14T07:15Z,"Here's the really curious thing.

Most of the professionals (you know, media network types) do in fact use x264/AAC
But they've all stopped using MP4. They put x264/AAC in an FLV container.
Sometimes they put x264/AAC in a MOV container. But NEVER MP4 any more.

But only ""Scene"" TV is now in MP4.
Movie & TV DVD rips are all XVID (or MKV).

And fewer of the RGs of ""The Scene"" are doing MP4, most do only a minimum.
Which leaves LOL to do the bulk of this ""BetaMax"" format.

And there are nearing a dozen new entries for XVID posting.

Thank you very much for the Avis.
