,kodiddy,2012-11-19T02:41Z,"Thanks as usual Wush.  What you do is a great thing.  I have a request.  When Demonoid went down so did the only full copy of History of Howard Stern (all acts).  I have been able to get most of it here on Pirate Bay, but have hit a dead end on some files.  In particular the entire Act one and Dec 28,39,30 of Act 3.  Is there any way you could post these items?  Or better yet, is there any possibility that you can do what you do and package all the acts up nicely into one torrent or four torrents (4 acts)?  I hope you can help.  Thanks. "

Angry much?"
