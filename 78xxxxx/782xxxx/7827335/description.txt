SUMMARY......: On a unique planet, a unique species takes its first steps: Mankind begins. 
               But it s a world full of danger. Threatened by extinction, we innovate to 
			   survive--discovering fire and farming; building cities and pyramids; 
			   inventing trade--and mastering the art of war. From humble beginnings, we 
			   become the dominant creature on the planet. Now the future belongs to us. 
                                                                                
RELEASE NOTES: *On the contrary to what the web has this series is split into 6, 2 hour parts.
               (Though, some guides do indeed list it as one, two hour episode.)
               1) The credits only roll out after the 2nd hour has finished.
			   2) At 1:08:20 (clearly into the 2nd hour of the show), the banner displays that "You
			   are watching part 1 of 6" of the mini series. 
			   *Low compressability.
