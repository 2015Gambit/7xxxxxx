The larger file is broken up into smaller ""rar""-files. This helped in getting the files transferred (and other technical reasons) back in the days when error checking was not that great. It has since stuck when it comes to ""scene"" releases of anything pirated.

Today it is a quaint and antiquated way of doing things. You can play the file hidden within the pile of files, but most just decompress it and wind up deleting the rars to save space. This breaks the seeding.

Some will get all fussy about people being lazy, selfish and whatnot by deleting the files and not seeding. But this is like getting mad at people for throwing garbage in the street, rather than just moving the trash bin closer so it falls within the very limited effort capabilities of the lazy bastards.

People are lazy and selfish, so might as well work WITH that, rather than try to change them. So drop the rars, they are not needed anymore. Even if it is tradition or whatever..."
