In the northern frontier of Iran, director Babak Jalali mines absurdist humour and quiet pathos from the immutable routines of a group of men. Hassan is a Persian with Coke-bottle glasses whose only pal is his ever-present donkey. His uncle runs a clothing store whose items never seem to fit his shoppers. A Turkmen minstrel pines for the wife he lost 30 years ago. Together, these characters go through the motions of living while preoccupied with escape. Against visually serene compositions and a plaintive score, Jalali teases out the intense longing hidden behind his charactersΓÇÖ stoic expressions, crafting a humane and drolly charming first feature that leaves an indelible impression.
