To all you seeders...(and at this stage, despite the apparent 55 seeders seeding, I should have this episode in 16 hours to 1 day) go fuck yourselves.  Look up the word parasite because that's exactly what you are.  I'll help you...it's a being that exists thru sucking the life out of another living organism.  All you people who hit and run, a punch in the mouth's for all of you.  Yep, from me coz I can!!!"
,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-11-14T09:39Z,"Blah blah blah

Does whining about speed ever actually work? 

If you don't like the speed then pay for a hosting site and download shit at full speed all the time. You're getting it for free, shut the fuck up."
,AvidViewer,2012-11-14T09:40Z,"Yeah, way to go bonnievillangel... (for below comment) Non seeders are like vampires, sucking the sole and shat outa real people who have a heart to seed....

PS: Great work again ettv, AVI's are the only format that plays on many TV's connected to an external hard drive.  "

,aurora81,2012-11-18T02:17Z,"ettv is the DUCKS GUTS! Thank you for the AVI, very much appreciated. I can't understand why the 'usual' uploaders (one's I've been using for years) have all decided to up & switch formats, it's so GODDAMN FRUSTRATING!! I've been sitting here for 2 freaking days converting files for some of the less popular TV shows, and it really is just a time consuming PAIN IN THE ARSE. (Not to mention that MP4/MKV etc, aren't always a smaller file size than AVI, so really, WTF???) So, once again, THANK YOU! Your ups are always great quality too!"
