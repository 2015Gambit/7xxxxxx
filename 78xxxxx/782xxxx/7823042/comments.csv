Does anybody even want or use that format? What happened to the simple avi, mp4 or even mkv. I haven't touched on of your torrents for ages causer theres no point if they're all in 20 odd tiny rar files. 
Get your shit together or just don't bother. Seriously you must have noticed how many less seeders you've got compared to before."
