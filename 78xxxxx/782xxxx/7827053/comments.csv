,girodice,2012-11-15T06:01Z,"Ugh, 1280x532? Seriously?

Guys, this is NOT 720p. Do not waste your bandwidth. Wait for someone with a clue to re-up the BOZX 6.5GB 720p rip to a smaller 4 GB size."
[V],AliBaloch,2012-11-15T06:34Z,"@valizio007 & girodice it's a 720p version of a scene release and it needed to be cropped thats why encoder cropped it, top and bottom boreders 97x97 cant you see the DAR?? its not 16:9 its 2.40:1 so its not the encoders fault and yes you have the option to wait for a proper bluray till then this version is only available."
,islandinthesun,2012-11-15T06:51Z,time and time again you get comments from idiots who don't know what a 720p rip is...
,QborT,2012-11-15T22:21Z,"Actually the first comment is right.  This is cropped down to eliminate the letterboxing.  Unfortunately a few of the P2P crews didn't realize that the movie was shot with 2 different types of cameras (resulting in 2 different aspect ratios).  So essentially by cropping the height to 532 you are removing parts of the picture.

AliBaloch you are wrong."
