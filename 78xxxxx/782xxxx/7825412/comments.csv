,beechyboy,2012-11-17T16:04Z,"Worked perfectly on Winows 8 PRO. Just run ""Install"" as admin and sit back and wait. It will re-boot and you will then have a fully activated Windows 8 with updates that work.

Thanks"
,biebie26,2012-11-17T16:28Z,beechboy is this permanent activated after you update do are do u have to activate again
,beechyboy,2012-11-18T00:04Z,"Seems permanent biebie26, but only time will tell...."
,maisoumenos,2012-11-20T14:09Z,Funciona 100% sim ou não ?
,arnarbr,2012-11-20T16:49Z,I tell you guys... this is the only Activator that works. Have tried many. Simply run Install as Administrator and bingo. I am using Enterprice 64bit version of Windows 8. Thanks for it Mr. laguili.dz
,MARYUS1010,2012-11-20T23:33Z,"You're cool man, thanks! From so manny useless activators, yours get the prize. Works like a charm on my win 8 64 + Media Center. I even installed updates and it still works."
,maxsuser,2012-11-21T12:01Z,"Thanks uploader ! Confirmed, it works. 
@ biebie26, I ran the Install.cmd as admin before Windows Update. It got activated upon reboot, I ran Windows Update, upon reboot it signed in, I saw the build watermark for a sec but it signed out automatically. I signed back in and was still activated. Did this on 2 PCs, full updates afterwards, all good. Looks like this is the one we've been waiting for."
,stmux,2012-11-22T23:44Z,"After some testing this does not fully activate the VL Server Products like Datacenter.  It will show as activated in the System Window.  However, if you load any services like DNS, or Active Directory, and bring up the Server Manager all those services will show as Not Activated.  Hopefully, the creator of this Activator can fix this.  If anyone else can confirm this, please do.

,fkar,2012-11-23T10:05Z,Will this activate Win 8 Pro & Enterprise (x86 & x64) editions permanently or for any particular time period??
,dragan_id,2012-11-24T01:20Z,So far so good...
,dragan_id,2012-11-24T01:27Z," No, it's not good, immediately after restart I got black screen. Bad work."
,costeakai,2012-11-24T18:08Z,"@dragan_id: you're no good, the activator's good. excuse me."
,victorantonov,2012-11-26T12:06Z,"windows 8 core. Doesn't work. 
In Control Panel/System and security/System
it is written, that win is activated, but still wanted activation 2-3 times a day."
