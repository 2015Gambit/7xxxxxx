In The Provenance Press Guide to the Wiccan Year, Judy Ann Nock offers you a definitive guide to "the wheel of the year." Capturing the essence of the major and lesser holidays, this complete and practical reference will appeal to Wiccans of all levels of experience. The handbook offers something for everyone: recipes, crafts, activities, spells, rituals, and meditations. In these pages, Wiccans will find several appropriate cyclic activities.
Written to inspire and expand the practice as a reader moves through the eight sabbats, Nock provides the practitioner with:
the astrological and astronomical influences that govern the seasons
meditations that reflect timely themes
rituals and crafts that anyone may enact in order to enhance spiritual expression.
