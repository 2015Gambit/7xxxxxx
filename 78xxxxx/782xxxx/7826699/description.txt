A heretic thief is the empireΓÇÖs only hope in this fascinating tale that inhabits the same world as the popular novel, Elantris.

Condemned to death after trying to steal the emperorΓÇÖs scepter, she is given one opportunity to save herself. Though her skill as a Forger is considered an abomination by her captors, Shai will attempt to create a new soul for the emperor, who is almost dead.

Probing deeply into his life, she discovers Emperor AshravanΓÇÖs truest natureΓÇöand the opportunity to exploit it. Her only possible ally is one who is truly loyal to the emperor, but councilor Gaotona must overcome his prejudices to understand that ShaiΓÇÖs forgery is as much artistry as it is deception.
