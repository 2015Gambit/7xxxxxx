Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment on my uploads, and everyone who didn't but is sitting somewhere reading and enjoying them."
,xenoFLASH,2012-11-14T12:10Z,"Love all that you have provided. I hope you come back; but if not, live long and prosper. You will be missed. "
,dassadd,2012-11-14T18:06Z,"Yep, i am one of those ""dumbheads""(if you prefer to call me that), who hardly says ""thank you"" even in real life to others,cause i think the purpose of doing stuff is more than some formality feedback.

okay,so whatever...
I want to let you know that, I appreciate your hard works,like what you provide and wait for new stuffs.

Me being a comics collector downloaded a lot of your stuff and love the way you represent your torrents.

And whatever bout your not coming back,i will take it as a joke from you and will be waiting for more.

Okay,so thats it ...

A BIG SHOUT OUT FOR YOU..."

,autoblank,2012-11-15T02:09Z,"And a well deserved break at that! Thank you, thank you, and thank you, LTS! May the Gods of Comics watch over you and may good things come your way in return for all you have shared and given us. My sincerest heartfelt thanks. A thousand cheers for you, mate! :D"
,luneberg,2012-11-15T08:46Z,"Dear Leonard T -
just tuning in and turning on now to your incredible sharing of deep undergrounds.  Thankyou! Thankyou! Thankyou!  I turned on to SirReal a couple years back but no matter what I did I couldn't access the torrent.  I ended up finding the entire archive for sale on a Colombian Ebay site and that's how I got the SirReal collection.  You have so much furthered that work of bringing this art into the public domain and it is deeply appreciated.  Without your efforts at preservation, the underground world would vanish into a dark abyss.  Thanks for bringing it to light.  best wishes-"
,luneberg,2012-11-15T09:21Z,"Hey! My comment disappeared! Trying again, dear Mr. Spock:  Deep gratitude for all your work preserving the deepest of underground rarities. I love, love, love it!  Without your efforts, this incredible art would vanish into the abyss.  Thank you for bringing it back into the public domain. I turned on to SirReal's archive at Demonoid a couple years back, but could never access them - that is, until I found a kind person on a Colombian Ebay site who sold me the whole 12GB on DVDs.  I can't elp but wonder is there is a better way than torrents to share and preserve this work - based on the number of seeders showing up here... friends operate private forums, etc...  All the best-"
