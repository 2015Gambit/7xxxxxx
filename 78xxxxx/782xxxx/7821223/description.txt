Sir Tom Jones in a unique session of folk, blues and beyond from the
beautiful LSO St Lukes in the City.

Jones and a special band put together by Ethan Johns, the producer of his
last two albums Praise & Blame and Spirit in the Room, deliver songs of guilt
redemption and judgement drawn from those records and also collaborates with
special guests Seasick Steve on Mississippi Fred McDowell's You Gotta Move
with 84 year-old American folk legend Tom Paley on the Mississippi Sheiks
Sitting on Top of the World and young Londoner Josh Osho on Big Bill Broonzy's
Black Brown and White Blues.

Filmed more like a rehearsal in the round than a concert with Ethan Johns on
guitar, Richard Causon on keys, Dave Bronze on bass, Jeremy Stacey on drums
and The Staves - three young sisters from Watford - on backing vocals, this
BBC FOUR Session finds Jones The Voice in masterful yet genial form, exploring
his roots in the songs and styles of the American South in the 50s and 60s
early rock n roll, country, gospel, folk, blues and beyond
