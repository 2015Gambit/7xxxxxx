After a year in Purgatory, Dean finally escapes with the help of a vampire named Benny. As part of their deal, Dean smuggles Benny's soul out of purgatory and resurrects him before they go their separate ways. Dean then travels to the safe house in Whitefish, Montana, where he meets up with Sam. When asked about Castiel, Dean simply states that "Cas didn't make it", implying that Castiel is dead.
