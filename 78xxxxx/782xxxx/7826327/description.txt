Dr Harold Shipman is one of the World's biggest serial killers. In 2000 he was convicted of murdering 215 patients by lethal injection. For over 20 years this general practitioner worked under the guise of a kind, caring man of the community. Whilst fooling his family, colleagues and patients he preyed on those who trusted them the most and killed them with an injection of diamorphine.
