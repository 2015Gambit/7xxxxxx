The most comprehensive, authentic, and critical estimate of the life, sadhana, and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna. This book holds a unique place in hagiographical literature. The life-story of a divine personality worshiped by millions as an Incarnation of God has never been written in this wise by any one of his apostles. The book is not simply a biography of the latest Incarnation of the modern age; it combines a biography with a lucid study of the various cults of religion, mysticism and philosophy existing in India and elsewhere from the prehistoric times down to the modern era.

Translated from Bengali Sri Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga. A detailed Biography [4th Ed.] 1080 Pages, Fully Indexed, Bookmarked - Good Quality. Totally engrossing and a source of constant inspiration. This is my tribute to the Great Master.
