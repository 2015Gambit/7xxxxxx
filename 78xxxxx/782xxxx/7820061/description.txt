"Swan Song"

When the lead guitarist of a rock band is
murdered, the documentary crew that were
following the band turn their cameras on
Castle, Beckett and the team as they try to
solve the case. The result is a documentary
style episode of "Castle," which offers us
a unique glimpse at our characters as they
navigate a world that goes far beyond the
rock & roll stage.
