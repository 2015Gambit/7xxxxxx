,pojas,2012-11-15T22:50Z,"People who have problem to play the game, but after that the game crashes, I found the problem, anda the problem is about the file ""kernel32.dll""
Because that file don´t let the game roll... -.-
And I haven´t got the solution for the problem... but many people form other sites say to format the hard drive and install the operating system again ... = S

I´m not shure, but I think this is the problem!"
