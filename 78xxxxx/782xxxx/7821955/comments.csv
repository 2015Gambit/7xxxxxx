,5-click,2012-11-14T00:08Z,Thank you! I think their limit is much bigger. Watch this with over 11.000 files. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5975061/Bryci_Pictures_Pack

,Hkship,2012-11-14T01:37Z,"thegreenfrog - ah,thats what i thought. it kinda sucks when it comes to pic-torrents,because as soon as people get the zip,they will dump the torrent,and unpack the zip and dump the zip file.
it would be sooo much better if it was loose files,beucase then people would let the torrent continue loading :/

5-click i have that torrent hehehe :D"
,okbyme,2012-11-14T10:18Z,"5-click, you are looking at an old torrent.

The 1500 file limit is newer than that. Just try one torrent with 2000 files and see what happens.
