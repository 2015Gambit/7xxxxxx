Description:Behold a Pale Horse - Americas Last Chance - By Charlie Daniels


Looming world government, a world "elite". The United Nations...loss of American sovereignty! The light of our "shining city on the hill" dims. Dissecting and American under judgement, such patriots as Lieutenant General William Boykin, Elena Chita, Kay Beach, Dr. Katherine Albrecht, Jim Marrs, Dr. Stan Montief, Joel Skousen and Gerald Celente join Charlie Daniels in a primer for the uninitiated on The New World Order and Biblical perspective, as a global feudal police state unfolds. We were born for such a time as this! Be a part of the solution. Your freedom depends on it.

Part One, first of the "Behold A Pale Horse" series of three, others available summer of 2012 is the point of the spear. The remaining two films, with such Patriot notables as Joyce Riley, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Charles Erwin, Texe Marrs, Stewart Rhodes, Greg Evensen, Beverly Eakman, Ron McDonald, Sheriff Richard Mack, G. Edward Griffin, Charlotte Iserbyt, Randy Weaver, Pastor Butch Paugh, Officer Jack McLamb to mention a few, all designed to serve as a primer on the loss of American sovereignty.

As Thomas Jefferson so succinctly put it: "Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God", as Charlie Daniels so succinctly put it: "Let's ride boys...we need a thousand Paul Reveres".

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.

Seed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)
