"Thanksgiving is for the Bird-Kersees"

Debbie wants her family's first Thanksgiving at 
their new home to be different from Thanksgivings 
past, so she convinces Marty to un-invite his 
parents and decides to invite Larry, Jackie, 
Reggie and Dick over for the holiday instead. 
Unfortunately, despite his promise to Debbie, 
Marty caves to parental pressure and confirms his 
mother and father will be on hand for Turkey Day. 
Meanwhile, after learning the meaning of the 
holiday, Dick secretly invites Jackie's estranged 
sisters, Venus and Serena, to make an appearance. 
Thanksgiving Day is anything but normal with the 
crazy alien neighbors, alien and human in-laws, 
and the Weavers all under one roof.
