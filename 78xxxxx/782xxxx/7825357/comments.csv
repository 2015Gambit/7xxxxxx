,comixscholar,2012-11-15T05:32Z,"I'm stuck at 83%...despite there being 59 seeders in my swarm...The problem is that I can't connect to any of the seeders, only to peers. I have this problem with all of your torrents SplhcbPrime. Tons of seeders but I can't connect to any of them. Any idea what the issue might be? I have BitTorrent 7.7 if it's a client issue."
,comixscholar,2012-11-15T08:44Z,"Torrent's no longer stuck, but the peers only connection issue remains. To be clear, all of your torrents have finished for me and they are amazing and great. The thing is, for every one of those, I could not connect to even 1 seeder despite there almost always being 20+ seeders in the swarm, and the torrent would sometimes get stuck, when this happened there would be numerous peers all with the exact same percentage completion as I. It essentially seems to me like a very large portion of ""leechers"" or peers cannot actively connect to any seeders but are reliant on the few and far between leecher/peers who can. I am not trying to complain so much as alert you to a potential issue that I find bizarre and perhaps fixable."
