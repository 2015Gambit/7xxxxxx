Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the fiery Wednesday, November 14 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex fearlessly explores how the FBI was able to hack the CIA Director's e-mail without breaking the law, and Marc Faber's argument that the "fiscal cliff" will mean signing America onto austerity taxes. Alex continues breaking down the latest developments in Hurricane Sandy relief efforts, discussing the latest revelation that FEMA workers are being fed by members of Occupy Sandy. On today's worldwide broadcast, Alex talks with former Minnesota Governor and author of Democrips and Rebloodlicans Jesse Ventura about Obama's re-election and what it means for America. 

Alex also welcomes the governor's son Tyrel Ventura to discuss the new season of his fatherΓÇÖs TruTV show, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.

Note: Not mentioned in the official description, Alex's third hour (and overdrive) guest is Steve Shenk, head of show sponsor eFoodsDirect. Apparently he will also be on tonight's Infowars Nightly News.
