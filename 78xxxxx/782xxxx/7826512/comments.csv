I don't know the exact differences between this and pro except that its more for business and you cannot add media center to it.

I just tested the activator today nov14 and it worked for me, but MS will close that backdoor eventually.  Backup your legit activation with the tokens manager and stuff the files in a flash drive or cdrom or something in case you ever need to reformat.

And remember pirates,
murphy78 loves you :)
Except T.F.K. Screw that guy."
