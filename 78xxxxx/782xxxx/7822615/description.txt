Liber Anarkhos - An Anarchist Grimoire By A. Wretch


The beginning is an essay on the failings of traditional pacifist protest and ideas on what occult oriented protest might look like. Then a Grimoire providing ideas on an Anarchist pantheon, also a rite to enter in to an Anarchist astral temple to meet the Goddess Dysnomia utilizing DMT or Salvia Divinorum. This writing is the practical explanation of how to encourage an anarchist consciousness, the result of my workings with Dysnomia.

This pdf is not intended as an introduction to anarchism but it is an excerpt from an upcoming book providing in depth explorations into the connections between Anarchism and the occult. Other topics in the full book are entheogens, memes, neural plasticity, fractals and language and the corrupting nature of authoritarianism and all the ignorance associated with it.

A basic understanding of political anarchism is very helpful, but its chaos individualism will be evident for people familiar with that branch of occultism.
