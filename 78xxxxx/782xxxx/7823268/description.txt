For the "so bad it's good" crowd . . . 

BLOOD FREAK - A beefy guy (Steve Hawkes) meets an angel on the highway and loses his soul to her bad little sister . .  Notorious as the "turkey-headed monster" movie, with lots of blood and a very heavy-handed religious message for balance.  Must be seen to be believed. There is a narrator (Brad Grinter) who actually seems like a cool guy.

CARNIVAL OF BLOOD - A man operates a game on the boardwalk at Coney Island, gives away teddy bears to winners. His neighbors, who are engaged to be married, get caught up in solving murders of women who've won teddy bears at Coney Island. Starring Earle Edgerton, who's pretty good. Almost all the dialogue seems improvised and this is a terribly cheap movie, but it is a personal favorite. Outrageous. Burt Young from the "Rocky" movies plays the carnival guy's deformed assistant, Gimpy.

The short films elaborate and amplify themes of the two feature films -- substance abuse (drug addiction isn't fun or pretty) and dysfunctional family life (kids whose parents can't stand each other often have problems in their own young lives as a result).
