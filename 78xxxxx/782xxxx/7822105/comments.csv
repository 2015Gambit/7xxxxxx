Who you trying to con here buddy? The inclusion of Odin 3, the driver and clockworkmod is a good idea for anyone starting flashing to download but you can get all these directly from xda at a faster speed, and stay safe while doing it, I personally would not trust this torrent at all. Sketchy at best."

No, sorry my friend youa re the sketchy asshole, in fact you have 'exact' Syndrome, your face look eggsactly like your asshole. So, instead of posting random shit and wasting peoples time, download the rom, flash it and then guide people directly, not some ancient non existent rom. I make various themes on android, in Jelly Been, ICS, Gingerbread etc etc so I know what I am talking about. People do not download this crap, go to the website link I give above, read through everything and then download from the source because this guy is clearly dodgy."
