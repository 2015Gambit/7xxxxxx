Go to program Files and find the Sims 3 seasons folder. Go to 'Game' then 'Bin' and edit the 'Default.ini' file. Scroll down to: [Version] Change the 'Game version' to 16.0.136.019002."

,sarahrs,2012-11-13T19:12Z,"I did and I didn't need to change version.  I'm, still, confused.  Do I need to copy every file in the download to the sims 3 folder or what?  I have successfully installed it, but haven't tried playing because I am not sure where to put cracks, etc.  Usually, there is a crack folder and I go in there and copy the TS3W.exe and the TSLHost.dll into the sims 3 game bin and that works, eventually."

,ajeter,2012-11-13T19:40Z,WHY IS UTORRENT TAKING SO LONG TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME???? AND WHY DOES IT HAVE SO MANY FILES ATTACHED???? HELP
,whskytngo,2012-11-13T19:54Z,Snowdrop's solution worked for me. Thanks!
,robotinvasion,2012-11-13T20:12Z,"This works, the instructions aren't clear.

If you don't have the NRAAS No CD crack installed already, move that from the crack folder into your The Sims 3/ Mods/ Packages/. 

Run the installation, and use the serial that Skidrows posted: 3Q9Z-J8UM-EMME-6XAA-VK83

Manually move the Game, Bin, etc. files over into the new The Sims 3 Seasons folder that appears in your program files under The Sims 3. If you're confused about where everything should go, look at one of the other expansion's files as an example.

Then follow Snowdrop's advice: 

Go to program Files and find the Sims 3 seasons folder. Go to 'Game' then 'Bin' and edit the 'Default.ini' file. Scroll down to: [Version] Change the 'Game version' to 16.0.136.019002.

It should now work."

,dgirl79,2012-11-14T01:34Z,To get past no disc error make sure you have resources.cfg file in your mods folder on the outside of packages folder. This allows game to read package file. Google sims 3 resource cfg file ...working great....not fake. All items included nothing missing
,spystyle,2012-11-14T03:27Z,"@ sarahrs asks :
Where is ""MODS"" folder in The Sims 3 folder?

Answer : You make a folder called mods here ""...DocumentsElectronic ArtsThe Sims 3 ""

See this page for more information :

,Dianastar,2012-11-14T05:46Z,"-----ABOUT THE SIZE---
it''s a legit torrent, i tested it and im using it now, its so small because its only weather changes and a couple clothes instead of the usual entire town that normally comes with an expansion pack (They said it on Sims 3 site!!!). It's not fake, it just has less things in it than the regular expansion packs"
,spystyle,2012-11-14T05:55Z,"Before this could install I had to download the latest patch, here :

no super patch = +-1.1gb
no mac installer
theres no town (seasons do not hv new town)

bout some item missing? need comfirmation
correct me if im wrong"
,smokey877,2012-11-14T09:02Z,"I have this problem,when i try to launch the game It says like windows can't fin Sims3Launcher.exe"
,dobreva33,2012-11-14T09:03Z,hi
,jonokato,2012-11-14T09:28Z,"try renaming the Sims3Launcher.ex_ to .exe, its in game folder>Game>Bin

do not launch the game by launcher, use TS3EP08.exe, rename it from.ex_

do follow the instruction given in other comment"
,Claeric,2012-11-14T12:15Z,"The SIZE is likely because THERE ARE NO PATCHES INCLUDED.

Each expansion is only around 1GB in size, the rest is just tons and tons and tons and tons of patches."
,Claeric,2012-11-14T12:32Z,"FULL INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS since Skidrow was too lazy to actually include any:

1. Use the installer.

2. Copy the Game, Gamedata, and Thumbnails folders to the install directory.

3. Try to launch the game.

4. If ""Service Initialization Failed"", you didn't do something right. Or, try what Snowdrops said.

5. If you get an error that the game has too many uses, do what Dianastar said. Sometimes the game is under Wow64Node/ElectronicArts/Sims3 instead of ""ElectronicArts/TheSims3"". Just keep looking for it, it has to be there if it's installed.

Loading the game right now with no problems."
,lovedixiez,2012-11-14T13:27Z,after the game loads it says no disc inserted what should i do now ?
,BlazinDonuts,2012-11-14T13:32Z,"This worked well for me. Or at least the version from Skidrow's site did, assuming that both downloads here and there are the same. Only problem was that I needed to patch my game which I got from here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7779883/Sims_3_Seasons_CRACKED_and_Patch_1.42.13 , then I just installed the game through installer, moved the files and used the crack from the link above to play the game along with changing the version # as others have stated."
,Mclkkl,2012-11-14T15:19Z,Hello i download one torrent i am not sure if i download this torrent or some else torrent but when i install that torrent and try to play the game then i got this anserw There was an error during startup.

,mirta000,2012-11-15T02:23Z,"I did absolutely everything by the instructions and am still getting ""Service Initialization Failed"" error. I used a super patch to re-patch. I reinstalled. Cleaned out bad registry files with Ccleaner. And even deleted the ergc thing. Help?"
,rox4nn3,2012-11-15T02:57Z,"God, it is soooooo complicated I installed all version and im playing sims FOREVER and its the most complicated version I had. Will give u info if it work... For now, it scrapped all my games, needed to install everything and re-install. Now its asking me to update the game, so im loading a patch...Will give u news.."
,rox4nn3,2012-11-15T03:44Z,"- First, I Put the NRAAS_NoCD.packages in my Mods files (see Spystyle explanations or go on 
http://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files/Setup_and_Files);

- I clicked on Sims2EP08Setup in Installer folder and it asked me to update my game with the game launcher. I couldn't, so i downloaded this patch as Spystyle suggested : http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1870-can-t-update-the-sims-3-to-v142-fix-manual-patch-updated;

- Then, I installed the patch;

- I re-clicked on Sims2EP08Setup in Installer folder and installed the sims with the key gave by Skidrowz: 3Q9Z-J8UM-EMME-6XAA-VK83;

- I choose a file where to install, it loaded, and I refused to install Origin, of course;

- I followed instructions gave by Claeric and Copy the Game, Gamedata, and Thumbnails folders to the install directory of The sims 3 Seasons;

- When I tried to Launch my game, it wasnt finding The Sims3Laucher (i look in the Game/Bin and the Sims3Launcher was .ex_ instead or .exe so i replaced the _ by e);

- I Took a look at my version : 16.0.136.019017, supposed to be ok.

- It says the game as too many use so i tried what Dianastar said:
Press the Windows key and press the letter R (this will open the registry if you're not already there).

Enter regedit

Expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

Expand SOFTWARE. (Wow6432Node for 64-bit systems).

Expand Electronic Arts. (FIND IT MANUALLY!)

Expand Sims.

Expand The Sims 3 Seasons entry.

Remove press right clic and delete ergc entry and press ok when ask if im sure

Then i Started the game again and...

IT FINALLY WORKED! (but then I closed the game cuz i was exhausted!) Thanks to SPystyle, Claeric and Dianastar!

Can't wait to sleep to be able to play tomorrow!"
,spystyle,2012-11-15T04:25Z,"I actually got this to work :) But it was a hassle for sure. 

My daughter has played it for hours, it works fine. 

Here is what I did (on Win7 x86)

0. Installed Sims 3 and all expansion packs

1. Download most recent update (1.42), only the ""manual"" update will work because this is piracy. The ""manual"" update can only come from 1 place :

http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1870-can-t-update-the-sims-3-to-v142-fix-manual-patch-updated

Thanks to ""Games4theWorld""

2. After the update I was able to install the Seasons expansion pack. 

Here is the CD-Key :

3Q9Z-J8UM-EMME-6XAA-VK83

3. I downloaded a file called ""FrameworkSetup.zip"" to create a ""mod folder"". Here :

http://www.modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Installing_Sims_3_Package_Files/Setup_and_Files

4. After creating the mod folder, I moved the crack file ""NRaas_NoCD.package"" to the mod folder's ""packages"" folder. 

5. Then I had to copy 4 folders from the downloaded ""seasons"" to the installed ""seasons"" directory. The folders are :

__Installer
Game
GameData
Thumbnails

(choose ""yes"" to overwrite any existing files) 

6. Then follow Snowdrop's advice:

Go to program Files and find the Sims 3 seasons folder. Go to 'Game' then 'Bin' and edit the 'Default.ini' file. Scroll down to: [Version] Change the 'Game version' to 16.0.136.019002.

Then it worked :) "
,smokey877,2012-11-15T08:43Z,@jonkato i tried it but there i can't find a sims3launcher.ex_ i looked it Game>Bin but it wasn't there >.

,jonokato,2012-11-15T09:49Z,"@Smokey, did you found it? it should be there..its in downlaoded torrent files which in The Sims 3 Seasons>Game>Bin..follow Spystyle instruc.."
,mirta000,2012-11-15T11:53Z,"forced it to work! When you install make sure that there's no ghost copy of Program Files. I had one that looked identical but didn't have a single usable file. It means that your windows messed up while installing! Just re-install. Not even the whole game, but just the expansion pack."
,Sayori,2012-11-17T07:33Z,Where do I find the Peashooter in Buy Mode? I can't find it.. unless this isn'tthe limited edition?

,bella1sims,2012-11-20T11:11Z,"hey,i've installed the game with no problem but after a few minutes of playing the game it's crashing?what should i do.....HELP PLS"
