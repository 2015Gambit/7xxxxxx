We ain't racing for seederz numberz or advertising here .

,Taluen,2012-11-13T22:28Z,"SOLVED!!! Download and install steam. You don't need to login in or even have an account.

,FieroGT,2012-11-13T22:29Z,"damn , whats going on, this is ridiculous.

Sorry for my english.
PS: I only want to help people, if you have problem with my skull remove that."

Unfortunately, only the SP campaign works, not the zombies campaign.  If I try to launch zombies from the SP menu, it just launches steam.  If I launch t6zm.exe I can actually get to the zombies menu, but I can't do anything from there.  Options screen just hangs until I hit esc to go back, and clicking 'campaign' just forces close."

When I tab out, I get the ""Black Ops II is having a problem. Windows will let you know when it has found a solution.""

I have my time zone set to +8:00 (Hong Kong), my video drivers are up to date, my firewall is completely disabled, and I am using this crack.

What can I do to fix this problem?"

I did purchase Sleeping Dogs because it was produced by a lesser known developer, and found it to be worth it. This game's story may be better than in years past, but I still don't feel it is worth anywhere near what they are selling for. "

,jsv88,2012-11-15T03:13Z,"A POSSIBLE FIX for those experiencing the unhandled exception at startup. Many have been saying to change your timezone to +8 Hong Kong, or update to the latest nVidia beta drivers (310.54). If these are not successful, as they weren't for me, change your date to November 13th. This has fixed the issue entirely, but since I also tried the other two fixes, I am uncertain if they are required also. Perhaps others who try it can elaborate."
,Dr.D.,2012-11-15T04:05Z,"@jsv88: Thank you so much, changing the date actually worked for me."

,tedwu,2012-11-15T05:20Z,"jsv88 was right changed the date too to Nov 14th. Worked even after the 4th mission (battleship). Problem for me is zombie game will not work:(

,mavrix,2012-11-15T07:00Z,"What JSV said fixed it for me

Just changed my calender back to the 13th.  

I have a feeling the version used was a media/preview set to stop working at/after release. Would explain why people were playing it fine, then after changing timezones, and now having to change the actual day, are getting it to work"
