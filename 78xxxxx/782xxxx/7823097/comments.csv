,gaysexisfun,2012-12-01T21:35Z,"yeah, i keep getting the DAE error too and it then crashes. I couldn't get it to work so i just uninstalled it. I read somewhere else that it needs the pro tools hardware for it to work. that sucks..... oh well, i'll just continue using cubase 5 and hope that they crack 6.5 anytime soon."
