Have you ever bought or received a mixtape and listen to it and wonder how the @#$% some of the artist got on there? Well they probably paid for a slot that was sold by the host or DJ.Now let's think for a minute if im selling slots that's like providing a service, if im providing a service, that means anyone can buy in. If you let anyone buy in that means you could careless about what the music sounds like as long as you get paid.What do you think a mixtape is gonna sound like if the DJ is doing this?(not so good right) Broken Down ENT would like to present the mixtape series #FuckYourSlots with it's first volume self titled #FuckYourSlots Mixtape Hosted by Steve Boston and D.K.O.
