WHY PDTV INSTEAD OF DVD
rte decided it would be a good idea to take the PAL source and convert it to Region 0 NTSC for their DVD release. They did it the bad way and the DVDs of series 1 and 2 are full of blended frames that sometimes are blantantly visible while viewing the discs. The WS.PDTV releases are from native PAL broadcasts and don't have this issue.

These come fromThe cappers encoded to target bitrate, 1000kbps or 1050kbps, rather than target file size of 350MB or 550MB.
