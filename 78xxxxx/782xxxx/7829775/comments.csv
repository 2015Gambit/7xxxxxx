,i.r.stoker,2012-11-16T08:20Z,"Within a couple minutes of starting dl, my bittorrent client loses the hash - anyone else having this issue?"
,crumrugin,2012-11-16T08:42Z,yes mine stopped too but believe it or not the same apparent file dl's faster anyway on the copy by xxxlavalxxx who has no scull yet but has a bunch of porn uploads

,crumrugin,2012-11-16T09:03Z,After rechecking the file it starts again briefly then after I restart it I get a warning that says that my client cant access it because it is being USED BY ANOTHER PERSON..not in my room i hope ...anyway that sounds too creepy like can a boogie man be tracing my shit? I deleted this out of paranoia
,Clearka,2012-11-16T17:16Z,"Russian video (Russian signs in screen) and English audio. For not native English speaker some scenes understandable very well, others I understand almost nothing (especially when Tom Hanks speaking...)"
,mallory623,2012-11-17T07:16Z,"Poster is right when he says there's pieces missing.  At the 1hour and 20 minute mark, the part where Luisa Rey and Isaac Sachs out on the balcony at sunset sharing a cigarette, its missing Isaac coughing when he tries to smoke (he lied to Luisa that he knew how to smoke). It just fades in and out here.  "
