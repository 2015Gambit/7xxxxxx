In The Husband Project women will discover fun and creative ways to bring back that lovin' feeling and remind their husbands--and themselves--why they married in the first place.

Using the sense of humor that draws thousands of women a year to hear her speak, Kathi Lipp shows wives through simple daily action plans how they can bring the fun back into their relationship even amidst their busy schedules.

 support and encourage other wives who want to make their marriage a priority
