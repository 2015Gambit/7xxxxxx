Countdown to Final Crisis is a limited series (51 issues) that follows 52. The series takes you to every corner of the DC Universe and Multiverse and acts as the spine of the DCU, with every major event and character spinning in and out of the story at some point. Like 52, Countdown comes out weekly, but unlike 52, each issue does not necessarily correspond to one week. Instead, every four issues cover a month of time.
 
It begins with a death that sets off a chain reaction throughout the entirety of the DC Universe--and beyond! Featuring a rotating team of writers and artists including Paul Dini, Jimmy Palmiotti, Justin Gray and more! The Countdown to the FINAL CRISIS begins here!  Note: the issues of Countdown will be a countdown, going from 51 to 1.
