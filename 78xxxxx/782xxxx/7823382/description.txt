Here is the 3rd and last of my "the definitive Django Reinhardt series"

from JSP records; England.  It is volume #5, the others were #3 and #4.

Track #10 is the opening music used in the Woody Allen movie, SWEET AND

LOWDOWN (1999) starring Sean Penn and Samantha Morton 


The engineer states that while these are not particularly rare, they are from

the best available source materials..... procured with great effort 


Another excellent series from this label is THE COMPLETE FATS WALLER
