Bond's loyalty to M is tested as her past comes back to haunt her. As MI6 comes under attack, 007 must track down and destroy the threat, no matter how personal the cost.




Video - Dam nice cam thats for sure ....some glares here and there and some colour issues now and again,but otherwise very nice Q.
Audio - once again jiinx comes up with the goods Audio was nice,contains some hiss though,but better than whats out otherwise. ( at the time of writing this of course )

WORKDONE:
First loaded ilgs video into vdub and upscaled it to 720 x,then i used a HQ smoother to remove the noise that was there.
After i tweaked the contrast,brightness,rgb colours,sat and used the intes to lower the glares....so yes some parts do look duller....but at least you dont need to wear sunglasses now.
After all done it was a case of adding some sharpness back ,to get it that extra life.

Audio stripped uniques syncd audio ( good work ) and dropped it in AA....then i changed the eq bands and lowered the ones with the hiss,however to remove ALL the hissing would have killed the audio even more so i opted to remove a high % of it and in some parts its totally gone.
Then i just saved as mp3 and remuxed.

Enjoy folks   :)
