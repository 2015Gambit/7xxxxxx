BTW Does the new Pratchett (A Blink of the Screen) exist as an audiobook? Not a novel so maybe not. I thought you're the right person to ask as you provide so valuable audiobooks."

As I'm going through ripping my collection, I find that my 2nd disc (Eps 3/4) is scuffed and unreadable.  A trip to Pirate Bay and there's a less-than-two-weeks old FLAC posted. I just made an account to say THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU for this torrent. This is a truly EPIC adaptation of Star Wars that every fan should experience."
