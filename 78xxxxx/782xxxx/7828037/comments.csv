,kramark13,2012-11-16T00:04Z,"Thanks! But yeah, sound doesn't work. :("
,poisongodmachine,2012-11-18T22:40Z,"Can you please re-up this with sound, and please upload episode 2 also?"
,donky73,2012-11-19T18:57Z,I second both these things.  Maybe you could also stop seeding this one as it is pointless sharing it.

I've just tried several times to download it again, but I'm having a lot of trouble getting the sound to come up at all... even in the browser! I'm going to have a good go at it tonight when I get home, so hopefully you'll see both episodes up here by tomorrow."
