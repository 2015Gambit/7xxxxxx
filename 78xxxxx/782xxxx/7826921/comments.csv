Why is that?"
,037451,2012-11-15T15:33Z,"It is OK.

I can play the incomplete file using VLC media player"
,LuckyStrikeNor,2012-11-15T16:08Z,"Confirming what ""037451"" commented, it's possible to play the mp4 file in VLC despite not being complete."
[T],SCSA420,2012-11-15T21:46Z,I'm not sure what the hell is going on here but I have 100% here BUT if you are stuck at 99.9% and IF the mp4 video file is 1.27 GB in size in your folder then the torrent is completed I don't know what the hell is going on but I have uploaded over 7 GB here and it has to be complete at this point.
,XxRinkexX,2012-11-16T12:24Z,stuck at 99.9% fucking seed
,ASTR0N0X,2012-11-16T13:35Z,omg seriously?!?!?!? stuck at 99.9% !?!?!?!?!?!? PLEASE SEED!
,kevx74,2012-11-17T07:07Z,"I have been stuck at 99.9% for a while now, seems that the .nfo, a .torrent and a jpeg are missing, but the vid is fully there and watchable."
,ron916,2012-11-17T14:20Z,Amazingly I have been stuck at 99.9% progress for days now.  Get the 360P SD one instead.  This is not worth it.
[T],SCSA420,2012-11-17T21:43Z,IF the mp4 video file is 1.27 GB in size in your folder then the torrent is completed
