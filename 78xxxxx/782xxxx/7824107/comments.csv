,Zamboni1,2012-11-14T15:32Z,"""The WS.PDTV releases are from native PAL broadcasts and don't have this issue.""???...is this Season 2 PAL or a format most of us use? Sorry for the noob question and thanks for uploading"
[T],iamgreat,2012-11-14T16:37Z,"Zamboni1, RTE's broadcasts are 25 frames per second PAL, which is how the show is filmed. When RTE released the show on DVD they did a horrible job needlessly converting the episodes to NTSC which is 29.97 frames per second  (this is really strange to do for a show made and released only in Europe).  The right way to convert PAL to NTSC (or NTSC to PAL) will change the speed at which the episode plays and thus lengthen or shorten its duration, depending on which way the conversion is being done. The way RTE made the DVDs they kept the duration of the episodes the same and there are hundreds of blended frames in each episode that can't be undone.  If RTE had just released the show in PAL it would all be good and i would have uploaded a DVDRip a long time ago.

The issue i was mentioning briefly and now in more detail here is regarding the source used for making the files. These are XviD files in avi containers and will play just like any others you may have downloaded, whether they be from NTSC or PAL. It is one of the good things about this format. With the start of series 3 there has been a rush of people uploading the show from those sub-standard DVDs from RTE and i thought a good version should make an appearance here instead of just being available on a private torrent site. 

Not everyone cares if there are blended frames in a video file but those who do seem to really hate the DVDs from RTE."

,simon200,2012-11-15T19:59Z,"Eh no1 will be able to DL this unless some 1 who has it starts sharing,connected to 8 peers with 100% and not 1 of them sharing it"
[T],iamgreat,2012-11-16T13:59Z,"simon200, 
i have already uploaded 12GB so there are people out there who could be seeding. And there appear to be 32 as of writing this. 

Some clients don't recognise trackers that begin with ""udp://"". They label them invalid and only recognise trackers that begin with ""http://"".  So i use utorrent 1.8.2 on private sites and BitTorrent 7.0 on public sites. It can be a pain but right now you would find about 10 more seeders if you open the torrent in BitTorrent than if you load it in utorrent.

And to everyone, 
my apologies for the typo in the description's first sentence. The D and S keys are beside each other and i hit the wrong one and didn't notice. "

,Hancock79,2012-11-18T07:01Z,also did th BitTorrent thing and tested them on both clients and the BT program had max download speed.  are they made by the ame people or something?  they're identical
