Complete Savages is an American sitcom that was broadcast on ABC from September 2004 to June 2005.
It was part of ABC's final TGIF comedy line-up. The show was created by Mike Scully and Julie Thacker 
and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Although well received, it was cancelled after its first season
due to low ratings caused by a combination of a weak lead-in series, 8 Simple Rules, in its final season, 
and suspect marketing of the show

The series focuses on single dad Nick Savage struggling to raise his unruly sons, Jack, Chris, Sam, Kyle
and T.J. alone, following the abandonment of their mother ten years previously, 
while working on call day and night as a firefighter with his brother Jimmy. 
His five sons are constantly stirring up trouble and creating unpredictable circumstances for the entire family
to resolve in one way or another.

The theme song was composed and performed by Joseph Interlande, 
and appears at the beginning of each episode as a jam session amongst the whole Savage family.
