,Oblivilot,2012-11-12T20:21Z,"Regarding the comment by SCSA420; Cinavia is not a ""virus"", it's actually another 'legit' industry attempt at DRM. So, it would be more accurate to state that your PS3 has the ""Cinavia"" problem, and will likely have that issue with any film being released with the new Cinavia audio watermark system. There seem to be several websites with various information about this issue, though since I do not have a PS3, cannot steer you safely in any particular direction.. Good Luck!"
,Oblivilot,2012-11-12T20:22Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinavia

""Cinavia, originally called Verance Copy Management System for Audiovisual Content (VCMS/AV), is an analog watermarking and steganography system under development by Verance since 1999, and released in 2010. In conjunction with the existing Advanced Access Content System (AACS) digital rights management (DRM) inclusion of Cinavia watermarking detection support became mandatory for all consumer Blu-ray players from 2012."""
,thereisnoother,2012-11-12T22:12Z,"Awesome move ...great quality from YIFY (my favorite uploader) as usual. YiFY, I understand the need for smaller file size, but on the 1080P rips could you consider improving the quality to 5.1 sound? I don't mind a larger file size, but on a high end home entertainment system, Prologic is not quite the same as a truly multi-channel sound source. Very enjoyable, high quality torrent here folks. Despite being stereo sound, it still sounded okay upconverted by my receiver to 5.1 using prologic (and cranking the volume up a bit).

,thereisnoother,2012-11-12T22:17Z,"Regarding Cinavia on a PS3, Cinavia will only cut out audio after 20 minutes. At that time, just go back to the PS3 menu and change the date to one year ahead (e.g. 21013). The sound will work again and you can continue enjoying the movie. Unfortunately, you have to do this every 20 minutes, but after you get the hang of it, it only takes about 5 seconds to get back to the movie again. You just go back, set the date to one year ahead every time, and when you go back to the movie, the sound will be back for another 20 minutes. Not the ideal solution, but does the job. Another solution is pay for the movie :-)"
