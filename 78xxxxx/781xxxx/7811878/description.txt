This LP was written out of my deep love and respect for the Psychedelic Pop of the 60s. I put a lot of effort in making the best album possible - I'm pleased and thrilled to share it with the world!


MUSIC BELONGS TO EVERYONE - please, download and share my music!


This torrent features all of the tracks in .wav files. If there's sufficient demand for a 320 mp3 version, I'll upload that as well.

Enjoy, and do me a favor - take some drugs before listening.
