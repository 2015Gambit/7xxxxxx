This is the Trans-Siberian Orchestra's "Beethoven's Last Night" special edition album. By special edition, I mean that this album is newly remastered and contains bits of narration that was used for T.S.O.'s concerts when they played "BLN" in full. It makes the concept much clearer and makes for a more fun experience (for me at least, love both versions of this album, this one the most).

It all has a CBR of 320.
