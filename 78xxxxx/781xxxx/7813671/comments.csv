,Wiggum50,2012-11-13T04:08Z,"Very interesting read, thank you as always BBS!

I'm looking for Columbine by David Cullen on epub- if you happen to come across it in your travels, it would be much appreciated!"
,maggiestartsover,2012-11-15T21:45Z,"Hey bigbluesea, I signed up just to ask you about some books. I'm hoping you'll see this comment and reply. They may already be uploaded, but it's pretty difficult to wade through all the floods with the way Piratebay sorts uploads.
I'm looking for anything you have by Robin McKinley or Donna Jo Napoli; the Alvin Maker series by Orson Scott Card; and the book Wench by Dolen Perkins-Valdez.

I am beyond happy that you've uploaded so much Mercedes Lackey!

Thanks for the help."

... and you are right. piratebay search sucks ;)
(looks left-right to ensure no admin is watching).

Tip: Try google, if piratebay search doesn't get you what you seek. You'll be surprised."
