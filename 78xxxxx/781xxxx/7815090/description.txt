Edward Woodward is David Callan, a reluctant professional killer for 

"The Section", a secret division of British intelligence.

(The DVDs contain a brief warning about the quality of the source 

material, and it sometimes shows, but otherwise it is pretty good)

(unfortunately I do not have access to the Region 2 Network DVDs, so 

no series 1 nor 2, Armchair Theatre pilot, movie version of pilot, 

nor reunion episode. Just series 3 & 4. If anyone out there has 

them, please upload. So, withou the early episodes, I recommend 

reading the wikipedia article for backround before watching the 

shows I've uploaded).
