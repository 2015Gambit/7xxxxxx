Biography 
Comprised of childhood friends, lead vocalist and guitarist Andy Schmidt and drummer Brad Booker, later bringing in bassist Kevin Gagnepain when all three were enrolled in the University of Missouri-Columbia, St. Louis's Stir have been making a name for themselves through their extensive touring and glossy power-pop. Originally signed by Aware Records after their showcase at the 1995 South By Southwest festival, their self-titled debut, though rather low budget, received some airplay. Eventually signing with Capitol Records, Stir produced a more focused, radio-friendly follow-up with 2000's Holy Dogs. 


Album Review 
Stir is a talented trio of earnest rockers with a slight twang. The songs are pretty good, but they tend to suffer from sameness ΓÇö the tracks seem to run together. In fact, the first two cuts sound like they could be fit together to make the same song. The album has many rockers, which are offset by acoustic numbers. The musicianship is good and Andrew Schmidt's slightly raspy voice is fine. This debut album shows great promise for better things to come.
