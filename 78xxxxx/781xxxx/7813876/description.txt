These are a set of videos I found on a Russian torrent site. Since then they have been taken down (no seeders) and this torrent is the only one I know of that exists. From the looks of it they were made sometime during the 1990's. There are three parts:

1. Basic techniques
2. Advanced techinques
3. Street fighting application (at least that's as best as I can tell)

The audio is in Russian and and there's lots of funky music that doesn't really belong in a set of combat instructional videos (Patricia Kass, Double - The Captain of Her Heart) but these tapes were jammed packed with techniques and there are lots of really unique fighting moves. Enjoyable.

Please seed.
