,izitox,2012-11-12T15:09Z,Doesn't work!
,dmaja,2012-11-12T17:23Z,"This is not the way an uploader should pack his files in a torrent file. Since there is no confirmation that the activator will work for sure, an user just wants the activator for his edition of windows or office. If you bundle all the activators together, its an utter foolishness and creates a bad impression on an user who looks for a green or pink skull.

The rar file containing all the activators is 170MB. 90 percent of the users just need a single activator for his version, so if you bundle it in a zip, its pointless.

So try to put it as you did the exe and snaps in this torrent.

Well done. Keep it intact.  "

,pipilikam,2012-11-17T05:55Z,"@sherry_ss, I could make out from your description that you attempted to activate it after installation. Right? Now, start qemu even before you install office 2013. I found this method more effective. 

After starting qemu and entering T, wait for a few minutes and leave the window as it is. Then, double click the appropriate regfile. Now, sart your office installation. Finish it and now close the qemu window. Check for activation status. If not activated, wait for a few more minutes and recheck. It would have got activated by now. 

Hope this method will work for you too. I could activate in this method on several machines running windows 8 pro wmc.

All the best."
,sherry_ss,2012-11-17T10:53Z,"you are right, pipilikam.. I tried it before installation too but didn't work... But before this activator i have  tried other activators too. Maybe because of those already tested activators this activator is not working now??? "

4) Return to qemu, and type 13 and press enter
5) while the blank screen in qemu, go back to the Activation folder and run ""Office 2013 Activate.bat"" or ""Office 2013 (w64-o32) Activate.bat"" as your windows x86, x64.
6) After a while it should say product activation successful, also in qemu it will say activation successful. (in my case, nothing appeared on the qemu...) but still it got activated
7) Press any key, then press S and enter to shutdown qemu.

your office should be activated now, run it and check..

,ultrapulse,2012-11-28T02:33Z,"This is what microsoft replied to my question if the RTM is the final version 

""Hello (name withheld),
Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.

There won’t be many changes once the final version of Office 2013 is released. There might be fixes for some of the bugs and might be some internal changes in the mechanism but should not affect the user interface or any other design.


Thanks."""
