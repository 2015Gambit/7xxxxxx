Delivering equal parts comedy and heart, TBS's Wedding Band centers on the bromance of four likable but occasionally reckless young men who can't figure out their own lives. One thing they have figured out, however, is that weddings are the wildest parties in town. After all, the groupies are bridesmaids, the drinks are free and the best part, there's a paycheck waiting at the end of the night. It's not just weddings, the band also brings the party to bar mitzvahs, high-school reunions and even bachelorette parties. (Source: TBS)
