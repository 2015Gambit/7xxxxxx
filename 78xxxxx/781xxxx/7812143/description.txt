A collection of all the D&D 3.5 books I've been able to get my hands on. It covers most of the published Wizards material as well as helpful collections that accompany that.

This is an update of my earlier torrent and includes a large number of non-Wizards works which more than doubled the resulting size of the collection.

There were too many files to include them all separately - TPB's upload system wouldn't accept the resulting file, so I've bound them into a single zip file.
