Book Description
Want to know how to use an electronic component? This first book of a three-volume set includes key information on electronics parts for your projectsΓÇöcomplete with photographs, schematics, and diagrams. YouΓÇÖll learn what each one does, how it works, why itΓÇÖs useful, and what variants exist. No matter how much you know about electronics, youΓÇÖll find fascinating details youΓÇÖve never come across before.

- Unique: the first and only encyclopedia set on electronic components, distilled into three separate volumes
- Incredibly detailed: includes information distilled from hundreds of sources
- Easy to browse: parts are clearly organized by component type
- Authoritative: fact-checked by expert advisors to ensure that the information is both current and accurate
- Reliable: a more consistent source of information than online sources, product datasheets, and manufacturerΓÇÖs tutorials
- Instructive: each component description provides details about substitutions, common problems, and workarounds
- Comprehensive: Volume 1 covers power, electromagnetism, and discrete semi-conductors; Volume 2 includes integrated circuits, and light and sound sources; Volume 3 covers a range of sensing devices.
