,harbrackgrad,2012-11-11T19:56Z,Thank you for the quick response.  just outstanding.

PINES torrent is still active and being seeded. so are all my other torrents. if any torrent doesnt show seeds, its ok, you will stil be able to download it. sometimes for some odd reason, certain torrents dont show any seeds. but they are active. cheers."
