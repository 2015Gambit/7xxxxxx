Why? Don't really know, but perhaps some of the answer lies within the fact that TvTeam don't give the same surrounding service, like snapshots, imdb-links, tech-info and so on. There is just the standard form that looks the same on every upload. At least it seems to be a priorety for most people, not merely the fact the uploader is a trusted one.

Sad, because when seedes deciline, then I and others aware of TvTeam's abilities will have to focus our attention to other uploaders."

um... im not sure mutegrills post post means what you think it means...
@ mutegrill
true - I do like their downloads but the 'frills' do add enough that I tend to lean towards others, and of course I do tend to follow the seads to a degree as well"
,v3blotto,2012-11-11T03:48Z,"I very much appreciate the work tv team puts into their work. As a trusted source TV team is always 100% with what they say their download is. I have to suggest that by not including some of the extra's people can waste a lot of download time.

I try to stick to the 720p or 1080p bluerays. So when I see tv team upping a set like this in blueray, I thought it would be at 720p for sure, it's not. The source might be blue ray, but its 720X304 not 1280X534. So not even 720p. So for 5gig, I'll pass on this one and keep looking."
