This CD was released in 1989.  It consists of 2 entire LP's with drummer Shelly

Manne:


       EMPATHY (1962) with bassist Monty Budwig  (tracks #1-#6)


       A SIMPLE MATTER OF CONVICTION (1966) with bassist Eddie Gomez (tracks #7-#15)



I searched all over and couldn't find a torrent for these albums so here it is for 

y'all in .flac 



Shelly Manne adds good taste to any rhythm section.....tracks 3 and 4 are my 

favorites here...it's hard to go wrong with Bill Evans....opiates and all


Use included .m3u file for burrrn cueing
