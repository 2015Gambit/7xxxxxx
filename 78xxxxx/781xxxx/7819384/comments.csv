Let say 1gig,2gig or ever. Like that you will give other people chance to upload there files and to be seeing too. For the last few day you upload thousands of files separately. When I said ""Stop it"" dos not mean to stop uploading, means ""Do it the smart way"". Again, no offence RosaMannen, just friendly advice. Cheers!!! "
[V],RosaMannen,2012-11-13T18:14Z,Thousands of files?  Count them and you will see that they are not more than 200 the last week. I have tried to upload a folder with like 50 files and the users here at TPB didnt like it cause they couldnt search for a video with a specific artist. I don't know how to solve this problem. But thanks for the opinion.
