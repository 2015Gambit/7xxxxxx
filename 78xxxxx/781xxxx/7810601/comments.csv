Damaged source - LOL / DIMENSION / re-encoders
Grossly Pixelated Error @ 36:23
Recommend waiting for the WEB-DL
=====================
Some people won't notice
Many people don't care
This is purely informational for the rest of you. Documented errors since MP4 began:
LOL=129 | ASAP=3 | 2HD=2 | COMPULSION=1 | LMAO=1
IMMERSE=1 | FOV=1 | BAJSKORV=1 | YesTV=0 | TLA=0
MOMENTUM=0 | FTP=0 | SYS=0 | EVOLVE=0
As Bogie said ""but look at the sheer number of them!""

LOL has yet to put out an undamaged episode of SVU
LOL has put out only ONE undamaged episode of Revolution
LOL has put out only TWO undamaged episode of Fringe
Why not let someone who knows what they're doing have thses shows?
Every single other RG has a perfect record of no GPEs, except FOV with 1."
