A mad(?) scientist conducts bizarre experiments using the power generated by his human subjects' sexual activity to keep himself young and vital. Subjects are mostly female, somehow, and usually kidnapped. One man's tragic fate, after innumerable sexual encounters, is to become a monster like the one in Frankenstein

Of course it makes little sense, and there's lots of extra sexual padding thanks to U.S. importer Jerald Intrator.

One of Something Weird Video's first DVD releases -- it's that good!

See it with Vieyra's Placer sangriento (U.S. version: FEAST OF FLESH a.k.a. The Deadly Organ), another sexy horror show.
