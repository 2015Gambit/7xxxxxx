,Cachorro,2012-11-12T19:23Z,"You are right fenwik, It can not be enable into iCloud. I went to the page, I follow all the intructions and after 2 days I still can not enable it in iCloud.
So...I took the app. from my Mac Pro and the other from my iPad and down the toilet they went
It is version 1.0 they have much to improve yet."

I think the crack must have disabled it from communicating.
iCloud support works on the AppStore Version."

It works problem fri & come with the system."
