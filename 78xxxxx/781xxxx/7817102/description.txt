Second incomplete run of 'Comic Book Artist'

7 issues in total, numbers from 3-21 , with obvious gaps

TwoMorrows Publishing, 1998-2003

These are BIG books. All of them are up around 100 pages, if not longer. Different source for this batch, and these are not quite as 'clean' and perfect as the first batch. I did do a bit of work on a few of them, but that was mostly making them smaller. Some of them had page dimensions that were 3-4 times too big, which made the files HUGE. I shrunk them all down to my usual 1400 width. Also, one of them was scanned c2c as two-page spreads. I edited that one down to single pages for your viewing pleasure.
