,P_Greezy,2012-11-11T05:27Z,"Ahhh early release is what i like to see, thanks for getting this first ;)"
,Smallz94,2012-11-11T05:50Z,Yes!!!!!!!
,S8W7,2012-11-11T05:55Z,Any chance we can get a PC early release? 
,ldyal09,2012-11-11T06:01Z,Will be seeding this up until next Friday.
,Ahall88,2012-11-11T06:22Z,"Anyone mind sharing some spoilers, once they've completed the story?"
[V],HeroMaster,2012-11-11T06:31Z,"@tykoon123 Next time keep your Piece Length to 1 MB for having Small Size of the torrent, this one is killing it man :)"
,1nter1908,2012-11-11T07:37Z,how d fuck is it out early for xbox 
[V],Test_Verify,2012-11-11T07:56Z,Thanks. :)
,ldyal09,2012-11-11T08:18Z,"Damn the leechers are here now; was getting around 1 MB download speeds, now lucky to go over 15 kb"
,dunit80,2012-11-11T09:12Z,"@1nter1908 dont you ever see that most games leak the streets early. Halo 4 came out a month early. Black Ops 2 came out almost 2 weeks early. Its not uncommon. Someone always manages to get a hold of a copy in this day and age. 

And thanks tykoon123. I thought noobish would be first one to post this. But looks like you beat him to the punch."
,dunit80,2012-11-11T09:14Z,"@Idyal09 dont you just hate when the leechers show up? They are the ones who probably set their upload speed to 1kb. Took me 3 days to download Halo 4 and Black Ops 2. And I have a Verizon FIOS connection. If everyone just kept their upload speed up, it would help everyone out."
,jorgealbach,2012-11-11T12:21Z,has subtitles in spanish?
,blz0,2012-11-11T13:06Z,does it work with lt 2.0 patched back?
,Khaleddahly,2012-11-11T13:15Z,SEED PLZ:(
,ldyal09,2012-11-11T13:54Z,"Wow, been downloading for 8 hours, and only downloaded 1 GB, but uploaded almost 4 GB, seed people"
,daahouse,2012-11-11T14:53Z,maybe stupid question. there's no verification on abgx. then how does it work?
,smilingze,2012-11-11T17:35Z,"Game works great on LT3.0, it wont work on LT 2.0, No need to run through ABGX , online play ( contracts) require online pass(must buy) , the game is Amazing enough that I am buying it for PS3."
,dunit80,2012-11-11T19:16Z,"@daahouse games that dont verify thru abgx doesnt  mean they dont work, for this game it just means the game came out early and they dont have it in their database yet. It will run thru abgx once they get the game in their database."
,neon2579,2012-11-11T20:25Z,"Great upload SWAG/tykoon!!!
Many Thanks...."
,jakenator,2012-11-11T21:05Z,"Holy crap people someone seed, shits at like 30kb!"
,TheRealAgent47,2012-11-11T22:34Z,"PPL PLEASE SEEEEEEEEED. someone goes to the trouble of putting this up early and nobody wants to share......leeching bastards!!!!!! thanks in advance tykoon i will seed for a week, stuck at 23% so again.......SEEEEED PPL PLEASE"
,daniel460,2012-11-11T23:07Z,"Does it works on Rgh simply or stuck like with Black Ops II...
Jtag mates?!"
,dunit80,2012-11-12T00:43Z,"@daniel460 if you were getting stuck on Black Ops 2 using RGH here is how you make it play. I have RGH and was having same problem. You need to update to Dashlaunch 3.02.  After running dashlaunch on your Xbox click the RB button until you get to the Misc menu. Click on Uninstall. All it does is remove dashlaunch from your systems flash memory. Then click on Launch and select Black Ops 2. The game will run fine now. If you are trying to boot the game from XEXMenu or older version of Dashlaunch, it will get stuck when you start the game. Try that and let me know if it helps you. Worked like a charm for me and everyone else I showed how to do it."
,jakenator,2012-11-12T00:46Z,11 hours in and at 90.08% FUCKING SEED!!!!! This is just sad.
,dunit80,2012-11-12T00:47Z,"@daahouse If youre game is freezing on BO2 using RGH Xbox. Follow these steps. You need to be using Dashlaunch 3.02. If you are trying to load the game using an older version or using XEXMenu, the game will freeze when trying to load the first mission. 

Load Dashlaunch and click RB button til you get to Misc. menu.  Click on uninstall option, which removes it from system flash. Then click on launch option and select the game. Now it will load up with no problems. Try that and let me know how it worked for you. "
,dunit80,2012-11-12T00:54Z,"@jakenator and realagent  Most people think that if they set their upload speed real low that they will download the game faster when exactly the opposite is true. The faster you share the game the faster you get information from the game. I can understand setting your upload speed a little lower if you have bandwith caps, but if you dont, dont mess with your upload speed. Your upload speed will NOT affect your download speed at all. Having a high upload rate doesnt make you download slower. Help everyone out. I was going pretty fast for first few hours, now Im lucky to get 10kb."
,jakenator,2012-11-12T01:20Z,"@dunit80 I am aware of that and thats why people seed even after downloading to help the rest of us. Also I have dashlaunch 3.04 and it loads games like Call of Duty Black Ops 2 just fine, so maybe it will work for this."
,jakenator,2012-11-12T01:20Z,*should seed*
,jakenator,2012-11-12T01:47Z,"Finished downloading, will seed for a while."
,ChanneleverythingTv,2012-11-12T01:59Z,works great for lt2.0 
,dunit80,2012-11-12T02:28Z,"I was just agreeing with your comment about people needing to seed. And then making a general reference about most peoples downloading habits aka the LEECHES. Wasnt directing that at just you. Just announcing my frustration along with you at all the mooches on here that want the game as fast as they can get it, but then dont want to help other people out. Im at 5gb downloaded right now, and 28gb uploaded. I do my fair share."
,jakenator,2012-11-12T05:16Z,^kk
,P_Greezy,2012-11-12T06:23Z,Game Works perfectly with overburn method on lt 3.0 no errors!
,srkrock,2012-11-12T06:53Z,Plz seed downloding since 18 hour n it just 14 % wholy shit
,P_Greezy,2012-11-12T07:06Z,"I had to download from another source because this torrent would of took me 2 - 3 days to download and i really want to play, but its does work with oveburn so it should work with truncate ;)"
,Damitttttt,2012-11-12T08:13Z,Works for me on my xkey thanks tykoon123.  Hey I curious if you take requests for games I can't find a torrent for Viva Pinata Trouble in Paradise and would love it if you could upload it thanks.
,chasden1,2012-11-12T12:28Z,NEVER play games before release date. Have fun getting banned.
,wakymaky666,2012-11-12T13:45Z,iv you do a bit of reserch on google truncate is the best way to burn these games if u havent got a IHAS burner.. iv you overburn it will mess up your xbox driver laser alot faster.. plus iv had more sucsess burning game with truncate then overburn.
,xXxRoberxXx9mm,2012-11-12T14:35Z,works like a charm thx a lot !keep on seeding!
,Stroncium,2012-11-12T14:44Z,"No matter what i do it keeps failing verification after burning, you can clearly see there are some layers missing on the burned cd, after second mission the game freezes. I already fucked up 2 dvds."
,P_Greezy,2012-11-12T16:15Z,"@wakymaky666 Things have changed as new games are gettin released, truncate only works for some games, and others you will have to do a mp3 trick, with overburn i never once had a civ fail error, ive finished all the games i ever wanted to play, i guess it depends on how good your burner is because for me overburn works excellent over truncate"
,basseee,2012-11-12T17:04Z,"Hi all anyone got this problem? game starts,intro plays then nothing just loadning :/ same with halo 4 can't get past prologue missing downloaded content.. got lt 3.0 did the guide but nothing woorks :/ haven't tried the mp3 trick? "
,ani1991,2012-11-12T17:15Z,downloadin now will comment later looks like a good torrent
,dunit80,2012-11-12T20:16Z,"Finally finished downloading. Will continue to seed for 1 week.  

Works great on my RGH console using XEXMenu to load the game."
,dunit80,2012-11-12T20:18Z,"For everyone that is still burning discs. They are making changes with all the new games that are coming out and making it harder and harder to actually burn them. Might want to consider finding someone on craigslist that can do an RGH to your XBOX. Games always work and you never have to burn another disc again. Just download, extract with XBOX Image Browser and play straight from an external drive or USB flash drive."
,chazz1488,2012-11-13T03:04Z,Seed you selfish pricks.. you expect people to seed for you so do the same.
,ZroHead,2012-11-13T03:26Z,i have lt 3.0 and recently an xbox live update came out and if i update will i still be able to play back ups? 
,Mehmet79,2012-11-13T11:20Z,"Just sharing for RGH and Jtager's... The game will not load correct if in GOD format, but extracted ISO (default.xes), works."
,4life666,2012-11-13T13:27Z,Great stuff :) Next stop : Far Cry 3 :D
,slinkher,2012-11-13T18:11Z,"Thanks! Working 100% , i've downloaded , burned with Img burn , truncate mode!! 

No problem at all , i just signed off live , and played with an guest profile and saved the save game files on a pen drive since the game release date is 20th november , and i don't wanna be banned from live!

,KKKDownlow,2012-11-17T20:41Z,The people that get caught playing these video games before the release date are the ones they have the evidence against to put away in jail for piracy.
