,aarque,2012-11-11T15:10Z,"Seriously, you waited 8 hours before stepping on his torrent? Granted, it appears to be a lame torrent, - and thanks, of course I'll take what I can get, but, was it really THAT important to be first?
 What if his had started seeding, would you have removed yours for confusing people and clogging the trackers? Would you have waited longer if the torrent wasn't anonymous? If it was me and I was waiting over the weekend to resume seeding?

TPB has a very strict open disclosure, open source policy about removing torrents. They remove clearly fake torrents upon request. They do not remove slow, no seeder, or ""confusing"" torrents, unless the original up-loader requests it."
,skouras555,2012-11-11T15:14Z,"thanks Snakeye
great upload"
,Kuiper,2012-11-11T16:21Z,"You rock _SnakEye.  Thanks for this.

STFU aarque about stepping on torrents.  I'm sure not everyone is as immature as you and obsesses about being first.  "
,Knasen[2],2012-11-11T16:32Z,thank you :)
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-11T18:08Z,"aarque , there was no race here as how I seeing things.
I just saw that it was stuck on 0% for few hours, so I believed there was an issue with it. I see also the new one he posted did not work well.
there was pressure on this, so I gave in.
I am taking your criticism and I'll pay attention more next time.
"
[T],_SnakEye,2012-11-11T18:11Z,"Kuiper , I admire you stepping up for me, however it is between me and ""aarque"".
let me deal with him.

BTW - he does have a point there after all."

,andyde135,2012-11-11T21:04Z,"_SnakEye: Just read your conversation..you're so selfless even after sharing so many great addons..

And yes, thanks again for the scenery. "
,Cden46,2012-11-11T22:51Z,Aarque it's not that serious you are complaining if snakeye wanted to first in posting so what if he did his uploads are great and works more than the others I don't see you posting up anything shut up and enjoy what you get 
,aarque,2012-11-12T00:31Z,"That's rich. ""I don't see you posting anything,"" Um, look? But good job on clicking ""download"" and bringing your illustrious experience and wisdom to the conversation...as if you'll ever read this, you've grabbed your warez and flown...

And I didn't do that minus one, that is lame, besides being superficial. All I am saying is it is up to us to manage this place. It's like etiquette and it has a purpose."
,skouras555,2012-11-12T00:35Z,agreed
,Kuiper,2012-11-12T01:42Z,"We should all be buying this scenery if you can afford it.  It is an amazing piece of work.
