The Jungle Book is one of the works for which Rudyard Kipling is best remembered. The Jungle Book falls in line with works like Flatland and Alice in Wonderland (which offer satire and political commentary, underneath the genre title of children's literature). Likewise, the stories in The Jungle Book are written to be enjoyed by adults as well as children--with that depth of meaning and symbolism that delves far beyond the surface.

These are the stories of Mowgli "the frog," a man-cub raised by wolves, and his journey to adulthood with the help of Baloo the bear, Bagheera the black panther, and many other memorable characters. The tales of Mowgli became a Disney movie classic, and the tale of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi the mongoose has also been adapted many times over, but the film versions are nowhere near as classic as this timeless book.
