From the preface:
----------------
Believe it or not, some chemists do have a sense of humour,  
and  this  book  is  a  testament  to  that.    On  the  following  pages  I'll  
show  you   some   real   molecules   that   have   unusual,   ridiculous   or  
downright  silly  names.    Some  of  the  molecule  names  are  bizarre,  
some  make  you  wonder  how  supposedly  serious  scientists  could  
possibly have called a molecule that, and some are very rude indeed!    
            
          Although  the  object  of  this  book  is  mainly  entertainment,  
IΓÇÖve tried to include a fair bit of science along the way, along with  
the  references  if  you  want  to  check  that  I  didnΓÇÖt  make  it  all  up!   
Most of the molecules have their full structure shown, and with some  
IΓÇÖve included brief facts about their history and what theyΓÇÖre used  
for.  As well as molecules, IΓÇÖve also included some of my favourites  
from  the  vast  number  of  minerals,  proteins  and  genes  that  have  
often  accidentally  (or  deliberately!)  been  given  ludicrous  names.   
Despite  the  humorous  and  often  irreverent  nature  of  the  content,  
IΓÇÖm hoping that the reader might unknowingly pick up quite a bit of  
chemistry along the way ΓÇô learning chemistry ΓÇÿby stealthΓÇÖ, as it were.
