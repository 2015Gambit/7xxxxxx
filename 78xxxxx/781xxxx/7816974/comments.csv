,acb123,2012-11-12T19:27Z,"At first i thought simplepickup was funny and three dudes having fun who posted a youtube vid and got some success, but after watching these, it appears they've been in into 'pickup' for years, youtube was carefully planned and that's all they do with their life? lol...  

Also i think the way they're drip feeding 'techniques' to nerd guys to try and make a profit is kinda sad, it's almost like a crutch for some of them, the only way to meet a nice girl is to put yourself out there participate in lots of activities outside of school or work and you'll come out of your shell.  Hanging out for the next vid with a 'situation' or 'technique' aint going to do it LOL.

,dubzar,2012-11-12T23:07Z,"@acb123 Yes you are correct. It was all planned. These guys are marketing geniuses.. Make a YouTube account, to Entertain people... reach 100k Subs to make enough income to do this full time, albeit a low paying income at the time since its 3 guys (hence them living in ghetto part of LA)... Create mailing list for ""Exclusive/Cut-out Clips""...  mass email all of them about a new service called ""Project Go"" in which members pay a MONTHLY fee... Keep putting out bullshit until they run out of ideas...  Anyways this is getting kind of out of track...They're entertainers/entrepreneurs. They entertain/inform people and they get paid in doing so. That's why they tell girls that they do ""internet marketing"". And I bet right now they're probably netting a good amount now since they're about 400k subs in and Project Go's price went up. 


""Also i think the way they're drip feeding 'techniques' to nerd guys to try and make a profit is kinda sad""

Congrats, you learned how you make money nowadays. Exploit the weak and stupid. If you show someone that you can help them improve in some type of skill somehow then they will most likely pay you for improvement if you have enough references. Take me for example.. Introverted above average looking guy who barely had any social skills.. Look up how to get girls on YouTube since YouTube has videos on how to do anything, right?.. Find SimplePickup.. 'WOW omg it's this easy'.. Learn more about PUA.. Start's getting laid thanks to simplepickup/rsd/etc.. What's the references for these PUA's? Their videos and sub count. Of course people will fall for the illusion but it's more than that. It's about embracing the best of version you and getting better with your social skills.

BUT GUESS WHAT? HATING doesn't get you anywhere. go get u a hustle nd con dum ppl n then maybe u can get sum pussy n muney 2. holla'. lol jk ily. 

Anyways.. now I just watch Simplepickup videos for entertainment and just watch these Project GO videos for motivation to go out and some tips from time to time. I'll admit at first you feel like you're learning a lot, but then you learn the basics and then it begins to be repeated lessons. Just BE CONFIDENT in everything you do and you will conquer inner game. If not, if you have a lot of money, are a model, or natural (social circles part you were getting into) then girls will run to you. THERE's the truth..
