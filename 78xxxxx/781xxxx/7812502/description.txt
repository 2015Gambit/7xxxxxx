Storyline: A race-car driver named Bandit makes a bet that he can transport an illegal shipment of beer from Texas to Atlanta in under 28 hours. Along the way, he picks up an unwilling bride-to-be, furthering his chances of being arrested. It turns out her future father-in-law is Sheriff "Smokey" Justice, and his boy is waiting for her at the altar. A car chase ensues as Smokey scours the South in pursuit of Bandit.
