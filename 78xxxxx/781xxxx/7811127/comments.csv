,halfchaos,2012-11-10T08:57Z,We yell at you every week because it's already on bill's website 2 hours before you upload it and meanwhile we are searching every half hour for the real show and keep finding this useless upload instead. STOP IT.
,yurune,2012-11-10T09:50Z,Can we get an xvid for this one?
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-10T09:50Z,"Well, halfchaos:

There are about six of you and currently 634 who disagree with you. And they can read, too.

Consider carefully who should ""Stop It"".

Pretty please?

,Drizzle99,2012-11-10T10:20Z,"Never mind morons like halfchaos, MP4SUX. I appreciate your upload and look forward to it every week. And yes, I much prefer mp4 myself. Congrats on your pink skull and keep on!"
,iamrifter,2012-11-10T10:46Z,"Don't listen to those assholes. Lots of people can't stream the site anyway, and even those who can, we like to have a nice regular video file, no fuss, no muss. Easy to collect, rewatch, make clips, or just plain not worry about the streaming. Sure we could rip it, but it's a pain in the ass, and you save us a lot of work. So let me speak for all of us when I say, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are awesome. A big fuck you to whingers who tell people not to upload, too. You don't like it? Don't download it then. Boo hoo that there's another file in the search. Learn to search, newbs, sheesh!"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-10T12:36Z,"A cautionary tale for my more ""vocal"" supporters:

A number of years ago I was in a hurry and there was this bus with its door open.
I kept up my run and brushed past the driver adjusting the mirror outside the door.
I headed for the middle of the bus probably a bit fast due to inertia.

The bus driver hollers at me to get off the bus.

What I didn't understand was that although the bus was four feet from the stop
The driver had closed the door, pulled away and then stopped to adjust a mirror.
In the driver's eyes, I was ... illegally entering the bus after it had started up.

I just stood there, thinking how strange this was when a well meaning passenger
spoke up - ""hey, let the guy stay!"". They started arguing as I politely melted
into the crowd. A cop showed up & threw my supporter off the bus.
Apparently I'd been completely forgotten and very near the back of a double bus.

Supporting me ""vocally"" can be treacherous as I politely melt into the background.

,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-10T21:31Z,Thanks!
,Ms.HaL9000,2012-11-10T21:38Z,"No idea why +2/-3

This upload is very high quality, spot on dude. And f*ck the haters."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-11T02:02Z,"Agree the quality mystifies - but this is the most contentious thing I index here for some reason. That 2HD always waits way too many hours to post is probably somewhat to blame.

And my very first MP4 at that.

But the quality is no reflection on me whatsoever. It's purely HBO data completely untouched - I just turned their FLV into an MP4. Normally that's just an intermediate step in my CC2AVI process. But it suddenly dawned on me that this would be more desireable.

Since with all these comments, not one slams the quality - it must be the ""haters"" using an old Chicago trick:

Vote early, vote often.

p.s. - none of this actually bothers me or will deter me one iota. When my efforts yield 99 and 44/100 positive to negative, I like being a gold standard. My ego is perfectly in check as I know that I am the greatest human being to have ever lived. And I'm magnanimous enough to forgive all seven billion of you for not recognizing this simple but powerful truth.

heh"
