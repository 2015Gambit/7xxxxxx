For 100% HBO:
V=10
A=10
Every week people yell at me for not providing the show with this.
Go away.
Everyone else, welcome - relax - enjoy ...

Release Name: Real.Time.With.Bill.Maher.2012.11.09.OverTimeOnly.x264.AAC-AVIGUY.mp4

From AVIGUY:
Release Date.: 2012-11-09
Release Size: 196 Mb
Run Time: 11:29
Resolution.....: 960x544
Video Bitrate..: 2206 Kbps
Video: x264 MP4
Audio: AAC 188kbps 44KHz
CC2RAW FLVExtract [Extract x264 video, AAC audio]
CC2MP4: MP4Muxer [Create MP4]

I find myself astonished that I'd release an MP4.
But I've never gotten certain feedback that CC2AVI is of any real use.
And this may be the format people would prefer for their x264. Or like AAC.
So, the best HBO has to offer in "The Scene"'s new favorite container.
I neede a shower ...
