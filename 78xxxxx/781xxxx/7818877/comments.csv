,hiyoelbrian,2012-11-14T02:08Z,Also you should install the files located in the redist directory in the location you installed the game. After that set your time to +8 Beijing) and play. Worked for me so I hope it works for you.

,Renohawke,2012-11-15T18:50Z,I have tryed everything to get this game to run for me. But I am always getting the same error: Unhandled exception caught. I have tryed almost every crack. every suggestion about the time a date changes. Nothing seems to work. Any help would be great. Thanks in advance.
,Kindergaten,2012-11-15T19:54Z,Theres a video on u tube that helped me install this. Search gligar2tennyson on u tube. Very helpful. 
,hpham228,2012-11-17T05:12Z,"TO ANYONE WHO TRIED EVERYTHING BUT STILL COULDNT GET IT TO WORK (UPDATE CRACK, CHANGE TIMEZONE AND DATE TO 13TH 14TH ETC....) YOU GOTTA UPDATE YOUR WINDOWS. I BELIEVE MOST OF US ARE USING PRIVATED WINDOWS 7 SO ITS NOT GONNA AUTOMATICLY UPDATE ITSELF. IN THAT CASE, YOU GO TO ""START"" BUTTON, CLICK ON SEARCH AND TYPE ""UPDATE"", THEN CLICK ON ""WINDOWS UPDATE"" AND LET IT DO ITS JOB, AFTER THAT, LET YOUR COMPUTER DO A REBOOT. BEFORE YOU TRY TO RUN THE GAME, YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THE DATE BACK TO THE 14TH AND TIMEZONE +8:00 (JUST IN CASE)...NOW YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. ENJOY :D"

For people having issues,time zones etc,just download the updated crack it and it fixes everything.You might have a problem with the sound but there is a sound fix here on tpb too.You can't play zombies yet as there is no crack for them nor the Multiplayer cause there are no private servers."
