,lslema,2012-11-10T04:49Z,hey just wondering if you will be uploading the rest of Puella Magi Madoka Magica if so when do you plan on it
,mooserocka,2012-11-11T20:14Z,Yea daman what are your next few uploads going to be sir? 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-11T21:38Z,"Fafner, Fafner movie, and possibly Samurai Champloo. 720p"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-12T05:27Z,"Yes i will be doing Madoka, will upload the complete series soon."
,mooserocka,2012-11-13T19:01Z,How about shangri la i have been pushing for that vividly daman. I would love it. And its a 26 episode series unlike these horrible 11 episode series. 
,mooserocka,2012-11-13T19:23Z,samurai shamploo is on netflix in english the full series. Here is my most wanted list daman.Intrigue in the Bakumatsu - Irohanihoheto this comes out november 27th I would love to see this anime. legend of heroes complete comes out december 18th.  You get stuff early sometimes so im letting you know it would be awesome if you can upload these early sir : ). Also alot of people are interested in panty stocking garterbelt or something like that im not but that would be cool to put up that release date is jan 15th. BLOOD C i gonna be AMAZING JAN 8th please put that up. Its the sequal to blood plus. Level 8 jan 11th i heard this is great too. Is this a zombie season 1 looks great that comes out december 4th i THINK. Also a certian magical index which i think you said before you are def doing that one.  also Hakuoki: season 1 is already out and i think season 2 is december. And last but not least 006 its ONLY on dvd not blu ray but it is ALREADY released like shangri la and i have heard nothing but good things. Sorry for the long list but u seem to get anime VERY early before thier release dates so if you can get ANY of them it would be awesome. THANKS DAMAN.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-14T09:51Z,"Heads up to everyone, there is a new DBZ movie in teh making called 
Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods"
,mooserocka,2012-11-15T00:28Z,So any of the animes above going to make a release earlier then the release other then panty and garterbelt?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-16T02:58Z,Blood C is nowhere near as good as Blood + but good to know its licensed by Funimation. 
,mooserocka,2012-11-16T19:13Z,Ok cool. I have just heard blood c is AWESOME. I cant wait for ALOT of them. I know you release them EARLIER then thier releases in english so the faster you get these out the better. Daman you are awesome. Blood plus is one of the better animes made. So it will be hard to top it i just want to see it bad.
,sammoloya,2012-11-19T23:31Z,so when can we get ep 9&10 or should i say IX & X
