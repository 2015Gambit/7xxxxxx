I'm so excited to see this episode. I heard its the start of Stephanie's life-celebration party and her daughters are coming back. And I hear rumors that the new Ridge might show up at some point here."

NO ONE can replace Ron Moss. But Bell says if Ron Moss doesn't decide to come back, he will be recasting the role :(

I'm still excited to see how he handles the recast though"
