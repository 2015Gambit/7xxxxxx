Imported from Argentina for U.S. release in 1967, issued on DVD by Something Weird circa 2002.  Women in a coastal town are being drugged and hypnotized by a mad fiend who wears an ugly rubber mask and plays the organ well.  Police pursue him.

Enjoy this with Vieyra's horror-sexy follow-up, La venganza del sexo (in America, THE CURIOUS DR. HUMPP).
