Brian Timothy "Tim" Finn, OBE (born 25 June 1952) is a New Zealand singer and musician.

"Tim Finn" is the self-titled album by New Zealand singer/songwriter Tim Finn. After having little success with his previous album Big Canoe, Tim signed up with Capitol Records, for which he released 3 albums.

While much of Tim's fan base regards this album as his finest accomplishment, it went largely unnoticed outside of Australia and New Zealand.

After this album, Tim & younger brother Neil decided to record a Finn Brothers album. Crowded House drummer Paul Hester was present for the demo recordings of several tracks that were eventually incorporated (along with Tim himself) into the Crowded House album "Woodface". This was Tim's second album with Capitol.

The 3rd album released on the Capitol label was "Before & After".
