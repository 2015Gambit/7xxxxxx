Arch of Triumph [1948]

In winter of 1938, Paris is crowded with refugees from the Nazis, who live in
the black shadows of night, trying to evade deportation. One such is Dr. Ravic,
who practices medicine illegally and stalks his old Nazi enemy Haake with
murder in mind. One rainy night, Ravic meets Joan Madou, a kept woman cast
adrift by her lover's sudden death. Against Ravic's better judgement, they
become involved in a doomed affair; matters come to a crisis on the day war is
declared.
