
Bending Colours pairs Jordy Smith with friend and filmmaker Kai Neville, in a new project that provides a candid look into the South African surfer's life. The film follows Jordy as he travels from one wave-rich exotic locale to another, showcasing his world-class talent -- in signature Kai Neville fashion -- with heavy doses of surf action blended with a certain element of tasteful artistic flair and set against a solid soundtrack.
