Many times when I see someone has uploaded 3D wall-papers I think YES. But until now I'm always disappointed in all uploads there never has been ONE real 3D. 
3D for me is toystory 3D, Avatar 3D, Alice in wonderland 3D etc. If there is not 3D  in the movie title, well it isn't 3D. So those who upload 3D yes maybe it was 3D in the 70's but 3D in 2012 is like this. :))
3D pictures (Anaglyph) just gr8 :)
