Could u low your resolution and graphics to the min, save it and then upload the folder here bro ? "

,FRenan,2012-11-18T20:24Z,"levin123: Yea man I checked it before, the only thing that dont match is the NVidia videocard, but I've played many games that doesn't match it before.
I have a ""dualcore Intel core 2 duo"" That means it should be able to run, right?
Recently I installed win8 32bits on my pc, many people in other torrents saying that they have the same problem are using win8. What OS do u use?
Should I get back to 7 and give it a try?  "
,levin123,2012-11-19T02:22Z,"FRenan, i'm using windows 7 64 bit.
windows 8 is really sucks where by my friends unable to play the latest games on windows 8. Furthermore, windows 8 currently is not stable yet. This is reason why i never installed windows8 on my laptop.

You can have a try or wait for the patch in future.

good luck."

,h-cat,2012-11-23T02:28Z,Black screen problem can be solved by right clicking and clicking run as administrator. worked for me when had that issue. 
,Chr0nikk,2012-11-23T11:21Z,This needs more seeders it slowed down the download at 68.0% from 750k+ to now 80k. Please seed this people so i can finish my download
,Chrono36,2012-11-29T19:23Z,It took me about a day to get this and when I finally did all I get is a black screen when I load it with admin priv. Even with the Skidrow updates I still get the black screen. I don't think this works.
,Chrono36,2012-11-29T20:52Z,Now that I looked at the min sys req and it says Intel Core2 Duo E8200 with 2GB for 32 bit OS and a  Geforce 8800 512 mb card. I have win7 ultimate 32 bit with a Intel Core2 Duo E7200 with 4GB ram and a Nvidia 9800 GT Card. So it may work for others but I think because my Processor is low it probably wont work for me..
