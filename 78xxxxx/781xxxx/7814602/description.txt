
Overview:

Become a made man as you vie for power in a Chicago-like town during the prohibition era. Gangsters is the strategy game where crime pays--and with dividends! You can don the knuckle dusters and persuade the local business owners to pay you for protection services. You can get your hands even more dirty and navigate in the cutthroat world of politics. Or simply go for the throat as you order your wiseguys to execute your enemies in the streets and show the city who's da boss. Gangsters gives you all the power you need to get things done.

Played in a vast city filled with over 5,000 individual characters, Gangsters feature real-time action in a highly detailed isometric terrain. The game sports an easy-to use strategy planning interface, to authentically recreate the seedy, violent, and ruthless world of gangland mobsters. Remember, real power is never given, it's taken!
