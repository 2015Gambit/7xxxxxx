   This is my ultimate install for classic Amiga OS that takes advantage of the
awesome power of Winuae.There are some hardware projects (mainly Natami and new
Minimig design) that promise to bring us some really powerfull new Amiga hardware.
   With this install you can surf the web,watch movies and listen to music while
you have classic Amiga software ready to run natively.I have included Whdload and
some classic games and demos.I have also included kickstarts and keyfiles and every 
single game for 040/060 Amigas worth playing.
   To use simply copy Amiga directory to root of hard drive and load supplied Winuae 
configuration file.There is also Winuae 2.4.1 included with this torrent if you need
it.
   Purpose of this torrent is to show true Amiga power because Amiga OS 4 is a bad
joke and Hyperion are vampires sucking blood of Amiga fans,Morphos is a little 
better but still not there and Aros just isn't up to the task.This is made for real
Amiga hardware chipset magic (it supports RTG/AGA/ECS/OCS) and can be used to test
coming true Amiga compatible hardware (if ever released).
   If you doubt credibility of this torrent check out the screenshots first.
