Video ....pretty good,specially considering its a dark film.Worse thing about it was the AR ,video slanted and
also now and again the video seemed to change and contained loads of noise.
Audio some nice line from jiinx AGAIN ...not his/hers best,seemed to have alot of noise and levels about all over the
place.....but still decent stuff.


WORKDONE:

Video ...i have opted to fix the perspective so heads don't seem to slant anymore...still not dead right because just to do
this i had to crop some of the video ( hence the different res etc...on this release ) and didn't want to crop anymore.
Also changed the brightness,contrast,rgb colours,sat,intes....aswell as using a HQ smoother before finally adding some
sharpness back ....

Audio ....stripped from UNiQUE's syncd release and dropped in AA,lowered the DB's by -4.5 ,then opened up the eq bands and
balanced them out better,well to what i think is better lol.Lowered a few channels right down due to the hiss in them,
before resaving as mp3 and remuxing.

Enjoy Folks! :)
