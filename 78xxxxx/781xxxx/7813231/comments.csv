,jozsus,2012-11-10T22:37Z,Why is it labeled 2008? Thanks in advanced! Been waiting all night to watch this!
,audax0311,2012-11-10T23:22Z,"@Jozsus: It's labeled 2008, because that's the year the tv show first premiered."
,jesusman82,2012-11-11T00:04Z,why do i watch this horrible show...
,WoundedWolfgirl,2012-11-11T06:36Z,"@jesusman It's not a horrible show, it's a good show. True, the pilot (and indeed, the whole first half of the first season) was bad, but it's since become a well-acted, well-written show. 
So fuck off.
Thanks, ez!"

,rainmaker7,2012-11-12T10:58Z,"This TV show is odd: the plot is simple and the budget is obviously limited, but the total experience (actor performance, execution) makes it addicting. An old good and easy-to-watch fairy tale. Highly recommeded for family evenings."
,xlemuelx,2012-11-13T14:42Z,"yep, its the acting that attracts me. "
