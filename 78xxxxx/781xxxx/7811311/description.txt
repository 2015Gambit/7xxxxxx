Book Description
Throw out your old ideas of C, and relearn a programming language thatΓÇÖs substantially outgrown its origins. With 21st Century C, youΓÇÖll discover up-to-date techniques that are absent from every other C text available. C isnΓÇÖt just the foundation of modern programming languages, it is a modern language, ideal for writing efficient, state-of-the-art applications. Learn to dump old habits that made sense on mainframes, and pick up the tools you need to use this evolved and aggressively simple language. No matter what programming language you currently champion, youΓÇÖll agree that C rocks.

- Set up a C programming environment with shell facilities, makefiles, text editors, debuggers, and memory checkers
- Use Autotools, CΓÇÖs de facto cross-platform package manager
- Learn which older C concepts should be downplayed or deprecated
- Explore problematic C concepts that are too useful to throw out
- Solve CΓÇÖs string-building problems with C-standard and POSIX-standard functions
- Use modern syntactic features for functions that take structured inputs
- Build high-level object-based libraries and programs
- Apply existing C libraries for doing advanced math, talking to Internet servers, and running databases
