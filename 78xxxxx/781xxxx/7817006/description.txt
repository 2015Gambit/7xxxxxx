Child of the Moon

Rubys fear about turning into a wolf during the
first curse-free Storybrooke full moon is
confirmed when one of the towns residents is
viciously murdered, and Ruby is the prime
suspect Decker  aka King George threatens to
expose David as a shepherd, not a prince, and
not fit to run the town as sheriff and Leroy
stumbles upon some treasure in the Storybrooke
mine that could help bring Mary Margaret and
Emma back into our world. Meanwhile, in the
fairytale land that was, Red Riding Hood finds a
kindred spirit in Anita, a charismatic and
mysterious leader of a pack of humans who, like
Red, turn out to be wolves
