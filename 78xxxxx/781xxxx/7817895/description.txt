Mark Knopfler - Berkeley 2012, october 19
-----------------------------------------

An excellent and very fresh recording from present day Mark Knopfler. This is the best I have found from 2012 (and in fact 2011 too).

All thanks to the original recorder! 
And the group "FKK"! Great job guys! Keep it up for all of us who love the music of Mark Knopfler!
Thanx again!
