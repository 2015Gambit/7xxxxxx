-NOTE-


Your anti-virus may pick up the loader as a virus. It is not.

Trust me.

Here are the instructions directly from the NFO that is in the folder.


1. Install the program.
2. Put the loader in installation folder. 
3. Execute the loader (WITH admin/privileges in Vista/Win7)
3.5 NOTE THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO RESTART THE LOADER AGAIN!! (as it's amazing) 
4. A messagebox will appear, click OK. 
5. When the trial dialog appears, click "trial" and wait few secs. 
6. Click ok and restart the loader when a messagebox appears. 
7. The trial dialog will appear again, so click "Register". 
8. Use the keygen to generate a serial and register. 
9. Restart the program WITH the loader (everytime)


Again, ALL thanks goes to Team Silence from REPT. 
I love you guys.
