i am having problem starting from step 3. I have put the loader in Getflv folder in Program Files (x86). I assume this is the installation folder right? AFterwards I execute the loader from that folder, and a dialogue box appears saying ""this is a search and replace folder please wait"" but afterwards another one appears saying the Process cant be found. WHat did I do wrong? Very desperate here. Help pleaseee :("""""

Microsoft and supporting antivirus programs work together against software piracy, so it detects keygens, patchers, and such as viruses to scare people from using such programs. (because its illegal). Dont worry about viruses here, i've never had any problems with torrents with our community of pirates! 

Remember: This is ALL ""P2P"" (peer to peer) so if theirs a virus in the torrent, the virus is also on all the computers/peers seeding it. Nobody wants a virus on their computer, so nobody will seed a torrent that is malicious. 


My review of this torrent: Clean, keygen worked fine. I'm getting a message that this version is not compatible with my flash player, but that's not the fault of the torrent.
Thanks alot IPAsuperior!"
