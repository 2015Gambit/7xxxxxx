This is an excellent self-paced course from Ivy Tech in Indiana.  It cost me $89 bucks and it's free to you.. but seriously between this and the Advanced Excel 2007 class I've uploaded here, you are going to learn things about MS Excel that few people you know.. and these classes are fun, not boring.
