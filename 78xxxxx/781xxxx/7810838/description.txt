Alrighty then. I actually thought we were missing more than five of these, but it looks like between this one, the two big torrents and the two STFmaryville got, we're only missing volumes 23 and 26. I've looked for them extensively and had no luck. So if anybody out there runs across them, or could bust out a scan of your personal copies, please upload them so us unnecessarily obsessive types can lower out blood pressure a bit.
