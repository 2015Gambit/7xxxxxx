,erraticchevy,2012-11-11T06:39Z,Sorry Mate it doesnt work like that you have to have a 3d capable monitor and even then the polarized glasses from the theater are no the same as the battery powered ones that are used at home. the have two shutters that open and close at different times faster than the eye can recognize to produce the 3d apperance basically if you want to watch in 3d go buy a ticket
