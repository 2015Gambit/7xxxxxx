Charmed #19
When a criminal threatens Paige's happy family, she looks to her past to deal with the mortal menace. Conjuring up a detective from one of her favorite noir novels, Paige creates a street smart gumshoe to help set up a sting and take down the hood. But when the fictional private dick decides he likes life outside the pages, the set up takes a dark and dangerous turn in ... Crossed, Triple-Crossed.

Charmed #20
Magical beings run amok in the streets sending the powerless into hiding. Cut off from the Elders, the Angels of Destiny, and much of the Magical Community, there is no one to turn to for help. All hope seems lost in a world in which The Charmed Ones are no longer Charmed.

Charmed #21
With Magic School's doors no longer open, Knox Academy is one of the few places on Earth that can provide a safe haven for those in need. Piper, Phoebe, and Paige must team with the staff to protect themselves and their friends from the government's modern day witch hunt that has deemed anyone like them to be the enemy.

Charmed #22
Magic gangs fight for control against government forces seriously out of their depth. Even with Piper, Phoebe, and Paige on the case, there is little they can do without their own magic. Overwhelmed and outnumbered, the side of good must hang all their hope on the single most powerful witch in the world.
