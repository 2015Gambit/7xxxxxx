Download this torrent to the incomplete folder. You should then complete the incomplete torrent

Alternatively; download the incomplete files here:

,cbiern1,2012-11-12T19:15Z,Someone please seed!! There seems to be only 1gb available for the last 24hrs. and all of us 100 leechers have shared that to death!
,sahallaba,2012-11-12T20:49Z,"I am seeding cbiern1. Please be patient, it will maybe take a couple of days to get it, but you will get it eventually. Don't worry, I never upload anything I can't seed until complete. But I expect leechers to accept that not all of us have fast uploading speed. you are getting stuff for free, please remember that"
,cbiern1,2012-11-13T02:42Z,Sorry for the impatience  and many thanks. I just thought that as more seeders completed the D/L the speeds would increase. I'm currently d/ling at .05k and u/ling whatever I've got at 450k. 0 seeds out of 52 are shown to be online. But perhaps that's just UTorrent's reporting.
