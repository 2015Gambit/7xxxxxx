Tropico 4 sees you return as El Presidente, the tyrannical
(or benevolent) dictator of the island paradise of Tropico.
The world is changing and Tropico is moving with the times -
geographical powers rise and fall and the world market is
dominated by new players with new demands and offers -- and
you, as El Presidente, face a whole new set of challenges.
If you are to triumph over your naysayers you will need to
gain as much support from your people as possible. Your
decisions will shape the future of your nation, and more
importantly, the size of your Swiss bank account.

The Internet, a New World Order, terrorists, global
financial markets and space exploration are on the rise and
pose new challenges to El Presidente and his regime in
Tropico 4: Modern Times. Old buildings and structures are
becoming obsolete and need to be upgraded or even replaced
by their modern counterparts. Cars and transportation need
modernization to meet the needs of a changing economy;
and now El Presidente can even send people to the
International Space Station! El Presidente and his ministers
must now join the war against terror and control Internet
regulation and freedom of speech on Tropico.
