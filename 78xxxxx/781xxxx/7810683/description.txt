If you recognized the picture, you are like me and the rest of the 90s Canadian teenagers coming home PALLLLOOOOOOTED (without mom and dad knowing of course) and there was never anything on tv, except HIM! And we'd all would do the same exact thing, watch it even tho it was a repeat, and wait for that one person that made you crack right up laughing every time they rotated the commercial. I never did call their number, the infomercial was sooooooo CHEESY, and his bar pickup lines were the worst, so it didnt instill a lot of confidence in their abilities to "get me laid". But lets all get nostalgic for what was on after tv was done with its airwaves back in OUR day...Sorry kiddies i dont have em all, these were the only 30 mins ones i could find, i dunno if they even put out any more and you'd have to be a die hard VHS collector with a messed up tape that rolled past your late night movie and caught him now in order to make copies of this commercial now. Basically a 1 in a million shot cuz we all editted commercials to get the most space out of our tapes. If you are one of these said people, SPEAK UP. I would love to have the full set if it exists. Even channels that are tagged his identity at various media sites dont have em. But i figured for a giggle and a laugh and a trip back in time, why not? It was a part of a LOT of peoples lifes back then.(1993ish era i believe these came out)
