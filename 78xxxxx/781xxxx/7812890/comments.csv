[V],psspss,2012-11-11T01:48Z,"are you sure this is episode 2 as episode aired on the 5th nov which means ep2 should air on the 12th
not the 10th?

and I see they re-airing season 1 as well which
could mean you get season 1 episode by mistake?

anyhow crimson has ep1 out now"
,k3nd00d,2012-11-11T02:56Z,"I am sure this is S02E02 and they aired S02E01 last Sunday (I missed it). The first season was re-edited and re-airing as Doomsday Preppers Bugged Out. I am torn whether to bother getting those or not, it is just minor differences...like snarky comments in new text on-screen."
,k3nd00d,2012-11-11T03:15Z,"Ep 1 aired on the 4th, ep 2 is scheduled to air on the 13th (see http://thetvdb.com/?tab=seasonall&id=255608&lid=7 - and other sites say the same). If you watch this episode, here it is clearly the episode titled ""Am I Nuts or Are You?"" and thus is ep 2 of season 2. I got it early because it seems to have been put on onDemand early on purpose or accidentally thinking it was ep 1."
[V],psspss,2012-11-11T06:26Z,"ok Im still downloading it.. Im sure its ep2 too now
