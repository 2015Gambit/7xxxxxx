,CNorthway,2012-11-12T04:34Z,"Hello! This is Colin Northway, the author of Incredipede. 

A few small corrections: This is not a cracked version of Incredipede because there is no DRM or copy protection on Incredipede to crack. Another minor thing, Quozzle is not a ""He"", she's a ""She"".

I respect that you might pirate my game. I have certainly pirated things in the past myself. I do hope that if you like it you will consider buying the game to support the small team that built it which will let us bring you more games in the future.

Either way, enjoy the game."

Downloading now."
,Unfawkable,2012-11-12T19:23Z,"Well, the only thing I can complain about is the soundtrack, a little too annoying for my taste, but maybe that's just me. The overall gameplay is amazing, original and unlike anything I've ever played. A bit longer levels could work too, but all in all I'd spend buck on this game just to publish and compare my solutions to others. Good work."
,dubesor,2012-11-19T10:58Z,"I will buy this as soon as it comes out on steam, since I want all my games to be on steam (for easier access on the library). Until then I try this version since I'm not sure if buying on the official site will give me a steamkey."
