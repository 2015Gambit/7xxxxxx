Wat Tyler...This is the one I enjoy listening to very much. They play a mix of everything: punk, metal, pop-punk, rockΓÇª The band is named after Wat Tyler, the leader of English Peasants' Revolt of 1381. I was introduced to them by Andrej ─î. (Ljubljana-Zalog City Crew) who released theirs "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" album cassette version in this part of the world. I saw them live at No Border Jam festival in Maribor, Slovenia back in 1999 and their performance was for me the best one I saw in two days of the festival. They were funny on stage, playing and acting and telling jokes and entertaining the crowd. Some of their humor is reflected in their CDs covers. As you can see, the cover of "Tummy - Yuppie Shaging Music" is a joke on Portishead's "Dummy" CD cover and the cover for "The Fat Of The Band" is ridiculing Prodigy's "The Fat Of The Land" CD cover.
