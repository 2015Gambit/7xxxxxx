Elmer is a window into a world where chickens have suddenly acquired the intelligence and consciousness of humans, where they can now consider themselves a race no different than browns, black or whites.  Recognizing themselves to be sentient, the inexplicably evolved chickens push to attain rights for themselves as the newest members of the human race.  Elmer tells the story of a family of chickens who lives and struggles to survive in a suddenly complicated and dangerous world.
