"It is often said that education and training are the keys to the future. They are, but a key can be turned in two directions. Turn it one way andyou lock resources away, even from those they belong to. Turn it the otherway and you release resources and give people back to themselves. To realizeour true creative potentialΓÇöin our organizations, in our schools and in our communitiesΓÇöwe need to think differently about ourselves and to actdifferently towards each other. We must learn to be creative."
