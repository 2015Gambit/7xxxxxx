C'mon.... Russians, Nicaraguans and Cubans invading and taking over the US?  Right out of a pipe dream and paranoia... A curiosity 30 years ago, RIDICULOUS nonsense today....

,Mega_troll,2012-11-10T06:31Z,everything seems like a dream until turned out to be real :-)))
,Elropo,2012-11-10T07:31Z,"It's a movie.  Some people can't get it.  

Entertainment value, not how current the political situation is at this very moment.  

Thanks YTeam"

,bobert-bobert,2012-11-10T08:26Z,"Russians were the stereotypical ""bad guys"" in US entertainment from about the 1950's until the early 1980's... in any stupid comedy, if there was a bumbling spy or villain, it was inevitably a KGB agent.

God, America has such a childish world-view.  It has barely matured from its ""good cowboy vs. bad cowboy"" movie mentality.

But I have to agree, even by 1984 standards, this was a pretty far-fetched idea.  With peace talks between the USA and USSR, the threat of war felt less and less realistic.

Also, this was the very first film to receive the ""PG-13"" rating.  lol

Thanks Yify!"
,pooploser_69,2012-11-10T10:33Z,good movie thnaks yify
,Crescendolls187,2012-11-10T11:06Z,"Thats because ""bobert-bobert"" you and like the rest of todays generation weren't born during that period of time remember its only been 22 years from 1984 since the Cuban Missile Crisis its pretty much fresh at that time and nobody want a repeat of that!"
,Elropo,2012-11-10T15:06Z,"someone has been brainwashed in school.  Not once, but three times lol"
,endoii,2012-11-12T01:37Z,"""Elropo"" that was like totally smart what you just wrote there. 
i had absolutely no idea that this is a movie! like everybody else i thought it's about how current the situation is in a very moment. especially today in the 80ies."

LOL! In relation to what country? The middle eastern countries? Korea? Russia? Japan? China?

America is marketed as tyrannical pretty much the world over. Children are raised believing that Americans are self-righteous, judgemental, and all raised with a silver spoon in their mouths.

Talking about brainwashing ...The middle east and Korea still force a large percentage of their children into military training at an early age. I'm sure that their training doesn't promote White hat-Black hat or Cowboy and Indian scenario ...

And an Invasion would definitely be RIDICULOUS. Anyone attacking the U.S. would just bomb the hell out them or hijack more planes, subways, or some other mass transit or entertainment grouping. They wouldn't be labeled as international terrorists and have worldwide sanctions be placed on them ... Not a chance. That's RIDICULOUS. Right?

Basically I'm saying you all are idiots. If you're going to trash a nation put a little thought into international views and actions.

Looking forward to the remake! Thanks for the up!"
