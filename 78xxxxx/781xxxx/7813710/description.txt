"Traveling in time and space across the Arctic, in The big Thaw Ed Struzik describes at first hand the most alarming environmental crisis of our times,. It's a land that Struzik is passionate about, and he writes of its frozen beauty with an elegance of prose not seen since Barry Lopez' Arctic Dreams." - Tim Flannery, author of The Weather Makers
"The top of the world is profoundly different than ever before in human history. Climate change is already influencing the lives of the locals, from Inuit to polar bears. But it's poised to make life hard for the rest of us, too. Ed Struzik gives a canny and compelling tour of a world in dangerous and rapid flux." - Bill McKibben, author of Deep Economy
