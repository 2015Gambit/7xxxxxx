Thanks so much."
,JDizzle0420,2012-11-12T05:10Z,Same as above. Been stuck at 69% for about 24 hours. Thanks for this...
,cdigi1,2012-11-12T06:51Z,i third that notion. thanx sooo much cuz i've been waiting/hoping for someone else to put this up. now....praying this goes thru.
,suckit74,2012-11-12T13:39Z,"Stuck at 45,9%. This torrent is worse than the other one. Bad try."
,pustuleo,2012-11-12T15:17Z,"Thanks for the Up, but im stuck at 69%. "
,Gay4Robots,2012-11-12T16:24Z,Seed You Fuckers Seed!!!!
,dlfjdlq,2012-11-12T16:45Z,"at this point, i'm the only seeder. give this torrent some time and you all will be able to download at faster rate once it reaches 5 or more seeders and please don't hit and run. my advice is to give high preference to one of the four files."
,Gay4Robots,2012-11-12T18:26Z,Once i'm done downloading(hopefully today) will seed for a couple of months but right now now i'm stuck at 69.7 percent 
,JDizzle0420,2012-11-12T20:49Z,Its moving slowly buy surely. A few hours ago it was stuck at 58% now its stuck at 82%. It says it has 13 seeders? Guess itll get done one day lol...
,Gay4Robots,2012-11-13T00:04Z,Been downloading for 20 hours and still only at 90% (and b4 any1 says it's my internet i usually get 1.1 to 1.4 mb a second so f off) plz seed i always seed after downloading this is ridiculous
,Waxie,2012-11-13T01:44Z,"been downloading for 2-3 days aswell, but i've seeded 80gb and will continue to seed for a while with my 100/100 when its done"
,Waxie,2012-11-13T01:50Z,"almost 100% now, im seeding like a madman :D"
,westside17,2012-11-13T02:46Z,Stuck at 97% .. you've gotta be kidding me.
,bigred1022,2012-11-13T03:28Z,"99.3% and 4 pieces left?!  COME ON!!  I can't get 1 single seeder?!  But to everyone that is also in this ""wonderful"" situation.  Once I'm done (if that happens), I'm going to crank up my upload speed for you all.  And this is coming from someone who doesn't really seed to long.  This has been a huge hassle but I'm gonna help you guys."
,JDizzle0420,2012-11-13T03:39Z,Took almost 24 hours but its done. Thanks...
,bigred1022,2012-11-13T03:40Z,DONE!!!  I just set my upload speed to unlimited so have at it people.  I usually get 2.5mb up.  I'm gonna let this run for a long time.
,JDizzle0420,2012-11-13T04:34Z,Same here Bigred. Its not even been an hour yet and Im 8.5 GBs uploaded...
