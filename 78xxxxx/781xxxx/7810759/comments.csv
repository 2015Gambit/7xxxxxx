,extreme_one,2012-11-10T06:03Z,I have said it again and I am repeating it. These TUF files are 2 large. Upload smaller versions instead
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-10T06:11Z,"@extreme_one 
And I will say THIS again: don't download if you don't like it, or simply download the 480p versions."
,Nimh,2012-11-10T06:23Z,"@ Extreme_one: 

It's large because it's 60fps. Usually the uploader has 30fps versions.    I wouldnt care but i'm on ADSL2+ connected at 10 to 11000mb but sually get 7 - 800kB p/s. 

Impatient plus we don't need 60fps of the pink mohawk ""LET ME BANG BRO"" faggot. "
,Nimh,2012-11-10T06:24Z,"forgot to say, thanks Sec!"
,ZWEMG,2012-11-10T06:26Z,"But if you look in general what this dude uploads, then you would see that EVERYTHING he's done is nothing but HUGE files.....so I don't understand how one person is going to change his ways or his mind."
,Nimh,2012-11-10T06:29Z,"test: why can't you see latest posts for at least 10-15 minutes, unless you post?"

,Prabath1234,2012-11-10T07:47Z,"@plockness

you must have powerful machine to play TS 60fps file,At least a core2duo with a minimum of 4gb ram and 1gb vga"
,Sick3r,2012-11-10T09:13Z,Prabath1234 What about 6 core cpu and 32 gb ram? Can I? lol
,Prabath1234,2012-11-10T09:55Z,"@Sick3r Don't boast noob.

,injectr,2012-11-10T10:04Z,"@ Sick3r

No, you cant.  You need a video card as well =)"
,theo23rd,2012-11-10T17:34Z,"Thanks, mate. Great uploads. 

@ extreme one: you are a total douche."
,GD3.1,2012-11-10T21:01Z,60fps is worth the large file size imo
,theo23rd,2012-11-10T22:26Z,@ plockness: download the VLC player.
