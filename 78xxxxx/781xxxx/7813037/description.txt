Starring Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt. A New York police sargeant unwittingly takes in a young IRA gunrunner sought by authorities. A growing friendship is violently strained as the arms deal goes bad and a British authority shows up in pursuit of the IRA soldier.  Excellent performances from Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford, with Treat Williams in the bad-guy roll.
