Robot Chicken - Season 6 - Episode 9 (WEB-DL - MP4)
---------------------------------------------------

Robot Chicken is back for its Sixth Season of hilariously insane, wackadoodle,
totally off the wall stop-motion animation! This season's 20 brand spankin' new
episodes will flash images across your retinas and flood your brains with an
overabundance of mind-melting pop culture spoofery that will most likely cause
your head to explode and leave a stain on the couch that will never come out (sorry Mom)!

Produced by Williams Street, ShadowMachine, Sony Pictures and Stoopid Monkey.

This is how we imagine Dora the Explorer's Quinceanera going; You'll see why the
Angry Birds got so angry; The writers bring Thomas the Tank Engine to an explosive end.
