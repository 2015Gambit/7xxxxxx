[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-13T01:19Z,"Just as HDTV (16:9) as EVERY ENTRY of this ep, all of which are labeled HDTV.

You see where I pre-screen it? Well, went back and checked and it seems perfectly in sync to me.

However, I cannot tell how every piece of hardware and software in the known universe might be affected, but there being only one sync complaint suggests the problem might be on your end.

What are you using?

[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-13T01:46Z,"Just so you know - I take ""out of sync"" complaints very seriously.

Closing in on my 500th upload here, I've had two such so far.

One was an ep of ""Elementary"" and when two comments showed up agreed, I looked into it and sure enough, the audio was delayed about 150ms, don't know why but now specifically check for such things. This minor delay is easy to miss unless on the lookout (or have downloaders with a keen sense for such things).

The other one was my Mini of the most recent ""Real Time"" and with two complaints I asked for info and found that the problem was with XBMX & VLC. The problem turned out to be that I automatically let a program set the exact frame rate (to keep it in sync). So, I fixed the problem and re-uploaded it and so far (fingers crossed), no further complaints.

So, I am perfectly willing to work with you on the problem you're having, but jsut the statement by itself with no info on your device / software does me no good whatsoever.

[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-13T02:06Z,"Went to wikipedia to see their definition of ""HDTV"" and sure enough, it has to be at least 720p to be correctly considered HDTV.

However, the seemingly universal convention here calls anything 16:9 HDTV.

The biggest releaser of TV shows here are RGs from ""The Scene"" and typically they release MP4 files of 720x404 and ALL are labeled HDTV.

So, while technically correct, by convention - it's a nit-pick that simply won't wash.

But we all have ""I know I'm correct and the entire universe is wrong"" moments. I think possessive pronouns should have the apostrophe that regular nouns enjoy. I also think ""nucular"" is an absurd word - but now that it's almost universally known and used - it should be accepted by dictionaries. My definition would be ""deliberate mispronunciation to identify oneself sd a Bushy"" (therefore deliberately ignorant). But I don't win any of these arguments.
