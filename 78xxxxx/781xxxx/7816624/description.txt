Fakofbolan are one of the best punk oi! bands from Croatia, they come from the town of Pula (hotbed of punk) and this is their last album. They still exist doing great shows but I'm bored with it. Check out this release tho, it's on Zvuk Mo─ìvare, short lived label that got killed by Croatian version of RIAA. I suppose they didn't like the band making their own cd with a help of some friends.
