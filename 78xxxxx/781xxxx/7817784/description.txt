Description: Over the last 40 years video games have become a critical form of entertainment throughout the world. As the games have grown to be more sophisticated and realistic, video game music has also evolved; from the simple bleeps of arcade shoot-em-ups to todayΓÇÖs robust orchestrations, written for complex action or adventure titles on platforms like Xbox, Playstation and Nintendo.

Responding to the popularity and the massive feedback to The Greatest Video Game Music a sequel was recorded. This time having fans from all over the world vote for their favorite video game theme.
