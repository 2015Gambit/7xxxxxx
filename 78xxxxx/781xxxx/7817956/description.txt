ST!llness (Stillness) are a band from town of Split in Croatia. They mix all kinds of influences, and lyrics are reflecting that. Themes range from personal to politics (singer's mother, state of society, etc.). The name of the album comes from this guy that picks documentaries on HRT (Croatian state TV) stating that "all they learned in life was picked by Djelo Hadjiselimovic".
