Doom And Gloom
Single (2012)


The Rolling Stones celebrate their 50th anniversary with GRRR!, a compilation available in several different formats. The simplest set is a triple-disc compilation containing 50 tracks; there is also a Deluxe Edition containing the same three CDs, along with a hardcover book and five postcards. These 50 tracks also form the basis of a bound vinyl box set, but the Super Deluxe Edition box set is an 80-track, four-disc set with a different track sequencing, a bonus 7" single, a hardcover book, and a poster. In each incarnation, GRRR! traces the rich history of the Rolling Stones from their first single, "Not Fade Away," to a pair of new songs ("Gloom and Doom," "One Last Shot") recently recorded with Don Was.
