From the IMDb:  "A cautionary tale. At 17, Sherman Oaks high schooler Pam Banner has a baby out of wedlock. The baby is adopted, but Pam's too embarrassed to go back to school, so her dad gets her a job as the receptionist for a talent agent. A rock star takes her to a party, seduces and abandons her; that starts a spiral of partying, free love, and drug use. Pam becomes friends with Jeannie, a hooker who supports Jimmy, a useless druggie. Soon the three of them are living together, and Jimmy seems appealing to Pam. She's missing work more and more often, Jeannie wants out of the life, Jimmy is going through withdrawal, and Pam is in the middle of a maelstrom. Is there any exit for Pam?

Can't add much more to that except to comfort viewers with assurances that the film features a Narrator, a lecture on childbirth with birth-of-a-baby film footage, images of the disgusting effects of untreated venereal diseases, and other examples of tastelessness. The story and the "informative" stuff are intertwined, which takes the steam out of the drama but makes for a very memorable viewing experience. If you see only one motion picture this year, it must be: THE HARD ROAD (1970).
