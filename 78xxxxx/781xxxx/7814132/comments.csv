,BearTrapHarold,2012-11-11T06:27Z,"any chance you have wildcats v5, and also looking for mega man comics thanks if you do and if ya dont and thanks for this hellblazer"
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-11T07:12Z,"Funny you should ask about WildCATS.  They're next on my list.  I was going to upload oldest to newest instead of latest to earliest like I did with Cyberforce because I'm missing a few issues in v5 and I was hoping to find them soon.  Once I find them, I'll upload WildCATS v5.

I also have some Mega Man comics that I'll upload.  Let me search for some missing issues first.

I am also planning on uploading Judge Dredd - The Complete Case Files (3 GB) because there have been some requests."
