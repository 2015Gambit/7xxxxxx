All praise is due to Allah who filled with love and glorification the hearts of His beloved servants (Awliya), and removed from the hearts of others His recognition and appreciation.
I testify that there is no God worthy of worship except One, Allah, with whom I associate no partners. With love and reverence we worship Him, and in fear and longing we invoke His name. I testify that Muhammad is his servant, Prophet, His own beloved, best chosen and most trusted for His revelation, was sent down by Allah to save the human soul from self-indulgence and degradation, connecting it to the one who created the heavens and the earth. He was, by all means, a role model, and his message was a mercy and guidance for all mankind, giving them glad tidings and saving them from oppression. Peace and blessings be upon him.

Short Description: The author says in his introduction, ┬½The aim of this booklet is to educate new Muslims about laws that pertain to non-Muslims in matters of Aqeedah (creed) and Fiqh (Jurisprudential Law) and the stance one should acquire from them, and how he should interact with non-Muslims in his country, and other related issues. I have written this in response to the request of the brothers from Sulai DaΓÇÖwah Office in Riyadh who felt it was important to clarify these rulings to new Muslims in a concise and inclusive way.┬╗
