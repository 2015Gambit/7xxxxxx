Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, November 9 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers fallout from the 2012 election, including charges of massive vote fraud and uncounted ballots in Florida and Ohio. 

Alex also takes a look at startling polls that reveal many Americans passively accept TSA grope-downs with sheep-like resignation and the prospect of wearing electric shock bracelets in order to fly. 

Alex talks with Rep. Ron Paul about Obama's re-anointment and the economic implosion now slowly taking out the pinions of the once mighty U.S. economy.
