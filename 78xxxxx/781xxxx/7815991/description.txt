Made with the cooperation of Carl Barks. This book details the ancestry of Scrooge; how he made his fortune; how he kept hold of his fortune; a bibliography of Barks' writings about Scrooge; and notes about the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell, Flintheart Glomgold, some lesser villains, as well as portraying Scrooge as a villain at times. Everything is referenced to the comic which it was taken from. Jack L. Chalker had originally wanted this book to be illustrated, but Disney would not give permission.
