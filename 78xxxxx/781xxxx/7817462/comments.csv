,dudelove420,2012-11-14T03:03Z,Why is it I can never play your files anymore? They always show up as a white folders and I know it isn't a rar file. i checked for latest update as well and still nothing. this is like the 3rd movie recently and I am quite surprised because your torrents are usually top quality.

this is the first time I've had this happen for an ez up, but for some reason it didn't download as a video for me either

you need to change the file extension name so that it ends in "".avi"" and should work fine after"
