Try putting the .jar in a separate folder / deleting older ftb related folders, files / launching it again after it has downloaded everything"
,BloodravenD,2012-11-12T14:44Z,thanks for uploading this...it's such a pain when modpack authors do this.
,BloodravenD,2012-11-12T15:48Z,"okay, I ran it in a fresh folder and it didn't run.  I did find a work around though.  All you have to do is get the modpack files then put them in a fresh .minecraft folder, 1.4.2 minecraft of course.  Then you take the forge.zip and put the files into the minecraft.jar file."
