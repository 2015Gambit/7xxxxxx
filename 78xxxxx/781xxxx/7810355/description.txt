This is a kit for reflashing firmware on a KRZR k1m phone sold with a Verizon subscription to unlock hidden features such as USB tethering, hidden settings, and information screens useful for hacking and modding. The new firmware was dumped from a less restricted Alltel phone.

If you still receive service on this phone, I can't guarantee that you will be able to keep using the service.  Keep your SIM card in just in case.  There is also a possibility of bricking your phone, but it didn't happen to me after many failed attempts.  Back up anything important for this reason.

Includes:

PK2 driver
RSD Lite
K1m firmware
