A very exciting split debut album from Mythoklash & Unimates.




During downtime in the fall of 2006, The band Mythoklash was formed by an unidentified Quebec Terrorist group. Their singers and guitarists (who later inspired the song name "everybody rock now"), recorded this album material from a radio machine. The songs on this recording would have appeared on their first full-length album, but the material got lost during a horrible bomb accident explosion. It was recently rediscovered and restored by dr Swiz at www.swizland.com 

Unimates was formed by the survivors of the horrible bomb accident. 
And the recording on the album was left outside dr Swiz door in a brown paperbag.
