The Ranger Handbook is mainly written for U.S. Army Rangers and other light Infantry units, however it should also serve as a handy reference for other U.S. military units as it contains a summary of other manuals such as FM 6-22 (FM 22-100), FM 3-21.8 (FM 7-8), FM 3-21.10 (FM 7-10), FM 3-90, FM 3-55.93 (FM 7-93). It covers how Infantry squad- and platoon-sized elements conduct combat operations in varied terrains. It cites other Army resources to ensure continuity.

This handbook provides squad and platoon leaders with the roles, tactics, knowledge, and operational requirements to employ combat multipliers in a combat environment.
