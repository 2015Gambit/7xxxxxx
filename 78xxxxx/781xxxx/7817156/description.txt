The History of Walter T. Foster
More than 80 years ago, Mr. Walter T. Foster proved you can accomplish anything you can dream! Having painted signs, sold hog medicine, performed in a stage act -- and invented the postage-stamp vending machine -- Mr. Foster turned to publishing. The "how to" art books he wrote, illustrated, printed, bound, packaged, and shipped on his own soon grew in popularity, and Mr. Foster became well known for proving that anyone can learn to draw. Today the Walter Foster Publishing company carries on the tradition, developing books and kits that encourage creativity and spark imaginations.
