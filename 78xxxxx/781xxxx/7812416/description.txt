In an age of darkness in the bowels of history, the gods gathered to fight the evils spreading across the land. Anubis, the Lord of the Necropolis, was chosen to bestow a portion of his might upon a worthy champion. The Anubis Warrior's powers passed from champion to champion throughout the ages until the evil was vanquished. And then those powers slumbered. When a young man discovers an amulet deep within a pyramid in Egypt, he is drawn into the struggle of the gods - as the threats from the past return to reclaim the planet once more - as this age's first Anubis Warrior!
