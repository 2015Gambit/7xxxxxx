Keep playing then :D I just removed the launcher update window, which would overwrite the crack, and someone was complaining about IOException so that's gone as well."

Nice, but can you tell me how did you decompile it, i have been trying but giving me some strange errors  like chinese characters"
,DevTron6,2012-11-14T01:57Z,Just wondering are you going to update this?
,silkooy,2012-11-14T11:09Z,"@mini890 I got the source files from github, didn't have to decompile
@DevTron6 Probably, too lazy atm though"

Nice, Thanks.

But could you please tell me how did you cracked it, I would update it and giving you credit of course. Most for me to learn because I have been strugling with it"
,ExoticSenta,2012-11-14T14:56Z,"Works gr8 !
could u tell me what file do i need to edit after the update so it works again ? "
,warri0r13,2012-11-16T00:42Z,"Cracking the client is actually more work, than editing just one file, so please stop asking for instructions. We won't update for every tiny release, but when there are major changes to the launcher or when we are extremely bored :D."
,mini890,2012-11-16T08:44Z,I just wanted to update to launcher 1.0.5 because it added Buildcraft and a few others mod that I can't remember
,silkooy,2012-11-16T10:59Z,1.0.6: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7831359
,warri0r13,2012-11-16T17:25Z,"@mini890
The modpack updates separately from the launcher.
I tested this version and also version 0.3.1. I got all the same mods that I have in the most updated launcher."
