,timwmac,2012-11-12T18:41Z,"Personally I would rate this as V-9, A-7"
,timwmac,2012-11-12T21:00Z,As soon as I receive comments that are positive I have over 500 more to load. This is a trial run
,rajakumar,2012-11-12T23:55Z,"Hi:

upload Screenshots first, and also so can u please upload in smaller size i.e 300mb to 500mb. "
,chonchboi,2012-11-13T00:23Z,"just a question...why did you split the movie into 2 parts?  although I appreciate any upload, why not just make it as one?"
,chonchboi,2012-11-13T00:31Z,seed bitches
,timwmac,2012-11-13T01:18Z,"As I said, my first try. All the rest will be one file. Split because I could take time to make sure it was the best version out there. now I know how, all the rest will be one complete movie. thanks for the comments. lets me know what to improve on."
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T02:28Z,"No info on ts or cam source. What is your video format, is it avi or mkv or mp4? I have this movie requested in some of uploaders in their posts for to upload in smaller rip size because 1.46gb and 2.27gb files are not worth for cam or ts release. "
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T02:29Z,Can u compress your 2 parts to one small size because everyone out there are looking in smaller file and fast download speeds.
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T02:34Z,"@timwmac:
so did u watch this movie from your own source, then how is audio and video on this movie. Do u know any other uploader who can make movies in smaller rip size in 500 mb not more than 1 gb."
,sea13wm,2012-11-13T05:15Z,"screenshots arent hard mate, and saves a lot of risk for the weary people.. thnx in advance"
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T18:12Z,"@timwmac: please post the screenshots of this movie, so everybody would understand."
,timwmac,2012-11-13T23:47Z,"And only a bigger Moron would bitch about something without checking it first. Bitch all you want, still one of the Best Copies out there."
,svalley,2012-11-15T14:17Z,"Yesterday, upon the bay stair,
I saw a movie which wasnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t there
It wasnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t there again today
I wish, I wish it would go away...

(But, in case you ARE trying to upload this movie: good effort, try again! :-) )"
