,suprimat,2012-11-11T17:03Z,"I never thought that a low budget movie will impress me so much.
Very good movie. Thank you for sharing."
,babybluetits24,2012-11-11T19:29Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1824904/ no imdb score yet $750k budget

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 317 seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! ) if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent /bittorent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please google it then copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out , ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc ,also copy & paste this comment onto a Word document or Openoffice (which is free) & keep spreading the message on every torrent you look at ..we must get more people to help out , theres too many hit & runners who never comment or add links etc :( "

,TheCrowdGoesWild,2012-11-12T11:06Z,"LOL @ blah blah blah blah

Why do people feel the need to post the IMDB link in the comments? Do they presume that the rest of us are stupid and are unable to click the link in the video description? Or are they just wannabe good samaritan dumb shits themselves?"
,vampzcore,2012-11-12T14:23Z,thanks!!
,greend20,2012-11-13T00:58Z,"Zip your lip TheCrowdGoesWild. Same to you Coffeeman2cups. babybluetits24 is just performing a service us. I like it when a comment contains the hyperlink. Even though with most browsers you can just copy and right-click and open in new window or tab, I still appreciate someone who throws up a hyperlink of the Imdb info. Show some respect children. "
,wizzard4all,2012-11-13T02:46Z,"The PROBLEM here folks, is idiots blaming seeds (or lack thereof) for their poor internet connection. As long as there are 10 or more seeds, I can DL a movie in under 1/2 hour. Quit blaming others because you have crappy internet!
As far as seeding back, we should all try to seed at 2:1, sharing twice what we take."
,wizzard4all,2012-11-13T02:49Z,"This movie, however, is NOT in English. It is dubbed with a foreign language track, sounds like Japanese, but I cannot be certain."
,charlene17,2012-11-14T01:58Z,"Japanese, come on... More like malaysian, indonesian...
Anyway I was afraid to be the only one with the english audio language and this real one ! "
