F.A.Q.S:

1.The first and most important: the more the assembly includes additions, the more it becomes demanding on hardware.

2.Install The Sims Store - optional (see the third screen installer)
 
3.Before installing, remove any previously installed versions of the game, after making back-up the save in the folder "Documents  Electronic Arts  The Sims 3"
 - 
4.Additional content from the Store in the game is not labeled, ie Store items in front of it is not necessary any notation.
 - 
5.Starting with the 1.29 patch, the developers have introduced the possibility popkupki items from in-game Store. To the price tags in the game not zadalbyvali - change settings (Settings -> tab "General" -> uncheck "Enable Number")

6.The proposal to set up an account in SimPort - refuse.

7.Objects are used to draw graphics power, respectively the more powerful graphics card, the better.
Also suggested that the game should set the resolution is the same as the desktop resolution. Ie if the desktop resolution - 1920x1080 - put the same in the game.

8.And most importantly - to disable Active protection from antivirus - game performance will increase significantly.

9.If you decide not to install the Sims Store of the hand, and install the additions and fashion - it is recommended to install a utility Repacker, and not through the standard launcher.
Well as ensure that your add-ons and fashion does not conflict with each other or with the additions to the game.
