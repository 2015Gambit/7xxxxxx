A short, sleek novel of encounters set in Tokyo during the witching hours between midnight and dawn, and every bit as gripping as Haruki MurakamiΓÇÖs masterworks The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and Kafka on the Shore.

At its center are two sistersΓÇöEri, a fashion model slumbering her way into oblivion, and Mari, a young student soon led from solitary reading at an anonymous DennyΓÇÖs toward people whose lives are radically alien to her own: a jazz trombonist who claims theyΓÇÖve met before, a burly female ΓÇ£love hotelΓÇ¥ manager and her maid staff, and a Chinese prostitute savagely brutalized by a businessman. These ΓÇ£night peopleΓÇ¥ are haunted by secrets and needs that draw them together more powerfully than the differing circumstances that might keep them apart, and it soon becomes clear that EriΓÇÖs slumberΓÇömysteriously tied to the businessman plagued by the mark of his crimeΓÇöwill either restore or annihilate her.

After Dark moves from mesmerizing drama to metaphysical speculation, interweaving time and space as well as memory and perspective into a seamless exploration of human agencyΓÇöthe interplay between self-expression and empathy, between the power of observation and the scope of compassion and love. MurakamiΓÇÖs trademark humor, psychological insight, and grasp of spirit and morality are here distilled with an extraordinary, harmonious mastery.
