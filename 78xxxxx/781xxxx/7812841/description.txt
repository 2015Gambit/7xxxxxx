Plot: The original, traditional, one-hundred-percent, red-blooded, two-fisted, All-American Christmas continues five years later with Ralphie, Randy, mom and the Old Man. When 15 year-old Ralphie accidentally wrecks his dream car before even getting it off the lot, he and his friends Flick and Schwartz band together to raise the money to fix it by Christmas Eve – before the car dealer tells the Old Man. They all get their (first!) jobs, but run into trouble at every turn. When things look most bleak, Ralphie finds the true meaning of Christmas with the help of his family and his friends.
