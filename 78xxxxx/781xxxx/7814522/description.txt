In 1986, DC decided to write off the Justice Society Of America from active continuity.  A one-shot issue entitled, The Last Days of the Justice Society Special 1, involved most of the JSA battling the forces of evil, while merged with the Norse gods, in an ever-repeating Ragnarok-like Limbo.  This fantastic story was written by Roy Thomas, with art by David Ross and Mike Gustovich.  Only Power Girl, The Star-Spangled Kid, The Spectre and Dr. Fate escaped this cataclysm.  (This was later revealed to be a simulation created by Odin searching for a way to thwart the real Ragnarok.)
