Yeah, it's seams the patch skins has some compatibility issues that we don't know how to narrow down. You're the 2nd user that can't work out a solution. If I ever crack the v5.5, I should change the skin to something simpler...

Anyways, I will help you. Create a dummy email and post the adress so I can contact you."

,xferatu,2012-11-18T23:26Z,Is there anyway to do a trial reset to be able to use the latest beta version? Many games that just come out have problems with older versions.
,Johnny_Rook,2012-11-19T20:10Z,"@xferatu
You can use the BETAS' game profiles with v5.4...

All I can say is that the method I found and used to crack the v5.4 will work with v5.5 and BETAS as long as the developers don't change the code, of course.
That said, you have my permission to use the same method to crack it by yourself."
,rosssssin,2012-11-22T03:41Z,"Question. first thanks to Johny for effeort and spirit of sharing!!Makes the world magical places broes like this! Now can anyone figure this: i instal and when i open the patch it tells me that it cannot patch because the software is 'in use'  (which is not) and it invites me to close it and then retry. I had the exact same problem, with same looking patcher on completely different prog yesterday.I have to desactivate some process running in the background but don't know which. Thanks for attention!"

Are you applying the pacth as Administrator?

Try rebooting the PC or closing the ""explorer"" process (explorer.exe). To open it again, Start -> Run -> Explorer"
,Johnny_Rook,2012-11-22T11:06Z,"To open ""Explorer"" from ""Task Manager"" go to ""File"" -> ""New task (run...)"" and type ""explorer"""
