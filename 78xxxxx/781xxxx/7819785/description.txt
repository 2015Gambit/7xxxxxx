I'm aware of the claims that my files have virus,

trojans or whatever malware but, as I really care 

about my reputation and credibility of my work, I

had a virus scan made today to the .7z I uploaded

The results are as follows:

SHA256:	0e08d78fd9c7f7a6d222b0f8ffff67ed3aa2403fd1a0af7c34d1a51029193d0a
SHA1:	69398106fea58598cf058f6e98b548827ea2b791

As you can see, there are a few engines that report

the files as having some kind of malware. This is

absolutely normal when the hack tool dUP2 is used.

Therefore, FALSE-POSITIVES.

I think the subject is now crystal clear to everbody

Thanks.
