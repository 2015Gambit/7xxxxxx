Hi:

Screenshots looking good, so can u please upload in smaller size i.e 300mb to 500mb."
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-12T21:59Z,"Yes.... No reason for anything to be over 700MB. (except perhaps a very long sci-fi flick, e.g. Star Wars, where there is lots of detail, stars, etc.)"
,timwmac,2012-11-12T23:15Z,No Offense but mine is better. Nice upload though. Mine is smaller also!
,tverlaine,2012-11-12T23:47Z,timwmac-the size of your file is 0 mb's -no offense there is nothing there-also pretty hard to beat the one's that are out today-Thanks to the uploaders.
,.Leto.,2012-11-13T00:23Z,"""new audio"", it's not new, they just tweaked it a bit.
 But it's still horrible. Even with earphones I could barely understand half of the dialogues. Video is great though."
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T00:28Z,"@michaelrwatson:

I agree with u, it's a Cam ts release. so it is better to compress the whole movie to smaller size."
,crumrugin,2012-11-13T00:28Z,This torrent is obsolete the UNIQUE copy is WAY better actually may be a TS sound is great on that I have both
