Book Description

This practical book gets you up to speed on the language, libraries, and tools for developing structured, fast, and maintainable web apps that run in most browsers.

- Create, launch, and debug web and command-line apps with the Dart Editor
- Get a tour of Dart libraries, including dart:core, dart:html, dart:isolate, dart:io, and dart:json
- Become familiar with tools such as Dartium, the Chromium-based browser that includes the Dart virtual machine
