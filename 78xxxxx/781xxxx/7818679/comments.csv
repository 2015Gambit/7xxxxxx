,teliapappi,2012-11-13T19:55Z,it does not work
,Bean-Bandit,2012-11-14T18:32Z,Look for version that use a patcher instead.
,JetsetJoey,2012-11-14T20:27Z,"Would someone implement the .exe replacement method versus the .dll method?!?

To anyone looking for a viable alternate, DVDFab version 9.0.0.4 beta by uploader Rise DOES work!

This .dll is just another dud..."
,Bean-Bandit,2012-11-14T21:28Z,"Actually use this one instead. It's 8.2.0.0 and it uses the .exe replacement.

,Halloweenpsycho,2012-11-16T04:35Z,"i am unsure as to why others seem to be having issues with this..Not syaing that those that are, maybe having mental issues..But it is wiered that i have never ever had a issue with any of ChattChitto uploads. ChattChitto has been a very well respected uploader on TBP for a long time. ChattChitto has always released quality uploads..SO if you have a issue with somthing from ChattChitto, then maybe you should check your steps, and recheck them again..Thanks loads for the up ChattChitto :)"

I've used many of ChattChitto's programs in the past with no issue at all but this program simply does not want to work on my system. The dll crack does not work for myself and some others. And no i don't have to ""check my steps"" because i know what i'm doing. I tried cracking this programs multiple times and it NEVER worked. You'd be surprised at the lengths i went to get it to work and it didn't. Here's my bit of advice for you since you were so kind as to share your wisdom with us. Don't assume that everyone who is having a problem with this is somehow mental or stupid just because it's working for you and not for us. We're not all brain-dead morons so save your fucking not-so-veiled insults for people who deserve it.

P.S. If you couldn't figure it out. ChattChitto isn't the problem the crack is."

I do believe you :) but sadly this problem your facing and few others isn't happening to me on any of my 4 systems. Therefor i can not troubleshoot the problem and make the fix.
I would like to ask anyone who is facing this problem and has an account on our site to PM me, this way i can communicate with him/her and work on the fix.
Thanks :)"

Reason for doing a clean uninstall of DVDFab is because some times programs can get files that become corrupt and when you do a normal uninstall of DVDFab there are files and folders that are left behind and when you go to re-install DVDFab and you are still having trouble with the program not running right, it may be caused by DVDFab using the files that was left behind which may be corrupt.

How to do a Clean uninstall of DVDFab Platinum/Gold
Uninstall DVDFab like you normally do, next open My Computer and go to c:Program Files (OR) where ever you installed DVDFab and delete the DVDFab folder....now close Program Files

Since you are already have your ""C"" drive open go to ""Documents and Settings OWNER"" and open the ""HIDDEN FOLDER"" called ""Application Data""...now go all the way down the list to ""PCOUFFIN"" that was left behind when DVDFab was uninstalled and delete the pcouffin( NOTE ) there are 4 entries for the pcouffin delete ""ALL 4""....close documents and settings

Now the last thing you want to do in your ""C"" drive is to open ""c:WINDOWS PREFETCH"" and delete the boot-up file for DVDFab (better known as the "".pf "" file
it will look something like this DVDFAB(PLATINUM or GOLD)3080.EXE- # # # # # # # #.pf (NOTE)where 3080 is the version number and where # is a number and or letter (string of 8 total ( NOTE ) delete all entries for DVDFAB.....close the ""C"" drive

Now open ""My Documents"" and delete the DVDFab Folder (AND) the ""PCSETUP"" Folder ...now close my documents

Empty the Recycle Bin and for the last two steps DO in order
1st.... Do a Registry Clean up using ""REGSEEKER"" or what ever you use
2nd... Defrag your whole system
NOW Reboot and re-install DVDFab (NOTE) DO NOT USE the old download file of DVDFab that you have had on your computer ""COULD be Corrupt RE-DOWNLOAD a new copy of the file to use"
