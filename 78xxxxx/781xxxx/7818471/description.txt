PATRIOCRACY explores the extreme polarization in America that cripples the country from tackling its most serious problems. Whether it's the national debt, healthcare reform, the war on terror or illegal immigration, Americans are shouting at each other instead of listening to each other.

PATRIOCRACY drills down and illustrates the forces that drive a wedge into the middle ground of America and the solutions required to move forward. Americans are polarized and angry. In the crossfire, the loudest voices drown out reason and facts with fear and anxiety.

As America enters the 2012 election season, more money than ever will be spent to manipulate and sway voters by fear and emotion. PATRIOCRACY sits in the dead center of this monumental tug-of-war, educating viewers so they do not fall victim to manipulation as they cast their ballots.
