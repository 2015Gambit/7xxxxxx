,HerrNiIsson,2012-11-10T10:12Z,In december they are releasing this awesome movie on blu-ray!!!! It's a dream come true for me!
,echo987,2012-11-10T10:40Z,"HerrNiIsson, I've been waiting for the Blu-Ray for about four years now. There are rips of the Australian release that's already out floating around somewhere. There's also an old HDTV release but the quality isn't too great."
