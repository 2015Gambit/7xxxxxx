You can't defend against what you can't see coming. In Hitman Absolution, you can use Agent 47's masterful skills to eliminate targets with anything you can find and in any way you can imagine. The black-suited assassin returns for his hardest contract yet in a story that sends him through a world overflowing with corruption. Activate new Instinct Mode to sense where enemies lurk before you enter a room, plot escape routes, or sharpen your focus to experience firefights in slo-mo. Stay one step ahead of the police as you take down your enemies with cold-blooded stealth or overwhelming firepower, just try not to splatter anything on that crisp white shirt.
