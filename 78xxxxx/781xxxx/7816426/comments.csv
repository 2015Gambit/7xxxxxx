,tpb_4_ever,2012-11-13T20:29Z,"Hose those who are having problem pwering the engine:

This only happens if you use this addon on Railworks 3, because railworks 4 uses different scripts for engine simulation.

To solve this problem:

1. Extract this addon files in a temporary folder.
2. Search all the files by extension .out at the end
3. Rename all .out files to .lua and save them.
4. Now copy paste all the files in your railworks directory, before running railworks make sure you clear blueprint cache.
5. The engine wil now run fine in railworks 3"
