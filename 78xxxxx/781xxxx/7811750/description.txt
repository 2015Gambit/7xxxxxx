Suspense magazine chose Jennifer HillierΓÇÖs ΓÇ£truly frighteningΓÇ¥ debut, Creep, as one of 2011ΓÇÖs best novels, while #1 bestselling author Jeffery Deaver cautioned ΓÇ£you better call in sickΓÇöyouΓÇÖre not going anywhere until you finish reading.ΓÇ¥ Now, Hillier returns to the Pacific Northwest college town where one killerΓÇÖs stranglehold has ebbed . . . but another sick mind has waited for the perfect moment to pick up where the terror left off. Sitting alone in a maximum-security prison cell, Abby Maddox is a celebrity. Her claim to fame is the envy of every freak on the outside: sheΓÇÖs the former lover of Ethan Wolfe, the killer who left more than a dozen dead women in his wake and nearly added Puget Sound State professor Sheila Tao to the tally. Now Abby, serving a nine-year sentence for slashing a police officerΓÇÖs throat in a moment of rage, has little human contactΓÇösave for the letters that pour in from demented fans, lunatics, and creeps. But a new wave of murders has given Abby a possible chance for a plea bargainΓÇöbecause this killer has been sending her love letters, and carving a message on the bodies of the victims: Free Abby Maddox.

Jerry Isaac will never forget the attackΓÇöor his attacker. The hideous scarring and tortured speech are daily reminders that the one-time Seattle PD officer, now a private investigator, is just lucky to be alive. Abby Maddox deserves to rot in jailΓÇöforever, as far as JerryΓÇÖs concerned. But she alone may possess crucial evidenceΓÇöletters from this newest killerΓÇöthat could crack open the disturbing case. With the help of Professor Sheila Tao, seasoned police detective Mike Torrance, and intuitive criminology student Danny Mercy, Jerry must coax the shattering truth from isolated, dangerous Abby Maddox. Can he put the pieces together before AbbyΓÇÖs number one fan takes another life in the name of a killerΓÇÖs perverted idea of justice?
