Hauteville House T03 - The Ghost Steamer
In 1864, Emperor Napoleon III used his army and secret service not only for the field operations and missions recorded in the annals of history.  He also used them for missions involving the metaphysical, occult sciences, and urban legends.  His sole goal, to gain supremacy over his rivals: the English and the Prussians.

In Guernsey, deep under Hauteville House, where the exiled Victor Hugo resides, a handful of Republican soldiers attempt to hinder the emperor's plans.

Born in 1835, Eglantine's true identity is a secret.  We only know that she belongs to Victor Hugo's inner circle.  When he was exiled to Jersey in 1852, Eglantine was already at his side.  In the ""Marine Terrace"", she particpates in spiritual seances.  After her husband's death (secret agent Hector) in the Battle for Gettysburg in 1863, Eglantine decides to go to America to fight for the Republican ideal.

Eglantine gets hired as Martha Lydon, an au pair, by Ernest de la Touque, a military advisor to Napoleon III.  Together with the family she travels to Charleston.  There she finds an America torn and destroyed by Civil War.  Eglantine has to find out what Napoleon wants from the southern states.  Gavroche and Zelda are, at the same time, after the Clovis, an imperial battleship on the move from Mexico to Florida.  Within the hold of the ship is a living weapon, one that is capable of destroying every army... Gavroche has the assignment to sink the Clovis to the bottom of the sea."
