Star Fucking Hipsters are a band from Lower East Side, NYC, USA. Fronted by Nico de Gallo (she actually quit the band in 2011 I think, but she's on this album) and with members of Leftover Crack, Chocking Victims doing the instruments and additional vocals.
Seen them live (that's where I got this CD, from their distro stall;)) and would recommend seeing them if they're playing in a venue near you!
