,matix2267,2012-11-11T00:12Z,"crash on startup with FileNotFoundException, ProcMon said it was C:WindowsMicrosoft.NETassemblyGAC_MSILmscorlib.resourcesv4.0_4.0.0.0_pl_b77a5c561934e089mscorlib.resources.dll which has localized strings for common .net messages for polish language (I have polish Windows installed). So I installed this language pack: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23067 and now it crashes on the same file but with extension .INI. If anyone knows how to fix this please reply."
,zaxs1zaxs,2012-11-11T08:01Z,I'm having an error message as well.
[V],HeroMaster,2012-11-11T10:58Z,"@ALL Update, Attention! For those who are unable to start the game, Just Google XNA v3.1 and put it and everything will work fine."
,jbriguet,2012-11-11T15:11Z,"Well, it was originally distributed with the game on Steam ;) Here, it was stripped."
,hiawatha2,2012-11-11T16:17Z,"The 1st time I played the game it worked perfectly, but later, it looks like the ""moving to the left"" button gets stuck, and the game can't be played because you can't move the character on the game. It's always moving to the left and you can't do anything. Is there any solution?"
,jbriguet,2012-11-11T16:38Z,It may be a problem with your controller.
,hiawatha2,2012-11-11T17:53Z,"I don't think so. I'm playing with the keyboard, and if I close the game, I can use it perfectly with other games or applications. And the game configuration is OK. I tried to uninstall-reinstall but the problem persists"
,Pimpmylurker,2012-11-11T21:43Z,"Hey there,

Can't even launch the .EXE It says the fil is not compatible with Windows 7. 

And what is this !!Mreader.exe ?"
,Pimpmylurker,2012-11-11T21:46Z,What is this !!Mreader.exe ?
,Kesarion,2012-11-12T00:22Z,It doesn't start.
,Kesarion,2012-11-12T00:53Z,"I might as well save people some years. To get the game to start you need:
