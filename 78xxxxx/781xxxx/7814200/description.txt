Here is a set of videos detailing the obscure art of Honan Xingyiquan. For the layman this is the branch of Hsing-i (Xingyi) that doesn't have the five element forms. There are a buttload of videos here. All are shot with a home cam (circa 1989 +) so the quality is not that great but the instruction is excellent. 

Please seed. 

I can't find these on any torrent site so this is it.
