It has to do with igniting the methane from your Butt with a cigarette.

Over and over they try and fail and declare the myth busted.

But what they fail to realize (after trying to tell them twice) is that cigarettes have a chemical in the paper to keep it burning. Sometimes there's a small glob of the stuff and you see a tiny flare on your cigarette.

That flare would ignite the methane and they won't even consider it.

Second, your gripe doesn't change any of the fundamentals that in the normal (and even extreme situations), the natural methane buildup will never reach levels/ratios supportive of combustion even under an open flame, which they tested. If an open flame won't set it off, neither will a tiny momentary  flare-up.

Third, learn about FSC's. There are no fire retardant chemicals in the paper. FSC's are purely a matter of design by way of the type of paper and thickness of both the main shell and those 'speed bumps', nothing else. The only 'chemicals' in the paper is the glue used to glue the layers of paper and speed bumps together. This is the same glue they have been using since even before FSC's for gluing the seams. Nothing special or different about it.

Fourth, globs? Sorry, I've been smoking for over 15 years and have been through a dozen different brands. Never saw globs of anything on any of them. Not even at the seam. What kind of shitty hillbilly brand crap are you smoking?

Fifth, while I have had the occasional flare-up, they have always been an issue of the tobacco itself having either a bit of stem or a flake that was too thick or what ever. Cut one open and sift it out. The tobacco is not anywhere near as clean and consistent as they make it out to be.

Any ways, thanks for playing. You're today's winner of 'being stupid on the internet'. (Pro-tip for loosing the game: Google what you ""think"" before you post it!)"

You sure had a lot to say.

You admit to the flare-ups and they take great pains to get the air/methane mixture that WILL ignite. So, my basic point is backed up by you.

You forgot to mention how many points I lose.

Thanx for playing!
