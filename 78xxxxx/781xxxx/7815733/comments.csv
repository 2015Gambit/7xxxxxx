[T],blackcanary,2012-11-11T19:41Z,"I have a few World or Archie Digests and an assortment of various Archie comics - Archie, Archie and Friends, Archie and Me, Archie's Joke Book, Archie's Madhouse, Archie's Pal Jughead, Archie's T.V. Laugh-Out, Betty, Betty and Veronica, Life with Archie, Veronica, etc, but none of them are complete."
