I thought for sure that this one was already uploaded, but apparently I was wrong (I think I might have been confusing it with Cheval Noir, another anthology that ran for 50 issues). I could do a restoration on a lot of these, but that would take it from a 1.2 GB torrent to AT LEAST 3 GB. I've looked at every issue and I don't think that's necessary. All but three of them looked fine, if not great. All the pages were white (not yellow or newsprint) and although every image isn't perfect, they're all more than good enough for enjoyable reading (all the art is clear and the text readable). I went ahead and did a 'Restoration' on the three issues that had the uglies, so now issues 1-50 all have the same look to their guts.
