QuicKeys 4.0.7 for Mac OS X. 

Cracked. 

Instructions for installing included.

No activation key or serial required.

Developer's page:

<http://startly.com/products/quickeys/mac/4/>

Requires OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Not compatible with 10.7 (Lion) or 10.8 (Mt. Lion).

Note that the developer has just introduced "endless trial" offer: you can use QuicKeys in full-feature trial mode forever. After 30 days a "nag" screen pops up every time us use a QuicKeys feature.

This cracked app eliminates the "nag" screen.

Enjoy!
