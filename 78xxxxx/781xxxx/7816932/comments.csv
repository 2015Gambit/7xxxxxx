,Synergyunit,2012-11-12T04:50Z,"I'm from Australia, over here we have a cap on our download/upload limit, meaning we can only upload/download a certain amount of data before our ISP cuts us off, in America all you guys lose from seeding is bandwidth ... so it is much harder for Aussies to seed as we risk blowing our cap and have to wait a month before we can use the internet again.
Thank's guys for seeding, I will continue seeding while it downloads and while I watch the episode to contribute to hardcore TWD fans like myself who NEED the episode like a drug addict needs his crack."

,DatAussie,2012-11-12T05:42Z,"@815k you are retarded, he is not lying.. in australia we have internet plans like 60, 100, 200 dollars a month with our ISP's and with that we can get like 40,80,137237 gigs a month, but if we go over that limit, our internet will either slow down dramatically or all together. "
,wizzhop,2012-11-12T05:44Z,"@Synergyunit !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mate you are talking about Telstra and Telstra only (unless some other cable companies do the same idk).

No good ISP counts uploads towards total usage and NO ISP AT ALL completely cuts you off when you reach your limit (some may charge per MB downloaded but thats it). My ISP limits my download to 256kbps when i go 10% over my monthly download allowance. So in conclusion, you are talking crap."
,wizzhop,2012-11-12T05:49Z,"@ the other trolls:

815k wasn't insulting synergyunit, he was merely stating IF you are poor and white trash you might be limited. Synergyunit has already insulted his own intelligence enough"

,onryou74,2012-11-13T01:06Z,"I've told this to numerous drug dealers and other assorted scallywags: what we are doing here is crime. 

In the case of torrents - Beautiful crime, victimless crime.

So stop complaining about the quality of things you get for free. You sound like rich kids and other fuckheads with the means to by this stuff anyways. THIS IS CRIME, THERE ARE RULES OF CONDUCT. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE USUALLY VIOLENCE. BUT NOT ON THE INTERNET. THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

Someone needs to start hunting these people down and making their monitors explode. 

They need to be removed from the syndicate. TPB, lets stop letting people talk shit to people who are taking the criminal risk of giving things to people for FREE, regardless of quality. 

Just my 2 cents. I appreciate this torrent regardless of the quality, because I'm a real criminal and I appreciate your effort, ettv! Thank you. "

V/9
A/9

I live in a country town in northern NSW Australia, we are on a plan with Telstra which costs $150 per month and for which we get unlimited telephone to landline and mobile and 500gb of internet. We also use a moden because there is no cable in our area.  It takes me about 20 minutes to download this episode and 40 minutes to get a 700mb movie. For those aussies talking about caps and what not you obviously haven't bothered looking around. I'm sure there are people on much better what with cable and being able to download an episode in 30 seconds and such but you deal with what you got and like it or lump it. I don't mind waiting, it's only time.

Cheers again for the upload M8"

,ItchyLala,2012-11-14T20:13Z,"
Unlimited internet here in Oz starts at 3-4 times the price it is elsewhere because Telstra monopolise telecommunications.

Most people are capped. The point the OP was making was about seeding.  We would all seed continuosly and for as long as we wanted if it werent for the fact that it counts towards upload quota which puts us over our monthly limit. 

Its the one thing here that is fucked up, and thats because Telstra are cunts."

Oh wait a sec, I forgot, some people out there EXPECT a premium service yet refuse to pay more than budget prices (note I said SOME, as in NOT ALL... so don't everyone jump on your high horses)!
