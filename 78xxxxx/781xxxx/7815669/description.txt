If the previous one works for you, no need to D/L this.
If you want to fix the previous one yourself:

The problem is that I set the frame rate to 29.972 THE WRONG WAY.

Load the file into ANY flavor of VirtualDub. Set video to "direct stream copy". Audio defaults to this, so leave that alone.
Click Video- Frame Rate and in the top section you see three choices:
No change
Change to whatever you enter
Change to what VirtualDub thinks is best (in this case - 29.972)
DO NOT USE THE THIRD CHOICE! That's what's caused the problem. I don't know why.
Use the second choice and manually enter 29.972
Click "OK".
Click File - save as avi - (choose a different name or folder so it doesn't try to write over itself).

Tada!

Feedback ALWAYS appreciated. Especially someone using this fix to assure it will likely work for everyone. Feedback is what helped me solve this problem, thank you one and all.
