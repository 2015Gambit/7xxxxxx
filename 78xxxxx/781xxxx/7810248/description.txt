ust What Is Blogging and Pinging??? 
 
There is a new duo in town called Blogging and Pinging. It is not a new comedy team or 
even a singing group, but a new way to attract visitors to your website and make more 
money. Blogging and Pinging is a marketing tool that can make anyone a viable website 
owner.  
 
LetΓÇÖs start with a definition of a blog.   
 
Blog is short for weblog. A weblog is a journal that is frequently updated 
and intended for general public consumption. Blogs generally represent 
the personality of the author or the Web site. 
 
Ok, so what about pinging? Originally, a ping was a program that bounced a request off 
of another computer/server over a network or the Internet to see if the remote computer 
was responding. That same program is now used as a method of informing others that 
your blog exists and also letΓÇÖs them know when a new post has been made.  
 
When you put the two together ΓÇô blogging and pinging ΓÇô you get a technique that is 
extremely effective at getting ANY web site, no matter how big or small, indexed by the 
major search engines.
