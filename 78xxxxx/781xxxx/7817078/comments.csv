,MrGhosty,2012-11-12T07:55Z,This isn't the FULL UNLOCK version... Its just like the other ones. This is a preload for steam and you need a crack or serial key...
,pberry,2012-11-12T08:18Z,so is this the full version but just steam locked for now?
,DFC-Louise,2012-11-12T08:24Z,"well, unlocked doesnt mean cracked"
,BOSSMARYN,2012-11-12T08:26Z,FAKEEEEE
,aeon_x32,2012-11-12T11:09Z,version is good?
,[AKATSUKI],2012-11-12T11:46Z,Its preload not unlocked so its legit but u cant do anything with that even if u have crack so delete and wait for proper release
,tamboy,2012-11-12T12:38Z,is this legit? i mean is it really BO2 for PC?
,tamboy,2012-11-12T12:43Z,thanks for ur reply. Then there is no reason to download this if it cant be use.
,brownnotesuicide,2012-11-12T13:34Z,"this is a preload, wait for the crack...and yes, it is good to download now, so when the initial crack is out, you wont be bogged by everyone downloading it then because of the crack, when all you have left its the crack to download."
,[AKATSUKI],2012-11-12T13:45Z,"Yes tamboy this is legit but its preload version and its useles; wait for proper full unlocked or scene version from extremezone,heromaster,T.F.K"

,rocketeroz,2012-11-15T10:11Z,"I wasted 14GB of download plus another 8.5GB of upload with this @!*!it torrent, when you try to install it it comes up with the boxes to place the activation key. So it's useless. 

Thanks for wasting my bandwidth and making me loose 3 days downloading this garbage is it's going to the garbage-bin as of right now."
