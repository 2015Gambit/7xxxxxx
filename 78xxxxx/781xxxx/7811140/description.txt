In Big Cats, the team dissects a lion alongside a tiger at London's Royal Veterinary College and travel to South AfricaΓÇÖs Welgevonden Game Reserve to see the lion in the wild.

One of the first things they tackle is the anatomy of the roar, which is the characteristic that separates big cats from small ones. They delve into the lionΓÇÖs throat to find its voice box and make a new scientific discovery that helps explain how the vocal apparatus works like a trombone. To test their theory, compressed air is pumped into the windpipe and to everyoneΓÇÖs amazement, it makes the dead lion roar.

From the outside, the lion and the tiger look very different, but once their skins are removed, even the experts find it hard to distinguish between the two. At Welgevonden, the team gets a chance to see the cat's weaponry ΓÇö powerful forearms, protractile claws and powerful bite ΓÇö up close on an anesthetized lioness, before watching a huge male devour a dead wildebeest. Richard Dawkins explains the evolutionary arms race that has arisen between predators and their prey in the struggle to survive.

In the final part of the program, the team analyzes the contrasting social lives of the two big cats to try and find out why male lions have a mane.
