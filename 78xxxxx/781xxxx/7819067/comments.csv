Unfortunately, only the SP campaign works, not the zombies campaign. If I try to launch zombies from the SP menu, it just launches steam. If I launch t6zm.exe I can actually get to the zombies menu, but I can't do anything from there. Options screen just hangs until I hit esc to go back, and clicking 'campaign' just forces close. 

I gotta ask; why bother to include the 'nuketown' deluxe edition maps if we can't use either of them?  It made sense to include the deluxe edition for zombies, but if that doesn't even work?  I know zombies is connected to multiplayer in a way that SP isn't, but someone managed to crack that in the LAST BlackOps...."

so I've always downloaded from extremezone since he is the most trusted in here and I never had problem with his games/videos.

Until this one.   So after I downlaoded and installed all I was getting was black screen and game crashing.  After several hours of reading thru everything, I saw someone saying after applying the new FIX CRACK, they changed their timezone for HONG KONG +8.   

So I decided to try it even if it sounds dumb as shit.   I didnt apply any crack fix or anything.  I used the crack provided in this torrent.   All I did was to change my time zone from EST +5 to  HONG KONG +8.

What the fucking shit? its goddamn working? Hell yeah! 

It sounds really dumb and I don't get what is blocking it from starting but it works for me and my friends. it takes 5 second to change.

,moeburn1,2012-11-14T14:35Z,"@lakialex, there's about 8 pages of people saying you have to install steam, as well as a few year's worth of SKIDROW torrents that have the same requirement to work; you must have Steam installed for almost any recent SKIDROW torrent to work.

Whats with all the bitching and moaning about seeders?  I normally expect a torrent as popular as this to take at least 48-72hours to dl, but mine finished in 10 hours averaging at about 500kB/s.  

I'm sure you're all probably already aware of this, but if you have an asynchronous DSL connection (ADSL), you have to limit your upload speed to about 75%, maybe even as low as 50%, to get 100% of your download speed.  If you are uploading near 100% of your possible upload speed, your dl speed will be crippled."

I had issues concerning crashing through the middle of the game, and I was lost on how to fix this issue because I had fatal crashes constantly when loading the game. SO, if  you are having issues through out the game with crashing, do what Einlanzer105 says, and turn back your date by one day. It should work.

Thanks again. "

,xiigage,2012-11-15T08:07Z,"***For everyone with crashing problems please read!***

I tried EVERYTHING to make it work and finally found the only problem was I did not install THEIR version of the redistributables.

Follow these directions!:

1.Install the game

2. Install DirectX and Microsoft Redistributeables at the end of the installation! (Make sure to do this!, if it gives you an elevation error then navigate to game directory>redist and install both manually.

3. Copy the crack to game directory
4. Install Steam
5. Change the Time Zone to +8.00 (Beijing, Hongkong...)
6. Change the date to 14th NOV 2012
7. Create a firewall rule to block the t6sp.exe, or disable the internet.
8. Right click the Single Player ICON and Run as Admin

I tried everything but the redist installs and then tried them manually and now it works flawlessly for me!"

,azisco,2012-11-16T00:08Z,"Haven't installed yet but I can at least comment on the speed. I averaged around 600 kB/s, not bad at all for the newest CoD game. If you guys are having trouble breaking 100 kB/s, here are some tips:

-On utorrent and I'm sure other clients as well, there is an option that allows you to pick the maximum number of peers to connect to. It defaults at something low like 50 per torrent. I set mine around 300 usually. I'm not sure what the ideal number is, but I'd assume that if you go too high you start sacrificing bandwidth to maintain the connections; I've had good experiences with around 300 so that's what I stick with.

-FORWARD YOUR PORTS. Yes it's a massive pain in a lot of cases but you will notice a difference. I was pulling maybe 200 kB/s on my laptop until I remembered that my ports were closed (can't have a static IP so I have to reforward them every time I come home)

-Go to settings and look for something about protocol encryption. It's usually set to disabled by default, set it to enabled. This will allow you to connect to peers that are seeding from colleges and thus have to encrypt their traffic. Basically this gives you access to seeders with ridiculous college-level upload speeds that most torrentors miss out on.

-SEED. Okay this doesn't increase your speed, and you are probably sick to death of people complaining about leechers, but it's so easy to do that you should reconsider if you're planning on just shutting down bittorrent when the game downloads. Set your upload to about 70% of your max, so your speeds won't suffer at all (even if you're gaming online; I have my upload set to 90% of my pitiful 2 mb/s upload and I experience zero appreciable lag when I lobby in Team Fortress 2), and you'll make someone else's day. Even if it doesn't cycle back to help you, you get to feel better about being a pirate (at least you're a nice pirate) and it's completely effortless.

There's surely more stuff, but this should help a bit at least. Now I need to get back to my obscene homework so I might have time to play this over the weekend..."

Waiting for Hitman Absolution to arrive!! Never buy  a COD game (repack of the same game over and over again, just worth a download and a Single Player completion).

Zombies doesn't work - only says ""online play"" and no ""solo"" option is available.

Multiplayer - exactly the same as Zombies.

Singleplayer campaign - Works fucking fine.

If you guys get some sort of problem after launching the game (such as a black screen, followed by game crashing, or just more black screen), try this: Change your systems time zone to Beijing time zone a.k.a +8. Yes, I mean on your computer. It will take up all but 10 seconds to do so. I don't know why it works when you do that, but it works, nonetheless.

(Not) Necessary:
 It doesn't hurt to make sure your pc is up to date; windows update if you don't want to manually update everything."
,Jedi_Farseer,2012-11-26T17:55Z,"How to fix Black Ops II:

Intall EZ release.

install directx from game installation diractory.

use the 3rd crack (fix) on gamcopyworld (google it) if the original given crack doesnt work.

AMD users shouldnt have a hastle but Nvidia need to update driver to latest (preferably beta version).

right click on cracked .exe select properties and in the compatibilities tab check run as admin select apply  > ok.

If its still not working use the time zone and date change (Time Zone > Hong Kong; Date > 14 Wed Nov 2012

_ Install nVIDIA 310.61 BETA driver (im using a GT420m based dell xps 15 & the BO2 specific 306.XX WHQL driver didn't work)
_ Install VC++ 2k5, 2k8 & 2k10, both x86 & x64
_ Install the SR release but DON'T apply the crack.
_ Install DirectX from redist folder while CONNECTED to internet. It wil get updated files from MS.
_ Install SR I & II updates. Download 'call.of.duty.black.ops.II.crackfix.repack.skidrowgames' from SR site and apply over installed files. The game will start now WITHOUT sound.
_ Now download the sound fix torrent frm TPB and apply in the game folder. Check run as admin.
_ The game should start fine now. If its still bugged, try changing the folder path to 'X':Program Files (x86)ActivisionCall of Duty Black Ops II during install. NO need to modify the date or time. To me i think it was the display driver acting up during game start whch caused the black screens. Do post feedbacks.

There are NO crashes yet till the 6th mission(KARMA). But too sad to see COD moving away from its core traits.
