Eliot said of the sequence ''it is a long poem made by putting together lyrics, which have only the unity and continuity of a diary, the concentrated diary of a man confessing himself. It is a diary of which we have to read every word...its faith is a poor thing but its doubt is a very intense experience''

This is read, very finely, in an abridged version by David Bamber (a BBC production from 2011). The atmospheric music in the background is wonderfully appropriate too. Kindly seed.
