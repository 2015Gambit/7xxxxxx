Kanji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) is an atheist, who  
runs an antique shop. For him, God and         
religion are nothing more than a business      
proposition as he goes ahead making money      
by selling the faith of people for his profit  
His life suddenly is thrown off gear as        
an earthquake ironically destructs only        
his shop in the entire area. while his         
detractors blame it on his atheism that        
led to God's wrath, Kanji remains unperturbed  
and finds his victory with the insurance.      
They promptly reject the claim stating an      
earthquake to be an 'act of god' rather than   
a man-made phenomenon.Kanji takes GOD to       
court when his shop is destroyed by earthquake.
