,cajun_rt,2012-11-18T07:19Z,"i finally created an acct after using this sight for a long time now just so i could leave this comment. i've spent days trying to find a copy of skyfall worth watching and this is it. i'm rather picky and would rather just wait for the dvd release if i can't find a cam copy up to par, but this one is immensely watchable. sound and picture qaulity are both high (for cam).

V: 8 (for cam)
A: 9 (for cam)"
