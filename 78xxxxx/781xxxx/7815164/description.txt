Son seals with AC Reed, Paris-France Palais des glaces, 1977 october 16, aud SM master

May be some of you will want to hear another 1977 Son Seals french show (unavailable until now).
I recorded it with a Sony TC 150 and a cheap external mic.
The SQ is average (check the sample) but the guitar is upfront.

Cassette played on a Marantz SD 4051 deck, to Zoom H4, SD card to PC, Audacity editions (tracks and volume), FLAC (TLH).

AC Reed played the saxophone.
