This is from 1969 when Paco was 20, and when I first heard it it blew my mind. It's pure solo flamenco guitar at its finest: no bass, no percussion, no flutes or other clutter — not even Paco's brother Ramón on 2nd guitar.

"Mantilla de feria" and "Panaderos flamencos" are both pieces by Esteban Sanlúcar, that Paco probably learned from Mario Escudero.
