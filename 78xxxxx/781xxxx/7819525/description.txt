Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints
have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints
sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobble head dolls all
available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater,
but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a
legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the
globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.

Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to a new
city, playing out the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen
in Saints Row: The Third, the third chapter in the blockbuster
open-city action series. Strap it on.
