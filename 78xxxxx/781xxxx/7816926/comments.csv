,trace535,2012-11-12T04:52Z,Why do people respond to trolls? Why does anyone even bother replying to comments from people who aren't sincere? This is an upload from a VIP user. It is exactly what the title says it is.

,knoxius,2012-11-12T05:06Z,"i would love to know, why do uploaders do not put ""download torrent"" anymore, only ""magnet link"" ones? i really prefer being able to save torrent files, and choose the files i do want to download rather than just download the whole thing, that especially goes for torrents with multiple files :)"
,uira,2012-11-12T05:08Z,alway quality. many thanks
,mast3rpyr0,2012-11-12T05:13Z,ettv has been uploading shit lately.. Last 2 things ive downloaded from him were garbage rar files supposedly of episodes that are uploaded 25 minutes before they finish airing.. giving this guy one more shot or im never downloading again..
,vendetta2112,2012-11-12T05:14Z,Thank you:)

,Missdanger,2012-11-12T05:30Z,"Thanks you, good as always"
,thorkis420,2012-11-12T06:08Z,Anything with 10+ seeds automatically becomes magnet only. This is to keep things cloud based. Therefor it can't be shut down.
,silverice1212,2012-11-12T07:37Z,"torrent works fine. theres nothing wrong with it.

,harpersneil,2012-11-12T08:25Z,"@trace535 I agree that people shouldn't respond to trolls. But to be fair, ettv has uploaded heaps of torrents that require passwords. eZtv on the other hand (presumably who ettv was copying) ALWAYS performs as advertised.

For the record, I haven't downloaded this torrent, so I cannot comment on it's authenticity."

,mac_user777,2012-11-12T11:35Z,"Hey could someone post the latest Dexter Early Cuts they aren't available to me online in my country,getting them from TPB is the only way for me,I tried a proxy it didn't work."
,Jason310M,2012-11-12T16:45Z,"@harpersneil

Bullshit, I have downloaded 100's of torrents from ettv none have ever required a password. "
