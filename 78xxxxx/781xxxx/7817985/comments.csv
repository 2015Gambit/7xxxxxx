,slimylimes,2012-11-13T18:52Z,"Hello RKSTR, I just made an account here on TPB specifically to thank you for your hard work. I read that you are planning to take a break. I sincerely hope you come back.. I have relied on you for your Bravo torrents for a long long time. If it were up to me, you wouldn't leave at all, but it's understandable. I mean, you do what you do for free! Just know that you are appreciated, and I'm sorry that it's had to come to this for me to show it! :o)"
