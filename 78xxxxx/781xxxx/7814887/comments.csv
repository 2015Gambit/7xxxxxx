,sohprajogos12,2012-11-11T23:50Z,"Many thanks! This is a treasure! But i couldnt find issues 16 and 17! Not that it detracts anything from the awesomeness of this torrent, but the more Dredd the merrier! :)  "
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-12T00:35Z,That would be because I can't count. :P  For some reason I wrote 17 when it should have been 15. Maybe I was hoping for 17. ;)
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-12T05:36Z,"So while I was preparing a Judge Dredd Megazine torrent, I noticed Judge Dredd: The Complete Case Files #16-17 (they were named differently than #1-15), so I had missed them.  Enjoy now! :)"
