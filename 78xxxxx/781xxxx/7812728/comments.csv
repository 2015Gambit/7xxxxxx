,blueblum,2012-11-23T16:53Z,"Dear sakstroy, the language in which God speaks here is Hungarian and the name Bรถzse is the name of the woman, who got the Word from God. BAD in German is ""bรถse"" = a total different word. We need people to translate these messages into many languages including German :) Thanks for your comment!"
