the only reason i gave it a 5 was the movie wasnt that bad the acting was a little bad but what do u really expect from a movie with drako from harry potter as one of the main leads... its worth a watch if u got nothing else to watch.... great quality as always scene4all, thanx mate "

Holy crap this is horrible..

Yes, it stars Tom Felton(aka Malfoy Draco), and you can tell, because he's the overly-british guy with the giant indoor scarf.
