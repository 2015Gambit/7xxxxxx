Yes as whaletail935 pointed out, Volume 23 - Darwyn Cooke was never published. TwoMorrows had an ad over a year ago saying the interview was finally done and it would be out soon, but it isn't. So yes, Volume 26 - Frazer Irving is the only one published out of 27 (number 1-22 & 24-28) that we don't have. I suspect it hasn't been scanned."
