Flo is in trouble and needs your help in Diner Dash® 5 - BOOM!, the fantastic new chapter from the long-running hit series!

Keeping up with the times, Flo adds a fat-free breakfast to the menu. Her plan backfires however, when a prankster removes the word "fat" from her sign, resulting in a brutal breakfast rush that completely levels the diner. Mr. Big quickly jumps on the opportunity to take over that city lot, but with her pal Hal, Flo is determined to rebuild the diner bigger and better than ever before.

Join Flo and help her construct a new diner before Mr. Big has the last laugh! Take the diner to the people and serve them on the streets of DinerTown. Seat the customers, bring them their food and earn tips. With the money you make, you can purchase upgrades and help Hal with over 1000 combinations of fixtures and décor for the new diner. After 40 out-of-the-ordinary levels while battling unpredictable weather and natural disasters, you'll be able to play the final 10 in your own one-of-a-kind creation!
