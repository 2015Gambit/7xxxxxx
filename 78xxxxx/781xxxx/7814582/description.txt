Well, here goes.  It's the fourth, brand new, hopefully somewhat anticipated part of Pirate This Book.  Available free through the Bay like the first three.  Download it, print out pieces you like, send them to your friends or just stick them on a bulletin board somewhere.  I'd rather be read than dead!
