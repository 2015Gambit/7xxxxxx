This guide will help you pick a top shortwave radio. Most radios are not worth purchasing. This includes image-laden single-conversion radios that lack SSB (ex. KA105, FR600, YB-300PE, ATS-404, E10, and CCRadio SWP) and drifty analog-tuned radios with digital frequency-counter displays (ex. KA008, ETFR, GM400, G1100, PT-50, DE1104, S350DL, and S450DLX) and analog dial radios. My picks are show in green; negatives in yellow; and deal-breaking negatives in red.
