Drawing Manga Faces and Heads in Photoshop


In this tutorial we will learn the basics about drawing character faces and heads in the Manga style. The art of Japanese comics known as Manga has been incredibly popular not only in Japan but in the United States for quite some time now. If youΓÇÖve ever wondered how to even start drawing in this style, this is the course for you. We will be breaking down the head and face of both Manga males and females and learning how to draw them step by step. First we will learn how to master drawing the trademark eyes of the Manga style. From here weΓÇÖll move on and learn how to render the head from the front, side and 3/4 views. Because hair is so important with this style, weΓÇÖll spend a few lessons focusing just on it before wrapping up by drawing a few character expressions. After completing this course, youΓÇÖll have a good foundation to build so that you can begin developing your own style for drawing Manga.
