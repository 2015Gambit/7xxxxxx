The Usual Suspects is the band from Belgium, very similar to P.A.I.N.
The Usual Suspects, they entered my radar just recently. All I know about them is that they are from Leuven, Belgium (hmm, my liver is kicking in and giving me a hint that Stella Artois beer is originally also from this town) and that they started playing back in 2001. They remind me mostly of the all-mighty P.A.I.N. but sounding more rougher (as in: they have this more coarse, punk sound). They are still active and gigging around so I would recommend you people go and see them if they play in a venue near you and also be sure to catch their previous album ΓÇ£Hasta La Vista, Comandante!ΓÇ¥.
