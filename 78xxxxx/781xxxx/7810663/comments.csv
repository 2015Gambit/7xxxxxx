[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-10T04:45Z,Apparently our feed ran into a few issues at the end causing jittery audio and about 30-40 seconds worth of video missing right at the end. If the scene doesn't put up their own version we'll do a rerip. Sorry for the inconvenience! We'll do better next week.
[T],FatFreddy271,2012-11-10T04:56Z,"Sooo awesome love this show, thanks much "
,EvoQY,2012-11-10T05:07Z,"hey thnxx a bunch, I really like this show allot. habout ""the Men who built America part 4"" do you have access to that show? Again thnxx I do not have access to cable at all where I live so the PB is my only way to see any TV shows. keep up good work !"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-10T05:08Z,"...and there are commercials in this one. Yeah, we realllllly messed up."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-10T05:16Z,"@EvoQY We'll look into it, but no guarantee."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-10T05:41Z,Get this release instead: Gold.Rush.Alaska.S03E03.HDTV.x264-KILLERS
,auntystatic,2012-11-10T06:40Z,"your aspect ratio is also way off, lots of the picture has been cut off top and bottom, I look forward to next weeks now your teething problems will be sorted, thanks"
,jagr_200,2012-11-10T06:40Z,"NUKE! Commercials and messed up the last minute or so. Either way I appreciate the upload. I was probably one of the first people to get this today haha. Can you upload ""Jungle Gold"" as well? "
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-10T06:55Z,"@auntystatic nope, AR is right - 16:9. It's a SD source so just the black bars are cropped off (and some of the logo due to its placement) but none of the actual video is cropped away.

@jagr_200 if there's time, yeah."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-10T06:58Z,We're not going Jungle Gold. Just get Jungle.Gold.S01E03.HDTV.x264-KILLERS :)

,jpmac,2012-11-10T19:55Z,"the episode was called 'the dirt', cheers"
