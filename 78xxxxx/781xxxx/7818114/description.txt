Plot: Grand Knights History is a set in the fantasy world of Rystia, which is divided into three warring kingdoms: Logres, the Ancient Kingdom, ruled by King Fausel; Union, the Kingdom of Knights, ruled by King Leon; and Avalon, the Kingdom of Magic, ruled by Queen Muse. Players must align themselves to one of the three nations and advance the story by taking part in missions on behalf of their chosen country.



this game is a 2d side scrolling RPG. it was made by the same people who made Muramasa: Demon Blade for the wii (Vanillaware) and i loved the art style in that game (the same art style in this one). i noticed that no one had made a torrent of this yet so i decided to do it myself. i DL'ed the original (pre patched) file from pspcollection dot net. i have no clue who made the patch but i believe it was kenma9123 (you can find him on youtube). i have not personally tested it yet but i will be in the near future and will post results.
