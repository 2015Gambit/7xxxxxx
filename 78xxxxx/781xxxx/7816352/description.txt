El Bahatee was an hip-hop artist that was most active in late 1990's & early 2000's in Croatia. Lyrics deal with social, criminal and political issues plaguing the nation. Got censored by the media after he ripped the American flag during performance at main discography award show in Croatia (Porin) after USA invaded Iraq. 1st Album, and damn, you better learn Croatian, it's nasty!
