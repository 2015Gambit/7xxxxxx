and play them on my ps3?"

[V],3Li,2012-11-16T01:26Z,"@blaze291 - you can cut a mkv file with mkvtoolnix,
for example this one: cut in 2 parts, then demux those parts with MKVExtractGUI2.
now you have a h264 file and a dts file. encode only dts file to aac  then mux aac file with h264 file using mp4box. for encoding audio you can try media coder AE. Goodluck."
