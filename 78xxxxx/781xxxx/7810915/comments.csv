,deuz,2012-11-12T16:54Z,everybody have Lion? test in Mountain Lion if you have the chance.
,deuz,2012-11-12T16:58Z,"maybe the resolution are making the crash because the game was fixed to 1400X900 resolution, let me check."
,deuz,2012-11-12T18:06Z,"1st- For those who said that the zip file is damage, download again and the run the game (I had to download the game and it works fine)

2nd- The game will crash if you have a lower resolution display so you have to re patch the game to your resolution:

1-secondary click the Silent hill game
2-Show package content
3-Open wineskin
4-Select Advance
5-In configuration, select ""Browse""
6-Browse to ""Program Files/Konami/Silent Hill 2
7-Select ""Silent Hill 2 HD Patch.exe
8-press ""Test"" bottom
9-Select you resolution and press ""Patch""
10-repeate 5-6
11- Select ""sh2pc.exe
12- close everything and test

I hope you can fix the game and enjoy."
,mikehouston09,2012-11-12T22:57Z,thanks deuz i make it work i change the resolution  and is work very good  i m use mountain lion 10.8.2
,malthus0,2012-11-13T00:42Z,Didnt work for me in Lion..
,deuz,2012-11-13T02:46Z,malthus0 did you have a crash dialog or something?
,deuz,2012-11-13T02:46Z,malthus0 did you have a crash dialog or just close?
,malthus0,2012-11-13T13:59Z,"It says: The program sh2pc.exe has encountered a serious problem and needs to close.
"
,pegameow,2012-11-13T20:58Z,"It works perfectly if you follow deuz instructions in the comments. 

You just have to follow the steps and fix the resolution to 1920x1080. other resolution won't work (at least for me). 

hope it helps. thanks for uploading. "
,hurukh,2012-11-13T21:25Z,Anybody got this working on Snow Leopard?
,malthus0,2012-11-14T00:12Z,"I tried, but it says:
fixme:d3d:init_driver_info Unable to find a driver/device info for vendor_id=0x10de device_id=0x8a4 for driver_model=2"
,deuz,2012-11-14T19:05Z,malthus0 right now I have a lot of work but i'll try to fix your problem.
,malthus0,2012-11-14T19:14Z,"thanks man, no rush"
,deuz,2012-11-15T20:25Z,"malthus0 I really don't know why you can run this game but let me try to run in emulation screen so:

1-secondary click the Silent hill game
2-Show package content
3-Open wineskin
4-Select Advance
5-""Set Screen Option""
6-""override""
7-""Full screen""
8-Resolution (Chose the same you patch)
9-Disable ""Descorate windows"" and Auto detect GPU...""

test and comment please."
,malthus0,2012-11-16T00:34Z,"Ok cool, the game works now. But there is still a problem. My resolution is 1280x1024. But when i try to patch, closest resolution is 1280x800. So i patch with that one and adjust it in Screen options. When i test the game, it starts, but of course the game is not fullscreen, but is 1280x800, multiplying the pointer by 2 (the game pointer and the mac pointer, one that can only move in the game screen and the other in the whole screen). Thanks for your patience!  "
,Stellardrive,2012-11-16T00:42Z,i find the way to make it work 8) here is the info you need http://portingteam.com/files/file/7225-silent-hill-2-directors-cut/
,deuz,2012-11-16T03:40Z,"Ahhh ok I see the problem, you donÂ´t need to patch the game because you have a display with 4:3 relation and the patch fix this old game for displays with 16:9. so you could try to change the resolution in the game options and test"
,malthus0,2012-11-16T13:48Z,Problem solved! Thanks a lot!
,GrunnyRiku,2012-11-20T21:47Z,deuz your settings didnt work either. it seems to be a problem with the exe itself
,XSMASH,2012-11-26T14:51Z,"hey deus!
