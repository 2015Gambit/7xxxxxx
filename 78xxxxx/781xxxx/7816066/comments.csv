,wyldkat,2012-11-12T01:00Z,Something is up with the sound and vid? The sound doesn't run at the same speed as the vid. Tried closing out and opening up several times...no success. BOOO

,laylo,2012-11-12T05:30Z,thank u for the up but can u get a better copy
,joegreg13,2012-11-12T06:59Z,A 6 V 6 Sync is off by a word it looks like. Very watchable. It's better than skyfall cam. It is suppose to be low budget just so you people know it
,leemealon,2012-11-13T21:26Z,screenshots??

,Calamakuya,2012-11-18T12:46Z,"@Keevin24, would you please find something better to do with your life or just go and jump over a bridge?

Stop your fucking ads where they're not wanted, you prick."
,Bunstuff,2012-11-23T17:23Z,"Many6 thanks to the ripper and the uploader. This is an objective evaluationa and not meant to insult or discourage. All ratings for a CAM.

V - 2. Extremey dark, over-contrasty and fuzzy.
A - 2. Sound is boomy, echo-ey and drifts in and out of sync.
M - 2. My SUBJECTIVE evaluation. Acting bad. Story confused and derived. Characters  And contrived. - to call them 2-dimensional would be to overpraise them. Trueness to the era - BWAAaaa-ha-ha-ha-ha!! The ""nekkid"" dancer's ain't quite.

Not for me. But still, it might appeal to a dyed-in-the-wool action fan who is willing to put uip with these problems to eyeball Russel Crowe unravel the Crazy Hippo in a gush of blood. Personally, I'd rather watch the nekkid dancers gat really  really nekkid."
