,OmniNegro,2012-11-10T09:47Z,"retro_city_rampage-1.06-setup.exe

That sounds to me like an installer. This is the full version. The game is tiny."
,froggyskins,2012-11-10T21:00Z,at first I was wondering why this file was so much bigger than the last humble exe but then I realized there are some extras included here like the soundtrack and some artwork.
,whatthefuckpassword,2012-11-17T18:10Z,v1.07 isn't in the humble store - can anyone post the GOG or steam v1.07?
