,MrclScns,2012-11-12T21:16Z,@STFmaryville - No problem. Glad to contribute.
,ajsztehlo,2012-11-13T04:21Z,"Wow MrclScns, this has got to be one of the best torrents I have EVER seen. Did you compose all the title pages and everything on the Alan Moore omnibus? This is truly amazing stuff. Thank you for giving me the chance to read Miracleman, would never have read it without you!"
,MrclScns,2012-11-13T05:05Z,"@ajsztehlo - Glad to hear it! Hope you enjoy. It's probably my all time favorite comic. And yes, i did put the Alan Moore omnibus together myself."
,ajsztehlo,2012-11-13T15:36Z,"@MrclScns Just started reading, startling stuff! Thanks again for the upload."
,animesamurai,2012-11-13T22:55Z,The re-scanning of these are definitely better than all other Miracleman torrents out there.  Your hard work is very much appreciated!  Quality is excellent.  I can finally finish this epic series thanks MrclScns!
