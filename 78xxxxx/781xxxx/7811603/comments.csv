,spina27,2012-11-12T06:48Z,"I NEVER complain bout movies but damn did you not preview this before you uploaded it? The quality and sound would be fine but the movie jumps up and down the entire time plus heads are cut off. 
Also why hasn't anyone gotten Diary of a wimpy kid dog days, pitch perfect, or chasing mavericks?
Please upload them if you can"
