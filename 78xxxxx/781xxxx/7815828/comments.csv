Follow my included instructions for free Permanent Pro WMC activation and remember to back up your activation with the tokens manager.

,murphy78,2012-11-11T20:57Z,"One of the lovely TPB admin types Randompirate just told me that I was banned on accident and that they will try to restore my torrents if they can.

I think either someone saw me giving T.F.K a hard time or saw all my multi5 different torrents and thought I was duplicating the same torrents.  I'm not sure what happened, but I'll not go posting on T.F.K torrents calling him out for stealing my work and lying about them being retail image sources.  I wouldn't get my feelings hurt if people went an gave him a ""-"" on them, even if it is my work.

Gah here I go again... gotta try and relax on that guy haha..."

Where are your other torrents? I can't query them here anymore."
,murphy78,2012-11-12T05:59Z,"warrennocos, I got ""accidently"" banned.  They are trying to restore them, but it might not happen.  Not to worry, I predict that new hotfixes will be coming this Tuesday and I will be remaking a LOT of stuff this coming week.  I know I never got to the last like 5 or 6 languages in my multi5 series, but I may redo those in time as well.  They are just not as high of a priority as getting the faster English only versions out. (Faster setup time, not faster system)"
,Addryann,2012-11-12T08:11Z,"Most probably they will ban my account too. On their last ""retail"" post of W 8, I kind of sent them my blessings...."

hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.

Works!~ Enjoy New OS as I am :) x32 & x64"

,Naman0007,2012-11-13T11:50Z,"Hey murphy78 the torrent working fine new windows 8 is awsome...

but can can also upload its activator please....

when i installed it, it didnt ask for the serial key is there problem with that.
THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD"
,murphy78,2012-11-14T07:36Z,"hey buds, thanks for the support.  I am going to try to roll out the english only pro, then all the multi language versions with updated kb files.  Then I will redo this with the nov kb files.  It may be a week and a half or so.  I'm going to try to roll out an x86 and x64 multi once a day if all the testing goes well.

Thanks for the support guys."
,murphy78,2012-11-14T07:40Z,"Oh sorry forgot the questions about activator and needing keys.  You really should be needing a key to select the different versions.  If you added an ei.cfg file and it lets you choose between the two, thats great, but if it doesn't you might have an error somewhere.

The whole point of having a 2pack is that you can first install the pro and do the media upgrade, then save the activation and be able to install directly to the proWMC.

As far as the activator, I DID include it... scypts activator 1.4.1 is in there... it's called WinAct_1.4.1.exe  Eventually defender will call it malware, but it doesn't as of yet.
It still works, I have tested it today.

I got uploading to do fellas..."
,machine028,2012-11-14T08:38Z,"Thank you @murphy78 for your awesome updated windows.

and also does this include netflix?"
,murphy78,2012-11-14T22:31Z,"@H1tch0130 Check the descriptions. Later dates often have newer kb files integrated.  I don't make the operating systems... I just update them.

@machine028 I don't know about office 2013.  If it has an incompatibility with ProWMC, that's its problem.  Some applications will have incompatibilities with ProWMC for a short while until they realize the problem and present a workaround.  I might suggest saving the Pro activation, and then save a screencap of the phone callup numbers.  I think I noticed that the keys offered were the same when I used the same upgrade key.  That means you only need to re-enter the successful keys to reactivate PROWMC from PRO.

So, what you could do is install Pro, install office2013, then upgrade to wmc.  If it still has problems after that, don't worry; I'm sure they will patch it soon.  I'm not an office2013 expert but I hope that helps..

No longer need the PRO step.  Simply install directly and activate with your upgrade key.  Go check it out peeps...
