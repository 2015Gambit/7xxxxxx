Men of War takes place in Europe during the height of World War II
The story unfolds across three different campaigns played out through the
eyes of Soviet, Allied and German soldiers. 
Each campaign has its own
structured timeline bringing a different story of the war to life spanning
across Russia, North Africa, Ukraine, Greece, Germany, Italy and the
Pacific. 
The main Soviet campaign sees two student comrades, Smirnov and
Kuznetzov, join the army and quickly become brothers in arms as they rise
through the ranks and experience the rigors of war

Men of War will feature 50 new units to play, including newly designed
tanks, APCs and heavy guns. 
Dynamic, in-game video enhances the single
player missions, while developer Best Way has given the sounds of war new
range with over one hundred new effects, recorded under real operating
conditions. 
The single player campaign will also feature a fully
customizable user interface so players are able to set-up their command
layout as they please
