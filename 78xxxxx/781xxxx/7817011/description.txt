Gone Abie Gone

Grampa escapes from his retirement home, and
when Homer and Marge frantically try to
track him down, they follow clues that
reveal secrets in Grampas past. They find
that he worked at a local restaurant with
Marvin Hamlish (guest-voicing as himself)
and met and fell in love with the
restaurants singer Rita LaFleur (guest
voice Anika Noni Rose). Meanwhile Lisa tries
her hand at online poker, getting tips from
the experts, including Jennifer Tilly
guest-voicing as herself) but is soon
gambling with her college fund
