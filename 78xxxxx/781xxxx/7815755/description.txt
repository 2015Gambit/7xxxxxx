Explosions In The Sky ΓÇô Live DVD #1

ItΓÇÖs a single camera angle but itΓÇÖs right up at the stage lip. The audio is 
amazingly clear and crisp thanks to Jarod Watson handling audio in the back of the venue. Expect the second evening to be torrented soon once I get it from the person who is authoring the DVD.
