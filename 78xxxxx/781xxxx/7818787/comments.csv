,rajakumar,2012-11-12T19:56Z,"

Hi:

Screenshots looking good, so can u please upload in smaller size i.e 300mb to 500mb."
,ashsama,2012-11-12T21:52Z,"A 137min movie in 300-500MB size? 
Are you serious? You could play Pong with those pixels..."
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-12T21:55Z,"Agreed... no reason for anything to be over 700MB. 

The increase in XviD quality from 700MB to 1.4GB is only 5-10%, but for *double* the filesize. You can stuff a very watchable 640x272 or 720x304 rip into 400MB using h264."
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-12T22:05Z,"I was agreeing with rajakumar, NOT ashsama who obviously knows nothing avout video compression. "
,crumrugin,2012-11-12T22:17Z,"Is this REALLY line audio (thats what ts means) or a mike like the rest, seems that everyone ids abusing the terms lately"
,crumrugin,2012-11-12T23:04Z,"pardon my last comment ..from the sample there is some echo but the players are in a cavern ,and regardless the audio is VERY good and completely understandable GREAT job ..best one and totally watchable thanks to the super sound tweek or whatever someone did it worked..thanx V/8 A/8"
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T00:19Z,"@michaelrwatson:

Thanks for your supporting me.

1.46GB or 2.27GB movies it is not worth for CAM, or TS rip release. If it is yifyâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s brrrip or someothers dvdrip itâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s worth for download,."
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-13T00:48Z,"@crumrugin: Actually, TS means telesync where the camera (usually an expensive one) syncs its framerate to the projector's rate so there is NO flicker. It does not refer to the audio.

@rajakumar: I don't like yify--usually too high a resolution. Anything over 720x304 takes too much processor power and i can't run Mathematica or do 3D rendering while i'm watching. Anyway, i can hardly tell the diff between 480p and 720p, e.g. 640x272 and 1024x436."
,crumrugin,2012-11-13T01:18Z,"According to Wikipedia "" the audio of a TS is captured with a direct connection to the sound source (often an FM microbroadcast provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater)."" look it up "
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T01:54Z,"
@michaelrwatson: so did u download and watch this movie from here, then how is audio and video on this movie. Do u know any other uploader who can make movies in smaller rip size in 500 mb not more than 1 gb."
,skyvillage,2012-11-13T03:55Z,This is the one--an excellent cam.  Very watchable and enjoyable.

Passing of the old guard into a new generation of anonymous villain is exactly where crime is now situated: online.

I call bullshit. No way. I've had a very steady download with a 1/4 the amount of seeders here and it was movin' at 3.2MB/s and uploading 100kb/s+ "

,mpdkorat,2012-11-23T04:19Z,"Nice Job Acesn8s. I do not normally d/l cams but after reading the comments I decided to give it a go. I'm half way through the movie now. The quality (for a cam) is very good indeed. I'm really enjoying the one liners, for instance ""Just changing carriages""  People this is a Bond movie and for those of you who enjoy Bond movies you will not be disappointed.

I realise that some of you children out there will call me gay or make inappropriate comments about my mother, or try to promote some silly alternative site, but thats OK.

This comment is for those of you who would like some real information regarding THIS torrent."

,Kiriyama87,2012-11-24T01:39Z,"actually quite watchable for a cam.

but it feels like some scenes might be missing? 

for example on the boat - one second they are talking, and then it cuts, and in the next second they are captured, walking with hands behind their back.."

There was a slight grainy feel for the first couple of minutes but after that it was an extremely good picture. The Audio was good with no hard to hear parts throughout. All in all better then good. 

Cheers for uploading Acesn8s, much appreciated."

,HereTodayGoneTomorrow,2012-11-25T13:37Z,"where do these early releases come from? and why are they so close to being a q=10 ?

serious... think about it...

they are made for a movie screen and recorded as a cam (shit quality)

or...

on a dvd and made to be a screener for executives to watch (10 quality) 

how do you take a 10 quality executive screener and manage to turn it into an 8 ?  what kind of software or hardware dumbs the quality down by 20%"

,balrog814,2012-11-26T23:21Z,"What were they thinking? James Bond and M don't have like a million friends they could call upon in case of a threat? They go to the mountains and fight their war against a thug on their own??? 2 old farts plus one??? I bet a figure like M, picks up the phone and orders 15 top shooters, without anyone gets news of it. Very stupid film. Also the transmitter??? It would've been obsolete in Sean Connery times. On the Chinese flea market one can buy classier products. Also the Macao thugs never have a gun? They go fistfight with someone and the fatguy never cheks for the Komodo dragon behind him??? STUPID!!! What happened with the Quantum Solace gang? They were completely forgotten of, although the score wasn'T ever settled with them. Mr White just got out and disappeared. What a letdown after Casino Royal."

I found it the worst Bond , very very bad movie."
,moeburn1,2012-11-29T19:31Z,"audio - 8/10 video - 8/10

One of the best cam recordings I've ever seen!  When the scene is bright enough (daylight car chases, etc), I wouldn't be able to tell it apart from a DVD-rip.  Unfortunately in the darker scenes, the camera just doesn't have enough dynamic range, and things can be pretty hard to see.

I don't know if the audio is telesync quality though.  It sounds more like a microphone recording than a true telesync (where the audio comes out of a jack in the projector's booth), but still very good audio.  near-perfect.

Best of all, this recording clearly came out of the projector booth, as the camera is on a steady tripod, and there are never any audience sounds or heads to get in the way."
,Synthesist,2012-11-29T23:49Z,"Thanks for the new Bond... you've made my day

People saying the size is too big... boo hoo.  I think pirated movies were made for the PC/Mac FIRST.  Those with the tablets and phones and other toys need to work out whatever issues make you think these files are too big.  If you are computer users, GO TO HELL you ungrateful bastards.  Thanks for the movie BUT can you make it small INDEED... jeeeez."
,Synthesist,2012-11-29T23:52Z,"@crumrugin

You just need to get your movies from another source as clearly nothing here is up to your standard."
