Beneath the Dark Ice (Alex Hunter #1) 

When a plane crashes into the Antarctic ice, exposing an enormous cave system, a rescue and research team is dispatched. Twenty-four hours later, all contact is lost. Captain Alex Hunter and his highly trained commandos, along with a team of scientists, are fast tracked to the hot zone to find out what went wrong. Meanwhile, the alluring petrobiologist Aimee Weir is sent to follow up on the detection of a vast underground reservoir. If the unidentified substance proves to be oil, every country in the world will want to know about itΓÇöeven wage war over it. Or worse.

Once suspended into the caves, Alex, Aimee, and the others canΓÇÖt locate a single survivorΓÇöor even a trace of their remains. Nor is there a energy source, only specters of the dead haunting the tunnels. But soon they will discover that something very much alive is brewing beneath the surface. It is a force that dates back to the very dawn of timeΓÇöan ancient terror that hunts and kills to survive...
