Ljubi┼ía Samard┼╛i─ç is a band from Zagreb, Croatia. Members from Verbalni Delikt and AK-47 play in it. Their only release as far as I know. Named after a well known Ex-Yugoslavian actor (mostly WW2 movies, he killed a lot of nazis LOL, if him and few other actors got together, with their body count WW2 would end somewhere in 1942).
