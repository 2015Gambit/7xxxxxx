Some time ago, you commented that funds were tight for you.  

On this site, have a look at user DOOLY-WZMB. I was browsing a moment or two ago and found this person's collection.  I can't attest as to the quality or reliability of the torrents, just posting this info to help out.

Plenty of Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia Band, Further, etc.  Many sound boards."
