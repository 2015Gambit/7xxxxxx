[T],burgundyranger,2012-11-13T17:54Z,"No need to keep asking for the SD. I get it posted when I can. This site was down all morning.

SD is now posted."

,fartboytpb,2012-11-18T22:25Z,I don't understand why this always takes so long to come out as a torrent. Every other show I get comes out the same day.
,genocide44,2012-11-19T03:53Z,burgundyranger @ please upload episode 17
[T],burgundyranger,2012-11-19T05:56Z,"Significant issues have arisen. Dekabroken's PC crashed while trying to upload this episode. And if he can't upload it, I can't torrent it. (his schedule and mine are quite uncomplimentary, that's why these torrents are usually next-day ... I don't do the recording or encoding).

I have NO IDEA how long it will be before I'll be able to upload any of the remaining episodes."
,fartboytpb,2012-11-19T20:44Z,"Ah, that sucks. Well thanks for the response anyways."
[T],burgundyranger,2012-11-22T00:44Z,"I have a version of Episode 17 from another encoder that I can post if you'd like -- until dekabroken can get his issues resolved.

It's smaller than deka's encodes and I don't believe it's in HD."
,gkai,2012-11-22T19:18Z,YES...upload this episode 17
