Renowned as the bravura front man of one of Britain's greatest rock bands,
Freddie Mercury's life outside Queen is rarely celebrated or explored.

In a touching portrait, imagine... charts Mercury's solo projects and
interests, including a previously unheard collaboration with Michael Jackson
and the triumphant Barcelona project with Dame Montserrat Caballe, as well
as the life of a gay man who was not yet publicly out.

Rare interviews reveal a shy man in search of love, and a driven artist
living behind the protection of his stage persona.
