I am re-seeding this again because the I got the original copy off demonoid, which has disappeared - which creates problems with hash info. This one should prove more durable.

The movie is an elegant meditation on the futility of capital punishment. It's interesting the genteel and kind way the guards treat their prisoner (Diana Dors) - I don't think things are as civilized now. Still, great acting by all concerned.
