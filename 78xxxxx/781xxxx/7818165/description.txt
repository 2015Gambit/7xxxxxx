Executive Summary

The Global Internet Phenomena Report: 2H 2012 shines a light on fixed and mobile data networks around the world, identifying facts, fads, and the future trends that will shape the InternetΓÇÖs future. Within this report, we present a mix of high-level observations, regional-focused analysis, deep-dives into specific subjects, and educational tidbits. Communications service providers (CSPs) in particular are in the position to act on this information, but we believe that the findings will be of interest to a wide range of readers.

At the highest level, Real-Time Entertainment (comprised mostly of streaming video and audio) remains the largest traffic category on virtually every network we examined, continuing a trend that we expect to observe into the foreseeable future.

North America continues to lead in adoption of this traffic category, with almost two-thirds of downstream traffic during peak period being streaming audio or video. The dominance of Real-Time Entertainment is due in large part to the continued market leadership of Netflix, which now accounts for 33% of peak period downstream traffic. Competing video services such as Amazon (1.75%), Hulu (1.38%) and HBO Go (0.52%) are often mentioned in the same breath as Netflix, but the data shows these services are unlikely to challenge Netflix for market dominance anytime soon.In other regions, YouTube continues to be largest single source of Real-Time Entertainment traffic in both fixed and mobile access technologies, making it the leading source of Internet video traffic in the entire world.

Home roaming (the use of tablets and smartphones in the home), which leads to more devices concurrently using the network, is one reason why median monthly usage on North AmericaΓÇÖs fixed access networks has increased from 10.3 GB to 16.8 GB in just the past six months. Over the same period, mean monthly usage grew by over 70% increasing to 51.3 GB from 32.1 GB. Growing subscriber consumption is not limited to North America or fixed networks ΓÇô in Asia-Pacific, mean mobile usage increased by almost 10% in six months. 

This report includes analysis of fixed and mobile access networks in three regions, so readers will be able to see how traffic is evolving around the globe.

In addition to detailed analysis of global networks, we include focused featurettes that examine a particular emerging trend or observation. Interspersed among regional summaries, readers will find sections that tackle numerous topics including:
ΓÇó  Examining the new copyright alert system in the US
ΓÇó  Exploring the impact Apple product launches have on networks
ΓÇó  Predicting fixed and mobile growth in the US
ΓÇó  Reviewing the impact streaming the 2012 London Olympics in the US had
ΓÇó  Highlighting some important considerations of deploying LTE

The 2H 2012 Global Internet Phenomena Report also includes summaries of findings from five regional snapshots, all of which are available on www.sandvine.com:
