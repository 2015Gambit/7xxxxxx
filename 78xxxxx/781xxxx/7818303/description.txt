A mashup of PSY's big single "Gangnam Style" with Haddway's 1993 hit "What is Love". Hope you like it!
I do not own the individual rights to either "Gangnam Style" or "What is love". The song is not made for profit. I just enjoy what flexibility PSY has on his rights to the song and wanted to transform it. It was just made for fun.
