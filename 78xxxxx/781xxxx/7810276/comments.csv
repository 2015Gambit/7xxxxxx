,.Leto.,2012-11-10T20:46Z,"Thanks for uploading the original Total Recall, it's a real classic! Here's a good review of the movie and the Mind Bending Edition bluRay: http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/7010/total_recall_mbe.html
As you can see it's not perfect yet but it's better than the previous bluray versions.
btw I tried to watch the 2012 remake a few days ago, I fell asleep during the movie! "
