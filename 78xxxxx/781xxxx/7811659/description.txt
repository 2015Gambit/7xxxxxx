Storyline
When two unemployed telephone pranksters decide to use their vocal "talents" to impersonate a Chicago mob boss and curry favor with organized crime in New York, the trouble begins. It isn't long before Johnny and Kamal (the "Jerky Boys" of crank call fame) are wanted by the local mafia, the police, and their neighbor. 

Didn't get a great score on IMDB, But I think it's a matter of taste
I thought it was quite funny.
Enjoy.
