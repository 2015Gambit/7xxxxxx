Brookdale Lodge - Zak, Nick and Aaron head to the once-famous Brookdale Lodge in Brookdale, CA, in search of the notorious spirits lingering around the establishment. The lodge was a vacation hideaway for the Hollywood and political elite in 1940s and 50s. As they prepare for the lockdown, Zak introduces his dog, Gracie, who will hopefully act as a trigger object to attract the sprits.
