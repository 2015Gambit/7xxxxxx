[T],blackcanary,2012-11-10T19:40Z,"Hauteville House is a series of comics in the steampunk genre taking part in the Second Empire under Napoleon III.

In this universe, humanity has access to advanced technology but misunderstood. On the one hand, ancient civilizations were visited by the Ancient Astronauts . On the other hand, since the Big Bang Day (an event never explained), Western countries have airships, overpowered submarines, the armor, the prosthetic mechanical, and other incredible objects.

Yet, history has followed the course that we know and in 1851, Victor Hugo throws an underground army against Napoleon III . Twelve years later, Captain Gabriel La Rochelle Valentine (codename Gavroche, the model character of Victor Hugo) is sent to Mexico to Maximilian of Habsburg, where the Second Empire seeks an unknown weapon on the steps of HernĂĄn CortĂŠs.

The story gets more complicated as a supernatural element: the spiritualism.

8 volumes (or tomes in French) have been released with the ninth due out November 28, 2012.

Tome 1:  Zelda (November 6, 2002)
