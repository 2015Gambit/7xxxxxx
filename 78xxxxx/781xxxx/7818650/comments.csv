,timwmac,2012-11-13T01:28Z,"Thanks conchboi, I need all the info I can get to motivate me to do more, remember folks I am new at this and will get better as time goes by. You show me patience and I will produce great copies. Thanks all,"
,timwmac,2012-11-13T01:33Z,"Rajakumar, basically impossible to get a movie or Vid at that sise unless you convert to mkv or other video formats which would take to long, almost impossible to find a good quality movie under 600 mb or less, sorry dude."
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T02:26Z,"@timwmac
I have low limited bandwidth. "
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T02:26Z,"@timwmac: 
okay okay Thanks for replying me, u have mistaken me and I have not downloaded your release yet."
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T02:33Z,"@timwmac:
so did u watch this movie from your own source, then how is audio and video on this movie. Do u know any other uploader who can make movies in smaller rip size in 500 mb not more than 1 gb."
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T02:37Z,"@timwmac:

No info on ts or cam source. What is your video format, is it avi or mkv or mp4? I have this movie requested in some of uploaders in their posts for to upload in smaller rip size because 1.46gb and 2.27gb files are not worth for cam or ts release. 
Can u try to compress your 2 parts to one small size because everyone out there are looking in smaller file and fast download speeds. "
,timwmac,2012-11-13T03:07Z,"Rajakumar, will post as 1 file in mkv first thing tomorrow just because you requested it, should be about 700mb or so fully loaded. cheers"
,rajakumar,2012-11-13T14:21Z,"
@timwmac:

Hi, Thanks for great news man. I can wait for a week or another week for my new requested release, no problem take your own time to upload this movie. If u do in mkv format or mp4 format which does not matter for me, quality does not matters now only size matters, take your own time to do it perfectly. I have asked u about to upload a few screenshots of this movie, so I can know how is the video quality. "
,svalley,2012-11-15T14:09Z,"Yesterday, upon the bay stair,
I saw a movie which wasnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t there
It wasnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t there again today
I wish, I wish it would go away...

(But, in case you ARE trying to upload this movie: good effort, try again! :-) )"
