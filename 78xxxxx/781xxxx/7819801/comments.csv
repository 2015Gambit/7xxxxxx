,BrunoHerz,2012-11-19T00:35Z,"Note that in order to prevent the pirate warning pop-up, add in Firewall Application Rules (Avast):avastUI.exe block all connections. Just add this to the list of avast firewall rules already present in Avasts Application Rules. It prevents the annoying pop-up!"
,dhod4ever,2012-11-19T03:30Z,"@BrunoHerz

If you block avastUI.exe to all connection then what about the virus database update? will it still update the virus definition? "
,BrunoHerz,2012-11-19T11:20Z,@dhod4ever The definition updates and all program performance is unaffected. It just stops the warning pop-up. Try it!!
,dhod4ever,2012-11-19T12:19Z,"@BrunoHerz

nice! thanks for sharing that idea.. ^^"
,awannan,2012-11-20T16:55Z,Thank you BrunoHerz
,awannan,2012-11-20T21:04Z, BrunoHerz it doesn't work unfortunately!
,Johnny5PR,2012-11-30T05:10Z,"To stop the warning issue:
Open the firewall, go to the application rules section and block all connections of ""avast antivirus"" only. Don't block the rest of the services. Then, open community tab in the settings menu and uncheck all.
Hope it works for you, like it does for me..."
