For those who havenΓÇÖt heard of holocaust, try and envision a young Metallica playing melodic rock songs. For this is one of the many influences Lars and James grew up on, if you listen carefully to this album you can hear many little licks and riffs that sound similar to future Metallica albums.
Also after listening to Gary Lettice, youΓÇÖll almost swear its James Hetfield.

If youΓÇÖre a fan of doom or NWOBHM this album wont disappoint you. Particularly if youΓÇÖre a metallica fan who wants to discover something else. If I were ever going to recommend any Holocaust album it would be this one. Unfortunately the later albums were quite poor and lacked the enthusiasm of ΓÇ£NightcomersΓÇ¥. Gary LetticeΓÇÖs absence may be a factor but the magic isnΓÇÖt quite there. Enjoy this one folks, as itΓÇÖs the debut and undeniably the best Holocaust album to date.
