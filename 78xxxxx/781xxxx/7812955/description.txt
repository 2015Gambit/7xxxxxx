Biography 
Comprised of childhood friends, lead vocalist and guitarist Andy Schmidt and drummer Brad Booker, later bringing in bassist Kevin Gagnepain when all three were enrolled in the University of Missouri-Columbia, St. Louis's Stir have been making a name for themselves through their extensive touring and glossy power-pop. Originally signed by Aware Records after their showcase at the 1995 South By Southwest festival, their self-titled debut, though rather low budget, received some airplay. Eventually signing with Capitol Records, Stir produced a more focused, radio-friendly follow-up with 2000's Holy Dogs. 


The sophomore effort from St. Louis' Stir, while being the product of obviously talented musicians, fails to show much distinction from the majority of the late-1990s' alterna-pop bands. Though you can occasionally hear flashes of U2 or Big Star in their brand of power pop, the overall radio-friendly nature of songs makes them seem rather formulated. Still, it's altogether possible they have a landmark album in them somewhere.
