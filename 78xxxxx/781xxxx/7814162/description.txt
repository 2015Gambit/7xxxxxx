After looking all over and only finding PAF format portable versions of Photoshop, I just decided to make one myself.

Downloaded from Adobe, cracked by thethingy.  Packed on Windows 7 x32, so it SHOULD run on XP and Vista, but might not.

Some things were removed to reduce the file size (by 500mb I might add)
-CameraRAW Support
-Unneccessary extra fonts
-Bridge
-Extension Manager
-Extra Languages

To run, just put wherever you want it to go and run it.  Moving just the .dat and .exe file without the other generated files will cause settings to reset.


If you have any problems just let me know.
