Released next month on Silhouette Music is the new EP from SynthWave maestro 80s Stallone.
The ΓÇÿBeachΓÇÖ EPΓÇÖs title track is a thing of pure joy. Waves of nostalgia wash forth from vintage synth sounds creating this feel good, slightly Italo, vibe. I donΓÇÖt know whether itΓÇÖs the bouncy mid-ΓÇÿ80ΓÇÖs bassline or the SynthPop melodies, but thereΓÇÖs just something about this track that captures everything we love about retro synthesizer music, and put a smile on our faces while it does it. We covered the Jan Hammer-esque flipside a few months ago Cliffhanger and love it even more now. the rest of the EP is filled with some awesome reMix work from LΓÇÖEquipe Du Son, who turn the title track into a night drive pulsar with a slight Psy Trance feel in the burbling riffs, and and some really smooth, laid back, electronic Disco from The Legendary 1979 Orchestra.
