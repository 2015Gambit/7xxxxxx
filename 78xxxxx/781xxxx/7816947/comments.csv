No, 720p is not better if it's an encoded 720p with the framerate dropped to 30FPS. 720p is better if it's ripped in its native 60FPS. 1080 is still a higher resolution than 720, and with deinterlacing, a 1080i will always be better than a 720p@30FPS or less. 

Either way, this is the native way it is aired on broadcast television, and my agenda is to upload the shows exactly as they appear on TV. 

720p@60FPS and 1080i@30FPS are virtually the same, give or take a few quirks from each. 720p@60FPS has much smoother, progressive motion, whereas 1080i@30FPs has overall better image quality. 

I do have the potential to rip the show in 720p@60FPS, but the filesize will be quite larger than 1080i@30FPS due to the doubling framerate, and for those that still have a CRT TV, this'll work flawlessly and look much greater, especially since CRT has better black contrasts than LED or Plasma.

It's mostly just personal taste though. I prefer 720P@60FPS myself, but for shows with a lack of heavy motion and panning, 1080i is superior. 720P@60FPS is better off for things like sports where the frames change very fast(MMA, Boxing, etc.)"

^ is what I meant.

This is a source file to encode from, but people use it to watch and enjoy it apparently. 1,600 or so downloading the file as we speak. I doubt they are all encoding."

Waste of bandwidth if you download it even though you don't want it, but only an idiot would do that."
,bktheman,2012-11-12T07:44Z,that's lots of Gygabytes for a 40 minute episode :)
,kiwij,2012-11-12T09:22Z,"@SecTPD - Aren't all the 720p HDTV rips, just the 1080i .ts file being converted into 720p? or is this broadcast directly in 720p in some areas?"
,kiwij,2012-11-12T09:25Z,"Also - I'm downloading this version because the WEB-DL rips are only stereo and not 5.1.  If I wanted to re-encode this in handbreak to save space, should I re-encode to 1080p 30hz or 1080p 60hz or 1080i with lower bitrate?"
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-12T17:05Z,"@kiwij
I would suggest 720p@29.970 if it's to save space. You don't really want to convert 1080i to 1080p. There would be quite a bit of quality loss unless you're very good at using filters.

And yes, the rips you see online are usually encoded from a source .ts or they use a capture encoder which encodes as it caps. Not everyone can do it, but I have the ability to change cable video format by switching the signal to my box, so I can capture either the 1080i or the 720p@60FPS, which is how we get broadcasts here."
,Darkness2179,2012-11-12T22:02Z,Great upload as always. Thanks.
,BiffSteele,2012-11-13T04:15Z,"Does anyone else have an issue with the sound being about 5 seconds off?  I have downloaded the rest of season 3, and I haven't had any issues with them."
,markes12344,2012-11-14T03:56Z,"Just seem to have a problem with the movie video freezing for a quick moment then playing again, the hole time audio does not stop, and the video dose still match the audio each time it just simply looks like a pause frame with audio then jumps to the video that matches the audio...

Specs: VLC player, 2x560GTX, i5 quadcore at 4.6ghz, 8gb ram, raid0 corsair 240gbGS

So not too sure what could be going wrong. would the player itself be the problem?"
