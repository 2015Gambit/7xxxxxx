Anna Marie Wooldridge aka Abbey Lincoln (1930-2010) recorded this excellent album 

with Stan Getz in 1991 less than 1/2 year before his death.

The Getz solos are perfect (I don't really believe in perfect)  The Getz solos 

approach perfection.....OK

I've deleted track#5.......If you need to hear it...buy the record
