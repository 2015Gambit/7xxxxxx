,NikephorosPhokas,2012-11-11T09:42Z,"The audio and video are in sync for this one. Get this release instead of ""UFC.On.Fuel.TV.Franklin.vs.Le.HDTV.x264-DX"" which has syncing issues. "
,Zuryk,2012-11-11T11:11Z,"I guess this 'synching issue' explains the 20 minute disparity between this release and the aformentioned.  Thanks for the heads-up!

(Also, according to the file info, this release is only 1.49megs!  Woo!)"
,Djowsef,2012-11-11T13:50Z,Are you going to upload UFC Unrestricted?

,hawkins4,2012-11-11T19:41Z,"Here is how to fix sync issue.
Open vlc and start show
Hit tools
Hit track sync and Adjust track sync
I hit up 5 times and its perfect.
Now you can fix sync issues"
,JonJonConFFFF,2012-11-11T20:05Z,"You can just use VLC shortcut keys (J and K) to fix audio sync issues. For this video, just press K six times."
