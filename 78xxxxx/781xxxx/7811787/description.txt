Description:

His childish innocence wasnΓÇÖt meant to last long, oh no: When little Lucius was born on the meaningful date of June 6th, 1966, nobody expected him to be anything other than a normal little boy. His childhood, spent in a luxurious manor, was as normal as every kidΓÇÖs young years ΓÇô well, except for the extreme wealth of his parents, as Lucius grew up with everything he desired, including several maids, the familyΓÇÖs own butcher and LuciusΓÇÖ private teacher.

Everything changed, though, when Lucius turned 6: His real father, the Devil, appeared in his dreams the night before his birthday, revealing that Lucius was his son.

The Beast managed through Lucius to bring a descendant back to the earth ΓÇô and so it is LuciusΓÇÖ task now to accomplish the missions of the Evil, which is gaining control over the world. Firstly, Lucius needs to get rid of all his family members and the service staff in the manor to be able to make their wealth and powers his.

Equipped with supernatural powers, Lucius starts off to a blood-flooding tour of horror through his house, using hellΓÇÖs powers of telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that will minimize the population of the manor one by one by oneΓÇª
