I have uploaded torrents of these films separately, but I will not be seeding them very long. These files are of higher overall quality, lower bit rate but less jumpy (particularly "Feast of Flesh"), and they do belong together. Given a choice, I'd recommend you download this torrent, of course, and ignore the other two.

Be sure to buy your next movie from Something Weird Video.
