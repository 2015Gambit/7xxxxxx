,tomc100,2012-11-10T07:01Z,"My advice for all conservatives is to seek out, support, and surround yourself with like minded people. Ostracize those that don't share your values for they will surely betray you and do not ever indiscriminately give to charity again. Only give to conservatives. Let liberals and statists die. Never spend money in a blue state again and enjoy yourself while New York and New Jersey have no power and people have to eat out of dumpsters."
