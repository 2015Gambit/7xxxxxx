From former Delta Force commander and New York Times bestselling author of Kill Bin Laden comes the first novel in an explosive new series.
 
After September 11, 2001, Delta Force troop commander Dalton Fury was given the secret mission to hunt down and kill the most wanted man in the world, the details of which were recounted in his extraordinary New York Times bestseller Kill Bin Laden. Now, Fury draws upon his hard-won combat experienceΓÇöand his gift for true-to-life storytellingΓÇöto offer a brand-new series of thrillers that are as close to reality as readers can get.
Meet Kolt Raynor. A Delta Force operator and one-time American hero, he is still trying to make sense of his lifeΓÇöand dutyΓÇöafter a secret mission gone bad. Three years ago, in the mountains of Pakistan, Raynor made a split-second decision to disobey ordersΓÇöone that got some of his teammates killed and the rest captured. Now heΓÇÖs been given a second chance to do right by his country, his men, and himself. But RaynorΓÇÖs shot at redemption comes at a price.


 A shadowy group of former colleagues has asked Raynor to return, alone, to PakistanΓÇÖs badlands. His assignment seems clear: find his missing men and bring them home. What Raynor never expected was to uncover a sinister al Qaeda plot to capture a Black Site--a secret U.S.┬¡┬¡ prison--and destabilize the region. Meanwhile, a ruthless, unknown enemy is on his trailΓÇªand he will stop at nothing to make sure that RaynorΓÇÖs mission is not accomplished.


An intense, gritty work of edge-of-your-seat suspense, Black Site is the first of what promises to be one of the most exciting fiction series of the new millennium.
