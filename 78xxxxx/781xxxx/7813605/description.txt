Live performances of classic VERVE era Oscar Peterson trio with Ed Thigpen.

(AAD)   The tempos are a little faster than the studio sides.  This is one big take

with the last track tacked on.  Recorded live in Ljubljana (can anyone pronounce 

this?) Yugoslavia JULY 29, 1964

Excellent sound for a live recording...CD made in Holland
