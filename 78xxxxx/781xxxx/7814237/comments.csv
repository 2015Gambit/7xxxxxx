What We DID? : Took The 720p Resized,Cropped. Tried To color balance throughout the movie
Audio Was a Nice Line Hence Used MaTiNE's LiNe.since its from a 720p Used a tag as HDTS
Do Check Sample if u have any more queries.


had to look this up to get the details. TvTeam, thanks a lot for the up, you mob are one of the best here, but i don't understand why you don't put up the specs on your torrents here??

was going to dl this coz of the hd in the title, but it appears that it is not actually a new source hd so i'm dling INSPiRAL's 720p. "
