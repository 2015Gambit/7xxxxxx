EP1 is the debut EP by American rock supergroup Smoke & Jackal, released on October 16, 2012 on RCA Records. Mona singer and guitarist Nick Brown and Kings of Leon bassist Jared Followill recorded the EP within a week at Brown's home in Nashville, Tennessee. They mixed and produced the EP and Brown engineered it. A press statement says recording was "fueled by multiple bottles of red wine and a shared fascination with timbre, rhythm, and aural adventure,ΓÇ¥ which resulted in an ΓÇ£evocative and original melding of oceanic rock with bottomless grooves and hypnotic dub textures.
