Second: for those that mayb be having issues getting the serial to work..Here is a backdoor..Got to
C:ProgramDataWinZip
You will see a file in there named WinZip.sureg
Simply choose a Name and a password and put them in the correct spots. Note..You may not be able to access this path. If not that means your files and folders are hidden. If you are unsure of how to unhide them, just google Show my hidden folders in windows 7..And one other thing..when u go to that WinZip.sureg file.you may need to set security for all so that when u save the file it wont want to save as a text file..hope this helps:)"
