Here's whats new ...

Main CS Interface
=============
'use captcha platfrom' is gone and is automatically detected. This means that you can now use apps such as GSA SER which support this feature at the same time as apps which have not yet integrated this feature. You will just need to select the captcha types for apps which do not yet support it.

Save Settings on Exit. This will save your settings between sessions.

Let CS try to solve unknown captchas - this feature will attempt to solve unknown captcha types and use the existing algorithm set when sizes match up. You will still have the ability to receive 'unknown' for types that do match sizes for existing algorithms. In addition a generic algorithm was introduced handle monochrome / black and white captchas.

Captcha Destruction Kit
==================
Character Set - is now a text box that you can free-form edit how you like. So you are not limited to the entire set of Upper Case, Lower Case, Numeric and Symbols. Narrowing down the character set will greatly improve your success rates.

Use Sample Answers - this allows you to specifically define a set of possible characters based on the correct answers you have entered.

Enter your own ImageMagick Command - this allows you to go beyond the built in ImageMagick commands: ImageMagick: Command-line Tools: Convert
the format is: -[command] [argument]
Example:
-blur 0x1
guestbook1

Fixed bug when importing databases (where the same # was used)
