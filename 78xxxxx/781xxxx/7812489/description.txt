This LP was written out of my deep love and respect for the Psychedelic Pop of the 60s. I put a lot of effort in making the best album possible - I'm pleased and thrilled to share it with the world!


MUSIC BELONGS TO EVERYONE - please, download and share my music!


This torrent features all of the tracks in mp3 format, @ 320 kbps. I also compressed the album into a .zip format, as to speed up your wait. 

Enjoy, and do me a favor - take some drugs before listening.
