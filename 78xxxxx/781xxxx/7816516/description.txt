AMERICA VS. THE JUSTICE SOCIETY was a four-issue miniseries published in late 1984/early 1985 (cover-dated January to April 1985). I believe it is the last storyline to take place on the original Earth-Two, the home of the Golden Age Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Flash (Jay Garrick), Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Power Girl, Huntress (Helena Wayne), etc.

The same month that the last issue of this miniseries came out, the first issue of CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS was released, which was the story that merged Earth-Two with Earth-One and three others into a single Post-Crisis Earth.

AMERICA VS. THE JUSTICE SOCIETY tells a story (written by Roy Thomas) of the JSA being arrested and put on trial for treason. The accusation is that during World War II they were secretly Nazi sympathizers following orders from Adolf Hitler. And the star witness against them ... is the late BATMAN of Earth-Two!
