No carl, the guy was obnoxious and you like most others where way too stupid to understand his sarcasm. But by all means, keep going retards. Bitch about seeding and slow speeds in every single fucking comment just to make sure everybody knows that you dont have a clue about how your isp works and how torrents work in general.

It's so refreshing to read."

Quality is great but I have to offer a word of advice to my Law Enforcement brothers and sisters. While this movie realistically shows the daily life and struggles of LEO's, the ending to this movie hits too close to home for most of us who have lost brothers in war or on the streets. DO NOT watch this movie with your family or around other people. Watch it once, enjoy it once for what it is and scrap it or better yet...as great of a movie as this is in so many ways, it might be better to just skip this one if you fit the previously stated profile."
,Scorpiorpio,2012-11-19T09:06Z,One of the best documentaries I've seen in years! I hope this young man got many more medals for all he has been through. Gotta love the men and women who are sworn to serve and protect us all

,Phatfish,2012-11-20T02:41Z,"@Scorpiorpio:

I sadly have to say that I'm actually not sure if you are trolling or so epically overt the top glowingly stupid that it should be physiologiclly impossible for you to walk upright, never mind type on a computer. 

I mean you never know these days.



Anyway, once again:

A/V - Good

M - A nice glorified and disillusioned story on the works of a modern day police officer. Utter simple minded prejudice bullshit garbage if you ask me.
I especially liked the part where they try to point out that firefighters are fucking faggots who cant do their job.
