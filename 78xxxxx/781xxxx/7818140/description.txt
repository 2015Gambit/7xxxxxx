About the Author
Mhairi was born in Scotland in 1976 and has been explaining how to pronounce her name ever since. (With a 'V', not an 'M'. Yes, that's us crazy Celts for you). She is based in Nottingham where she used to be a local journalist and now she's a freelance writer and sometime-blogger, which we all know is code for messing about on Twitter. She likes drinking wine, eating food and obtaining clothes; all the impressive hobbies. Her best anecdotes involve dislocating her elbow tripping over a briefcase and a very bad flight to New York. She lives with a man and a cat.
