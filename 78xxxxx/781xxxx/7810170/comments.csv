,emagnus,2012-11-11T02:50Z,"Agreed, 11th song is cut off. Any luck on finding that complete song?"
,Sabaton40,2012-11-11T17:13Z,"@emagnus Not yet. Apparently the source of this version of the album (with the incomplete song) came from a streaming site in germany. And it's the version everyone has. 
I hope someone uploads it soon :C"
