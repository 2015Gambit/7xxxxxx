YIFY Earns My +1 of Approval!"
,Gliktch,2012-11-14T08:15Z,"SCSA420, Cinavia is a form of PASSIVE copy protection (like some CDs which used to have deliberate errors on the data/audio tracks), and NOT a virus which is an ACTIVE thing.  Cinavia is completely ineffective *unless* you pay for (and support) a player (like PS3 or some standalone players/drives) which actively look for this audio watermarking and respond accordingly (blocking your playing of the protected content without the original media).

Please don't blame or badmouth others for your purchase of (and thus support of companies which produce) purposely-defective players.  Claiming a torrent contais a virus when it does not, is quite insulting especially to someone like YIFY who is well-known for high quality in both his torrents and their contents.

P.S: Yes, letting people know that this MOVIE (not just this release, since it's likely that EVERY copy of this movie in existence contains Cinavia) will be flagged by those defective players, is a worthy action - but the commenter above you has already alerted downloaders to this fact, rendering your post superfluous.

Enough of this, I'm off to download and then play this on a system which doesn't restrict my enjoyment of free, shared media :)"
,jelena87,2012-11-14T08:34Z,Thanks YIFY....
,xtheghost,2012-11-14T20:14Z,"When watching this, the movie skipped 3-4 times randomly. I'm not sure if this was a bad rip, or if I just happened to have an issue with VLC player. Has anyone else had this issue?"
,Bitrader,2012-11-16T01:37Z,"Great movie
the police synths are pretty cool,

Thanks YIFY"
,TGBX,2012-11-16T18:47Z,"Pretty good quality, but yeah, it skips a couple of times more noticeable in the audio than the video, which seems almost continuous. Very watchable, but a little jarring in a couple of scenes. Not sure what's up with that."
,ghenghis1,2012-11-17T05:52Z,"Thanks YIFY, fuck these complainers."
,borhan48,2012-11-17T08:41Z,I'm getting very low download speed for this one. Speed about 5KB/s :(

,Casinoer,2012-11-27T18:23Z,"Took only about 18 minutes to download.
Quality is alright and a great movie (:"
,FureeTutawk,2012-11-28T03:49Z,"@Gliktch
Agreeing with your comment, but really, the players you mention are NOT defective. Your repeated insistence that they are defective is as bad as someone repeatedly saying Cinavia is a virus. Maybe you don't LIKE that they use copyright protections, but hey.. we are STEALING. I admit it. I don't try to rationalize it. I think it's harmless, but it's stealing nonetheless. And people have the right to copyright their stuff. If you created something you'd want to protect your profits, too."
,dubblue4,2012-11-30T18:30Z,thanks
