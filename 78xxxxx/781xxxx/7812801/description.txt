Both struggle with truths theyâ™re hiding from each other – and from themselves. Jenny has rejected her tumultuous family and cut off communication, seeking a more ordered life far from her roots in the Bronx. And sheâ™s almost ready to commit to her longtime fiancé when her sister Lucy – the personification of all that Jenny has been trying to flee – surprises her at a critical time. Lucy and Jennyâ™s combustible reunion brings both of them to unforeseen places, shattering and reconstructing the worlds they have both carefully constructed.
