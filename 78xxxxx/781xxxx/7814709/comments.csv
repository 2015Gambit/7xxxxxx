Ever wonder who is behind those hilarious cat memes? Bravo Media goes inside the Seattle office of one of the largest humor publishers on the internet, ICanHasCheezburger.com with ""LOLwork"". The 30-minute doc-com goes inside of the world of Ben Huh and his eccentric staff as they attempt to make the world laugh five minutes a day by putting nimble yet grammatically incorrect captions on cute photos of domesticated pets and animals.
