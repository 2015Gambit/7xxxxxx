,warvibe24,2012-11-12T05:43Z,What does that mean? 
,susulock,2012-11-12T09:16Z,"I fucking knew that Showtime WOULD NOT have killed off Yvonne Strahovski's character. How you ask? She was on this year's comic con panel. They don't just bring in a character on comic con that is going to die just a few episodes in the season. 
And the Dexter that I know would never *SPOILER ALERT* take fucking over killing. EVER. Still can't get over the fact that Dexter and Hannah Mckay hooked up. *SPOILER ENDS*.

Just when I thought ""Hey season 7 doesn't suck all that much, and then it starts to suck, worse than season 6""

And did you guys notice that the duration of each episode has reduced by about 10 minutes since season 6?
I hate that they recap the previous episode before the start of a new episode and they show what happens in the next episode at the end of each episode. 
It's a stupid excuse for not being able to write 10 more minutes of creative content. 
I don't suffer from amnesia. I mean they release 1 episode a week. Anyone could remember what happened in the previous episodes. 
And I DEFINITELY don't want to know what happens in the next episode. It FUCKING kills the suspense.

IN SUMMARY, FUCK YOU SHOWTIME.

You might be wondering why I'm commenting this on tpb. It's because it's one of the only websites where freedom of speech takes precedence over dumbassery and also because there aren't many comments below(at the time of posting). So there is a greater chance that my comment will be read.

About the quality of this download - it's VTV. VTV=Quality. Nuff said. 
No I did not download this torrent. I prefer mSD because of the smaller size and retention of almost the same quality.

Anyway, I just had to get that off my chest. I feel so much better now. "

@susulock
lol, I agree with you :) Even if you can justify somehow recaps, I fully agree that precaps are just wrong idea in this show. 
I somehow knew that Hannah is a killer and will be with Dex - man I just felt it. I don't know what to think about all this, yet. I'll wait to see what's Showtime idea for this season, and than I'll judge - after 12th episode (only 5 to go... :/ )."
