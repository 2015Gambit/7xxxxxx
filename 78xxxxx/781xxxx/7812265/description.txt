In case you're reeling from disbelief, the 1983 holiday classic "A Christmas Story" has, in fact, been made into a sequel.
"A Christmas Story 2" is going straight to DVD and Blu-ray October 30th. And it's available just days before the debut of the Broadway musical based on the original story of little '40s-era Ralphie and his Christmastime woes.
The film sequel follows Ralphie as a teenager. He no longer yearns for a Red Ryder BB gun, but now wants a 1938 Hupmobile Skyline Convertible. There are a few things that haven't changed: Triple dog dares, and the fact that the old man -- Ralphie's dad -- is still obsessed with that fishnet-stocking-adorned leg lamp.
"A Christmas Story 2" stars Daniel Stern ("Home Alone," "City Slickers") as the crotchety, lighting fixture-fixated dad, and Ralphie is played by accomplished child actor Braeden Lemasters ("Men of a Certain Age," "Easy A").
