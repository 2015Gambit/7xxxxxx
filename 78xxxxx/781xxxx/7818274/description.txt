 Kanji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) is an atheist, who 
 runs an antique shop. For him, God and        
 religion are nothing more than a business     
 proposition as he goes ahead making money     
 by selling the faith of people for his profit 
 His life suddenly is thrown off gear as       
 an earthquake ironically destructs only       
 his shop in the entire area. while his        
 detractors blame it on his atheism that       
 led to God's wrath, Kanji remains unperturbed 
 and finds his victory with the insurance.     
 They promptly reject the claim stating an     
 earthquake to be an 'act of god' rather than  
 a man-made phenomenon.Kanji takes GOD to      
 court when his shop is destroyed by earthquake
