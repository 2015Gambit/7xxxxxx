Quality is low."
[T],SCSA420,2012-11-11T00:33Z,"IF you are such an expert on capturing HD then I invite you to respond to this and inform me as to how to get the BEST quality possible using a Hauppauge HD PVR hardware and VideoReDo H264 software to get the best possible recordings at a file size that is not too big and is as close to the ""scene"" standards as possible. Personally I think you people bitching do so only to feed your ego's but if so the prove me wrong by offering proof otherwise STFU."
[T],SCSA420,2012-11-11T00:38Z,IF you can do a better job then do it otherwise STFU assclown.
,stalker277,2012-11-11T05:13Z,"1st thing, I don't bitch!

2nd, stop whining like a little kid! If you did something wrong, take the damn responsibility for it.

3rd, my comment is here to help others avoid this, and not because I'm an expert or some other s#it you muttered about.

4th, no one's ""stfu""ing! THIS IS THE PIRATE BAY! If we don't help each-other, no one will!"
