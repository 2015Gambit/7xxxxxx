,FeaGaur,2012-11-12T13:47Z,"I can confirm that it does not have eng subs.
For when can we expect this ep with eng subs?"
,ZilEighty,2012-11-12T15:47Z,"Check the comments, fansubs are included. Subs aren't going to be hardcoded and TPB won't allow me to include a zip file in a video torrent either way."
,ogeth,2012-11-12T15:58Z,thanks for being not lazy and upping the ep & the link to subs
,ZilEighty,2012-11-12T16:03Z,I uploaded a copy with subs hardcoded for those who don't want to download the subs separately.
,FeaGaur,2012-11-12T18:02Z,"You are right. Forgot to check the information given on the torrent. Subs indicated are perfect.
Very good quality video and the you can download them from the link provided by the uploader:
