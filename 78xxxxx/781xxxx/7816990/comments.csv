Also, do you have Judge Dredd - The Restricted Files (Volumes 1-4)?"
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-12T07:36Z,"Sorry Ogurek4, I don't have the Judge Dredd - Restricted Files Vol. 1-4, but I'll keep my eye out for them."
,helicon84,2012-11-12T14:48Z,"Thanks for these uploads. Am I right in saying that these are not actual Complete Case Files copies but instead older scans that were put in the right order with the Complete Case covers? It seems to me that the only original is the Complete Case File 01 that was uploaded here a couple of months back. I'm not being negative here, your uploads have been great and you definitely deserve a skull."
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-12T18:25Z,"Yes, helicon84, that's the way it looks.  I didn't put them together, just sharing what I've found.

I'm working on putting together a complete series of 2000 AD and Judge Dredd Megazine.  I'll probably upload the 2000 AD in blocks of 1000 and Judge Dredd Megazine by year if there's interest."
,helicon84,2012-11-12T18:50Z,It'd be great if you could upload 2000AD. What's the quality like? 
[T],blackcanary,2012-11-12T21:42Z,All of the issues are good.  Some (Prog 1400+) having much more vibrant colors (perhaps digital issues?).
,helicon84,2012-11-12T22:04Z,Great. Can't wait.
,Jerknife,2012-11-17T15:30Z,"Hey blackcanary. Thanks for all the uploads, ever since Demonoid went down, I haven't had a comix fix. I was wondering if you could upload Tale Of The Dead Man. It's the prequel to the Judge Dredd epic Necropolis and isn't included in the Case Files. Thanks again!"
