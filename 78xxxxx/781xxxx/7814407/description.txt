The vast majority of the eBooksΓÇöat least 95% of themΓÇöare in the EPUB format (which is the format most E-readers use) while the rest are in the PDF format.

Though most of the titles in this collection indeed are what most would consider to be "well-formatted", by "well-formatted" I mostly mean "readable": You won't, for example, find eBooks that are chock full of OCR errors, rendering them useless and unreadable. So don't get pissed at me when you find titles that use default Calibre artwork, artwork that doesn't use the correct aspect ratio, no indents, etc.

The eBooks were collected from various sources: IRC; torrent sites; eBook stores (yesΓÇöI bought some of them); Project Gutenberg; and some I made myself using texts from various sources.

Lots of these eBooks, as I type this, can't be found on torrent sites which is why I'm choosing to upload them here now on the world famous The Pirate Bay.

Enjoy!
