,Jisnit,2012-11-15T11:25Z,"Fake. This is actually season 5 episode 14 starting with Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags.

Why TvTeam has uploaded this is beyond me."
,Jisnit,2012-11-15T11:26Z,"BTW the quality of the file itself is fine, but it's named incorrectly."
,Jisnit,2012-11-15T11:52Z,"I'm so sorry, ignore the other comments, this episode starts off the same as season 5 episode 14 but it is the correct one. I wish there was an edit button to remove the comment!

Audio and video quality are great and it is definitely the correct episode. Stats:

Video: XVID 640 x 360 P-VOP and B-VOP
Audio: MP3 48000Hz 128 kb/s tot, Joint Stereo"
