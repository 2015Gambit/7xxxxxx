,Seaford,2012-11-15T03:29Z,Thank you for this torrent.  I have also re-ecoded the same torrent you did but I have not uploaded because I am unhappy with the result.  Your audio result is much better than mine.  However I seem to have avoided the blue line at the bottom of all your episodes.  What's up with that?
,evilabbot,2012-11-15T05:15Z,"@Seaford - I don't see the blue line you were talking about at all.. I played the files back with both Windows Media Player and VLC and I didn't see any sort of blue lines as you have described...

Sorry, can't help more than that...I don't have an answer for the ""blue line"" which I don't see :("
,Seaford,2012-11-15T14:35Z,Thank you for your response - VLC shows the blue line at the bottom.  I will keep trying to find the cause and again thank you for this torrent.  
,Seaford,2012-11-20T17:14Z,For everyone's info - the Blue Line at the bottom vanished after a few days - so if you get it -just wait.  Weirdest thing I ever had on a torrent.  Thanks again for the upload.

I hope you will release more Trek torrents, though I will not demand it!

Good job!"
,evilabbot,2012-11-27T17:01Z,"Thank you everyone for the kind comments. I am still learning, so I hope my future torrents will be as good as or better.

I understand Season 2 TNG on BR will be released in Dec so we'll have to wait for that to be available first before I can attempt a re-encode for ""TV size"" (my own term)."
