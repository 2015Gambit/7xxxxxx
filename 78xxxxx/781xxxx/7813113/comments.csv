BULLSHIT !  If you forgive then there is no justice, that is the balance in the universe between bad actions and their punishment, besides forgiving encourages bad people to CONTINUE hurting others with full impunity. Don't hate or fuss or cuss or damn or complain, JUST GET EVEN !!!  THAT will teach the bastards not to mess around with you...
