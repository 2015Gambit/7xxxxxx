Why forgive? When we forgive we are in fact restoring our power.

The last thing you want to do is to think about why forgive somebody that has really hurt you?

If you do stop and think about the negative energy you are consuming and putting out when you donΓÇÖt forgive.

Yes just stop and think about that for a minute. The negative energy coming from your hatred is sending you into a negative spiral.

Why forgive, because if you donΓÇÖt you are only hurting yourself and giving up your power.

Bitterness sets in and this where the law of attraction comes back to bite you! Once you emit bitterness and negativity guess what you get back in return.

ThatΓÇÖs exactly right you get consumed by negativity and hatred.

This generates a slippery slope for yourself. You donΓÇÖt want to take responsibility for anything. Instead you set out to blame everybody else.

I am talking from first hand experience here.

After ten years of marriage and two children, going through a bitter separation is not a pleasant experience.

Why forgive, because otherwise you dig yourself so deeply into a rat hole and itΓÇÖs almost impossible to come out.

Your life becomes full of fear and negativity, not to mention bitterness. Who wants to live like that?

Yes even in a bitter and hurtful separation you can find it in your heart to forgive. ItΓÇÖs not easy!

But when the realisation  hits you that if you donΓÇÖt forgive you get stuck in a time warp of hatred.

This makes you reach out and look for explanations. This eventually leads you to realising that it takes two to tango.

In separation and many situations there are now winners.

So the best thing you can do is to restore your power and that is why forgive.
