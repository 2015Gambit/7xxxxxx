,icelaw,2012-11-10T16:53Z,"Legit torrent, 
This IS BSG: Blood & Crome.

Not long episodes, only 12 min, 
guess they did go with ""webisodes"" rather than real episodes like Battlestar Galactica."
,xidio,2012-11-10T17:25Z,"This is the PILOT episode thats split in 8 parts.
Read the infos everywhere, the 2h pilot is gonna be on Syfy in 2013.

Machinima just bought hte rights or something to show off the first pilot in parts to make some money."
[T],jmanwf,2012-11-11T00:10Z,whats worse is the are region blocking this series cant believe it what a joke
