you gotta create a folder ""graphics"" into library/documents/football manager 2013/ then create the folder here and copy/paste inside.

start the game/reload the skin / uncheck CACHE on interface tab .

if im right ..otherwise ... maybe appdata/roaming/sport interactive/football manager 2013 / graphics (to be created.

but i think the first version is the good one :) "
