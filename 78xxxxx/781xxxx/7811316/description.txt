'Kafka - The Execution'

Fantagraphics Books, 1989

Written and Illustrated by Leopoldo Duranona

This anthology from writer and artist Leopoldo Duranona adapts short stories by Franz Kafka. Duranona's artwork is gorgeous, quite reminiscent of the work of Moebius. Here, readers will find illustrated versions of Kafka's 'The Execution', 'An Imperial Message', 'Before the Law', and 'The Country Doctor'. Oddly enough, Kafka adapts well to visual storytelling, which captures his bleakness and his resignation to the fact that we are incapable of changing the world. In his introduction, Duranona expresses the strength of his connection to Kafka and his message and his hope to bring other readers into the fold.
