NASCAR 2012 Sprint Cup Series Race #35 Phoenix AdvoCare 500 in 720p HD [CARG]

**SPLIT FILES FULL RACE** These files were ripped from YouTube and credit should go to uploader LuisAlbertoPerez2008 . Contains the watermark LP2008 in the upper left hand corner. It is the full race commercial free.
After playing with encoding options, I never found a setting I feel comfortable with so I am just adding the raw split files as a whole in 720p HD. 

Please seed at full speed during and after download so that others can also enjoy and be sure to check out other CARG releases.
