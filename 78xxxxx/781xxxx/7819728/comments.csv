,themismatch,2012-11-13T00:24Z,"Thanks dubzar, did the direct download link work?"
,dubzar,2012-11-13T00:33Z,"It didn't. The Vimeo link worked though so I downloaded it off Vimeo using a Firefox plugin and uploaded to here but it looks like some people were doing the same because there's already seeders and I didn't even seed one bit. You guys are awesome. lol. 

If you ever come across links post them, it can help. We went almost 3 weeks without videos. lol.

Cheers. "

,themismatch,2012-11-13T01:03Z,"Sweet dude, you spoofed the referer? Because when I went to the Vimeo link it gave me the standard ""Sorry, video not available."" Hahaha"
,snahfu,2012-11-13T01:03Z,"for the vimeo link duzar, did you have to use tamperdata? or did you use the php script stuff that thisismatch posted"
,themismatch,2012-11-13T01:05Z,"Definitely dude, I'm thinking about getting that script on auto, so it just downloads the vids and uploads 'em here, but I need a seedbox/server hahaha"
,themismatch,2012-11-13T01:15Z,"Actually it looks like you can just put the Vimeo link in this and it works.

,dubzar,2012-11-13T01:44Z,"This is how I got it working on Vimeo: 
1. Go the SimplePickup forum and sign in.
2. Go to any open topic.
3. Go under the quick response and click ""Go Advanced""
4. Paste the link to the body as if your going to reply to the topic.
5. Click ""Preview Post"". http://i.imgur.com/pfy0c.png
6. Press link now and you should have access to the video on Vimeo. http://i.imgur.com/ocM0O.png

ADDITIONAL steps if you want to download it:
7. Install downloadhelper for Firefox and download video or go to http://savevideo.me in any browser as posted.

It looks like the link themismatch posted works as well.. How did you get vimeo links if you don't mind me asking.. are you a member? and nah seems like too much of a hassle but if you know enough go ahead. lmao."
,themismatch,2012-11-13T02:25Z,"That's actually really smart.

Yeah, I had access to a member account, but not all the bonus shit is on there. We need to pool some $ and get the premium shit.

The Vimeo links are just found looking at the source of the page. Hopefully anyone with an account uses the script to save the links. 

And yeah, my internet is slow as fuck. No way I'll be able to download these and then upload 'em/seed. But yeah, easy setup :D.

I'm missing the links for week 6 through 10, if anyone has those/Project Go account."
,poptart1,2012-11-13T04:11Z,Hey guys can u guys tell me where to get the vimeo links for any possible week?
,fiddydent,2012-11-13T14:28Z,"Hey guys, i'm heaps appreciative and was willing to purchase the membership in a few weeks in order to continue this thing, however it looks like there's no need :)

In saying that, and I'm not really fussed, but is there any chance to get the webcam broadcasts that they do where they answer members questions etc? is that also saved to vimeo post broadcast or not?

irregardless, i'm happy that this is continuing :)"
,snahfu,2012-11-13T20:35Z,+ podcast
,dubzar,2012-11-14T00:06Z,"Seems like everyone wants the podcasts/broadcasts as well.. I'm thinking that it's hosted on soundcloud and the broadcasts probably on stickam. If anyone comes across vimeo ,stickam,or soundcloud links.. Email me them at the email below. Or if anyone has the subscription with these options then contact me so we can rip them..

submitdz(at)gmail.com

Also, triplexim was accepting donations before so he can upload them, but dunno if he still is. If enough people do I think he can probably get them. Doubt it tho cus everyone came here to pirate it. lol."
,ngaplz,2012-11-14T04:31Z,"The impression these guys gave me when advertising project go was that you'd get massive long in depth videos with a detailed analysis of what went down. 

Fucking glad I torrented this shit because they're short as hell. They even use footage from their youtube vids. Still entertaining as shit! cheers dubzar!

And to all the haters... get into internet marketing and you'll find they're not doing too bad. Leave them to their hustle and go get yours!"
,snahfu,2012-11-16T03:00Z,"off topic: but does anyone know how to view private youtube videos?

,lub094,2012-11-17T18:50Z,"I use Internet Download Manager, to download any video from the internet (a button appears above it and you are one click away from downloading it). The program + a working crack are uploaded in this site :)"
