,finchie,2012-11-27T08:39Z,"I didn't have the cash to get the combo of the Red Rocks and Boulder Theater shows...  I might in the future.  I was at the Red Rocks show, it's like an hour drive from where I live.  My 28th Umphrey's show, and one of the best I have seen!  lol

Glad you like it!

I just have"
