South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone
for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the
show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that

their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.

Produced by South Park Studios and Comedy Central.
