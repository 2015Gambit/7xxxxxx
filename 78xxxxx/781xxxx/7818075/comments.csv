,Jell181155,2012-11-12T22:35Z,"Dos not mean to disrespect you green skull, but you overflowing the site with your files. Why don't put them in folders and upload one torrent at the time. Let say 1gig,2gig or ever. Like that you will give other people chance to upload there files and to be seeing too. For the last few day you upload thousands of files separately. When I said ""Stop it"" dos not mean to stop uploading, means ""Do it the smart way"". Again, no offence RosaMannen, just friendly advice. Cheers!!!     "
