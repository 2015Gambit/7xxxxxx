Perfect."
,Bloho_Jo,2012-11-11T08:09Z,"It's real. Cartoon Network uploaded this to their YouTube account (CartoonNetworkEps) and set it to private. It is supposed to go unprivate after it airs Monday for purchase. However, some iOS devices are able to see all uploads from subscribed accounts, even uploads set to private. Some user used that technique to capture it and here it is.

At least that is my understanding. Apparently this iOS leak has been around for quite some time and has never been fixed."

,kbilek,2012-11-12T04:11Z,"It's legit. The epizode is as good as AT gets.

The quality of the video is worse. If I consider it's leaked though, it's fine. It just gets really bad at times."
