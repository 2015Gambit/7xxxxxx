That's right. It sucks that much. Everytime after downloading I have to use MKV2MP4 converter to convert and then view it. I can view it in MKV directly but repeated forwarding and rewinding makes the audio decode a little while after the video decodes. Also I can't seek to the exact time. I am using VLC latest version. You might as well use the mp4 container which is just better.
I wait for your upload for almost everything. Only thing to make it better is MP4 container. Thanks for reading."
