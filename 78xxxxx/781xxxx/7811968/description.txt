Well, these are the offcial learning materials for the DALF certification.
(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_approfondi_de_langue_fran%C3%A7aise to know more about it. Basically, it's the highest certification the French Ministry of Education can give to you.)



The book itself is about 14.50$ on amazon and fnac, but in case you don't have access to it.. here it is :)
I didn't scan it myself, and the quality isn't great, but I didn't find it anywhere on here, so there you go.
