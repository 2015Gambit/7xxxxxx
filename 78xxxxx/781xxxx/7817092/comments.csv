[T],SecTPB,2012-11-12T21:05Z,"Install this package before running the game.

For people on REBUG 4.21 you're going to need the modified 1.02 update package I put below. 

Turn REBUG off and stay in RETAIL mode after installing the update pkg, then start the game from MultiMAN.

The game will load. From there, you can turn on REBUG and use the game as you'd like. 

DO NOT USE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER YET UNTIL MIDNIGHT TONIGHT WHEN THE GAME IS OFFICIALLY RELEASED! YOUR CONSOLE WILL BE BANNED! Everyone has reported being kicked off the server for signing on too early. Be patient. We only got 9 hours to go.

you need to pay someone to downgrade your console. unless you have above average skills you cant do it yourself.

find a modder in your area, costs about $40"
