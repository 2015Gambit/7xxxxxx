,jthoma87,2012-11-12T13:58Z,"He uploads all this for free and you're complaining, geez! Thanks mf-den, great uploads."
[T],mf-den,2012-11-12T14:43Z,"@tcritic: Sry had got caught up with some work so thats why my uploads were late. Castle will be my first upload tmrw provided source comes in early.
@jthoma87: No prob man, I wouldnt take it as a complaint cos i understand perfectly how boring and pathetic it gets when u hav to wait for something for a long time that u were dying to see especially after last week's hell of an episode"
,Arkane7,2012-11-12T16:05Z,"Great upload as usual, thanks for this mf-den. jthoma87 is right, please ignore tcritics comment. We don't mind waiting for quality releases, especially your 150mb files which are amazing quality for that size. It really helps those of us who don't have uncapped internet. Once again, thanks for this upload."
