Set in the 1970s in a pretty corner of India,   
Barfi! is the story of three young people who   
learn that love can neither be defined nor      
contained by society's norms of normal and      
abnormal. Barfi, a hearing and speech impaired  
boy falls in love with Shruti. In spite of her  
deep affection for Barfii, Shruti gives into    
societal and parental pressure to marry a       
'normal' man and lead a 'normal' life. Many     
years later their paths cross once again when   
Barfi, now in love with Jhilmil, is on the run  
from the police. Barfi is desperately seeking   
Jhilmil, who has gone missing. Shruti's         
realization that Jhilmil is autistic makes her  
recognize that true love is really blind.
