the fantastic master of west javanese ethnic pop blues fusion, its like as if taj mahal or captain beefheart were born in java, for years he resisted being pop-ized. he wanted to keep his music pure and satyrical and heavy on the ethnic sound. at the end of his life he looked a lot like mick jagger. only one of about 15 albums. his scratchy yet intricate vocals made all the becak drivers, farmers and fishermen shout in glee. langsung bogoh in Sundanese means 'stupidly overwhelming love at first sight' the song rolls on relentlessly with a great deal of comic overtones and reminds me of Dr John the night tripper's Gris Gris gumbo yaya group in the late 60s.
