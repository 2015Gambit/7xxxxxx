Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 23 (Mental Disorders):

Statistics indicates that every 15 minutes 1 person commits suicide in the USA, with 20 more attempting suicide. Mental disorders (anxiety, depression, phobia, ..) have reached epidemic levels in the West especially after the financial and economic crisis. Drugs, alcohol, and sexual abuse are also major causes of this disease.

(It is expected that mental disorders will reach new heights among the Conservatives after the election of Mr. Obama to a second term.)
