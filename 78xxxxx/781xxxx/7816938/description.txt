The Stoned Immaculate (2012)




Combine rapper Curren$y's stoned, slow flow with his general preference for light, loopy beats and you've got an ΓÇ£acquired tasteΓÇ¥ indeed, plus there's the full-on embracing of weed and head shop culture topped by a prolific nature that's been averaging right around two mixtapes and two commercial releases per year. Still, when it comes to quality control, Curren$y's been closer to his inspiration Lil Wayne than his other inspiration, Master P, and this well-designed multi-producer, multi-guest-shot album deserves a special place in the man's discography, being the first ΓÇ£official officialΓÇ¥ after some one-producer efforts and conceptual (Weekend at Burnie's was all '80s from its cover art to its beats) street releases. Cue the thing up and the rapper welcomes everyone by putting his crossover up front, offering the lazy but feelin' it, ΓÇ£What It Look LikeΓÇ¥ as an easy entryway into an album that's always in his cushy, kushy comfort zone, but always hospitable as well, with a hook or a Wale-type guest shot to keep things interesting. The top-notch ΓÇ£Privacy GlassΓÇ¥ explains the rules with ΓÇ£Kush clouds, sunshine, good times, inspire these dope rhymes,ΓÇ¥ while the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League-produced smoothie called ΓÇ£Take You ThereΓÇ¥ proves Curren$y doesn't suffer from couch lock, taking the listener -- really, the lady listener -- on a extravagant journey in the manner of Ludacris' ΓÇ£Pimpin' All Over the World.ΓÇ¥ Fellow weed Don Wiz Khalifa turns up on ΓÇ£No Squares,ΓÇ¥ yet this clear-headed and convincing ΓÇ£get paperΓÇ¥ cut drops lines like ΓÇ£Rather have my feet hurtin', than my pocket/I chase that my money down, like it said somethin' 'bout my mamaΓÇ¥ and suddenly, it all feels like the ΓÇ£official officialΓÇ¥. The big finish rolls up with Pharrell in classic Neptunes mode (ΓÇ£Chasin' PapersΓÇ¥), Estelle on a cut so sweet it could be on a Tyler Perry soundtrack (ΓÇ£That's the ThingΓÇ¥), and Daz Dillinger on the mike and behind the boards for that old-school menace (ΓÇ£Fast Cars Faster WomenΓÇ¥). If ΓÇ£Jet LifeΓÇ¥ with Wiz and Big K.R.I.T. feels like a woozy finish for such an ambitious album, the familiar can explain it's a lifestyle anthem doubling as an acknowledgment of returning passengers. That's the whole enchilada, and even if the terminally blazed Curren$y is still best approached with the munchies, this one doesn't leave you feeling hungry or stuffed, just fully satisfied.
