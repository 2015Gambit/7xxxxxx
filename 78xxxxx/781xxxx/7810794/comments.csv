I'm running windows 7 ultimate x64. I assume this is for x86 machines. The old version worked fine for me however (1.1.1209). Any fix for this? Cheers for your release."
,DeathsHereditary,2012-11-23T09:46Z,"Oh also, the installer for xsplit in this was detected as 'a corrupt archive' for me after having passed the UAC stage. Hence I downloaded the installer from the xsplit website (1.1.1210.3101) and installed that and then replace xsplit.core.exe with that from this torrent. This then resulted in the above mismatch error."
