In June 2011, Paul Simon ended his So Beautiful or So What tour of small clubs
and theatres in the United States by playing Webster Hall, a historic
1,400-person club in New York.

The set list was drawn from his legendary career and includes several songs that
have not been performed live in many years. Kodachrome, Mother and Child Reunion,
Gone at Last and The Obvious Child are just some of the highlights, along with
songs from Simon's latest album So Beautiful or So What including Dazzling Blue,
Rewrite, The Afterlife and the album's propulsive title track.

Joining Simon on stage are Vincent Nguini [guitar], Jim Oblon [guitar, drums],
Mick Rossi [piano], Andrew Snitzer [saxophone, keyboard], Bakithi Kumalo [bass],
Mark Stewart [guitar], Jamey Hadad [percussion] Tony Cedras [multi-instrumentalist]
