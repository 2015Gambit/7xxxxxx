,IIXVII,2012-11-12T13:37Z,@hurukh  Its slow because I'm the only one seeding the full torrent 
,Anthony2710,2012-11-12T17:38Z,DELAYON you're full of shit
,reynoldor,2012-11-12T17:46Z,Thanks a lot!!! Downloading !!!!
,IIXVII,2012-11-12T17:49Z,Please be patient my upload speed is shockingly slow !

,iTandawijaya,2012-11-12T18:41Z,Seed please :)
,IIXVII,2012-11-12T19:15Z,"@shomibleya I think its compatible with windows , But as a Mac user I'm not too sure . Either way there is no crack available for windows so you'll have to be patient .

P.s don't believe the trolls who claim the fury crack worked for them or the keygen .its bull shit !!!!"
,IIXVII,2012-11-12T19:21Z,"Once downloaded can everyone copy it into the app folder instead of dragging it ,And seed ! That way everyone will get a chance of playing . 

Thanks."
,GoodTunes,2012-11-12T20:29Z,"Do you fucking idiots really think a Mac application could work on a PC?

You fucktards deserve to be confused."
,IIXVII,2012-11-12T20:57Z,"@GoodTunes I'll be polite as possible to you here 
A, its a game not an application 
B, The "" Application "" is PC/MAC compatible 

Now remind the whole world who the "" Fucking idiot"" is oh and the "" Fucktard "" "
,hurukh,2012-11-12T22:28Z,"Come on you guys seed!!! I'm at 57% and it keeps on stopping, then it downloads really slow..."
,solevita,2012-11-12T23:42Z,it works on windows if you have a mac emulator.
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T00:07Z,"@solevita No it will not work , On windows you need a crack for the game to work , On a mac you don't ."
,tpb_fm,2012-11-13T00:52Z,"Hi IIXVII, thanks for put this torrent on pirate bay! When the seed will grow up? I am download this all the day and it's are in 71%, thanks again!"
,Banghal,2012-11-13T01:30Z,"I don't intend to be a wise guy here, but aren't there two torrents with practically the same content already?"
,monsters_ael,2012-11-13T01:35Z,@IIXVII so you say that it wont work in windows even if i created virtual image of mac in virtualbox?
,joppshr,2012-11-13T01:38Z,"@Banghal Just wana to say that, under this torrent there are 2 torrents for MAC where the download won't stop, probably."
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T02:15Z,"@monsters_ael  In all honesty I don't know , I've never used viruabox or mac emulators . I don't want to say yes it will then you come back and say I wasted your time. Wasn't you the guy who installed OS X to play the game ? What happened to that ?"
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T02:17Z,"@Banghal The two are most likely the same but mines zipped so its smaller . And I seen on some of the comments on the other one people saying it didn't work ! Mine I have tested , Played a full season with no crash dumps or errors .
Taken straight from my app folder. "
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T02:20Z,"@tpb_fm Your welcome , There we're two people on 100% they kindly didn't seed !! Just hit and ran lol , I'm the only on 100% now a few on 85% hopefully they stay seeding :) "
,tpb_fm,2012-11-13T02:53Z,"@IIXVII I have a question: when the download finished, its need to install the game or just copy to app folder and click to play? Because I read that needs Steam to install, and I don't have a Steam Account. Thanks!

(Sorry about my english)"
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T03:16Z,"@tpb_fm  
1, copy the zip file to your desktop , that way your still seeding the original file :)
2, Unzip drag to app folder 
3, You dont need steam to play , Just click the FM13 app "
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T13:13Z,"Hey guys , has anyone figured out how to update this yet? I would love to know how please.

Anyone having problems playing it too ? I haven't seen any hate messages yet so I'm assuming alls good :D"
,reynoldor,2012-11-13T14:09Z,"Thanks!!!!! runs perfect in iMac 2011!!

and in spanish language too !!!!!!"
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T15:31Z,"For the people who don't already know there's a good site where you can get mods for fm13 including all the players faces , Team badges , Custom tatics etc etc check it out .

,hurukh,2012-11-13T19:41Z,Game runs really well but I haven't played a lot yet.  Thanks IIXVII!!!
,giraldie,2012-11-13T19:51Z,"Hi, I play skidrow version (Win installer but can play on mac and stable) on my mac. Can you tell me what the different with this ? it is stable like skid row ?"
,scoovmaan,2012-11-13T19:53Z,@IIXVII I have a question: this torrent is different than the torrent of jaymcmelt? Thank you
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T19:58Z,"@scoovmaan , The main difference is mines zipped meaning its 2.2gig vs 3.6gig I believe ? 
Also I seen on his comments some people saying it didn't work , Mine does work I'm actually playing it right now . "
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T20:02Z,"@giraldie I'm not to sure I understand your question.... You say you played Skidrows version on windows? I doubt it as there is no working crack for windows ....
This is stable for mac , I've played a season and a half with Liverpool , No errors at all . Hope this helps :)

@hurukh Your welcome man , Did you manage to update it yet? I can't figure out how :("
,scoovmaan,2012-11-13T20:15Z,"@IIXVII I downloaded jaymc torrent and i had already played one season. It worked great, but on the second season (pre-season 1/07/2013) crashes all the time. This problem happened to you? Thank you"
,IIXVII,2012-11-13T20:30Z,"@scoovmaan No that didn't happen to me , I'm in Febuary 2014 . The only thing I have noticed is in the pre match meeting one of the answers disappears then comes back a second later . I think it maybe my Mac ."
,christiano13,2012-11-14T09:44Z,i have a quesion plz.........what is ''mac'' and who it ia working ?
,giraldie,2012-11-14T14:54Z,"I mean I installed skidrow on my pc with his unstable crack, then I copy all fm13 files to mac, and play it (open on file named fm.app) without crash. (I'm in june 2013)

And i want to ask if skidrow release new update, it is compatible with this version ? since mac version cracked by MONEY.."
,IIXVII,2012-11-14T15:23Z,"@giraldie First off , MONEY didn't crack the Mac version as it doesn't need to be cracked . 
If you installed it in windows then copied the game directory onto your Mac , You don't apply the crack as it will not work !!
There are two updates available ( I think ) but as of yet I can't figure out how to apply them , As the updates for windows are different than Mac ."
,hurukh,2012-11-14T20:21Z,"@IIXVII, I haven't tried the updates yet aren't they going to ""lock"" the game anyways? I haven't encountered any problems yet so I might just stay with this version until then.
FM13 looks like it doesn't have bugs compared to the 10,11,12 versions for now. Let's hope it stays like this."
,IIXVII,2012-11-14T21:23Z,"@hurukh I did try to update but the fm13 exe disappeared , Luckily I still had a copy of it .
Your right there are no bugs in this one so far at least . 
If you do manage to update let me know please :)"
,IIXVII,2012-11-15T01:37Z,"@themobig "" But... if you now, you must have keygen if you want play Football Manager 2013 without bugs and crashes.. "" Really? 

Funny how on a mac you don't need a keygen or crack you silly spamming troll ! Go boil ya head please :)"
,calsal8,2012-11-16T16:40Z,"Denna torrent fungerar utmärkt!! Ingen keygen behövs (för att spela på Mac) och svenskt språk är inlagt. Bara att kopiera den unzippade mappen till ""Program"", starta FM och börja spela!!

Big thanks to uploader!!"
,daviejo,2012-11-17T15:28Z,"hey, when i unzip and then drag the FM icon into my applications it does not play? why? how can i fix this? after i unzip it what do i do?"
,IIXVII,2012-11-17T15:51Z,"@daviejo You dont just drag the FM13 app mate , Drag the whole directory in the app folder , Then click the fm13 exe to play "
,AMacGamer,2012-11-17T22:45Z,"Is there any way that I could make Online mode work? 

Besides that AMAZING TORRENT!!#!"
,IIXVII,2012-11-18T17:48Z,"@AMacGamer Does it not work ? I haven't tried . 
I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work as its the full game , no crack ."
,AMacGamer,2012-11-18T19:18Z,"@IIXVII Well , the game is supposed to be connected to Steam servers. And I can't seem to find out how to connect it to Steam. Furthermore if I connect it to Steam, I'm not sure if it'll have multiplayer capabilities. This is one of the main reason I wanted to get this game, if you could help me with that it would be very much appreciated. 

As I said before though, this game is amazing. Thank you soo so so much. Saved me some $$$"
,AMacGamer,2012-11-18T21:38Z,"@IIXVII Sorry for all the disturbances , but I have an update. I somehow got FM on Steam , but it doesn't have multiplayer capabilities because it says its a ""Non Steam"" game. Football Manager is on the Steam store and I would hate to have to buy it to play online. Please help."
,alexcamp,2012-11-18T21:49Z,"Guys, 

I have the MAC OS running on virtual BOX, quite easy.

Then I copy the FM 13 file to the App folder os MAC OS. 

I run the fm app. Black screen appears, nothing more.

Any idea?

I suspect that the game is actually running, since on documents a Sports Interactive folder was created.."
,IIXVII,2012-11-18T23:52Z,"@AMacGamer Sorry I have the same problem as you , What if you create a steam account and try that ? I don't really play online on fm , Perhaps someone else has found a work around failing that . Fingers crossed for you ! 

@alexcamp I suspect Virtual Box is the issue here not the game , I do have some experience using a hackintosh , And I had that problem before ! The problem was my graphics card wasn't recognized in the O S . Try adding a DSDT for your motherboard in virtual box ( Google it ) I think that may solve your problem . Oh just in case fm13 doesn't run on Leopard . "
,IIXVII,2012-11-19T00:06Z,"@alexcamp  Sorry let me rephrase that .

Basically whats happening is you're running os x on a windows platform ( Virtual box ) I don't think you'll get any games to work like that ( I could be wrong ) . In the last message I mentioned a DSDT you can try that , But again your still on a windows platform . Other than that I can't help you I'm sorry.  "
,ev3ly17,2012-11-19T06:48Z,where to find the editor?
,crapthecrocodile,2012-11-27T15:36Z,Upload the update 13.1.3 please?
,KilroyDK,2012-11-27T19:09Z,"Just for the record: the page skidrowteam.com does NOT have ANYTHING to do with the famous ""Skidrow - .the leading force."". - They are just a bunch of inbreeds who uploads skidrow games found through communities and other sites. - They simply just know where to look.
- They are not even ""the prefered site of Skidrow"" .. as I have been informed from their own admins. - Skidrow does NOT upload to that URL.

- And for ""TurkishToonFan01"" - he is NOT a part of the cracking team of SKIDROW in ANYWAY!. Truth is that he is a 19 yo Turkish boy - living in London, and working as a sales person in a clothing store ! (that is the REAL truth :D)

.. Just a pathetic little kid who tried to get glory on others achievements.

Fact is that NO ONE knows if SKIDROW have given up on the crack.. TurkishToonFan01 just started getting frustrated that more and more people were starting to realize that he has NO association with SKIDROW.

Another fact is that SKIDROW does NOT have a homepage, email or any other from of public way of communication. - So NO comments will EVER come from SKIDROW themselves.. their work speaks for themselves..

Just felt I needed to shed a little light on the bastards who glorify themselves in SKIDROW's good name."
,-Smash-,2012-11-28T18:28Z,"@IIXVII

I clicked the fm.exe many times but nothing happened! I unzipped and moved the folder to another directory. 
Any idea how it works?"
,-Smash-,2012-11-29T15:50Z,It's not working! Waste of time!
