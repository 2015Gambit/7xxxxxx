It is indeed a native 1080p WEB-DOWNLOAD, likely from itunes season pass subscription, or something like that. It is not an upscale HDTV broadcast. The quality on the 1080p WEB-DL are outstanding, and even have a small file size too considering the quality. It is now being offered on quite a few shows like Supernatural, American Horror Story, and Walking Dead."
