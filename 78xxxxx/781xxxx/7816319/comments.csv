Tnx! :-)"
,crumrugin,2012-11-12T04:22Z,"Beautiful cam job V/9 for a cam..not a ts however so there is echo even tho the mic was a good one so A/6 great job ..would have been perfect if they had a line feed , also I saw a little sync issue but that might be my skipping around and a slow pc worth a watch if no great ts comes out soon"
,crumrugin,2012-11-12T06:16Z,sorry but I'll revise my rating to V/7.5-8 and A/4 as the cam mike makes this worth waiting for a ts.asfor the vid it is great some places but not all
,.Leto.,2012-11-12T12:48Z,Decent video quality but audio is so AWEFUL that it's unwatchable. Even with earphones you can't understand what they're saying. Wait for a better release. 
,svalley,2012-11-12T14:29Z,"Highly recommended!

Very good CAM, definitely watchable! :-)

Thank you! 

Ps

The numbers are, for a CAM:

Video: 10

Sound: 3-4 (but it works for watching what is essentially a visual experience-and a good one!). "
