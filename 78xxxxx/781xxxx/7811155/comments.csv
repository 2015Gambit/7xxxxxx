,Abaris777,2012-11-11T03:27Z,The ''Vita Century Guitar'' installed properly and works...all this the first time i tried.....i used ''as an administrator'' so probably that was the solution....
,Abaris777,2012-11-11T03:28Z,ooops my bad.....the Concert guitar needs an activation code..... :)
,Abaris777,2012-11-11T03:31Z,"LOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

out of nowhere i clicked ''restore activation''(blue letters) and straight away the yellow button ''activate''

AND IT WORKED!!!!!!!!!! (concert guitar) Ill try  the soundtrack one


HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA "
,Abaris777,2012-11-11T03:48Z,"Ok, same process with the ''Soundtrack Percussion''.

1.Open the program (as an admin.)

2.Go to Vst instruments and click on ''Soundtrack Percussion''.

3.It will ask for an activation code but don't worry fellas, click on ''Restore activation'' (with the blue letters).

4.Doing this will send you to the www.magix.com website, IGNORE IT.

5.Go back to MAGIX and STRAIGHT-AWAY click on the Yellow ACTIVATION button (which is just above ''Restore activation'').

6.VoilĂ ! A message will appear that says that it is activated.

7.SPECIAL thanks to _trialanderror_

Gd on ya mate!"

[T],trialanderror,2012-11-11T17:45Z,Thank you for this hint. It didn't work for me at first because i forgot to replace the protein file again after updating the program. It seems that all you need to do is clicking the activate button for those two instruments that ask for registration.
,PilotD,2012-11-14T16:05Z,"Please seed, download speed horribly low... 48 kb/s ATM..."
,PilotD,2012-11-14T19:25Z,"OK, now, All the instruments asked for activation. But I followed what you guys suggested; quickly pressing ""Restore Activation"" and then ""Activate"".
Worked! :) Thank you so much, sir!"
,Dragonisseth,2012-11-21T02:57Z,"nvm, got it. thx for upload =)"
,Taikutsuna,2012-11-28T11:44Z,"Excellant Upload. Thanks. When using these instruments... only click them ONE TIME to listen to them and or DRAG them to the work area. this will keep the error from happening. Another cool thing is under ""File Management""... you can add or sample from any of your MP3s. "
