Information
------------------------------

Reporter Jonathan Miller and director James Brabazon travel to Indonesia, the world's fastest growing tobacco market. Aggressively targeted by global tobacco giants and with minimal controls on advertising, the country is in the grip of a smoking epidemic with the proportion of child smokers rising dramatically. And, as Unreported World reveals, young children are not only smoking regularly but some are risking their health by harvesting and processing tobacco bought by of the UK's biggest cigarette companies.
