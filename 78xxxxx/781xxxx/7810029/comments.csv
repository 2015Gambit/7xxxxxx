Bill passed away today.
Well anyway, Jack's pigeons are always there.

Thanks albiondean"

by the way, thanks for the [Get me out of here]  commercial Dean
I hate commercials as a rule, but your british spots are so entertaining.  
If you let the ocassional one slip through, I promise I will enjoy it.

thanks again for all of the above."
