Ultimate Guide to Wilderness Living: Surviving with Nothing But Your Bare Hands and What You Find in the Woods

EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT SURVIVING IN THE WILD

ΓÇ£During my first years of learning survival I took a course in survival and primitive earth skills taught by John and Geri McPherson. I was excited by their unbelievable passion and their intrinsic understanding of survival. Their teachings took me from understanding basic skills to a full-blown love for the ancient technologies that humans developed to survive. John and Geri are the real deal. They donΓÇÖt just teach this stuff, they live it. I loved the experience with them so much I came back a second time a few years later. Now that I have traveled the world as SurvivormanΓÇöexperiencing and filming survival in every ecosystem there isΓÇöI can sit back and watch my shows and see John and GeriΓÇÖs teachings peek through in every situation. I have been able to understand survival because of John and Geri, and can highly recommend this book.ΓÇ¥
