BTW the future is hi-def audio/video, so thanks for this.
Artists take note. You went to all that trouble to record your stuff and you know how it should sound, make it available in a format that captures all the effort you put into it. Some sort of universal lossless format.
I'll say it again: hi-def audio is the future.
Or the present for some of us. "
