The file plays in media player, media player classic & nero showtime but no sound and when i try to play it in quick time I get error -2041: an invalid sample description was found in the movie. any help would be appreciated as the picture looks great and was looking forward to watching it with the kids."

update codecs to latest"
,Tazadar3,2012-11-25T22:42Z,"If i was to recomend something to use i would say VLC :) And if u still have probs with audio or video, get GSpot. GSpot is a small prog that ""checks"" the video file u have, then gives u info about audio and video, and most important, if u have the codecs needed to get audio and video when watching, and if u dont it tells u what codecs u need..
just google Gspot codec (remember codec or else u get a lot of hits :P )"
