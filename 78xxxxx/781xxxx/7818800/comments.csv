The latter looks pretty darn good............"
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-13T00:30Z,Screw it... I'm going to see this one in the theatre. I'm not taking a chance on crap audio ruining a potentially great flick.
,nadith,2012-11-13T20:36Z,stunning action movie! this quality is watchable but if you want a better one check filmseed.rdsok.com worked better for me.

,yob09,2012-11-19T04:29Z,"agent666 is right this copy is a very good quality I gave it a/v=9, m=10, @michaelrwatson, who cares? go watch it in cinema but here at tpb its free. you just need to know who are the trusted downloader and scene4all doest is again....tnx s4a

@rajakumar, if u want it in smaller size go find YIFY's download if he has available copy, he usually dl movies in smaller size like what u ask."
