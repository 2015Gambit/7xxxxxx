Description: Pushing the limits of what fans can expect from the record entertainment franchise, Call Of Duty: Black Ops II promotes players in the near future of the 21st century, the Cold War, where technologies and weapons come together to create a new generation of wars!

Is the ninth game in the Call of Duty series and the direct sequel to Call of Duty: Black Ops. Developed by American studio Treyarch. The official announcement of the game - May 1, 2012.
 In single player action is taking place in two time intervals - in the near future (the main action game that was originally planned when creating the game), and during the first Cold War.
