Book Description
With the iOS 6 software and the new iPhone 5, Apple has two world-class hits on its hands. This sleek, highly refined pocket computer comes with everythingΓÇöcellphone, iPod, Internet, camcorderΓÇöexcept a printed manual. Fortunately, David Pogue is back with this expanded edition of his witty, full-color guide: the worldΓÇÖs most popular iPhone book.

The important stuff you need to know:

- The iPhone 5. This book unearths all the secrets of the newest iPhone. Taller screen, faster chip, 4G LTE Internet, thinner than ever.
- The iOS 6 software. Older iPhones gain Do Not Disturb, the new Maps app, shared Photo Streams, camera panoramas, smarter Siri, and about 197 more new features. ItΓÇÖs all here.
- The apps. That catalog of 750,000 add-on programs makes the iPhoneΓÇÖs phone features almost secondary. Now youΓÇÖll know how to find, manage, and exploit those apps.

The iPhone may be the worldΓÇÖs coolest computer, but itΓÇÖs still a computer, with all of a computerΓÇÖs complexities. iPhone: The Missing Manual is a funny, gorgeously illustrated guide to the tips, shortcuts, and workarounds that will turn you, too, into an iPhone addict.
