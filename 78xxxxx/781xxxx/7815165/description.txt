GAME INFORMATION:

Football Manager is the best-selling, most realistic football management
series ever made. Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years of games from
the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an array of new features

This year s version allows you to take control of any club in more than 50
nations across the world and includes all of Europes biggest leagues as
well as database of over 500,000 real-world players and staff

As well as some landmark new features in the Career Mode, there are now new
ways to enjoy your Football Manager experience

NEW TO CAREER MODE

Match Engine
The 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything on the
pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the players movement
intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air

We ve also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel more
realistic and we ve made the whole experience more televisual by
introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final whistle

Manager Roles
Another notable difference is the significant restructure of the manager s
staff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is that we ve
introduced the position of Director of Football into the game for the first
time, which will allow managers to pass on some of their workload, such as
contract negotiations, if they choose to

In addition to this, we ve also increased the number of specialist coaching
roles within the game and given the manager greater flexibility to choose
which coaches offer advice and when. The manager can also choose to
complain about boardroom interference although that particular option
should probably be used sparingly

And much more
