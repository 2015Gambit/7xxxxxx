It works fine."

,rwdmac,2012-11-11T21:11Z,"Hey, I'm a Mac user (10.8.2 OS X Lion) and I cannot install or load this game. I have followed the steps;

1st step: Open .dmg file
2nd step: Drag and drop Football Manager 2013 folder to Application folder
3rd step: Go to the Football Manager 2013 folder and just open the FM.app


But I cannot get it to work! It just crashes and says cannot find database or lang_dat.db etc etc.

Don't fancy having to install windows just to play this game either if there is a better work-around.

Any ideas? "

Thats wierd works fine on mine!

try this: 

if the game crashes unexpectectly, remove Sports Interactive folder in
/Users/XXXXXXXX/Library/Cache (has nothing to do with the crack)"
