I can inform you that the game is working :D Atleast on Windows 7, 64Bit

That will fix the problem with black screen than popup with error..


This helped atleast me :)

If you have already installed the game follow these steps:

64Bit:

C:Program Files (x86)ActivisionCall of Duty Black Ops IIredist

And open & install vcredist_x86.exe
When done go here:
C:Program Files (x86)ActivisionCall of Duty Black Ops IIredistDirectX and run DXSETUP.EXE


32Bit: Same exept (x86)

Windows 7 x64 SP1
Amd 1090t
8GB DDR3
MSI GTX670 2GB


Installed the game, ran through DX and Visual Studio setup.  Copied content from Skidrow folder.  Manually set a firewall rule to block all incoming and outgoing communication with the t6sp.exe.  Tried to run game and noticed t6sp.exe is running in Task Manager but nothing is actually happening.  Read some comments about changing time zone to +8 Bejing and that did have an effect, but running the game gave me an error in Windows that program stopped working.  Close that error and there is another error, in the background in the games single player console window.  Close that, install this crack and basically same thing happens.  I've been doing this for years and typically when these things happen it takes a few days..sometimes less to get a real working crack.  Sometimes though, some genius somewhere comes out and says ""oh hey just change this and that and you're good to go""  No biggie.  Rarely have I seen a whole torrent turn out bad.  Just the crack.  I've been doing this for the last 8 years.  I've been a broke ass mufucka because I've spent all my cash on hardware."

Zombie Mode shortcut launches correctly and pulls up a Black Ops 2 menu that says: ""Black Ops 2 ZOMBIES"" and the options are: ""Online, Options, Campaign, Multiplayer, Quit"".

#5- If you open steam , after cracking the Game , Steam will update , and the Crack is Fuked.
You'll probably need to Re-install the Crack fix.
( I used the Crackfix Posted By @3R01, on page 5 of this torrent.

That is ALL you need to make this work , if it STILL doesn't it's NOT the Torrent. 
BTW, I am Running Win 7 ultimate x64.
Don't know 'bout the rest , Sorry.

It's NOT a Hard thing to Do. If your STILL unable to Run it, then Ask your MOMMY'S to buy it For you.

""Error quit was not requested in the main thread""

I then googled this error, and was not able to understand this fix because when I go to my control panel for Nvidia, there is NO tab that has program settings or select a program to customize - there are just side panels of Video, Stereoscopc 3D, Display, and 3d Settings... here is what I found:

""I fixes the problem. Try to do this:

to fix this just go to your Nvidia control panel then

-got to program settings.
-select a program to customize. (C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommonCall of Duty Black Ops II/t6mp.exe,t6sp.exe and t6zm.exe)
-go to ""Select the preferred grapchics processor for this program' and select High-performance Nvidia processor.

You have to do this process before with t6mp.exe, then with t6sp.exe and then with t6zm.exe. ""

,EXOXE1980,2012-11-15T03:11Z,"malek09, I, and most others, are trying to get the game running to have a go, to see if its worth purchasing, just because their is hype, and a band wagon, does not mean its for everyone, diffirent strokes for diffirent folks, if I eventually get to play the actual game and like it, then I will definitely fork out the $109 AUD for it for my PC and the $99 for my XBOX360 version for my kids! But their is no way in hell I am going to fork out that much money, only to find I only like 1 level of the game and the rest are crap, etc, once bitten, twice shy! And this is the whole reason why these scene people buy the game, crack it, and release it, for us, to give the full game a go and make a decision on that, you cannot base a purchase decision purely on hype, speculation, and most of the time even a game demo which is usually cut to pieces anyway!

If you simply download games purely because you are a tight arse, then you deserve a swift kick in the ass! I can understand people that struggle to live day to day, and struggle to stay online, loving the game but unable to afford it, but I despise these imbred trolls that brag on about this and that, can afford it, but just don't because they sit on their machines all day downloading as much products as possible, without paying a cent, then whinge about this or that, when they got it for free to begin with, and wont even pay a red cent to support these publishers/developers, Film Makers, Music Artists, etc, its a pure shame, as it fucks things up for everyone else, The Pirate Bay was not launched and run for those reasons! How about shutting your gob for a change, and help, instead of simply running around whinging like a little bitch on heat! Make a donation or two to these people that provide your addiction? instead of running them down, which will end up getting them so fedup, they will shut down and all of us people that are doing the right thing, will have to go without once again!"

Seriously though, I love this game, and hope everyone that downloads this version and likes it, goes out and supports developers like this, as the more people be honest and buy it, means the more DLC for this game in the future, as well as a much sexier and grittier Black Ops III in 2013 if this version does good in the retail world!

I tried EVERYTHING to make it work and finally found the only problem was I did not install THEIR version of the redistributables.

Follow these directions!:

1.Install the game

2. Install DirectX and Microsoft Redistributeables at the end of the installation!  (Make sure to do this!, if it gives you an elevation error then navigate to game directory>redist and install both manually.

3. Copy the crack to game directory
4. Install Steam

yeah, that was the key thomas_gabriel. Date = 11/14/2012, and run as admin. I've modified a batch script to do all this for me. Just save the following in a text editor as a file with the .bat extension. Also right click t6sp.exe and go to compatibility tab, tick the box for run as administrator. Also you'll need to modify the lines for the location to cd to where t6sp is located and the time zone you reside in. Here is the text:

*FIFTH: SET YOUR DATE TO 14.11.2012 ( DD/MM/YY ) - CHECK & FUCKED AROUND WITH THE TIME ZONE

People try to be normal, this is free (Torrent) and SKIDROW is not asking you to buy it from them or telling you to download so shut up!~ and only say didn't work for me, according to few or most users the game is working and for those who downloaded and the game worked plz tell others how the heck you installed the game so others can play the damn game!!!~ as well.

,Med1a2r,2012-11-16T03:44Z,"Hi there. While I am hugely appreciative of the efforts of SKIDROW and the various uploaders here, I too am victim of this not working. I get the 0xc0000005 error that many around the Interwebs are experiencing, mine happens when I try to launch the sp game. I figured I'd post here in the hope that someone else had solved this issue and could tell me how. My procedure: Install game, copy all SKIDROW content to game directory (overwrite), block game in fw. No joy.


Many thanks!"

,HeavyMetal1021,2012-11-16T08:58Z,"OK...I fell into the category with everyone else where the game either wouldnt start (unhandled exception) or it would get to a black screen. But, I fixed it by doing these steps(I dont know if they are all pertinent but I would do them anyways :
1 - Download and Install steam
2 - Update all video drivers then restart computer
3 - Download and install COD-BO2 and DirectX and C++ redist. and copy crack over to install folder

I had tried 11/2,11/14. My suggestion is to, if its not working, make sure to try all the dates. Give that a shot first before getting new crack, downloading drivers, cause I bet it would have worked if I just tried that first, and it took the better part of an hour. I have NEVER had an issue installing a torrent like this one was though. It was a pain in the ass and I was damn near done trying. So long story short try changing the dates around if you have tried everything else and you still get the Black screen with cursor. SKIDROW thank you as normal I personally appreciate what you do."

Really got it to work, first time it didn't, it even stopped starting... so i unistalled, and installed again, using DirectX and C++ at the end (repairing installation), updated NVidia drivers, steam running and updated windows. Before start, blocked exe on firewall and changed date... 14/11, and GMT +8. It worked, and stopped working as soon as the date hit 15/11, so changed back and working again.... try it several times, you might get it.
And BTW people really need to stop bitching about seeds, i got it in about 2 days, and didn't die in the process, and FYI you get as much from leechers than seeds, as a torrent is split into a ton of parts. You ppl should bitch about capped up speeds"

point that program to the Black Ops 2 installation folder and run it. Single player campaign should then work. Only weird problem I've had is that whenever I die the game crashes to desktop."

,daveb101,2012-11-19T01:24Z,"Hi all... this is the one an only time I've ever commented on PB, but I thought I’d help people out.

After spending about 3 days moving my time zone / date back and forward, applying every crack I could find, installing steam, updating video drivers with no change (getting unhandled exception error).  It came down to 1 simple thing… installing all updates for Windows 7.  I read it in a few places hidden amongst the time zone fix comments, and it worked for me.

Use the Windows update service to patch you pc (that is if you’re running Win7).  To at least SP1.  But hey.. may as well put all important updates on there.

I’m now able to play COD with no stuffing around in time zones, date moves etc.

Can’t guarantee it’ll work for you.. but it’s worth a try."

The crack works. Stop whining like infants u bunch of fcktards who cant get it to work.

If your game doesn't work, y not do the fcking obvious: Update ur video card drivers, directx, physx, c++ etc and if it's still not helping download another fucking crack. Theres at least 3 versions of the crack now so its bound to work. Use your fcking brain, dipshits.

And those retards who keep complaining about slow downloading speed: DEAL WITH IT. Look up torrent tuts and optimize ur speed, try a different port and get a fast net connection. Its simple. You're not babies. 

Pity zombie mode is now an online only mode (i.e. no more offline SP mode) and the campaign's just as cliche and cheesy as ever before. "

yesterday, in a last act of desperation, when my internet connection failed and I was too annoyed to do anything, I tried running the game again, knowing that the minute I start playing, it will crash. as I began playing, the game continued flawlessly and by god was it great. all the while my internet connection down. I even paused the game for like 30 minutes and crancked the resolution to maximum, and when I came back it was still working fine, and my internet connection is still down. I was so happy I didnt even mind the long loading screens. when my internet connection came back I restarted the game and it crashed, I disconnected it and it ran fine again.
hope this works for u."

The world doesn't revolve around you. It wasn't made just for you. It works for other people like me. ""Fuck Steam""? Bro they have one of the biggest selection for PC gaming, while offering them cheaper. They're discounts are usually always 50% off, or even more than that. Gamers are pompous dickheads? You're certainly proving it the way you're acting like a fucking idiot. 

Doesn't work for you? Then go fucking buy it. Be happy this was even released."
