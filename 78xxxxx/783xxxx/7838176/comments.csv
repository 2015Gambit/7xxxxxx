The HUD no longer disappears when editing license plates under some circumstances
Everyone who pre-ordered Need for Speed Most Wanted should now have access to the bonus content in-game
The game no longer hangs on the loading screen whilst accepting an invite under some circumstances
The game should now uninstall properly without leaving certain .dll files behind"
,IndigoAK,2012-11-18T18:21Z,"Yeah, most of those changes are pretty much exclusive to online functionality, so for people who've pirated the game this isn't really necessary."
