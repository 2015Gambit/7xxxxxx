With all the recent (and many) uploads of the 2007 live performance, I wanted to share this remastered vinyl of the legendary 1973 show at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

4 LP 180 gram Box Set (Swan Song R1 357564). Includes 6 previously unreleased tracks. Half Speed remaster overseen by Jimi Page.

Viny transfer made using the following great gear:

Turntable: VPI Scoutmaster Signature Plus
Tonearm: Trans-Fi Termninator
Cartridge: Audio-Technica AT33PTG
Preamp: Pro-Ject Tubebox

All tracks properly tagged with Artwork embedded.

Thanks to PBTHAL....
