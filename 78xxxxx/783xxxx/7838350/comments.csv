Do you have Vol 67,68,72,73,74?
My PH collection seems a bit incomplete ;)

Cheers!"

I'll have all of those episodes in weekly form (a couple of them are uploaded by others as DVD Rips here on TPB) but it will be a while until I get around to upping them as I am still working on episodes from 2005.

Oh yeah, and as far as I know, Tainster has started to re-number certain parties, like they did with #70 (an old party from 2006 - I think) It seems like the new #74 is an old party too."
,daonebomb,2012-11-23T12:23Z,"Oh alright :) thanks for the insight ... I searched and searched but i couldnt find the above mentioned volumes anywhere so i asked ... It's probably because of tainster's dodgey numbering ... From now i'll follow you and keep an eye on your torrents and will seed them too. If its not too much i'd request you to up my requested volumes as single files.
Thanks for all your help ;)
Cheers matey :)"
