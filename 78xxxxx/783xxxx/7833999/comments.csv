Hey MPAA: FUCK YOU."
,darkko,2012-11-17T23:04Z,"well, had to come back and update my initial rating. after streaming it to my tv, i realized the sound is somewhat jacked(hallow). i'm finding it a but hard to make out some things they are saying, so i'm going to wait for the actual dvd rip.

V - 8.5

A - 6.5

THANK AGAIN! "
