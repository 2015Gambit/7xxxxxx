As usual, save any activation with the included Tokens manager and keep the save in a warm cozy flash drive or cdr or something in case you have to reformat.

Enjoy,

,murphy78,2012-11-17T01:07Z,The activator is not a hacktivator.  It does not modify any windows files.  It is just a frontend for the slmgr.vbs built-in activation tool for kms servers.  I would not include some of those hacktivators that are still very buggy and don't behave like legit activation.

,murphy78,2012-11-18T06:44Z,I have no idea if it calls it genuine or not.  Honestly I just keep deleting all the files on my flash drive and copying all new ones.
