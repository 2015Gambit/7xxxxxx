  New Jersey emo-leaning rockers the Early November disappeared after their ambitious 2006 sophomore album The Mother, The Mechanic, and the Path. That album's massive three-disc span might have reflected the overwhelming pace the young band was running at, and things ground to a halt on the Early November front shortly after its release. Six years later, the group's third album, In Currents, found the band reunited and sticking mostly to their original sound, but with a few new developments. The sometimes aggressive, slickly polished pop-punk and emo that defined their earliest work is still intact, but In Currents features several slower, more gentle moments, such as the acoustic-based song "The Digital Age," a reaction to the state of the music industry in the internet era. The album was recorded and produced by the band in lead vocalist Ace Enders home studio.
