Guess it's cut into 5 shows for tv?"

The American broadcast was severely edited. AFG's release comes from the British broadcast via FoV's release. The Secret Of Crickley Hall originally was 3 x 58 min but BBC America needed space for commercials and so they cut out over 40 minutes and made it one long movie.

Since i am no fan of AFG here is my upload which has all 3 episodes. It has been on iTunes for weeks now.
