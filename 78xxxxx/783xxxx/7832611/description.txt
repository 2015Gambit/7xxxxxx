   Drug discovery originating in Africa has the potential to provide         
   significantly improved treatment of endemic diseases such as malaria,     
   tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. This book critically reviews the current       
   status of drug discovery research and development in Africa, for          
   diseases that are a major threat to the health of people living in        
   Africa. Compiled by leading African and international experts, this       
   book presents the science and strategies of modern drug discovery. It     
   explores how the use of natural products and traditional medicines can    
   benefit from conventional drug discovery approaches, and proposes         
   solutions to current technological, infrastructural, human resources,     
   and economic challenges, which are presented when attempting to engage    
   in full-scale drug discovery. Topics addressed are varied; from African   
   medicinal plants to marine bioprospecting, pharmacogenetics and the use   
   of nanotechnology. This book brings together for the first time a         
   collection of strategies and techniques that need to be considered when   
   developing drugs in an African setting. It is an unprecedented and        
   truly international effort, highlighting the remarkable effort made so    
   far in the area of drug discovery research by African scientists, and     
   scientists from other parts of the world working on African health        
   problems.

  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :
  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :
  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:
