Taken spans five decades and four generations, and centers on three families: the Keys, the Crawfords, and the Clarkes. Nightmares of abduction by extraterrestrials during World War II haunt Russell Keys; the Roswell incident transforms Owen Crawford from ambitious Air Force captain to amoral shadow government conspirator; and an alien visitor impregnates an unhappily-married Sally Clarke. As the decades go by, the heirs of each are affected by the machinations of the aliens, culminating with the birth of Allie Keys, the final product of the aliens' experimentation and the key to their future.



2 Jacob and Jesse
Years after Russell Keys left his family, he saw his son Jesse on the UFO. When it was over, Russell went to see his son, but his mother and her husband would not let him. Jesse sneaks out and joins Russell on the road. In Roswell, Col. Owen Crawford has been failing in his mission to discover the secret behind the alien spacecraft he found 10 years earlier. Owen goes undercover to find out the Clarke family secret before the project is shut down.
