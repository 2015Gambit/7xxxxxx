Notes

 Comes with a booklet insert.
 Although Rick was founder and member of the group Trace, he is mentioned separately on the cover.
 Maybe because it was more a solo project than a group effort and/or for commercial reasons.
 This LP is a concept album, van der Linden's musical interpretation of an old Dutch legend about
 "The White Ladies," which dates from the Middle Ages.
