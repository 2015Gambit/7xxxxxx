Your other upload of this has been deleted."

Later I read that that was not necesary, descided to delete the torrent and created a torrent currently seeding with the same name but wit a single file (.ISO).
 I would appreciate to delete both  refferences so I can start from scratch but for some reazon the torrent refference to the torrent with (17files) cant be eliminated from thePirateBay."
