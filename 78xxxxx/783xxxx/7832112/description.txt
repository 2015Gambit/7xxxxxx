Bloodshot v1 #0-26 (of 51) (1993-1995)
Publisher:  Valiant
Publication Date:  February 1993 - April 1995

Bloodshot was created by Don Perlin and Kevin VanHook in the mid 1990s during a wave of popularity for the Valiant Universe. Bloodshot became an immediate hit with readers, as the first issue had sold close to 1 million copies. Bloodshot has become one of the most popular Valiant characters continuing a long run and selling millions of copies until Acclaim Entertainment purchased the Valiant Universe for $65 million. Bloodshot was re-booted (with the majority of the other Valiant Universe characters) under the banner of Acclaim Comics in 1996. Acclaim re-launched the title in a new direction that was more easily adaptable to video games which was Acclaim's core business. Valiant Entertainment is the current owner of the Valiant Character Catalog, including Bloodshot.

Bloodshot is the perfect confluence of military necessity and cutting-edge technology.

A broken soldier brought back from the brink of death by revolutionary nanotechnology, a billion nanocomputers surge through his veins like an electrical storm, tapping into the full potential of the human body.

But while his physiology is the blueprint for the perfect soldier (able to heal, interface with technology, and even shape shift his mass), his oxygen-starved brain has lost its memories.

While Bloodshot canΓÇÖt recall his past, Project Rising Spirit will fill in the blanks -- whether in Kandahar, Tehran, or New York City; they will create the perfect soldier for the job, one mission at a time.

Valiant relanched Bloodshot in 2012.  The ongoing comic series is written by Duane Swiercynski.
