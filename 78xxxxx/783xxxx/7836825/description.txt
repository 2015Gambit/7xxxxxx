Described as "an addictive album with a retro edge," Bloody Hammers was recorded and produced at NC's Greystone Studios. Named after the atomic Roky Erickson & The Aliens song of the same name, BLOODY HAMMERS play dark, hallucinatory heavy music that is as primitive and powerful as a dry stone wall and propelled by bassist Anders Manga's captivatingly haunting voice.
