,caribou24,2012-11-21T05:50Z,I couldnt stop watching this show in S1 and into S2 but it has now become ridiculous and the Whole US adminstration is corrupt and murders including Olivia. I can not believe the script writers can actually write this stuff. Ok it is a TV show but give us a break!.. Maybe it could be classified as a Comedy from now on? Ridiculous plots
