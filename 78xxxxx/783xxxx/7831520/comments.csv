,HeOfMalice,2012-11-21T13:12Z,"Just downloaded this and am having troubles. I've done this before so it's /probably/ not a new user problem. When I launch the game, it says ""TS3W.exe is not a Windows 32-bit program."" This confused me because I moved everything where it should have been. I took a look and apparently, my TS3W.exe that I got from the download was 0 bits in size. Any suggestions / thoughts?"

,supachan,2012-11-25T18:36Z,awesome! it worked just fine! I installed the game on mac and this crack fix was perfect.
