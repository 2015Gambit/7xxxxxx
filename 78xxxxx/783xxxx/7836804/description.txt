The premier of BeethovenΓÇÖs Ninth Symphony in Vienna on May 7, 1824, was the most significant artistic event of the yearΓÇöand the work remains one of the most precedent-shattering and influential compositions in the history of music. Described in vibrant detail by eminent musicologist Harvey Sachs, this symbol of freedom and joy was so unorthodox that it amazed and confused listeners at its unveilingΓÇöyet it became a standard for subsequent generations of creative artists, and its composer came to embody the Romantic cult of genius. In this unconventional, provocative book, BeethovenΓÇÖs masterwork becomes a prism through which we may view the politics, aesthetics, and overall climate of the era. Part biography, part history, part memoir, The Ninth brilliantly explores the intricacies of BeethovenΓÇÖs last symphonyΓÇöhow it brought forth the power of the individual while celebrating the collective spirit of humanity.
