The Ed Show; November 16, 2012.

 David Petraeus answered to Congress and the negotiations began over the fiscal cliff.

A week after stepping down from the CIA, General Petraeus testified on Capitol Hill. Col. Lawrence Wilkerson (Gen. Colin Powell's former chief of staff at the State Department), separated fact from fiction. He also had some strong words for Senator John McCain.

Congressional leaders say they had a "constructive" meeting with the president today, but will it lead to progress on the fiscal cliff? Congressman Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) weighed in.

Also, one of the key sticking points in fiscal cliff discussions is whether the wealthiest Americans will have to pay a little more. That's why a group calling itself the Patriotic Millionaires went to Washington this week to say, "tax us, we can take it". Tara Dowdell (Democratic strategist) and  Nick Hanauer (Second Avenue Partners') discussed that.

Then, Scott Walker and John Kasich are some of the Tepublican governors refusing to implement Obamacare provisions in their states. John Nichols (The Nation's Washington Correspondent), explained why that's a good thing.

And the post office suffered record losses while trying to accomplish an impossible goal. Greg Bell (Postal Workers Union) joined Ed to discuss how the postal service can be saved.
