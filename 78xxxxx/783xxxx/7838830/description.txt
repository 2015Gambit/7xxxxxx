Ross Evana is next up on ALiVE Black and will be a name familiar to followers of our label, having already released two prior eps with us, each passing track marking out the man as a producer that is piquing serious interest. ΓÇÿHoney TrapΓÇÖ seeΓÇÖs Ross in typical big room form, cavernous beats and large synth patterns combine for maximum peak time effect. Ross teams up with Exacta and sultry songstress ΓÇÿKate ElsworthΓÇÖ next for a sleek mood setter on ΓÇÿCalled AffairΓÇÖ; the deeply atmospheric vibe of the track coupled perfectly with KateΓÇÖs sensual vocal delivery. Finally ΓÇÿSee No EvilΓÇÖ makes clever use of a sampled vocal refrain, as catchy as it is hypnotic giving the track a really distinct edge.
