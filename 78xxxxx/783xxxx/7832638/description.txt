After years of trying tracking down a copy of this rare made-for-TV movie online for a family member, I was able to locate a copy and decided it should be shared.

This was originally a Netflix rip, quality is not fantastic but still watchable.

-- Christmas on Division Street --

TV Movie - Originally Aired: December 15, 1991

Synopsis: Hume Cronyn steals what there is to steal of Christmas on Division Street. Cronyn plays a smooth-talking skid row derelict who befriends wealthy Philadelphia "mainline" kid Fred Savage. Both the old bum and the young preppie have lost faith in themselves and the world but are redeemed by the spirit of Christmas and the bonds of friendship. Made for TV, Christmas on Division Street is saved from being a heaping bowl of Yuletide mush by the ever-iconoclastic Cronyn. (Hal Erickson, Rovi - RT)
