Photoshop Brushes Pack 17 of 23 :
---------------------------------


{ NOTE PHOTOSHOP BRUSH FILES HAVE A .abr FILE EXTENSION - So if you see a  .abr 

file extension you can be sure that it is a Photoshop Brush File }


[This series of  23  Packs contains about  6000 Photoshop Brushes in total.

These uploads are a continuation of my previous uploads "Photoshop Brushes Pack 01 

of 32" ... etc., which I had discontinued after Pack 03 of 32.  The current 

uploads contain all the Brushes from the previous uploads "Photoshop Brushes Pack 

01 of 32"  to "Photoshop Brushes Pack 03 of 32" as well. I have added some new 

Brushes as well and made File Sizes smaller  so that the Brush Packs are now  23 

instead of 32 and contain about 1000 more Brushes.]


You can download the Photoshop Brushes User's Manuals  from :
  
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7096808/Photoshop_Brush_Tutorials_Video___Pdf

It contains manuals on how to Work with, Create, Use, Alter , Manipulate Photoshop 

Brushes.


Due to the vast amount of Photoshop Brushes it is quite possible that about 2 % of 

the Brushes may have been repeated. In some cases a set of Brushes may have been 

divided between two packs, so don't freak out if you find one half in one pack and 

wonder where the other is.



All the Brushes  are compatible with Photoshop 7 to Photoshop CS 6. and Win98 to 

Win7 .Some are not compatible because of change in Commands and rearranging of 

panels from version to version, but such Brushes are not more than 1% .



It is not possible to supply a list of Brushes included because the description 

page of TPB will not accept such a huge list and moreover the compilation would be 

a huge task. But, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed :).



In Win 7 Copy / Paste the Action in -  "C:Program Files - Adobe - Adobe Photoshop 

CS6 - Presets - Brushes"  Folder. A similar Folder is available in lower Windows 

OS.


Refer the manuals on how to work with Brushes from within Photoshop. If you are 

not familiar with Photoshop Brushes, I can guarantee that this will be a start of 

a very beautiful  relationship  with  Brushes. Most are not aware of the vast  

potential these Tools hold .



THE  UPLOADS ARE ESSENTIALLY FOR 32  BITS SYSTEMS AND WINDOWS OS ONLY. THEY MAY 

OR MAY NOT WORK ON 64 BITS OR OTHER OS.
