Commissioner Gordon is shot by an unknown assailant, and the Batman Family must investigate the attempted murder while their longtime friend in the police department is in a coma.

This arc is part of the New Gotham series, taking place right after the events of No Man's Land, when Gotham City had just been rebuilt.
