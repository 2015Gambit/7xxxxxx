Sara Crewe moves from Africa to London with her father, who is in the military. He goes off to war, so he sends her to a prestigious boarding school where she is under the strict, miserly, and compassionate-less direction of the Headmistress. She is bullied by her classmates, but manages to become best friends with an eccentric girl as well as one of the young servants. SaraΓÇÖs world is turned upside down when she is notified of the death of her papa (as well as the loss of his fortune). Newly orphaned, Sara is allowed to stay at the boarding school but not as a studentΓÇª as a servant. Although Sara has always had a tender heart towards others, she now learns to love no matter the circumstances. She shares the little food she receives with others and even reads the Bible to her friends. Meanwhile, one of her fatherΓÇÖs close friends is desperately searching for her with no luck. Later, he befriends a poor servant girl that lives next door, only to find out that it is Sara Crewe. He then adopts her and promises to take care of her.
