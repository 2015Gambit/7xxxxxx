,Iggy13,2012-11-18T11:24Z,"No, there must be a problem somewhere on the network. Also, you should add udp trackers manually because the client I am using still lacks that feature, I am working on it."
,Iggy13,2012-11-18T11:26Z,It seems that already there are at least 5 peers with 100% of the torrent. I am going to add manually some trackers and report it here.
,Iggy13,2012-11-18T11:49Z,"There, the udp trackers are working

So far the only one that's showing peers is the heet one.

Anyways I am using PXE and DHT so you'll eventually manage to get the files anyway."
,ZackSavior,2012-11-18T17:49Z,Thank you Iggy13 ! I just finished downloading it and everything looks great. I was able to complete the download when I woke up this morning.
,Iggy13,2012-11-22T16:45Z,I'm gonna split up the files in smaller torrents and make a package including some other user's edit to the files and if i find the by-chapter mp3s i used to have to listen on not-so-good mp3 players then ill put it togheter as well.
