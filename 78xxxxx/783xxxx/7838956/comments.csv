Looking at things this morning proves my theory. Offer the 16x9 version and most people will bypass it in favour of the 4x3 crop uploaded by ettv or eztv or MP4SUX simply because of their 'brand recognition'. I guess people don't want the 16x9 so i probably won't bother uploading the 720p either. Why they make the show in 16x9 and then crop it to 4x3 for broadcast i may never really understand since there is an HD version of TV Land."

Will you please upload that? :)"
