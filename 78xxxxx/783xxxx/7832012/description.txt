The future 2015, 15 years after the famed, "Second Impact". Shinji Ikari, a somewhat

lonesome boy, is standing around in the deserted streets of Tokyo-3. This openeing 


scene marks the beginning of a voilent, dramatic, humorous, and just plain, heart-

touching series. The movie itself is centered around one of those "secret" 

organizations. This particular organization is called NERV. Their mission is to 

defend the planet from unknown threats.
