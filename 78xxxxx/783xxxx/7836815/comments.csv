If it isn't
.avi
.mkv
.mpg

you may not want to DL it."
,.Leto.,2012-11-18T05:47Z,"@ SayGen102: unknown for you maybe. There's no problem with TS files, you can read them with vlc, mediaplayerclassic, kmplayer,...
This is perfectly legit."
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-18T05:54Z,"@SayGen102
You must be new here."
,Hoirc88,2012-11-18T06:08Z,Thanks bro for these and the ultimate fighter episodes.
,SayGen102,2012-11-18T06:09Z,"@SecTPB
Na, not new by any means.

While rare it is very possible for a pink(trusted) icon to get hacked and upload crap.

I've watched every UFC since 120ish and never had to DL a .ts for it"
,SayGen102,2012-11-18T06:11Z,You can't really harp on me considering the only other recent UFC upload is also a fake courtesy of Arnott 
,Lurgid_Wight,2012-11-18T06:23Z,SayGen102 could have used google... and apparently he's never heard of an mp4.
,-SNUKE-,2012-11-18T06:25Z,@SayGen102 you ain't from around these parts are ya?
,SayGen102,2012-11-18T06:37Z,"Forgot to add mp4 to the list of good contianers, but yes mp4 is generally safe. Point is, TS is an older rarer format that has no real purpose and should be questioned when seen.

Never said anything bad about anyone, just gave a general warning to the masses-- which is the point of these comments."
,scolios,2012-11-18T06:43Z,Thank you so much! and lol@SayGen102
,ZukanHasn,2012-11-18T06:52Z,When are you releasing the Main Card? Release an MP4 please...i have to watch it from my ps3
,saffronsghost,2012-11-18T06:59Z,"He said it kind of like a douche, but I've never downloaded a TS either.  I'm sure my Astone player can play whatever it is, though, and Sec has never let me down before with quality.

Thanks Sec  :)   Don't spose you can find the facebook prelims, anywhere?  I know you can't do the PPV, which sucks for us  :P"

""TS is an older rarer format that has no real purpose and should be questioned when seen.""

This is not true. Look up what a TS(Transport Stream) is. It's simply a container that holds TV broadcast data, and captures the TV broadcast exactly as it aired, or exactly how you set your cable/satellite connection to the broadcast.


@ZukanHasn
I don't do the main card unless someone pays for it. I just spend $13 on a month subscription of sports-related streams at http://www.Wrestle-Zone.net.pk like I just did now. If you want to give me $60 for the PPV, feel free. lol."
,saffronsghost,2012-11-18T09:06Z,"Fuck these seeders, btw.  So horrible."
,Lurgid_Wight,2012-11-18T10:29Z,"saffronsghost, get off your high-horse...

...dick"
,saffronsghost,2012-11-18T10:57Z,"Calm down faggot, if you're seeding no one is talking to you."
,DentTheReal2,2012-11-18T16:13Z,"thx, glad I have mma-torrents.com for the rest"
,mentallyours,2012-12-02T07:23Z,sup
