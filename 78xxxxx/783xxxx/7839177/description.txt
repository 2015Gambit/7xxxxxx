DESCRIPTION/REVIEW:

Grooverider isn't hailed as the "don of drum & bass" for nothing. It's an honorable title that he has earned and held since the genre's very foundation in the early 1990s. Mysteries of Funk, surprisingly Groove's first full-length, is a sample of jazzier and more tech-step-oriented strains of drum & bass. Taking slightly forced, Björk-esque vocal arrangements and beautiful guitar licks and arranging them around soft, café-style breakbeats, "Rainbow of Color" emphasizes the jazz-funk solution to Groove's great mystery. "On the Double" takes the fusion of sound even more literally and exercises a more soundtrackish approach with a film chase-scene sound. The mighty Grooverider later flees the café scene with a handful of strictly main-floor tracks like "Where's Jack the Ripper?" and "560." The former takes crunchy bass quacks and pounds against them with a metallic snare drum; the latter takes quirky sub-bass pulses that are quickly recycled into heavy reverb while a simple conga rhythm accents each beat. Groovy. --Daniel Shumate
