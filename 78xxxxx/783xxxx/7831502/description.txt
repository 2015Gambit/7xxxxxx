Desktop Poet for Windows v1.0.1 Retail | 19 Mb


Desktop Poet is so much fun! Just like those little magnetic tiles for the front of your ΓÇÿfridge that have been around since the 90's, Desktop Poet turns your desktop into a ΓÇ£virtual fridgeΓÇ¥ area so that you can be as creative ΓÇô and silly ΓÇô as you want!

Let your mind and imagination run wild!
Whether, poet, novelist, playwright, educator, student or a person with a little time on your hands, Desktop Poet puts hundreds of words right at your fingertips. Move them around to create your poems, prose or to brainstorm. The tiles become a visual embodiment of the English language, freeing you to let your mind travel through uncharted territory.

Finally, an awesome app for your kids.
This is no ΓÇ£shoot-em upΓÇ¥ game. Desktop Poet assists younger kids grasp simple word structure in a fun way. Other kids can showcase their creative flair. Whether in the classroom or at home, kids can play with words and in the process ΓÇô learn.

But, seriouslyΓÇª
You can increase the available vocabulary and decrease the number of tiles. A single tile can have multiple word variations. Highlight the word, click escape and, for example, picture becomes: pictures, picturing, pictured. Need more? Set backgrounds, colors and more, making Desktop Poet a creative wonder world.
