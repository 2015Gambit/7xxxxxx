The wireless industry continues to grow in leaps and bounds with more and more gadgets evolving to be wireless. Wireless access points, media centers, phones, and even security systems are commonplace in the average household. Unfortunately, the security that is implemented on this equipment is often lacking, opening the devices to severe security vulnerabilities. In practice, many companies and organizations still use and deploy vulnerable wireless gear, often in their default configurations. This is most often due to poor security awareness or a lack of understanding of the risks and ramifications.
