,nonapp,2012-11-18T06:33Z,"MrJumper:  Quite simply, they do exactly as i just did.  I saw an eztv branded torrent, and immediately thought it would be ok, as eztv is a quality group.  Only after I saw that it was a zip file did I know there was bullshit afoot."
,Strikali,2012-11-18T08:09Z,"ditto MrJumper, thnx nonapp, fuck you Anonymous. "
