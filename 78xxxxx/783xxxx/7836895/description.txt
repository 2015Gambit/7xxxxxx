Plot - 
Bearing the tagline ΓÇÿJourney of the SoulΓÇÖ, Gajaar tracks the life of a passionate and egoistic filmmaker Parth (Mandlekar) over a span of 18 days. These 18 days are no ordinary time span; they correlate to the grand pilgrimage ΓÇÿwariΓÇÖ to Lord VitthalΓÇÖs abode in Pandharpur, Maharashtra, undertaken by roughly 20 lakh devotees every year. These devotees, known as ΓÇÿwarkarisΓÇÖ, walk from Alandi to Pandharpur chanting prayers and praises to the deity.Atheist Parth is approached by anthropology student Eric (Sonnenblick), an American who wants to make a film on the wari. After much persuasion, Parth is convinced by live-in girlfriend Geetali (Yash) to provide technical expertise for the film, which they shoot on location. The film tracks the positive transformation of Parth from an egoistic, self-centred man to a Vitthal faithful against the backdrop of the 18 adhyayas.
