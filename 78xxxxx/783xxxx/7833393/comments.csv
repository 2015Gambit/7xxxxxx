[V],rr-ne,2012-11-18T04:30Z,"Has 'Lord of The Ring' and 'Man. Make. Fire.'

PAWN STARS EPISODES. S06x 05 and 06

It says on wikipedia the release was Nov.13

I cannot find those two eps anywhere on the web."
,CronicCase,2012-11-18T05:13Z,"yeah ""the wild within"" looks good too, cant find it to watch but some short clips. but as far as ManEater, hes got this episode coming up with Joe Rogan that i thought would be fun to watch."
[V],psspss,2012-11-18T07:10Z,"guys I have no DATA left resets in a few days then I have 120gb again but I cant share too much like old days cos isp BS

anyhow the wiki is wrong stick with myepisodes.com join it.. have it email you daily the tv schedule.. I use a RSS feed

my last episode I converted is
Pawn.Stars.S06E04.HDTV.xvid-][ Stick to Your Guns ][ 13-Nov-2012 ]


and yes wild within.. good series.. was on demon and kat but kat removes with dcmas
and demon is gone

but contact trailnerror at kat he might reshare his rips
I do a search for it"
[V],psspss,2012-11-18T07:16Z,"if you do a google

wild within torrent you can find some episodes
but maybe no seeders

again someone can reshare it if ask..
TNE maybe do it.. will be only xvids back then though"
,CronicCase,2012-11-19T03:32Z,Ty for your advice and help.
