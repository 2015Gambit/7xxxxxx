,Froglet,2012-11-18T15:04Z,I am now seeding. I just wanted to say that not only is it a very nice copy but it is also a brilliant series.
,mrKnightley,2012-11-18T18:02Z,"hey, thanks for these.  loved the first two series."
,carolmurray,2012-11-18T18:25Z,Snowhiter to the rescue with the hardcoded subtitles.  Thank you!
,peilass,2012-11-18T23:40Z,Great to see this back -- and many thanks - your uploads are always excellent.
,JusMe2,2012-11-19T13:44Z,"Wonderful to see your return, Snowhiter.

We've missed your clean uploads of good avi files with hardcoded subs.

Hope to see your uploads of the remainder of this series, and maybe Hatufim, Season 2 also?"
,johnBlake,2012-11-21T04:13Z,"Sno, Thanks a lot for these wonderful uploads.

Any chance you can get the Spanish period drama 'Grand Hotel' airing in Sky Arts 2? There are no proper subs for this show anywhere else :)"
,Fegan,2012-11-21T05:10Z,Very much appreciated. Thank you Snowhiter.
,cindy25,2012-11-23T06:54Z,i second the request for gran hotel
[V],Snowhiter,2012-11-24T18:50Z,"@johnBlake + cindy25, I'll see what I can do but period dramas ain't my thing. This is gonna cost me a fortune in dvd's...
They will not be uploaded until The Killing Series 3 has finished tho ;)"
,cindy25,2012-11-25T12:43Z,"i was able to find the first ep of Gran Hotel, with hardsubs, on a blog

if anyone wants the link just PM me in the forum
