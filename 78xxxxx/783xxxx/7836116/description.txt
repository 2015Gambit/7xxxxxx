Sun Zhijun (σ¡½σ┐ùσÉ¢) is a well-known present-day teacher of Cheng style baguazhang, living in Beijing, China. Born in 1933 in Cheng Village, Shen County, Hebei Province, Sun began his baguazhang training under Liu Ziyang (σèëσ¡ÉμÑè), disciple of Cheng Dianhua (τ¿ïμ«┐ΦÅ») (Cheng Tinghua's younger brother). Later, he also had the opportunity to study with Cheng Yousheng (τ¿ïμ£ëτöƒ) (Cheng Dianhua's son) and Cheng Youxin (τ¿ïμ£ëΣ┐í) (Cheng Tinghua's second son) in Beijing. Today, he has many disciples teaching his baguazhang around the world.

Besides traditional baguazhang, Sun has also taught baguazhang to modern wushu players for competition, training over 10 baguazhang national champions in the past 20 years.

Here is a very excellent Cheng Style solo set, clearly taught and easy to learn if you already know Ba Gua basics and if you learn the moves one move at a time without trying to rush too much. You can learn this set from the video. But it is an advanced set so be sure to first learn the basics found on the other DVDs.

I have all of Sun Zhi-Jun's DVDs but I am only uploading this advanced form because all of his basic exercises are already presented on the other Ba Gua videos by the other teachers.

Presented here is the Cheng Style 24 Palm 64 Moves with Sun Zhi-Jun
