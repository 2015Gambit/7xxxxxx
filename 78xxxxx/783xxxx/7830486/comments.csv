,remomama,2012-11-18T04:28Z,"Ok. Here's my opinion:
A 8
V 4 (the IMAX scenes have a bigger res so they've reduced the aspect ratios for those scenes, coz of this black bars run on top n bottom of the screen and u can see many blurred bars appearing throughout those scenes, keeps changing aspect ratios throughout the film and its a big pain to watch the copy)
M 8 (as always)
So thanks man, wish you had embedded this info before and saved our bandwidth, but I won't complain!! Just giving this info so that ppl who r going to dl will know the truth!"

If you saw the film in an IMAX cinema, the action sequences were all in 1:85:1 to make the most of the bigger projection. Even watching this version on a normal TV makes for a better viewing experience. 
Altogether A=10, V=8 - image was a little compromised during the low light scenes, but looked great for the daylight ones. Still, an amazing job for such a long movie with such a small filesize. Good stuff YIFY!!!"
