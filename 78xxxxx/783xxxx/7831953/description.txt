Visions of Israel
A stunning aerial tour of the ancient land
Make an aerial pilgrimage to Israel, the world's only Jewish state and Holy Land to three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Stunning high-definition footage showcases Israel in all its diverse glory, flying over sites where Jewish rebels gave their lives; where Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans built outposts of their empires; and where Jesus Christ lived and died. Witness the magnificence of the country's many holy sites, including the Western Wall, the Temple Mount, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, alongside exotic seaside resorts and the austere beauty of the Judean desert.
With informative narration by Israeli American violinist Itzhak Perlman and ethnic music, Visions of Israel presents the natural and historical wonders of this sacred landscape.
