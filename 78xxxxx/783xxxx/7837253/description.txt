New Rules & Closing Monologue Segments (Real Time with Bill Maher) [Eng;S01-S10 complete;TVrip]


These are the New Rules and closing monologue segments from all episodes, seasons 1 through 10, of 'Real Time with Bill Maher' in XviD.avi format, one file per episode---a distillation of the comedic aspect of the program with all the irreverent bite we've come to love from Ann Coulter's "favorite liberal traitor."


Extras include:
...'New Rules, Polite Musings from a Timid Observer' (2005 by Bill Maher) [unabridged audiobook]
...'The New New Rules, A Funny Look at How Everybody But Me Has Their Head Up Their Ass' (2012 by Bill Maher) [unabridged audiobook]
...Closing Monologue of 'Bill Maher's Religulous' (2008).avi
...MTV's Celebrity Deathmatch - Bill Maher vs. Conan O'Brien (04-25-2002) [claymation].avi
......as well as clips of three cross-over spots in which mockups of 'Real Time with Bill Maher' feature, with Bill Maher guest-appearing...
...Sarah on Real Time (The Sarah Silverman Program, 3x02, 02-11-2010).avi
...Boondocky Real Time (The Boondocks, 3x01, 05-02-2010).avi
...Brian Griffin on Real Time (Family Guy, 9x06, 11-21-2010).avi


Please note:
...A few episodes had only a New Rules segment with no closing monologue.
...In early 2008, as a result of the WGA writers' strike, the New Rules segment and the closing monologue were eliminated for five episodes.
...The first couple of seasons had lower-quality sources, but these segments are still quite watchable. I ran them through some filters to clean them up as much as was possible. The other seasons had standard-quality XviD.avi sources.
...I will upload the New Rules & closing monologue segments for additional seasons at the end of each season's broadcast schedule (provided they are capped).  ;) 


Please note, my bandwidth is limited. INITIAL SEEDING WILL AVERAGE BETWEEN 50 & 80 kB/s. Please be patient, and please help seed this rarity. Many thanks are owed to the original cappers/encoders/uploaders of the full episodes, without whom this torrent would not have been possible. Enjoy!  ;)
