Storyline
It's summertime, and the nature fairies, along with Tinker Bell, Clank, Bobble and Terrance, are on the mainland helping nature along. Always one to let curiosity get the better of her, Tink goes exploring a little to close to the humans. Tink's careless behavior enrages Vidia, who takes it upon herself to teach Tink a little lesson. But, when her harmelss little teaching moment goes terribly wrong, Tink ends up being captured.
As Vidia and the other fairies emark on a treacherous rescue mission, Tinker Bell gets to know the charming little English girl who inadvertantly caught herself a real fairy. Lizzy, who has always maintained a steadfast belief in fairies despite her father's scientific objections, is thrilled to finally meet the real thing. Lizzy and Tinker Bell become fast friends, so when Tink sees that Lizzy has a disheartening problem of her own, Tink risks everything to help her. With the future of fairykind haning in the balance, the fairies have only each other and the courage of one little girl to rely on. Each other, plus a little faith, trust and pixie dust.
