Quote:
The fifth game in the multi-million selling franchise showcasing IOΓÇÖs new Glacier 2 game engine, Hitman: Absolution follows Agent 47, a cold blooded assassin, who takes on his most dangerous contract to date. Betrayed by those he trusted and hunted by the police, he finds himself at the centre of a dark conspiracy and must embark on a personal journey through a corrupt and twisted world, in his search for the truth.



Here you can find my personal rip from retail DVDs. The languages are English, French and Spanish.
It contains NO CRACK, it's just a 100% backup.

KUDOS to original uploader.

The folder contains 2 ISO files into 2 RAR files.
You can mount, burn or extract them, and install the game using your steam account.
And, wait for anybody to crack it.
