Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth - Mecca and the Soul Brother [2xCD Deluxe Edition Remastered Box Set]



Sony Music and Traffic Entertainment Group proudly present Mecca And The Soul Brother, the critically acclaimed 1992 debut album from the Mount Vernon duo, Pete Rock & CL Smooth. The album is considered as one of the greatest Hip Hop albums of all time. Boasting tracks such as the first single, ΓÇ£They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)ΓÇ¥, a dedication to their deceased friend; ΓÇ£Trouble T-RoyΓÇ¥, which went on to become not only their signature hit, but also one of Hip HopΓÇÖs all-time great songs. The album is propelled forward by RockΓÇÖs quick, soulful interludes; usually bits of old R&B tunes layered with his signature trumpet and sax loops. SmoothΓÇÖs liquid freestyle delivery pieces together the perfect vocal match that, together, creates a sprawling, nearly 80-minute-long album on which not a single song or interlude is a throwaway or a superfluous piece. Named one of the essential recordings of the 90s by Rolling Stone, among numerous other accolades, Mecca and the Soul Brother stands up without ever really dating itself and is now available in a beautiful 2xCD box set edition.

The first disc features the original 16 album tracks, remastered from the original masters recordings. The second disc contains 15 bonus versions and exclusives. Both discs come housed in individual ΓÇÿpaste onΓÇÖ style sleeves with brightly-colored printed dust sleeves. A 20-page book features in-depth liner notes written by Brian Coleman with contributions from Dante Ross, Pete Rock and CL Smooth. All this plus a full sized poster to boot. This reissue of an early 90s classic
is a must have for any music collector or fan of good music.
