Also, you'll get slightly better quality if you crop it to the image instead of letterboxing it as you have here--some of the video bitrate is used up encoding those sharp lines. Also, 640x272 would be fine."
,Tiga1234,2012-11-17T04:06Z,"thanks for the movie, your the best"
[V],varuttee,2012-11-17T04:33Z,"@ michael This movie has two aspect ratios, so we didnt crop the scenes."
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-17T09:11Z,"****WARNING: This is WATERMARKED. Has shit like ""Encoded by VYTO"" in bright pink letters every 10-15min, then some website addr, then something else--repeated throughout the movie. Hey VYTO: you can go suck your mom's dick."
,michaelrwatson,2012-11-17T09:24Z,ANd W-T-F do you mean by two aspect ratios? You are a moron as well as a stupid shit.
[V],varuttee,2012-11-17T10:47Z,"@ michaelrwatson u kno no shit. U go fck ur mom, rather than crying here at TPB. U dumb fck dont even kno whats a watermark!! Yeah this release is encoded by VYTO, and its added to the subtitle at this time line 02:44:27,899 --> 02:44:47,900, and only once at the end, u motha fuka. Mayb jerking off to see it repeating. & about the aspect ratio, check this link, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/technical, & read the thing called aspect ratio, u'll find what i was talkin about u dumb fuk. And bcoz cry babies like u, who bookmark this page, to check back what reply u got, i don't matter to me."
[V],varuttee,2012-11-17T10:50Z,And there are no watermarks. This guy doesn't know the difference between a Watermark and Subtitle. 
[V],Vitamin_X,2012-11-17T11:40Z,"Are you out of your mind michaelrwatson? by two aspect ratio it means during some scenes the movie is played within letter boxes and in others the screens go full up. varuttee encoded it without touching the integrity of the movie. So, why dont you keep your comments to yourself and try not to mislead people. And there is no watermark anywhere to be found. I think you need to get your eyes checked."

@varuttee:

This mkv format file does not play on my 42"" TV.  This file only plays on my PC VLC player."

A: 5-6

Video quality is good, excellent compression as well. The flight scene in the beginning makes audio go nuts because of the turbines. Rest of the movie it's decent. All in all worth the DL."
[V],varuttee,2012-11-18T02:30Z,"@ Rakkumar: This version is not meant for 42"" TV, also it wont play on other devices, and will play on PC only as its a 10bit video, most devices dont support 10bit video."
,2dimples,2012-11-19T23:59Z,"The disagreements between michaelwatson, Varutee & ViaminX were very educational. Personally, I remove SRT lines that advertise by using a mediaplayerclassic option tool and I convert your Mkvs to VOBs onto DVDs. Your current aspect provides GOOD viewing on my 63 incher.  Keep up the GREAT work Varutee!!!"
