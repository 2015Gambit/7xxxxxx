This is the complete collection of Green Arrow (DC New 52), from issue 1 to 14, including Issue 0.  Downloaded from various sites / torrents, and combined into a single package.	

SPECIAL NOTE:  For Oliver's new fans looking for this after watching the Arrow TV series - DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE THE SAME.  The stories are very different, though both are great stories in their own right!
