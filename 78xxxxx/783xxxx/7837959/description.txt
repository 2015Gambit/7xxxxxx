   The globalization of capital markets since the 1980s has been accompanied by 
   a vigorous debate over the convergence of corporate governance standards 
    around the world towards the shareholder model. 

   But even before the financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009, the dominance 
   of the shareholder model was challenged with regard to persisting 
   divergences and national differences in corporate law, labor law and 
   industrial relations. The present collection explores this debate at an 
   important crossroads, echoing Karl Polanyi's famous observation in 1944 of 
   the disembeddedness of the market from society. Drawing on pertinent 
   insights from scholars, practitioners and regulators in corporate and labor 
   law, securities regulation as well as economic sociology and management
   theory, the contributions shed important light on the empirical effects on 
   the economy of the shift to shareholder primacy, in light of a comprehensive 
   reconsideration of the global context, policy goals and regulatory forms  
   which characterize market governance today.
