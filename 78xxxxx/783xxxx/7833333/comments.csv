,JonJonConFFFF,2012-11-17T05:51Z,It's too big
,Nimh,2012-11-17T05:57Z,"480p soon, please. Thanks Sec!"
,Hoirc88,2012-11-17T05:59Z,Pretty big but I'll give it a shot. Other uploads take forever on these episodes they usually aren't up till like 3 or 4 in the morning not sure why.. this was quick though so ty.
,Quink666,2012-11-17T06:00Z,Screw if its big TYMV for these fast uploads!!!
,Prabath1234,2012-11-17T06:16Z,"Thanks bro

,Quink666,2012-11-17T07:10Z,Yeah plz do as fast uploads of the prelims and main event of UFC 154 and i will be exstatic! Ty for your work mate!
,Nimh,2012-11-17T07:23Z,"Over the past 2 years? I think the quality of uploads of UFC main events has dropped. 

Sir Paul has come out but only works with VLC and apparently has problems with PS3's and Xbox. 
Rudos and XWT are compatible with most systems but the quality is poor. 
Looking back through the years, the quality is no better if not worse, than downloads from UFC 50 age.

Rudos & XWT need to get better quality and/ or Sir Paul needs make his files more compatible.  "
,Hoirc88,2012-11-17T07:45Z,"@Nimh, I have never had a problem watching Sir Paul's ufc events on my 360, but I will agree that the quality of them is not quite what it used to be.

As for this torrent I've been downloading for almost 2 hours and only at 34% :("
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-17T07:46Z,"If you want to watch UFC 154 GSP vs. Condit live with an HD 720p stream, you can go to http://www.wrestle-zone.net.pk and pay either $5 or $10. I work there and help release TV broadcasts and can recommend it greatly to everyone. I do not do the PPV unless someone pays for me, I only do regular TV broadcasts."
,dean2804,2012-11-17T08:24Z,"Are you kidding? Between 5 and 10 dollars, right? You're supposed to be a pirate, so you know full well we can get it for free streaming on certain sites. Yet, you're charging? I'm shocked."
,Hoirc88,2012-11-17T08:34Z,My god... please seed so I can watch this before passing out asleep lol.
,Nimh,2012-11-17T08:51Z,"Man, the octagon surface is rough!!!  

I'm not sure if it's changed but look at Colton's knees. 

On one of the fighters blogs and they mentioned the other week how one of the fighters knees and feet were totally raw.  Thick layers of the dermis, like a 2nd degree burn."

You can't find HD streams live anywhere else, and THEY charge. They release the stuff for free afterwards. They provide TV as well for free, and also have futbol, pro wrestling, cricket, boxing, other mma events. they offer video on demand too so you can watch anything you want right from your browser at any time + direct downloads of the files. They have several streamers, and all these PPVs are quite expensive at about $60 a pop. I'd pay $5 to watch UFC in HD any time instead of a gargled up free low quality stream. Server costs are VERY expensive too with all the content they have. For $13 bucks they offer you VIP access for one month, meaning $13 for any and all sporting PPV and TV live for a month, plus free access to all previous streams(UFC goes back as early as around the 50s). $13 > $220. that's how much it saves me. it's a good place and i recommend it. I just capture and offer TV releases for them to use, which are free. I'm always in the chatroom on the main page chatting with everyone during a live event if anyone ever wants to get in and talk some UFC tomorrow and take a leap. http://www.Wrestle-Zone.net.pk"
