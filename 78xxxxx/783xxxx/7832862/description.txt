The grayscale and color pages (covers, plates and some figures) are encoded either with didjvu, or with c44 if the result with didjvu is really bad. Encoding with didjvu allows a huge gain of size but sometimes at the cost of quality, so the covers, plates and the two pages with figures encoded using didjvu are also included in JPEG format alongside the book for those who would like to have them in better quality.

=== About the book

Title: Persuasions of the WitchΓÇÖs Craft. Ritual Magic in Contemporary England
Author: T.M. Luhrmann
Year: 1991
Publisher: Harvard University Press
ISBN: 0-674-66324-1

To find out why reasonable people are drawn to the seemingly bizarre practices of magic and witchcraft, Tanya Luhrmann immersed herself in the secret lives of Londoners who call themselves magicians. She came to know them as friends and equals and was initiated into various covens and magical groups. She explains the process through which once-skeptical individualsΓÇöeducated, middle-class people, frequently of high intelligenceΓÇöbecome committed to the ideas behind witchcraft and find magical ritual so compellingly persuasive. This intriguing book draws some disturbing conclusions about the ambivalence of belief within modern urban society.
