[V],virana,2012-11-20T08:39Z,There are Christmas Gregorian chants. A greeting and listen please
,Coltbear50,2012-11-21T11:06Z,"Thanks for all of your SUPERB labors of love, Virana!  Just ignore the stupid comments... Gregorian is, I believe a project of Frank Peterson, who worked with Enigma before, and has been Sarah Brightman's beau for years now (after Andrew Lloyd Webber), and he still arranges and produces her CDs.

Is there any chance you could redo this in a higher kbps, say maybe, 256 or 320?  If not, no problem - thanks either way, and all you do is much appreciated!"
,jameskrueger2nd,2012-11-24T01:53Z,"Frank Peterson's Gregorian is into satanic songs like ""Ave Satani"" and others. Christmas songs from satanic dudes don't make sense.
