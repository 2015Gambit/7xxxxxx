,thebbc,2012-11-24T05:56Z,"I've been using these for the past few updates, and have been very pleased with them. With this one, most of the updates I use are being deleted by Anti-Virus. Anyone know how to get around these? Norton 360, can't just delete the program off my computer. Love these downloads, just some technical difficulties with this cycle."
