From the ashes of extreme metal band Cephalectomy (Canada), comes a new project entitled "Barra Xul". Much is the same vein as it's predecessor, Barra Xul conjures  the sounds of demons in their self branded style of Melodic HorrorGrind. "In Darkness We Wait" is the debut release from this band, containing 7 tracks with a runtime of 35 minutes.
