Batman:  Odyssey was originally to be a thirteen-issue limited series.  It was later decided to break it up into two volumes.  Neal Adams wrote and illustrated this electrifying story arc.

In Batman:  Odyssey Volume 1, The Dark Knight faces a series of seemingly unrelated challenges as villains and allies old and new push him to his limits like never before. After Batman discovers a dark and mysterious matrix being superimposed over his life, what sort of life-changing voyage must he embark on to escape from this powerful and insidious force?

In Batman:  Odyssey Volume 2, Batman must kill or be killed. The threat is real and cannot be stopped by man or hero. To combat it, Batman must bring time itself to a standstill so that he can embark on an odyssey of self-discovery to a place unknown to mankind, where he can find himself. But is this a place where only failure awaits?

Batman:  Odyssey may not make a lot of sense, but itΓÇÖs about as compelling and engaging a superhero comic as youΓÇÖre going to find these days. ItΓÇÖs crazy and nonsensical, shifting from one scene to the next, characters spouting out random bits of gibberish and there not being much to let you know what, if any of it, matters. Characters drift in and out, returning issues later for reasons not always explained. So much of whatΓÇÖs going on seems to be happening inside Bruce WayneΓÇÖs head and he doesnΓÇÖt always feel like sharing. Still, thereΓÇÖs something appealing about that weird craziness, of a superhero comic going full tilt, not slowing down, and not apologizing.
