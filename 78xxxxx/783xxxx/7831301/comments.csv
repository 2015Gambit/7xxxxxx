,VDBP,2012-11-17T12:33Z,"@vivow
This is 100% virus free what you got was a false positive not a real virus make sure to disable your AV before you activate"
,vivow,2012-11-17T14:48Z,"@ VDBP - that's what i am thinking, false positive. so i should disable my av when downloading it."
,VDBP,2012-11-17T15:22Z,"@vivow
And for the installation"
,VDBP,2012-11-17T22:46Z,"@blablablathepirate

a private virtualization network and a syupid toolbar with another crap,all three programs at once but windows 8 will kick the fuck out of it,hehehehe"
,anni1994,2012-11-19T13:56Z,thanks but the activator isn't working for me
,VDBP,2012-11-19T14:41Z,"@zapinguete
There is no VPN installed there is no toolbars and it works perfectly why does there always have to be the dumb fuck that cant appreciate something that works well and then spams a load of crap on everyone's torrents I seriously cant handle you people anymore go find your stuff else where"
,VDBP,2012-11-19T14:44Z,"@anni1994

,petrounus,2012-11-21T17:49Z,Installing Avast anti-virus causes black screen after logging in. Had to uninstall the ani-virus to make things working again. Is there any to keep installing avast as well as having no problem with it? PLEASE SOMEONE HELP!
,PhatData,2012-11-24T18:47Z,"This is great ! 
Where did you get the Windows 8 OS Inst selector from? "
,tonycap44,2012-11-30T12:00Z,"If you try to install the media center with the free key, it says ""this product must be activated first"". It won't let you install the media center. When you view activation details, you'll see it says ""Why am I seeing this error"" even though its activated.  But it is working so far, hope it stays activated."
