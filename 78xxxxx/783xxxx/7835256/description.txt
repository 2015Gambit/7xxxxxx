Hallmark-Oliver's Ghost [2012]

Air Date: 10 Feb 2012


Summary: Eleven-year-old Oliver (Nicholas Stargel) has a unique ability to see "full-bodied apparitions," otherwise known as ghosts. When his family moves from the bustling city to an older home in the suburbs, only Oliver is able to see the spirit of Clive Rutledge (Martin Mull), the previous owner.  Clive causes every manner of destruction to force Oliver and his family to leave.  But perhaps Oliver's special talent, along with the help of a kind neighbor (Rhea Perlman), will show Clive how to release his earthly regrets so he can leave the house and the family in peace.
