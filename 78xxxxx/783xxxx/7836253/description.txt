"National Anthem" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, taken from her second studio album Born to Die. It was released as a single on July 6, 2012, through Interscope Records. The song serves as the album's fifth single. "National Anthem" is a trip hop song that ties together elements of alternative hip hop, indie pop, and baroque pop. The music video for the song premiered on June 27, 2012. It is directed by Anthony Mandler. It depicts Del Rey as Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy and A$AP Rocky as John F. Kennedy.[1] It centers around the theme of the Assassination of John F. Kennedy. Critical commentary accompanied the song and video. Positive reviews noted the song's critical evaluation of lavish lifestyles, saying it fit together with the lyrical structure of the entire album.
As with other tracks on Born to Die, "National Anthem" follows suit, produced in the alternative hip hop, trip hop, indie pop, and baroque pop genres. In the chorus, Del Rey half-sings, half-raps the line, "Tell me IΓÇÖm your national anthem/ Red! White! Blue!"[2] At the close of the recording is a multi-layered narrative treatment.[2] The introduction features a sample of The Star-Spangled Banner as performed by Marilyn Monroe.
