A male recollects the story of two impoverished brothers, Ramu and Deva. While Ramu studies in the Government College, he glues Bollywood movie posters as well as trims the grass with a manual lawnmower at the prestigious St. Joseph's College, where Football Coach, Thomson, quits due to differences with the Principal. Ramu longs to play football, but must work to make at least Rs.100 daily to ensure their survival, while Deva attends a local school. Deva's wish that they own a bicycle is fulfilled after Ramu finds an abandoned bike, and with the help of his garage-owner friend, Yadav, makes it roadworthy. While working in the garden of a wealthy family, he falls in love with the daughter, Shrishti, and on being discovered, gets fired, and the bike gets stolen. The brothers dramatically locate the bike with Ali Mirza, complain to his father, and take possession of the bike.
