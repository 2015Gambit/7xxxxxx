,3Dazz,2012-11-18T09:41Z,"Finally a crack that at least starts the game for me, I've had it for days and tried every combination and crack thats come out. 
Glad I hung onto the files now and did'nt d/l every new version that's come out over the last few days.
Thank you NepsterJay."

,t-edson,2012-11-18T19:51Z,can you tell me how to do step 6?
,t-edson,2012-11-18T20:07Z,can anyone help me with step 6?
,madgamerz,2012-11-18T20:22Z,"Confirmed this is working without the need for changing dates or any of the other bullshit.

Nice job NapsterJay."
,omnimodis,2012-11-18T20:25Z,"Impressive...this actually works.  I've tried all the tips from all the other ""solutions"".  Date change, time change, time zone change, blocking this, blocking that, installing steam, v1 cracks, v2 cracks, repacks, 3DM, Skdirow - you name it.  Always the same - black screen, manhandled exception. But this one (and following your steps) actually works.  I've started the game.  I don't know if it will work all the way through, but at least the game can be started now.  Thanks."
,omnimodis,2012-11-18T20:26Z,"""manhandled exception"" haha sorry - unhandled exception!"
,scottjwkelly,2012-11-18T23:16Z,"STEP 6
when u install your firewall should ask for permission say NO, if you have given permission by mistake click start type firewall click firewall, choose advanced options, go thru list find blackops2 remove. done"
,aremic,2012-11-19T00:14Z,this is ridiculously set up. its split into 3 separate rar's each containing approx the same files and folders in each? how is anyone supposed to know which one to use? and if you merge them which merges first?
,DemiAngelX,2012-11-19T03:31Z,None of the cracks I've tried have worked so far....this is getting so fucking irritating....
,XprojectX2,2012-11-19T05:55Z,"Thank you , Works great Win 7 X64"
,Ex0duS_5150,2012-11-19T09:03Z,"Ive had to juggle dates around to get mine to work every day.. This worked perfect with out a reinstall.. I now run the correct date and time zone :)

,reryn,2012-11-19T15:29Z,"Doesn't work. 

What is going on with the crack for this game. No one has a working crack, some of the cracks work for a few people but for most of us they don't work.

Also, almost no one is interested in modding their steam setup to crack a game."
,omnimodis,2012-11-19T18:41Z,"@aremic - 7zip instructions: Right click on file 1 -> 7-Zip -> select ""Extract to....""  This will merge the files into the one folder you want.  Learn before you bitch or buy the game if you can't even research such simple things.

@ all who can't play - I had the exact same issues you're all probably experiencing.  I don't know if it's specifically this repack that fixes the issues, or the procedures he provides, but it works.  Please follow his steps.

,Ex0duS_5150,2012-11-19T20:50Z,"Ive been DLing Games from the net before there were torrents, something called newsgroups binaries.. We would have to compile the application with sometimes 100s of part files and then from that compilation install game and crack it.. I have to say besides the whole GTA 4 foul up this has to be the worst game release by a scene ive ever seen since GTA 4 foul up.. Ive NEVER had a game i couldent get to work that has been released by scene..  

This crack fix by napsterjay works 100%.. People if it dose not work for you then you did something wrong in the installation or the adding of files to your game folder.. "
,lustrangiu1,2012-11-19T21:00Z,"it,s best crack at this time !!!!GREAT,GREAT WORK !!!(BUT...zombies and multiplayer don,t work}
THANKS FOR MY CHILD,YOU,RE A GOD MAN NEPSTER JAY !!!!"
,AaronxxArson,2012-11-20T02:27Z,"Finally, a working crack. No time zone changes or anything. Thanks alot uploader."
,john6425,2012-11-20T02:31Z,"Only thing that worked for me thanks so much! 
Maybe my problem was that steam was not installed
"
,sirbow2,2012-11-20T23:53Z,"UPDATE WINDOWS (control panel, windows update, check now) and you will not have the exception/ crash issue on start up. cmon people, dont apply cracks aimlessly. but this does seem to fix it for some, so that good."
,john6425,2012-11-21T01:13Z,"how can you make Zombie mode work, there's no single player? You can only play zombie mode ""Online""???"
,r46u50r1n,2012-11-21T19:36Z,Well i can start the game again ... thx for this :D
,yohanz5,2012-11-26T20:45Z,WOW it works! tnx a lot bro you really saved my day
