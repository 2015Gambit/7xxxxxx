,Glassed,2012-11-17T15:02Z,This size is ridiculous even for a 1080p quality movie.
,wikanx,2012-11-17T15:13Z,Glassed> No it's not. Look at the bitrate...
,bordo84,2012-11-17T15:32Z,thatÂ´s because it has almost 3 hours and itÂ´s a REMUX...go for some rip
,bordo84,2012-11-17T15:33Z,is it really CBR??? or VBR
,phase700b,2012-11-17T15:51Z,It's good to see this file. Won't be long before someone uses it to make a nice VBR 1080p at a sub 10gb size.
,bordo84,2012-11-17T16:07Z,10gb size is already here a long time
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-11-17T16:30Z,It's an exact 1:1 copy of the movie on the retail BD50 disk... the DTS HD audio track alone is around 2.5/3 GB so no the size isn't ridiculous for what you get. Thank you uploader!
,phase700b,2012-11-17T16:52Z,"@bordo84, Yeah there are a few 1080p less than 10gb available, but the 2 or 3gb sizes with lower quality audio and that 9gb xvid are not something I like. VBR h.264 @about 9gb would be nice. Those always show up eventually. "
,HerrNiIsson,2012-11-17T17:01Z,"This is not ridiculous, this is standard! Thank you uploader!"

,HAZE612,2012-11-19T05:44Z,So how long will this take to download on dial-up?  or should I just use my AT&T ipad?
,HAZE612,2012-11-19T06:18Z,Downloading from 2 of 254 peers???
,viewer55,2012-11-19T07:05Z,"hi guys ,I wanted to know is this the same file as the BluRay File? Are their any differences? "
,upCdayC,2012-11-19T17:17Z,Does this have special features?
