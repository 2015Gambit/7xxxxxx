It does not show up until after the patch has been done for the two sytems on wich I tryed it (one win8 desktop, one win7 laptop with intel sandybridge mp4 tech).
The desktop install runs fine but the laptop cannot stop video recording and only taskman can stop things, it never realy starts, doesn't show time recorded, snapshots work but both cams I try with every possible setting set of an endless unstoppable recording.
it seems to me this installer is bugged. "

Thanks Ching Liu, great upload, man!"
