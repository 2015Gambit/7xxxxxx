Bobby Sox (1996)- 4 AVN Awards

Welcome to Anytown. Where nothing happens. And everything happens. Jeremy Dayton's around to promote his latest monster epic at the last picture show. Sure he was once a major star, but these days he's a major loser, staging wild pranks to sell stripped down pictures to small town audiences. He'll even fake a kidnapping to sell a show. But when he grabs Nikki Tyler, he gets a lot more than he ever bargained for--that's for sure. Paul Thomas presents Bobby Sox, a film that AVN called "stunning, imaginative, arresting... a sexual joyride of eccentricity and wit. This must be Vivid's Crown Jewel." Then they said what they haven't said in years. "10." If you only see one film this year, see the one that matters. Bobby Sox. A monster film. About a monster film.
