Blue Jeans (Lana Del Rey song)
"Blue Jeans" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, taken from her second studio album Born to Die (2012). Serving as the third single on April 8, 2012 through Interscope Records, it also appeared on the EP, Lana Del Rey (2011), the re-release of her second album, Born to Die - The Paradise Edition (2012), and the second disc of the compilation album, Now That's What I Call Chill!.[2] Produced by Emile Haynie, the song was written by Del Rey, Haynie, and Dan Heath. As a downtempo pop ballad with alternative hip hop influences, it was featured in the television series Ringer, along with "Video Games", propelling Del Rey into the mainstream. A controversial performance of the song on SNL placed Del Rey under scrutiny and polarized opinion. Charting across Europe and Asia, "Blue Jeans" reached the top ten in Belgium, Poland, and Israel. Two music videos were created for the song. The first was self-produced. The second was shot and directed by Yoann Lemoine, featuring film noir elements and a crocodile. In the video, Del Rey's fictional boyfriend is played by Bradley Soileau, husband of pop singer, Porcelain Black.
