,Pothead-Stealth,2012-11-17T20:25Z,"then another fake file, plz remove this shit"
[T],Spikkie,2012-11-19T11:57Z,"@ strontium90 & Pothead-Stealth:
 webchella is a VIP uploader,
I don't think he'll post it if it's fake !"
[T],Spikkie,2012-11-19T11:58Z,and it's not a rar-file
[T],Spikkie,2012-11-19T20:40Z,"V6.5/A6
But one of the best copies till now."
,strontium90,2012-11-22T05:33Z,"I took the time to post this because I downloaded it, and its a rar file. Not a movie. Unrar it and it is another rar file, this time with a text file with instructions that asks you to go to a website to register to get the password. This is a joke, I don't care what you think of the spammer that posted it. It was uploaded from morons that put screener in the name order to try and waste people's time. Avoid or you will be fooled too."

Again, as Spikkie said, this is an .avi file, NOT a password-protected .rar file.
I have never downloaded a file from Webchella that turned out to be fake! And I really don't get it why you guys are discussing this in English since this film is dubbed in Spanish!!!"
