Legion of Saints is an alternative rock band that was formed late 2010 by high school friends Bryce Atkinson, Sebastian Bax, and Floro Bely Jr. We all starting jamming in Bryce's basement and had an instant connection due to our love music. The different style of playing and music preference led to a nice mesh of original material that the band worked on for almost 2 years before meeting bass play
er Shawn Bowser in late 2012. By then, the band had written most of their original material, and with the help of a bassist, they were able to complete the sound that they had been looking for.

On November 12, 2012, the band finally finished recording/mixing/mastering 7 songs (5 of which are featured on their self titled debut demo/EP) along with the amazing sound engineer Dean Hadji in his basement studio. With the demo in hand, the band now looks to hit the streets of their native city Ottawa, to play gigs and share their love of music with the world.

We hope to see you guys out there!
