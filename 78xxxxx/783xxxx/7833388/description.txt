Logan Keller (the main character), accompanied by his teammates Gabriel and Kan, are sent on a mission to arrest a terrorist leader in an undisclosed Mexican border town. As the team reaches their initial landing zone (LZ), Logan ropes down as the helicopter barely dodges a surprise attack by a rocket. Left on his own in the war zone, Logan must reach the Spanish church and regroup before the terrorist ringleader, Irena Moralez, completes whatever messed up plan she has in mind. It probably involves blowing stuff up.

Turns out Irena's a total oops and she drops the roof on the three R6, as Gabe and Kan are taken away (and presumably shot) as Logan is conveniently left for dead.

But Logan gives no oopss.

Logan proceeds to rise from his dusty grave and hunts down Irena and her followers through Vegas with his new, completely incompetent teammates Michael and Jung, who would sooner take a bullet to the head than follow orders effectively. To top that, Irena has a bomb that turns people inside out or some gross oops that makes a hell of an amount of blood.

Let's go stop them.
