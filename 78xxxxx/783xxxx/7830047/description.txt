This book reveals a step-by-step methodology individuals and organizations can use to develop, create, and nurture the kinds of new products and services that capture the publicÆs imagination. Loaded with examplesùand packed with straightforward explanations of the processes that can lead to breakout hitsùthis book shows readers how to create an idea methodology, encourage free-thinking, keep good ideas, and bring revolutionary, revenue-generating new concepts to market.
