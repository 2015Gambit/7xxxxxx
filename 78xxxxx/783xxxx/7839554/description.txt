   Plasmons as Sensors covers the fundamental developments of plasmonic      
   nanosenor design over the last few years. In his acclaimed thesis, Jan    
   Becker addresses the relevant theoretical concepts and then applies       
   these to discuss the properties and trends in nanoparticles of various    
   shapes and sizes. The first discovery Jan makes in his PhD research is    
   that there is an optimal shape for plasmonic nanoparticles used for       
   sensing purposes. In further chapters he goes on to describe novel        
   experimental methods to use plasmonic nanoparticles for molecular         
   sensing. The approach he develops in parallel sensing is one which        
   revolutionizes the field and allows investigation of a variety of         
   topics from nanoparticle growth to membrane protein attachment. Many of   
   the experiments described in this thesis have led to highly visible       
   publications in international journals.

  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :
  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :
  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:
