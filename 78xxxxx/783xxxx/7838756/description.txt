The MisterMusic Show - episode 228  [2 hours  192 kbps stereo]

It's The MisterMusic Show, featuring indie and alternative hits from today, and classic hits from the past.

We step back 13 years to 1999 in the 'Oldie of the Week' segment, and feature a big international rock hit that scored the number 1 spot in November that year in both USA and Canada, and was the band's highest charting single on the mainstream hot 100 chart.
