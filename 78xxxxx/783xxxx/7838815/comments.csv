I believe Itunes 1080p movies use DD 5.1
Hope that helps :)"

Most of dabadguy69 movies have not been surround sound. Disappointing. I'm hoping this movie is.  It would be a shame if it isn't"
,temp1992,2012-11-20T06:03Z,Can anyone please confirm if there's surround sound please?

Can you please confirm if this is surround sound?  Of all movies to start encoding with surround sound - this movie would be it.  Thanks so much for your quality uploads!"
,temp1992,2012-11-20T16:23Z,unfortunately I can confirm that this is NOT surround sound.  :(
