,Joker_JB,2012-11-18T16:57Z,"Don't listen to these idiots above, I just watched the whole thing and there're no passwords, surveys or problems whatsoever."

,HKCannibal,2012-11-18T20:43Z,"You're doing it wrong, I downloaded the file normally in MKV, not being compressed, and thus requiring a password, it is wrong to judge the release so when comentendo who is wrong, you are."
,Saderakh,2012-11-18T20:47Z,"c'mon seeders... I know you can hit the ratio fairly quickly with these types of files, but for MMA fights, I seed all day Sunday regardless, and usually all the way until Tuesday, to help the stragglers. Thanx. This train's movin' at about 40Kb/s at the moment. Cheers~"
,.Leto.,2012-11-18T20:56Z,"there's NO password of course, this is perfectly legit. it's just a jerk who got banned for posting a password protected rar and who's posting fake comments with multiple aliases. ignore him. "
,SheldorTheConqueror,2012-11-18T21:36Z,"The comments that say this is an .rar with a password should be banned.

This is an MKV and a txt file, no rar in the torrent."
,fullec,2012-11-18T21:37Z,"Click on the files: 2 

You will see its only a .txt file and .mkv 

No RAR. That's just Dana White's minions trying to discourage you "
,canabinol,2012-11-18T21:51Z,"this is real. I watch the first 8 seconds on this, so thats how I know. But the download is moving slow for me. thanks for the upload sir paul"
,canabinol,2012-11-18T21:55Z,"This is real! I watched the first 8 seconds so thats how I know. Plus its a .mkv file not rar. Don't know why people are saying its fake! The only thing is the download is moving slow for me. I see more and more seeders as the hour went by, so hopefully it will pick up."
,rsdmb,2012-11-18T22:12Z,"just checked at 30% download ,open with vlc and works just fine no password. Check your file to see if it works mine ok"
,Instynction,2012-11-18T23:49Z,"These retards trying to flame this guy, there is no password on this. "
,canabinol,2012-11-19T00:11Z,how come its going really slow?its going at 30 kb/s.
,vikram1,2012-11-19T00:36Z,Scam. don't bother
,rpoofus,2012-11-19T02:39Z,"Same password protected .rar with the same scam designed to lead you a side and download some .exe file... that does god-knows-what.

Don't listen to the uploader's sock-puppets.  It's B.S."
,rpoofus,2012-11-19T02:48Z,"Nothing wrong with SirPaul rips.... that's just the normally decent provider of the rips who this dickwad ""scene4all"" is using to label his FAKE shit."
,devildron,2012-11-19T04:34Z,"Since everyone is saying different things, I downloaded the torrent to see if it's good.

My conclusion:
Torrent is good!
Its not a RAR file but an MKV that plays directly with VLC.
Decent Quality :)
Great! Thanks to Sir.Paul!"
,AssGirl,2012-11-19T08:45Z,"Yeah, there was one uploaded before that had same name (almost same) but was a RAR.  People are commenting on wrong one.  THIS ONE IS NOT A RAR!!!  check the files before/when downloading.  Also, make sure you are commenting on the right upload before yall talk shit."
,enonumus,2012-11-19T12:27Z,"A10/V9.  Very good quality, and WOW, what a great night of fights!!  UFC 154 definitely lived up to the hype :)."
,enonumus,2012-11-19T12:29Z,"A10/V9.  Very good quality, NOT fake.  WOW, what a great night of fights!!  UFC 154 definitely lived up to the hype :).  Would love to say more, but all I can say is this is a MUST see."
,darthvaider26,2012-11-23T06:42Z,thanks brother 
,chaiyont2,2012-11-30T06:38Z,"Great torrent - even shows the end of the fights for a change, Sir Paul. :-)
