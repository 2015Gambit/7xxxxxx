,zirozarko,2012-11-18T09:07Z,You both make my day :)  lol
,medeni73,2012-11-18T12:40Z,"doesnt work on win7 64bit
on start it shows black registration screen and then it crashes..."
[T],Ching_Liu,2012-11-18T16:55Z,@medeni73 - You should not register so please skip this step. Application was tested for one year later - it worked.
,davidbest,2012-11-18T17:14Z,"thanks for sharing it man, it's the 64bit version, works great"
,rkbb,2012-11-18T19:39Z,"work great on win8,64"
,Utanium,2012-11-19T01:32Z,"Yes, just close registration window on first start, and you don't see it again.
Worked fine on 7 and 8, but didn't recognize my video files on server 2008.
I don't have this issue with premiere pro, or vegas."
,RebelRick,2012-11-19T05:20Z,"WORKS 100%, Thanks man. Running Windows 7 Home Premium x64. Just like Utanium said, at first a black registration window opens and just sits there so just close that and you're ready to go."
,resirai,2012-11-19T11:58Z,"Hi, Thanks for the upload Ching Liu :D
Works perfectly on my win7 64bit, but I get 
""Error â&#x20AC;&#x201C; 1663 this installation package is not supported by this processor type"" when trying to install on the 32bit system.
(if ya'll are wondering why I would install it on the 32bit system, it's because that is the hubby's pc)
Any ideas?  Thanks in advance :)"
,davidbest,2012-11-20T08:34Z,"@resirai - this is the Native-64bit version (which makes it MUCH faster than the 32bit version), there's no way you can install it on a 32bit machine, sorry"
,olujahr,2012-11-20T19:08Z,"working 100%,just close black activation screen!"
,100bugs,2012-11-20T19:19Z,"Great !
I got your PowerDirector 11 ultra and your AudioDirector 3 ultra and i will install them this evening (vista 64 bits).

All i am missing now is the ColorDirector ultra and the PhotoDirector 4 ultra...
Hope you will upload them soon."
,GreyLlama,2012-11-21T03:12Z,newinmac is an idiot. Go back to grade 1 and learn English.
,100bugs,2012-11-22T20:16Z,"I have a problem with your PD11 ultra (I use vista 64 sp2).

The installation went OK and i have an occasional stability problem that disappear when i reboot.

The big problem i have is that it will not accept most films (downloaded from the web) that i want to import. The only files it will accept are thoses created by the software and those that are not compressed.

I DID NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM WITH PowerDirector 7 and i don't have it with your AudioDirector 3.

Your SONY VEGAS PRO 12 is showing the same problem and, again, my Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum was accepting most files.

So, I strongly suspect it is a codec problem but I don't know mutch about it.
Any hints of what the problem could be other than that ?


I'm surprised those sophisticated 64 bits softwares can not ""compromise"" with 32 bits codecs (if this is realy the problem).

I'm reluctant replacing 32 bits codecs with 64 bits ones because it will cause failure of my other 32 bits softwares.

Is it possible to have both 32 bits and 64 bits versions of a codec installed together ?"
,100bugs,2012-11-23T05:19Z,"OK, I fixed my problem.

Both PD 11 ultra and Vegas Pro 12 need a 64 bits codec so i installed FDDShow 1.2.4422 (64 bits) from there: 

--> http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/download.php

However, since this PD 11 ultra is from a trial version, it still doesn't accept the h264 files and it also doesn't include the wave editor software... as told there:

-->  http://www.cyberlink.com/downloads/trials/powerdirector-ultimate-suite/download_en_US.html?affid=2581_1022_290_12411_0_ENU_powerdirector-ultimate-suite&utm_source=CLTR_PopularDownload&utm_medium=CLTR_PopularDownload_12411_powerdirector-ultimate-suite&utm_campaign=CL_Trial

I suspect that this other torrent is not from a trial because the file is mutch bigger.
If i am wright then it should accept the h264 files and should include the wave editor software:

--> http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7843077/CyberLink_PowerDirector_11_Ultra_11.0.0.2215

Finally, both 32 bits and 64 bits versions of FDDShow can be installed together without problems so I did it because many of my softwares still needs the 32 bits version."
,100bugs,2012-11-23T12:38Z,"I tested the other PD11 torrent mentioned in my previous comment and... 

1-IT ACCEPTS THE h264 FILES so I kept it installed.
2-It doesn't have the wave editor (but AudioDirector will do better).
3-It has smart sound (for Magic Music) but it's a useless gadget.

So, for those who are using win 7/8, you can stick to chinh_Liu's torrent because the h264 limitation will not apply to you.

Thank's again chinh_Liu for your programs (PowerDir 11, AudioDir 3, ColorDir 1 and Vegas Pro 12)."

,newinmac,2012-11-25T06:29Z,@GreyLlama... GOT Burned
,core_niro,2012-11-25T23:10Z,"works great...been waiting for this one for quite some time

thanks"
,khanshahi,2012-11-28T09:22Z,>>>>>>>>>>>>THANK YOU 
,newinmac,2012-11-28T13:46Z,"Since i installed PowerDirector 11, it cannot play many files formates in PowerDirector Timeline; very common file like .MP4 .MOV and .MOD file. Now even PowerDirector 10 does not work. I uninstalled both v.10 and V.11 and only installed version 11. It still cannot play videos in time line however it does play in preview.
I recently installed K-Lite codec pack and that didn't helped either.

(System spec: Intel Core i7, 8GB Ram, ATI HD5770, Win 7 64 bit)

could any one guide me what is wrong..."
,icek00l,2012-12-01T13:27Z,"@100bugs, thanks so much for the life story dude, really appreciate it, without knowing about all of your daily fuck ups, I would be beside myself with concern & worry.

@newinmac, at a glance the only thing I can see wrong is the stupid 7 often unreliable ""k-lite codecs"", why bother with that for Win7, the only video files you can't play are .flv (flash) & .mkv (matroska), in which case simply install VLC for those file types and leave the system codecs alone because for most other formats they are very good.

I can only guess, but that's likely your problem, I also have Win 7 64bit & this program works 100%"

,newinmac,2012-12-02T05:02Z,"@icek001... Thnx for reply. I tested k-lite codec and that didn't work so i uninstalled that and instead i installed the codec the link given by ""100bugs"". the  100bugs' provided codec worked with PowerDirector only for flash files but it couldn't help with H.264 video files. *I already had VLC installed.

anyway, i will try the new update provided by Chig_Liu and hope it helps me.
