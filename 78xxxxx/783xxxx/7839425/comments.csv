,leogyn,2012-11-19T15:23Z,"i just cant stand this suckers that keep complaining about 'slow speed' for a torrent released 20 minutes ago !!! Come on, your assholes ... if you dont understand how torrent transfer works, stop using it !!! Unless lots of users have the data, transfers really wont be that fast. If you wanna fast transfers, just wait 24h after the torrent gets released and, then, download it ! If you wanna be one of the firsts, just accept it wont be that fast."

,Sean.,2012-11-20T01:08Z,Can nobody bloody upload a HD file not in MKV format? It's 2012. PS3's cant even use MKV. Avi is much better.
