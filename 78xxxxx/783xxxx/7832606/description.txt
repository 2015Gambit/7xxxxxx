   This thesis presents new methods for the characterization of vegetable    
   oils, with focus in olive oil, according to geographical and botanical    
   origin, genetic variety and other issues influencing product quality. A   
   wide variety of analytical techniques have been employed, such as         
   various chromatographic techniques (different gas and liquid              
   chromatography methods), an electronic nose, infrared spectroscopy and    
   expert-panel evaluation. Several families of minor compounds, with        
   interest as adulteration markers, have been used for method               
   development, including tocopherols, sterols, phenolics, alcohols,         
   proteins and others. Most methods have been enhanced by the application   
   of multivariate chemometrics. The proposed analytical techniques are of   
   interest to investigate fraudulent actions and practices which are        
   detrimental to product quality.

  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :
  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :
  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:
