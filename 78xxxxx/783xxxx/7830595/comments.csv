,okbymyself,2012-11-16T05:27Z,Thanks again SCSA420!! I got a little nervous when you didn't post Turning Point so very glad to know you are still here. We'd be nothing without you....
[V],jmz619,2012-11-16T05:38Z,here about the 99.9% issue you're having try rechecking the torrent again on your client then see what file is missing the piece if you have the complete file still just readd it force check it again and it should start seeding the last piece to everyone. it's probably and hopefully the .nfo or the   .jpg's and not the .mp4 that's corrupted.
