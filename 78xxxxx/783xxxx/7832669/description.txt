Hi everyone :)

I'm uploading my screenplay. 


WARHAMMER 40K SPACE MARINES


It took me about 14 months to wrote it with average of 2-3 hours a day.

Screenplay is in two versions:

-Polish one, used for sending to my neighbours and friends.
Pages: 159

-English one, translated all by myself. There is still some work to do (correct some use of tenses etc.).
Pages: 158

Formats:
- .docx (MS Office Word 2007)
- .pdf

Fell free to download it and read it. 
Comments are most welcome, tell me what you think :)

When i finally fix the english version then i'll think about sending it to movie producers etc..

Cheers :)
