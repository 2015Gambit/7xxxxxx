Note from the Preface:
---------------------
This   book   is intended   primarily   for  students   specializing  in  electro-optics. However,  it is hoped that it will also serve engineers and R&D professionals, who, while not engaged directly in optics, are nevertheless involved with any of the numerous applications of optical methods of analysis.
