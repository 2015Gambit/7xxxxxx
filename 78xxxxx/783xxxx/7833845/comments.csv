As usual, save any activation with the included Tokens manager and keep the save in a warm cozy flash drive or cdr or something in case you have to reformat.

Enjoy,

i need to know how to activate windows 8 pro x84 you uploaded ""Win8 PRO x86-Multi5-Alt2_Nov7-2012"" when i installed it didnt ask for the serial key but know when i activate it with the activator you suggested ""WinAct_1.4.1""
it saying 

Error: 0xC004F074 The Software Licensing Service reported that the computer could not be activated. No Key Managment Service (KMS) could be contacted. Please see the Application Event Log for additional information.

Please Help Me What To Do"
,murphy78,2012-11-17T22:04Z,"naman thats the error it gives whilst the kms servers are down... They are all logged into Microsoft and sometimes they go down for like maintenance or something for half a day or more.  I don't have tons of experience with the kms thing, but I will say that if you manage to get it to work, save it right away with the tokens manager in case you reformat for any reason."
,murphy78,2012-11-17T22:07Z,"sorry zurt, sometimes they get a little ban-happy.  Just try to ask politely for unban and I'm sure they'll help you out."
