,wynterbourne,2012-11-18T00:21Z,"Won't open with VLC, GOM Player, Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, or Zoom Player wiith both the K-Lite and CCCP codec packs installed."
,davout,2012-11-18T00:25Z,"@wynterbourne: BS, I've viewed every episode and they work just fine."
,wynterbourne,2012-11-18T01:07Z,"@davout No, no BS. Would you like me to e-mail you screenshots? I even went through and updated each player (only one that needed it was VLC...from 2.02 to 2.04). 

I'm not saying the problem isn't on my end. But it DID fail on every program listed, with the codecs listed, and these are the ONLY videos I've ever had that problem with. "
,davout,2012-11-18T01:33Z,"Ok, I believe you, but I've rechecked all four files and I have no problems whatsoever watching them, weird. But I saw some guy dl'ing almost 5Gb from me, which seem really strange for a 2.3GB big torrent. Wondering if perhaps the files were corrupted at first? Dunno how that would've happened, I've certainly never heard of anything such, but I'm a bit clueless here so...?? I restarted my client once and maybe it re-read the files after I've restarted it. Whatever, if enough peeps says the torrent is crap, I'll take it down and have another go. Will also dl it myself from my second pc if so, to verify that the files are ok..."
,mtownsle,2012-11-20T05:59Z,Couldn't get it to play either.  Tried all the popular players and nothing works.
,davout,2012-11-20T12:07Z,"Ok, I'll take it down and reseed, thanks for info!"
,davout,2012-11-20T12:13Z,"Can't delete the torrent for what it seems, no idea why? Please *do not* dl this folks, as you can read above the torrent was fucked up..."
