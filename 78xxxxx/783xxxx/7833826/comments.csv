,raphaeladidas,2012-11-18T00:13Z,"Except the Secret Files, all these issues are part of Volume One, q.v. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Gods#Publication_history_by_volume"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-18T00:47Z,"@ raphaeladidas:  i appreciate ur input, but u r incorrect.  when one reads the credits of each issue, u will see that what i wrote in my description, and the names i assigned to my uploads, is actually accurate.  (wikipedia, because anyone can edit what is online, is well-known for being, ""close, but no cigar"" in a lot of what they publish.)"
,raphaeladidas,2012-11-18T01:48Z,"Look, technically you are correct but no one who collects comics is going to refer to these issues as anything but one unit.  When you say ""Volumes 1-4"" any collector in the know is going to think you're referring to the '71 series, the '89 series, the '95 series and ""Jack Kirby's Fourth World.""  You would have done better to title this ""The New Gods (Complete First Series)."""
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-18T03:09Z,"Technically I AM correct, I agree.  Thank you for emphasizing the obvious.

I have to disagree with your contention that, ""..any collector in the know is going to think you're referring to the '71 series, the '89 series, the '95 series and ""Jack Kirby's Fourth World.""  (How could you possibly know what others think?)  Most people will read my description, and realize the truths."
