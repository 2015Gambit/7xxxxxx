,KaliBanda,2012-11-18T05:11Z,"No - all the other episodes have been fine. If you're having issues, try playing them with MPC-HC and/or VLC and if that doesn't work, re-download them."

,damndl0ser,2012-11-30T06:31Z,"Is this the last episode of the season?  I really enjoy this show thanks for all of your hard work.  I know how difficult it is to do this and the people who take time to do it never get enough credit.

So props from me bro.  Thanks again."
