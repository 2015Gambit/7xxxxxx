Uploader's Notes: This was taken directly from the PLUS7 website. The resolution of this episode is different to the rest for some reason but it's still decent. This episode is also the final episode of the series. As always I will be hosting this torrent on a 100Mbps seedbox for as long as I can so enjoy the speeds! Seed for as long as you can too; sharing is caring.
