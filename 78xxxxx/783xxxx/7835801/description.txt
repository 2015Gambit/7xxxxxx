Some say Elizabeth Taylor was the last great movie star. Her talent, beauty, feistiness, and glamour catapulted her to stardom and she handled her success with grace and generosity. This tribute shows Elizabeth as the down-to-earth diva she was, told from the POV of one of her BFFs: Her beloved Maltese Daisy.
