,Fallerup,2012-11-22T13:55Z,"aside from the super blurry small spot up in the left corner, this is a good enough copy for early release. If you want it to be very good quality, you don't download TS'es, you wait for DVD/Blue ray rips. I've only seen one TS that was a perfect 10/10 for a TS and that was Iron man. don't remember the uploader, but it was as good as any rip that was out later on.

totally watchable... I'd also give it a 6-7 for a TS on both A and V"

,smahridoy,2012-12-02T02:43Z,"Great movie, but I don't think that is worth watching it in this quality, I was searching and I found great copy (similar to dvd rip) at twilight.nepsis.com and it worked great for me! Enjoy! "
