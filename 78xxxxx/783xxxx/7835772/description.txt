The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex: An Indispensible Guide to Pleasure & Seduction
Barbara Keesling (Author)

In The Good Girl's Guide to Bad Girl Sex, sex therapist Barbara Keesling asserts that nearly every good girl yearns to be bad and offers tips for unleashing the bad girl within. Keesling, who worked for a sex therapist as a surrogate partner for 10 years before becoming one herself, explores the inhibitions that women have about sex, and explains how you can dress, speak, walk, tease, use sex toys, give blow jobs and have orgasms like the bad girl of your dreams. In addition, Keesling, herself a former good girl meaning that like most women, she had learned to hide her wild desires from the world offers her personal story as inspiration for all women who want to learn how to feel good about being bad.
