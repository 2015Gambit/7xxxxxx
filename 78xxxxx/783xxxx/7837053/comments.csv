,googleLT,2012-11-18T15:06Z,with green house set?
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-18T15:49Z,"No, Greenhouse set isn't in this.
This Bundle cuts off at the release of Seasons.
Greenhouse came after that."
,pizzolio,2012-11-18T23:16Z,need more seedeeerrsss lol gonna take me forever to finish downloading this

,LilMissNaughty,2012-11-19T04:17Z,"@The 2 people above me.
The uploader of this torrent is my husband.
I just wanted to say he is rapping our internet to get this uploaded (even Facebook is crawling in the meantime), but at our max speed of 150kbps upload its likely to be 3 full days to get it beyond just him seeding.
Be patient and you WILL get it as he will continue seeding 24/7 until its done."
,Arup02,2012-11-19T04:50Z,Holy shit man thank you SO much for this!
,Arup02,2012-11-19T04:50Z,Holy shit thank you SO much for this!
,Arup02,2012-11-19T04:51Z,Sorry for the double post!
,coliecub,2012-11-19T17:41Z,"at this rate, it'll take me 22 days and 2 hours to download this torrent cx

but, thank you regardless. hopefully i'll enjoy this sooner than 22 days and 2 hours :D"
,Zack.Leonhart,2012-11-19T18:34Z,Thanks a lot !!! and... it's multilenguaje?
,K-NUTZ,2012-11-20T03:45Z,holy hell...
,LilMissNaughty,2012-11-20T05:23Z,"@Zack.Leonhart
Yes it is."
,Caika,2012-11-20T19:15Z,"Thanks a ton for this upload! I'll do my best to seed! Also, is the keygen included with this pack? I'm not a very advanced user, so I'm terrified I'll download this and then not be able to make it all work right. But we'll see how it goes, thanks again!"
,now_pictured,2012-11-20T21:57Z,Can I just intall the Seasons expansion? I already have previous Ultimate Sims 3 installed (meaning from Sims 3 to Supernatural). Or do I have to do a complete reinstall?
,LilMissNaughty,2012-11-21T00:17Z,"@The 2 people above me.
The answer to both your questions is yes.
Keygens are in the set and you can update from a previous install."
,K-NUTZ,2012-11-21T03:48Z,"this happen to be on any other trackers? that way we can add them to the list, maybe get this thing goin a lil better."
,LilMissNaughty,2012-11-21T08:51Z,"He uploaded it here and on KAT.
However if you google the exact torrent title you'll find others too."
,K-NUTZ,2012-11-21T17:03Z,awesome..im just tryin to seed to as many people as i can
,now_pictured,2012-11-21T18:42Z,"When I try to update the game with the patch (after replacing the cracked files as instructed), I get this message:

The setup has detected that no version of The Sims 3 is installed. This update requires that a previous version of the application be installed.

I have the Sims 3 and all the previous EPs installed...."
,Caika,2012-11-21T22:34Z,"Thanks SOOOO much for this, it works amazingly, you're awesome! Also, I was wondering, is there any way to uninstall specific expansions, or anything in case you decided you didn't want one? Thanks again for the amazing torrent!"
,F4PN-247,2012-11-22T00:03Z,"Installed per instructions. Getting ""Unable to start game service initialization failure"" when running TS3W.exe. Any help would be appreciated. "
,Arup02,2012-11-22T03:03Z,"Getting the same error, this is bullshit, i followed the instructions exactly like it's written."
,LilMissNaughty,2012-11-22T03:24Z,"Can you guys screenshot the error you guys are getting please?

@Arup02
No need for the attitude."
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-22T03:31Z,"Actually guys. Please try this...
Step One- Go to your EA folder-> Sims 3 Folder and locate DCBackup & DCCashe
Step Two- Delete Everything. (If nervous about losing, like i was save these two folders on a USB Or CD.) You don't have to delete the folder, i didn't
Step Three- Run Game (you maybe missing a few items, don't worry you can install them again)
Step Four- Install missing content
Step Five- Carry On Playing! :D"
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-22T03:33Z,"@now_pictured

Sorry, but that message tells me you will need to un-install everything and re-install again from scratch.
Make sure you backup your save games before you start un-installing or they will be permanently lost."
,dennis195,2012-11-22T05:46Z,"im seeding, and i have a small question...is the premium content in this torrent? i love the torrent by the way. super easy to work with and its just amazing...i just want the premium content and i cant seem to find it :/"
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-22T05:53Z,"All premium content is there.
You will need to go through the monthly update sections to find them. Use the complete list to help (You're looking for anything that has an EP number next to it)"
,F4PN-247,2012-11-22T05:54Z,@LilMissNaughty @DarkSamus75 Thanks for the post! I uninstalled and performed a reg clean thinking I n00b'd out after my last sims 3 bundle install. After a complete uninstall and reg clean and emptied Documents/EA/Sims 3 I re-installed and the same error generated. I have since un-installed again and I will try once more. System is Windows 8 x64 (I know i know..lol)
,dennis195,2012-11-22T05:56Z,"kool, thanks, i was just looking for that deep fryer and stuff like that, and i just cant find it"
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-22T06:00Z,"@F4PN-247
If you Google the error your getting you will find its a common error that even legit buyers get.
Only thing I can really suggest at this stage is too Google the error yourself and have a look around to see if any of the solutions will help you. (Even the official EA Sims 3 site has a thread about it and possible solutions)
Sorry that I can't be of more help than that."
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-22T06:11Z,"All the DLC is premium content.
Nothing unofficial is in the torrent
Also, I'm pretty sure the fryer is part of ""FiestaNSOMexKitDiningSET"" in the May 2012 folder."
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-22T06:15Z,Sorry I can't be clearer as to its location. I install all DLC so have never taken close notice as to what each Sims3Pack files have exactly.
,Perenelle,2012-11-22T12:23Z,"Works perfectly on my Win7 x64, thanks a lot! Seeding"
,Arup02,2012-11-22T15:13Z,"Excuse my attitude from before, but i spent 3 days downloading this, it's just frustrating."
,Arup02,2012-11-22T16:06Z,"I'm getting error number 0x0175dcbb , i have no idea what to do. Tried to install 3 times, cleaned registry, no success."
,F4PN-247,2012-11-22T16:44Z,@DarkSamus75 thanks! I have searched forums regarding the error and most results returned are patch based...likely not applicable in this case. btw thank you very much for the upload!! the package is awesome!!! w2g!
,Arup02,2012-11-22T16:59Z,"FOUND A FIX
http://modthesims.info/showthread.php?t=410739"
,dennis195,2012-11-22T18:46Z,"@DarkSamus75
Ok, so for some reason the launcher wont install the sims3pack files...as it opens, the program stops responding, and i cant install it...is there another way around it? if you would know..."
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-22T23:15Z,"@dennis
This is another common problem that even legit owners get.
I can only suggest that Google is your friend in this case. Sorry."
,dennis195,2012-11-23T04:49Z,"@DarkSamus75 
Thanks for all the help...if i figure it out i will let you know, "
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-23T05:12Z,"@Arup02
Thanx for posting the fix you found, hopefully it will benefit others as well."
,JessicaRabbyt,2012-11-23T17:00Z,"Thanks so much, I have tried to download the sims 3 a few times and only ever got it to work once but the horses froze the game.  Your copy still has that problem but everything else works great.  I found I had to make a ts3w.exe shortcut on the desktop for it to work.  "
,chiveman,2012-11-26T01:32Z,@DarkSamus75 and  LilMissNaughty thank you very much for this torrent.  I was recently playing sims 3 only up to late night.  Lots of new neat stuff in here.  I was wondering if anyone may know where i might find a torrent or free download for the Prima Guide for Seasons... please and thank you
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-26T02:08Z,"I'm also on the hunt for the Seasons Prima Guide, if you do happen to find it please share."
,chiveman,2012-11-26T08:50Z,"@DarkSamus75 and LilMissNaughty thought you might be since it wasn't included ;-) will do.   Just one more question since i just encountered error code 12 and lost my entire game (GRRRRR), do you happen to use ""nraas error trap mod"" and if so is it the ""steam"" version or the other one?"
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-26T14:06Z,The only nraas mod I use here is the nodvd one.
,llikdaor123,2012-11-27T01:16Z,excellent torrent - clean.... need more seeders though - i downloaded jst the base game and update at first as a test but starting to download full package - will keep seeding for a month - come on people - lets keep this alive and healthy
,thatjuggalo420,2012-11-27T08:36Z,so i don't know if i enough space on my actual pc hard drive to play this so i was wondering i could install it and play from my external hard drive?
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-27T09:05Z,"@ thatjuggalo420
That isn't something I've ever tried so I am not sure."
,hummingbird85,2012-11-28T01:41Z,I am terribly new to using torrents.. Do I have to use winzip after i get the files downloaded?
,hummingbird85,2012-11-28T02:00Z,or do I just copy them to the BIN folder? 
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-28T02:24Z,"I recommend Winrar to open the files.
Also you will want Daemon Tools so you can mount the disc images to a virtual drive.

I don't provide either of these programs as I worked on the assumption that most people that are going to do this will have both those tools already."
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-28T02:29Z,"So, you will begin by using Winrar to get to the .iso file it contains.

You than use Daemon Tools to mount the image to a ""Virtual Drive"" and it will act the same as putting the real disc in the drive.

Then just follow the directions in the torrent VERY carefully to install it all.

The install instructions are contained in ""shad75.nfo"" "
,AduroTri,2012-11-28T05:30Z,I hope this one works for me....if it doesn't then I'll be frustrated. (On a mac) I want to install all of them. I don't care for updates so much. I just care about getting the games to work with all the Expansions and stuff packs
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-28T06:17Z,"[quote]

** @MAC USERS, THE MAC UPDATES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BUNDLE **
** BUT YOU CAN GET THESE DISCS TO INSTALL AND SOURCE YOUR UPDATES ELSEWHERE. **

,hummingbird85,2012-11-28T07:16Z,Thanks that is all I needed to know for the time being :)
,jmorgan07,2012-11-29T22:29Z,"I just made an account just to leave this comment haha I followed your instructions exactly, but when I try to run the game it tells me that I need to insert the disk. I'm using the TS3W one like you said, and I've mounted everything, when I click on my computer it shows the Seasons one in the D drive. I don't know whats wrong, a little help please? Thanks for this torrent, it's great! Just need it to work haha"
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-30T00:56Z,"A. You don't need to mount any discs to play
B. You need to extract the ""Electronic Arts"" folder in ""NRASS Sims 3 NOCD Crack.rar"" to your My Documents folder."
,jmorgan07,2012-11-30T04:24Z,"@DarkSamus75 Thanks for the reply!
I just unmounted the one that was there still and that didn't make a difference but I'm an idiot and misread your directions, I put the cracked files in program files not in my documents. Sorry to bother you! All is fixed now and it all works perfectly. Thanks so much for this, mine is still seeding and I'll leave it for a long while =)"
,tiness69,2012-11-30T05:46Z,can someone please help me on the crack folder instructions for mac 
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-30T06:08Z,"@tiness69
Read the description.
It quite clearly says you will need to source your own stuff for Mac"

,fatallace,2012-11-30T17:48Z,"Hi, im having some issues where im in the game and it gives me a message ""disc authorization failure"". I have searched around Google for a bit for help, but cant really find much help.

I've only installed sims 3 and mounted the image on daemon tools, and opened the game using the ts3.ex file ( I dont have ts3w.exe ... ) and then end up with the error message.

Anyone know whats the problem ?"
,fatallace,2012-11-30T17:49Z,"I've also put the cracked files in the "" My Documents "" folder aswell.."
,fatallace,2012-11-30T18:02Z,"OH, and i should add that when i get the disc authorization failure, it also tells me "" We are unable to verify you disc is a valid copy of Sims 3 "", So i dont know if its Daemon Tools that im doing something wrong with. ( First time using these programs )

Sorry if im leaving stuff out of my comment lol..."
,DarkSamus75,2012-11-30T21:45Z,I refuse to answer that question because you have NOT done what its says to do in the README
,iDragoness,2012-12-01T04:19Z,"Ok so I'm doing things according to the instructions. However, when I install the Sims 3 base program, it says that various files are not the same as the system's/installer's .cad file. If I use the actual Sims 3 disc I have, I can install the stuff packs but not the expansions because it says the regional codes don't match. Any ideas?"
,DarkSamus75,2012-12-01T04:37Z,"@ iDragoness
I recommend using only files that are in this torrent.
If you still have issues I recommend you Google your issue and see what you find."
,AduroTri,2012-12-01T16:56Z,I tried installing World Adventures....It failed. (I'm on a mac.)
,DarkSamus75,2012-12-01T17:35Z,"@ AduroTri

Did you not read in the description that this is not setup for Mac?

I'm getting really tired of repeating myself because people can't read.

@EVERYONE
THIS DOWNLOAD IS MADE FOR PC, NOT MAC"
,Kylez007,2012-12-01T18:31Z,"is it weird that when i am installing the EPs it doesnt ask for a key 0.0 , im using win7 64 bit"
,Kylez007,2012-12-01T18:44Z,"every other EP i installed except seasons did not ask for a keygen ,im using win7 64 bit is this weird ?"
,DarkSamus75,2012-12-02T00:45Z,"@ Kylez007
Yes, that is weird.
However I also wouldn't complain about such an issue seems it only benefits you making it easier."

,JackNapier13,2012-12-02T08:10Z,So i did everything it said to in the readme. i even put the crack in my documents in the EA file i dont understand why it isnt working getting really annoyed ive been trying to do this for going on 2 days now.
