Orangutan Diaries: Series 2
Prepare for a rollercoaster ride of emotions following the life and death struggle to save irresistibly cute Orangutan orphans in Borneo. Two years after their inspirational and moving visit to the Borneo Orangutan Foundation, Steve Leonard and Michaela Strachan return to catch up on the progress of the rescued orangutans, meet some of the fragile new arrivals and discover how the fight against extinction is progressing. Deep in the Borneo rainforest, the dedicated vets and carers of the Foundation care for over 600 orangutans. With vulnerable babies in the nursery needing 24-hour care, playful orphans in the Forest School learning the skills they need in the wild, and older primates becoming ready for release, the team do everything they can to save the species from extinction. This inspirational series captures the drama and emotion of the Foundation as they work to save a magnificent creature on the verge of extinction. 
Orangutan Diary Series Two is a uniquely intimate look at the most engaging of the great apes, in one of the remotest corners of the world.







5)  Part 5 
After months of preparation the team embarks on one of the biggest releases they have ever attempted. Using boats, planes and helicopters, they will try to get Mama Pika, her baby and 23 other orangutans deep into the heart of Borneo. At the Centre, we meet irresistible orphans Peanut and Pickle, David (the doctor) rushes to an emergency in Forest School, Lone welcomes the youngest and most vulnerable addition to the Centre, and Angelie (missing from Forest School for over two months) walks straight through the front gate. As the series draws to a close we catch up with some of the orangutans and people who have made time at the Centre such a rich experience, and we reflect on the world of the Centre and the long-term fate of some of our closest animal relatives.
