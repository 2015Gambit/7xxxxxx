Ledernacken is a German band (actually leathernecks the stage name of Folke Jensen), which, especially in the 1980s and 1990s had a number of successes against all the American "underground" club scene. The musical style of the early years was a mix of electronic, hard rock, dance floor, accompanied by ethnic and African rhythms. Was sung in German and English. Due to the ironic sexist and violent lyrics, it was hardly played on the radio and was so in the early years to a larger audience unknown.

Their biggest success was the single "Running Amok", which was played in the club scene of the 1980s quite often. The musicians were and are involved in numerous other projects.
