NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: English Subtitles are on by default.  If you do not want them on, simply tap the V key or delete the .sub & .idx files.

NOTE: Two samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I am not sure why SHORTBREHD chose AC3 2.0 @ 224 Kbps as the audio as opposed to DTS, but that's what they did.  Don't complain to me about it; I am not the ripper.
