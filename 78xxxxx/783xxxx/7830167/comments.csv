,HKCannibal,2012-11-17T03:12Z,Thanks eztv!
,HKCannibal,2012-11-17T03:17Z,"Rar file does not exist, much less that password needed, who is having this kind of problem should be clicking on a banner instead of, ""Get This Torrent"", that is, you're doing it wrong!"
,arunprasadq,2012-11-17T04:10Z,Thanks Man..!!

,jrfs,2012-11-17T21:08Z,Thanks.
,AnubisSeedsAll,2012-11-19T05:21Z,"One Single MP4 File guys, What's the point in saying it's password protected? Anyone who knows or has downloaded any of eztv's files before knows he's a quick, quality uploader.......Don't Listen To The Idiots guys"
,MK-Foxtrot,2012-11-20T00:14Z,"The only bullshit is the comments from TheDon264, xganonx and HD4YOU. These guys are so lame. Do they really think anybody would believe three losers with no skulls and almost no uploads rather than eztv with hundreds of uploads and the honored green skull? And only three complaints out of over 25000 seeders? I don't think so. Is there any way to get these guys banned?"
,guiri_too,2012-11-20T07:12Z,Thanks
,olepeasy,2012-11-20T17:22Z,"shut up TheDon264 ! eztv is one of the trusted uploaders on piratebay.

there is nothing wrong with this.. And the quality is as good as you want it to be"
,Heltmy88,2012-11-21T01:46Z,"THX!!!
AGAIN!!

eztv"
[M],BigDadE,2012-11-21T06:36Z,"User: TheDon264, was banned for posting ""fake"" on this legit torrent."
,aksdevine,2012-11-24T09:27Z,"Great upload......as always.....Thanx a lot.

Don't fall for the hoax, quality and safe upload....."
,patisallano,2012-11-24T12:55Z,"Another Torrent advertised S06E09 and was a password protected rar within a rar. The torrent is gone now, but that torrent is probably what people were bitching about on this torrent, which is perfectly legid(as all torrents from eztv).

There is no need to password protect anything. If done, then either the uploader is a noob wanting attention through annoyance or the uploader has ill intentions.

Look for the skulls people! You don't get a skull by giving good blowjobs. You get it because you deserve it! And eztv certainly deserves the green skull.

Now - WHERE IS S06E09 ????
"
,tdudey123,2012-11-24T18:10Z,Did eztv get lost or something? Where's S06E09?
,patisallano,2012-11-25T22:21Z,"Ah! S06E09 will not be aired until the 29th, so we'll just have to wait like impatient little spoiled girls..."
,AlexLibman,2012-11-26T17:12Z,"This torrent is S06E08.

There's been an early fake (password-protected RAR) of S06E09.  The uploader of that fake is being slowly put through a woodchipper (limbs first) as we speak...

The real S06E09 won't air until Nov 29:

,bnoru8,2012-11-29T20:34Z,"OMG! why is the EP09 taking so long to be released? I know, it's today later. but WHY kill me WB? btw, thank yuo so much eztv!"
