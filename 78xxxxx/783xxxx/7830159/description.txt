"Aunt Phatso vs. Jack Donaghy"

Tracy and Jack engage in a battle of 
wits after Tracy depicts Jack as a 
villain in his latest project. On 
Jack's advice, Liz puts her own needs 
ahead of those of "TGS." Meanwhile, 
Jenna tries to shield Kenneth from 
Hazel's manipulation but her own 
selfishness gets in the way.
