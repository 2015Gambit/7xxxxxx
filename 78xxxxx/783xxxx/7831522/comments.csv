,Maher90,2012-11-16T12:39Z,Uhm..what the fucking hell?..Dead Island Ryder's White DLC? what kind of drugs are you on GhostNet? :L
[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-16T12:48Z,This the same info which reloaded uploaded and it is there mistake so ask reloaded 
,Klamrian,2012-11-16T13:34Z,"Gh0stnet,

If you, like the previous uploader, haven't got an idea whether this is an update for L.A. Noire or for Dead island why upload it?

The reason for uploading it again could be giving it the correct title AND info for your re-upload. But you didn't.

So back to Maher90's question: What drugs are you on?

[T],Gh0stNet,2012-11-16T13:54Z,"why would i change the offical reloaded nfo it is for 
L.A.Noire so if u dont like it then what can i do?"
,Klamrian,2012-11-16T14:22Z,"Wrong question.

The right question is, if the nfo is wrong why would you re-upload but not give a bit of correct info?"
,Klamrian,2012-11-16T14:25Z,"P.S. But at least now you have confirmed that it's for L.A. Noire.

Just too bad that an incorrect nfo means the entire upload is one of those where I would choose another because of mismatched information. This time as well as the last."
,chrisroberts2,2012-11-16T14:47Z,"Windows 8 support or not, the game is still boring!"
,theshop,2012-11-16T15:09Z,do you need previous updates?
,XHaloXX,2012-11-16T18:18Z,"what ungreatful fucks, the guy uploaded the update and its confirmed on orlydb, the info released by reloaded is wrong, so go all and fuck urselves, instead of thanking him you are attacking him?!?!

Ghostnet doesnt work for u or anyone, so do us all a favor and STFU!!

thanks ghost for uploading this!"
,Insomneac,2012-11-16T19:24Z,"Fucking whining little brats, I'd love to meet you in person and teach you manners.

Thanks Gh0st."
,Klamrian,2012-11-17T00:29Z,"@ XHaloXX: Bleh!

@ Insomneac: No, you wouldn't like that, I would!"
,Klamrian,2012-11-17T00:56Z,"To put things in perspective:

I do respect Gh0stNet for having earned a skull.

But I am still entitled to wonder - and ask - why anyone, skull or not, would upload something that is by name for game A with an nfo for game B.

It would after all be a simple thing to correct, or to add a comment stating wheter the name or the nfo was in error,

The only ""bad"" people here who should go fuck themselves because nobody else would, are the two abusive trolls I answered above."
