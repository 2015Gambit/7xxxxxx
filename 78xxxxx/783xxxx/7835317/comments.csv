,Vitez544,2012-11-17T18:50Z,"Sorry, does not work for me. With or without steam.
I re-installed the game , applied your fix just as instructed and when it was done tried to run game but nothing happens , not even black screen. "
,jKlark,2012-11-17T18:52Z,"@OMGTeddyBear

Have you installed Steam? Make a folder called ""dumps"" in your steam folder. Then run the game again. Make sure steam is not running while launching the game."

,Zerrb,2012-11-19T11:41Z,"It crashes for me in the mission ""Time and Fate"" just like some other crack from TPB, could it be that the problem is me then?"
,Zerrb,2012-11-19T12:39Z,"@Hyf5

4th mission being ""Time and Fate""? When Mason looks through his binoculars, the screen goes white and the game then crashes?"
,jKlark,2012-11-19T17:33Z,"@Shivson

I'm not sure. Try this. Extract the files on your desktop, then manually copy them to your game directory. Then try running the game again.

Also make sure you've updated your directx!"
,MicroBalls,2012-11-19T20:37Z,"@ace2099

When you dont know what you are talking about you better shut up. You might be happy now cause you can launch the game, wich the rest of us have been able to do since day 1, the game will still crash on you when you get to later missions."
,Hanqaqa,2012-11-19T20:53Z,"well it seems that it started now i will see if I complete the game.

Thanks a lot bro"

,chakflying,2012-11-20T14:36Z,"This works well, Great thanks to jKlark.

However there are still unhandled exceptions crashes... I don't want to blame jKlark for that though :D"
,jKlark,2012-11-20T16:44Z,"@jking79 Oh my, thank you very much for the compliments. I hope you get to finish the game with this.

@onnonseeder What i  see from those results is that Good/known antiviruses like Avira, Avast, AVG, Bitdefender, Eset, Kaspersky, MCafee. Microsoft Secirity Essentials, Panda, Symantec, etc haven't detected anything.

But these crappy/unkown antiviruses like Antity-AVL, Thehacker, TrendMicro have detected a virus, which is pretty clearly a false positive... Next time, don't be such a noob."
