Luna has been summoned by Tara, her best friend, to an ancient village on a remote island. Tara needs LunaΓÇÖs expertise on a newly unearthed artifact that might prove the existence of the legendary cult of the Madra Alta, or Wolf Man. But when she arrives the locals are acting very strangely, her friend has disappeared, and terrible clues reveal a situation beyond her worst nightmare. She must rely on her fearless wit and trusted allies to find her friend. She must dig deep into the instincts and courage of her own inner animal to defeat the Wolf King himself.
