The game follows the storylines from the The Lord of the Rings films: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. However, the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into a number of game chapters per film. Notable scenes have been recreated from the films, such as the memorable Moria scenes. Each different character has at least one special ability. The game features a new dynamic for a Lego game, where the characters will be able to acquire new items and weaponry as the story advances. "In contrast to our other games, covering those three films is an epic journey," says TT Games chief Jonathan Smith. "It really is a sense of an adventure rather than a series of stories. You build up your characters as you venture through the world of Middle-Earth. Our hub will be the world of Middle-Earth. As you see that unfold, as you journey through it toward your ultimate destination on this epic quest, that gives it a sense that is completely different to the open world of Gotham of Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes. You're really driving forward on a quest. Practically, in terms of the levels there's a mix between fighting and puzzling as you'd expect. We have some very big battles. We have some cool enemies. And then, for puzzling, if you're a connoisseur of the series perhaps you'll remember something more like Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures where we're picking up and dropping items and there's some inventory-based play as well and customization of characters as they go through the adventure.
