Essentially a reprint series, this volume packaged two issues apiece per single issue of the original 1971 series. The mini-series' final issue was originally intended to include a reprint of New Gods (vol. 1) #11 and a new 24-page story which would conclude the series and end with both Darkseid and Orion dead. However, DC editors prevented Kirby from using his original intended ending. Kirby instead turned in a one-off story called ""On the Road to Armagetto"" which was also rejected, due to the fact that it did not contain a definitive ending to the series.

A 48-page new story called ""Even Gods Must Die"" was published in the sixth issue of the reprint series instead, which in turn served as a prologue for the upcoming The Hunger Dogs graphic novel, which DC editors greenlighted in order to conclude the series."
