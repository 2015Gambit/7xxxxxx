Workshop
Added "Craft To" option for workshops
The selected item will only be crafted if the total amount is less than the specified number
When "any" material is selected it counts all items and when a specific material is selected, only items of that material

Grove
Groves are a designation, similar to Farms, that are automatically worked
Grove tasks are "Plant saplings", "Cut clippings", "Pick fruit" and "Fell trees" and each one can be toggled on or off
"Cut clippings" will remove leaves and fruit while "Pick fruit" only removes fruit.  Fruit only grows when a tree has leaves, so only picking fruit will farm fruit faster while cutting clippings will allow your Grove to expand.
Groves can be designated over an existing tree and will be considered part of the grove even if the tree type is different than what is selected
