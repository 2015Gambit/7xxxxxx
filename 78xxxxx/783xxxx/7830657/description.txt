MacDrive 9 Pro x86 and x64 (properly re-uploaded)

The instructions are a little bit confusing, so to rectify things the correct path is:

"/Program Files/Common Files/MediaFour"

OK. Here's the deal: The first step of the instructions is defective. It says the relevant crakced DLL should be copied "to program folder", which is "Program FilesMediaFourMacDrive 9". That's the wrong path. It is to be copied to "Program FilesCommon FilesMediaFour". This way, it does replace something and the crack works as advertised. Thank you, wall wallpwallpapers, but the instructions should be modified!

(Tested, and it's working!)


Enjoy!
