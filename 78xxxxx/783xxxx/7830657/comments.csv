,CaliGirl2,2012-11-22T23:50Z,Hi everyone... so I have Windows 8 Pro with Media Center 64Bit installed. I went to folder options & checked off the boxes to show hidden files in order to see the dll file. I replaced the file & restarted my computer & followed the next steps as described which is bringing up the activation window & putting in the serial provided & then after that I put in the activation provided but it keeps on telling me that it is invalid. Am I missing something here?? Can anyone confirm that this works on a Windows 8 64bit operating system?? Any help would be appreciated guys... Thank you :)
