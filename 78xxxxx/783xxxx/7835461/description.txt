King Lear is widely held as the greatest of ShakespeareΓÇÖs tragedies; to some, it is the greatest play ever written.
King Lear offers a profound look at a man who fails miserably to put his affairs in order at the onset of old age. Abdicating his throne, Lear plans to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, but insists that they declare their love in the most glowing possible terms to earn their inheritance. One daughter refuses to play his game and is disowned, and the two daughters who fawned over Lear soon turn their back on their old father. Bereft of his authority and with no place to go, Lear descends into madness. Widely considered one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, King Lear makes for memorable and meaningful reading.
