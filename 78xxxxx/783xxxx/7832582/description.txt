There's a problem in Bumblyburg that's too big for LarryBoy (Larry the Cucumber) alone to handle. Enter the League of Incredible Vegetables! Friends Bob the Tomato (Thingamabob), Petunia Rhubarb (Vogue), Mr. Lunt (S-Cape), and Junior Asparagus (Ricochet) all reveal their superhero personas to LarryBoy as the group teams up to take on Dr. Flurry, a mad scientist who is determined to freeze all of Bumblyburg in fear. Realizing that their true strength is not in their super-abilities, the League learns that God can help us conquer fear.
