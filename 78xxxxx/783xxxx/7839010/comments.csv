,FitnessGirl1972,2012-11-19T17:01Z,"@TheCrowdGoesWild - I totally agree! We wouldn't be here if we didn't want to avoid insane lines at a theatre, people talking during the film, fat cats making a killing off us, and parting with OUR hard earned buck.

Thanks, but thats $20 more staying with me.

Decent enough quality. Beats standing in a line, handing over my hard earned money to some fat cat in Hollywood, having people talking during film, and risking it being a flop with no guarantee on my money.

Bless the PB!"
,Goldielover56,2012-11-19T19:42Z,"Watchable, but a bit shaky and not always in focus.  Sound is reasonable."
,strizbiz,2012-11-19T21:16Z,hey...  all the people complaining about movies you download for free in the first place that are still in the theater and wont be on DVD for months... please stand in a single file line and blow me... thank you for your co-operation.
,evol76,2012-11-19T23:17Z,BEST COPY OUT THERE... PLAYS GREAT ON VLC
,purplehaz28,2012-11-20T02:19Z,"Video is VERY pixelated. I'd give the video a 5/10 only because the camera is moving throughout the whole movie (sometimes a LOT), because the vocals are out of sync for awhile too and there are small parts missing from the movie. I'll give the audio an 8/10 at least...I had to turn down the volume in certain parts cause it was so loud!"
,handsomebob123,2012-11-20T05:01Z,"A: 4

Audio out of sync with video at various points and by various amounts all throughout the movie (at one point it was out by 4 seconds ). Skips in audio meant the amount kept changing. Fairly good otherwise.

Video decent for Cam but often not properly aimed at screen and sometimes shaky.

,aryankhan535,2012-11-20T16:06Z,Seed guys...... Love this movie
,PongFTW,2012-11-20T16:50Z,"Long lines?  The the biggest bullshit I've ever heard.  You're here because you're too fucking cheap to pay for a movie and get off your fat ass.  I'm here because my sister already went and saw it twice in theaters and keeps begging me to get her a copy, and I'll be buying the dvd when it comes out for her too.  Don't make fucking excuses, you're here to pirate."

I rated the video so low because who ever is holding the camera is very shaky. I cant watch shaky movies like that."
,Pixie2409,2012-11-21T05:06Z,Thanks for your time doing this!!
,jallen8482,2012-11-22T05:55Z,"I do appreciate anyones effort to give us free content.

Appears as if he is holding the cam in his hand while masturbating. Extremely shaky and can only see 70% of the screen at best. Anyone that gave this copy higher than a 4 on video needs glasses and a trip to the psychologist. It does not get much worse than this folks."
,freemov,2012-11-23T08:02Z,seems like best rip till now :)
,666addictive666,2012-11-28T12:41Z,pitch perfect isnt even out yet idiot... this copy is half watchable 
,Ivan123456,2012-11-29T00:04Z,"lovely movie, i want more Twilight :(((

,jidab1540,2012-11-29T17:37Z,"sweet, romantic movie, i wish there was more of it, i hope someone will write another book for it!

,sa29,2012-11-30T14:32Z,thanx
,smahridoy,2012-12-02T02:44Z,"Great movie, but I don't think that is worth watching it in this quality, I was searching and I found great copy (similar to dvd rip) at twilight.nepsis.com and it worked great for me! Enjoy! "
,joleff,2012-12-02T13:30Z,"Great movie, but very bad quality, almost unwatchable..
so i search for some watchable print and i found more than that.. i found some leaked hd rip in superb quality at livehdfilm.pytecdesign.com	"
