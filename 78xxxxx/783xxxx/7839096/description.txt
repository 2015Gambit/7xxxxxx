This course features the best of business, body, and mind that Tim Ferriss has to offer. Modeled after Ben Franklin, Tim will present his best lessons, principles, and hacks for becoming (and remaining) 'healthy, wealthy, and wise.' This will include never-before-discussed tactics related to The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, and his brand-new book, The 4-Hour Chef. From accelerated learning to investing, the spectrum will be broad, and the actionable takeaways will be dense. This is Tim's first ever two-day workshop of this type.
