,crumrugin,2012-11-18T07:20Z,An improvement over matine version except the audio which is the same as stated by froggie (thanks froggie) the vid is super wide and watchable' barely..for a cam A/6 V/6
,some-young-guy,2012-11-18T07:24Z,"Is this better than the MATINE release, or is the same?  The MATINE cut kept dropping the audio feed periodically throughout. Video quality was not that good either."
,crumrugin,2012-11-18T09:30Z,from what I've sampled the vid is slightly better but audio is the same as matine video is still blurry but not as bad as the matine version which was terrible really I didnt watch either yet just sampled 
,some-young-guy,2012-11-18T14:18Z,"I watched the entire MATINE release and the video quality was tolerable, but the missing audio made it so I could not comprehend the movie in its entirety.  I do plan on watching it again when a better audio source is found b/c the sound cuts out for as long as an entire minute in quite a few places.  If I were a new downloader, I'd wait for a better release."

,chonchboi,2012-11-23T23:48Z,"supposedly the Inspiral versions have good audio, and this one has decent video.  Is there anyway one of you film genius can splice the 2 together?  

Anyways, thx as always for your work."
