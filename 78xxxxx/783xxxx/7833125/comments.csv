,trace535,2012-11-17T03:33Z,Why is this in 960x540? It's twice the file size of the usual release. I think I'll wait.
,safta420,2012-11-17T04:04Z,"trace535, the HR in the title means High Resolution. This isn't the SD release."
,trace535,2012-11-17T05:02Z,"I know that.

Why was the bloated HR release put out first when anyone with a working computer could convert it to the standard 404p?"
,Gingasnapz,2012-11-17T16:20Z,"how come it is a mvk, can we get a mp4 or avi pls."
,gdellave,2012-11-17T20:31Z,"Why not release the SD version first? 

I think more people will be inclined to download that instead of HD, which is a waste of time, disk space and bandwith."
,MYGTHO,2012-11-18T00:51Z,"not an mkv please ,1 only release since yesterday and its 869 meg smaller mp4 or divx "
,pauonepunch,2012-11-18T01:37Z,"a/7 v/2 

Don't bother downloading unless you want to watch pixels..."
