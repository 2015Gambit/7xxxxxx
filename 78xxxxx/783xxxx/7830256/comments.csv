,SaltyLips,2012-11-16T05:27Z,Is the video the same size throughout? So far the files I've downloaded today have the video size changing throughtout the film.

Don't no exactly what u mean, but if i started this DVD, push play, Playtime is 2:44:22.

So complete movie and what u mean with video size changing throughtout the film. 

Even with Google translate i have no idea what that could be."
,SaltyLips,2012-11-16T08:26Z,"I mean video ratio, so far the ones I downloaded has the video going from widescreen to fullscreen throughout the film. Just wondering if the ratio in this file is the same throughout?"

Thanks a lot NLUPPER
At last, The Dark Knight Rises . . . 
Wonderful work, as usual.
Just a request ...  Can we have the PAL DVDR MultiSubs version of this. No Extras needed.
It'll be excellent.
Plzzz  look into the PAL DVDR MultiSubs  (English Subs) versions of  
Looper    (2012)
Savages (2012)
Lawless  (2012)

Thank You once again
