,mentallyours,2012-11-16T18:34Z,"The Nets overcame a dreadful third quarter to defeat the Rajon Rondo-less Celtics, 102-97, at Barclays Center. An efficient Brook Lopez (24 points, six rebounds, 11-for-14 shooting) paced the Nets. Paul Pierce (22 points) came alive in the second half for the Celtics, but missed two crucial free throws down the stretch. Brooklyn's backcourt, Deron Williams and Joe Johnson, combined for 43 points and 12 assists, but inefficiently turned up the volume on their shooting, combining for 12-36 (33 percent) from the floor.
