The Ed Show; November 12, 2012.

 Big money interests have their backs up against the wall and the White House knows it!

Ed welcomed Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-FL) (Chair of the Democratic National Committee), to discuss the president's mandate for a new nationalism and fairness.

Labor unions came out in force to help re-elect President Obama and they're teaming up again to help spread the president's plan to avoid the fiscal cliff. Leo Gerard (United Steel Workers International President), joined Ed for that.

The right wing freaked out over the resignation of CIA Director David Petraeus. The Ed Show looked at their latest conspiracy theories about the timing of the general's resignation with Richard Wolffe (Exec. Editor, MSNBC.com and MSNBC Political Analyst).

The immigration evolution continues on the right. Ruy Teixeira (Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress), saw it all coming.

America's most powerful lobbyist is reduced to shoolyard name-calling. Ed showed why Grover Norquist has a lot to worry about.

And in the Big Finish, a pizza chain CEO said President Obama's health care law was going to cost his customers and his employees. ΓÇô Sam Stein (Huffington Post political editor), had the details.
