When I run it, always came to choices: (1) existing subscription, (2) trial 30 days.
Both ended with login form, in which I have to input email & password. 
What should I do, please explain, thank you in advanced."

,kadgam,2012-11-17T05:14Z,if it is in trail mode then why crack?
,cata_simi69,2012-11-17T11:40Z,"for those who figured it out, works with 2.3 too"
,watnoto,2012-11-17T22:34Z,"@cata_simi69: please explain to us, how to figure it out, so that we can run Muse in non-trial mode. Thank you in advanced."
