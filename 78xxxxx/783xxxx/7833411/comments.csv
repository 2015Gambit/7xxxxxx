,end77,2012-11-19T22:26Z,"Movie is about this male fag who's wife and son died in a car crash and now he's now traumatised and can't cope with it or man up about it and move on, he's so weak and fragile like a little bitch that's he's become handicapped. The end."
,dlight430,2012-11-20T03:36Z,"Not bad, a little slow at first, it's not that he can't get over his family dying, his soul is trapped with them and he must pass into the ""Shadow World"" to try and gain his soul back. Kind of hokey make up work at first but it gets better towards the end. Use VLC and delay 2ms to sync audio. A/V 7/7, some parts glitch and I frequently had to keep turning up the volume to hear what the guy was saying, not an issue with the upload, but a filming issue I believe. Thanx for the up scene4all!! Keep 'em coming."
