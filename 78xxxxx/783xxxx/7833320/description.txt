2500 years ago in a drought-ridden region of North India, Rajkumari Madhuri goes around distributing food while her soldiers warn a low-caste woman (Chandal) from touching her feet. After completing her task, on the way back to the palace, she is attracted to a devotee of Vishnu-Avtar Bhagwan Shri Buddh, who calls himself Bhikshu Anand. She gives him some food, but he surrenders it to a woman who needs it more, passes out, and Madhuri revives him. A local Chandal woman, Mohini, is attracted to him and follows him around. He marches on chanting 'Buddham Saranam Gachami' and is summoned by Madhuri who wants him to sing for her. He refuses, she gets enraged, but then she recognizes him and lets him go. Unable to get him out of his mind, she becomes ill and Bhikshu is summoned to counsel her. She does recover, and decides to follow and wed him. Watch what impact the Rajkumari's intrusion will have on Mohini - who will leave no stone unturned to make Bhikshu her own.
