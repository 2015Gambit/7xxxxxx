For me, there is nothing more glorious than Baroque music, and this CD is a perfect example of that! Wynton Marsalis shows off his technical expertise in playing these beautiful works by Vivaldi, Telemann, Pachelbel,Michael Haydn, and Von Biber. This recording again pairs him with conductor Raymond Leppard and the English Chamber Orchestra. It is also a technical feat, in that Marsalis plays ALL of the parts himself. The Von Biber Sonata in A Major calls for 8 trumpets alone!! I have had this recording for years, and everytime I hear it I am amazed by Marsalis' musicianship, and his ability to present the stateliness of the Baroque trumpet repertoire. It is a joy!
