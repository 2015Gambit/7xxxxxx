             reauthored from scratch in PGCedit, so the language menu 
             was removed as well to get as few PGC's as possible besides
             the title.
 
Notes........There is a limit to how many rips I will upload to TPB.
             If it has it been reached yet, is another question - I
             guess you will have to wait and see.

             'And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, 
             the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is 
             athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.'

             It seems like something Bram Cohen would say.. :-P
