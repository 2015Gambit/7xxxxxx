We upload every non-gay site kink.com offers, and even some of the gay shoots aswell from time to time. 

When a new site is released we of course plan/hope to bring you that aswell.

Kink has always debut new sites with several shoots already produced, and the fact that there are 5-6 shoots online does not mean they are already out on the shared channels yet.

We got the same questions every day for several weeks when both Electrosluts and TSPussyhunters were released. Just be patient and we will (again, hopefully) deliver.

When TPH went online it took about 2-3 weeks until the files were available through our channels, and 9 shoots had been released which we upped in one day..

So just stay tuned and we will try to do what we do best... Kink.com :D
