This will be my last re-upload of Degrassi DVD's unless I can get more than leechers,  Season 1 is the only one that I haven't kept alive single handedly, Thanks to the Season 1 seeds!  I have all seasons not re uploaded and also have S10P2 and all of S11 that haven't been shared else where, but I refuse to upload those to a public site such as TPB if I have to share 10+ copies over days to get 1 seed for less than 24 hrs....  

GO GET PEERBLOCK IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF SHARING ON TORRENTS!  OR GTFO PLEASE!
