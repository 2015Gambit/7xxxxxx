The Treasure of the Sierra Madre [1948]

Fred C. Dobbs and Bob Curtin, both down on their luck in Tampico, Mexico in
1925, meet up with a grizzled prospector named Howard and decide to join with
him in search of gold in the wilds of central Mexico. Through enormous
difficulties, they eventually succeed in finding gold, but bandits, the
elements, and most especially greed threaten to turn their success into
disaster.
