,sahilrox,2012-11-19T05:42Z,Thanks for the Pre-show mate. ;)
,lilebb,2012-11-19T05:44Z,it's too small to be the whole thing.
,Ibarehere,2012-11-19T05:45Z,too small to be the real thing
,SMOAK-inc,2012-11-19T05:56Z,It's only the web rip of the preshow. says that in the description just not the title description.
,sahilrox,2012-11-19T05:57Z,Nobody is seeding this right now. :(
,boopsy123,2012-11-19T05:59Z,Dat file size.
,stumpy42069,2012-11-19T06:01Z,This is the Pre Show not the PPV
,sahilrox,2012-11-19T06:02Z,It is just the pre-show guys......
,Neraforesta,2012-11-19T06:06Z,"Of course its fake. The PPV isn't even over yet, and that kind of miracle doesn't come from someone without a skull. ;)...just sayin"
,ghost3236,2012-11-19T06:09Z,"204 MB AND it was up 45 minutes ago? Yeah, I'm thinking so. It wasn't even seeding well. FAKE"
,hackindave,2012-11-19T06:09Z,"Not fake, but he should list it as just the pre-show in description"
,RBishop,2012-11-19T06:33Z,"Don't people read anymore?  I knew this was the preshow by reading the description.  It should have been in the title, granted, but reading a bit would clear up a lot of people's concerns.  It's not fake."

,Available,2012-11-23T14:38Z,"I tried to upload this but it kept telling me that i could not because it was duplicate. I have no clue who that 1 seed is, it's not me.  You can't get it 100% because text file was added by me , created by me. "
