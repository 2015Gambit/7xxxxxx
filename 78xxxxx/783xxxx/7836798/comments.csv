From install package file?"
,WinterGale,2012-11-21T14:21Z,"use a game manager like multiman, or you can also use filezilla and FTP via your laptop or PC"

Thanks a lot Wintergale!"
,jeedz03,2012-11-24T23:53Z,"is this a full game? also, i cant see ""exdata"" "
,WinterGale,2012-11-25T05:45Z,"yeah, this is the full game...if you have no exdata folder, create your own (that could mean you have not PSN games yet - or maybe I'm wrong..dunno) as long as it is in the same specific directory...end it with the number ""1"" e.g. 0000001)"
,jeedz03,2012-11-25T10:30Z,"cuz when i installed it,it says unlock full game..anyways,i have only ""0000003'...but i will try..thnx..:):):)"
,jeedz03,2012-11-25T10:37Z,it worked!!! thanks alot..:)
