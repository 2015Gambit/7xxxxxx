,Antares86,2012-11-20T19:31Z,Can someone explain to me why the quality of the IMAX secnes is just so much different from the rest. The IMAX stuff looks like the best I've ever seen but the rest is below average...
[T],ztorrenter,2012-11-20T20:23Z,"IMAX is better than a regular movie theatre because of the size of the screen. 
The IMAX screen usually spans from wall to wall, unlike traditional screens that are mounted in the center of the room. The light used to project an IMAX film is a super bright 15,000 watt Xenon Bulb, which allows for a better, stronger, clearer picture with a higher rate of contrast. IMAX has special Sound Engenieers or Audio Engineers who specify in creating speakers with a more powerful output in addition to crystal quality sound. 

In addition, IMAX theatres are in general, of a much better quality, because of the standards that they have to abide by, set forth by IMAX corporation. IMAX tells the theatres which movies to play, how to show them, etc."
,Antares86,2012-11-21T07:37Z,"Thanks for your answer but this explains only why a movie in an IMAX cinema looks so great. I was wondering why the scenes on this rip (and in gerneral on the bluray) look so much different. It seems like they used poor equipment for the non-IMAX scences since sometimes the focal plane is not where it should be. Very strange.

This of course has nothing to do with the quality of the rip but is an intrinsic feature of the movie. The IMAX scence are really mind-blowing though!!"
,user_001,2012-11-27T12:43Z,"IMAX is better than regular cinemas, not due to its large screen size, per se, rather the size of the film in which is captured on an IMAX camera. Over an hour of this film was shot on the 70mm format of IMAX film, opposed to the more traditional film size if 35mm, hence why the IMAX content makes the regular content seem poor in contrast."
,alphakry,2012-11-30T16:52Z,"what ztorrenter is asking isn't why IMAX is superior to non-IMAX. that much is obvious.  

It's why the non-IMAX scenes of this movie (not release) seem to be of a lower standard then usual - say in comparison to other movies that are being released now a days.  It's as if they spent all their budget on IMAX and then went cheap for non-IMAX.  I haven't had the chance to examine it myself yet, but I at least can understand why this could be a question."
,IndigoAK,2012-12-02T09:44Z,"IMAX can also be confusing because there are two different products marketed as the same thing.  There's the real IMAX which is the curved wall-to-wall screen, better sound, etc.  But the company that produces IMAX also makes a larger traditional cimema screen also marketed as IMAX.  Most theaters will not openly advertise they use the ""fake"" IMAX in order to sell more tickets."
