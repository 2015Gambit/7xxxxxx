"Shell Games"

Reba is thrilled when Geoffrey gets Mr. Bata 
to agree to have one of her songs recorded, 
but is insulted when he wants a rapper (Travie 
McCoy) to record it in her place; Lillie Mae 
discovers that she has a secret admirer; and 
Cash tries to tone down his southern accent in 
order to fit in with his school peers.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
