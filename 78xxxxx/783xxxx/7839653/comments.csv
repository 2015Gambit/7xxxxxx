,Maous1,2012-11-23T12:17Z,"For anyone experiancing random CTD during loading screens and purple textures your most likely running out of ram (either vram or reg ram)

Follow instructions at this link (PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SKYRIM FOLDER FIRST BUGS HAPPEN) 
http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5755

This will compress the size of all the extreme res textures i loaded into this mod with little loss in visual quality freeing up ram so you can game faster and longer.

Also try playing with steam offline i've had success in trying this and never game with steam online and expect to stay stable for longer than 30 mins seems the steam save sync even when off is messing with things it should not be messing with."
,ClkN,2012-11-23T18:01Z,It says that it couldn't find the TESV.exe file
,Maous1,2012-11-24T11:12Z,"This is a drag and drop mod pack not a game crack

no original exe's or bsa's were included.

For anyone getting black boxs appearing on the screen when being damaged after running ddsopt You can download and install Enhanced blood textures to overwrite the ddsopt'd ones and then all will be well :)

You will need 4 files

Enhanced Blood Textures 2_5
0 Dawnguard Compatibility_Patch
Blurry Screen Blood
Darker Brighter Blood

Dunno how much longer ill be supporting a lower resolution (ddsopt'd) version of this since i don't use it but for now enjoy"
,Maous1,2012-11-24T11:45Z,"Do not use ddsopt unless your confident in your ddsopting abilites and bug'd texture replacing getting reports of lots of purple textures even using the preIII beta ddsopt 0.8

You have been warned (always backup everything)"
