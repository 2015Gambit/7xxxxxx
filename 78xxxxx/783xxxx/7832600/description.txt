Battle Castle with Dan Snow
Follow host Dan Snow as he explores the military engineering behind such strongholds as: Dover Castle, Krak des Chevaliers in Syria and Gibralfaro in Spain and details the legendary battles that testified to their impregnability. During the Middle Ages these fortified structures were the ultimate authority in any region they were built. Both defensive and offensive, they were centres of administration, symbols of power as well as concentrations of military might. But what was it that made each successful? Through dynamic location footage and immersive visual effects, this six episode series reveals the bloody history behind these fortifications and the weapons designed to defeat them. Each episode will climax with the ultimate test of each castle's strength: examining the epic battle that changed the course of history.


1)  Crac des Chevaliers 
Set high above the Syrian landscape, Krak des Chevaliers was built by the Knights Hospitaller to dominate the landscape and act as a symbol of Christian power. Its flawlessly-cut stones, steep slopes, and deadly entrance designed to resist any attacker. In 1271, a Muslim warrior king and his powerful army came to seize this crown jewel of Crusader castles and drive Christians from the Holy Land. But will the Sultan, Baibar and his army, be strong enough to take the stronghold?

2)  Chateau Gaillard 
Towering above the River Seine, Chateau Gaillard was built by King Richard I to assert England's authority over his French holdings. Its multiple walls, deep moats and ingenious geometry were designed to terrify any foe. In 1203, a French king and his massive army lays siege, determined to push the English from the continent. Could its formidable defences repel the ambitions of Philip II, king of France?

3)  Dover Castle 
High atop the white cliffs of southern England, Dover Castle was built by King Henry II to protect an empire. Its deadly gatehouses, layers of walls, and magnificent keep were engineered to crush the enemy. In 1216, an ambitious French prince and his determined troops descend to capture this key to England and with it, the English crown. will Louis VIII of France and his army manage to breach the walls and seize the English crown?

4)  Conwy Castle 
Positioned the wilds of northern Wales, Conwy Castle was one of several strongholds raised by King Edward I to rule over the Welsh. Its mighty towers, elongated arrow slits and majestic water gate were built to intimidate. In 1294, a rebel force arrives to put the king's castles, and English domination, to the ultimate test. Would the welsh force headed by Madog ap Llewelyn, the last recognised native Prince of Wales succeed in taking the castle?

5)  Malbork Castle 
Stretched along the bank of the River Nogat in modern-day Poland, Malbork Castle was built by an elite group knights during the Baltic Crusades. Its distinct brick architecture, soaring walls, and deadly battlements were built to intimidate the local population. In 1410, a pagan-turned-king marches on the castle, determined to put an end to the Teutonic Order's reign.

6)  Gibralfaro Castle 
Located high above the Mediterranean coast, Gibralfaro Castle and its surrounding defences are the monuments of a Muslim dynasty. Its daunting towers, brilliant water-storage, and one-of-a-kind passageway were engineered to withstand the most ambitious attacker. In 1487, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella descend to capture the city and destroy the legacy it represents - but will their audacious plan win the day?
