,thug940,2012-11-18T14:44Z,Fake fake Fake fake
,hackerps3,2012-11-18T20:06Z,"It's not fake,I created the torrent with UTorrent this morning and uploaded it. I haven't seeded anything yet because I'm busy with my kids for the weekend. This torrent should work just fine and I'm willing to upload it once again just to prove it! "
,hackerps3,2012-11-18T20:17Z,"That's why there's currently 16 seeders and 711 leechers right? Quit posting dumb comments on peoples uploads and find something else to do,I know what I'm doing, I work on computers for a living! My uploads are always right on."
,190574,2012-11-19T01:51Z,"I am downloading it right now. My question is, what is missing? I see you are missing 3min."
,190574,2012-11-19T01:53Z,"Holy slow dl speed. 0.1. And I use high speed internet, lol"
,Amatyi1,2012-11-19T07:02Z,"I'm willing to stay with it for a little bit to see if it works. If there is a million leechers and only a few seeders then, yes it will take a little bit to download. I went and saw the movie today and it's definitely worth waiting on. It's the best one yet in my opinion. If it works (and I will come back and re comment if it does) then thanks for the upload."
,Amatyi1,2012-11-19T07:03Z,and there are 10 seeds and 524 peers right now so there are seeds.
,charmed31,2012-11-19T07:35Z,"there are no seeders on this.  it wont download, someone pls seed for me. "
,Amatyi1,2012-11-19T17:38Z,"People please please seed so I can download. I promise I'll seed it for a month. I always do, I just need one seed to download it. This is why I miss Demonoid where there was no hit and runs cause people had to keep a ratio to keep there membership."
,Amatyi1,2012-11-19T17:44Z,"and for the people that don't know what seeds are, you have to keep the original file in the same location it was when you downloaded it and keep your computer on so it reuploads it so someone else can download it. If you stop the torrent after you download it or move the file then no one else can download it. Everyone that downloads it has to keep the torrent going and it keeps uploading it and creating seeds so other people can download it. That's the simple explanation to it. If people don't do the research and find out if they are seeding or not I don't think people should download torrents because it hurts it for everyone else. You also have to forward a port at http://portforward.com/ Just close the ad and go through the instructions. I hope this helps someone."
,hackerps3,2012-11-20T17:07Z,"Nothing is missing from this except some of the credits at the end. I have started seeding this on my comp. and hope everybody finally get's it quickly. Let me know how it goes for you,I know it's not the best copy but it's better than nothing at all."
