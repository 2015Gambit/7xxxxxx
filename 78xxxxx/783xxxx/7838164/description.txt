In the second issue of Lookouts, the boys must challenge a troll, and along the way, learn that that most powerful weapon at their disposal is not a sword. This month's handbook excerpt is the Sibling Lunarist badge, which requires deep and abiding knowledge of the sibling moons, Corrina and Cassuls.
