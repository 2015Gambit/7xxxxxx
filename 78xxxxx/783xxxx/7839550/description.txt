   This book is a compendium of the finest research in nanoplasmonic         
   sensing done around the world in the last decade. It describes basic      
   theoretical considerations of nanoplasmons in the dielectric              
   environment, gives examples of the multitude of applications of           
   nanoplasmonics in biomedical and chemical sensing, and provides an        
   overview of future trends in optical and non-optical nanoplasmonic        
   sensing. Specifically, readers are guided through both the fundamentals   
   and the latest research in the two major fields nanoplasmonic sensing     
   is applied to  bio- and chemo-sensing  then given the state-of-the-art    
   recipes used in nanoplasmonic sensing research.

  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :
