Stripped.....DD2.0, Warnings/trailers/extras with their menu, 
             all the crap and even the title menu - to keep  
             the authoring nice and tidy. I did infact reauthor 
             the entire DVD from scratch in PGCedit.

Notes........Retail quality was as decent as you can expect, but
             I did some undoting and sharpening on it. If you're 
             not after Nordic Retail DVDRs, a HD-rip has been 
             available for a while now.

             If you want more of my media - find me. 




             'And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, 
             the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is 
             athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.'
