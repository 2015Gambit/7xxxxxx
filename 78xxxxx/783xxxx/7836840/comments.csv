,Ramen1996,2012-11-18T10:38Z,Thanks for another great torrent! :) I'm excited for the other eras the most since all the singles I own are from the first 2 eras! :P
,Ramen1996,2012-11-18T11:16Z,Are you still seeding? It's stuck at 2.2% :(
,fanbritney,2012-11-19T08:07Z,"I am! Unfortunately I could not be online these days and the torrent is new, it is a natural delay.

After the first 2 Eras, the singles are much rarer."
,Ramen1996,2012-11-19T08:59Z,What singles do you have after the first two eras?
,fanbritney,2012-11-19T20:26Z,"Many, I was at, I would be great to list here. You'll see when I'm putting. ;)
I'm separating not even know if the Eras put in order."
,Ramen1996,2012-11-20T09:58Z,"I'll tell you this: I'm definitely excited! I wish I had a big Britney collection! The closest to rare I have is the 4 singles I have (BTMYH, FTBOMBH, OIDIA, and Stronger: Remixes) or the double disc Greatest Hits album. If you have any different versions of Britney albums, I'd love those too please! :)"
,fanbritney,2012-11-21T03:13Z,"I managed to get a reasonable collection and keep collecting as new things when you go out or something older.
For now I'll be putting the singles divided by ERAS, but I soon put the albums. :)

Look here to see if the pirate bay does not have the full albums."
,Ramen1996,2012-11-21T18:54Z,"Well, I don't mean it like for the tracks. Mainly versions as a dedicated Britney fan like myself has every album of Britney's. I'm looking for versions released in different countries, for example, Japan versions of albums such as ...Baby One More Time and B In The Mix, Vol. 2"
