Fast backup saves your stuff.
Bootable recovery saves your time.

Carbon Copy Cloner backups are better than ordinary backups. Suppose the unthinkable happens while you're under deadline to finish a project ΓÇö your Mac is unresponsive and all you hear is an ominous, repetitive clicking noise coming from its hard drive. With ordinary backups, you'll spend your day rushing out to a store to buy a new hard drive and then sit in front of your computer reinstalling the operating system and restoring data.

With Carbon Copy Cloner, your data and the operating system's data are all preserved impeccably on a bootable volume, ready for production at a moment's notice. When disaster strikes, simply boot from your backup and get back to business. Replace the failed hard drive at your convenience, and then restore all of your stuff in one easy step.

Any backup application can save your stuff. A CCC bootable backup will save your productivity as well!


THIS IS THE OLD FREE VERSION OF CARBON COPY CLONER. The new one requires you to pay!!!!  This will work on Lion and Mountain Lion just fine.
