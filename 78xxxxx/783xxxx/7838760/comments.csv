I still have the beta version 3.5-b2 for Snow Leopard which is still considered donationware."
,DonCalimero,2012-11-19T08:07Z,"Use latest Version ...
Open Terminal & write:
defaults write com.bombich.ccc paid -bool YES"

I D/L & installed CCC v3.5.1, 
entered into Terminal: defaults write com.bombich.ccc paid -bool YES,
restarted my Mac,
opened CCC and it shows that there is still a 30 day trial period for CCC 3.5.1.
All the features work and backed up everything from my SSD as usual but we'll see after 30 days from now.

Along with your Terminal command, you have to this additional command:

defaults write ~/Library/preferences/com.bombich.ccc RegistrationName -string ""RIZZO 220""

Add your name where RIZZO 220 is with the quotes and BAM! Your CCC copy is registered and good to go!"
