,Butyluvin,2012-11-17T20:09Z,Why have you been uploading your videos x264?
,SSwag,2012-11-17T21:24Z,"That's the original quality of the videos. Bigger resolution, no pauses, and skip free. That looks to be the best way to go to me. Also if you think BSL videos are uploaded on the site in true HD, then you are sadly mistakin'."
,Butyluvin,2012-11-17T23:24Z,"Thanks, I asked because this quality is hard to play on my computer, but whatever these are still good videos."
,SSwag,2012-11-18T00:29Z,"I never had a problem with this quality. Try updatin' your codecs with K-Lite Codec Pack for Windows, or Perian for Mac. Google it, shouldn't be that hard to find."
,pheiniken,2012-11-18T17:17Z,is normal videos that site has paused in some places?
,SSwag,2012-11-18T22:46Z,"@pheiniken That's a tricky questions. It's normal for the majority of people to view these videos on the site with pauses in them only because BSL use a very shitty stream service. So if you try try to watch/download the videos at the wrong time of day or even popular videos it's likely the video will have pauses in them. But as you can see with this different quality I'm uploadin' now, it's possible to get perfect copies of these videos. It's not easy, but it can be done."
,pheiniken,2012-11-19T09:09Z,"In the video you've downloaded via torrent, some parts must pause.
A little strange, but the video was not bad.
Any chance you post more videos of lia cha?

thanks for the BSL torrents! Asewoome share man!"
