Spanning the history of the railroads from the steam engines of the 1830s to the bullet trains of today, Sid MeierΓÇÖs Railroads! is a bold re-imagining of the legendary Railroad Tycoon (1990), the game that launched the ΓÇ£tycoonΓÇ¥ genre.

ΓÇó Engage in corporate warfare with rival tycoons, slick entrepreneurs and robber barons such as J. Pierpont Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt.

ΓÇó Choose your cargo wisely! Marry the supply of natural resources with the demands of industry to create a thriving economy.

ΓÇó Trade stock, build industries and bid for patents to steam ahead of the competition.

ΓÇó Build the model railroad of your dreams in ΓÇ£Train TableΓÇ¥ mode, where your imagination is free from the pressures of finance or competition.
