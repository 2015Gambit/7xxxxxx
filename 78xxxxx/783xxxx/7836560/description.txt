OVERVIEW:

It is impossible to convey in words TolstoyΓÇÖs extraordinary capacity to transform a work of fiction into a spiritual quest for truth. Indeed, in War and Peace, it is above all, the exhausted truthfulness in his character that is most striking, revealing a sincerity which seems to fear nothing in exploring the most profound and inexorable philosophical ideas.

Indeed, it is in this context that TolstoyΓÇÖs enigmatic remark, namely that War and Peace is "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less an historical chronicle" can be understood. For War and Peace certainly is a truly great novel, is an undeniably powerful poem and is a historical chronicle of epic proportions. But underneath the unforgettable scenes of destruction and the beautiful passage on love is a metaphysical treatise on the very nature of Man and his relationship to God.
This collection brings together, for the first time in one volume, TolstoyΓÇÖs War and Peace with the definitive preface on TolstoyΓÇÖs lasting literary legacy.

The masterful translation, which was personally approved by Tolstoy himself, is by Louise and Aylmer Maude.
