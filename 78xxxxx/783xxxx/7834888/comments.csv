Video: 9 (pretty good)
Audio 7 (not so good, had to equalize the sound for it to sound decent)"
,spudger,2012-11-18T03:41Z,Video 9? Maybe for a cam.  Sound is horrible and the pic quality is so crappy won't try to fix sound. But thanks for your efforet.
,monomi,2012-11-18T05:09Z,forgot to mention but the sound goes out of sync after the first 30min
