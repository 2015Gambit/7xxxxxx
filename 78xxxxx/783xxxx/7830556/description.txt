ADAGIO is the air, the flow, the burn and the sorrow of symphonic strings.

Produced by Academy Award, TEC and G.A.N.G Award Winning Composer, Troels Folmann and Emmy nominated composer and orchestrator, Colin OΓÇÖMalley,  8Dio Adagio String Series marks the most expressive collection of deep-sampled emotional strings ever created. Adagio contains a variety of advanced techniques that were specifically developed for the library. The techniques allow you to create completely realistic string sequences with true emotion and passion. You donΓÇÖt need to be a master orchestrator to sound great.

Adagio Violins is our first release, which will be followed by Cellos, Violas and Basses later in 2012. Adagio Violins contain three main groups of violins. Full ensemble Violin (11), Small Ensemble Violin (3) and Solo Violin (1). All groups have been extensively sampled and recorded in a signature church environment with a hand-selected group of master violinists. All groups were sampled with three different microphone positions (close, far, mixed). We employed all current generation sampling techniques (ex. true legato, deep sampled repetitions etc).  New techniques were also developed to capture a higher level of emotion and humanity in the performances.  The result is a passionate virtual instrument which is extremely agile to play.

Adagio is designed to meet the needs of both the traditional and modern composer. Welcome to the future of sampling with motion and emotion.
