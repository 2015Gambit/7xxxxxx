[H],zMTz,2012-11-26T15:50Z,"^ your torrent client will automatically start seeding when you reach 100%. The status will change to ""seeding"". Seeding means others can download off you, reaching a ""ratio"" of 1 means you have given back what you put in. You can seed forever, although it's courteous to seed to at least a 1 ratio :) "
