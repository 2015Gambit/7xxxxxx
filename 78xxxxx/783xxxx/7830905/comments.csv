,denofdanzers,2012-11-16T15:31Z,"Well lemme be a nerd here, currently I am having win7 if I download n install this torrent, I will have win 8 pro retail (i.e. final version) untouched of course, with unlocked personalization and media centre and for which I dont need any loader or crack, just the free wmc key and by using it my os will be activated n run forever, yeah?
P.S. I made an account on TPB just for this comment, so do reply :p"
,creative3,2012-11-16T15:47Z,"@denofdanzers,
yes dear, you are right. you do not need any activator, crack or any type of hacking stuffs to activate it pirately. you just need you your own free wmc key to activate your windows 8 proWMC online legitimately. activation is permanent 100% genuine forever. and if it is legitimate and genuine so you can enjoy all features fully unlocked. final word is that activation is done through microsoft online so no more doubts."
,akshu0992,2012-11-16T17:46Z,"thanks bro for the quick reply.
i have one more question can i use win 7 drivers to win 8?"
,creative3,2012-11-16T18:34Z,"@akshu0992,
dear, all manufacturers have released their products driver for windows 8. just go this official site and download respective drivers for win8.
win7 drivers will work with backward compatibility but with some error so I will not recommend it. "

Plz seed.."
,akshu0992,2012-11-17T10:14Z,"@creative3
my mothercboard manufacturer has not relesed driver for the one which i have so i just want to be sure before installing it..
is there any other way from which i can get drivers for win 8?"
,creative3,2012-11-17T11:38Z,"@akshu0992,
if your MotehrBoard is one yer old than I do not think you will need any drivers as win8 will recognize your most of the hardware and will automatically install all drivers for that motherboard.
anyways, please mention here your motherboard type and model with brand name then i can guide you in detail."

,johnplayerson,2012-11-17T21:17Z,"Just as info, but you can install two instances of windows 8 on your pc, and use another install key from Microsoft for each one. Then you got two licenced versions on one machine. Works good as extra backup or if you just want to have a quick boot, with no extra programs running. "
,akshu0992,2012-11-18T01:46Z,"@creative3
Gigabyte  GA-G31M-ES2L (rev. 1.x). It's 3 years old. And i got a windows 8 upgrade assistant in which it showed that my lan and audio drivers are compatible.
Thanks."
,akshu0992,2012-11-18T01:49Z,and my motherboard has Intel速 G31 + ICH7 Chipset
,creative3,2012-11-18T03:18Z,"@akshu0992,
dear, you do not need to search for drivers as windows 8 install will load all requisite drivers for this MOBO. later you can update drivers under device manager. but I am sure that updating your windows will install all drivers if not detected during install of win8."
,abhaykv.13,2012-11-18T03:55Z,Can I install updates or MS will catch it as counterfeit ??
,murphy78,2012-11-18T06:57Z,"Interesting.  I hadn't heard of modifying the data.dat file to accept the upgrade keys on install. Very cool.  I will have to check this out.

its genuine activation hence what ever you want to do you can do. remember its 100% genuine activation from Microsoft."
,creative3,2012-11-18T07:39Z,"@murphy78,
original data.dat file is of size = 5.10 KB embedded in ISO while after modification its size increased to 17 KB.
I can post what has been modified but wait for it till 1st Feb 2013. 1st Feb 2013 is the  last date of activation with free wmc key. "
,newfalcon,2012-11-18T14:49Z,"@creative3

yes, you can."
,murphy78,2012-11-19T10:39Z,"Yep creative3.  I went and searched it all on the internet and did my own thing.  I'm curious.  Are you the same person who created the data.dat?  When I delved into the file it just seemed to have binary content.  I gotta say, whoever created the version that allows upgrade keys without going through pro first is a damn internet hero :)"
,creative3,2012-11-19T11:17Z,"@murphy78,
some questions are difficult to answer directly. I do not use proxy IP."
,creative3,2012-11-19T14:42Z,"@murphy78,
please note that the data.dat file has not been modified manually instead it has been obtained by fooling MS windows 8 codes.
how to obtain the modified data.dat file.
1. install windows 8 pro
2. activate it.
3. now go offline internet and upgrade your windows 8 to proWMC using any wmc key. let it complete. (going offline is necessary as this upgrade to ProWMC should not be activated). windows 8 itself prepare a platform (dtat.dat) to accept for wmc key now. please remember that once activated it will become unusable. non-activated wmc data.dat file has all option to change the cd key and activate it. upgrading to wmc data.dat also allow only to use wmc key and not the pro key. further, as soon as this data.dat file recognize another system it obviously asks a different wmc cd key.
this is our modified data.dat file.

this is the logic used by many and once more thing I am not the first who thought it.

have a nice day."

,kaka112,2012-11-20T16:41Z,"I have made an account just to write this comment. Thanks alot uploader. This version of windows is working like a charm. All apps work perfectly, windows is activated for life , windows media centre included, system can recieve updates, seems to be geniune."
,creative3,2012-11-20T16:51Z,"@tz34v4wow,
why asking for cracked version when you have option to activate windows 8 Pro Final with media centre genuinely permanently ?

download this retail final version of windows 8 Pro with media center and activate online legitimately."
,tz34v4wow,2012-11-21T01:14Z,"I NEED HELP, I installed this windows and it's not activated, What activation de you recomand.

dear, if it is not activated then activate it online and it will be activated if you used the free wmc key from MS at the time of install."
,lkshghdsl,2012-11-21T07:00Z,"Hi.. Thanks A Lot Installed like Charm everything working nice and fast.

And thanks a lot for sharing this as others i specials made this account to thank you . seeding since installing windows ."
,joe1way,2012-11-21T13:35Z,thanks creative3 ... nice work
,denofdanzers,2012-11-21T14:40Z,"Nerd Alert!!
First of all thnx creative3, I downloaded and installed. It worked, and got validated.
A question though-
I downloaded the torrent and got the iso file. I burned to a dvd. but when I restarted my machine using this dvd, the setup didnt started automatically.
I hav to manually run the setup.exe
It prompted ""customized"" or ""upgrade""
I chose upgrade but it said win7 cant be updated to win 8 pro (though i have checked my pc specs & it passed to be able to install win 8 pro)
so i selected custom.
and now I have two os on my machine.
Win 8 pro
win 7 :-|

How to make bootable dvd? and/or how to install win 8 so it deletes win 7?

thnx..
n sry for long story..."
,creative3,2012-11-21T16:37Z,"@denofdanzers,
please boot from DVD. there is special key like F10, F9 or other depend on your Motherboard.
better go to Bios setup (Press F2 repeatedly when system starts) and there change the boot order of your DVD to 1st and then save this setting and restart your system. it will now boot from DVD and then you can have clean as well as upgrade install."
,creative3,2012-11-21T17:19Z,"@lkshghdsl,
what is the name of your system image backup? it should be ""WindowsImageBackup"" and it should show Empty folder though if you open it and open it and open it to the last subfolder then it will show the real size."
,abhaykv.13,2012-11-21T17:53Z,"Thank You very very very much @creative3.
You are the best..!!
I installed and it is working perfectly..!!
Thankxxxx !!"
,creative3,2012-11-21T17:55Z,"@lkshghdsl,
the same way as you installed and activated first time. but remember that this activation can be done till 1st Feb 2013. after this date you can not use your free wmc key to activate windows thats why i suggest everyone to make a system image backup."
,lkshghdsl,2012-11-21T18:01Z,"Yes got it , its around 6.88 GB , so if i require to install windows again then can i use this image to install windows legitimately and what is the procedure of the same.

And thanks Again for replying .... "
,kiritoo,2012-11-22T14:51Z,so it's not a lifetime activation? just until 31 jan 2013? and what happen after that day.?:) 
,creative3,2012-11-22T18:26Z,"@kiritoo,
Activation is lifetime but you have to use those cd keys before 1st Feb 2013. Please note that this is only for testing and education purpose. if you like this then better buy one copy to support developers."

do not run setup file from desktop, burn this ISO on DVD/usb stick and boot from this DVD/usb stick and then try to upgrade. this can only upgrade 32 bit win7.

@lkshghdsl,
the key only be used till 31st Jan 2013. but make a system image backup of your activated windows and this can be restored even after that date and restore will be activated. no need to use any key."
