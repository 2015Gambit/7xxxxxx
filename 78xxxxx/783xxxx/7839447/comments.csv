Hope it's real.

,fullkontakt520,2012-11-19T04:36Z,sure enough.. this can't be real.
,ZWEMG,2012-11-19T04:37Z,This has to be BOGUS....
,ascribble,2012-11-19T04:52Z,"yes, fuck you MP4SUX"
,kloathy,2012-11-19T05:09Z,"Haven't checked yet, but it aired three hours ago on the East coast, so it's easily possible it's the real thing. Just playing Devil's Advocate"
,serper,2012-11-19T05:10Z,FAKE FAKE FAKE
,Gonzotabb,2012-11-19T05:34Z,"damn, you cant even trust people with skulls anymore."
,piggypab,2012-11-19T05:56Z,"Slow dl compared to RTWBM. 
Nevertheless appreciate and many thanks for giving us Xvid!  

You're the man (="
,faker342,2012-11-19T06:03Z,"Was a bit slow to download, but turned out to be legit.

Still not sure how you got it up so fast, but thanks MP4SUX!"
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-19T07:35Z,"Sorry for those who didn't trust, but I understand it.

This is only the second time since I started that I got a jump on everybody.

How did I do it? Lots of hitting the ""search"" button until magically a WEB-DL shows.

That's UseNet, NZB & all that.

This is now two weeks in a row that the WEB-DL showed up first.

Don't know why, don't care. Sorry I'm just one guy with 2Mb/s U/L bandwidth.

It sure was fun watching the numbers climb above 6,000 and then the rollover ...

That's the magic tipping point when ""peers"" transfer to ""seeds"" and it's pretty.

And, as always, I wouldn't be able to do this without those sharing their
resources after the initial seed. Thank the thousand of you ...

[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-19T07:42Z,"The place for the dis-gruntled to become re-gruntled ...

And now for my fan mail, reading from the bottom up:

serper: shame on you.
Yes, Gonzotabb: there is a sanity clause ...
ascribble: you talk to your momma with that mouth?
ZWEMG: Surprise! seems NOTHING ""has to be"" anything.
fullkontakt520: sure enough, the angels were smiling on my sorry ass today.

The really cool thing, of course, is that these comments are permanent
and the ""yes it's real"" comments after yours shows you to be somewhat
less than accurate.

,Oxidation,2012-11-19T08:49Z,I have downloaded all of this guy's other Homeland episodes and have had no issues. Note the fact he is also a trusted user. Please vote up the quality to counter the people who made rash judgments.
