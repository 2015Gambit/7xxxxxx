I wish someone would upload the PC version, though."

@Garfelt & Tiga1234 You won't be seeing a PC version for at the very least another week, it's not being released to stores until Nov. 27th"

,Tiga1234,2012-11-16T17:08Z,"according to wikipedia, the pc version came out on November 13, 2012 with the xbox, wii, and ps versions"
,Tiga1234,2012-11-16T17:11Z,Target has the pc version of this game in stock
,SFMike,2012-11-16T17:31Z,"Target does not have the PC version in stores, in says ""in stock"" on their main website, but if you try to find a store that actually has it it will say ""out of stock""

Probably looking to the end of the month to see the PC version"
,Noelzin,2012-11-17T00:54Z,"Thank you so much,been waiting for this one.And the game is working perfectly."
,Viper67857,2012-11-17T01:08Z,"Thanks for the upload :)...the scene has been slacking hard on wii games lately, especially US versions"
,Kosake666,2012-11-17T05:03Z,"Many thanks for the upload, will be seeding all night!"

,rellikpd,2012-11-17T20:24Z,Just curious: Does this require a MOD'd Wii? or can i just burn and play?
,wyattspoppa,2012-11-17T22:39Z,"SCORE! Works flawlessly, but for those of you asking about non-modded Wii's, no dice. I did a slow-burn after I converted to an ISO and the burn failed 5 minutes in...wasn't my equipment or user error, I've burned many, many backups using only Verbatim discs, this will only work on a mod. Makes a file about 3.5 gigs on your HDD. Thanks Smurf"

,wyattspoppa,2012-11-17T22:48Z,"Almost forgot, play in a dark room on the best TV in the house, the dark scenes are very dark (not an upload issue), all the audio is straight from the film, original actors, very cool cut-scenes."
,Izeball,2012-11-18T16:06Z,Is there a PAL version somewhere?
,thedouce69,2012-11-19T02:43Z,Could someone post up an iso version
,kupkafan,2012-11-19T06:50Z,"DIdnt work for me, when I converted wbfs file to iso ( with Wiijmanager), it created 2 iso files, and when I burn the first one, it wont install, it freezes..... do I need both Iso files?.......its happened a few times with Wii games so far"
,sammmmurai,2012-11-19T11:20Z,"Here's how I did installed and played with success in Wii:

Convert to .iso with Wii Backup Manager
http://r3dux.org/2010/04/how-to-convert-wbfs-image-files-to-iso-images/

Then put the iso in my External hard Disk 320gb 
with wbfs manager.

Then in Wii used uLoader with IOS 223

It works!"
,smurf212,2012-11-20T19:34Z,"@sammmmurai, if you're putting it on an external HDD and using Wii Backup Manager (same as me) why bother converting it into an ISO?  WBM by default converts anything not already in wbfs into it to save space on your HDD.  With this game for example wbfs format saves you 0.93GB by removing dummy files, update partition, etc.

@kupkafan, What OS are you on so that I might be able to assist you a little better.

@thedouce69, Putting up an ISO version would be possible albeit pointless, as the file would be much larger.

@Izeball, I doubt there will be anytime soon as someone else stated the Wii scene is in serious decline.  You could always use this NTSC-U one and in whatever loader you're using change the Video Mode setting to ""Force PAL50"" or ""Force PAL60"" depending on your specific needs, you could also RegionFrii this image with http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/RegionFrii"
,spyro66,2012-11-21T14:41Z,going to seed for a long time
,axprodigy1,2012-11-22T00:52Z,"smurf212: WBFS manager does convert stuff to the wbfs format but for some reason, for me at least, it refuses to directly import files already in the wbfs format. I do the same thing that sammmmurai suggested. I use Wii backup manager to convert them to iso and then load them to external using WBFS Manager. To run the games i use the d2x cios from waninkoko in slot 249 and run the games from usbloader gx."
,axprodigy1,2012-11-22T00:54Z,"Felt I should add that I,m on firmware 4.3u and i hacked my Wii using the Letterbomb mod."
,smurf212,2012-11-22T07:30Z,"@axprodigy1, WBFS manager I'm not sure about as I haven't used it in a couple years, but I use Wii Backup Manager for everything, whether it be rar, iso, or wbfs files it takes care of it just fine.  Just make sure if you have any dual layer and are using FAT32 that you change the settings accordingly."
,danneman_77,2012-11-22T15:43Z,Can I play this using Dolphin. Without having to use a wii controller?
,smurf212,2012-11-23T06:52Z,"@danneman_77, no idea, but you can always try it and report back, or get the PC version that was released..."
,shakespeare4711,2012-11-23T11:22Z,thanks
,plmmm,2012-11-25T20:06Z,Thanks! Converted it to iso with Wii backup manager and works great!
