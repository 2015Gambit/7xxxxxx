,m3nt4t,2012-11-19T16:54Z,"WTF happened to this show. The 1st 3 episodes were all season-ender quality, and then this POS. It has indeed jumped the ghey shark. That annoying Brody daughter and her gay hipster ""BF"" should GTFO."

,Dwch,2012-11-27T22:21Z,"@m3nt4t: Please don't post comments about the content of the show. That's not what the comments section is for. Thank the uploader or comment on the quality of the audio or video. People are here to download the episode and they're not going to change their mind about it because some random schmoe says he didn't like it.

There are other places for critiques like Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic, but I'm fairly certain that over here, nobody cares about your opinion. It's just a spoiler."
