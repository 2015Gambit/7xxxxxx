This is 1 part of the series from the NRA.
I never ordered it but they sent it to me anyhow.
so i figured maybe some zombie hunters will need to know 
more about guns and how to shoot and safety.


it is an .ISO rip of the whole disk. 
didn't bother takeing the vids out in avi's.


how to:   well this is a how to dvd so might as well say it.

     You will need a virtual disk software to mount the .ISO
you can use this one http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads
or find one from the pirate bay. I my self am parshial to Alchol 120.
as I have been using it for many years.

when you install that program press open disk or find disk and point it twords your downloaded copy. and press mount. then either it will auto open the dvd menu depending on how you have your computer set up, or you will have to go to the file explorer and click your disk drive.

P.S. - now you know how to use a weapon the right way dont shoot me or your foot.
