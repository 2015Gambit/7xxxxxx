November has arrived. I noticed. Late.

But maybe next month will be on time. Hard to say right now.

This was a hard month. I had over 150 tracks for weeks before I could whittle it down to just 69. It was tough, because a LOT of stuff was amazing. I would even venture to say this is the best month so far. I've listened to the whole playlist at least 10 times already and I'm hooked on about 40 tracks. Normally I could say I'm "hooked on" about 5 every month. The rest is great, but it's not getting worn out and placed in permanent rotation on my "very special mp3 player for stuff I love forever", or as I like to call it... my VSMPFSILF or Vasempfesilf.

No seriously.

See you next month.
