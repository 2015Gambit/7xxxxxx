All Music Guide - Matt Collar
Essentially an expanded version of Rhino's superb 2002 single-disc compilation The Very Best of Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons, Definitive Pop is an equally worthy two-disc collection bringing together all of Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons best-known songs as well as some lesser known cuts. This collection actually bests the previous version by including a few more excellent album tracks like "Silence Is Golden," "Marlena," and the group's excellent take on Maurice Williams & the Zodiacs' "Stay." Still, it's the hits most people are looking for and featured here are classics including "Sherry," "Big Girls Don't Cry" and "Dawn Go Away, " as well as such Valli solo cuts as "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" and "Grease." While there are adequate budget-oriented compilations available, listeners looking for a well-rounded anthology of the Four Seasons material needn't look any further than Definitive Pop.
