Advanced Windows Exploitation (AWE) is Offensive SecurityΓÇÖs most demanding Windows exploitation course, featuring a sophisticated hands-on lab environment geared towards challenging you and bringing out your best. The case studies covered include public vulnerabilities as well as vulnerabilities discovered by our research team, all of which cover a wide range of applications and exploitation techniques.

Making extensive use of hands-on material, AWE covers such advanced topics as DEP and ASLR evasion, precision heap spraying, function pointer overwrites, buffer space limitations, Windows driver exploits, and creating custom hand-made shellcode. You wonΓÇÖt just read about theory, but rather you will be creating exploits by hand for non-staged systems with real world applications. This is NOT an entry level course! Experience with a debugger, previous Windows exploits, and an intense tolerance for hard work is required.
