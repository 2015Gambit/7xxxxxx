The year is 1775. The American colonies are about to revolt. You are Connor, an
assassin who has sworn to secure liberty for his people and his nation. To do
so, you will hunt your enemies across a staggeringly large, open, and realistic
world. You will unleash your lethal skills in a violent quest that will take you
from chaotic city streets to blood-soaked battlefields in the hostile American
wilderness and beyond. You will meet legendary heroes of American history, and
together you will conspire to annihilate those who threaten Liberty itself.

Whether you use your predatory instincts to kill silently, or your fearsome
arsenal to kill openly, one thing is clear: the world that the Assassins live in
has become far more deadly. And so have you.
