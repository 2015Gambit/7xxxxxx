,User03,2012-11-21T02:21Z,"* Please Read if you are getting this error. *

""THERE SEEMS TO BE WITH YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION. PLEASE CHECK YOUR SETTINGS OR SWITCH TO OFFLINE MOD.""

This will happen to anyone who had previously installed AC games that were cracked. Here is a simple workaround.

* Do NOT start AC3 until all steps are completed. Make sure that the AC3.exe is blocked from the internet so that it does NOT update.

1. Make all Hidden Files & Folders viewable on your PC (google if you don't know how).

2. Locate a file called 'hosts'. This file is located in C:WindowsSystem32driversetc on windows 7 64bit.

3. Temporarily move the 'hosts' file to your  desktop. ****Do NOT delete or change this file in anyway unless you know what you are doing.****

4. You should now have no problem Creating an account or logging in to an existing account.

5. Now that you are logged in you can place the 'hosts' file back where it belongs.

6.Now that you are logged into uplay click on that 'settings' button. Make sure that the checkbox that says ""Start uplay in offline mode"" is checked.

7. Use any firewall to block AC3.exe and Uplay.exe from accessing the internet if you haven't already.

* You are now ready to play AC3!! Make sure you STAY IN OFFLINE MODE once you have passed uplay's little 'online check'. If uplay or the game connects to the internet in anyway you may be banned from uplay and your game may stop working."
,User03,2012-11-21T02:24Z,"*Small Note* 

Remember to BLOCK the 'Setup.exe' file when you are installing the game so that it cannot auto-update."
,ognjen12,2012-11-22T17:13Z,"IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH INSTALLATION,SEARCH ON YOUTUBE FOR ""ognjenosmancevic"".
FULL TUTORIAL ON INSTALL,IT WILL WORK PERFECTLY,NO GLITCHES!!!!!"
,dis_dat,2012-11-23T13:57Z,"Hello!

I lost my savefile earlier and I cannot get it back. I was at Sequence 9 when uplay.exe crashed and deleted my temporarly access to AC3.

So, if anyone out there is currently on sequence 9, or around 9, it'd be SO so so so awesome if you could send it too me so I dont have to do it ALL over again! >.< I'd appreciate it ALOT!
