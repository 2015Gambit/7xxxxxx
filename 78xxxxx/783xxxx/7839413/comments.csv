QQ SEED AMG I IZ NOT GET FREE THING FAST ENOUGH I IZ GO CRY. 
Seriously they need to just block all comments with the words Seed in them. If you can wait even a day to get something for free you need to fuck off. Most ppl do seed. Most ppl that bitch about seeding dont. Also why seed something that only took 30 mins to download. Wtf you want it instantly? Pay for it then. Games are about the only thing that take time. I havent seen a movie or tv show that took me longer then maybe 3 hours to get in over a year. In said year i have downloaded about 300 movies and shows. You guys really should learn how P2P works. It seeds by default unless you intentionally stop it you seed the whole time your downloading as well as when you finish. I usually seed movies and shows for maybe 30 mins after i finish downloading them. Games i might for a few days. Dont like it? Gtfo of my internets. And go buy the shit."
,obliveron,2012-11-19T07:49Z,"I should mention that most people are either too lazy or too stupid to cut their seeding completely off. People like Newport are like myself, we have been doing this shit for more than a couple years and are sick of reading though 18 pages of ppl bitching about SEEDS. Comments are for informative purposes. Not to cry on because you had to wait a hour to watch your pokemon episode you missed on cartoon network."
,zork219,2012-11-19T07:57Z,"righteousaurus, you can punish people who don't want to seed only if tracker is counting UL/DL ratio, and it is technicaly impossible on trackers as big as TPB."

,sad-sam,2012-11-19T14:55Z,"spoiler alert: a whole lot of nothing happens, again"
,skornzbolt23,2012-11-19T15:08Z,"I'll seed for a few hours. 48 thousand seeders, maybe it's not the seeding, maybe it's your slow ghetto internet. It finished for me in 3 minutes."
,kdryan2,2012-11-19T15:14Z,Half of the people here bitching about others not seeding don't seed themselves...
,mm_0111,2012-11-19T15:33Z,Thank you for sharing ettv!!! 
,HKCannibal,2012-11-19T15:45Z,Thanks ettv!!!!
,redhare,2012-11-19T16:10Z,Thanks. Much appreciated. Cannot understand all the bitchin and moanin and totally useless complaining which certainly will never inspire anyone to continue to share your downloads. Many people simply have 10X as much download bandwidth as upload bandwidth. I find ur torrents download like greased lightning with zillions of community minded people seeding. Thanks again.
,assortedkandy,2012-11-19T16:44Z,"Every damn week you people complain about seed..just wait the next fking day....

at the moment..SHUT IT!!!"
,Sargroth,2012-11-19T16:47Z,"Thanks a bunch ettv!!
Always fast and good quality torrents!"
,redhare,2012-11-19T19:22Z,"imho, a 43 minute download is quite OK when I have half a dozen other downloads going at the same time. Tnx."
,Folgers,2012-11-19T20:20Z,Thank You.
,rockodss,2012-11-19T20:25Z,1min 43 sec to download. I don't get the kids crying about seed? learn to use a computer? start working to pay a better internet?
,pberry,2012-11-19T22:46Z,"To the people that bitch about seeding:
Get a better Internet plan, took me few minutes to download Dexter, and TWD at the same time."
,CrazyMoskito75,2012-11-19T23:03Z,"Download speed at 2,1 Mbs Thanks ETTV"
,paulphonix784,2012-11-20T09:04Z,as Marjorie responded I didnt know that a stay at home mom able to get paid $9449 in four weeks on the computer. did you read this web link
,Skyseed,2012-11-21T02:41Z,"This show sucks, I'm done.  Season 1 was good, 2 was alright, 3 is just plain retarded.

,vampzcore,2012-11-22T07:27Z,thanks!!
,nazgull2k10,2012-11-23T01:50Z,"Ok yeah.. this show is getting about retarded now.  The whole ""omg Im getting phone calls from heaven!"" nonsense wasnt bad enough.. they add insult to injury by acting like nobody would have shot merl the second he walked toward them.. much less let him step-walk like 10 paces without either of them pulling the trigger.

,kaosturtle,2012-11-30T03:22Z,"How about all of you who are complaining about the episode just stop watching and shut your traps. Especially when you are talking about the plot, if people are on this page its because they haven't watched it yet so shut it. Also thanks Ettv"
