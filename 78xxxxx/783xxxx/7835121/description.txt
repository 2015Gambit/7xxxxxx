The film opens with a wedding procession         
followed by the ritual sacrifice of a sheep      
and invocation to God. A teenage bride, Yesu     
has been married to the mentally retarded son    
of a lecherous old man. On the night of the      
wedding, the father-in-law tries to rape Yesu    
and in the ensuing scuffle he is killed. A       
frightened Yesu runs away and hides in an        
abandoned warehouse. The very next day a new     
warehouse keeper Edekar and his attendant        
Dharma, take charge of the warehouse. Yesu is    
discovered hiding behind some old bags of wheat. 
They feed her and let her stay for the night,    
but Edekar is afraid of giving refuge to the     
girl. As time passes, Dharma becomes friendly    
with her and develops a protective attitude.     
His head office decides to send truckloads of    
food grain to the warehouse. Edekar is scared    
of the girl being found out. He starts drinking  
heavily and losing his sanity. Finally, in a fit 
of drunken fury, he asks Yesu to leave immediately
Back to his room he suffers from hallucinations  
about Yesu and the impending arrival of trucks.
