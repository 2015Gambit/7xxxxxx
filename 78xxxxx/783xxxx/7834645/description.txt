Black Dog Salvage is one of the premier architectural salvage operations on the East Coast. When it comes to tearing things apart to find treasures and selling them off to make a profit, they have done it all. The salvaged materials go in a dazzling number of directions, from being re-incorporated into old houses to being built into one-of-a-kind art pieces. Whether it's gutting a hoarder's home or disassembling a crumbling school, every day is a challenge and every day is an opportunity to either capitalize or mess up. (Source: DIY Network)
