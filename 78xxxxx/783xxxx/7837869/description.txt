Just another low grade western made during the times found on another one of those 15 movies for $3.99 dvd's so not much of a story or quality so samples included before you waste all your bandwidth
Just remember whats one persons garbage maybe another persons gem

I live here in south Texas when this movie was being made/filmed. What a waste of time, cast and story. The whole enchilada was just REALLY, REALLY BAD. This has to be the worst movie ever made here in the RIO GRANDE VALLEY.The story line was very confusing why this woman came to the valley. She should of just stayed home and not come here. At least this terrible movie would of never been made. The sets were very cheaply constructed. The scenes were shot anywhere their cameras were allowed. Not many people here in the valley cared to go see this movie, everyone thought this was just a very bad joke. They could not find enough local people to play some the roles, so they hired some newscasters from the local television stations. At least they had "some show biz" background!! This movie reminds me of school kids doing a movie as a class project.
