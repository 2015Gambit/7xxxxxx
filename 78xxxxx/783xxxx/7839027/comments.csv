[V],3Li,2012-11-19T05:36Z,"thanks.
don't encode Santa Clause."
,viveksaks,2012-11-19T05:52Z,"Hi 3li Dude,

I am big fan of your uploads. I simply download without even checking, because i have so much confidence on you quality.  Most of your uploads are 720p. I am eagerly looking for 1080p. I dont have the same confidence on other uploaders. Request you to upload 1080p movies too..Pls pls....."
,karimbaraka,2012-11-19T06:22Z,Thanks
,.Leto.,2012-11-19T07:41Z,"Thanks, really great quality. I compared this one to other releases, picture definition is better here, details are more clearly visible. Great job as usual."
,akash946,2012-11-19T19:30Z,"Dude You're The Best Uploader On Here. And Your Torrents Are Simply Out Of This World. I Know You Don't Do Requests. But I'd Just Like To Know When You'll Be Uploading The Dark Knight Rises On BluRay. I Missed The Movie In Cinemas and i'm gonna wait for your upload. Thanks Again Mate Cheers

Ps. A-10/V-10"
,Sifu73,2012-11-20T08:34Z,Yet another Grainy Post of the movie!  From what I saw not to the extremes as the other posts but grainy nonetheless!!!
,BLUNKNUCKLE,2012-11-20T20:20Z,awesum....eagerly waitin for your Batman The Dark Knight Rises print!!! hurry bro
,.Leto.,2012-11-21T01:19Z,"@Sifu73: read the BR reviews, that's what the original BluRay looks like, grainy and blurry. Nothing the encoder can do about it."
,viveksaks,2012-11-21T16:11Z,"3li dude,

Pls upload 1080p version for the same.  I dont trust any other uploaders on the quality. Pls consider my request...."
[V],3Li,2012-11-25T06:56Z,"sorry man.
I don't make 1080p for this one."
,FictionRyu,2012-11-25T07:48Z,Anyone know if this is that Russian copy of the movie? I've seen that most of the top seeded copies of this movie are ripped from the Russian blu-ray and I'd like to know if this is one of them before I download it.
[V],3Li,2012-11-25T08:13Z,"KRaLiMaRKo was made a remux from HDChina source,
so this isn't russian edition"
