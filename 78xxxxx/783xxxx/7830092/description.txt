Wayne LauderMilk

born in Ohio, globetrotter, adventurer,

author and singer, came during the height of the hippie time to the Netherlands,

eventually ending up in Leiden.

Songs from the heart and from the life that has been lived,

sung in a voice both through the smoke and the noise of a pub can cut,

or your heart can break.

Most of the songs come from the pen of Wayne, the rest are written by Len de Vries,

that the harmonies and some guitar solos accounts for.

The Australian-born Len knew Wayne jam session in Leiden

and found the Hillbilly songs from Wayne Hemmingway too good to be in the wind to blow away.

The CD was a band formed consisting of the best Netherlands

of acoustic musicians to offer.

Assisted by the brilliant instrumentalist Kevin Lynch,

with almost everyone from the American acoustic 'music scene'

has played on mandolin and guitar.

Jeroen Schmohl, undoubtedly the most creative dobro player from the Netherlands,

supplemented by Beppie Pasman, on her upright bass control performs.
