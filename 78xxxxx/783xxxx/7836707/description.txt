Mastered by Bob Ludwig. 2002 ABKCO Hybrid SACD converted from DSD to 24bit 88.2kHz.

From the Liner Notes:

We spent hundreds of hours researching, and more importantly, listening to the analog masters that exist in the vaults. It was a long and painstaking process, involving a quest on both sides of the Atlantic to find the best and purest sources of The Rolling Stones work. You will hear the rawness of the guitars, the vocal quality and the natural distortion of the band as it sounded in the studio.
