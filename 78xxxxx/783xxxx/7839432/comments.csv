,Conchaga,2012-11-19T18:35Z,"I use the IMdB seasons listing to track torrents. American Dad! is in season 9 according to them.  Wikipedia has it listed as season 8.  Truthfully, this IS season nine if you do the work.  Why the FUCK do you uploaders keep naming it season 8?  Stop that! Otherwise, keep up the great work.  eztv and ettv are heroes amongst men."

Thanks extv! "
