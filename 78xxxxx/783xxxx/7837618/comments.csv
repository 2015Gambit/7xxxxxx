,anacondon,2012-11-19T03:50Z,"Thank you, sincerely.  The most recent Mojo magazine has an excellent article re: this release, including interviews with all (to include jason bonham).  Can't wait to see proper vid (vs the awful quality bootleg).  The article mentioned 'bonus' disc/feature of their full rehearsal days prior at Shepperton Studios soundstage-does this contain that footage as well?  Many thanks. Been jammin to the great audio release the last few days."
