,vsekoselo,2012-11-20T17:02Z,thank you for the described information @jamrpyz
,uselesstit,2012-11-22T07:44Z,"Works good. Installation was slightly confusing as you had to guess what the buttons were like ""next"" and ""install"" etc as it was in russian but easy enough if you guess. Top comment is important. Crack file is in first iso, i spent a few mins searching before i remembered that comment. Upon seeing the cd serial number just leave it blank and hit next. Rest of the install info is bang on. Game works great"

everything went ok but it still asks for a cd key"
,huliyo993,2012-11-28T14:55Z,i even tried skidrow's crack and still it doesn't run the game 
,maxtender,2012-11-30T03:55Z,It worked fine until a uplay update happened. It has stopped working from then. Please help.
