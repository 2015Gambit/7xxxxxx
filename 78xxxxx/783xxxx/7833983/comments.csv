,term421,2012-11-17T10:44Z,"sup. the problem is I'm sure that like with the soup 'the scene' has seemed to abandon those of us who are reliant on others to see this shit. I haven't had cable television in close to a decade myself so when I discover that yet another of the programs I watch is no longer capped or capped timely a part of me dies inside. while I appreciate your capping overtime, it's available for free already on HBO's site so the only reason I might download it is to avoid the site's shitty programing. "
,netaddikt,2012-11-17T10:51Z,i agree entirely with term421. this shit kills me. 
,Joohnnyboy87,2012-11-17T10:52Z,@term421 Don't you need HBOGO to see this program on HOB's site? i tried and it said i needed a HBO GO account. please let me know what method you used to see it for free on their site.
,Joohnnyboy87,2012-11-17T10:54Z,"Nvm i see you are talking about overtime, i agree you don't need to upload overtime. its a waste of time."
,xenoFLASH,2012-11-17T10:59Z,Thank you!
,xenoFLASH,2012-11-17T11:00Z,"Also, NOT a waste of time."
,John777Berry,2012-11-17T11:01Z,call me curious but ... what's stopping you from sharing the actual show....?

[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-17T11:12Z,"Welcome to where the ranters are welcome.
Welcome to where the disgruntled get regruntled.

For my weekly bashers - there are currently over 500 who want this, so I provide it.
What kind want to deprive others, just so their own view is sunny all day?

I wouldn't go hard on 2HD, I mean I like a good conspiracy MORE than the next
guy - but I just think 2HD has a life, goes out on Friday night and then fires
up the computer Saturday morn. Thank Heaven for the anonymous MKV mini guy.

Well, this is the last show of the series - last time to get your licks in.

To the best of my knowledge, in the whole of our community, there are only 2 (two)
people who cap shows and are NOT part of ""The Scene"". The anonymous guy
mentioned above and KarMa.

,phuckstic,2012-11-17T11:22Z,Overtime only lol....way to waste your time....plus 125 megs for OT means you don't know what the fuck you are doing...completely useless torrent...fuckstick
,SwingingDead69,2012-11-17T11:22Z,Thanks... but no thanks. thank god for TvTeam.
,Joohnnyboy87,2012-11-17T11:52Z,"It's cause your down loaders are to fucking retarded to know that the time it took them to download this, they could have already watched overtime on HBO's website (7:24 this week) and still have time to take a shit and jerk off. It's just people get all antsy cause we keep clicking that refresh button and when we see ""uploaded X mins ago"" we get all excited only to see its overtime. Not your fault but if there is a demand for it i guess there is a demand for it."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-17T12:48Z,"Gosh, season's over and this is the last time for these fun and games.

First, Joohnnyboy87: You don't need that for OT, just to watch the show itself.

Second, John777Berry: Different sources, different times. As soon as the show shows up, I create the mini for that too. And since it took this long to compose this comment - you'll notice I've just indexed the FullShow Mini.

Third, phuckstic: this is 100% HBO quality. That's 124MB, their choice, not mine.

Fourth, SwingingDead69: TvTeam are a distribution network - you need to thank 2HD, the capper that TvTeam brings to you.

So, now to the fun part. It seems the RoyalRantClub is down to the following four members. I still say that as long as the vote is a thousand for and 4 against, I'm gonna keep doing it. Thanks for playing.

But now the fun has ended and I'm thinking hard about posting ""This Week"" with George snuffleupagus, just to keep this fun discussion going.

Mebbe not ...

,rcoldks,2012-11-17T12:57Z,"Thank you for the downloadable Overtime! Hope this continues next season, unlike the whiners here some of us appreciate it."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-17T13:46Z,"Here's what I find amusing.

People who come here and spew vitriol and use words like ""retarded"" and ""fuckstick""
and really have no clue how clearly they identify themselves. That the several of you
have no interest in what I do, and you think you're some sort of authority on what
other people should or should not be interested in. Here's a hint - if you lack basic
vocabulary, your opinion is probably suspect.

It's real easy:

Step 1 - learn to read
Step 2 - see ""OTonly"" and say ""no thanks""
Step 3 - go do something meaningful for yourself
 - because if this is what brings you meaning ... well, I'm not quite that rude.

Besides, like the downloaded show, people like to keep a copy on their HDD.

A thousand of them do and like it so much they create accounts just to thank me.

AVIGUY

p.s. - yes, I'll keep doing this as long as I'm able - poking sticks at the bears is just an added bonus."
,muckymucks,2012-11-17T14:51Z,I rather download an episode AND overtime in one place. Please continue uploading both if you can. And thank you!
,Jazzdancer,2012-11-17T15:49Z,MP4SUX  - Thank you for taking the time to do these OT's and for not letting the haters here with apparently nothing better going on in their lives  then trying to control what anonymous strangers do on-line. What a waste of time that is.  But good on you MP4 for caring more about the 500 plus of us that want and appreciate this convenience each week.

,grunch666,2012-11-17T19:10Z,I like how your sn is MP4SUX and you upload an mp4 file.
,Xyzer0,2012-11-17T19:14Z,"For those ungrateful leechers who have never taken a moment to encode and upload anything in their tiny lives but who are so quick to cry and complain about the torrents they suck up and are so worthless they have to post hateful comments on one of the few public trackers left, well, grow up and go fuck yourselves. You aren't just leeches, you're hideous parasites. You're probably such pathetic basement-dwelling freaks you won't even be sorry when the last public tracker is taken down for good. Learn how to say thanks without spouting a lot of acrimonious venom."
,DrChiron,2012-11-17T23:41Z,"It is often hard to remember which of the many uploaders I need to thank for their selfless work, so i feel that when their are only a few providing something I watch regularlt that I now feel compelled to say THANK YOU, THANK YOUm THANK YOU. It doesn't hurt that I managed to remember on the occasion of the last show of the season. ;^)"
,Joohnnyboy87,2012-11-18T02:53Z,"""First, Joohnnyboy87: You don't need that for OT, just to watch the show itself."" IDK WTF you are talking about I'm assuming English isn't your first language."
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-18T03:16Z,"Jazzdancer:

Yes, the vote being something like 600 for, 4 against, the answer is obvious.

grunch666:

Yes, the irony is not lost on me. This is only my second MP4 and in my comments the previous week I expressed a desire for a shower after having done this.

But the original is an FLV container containing x264/AAC. For the longest time I'd take this file an additional step using my CC2AVI technique (x264/MP3 in an AVI container), but I finally decided to get off my high horse and give people the version they'd probably prefer.

Offering a Mini of this and the actual show (when it show up) is my only consolation.

==========

As long as people line up to download what I produce, I'll keep producing it. That there is this extremely vocal minority suggests something else going on - maybe they are actual HBO bigwigs who don't like me making their product available in an easier format?

But there is this strange small crowd in the world. Like with crop circles - 3 % believe, 96% disbelieve and then there's the 1% that need to prove it all false solely by derision. I am fascinated by voracious detractors with less facts on their side than what they are detracting from.

As an alien hiding in my secret base on the far side of the moon, your species is truly fascinating.

AVIGUY

p.s. - and thanx to all the supportive commenters - I cherish every one who takes the time to appreciate what I do. That you line up to download is the true measure, but going this extra step is wonderful."
,Jazzdancer,2012-11-18T17:54Z,Nicely said AVIGUY!
