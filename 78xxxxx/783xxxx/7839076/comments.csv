,.Leto.,2012-11-19T06:45Z,"lol, yes, donde esta los ingles versionamos????
The race ended 9 hours ago and the torrent isn't available anywhere!! Hosting a F1 race in the usa really is a stupid idea. We have to wait forever to see it. Plus once it's uploaded it's going to take several hours before we can download it at 100%."
,.Leto.,2012-11-19T07:25Z,"OMG, I just found out that the race in English is already available elsewhere. Go to torrentz*eu and search for formula 1, you'll find the torrent for the race in English. No idea why it isn't posted here yet."

They shouldnt host F1 races in the USA because ppl cant download them asap?`

You should make a formal complaint to Bernie at FIA.
