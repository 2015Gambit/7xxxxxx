Video_____: x264 CABAC L3.1 832x468 25fps bitdepth=10 chroma=4:2:0 CRF 25
Audio_____: HE-AAC 96Kbps ABR 2 channels 48KHz +10dB

CRF 25 (10bit) is roughly equivalent to CRF 23 (8bit).
The SD source is 544x576i with 16 pixel horizontal cropping giving a useable encode width of 528. W-Zoom is therefore 832/528 or about 157%.
Cropping is also applied vertically to keep the aspect error less than 0.2%
The SD source filesizes are: 1.54GB and 1.18GB.

To play Hi10p you'll need to use a modern software player. It won't play with any hardware player or GPU assisted player because the video chipsets only support consumer level AVC spec, i.e. bitdepth=8bits and chroma=4:2:0. Hi422p and Hi444p are better but they take longer to encode. The idea is to use the lowest quantizer but keep the bitrate below 1500Kbps.

Hi10p doesn't make the picture quality any better - it just preserves as much information as possible from the mpeg2 source.
For better picture quality HD source must be used.
Here's some 10bit software players: MPC-HC, VLC v2.x.x, XMBC v12, [S]MPlayer[X].
CPU usage is higher during playback of 10bit depth video.
