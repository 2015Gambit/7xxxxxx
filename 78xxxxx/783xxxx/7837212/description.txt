Diagraming Sentences will help students of all ages learn how the parts of speech fit together to make clear and complete sentences. This 48-page book shows visual learners how to diagram sentences to help them understand why some sentences may not sound or look right. The book also includes fun practice activities, review activities, a glossary, and answer keys.


I needed some basic diagramming exercises for a class I teach, and this fit the bill. I have scanned the entire book with color photos and converted them to a PDF document. This should clarify this lost skill for any novice, and is a good set of worksheets for kids in grades 4-8.
