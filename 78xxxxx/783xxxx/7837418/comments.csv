A big bonus is that the key is free until Jan13-2013 I think.  When you enter the free key that microsoft mails you during setup, it simply finishes the install and barring internet problems, will be permanently activated.

I highly recommend downloading the latest Activation Tokens Manager from Josh Cell Softwares.  You can backup the permanent activation from this and it saves it into a subdirectory.  I recommend saving both the tokens manager and the backup folder if you go from older to newer versions."
,piratemanager,2012-11-18T12:45Z,DEAR uploader. Can you help activate? As the phone method is no longer working in China. MANY THANKS.

log in with a microsoft account.  Solve the caption and enter a target email address.  Wait for the email to arrive.  Enter the key they send you.  Voila! Activated."

,murphy78,2012-11-19T10:32Z,"There's nothing wrong with the windows loader 2.1.7 I put in my win7.  The problem is with the crappy virus lists in win8 and newer torrent programs with builtin virus protection.  They falsely claim that the loader, which is a hacktool, is a virus.  A virus is a bit of code that copies itself to other programs, but these things just call all programs that they don't like, a virus.

It's just not worth the hassle.  The program has been out for 4 months.  If people don't have it on a spare flash drive, hard drive, or backup dvd/cd somewhere by now; it's gonna have to be their problem.  I was proud of the way I recently integrated it using the oem folder setupcomplete script instead of an unattended script, but the fallout from people falsely claiming infection isn't worth it; hence the kat ph ban.  You guys all have my permission to upload my stuff anywhere you feel like, just don't be a T.F.K and claim it was your work and that it's a retail disc when it's not."
