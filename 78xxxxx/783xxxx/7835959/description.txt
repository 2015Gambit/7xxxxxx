Led Zeppelin were an English rock band active in the late 1960s and throughout the
1970s. Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, the band consisted of guitarist Jimmy
Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John
Bonham. They are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative
and influential rock groups in history.

Celebration Day is a concert film by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, recorded
on 10 December 2007, at London's O2 Arena. Prior to being released on several home
video formats on 19 November 2012, the film was shown in theatres on 17 October.
Both the performance, captured at the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, and the film
have been widely praised.
