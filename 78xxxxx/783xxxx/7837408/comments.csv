A big bonus is that the key is free until Jan13-2013 I think.  When you enter the free key that microsoft mails you during setup, it simply finishes the install and barring internet problems, will be permanently activated.

I highly recommend downloading the latest Activation Tokens Manager from Josh Cell Softwares.  You can backup the permanent activation from this and it saves it into a subdirectory.  I recommend saving both the tokens manager and the backup folder if you go from older to newer versions."

,clkgtr2,2012-11-19T00:58Z,"I rather download a copy of windows with a matching checksum with ISO's on windows server. God knows what these guys must have altered on these ISO's. Not to take anything away from the uploader, but there's no point in downloading a torrent with updates included (especially if u can download a 4Gb torrent)..just download them over windows  update. And u can get it activated with any key available online(fresh ones popup every day) and use Media center key to activate it permanently."
,murphy78,2012-11-19T02:41Z,"The point of this torrent is to activate directly using the free key microsoft sends you.  There's no need to go through pro and mess with activators or anything.  I list the tools I use so you don't think I did some substandard work. Imagex, dism, and oscdimg are microsoft programs, specifically designed for this kind of integration."
,steve97,2012-11-19T04:28Z,"Dear murphy78, can you please clarify this for me?
can I use the same key sent by Microsoft after January in case if I have to format the PC?"
,murphy78,2012-11-19T05:13Z,"I don't know steve97, it's not January yet.  I'm just going by what the microsoft page says.  You are not limited to one activation of this.  From what I have read, you can get like 5 in a certain amount of time.  I think its either 5 per week or 5 per month.  I'm really not sure.  I really would recommend getting that Josh Cell Softwares advanced tokens manager program that saves your legit activations.

,shukree,2012-11-19T05:53Z,"Hi murphy78

thanks for your great works.
they are the best.
i have a question.
why using imagex?
while dism can do all imagex and more?

thanks again."
,murphy78,2012-11-19T08:10Z,"good question.  Honestly the only reason is that the commands are much shorter to type.  I am also not as familiar with every single option in dism.  I have experimented with a renaming script for the prowmc change, but I could only figure out how to rename the title and not the description.  I'm sure there are wizards out there that could explain every single dism argument.  I'm pretty good, but I don't know everything :)"
,jhoneyeng,2012-11-19T09:18Z,"i downloade..ur 16in1 win8 file...but that is in en-uk language....plz uplaod a 64bit legit win8 en-us..wit dot net3,5..and all the updates...after few month..and plz dont ulter in system files...coz i faced some errors in that version.. such as werfault.errror."
,murphy78,2012-11-19T10:24Z,"I don't have a 16 in 1.  I did make an 18 in 1, but it is not UK, it's in US.  I will make a newer version when I'm done with all my language releases.  I will incorporate these newer versions of prowmc that you can install using the free upgrade keys."
,libertycity,2012-11-19T10:51Z,"I prefer ""untouched"" versions, this one with updates and so many tweaks is very unstable..."

,steve97,2012-11-19T11:11Z,"Thanks murphy78 for your quick reply.
Just one thing more I can do a clean installation using the media center key right?

Thanks again.
Really appreciate your good work =)"
,rajesh1215,2012-11-19T11:44Z,"murphy78, thanks for great upload.
Before I download this I have one question, if this is not activated through media center key, will we be able to use it as just win 8 pro? or may be use some other activator and make it win 8 pro? or is it only for media center?"
,jhoneyeng,2012-11-19T12:15Z,oh...yeah..sory..thats 4m thumperDc......ok i will download ur file..plz make..a good 64 bit legit with all updates..and windows feature pack included.will also good...thanks 4 reply
,libertycity,2012-11-19T18:24Z,"@jhoneyeng, are you faulty or have no-arms or something because you can't download the updates yourself? or why? untouched windows is better, this version is unstable...

Hope murphy78 be smart and the next upload will be the ORIGINAL version with only necessary tweaks for wmc key activation, most untouched as it can..."
,tonarpos,2012-11-19T22:08Z,"libertycity, if you want an untouched version put your hand in your pocket and buy it. Nobody gives a rats ass about what you do or do not prefer, if you don't like it don't download it = simple."
,libertycity,2012-11-19T23:17Z,"@tonarpos, is not about ""like"" or ""dislike"", is about stability, but all people who want all these updates and crap includes are just noobs and have no idea what you talking about, so gtfo.

I could say the same for you, if you want a lot of crap include in your windows buy it and add the crap-soft by yourself, or if you don't wanna buy it go here 
http://forums.mydigitallife.info/forums/42-Windows-8
and tweak and add all crap you want by yourself."
,tonarpos,2012-11-20T00:59Z,"libertycity, have you seen the work murphy78 has produced over the last few months or read any of the positive feedback, you probably don't even know how to download and test anything. If you do decide to try any of his windows 8 torrents here is an activation key for you : FUCK-YOUR-SELF-DICK-HEAD."
,liquid_awesomeness,2012-11-20T03:18Z,"this shit is genius, dude. thanks."
,Maelfactor,2012-11-20T04:29Z,"There are at least 300 people on this torrent and I can't get one to connect, while my other torrents are all working fabulously. I let it run for an hour and it still hadn't even pulled the torrent info into the client, less long downloaded any of it. Sadface."
,Maelfactor,2012-11-20T05:20Z,"Kicked my active connections up to 90, finally started working. Good times on the 'net."
,libertycity,2012-11-20T09:26Z,"@tonarpos, nice argument, you definitely has convinced me with your words, cmon, how old are you? 12yo?"
,murphy78,2012-11-20T11:05Z,"I don't do tweaks.  If you want registry settings changed or weird scripts added, you can find that elsewhere.  If you aren't willing to give a program a try, that's fine.  Nobody will try to make you.  You are all entitled to your opinions.

I, for one, know a sweet deal when I see one.  And, a free windows 8 key directly from MS for the tradeoff of one small data.dat file is one sweet deal.  You're more than welcome to pay for it if you want, or use some activator instead of switching one small data.dat file.  For me, it's a no-brainer.

Anyhow, I did spot the first ever retailish iso the other day that uses an install.esd file instead of install.wim file.  Think the guy's name was john6425 or something.  Basically it's the same end result, only the esd file is intelligently compressed as opposed to sequentially compressed.  If you really want a retail iso, go check it out.  There's absolutely no difference in the files installed or the eula, but it's definately not RTM.

compliments of murphyseventyeight@hotmail.com :P"
,libertycity,2012-11-20T15:43Z,"murphy78, Thanks a lot for response, so you just added the data.dat file? thats nice, but what about all these KB packages?"
,rajesh1215,2012-11-20T18:15Z,murphy78. can this be activated with other activators may be just pro if not mc
,murphy78,2012-11-21T01:49Z,"kb files added are added by mounting the install.wim file to a directory.  Then you run a dism add-package command with a packagepath command pointing to the directory with all the msu files.  Once everything is all integrated you unmount with a commit command.  Dism is precisely designed for hotfix integration and has been a part of windows since windows 7 first came out I believe.  Before that you had custom programs like vlite for vista or ryanvm integrator for xp.

The advantage of integrating the kb files in the install.wim is that they integrate in a way that barely increases your install time at all, maybe a few seconds.  There are actually 2 packages integrated by default.  The en-us for english language, and the default windows 8 package with all the system files.

Unfortunately, with the only retail image I've seen being in a different format other than wim, the only way to integrate updates into something like that would be to run the first phase of install from boot, boot from a boot disk, copy all the files to another folder, finish installation, then recapture the copied folder as a wim.  That stuff is just too shady to me, and there's too much that can go wrong, so I will never do that."

,acarlos,2012-11-22T00:25Z,"Dear Murphi78,

Is it possible to pass PTBR applying the language pack after activation? Works? Thank you"
,rajesh1215,2012-11-22T12:05Z,"murphy78 thanks for the reply. 
I had got that part. my confusion is that if I do not want the media center upgrade can this be installed as win 8 pro version with proper pro key or activator? "
,rajesh1215,2012-11-22T12:06Z,or are you going to upload another version which only consist of win 8 pro 64 bit version? 
,murphy78,2012-11-22T13:01Z,"rajesh, it's not an invasive app.  In fact, every pro version contains the files for Pro WMC.  It simply is not turned on without a wmc upgrade key.

This behaves the same as Pro because it IS pro."
,rajesh1215,2012-11-22T13:20Z,pardon my ignorance. thanks for your reply and great work.
,rishiv,2012-11-22T19:03Z,"I have question or two. So to get this straight if I was to choose an upgrade provided KEY by MS in the setup it will go through and will activate? What if the key has been used before can it be re activated?

Also what if I had Pro version and then activated WMC using key from MS..made an activation backup using Josh Cells Software..can i restore activation if i was to re image machine? Do i put in the upgrade key at time of install or just install without key and do an activation restore? Advise pls. 

PS: Thanx a ton for great torrent."
,murphy78,2012-11-23T10:45Z,"rishiv, yes the data.dat file replaced removes the requirement for having first activated normal pro.

As far as the tokens manager, for which the current version as of just checking right now is 3.5 RC2.  I don't know the differences he started using but I know from going from 3.5 beta 3 to beta 7, it would not port between them.  However, if you saved both the executable and the backup folder for each version, you can restore them with the programs that created them.

As far as different machines, I'm not really sure what you can and cannot replace to restore the activation.  I could NOT, for example, take my backup and try to use it on a different computer.  I don't know exactly how it calculates the machine part, but I imagine it's probably something to do with your motherboard or mac address.

The good news:  You can re-activate your free key many times.  I'm not sure exactly how they calculate it and I really don't want to push my luck, but I've heard that it can go from 5 times per day to 5 times per month. This is just speculation, but I have personally re-activated a same key 3 times.  I'm not going to go out of my way to blacklist my own key."
,flashfv,2012-11-23T19:03Z,This works great with the free key from microsoft.

,DS1796,2012-11-25T13:24Z,"murphy78 i have a question. i am a total noob at this so please bear with me. Once i download this file, what should i do then? do i use the microsoft windows usb tool to make a bootable usb drive and then while installing, input the WMC key that microsoft sent me? Will that activate me copy? or do i need to something else?
Again sorry if this is a stupid question. Appreciate any help."
,thewp7man,2012-11-27T00:20Z,"Hey, thanks for the upload.. I want to know if it's possible to enter the WMC key I got from Microsoft after Windows has been installed."
,murphy78,2012-11-27T22:32Z,"thewp7man yes, you can enter it at any time from the activation page winkey+c for charm bar, settings, pc info.  Just look for a change my key button or something.  It defaults to an un-activatable generic key if you don't enter one.

If you forget, windows will remind you 1000x"
,murphy78,2012-11-27T22:36Z,"ds1796, you can just right click it and burn to an iso, or you can use a usb tool like microsoft's windows 7 usb dvd tool.  Joshcellsoftwares also has a usb tool, tho I haven't tested it.

And yes, once you have the emailed free key that microsoft gives you, that's all you need.  Enter that during setup or after from the pc info page and Viola! Permanent Legit Activation with no shady activators or hacks to deal with."
