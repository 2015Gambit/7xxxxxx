|Noticed creative3 dropping a custom win8prowmc where you could use an     |
|upgrade key from the free offer to get legit activation without first     |
|installing pro.  He mentioned data.dat and since I didn't feel like       |
|robbing him of his work I did my own research on the matter and found a   |
|link to said data.dat on the mydigitallife forum.  I figured I'd do a bit |
|different than him by adding the net 2-3.5 and modifying the upgradematrix|
|to allow 'keep nothing' should people prefer on upgrading from xp or      |
|win7. I added an ei.cfg to change channel to retail and set the EID to    |
|ProfessionalWMC.  The result is not needing a key to install, but if you  |
|do enter one on the last boot, it will Permanently legit activate. You    |
|will NOT be able to activate this without a legit media pack key.         |
