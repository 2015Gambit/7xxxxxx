The three Bondurant brothers run a bootlegging operation during the depression, up in the mountains of Franklin County, Virginia. Crooked Special Deputy Charles Rakes is after a share of the brothers profits. Compounding their troubles, the local competition is elbowing in on their activities. Forrests boisterous defiance and Crickets knack for moonshine production help the brothers gain a local monopoly. When Forrest is wounded as tension with Rakes escalates, Jack, initially the timid one, must prove his worth against gangster Floyd Banners mob, and we see him metamorphose into a cocky exhibitionist in his attempts to woo the off-limits preachers daughter, Bertha.

Encoder Notes:
Encoded with 755kbps DTS audio, which is the best audio for a small file size (comparable to a 5 gig file) Which is perfect for surround sound. I am looking for a seedbox, even if it is only for 24 hours :)
