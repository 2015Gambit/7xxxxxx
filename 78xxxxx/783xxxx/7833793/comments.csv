The biggest flaw of this release is that this emulator shares the same settings for all games, and if you install and launch, for example, Silent Hill 1, it will totally screw up your Resident Evil settings. :) I think it will run too fast, or there will be graphics corruption - I don't remember.
That's why I made my game import proper settings into the registry each time before it starts up.

The next thing is that they could have improved graphics more. I managed to. But its not that important."
