NOTES:


Video - Ok this time round we were given some 1080p files ...it looks dam close to the ilg source,but there is some movement
in the video that doesn't happen on their release and vice versa ...so got to be different source.
Anyway ...video was ok,but have issues with glare,noise and the worse ...colour issues.Just like the ilg one the video seems
to change colour so somtimes its bang on the money other times off arghhhhh.

Audio - Like before on last release we have used jiinx line ....little noise/hiss but otherwise nice stuff.


WORKDONE:

Well first off i cropped some borders,theres still two places i think where you get some for a short space of time.After that
i resized to 720p and then used a HQ smoother.
From there i tweaked the colours,contrast,brightness,sharpness etc....
Will be honest and say some parts its a tad dark due to dulling the glares,and also the colouring does change :(,sometimes a touch 
to green and other times a little blue,than again other times DAM nice lol ...oh well.

Audio had to be resyncd to this video,and the cleaning i had already done before so :P:P

Is it better than the last release?? yes and no ,due to issues with both its an hard call...but don't go by screens etc....view on the
tv then decide,that way you get the REAL picture Q.

Enjoy folks :)
