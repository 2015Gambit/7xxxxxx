,mightymax29,2012-11-20T18:08Z,Anyone else got no sound while playing the game? HOw do we fix that?
,lotster,2012-11-21T06:18Z,"@mightymax29, that's a common BioShock problem.  Try running the executable in Windows XP SP2 Compatibility mode."
,Omar_20001,2012-11-21T14:52Z,"sEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEd please !! 
"
,Omar_20001,2012-11-21T14:55Z,"Seed damn it !! 

I'm stuck at 99.5 % !!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
,mightymax29,2012-11-21T20:20Z,@lotster Thank you Torrent works 100 %    Running the executable in Windows XP SP2 Compatibility mode solved the sound problem. 
,Kyle2k5,2012-11-27T14:20Z,"Guys, detected a Windows 8 PRO issue. This portable version of Bioshock - even with the ""Sounds_Windows"" fixed files - runs only once. When I try to load the game a second time, it crashes for good. Compatibility modes did not work. Any clues? Thanks, anyway."
,lotster,2012-11-27T17:29Z,"@Kyle2k5, I'm also running it in Windows 8 Pro, x64, no problems here.  Anybody else experiencing this problem?"
,gigas232,2012-11-30T23:01Z,"Hm. Bioshock will start up, but the screen stays black, even after 15-20 minutes. I will go to task manager and it tells me the program has stopped working, I have all the system requirements for this game, help?"
,gigas232,2012-11-30T23:05Z,"Black screens, any for of alt tabbing makes it crash. help?"
,gigas232,2012-11-30T23:05Z,"Derp, thought last comment didn't get through."
,lotster,2012-12-01T15:35Z,"@gigas232, this is also a common problem, it usually happens when you try to run BioShock in Windows 7 or Windows 8.  Try installing DirectX 9, that usually solves it! ;-)"
,MAA11792,2012-12-02T01:21Z,"@lotster dumb fuck, DX11 ships with Win8."
,lotster,2012-12-02T05:07Z,"@MAA11792, yes. Obviously. AND BIOSHOCK DOESN'T USE DX11.  Go check your facts. Google it, like normal people do, before proving their idiocy through verbal diarrhea."
,lotster,2012-12-02T05:33Z,"@MAA11792, yes, OBVIOUSLY.  However, a quick Google shows results on Microsoft's forums indicating that some games designed for DirectX 9 won't run on DirectX 10 or 11, having problems such as black screens.  The solution proposed by Microsoft professionals is to install DX9 alongside DX10 or 11.  I have used this solution myself, because many of my games don't run in DX10 or 11.  So, @MAA11792, before shooting off your mouth, do a quick Google.  It helps you to not prove your idiocy through verbal diarrhea.  Now go play with the other kiddies and leave us adults to talk intelligently without insulting one another."
