This is the COMPLETE Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime. I have collected all 4 seasons. A few episodes appear to be recorded from TV (there is a tv splash over the video from Cartoon Network). I have tried my absolute best to get the best quality videos possible but I ended up having to rip a few from a web player because they were such poor quality. 


Seasons 1-3 are English dubbed and season 4 is English Subbed (was never dubbed in English). Episode 156 (final episode in season 3) is English subbed because it was never dubbed in English.

I have this show ordered by season with each episode named correctly. I feel that doing it this way will help people find what episode they are actually looking for.

Here's the description of the show:

Set a generation into the future, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX revolves around a boy named Jaden Yuki as he begins his life at Duel Academy, owned by Kaiba Corp. While running late for his entrance exams, Jaden bumps into Yugi Muto, the King of Games! Seeing a Duel Disk and deck, Yugi thinks he must be a duelist, Jaden confirms this as he says he's on his way for his entrance exams for the Duel Academy. Yugi decides to give him a Winged Kuriboh card, saying it is a lucky card, and he wishes Jaden luck on his exams as he runs off.

As Jaden enters the school, he befriends Alexis Rhodes, Syrus Truesdale, Bastion Misawa, Zane Truesdale, and Chazz Princeton. Together they experience many adventures while trying to stop evil from spreading!

There are three dorms in Duel Academy, Obelisk Blue for the Elite, Ra Yellow for those with potential, and Slifer Red, for the drop outs.
