Every one--from appetizers to desserts--can be made start to finish in 45 minutes or less (though many clock in at 25 minutes). Full of new and inventive features, like putting x to work (where we show you 5 distinctive ways to use things like pizza dough, tortellini, peanut butter, cream cheese, etc.), the ATK Quick Family Cookbook is the perfect way to get great, reliable, and flavorful food on the table in this time-crunched world. We also teach you how to think about and organize your pantry, tell you what equipment you need in a quick kitchen, and introduce you to our top shortcut ingredients. As well, we offer a feature called Knife School that will make you a more efficient cook and provide you with a supermarket guide and other core information.
