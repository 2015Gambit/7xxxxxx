[T],blackcanary,2012-11-18T16:25Z,"I understand that it is a request from a user, but if it already exists and is seeded on TPB, would it not be better to direct the user to that torrent so that will help educate the user to use the search feature and if they just missed it while doing a search, directing them to the existing torrent will at least a healthy torrent on TPB for the future.

I bring this up because about a month ago I uploaded a torrent with three releases of an issue and another user essentially asked why I re-uploaded the same issue as they had (they had uploaded just one of the three releases of the issue).  I had searched for the issue prior to uploading, but did not search by the title abbreviation.  Previous issues had all been uploaded with the full time and not the abbreviation.

Often I'll come across a different release (for example a digital version) of a comic that is already on TPB (for example a scanned version), but I haven't uploaded it to avoid duplication of the issue.  Sometimes the digital version is of higher quality because the scan was of an old comic.  If there is no issue with that, then I'll upload those versions.  I'm just trying to understand what the best practice is here on TPB."
