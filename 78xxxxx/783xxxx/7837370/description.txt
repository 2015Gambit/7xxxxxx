 Info: 
 Dirt 3 (stylised DiRT 3) is a rallying video game and the third in the Dirt series of the Colin McRae Rally series, 
 developed and published by Codemasters. However, the "Colin McRae" tag has been completely removed from this iteration 
 (having previously been removed from only American versions of previous games in the series). The game was released in 
 Europe and North America on 24 May 2011, and two days later in Australia for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
 The Japanese version of Dirt 3 was released on 25 August 2011.[4][5][6] In September 2011, there were reports that a network
 security problem on the website of an AMD promo had resulted in the loss of 3 million Dirt 3 keys to the public for use 
 via the Steam platform that have then been posted in various places around the internet.
