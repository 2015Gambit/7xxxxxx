Alex jones recieves calls from obama "Maniacs" it's very funny and sad at the same time. To see how the governments all over the world are able to control peoples' mind. I think the voting for obama just because he's black it's as stupid as voting against him just because he's black. People are not intrested in the truth anymore. It's not about  black vs white or china vs america or muslim vs jew or whatever. They just try to divide us to have  better control. I'm not worried because many poeple are awekening right now because the things they hide just get bigger and bigger. And one day everybody will see through their propaganda. The elite might have the media, financial institutions, and all big corporations but we are their true power every time we get stronger they get weaker. So spread the word of freedom and peace. Because nobody will give us freedom we have to take it back.
