Putting that aside, this upload is pure quality. Sure, the audio might need some work, but honestly, this is amazing, especially for a FREE download. So, as a always have to say to these inept haters, shut the FUCK up, and enjoy the movie. Go download somewhere else if you feel the need to open your mouth.

Seriously wtf is with the audio. It sounds like its mono at times and stereo the other. This is NOT 5.1 surround sound. 

Solid quality but srsly tho the audio is not up to scratch. There's prob DVDrip's out there that have better auido quality. Its listenable but you have to keep adjusting the volume - its either too loud or the music/action fx sounds just dies down at random times. "

,Gaurav2107,2012-11-21T07:56Z,thanks yify nice upload.but one question that the movie ratio changes automatically throughout the movie.is it normal in the movie or some fault?
,randichod,2012-11-21T08:35Z,"Really pathetic Rip!

in some frames there are black patches above and under and sometimes its full frame!irritating"
,yzf600,2012-11-21T11:52Z,"audio is very low, i have many YIFY movies, each one of them is great, including audio.
But this one, i have to admit, don't like it. I have to boost the sound manually

V = as usual 10/10
A = maybe 5/10"
,ram95,2012-11-21T14:40Z,The resolution of the wide screen scenes were not 1080p :(
,HKCannibal,2012-11-22T04:06Z,"The end of this epic trilogy magnifies that was produced by Christopher Nolan, thank you for the video quality extreme, and with good audio."

,rferdi91,2012-11-22T17:05Z,very good quality 
,deanPantera,2012-11-22T23:37Z,"Thanks a ton, YIFY!
Downloaded this movie from about 10 different sources here on tpb.  This is the best copy I've found under 5gig...hands down!

A: 9.5 (2-channel)
V: 9.5
M: 8.5"
,Crussh,2012-11-23T01:52Z,thanks !!!!  I love all your works ! thanks alot :)
,mrdanthedeadman,2012-11-23T01:56Z,"I hate how people always bitch about the audio, considering almost every movie out there has those high and low moments where the speech is too low and the music is too loud.  Even when you are watching the dvd"
,trace535,2012-11-23T08:35Z,"Looks flawless (no compression artifacts) full screen on my 1366x768 laptop.

V: 10/10
A: 10/10"

,Chased911,2012-11-23T21:16Z,"V = 10
A = 10
M = 9 (the woman is the ""bad guy"")"
,trace535,2012-11-23T23:30Z,"SPOILERS

Things that are wrong with this movie:

1. An actor's performance is carried in the eyes and mouth. Bane's mask hides half of Tom Hardy's performance.

2. Stupid MacGuffin plot about an unrealistic neutron bomb.

3. Marion Cotillard is a brilliant French dramatic actress, so she's completely wasted if you cast her as a one-dimensional villain.

4. The final shot of Bruce Wayne sitting in the Cafe should have been left out. Better to had left it as whether Alfred was smiling at someone real or not to be ambiguous."
,1-2many,2012-11-24T04:01Z,"Thank YIFY since i discovered your torrent av never regretted upon downloading you torrents ""Asante sana"""
,topgearules,2012-11-24T07:10Z,"AMAZING TORRENT! 
Don't see why anyone was complaining!
A=10 , V=10, M=100
thanks YIFY!!!"
,zlo78,2012-11-24T20:59Z,Cheers man
,abdep,2012-11-25T05:58Z,"Great video, however as others have noted, audio is very poor (try playing this on a home theater and you can't not notice, I was playing this over the holidays with company and I kept cringing) yify is always my first choice for movies, download the 720 rip until we get a proper rerip , thank you nonetheless!"
,trace535,2012-11-25T09:35Z,"Audio is 2 channel 96 kbps AAC, and there are no issues whatsoever."
,MovieWatcher1989,2012-11-26T03:01Z,"Sir YIFY im a big fan of your torrents, Pls upload the 40 Days And Nights 2012.. thank you in advance."
,booyah99,2012-11-26T03:30Z,"I usually get 2-2.5 mbps downloads, now I'm getting ~180kbps. Please seed you guys. "
,mjpd1,2012-11-26T17:18Z,"Great quality via Apple TV to 52"" LCD. Audio and video are both superb. Not sure what anyone else is complaining about. Scanned through the whole movie and sampled bits, seems to play fine throughout. Only complaint is Bane's voice is a little out of sync with his lips (har har)."
,Malik9516,2012-11-26T18:47Z,"Good print, however, the movie is not complete. YIFY is a trust worthy resource on Pirate Bay, I wonder why is this movie not complete? The end of the movie is missing"
,Heduxz,2012-11-26T20:02Z,Thank you as always.
,trace535,2012-11-26T23:33Z,"Malik9516, huh? The film is complete. What are you talking about?"

,d4rkkn16ht,2012-11-27T14:55Z,"Thanx YIFY...You're the MAN

But I have some feedback for you:
Better increase the quality a little more.
Color blending is very distorted in many of your torrents...:)

Again...you're the MAN :D"
,tyson93,2012-11-27T18:56Z,"Love you YIFY..!!!
You always have the best print....Keep it up man....:)"
,OscarAndradePTY,2012-11-28T01:31Z,You should have changed the third screenshot. That shot ruins the whole movie.
,TugBot,2012-11-28T02:40Z,"Just cause the res reads 1920*1080, dont make it HD, bit rate please, but nope, none of his shit has the bit rate for people to see.

Better increase the quality a little more.
Color blending is very distorted in many of your torrents, because they really aint HD.

Are people that stupid that they think just cause it says its 1920x1080 at 2g its HD? LOL is all I can say.

Ya it looks ok, but none of YIFY's High Res movies are actually high res."
,trace535,2012-11-28T05:15Z,"I think everyone knows that 2.48 GB is not enough for a 1080p movie that is nearly 3 hours.

Just resize it and watch it at a lower size."
,rajusahrauniyar,2012-11-28T08:10Z,yeah you fucking yify a 1080p movie at 2 gb you mf u should take a look at bozx uploads they r really awesome
,Dessum,2012-11-29T19:51Z,"Great quality, but the audio is a little quiet. Thank you!"
,t_amante,2012-11-30T03:11Z,"""Are people that stupid that they think just cause it says its 1920x1080 at 2g its HD? LOL is all I can say.""

Finally, someone with sense. But that's fine. People getting this are probably stupid. And stupid people do not seed. YIFY is taking away the morons from the really HD releases."
,ddmac,2012-11-30T09:20Z,"audio is shit , action sequences nearly broke my windows and trying to hear what the fuck they where saying was a nightmare"
,GSO1990,2012-11-30T15:27Z,"YIFY, we salute you!"
,lif3isfr33,2012-12-01T13:28Z,The only people who should be getting yify torrents are Muslims in the third world wanting to watch it on their gameboy devices in HD stereo.. their used to mono thats why they give 10/10 for audio. Also for people that are elsewhere maybe in the US are probably people watching them on their crapbox360.. look at yifys followers are sad.....
