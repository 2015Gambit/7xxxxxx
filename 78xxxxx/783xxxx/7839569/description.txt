   Drawing together the latest theoretical and experimental understanding    
   of the phenomena of delayed hydride cracking (DHC) in zirconium alloys,   
   this book provides a detailed explanation focusing on the properties of   
   hydrogen and hydrides in these alloys.

  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :
  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :
  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:
