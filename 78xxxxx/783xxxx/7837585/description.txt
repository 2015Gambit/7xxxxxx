This is the same package of files ( except the Read Me i made ) tha i used to FINALLY get CoD BO II work on my PC. Just follow the instructions in the READ ME and everything should work out fine. Just note that none of these files are mine, i just assembled them and made this package. My system specs are: 
Laptop: Windows 7 x64
        nVIDIA 520M
        Intel Pentium B920 2.00GHz
        4GB RAM
        Installed Skidrow's iso release with Daemon Tools.

Something i forgot to mention in the READ ME is RUN THE GAME AS ADMIN !!!!
