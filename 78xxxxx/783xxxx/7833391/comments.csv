,cosmicfurbal,2012-11-17T08:42Z,It's real. It was released in 4 parts on the machinima channel with the last part being released on the 26th. It's more than likely just a rip off youtube.
,Vince82,2012-11-17T08:52Z,"quietguy404, if you would smarter up a little you would notice the green skull and then you would click on scene4all link to see his other torrents.  And i'm familiar with scene4all, its legit i'm sure."
,Juhko1985,2012-11-17T09:08Z,"Actually it was released in 5 parts.. 5x 17 min long parts.. this must be a ""mixup"" or smth like that.. have not downloaded, coz i watched those 5 seriers already!"

It's a given that you have to like Scifi and Halo though.

As said, pretty bad copy, fetch a 720, so worth if you want to see all the beautiful effects.

,Germican,2012-11-20T16:36Z,"This movie has actors from Supernatural, Stargate Universe and other great SciFi shows. Whoever sais it's bad acting from a bunch of kinds, is a retard. Same with the special effects. Good movie ;)"
,FuckingIdiots,2012-11-20T16:53Z,"It's a pretty good movie...considering that it is a low budget one made for the launch of a game. Somehow ties in seamlessly with game lore, too. Also, it's available for free on YouTube, innit?

P.S. hxxq, go back to your gay porn and spelling classes. If this was a movie about Call of Duty, I bet 5 quid you'd be jizzing your pants, you under-educated 10 year old retard who's unfortunately been set loose on the interwebz."

I was really impressed that a live action move was made about the Halo Franchise.  This was something done when 343 took over, something I am glad they did.  For those who don't know this is before and during the start of the Covenant War.  In some books these characters are portrayed and Master Chief as well.  The acting was indeed well played, and I enjoyed watching Master Chief have Lady Luck always on his side.(Halo fans will get this).  scene4all I thank you for this awesome and superior movie.  Thank you. "

,Zero236,2012-11-25T23:06Z,"This was for the fans, the original 'Halo' movie ended up being district 9, it's about time they got this done.
I watched this movie before i came to this torrent so all i can say to scene4all is we appreciate this being out there, keep up the solid work. Sometimes we seem ungrateful but we do appreciate the efforts put in by yourself and others like you..."
,KiMpOj,2012-11-26T02:59Z,A lot of people here seem to fail to realize that this is a web-series cut together into a movie. That's why the pacing is slow and the acting isn't that of a high-budget movie.
