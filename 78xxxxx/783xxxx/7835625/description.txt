another one from my cobwebs i found, this one rather short about 55 minutes comes from a $1.99 dvd along with a few more so no modern day enhancing but these old westerns are fun to watch.

Storyline

When Butch Taggart escapes prison, the Marshal sends Lightning Morgan to find him and his hidden gold. He finds the map to the gold on Taggart's boot. Joe Laikon and his men are also after the gold and they overpower Morgan, get the map, and head for the treasure. But Morgan and Tod Grant are soon on their trail. 

User Review

Pretty good Western script with a great performance by Ken Maynard make this a must-see movie.

Of course any movie with Charles King is also a must-see, but Maynard and King are surrounded by players ranging from capable to excellent.

George Chesebro gets a rare chance to play a good guy; Wally West gets another unbilled part; Reed Howes and Bob Terry had small parts which they handled very well.

William Gould had what might now be called a cameo, but he might have been the smoothest actor in the entire cast. I thought he showed ability, subtlety, presence enough to have been a major performer. He did have a very long career, anyway.
