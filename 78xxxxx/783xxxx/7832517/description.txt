PLOT
.
A film that chronicles the events of the Hindenburg disaster in which a zeppelin burst into flames. 
.
Notes:
Could not find a proper DVDR, With all 7 DVDR i get there was something wrong, and all different playtimes.
Get a NTSC DVDR With a Nice old menu, ok menu was fine picture quality very noisy to bad. runtime 2h05min
Get me a DVDR PAL humzz very nice Picture quality and a non working menu. runtime 2h00min
With 5 min difference in the 2DVD's u get charpter errors or there not working at all.
So we make a DVD from a PAL and NTSC DVD.
.
1. Converted the PAL to NTSC @2passes
2. Strip the subtitles and Synch the timings.
3. Custom create the Charpters 1 by 1. DVDLAP-PRO is perfect to do this.
4. Mux everting back.
5. Removed LU French and Spanish. (LU=Language Unit)
6. Removed parental things, Warnings and some useless stuff.
.
Ending up with a Nice picture quality for an old movie
and a nice English Old Menu With some nice Extra's and named charpters.
