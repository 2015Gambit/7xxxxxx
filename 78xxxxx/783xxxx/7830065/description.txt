Innovation, creativity and change are the lifeblood of business but unlocking the innovative ability of an organization can be a difficult process.A recent survey (Synectics, 2002) reveals a gap between what leading corporations say about the importance of innovation and what they actually do about it. However, this survey finds that there is a consistent connection between a companyΓÇÖs commitment to innovation and its success in the marketplace:
* Sales increase in highly innovative companies was 10.8% vs. only 5.7% in least innovative
* Profit increase in the most innovative companies was more than three times as great as in less innovative companies (51% vs. 14%)
* Market share increase in the more innovative companies was more than twice the growth (59% vs. 27% increase)
"Big Ideas" highlights pathways to creativity and shows how to establish conditions that lead to innovation and success. It is highly practical, and includes checklists, case studies and a "mind gym" questionnaire to establish the [ Italics]Innovation Quotient of an organization.
