Did you check out the subs to see if they are any good? I'm assuming these aren't by IceHunter."

,tapaleat,2012-11-19T14:07Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
,tyrabit,2012-11-19T15:00Z,"Thanks, for your effort. 

Just a sidenote though, don't get your hopes up, these subtitles are next to impossible to read, long lines of text are only shown for a very brief time... I thought I was a quick reader, but half of the dialogue did not reach me."
,Pinky_,2012-11-20T04:02Z,Yeah!!!!! Thanks @Unopoleco !
,icek00l,2012-11-20T13:25Z,"Subs are not as good as 1 thru 6 and I can confirm the comment above about long lines of text, perhaps shown a bit too briefly, however, all dialogue got thru to me.

So, not too bad, watchable, I guess the comment above is from a guy with low reading age.

To all who visit this page, this show is currently airing on BBC4 (UK) 2 episodes each Saturday night. I will wait for them to get to episode 7, 8, 9, 10 and download perfect BBC standard hardcoded subs via a very clever program called ""get_iplayer"", it is a command line based app but gets you beautiful DRM FREE mp4s, choice of three sizes, the largest of which is 1280x720.

If any of you want the really perfect hardcoded subs, BBC standard, look into getting this great program, rather then go to the shitty iplayer page and download a crappy DRM .wmv file.

For those outside of the UK, use a proxy or your VPN, if you don't know how to do that you are not worthy of owning a fucking computer in the 1st place."

,lewek2001,2012-11-20T19:01Z,â&#x2122;Ľ for the english subs
,technimac,2012-11-23T01:40Z,"Hey icek00l,
Thanks for that info on snagging the BBC series in mp4 format.
I'd love to get this in 1280x720, but as I'm not worthy of owning a fucking computer in the first place, so I'll have to rely on some good-spirited soul, someone like ""onionjack"" who UL'd Forbrydelsen Series II on De***oid last year, to do the same on TPB, for us techno-pions in the colonies.
A big thanks to unopoleco, IceHunter and other translators for upping this version."
,lLoMac,2012-11-26T19:52Z,Thank you
[T],NoggintheNomad,2012-11-28T20:30Z,Brilliant work. BBC is lagging behind on this one.
,icek00l,2012-12-01T13:19Z,"@technimac, stop crying like a mummies boy, if you look at several of the previous episodes uploaded by unopoleco you might see that I have thanked unopoleco for his excellent efforts several times in a highly appreciative manner and I am grateful for his efforts.

On reflection I could/should have phrased the last part of my comment in a much nicer manner and so I do apologise to anyone reading the above comment, it's not much of an excuse but I was very rudely interrupted with some bad news during the time I was at the computer at the time of writing which put me in a very bad mood, so once again, sorry for any offence.

Having said that, get over it technimac & don't be so pathetic."
