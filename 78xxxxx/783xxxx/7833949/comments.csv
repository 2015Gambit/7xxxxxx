,kaptain_kompost,2012-11-17T17:08Z,"I'm getting really bad blips in audio during playback in VLC, WMP reproduces these. This happened last week as well. What's going on?"
,Sick3r,2012-11-17T17:16Z,"kaptain_kompost..

The file is 100% fine. Try updating your player. "
,Sick3r,2012-11-17T17:26Z,"I take that back. There are some minor glitches in the sound that I didn't notice while watching it. Which is strange since I usually notice these things. Needless to say, the problem is minor, but worth looking in to. But hey... It's a free service. =P"
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-17T21:53Z,"@Sick3r
Where? I don't wanna watch the whole thing to find a glitch."
,yesmatey,2012-11-20T18:20Z,"The comments about the audio being messed up are right. If you listen with a pair of headphones you can hear the audio skipping and doing weird stuff.

One of your other torrents had the same issue."
,Craxicus,2012-11-25T05:13Z,Did Episode 11 come out yet or was it delayed?
,Scandalen,2012-11-26T01:51Z,"Please, why hasn't episode 11 been uploaded? :("
[T],SecTPB,2012-11-27T21:30Z,"Episode 11 airs this Friday. There was no TUF last week, guys. Be assured that I'll upload it."
,Craxicus,2012-11-28T07:00Z,Thanks Sec :D
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-30T12:27Z,@SecTPB thanks for clarifying that. I nearly had a heart-attack with no one saying anything. I don't have cable. Also been digging all torrent sites and forums. Call me crazy :0)
,mattydizzle,2012-11-30T22:29Z,Can't wait for the next episode! Will it be uploaded soon? Thanks!
,mattydizzle,2012-11-30T22:30Z,I just read the other comments! :) Thanks again!
