*PLEASE READ*

I have uploaded the missing ep S01E07. It is here:

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7877608

I will be uploading the whole series again with the missing ep around the middle of December. Right now my seedbox is nearly out of upload bandwidth.

Anyways, I'm sorry about missing an ep. It was on my iPod, but for some reason the program I use to grab the tagged eps from my iPod didn't grab it the first time. ::shrugs:: I'll have to keep a better eye on the eps it grabs."
