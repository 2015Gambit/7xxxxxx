Mark Knopfler - Saskatoon 2012, october 23
------------------------------------------


It might not be a better version than Berkeley version in terms of sound quality (but good enough indeed). But that thing varies on every song itself. Maybe just a matter of taste, I dunno. Anyways, it's a kind of variation though. And some songs are better in this version, and some are not!


All thanx and credit to the group "FKK"!
