,mrrcarney,2012-11-17T09:19Z,"I am and was very thankful

It was my fault nothing to do with slow seed

I am running on 3G internet until my line gets installed on the 6th so it was slow for me  

I will seed the video aslong as I possibly can"

@trailblazer666 Tell me, do you see 'hdtv' in the title anywhere in the title? No, so wtf were you expecting?"

Im sorry if i hurt your feelings. I hope you will forgive me some day. I am grateful that you release episodes so fast. "
