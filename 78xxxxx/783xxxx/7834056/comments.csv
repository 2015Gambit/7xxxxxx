where you find the movie?"
,Irishbeast,2012-11-20T05:36Z,Is there anyone who doesnt know how to sync the audio using VLC? ive seen tons of comments on all these torrents about audio is out of sync. Yet no one has replied telling them how they can fix that. If you watch it using VLC player you can sync the audio yourself. Very easy to use.
