[S],velvet.,2012-11-17T23:22Z,"Next time you create a torrent posting on this web site, I hope you will be smart enough to create a better listing title than ""pirate_bay_torrent"".

Most folks using this web site are not mind readers.
It is therefore very useful to create torrent posting titles that properly describe what the torrent contains."
