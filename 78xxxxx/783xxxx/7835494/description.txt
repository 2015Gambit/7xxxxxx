This new, fully revised second edition of Fundamentals of Molecular Virology is designed for university students learning about virology at the undergraduate or graduate level. Chapters cover most of the major virus families, emphasizing the unique features of each virus family. These chapters are designed to tell stories about the viruses covered, and include information on discovery, diseases and pathogenesis, virus structure, steps in viral replication, and interaction with cellular signaling pathways. This approach portrays the ΓÇ£personalityΓÇ¥ of each virus, helping students to learn the material and to build up their knowledge of virology, starting with smaller and simpler viruses and proceeding to more complex viruses.

FEATURES OF FUNDAMENTALS OF MOLECULAR VIROLOGY:
- Clear style. Written in a simple and clear style for students with a background in cell and molecular biology.
- Full-color figures. Numerous full-color figures complement the text and illustrate virus structure, genome organization, and individual steps in virus replication.
- Extended coverage. This second edition has five new chapters: Cucumber Mosaic Virus; Viruses of Archaea; Viruses of Algae and the giant Mimivirus; Intrinsic Cellular Responses Against Virus Infection; and Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses to Virus Infection. All other chapters have been revised and updated.
- Study aids include thumbnail sketches of each virus group, informative chapter subheadings, and a comprehensive glossary with definitions of numerous terms.
- Chapter introductions give historical background and information about viral diseases.
- Text boxes throughout the book feature exciting and current developments in molecular virology or practical applications of viruses in science and medicine.
- Key Terms, Fundamental Concepts, and Review Questions at the end of each chapter help students review and organize information they have learned.
- Information on human pathogens. Includes chapters on important human pathogens including herpes viruses, hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza viruses, measles virus, poliovirus, smallpox virus, West Nile virus, and others.
