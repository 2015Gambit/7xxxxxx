Belfast, 1909. The Harland and Wolff shipyard has been handed the greatest project in its history. It will build a great, unsinkable ship. And it will be called the RMS Titanic.

"Titanic: Blood & Steel" is the untold story of the building of a legend, and the many lives it affected during its 3-year construction. To its wealthy investors, it was a dream. To the middle class who oversaw the project, it was a challenge. But to the working class who built it, Titanic was the start of a revolution. With Ireland under British rule, and theProtestant and Catholic struggle intensifying, Titanic was more than a shipΓÇªit was a symbol of ambition, hope and unity.
