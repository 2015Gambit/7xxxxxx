,goingmad1,2012-11-17T14:47Z,"Fade is working wonders in this. Sure you can run it, but playing is almost impossible. And even without fade this game is a crap. Far worse than farming simulator 2013. GFX is ok ( but badly optimized - game runs like shit on a good rig). So yeah no success in cracking this either. Skidrow is acting bad lately."
,nicklas1015,2012-11-17T17:06Z,"Crack works fine. Its a shitty game though.

Unoptimized as fuck, and half the tutorial missions are bugged as hell, so its not worth installing IMO."
,qpn,2012-11-17T21:13Z,"optimalization is fucking crap, developers learned nothing from previous games. can't believe that developers still exist on game market."
,jebatibog,2012-11-17T22:02Z,"I can't go reverse with tractor.. HOW DO I GO REVERSE WITH MY TRACTOR?!? Is there any trick to fix this bug? I would rather play Farming simulator,but in FS im always getting damn error GIANTS game engine has stopped working!!"
,RojoBauer,2012-11-19T04:21Z,goty
,Hoggsten,2012-11-24T08:35Z,worked great thanks guys
,S8W7,2012-11-25T23:00Z,"This game blows. Amazing concepts, but poorly executed. I get crashing while trying to use some of the more advanced farm management features. Likely ""fade"" as goingmad1 pointed out.

Worth a try, but don't expect much from this release. Likely not worth buying, either."
,draxon1,2012-11-26T15:18Z,crack for the new patch 1.0.0.5 version? 
,Devil_jinn,2012-11-27T17:52Z,"Great ..One..HeroMaster...
