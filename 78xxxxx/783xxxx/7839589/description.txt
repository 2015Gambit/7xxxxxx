Thie is a live concert from March 2011 by Claudia Brücken, most famous for singing in the German synthpop band Propaganda. They released two records on ZTT, "A Secret Wish" and "Wishful Thinking". (Both re-released with bonus tracks.)

She now works with Paul Humphreys from OMD, and their band is called OneTwo. Here Claudia explains why they put on this concert:

"Over the years we’ve extended our live band. This happened in conjunction with the release of Combined, a best of me compilation, which is where I could in a way finally settle down and look at my overall history of song from when I started in the early 80s to nearly thirty years later, from Propaganda to Onetwo.

To celebrate this release we decided to give a one off performance in London at the Scala in King’s Cross, with some special guests who were part of my musical career. My guests were Susanne Freytag & Ralf Dörper, Glenn Gregory & Martyn Ware (Heaven 17), Andy Bell and Andrew Poppy."

This concert is also available as a 7gb ISO, but you don't need to download that, since the quality of this x264 rip is flawless.
