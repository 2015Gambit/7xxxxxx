,Shibapup,2012-11-20T07:49Z,"I have a copy of DVDfab but recently I went to use it and a Report Info box came up saying it has encountered a problem. I have since then uninstalled it, and downloaded one version of DVDfab, the same thing happened. Now this torrent also has the error. Is anyone got the same problem?"
