,sammemannen,2012-11-18T22:46Z,Worked pefecetely fine for me!
,moeburn1,2012-11-18T22:56Z,"@sammermannen - so you had a russian version and this converted it to english just fine?  Cause the guy that posted it was a little vague, he said it would convert it from russian to ""whatever language you want"".  I'm assuming it is english-only."
,chameleeon,2012-11-19T00:14Z,really? dont believe it
,Karnadas,2012-11-19T17:45Z,"Just started it up and it works. From title screens to the menu. Haven't gone in-game yet, however."
,Karnadas,2012-11-19T19:10Z,"Been playing it, now. Everything's in english. The game is kinda buggy, but not in a broken kind of way. Guns floating when they should be on the ground (like, one out of the whole batch of guards I've killed) etc."
,nickcims,2012-11-20T01:37Z,"Well if you install the game and don't use uplay swap lang file then do uplay and ect maybe it will work Once uplay validated it in RU I dont think you can change language unless a different crack is used I guess.

,PetaFlux,2012-11-20T09:41Z,"Thank you, it worked. :-D"
,cooper125,2012-11-20T11:44Z,Was working fine until I used this file. Won't launch now
,rawan007,2012-11-20T17:14Z,Can anybody tell the exact process to install this..should I have to change the file name to localization.lang??plz rply
,L337ish,2012-11-20T17:55Z,"Thank you! Works perfectly, I'm now playing this game in English with no bugs or errors! :)"
,L337ish,2012-11-20T17:58Z,"@rawan007

Once you download the file, just right-click it and choose to copy, then go to the directory where you installed the game and select the Assassin's Creed 3 folder that contains the game and all those other files, then just right-click anywhere in the folder and paste. You will know if you are in the right place because it will prompt you ""Are you sure you want to?"" with 3 options, and you choose ""Copy and Replace"". This will replace the old language file with the new one. 

Hope that helps"
,DeagleAc3,2012-11-21T03:30Z,+Support It works for me too.
,SanHolo,2012-11-21T11:37Z,"this changed the language to English but it didn't change the spoken language, it actually muted it, anybody know why or how to fix it?"
,G3tm3soda,2012-11-21T19:23Z,This works for Skidrow version too! Soo happy :D
,tonythedragon,2012-11-22T19:52Z,It worked for me too...i've downloaded the p2p version and it hadn't any language crack :@
