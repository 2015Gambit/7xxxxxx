Found this on the RLSLOG comments, and I heard a lot of you accidentally downloaded the russian version.  Could someone with the RUS version please test out this file and let us know if you can actually change it to english?


Torrent contains 1 file:
localization.lang - <1kb

"Replace with the original localization.lang in ACIII directory.
Run the game
Enjoy"
