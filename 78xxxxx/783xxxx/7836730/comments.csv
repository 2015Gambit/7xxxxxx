,GateKeeper13,2012-11-18T15:39Z,"Guys, I confirm this release has synced audio. Perfect upload!!!!!"
,drewbee333,2012-11-18T16:00Z,i just completed this download. it had small files and one was the sample that didn't even play. there was nothing... help? anyone?
,Fuzakenaideyo,2012-11-18T18:55Z,This is a quality file. Audio is in sync. a/v in line with a very good r5.
,MsBoo84,2012-11-18T23:13Z,Thanks!!
,STEPHEN97,2012-11-19T01:34Z,"drewbee333 u need to unzip files like that with winzip which is free here, click on file open or extract"
,Bofu,2012-11-19T06:57Z,@Fuzakenaideyo Are you blind? it is out of sync after about half way through.
,Man_over_Board,2012-11-19T09:56Z,"Quality is decent, typical SD with some compression artifacts, could be better considering the bitrate and 2pass encoding used.
The sound remains synched throughout (+/- a couple of ms) (no Bofu, you're wrong).
Very very watchable! (As far as A/V goes)"
,slithium,2012-11-19T18:32Z,"Great Quality, A: 9 V:9 , whoever said it was out of sync half way through should either check their computer or whatever media device they are using because it was just fine and in sync for me"

,P33ge,2012-11-21T02:22Z,The video is fine but I'm not sure why people are rating the audio so high.  It's not good.  It sounds like it's being blasted through my speakers.
,jalucian,2012-11-21T06:04Z,There's no excuse for the filesize being this large when the resolution is so low. Someone has no clue how to encode. This filesize is 4x as big as it needs to be for this low resolution.
,ItsCalledSoccer,2012-11-21T15:40Z,"yes the video and sound quality could be better

,Fritz.,2012-11-22T07:44Z,"good quality, shit movie.

i dont even get how people talk like this movie is so scary. i turned it off at the halfway mark because i was falling asleep.

maybe its one of those movies that has all the good moments in the last 10 minutes, i guess i will never know."

,buseireann,2012-11-26T02:53Z,How can anyone give this movie 10. Your just having a laugh. Why con people into downloading this rubbish. Remember anyone who downloads this after me warning them (I told you so)
,TtToker,2012-11-26T22:28Z,"Toy_Soldior69 & Buseireann are full of shit, this is great quality, I can't tell if its perfect or not but on my 32 inch tv it looked pretty close to perfect and the audio was just as good as the video, as good as any dvd.

great horror flick with a good story, hard to find"
,baybeerayper,2012-11-29T06:11Z,"looks great, thanks for this. 

A solid 7/10 for me, some scenes get redundant after awhile, baghoul is a little hokey, but overall good performances and the 8mm footage has some exceptionally creepy visuals. Fans of horror flicks should add this one to their collections."
