,Delron41,2012-11-18T16:51Z,CINAVIA PROTECTED!!!
,JoaoPauloBR,2012-11-20T19:57Z,This movie any good?
,Mr.Casino,2012-11-21T01:23Z,@ Delron41 dude cinavia protected lol really? you need to get an update man nobody watches this stuff on play station anymore you need a usb drive and plug it into your computer. I think you will find MOST movies are cinavia protected because playstation has pirated protection. That's your side and does not effect the movie or it's quality in anyway.
,Mr.Casino,2012-11-21T01:23Z,you could also plug a usb drive into your television. :)
,Mr.Casino,2012-11-21T01:29Z,@ Delron41 dude you need a usb drive to plug into your television. Playstation has protection so you can't be watching stuff from cd to ps3. you need usb drive to watch on television.

,Rush,2012-11-22T04:23Z,"@ Mr. Casino, can I plug a USB into my TV?"
,Delron41,2012-11-22T18:13Z,"@Mr. Casino

DUDE. I'm not watching it on my Playstation. I burn it to DVDRW and watch it on a bluray player. All post 2010 Bluray players have Cinavia built in.

Dude.
Thanks for the suggestions though!"

,mswinter,2012-12-01T12:38Z,"Thank you for the download A-9 V-9.
This is not a spoiler, but.. Dont be like me and download this to watch with your mum as lighthearted comedy, it can be very embarrassing, as the central focus is based around sex therapy.
Nothing wrong with the film, a giggle on your own, but let me stress this is NOT a movie to watch with your parents. "
