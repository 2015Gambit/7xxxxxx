This is the required text in one of the college classes I teach, and is required by hundreds of other colleges as well. It sells for 50 bucks on Amazon - more at college bookstores. I scanned it to PDF and give it away free to my students. Hope this saves someone some money!

Great Resource for English Teachers February 22, 2012
By pinkcheetah

This book is a must-have for high school English teachers. Each style of writing (comparison/contrast; description; narrative; etc.) is broken down in easy-to-understand language, and the explanations are short enough that students will actually read it. The model essays are good (comparable to other collections); however, the description of each essay type is what sets this book above the others. I used it in my classroom with great success, and now as an English Instructional Coach who works with teachers in planning and implementing lessons, I recommend it often.
