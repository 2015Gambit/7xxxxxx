,Zerrb,2012-11-19T02:06Z,"Worked pretty well until the mission ""Time and Fate"", when Mason looks at Menendez through binoculars, the entire screen turns white (As this is part of the game) and then crashes."

,SadEntity,2012-11-19T23:16Z,"Thank you gamedoc14. It finally works... but crashes at the second mission. I'm sure this is a different issue with the game coz it's the first edition. I hope the good guys will help us later with a tuned patch.
Thanks again for the crackers and for the uploader and whoever participated in this job to help ppl who can't afford to buy a game like this to play and have fun. We owe u big time."
,lextacy2,2012-11-23T01:52Z,"This crack is a fucking peice of shit, just like the other 8 blops2 cracks that still cant fucking fix the issue of the game start up! Now this crack sure enough dealt with the timezone bullshit so I can use my actual timezone to start to the game, but now this fucking crack forces me to watch that intro video allllll the way through then guess what? BLACK FUCKING SCREEN FOREVER!!! FIX YOUR CRACK AND TEST YOU SHIT BEFORE UPLOADING!  I had this game working before this but only before the 14th on nov!!! and I had to use the 8+ fix! This is UNACCEPTABLE!"
