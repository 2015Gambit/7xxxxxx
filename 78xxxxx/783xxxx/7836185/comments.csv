I deviated somewhat from my normal religion and history ups. Rambam1776 will be shocked. I highly recommend his torrents, btw.

Some take a considerable time to compile and I'm glad you enjoy it."

,harbrackgrad,2012-11-18T02:46Z,Will check out Rambam1776.  Thanks for the up and the recommendation.
