This is a portable version of Nichimen Mirai v1.1a.
It will run from any directory on any drive, as long
as the program is started with StartMirai*.exe.

----------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The first time you run mirai, you may get a few prompts
asking to allow lmgrd.exe and lmutil.exe access to the internet.
If you don't allow them in time, mirai will not start correctly
because it relies on these files to be up and running. If mirai
doesn't start, make sure you click "Allow" on the two windows,
close any windows opened by mirai and open StartMirai*.exe again.

----------------------------------------------------------------

* StartMirai.exe will start the standard version of mirai.

* StartMiraiDevoKit.exe will start the extended version of
mirai intended for use with the mirai development kit.

* StartMiraiDirectDraw.exe will start a Direct Draw enabled
version of mirai if your graphics card has issues with OpenGL.

This release was originally cracked by XFORCE, but I have included
an "UpdateLicense.exe" which will automatically create your license
for you. UpdateLicense is called automatically by StartMirai*.exe, 
so you don't need to call it yourself.

Just click any of the starter executables (eg StartMirai.exe), and
your license will be updated, FLEXlm will open in a console window, 
and mirai will open about 2 seconds afterwards. This wait time is to
allow FLEXlm to initialize properly.

No more installing, updating, cracking. You can run this anywhere.
Tested on Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 7 32-bit and Windows XP Professional.
