I just wasted 77MB of my bandwidth on this not realizing that it is episode FOUR! I have almost no bandwidth left for the month, so this really screwed me."

""Why the hell do people release stuff that has already been released, long after it has airedâ&#x20AC;˝""

The other torrent has 0 seeders and 72 leechers. I did this for the people that missed it, not you; you narcissistic fuck.

""I just wasted 77MB of my bandwidth on this not realizing that it is episode FOUR! I have almost no bandwidth left for the month, so this really screwed me.""

REALLY? You know what would have also told you it was episode FOUR?
The title of the torrent, the title of the file, the ""I noticed this episode had no seeds"" in the description, the long description of the episode....
If you're so worried about your bandwidth, why don't you fucking read before you download?
Also, I find it hilarious that you make it look like this was some plot to fuck you over. Go die please.

At the very least, please castrate yourself; the world doesn't need more narcissistic idiots."

The IMDB link is incorrect; it points to s02e04. This torrent is s01e04. The IMDB ID for this episode is tt2203069"

you are possibly one of the biggest douchebags on the planet. And.... one of the most retarded.

Just cuz it says ""click"" doesnt mean you have to. K champ?"

MWalsher, you are the best.  Keep doing what you do.  It's great entertainment for the rest of us.  Do people at least come and visit you in there, or bring you some food or the newspaper every so often?"
