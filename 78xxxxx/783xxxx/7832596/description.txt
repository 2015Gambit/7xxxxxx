   In this volume, Professor He and his coworkers summarize polyethylene     
   glycol (PEG)-promoted CO2 chemistry on the basis of understanding about   
   phase behavior of PEG/CO2 system and reaction mechanism at molecular      
   level. As PEG could be utilized as a green replacement for organic        
   solvents, phase-transfer catalyst, surfactant, support in various         
   reaction systems, significantly promoting catalytic activity and          
   recovering expensive metal catalysts, particularly regarded as a          
   CO2-philic material, the authors focus on special applications of PEG     
   in CO2 capture and utilization, including PEG-functionalized catalysts    
   for efficient transformation of CO2 and PEG-functionalized absorbents     
   for efficient CO2 capture. Furthermore, they describe carbon capture      
   and utilization strategy as an alternative approach to address the        
   energy penalty problem in carbon capture and storage. Interestingly,      
   the authors also discuss PEG radical chemistry in dense CO2 as rather     
   creative and unusual use of PEG, presumably serves as a reaction medium   
   and a radical initiator for radical chemistry.

  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :
  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :

  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:
