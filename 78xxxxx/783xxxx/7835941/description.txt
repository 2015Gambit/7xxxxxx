Damocles #1 - The Army of Sherwood (2008)
London, in the near future. Like all European capitals, the city is the scene of booming crime aimed directly at the rich. Hassan El-Ahmad, head of an industrial empire built on the arms trade, is threatened by terrorists demanding economic reform. If he does not comply his only son, Said, will be abducted. This sounds like a job for the Damocles Bureau and a very special team of elite bodyguards.
