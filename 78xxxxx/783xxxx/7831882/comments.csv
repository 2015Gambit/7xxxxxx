,netraith,2012-11-17T11:08Z,"This also works like nikita's previous start8 1.02 upload, but boy does this trip a LOT of antivirus.

In my case both windows 8's smartscreen filter and windows defender tried to stop the patch painter from running =O

I tried using 1.02's keymaker on 1.03 but that didn't work due to a bad file size error so I just manned up and let the 1.03 patch do its thing despite the warnings."
