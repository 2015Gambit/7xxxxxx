,olorenya,2012-11-18T05:35Z,Is there any chance of getting an HD version of this one?
[T],karmax264,2012-11-19T07:38Z,Sorry but no.
,olorenya,2012-11-19T09:12Z,"Thanks anyway, they actually used an image of mine in the show and I was hoping to get an HD copy without bothering them for it."
[T],karmax264,2012-11-19T12:15Z,"Actually you are quite lucky, I still have a full size copy(I usually delete it by now) but I don't really care to upload the full episode, it's in 1080p.  If you tell me what part to cut and encode I can do that.  "
[T],karmax264,2012-11-19T12:16Z,I'll leave the clip in 1080p
,olorenya,2012-11-19T20:08Z,"Thank you for your time, but I can't get the 480 video to play correctly in VLC/MPlayerx, Quicktime/iTunes, of Divx Player so I think I'll just buy the episode."
