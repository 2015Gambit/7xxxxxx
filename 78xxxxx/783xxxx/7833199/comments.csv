Damaged source - LOL / DIMENSION / re-encoders

Recommend waiting for the WEB-DL ... or ...
KarMa is a new voice unrelated to all ""Scene"" and re-encoders, if available - get it.

Some actually want to know if the file is damaged before they download it.

The real question is: Why do you want to keep this information from them?

Me? When LOL / DIMENSION stops putting out damaged goods, I'll stop pointing it out. Deal?

There are (I think) more than a dozen RGs in ""The Scene"" and LOL / DIMENSION
are the only one REGULARLY putting out Grossly Pixelated encodes.

FOV did it once. That's forgiveable - but 137? That's absurd.

AVIGUY"
,Tiroloco,2012-11-17T14:46Z,"Well it seems that You have done a very detailed job in looking into all of the files which those groups upload, and that raises a question:
Are you really doing it for the rest of the users? or just because You are a detractor of those groups with hidden interests? do You have a better source? then post link, upload it and stop making long irrelevant comments without giving any proper solution. Thank You very much ; )"

I love you.  That is what I've been trying to say to other people like MP4SUX.  And I DL DIMENSION all the time, and he's never used MP4 for GRIMM or any other show I DL... only MKV."
