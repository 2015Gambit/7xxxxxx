1) Download GAME, extract, install.

2) Run Uplay.exe from the ""UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher"" folder and let it update. (Or block it with your firewall)
3) Download CRACK and extract it.
3.a) Copy the ""localization.lang"" file to the main game directory.
3.b) Copy the ""Uplay.exe"" file to the ""UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher"" folder.
4) Start the game and create an account if you don't already have one.
5) When you are asked for a key/serial just press ""OK"".

First uninstall uplay from your PC
""C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher""

Then go to ubisoft site and download uPlay (just google ""ubisoft uplay"")
Install it and update it and create account and log in and check Remember me.

Then copy&paste cracked uplay to this folder!
""C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher""

Then just launch AC3SP.exe, and click on Start Game, and when asked for CD-Key just click ""OK"".

,XHaloXX,2012-11-19T18:24Z,"the game works perfectly, im in mid sequence 2, dont install patches nor updates, just use the uplay inside the crack folder.

Here is how to make it work:

1. Install it in russian. then copy the localization.lang file to game installtion folder, get it from here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7840806/Assassins_Creed_III-Update_1.01___Crack_Only_1.01

DONT INSTALL THE PATCH AS IT WILL NOT WORK EITHER WAYS.

2. Launch AC3sp.exe. it will launch uplay and IT MIGHT UPDATE, let it finish.
3. Create an account if u dont have one or log in.
4. Make sure to go online, uplay  will start to PREPARE sth in game by downloading few stuff which is quick, let it finish.
5. Quit uplay.
6. Copy Uplay from crack folder into ""C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher"" and overwrite the one in that folder.
7. launch Ac3Sp.exe again.
8. Hit go to game, activation will appear, hit ok.
9. Press Play, the game will start to update, HIT QUIT on the update dialog and the game will start.
10. Quit the game, go to Uplay settings and check the box to start Uplay in offline mode.
11. Block Uplay and AC3sp.exe in your firewall

Now launch Ac3sp.exe and it will work perfectly."

Could it be because my processor is only 2 GHz, while it needs 2.66 for minimum requirement. I've had a game that requires 3.00 GHz from Ubisoft launch on my PC without a problem, so i don't think it's that, so pls help if you know a solution"

If you follow the directions XHALOXX wrote out on page 6 of the comments the game will load correctly and allow you to play with everything in single player 99% working. The 1% that does not work is the files (or something else) are missing for controller support. 

Now i understand a lot of pc gamers get bent out of shape when someone mentions this and usually come back with some troll response of ""pc gamers use Kyb and Mouse gtfo"" etc. IMo their are just some games easier to play with a controller but still on a pc, fuck 360/ps3's shitty graphics.  "

,Viktor.Z,2012-11-20T12:20Z,"XHaloXX@ How is it possible that you can play without a single crash? I tried EVERYTHING to make the game run fine including your guide. I can make the game run, it's not a problem. But the game keeps crashing on me no matter what i do. I tried to run it with and without the 1.01 update. Without the update, the game crashes already during the first 3D cut scene. If i will update the game, it doesn't crash during the first cut scene. There is about 40% chance that the game will crush during the last cut scene with Desmond. During the opera part, the game never crash there. But on the boat part, the game crashes almost everytime during cut scenes. I can skip the cut scenes (but i hate to do that) and i can get to Boston. But there the game starts crashing also during the gameplay and the game becomes really unplayable. When it crashes, it mostly kick me to the desktop and the game does not responding, but i can close it from the task manager. But sometimes i'm really unlucky and it crashes without kicking me to desktop and i can't do a damn thing. The only option is hard restart of my PC.
I can run high-end games just fine. Mostly on highest details. So my system cann't be the problem. And my drivers are up to date.

PEOPLE, DOES ANYONE ELSE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH CRASHING? I can't be alone who have this problem."

What I ultimately did was uninstall uplay, then download the ""uplay pc"" installer from ubisoft's website, installed it, ran it (not ac3 exe), logged in with my real registered username, clicked the 'settings' gear icon and checked the box that said something 'login offline from now on'.  Then exited uplay, copied the crack over, and ran asssisnscreed3.exe.  Then i logged in again, i clicked play, it asked me for a cd-key, i clicked 'ok' with the box empty, and it worked and allowed me to play!

And I don't know what all the trouble everyone is having with Xbox 360 controllers; I have a wireless one and it is working perfectly fine, thankfully because I agree, this game was meant to be played with a controller.  I'm a keyboard/mouse gamer at heart, but they just don't work for 3rd-person games like these.

One thing though, the graphics detail is waaaay more than the AC2 series.  I got a very crappy average framerate of 20fps in some scenes of this game, much less than my average of 45-60fps in AC2.  It seems to be all in the CPU as well, my GPU was barely working compared to the CPU."

1.Install the game in Russian
2.Download the english language file localization.lang (available in piratebay)
3.Run game. Let uplay make updates,let the game update everything it needs to.
4.Create or log in on account in uplay
5.Click run game. The game will start if it wants key click OK. After the game launches quit. Turn off uplay.
6. Replace the crack in the folder with the uplay.exe in /ProgramFiles...etc. with the uplay.exe.
7.Run game.Log in the same account that u did last time or created. After running the game. Quit and turn off uplay again.
8. Go in Start Menu - Control Panel - System & Security settings - Then click on the firewall settings. U will have a list of things on the left. Click on the one saying Advanced Settings. There u will get a new window which is basically for creating a rule to block certain program. Click on Rules for outgoing traffic- and create rule - select program - select block - find game path and block the UbisoftAssassin's Creed IIIAC3SP.exe. Do the same for the uplay.exe (UbisoftUbisoft Game LauncherUplay.exe) . Give them a name by your desire. Run game and enjoy. No need to replace crack everytime. Seems to be long but it is very simple. Good luck guys. "

Just install. Navigating install menus is easy, regardless of language. 

Use THETA crack (no uplay needed at all) 

Use rus to eng file, just replace

Launch SP. Should work from there. 

I'm about 15 mins in. Runs nice and smoothly on medium settings on my crap PC. "

You morans.  I bet you the # of seeders is close to 90% of the # of people who have downloaded this torrent.  Unfortunately, demand is about 10x higher than supply right now.  

My copy finished in 44 hours with an average download speed of 100kB/s.  Sometimes it would go to 5kB/s for a while, and sometimes it would spike up to my max of 1000kB/s.  But I can guarantee you that with a torrent this big, and this popular, you are NOT going to get your max download speed sustained, and it is going to take at LEAST 24 hours if not more to finish downloading.

Whining about seeders just makes you look silly, and makes me post long pointless rants like this one."

It would indeed help with an offline crack so that one would be spared the whole uplay-cracking.

1. if you have installed the game and tried cracking it and stuff. Do a full uninstall which includes uplay,the game.

2. Now install the game

3. run ac3sp.exe

4. uplay will update and open, close it

5. download the theta crack

6. copy the 3 dll files to your game directory and your ubisoft game launcher directory

7. double click ac3sp.exe

8.play

This works for this release atleast.

Also dont bother with other cracks when this appear to be working"
