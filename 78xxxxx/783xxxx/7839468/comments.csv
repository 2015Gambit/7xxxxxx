Thanks from Australia. And like others, I'd watch this on TV. But it's not available for free to air shows, only Foxtel which is cable TV, damn expensive too :)

,Kizushini,2012-11-19T10:42Z,"One usefull lifetime tip guys.
If you want to get good subtitles, download BS player, try to convert it to PRO and it will find and download all the available subs for you. You just have to click ""download"" and it will get the subs inside the vid for you. Enjoy!"

,Yoey,2012-11-20T11:03Z,"You're awesome. Quality and Audio is always perfect. Removing the commercials from each episode (each week) is awesome. It's almost unfair when I watch normal television, because I have to sit through commercials. So grateful. Thanks again. 

On a side note, this is not why I'm commenting, but it just popped into my brain. Haha. Please help me figure out & understand how to add your subtitles to the episode. Thank you!"
