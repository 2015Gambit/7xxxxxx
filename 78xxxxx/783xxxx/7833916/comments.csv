,chaosstar23,2012-11-17T11:39Z,"still keeps crashing at loading screen after selecting new game. do i need ""treasures of the sun installed to get this to work? im not inexperienced i it just keeps crashing. sorry. what other version will this work on if not reloaded? (thats not in russian)"
,Sadler2,2012-11-17T12:52Z,"@chaosstar23 It will work only for these two builds that I have. If you can, upload your binary to one of the sharing services, I will apply my patch onto your EXE and we will see if it start working."
,Machine4578,2012-11-17T13:38Z,how do you activate the camera modes??
,Sadler2,2012-11-17T13:59Z,@Machine4578 Replace your EXE file by one from this torrent. Then move your mouse wheel while ingame.

thanks for your quick response... i actually had an xbox 360 gamepad hooked up, but found out by clicking the right stick changes the camera angle too..
i also must say thst his is a nice mod.. the angle is way better then the original.. NICE WORK and THANKS for sharing :)"
