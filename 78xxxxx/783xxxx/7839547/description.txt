MaSu is my all-time favorite band, hands down. Their sound, lyrics, vocals...everything just oozes awesome--especially when I listen in FLAC--right into my ear holes. I'm uploading this here so everyone else can have awesome oozed into their ear holes, too.

From Wikipedia:
Machinae Supremacy is a Swedish band that combines modern heavy metal and alternative rock with chiptunes. Self-defined as "SID metal", many of their songs use a SidStation that features the SID chip of the Commodore 64. They have released a considerable number of songs for free download on their site, 32 original recordings, with approximately 100,000 downloads a month.

This torrent contains their 2012 album, Rise of a Digital Nation, in glorious FLAC.

FROM THE BAND on Reddit:
"Sharing is caring. And don't be selfish. Seed what you leech."

Enjoy. \m/
