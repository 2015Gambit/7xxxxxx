ok, im gonna keep this really simple.

works only in duplex version [BLES01403].

THIS IS ONLY FOR 3.41 AND 3.55 USERS.

NOTE: eboot should be the same that was downloaded in duplex release.


replace all files in USERDIR folder from the folder i have given.

after that, load the game from multiman and press select+x to change param sfo to your firmware(3.41 or 3.55).

and THEN install the pkg given. THEN start the game. DONT INSTALL PKG FIRST AND THEN LOAD THE GAME. LOAD THE GAME FIRST AND THEN INSTALL PKG. THATS IT.

thank you duplex for another awesome release. you rock!
