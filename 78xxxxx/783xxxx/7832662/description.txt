Acoustic Africa was initially a compilation album released by Putumayo showcasing singersongwriters in a stripped down context, focusing on the melody, the rhythm and a unifying message of hope. In 2006 an internationally celebrated companion tour of the same name brought together singers Vusi Mahlasela, Habib Koité and Dobet Gnahoré. Five years later the second installment of Acoustic Africa s exhilarating musical journey focuses on the richness of the African guitar tradition. The 2011 rendition of Acoustic Africa features three of the continent s most indomitable touring artists, songwriters and social commentators; Habib Koité, the Malian superstar whose exciting concerts have endeared him to audiences worldwide; Oliver Mtukudzi, the best-selling artist in his home country of Zimbabwe; and Afel Bocoum, a guitarist, singer, and composer from Mali whose songs evoke the evolution of traditional Malian society. Performing solo, duo and trio and backed by an ensemble of traditional stringed and percussion instrumentalists the concert weaves a collection of traditional songs among contemporary popular ones from each of the leaders. The tour unfortunately will not be reaching the UK, but we have the CD and DVD to sustain us.
