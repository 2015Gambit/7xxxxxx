By the way this was only like yesterdays conversation, i got weeks of bull from these fellas simply cuz they screwed a contract, stalked a fella and thought that there was nothing wrong with it. I am SOOOOO confident that the info they had is wrong i just posted it on a site with 6 million people on it....."

And best part about this Newschaser and Atlantic Pro Wrestling setup, they are both throwing each other under the bus. They both literally ratted each other out not having a clue of what they were doing."
