Oh yeah, hes back and hes got another wrestling fed in his sites. Atlantic Pro Wrestling, fubbed a contract with me for 6 months of hosting after 2 months and instead of being the bigger man in the situation, they decided to screw me on it and decided "Hes unworthy of being in our ring".  They've lied, flip flopped their opinions, admitted to several things and EVEN TRIED TO BUY OFF ANONS! Good transcript to read. Just another fed proving why Pro Wrestling needs a change.
