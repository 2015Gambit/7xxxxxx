Godam aka Warehouse opens with a wedding procession followed by the ritual sacrifice of a sheep and invocation to God. A teenage bride, Yesu has been married to the mentally retarded son of a lecherous old man. On the night of the wedding, the father-in-law tries to rape Yesu and in the ensuing scuffle he is killed. A frightened Yesu runs away and hides in an abandoned warehouse. The very next day a new warehouse keeper Yedekar and his attendant Dharma, take charge of the warehouse. Yesu is discovered hiding behind some old bags of wheat. They feed her and let her stay for the night, but Yedekar is afraid of giving refuge to the girl. As time passes, Dharma becomes friendly with her and develops a protective attitude. His head office decides to send truckloads of food grain to the warehouse. Yedekar is scared of the girl being found out. He starts drinking heavily and losing his sanity. Finally, in a fit of drunken fury, he asks Yesu to leave immediately. Back to his room he suffers from hallucinations about Yesu and the impending arrival of trucks.
