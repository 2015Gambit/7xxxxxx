,Fluid56,2012-11-24T07:43Z,Thanks a bunch AnnoX4. You are an awesome person for taking the time to post this here. I appreciate you.
,Dandzeon,2012-11-24T12:28Z,"How to reset your game progress:

In order to access your save file and/or world file, go to:
C:Documents and Settings[Your PC Username]Local SettingsApplication DataFLTSteam
Delete the contents of that folder and you're ready to begin a fresh adventure.
I'm on XP, so I'm unsure whether the path is the same for the Windows 7 and 8 folk.
I'm sure if you simply run a search for FLT (including hidden folders) you'll find it."
,Dandzeon,2012-11-24T12:32Z,"For some reason the slash didn't post in my last comment, here:
""C:/Documents and Settings/[Your PC Username]/Local Settings/Application Data/FLT/Steam"""
,CoolMintz,2012-11-24T13:17Z,"Whenever I load the game, the window pops up and half a second later it closes. Anyone else have this problem? And more importantly, does anyone have a solution to this? :/
And yes I've clicked 'Run as administrator' and I didn't use a shortcut "
,HelperManly,2012-11-24T13:36Z,"@CoolMintz same problem bro ...

,Fluid56,2012-11-25T21:17Z,"The game saves automatically as it transistions from day-to-night. so, if you want to save, wait til nightfall."
,Albtraum,2012-11-26T03:35Z,"Thank you, Dandzeon. I can never fully enjoy a game without having 15 different worlds running at the same time."
