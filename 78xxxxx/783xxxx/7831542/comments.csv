Good one! thanks for the better audio..
@Zen_Bud
thanks for the upload, appreciated bro.. :) "
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-11-16T13:29Z,@juantamad00  Thx for that :)
,n26_93,2012-11-16T15:20Z,"Hey Zen_Bud, just wanted to clarify a few things. Is it absolute 1080p or the IMAX version? Also, are the last 15-20 minutes of good quality? It's not that I doubt your quality, it's just that there's a problem with it in a few other torrents. But anyway, I'll seed once I'm done downloading. Hail Zen_Bud :D "
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-11-16T16:25Z,@n26_93 Is seems fine and OK :)

,ZamKhan,2012-11-16T17:24Z,"Any Chance of a 720p version,
I absolutely loved your rip of Intouchables
and Moneyball so I know you do great work...
Keep it up..."
,dee60,2012-11-16T18:15Z,Thanks for sharing.
,mbzyz,2012-11-16T19:04Z,"ha ha so you do listen to me.  i see you're finally improving your audio quality a little.

still your video bitrate is too low.  both KiNGDOM and ViSiON 720p BRRips look better than your overy compressed 1080p ""BluRay"".

eventually you will learn the errors of your ways."

oooppppppps NADA "
,mbzyz,2012-11-17T01:05Z,"your 1080p releases look worse than other groups' 720p releases.  

look at your 1080p release of Ted:

compared to KiNGDOM's 720p:

1080p resolution is meaningless if you don't have an adequate bitrate."
,adhyaksha,2012-11-17T01:09Z,"mbzyz - you are a fucking troll...shameless fellow commenting on anoXmous and Zen_Bud....what gives you the right to comment here. If you have no work, put a gun in your ass hole and pull the trigger..the world will be rid of trolls like you. Hail anoXmous and Zen_Bud...we bow to you...the best uploaders out there...ignore these trolls and carry on your outstanding work....Thanks much !"
,spaga_,2012-11-17T03:47Z,"video and audio are shit, waste of bandwidth"
,[qusawa],2012-11-17T04:19Z,"Video: 10/10

Top notch :)

THX for upload will seed !"
,mnbbvi,2012-11-17T07:16Z,Screenshot plz
,ashi_army,2012-11-17T15:33Z,The subtitles are out of Sync after 2:07 hrs..Any comments
,banzai014,2012-11-18T03:31Z,can you go back to 720p?
,red2silver,2012-11-18T15:16Z,"The audio is quite good. A=9.
Video is also good, but @ one scene where Gordon is forced to walk on ice, just when he lights the flare there are clear compression artefacts, almost spanning the whole screen
V=7"
,Atamenes,2012-11-18T15:41Z,I second red2silver. I wonder if Zen_Bud can ask anoXmous to re-encode this movie because I want to collect 2008's TDK and 2012's TDKR that show the IMAX scenes in its proper format. I tried to check the version encoded by YIFY but only the 2012's TDKR comes with the IMAX scenes intact. YIFY's TDK is cropped so I can't get enjoy the IMAX scenes.
,shaaani,2012-11-21T07:45Z,"@Atamenes
ur mistaken Yify's both 720p and 1080p releases have IMAX scenes, no cropping, bcoz if he cropped it the resolution would be like this 1280x544 / 1920x800"
,Atamenes,2012-11-21T13:37Z,"@shaaani

I noticed that only YIFY's Dark Knight Rises (720p and 1080p) have the IMAX scenes.

YIFY's Dark Knight (only available in 1080p) has the IMAX scenes cropped.

That's why I wish that Zen_Bud could request  anoXmous to re-encode the video to fix the problem."
,MoviesR101,2012-11-21T16:03Z,"Thanks!

@ Atamenes - Can you explain what you mean, when you say cropped? I think YIFY's copies are always in IMAX form?"
,Uuganaa,2012-11-21T21:21Z,"around 2:06 few seconds missed, that's why after that subtitle's going out of sync"
,Atamenes,2012-11-22T14:28Z,"@MoviesR101

Here is what I noticed:

The Dark Knight (2008) rip by YIFY (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6923245/The_Dark_Knight_(2008)_1080p_BluRay_x264_-_1.7GB_-_YIFY) lists the video resolution at 1920x800.

Meanwhile, The Dark Knight Rises (2012) rip by YIFY (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7830983/The_Dark_Knight_Rises_(2012)_1080p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY) lists the video resolution at 1920x1080.

The difference of 280 pixels is the reason why I realize that YIFY's encode for The Dark Knight cropped the IMAX scenes.

I hope this clarifies the difference between YIFY's encode for TDK and TDKR."
,bobbyGa,2012-11-22T17:47Z,"always download & appreciate Zen_Bud and anoXmous' work. however for this series I've gone with MXMG encodes: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6578075/Batman_Begins_2005_BRRip_1080p_H264_DXVA_AAC-MXMG
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6588508/The_Dark_Knight_2008_BRRip_1080p_H264_DXVA_AAC-MXMG
Full IMAX scenes on TDK and quality on both is Outstanding."
,bobbyGa,2012-11-22T17:53Z,"noticed MXMG has uploaded in a while. so don't know whose TDKR to get yet.

Also wondering how everyone's uploading bluray rips when the bluray apparently releases in December: http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Dark-Knight-Rises-Blu-ray/21212/#Review

unless they've got hold of promo/press copies."
,Atamenes,2012-11-23T15:45Z,"Oh well,

Might as well download MXMG encode for spares. At least I could get the rips with consistent quality in 1080p.

Let's hope MXMG will rip TDKR in December."
