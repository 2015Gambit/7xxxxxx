,JoaoPauloBR,2012-11-19T12:28Z,STFU fishboy11 at least he gave us something usefull motherfucker
,vatel88,2012-11-19T13:47Z,"@joao Stfu, Fishboy is right this assclown is using a pretty much identical webclone of the actual skidrow website. Can't call this something useful unless you cna confirm its valid and legit content and sending you to a fake ass website doesnt help this skidrow'z' asshat's case much. "

,aremic,2012-11-20T02:18Z,"I take that back. Got it to work by following the EXACT steps from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7839514/Assassins_Creed_III_RePack-RG_Mechanics

-starting uplay first, let it update, THEN move over the crack (after making an account). Whewwwww"
,ja7ba,2012-11-20T05:54Z,im having a problem: after doing every instruction and playing the game (it starts and works in russian) everytime i put in the localization.lang from this torrent the game wont start anymore and when i put back the russian version it starts working i went to the game with my russian friend and there was no other languages other than russian in the settings what do i do?
,goldr4ke,2012-11-20T09:50Z,"@ja7ba Copy the localization.lang file to the main folder, then launch AC3SP.exe in the same folder, uplay will validate english version of the game the same way he did russian before."

,dis_dat,2012-11-23T13:59Z,"Hello!

I lost my savefile earlier and I cannot get it back. I was at Sequence 9 when uplay.exe crashed and deleted my temporarly access to AC3.

So, if anyone out there is currently on sequence 9, or around 9, it'd be SO so so so awesome if you could send it too me so I dont have to do it ALL over again! >.< I'd appreciate it ALOT!

Thanks!"
