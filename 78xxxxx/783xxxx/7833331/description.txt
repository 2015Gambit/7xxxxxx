Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 24 (Broken Homes):

The news in the last 2 weeks were dominated by the scandal of Gen. Petraeus, the ex. army General and ex. CIA director, who was involved in a love triangle with two married women. The affair was exposed when the two women started competing for his affection and loyalty, and one of them sent threatening emails to the other.

All the parties involved in the Petraeus affair were married with children, and they displayed little or no respect towards: their spouses, their children, the sanctity of marriage, the 10 Commandments, the teachings of the Bible, or the integrity and reputation of the institution they belong to. Their marriages may survive divorce, but the damage is already done and it is irreparable. 

Infidelity is one of the major causes of broken homes. Other causes include: domestic violence, sexual abuse, alcoholism, drugs, economical problems, .. ; all of these are chronic problems in the Western civilization.
