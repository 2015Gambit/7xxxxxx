,starman63,2012-11-19T07:18Z,Great books!!!  Thanks ... Can you get Crossfire The plot to kill Kennedy by Jim Marrs??
,Minerva7101,2012-11-19T14:58Z,"Number 9 is not about the SAS, it's another book called ""How hard can it be"". Do you have the real one?"
,Minerva7101,2012-11-19T15:53Z,"And I forgot to say, thanks for all these latest history uploads! Really appreciate it!!"
[T],spanikopita,2012-11-20T01:16Z,"Goodreads fail. Sorry. I do not have the real one. Just the nasty, falsely identified romance novel.

Minerva7101, the next History 10 Pack is for you by way of apology."
[T],spanikopita,2012-11-20T03:11Z,"starman63...I can't find it anywhere. I suggest posting the request on forum.suprbay.org. I looked everywhere and found pretty much everything else written by Marrs, but not Crossfire."
,Minerva7101,2012-11-20T11:56Z,"Ok, thanks anyway! No apology needed, it wasn't your fault."
