Hi there
How are you doing mates ?
Hopefully fine anyway,huh ? :)
Here is our new remastered version of "no country for old men" as BrDrip to H.263 codec due to the relative flop of our previous torrent about.
This new one gets a smaler size like less than 10 gb.
However US English and French spoken language will be only available now.
US English is available only as subtitle.
Good quality as very acceptable bdrip for you now.
Please mates,don't leave so fast our seed when you have finished your download and don't be so egoist as well.
Help us to keep alive our seeds 'cause we might deciding to leave TPB also in this way if we don't have enough seeders as back up anyway.
We don't say that to all 'cause few guys are still pretty cool and nice and try to stay for continuing to seed with us as long as they can.
So we would like to say a big thx to them for their cooperation to this topic anyway.
Ty for understanding.
We don't force you to do it but it could be pretty nice to see more help from your part to reinforce our seeds so.
@utorrent users :
We strongly encourage you to update/upgrade and use latest utorrent 3.2.2_28500 last stable build for best results and best stability with most of trackers that we usualy use for seeding so.
@Bitorrent users : same for latest bitorrent 7.7.2_28499 build as well.
