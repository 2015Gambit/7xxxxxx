Summary:
--------
Dark times threaten to find their way into the very heart of Camelot as Morgana and Queen Guinevere, still a puppet under the sorceress' grip, conceive a perverse plan to murder the King.
However, when stable hand Tyr Seward becomes an unwilling player in their scheme, he might ruin their plans.
Will a suspicious Merlin be able to discover the truth before it's too late?
