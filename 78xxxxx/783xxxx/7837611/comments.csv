,Taosinky,2012-11-18T16:32Z,"@kikman1968 : You dont wasting your time Bro. (: I never Upload Release i dont test by myself before. 

Just follow ALL THE STEPS (!) on the description without miss anything, and you will be able to play as long as you want.

And by the way, after level 16, you will need this mod (i forget to put into the torrent), this the [Unlimited Speed and realistic Physics for advanced trucks with 6x2 & 6x4 Engine]. 

Download it there (different mirror): 

1 : www.mediafire.*com/?6ctvuke8uf84ipm
2 : uptobox.*com/igyo8x2llse5
3 : qshnc8.1fichier.*com/

The torrent contain already the mod for [Unlimited Speed and realistic Physics for primary trucks with 4x2 Engine]."

Never tried a truck sim like this before but so far is quite fun! Could you tell me, what is the best mod site/forum for this game, and what is the relation between this and the Scania truck sim?"
,Teneom,2012-11-19T10:15Z,Herniator try this ; http://www.ets2mod.com

,c3dric,2012-11-23T00:48Z,"Yeaaaaaah you rocks dude! xD
I seed this game for 2 weeks. 1Mb/sec slot! (;

And additional information for all:
Don't forget to block ""ONLINE NEWS"" TOO !
This shit broke the game asking for KEY after some days playing.

1 -> Go to Settings (GAMEPLAY) 
2 -> UNCHECK -ONLINE NEWS-

Personally, I use web-radios stream without any problem (;
This don't affect installation game if you play connected to internet.

Cheers and vive la France lol :O)
(T'as assurĂŠ avec ce torrent mec!)"
,mtjoeng,2012-11-27T16:54Z,"I use 2 installations
1.1.1 & this 1.2.5
then, I can use the working Trainer 1.1.3
I start 1.1.1
add 4,000,000 EU
then play with 1.2.5

:)"
,mtjoeng,2012-11-27T16:56Z,"I mean Trainer 1.1.1 of course

NUM2 works when you ESC 
from a running truck 
(not in the startup interface)"
,mtjoeng,2012-11-27T16:58Z,"I mean trainer 1.1.1 of course

Num2 adds money when ESC 
from a running cockpit
(not from the startup interface) "
,TheSmokeyBloke,2012-11-29T20:11Z,"Hey uploader, can you please give me links to the mods you included with this torrent or upload them in a separate torrent. I can't find them on any websites. I already have the game so it would be a bit of a waste of bandwidth to have to download this whole torrent just for the mods."
,Taosinky,2012-11-29T23:00Z,"@TheSmokeyBloke : Seriously Smokey...the torrent weighs less than 600 Mo, there are 210 seeders for 5 leechers... you can download the game again. 

And if you want really only the mods, Just read the previous comment. (;"
