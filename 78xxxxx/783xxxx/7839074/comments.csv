Why the hell can't we just manually download torrrent files anymore?  Very stupid, piratebay."
,lordboy54,2012-11-19T16:48Z,"Awesome, works for real. Just follow instructions, no need to block uplay as far as I've noticed btw. Seems to only hinder it.

@leehwgoC

Get utorrent, it's probably just your current client being a failure."

,MikeyCorrupt,2012-11-21T01:38Z,wtstalin I am having the same problem as well with no spoken voice audio. IS anyone else having this problem and know of a fix?
,tantrix9,2012-11-21T17:33Z,"I am also having the same problem.  Game runs/looks great, but no spoken audio at all.  Tried changing it to the other languages other than English as well, still nothing.

Thank you for the crack, just hoping there is a fix for the no spoken audio :)"
