Husband-and-wife team Sam and Remi Fargo are intrigued when an archaeologist friend
requests their help excavating a top secret historical site.  What they find will
set them on a hunt for a prize greater than they could ever imagine.  The clues point
to the hidden tomb of Attila the Hun, the High King who was reportedly buried with a
vast fortune of gold and jewels and plunder . . . a bounty that has never been found.
As they follow the trail through Hungary, Italy, France, Russia, and Kazakhstan-a trail
that they discover leads them not to one tomb, but five-the Fargos will find themselves
pitted against a thieving group of amateur treasure hunters, a cunning Russian
businessman, and a ruthless Hungarian who claims direct descent from Attila himself
and will stop at nothing to claim the tombs' riches as his own.
