One of the most sought-after of the open-reel tapes produced by Barclay-Crocker in the 1980s, this vibrant and extremely colorful program brings together Morton Gould's Latin American Symphonette and Louis Moreau Gottschalk's A Night in the Tropics and his Grand Tarentelle for Piano & Orchestra. The performances by the Utah Symphony and conductor Maurice Abravanel were among the most scintillating recorded by Vanguard and have long been highly prized by audiophiles. This has been Dolby-B decoded from the BC tape.
