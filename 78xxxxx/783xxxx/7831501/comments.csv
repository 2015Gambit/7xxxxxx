Yeah, I know. But this is what you get for a re-rip (from a source 720p to a 720p again). If it is from a source 1080p to a 720p, it would slightly maintain a better quality.

I hate same dimension re-rip."

Audio is better than what PublicHD has out right now."
,ken.shinichi,2012-11-24T19:46Z,Is it supposed to have letter boxes (black parts on top and bottom of screen) for non-action scenes?
