Fresher than a new fibreglass body kit, MAXIMUM BASS TURBO is 3 discs of in-dash delight, armed with OVER SIXTY of the biggest urban-dance bangers under the hood.

Covering everything bottom heavy, Ministry of Sound dug deep, recruiting the biggest names in the game, with Hip Hop and Urban Pop prodigy G-Wizard taking charge of Disc 1, then UK underground breaks warrior Jaguar Skills tears up some fresh Bass, Electro and Dubstep on Disc 2, while Disc 3 is a massive hardstyle and energy rave mix from heavyweights Suae & Pulsar.

With tracks and remixes from Drake, Example, Lil Wayne, Afrojack, Justice Crew, Tyga, Knife Party, DJ Fresh, Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj and many more - this is the essential collection of street hardened bass jams for anyone who loves their music low and loud."
