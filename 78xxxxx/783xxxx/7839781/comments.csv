,Discolight,2012-11-19T13:52Z,"Hmm, i saw Randy was going for his Punt Kick, but i thought that move was suspended for long time ago? 

but first of all i want to know, is his Punt kick suspended or not? he have try to go for it like 2-3 times this year. i think it suspended for over a year ago. sry, for saying this here. but i love Randy, and if that move is suspended, and he hits someone with it, maybe he will be gone. "

,hawkenstein,2012-11-20T05:15Z,"disco, the punt was suspended but it's since been repealed, and you should worry more about Orton getting one more wellness strikes since he is on two and one more is fired for a year at least"
