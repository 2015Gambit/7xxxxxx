The series followed the adventures of Hiccup and his dragon, Toothless, as they and their friends of Berk learn exactly how to train their dragons. There are many adventures between them, and along the way many fun and heartwarming moments.

 The series, unlike most television adaptations of films, is made wiht the highest quality in mind in terms of both animation and storytelling. The series retains many voice actors from the original movie, and almost all the animators.

It's Tv ripped and it's my first uploud so please be gentle and wnjoy the rare episode of riders of berk.
