,cindy25,2012-11-29T14:52Z,do these have English subs? 
,cindy25,2012-11-30T05:32Z,"unfortunately these are in Italian (as they should be) with Russian dubbing over the Italian, and with no subs. even if one knew Italian or Russian it would be impossible to understand

this is unfortunate, as this is a great series.  what we need is the SBS (Australian TV) English hard subbed release "
