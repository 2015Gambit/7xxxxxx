Seasick Steve ΓÇô A sixty-seventy-something year old (ex)-Hobo from Mississippi who over the last 5 years or so has gone from zero to hero. I guess it must have a lot to do with how authentic he is, as far removed from the ΓÇ£popΓÇ¥ scene as possible, apparently he still lives in a banged out old camper that heΓÇÖs had forever. The only difference is that now itΓÇÖs full of Jack Daniels Whiskey cosΓÇÖ they wanted to sponsor him.
