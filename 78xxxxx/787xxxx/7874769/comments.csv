,helpFG,2012-12-01T06:27Z,"Stop advertising for WMI website if you are a real Fan of FG
Why is there no link to Fame Girls Website?
Do you know that Fame-Girls does not want their sets posted here? 
It's simple for even crooks to understand.......Stop plugging WMI and no trouble here."
,hotjoke,2012-12-01T10:22Z,"Welcome back Mr who
Where were you man? I was worried about you.
and thanks for your great work"
[T],webmodelsindex,2012-12-02T00:31Z,"@helpFG

You make it sound like WMI is doing illegal shit with the Fame-Girls sets. He doesn't. He gives reviews and small previews for released sets. He is advertising FOR Fame-Girls. Basically, he does what you do, but isn't a tool about it."
,33wearhilton41,2012-12-02T08:20Z,hear hear
,Holy Divr,2012-12-02T11:16Z,Thanks for these FG sets Mr Who. You had me worried there for a bit. Thought maybe you'd abandoned us XD

,helpFG,2012-12-03T05:07Z,"Webmodelsindex and Whoishe,  can we not do this all over again?

Just leave out the advisements for WMI, and the links to other than FG websites.  Then we are all good, and the fine work you do here (resizing) can go on without interference.  

Please........be reasonable."
[T],webmodelsindex,2012-12-03T06:48Z,"Wait wait wait. You used to advocate for the Fame-Girls site, how pirating their sets were a bad thing. WMI gives reviews, not full sets, just previews. Now he's the evil one, and you're saying that pirating the sets are okay? I think you should change your username buddy, because it's a contradiction.

Btw, did you see the latest blog post on wminews? It's a good read."
