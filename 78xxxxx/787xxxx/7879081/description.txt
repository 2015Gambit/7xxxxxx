SUMMARY:

A drug dealer becomes interested in death and re-incarnation after reading "The Tibetan Book of the Dead". 

Suddenly dead, his soul floats through Tokyo observing the dramas of his friends and foes. An oath determines his next step 'as a soul'.


PLOT:

Tokyo's nasty underside, seen primarily through the eyes of Oscar, a heavy drug user, whose sister Linda is a stripper. Oscar also has flashbacks to his childhood when trauma upends the siblings. Oscar's drug-fed hallucinations alter Tokyo's already-disconcerting nights, and after the police shoot him, he can float above and look down: on his sister's sorrow, on the rooms of a love hotel, and on life 
at even a molecular level. The spectrum's colors can be beautiful; it's people's colorless lives that can be ugly. 

And what of afterlife, is there more than a void? 

Enjoy as always'
