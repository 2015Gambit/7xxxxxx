I want you to know that I appreciate your work and I want to make peace. You made your point, I made mine. Let's make an agreement on sharing our ups and let's be friends. I hope this time you'll shake my hand. If you want to do so (or otherwise), please reply in one of my latest posts. If you don't, never mind. At least I`ve tried. Peace, bro! For sure, I'm not your enemy, never was. Cheers, bro!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-12-03T09:10Z,"Great, man! Then, friends will be! :) And thank you for your great words! It's my pleasure to be your friend. Also you're a BB legend too, man, with your love for the NBA and your fastness.
Now, how about, who wakes up first (with the russians) :) chooses what will upload (60fps or 30 fps with 540p)? Separately for the early games (by the East Coast time zone. Ex: 12:00, 1:00 ET etc, anyway until 7:00 ET), which has the same rule. The other picks the remaining version. What do you think about that? Or, if you have another suggestion, I like to hear it. Thank you!
I'm waiting your reply. Cheers, brotha!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-12-03T10:35Z,"Like a friendship sign, 60fps version for you it is. But for the early games on sunday or saturday (Ex: PHX@NYK from yesterday), first come, first served. Ok?

God bless you, my friend!"
