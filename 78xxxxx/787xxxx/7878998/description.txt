Bomb the Music Industry! - To Leave or Die in Long Island (Vinyl Rip) (FLAC)

This vinyl was ripped as signed 24 bit pcm .wav files, then converted to 0% compression FLAC using dBpoweramp. If you have any suggestions for ripping vinyls please leave a comment. 

It has not been edited for pop/click/noise reduction. If it bothers you then you may do so.
