Fusion CMS V6 is a content management system (website) for your private World of Warcraft server. It supports multiple emulators such as Arcemu, Mangos, Trinity, SummitEmu, Skyfire, etc. It has a GM ticket manager, working Armory, private messages, and more.

This version has had the license requirement removed so you can install it without a license. When installing and it asks for a license you can just click "next". There is a license key inside "FusionCMS License.txt" if you wish to use it. It has also had the encrypted files decrypted and the backdoor "unauthorized use" shutdown ability removed as well as the "this domain does not have a license" protection removed.
