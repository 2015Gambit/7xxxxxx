,MiGKiller29,2012-12-02T01:47Z,Thank you!
,Manhole45,2012-12-02T15:44Z,"Is anyone else seemingly missing some sounds and/or effects?  Going by their other P51, this one seems less featured.  I don't get the thumps when the controls hit the stops, the panel doesn't shake when starting (and all the lights seem to come on when it does). Plus various other sounds seem to be missing.

Does it sound like Accusim didn't install correctly?  Has anyone else encountered this problem?"
,skouras555,2012-12-02T18:45Z,go to the forum and install the latest patch
,Pat91fr,2012-12-02T19:07Z,Thanks for this. I encountered the same problem as Manhole45. I rĂŠinstalled the accusim package but it's still the same.
,Pat91fr,2012-12-02T19:38Z,"When you go to the shift+3 key menu, and you try to modify the ""Damage"" option, it tells you that there is no accusim installed. Any idea ?"
,Pat91fr,2012-12-03T15:35Z,"I installed the latest patch ans it's work !!
