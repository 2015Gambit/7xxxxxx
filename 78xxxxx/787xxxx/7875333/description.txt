divining, healing, and decision making. Learn how to make a pendulum and harness its power for gaining insight into the future.
 
Healing Magick: The practice of blending magick with healing is older than recorded history. Learn the most effective magickal means of restoring or achieving good health, using spells, rituals, affirmations, 
visualizations, herbs, talismans and amulets, and runes.
