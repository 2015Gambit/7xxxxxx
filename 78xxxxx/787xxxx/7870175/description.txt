Starring The Shadow, The Green Hornet, Kato, and The Spider, in a story that only Dynamite could tell! Before superheroes, there were Masks! They've always said it can't happen here--but what if it did? It's 1938, and the Justice Party has swept into office in New York State. But the newly-elected officials are in the control of powerful criminals, who quickly corrupt the law to their own advantage. When a fascist police state is instituted, the only ones who stand in defense of the innocent are masked vigilantes like the Shadow, the Green Hornet, Kato, and the Spider. Also, look forward to future appearances of Black Bat, Miss Fury, Black Terror, Green Lama and more! When the law is unjust, justice must be an outlaw!
