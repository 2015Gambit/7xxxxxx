With "Lost In The Humming Air - Music inspired by
Harold Budd" we are proud to announce an amazing
collection of thirteen exclusive tracks made by a
selection of some of todays best known ambient music
producers giving their tribute to the outstanding
piano legend Harold Budd. Well known for his spaceful
piano playing and his early cooperations with Brian
Eno, Harold Budd has inspired a whole generation of
modern protagonists of ambient, jazz and especially
the so called modern classical genre. With his recent
releases on David Sylvians Samadhi Sound label as well
as on Darla, he is still showing his outstanding
musical genius to the world.
