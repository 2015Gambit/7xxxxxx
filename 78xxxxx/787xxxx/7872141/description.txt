POtHS Comments on This one:  The Time is getting close.

Description:

Let us prepare and ready ourselves for the time to end all sorrows is closing fast.  The more the merrier and the better we shall all be.  The 2nd Covenant shall soon be fulfilled; do not linger nor tarry, remaining indecisive or negligent only hurts yourself and loved ones.  It's time to dress ourselves in the Lord's sword, sheild and breastplate of the Holy Word of God as we anticipate our futures to bring forth the Last Generation.
