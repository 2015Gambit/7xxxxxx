I dont think many people want to use software just for the sake of using software. You probably didnt learn to drive just because you thought seatbelts and turn signals were cool; Im betting you wanted to be able to get around in a car. People use SketchUp so that they can build 3D models. As such, most of this book focuses on what you can do with SketchUp, and not what SketchUp does.
