BBC The Royal Society of Edinburgh Christmas Lecture 2011 To the Ends of the Earth: Scotland's Global Diaspora x264 AAC MVGroup

Professor Tom Devine delivered the prestigious RSE Christmas Lecture 2011, where he explored the puzzles of Scottish migration in the Victorian era.

The Scots have long been one of Europe's greatest emigrant peoples. In the nineteenth and yearly twentieth centuries the Scottish exodus reached truly unprecedented proportions. Yet this was also an era of remarkable material and social transformation in Scotland as the nation became one of the most prosperous on earth during the Victorian decades. Why then were so many Scots leaving the country of their birth to make new lives in the New World at a rate only paralleled by emigration from some of Europe's poorest countries? This lecture will confront this intriguing and challenging puzzle and comes up with some surprising answers.
