Took me 24 hours to dl average speeds of 100 kB/s but fluctuated from 50-400 kB/s which isn't bad for a new torrent. REMEBER TO SEED EVEN WHEN YOU FINISH DLING JUST LET YOUR TORRENT CLIENT RUN WHILE YOU PLAY FAR CRY 3.

Remember report back here with your results and specs as I posted.

Thank you BlackBox for a great release with 0 problems unlike other unnamed skull Far Cry 3 releases.

The popup dialog for the error is labeled as ISDone.dll. The content of the error message is as follows : 
An error occurred while unpacking: Unable to write data to disk! 
Unarc.dll returned an error code: 11. 
ERROR: file write operation failed

Unsure as to how to solve the problem. I suppose it's possible the download was just corrupted somehow, am currently trying to download again, but a solution would be nice."
,phat_71,2012-11-30T22:28Z,"Problem retracted. 

For anyone else who ever happens to experience such a problem, apparently it's due to the nature of unarchiving and installing. There needs to be a certain amount of free space beyond the amount required for the installation. I just needed to free up a little bit and presto, it works."

Uninstall game and then uninstall uplay as its another app. Reinstall as its pre cracked it should work just block the game in your firewall so it doesn't try to connect to uplay as this has know to cause bugs in game.  The release is fine and as I have sated had 0 problems not even crashing. I can even alt tab while from what IV read no one can do oddly.

,partyhardy247,2012-12-01T14:39Z,"Thanks mrGREEK360 for your answer.  Really appreciate it.  

@Dimmis80: To block a program in firewall, follow these steps.  I got this from google search a while ago.  It may look like a long step but it really isn't.  It will take you 5 min to do the first try but after that, only 30 sec~1 min if you have to block another program in the future.

1. Press the key combination Windows logo key + R to open the Run dialog.

2. Type wf.msc in the Run dialog and press Enter. This would open the Windows Firewall with Advanced Secruity window.

3. Click on the Outbound Rules in the left side menu in the Windows Firewall window,

4. Click on the New Rule... on the right side menu,

5. In the New Outbound Rule Wizard, select Program in Rule Type window and click Next,

6. In the Program window, either manually type the full path and file name of the program you want to block, or click on the Browse button to browse the program file. Click Next to continue.

7. In the Action window, select Block the connection and click Next,

8.  In the Profile window, select all options and click Next,

10.  In the Name window, give a name to the new rule like Block Explorer.exe and click Finish"
