Story:

The film is about Abir Roy a.k.a. Khoka/Khokababu (Dev) who is a cool and a clever guy. Shankar Das a.k.a. Bhaiji (Ferdous) is a well-known don in his territory whom everybody fears and obeys. Khoka joins Bhaiji's circle as an accountant where he has a wacky senior Khanra Babu (Subhashish Mukherjee). Khoka with his super wit starts to obtain every luxury that a perfect office should have and starts to hoax Bhaiji. Problems occur when Khoka falls in love with Bhaiji's sister Pooja (Subhasree Ganguly). Anyone who even looks in her direction is simply dealt with in the cruellest possible way. Khoka somehow manages to win over Pooja and also gains the complete trust of Bhaiji by changing the system in which his business operates. Bhaiji asks him to look after Pooja as he considers his other employees to be incapable. Khoka and Pooja fall in love with each other and even get secretly married. She even goes to his house to stay for 3 days as Bhaiji's rival Ballu (Ashish Vidyarthi) is after her life. Bhaiji is completely unaware of Khoka and Pooja's relation, however he does come to know about it later. Can their love survive when Bhaiji is over-possessive about his sister and goons like Ballu are on the loose to take revenge from Bhaiji by killing his sister Pooja? That's how our super-clever Chalu Cheez Khokababu takes the story ahead.
