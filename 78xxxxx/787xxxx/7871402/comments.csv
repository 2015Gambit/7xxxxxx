,Coltbear50,2012-11-30T05:27Z,"THANKS very much for this score... Carter Burwell is one of the most underrated and outstanding cinema theme composers alive, and he deserves a much larger audience.  He's not too fond of self-marketing, however, and he prefers to let his audience ""feel"" his music.  And that they do!  A truly unique and remarkable composer.

Once again, thanks for this, and ""Happy Holidays!"""
