The game installs fine, launches fine, But when the intro clip is supposed to play I only get the sound. The game outputs no video - just a black screen, however I can hear the audio going under it.
Now I have had similar problem with Torchlight 2, Turned out it was trying to output 600-some fps to my 60 Hertz monitor. That one got solved with v-sync. However I can't seem to find a way to set a fps-cap on this game.
It doesn't crash, freeze or BSOD. When I launch it it boots all good and goes all blackscreen on me. When I alt-tab out of the game and then back in I see a flash of (I assume) main menu. That has me believe it is an fps-over-the-top issue.
Any ideas how (where) to set a fps cap?
and Yes I did set my CCC v-sync settings to 'always on' - didn't help. 
Anyone?"
