Far Cry 3 returns the series to a tropical island setting, similar to the
first game and unlike the second game, which took place in an African
savanna setting. Players will assume the role of protagonist Jason Brody, a
tourist who has been stranded on an island chain in the grips of violent
local conflict for years.

Jason has been separated from his girlfriend and, in his search for her, he
will have to deal with a wide cast of mostly unstable characters who have
been on these islands for some time..

norwegian, swedish, danish, polish, dutch or portuguese

Note: This selector is NOT required in order to enjoy the game. We just
decided to release it so that our foreign speaking friends can
enjoy the game in their language in an easy and quick way. It launches
the game in offline mode default. To set the language permanently, you
can add -language <LANGUAGE> to the game exe shortcut instead.
