""Naruto Shippuden: Blood Prison full movie 720p HD

Video: 720x480""

............................

720x480 is not 720p. It's standard DVD NTSC resolution. However, note that your screenshots are 848x480. 

720p/1080p refer to the height of the frame, not its width. Your frame height is 480 pixels."
