Sacrilegium created in 1993 is one of the best polish black metal bands. Originators of the Sacrilegium were Nantur Aldaron and Suclagus. Their first realase was "Sleeptime" mc demo. After that, Sacrilegium made a contract with Pagan Records, nowaday's cult polish underground label. "Sleeptime" was realeased once again as a MCD in Poland ( Pagan rec ) and USA ( Wild Rags rec. ) in 1994. "Sleeptime" sounds very "norwegian", like early (black metal ).
