The V-Station is a polyphonic soft-synth for Mac and PC. It has the
same real 3-oscillator flexibility as the award winning K-Station,
with powerful filters, 8-voice polyphony, simultaneous Novation FX

Programming V-Station is simple. All the primary controls are on
the main screen. Recall a named factory preset, tweak it and
instantly save it in any of the 400 program locations. You┬üfll find
additional functions and controls on three further tabs.
