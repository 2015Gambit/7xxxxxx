Bass Station
Novation launched the original Bass Station in 1993 and it became an instant favourite. Its digital oscillators and analogue filter defined countless dance and electronic hits of the 1990s.

Now a classic, its available as a software plug-in that has been carefully modelled to recreate the distinctive analogue-digital character of the original.
