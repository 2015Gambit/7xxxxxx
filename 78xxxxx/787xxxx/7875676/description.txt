A handful of members from the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America are plucked from their time period and brought to the 30th Century. They find that the one behind their transport is none other than Mordru, a dread wizard from the future that is a continuous foe of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Mordru tells the collected heroes that he tried to grab three ancient, mystic artifacts instead of the heroes. He tried to force the Legion of Super-Heroes to gather the artifacts, but they fought him off instead. Now he's forcing the members of the Justice League and the Justice Society to get the artifacts by holding two of their members hostage. They gather the three items and Mordru reveals that the they summon the Demons Three. Intending to use them as his servants, the Demons Three turn the tables on Mordru and attack him.
