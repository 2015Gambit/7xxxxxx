,pilotdude,2012-12-02T03:44Z,"I'll post the same remarks here that I posted about FS2Crew for the NGX since they both seem to use the same anti-piracy system.

Warning!  Disable your internet every time you use this program.

It's collecting your IP address.

I read in the FS2Crew forum on Avsim a lot of guys are getting busted for piracy because of this.

But what's the worst you're going to get?  A letter in the mail from your ISP?

What can they do?"
