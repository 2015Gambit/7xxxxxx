Win 7 Orb changer+PirateSkull

DO you want a neat pirates Skull for your Start Button in Windows 7
just download to C:
and run the exe. and select the My Skull PNG and now you have a cool
Orb note.. Classic theme uses all 3 images but Aero seems to use just
the normal image and the glow image when clicked
so classic theme uses the hover image as well

Not my program or hack but I did modify the Skull for my liking.

Enjoy and SEED

ps Alpha program is a video editor to alter some graphic issues 
so converting to PNG worked but wont need it unless your making your own BMPs
for own ORB

PSS I suspect it works in vista and Win 8 but not tested or theres a upgrade to the
installer hack program perhaps?
