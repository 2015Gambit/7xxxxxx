This is the complete Lou Reed Studio discography from 1972's "Lou Reed" and "Transformer" to 2012's collaboration album "Lulu" with Metallica. This also includes 1974's live album "Rock 'n' Roll Animal" for no reason other than it probably being Lou Reed's finest live album to date, especially when paired with 1975's "Lou Reed Live".

Made this since there really weren't any decent Lou Reed Discography torrents around.
