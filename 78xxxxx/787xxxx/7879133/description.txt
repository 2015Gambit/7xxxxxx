iTunes 11 Portable edition.

File I uploaded is an SFX Archive (self-extracting archive). Simply open it and it will extract itself. 

Files in the sfx archive are iTunes.exe and iTunes.dat. 
run the exe and iTunes will open.

the first thing that will open is windows installer and it will "repair or setup" iTunes for your computer. this process will only happen once, as it is extracting files to the newly created iTunes folder.

When iTunes opens you will receive an error:
"In order to play movies, this computer requires Quicktime, which is not included in this version of iTunes"
Simply hit ok and iTunes will be open for whatever suits your purpose.


I Cannot seed this file forever, my internet connection is limited to 75kbps, and is not 24/7. 

so... SEED SEED SEED!!!

and please do not hesitate to comment about any problems you run into.
