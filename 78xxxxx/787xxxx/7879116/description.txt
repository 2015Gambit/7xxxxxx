Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging is now used by the department of defense and many of the worldΓÇÖs largest retailers including Wal-Mart. As RFID continues to infiltrate industries worldwide, organizations must harness a clear understanding of this technology in order to maximize its potential and protect against the potential risks it poses.
The RFID Handbook provides an overview of RFID technology, its associated security and privacy risks, and recommended practices that will enable organizations to realize productivity improvements while also protecting sensitive information and the privacy of individuals.

Expert contributors present a host of applications including RFID enabled automated receiving, triage with RFID for massive incidents, RFID and NFC in relation to mobile phones, and RFID technologies for communication robots and a privacy preserving video surveillance system. The unprecedented coverage also includes detailed descriptions of adaptive splitting protocols as well as tree-based and probabilistic anti-collision protocols.                                                                                                                       
Drawing on its distinguished editors and world-renowned contributors, this one-of-a-kind handbook serves as the ultimate reference on RFID, from basic research concepts to future applications.
