,blogcb,2012-12-02T22:20Z,Has anyone been able to download this?  I've had it going for 4 hours and nothing has been downloaded yet.
,ajsztehlo,2012-12-03T00:15Z,"Thanks for contacting me @blogcb. I am actually going to cancel my account and start again, I'll reupload this later on. Give me a few days and I'll have the kinks worked out. I've only just started torrenting!"
,Synthesist,2012-12-03T04:03Z,"So, what you are not saying here... this torrent is dead and invalid."
,Synthesist,2012-12-03T04:20Z,How's that new torrent coming mate?
,ajsztehlo,2012-12-03T05:01Z,"Hi all, the current plan is: I will leave this up for a few more days. Today or tomorrow I will delete these torrents and then, under a new account (cbrupload) I will re-upload. I think the problem was that there were no trackers added, sorry for the wait guys! A fixed copy will be up soon."
,Synthesist,2012-12-03T08:31Z,It appears to have worked.  I have (and am seeding) a complete copy.  Thank you.
,Synthesist,2012-12-03T08:39Z,"OK.. to append (and add to) my previous comments...  Each archive (cbr) refused to open by regular means. (I have them set to open with CDisplay via double click; a right click can extract them via secondary association with WinRAR)  Extracted each to its own folder and re RAR'd the jpgs.  No Problem :)  Though in each foldered archive was a ""__MACOSX"" folder containing incomplete versions of the jpgs."
,ajsztehlo,2012-12-03T10:51Z,"@Synthesist: Ah yes, sorry about that- I think that automatically happens on anything repackaged on a Mac. Had no idea why it managed to start working though... odd. Enjoy the comics!"
