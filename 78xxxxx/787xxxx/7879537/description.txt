RELEASE NOTES
 
A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new
 vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures,
 psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm
 them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player
 co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the
 undiscovered and unpredictable living planet.
 
Features:
 
All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes
 including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin.
 Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow
 him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that,
 you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you
 ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers?
 Of course Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if thats your thing Want to try
 other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to
 choose from
 
Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both
 online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling
 you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to
 restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from
 any game to any other
 
World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra
 of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose
 the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the
 perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious
 Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the
 opening of the Vault.)
 
87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will
 lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods
 and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton
 of loot
 
Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new
 areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever From the arctic tundra,
 through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns
 to beyond, you'll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at
 every turn
 
Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill
 you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious
