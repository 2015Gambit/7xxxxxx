,Jacques,2012-12-01T20:02Z,FYI. NoteBurner is the only util (and I have tried several both PC and Mac) that has been able to successfully remove the annoying DRM from the movies I have bought in Apples iTunes Store.
,h4rb1ng3r,2012-12-02T02:05Z,My bad. Commented on wrong torrent by mistake. Yeah the other 1.5gig torrent is unwatchable. 
,sk876,2012-12-02T03:20Z,Its choppy because its HD. I converted it to avi and it worked just fine.
,neekz,2012-12-02T04:28Z,"I doubt it's so, My computer jams 1080p like butter... My guess is 1080p + fraps = stutter... If anybody wants I can get a 720p stutter free version for you HD heads..."
,jinsk8r,2012-12-02T08:08Z,"Good RIP. DVD Format.
