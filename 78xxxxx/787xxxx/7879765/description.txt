Roughly 200,000 fonts gleaned from various torrents, plus font managers for Windows and Mac. Divided by format; see font list.txt.

DO NOT INSTALL ALL THESE FONTS AT ONCE. It's... interesting that I have to say this, but it seems some people have tried with previous collections. Doing so will make your computer very slow at best and destroy your OS at worst. Install one of the font managers, explore the fonts, and only install what you need.

The fonts have been scanned for duplicates by name and content, but there are far too many to check by hand, so no guarantees.

Enjoy!
