Did you know having sex an average of four times a week can make you look 7 to 12 years younger? Or that having sex three times a week cuts your risk in half for heart attack and strokes.
ItΓÇÖs true!
According to a study at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital in Scotland, men who reported having sex an average of four times per week looked approximately 10 years younger than they really were.
And a study at QueenΓÇÖs University in Belfast in 1997 showed men who reported the highest frequency of orgasm enjoyed a death rate half that of men who only occasionally had sex.
Kind of makes you stop and think doesnΓÇÖt it?
