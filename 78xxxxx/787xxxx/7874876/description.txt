Overview:

Discover the New World and fulfill your Manifest Destiny!

The New World lies before you with all its peril, promise, and infinite possibility: your colonists anxiously follow you to shore and the treasures of an entire continent await you. But beware of your enemies! Angry natives and rival powers can encroach upon your territory. You'll have to overcome your foes with superior military strategy and wily diplomacy. Only then can you launch your revolution and declare your independence.

Players control either English, French, Dutch, or Spanish colonists in the New World. This New World can be the historically accurate Americas (North and South) or a randomly generated world with varying resources and challenges. Overseeing economic, military, and political growth, you strive to establish independence from the mother country while competing with other colonies for control of the New World.

Plant a foothold in the New World and establish your independence in Sid MeierΓÇÖs Colonization!
