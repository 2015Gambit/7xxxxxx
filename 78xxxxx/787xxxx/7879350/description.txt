In this comprehensive introduction to the powerful Zend Framework, I'll show you how to use all of the features you'll actually want to use within your own websites, including how to effectively manage your configuration data, build rock-solid model-based web forms, take advantage of the powerful Doctrine 2 ORM, send e-mails through your website using Zend_Mail, manage user registrations, logins, and recover forgotten passwords.

We'll start right at the beginning, showing you how to use the ZF command-line tool to create your first Zend Framework project, build actions, controllers, and models, and effectively manage your project views and layouts. From there you'll be provided with a comprehensive introduction to all of the framework's most important features (in addition to insight into key best practices such as unit testing and deployment), including:
