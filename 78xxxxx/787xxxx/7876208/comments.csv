,jKlark,2012-12-01T11:56Z,"I found out why i messed up this torrent, it's because i saved the .torrent file inside the folder, and then moved it elsewhere after uploading it. That's why the torrent gets stuck at 90.3%, even though the exe file downloads fully. :D

Anyways, the required file has been succesfully uploaded on both this & the v2 torrent. Hope you guys enjoy it!"
