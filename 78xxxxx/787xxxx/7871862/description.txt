Far Cry 3 is an open world first-person shooter, that also features role-playing game elements including experience points, skill tree and crafting system.
The player has the ability to shoot enemies behind objects in crouch mode based on experience points. 
The player will also have the ability to perform "takedowns" by performing melee attacks from above or in crouch mode. 
The game's narrative director, Jason Vandenberghe said that the story mode map will be around ten times larger than its previous installments, indicating that it is still an open world sandbox game.
