And for everyone out there with an AMD 2.4ghz processor......It's enough to run this game.  Just make sure you have a good graphics card.  I use the Radeon HD 4200 and it works just fine for me (on low settings that is)

Is a false positive (AV companies got PAID  to add these files to Black List)"
,vecuccio,2012-12-03T11:21Z,"Works works works ! Is v1.01.

Pity you have manually download the 2 patches from Depositfiles rather than a torrent. If you are not a member then you can add at least 12 hours wait time to play the game.

Remember to add to usual 2 DLLS - ubiorbitapi_r2.dll and ubiorbitapi_r2_loader.dll to your AV exception list, like someone else said, UBI paid your AV company to false positive these.
If you DON'T add exception to your AV then you will get the instant FATAL EXCEPTION error at startup."
