[T],spanikopita,2012-12-01T02:37Z,"Thanks vashts01. 

My pleasure. I hope you find some things of interest in here! I probably don't have as much as BBS or axiezxx, but if you have requests, I will always look for it."
,comedylover22,2012-12-01T06:10Z,first of all he gives shit for FREE and u cuss at him? Learn some manners! Thankyou whoever posted these books.
,lanterngr,2012-12-01T06:23Z,"Ignore the zip guy, why on EARTH would you want them zipped? I don't want all 500 some odd books, and I appreciate being able to pick and choose what i want, so thanks for doing it this way.

Zip it guy, you are an utter moron and a tosspot, die."
[T],spanikopita,2012-12-01T17:47Z,"lanterngr...thanks for posting your comment. Your feedback is assuring. It's nice to know people are finding value in these torrents.

If you browse through some of my older torrents (and as Rambam1776 knows), I am not physically able to do much. I like giving to people. If I have it, chances are I will give it to someone who needs it.

Thanks."
