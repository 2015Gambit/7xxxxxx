This is SDH release #889 for the Star Wars fans from a Star Wars fan. First aired and captured in H264 AVCHD at 8,000 kbps from the 1920 x 1080i HD resolution source on 12/01/2012 on the Cartoon Network HD channel on DirecTv HDTV Digital Satellite. Then converted to 1080p with Handbrake version 0.9.8. The Framerate is 29.970 with an average Video Bitrate of 6,000 kbps in a High Quality 688 MB 1080p H264 AVCHD MKV release with Dual Audio that is 48khz 448 kbps Dolby Digital 5.1 channel surround audio and 320 kbps AAC 2 channel stereo audio the total show runtime is 22 Minutes and 19 seconds long.

This is my 158th official H264 AVCHD release. Enjoy the Star Wars The Clone Wars show Star Wars fans. 

My 1080p releases are in MKV format with Dual Audio tracks Audio #1 is Dolby Digital 5.1 channel surround audio and Audio #2 is AAC 2 channel stereo audio so that they are playable with Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, and any other devices capable of playing 1080p HD MKV video files.

To ensure that you can get proper MKV playback after the mkv conversion be sure you have installed the K-lite codec pack full version or mega version both of which comes with Media Player Classic Home Cinema and configure it properly for .mkv playback. If you do not have it you can get it here below:

Once installed you can playback the .mkv file with the following players:

Media Player Classic or Windows Media Player. 

VLC player doesn't play the MKV video only the audio for some unknown reason, so use the above players or you can burn the .mkv video file to a DVD -R disc or load it onto a USB flash drive and play it back on any BluRay player that is MKV compatible and has a USB port like my Panasonic DMP BD75 BluRay player and LG BP-620 3D BluRay player does.
 
Enjoy the show Star Wars The Clone Wars fans and thanks for downloading my Star Wars The Clone Wars HDTV S05E10 1080p AVCHD-SC-SDH release.
