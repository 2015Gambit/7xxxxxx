Speedy Gonzales (commonly shortened to just Speedy) is an animated caricature of a mouse
in the Warner Brothers Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. He is
portrayed as 'The Fastest Mouse in all Mexico' with his major traits being the ability
to run extremely fast and speaking with an exaggerated Mexican accent. He usually wears
an oversized yellow sombrero, white shirt and trousers (Which is a common traditional
outfit worn by men and boys of rural Mexican villages), and a red kerchief, similar to
that of a reveler in the San Fermin festival. To date there have been 46 cartoons made
either starring or featuring this character.
