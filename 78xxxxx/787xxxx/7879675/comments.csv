,OnionRex,2012-12-02T21:10Z,"Why bother? Keys will be blacklisted.

Save yourself from babysitting your AV. Install Microsoft Security Essentials / Avast / Malwarebytes /etc. Subscription AV is useless."
,pipilikam,2012-12-03T05:15Z,Is it by default a 91 days trial version? or is it giving 91 days trial after entering the one year license key? Kindly anyone clarify.
,sniperboss86,2012-12-03T08:46Z,"it's a modifed version of kaspersky even the key is blacklisted, after installing this added 9 trojans scanned with malware bytes to my computer so the pc shutdowns automatically, had to use system restore to fix this...
just a warning before downloading this.."
,pipilikam,2012-12-03T11:57Z,Yes. Waste of time. It refused to uninstall and I had to use KAV remover tool to get it uninstalled. Don't use it at all.
