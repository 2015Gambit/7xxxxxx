Digitally remastered for CD (AAD) 1991  OJC limited edition series


Highly imaginative solo piano interpretations of Jerome Kern tunes.



"After listening and re-listening to the album, one may conclude that the extra-

careful workmanship and the many cunning formal devices were the result of long

and arduous preparation on Andre's part, but...having worked with him on my own

album, I can testify that both were improvised on the spot.  All in all, a honey

of an album in any language - especially the musical one."

I agree with composer Vernon Duke, however there is quite a bit of background 

tape hiss/noise.  It's still worth a listen
