,txrabbit,2012-12-03T00:40Z,"Hi again, thanks for that upload to replace the Russian copy.  Here's the problem, even though it's not your fault.  The next to last page of the english pdf of Crossover I pt 2 is a two page graphic that doesn't quite mesh up due to a bad scan.  However the Russian one has the image complete as one picture.  It's a nitpick, was hoping your english pdf fixed this, but alas, it did not.  Appreciate you hard work.  Hopefully  I'll have gotten the complete batch of files in a day or so.  I've a rotten connection.  Thanks again."
