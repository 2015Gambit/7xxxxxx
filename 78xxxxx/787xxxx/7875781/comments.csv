[V],psspss,2012-12-01T06:06Z,"135 seeders thats funny.. either fake seeders or someone trying to hide the ip for me.. lol
thanks but its just me seeding and seeded 31percent so far but i see everyone on 23

bloody leechers or limiters still hoping on"
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T06:46Z,"
Finally an exciting episode with lots happening

theres gold in those hills

so is bering sea gold coming back soon?"
,jagr_200,2012-12-01T06:54Z,I upload it 3 times and call it quits. Sucks up alot of bandwidth.
,jagr_200,2012-12-01T06:57Z,BTW I'm seeding at over 1mb/s
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T06:59Z,:O
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T07:01Z,"no fiber here only adsl but we might get cable
next year when they put it in the roads to homes 

but 100k.s is all I got.. I have seeded over 100 percent now
so why no one seeded out?"
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T07:01Z,://
,jagr_200,2012-12-01T07:06Z,Bering Sea Gold: Under the Ice was this seasons series. 
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T07:13Z,"i think most of the leechers are coming from Kat 

I see they keep deleting my helpful comments there

cant even post a link to a supporting docu or special without mods deleting it..

and they deleted ghost hunters cos they got a DCMA request.. how lame as if that protects them.. as it did for mega"
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T07:14Z,"no.. bering sea (also will be a summer one)

the other ice on was just a off-season trial season"
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T07:34Z,"

its funny you ask nicely people not to leech

and in end it cost me 170 percent in data to seed it out

and yet other shows take 110-120.. 

well next week I think you will moan if I have it and dont share :)"
,STONEDSTONER,2012-12-01T07:46Z,"Thanks!! i dont bother with the special eps, they suck

Have you seen Jungle Gold? its hilarious , two idiot americans driving around africa with an american flag in the front of there car, the big douche wheres a t-shirt saying ""made in america""

Flashing there cash infront of the starving locals etc HAHAHAH they are worse then the hoffmans  "
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T09:12Z,"yes I watch it see above I post a link to it already

and yes.. I cant feel sorry for 2 guys who had easy jobs selling over priced houses to avg americans
and got caught up in the greed of proverty

now they caught up in greed for gold and
get out done by the chinese who would kill and
show arms.. Im sure if no cameras there
I think americans would of been shot by now or 
axed or both"
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T11:08Z,"actually the latest aftershow cribs is pretty good worth a watch.. shows how they are living and the kids and wives are with them I didnt know that

however the dirt extra footage episodes are waste of time! and data.. they shouldnt be called specials either.. :./ only the dirt aftershows"
,Retrenched,2012-12-01T14:12Z,"For a new upload, there sure is a lotta yap in here..."
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T14:23Z,no one goin to rate the quality then :)
,abhi101,2012-12-03T15:00Z,try x264 format instead of xvid...since u are low on bandwidth.....its lot smaller and better quality
