Preppers UK: Surviving Armageddon
The precautionary prowess of the British is proudly on display in this programme which proves that the wonder of apocalyptic wariness isn't purely an American phenomenon. Civil unrest, financial chaos and natural disasters are everyday news - and, whether it involves survivalists stockpiling away in Surrey or completely upping sticks and moving to Slovakia, Preppers UK: Surviving Armageddon features British preppers who've armed themselves with much more than just a stiff upper lip. In Surrey, Royston is preparing for the aftermath of a solar flare and hosts a radio show for fellow preppers. Over in Buckinghamshire, tree surgeon Malcolm explains how he prepares for disaster by sampling the local wildlife - he has feasted on squirrel, rabbit, magpie, and even tried ant eggs! And in Greater Manchester, the Dylan family reveals how they plan to become completely self-sufficient in the aftermath of an economic crisis. Plus, on the other side of the Atlantic, catch up with our original extreme preppers who, throughout the US-based series, proved that Armageddon obsession truly is a global sensation.
