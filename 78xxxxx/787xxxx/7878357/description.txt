This is a book written by Stanley Milgram about the experiments he conducted in regards to obedience to authority. This was disguised as a learning experiment in which an unknowing participant was supposed to shock another participant for not memorizing word pairs. The learner, as it turns out, is a confederate of the experimenter and the shocks are fake. This is one of the most controversial experiments ever performed in social psychology because of the use of deception and the emotional stress participants experienced.
