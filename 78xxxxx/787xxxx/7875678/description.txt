LiquidSonics' Reverberate is a highly efficient hybrid convolution reverb audio processor offering true zero-latency operation for two separate, stereo impulse responses for Mac and PC supporting VST, Audio Units and RTAS.
Creative Convolution

Reverberate provides a rich and dynamic reverb from impulse responses by modulating an amalgamation of two, separately controllable true stereo IRs using an LFO. Further modulation is possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus and delay unit provide a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype paragraphic equaliser is provided with dual LFOs. These features make for a livelier, more creative sound than typically associated with some convolution reverbs.

In addition to loading impulse responses from audio files Reverberate is able to generate supplementary independent early reflections and tails for additional control over a roomΓÇÖs sonic characteristics.

Presets and Impulse Responses

Reverberate is supplied with a number of presets and impulse responses in order to provide an overview of the plug-in's capabilities, but we strongly encourage you to seek additional impulse responses and experiment with Reverberate's modulation capabilities. Whilst there are many outstanding commercial DVD IR libraries there are some excellent, well respected packages available online such as those at 1313 (rhythminmind.net), Samplicity, Practical Sampling, OpenAIR (UK-based sampled IRs), Echo Chamber and more links at KVR.
