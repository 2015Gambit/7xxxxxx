A photographic and textual record of eighteen months in the lives of one elephant family in Kenya's Amboseli National Park presents photographs and a text that offer insights into every aspect of the elephants' lives.
Moss has been studying the elephant population in Kenya's Ambesoli National Park for more than 20 years. Her work here documents an intense 18-month observation, from January 1990 to June 1991, of a single family unit. Moss escorted cinematographer Colbeck as he filmed a documentary, airing on PBS's "Nature" program this month. Moss's charming writing makes for understandable science. Her text reads like a novel yet is scientifically accurate, unexaggerated, and highly informative.
Readers will become involved with matriarch Echo and her family, kin, and clan. Librarians should have handy Moss's previous work, Elephant Memories: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant Family ( LJ 2/15/88), as there is likely to be interest in it as well. Strongly recommended for all public libraries and elephant/Africa collections.
