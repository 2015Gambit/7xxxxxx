,peacerock,2012-12-01T22:13Z,Does this work with FSPassengers? Because I downloaded same package long ago and when I use FSPassengers the display window is black and my icon changes from normal to the loading icon. Anyway thank you for the torrent as usual.

,pilotdude,2012-12-02T03:43Z,"Warning!  Disable your internet every time you use this program.

It's collecting your IP address.

I read in the FS2Crew forum on Avsim a lot of guys are getting busted for piracy because of this.

But what's the worst you're going to get?  A letter in mail from your ISP?

What can they do?"

,skouras555,2012-12-02T10:45Z,so it is safe to run it normally with internet or not
