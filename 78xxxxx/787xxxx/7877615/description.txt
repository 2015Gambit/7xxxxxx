1. You MUST have SP1c or later installed from PMDG.   SP1b is NOT sufficient.

2. This program is an add-on for the PMDG 737 NGX aircraft.  This program does NOT include the aircraft itself.  The aircraft can be purchased at: www.precisionmanuals.com

3. This program MUST be installed into your root FSX folder.  The installer should auto-detect the location of your root FSX folder for you.  If the installer does not auto-detect the location of the FSX folder, you have a FSX Registry key problem.  Please stop the installation and see the FS2Crew Support Forum at Avsim.com for assistance.

4. The manual is a must!  Do not even try to use the software without reading the manual first.  The manual is available via the FS2Crew NGX Config Manager.
