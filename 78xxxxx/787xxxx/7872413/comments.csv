[T],spanikopita,2012-11-30T21:26Z,"Um....no thanks. 

I want people to be able to choose the files they want to dl. And I don't want to create 2x the work by creating yet another file with the names of all the books that people will only download and then have to open. 

Most people just click on the little number beside the ""Files"" label. See that one with ""548""? Click that. Down what you want.

So while your note was nice and oh so thoughtful, I am not going to comply and not one of my ups ever has been an archive file.

But I see you haven't contributed a damn thing, so until you do, kindly suck the gas out of my ass."
