                           DESCRiPTiON 

 If you've heard of QI, the chances are that you've heard of the BBC2 comedy 
 panel quiz of the same name, hosted by Stephen Fry. Unlike any other quiz show 
 you will have failed to avoid catching, QI's questions are impossible to 
 answer, but at least the guest panel of top-shelf comedians can laugh at 
 themselves (and the universe in general) while trying.

 At its core, it enshrines the original view of Lord Reith that the BBC should 
 'educate, inform and entertain', all three of which duties are carried out to 
 the great enjoyment of panel and audience alike.      
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
