UFO_News_1Dec2012 + Presentations Bundle xvid avi

OK heres my UFO news for the week.. Not much this week plus low on data yet again
so keeping it smaller this time. There wasnt much about anyhow not verifiable people
at least

Its good AFO finally added some decent background music to their Best of sightings Bundle
I liked the whistling.. very relaxing :)
also I think they might have edited them differently as when converting I didnt get
any dropped frames where the splices are in the preview I did first 5min
I go back and watch them all NOW MY SELF :)

all xvids left with their default pixel ranges but some are 360p and auto forced to mp3 128 cbr 48K
