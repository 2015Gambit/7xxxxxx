,nancydrum,2012-11-30T14:49Z,Thank you so much for your uploads - you seem to be the only one uploading paranormal stuff here - I appreciate the work you do
[V],psspss,2012-11-30T22:56Z,well I will be cutting back to niche stuff and para only to a point.. if afg has one up already I wont bother.. I prb can share 10gb worth over the next 20 days.. thats it.. so got to make it stretch now
[V],psspss,2012-11-30T23:03Z,"so say trutv is sabotaging there most popular show

perhaps some people are putting pressure to pull the show
or get people to miss it so they do get to see the underground

but then ozark is going to get more tourists now and extra income in their pockets so its not all bad publicity and you have a place to run and hide in event of disaster when staying there LOL"
[V],psspss,2012-11-30T23:04Z,i mean their :/
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T00:33Z,"
Note also my weekly UFO bundles do have some conspiracy stuff and docu-s in them you may like as well..

dont miss out..

espc check out the antartic photos and weeks back the one on early man cover up and pyramids
and what not"
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T00:34Z,"also 2 weeks ago was the Jesse Ventura interview
was very good shame more people in usa dont listen and get their news from main stream propaganda instead"
,sup1990,2012-12-01T01:05Z,thank you so much!
,cindy25,2012-12-01T03:45Z,"still can't believe you were the only one to find this; am seeding and seeding this.

have you looked for Oliver Stone's Untold History?

that the scene missed two episodes of this amazes me, when they are able to post other Showtime promptly."
,k3nd00d,2012-12-01T06:03Z,Turned out looking pretty good. G/J
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T06:26Z,"not seen untold stories what is it about?

anyhow Im strapped for data.. and money

k3n or scene might come through with other show"
,cindy25,2012-12-02T02:56Z,"the first ep of Untold History is here; scene posted it normally and it is still very well seeded

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7820992/Oliver.Stones.Untold.History.Of.The.United.States.S01E01.HDTV.Xv

so many wondering why no ep 2 and 3

esp with them still on the Showtime website (of course blocked for anyone outside USA)"
[V],psspss,2012-12-02T04:15Z,"dont sound like worth while series? not my thing I doubt been a few shows exposing the lies and red flags of usa before .. like zeitgeist 1 and 2 and
other conspiracy docus.. but I see if can find it for people.. the stream site looks like needs id to me too"
[V],psspss,2012-12-02T06:54Z,"had a good look about no ep2 or 3 about still apart from stream sites you need subs id to access 
so out of luck.. i say it show up sometime even if its a week or weeks late"
