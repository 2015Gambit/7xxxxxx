Alex finds something wrong with every girl he dates and often calls on his best bud Julia to rescue him from his romantic disasters. After years of this, Julia calls in a return favor and enlists Alex to attend her class reunion in hopes of winning back her high school flame. Her plan is a success and sparks fly but Alex finds himself distrustful of the rekindled love. With the help of a creepy school coach, Alex is determined to prove to Julia that the one that got away isn't really the one for her.
