iSilo is a document reader which is able to open .PDB files

For instance, some ebooks are in .PDB format and most ebook reading programs cannot open those books, because those programs donΓÇÖt support .PDB format

Therefore iSilo becomes a very useful program when one needs to open .PDB files

Note: Keygen is detected as false-positive by some antivirus software. 

For instance, NOD32 gives this false-positive warning: 

iSilo 6.05 + KeygenKeygen.exe - probably a variant of Win32/SdBot.KJGQVJY Trojan

Kaspersky antivirus finds this keygen safe.

You can chech the keygen for yourself in this website: https://www.virustotal.com
