Kontakt 5 Factory Content

Create a folder anywhere on your PC, name it Native Instruments.  Create a sub-folder, name it Kontakt 5, create another sub-folder, name it Factory Content.  Place all of the contents into the final sub-folder.  Open Kontakt 5, click add library, locate the sub-folder titled Factory Content and click OK.   

Enjoy, I just saved you a week of downloading from german websites.

Works 100%, I have already downloaded, installed and tested on my own PC/Kontakt.

I have the Kontakt 4 Factory Content as well, I will be uploading that soon if you use that version.
