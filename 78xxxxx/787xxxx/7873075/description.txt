Tonoin Kei, a musical genius who has studied extensively in the area of conducting, falls in love at first sight (or sound, as it were) with a music teacher, Morimura Yuuki. Morimura also happens to act as the concertmaster for a small amateur orchestra that meets three times a week at the Fujimi Civic Center. Morimura is in love with Kawashima Natsuko, a female flutist in the orchestra, but Kawashima falls for Tonoin when he joins to act as the group's new conductor in order to get closer to Morimura.
