2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Bandwidth has been a concern for me lately.  And that's why I've not been sharing as much 2012 Christian music as perhaps I could be sharing.  But here's my second torrent in as many days, bringing the year to date count up to 1,358 titles for 2012.

There's lots of Christmas Music here today including All About Worship, Brian Wahl, Eleventyseven, Jason Bare, Jason Gray, Katherine Jenkins, and Scott Krippayne.  There's some Southern Gospel including Canton Junction and Tribute Quartet.  How about some Classical?  Noah Stewart. Jazz?  Charles P Walker.  Are you hoping for a nice instrumental? Philip Wesley has a beautiful piano instrumental.  And the list goes on.
