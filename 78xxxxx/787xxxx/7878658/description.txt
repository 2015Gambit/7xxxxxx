My first torrent, here goes nothing.

I decided to rip my Gallagher DVDs cause I havent watched them in a long time and I could keep them on my computer, and I got the idea to put up a torrent since noone else on here has them. These are all 11 specials from the Smashing Watermelon Collection in mp4 format so they are ready to be put on your iPod, Pad or Phone.

Ill seed them as much as I can, I only have a laptop so I dont leave it on 24 hours a day so be patient, but whenever Im home and am awake my laptop is on. Please reseed as much as you can as well

Enjoy!
