Many people turn to music when words are not enough, at funerals and weddings, 
at times of heartbreak and euphoria. It seems to hold more emotion and go 
deeper than words.

Musicians as varied as Emeli Sande, who enthralled the world when she sang at 
the Olympics, opera diva Jessye Norman, dubstep artist Mala and modern 
classical composer George Benjamin explain how music makes them feel. Alan 
Yentob also talks to a vicar, a psychologist, a Hollywood composer, an adman 
and even the people who choose the music played in shopping malls. He sees 
babies dance to a rhythm, and old people brought forth out of silence by the 
power of music.
