The debut release from singer/songwriter OKByMySelf.

A blend of forms of alternative rock'n'roll, OKBMS has created his own genre of "loner Rock". Simple flowing guitars and heart crashing lyrics provide a mood of youthful omnipotence smashed to bits, left to pick up the broken pieces one step at a time. In the end, as always, the sweet tunnel of light, unbroken, basking in the essence....that ever burning eternal flame of hope....
