DESCIRPTION

For the first time in a point'n'click adventure, you can explore genre-typical and intricately created locations in Real 3D. A very vivid experience which is achieved by combining Anaglyph 3D Technology with the enclosed 3D glasses.
In The Rockin' Dead, the player takes on the role of Alyssa, member of the pretty to look at but unsuccessful metal band "Deadly Lullabyes". Following an anonymous invitation to a concert, they have an accident on the bumpy terrain just before they reach their destination. When Alyssa comes round, all the equipment of the band is missing ΓÇô as well as the rest of the band. The following events span a spaced adventure in utter "B Movie" style: Rocking skeletons, wobbly Elvises and numerous undead put Alyssa through various challenges. An extremely bizarre setting which somehow reminds Alyssa of one of her songs...
