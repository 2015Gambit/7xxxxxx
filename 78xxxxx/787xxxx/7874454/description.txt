Whether it is for aesthetics, security, or simple privacy, no project is more important to a landscape than its vertical boundary structures-the fences, walls, screens, and retaining wall terraces. This book includes classic favorites, like picket fences and panel fences, but also includes interesting regional variations, like Virginia split rail fences and dry-fit stone garden walls. Also included here are the latest materials, such as new variations on PVC vinyl and polymer-coated, wrought-iron look-alikes. And special attention is given to decorative boundary walls for patios-the latest trend in todayΓÇÖs cutting-edge landscape architecture. Add in major hardscape retaining wall terraces, and even an invisible electronic dog-fence project, and you have the most complete and modern book on fences and garden walls available.
