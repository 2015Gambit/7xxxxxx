Bombay-based Commercial Pilot, Anilkumar Sahni, while being held in a prison cell, reflects on his romance and subsequent marriage with Paris-born Neena - much to the chagrin of his wealthy widower father, Rai Bahadur Gyanchand Sahni. The couple live harmoniously together and become parents of Rita and Pavan. He introduces his wife to his friends, Kewal Kapoor and Ashok Srivastava, and while he is away on a 4 month trip overseas, Ashok and Neena become friendly and have an affair. When he returns, he notices the change, is enraged, borrows a gun from Kewal and goes to confront Ashok. The confrontation results in the latter's death, and Anilkumar's arrest. His father engages the services of Advocate Buom Kesh Mukherjee, while the Public Prosecutor, Ali Khan, is all set to present evidence and argue that the accused be sentenced to death.
