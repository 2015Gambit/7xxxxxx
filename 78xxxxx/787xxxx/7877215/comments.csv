,kevmeyer84,2012-12-02T10:01Z,This should have been a straight to DVD/Blu-Ray....Was not big screen worthy...
,kngjse,2012-12-02T11:55Z,"A/6 V/5

It's a pretty decent cam copy but as a lot of the scenes were dark, it was hard to make anything out. However, the adjustments to the color brings a noticeable difference. There was quite a bit of motion blur as well. The sound was quite clear and audible but unfortunately from about 80-90%, the sound is out of sync. 

As for the movie itself - it sucked. The actors were really good, the storyline sounded look a decent watch but unfortunately for a movie which is just under 1hr 30m,  the start of the movie felt rushed and the ending too slow. There was no real flow. I think they just cut too much out and the editing made it terrible. It felt too much like the starting of a sequel. "

,FireIsHot,2012-12-03T08:06Z,"I've seen a lot of cams, a couple of the best was Amazing Spiderman and Taken 2, this is somewhere in between those two. 

Pretty nice during day shots, but the dark shots are pretty hard to make out. And I know it's a cam, but there are some out there that don't really have a problem with this.

But considering how soon this cam came out it's pretty damn good. Rating is for a cam that is so soon after theatrical launch.

V: 8/10

A: 9/10"
