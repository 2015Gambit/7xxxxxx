These hacking software are here strictly for learning purpose.  Knowledge is to be shared.  But use it on your own volition and risk.  I have not tried it.  If anyone used these and become successful ( or no success at all ) please share your experience & comment on it.  Don't be potty mouth & cry babies, because I am only trying to help. :) Good luck.
