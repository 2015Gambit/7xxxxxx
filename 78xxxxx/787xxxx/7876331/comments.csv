or its fake?"
,Pakundo,2012-12-01T11:35Z,"Actually, if this is the same thing that's up on Tunngle, then no, actually, this isn't fake.
But it requires you to uninstall your existing uPlay, install it and fuck it up.
Basically, if you don't have any owned Ubi-game installed that you wanna play - go ahead this crack is awesome.
If you DO have another ubi-game installed that you actually own... Yeah, well... Pass."

,csgo4life,2012-12-01T20:45Z,"multiplayer works and all, i played for an hour or so, but i lost my save game from before and that sucks balls"
,Jakmalmo,2012-12-01T21:55Z,"I followed all the steps, and it kinda felt legit so could have been something I've done wrong, but now  I cant enter the game. When I open the game in uplay it comes ""Unable to start the game. Please check that your game has been installed correctly. If the problem persists contact UbiSoft Support"".

Anyone got a fix for this?"
,Jakmalmo,2012-12-01T22:12Z,"Please someone come up with a fix, I really want to play again :/"
,frette7,2012-12-01T22:28Z,Unable to start the game. Please check that your game has been installed correctly same problem here.
,Koca114,2012-12-01T22:36Z,"@Jakmalmo Yes, I have the same message. Can anyone help? Will you upload that ""scene release""?"
,Jakmalmo,2012-12-02T00:06Z,"OK guys it's working now. What I did was to completely reinstall the game, then follow the tutorial, then open the FC3updater.exe and update the game. After that I went online on Uplay and started the game which worked :]"
,G.Doc,2012-12-02T02:12Z,"when you press the game & not open is because is cracked......... that's why the folder brings original files JUST REPLACE ;) WORKS awesome coop & multiplayer

,N3xS,2012-12-02T13:08Z,"I can't create an account or login. It says ""We are unable to create your account right now as Ubisoft server is unavailable"". Any help..?"
,Koca114,2012-12-02T14:59Z,"@N3xS Go to C:\WindowsSystem32etc and delete host file. Should work after that.

@Jakmalmo It won't update the game for me. Error pops up. Help?"
,Koca114,2012-12-02T15:08Z,@N3xS Go to C:WindowsSystem32driversetc and delete host file. Should work after that.
,G.Doc,2012-12-02T17:39Z,OK GUYS MAKE A CLEAN INSTALL OF THE GAME ÂĄÂĄ DO NOT CRACK !!! AND FOLLOW THE TUTORIAL ;)
,N3xS,2012-12-02T18:18Z,"@Koca114 Thank you mate, I totally forgot that I blocked ubisoft on my host file :)"
,Jakmalmo,2012-12-02T21:32Z,"@Koca114
First I had this big update which worked, but now I got this little update which wont work (unable to find version number). What I do is just click ""No"" everytime it asks for update, and I disabled the Uplay in-game overlay, and accepted all the FarCry .exes in my firewall.

So now everytime I open it comes up an update which I decline and the game starts :)"
,Koca114,2012-12-02T22:34Z,"What version of the game did you use? I used The Lost Expedition edition. I didn't install the game, just extracted it. Maybe I need to download Reloaded version and then it will work"
,Pshot19,2012-12-02T23:13Z,"A warning I just got a ""temporary ban"" from ubisoft!  I never got the multiplayer working and I tried many times, so maybe Ubisoft gave me the temporary ban because of to many failed attempts.  I dunno, but I thought I would tell my fellow pirates:( "
,N3xS,2012-12-03T00:52Z,Now the problem is the saves.. How to make them with uplay? :P
,G.Doc,2012-12-03T01:30Z,"@pshot19 SHUT UP FAGOT THIS CRACK WORKS IS TESTED, JUST MAKE A CLEAN INSTALL WITH NO CRACK, RELOADED VERSION RECOMENDED, AND THEN DO THE TUTORIAL ;) THIS WORKS !"
,pkicyris69,2012-12-03T02:46Z,Now my game is in freaking German.... co-op/mp works but now it's all in German. Does anyone know how to fix this? The reloaded language selector forces offline mode so that will not work.
,G.Doc,2012-12-03T03:38Z,@pkicyris69 IN THE STEP THAT YOU GOT TO OPEN FC3_Registry.reg AND YOU CHANGE THE INSTALL DIRECTORY THERE IS A LINE THAT SAYS language JUST PUT ENGLISH OR ANY LANGUAGE AND THAT'S IT ;)
,N3xS,2012-12-03T12:55Z,"Anyone got a solution for the saves please? To make them work with uplay, as the reloaded  saving system is different.."
