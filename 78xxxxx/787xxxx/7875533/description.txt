Alex, Laura, Illena, Cara and Eve (ALICE), are five female contract killers forced to work together to stay alive and cancel the million dollar bounties placed on each of their heads. With a body count almost equaling the page count, Terminal Alice's barrier free combination of sex, violence and intrigue will keep you guessing until the final page. Who says you can't go with a smile.
