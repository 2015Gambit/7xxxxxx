,Synobal,2012-11-30T01:18Z,"Could be a troll could be legit, Ubisoft has been handing out the game left and right to review and such. So it is possible this is legit."
,rawrmoar,2012-11-30T01:25Z,"Not a troll, theres already footage of it up. Wowcrendor's 2 minute review is pretty awesome, check it out"
,crunch1,2012-11-30T01:43Z,It was released yesterday in Australia. Don't know about other places.
,ccrc28,2012-11-30T01:59Z,"This torrent maybe is not a fake because here in Brasil game actually was released today (29/nov) by Nuveem and i'm downloading from there right now (very slow). 

If someone get it from here and works fine please say so because at nuveem the file size is 8,8gb..."

,batboy100,2012-11-30T20:12Z,"i am having problems installing it gives me the error message ""it is not found any file specified for ISArcextract"" anybody know how to fix this?"
,JOHN007C,2012-11-30T20:58Z,"4.7GB

and the game itself requires 15GB of HDD space. this torrent sounds too good to be true how can it be so small compared to it's full iso?"
,ownedirl,2012-11-30T21:56Z,"seed please, 10kbs sucks ass"
,Officefx,2012-12-01T00:05Z,"the game only requires 7.5 gigs for install bro and it works. black box takes all other language packs out decreasing the size in the torrent, along with the hi res vids for cut scenes"
,bastiancas,2012-12-01T10:09Z,"Excellent Torrent, works perfectly once downloaded, no Crack Needed, just install and run.

I Have Windows 7 64-bits version, Nvidia GT545 Graphic Card and I7 Intel Core Processor.

Also... havent had any crashes or anything, if you feel the game a bit laggy just lower the graphics!"
,dyedfire,2012-12-01T11:33Z,"Odd, I installed the game but it keeps flashing a black screen. Any idea here?"
,thephreek,2012-12-01T12:57Z,Funktioniert nicht. 
,awaic,2012-12-01T14:33Z,"Those who are getting ""It is not found any file specified for ISArcextract"" error download and install FreeARC"
,marvJarv,2012-12-01T15:03Z,"Downloaded it overnight (had quite good speeds then, actually) and everything works perfectly up until the end of the first cutscene (I haven't played any further. Probably works perfectly from there, too) Thanks for this amazing torrent!"
,CorporalPunishment,2012-12-01T15:33Z,Downloaded yesterday. Working like a charm. Simple installation.
,Alduin1998,2012-12-01T16:10Z,"Works fine but after closing and re-opening, the save file is not detected still looking for a solution.
Save is in :ProgramDataOrbit46"
,dyedfire,2012-12-01T19:04Z,"Ah, turns out I was playing from Farcry3.exe instead of farcry3_d3d11.exe. Works now. Great upload!"
,MLO89,2012-12-02T02:49Z,Man this one sure beat everyone else. Works perfect.
,Skelluton,2012-12-02T04:48Z,"Mine seems to be force closing a lot. Enough to make a stealth mission much harder than it really is. I finished the mission once, but when I did, it force closes, making me start over."

,Skelluton,2012-12-02T04:52Z,Mine seems to be force closing a lot. Please help! 
,trogdor123,2012-12-02T08:42Z,Wondering if I'm the only one losing all my progress after a crash (and it crashes often)?
,Dark_Gold,2012-12-02T08:59Z,When I close and re open FC3 it wont load any of my saves but I still have my save files in the location where they are created. Any solutions?
,Kartnisch,2012-12-02T12:40Z,"Fucking great, Had good progress into the game a solid 30 hours or so and then the game crashes and my saves get erased.... Any fixes or is this just ubisoft deserving a motherfucking dildo up the ass?"
,trogdor123,2012-12-02T13:18Z,"The saves aren't erased, they're sitting in c:ProgramDataOrbit46 problem is that they don't show when restarting. 

One suggestion was to start FarCry 3 in ""offline"" mode (add -offline to the exe shortcut) and someone claimed this worked (here: http://www.spielsucht24.de/2012/12/01/far-cry-3-save-game-problem-fix-solved/ ) but this did not work for me. Maybe someone else has more luck?"
,Skelluton,2012-12-02T17:57Z,"Sorry for posting a lot, I wasn't sure if my comment was being posted."
,mikebrazil,2012-12-02T20:45Z,The game works FINE... BUUUUTTTT... You can NOT save your progress... So... not worth it!!!!!!!!!!
,rawrmoar,2012-12-02T23:10Z,"I'm able to save my progress just fine. Continue, save, load game, they all work. But I'm uninstalling anyway, it keeps crashing on my way to the medusa. "
,Dark_Gold,2012-12-03T00:05Z,"Trog, thanks for that reply but nothing has worked for me. Fuck I guess I'll have to get this for xmas now? haha..."
,mikebrazil,2012-12-03T00:47Z,Somebody said the the game should save fine if you run it as an Administrator...  Does anyone knows if it works?????????
,JaisJose,2012-12-03T17:09Z,Thanks For This Awesome Small sIZED tORRENT...dOWNLOADING...wILL Post If Have Issues... :)
,pilot2fly,2012-12-03T17:38Z,"I can confirm that this game works on Windows 8. If you run farcry3_d3d11.exe as an administrator and under Windows 7 compatibility, there are no save errors or crashes."
