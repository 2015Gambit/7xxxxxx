Here's the vastly improved third release of the public beta for The Age of Decadence, an isometric, turn-based, single-player 3D role-playing game set in a low magic, post-apocalyptic fantasy world inspired by the fall of the Roman Empire.

Among other improvements, it now includes the alchemy system for you to play around.
