Alright so my upload from earlier was using the wrong torrent file, it was only Volumes 1 to 34 and I think there was a problem with like 2 of the volumes.A thousand apologies. I am mega confident that this one works though.



This is Kentaro Miura's Berserk (AKA best manga of all time) Volumes 1 ~ 37.
I organized it all super neat and even edited a ton of pages that had typos myself. Includes the Artbook and Prototype, enjoy your pile of badassery. 
FOR SURE THIS TIME. 



If you enjoy the manga please support Kentaro Miura by buying the manga and its merchandise in hopes that he also stops playing idolmaster and puts out chapters more often.


Also many thanks to Band of Hawk, Dark Horse, and Evil Genius for Scanlation Groups for translating it. 


P.S. For people only reading this manga for the  first time I'd also like to express that I kid you not when I say this is the best manga EVER. You cannot beat Berserk. Just nothing beats Ber- no..- what?? You say you like- NO, doesn't matter, Berserk is better than anything you like or whatever. 


P.P.S. I'd also like to make a quick recommendation to Gantz by Oku Hiroya.
