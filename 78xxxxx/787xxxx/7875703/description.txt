Here's the website for the program: http://siborg.ca/descrip.html

It is basically used for modeling semiconductors and is quite good at it if you know what you're doing.  It is a very hard program to learn.  

It will only run the simulation on 32-bit systems.  I have only gotten it to run the simulation on Windows XP, SP 3, 32-bit.  It might work on Windows 7 32-bit, I just have not tried it yet.  

All I did is copy and paste the files from off my desktop.  There is no license or anything that I know of.  I'm not very good at figuring this stuff out, so I'm not really sure if it will run for you or not, or if the current license will expire or something like that.  I thought I would just upload the files to help some people out who want the program.

King James Version (KJV)
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
