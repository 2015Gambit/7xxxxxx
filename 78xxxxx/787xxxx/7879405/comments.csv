,jayspot,2012-12-02T16:26Z,"Thank you much for this bro!  I've also had no luck looking for Rios vs Alvarado :-(  Perhaps the second best fight of the year, first being Pacquiao vs Marquez (next week!)"
,anluis,2012-12-02T17:32Z,"Thanks. Great fight. I wanted Cotto to win, but Trout is a great fighter and did a great fight, he deserve the win. I only think that the fight was closer than the judges saw it."
,DozeKind,2012-12-03T06:36Z,Berto v Alvarez was a great fight also ... Berto's been in some real wars in his relatively young career
