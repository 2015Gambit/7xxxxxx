Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Friday, November 30 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex exposes the NDAA's reworking by congressional legislators to create a more "Constitution friendly" version, the TSA's boycott of the Transport Committee's hearing claiming it is outside of the jurisdiction of Congress, the FAA's refusal to address privacy rights in regard to U.S. airspace drone use and more. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes 2008 Green Party presidential candidate and renowned political activist Rep. Cynthia Mckinney to discuss implications of the enduring Gaza-Israel conflict and the direction she sees the U.S. headed under Obama's second term. 

Alex also speaks with historian, economist and political analyst Tom Woods and Executive Director of the Foundation for a Free Society Jason Rink about the urgency of protecting states' rights and keeping secession a viable option, as discussed in the documentary Nullification: The Rightful Remedy.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
