,ChiliNoMoreX,2012-12-01T01:04Z,"after 5 or 6 releases skidrow haven't learn how to properly patch a game with steam protection without copying the original files...
kinda sad since scriptkiddies already did it once or twice..."
,divesh8_4,2012-12-01T02:43Z,"This patches provides the following improvements:

– Players using the Russian language will no longer crash as soon as they use the sniper rifle.
– Various issues that have been seen on specific configurations that caused the game to not be able to start up at all have been addressed.
– Problems with the Sniper Challenge Unlocks not carrying over into Hitman: Absolution have been addressed. On first starting the patched game you will receive your unlocks.
o Note that North American users that have been provided the Sniper Challenge by Gamestop will need a separate unlock key in addition to this. Gamestop can provide these.
– Problems with negative level-scores have been fixed. Newly accomplished positive scores will be needed to erase your incorrectly remembered negative scores.
– A problem with keyboard and mouse controls where users would accidentally melee attack a person next to them when they intended to throw an item has been addressed.
– Legal and Intro movies can now be skipped immediately on startup after the game, on all launches but the very first on a machine.
– DirectX 10 hardware can now enable the simplest version of the Depth Of Field effect.
– Problems with audio occasionally being muted after ALT-TAB have been fixed.
– Various localization fixes.
– Miscellaneous other stability and general improvements based on crashes we have seen coming in."

Man, if you're so smart - go make your own crack, or go to Skidrow and teach them how to do it. Or purchase legal copy and have no probs with updating. I can only thank the guys for makin' pirated game updates."
,Scyrthis,2012-12-02T07:35Z,Does this update now allow us with sli config (680 in my case) and the latest nvidia beta drivers to finally use both cards instead of one? I only get 20-24 fps maxed out in the benchmark..
,ReIVIeDy,2012-12-02T08:37Z,"So will this delete our save files, or not?"
