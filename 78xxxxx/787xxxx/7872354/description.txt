The Ed Show; November 28, 2012.

 A major House Republican said he is ready to take the president's deal on taxes, and Speaker Boehner is displeased.

Ed  welcomed Lee Saunders (American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees President) and discussed the grassroots blast to pass middle class tax cuts, and Lew Prince (the Managing Partner of Vintage Vinyl), talked about his meeting with President Obama.

Then, Grover Norquist is seeing his hold over the Republican Party slip awayΓÇöand for good reason. Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) joined the show to talk about the Democratic momentum behind the fiscal cliff negotiations.

Meanwhile, the Republicans tried out a bizarre new attack on Ambassador Susan Rice: Questioning her handling of embassy attacks in 1998. Karen Finney (MSNBC Political Analyst) helped sort out the truth from the smears.

Latino voters helped but President Obama over the top, and now the Congressional Hispanic Caucus says they want action. They're laying out a plan for immigration reform, and Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) joined Ed to explain.

And in the BIG Finish, President Obama is going to keep a promise he made on Election Night and have a private lunch with Mitt Romney on Thursday. Bob Shrum (New York University Senior Fellow, Daily Beast contributor) went on the show with his reaction.
