,SimStim,2012-12-01T12:13Z,Is this from the upcoming Criterion BR release or just a repack of individual titles (found elsewhere)?
,Skram0,2012-12-02T00:24Z,"I'd guess this is just a collection of previous released Blu-ray rips. The PublicHD link shows the torrent was added on 16/06/2012.

Still waiting for the Criterion collection. I hope the newest collection is not cropped like all the others. The IRE versions were the best as they showed the full picture as it was filmed, 4:3 I think or around that ratio. The recent releases zoomed the 4:3 and cropped the top and bottom to make a fake 16:9.

Cropped vs Non-Cropped:

A snippet from the Criterion description, ""New, restored high-definition digital transfers of all three films, approved by director Godfrey Reggio, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtracks on the Blu-ray editions.""

I hope since it's approved by director Godfrey Reggio that it will not be cropped."
,Skram0,2012-12-02T00:53Z,"In looking at the link I posted above again, they now have the ""Criterion - Region 'A' - Blu-ray"" screen caps too. And sadly to say it looks like the latest Criterion release is just a better quality MGM cropped version. :( That sucks.

So you either get crappy quality and see everything they filmed, or better quality and try to forget about the information they cropped from the top and bottom. Oh well, one of these decades they'll get it right."
