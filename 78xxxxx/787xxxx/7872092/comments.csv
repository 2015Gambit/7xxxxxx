,stonymacguyver,2012-11-30T17:46Z,"gee idk, look at the uploader name and see if there's a little green skull next to it. So surprised people use the internet but have no control over their eyes for christs' sake, it doesn't take long to scope out a small webpage like this. As for quality, seeing as it's an R5 the video will more than likely be 7-8 with audio ranging from 5-7."

My friend was recently caught downlading this movie because Screen Gems Studios was (and still may be) monitoring this torrent and contacting ISP's. My recommendation is to watch it on Movie2k.com; it is much safer. BEWARE!"
