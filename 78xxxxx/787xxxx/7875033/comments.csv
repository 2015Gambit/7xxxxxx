Thnx for a great work there, Ulkterna"
,Ulkterna,2012-12-01T02:30Z,"Please up the Quality of the torrent if you like it.

From my checking of the dates, this is actually pretty up to date, it may lack the landful updates (Which only added a new Questing hub and not really new items) from my research this pack actually has most of all MoP in it, if someone buys the guide and decides to share it with me i'll have them update it and then I'll update it here, but I don't have the money to spend to buy a copy, Theirs really no protection on the file. its just grab the folder >.>, No idea why no one has this uploaded, and it took me Hours to track down a working copy"
,accell,2012-12-01T12:39Z,"oh yea, just did... 
i'm still to check mop stuff tho, didn't see it through yet, just some mining lua for panda maps... and couldn't spot them.

Anyway its good.

And thnx for a hard work.

I spotted the forums yesterday.,. guys discussing the latest update... Maby there is a way to hook up with one of those.

,Ulkterna,2012-12-01T12:58Z,"if someone wants to spend the 37dollars to grab just the tycoon addon and keep it updated and send me a copy everytime it gets updated I'll host the torrent for it, I would buy it myself but I plan to go after my driving lincs this month and need to replace my cell x.x"
,accell,2012-12-02T08:00Z,just thought of a new way contacting tycoon users. their F***book page
,Ulkterna,2012-12-02T16:43Z,"xD, well if you can get one of them to zip up their folder for us, that'd be great!"
,accell,2012-12-02T19:28Z,still trying ....
,HN22,2012-12-02T20:00Z,"txt file inside the zip says version info... dates back to August, 2011. Sure hope we can get the latest version soon."
,Ulkterna,2012-12-03T12:16Z,"HN, As I said it may not be fully updated, If someone wants to spend the 37dollars (its on sell right now) and grab it and update it and throw me a copy i'll Host the torrent, I would do it myself but I'm having serious issues with money atm (pc is dieing, cell phone needs to be replaced, just moved so need to play catch up with funds) I have wrecked in almost 1k in gold using this addon in a single day around level 20-30 o.0"
