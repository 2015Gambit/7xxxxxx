,uncover22,2012-12-02T18:16Z,"pirotessa: actually the series is being cancelled. 

""After five years, Merlin is about to bite the dust. Despite hopes that the series would be renewed for a sixth year, it has been announced that the show will wrap up with a two-part story at Christmas.""

""""Merlin"" has been canceled after five seasons."" - Huffington post

really if you just look it up online there will be a myriad of sites confirming the cancellation. It is really sad because this was a great series, but there will be no more Merlin. They are however considering spin-offs but I don't know how those will go. "
