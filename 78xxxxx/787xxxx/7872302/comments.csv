,blogcb,2012-11-30T04:09Z,"Diamond says Wolverine Max #2 *was* released this week.  Perhaps Marvel doesn't offer digital versions of their Max comics?

,Ybarbo,2012-11-30T05:12Z,Thank you blogcb. Diamond is the place to go when you want to know what is shipping that wednesday. We just need someone to buy it and scan it in. 
,FLSM79,2012-11-30T05:25Z,nope.. they do... but more often than not marvel calendar and other sources are wrong... sometimes they have delays on some issues
,budboy311,2012-11-30T13:51Z,"The book was reviewed, it was released. Torrent is NOT complete. Check previewsworld.com for list of books released. It is updated Monday of every week for what is actually coming out."
