The Chronicles Of Nanyia
In a deep-diving competition, two teams break down when they can't handle the pressure. And an all-out knock-down brawl involving the entire house leaves the challengers hating each other even more than they could've imagined.
St. Thomas and Las Vegas struggle during the Abandon Ship challenge, and just as Team San Diego begins to repair its rift the rest of the competitors break out in a slew of epic fights.
