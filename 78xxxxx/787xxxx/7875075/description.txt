Here is part 2 of 2 in my collection with "mystery" tags. 

I used Amazon, Goodreads and Google for the tags.

This is a little deviation from my normal ups, but I wanted to make them available before hitting delete.

EPUB, MOBI and PDF and includes advance reader copies (ARC)

NOTE: No zip or rar files. Take what you want. Files can be viewed by clicking on the number after "Files" in the upper left corner right under "Other -> Ebooks".

Reseed and Enjoy!
