,AnteJon,2012-12-01T15:44Z,"No offense, just a question: How come MrUnpopulars releases are always croped?
Picture is missin on bottom and top.. always. 
Just curious."
,AnteJon,2012-12-01T15:45Z,As said.. no offense. Tnx for all the releases as they are still verry much appreciated :)
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-12-01T18:01Z,"They aren't overcropped at all, you're just ignorant about it lol.

This is a SD source. It airs letterboxed. Just the black bars are cropped off. None of the actual picture is missing, it just looks like it since half the logo is gone. Half the the logo is on the actual show which is kept intact. The other half is just over the black bars.

That is a TVRip. Everyone just assumes it's like HDTV because they're spoiled."
,Random-User,2012-12-01T21:24Z,"Nothing about being spoiled. HDTV is pretty much the standard. Anything less is a poor excuse for being left behind.

DLing these TVrips is just being impatient, wait and an hour more for the rest who DO use HDTV and all is good without the shitty pictures, cropping and audio straight out of a cardboard box."
