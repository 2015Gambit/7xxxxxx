The man was John Cardigan; in that lonely, hostile land he was the first pioneer. This is the tale of Cardigan and CardiganΓÇÖs son, for in his chosen land the pioneer leader in the gigantic task of hewing a path for civilization was to know the bliss of womanΓÇÖs love and of parenthood, and the sorrow that comes of the loss of a perfect mate; he was to know the tremendous joy of accomplishment and worldly success after infinite labour; and in the sunset of life he was to know the dull despair of failure and ruin. Because of these things there is a tale to be told, the tale of CardiganΓÇÖs son, who, when his sire fell in the fray, took up the fight to save his heritageΓÇôa tale of life with its love and hate, its battle, victory, defeat, labour, joy, and sorrow, a tale of that unconquerable spirit of youth which spurred Bryce Cardigan to lead a forlorn hope for the sake not of wealth but of an ideal.
