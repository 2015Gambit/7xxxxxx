Back when I was the managing editor of Art Journaling, I remember when Traci Bunkers journals arrived on my desk. I spent hours pouring through them, wondering to myself, How does she do this? With Tracis new book, The Art Journal Workshop, you get to see exactly how.ΓÇöChristine Olivarez, Somerset Studio

Many people want to express themselves through visual journaling, but are stuck or intimidated with how to get started, what to write, or how to move beyond gluing down a few images or putting some paint on the paper.

With beautiful illustrations, The Art Journal Workshop breaks down the entire working process of journaling with step-by-step photos and instructions from start to finish. You'll learn how to use different media such as paint, photographs, and collage, while following journaling prompts and exercises to help you dig deeper and enrich the journaling process and experience. Traci Bunkers discusses the benefits of visual journaling, and walks you through battling a creative funk when you're feeling down or uninspired.
