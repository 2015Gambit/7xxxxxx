,smexibone,2012-12-02T10:29Z,Great torrent and working. but i played with a different crack before i used this and i want to transfer my save games. anyone know where the save files are located for this?
,Furko99,2012-12-02T17:48Z,well the saves are located in C:ProgramDataOrbit46 (I think it's 46 or it's 54 I have both AC3 and FC3 from reloaded so) tho I think even if you copy saves into the location your game is saving after changing crack it won't work (it didn't for assassin's creed 3 after changing cracks for DLCs since Reloaded is using different saving method
