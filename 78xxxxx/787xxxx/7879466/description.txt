History Documentary hosted by Scott Shurian, published by PBS in 2003 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

In 1752, an ancient library was discovered at Herculaneum, buried beneath the ashes of Mount Vesuvius. Astonishingly, nearly 2000 carbonized papyrus rolls were preserved, though some were so badly burned they looked like pieces of charcoal. While some texts from the philosophical library have been published, many of the papyri have yet to be unrolled or read.

OUT OF THE ASHES: RECOVERING THE LOST LIBRARY OF HERCULANEUM follows attempts over 250 years to unroll and decipher these precious manuscripts. It also describes modern efforts to use sophisticated multi-spectral imaging technology to read the blackened fragments. Today, 21st century scholars continue to debate the future of the original Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, where the scrolls were all found. The site was never fully excavated and recent discoveries have led many scholars to believe that other scrolls - and perhaps another entire library - may still be buried there.

Shot in High definition, this fascinating film features the insight of international experts and prominent scholars from the University of Naples, Oxford, University of California/Los Angeles, Brigham Young University, Texas A&M University, the Getty Research Institute and the British School of Rome.
