The term ΓÇ£buried treasureΓÇ¥ is bandied about with a rather monotonous frequencyΓÇöhell, chances are youΓÇÖve probably read that phrase on this site more than a few times. But letΓÇÖs be honest: most really good music doesnΓÇÖt stay buried forever. Every now and again a song or an album will reemerge, popping up out of the cultural flotsam and washing ashore for our benefit. But itΓÇÖs hard for legitimately great music to stay hidden. Most ΓÇ£buried treasureΓÇ¥ gains credibility simply by virtue of its age, giving us a whiff of an elusive past that we somehow missed the first time around, if not quite the same heady aroma of a true classic. Very rarely does a classic albumΓÇöclassic in terms of both vintage and statusΓÇöappear out of thin air.

And yet that is exactly what Let My People Go has done. Like a magician pulling a previously-invisible rabbit out of his hat, the good folks at Luv NΓÇÖHaight have given us an album of forgotten early ΓÇÿ70s soul that legitimately deserves to share shelf space with the likes of Marvin Gaye, Al Green and James Brown. That may seem like a tall order, but Darondo is more than just a footnote. Even if his recorded output prior to this release was only six tracks, wow, what a six tracks they were!
