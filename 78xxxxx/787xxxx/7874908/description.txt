After Heather's betrayal leaves the Book of Dragons in the hands of the Outcasts,
the kids devise a plan for Astrid to disguise herself as Heather, sneak onto
Outcast Island, and retrieve the book from Alvin and the Outcasts. Everything
goes well until Alvin puts Astrid in the ring with a vicious wild dragon in
order to prove the book is genuine. The kids must escape before Heather, free
from the Berk jail, returns to Outcast Island and exposes their scheme.
