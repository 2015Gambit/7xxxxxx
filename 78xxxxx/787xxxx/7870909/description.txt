About the Author
Mike Monteiro is the co-founder and design director of Mule Design, an interactive design studio whose work has been called ΓÇ£delightfully hostileΓÇ¥ by The New Yorker. He prefers elegant, simple sites with clear language that serve a real need. He prefers that designers have strong spines.

Mike blogs frequently about the craft and business of design. In early 2011, he gave a Creative Mornings talk entitled ΓÇ£FΓÇö You, Pay MeΓÇ¥ that uplifted the downtrodden the world over, and he can be heard weekly as the co-host of LetΓÇÖs Make Mistakes with Katie Gillum. None of the terms Mike has coined are printable on a family website.

You can follow him on Twitter as @Mike_FTW, but weΓÇÖre not liable for what youΓÇÖll see.
