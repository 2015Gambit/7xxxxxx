,Pdid,2012-12-02T16:26Z,"This is a remake of Silent Night, Deadly Night 1984. Malcolm McDowell AND Donal Logue?! I'm down. Critic reviews on IMDB are all positive, even the NY Times. Christian93 has not even watched it I bet. Santa with a flamethrower is shit? Go back to watching Twilight movies lil' bitches."
