never waste your time. movie will come next year."
,dollbludgeon,2012-12-02T10:03Z,"It's only 'Gray' if you're an American, because you people spell things stupidly. The book was written by a British person, so it is 'Grey'. On the other hand, who gives a fuck? It's not exactly gonna be the movie of the year. I don't care at all, I just hate you Seppo bastards."
,mlmariss,2012-12-02T20:41Z,"It's a pron. 
Wrong IMDB link, wrong movie."
,Frank525,2012-12-02T22:16Z,This is probably the unauthorized movie based on the book that is currently the center of a huge lawsuit. It pretty much follows the book exactly but with the quality of a porn.
