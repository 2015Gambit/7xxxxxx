Well, ""Trinity"" is on an ego trip, and like those children that spray paint your community to get recognition, they have placed an unsightly red watermark on the screen of this movie. It's trash now, as far as I am concerned and I will remember to not download another Trinity release."

Hilarious. Is that bug really on the whole movie?"
,gusfring,2012-12-02T04:48Z,"yep, confirmed. there's a watermark on the left bottom corner of the (sample) video. and it's not a bug, it's just something the encoder, in this case TRiNiTY, included in the video. to me it's not that annoying but it definitely is hard to ignore. great up nonetheless.

,vivatpb5776,2012-12-02T06:12Z,"To add to what everyone has already mentioned, the word, ""Trinity"" is in the lower left hand corner of the screen throughout the entire movie. What's worse is the word is in red. There is no way to miss it. Maybe if it were in grey or some other type of neutral color it would not make a difference. However, imagine how it looks when the movie is in a dark scene. Not cool at all."
