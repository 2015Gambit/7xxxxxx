The unstoppable wAFF returns to Hot CreationsΓÇÖ relentless release schedule displaying once again on Eclipse EP just why he is riding such an incredible wave of hype since the release of his critically acclaimed Rainbows EP on the label earlier this year. With a list of admirers including Luciano, Loco Dice and Sven Vath (who recently included wAFFΓÇÖs Jo Johnson on his ΓÇÿThe Sound Of The 13th SeasonΓÇÖ compilation), itΓÇÖs safe to say that the 24 year old is most definitely one to watch out for.

With conga rhythms and the sounds of nature penetrating the senses it feels as though we have been transported directly to the heart of the Amazon on title track Eclipse. That is until an incredibly sultry bassline enters the foray and drives this one to the point of dance floor destruction wAFF is becoming so renowned for. After the introduction of a groove-inducing vocal lick and a couple of percussive-led breakdowns later, it seems we have ourselves yet another massive hit for the Hot Creations cartel.

Things donΓÇÖt let up by any means on the flip; in fact if anything the intensity climbs to a point where people will quite literally be hanging from the walls. With a driving, Chicago style high hat pattern, a low-end that is set to push sound-systems to the max and delayed rolling woodblock shots inducing hypnotic waves of climax, Ibiza feels like the young artist doing what he does best.

Both these tracks have been huge for the Hot Creations crew this summer at Paradise and in Ibiza in general..
