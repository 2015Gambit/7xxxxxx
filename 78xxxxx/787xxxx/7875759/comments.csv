Welcome"
,pjatgv,2012-12-01T06:14Z,awesome. was dying for a new apisode in tuf. thanks bro
,Prabath1234,2012-12-01T06:23Z,Thanks buddy.woke up late
,Hoirc88,2012-12-01T06:25Z,Fast upload yea but it makes no difference when you're trying to download this for over an hour and at 2%..
,cyberkeg,2012-12-01T06:28Z,still downloading but many thanks in advance !
,Prabath1234,2012-12-01T06:43Z,"@Hoirc88  may be you should seed back to get a better down speed.When you not seeding back,you connecting to less peers hence slow down speed."
,jibbajabbax,2012-12-01T06:49Z,"If you were stuck at 2% for over an hour, then you weren't uploading to anyone.  Not surprising, given that this is a public tracker, no?

I managed to get an average downstream rate of 1.5MB/s, with 90MB/s upstream...  

A good 1/3rd or so of the peers will never upload to you anyway, better to kick and ban those if you're bothered about how fast (or not) it's going."
,Hoirc88,2012-12-01T06:54Z,Giving up trying to d/l this one way too big of a file size and slowest d/l speeds of all time.. no offense. Gl to others.
,Hoirc88,2012-12-01T06:55Z,"Well I'm not sure how to do what you're asking but my upload speed isn't capped or anything like this, it's always set to unlimited."
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-01T07:07Z,"1,700 people downloading and only 360 seeding to them. You guys need a kick in the ass and start sharing for the rest of the world. I've already uploaded 32GB since this was created. This happens every week. At least seed half of a 1.00 ratio and seed back 0.50 and that'd be okay. Stop taking and leaving. I can't keep seeding these things out constantly, guys. Give back a little. It's free after all."
,pjatgv,2012-12-01T07:10Z,for the ones complaining about slow speed maybe your client isn't configured properly because i downloaded at 1.2mb/s with only 3 guys seeding.... that's the max download speed i can get in this pc so 100% for me... you should try change ur client... i used to use utorrent but i was getting slow dl speeds recently.... i changed to vuze and now my torrents are flying again....
,Prabath1234,2012-12-01T07:22Z,"@Hoirc88  use deluge bro,don't use utorrent at all.
and set all setting [peer connections,half connections] to 9000"
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-01T07:53Z,"I've recently been setting up a new operating system on my PC, so my encoding programs/profiles/codecs/filters/etc are not fully installed, but am working on a 480p. It'll just be a short while before released."
,Nimh,2012-12-01T07:59Z,"I upload at 25kB/s but seed after downloading to at least a 1:1 up/down ratio.

If i set my upload speed to above 25kB download speed starts to drop.   Connected on ADSL2+  at 8-9000kb down / 1024kb up. 

1024kb = 128kB,  minus overhead shouldn't i be able to upload at least 50-80kB before it would start to affect download speed? 

I get a real world max download of 900kB from best sites and about a 700kB from the best torrents. Use uTorrent   Thanks for help!"
,Hoirc88,2012-12-01T08:25Z,"Well for some reason other people are uploading episode 8 tonight I have no idea why considering that shit is 3 weeks old.. so I have no choice but to keep attemtping to download this. I've now tried multiple different torrent clients and still no luck. And no, it's not my internet. I get 20 mbps dl speeds."
,Hoirc88,2012-12-01T08:33Z,"Well sorry I retract my previous statement. Speed finally jumped up from 20 kb/s to 1 mb/s, not sure why it took so long but hey I won't complain.. and thanks Sec for being the only one to upload this especially considered it's almost 3 a.m. and no one else has."
,ajk1980,2012-12-01T08:36Z,FFS just stop complaining and join a private site if you want fast downloads everytime. Oh and remember this shit is free!!
,extreme_one,2012-12-01T09:13Z,"2 large of a file. None of us will ever watch this show twice. If we would to save it on our HDÂ´s there is no need for a 720p file. 

The only part I would like to see in HD is the ring girls ass part nothing else. 
You could either just upload a smaller version or upload 2 versions.

This way: 

1. No complains about slow speed
2. We all can watch the show and go to sleep Saturday morning in Europe"
,extreme_one,2012-12-01T09:14Z,"You know it Sec. I have said it before and I will say it again.

The problem is also they stop streaming this shit live "
[T],SecTPB,2012-12-01T09:42Z,"@extreme_one
Stop trolling every week about two versions or how you hate HD. You're just blind. I say it every week, If you don't want it, don't download it, or download the 480p when it's out, which is usually an hour or two after I upload the 720p(minus tonight). How can you waste so much time typing complaints but can't be fucked to see there's a lower quality version of every episode, every week. Boggles my fucking mind."
,mattxball,2012-12-01T10:19Z,"@extreme_one

What part of free do you have a problem with? you can get lower quality versions if you want, so why are you bitching as if you can't? and you said it yourself, you'll only watch it one time, so don't complain about the space it takes just fucking delete it when you're done, and 720p is perfectly fine, get a decent computer. theres over 2000 leachers and only about 500 seeders and this shit takes me 5 minutes to download, whiney twat."
,extreme_one,2012-12-01T11:39Z,"@secTPB @mattxball
There is lower quality version? Where? Why dont you enlighten me. maybe I am blind. And dont start cursing and raging because I post what I want. Dont like it? Ignore me.

You 2 raging because I tell the truth? Lets do an experiment. Next time you upload 2 versions at the same time. Then we can see who is right. "
