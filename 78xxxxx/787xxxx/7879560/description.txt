Make - Ultimate Guide to 3D Printing

Considering buying a 3D printer? Trying to figure out which one is best for you? MAKE magazine's Ultimate Guide to 3D Printing offers in-depth reviews, comparisons, and recommendations for 15 top printers on the market today. There are also how-tos on scanning, 3D design, getting objects printed even if you donΓÇÖt have a printer, and lots more.
To create this special issue, we brought the top printers to our lab and hosted a weekend-long printer shootout staffed by the editors of MAKE and a number of luminaries in the field. We documented out-of-box experiences and subjected the printers to a number of print and torture tests. This issue presents our findings for you in a clear, concise manner.
