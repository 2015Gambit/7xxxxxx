Seems like my type of game! If it's good I'll definitely get it in a steam-deal once I got the cash.
Thanks esharoth!"

,ionfx6502,2012-12-02T23:07Z,"Hey guys, we found a possible fix for some laptops with lag. We pinned it to the Miasmata page on the Steam forums. Miasmata doesn't seem to be triggering the discrete GPU, so the game ends up running on the integrated Intel chip. Go into your display driver settings and ensure that Miasmata.exe is forced to use the good ATI/NVIDIA GPU as opposed to the Intel one.

We're working on a performance update to further improve things. Not ready yet though. Cheers."
