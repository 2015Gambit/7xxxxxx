,browner87,2012-12-03T04:01Z,"I haven't gotten this to install yet since my computer has a Windows Installer issue, but it tries to install to Program files (Not Program Files (x86)) so I presume it's either 64-bit or both."
,browner87,2012-12-03T04:53Z,"For the life of me I can't get this to install. I've been at it for 2 days now. Is anyone familiar with this error? (Win7 x64)

error: -1601 The windows installer service could not be accessed this can occur if the windows installer is not correctly installed

Windows installer service is running, unregistered/reregistered it, and ran CFP with a legit disc. No luck..."

,browner87,2012-12-03T18:36Z,"Thanks Ching, but trust me I spent 2 days reading all answers online :P

Eventually I followed this page for ideas on how to debug the install. Ultimately it was the WinRAR extractor causing problems, so I copied its extracted folder from Temp and ran it on my own. (http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2011/11/29/3467449.aspx)

Now it's installed and working fine (i also installed it on a clean VM and it worked no problems). I haven't actually burned anything yet, but it seems to recognize my files and stuff fine and looks great.

Thanks Ching_Liu!!"
