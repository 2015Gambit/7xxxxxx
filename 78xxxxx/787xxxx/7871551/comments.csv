,akelarre99,2012-12-03T00:58Z,"Maps installed correctly this weekend in my 2009 E-Class Coupe 350 CDI

DVDs were burned at 2x, min speed.

I did it stopped but with the engine on. I don't know if can be done only with the key, I didn't want the Comand swith off due to inactivity

Only has been necessary to introduce DVD 1, and the system recognize it, shows you the current version installed in the HDD, the new version in the DVD, and offer to make the update.

The first DVD (I burned a Verbatim DVD+R DL) takes about 2 hours, until 81% in the progression bar, then ask for the second DVD (I ejected manually one DVD and inserted the second one, a typical Verbatim DVD-R), and from 81% to 100% takes about half hour more.

You can check the version before and after the update, entering in the engineering menu (phone-hang + # + 1  for 10 seconds) in the HU information / something more I don't remember. In my case changed from ""Tele Atlas - 2009"" to ""TomTom - 2011""

Good luck, and share more than 1.0 ratio please, it's a big download to be removed as soon as downloaded.

Thanks!
