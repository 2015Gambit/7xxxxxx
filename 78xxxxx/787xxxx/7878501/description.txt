NOTES: i have noticed a slight flicker on the source
witch would suggest it was shot with a cam but a very
decent one ... the right and left side has been cropped
by source already due to security reasons and 3 blurs
for the watermarks i do believe they have used cam audio
for the start? but the film itself has line only did afew
things to this resize, altered colours, levels, contrast,
sat etc sharpend smoothend denoised hope you enjoy :)
