,stasis007,2012-12-02T02:05Z,"You need a software solution to convert to .avi. 

I use 'Pazera Free MP4 to AVI Converter'.

Simply drag the .mp4 file onto the shortcut (or open the program and drag the file(s) onto it), click on 'convert' and it'll do the rest. 

The settings for deciding where you want the new .avi to go and whether to create a new file or overwrite the .mp4 are all obvious. "
