In the small town of San Dimas, a few miles away from
Los Angeles, there are two nearly brain dead teenage
boys going by the names of Bill S, Preston ESQ. and
Ted Theodore Logan, they have a dream together of
starting their own rock and roll band called the
"Wyld Stallyns". Unfortunately, they are still in high
school and on the verge of failing out of their school
as well, and if they do not pass their upcoming history
report, they will be separated as a result of Ted's
father sending him to military school. But, what Bill
and Ted do not know is that they must stay together to
save the future. So, a man from the future named Rufus
came to help them pass their report. So, both Bill and
Ted decided to gather up historical figures which they
need for their report. They are hoping that this will
help them pass their report so they can stay together.

The world of our distant future is a veritable utopia,
thanks to the lyrics of two simple-minded 20th Century
rock and rollers, Bill S. Preston, Esq. and Ted
"Theodore" Logan. However, a would-be conquerer
threatens to throw history off-track by sending "most
non-non heinous" evil robot Bill and Teds back to kill
their good counterparts. Finding themselves dead, the
boys must outwit the Grim Reaper and traverse Heaven
and Hell to return to the land of the living, rescue
their "babes" and have a "most triumphant" concert at
the all-important Battle of the Bands..
