Lux Interior (Erick Purkhiser) and Poison Ivy Rorschach (Kristy Wallace) formed The Cramps in the late 1970s. They quickly gained acclaim, notoriety, and hitmaker status for campy, sexy studio LPs like Songs the Lord Taught Us and Gravest Hits, as well as for their legendary, over-the-top concerts that brought to mind circus freak shows. This illustrated book with exclusive interviews presents a detailed examination of The Cramps' strange and terrible journey from sleazy, theatrical inventors of a mutant fusion of punk, garage rock, psychobilly, and rock 'n' roll to genuine cult icons with devoted fan bases around the globe.
