Agn√®s Varda follows on the unique style developped on the glorious The Gleaners and I, and delivers at 80 an unidentified object, moving between art, documentary, autobiography. Yet for all the brillance of it, it's the simplicity, the humility that won me.

VIDEO :
The source is Full HD DVB-T. On the minus side the logo was broadcasted, and some imperfections because of the reception occured, tough they were short lived. Anyway there's no BluRay or any HD version of this flick available as of today, so enjoy.
