T he iPad mini is a strong contender for AppleΓÇÖs best product yet. In terms of design the iPad mini is a fairly easy concept to understand: itΓÇÖs an iPad but smaller, much lighter, and with a compelling asking price starting at just ┬ú269. WhatΓÇÖs not to love? But donΓÇÖt think the iPad mini is a stripped back model. Despite itΓÇÖs diminutive stature, the iPad miniΓÇÖs internal components are reminiscent of the iPad 2 model that on sale. Externally, however, the iPad mini has a lot in common with the latest generation of iPhone and iPod touch.
Like the iPhone 5 the fi rst thing that hits you about the iPad mini is how incredibly thin and light it is. The bezel between the screen and edge of device is also much smaller on the iPad mini. You can hold it with one hand: either by grasping both sides of the iPad mini like an iPhone, or by clasping one side. Unlike the iPad, which is very much a two-handed or rest-on-lap aff air, the light weight ensures that it can be held in the one hand. Aside from the thinner styling and smaller bezel the iPad mini is remarkably similar to the full-sized iPad. It runs the same iOS interface, all the same apps, and has the same button layout. This book is designed to get you up and running with using the iPad mini.
