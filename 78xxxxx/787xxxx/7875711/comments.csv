Knowing that you uploaded TinkerTool, this does not come as a surprise.

Try again, this time with at least 50 different sets of icons if possible. I don't because there is now no way to know what you have here.

,oneslider,2012-12-01T09:21Z,"Then don't download it mate.
Personally I don't give a fuck."
,7117,2012-12-01T11:31Z,"..if you are 12-13y old boy you may like these icons, all these icons are copied from http://www.iconarchive.com
and you can get these for free from this website.
of course it's free will DL or not this big zip file, it's your choice. imo are they 99% old and not nice looking icons.also inside zip you gonna find some useless video files (why?) and other maybe hes personal crap,... and much dupes...

,okbyme,2012-12-01T12:15Z,"Yes, oneslider, we already know that you don't give a fuck, we have evidence.

Only the very young, the very old and foolish people don't take advice. What are you?"
,oneslider,2012-12-01T20:03Z,"Well as it happens you so very knowledgeable people, these are NOT ALL from websites, as I said, some are my own.
Also I'm 62 years old, and an ex professional musician.
The reason I don't give a fuck is I can't believe you people bitch and moan about getting something for free.
Unbelievable."
[V],thegreenfrog,2012-12-01T23:22Z,"Well, most garbage is indeed free but I can check what it is before dragging it home."
,oneslider,2012-12-02T04:28Z,"Then don't download it Frog.
I'm not busting your balls, do what you like.
I'm free to upload anything I wish, as you are also.
Take it or leave it.
I'm not doing this to win any popularity, nor am I doing it to prove I'm better than anyone else.
I just do it because I can.

I don't take advice from strangers on the internet for one thing okbme, and I doubt you could teach me anything.
You do things the way you want to do them, I'll do things the way I want to do them.

,macomaniac,2012-12-02T07:59Z,"@oneslider. 

Thanks for the job of wrapping those items into one self-contained folder, including thematic sub-folders, pal. Saving me the hassle of chasing them on the Net. I have downloaded many a file from here without knowing precisely in advance what to expect in the end, even regarding applications advertised to serve for this or that use. Same stuff here : the label 'icons' says enough in a whole, and the downloading just an automatic trial, certainly not a work from myself considering I have all the time in the world for getting that kind of file. In final outcome, I find personally the icons to be most precisely drawn. I will include them into my CandyBar library."
,ClubQBall,2012-12-02T13:53Z,"@oneslider - appreciate the efforts, bud.

To the other three negative assholes:  two of you have uploaded not a goddamned thing on here, so shut the fuck up and move along and the other one has uploaded only porn.  WOW.

If you don't like it, shut yer pie-hole and move the fuck on.  It's just that simple, folks ... not a fucking hard concept to grasp."
,nikitriki,2012-12-02T14:56Z,"ok, brothers
we all here to dl free stuff and most of the times we want a good stuff,so normal! is good to read explanations for the stuff we downloading.Every effort is appreciated.However is normal to express our thoughts for free of what we downloading every time if we want or no... i mean that WE all are bolting in the same saucepan and all WE like to get involved with others for just to exchange opinions or any shit that will make our moment not  boring ...open the f@@k up and enjoy... LOL "
,oneslider,2012-12-02T21:06Z,"macomaniac ..... Thank you, all the best to you.

ClubQBall, cheers mate, well said, and thank you also.

nikltriki, agreed sir.

[V],thegreenfrog,2012-12-03T05:47Z,"I must assume oneslider is in the habit of downloading large unknown files in the hope of discovering something useful, maybe.

That is exactly what he has invited us to do. Fortunately, there is never ending supply of that."
,oneslider,2012-12-03T09:17Z,"Honesty Frog.
You want everything YOUR way.

I do download stuff that I sometimes have little idea if it will of any use, but it's free, so what the hell.

You want others to follow YOUR rules.
Like I said, if you don't want it don't download it.

An earlier comment was that there where movies in the file, NOT SO.
Personal stuff?.
Not really, some are MY work, hence it could be termed as personal.

How many times do I have to say before it seeps it to your brains.
IT""S FREE, take it or leave it I DON""T CARE."
