IsoTek - Full System Enhancer & Rejuvenation Disc


The IsoTek Full System Enhancer CD will not only burn-in and demagnetize your audio system, but will also rejuvenate it, 
allowing your gear to function at its optimum level. 


The IsoTek Full System Enhancer CD features three tracks. Track 1 (30 minutes) and Track 2 (30 minutes) are similar, 
with the second being optimized for systems with large loudspeakers and/or subwoofer(s). In general, use Track 1 for 
most stand-mounted speakers and Track 2 for floor-standing models, except perhaps the slimmest.

Track 3 (5 minutes) has been specifically developed as a quick 'spruce-up' for the hi-fi, consisting of a little of 
the 'hi-fi aerobics' from the start or Tracks 0.1 and 0.2 followed by a slightly less comprehensive demagnetization regime.

Note:
This CD is intended for educational purposes only, after which it is recommended to buy a license Compact Disc
