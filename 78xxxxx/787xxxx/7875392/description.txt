Rotterdam The Hague airport (also known as Zestienhoven) is the third Dutch airport in passenger numbers and functions as a major regional airport. Though it has limited scheduled flights there is a lot of General Aviation, business traffic and several flying schools are based there. During the vacation seasons it also handles a lot of charter traffic. 



This scenery has been done with great attention to detail according to the most up to date ideas on making scenery for FSX. It is very good looking but it is also frame rate friendly. As default FSX is not brilliant in this region a large area is included around the airport so the circuits and VFR approaches are possible with great realism.
