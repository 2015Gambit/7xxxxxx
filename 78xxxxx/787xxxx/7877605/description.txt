Architect JD (John Lloyd Cruz) has a chip on his shoulder about his businessman father Rico (Ronaldo Valdez) 

never really accepting him as his son. Seamstress Sari (Bea Alonzo) struggles to take care of her family. 

The two meet by chance, and JD aggressively pursues SariΓÇÖs affections. Though the two are clearly a good match, 

there is a problem standing in the way of their bliss: Sari is the mistress of JDΓÇÖs father. Against his better judgment, 

JD continues to court Sari even after finding out this difficult fact. He hides his true identity as RicoΓÇÖs son, 

and fights to win SariΓÇÖs heart.
