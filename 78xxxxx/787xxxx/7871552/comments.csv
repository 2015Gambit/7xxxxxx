,slackrack,2012-12-03T08:58Z,"Just finished translating...there is no menu option for languages.  Feel free to poke around anyway, the order of the normal start menu is:

NEW GAME
LOAD GAME
SETTINGS
PLOT [PROTOTYPE]
CREDITS
EXIT TO DESKTOP

Under ""settings"" you'll have 3 tabs that say ИГРА (""GAME""), ГРАФИКА (""GRAPHICS""), and ЗВУК (""SOUND"").  The game menu is as such:

KEYBOARD LAYOUT
HORIZONTAL VIEW - HELLER     NORMAL
VERTICAL VIEW - HELLER         NORMAL
VERTICAL VIEW - TANK            NORMAL
VERTICAL VIEW - HELICOPTER  NORMAL
INVERT VERTICAL TARGETING
DEFAULT CONTROLLER              KEYBOARD + MOUSE
MOUSE SENSITIVITY               HIGH - 15

The graphics menu is about as useless:

BRIGHTNESS
PERSPECTIVE                1440x900
ANTI-ALIASING LEVEL    HIGH
SYNCHRONIZATION       ON
SHADOW DETAIL           AVERAGE
SPATIAL REFLECTION    ON
MOTION BLUR               ON
EFFECTS QUALITY          HIGH
RENDER DISTANCE        AVERAGE

Sad news indeed, but hopefully someone found this useful."
