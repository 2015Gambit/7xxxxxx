And TPB has removed the steam-client link. You can easily google it though."

,jKlark,2012-12-01T18:50Z,"@praveen0553 Thank you for letting me know.

I can see 85 seeders right now, could you guys please leave more comments & ratings to convince future downloaders?"
,karolek1990,2012-12-01T20:18Z,The game runs but after turning off the game.... there is no save 
,karolek1990,2012-12-02T00:08Z,Fix it pleas 
,jKlark,2012-12-02T13:04Z,"@karolek1990 The problem you're facing is related to the crack. My fix has nothing to do with it.

Try reinstalling the game or something, my game saves the progress just fine."
,metroidmen,2012-12-02T16:55Z,"Hate to say, didn't work for me... Win 8 Pro x64. Have latest drivers, latest updates, even tried updating the game, still won't do anything. I click the exe and it doesn't even crash. It just does nothing... This gave me hope but alas, failed..."

Have you installed steam? Believe it or not, a bunch of new games simply won't run without steam. Hitman Absolution is one of them."
,metroidmen,2012-12-03T05:53Z,"@jKlark

I've always had it installed. I have a bunch of games with it. I tried reinstalling and adding HMA to the nonsteam games list. No luck."
,karolek1990,2012-12-03T13:39Z,This crack is not working does not save save
,jKlark,2012-12-03T20:11Z,"@karolek1990

Are you stupid or what? I already told you this is NOT a crack. It just replaces 2 tiny game files that were causing the crash on certain PCs.

@metroidmen

Well i can't think of anything else. Sorry."
