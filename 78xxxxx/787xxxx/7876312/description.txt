Does Hitman Absolution crash on startup on your PC? If so, jKlark is once again here to save the day.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I've made this tiny fix, which will let you overcome the startup crash of the game, specially on the new Windows 8 OS.

Although if the game doesn't run at all for you, then this tiny fix likely won't help. But i will let you know that you're supposed to install Steam (client) on your PC for it to work. (just like Call of Duty: Black Ops 2)

Download Steam client here:

-----------------

Installation:

It is a self extraction archive, so just select the location where you installed the game. (let the default one if you installed on the default location)
