,curry98,2012-12-01T17:16Z,is this full game not familiar with repacks
,MationMac,2012-12-01T20:25Z,"@curry98 Repacks are smaller because they have some things removed. Normally they remove languages (remaining stated in title), manuals and other things one does not need."
,Green.Lantern,2012-12-01T23:46Z,Anyone else getting a black screen?
,xXAstrixxXx,2012-12-02T04:07Z,"Downloading at approx. 400kb/sec. 

Seriously, the seeders on this one are my heroes. You can't find a larger seed ratio on any other FarCry 3 torrent right now; this game isn't even released in North America yet. 

Will seed for as long as I can, if it works. Thank you guys!!!"
,XxMATIxX,2012-12-02T04:19Z,HOLY SHIT THIS WORKS NO SAVE ISSUE OR ANYTHING THX !!!!!!!
,vecuccio,2012-12-02T06:10Z,"""This application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142) - Farcry3.exe Application Error""

I have XP64, which according to UBI is fine to run the game. The above error is the kind of thing you get for an incorrect OS, so I am wondering if the re-packer ONLY included Vista / 7 files ?

Either way, it didn't work for me."
,xXAstrixxXx,2012-12-02T07:17Z,"Oh, and by the way: it worked. 

I did have to reinstall once because I didn't have any sound, but other than that, it works perfectly so far. 

Thanks again!"

,tact1cal,2012-12-02T20:07Z,"Game installed well, HOWEVER, there are no character voices; not in the Intro, not in the first mission.

Anyone have any tips? I meet all minimum requirements, updated sound drivers. P.S. I don't have Steam installed. "
