Description :
  The main character, Jason Brody, goes on vacation with friends at an extraordinarily beautiful tropical island. And then he is held hostage by a band of pirates led by a mad killer Vaasa. From this point on, your task - to survive at any cost. Jason will be embroiled in a bloody war between the pirates and the local rebels, in which the blood lead and drugs flow like water. Some psychopaths fighting with others, and soon the protagonist is no longer able to distinguish the opium dream of mad waking. Crazy Island's crazy anyone set foot on its shores, and you have to be crazy to stay here. Are you insane?
