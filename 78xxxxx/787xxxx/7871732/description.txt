How many of us can honestly say we do not suffer from at least one of the following:

Colds or viruses each year
Allergies or hay fever
Extra pounds that won't come off
Restless nights
Recurrent indigestion, constipation, or irritable bowel syndrome
Itchy skin, acne, or any other troubling skin condition
Depression, anxiety, or frequent fatigue
If you were to seek medical advice for any of the above, you would likely be prescribed pills, topical lotions, injections, or even surgery. Such treatments are used to manage the symptoms and do not address the root of the problem. Too often, doctors treat these common ailments as inevitable costs of living a modern life. The result is a patchwork approach to health care that has become the norm.
