1. Device eth0 must exists. The FlexLM license tool always check the
serial number according to eth0 MAC address. If you have more ethernet
card always check, that the eth0 has a same MAC address. Also in 
distribution like Fedora Core you will need to rename ethernet device
back to eth0 (set biosdevname=0 as kernel parameter during the boot,
or set a udev scripts which is more difficult).

2. The keygen MentorKG.exe is windows binary, but can be used also
with WINE if you do not have a dual boot. You will need WINE
installed.

3. Installation of ModelSim is i386 binary. So i386 libraries are
still required for installation and also for WINE.

4. Install ModelSim by running ./install.linux and choose a target
directory, for example /opt or /usr/local.

5. Copy the MentorKG.exe into the target directory and run it:

wine MentorKG.exe -patch . -hn -o license.dat

The output of command is:
