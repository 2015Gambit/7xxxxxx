During the latter half of 2012, Conor Oberst introduced and played 3 new songs while touring with the Mystic Valley Band, Desaparecidos, and at a few solo shows. I did a search for the best quality versions of these songs that I could find, and am now sharing them with you guys.


They are:

Common Knowledge (Live Version @ Royce Hall 9.27.12)
Kick (Live Version @ ArtQuests Bethlehem, PA 7.24.12)
You Are Your Mother's Child (Studio Version for the 2013 movie "Writers")




Hope you enjoy! :)
