Don't Starve (29 Nov 2012) from


Nov 29 Hotfix update:

*pigs take longer to respawn from their houses
*gobblers spawn with a couple second delay
*grass tufts need manure to regrow
*pigs voraciously eat all food left on the ground
*golden tools are less OP (but still better than flint)
*red gems are a "sometimes loot"
*tallbird eggs aren't as filling/healing
*you can't place buildings and trees as close together, so that you can't build ad-hoc walls. You'll get real walls eventually, but for the meantime you'll probably want to invest in a pig-shield 
*chests have no collision, because they're small, and chest fortresses are just plain weird

*fixed some disappearing backpack / item dupe exploits
*space bar won't attack non-hostiles by default (CTRL-spacebar will, though)
*fixed up some misc obscure lua crashes
*researching a red gem shouldn't crash
