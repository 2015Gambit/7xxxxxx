Tunesia is besides a proud Northern African nation also a major tourist destination and well known to millions of sunseekers. Monastir is the centre of that tourist trade, with its beaches and fine hotels. Monastir H. Bourguiba Airport is a remake of the one we had for FS2004 and updates the airport to the current status in full FSX glory. 



The Habib Bourguiba International Airport is located in the east of Tunisia. It is named after the founder of the Tunisian Republic and longtime president Habib Bourguiba. Many tourists from all around the world travel to Monastir each year. It was opened in 1968 and since 2008 it is being run by the Turkish AV Airports Holding.
