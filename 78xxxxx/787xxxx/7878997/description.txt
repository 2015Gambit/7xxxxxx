"Michigan metal act I am Abomination, even after losing all but two of their members and essentially becoming the Panic! At The Disco of metal, has a lot going for them. An amazingly skilled guitarist and an amazingly skilled vocalist both with a high degree of song writing prowess have culminated in a sizeable fan base for the band. Their latest offering Let The Future Tell The Truth, has the band exploring more progressive elements of their unique brand of metal that in no way redefine the band, but do provide another fun metal romp for our speakers to loudly blare from our cars."
