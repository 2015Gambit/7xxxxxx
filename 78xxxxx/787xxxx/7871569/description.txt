The simple life is shaken when death comes to the small, quiet Louisiana town of Bon Temps -- where civilians, vampires, shape-shifters, and mind readers clash in an orgy of sex & mystery. When a dead body is found with the heart ripped out, local waitress, Sookie (Ashlynn Brooke), who has a talent for reading minds, her best friend, Tara (Misty Stone), and her Vampire boyfriend, Bill (James Deen), try to unravel the supernatural web and find the murderer. Sookie and her friends find themselves pushing all their limits, both mentally and sexually, in a climax you'll have to see to believe! The mix of sex, horror, and action is so hot, it must be TRU: A XXX Parody
