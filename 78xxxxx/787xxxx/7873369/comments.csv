I'm trying different clients to see if one of them handles our problem with non-sharing peers gobbling up all of my bandwidth before we get any seeders out there.

By the way I've located a few of the lost sets, so I'll be posting them right after we get Tina going good here."

I've been using Âľtorrent for years and it's just fine for the normal user, but for an initial seeder, it has design flaws that are really irritating.  BitLord manages to distribute the packets pretty evenly, meaning a good portion of my actual output is reaching those of you who do share it while and after downloading.  "
