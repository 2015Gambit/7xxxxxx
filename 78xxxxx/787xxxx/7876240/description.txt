Bebop lovers remember Clifford (brownie) Brown but who amongst us remembers Booker

Little?  


Neither trumpeter reached age 30.
 

If "Honest Abe" had been a jazz critic he might have described Booker's lifespan

as 1 score and 3.............even less time than Clifford had.  As with Art Tatum,

Booker died of uremia (kidney failure.)  Brownie died on the highway.


The thing about Booker is dissonance.  Dissonance is what made Ellington great.

Dissonance is harmonic complexity.  It adds a pleasant confusion and thickness

to music.


This record is the last of Booker's 4 albums as leader.
