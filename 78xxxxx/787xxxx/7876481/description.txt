Paroma or (English title: The Ultimate Woman) (1984) is an award-winning feature film directed by Aparna Sen.

The movie is about a 40-year-old married woman, Paroma (Raakhee) who falls in love with Rahul (Mukul Sharma), an expatriate photo-journalist working for glossy magazines who photographs her making her look glamorous. Their affair, and the invasion of the glamour machine into her life, becomes a problem when some of the photographs, earlier admired by the family, are published in a journal. Paroma is rejected by her husband and has a mental breakdown. In the end, a doctor suggests prescribing psychiatric treatment and when Paroma adamantly refuses any sense of guilt, her young daughter comes and gives her mother moral support.
