___________

- When using the Apple Dictation service in Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, NeoOffice would ignore the ""new paragraph"" and ""new line"" commands 

- When running a slideslow in Impress, NeoOffice would sometimes show the first slide as a blank black screen 

- Gradient backgrounds would be drawn with jagged edges or with diagonal lines superimposed on the gradient when running a slideshow, printing, or exporting to PDF 

- NeoOffice would crash when trying to quit while a large document was being saved 

- NeoOffice would crash when opening certain .xls files 

- NeoOffice would occasionally hang when quitting


Is that better?"
