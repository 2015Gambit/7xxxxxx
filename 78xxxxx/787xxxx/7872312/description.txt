One of the most acclaimed young voices of his generation, Blake Butler now offers his first work of nonfiction: a deeply candid and wildly original look at the phenomenon of insomnia.

Invoking scientific data, historical anecdote, Internet obsession, and figures as diverse as Andy Warhol, Gilles Deleuze, John Cage, Anton LaVey, Jorge Luis Borges, Brian Eno, and Stephen King, Butler traces the tension between sleeping and conscious life. And he reaches deep into his own experienceΓÇöfrom disturbing waking dreams, to his fatherΓÇÖs struggles with dementia, to his own epic 129-hour bout of insomniaΓÇöto reveal the effect of sleeplessness on his imaginative landscape.

The result is an exhilarating exploration of dream and awareness, desperation and relief, consciousness and conscienceΓÇöa fascinating maze-map of the borders between sleep and the waking world by one of todayΓÇÖs most talked-about writers.
