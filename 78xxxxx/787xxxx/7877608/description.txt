This is the episode that's missing from my Torchwood torrent:
 
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7832167

Technical info is included in that torrent.

I apologize for not including this in the torrent. Still getting used to making torrents. ^_^; The program I'd used to grab the eps from my iPod didn't grab this one the first time around for some reason. :/

Anyways, I'm going to upload the whole Torchwood series again with the missing ep included as well around Dec. 10th. Unfortunately, between the Doctor Who and Torchwood, I've nearly used up my 2TB of upload bandwidth on my seedbox. So I won't be uploading any new series for a couple weeks either. Until then!
