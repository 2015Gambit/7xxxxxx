Well, all I could see from my end was tiny. But knowing it's only 11 seconds is kind of a relief. I was worried that '08 is almost two minutes shorter than '07.

The dilemma is always ""give them damaged or give them nothing"". I tried to prepare ""the need for right now"" gang, and I think it's a decent decision on my part.

For those who waited (or want both) - someone has realized their mistake and I'm posting an undamaged version ... NOW ...
