Spelled "Fixed" wrong so you'd come see this:
Recommend waiting for an undamaged copy.
.
At 1:30 there is a visable transitional glitch - lasts a full second (24 frames)
But the reason it's rare is that it needed some serious sound Magic applied.
I honestly cannot tell you how much is missing - seems like it's .44 seconds.
