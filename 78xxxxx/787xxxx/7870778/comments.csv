Rondo finished the game with just six points and three assists after being thrown out during the closing seconds of the second quarter. The point guard retaliated against Kris Humphries after he committed a hard foul against Kevin Garnett and the two players dragged each other into the crowd, which resulted in their ejections. Gerald Wallace also was ejected after being whistled for his second technical during the scuffle."
