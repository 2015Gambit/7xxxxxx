HD version DRM free"
,bell3nd,2012-12-02T20:15Z,"so far, we have:

one HD version, improperly ripped and full of stutters.  UNWATCHABLE.

one SD version, improperly ripped and hypercompressed.  UNWATCHABLE.

one more version, which remains a mystery cos none of us can get past 68% downloaded.  UNFORGIVABLE.

nobody takes the dissemination of skate vids seriously.  there oughta be a dedicated group."
,bell3nd,2012-12-02T20:18Z,"well blow me down, and pardon me.  the version t3dious linked to is a new contender.  grabbing that now.  i do hope we finally have a watchable copy here."
