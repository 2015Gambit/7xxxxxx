,bcxanth,2012-12-01T05:55Z,Looks like you might have uploaded the wrong files on accident.  I downloaded this and checked the Ver.lua file.  It says it's version 5473 and not 5488.
,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-12-01T06:15Z,"Ver.lua isn't updated but this has several updated files, maybe it was Zygor's mistake"
,bcxanth,2012-12-01T06:57Z,"That file should be updated, however I considered the possiblity it was not.  So I still installed it and checked.  In-game version number is still 4.0.5473 and none of the new content is in the guides."
,EXPERIMENTONGOD,2012-12-01T07:19Z,"Yeah you're right, just loaded up the guide it's not 5488 at all"
,TalonTopher,2012-12-01T15:53Z,Are u gonna get 405488 or does anyone know of a working one? Would appreciate it!
