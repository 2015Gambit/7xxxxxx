From 1953 to 1955, Mingus was one of several musicians who contributed pieces

to a Jazz Composer's Workshop.  Their ambitious collaborations were documented by 

Savoy and are presented here.  A bonus track, O.P. (for Oscar Pettiford), comes

from a later performance of Mingus with a dynamic Japanese big band............
