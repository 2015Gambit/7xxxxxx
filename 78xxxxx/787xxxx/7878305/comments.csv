,NaNaMoose,2012-12-02T03:18Z,Thanks for all that you do. I get most of my TV stuff from you guys and I would like to give back. I just got 20MB+ internet and I would be very happy to help BUT I don't know how to use the IRC :( Yea well please contact me here or message me on KAT. Thanks again!
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-12-02T03:26Z,@NaNaMoose: It's so nice to see someone willing to give back! There so many users who don't think about the work and resources others invest so that they can get torrents (and then they often complain that things aren't exactly how they want them). Kudos to you!

,ScarletteSpider,2012-12-03T04:20Z,"i have the same prob as NaNaMoose, want to be a seeder member for eztv. But they upload auto and never read these. I use skpe cause its more user friendly. Tried to learn the rocket science if IRC to reach them but whatever their group there is called they don't say and it doesnt come up under the obvious name. So I seed from here till no one is pulling from me before I delete them. Hopefully eztv will figure out those of us that qualify and want to help as members need a more user friendly way to reach them to register. I get most of my stuff from them too, only stuff I dont is the stuff they dont carry. 
Hopefully they are keeping an eye on the new shows slated to premiere/return in Jan, March and May like Dracula (same lead actor that did Henry 8 in Tudors), Crossbones, Do No Harm, Mistresses, Red Widow, 1600 Penn Ave, The Carrie Diaries (Sex in the City prequel new series), amd Zero Hour for new shows.
Grimm, Vampire Diaries, Fashion Star, Project Runway All Stars, Arrow, Face Off, Hot Set, Supernatural, Pretty Little Liars, Real Time with Bill Maher, Drop Dead Diva, Game of Thrones, Ultimate Spiderman, Newsroom, Borgias, Veep, True Blood, Warehouse 13, Jane By Design, Bunheads, Royal Pains, SYTYCD, Boss for the returning shows, (can you tell I have teenaged kids? lol)
Thanks for all you do eztv and keep up the good high quality work just in case some does check in once in a blue moon to read the posts here."
