,macwun,2012-11-29T15:07Z,thanks! Having a high end audio system I'm always looking for DTS rips. Appreciate it. Wish someone would tell YIFI to encode his rips in 5.1 but I can't leave comments on his torrents due to some database error. Thanks for your efforts
,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-11-29T15:34Z,"YIFY's excessively-compressed rips appeal to people who watch them on their 13'' laptops because only then can you not detect how terrible audio/video quality is. They're not worth downloading even if you own a half-decent audio system and a 19'' monitor.

And you don't need to thank me for my 'effort' because this isn't exactly my rip. I just grabbed it from a Russian tracker and uploaded it here.  There were other uploads here already with equivalent quality but with over 10k leechers, you're going to get it from there at snail's pace. This was a much quicker download for me and I thought others could use a download speed boost as well. Enjoy."
