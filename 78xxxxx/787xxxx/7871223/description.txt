Cleveland takes a reluctant Cleveland, Jr. to a turkey farm in order
to teach him how to hunt the family's Thanksgiving dinner. But Junior
refuses to harm the innocent turkeys. So when Cleveland is accidentally
shot, he and Junior embark on an elaborate mission to free all of the
turkeys before Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, Rallo and Donna build a float
for Stoolbend's Thanksgiving Day parade, but Rallo takes matters into
his own hands when Donna fails to embrace his artistic vision.
