As usual, the most talented musicians inhabit the shadows; essential assistants

in the creation of other peoples' fame.


These are usually vocalists, with really nice hair.  Fletcher Henderson comes to

mind.  Although Benny Goodman's hair wasn't much of a factor. 



Jeff Berlin brings the Electric Bass into the frontline, like Jack Bruce did 

with Cream.


I'm thinking this is jazz fusion, but that's such a derogatory pigeonhole.



For "fusion,"  this music is unusually melodic with pop song hooks and lots of 

interesting changes.  The vocals aren't the best part.  Bach may have given it

a thumbs up.
