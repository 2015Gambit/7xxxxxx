Title: Amore, Elvis
Label: Straight Arrow
Recording Type: Live Audience
Location: Las Vegas
Date: 29 March 1975 DS & MS
Sound: Very Good/Good

Continuing the Straight Arrow series of two concerts on the same night.  Very good audience recordings.  Elvis is upbeat and the shows are great.  The MS has some tape noise.  The "lowlight" of the DS is Sherrill Nielsen's interpretation of Hawaiian Wedding Song - ugghhh!!!!

Press note

Straight Arrow is continuing their collector's series of 2 shows from one evening, released in a single package. This time the producers have chosen two excellent performances from Saturday, March 29, 1975 at the Las Vegas Hilton.
Elvis returned to Nevada in very good form when compared to his final shows of 1974. He included several cuts from soon-to-be-released "TODAY" album rather than some of his usual oldies. Presley's shows were shorter than his previous Vegas visit in August and September because he kept banter to a minimum.
On this collection there are worthy performances of "And I Love You So", "It's Midnight", "Big Boss Man", "Burning Love" and the powerful "My Boy". There are also some rarities, like a one-liner of "Rip It Up", "Tiger Man" not performed as a medley with "Mystery Train," and "Hawaiian Wedding Song" sung exclusively by Sherrill Nielsen.
As fans have come to expect, the tapes are of very good quality, sourced from early generation copies of original cassettes recorded by the same fan. The double digipak contains liner notes and is filled with photos from the March-April 1975 engagement. As usual, these recordings have been carefully engineered to be presented in the best possible sound.
