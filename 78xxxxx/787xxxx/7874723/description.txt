We all have good and bad inclinations. The protagonists of this film follow only the bad, hopelessly. Each of them did not choose the path of redemption, spending their days between illegal gambling, dirty business, betrayal and turns of laundered money. Their lives intertwine for a moment and perhaps change their destinies.
