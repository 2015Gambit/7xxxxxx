Muddy Waters and The Rolling Stones: Checkerboard Lounge Live Chicago 1981



from the DVD cover:


On 22 November 1981, in the middle of their mammoth American tour, 

the Rolling Stones arrived in Chicago prior to playing 3 nights at 

the Rosemont Horizon. Long influenced by the Chicago blues, the band 

paid a visit to Muddy WatersΓÇÖ club the Checkerboard Lounge to see the 

legendary bluesman perform. It didnΓÇÖt take long before Mick Jagger, 

Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Ian Stewart were joining in on stage 

and later Buddy Guy and Lefty Dizz also played their part. It was a 

unique occasion that was fortunately captured on camera. Now, 

restored from the original footage and with sound mixed and mastered 

by Bob Clearmountain, this amazing blues night is being made 

available in an official release for the first time.
