Description / Review:
------------------------
Release 12/18/2012
Thinking Machines will release their new album Extension Chords this winter. They have spent the past 2 years working tirelessly on the record and have expanded on the 2 guitar attack heard on their previous record Work Tapes. Extension Chords is a return to form so to speak as it bridges the gap between the expansive space rock of their first album Dream in Lo Fi and the post punk new wave of A Complete Record of Urban Archaeology. Fans of those earlier records should be pleasantly surprised by the space-metal prog-punk psychedelia found here. This will be one of your favorite records of the year.
