,Amafule10,2012-12-02T13:04Z,"This is the US version. The version uploaded about a month ago by YIFY was a Russian version (almost no difference though, it was pretty good)"
,sapo_joe,2012-12-02T13:08Z,"I strongly recommend visiting the yify's website (http://www.yify-torrents.org )

It's so clean and organized, it's hard to believe it's free. There you'll find all of theyr releases, sort and search for them.

Great job!"
