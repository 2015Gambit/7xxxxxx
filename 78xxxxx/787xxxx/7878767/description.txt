Dance Gavin Dance is an American post-hardcore band formed in Sacramento, California in 2005.
The band is well known for their relatively frequent lineup changes, which, most notably, involves a fluctuating lineup of clean and unclean vocalists, both on tour and on record. Dance Gavin Dance incorporates many different musical genres into their palette, such as screamo, funk, soul and more recently hip-hop on top of its post-hardcore sound. Ex-vocalist Jonny Craig also received high marks for contributing to the band's unorthodox soul sound and guitarist Will Swan has been recognized for his intricate, fast-moving guitar licks and riffs.
