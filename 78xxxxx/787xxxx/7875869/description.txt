There are some real good ones in here. This torrent includes everything in my collection with the "zombie" tag. Some don't seem like they belong, but oh, well.

As with all spanikopita books, I use Google Books, Goodreads and Amazon as my tag source. Some conversions were done using versions of Calibre and occasionally Sigil.

AZW, EPUB, MOBI and PDF files. There may be some ARCs in here too. But I won't complain, especially since some of these are pre-press still.

I suggest combining my torrent with Edge316s at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7372564 for a really nice collection.
