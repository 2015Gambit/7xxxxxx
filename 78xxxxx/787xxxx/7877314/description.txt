 I took the liberty of ripping all of Ghost Town's music so far. (12/1/12)
This includes:

-DREAMER
-MONSTER
-TENTACLES
-Game Freak
-Off With Her Head
-Trick Or Treat
-You're So Creepy
-Zombie Girl
-Ghost In The Machine

 They have all their proper album art and are standard MP3 rip (320 kb)
 The only thing wrong is DREAMER's album art, and it is sadly not 'HD' like the others, but it is still 500x500, Sorry!

Remember to seed!
