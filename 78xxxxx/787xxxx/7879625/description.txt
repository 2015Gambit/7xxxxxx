This is a first album from the American punk/metal/grind legends Dystopia. I love this release. Dystopia are one mother fucking great brutal band that connects me with a lot of stuff that I like (smoking weed, wanting to be left alone by the humanity, dying from alcoholism, etc.). Take notice, the last song ("Sleep") has an almost 20 minutes long silence gap and I've left it like it is (didn't cut it up). You should just let it play, maybe you'll fall asleep (like I did when I first listened to this release) and get scared when the song kicks back in. Dystopia rules!
