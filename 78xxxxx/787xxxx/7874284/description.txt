PlayStation Download Manager / Booster is an application designed to increase the download speeds of the PlayStation Network, it can install both free and paid content as long as you’ve paid for it.

In order to create a speed boost, it creates multiple segments which will draw data from the servers using multi-threading, this allows you to achieve the maximum speed of your line; unlike the PS3 which uses only 1 transfer.

Your PC can also be faster at downloading in general due to several factors, including it’s connection method, processor speed, RAM and TCP Optimizations.
