Seasick Steve - Songs For Elisabeth (2010).mp3


This 7 track collection of songs from previous album sessions, represents Seasick Steves alternative valentines gift, an interesting gift and one thats bound to spark an interesting reaction should it find itself as the alternative to a box of chocolates or dinner.

 The marketing concept behind this mini album may be ultimately flawed but the tracks themselves combine to make it a fine showcase of Seasick Steve's most heartfelt work. However, there are no tear jerker's here; Eight Ball is testament to this as it kicks the album off in modest style in which a typically bluesy intro is met by an echoed vocal to thrilling effect. Walking Man carries on this modest approach with the obedient lyrics you say jump, I say how high, my names Steve I'm the walking man. Just Like a King is a far more flamboyant affair, indulgent solos are fused with short breaks for vocals I'm a prize fighter baby, before folding back into a blues jam. This before the album only new track, Ready For Love, raps things up nicely with an array of loopy drums and vocoders.

Seasick Steve ΓÇô A sixty-seventy-something year old ex-Hobo from Mississippi who over the last 5 years or so has gone from zero to hero. I guess it must have a lot to do with how authentic he is, as far removed from the pop scene as possible, apparently he still lives in a banged out old camper that heΓÇÖs had forever. The only difference is that now itΓÇÖs full of Jack Daniels Whiskey cos they wanted to sponsor him.
