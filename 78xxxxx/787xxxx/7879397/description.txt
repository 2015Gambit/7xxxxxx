Harriet Reisen - Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women

Unabridged, 96 kbps, Read by the Author

Overview
In a fresh, modern take on the remarkable Louisa May Alcott, Harriet ReisenΓÇÖs vivid biography explores the authorΓÇÖs life in the context of her works, many of which are to some extent autobiographical. Although Alcott secretly wrote pulp fiction, harbored radical abolitionist views, and served as a Civil War nurse, her novels went on to sell more copies than those of Herman Melville and Henry James. Stories and details culled from AlcottΓÇÖs journals, together with revealing letters to family, friends, and publishers, plus recollections of her famous contemporaries provide the basis for this lively account of the authorΓÇÖs classic rags-to-riches tale. In Louisa May Alcott, the extraordinary woman behind the beloved American classic Little Women is revealed as never before.

Publishers Weekly
If Beth, Meg, Amy, and Jo are forever fixed in your memory, youΓÇÖll be fascinated by this well-researched and well-written biography of the author of Little Women. But Reisen is only an adequate reader of her own work. She has a lovely low-pitched voice, but a narrow vocal range and little ability to provide dramatic energy or diversity to her narrative and characters. This diminishes the listenerΓÇÖs emotional connection to members of the Alcott family and the famous transcendentalists and feminists who peopled LouisaΓÇÖs very turbulent life. 

Library Journal
Public television writer and producer Reisen's biography is the result of a deeply held, lifelong affection for Louisa May Alcott; it's a substantial by-product of the research undertaken to write and produce a documentary film biography of the same title to air December 2009 as part of the PBS "American Masters" series. Reisen's writing is lively and appealing. She analyzes Alcott's best-known worksΓÇöLittle Women, Little Men, and Jo's BoysΓÇöas well as Pauline's Passion and Punishment, Behind a Mask, and Perilous Play, the pulp fiction Alcott wrote anonymously or as A.M. Barnard. Drawing extensively from Alcott's journals and letters as well as those of her family members, Reisen portrays Alcott's life with precision and sympathy yet does not hide her flaws. This compelling biography allows readers to know Alcott and appreciate her as "her own best character." VERDICT Highly recommended for Alcott fans as well as readers interested in American women writers and women's studies.
