02 - X is Y:

An acute and provocative outfit occupying their own corner in Shanghai’s live music scene, X is Y is a two-piece rock act that offers the confounding but variously cathartic rhythms and sonic structures of math rock delivered with an agenda to self-evisceration and public sacrifice. Since forming in 2010, the band has pushed their unorthodox and unflinchingly idiosyncratic design in venues large and small in Shanghai, and they’ve also frequently appeared on several stages in the greater China region. In transferring their powerful live act to disc on their latest recordings -- “Never Sever” and “LP” -- X is Y have taken a self-consciously pious DIY approach, endeavoring to capture and convey the honest minutiae of recorded performance with the intensity of emotional surrender.
