Dagosto's own analysis: These two albums represent an act that can (when it wishes) rock fairly hard. More often, though, they are gentler pop-rock. They also incorporate a variety of familiar international styles: ΓÇ£Nikki Hoi,ΓÇ¥ for example, is decidedly Hawaiian slack-key sounding, and ΓÇ£Carlos and the Bull,ΓÇ¥ with its flamenco guitar stylings, affects a Spanish (or Mexican) flair. The duo could also echo such current influences as progressive rock; witness the suite-like 7-minute-plus ΓÇ£Marmendy Mill.ΓÇ¥ Lighthearted, humorous, and fun-loving, Flo & Eddie were a precursor of later acts such as They Might Be Giants or Barenaked Ladies: serious musicians doing serious music, and more than simply a novelty act doing novelty songs.
