Ep 12: Parents Fly South
Joanna's mother comes to Miami to give her a heart to heart about love and life that ends in tears.
PREMIERE: Thursday November 29, 9 pm

When Lisa's overbearing in-laws show up and demand a grandchild, Lisa goes to extreme measures to conceive. Adriana throws an unforgettable party for Fredric's parent's 50th wedding anniversary that has her questioning if she's really ready to get married again. Tensions between Marysol and Elaine come to a boiling point as they finally sit down and hash it out. And Joanna's mother comes to Miami to give her a heart to heart about love and life that ends in tears. But everyone takes a moment to celebrate family and freedom over a Passover Seder.
