plzzzzzzzzzzzz. "
,dududus,2012-12-02T19:00Z,"Works from 3.55, 4.21, 4.30 CFW without downgrade.

European PSN/SEN users will get an annoying Singstar icon, just like the OFW users. No biggie though.

Update directly from XMB.

X:/PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP

If you are on OFW 3.56+ you need to get your console downgraded first. Cost around $50.

This CFW is extremely well tested and stable with no DEX patches. Very close to OFW.

No bricks reported from thousands of users.

Two thumbs up!"
