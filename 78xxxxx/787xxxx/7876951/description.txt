                         DESCRiPTiON  

 Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant are outraged that Karl has written off the 
 Seven Wonders claiming theyre all a bit s**t having never seen any of them 
 with his own eyes. Theyve thrown down the gauntlet to send him around the globe 
 to force him out of his comfort zone. Stephen wants the experience to broaden 
 Karls mind and change his outlook on the world. Ricky wants Karl to hate every 
 minute of it for his own amusement.

 Dispatched on what many would term a journey of a lifetime, the little 
 Englander will be putting his misgivings to one side as Karl finds out for 
 himself what the fuss is about. He will travel to the Great Wall of China, 
 Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen 
 Itza in Mexico, the Taj Mahal in India and the Great Pyramids of Egypt. 
 Meanwhile Gervais and Merchant will be keeping a watchful eye from London, 
 monitoring every step of Pilkingtons journey. The conclusion of the series will 
 see the weary traveler returning home to report on his findings.

 Karl commented: I cant wait to get started. Not cos Im excited but cos the 
 sooner we start the sooner it will be over. The fact the nurse gave me an 
 injection that protects me from dirty chimps put a dampener on the whole thing. 
 I dont think Ross Kemp has to have that injection. (Source: Sky One)
