This torrent actually DOES have all 63 songs from the 2007 game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland (the seventh in the console series). There was a companion CD released with 14 covers of classic punk songs by new punk/alternative bands (Dropkick Murphys, Rise Against etc.), and this torrent contains all the songs from that disc, plus the other 49 from the in-game soundtrack.


These all are in 160kbps MP3 with artwork, properly tagged for your convenience.
