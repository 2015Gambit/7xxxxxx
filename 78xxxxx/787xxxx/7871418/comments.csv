,phase700b,2012-11-30T16:37Z,Somebody gave this a -1 on quality. Why.  Highcode encodes always look great to me. Hows this one.

You should ignore ratings, read comments instead.
If no comments then all is ok (no news is good news). Some sad uploader is doing it, who envies me for doing more and better encodes then him. Let him enjoy his games, he's a pathetic loser.
Look here, after about 15 min from uploading I got about 20 minuses lol.
