Storyline:


Imagine if one day, out of the blue, your wildest dreams came true! That's exactly what happens to junior executive Larry Burrows (James Belushi - Taking Care Of Business) when he bumps into a mysterious stranger (Michael Caine - Miss Congeniality, The Cider House Rules). Instantly, Larry's ho-hum life becomes his ultimate fantasy - huge mansion, beautiful wife, cars galore! But before long, his new lifestyle isn't so enchanting. Ultimately, Larry discovers it's going to take a lot more than wishful thinking to get back to where he once belonged! Co-starring Terminator 2's Linda Hamilton and comedian Jon Lovitz (Little Nicky, Rat Race), "Mr. Destiny" is a delightful rags-to-riches comedy brimming with totally magical entertainment!
