I could not seem to find any updated RB3 wads that unlocked all of the current DLC, so I looked around and found out how to update them myself.

This torrent includes an updated 9th Generation wad (sZLE) as well as the most recent Generation wad (sZME). This will unlock songs all the way up to "Call me Maybe". This DOES NOT include any previous generation wads (sZAE, sZBE, sZCE, sZDE, sZEE, sZFE, sZJE, and sZKE) as they are already up-to-date and can easily be found in other torrents.

I don't really care to explain how to install these wads, but you can easily Google it or perhaps find a write up from an older torrent.
