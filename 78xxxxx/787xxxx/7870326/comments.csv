,Casserole1,2012-12-01T22:29Z,Does someone know if a PAL version exists for the 10th gen ? Or how can we convert the NTSC wad to a PAL wad ? Thanks ;)

@bottleneck70
Since you asked nicely, I'll probably upload a torrent in a couple days with the tools required to update the wads.

@Casserole1
A PAL version does most likely exist. I'll look around for you, and if I can't find anything then I will just download the PAL RB3 game and update the PAL wads myself."
