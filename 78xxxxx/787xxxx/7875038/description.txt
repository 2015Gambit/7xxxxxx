George Clarke's Amazing Spaces 
George Clarke explores the extraordinary world of small builds, where people turn tiny spaces into the most incredible places to live, work and play. He even tries making one of his own. For many the dream of having a bolt hole or a place to escape from their hectic lives can seem unobtainable. Architect George Clarke shows how such big dreams can be achieved in small and affordable places. George meets the creative people who are making homes out of shipping containers, horseboxes and old buses. Others are building tiny huts or incredible treehouses in the middle of the woods. George also undertakes a small-build property project of his own, buying a dilapidated caravan for just ┬ú300, with the aim of transforming it into a stunning second home for his growing family.




6)  Barge, Container and Caravan 
George visits a canal boat that's been revamped as the ultimate bachelor pad as he prepares to unveil his deluxe family caravan. Having bought a 1970s caravan for just ┬ú300, George and his team have spent months turning it into an extraordinary holiday home for him and his family, including a bespoke kitchen, a wood burning stove, innovative bedrooms as well as a beautiful deck that will enable him and his family to take in the most breathtaking views. And George meets a man whose simple plan of converting a shipping container into a garden office proved anything but.
