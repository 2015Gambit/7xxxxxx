The final five dancers must be very flexible this week as they try to master dance styles from around the world. One dancer starts some drama that quickly goes global after she tells her mother she overheard other dancers saying she wished she had been eliminated. Another dancer struggles to connect with the history of the people that inspired her routine. And, the bottom two dancers must undergo a flexibility test to stay in the competition, but will they be able to bend without breaking?


This show was being capped by someone else and provided to me.For some reason they have just stopped capping it or they're running REALLY late. Nevertheless, I ripped this from iTunes for you as hate to start uploading something and not finish it.
