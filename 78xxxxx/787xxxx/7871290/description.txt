 A well-heeled family from tony neighborhood of  
 New Delhi travels from the city through dusty   
 roads that lead into the village in Haryana,    
 far out and buried in the debris of the past.   
 Shreya, the tomboy of the family, finally       
 arrives at her father's village for the first   
 time during her vacations, that too after       
 coaxing her father, Dev, to the best of her     
 abilities. She and her brother, Sam, had,       
 in their imagination, spun the village right    
 out of a fairytale, replete with streams,       
 lakes and grasslands that will allow them to    
 run free. But all they find are dusty alleys,   
 dried up ponds and hostile playmates until      
 they spin their magic and befriend this         
 unknown place, especially some of its people,   
 like the Pehelwan and the gang of kids led      
 by Ajithe. The story revolves around Shreya     
 and Sam's adventures and misadventures which    
 turn this dull place bereft of water into       
 a land of enchantment...
