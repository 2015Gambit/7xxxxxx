When JJ died in 2001 I spent most of the day listening to his recordings and

burned "the cookers" onto this CDR along with any others that grabbed me and

would still fit onto a single 74 minute long strategy CDR.  After 11 years I

need to reburn it before the last tracks start to "rot."  Cheap media can fail 

much sooner.



I was too lazy to type in all the titles....double click twice to view them in

the included track list photo...lots of luck with the visibility of the image



use included .m3u to cue BURRRN



"suspicious position" at the end of the CDR is not a sonic problem


Most of these are Columbias from a terrific MOSAIC set 1956-1961

#5,11,14 are Blue Notes 1954-1955

#13 is an old Savoy from 1949 (notice the difference in sound quality)
