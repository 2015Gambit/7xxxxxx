,Dipper926,2012-12-01T06:00Z,"This Torrent is fake, the game works and plays, it is the full game, yes, but it does not have online play, and is the regular game.

It is falsely advertised.

If you are DLing this to play online, this is not it.
If you are DLing this to play singleplayer, it's not a bad torrent.

I own minecraft, but a friend was wanting this set up, so he could join me on a public server, and it alerts you when trying to join that this, is not premium.

By premium, it means your username is not flagged in the Mojang database as having PAID for the game.

It has nothing to do with how the torrent is made."
