The old-time strongmen built tremendous strength and power and much of it was the result of heavy dumbbell exercises.

Not the type of movements you see guys doing in gyms today, but serious pulling and pushing movements with extremely heavy weights. And that's what you'll see in this exciting 1 hour and 40 minute DVD.

The DVD features a complete heavy-iron dumbbell workout performed in the original Dinosaur Dungeon. You'll learn how to do the old-time lifts; and you'll see some impressive lifting. There's chalk flying, sweat dripping and heavy dumbbells blasting off the floor like rockets.

Now, please note, this DVD was filmed 12 years ago on VHS, using old technology for filming and editing, and has been transferred to DVD. It's very rough.

The information is top-notch, but the DVD is a compilation of legitimate, raw footage from the Dinosaur Dungeon.
