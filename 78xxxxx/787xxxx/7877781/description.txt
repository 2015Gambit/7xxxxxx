Compliments to the orignal uploader.

I noticed TPB lacked a Vic Chesnutt discography, so here it is, for all fans of real music. Also includes Sweet Relief 2, the Vic Chesnutt tribute album, featuring REM, Smashing Pumpkins, Madonna, Indigo Girls, Hootie and the Blowfish, and others.

All files are mp3, 320 kbps.

Please help seed as long as you can, as I am dealing with a throttled connection. Please download the whole file, not just individual songs or albums. Cheers!
