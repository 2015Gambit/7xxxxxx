George Clarke's Amazing Spaces 
George Clarke explores the extraordinary world of small builds, where people turn tiny spaces into the most incredible places to live, work and play. He even tries making one of his own. For many the dream of having a bolt hole or a place to escape from their hectic lives can seem unobtainable. Architect George Clarke shows how such big dreams can be achieved in small and affordable places. George meets the creative people who are making homes out of shipping containers, horseboxes and old buses. Others are building tiny huts or incredible treehouses in the middle of the woods. George also undertakes a small-build property project of his own, buying a dilapidated caravan for just Â£300, with the aim of transforming it into a stunning second home for his growing family.


2)  Bolthole, Shipping Containers, Caravan 
George meets a teacher creating a bolt-hole in the Lake District by following an increasingly popular trend in the UK of buying his own plot of countryside and doing the building himself. George visits a community in Hackney who live and work in customized shipping containers and is astounded to find an architect who has moved his kitchen onto the roof of his house. In Oxford, Bernard Fontannaz has lifted a 1971 airstream caravan into his back garden to create the ultimate party palace - and it doesn't break any planning laws. And on his own project, George bids farewell to the nostalgia of his caravan's 70s interior and takes the plunge with a risky but ingenious way of creating extra space for the family.
