Metallurgical Engineering is the science and technology of producing, processing and giving proper shape to metals and alloys and other Engineering Materials having desired properties through economically viable process. Metallurgical Engineering has played a crucial role in the development of human civilization beginning with bronze-age some 3000 years ago when tools and weapons were mostly produced from the metals and alloys. This science has matured over millennia and still plays crucial role by supplying materials having suitable properties.
