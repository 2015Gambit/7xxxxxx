  The final days of a once mighty empire have come at last.  The rotting dead
  rise from their earthbound sanctuary and like a plague upon humanity, spread
  death and destruction across the land.  Armed only with powerful magic, you
  must take on the role of the young mage Artemian on a quest for truth and a
  ruthless battle for survival.

  * Wield powerful magic - Wipe out entire armies or a single foe with potent
    spells.

  * Quest for truth and knowledge - Discover the malevolent forces behind the
    evil uprising before civilization crumbles.

  * Align yourself with influential heroes - Every action and outcome can 
    change a character's or a town's loyalties.

  * Survive countless deadly confrontations - Evil forces are constantly at 
    work to make the journey long and dangerous.

  The fate of an empire falls on your shoulders ..

  GAME NOTES:
  ~~~~~~~~~~

  This is a nice turn-based, fantasy/RPG oriented strategy game in the best
  traditions of Heroes of Might & Magic and Age of Wonders.  Looks like more
  fun than a barrel full of monkeys if this sort of game is your bag!
