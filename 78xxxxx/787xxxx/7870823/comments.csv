BTW I would love to see you release a FAQ/How To with Tips & Tricks on the best methods of video conversion/ripping resulting in high quality and a small file size. You could release it as a small document. I know I would gladly give a donation for your time and knowledge. A dollar is easy donation amount that most anyone would do, I know I would! Thanx again!"
