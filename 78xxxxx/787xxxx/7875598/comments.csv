in our country we dont have quality education in most of the schools and colleges.    these videos are really like a boon to the students here. i recommend all my classmates and everyone to download these videos. ttc covers a large variety of topics which are useful for everyone.
 !!! Thank You Very Very Very Very Very Much !!!!


iam madly in need of organic chemistry complete course lectures as iam preparing for a entrance exam.but these videos are not provided by math tutor dvd and ttc. 

after searching for it in google i found that http://chemistryprofessor.com has organic chemistry lectures.

i'll be glad if you upload organic chemistry lectures not necessarily from http://chemistryprofessor.com but from any other source.
iam waiting for your reply."
