,MIGUELbM,2012-12-01T05:09Z,"@Maherz or @Heartofthorns: My windows is all fucked up after a messed SP1 update and I want to fix it, Can I use this as a Windows recovery tool in a USB?"
,Heartofthorns,2012-12-01T16:12Z,"@ MIGUELbM
I dunno about the details of it, but when I tried it on a Virtual Machine, I do get a ""Repair"" option and can repair it. So I think you should be able to do it after installing it on the USB.
I hope you do know how to install on USB. If not, check this link http://wintoflash.com/home/en/  There is a video tutorial on that page which shows you how to do it using WinToFlash."

After you install Windows 7 and activate it using Daz loader, go to Windows Update. Click on ""Check for Updates"". (Make sure you are connected to the internet to download it). Then in Optional Updates, you can select the Pt Br (Portuguese-Brazil) language. Download that and you you're done.
