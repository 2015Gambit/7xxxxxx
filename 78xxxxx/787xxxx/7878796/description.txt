ReCycle is a creative tool that helps you make the most of your grooves. In
simple terms, ReCycle lets you do with sampled loops what you can do with beats
programmed from individual drum sounds – like alter the tempo, or replace sounds
and process them individually. A tool for quickly editing sampled parts,
chopping up riffs, remixing and doing mash ups.

How is it done? ReCycle will analyze your groove and break it up into its
rhythmic components. You are now in complete control and free to change the
tempo or the pitch, without one affecting the other. And that's just scratching
the surface.

Then what? Load the resulting REX2 file into your audio sequencer or software
sampler and you can be the master of your grooves, once and for all.




System Requirements

To take full advantage of the program, you need an application that reads REX2
files (such as Propellerhead Reason), a SoundFont compatible application, an
AKAI sampler that supports .AKP files, Digidesign SampleCell, or a program that
reads Mixman TRK files.
