,ionfx6502,2012-12-02T23:01Z,"Hey guys, we found a possible fix for some laptops with lag. We pinned it to the Miasmata page on the Steam forums. Miasmata doesn't seem to be triggering the discrete GPU, so the game ends up running on the integrated Intel chip.

We're working on a performance update to further improve things. Not ready yet though. Cheers."
,ionfx6502,2012-12-02T23:03Z,"To clarify. If you go to your display driver settings, make sure to force Miasmata.exe to use the discreet chip instead of the integrated one."
