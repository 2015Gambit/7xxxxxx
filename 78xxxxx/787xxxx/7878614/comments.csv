[T],spevman,2012-12-02T20:13Z,I upload the episodes as soon as I get them.  sometimes my source for the episodes doesn't show up online for days after they air.  This week's (S09E11) thankfully showed up Saturday afternoon.  I'd suggest you stop bitching and be grateful I'm uploading the episodes at all.
