,michaelrwatson,2012-12-01T08:30Z,"""Cox on demand"". Wow. Someone has cox up their arses. When will Hollywood figure out that releasing movies like that is pretty stupid. I hope Cox is paying millions to Hollywood for this."

,dubblue4,2012-12-01T13:24Z,"thanks for all your ups, man. only just found out there's a plus and minus button, otherwise i would have hit it every time. "
,ButchCoolidge666,2012-12-01T14:24Z,"""oh, a whole hour to download!"" some people are so ungrateful... this movie is not even in theaters yet, and you can watch it for free... show some appreciation, you spoiled brats... ""and the quality better be good also..."" where do you get the nerve to demand anything?! did you contribute in any way, you miserable piece of shit!"
,Nestea_Zen,2012-12-01T19:08Z,Same as DQ1's release. Becomes out of synch eventually and it seems as if it's losing frames. Encode quality is good but choppy playback. 
,yaface,2012-12-02T04:21Z,Only took 9min for me :) Just be happy you get it for free and an hour really isn't that long eh.
,byronbay,2012-12-02T14:02Z,"I can also confirm that after about 45 minutes the audio gets a bit ahead, about 0.30 of a second for those who know how to adjust it.. Also gets a bit choppy in some scenes from around the same time but nevertheless if you know how to adjust the audio offset it's a very good download! Thanks scene4all"
,Vz-58,2012-12-02T17:44Z,"ok, boys and girls! rate? A/V??????"
,byronbay,2012-12-03T01:22Z,"A = 6 - Good Audio, just loses Sync
V = 7
M = 8"
