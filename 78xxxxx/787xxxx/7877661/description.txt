This book is for all those people who are willing to have an open yet discerning mind about complementary medicine. It is also dedicated, with thanks, to all my complementary medicine teachers, patients, students, and colleagues. Yes, we need to explore and research complementary therapies so that we can be confident about their safety and effectiveness. Yet at the same time we should not allow barriers to be erected that may obstruct new learning and deny access to therapies that could provide a powerful healing force in our world.
