Superman meets the awesome might of the hulking "Rampage". Kitty Faulkner was a scientist appointed by the Daily Planet to be at an experimental environmental machine. However things went wrong and Kitty would be part of an accidental explosion. Transformed into a massive, solar-powered, super-strong, orange skinned behemoth, Rampage was born. It took all of the man of steels might to fight her off and revert her to Kitty.
