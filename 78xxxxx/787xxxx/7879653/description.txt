
Fantasy Island (1977ΓÇô1984)Season 2 Incomplete 

Fantasy Island is a resort, where there is very little that the host, Mr. Roarke cannot provide. Thus we have visitors have adventures in fantasies that should be impossible, but this island can accommodate them such as visits to any time period they want, meet absolutely anyone they see to do something they request such as getting William Shakespeare to write a play for them. The only constant (until the final season) was at the sight of the incoming visitors, the Mr. Roarke's midget assistant runs up to the bell tower to ring the bell and shout "De plane!, De plane!"
