Overview:

In a city teeming with life, who has time for the dead?

Meet Rosangela Blackwell, an embittered writer who just found out that she is a medium and that itΓÇÖs her mission, whether she likes it or not, to assist tormented spirits and investigate other supernatural goings-on. She is assisted by the sardonic Joey Mallone, a ghost from the 1930s.

In the Blackwell Legacy, you are introduced to Rosangela as she meets Joey Mallone for the first time and is called upon to investigate a series of mysterious suicides at a local university. An enigmatic killer and a string of seemingly unconnected accidents set the background for Blackwell Unbound. Blackwell Convergence will have you investigating a film premiere that hides a bloody past and--last but not least!--in Blackwell Deception youΓÇÖll investigate why the customers of various street psychics seem to die under very mysterious circumstances.

New York, the city that never sleeps, is waiting for you to solve 4 gripping mysteries before itΓÇÖs too late!
