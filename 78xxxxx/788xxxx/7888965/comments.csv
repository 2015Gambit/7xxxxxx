I was checking back to see if you've been able to upload ""America Again: Re-becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't by Stephen Colbert"" And if possible his older book ""I am America (and so can you)"" There is a version of that one on piratebay but half way through the book the pages are all messed up and it is unreadable. Anyways... Thank you again for the uploads. "
