Comments: 
The events in this movie takes place around the same time that the events 
in The Bourne Ultimatum. When a British reporter was writing an expose about 
Black Ops operations Treadstone and Black Briar, and the ones responsible 
for them are concerned. And when Jason Bourne, former Treadstone operative 
got the file on Treadstone and Black Briar and gave it to Pamela Landy who 
them passed it to the media. When the men behind Treadstone and Black Briar 
learn of this, they're concerned how this will affects other ops they have.
