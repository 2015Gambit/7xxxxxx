Ever wonder what would happen if you removed all of the comic relief, one liners, and feel good moments from Independence Day? Well wonder no more! This edit is the husk that remains when all of the cheese and syrup has been removed, and as you can see, it is quite a different film. No footage has been added; it has only been cut.

This is intended strictly as a lighthearted parody created by a fan of the original film.
