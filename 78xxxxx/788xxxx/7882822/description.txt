SUMMARY:


Three twisted tales of abuse, drugs, displaced personalities and insect life 

by Scottish writer Irving Welsh. 


STORYLINE:


Three twisted tales from the seamy side of Scotland and the mind of Irvine Welsh.

The Granton Star Cause: in the same day a young Leith lad is dumped by his

football team, his girlfriend and his parents, arrested and beaten up by the

police and turned into a fly by God, whom he meets in a pub. The Soft Touch: a man 

is too soft to do anything when his wife moves in with the thug upstairs. The Acid 

House: while tripping on acid, Coco Bryce is struck by lightning, causing him to 

switch bodies with a newborn baby. 
       

++ I converted this movie from 4:3 format. I use Media Player Classic (as part 

of the K-lite codec pack), but other players such as VLC all have the option 

to play as 16:9 to fill the screen without black borders.++


Enjoy as always!
