Synopsis:
Khamoshi is a 1969 black-and-white Hindi film directed by Asit Sen, starring Rajesh Khanna and Waheeda Rehman. It especially remembered for its songs with haunting music by Hemant Kumar and some haunting lyrics by Gulzar. Though what really made this film stand out was the B &W cinematography by Kamal Bose, who won the Filmfare Award for its work. The film is considered Waheeda Rehman's finest acting feat, as she carries the entire film through her powerful yet understated acting, she received a Filmfare nomination for it.
The film was shot in Calcutta. The film is based on Bengali short story titled, 'Nurse Mitra' by noted Bengali writer, Ashutosh Mukherjee,and is an almost frame by frame remake of director Asit Sen's own Bengali film, Deep Jwele Jaai (1959) starring Suchitra Sen.
A Hollywood remake of the film, Silence, has been planned. It will be directed by Sanjay Patel and is rumoured to star Jennifer Aniston in the lead role.

Next Arun Choudury (Rajesh Khanna), a writer and poet enters as a patient, suffering acute mania after being rejected by his lover, Sulekha. After refusing to take his care, Radha relents and starts nursing him. In between while caring for Arun she reminisces her past and tells a story of how she took care of injured brave army soldiers when she was posted in Laddakh during the Sino-Indian war of 1962.
