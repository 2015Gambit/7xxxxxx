,studog123,2012-12-05T00:46Z,Thanks for this once again. Any chance for a Bob Carlisle discography?
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-12-05T16:28Z,"Phibz408, I don't yet have that Christ For The Nations album.  But when I find it, I'll be sure to tuck it into one of these remaining 2012 bundles for you."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-12-05T16:29Z,"Studog123. Bob Carlisle? Good choice! I just put together half a dozen discographies today that will eat up most of my bandwidth.  But let me work on that one for you, and torrent it soon."
,javah,2012-12-06T10:52Z,"Thanks again TT. Don't know if you know them. But check out ""For Today"". Also a really cool Christian Band."
,Shonrisse,2012-12-07T09:20Z,Thanks for this! Do you have anything from Ricky Dillard's and/or Rev. Timothy Wright's Discography? That would be a wonderful drop. Thanks again!
