5 (Murder by Numbers) is a FREE digital album by American rapper 50 Cent. The album was set to be his fifth studio album, a follow up to his 2009 studio album, Before I Self Destruct. Due to tension with Interscope Records, 50 Cent instead decided to make 5 (Murder by Numbers) a separate, digital-release-only album, and instead release a new collection of material as his fifth studio album, titled Street King Immortal.
