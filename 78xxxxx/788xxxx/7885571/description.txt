Young chess players (and occasionally their coaches, too) often make the mistake of concentrating all their efforts on openings. However, no progress can be made without a thorough knowledge of endgames, as an opening might immediately lead to an end; and no middlegame problems can be properly solved without keeping the endgame in mind. Mistakes in openings or middlegames may, perhaps, be corrected later, but those in the last stage can be fatal.
In the present book, 4560 positions are divided into 171 chapters. The first ones give several hundred examples to illustrate the most important elementary and theoretical positions. The following 169 chapters concentrate on various strategic and tactical ideas and structures, each demonstrated by 24 positions.
The first 300 problems in this book are akin to basic endgames in a modest book.  The problems gain in difficulty - should you finish the book your endgame ability will be at International Master level.John Nunn's books or endgame CDs then may take you to Grandmaster level - but those are to difficult for most players. Laszlo's comprehensive books show his devotion to chess and its' teaching.
Laszlo is the father of the famous Polgar sisters - Zsuzsa, Sofia & Judith.
