Cheers LegendET (+1)
Must Say It Sounds Like Something Worth A Watch, Kidnapped Christians In A Rural Area. As For IMDB's Reviews Though, Well I'll Let You Make Your Own Mind Up.
Will Post A Personal Like Or Dislike OF The Film Once I've Watched. Thanks Again."
,dubblue4,2012-12-04T18:43Z,thanks
,room237,2012-12-04T19:01Z,"Yea this is one of those that is going to fly way under the radar. Somebody posted a love letter on IMDB, and they are showing the full free movie there anyway. It is probably the edited version though. I should really be working, but there are just so many crappy movies I am behind on watching. "
,TWEETY2455,2012-12-04T21:52Z,if u download this movie and actually watch it consider urself a fucking retard.
,fjpinho,2012-12-05T18:04Z,"WTF! Why can't people just comment about A/V quality?
"
,patisallano,2012-12-06T00:06Z,Hmmm if this promises dead Christians - I donÂ´t want to miss out on it no matter how bad it might be...
