American Dad! - Season 8 - Episode 5 (WEB-DL - 720p)
----------------------------------------------------

In the upcoming eighth season, the Smiths are back with more mischief and mayhem.
Roger recruits Hayley as the lounge singer for the new high-class bar he's
installing in the attic, and Stan and Roger have an entrepreneurial "eureka"
moment when they think of the worldΓÇÖs next game-changing business opportunity.
This screwball family full of radically different personalities is just trying
to figure out how to love and trust one another in a bi-partisan world. And with
a guy like Stan in charge of national security, itΓÇÖs guaranteed to be one whacky ride.

Produced by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television.

Stan decides that Snot isn't cool enough to be Steve's best friend. So he attempts
to separate them by staging a shooting at an ice cream parlor, of which Snot is the
only witness and is then placed in the CIA Witness Protection program. Meanwhile,
Roger hires Jeff to clean his attic for extra cash, but keeps robbing him every
time he goes back downstairs.
