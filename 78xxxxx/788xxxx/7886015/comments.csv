,OnionRex,2012-12-04T11:53Z,Thank you man for your continuous work and quality uploads.
,hardm2001,2012-12-04T12:34Z,"Thanks for your good work man!

One question, do you have any releases that are bootble? I tried http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7863097/Windows_8_AIO_x86_Volume_Channel_Nov26_2012 but that did't seem to work

Thanks in advance!"

These ISO's are bootable. If you burning to a DVD try burning at the slowest speed setting or you might have errors.

It would be better to use the Windows 7 USB/DVD Tool to convert the ISO to a bootable thumb drive. Don't let the name fool you; works with Windows 8 too."
,Tiga1234,2012-12-04T19:00Z,"when you install this, don't update it because microsoft collects information on the computer when you use windows update so microsoft will know this is a pirated copy of windows. "
,OnionRex,2012-12-04T20:50Z,"Tiga1234

That is bad advice. Windows Updates fortifies the O.S. with security patches and provides fixes and optimizations.

This is activated with a key from Microsoft. If you want to be irrationally paranoid then YOU don't use updates; don't give other people bad information."
,21szpak,2012-12-04T22:58Z,murphy78  Can I please a Polish/Poland version of this Windows 8 Pro WMC x64 Retail Channel Free Mode 
,murphy78,2012-12-04T23:45Z,"tiga no worries bud.  the RTM uses the same identifier on all systems.  They wouldn't be able to tell the difference between you and anyone who recently bought a windows 8 system with win8 included.  Also, if you are really worried about kb files messing up your legit activations, you can relax.  With the end of their promotion coming Jan13 and the banning of non-used keys on Feb1, they won't bother fixing this loophole, because it fixes itself in a month and a half.

Technically at that point you could still pay the 70 bucks or whatever to use an upgrade key instead of 200 for normal pro, but no pirate is gonna pay for windows.  I'm sure that by the time this offer dies, someone will have either a good kms emulator for self activation, or at least a good working frontend for pro like scypt had.  I don't think scypt's guy that programmed it, realized that only windows versions capable of volume channel like pro, pro n, enterprise, and enterprise n can use kms server activation.

Someone will figure something out, and when they do, I'll be on it."

Thanks for the good work murphy keep it comin' Also about the boot loader has anyone attempted to get ahold of DAZ I know he writes loaders for Windows 7 so maybe he'll make them for windows 8 at the end of this current phase?"
,hardm2001,2012-12-05T09:49Z,"@OnionRex
Thanks man!
It seems the old crappy computer I try to install, has severe problems reading my internal and external DVD
So looks I just have to retire the old crap"
,coldrule,2012-12-05T18:30Z,"Thanks for torrent,but was wondering.Will you always be able to install windows 8 wmc,with this iso and m$$ key.Or you should make backup image.Thanks again"
,murphy78,2012-12-06T05:02Z,"They could technically make an update that deletes the data and token and downgrades the OS back to pro and starts the activation process over, but it's extremely unlikely as this promotion is already going to end in the middle of January.  The loophole fixes itself.  Can you imagine how many legit customers they'd piss off if they downgraded everyone's OS without their permission?  They cannot simply delete the data.dat and token.dat because without the data.dat from the activated win8pro, you cannot activate win8prowmc.  It's a bit complicated, but basically; no, they are never going to patch this."
,feifeilai,2012-12-06T07:57Z,"anyone got their key yet?? 
I still dont have it... "
,coldrule,2012-12-06T19:17Z,murphy78 thanks for info could not get solid answer on that one
,VvBlack,2012-12-06T21:51Z,"Thanks so much for the upload!

Unfortunately, I'm not as computer literate as I thought I was... 
After I mount the image, and attempt to run the installation setup, I get a setup error:
""Use the other installation disc that says 64-bit. When you insert it, Windows Setup will restart automatically.""

I don't even... 
what am I doing wrong?"
,murphy78,2012-12-07T00:16Z,you cannot upgrade an x64 system to an x86 version of windows 8.  click my name and get the x64 version and you'll be fine.
,VvBlack,2012-12-07T01:16Z,"yeah.
