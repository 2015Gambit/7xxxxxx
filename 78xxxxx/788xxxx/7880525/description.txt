NOTE:

LAST YEAR I POSTED THESE EPISODES SEPARATELY. BUT BECAUSE
I HAD SOME TROUBLE ENCODING THEM, I DID THE BEST I COULD.
THEY ARE COMPLETELY WATCHABLE BUT NOT AS GOOD AS I'D WANTED.

THIS FILE IS FROM THE SAME DVD BUT RIPPED AND ENCODED AS
A SINGLE FILE WITH BOTH EPISODES.

THE QUALITY IS MUCH BETTER IF ANYONE WISHES TO REPLACE
LAST YEAR'S FILES WITH THIS ONE. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT
IT'S MUCH BETTER QUALITY THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO SEPARATE
FILES.
