Adobe Photoshop - Advanced Cartoon/Manga Techniques
PDF
Simplified Chinese
In Color

This book is uploaded with the intent of sharing the techniques of drawing realistic Asian human beings. Some of the topics include the drawing techniques of the past (from 1980's to 2000's), drawing human-esque figures (such as the one you see in the cover of this book).

The quality isn't as perfect as you normally see when viewing other PDF, mainly due to the lack of quality equipment used when scanning this book in China. We risk getting caught by the police when we are doing this.

This book is rare due to the fact that very few ebooks ventured into this area of expertise, when it comes to drawing photorealistic cartoon characters. You can understand how to draw in the minds of Asian artists just by viewing the images. You don't have to read the text, word to word.

Enjoy. Again, sorry for the lack of quality. I just wanted others to see a different technique used locally here in China.
