Why use these discourteous, lacking info seeders.  
Boycott tvtem"
,suiteo,2012-12-05T04:34Z,Plot? IMDB Link??? Without either of these two items (not to mention the technical specs of the video itself) it's a complete waste of time.  If you can't be bothered to be informative then I just can't be bothered with any of your downloads.
