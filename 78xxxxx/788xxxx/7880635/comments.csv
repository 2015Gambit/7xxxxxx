,lisapower,2012-12-03T03:15Z,"i confirm, banned temporary by Ubisoft! what now?"
,xkaotic,2012-12-03T09:01Z,"thise works out great for me,i didnt get banned or anything....there is only one problem though,it changes the language to dutch so you cant understand anything,idk why i cant change it to english,lol someone please if you found a way to change from dutch to english please leave a comment...

all you have to do is put all the files in the main far cry 3 folder"
,xkaotic,2012-12-03T09:02Z,"also so far i have somehow found my way to multiplayer tab but its all written in dutch,and so far ive only played one game,but im not playing another til i change the language cuz it gets annoying having to guess where to go"
,Phil2003,2012-12-03T12:30Z,No wonder if you apply the regfix for the 1.01 update. Just edit it to your language.
,N3xS,2012-12-03T12:52Z,"@xkaotic
1 -open the file ""FC3_Registry.reg"" with notepad.
2 - In the line """"Language""=""Dutch"" "", replace ""Dutch"" with ""English"".
3 - Save and execute the ""FC3_Registry.reg"" file. Your game should be in English then :)"
,N3xS,2012-12-03T13:00Z,Does anyone have a solution for the saves please? To make them work with uplay..
[T],3R01,2012-12-03T13:42Z,"@xkaotic Try language selector here:

,lostprophet57,2012-12-03T22:08Z,"I will download this once the game is released, and i'll report back. To anyone who has been banned: My guess would be that since the game hasn't been released yet, if Ubisoft sees you online, well, they are gonna ban you!"
,xkaotic,2012-12-04T00:26Z,"everyone i have tried the language selector,i have tried opening the reg file and changing to english,idk wat else to do,this is really annoying me-___-
