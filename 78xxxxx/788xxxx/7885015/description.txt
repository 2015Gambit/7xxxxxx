AN ANGRY WIFE WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT HER HUSBAND SPENDING ALL HIS FREE TIME IN THE 

BAR, SO ONE NIGHT HE TOOK HER ALONG WITH HIM.


"WHAT WILL YOU HAVE ?" HE ASKED. "OH, I DON'T KNOW. THE SAME AS YOU I SUPPOSE", 

SHE REPLIED. SO THE HUSBAND ORDERED A COUPLE OF JACK DANIEL'S AND THREW HIS DOWN 

IN ONE SHOT. HIS WIFE WATCHED HIM, AND TOOK A SIP FROM HER GLASS AND IMMEDIATELY 

SPAT IT OUT.
