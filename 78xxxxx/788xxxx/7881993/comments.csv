Lol. I think people know by now that nothing I post is ""fake."" :)"

Um... okay then. Interesting screenshots you got there? I guess..."
,tdk112,2012-12-03T12:54Z,"Sorry to bother you here, but should we expect a Dexter S07E10 1080i release today? Or should we stick to some 720p version? I'd really like to watch it in 1080i. I hope I can count on you."

You can expect Dexter sometime later tonight. Had an error during the initial cap. You can keep up-to-date on my releases by visiting my blog listed in the NFO file of my torrents. (Hint: Click the ""2"" next to the ""Files"" section)"
