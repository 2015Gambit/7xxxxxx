The Football League Show 01.12.2012
Manish Bhasin presents as the Championship once again takes centre stage, with clubs from League One and League Two competing in the second round of the FA Cup.

It is a week of derby football, with no love lost between the two clubs featured in the main match as Crystal Palace meet Brighton at Selhurst Park. Leicester, meanwhile, play host to Derby in an East Midlands clash, and there is an all-Yorkshire affair as Huddersfield entertain Leeds United.
