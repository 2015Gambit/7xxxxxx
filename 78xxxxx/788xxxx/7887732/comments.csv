[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-04T23:01Z,Then you know what to do. Download the one you've linked to.
,LemonJ-Lo,2012-12-04T23:38Z,"@kaiser: Of course :-)  But what is it about your PDF files?  Are you doing something to them before upping?  (Or maybe the other poster is, who knows?)"
[V],2010kaiser,2012-12-05T00:30Z,If i convert from an EPUB to a PDF it can sometimes double or triple the size of the PDF. I just haven't had the time to change the software i use when converting. I'll get it sorted ASAP.
