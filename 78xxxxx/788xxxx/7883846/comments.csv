I had pretty much given up on being able to watch the final episode.
Take care and thanks for all the work you do to share with others like myself."

Come on people, is it that hard to show a little appreciation and say thank you once in a while.
Believe it or not, these recordings and uploads do not happen by themself.  It actually requires some work on somebody part and they are doing us a favor.  Without them, most, if not all of us downloading these shows would not have any opportunity to watch them.
As such, show some manners and say thank you on occasion.
Good day to all."
