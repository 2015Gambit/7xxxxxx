Description:
2012. Six years have passed since the second accident, which eclipsed the events of April 1986. The game is set in the Chernobyl exclusion zone which turned from a place where the fate broke into a threat to all humanity. Area reveals its secrets reluctantly, through force, and a rare hero who can reach its heart and learn - what danger awaits him there? Danger, compared to marauders and enemy groupings, all monsters and anomalies, will seem a mere preparation for the meeting with something more fatal and threatening.
And yet ... Get ready, hero. Collect artefacts and trade, grope your path and rear, catch roentgens and fight - only make sure you survive! And then, perhaps, if you are persistent and lucky, you know - why all this had fallen on you.
