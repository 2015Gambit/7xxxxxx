Rubik's Cube is a 3-D twisty puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor 

and professor of architecture Ern┼æ Rubik. Originally called the "Magic Cube",

the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980

via German businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer,and 

won the German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle that year. As of 

January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide making it the 

world's top-selling puzzle game.It is widely considered to be the 

world's best-selling toy.


In a classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, 

each of one of six solid colours (traditionally white, red, blue, orange, 

green, and yellow).A pivot mechanism enables each face to turn 

independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each 

face must be returned to consisting of one colour. Similar puzzles have now 

been produced with various numbers of stickers, not all of them by Rubik.


Although the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 

1980s, many speedcubers continue to practise it and other twisty puzzles and 

compete for the fastest times. Its international governing body, the World Cube 

Association, has organised competitions and kept the official world records 

since 2003.
