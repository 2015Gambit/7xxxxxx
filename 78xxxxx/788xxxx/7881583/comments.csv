,Method320,2012-12-03T04:52Z,"Why the fuck do you guys package the episodes in a rar file? Its ONE file. No need to split it up into 25 seperate files, you're not saving much space by compressing it, and its cumbersome and annoying to have to extract it."
,durruti36,2012-12-03T04:58Z,"***Audio: 6 ch***   ?

everybody, 2 channel audio/stereo is the most popular?!

6 channel audio played through 2 channels sounds muffled."
,k4izuky,2012-12-03T05:00Z,"Thanks, I'm waiting for ;D"
,k4izuky,2012-12-03T05:03Z,WTF??? Its real torrent?
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-12-03T05:36Z,"@Method320 All scene releases are packaged that way. Sceneline doesn't unpack it, they just upload it as is."
[T],Amplified_Pumpkin,2012-12-03T05:52Z,@ Method320 - Do a little research on how torrent data transfer works and you'll actually realize that breaking up even a single file in to rars will faster and more accurately transfer files.  It's only annoying and cumbersome to you because your PC is slow and old.
,ziggyff,2012-12-03T06:17Z,"Sorry but I have to agree rar files should not be used. 1) they can be spam password files as I get far too often 2) any slight download glitch causes them not to work 3) if you have an incomplete download, they are useless but incomplete video files still can be watched"
,Method320,2012-12-03T06:24Z,"@Amplified, my pc is 2 months old, and far from slow. Also no, breaking up a file into more files won't magically make your download speed increase. You're a tool."
,ZefPrawn,2012-12-03T06:26Z,"I'm with ziggy and Method on this one. I could be watching this episode right now instead of waiting for it to finish downloading. Of course, it's just a friendly request for future uploads. It's better than nothing for sure. :)"
,Alchene,2012-12-03T06:37Z,"Actually, breaking up torrents into RAR files makes them slower... because people uncompress the RAR and then delete the original... which means they stop seeding.  If they didn't have to delete the original data then there would be more of a reason to seed... this is why torrents still packaged in RARs tend to have significantly less seeders.  This can become a problem real quick on release days when everyone is trying to get the file in a hurry."
,ZefPrawn,2012-12-03T07:09Z,"Good point, Alchene. Unless the users have plenty of hard drive space to spare, using up 2.34GB for one television episode is unappealing. Plus, I'll have spent as long unpacking this as I will have downloading it. Again, not ungrateful, just being constructive."
,Psythik,2012-12-03T07:51Z,"@durruti36: shut up, 6ch is awesome. Get a decent sound system."
,Alchene,2012-12-03T08:04Z,I just pulled the unrared copy of the same file in 40 minutes.... been downloading this one for over 3 hours and its still not done... now its getting deleted and NOT seeded.

,torgdough,2012-12-03T17:24Z,"@Amplified_Pumpkin I don't see how split files are faster than one file since they are split into pieces anyway in the torrent. But I'm not an expert.

@sceneline Thanks for providing this. There are those that appreciate this, like me. I'm all for complete scene releases.

@everyone People complain a lot about free stuff... :) Especially when there are alternative torrents here with just the mkv and usually more seeds at that. Besides, if you're using a decent media player you don't have to extract your archives. And they are not compressed, just split, so any performance issues are just pure disk i/o related. You have a point regarding streaming while downloading, but that also goes against the self-preserving features of torrent transfer (i.e. clients always go for the most rare pieces)."
[V],spastik64,2012-12-03T20:22Z,"Hahaha noobs asking why do you package uploads on RAR.

All Scene releases are packaged as their rules says. You should learn that point and respect it.

Because of they you can download and watch. Respect."
