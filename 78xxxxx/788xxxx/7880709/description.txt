INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Remember back to your wedding day.  IΓÇÖm not talking 
about just the ceremony and reception.  I want you to 
remember how you felt.  Think back to looking into the eyes 
of your intended spouse and how happy you were.  Your 
marriage was going to last forever.  You were sure of that 
much.
