,onlyHD,2012-12-04T12:44Z,yet another unique classical choice of movie. first of all thanks and i am also willing to suggest something. i can see comments about your audio but it is enough for those who are watch in computers. if you attach external 6 channel audio with 128+ kbps track then it would be total awesome sound experience for those who prefer home theatre.
