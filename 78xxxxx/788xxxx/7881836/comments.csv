[T],MP4SUX,2012-12-03T07:18Z,"Because viewers of this show like ""behind the scenes"" gossip, I thought I'd share.

At most I do half a dozen shows a night and it would be completely impossible without all the help of those who graciously donate their ""upload"" resources to my encodes.

I encode, I do an initial seed and then when there's a ton of you helping, I can go and devote my resources to the next file on the list. To be precise:

I index ""HomeLand"" until 'spillover', that magic point when a great many peers become seeds.

And then ""Dexter"" gets all my attention until it spills over ...
And then ""The Walking Dead"" is the sole source of my attention ...
Until ""Talking Dead"" (this one) comes a bit early, but since the two shows are connected, I think you don't mind the additional 40MB for a short time.
Soon will come ""666 Park Avenue"" to round out my evening. It's last because it needs to be pre-screened.

But if so many of you failed to help, I'd be stuck waiting hours or days until I could do more.

So, from the bottom of my heart, it not only boosts my ego that you like my stuff - but the dedication of all of you does not go unnoticed.

You'll never hear me say ""please seed"" "
