V/2 Video Terrible Quality ,waste of bandwidth"
[T],SCSA420,2012-12-05T20:17Z,"It is NOT out of sync here  on my 3 BluRay player's, 3 PC's, as well as my iPad 2, Samsung Galaxy SIII smartphone or on my 55 inch 1080p LG 3D LED Smart TV running the file from a USB 3.0 32 GB flash drive and the video quality looks great on my 55 inch LG 3D LED HDTV so I don't know what to tell you then. Sure is funny that I NEVER have problems here with any of my videos ever being out of sync here on my equipment which proves to me that the problem is on your end NOT mine. As a matter of fact I have sat here and watched this SOA release 2 times already since I uploaded it and there is NOTHING wrong with it."
,Ahsoka420,2012-12-05T20:25Z,Looks great and it plays great here thank you SCSA420 :D Ignore the haters on TPB they are just jealous because they aren't in your league. I've been downloading your stuff since 2005 when you were StoneCold420 and the one thing I can say is your videos always work fine unlike others who sometimes don't. To you people playing the hating game would you please just  STFU.
