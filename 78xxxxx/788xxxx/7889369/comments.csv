When 99% of the world sells apples, it should be fairly obvious why someone chooses to sell peaches.

If you're trying to convert me to ""the new way"" as lil Alex was informed by Dim, then you clearly fell into my trap as I'll use any excuse to rant on this, my favorite subject.

1) Don't really hate MP4 - just the people who've MANDATED it and have done a total crap job of it. They claim as their sole reason for the switch was QUALITY and then have decided to pretend not to notice that they are putting out literally truckloads of pixelated crap. And it continues to this very Day. Tonight's ""Go On"" is one such example as I point out in the first TPB entry of this ep for both x264 formats (MP4 & MKV).

2) My first encodes were actually x264 in an AVI container. I even used AAC audio within it for a short while. I call the process CC2AVI (go to sourceforge and check out ""MP4cam2AVI""). But I quickly found out I was disappoiinting a very lost and confused bunch of loyal viewers to whom only XVID AVI works (portable devices and such) or just like ""great"" the way it was (like me) and see no reason to try and improve on ""great"".

3) I started out just complaining, but then thought - what the heck, why not do something about it. Got myself a UseNet account and a VPN for the princely sum of about twenty bucks a month. I already had the 2Mb/s upload bandwidth and it does fairly well to suit my purposes.

4) Turns out that I'm trusted and respected for what I do - who knew? Professionals sometimes deign to weigh in on what I do and I get surprisiingly low marks. But then people go out of their way to create an account just to tell me how much they appreciate what I do. Some even thank me for my pixelation reports (I'm on a mission from God [Blues Brothers reference]).

5) It appears the I know enough to stumble across the finish line. I do what I do for my own private reasons. I think I like the riff-raff more than the professionals at last tally.

============

So, you were going to expound to me the wonders of x264? I've got some awful news for you - x265 is about to arrive and steal your thunder. You are Betamax and I'm Horse & Buggy. Everyone's got problems, it seems.

Appreciate your point. I do from time to time make ""Mini""s.

For talk shows, it's a no-brainer.

I don't know as I'd be comfortable with a drama - getting involved means not being annoyed by constant visible defects.

I did a set of Minis for ""Big Bang Theory"", may catch up with that.

The key is not to have too many wide shots - they don't ""mini"" well at all.

Any requests for a particular show (no promises)?

,neeru,2012-12-06T22:27Z,"u shud definitely shrink the talk shows. colb/ dailyshow .msd do a great job with the dramas,but at the cost of file size

colbert is a pantomime;but he provides the counter points to the arguement. spoiler alert: most of the time the counter is just avoiding facts"
