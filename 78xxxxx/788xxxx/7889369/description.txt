UnRelated and ((possibly)) Unknown Windows Tip:
.
I call it the "draw a box" method of selecting files in Windows Explorer.
.
Open Windows Explorer
Navigate to a folder with at least several files in it.
click View-Details (unless already extant).
Now position your mouse near the top of the right pane,
(to the right of the "Name" column - over a file's size will do just fine).
Now press the mouse button down and hold it.
Next move your mouse left and down and you'll see a little "box" being created.
Now move your mouse really close to the left edge of the right pane.
And then move the mouse downward and it will "select" all the filenames in it's path.
Most of the time, anyway. Sometimes a really short name just won't go blue.

p.s. - You can let go of the button now.
