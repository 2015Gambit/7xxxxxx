I just stumbled upon the old torrent of this CD I had posted over 4 years ago and noticed many downloaders are in limbo with no seeders. So here's your second chance of gettong this fantastic CD that fetches crazy prices if and when a copy becomes available. By the way the CD also includes the mini LP called Picture One. Enjoy and seed!
