Notes

"Gordon Staples combines his recording activities at the Motown Record Corporation with the role of Concertmaster of The Detroit Symphony Orchestra".
Originally issued in 1970.
Track 1 came out in 1970 as a 7"single under name "Gordon Staples & The Motown Strings".



    A damn funky record ΓÇô way more so than you might expect from the "string" in the title! The group's kind of an answer to the Soulful Strings ensemble headed by Richard Evans for Cadet/Concept in Chicago ΓÇô and like that group, it mixes up funky rhythms with some sweet large orchestrations ΓÇô in a style that's almost a precursor of blacksploitation funk to come in the 70s! Paul Riser handles arrangements ΓÇô very much in the same spirit of Evans ΓÇô and he picks up a hip Motown groove that bridges sweeping soul and gritty funk ΓÇô all played to perfection by an ensemble led by Gordon Staples, and featuring players from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra! There's lots of funky nuggets in the set ΓÇô and titles include excellent originals like "Strung Out", "Toonie", and "Sounds of the Zodiac" ΓÇô plus "The April Fools", "The Look Of Love", "Get Down", "If Your Love Were Mine", "Someday We'll Be Together", and "From A Heart That's True To Only You". ~Dusty Groove
