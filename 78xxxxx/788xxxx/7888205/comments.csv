,crwildman,2012-12-05T01:31Z,Do = *Don't*
,crwildman,2012-12-05T02:26Z,Justice.Gov is hosting this file.  Be Warned.
,e8hffff,2012-12-05T02:37Z,It's real.
,e8hffff,2012-12-05T02:46Z,@crwildman bullshit.  It's hosted at cosspiracyhub but piratebay removes their tracker when torrents are uploaded.
,e8hffff,2012-12-05T02:47Z,@crwildman bull.  It's hosted at conspiracyhub but piratebay removes their tracker when torrents are uploaded.
,crwildman,2012-12-05T03:13Z,PeerBlocker shows Justice-Gov monitoring this torrent.  Use at your own risk.
,e8hffff,2012-12-05T04:28Z,@crwildman if they are it's because they don't want people finding out about genocide.
,e8hffff,2012-12-05T04:37Z,"@crwildman Can you explain how you are associating J.gov with this torrent?  Peerguardian only say it's the torrent client at best or overall your system is using a J.gov IP, not a particular torrent.  Are you saying J.Gov are downloading the torrent?

I think you're full of it, but you get a chance to explain yourself."
,crwildman,2012-12-05T10:11Z,"@e8hffff  J.gov was trying to establish connections to my server when I accessed this torrent.  It is simple as that.  What else is there to explain?  They are the Anti-Piracy agency who report users for downloading pirated content.  Anyone who downloads this will surely get a letter from your ISP regarding piracy if you live in the US.   Download at your own risk.   I will wait for a trusted user to upload it such as extremezone , scenes4all, acesn8s... ect...  If you guys don't give a shit, go ahead and download away :)   I am just giving you guys a warning on IP 149.101.146.50 trying to connect on a unknown protocol, and this being the only active file at the time.   So hope you enjoy the movie, I wont be watching it from this source. "
,e8hffff,2012-12-06T01:54Z,"@crwildman if you're the creator of this documentary then you just need to say so and ask people to stop sharing and there's a great chance it will be removed.  Many documentary makers really want their content out to the masses, even though they do want sales too."
,crwildman,2012-12-06T02:36Z,"lol yea thats whats im going to tell them too when i get my piracy notice from trying to download this torrent haha,  Ill let u know if it works"
