My notes:

   While reading the wiki notes on Joi Lansing who was a supporting player in many films of the 50's I learned that one of the few films in which she had a featured role was Hot Cars.  I tracked it down as a DVD (it's currently available as I write this).  Nostalgia for glamour is something I've explored in my film viewing.  Many years ago Joi Lansing had a spot on a daytime situation comedy starring Bob Cummings.  I never forgot Joi Lansing.

  The wiki notes are worht persuing for this reason:  Though Joi Lansing is a bombshell with a type of beauty I have not seen since, her life was quite conservative.

  On the film itself;  it was filmed on site at a car dealership for many scenes. The nostalgia for old vehicles also plays into the view on the 1950's.
