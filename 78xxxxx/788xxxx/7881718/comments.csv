,SilenceMurderer,2012-12-03T22:58Z,"Thanks a lot for your help! I tried TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 5.0.5.32.

I'm trying to convert the AC3/DTS 5.1 to stereo AAC while keeping the video same as the source (and preferably deleting the old audio). But every program I've tried so far can only convert video+audio or makes a separate audio file.

I succeeded with converting the audio from 5.1 DTS to stereo AAC with ImTOO Video Converter Ultimate, which automatically splitted the audio from the video. But I managed to add the 2ch AAC to the video again with TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works. (However, when I try this(TMPGEnc's multiplexer) with a larger video (7GB) the program stops responding...)

I'm wondering if you know a program what can do this at once (only converting the audio to 2ch AACwithout splitting it from the video). 

This message got a bit longer then I expected, thanks a lot for your time! Ik download altijd je films, altijd goede kwaliteit! ;) "
