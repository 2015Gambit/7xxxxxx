Also, you will need to rerun this every 180 days. (Every run will reset the counter to 180 days)"

,maxsuser,2012-12-04T12:58Z,"Works like a charm, best to run on a clean install. Also would be safe to create a task schedule to run the exe once every say ..2 months just to keep activated, when PC is on idle...just my 2 cents.
Heard heldigard is retiring .... Anyways, thanks Anacondaz and all at MDL"
