FYI"
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-05T10:56Z,The CBR version works perfect in ComicRack 9.156.
,Nikoli1129,2012-12-05T13:38Z,These pages are completely out of order.
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-05T14:28Z,What pages are out of order?
,STFmaryville,2012-12-05T14:51Z,I had the same problem with the .cbr version (using CDisplayEx) but I renamed the .rar version to .cbr and it worked. Sincere thanks for sharing SerialKilla12!
