,STONEDSTONER,2012-12-03T09:28Z,"i actually havnt tried these on 360+usb, just sick of waiting for ages for XVID now

I run movies on my PC mainly, i just try get vids that work on xbox for friends, they not really into this show like me tho so it doesnt matter
"
,STONEDSTONER,2012-12-03T09:46Z,"Just tryed on 360 your vids work perfect now :)

Also tryed X264 from LegendET and that worked also

But its hit and miss alot with X264 format cause sometimes it may have a sound format xbox doesnt like and refuses to play , now you changed the sound setting it works perfect

Alot of people Run usb straight to there tv /DVD that only supports XVID, same thing they can be fussy"
