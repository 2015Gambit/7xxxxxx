Bart and Ralph are teamed together as part of a new program called Kid Cops, but when it comes down to it, which one is the good cop, and which one is the bad cop?  Then, Bart partners up with Larry H. Lawyer and sues a comic book company over truth in comic book advertising, and that's just the beginning of a civil suit that's anything but civil.
