A musical prodigy who never realized his potential, Shore found a way to outsmart society - by getting away with murder. And he wanted the whole world to know it. After brutally killing a 16-year-old girl, he called the local NBC affiliate and told an editor precisely where to find the body.Eight years passed before DNA evidence caught up with Shore.
