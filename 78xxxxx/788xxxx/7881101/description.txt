 Even if your homeΓÇÖs decor hasnΓÇÖt changed since 1976, you can refresh, revamp, and revitalize it at the holidays with just a few simple strokes. Unlike regular decorating ΓÇô where you agonize over paint colors, upholstery choices, and furniture styles ΓÇô holiday decorating is easy. Holidays provide a set theme; a color palette; and merchandise and motifs that are usually mass-manufactured, so you can purchase and decorate when youΓÇÖre ready.

You may be feeling intimidated about decorating for the holidays, or you may be ready to dive right in. No matter what level of decorator you may be, Holiday Decorating For Dummies shows you tricks that you may not already know. This guide is for you if:
You need easy, affordable ideas to fill your house with holiday cheer
You have no idea where to start and just need some ideas to get you going.
You already have a huge collection of your own holiday stash and need to get organized before acquiring more
You love to celebrate very special occasions: an anniversary, a special birthday, a warm welcome home

A flair for decorating isnΓÇÖt necessarily inherited. Armed with clear explanations of how you can achieve beautiful yet practical holiday decorating, planning tips and tricks, crafting basics, care and cleaning tips, storage solutions, and more, you can decorate like a pro. Holiday Decorating For Dummies helps you gain that skill with topics such as:
