,RafVne2,2012-12-04T18:23Z,Oh... I have only 56-60kb upload speed.(what can I say I'm not a rich man) So seed the thing if you think someone else might like it
,RafVne2,2012-12-04T18:36Z,"If download doesn't work, let me know... I probably fucked up somewhere and I'll try to fix it. this is my second torrent ever so I don't exactly know how it all works..."
,RafVne2,2012-12-04T18:52Z,"One more thing... You will not see a difference on ""team selection"" screen. those are a different set of textures, even some of the ""Explore"" moments are separate...

 i just happened to check out your torrent for curiosity reasons but then i started to read your description dude there is some funny shit in there anyways thanks for the laugh and the torrent"
,RafVne2,2012-12-05T02:24Z,"Thanks for the post. I'm So fucking glad that someone didn't find my desc. offensive and know that all of it is mostly just for ""giggles"".
Obviously, I've made this torrent , cauz' I was looking for some outside input, so...
YES PLEASE DO COMMENT.
I don't really give a fuck if it's a positive or a negative comment, but I do give damn if it's honest.
Few things I've noticed... I did fuck up on some things... i think... I'm not sure which version I actually uploaded but from what I see there are many fuck ups.... 
There is a first draft edit to the ""exquisite dress"". I abandoned the idea very quickly because it would involve a 3D mesh editing, which I have a very faint idea...(read:I've got no fucking clue) as you can see these textures are overlaying the dress not the body....
Secondly.... I think the version I've up'd includes Liaras ""Bad hair day"" :)
I think this one is with background prep  and low res hair which is a blur. I think this gotta be the one where I was blurring her nipples to make it look like see through nylon kind of way, and forgot to turn on a mask.
Yeah well... next time I'll try to pay more attention (and not be drunk)... got one more funny thing, but I gotta go ... I'll explain later.... :)"
