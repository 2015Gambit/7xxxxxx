Season two of 21 Jump Street finds a team of youthful LAPD officers continuing to weed out adult criminals by posing as high-school teenagers -- a sort of Mod_Squad for the 1980s. Back in harness are Johnny_Depp as Officer Tom Hanson, Peter DeLuise as Officer Doug Penhall (less chubby and comical and more "buff" and action-prone than in the series' maiden season), Holly_Robinson as Officer Judy Hoffs, and Dustin_Nguyen as Officer Harry Truman Ioki. And as before, the team takes its orders from no-nonsense police captain Adam Fuller (Steven_Williams). This year's crop of guest stars is an impressive one, including Lynne_Moody, Marcia_Rodd, former Adam-12 leading man Kent McCord (as Tom Hanson's father), and a young Brad_Pitt, cast as a popular high schooler who inexplicably commits suicide. Among the season's top episodes are the two-part "Besieged," in which the team swoops down upon a deadly crack ring and also attempts to expose a rogue cop, and "Christmas in Saigon," in which viewers learns the real name of Vietnam refugee H.T. Ioki. Season two ends on a semi-cliffhanger, as the LAPD higher-ups consider the possibility of disbanding the Jump Street team.
