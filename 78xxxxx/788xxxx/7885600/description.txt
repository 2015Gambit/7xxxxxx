Usingreal aerial photography for scenery means that the views you see from yourvirtual cockpit are literally transformed into the real thing - you see exactlywhat the pilots of the survey aircraft saw when they acquired the aerialphotography. VFR Photographic Scenery Scotland for FSX gives youunsurpassed photographic detail at a high resolution of 0.6/m pixel detail with terrain mesh at 5mwhich replaces your default scenery.
 VFR Generation X: V4 - Scotland: The Western Isles, is the first volume in a series of five ultra-high definition photographic sceneries, that will ultimately cover the whole of mainland Scotland and outlying islands.
Unparalleled Terrain detail:
 With a 5m terrain mesh data from Getmapping's latest aerial surveys, VFR Generation X gives users minute topographic detail that shows every lump and bump - all fully correlated to provide the perfect fit with the aerial photography, adding dramatically to the immersion that this synthetic environment provides.
Ultra High-Definition Photographic Scenery:
 With this volume you can expect ultra-high definition resolution for the entire area.The resolution has been set 0.60cm throughout. The end result is smooth frame rates with exacting detail for your VFR flights.
Spectacular Water Effects:
 The water bodies have been designed to retain the natural water colours shown by the aerial photography as far as possible, again adding to the scenery's immersion. In addition, they will provide a moving, reflective surface that will allow float aircraft operations, and will even let you see through to sub-surface features like sand bars and underwater channels.
