Two things about Jane: she never says no to her friends (she&#x27;s been a bridesmaid 27 times and selflessly plans friends&#x27; weddings), and she&#x27;s in love with her boss, George, nurturing dreams of a lovely, romantic wedding of her own. She meets Kevin, a cynical writer who finds her attractive, and that same week her flirtatious younger sister Tess comes to town. Jane silently watches George fall for Tess, a manipulative pretender. Worse, Jane may be called upon to plan their wedding. Meanwhile, Kevin tries to get Jane&#x27;s attention and has an idea that may advance his career. Can Jane uncork her feelings?
