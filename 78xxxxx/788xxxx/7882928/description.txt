In the wake of the highly successful Sams Teach Yourself Unix in 24 Hours, this book 
focuses on the additional Unix commands that an advanced user or beginning system 
administrator needs to know in order to administer and maintain a Unix system. 
The book includes coverage of the key Unix variations: Red Hat Linux, Solaris, 
HP-UX, and Apple's Mac OS X environment. The book will not be a comprehensive 
solution to all problems facing new system administrators, but instead is a 
tutorial introduction to the process of learning about and maintaining a 
running Unix server.
