 ΓÇ£The Bedrock Anniversary parties in London are always truly special as it feels like coming home to me. For some reason this party seemed extra special, Fire in Vauxhall is a new venue for us and it has a labyrinth of rooms under the arches which allowed us to feature a line up that most festivals would be happy with! There was definitely a magical vibe in the air when I arrived. I had heard that people had travelled from Russia, America, all over Europe, even New Zealand, to be there. The party was perfect for me, the amazing international crowd created an incredible atmosphere all night long. I love DJing more than ever these days, so to get to play for over 8 hours to an up for it crowd like that, was just pure heaven. This is the first time I have released a 4xCD live mix from one of my gigs and I hope it brings back some great memories for those who were there. If you couldnΓÇÖt make it, turn the lights down low, turn the volume up loud and I think youΓÇÖll understand. I hope you enjoy listening as much as I did playing.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô John Digweed
