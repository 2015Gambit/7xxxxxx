,szymson92,2012-12-04T19:05Z,"Gotta question. Is there ANY way to unpack this file, or do anything with it?"
,FlixCraze,2012-12-04T19:56Z,@szymson92 use Horizon or modio to resign the file to a 360 enabled flash drive and then under system settings and memory on your xbox copy from the flash drive to your Hard Drive and Unlock using xm360 if needed
