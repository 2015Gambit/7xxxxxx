Many thanks to Rabbit&Carrot - you made this possible

Charles Grodin has gotten so old I didn't recognize him - but the voice ...

Completely unrelated commentary:

Here's my NFL dilemma:

1) The stripe down the helmet of the PittsBurgh Steelers is clearly Orange.

2) Everyone seems to insits that it's yellow / gold

So, my question is - do the Steelers have a big yellow stripe down their back (cough COWARDS)?

Or is it deliberately Orange, just to keep that unfortunate conclusion from being drawn?
