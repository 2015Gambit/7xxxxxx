If i had the patiente more people will have it too."

Then the leeches-turned-seeders take over. Drop that torrent and start another. At that rate, all the torrents would be up and running in 10 days, maybe 12 or 14 because of the 30 gig ones. If everybody waits, then ya, the flood will hit in more or less the same time.
 Me, I don't got space for another hundred odd gigs so I was just gonna get the updates and I gonna have to wait for the whole kitty. All good, so long as you seed out before the apocalypse hits..."
