Make sure your game is updated to 1.08 (can download from official paradox site no drm included)
place the dlc folder with all the files in it into your install  directory overwrite where asked 
place the activator in your install directory and run it game will appear to start but will crash 
somewhere around loading family flags or something like that this is normal. now launch game through 
game launcher like normal un-click all DLC then re-click them then launch game should have all enabled
if for some reason they are not working (and you will know by bottom left corner of starting map two little icons that say which dlc activated)
run the activator a few more times and then try launching the game again..... thanks goes to others im just passing it on...
