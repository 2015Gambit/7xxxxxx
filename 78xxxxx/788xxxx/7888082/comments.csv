,husksolow,2012-12-05T13:53Z,Hmm this seems to be an old episode from an earlier series :(
,questar,2012-12-05T18:06Z,"From the BBC web site:

""Latest episode
Series 3 Episode 6
6/7 A compilation of some of the best sketches from the BAFTA award winning third series."""
,DannyBoyDannyBoy1974,2012-12-05T23:31Z,"This is confusing for several reasons, so just to clarify:

- Both the programme's own BBC web site and the Wikipedia page indicate that the current series will have 7 episodes total---from the horse's mouth and the horse's ass. LOL
- The programme's own BBC web site indicates this is the 3rd series, but encodings on the file-sharing networks indicate this is Series 4. This is because Series 1 was actually called ""Ruddy Hell, It's Harry & Paul"", with the rest of the different series simply called ""Harry & Paul"".
- As questar mentioned above, the programme's BBC web site indicates this most recent episode to have been a ""best of"" compilation. However, upon downloading and reviewing it, it is actually a compilation of sketches from previous series rather than from the current series. The year of production at the end of the credits is 2012.
- As episode 6 of 7 of the current series was a ""best of"" compilation of sketches from previous series, I would imagine that episode 7 of 7 will be a continuation of this ""best of"" compilation.

Just thought I'd pass this information on for fellow completists. They don't make it easy to collect the whole set, do they? LOL

Thanks very much to Pongydog for capping this episode, which I've not found from any other source.  ;) "
