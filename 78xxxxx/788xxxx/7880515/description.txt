Well, I'm uploading this japanese remastered version cause the american version of this movie, even though its remastered(the other Hero's legacy version uploaded here in PirateBay that says remastered)Because of this american "remasterization" the image got a little "blurry", losing LOTS of details on the scene, as you can see in this picture

My version, a Rip fron the original japanese remastered Dragon Box has a different remasterization (this one is good), one that preserves all the details of the scenes and not letting the picture blurry, as you can see in this picture.

I don't have any subtitles, so if someone has one, please upload and let the link in the comments, it'd be very helpful.
