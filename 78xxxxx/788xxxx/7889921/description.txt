Deleted Scenes explores a dysfunctional relationship between two very different men. Sean (Michael Vaccaro) is an insecure and nervous introvert with an escalating drug problem. He's also a bit of a stalker. Wolf (Ivica Kovacevic) is a European emigre who likes to hustle on the side. There's a little bit of Stanley Kowalski in this guy; he's both vulnerable and hot. Wolf is outgoing, promiscuous, and surprisingly patient with his needy new boyfriend.
