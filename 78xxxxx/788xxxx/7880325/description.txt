Book One in the Award Winning Moon Realm Series

"Tales, unlike stories, never lie. You see, a tale is an account of things in their due order, often divulged secretly, or as gossip. Would you like to hear one?" ΓÇöLord Autumn

Uncle Ebb was so good at telling his tales of the Moon Realm that sometimes it sounded like heΓÇÖd been there himself.

As children, Lily and Jasper listened raptly to his bedtime tales of a place where nine moons swirled around one another, each inhabited by strange and wondrous beings: magical lunamancers; undersea merfolk; wise birds; winged dragons; and LilyΓÇÖs favorite, the heroic, leonine Rinn.

There was only one rule: donΓÇÖt tell a soul.

But now, years later, Uncle Ebb is missing. Lily has learned the secret behind the tales, and soon Jasper will too. But thereΓÇÖs one big problem. You see, something terrible has happened in the Moon Realm. . . .
