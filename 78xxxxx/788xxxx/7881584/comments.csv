Thanks Glow :)

And to the others - THIS IS THE LAST EPISODE of the season. Unfortunately they haven't started shooting the 4th season, but they will soon. Should be released mid next year. "
,Molestat,2012-12-03T18:07Z,"I LOVE GlowGaze!
Best group ever!"
,TheCritics,2012-12-03T20:13Z, Kabuto85 You are wrong about this being the last episode of the season. Just like last year Warner is splitting the season up into 2 parts the other half will begin on Feb. 13 ---- Dont tell people shit if you dont know what the fuck you are talking about. Makes you look hahah ummm FUNNY
,FLAX_ceed,2012-12-03T20:31Z,"I'm saying this only by fact and by past experience with GlowGaze's UL's and others, GlowGaze has more complete, faster, and higher quality UL's than most other Uploaders. I rarely ever leave  comments, and when I do I never leave them for a personal opinions, but this time I'll make the exception and say that GlowGaze does have my respect and I tend to DL from GlowGaze than from most others. Thanx G.G. for all your UL's, even if they aren't your original work, thank you for only Uploading quality. "
,FLAX_ceed,2012-12-03T20:35Z,"@Kabuto85

I agree TheCritics, season 3 was supoosed to have 13 to 16 episodes. Something around that area. Look that up before you make ASSumptions like that"
,FiercestFables,2012-12-03T20:39Z,"I knew I could count on you for this. Thank you so, so much!"
