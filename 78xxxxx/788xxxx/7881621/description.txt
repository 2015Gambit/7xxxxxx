"Hypnos"

Jane is hurled back in time to October 1927 by 
the mysterious Maris Elder, who hypnotizes her 
in an effort to find out where she disappeared 
down the spiral staircase. Her time travel 
adventures unlock secrets long hidden in Peter 
Kramer's apartment, where his wife was 
murdered, and shows Jane that her family has a 
dark legacy that's tangled with The Drake's 
history. Meanwhile, Gavin talks to Henry about 
the possibility of becoming a city councilman, 
but his chances may be destroyed by the leak 
of some sensitive personal information. And in 
a shocking revelation, Sasha's identity is 
exposed.
