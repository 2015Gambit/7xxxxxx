Reprints early Steel Claw strip from Valiant, with new framing sequence by Dez Skinn and Garry Leach. The Claw gets a new codename, Talon, in the framing sequence, and lettering alterations to the reprint change his real name, Louis Crandell, to Lewis Randell. Cursitor Doom appears, as his Quality Comics version Amadeus Wolf, in the framing sequence, and the final installment's framing sequence ties the series to Dez Skinn's Big Ben strip from Warrior.
