Story Line:

Bond’s mission is to keep a computer drive that has a list of British agents from being used 
against them. He chases the man who has it and they have a brawl on top of a train. Eve, an 
agent sent to assist Bond has them in her cross hairs but hesitates to take the shot because 
she might hit Bond but M orders her to take it. She does, and hits Bond who falls into the river
 and is believed to be dead. A few months later, the British government is upset with MI6 for 
losing the list; specifically with M. She is told that she’ll be allowed to retire but she 
refuses to leave till the matter is resolved. So she returns to HQ to work on it but as she 
arrives, there’s an explosion. In the meantime, Bond, who is not dead, has been laying low. When 
he learns of what happened, he returns. And M tasks him with finding the one who has the 
information. He eventually learns that the man who has it, is someone from M’s past and who has 
it in for her.
