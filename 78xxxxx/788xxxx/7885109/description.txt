EnergiΓÇª the source of power interconnected with all living things.

In times of old, the human race erected a great civilization that thrived on the use of this power. However, some two centuries earlier, an incident known as the Energi Crisis erupted and led to the planet's energi being sealed away. As a result, people lost the mysterious powers they were once capable of harnessing.

The story now picks up with the protagonist, Leon, who has been assigned to his first solo mission by the Energi Guild. And there within his mind echo the words of the guildmistress when she stated: "Energi is the hidden power within each individual. It is the power of the heart and mind, and when purposefully sought, its true potential is unleashed."

ΓûáNostalgia at its best! ItΓÇÖs like old-school meets new-school with perfect harmony!
Sporting a colorful and gorgeously detailed 2D battle system, individual break skills, elementals that combine to create more powerful energi skills, and even an auto-battle function, Alphadia II comes equipped with everything fans of traditional JRPGs could expect and caters to both the hardcore and casual gamer alike!

ΓûáEnergi is the key!
Energi is derived from one of six unique elementals and has the power to not only grow, but lead players to the acquisition of new and more powerful energi skills. These energi skills then, in turn, play an integral role in attack, recovery, and even support. Furthermore, once two separate elementals have reached a certain level, they can be combined to create even more powerful energi skills!

ΓûáCan you handle it?!
Aside from a voluminous story, Alphadia II offers a new "Mission" system in which players are able to accept missions from the guild in order to receive valuable coins. These coins can then be exchanged for powerful equipment and other hard-to-get items later on. In addition to the main story and missions is a wealth of subquests, making this title truly the whole package. In fact, after finishing the game, there may be still much more to do than one might think!
