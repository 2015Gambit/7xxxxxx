In course folders there are many different documents, like ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDE (03812), DOCUMENT SURVEY (1095), PRODUCT REVISION INFORMATION (10921), INSTRUCTOR'S GUIDE etc...  but you should look for a document called STUDENT TEXTBOOK, a document with number 03802, which is usually the largest PDF file in the directory.

For example in the folder ""DatacomDatacom Networking - LZU 102 371 R1A"" there is a student textbook, a PDF file with number 03802, which is the largest file in the directory.

Student textbooks are usually placed in a subfolder named ""Learning_Components"" (e.g. folder ""TCP-IPVoice over IP - LZU 102 324 R1CLearning_Components 3802"" contains the largest file ""Stud_VoIP.book.pdf"" which is a Student textbook)."
