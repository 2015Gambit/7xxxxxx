     Dois irmãos, o jovem Harry (Bryce Johnson) e o adolescente Max (Cole Williams), são ídolos juvenis que se envolvem em um escândalo envolvendo incesto no conturbado passado familiar, no qual existiu uma profunda afeição entre ambos.

Harry is a 23-year-old former boy band idol who is watching his younger brother Max, 16, follow in his footsteps. Harry has detoured on his way to a Japanese concert tour to escort Max on a long-promised camping adventure. Their trip begins on a note of camaraderie but quickly turns serious as old wounds resurface, forcing them to come to terms with their dysfunctional past--Harry's drinking problems, his disconnection from the family, and, most of all, his relationship with Max and the emotional dependency that keeps them from moving into adulthood.
