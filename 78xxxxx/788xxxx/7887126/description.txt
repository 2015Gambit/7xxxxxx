By the year 2068, the Earth's ozone is gone, violent and uncontrollable storms are razing it's surface as a result. A small group of military survivors are the defenders of the last of human kind and when Captain John Garth is approached to do a job by a former brother-in-arms Lapierre, who is now employed by Reich, an eco-profiteer, in order to save his father & a few other survivors Garth agrees. He & a small group of mercenaries are to break into the near-impenetrable Vincent Estate & retrieve priceless works of "art" that were stored there before the apocalypse. But there is a deadly computer controlled defense system called "Encrypt" that they must circumvent, along with a killer robot called the Rook & the human-like holographic security chief Diana, who holds the key to Earth's total destruction---or it's complete salvation.
