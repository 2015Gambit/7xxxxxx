SAME HERE!"
,Bean-Bandit,2012-12-05T06:08Z,"Couldn't get this to work. Said it couldn't retrieve the version number.

Used the updater that's already provided in the FarCry 3/Bin/FC3Updater.exe and then used the crack."
,csgo4life,2012-12-05T07:25Z,@FlawlezzJaxy  I gotta say it's a relief to find out I'm not the only one with this stupid issue. let's see what this update can do ^^
,Dimmis80,2012-12-05T08:03Z,Hey guys.Does this update works with the @T.F.K Repack version of this game.?And can u continue with your save games.??Thanks in advance dudes.!???
,Val_Wood,2012-12-05T10:08Z,"this update does not help with the weird inability to pass through certain doors without button presses and analog stick wrangling. It's mainly a problem in the general store of the allied tribe in the first village you visit and a few narrow doors in random shacks. actually this is the only glitch i've encountered so far in my 6 hour run, which compared to most open-world games is a miracle...cough...cough...Skyrim..."
,kinroko,2012-12-05T10:19Z,"Gonna see if this can recover your already lost saves. I'm kind of doubtful that it will, but hey, you can always try, right?"

,Performer81,2012-12-05T11:56Z,why is this bigger than the torrent of ancientrome?
,Sinister181,2012-12-05T12:02Z,"Fuck's sake!! The game crashes every five minutes, even with this latest update. Turning down the graphics doesn't even make a difference."
,bafakos76,2012-12-05T12:32Z,thx S4A ur the best D
,kinroko,2012-12-05T13:08Z,"Well fuckin' hell. I don't know what to tell you guys.

I originally lost all of my saves to the evil save button. Shitty balls, right?

I continually got the ""Cannot locate bullshit installation version"", while trying to use this, but the funny thing is that doesn't seem to have mattered.

I copied over the crack anyway. WITHOUT getting the update to run successfully, ran the game via FC3.EXE and voila, for some unknown fucking inane reason, the game works fine and my previously LOST saves are back. The fuck man? The fuck?

So I say in closing, if you've lost your saves, download this, use the crack, and it should solve your problems."
,pkd2008,2012-12-05T13:29Z,do I need to update v1.01 first ?
,leodelacruzx,2012-12-05T15:29Z,Many thanks
,lyndong4,2012-12-05T16:28Z,"For those with blackBox, you need to go to regedit,

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREUbisoftFarcry 3, make sure the InstallDir is correct, Version number is correct, then go to

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall

Create a new key in this folder named {E3B9C5A9-BD7A-4B56-B754-FAEA7DD6FA88} Exactly like that. Then in the new key you created, make a new string named DisplayVersion, and set its value to whatever version of game you have.(1.00 or 1.01) That should do the trick."
,kim96,2012-12-05T18:35Z,"thank you very much i have been waiting for 1.2 update with crack =)
love you!
and those who's game crashes or who's textures arent right: that is because
1.you dont have powerfull computer enough
2.too old drivers
3.too bad graphics card
4.not enough ram
or
5.too bad prosessor
try to upgrade your drivers because it usually helps
this torrent works if you have problems it's because of your computer or drivers"
,xxela,2012-12-05T20:00Z,@lyndong4 thanks very much for the tip
,Green.Lantern,2012-12-05T22:16Z,"does anyone know if Skidrow will release a crack for this?

Also has anyone solved the black screen issue?"
,qwe_poi,2012-12-05T22:29Z,It works! Thanks!
,zongoo,2012-12-06T00:17Z,"i installed this and now all my saves are gone -______-

apart from that game has been running fine, never crashes

BUT WHERE ARE MY SAVES"
,zongoo,2012-12-06T00:20Z,"hahaaa! zongo has found a solution!

if your game saves are gone, go into the ubisoft folder [the one where you pasted the crack] and start the game by double clicking on FC3.exe

done as done :)"
,scyris99,2012-12-06T01:56Z,"One of the leading causes for game crashes is not enough memory, for example when skyrim uses all avail memory it can (2 gb or so withouit the Large address aware patch, and no the one bethesda put in doesn't work.. what else is new its bethesda). The game just insta crashes cuz bethesda was too stupid to put in a routiene that removes assets out of memory that aren't/haven't been used for a bit. Most likely far cry 3 is yet another shitty console port. No one makes games for pc's first then consoles anymore, its always the other way around due to x360's way outdated hardware."
,sp3nny,2012-12-06T03:02Z,"My saves are gone, but I don't have a FC3.exe, only farcry3.exe, that's the closest I have to FC3.exe, anyway when I start it my game save is still gone :("
,Lord-Darkstorn,2012-12-06T03:16Z,"@lyndong4

I've got the blackbox version too but didn't have to do all that. I just installed the update, moved the crack to the bin folder, and now the start screen says v1.02. Unless I'm missing something my game has been patched..."
,s1raz1,2012-12-06T04:31Z,"If u want to play it safe, the save location is C:progamdata/orbit/46/ the 2 save files there are ur FC3 save file, back up them, preferably once per session."
,wagslok2,2012-12-06T06:04Z,"dont waste your time, do not download this..."
,m4now,2012-12-06T06:06Z,applying this update resolved the issue of lost save games
,s1raz1,2012-12-06T07:22Z,"Frankly i dont know which computer folks are using that complaint about crashes, this time and age, u need minimal I5 processor and 8 gb ram so u can have win 7 working fast, video card, Nvidia 660 or 670 and ull be golden.
I havent got a single framerate drop, crash, lag, etc. A graphically game looks amazing specially when it rains. And crysis 3 gonna be like this :D"
,Slobodan_M,2012-12-06T14:55Z,"Hopefully this update fixes the bug where this is one of the stupidest games of all times and make it at least playable.
I mean - try to skin dead animal rolling down the hill (cliff), or loot an container that shows on the map, but is looted already.
Or look at the menus. No direct shortcut to inventory etc.
These people are getting dumber by the minute."
,Jakmalmo,2012-12-06T16:21Z,"The multiplayer crack ain't working for me anymore, when I launch the game it doesn't open Uplay, and it wont connect to the Far Cry 3 service..
Any fix for this?"
,m4now,2012-12-06T22:59Z,"s1raz1, not quite true, i have a Geforce 9600 GT and QuadCore. Games works fine on medium settings."
,dragon_ba,2012-12-07T15:05Z,"The update works. Why whining for lost savegames? You need a working version, just then play and achive progress in the game. 

About the game - even though my system can run it, there's too much demanding graphics and the gameplay smoothness is nowhere near e.g. modern warfare 3.  I am very glad I could try the game but I'm done testing and I will not buy this one.  IMO in a good FPS you shouldn't handle inventory and shouldn't be able to save only after a huge checkpoint periods of the game. See for yourself, the update works without any problems. "
,Calamity-TPB,2012-12-07T17:28Z,"Thank you, @scene4all."
,amit3945,2012-12-07T19:04Z,"Will this crack work if I buy the original DVD, install it, and overwrite the files from crack folder to the game dir?
There is no farcry.exe in the crack folder.Am I missing something here?"
,s1raz1,2012-12-07T20:07Z,"@Amit
 it wont work, since ur original dont need fixin
 The files need to be overwriten with the one in the place were FC3.exe is, like all those 4 .dll just copy past on the install dir.
And to the guy complaining about check point save u can save at any time of game, the only time were save is unavailable is on missions, when u relog u appear at ur nearest safe like any sandbox game.
Also am hooked, i like hunting leopards with my bow :D, curse u sharks!!!"
