All formed in suburban Los Angeles in 1987 when Milo Aukerman, the lead singer of The Descendents, left to pursue a graduate degree in biochemistry, forcing the band into a hiatus. The remaining members, guitarist Stephen Egerton, bassist Karl Alvarez, and drummer Bill Stevenson decided to carry on as a band, adopting the title of the Descendents last studio album, All, as their official moniker.

Allroys Revenge is the second album by the California pop punk band All, released in 1989 on Cruz Records. It was the first release with their second lead singer, Scott Reynolds.
