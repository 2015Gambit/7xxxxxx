one thing though the 720p isnt that much different than the normal quality one size shows that too i download the past two episodes from someone else and the file size was around 200mb and the quality was much higher and it was obvious it was HD,dwjp90 i wonder that maybe your video processing is reducing the quality too much try not to compress it too much or maybe upload a different one that's higher quality but a much larger size...thanks for the torrent though!"
