Here's the patch notes guys:

FARMS

farm plots are fully fertilized when they are built
farm plots have much higher fertilizer capacity (used to be 6, now is 10,20,30)
Poop fertilizes farms more efficiently and speeds crop growth more efficiently


DEPLOYING / BUILDING

an unsuccessful deploy will not consume the deployable
chests can be placed closer together
non-colliding deployables can be placed closer together
twigs and grass to not become exhaustable until you transplant them (in existing saves, everything counts as not-yet-transplanted, because I wasn’t tracking this before)
transplanted grass is good for 20 cycles per poop


USING GRASS

fillers (other than twigs and petals) can no longer be used in the crock pot
traps can be used 10 times instead of 5
recipe changes to reduce grass usage:
Torch uses 1 less grass
Trap uses 2 less grass
Bugnet uses 1 less rope
farms cost less poop to make
Golden tools use 2 less gold
Panflute uses 1 less rope
rope uses 1 less grass
papyrus uses 2 less reeds
logsuit uses 2 less rope
spear uses 1 rope instead of 2 grass
strawhat uses 12 grass instead of 25
beefalo hat, beehat, tophat use no grass
football helmet uses 3 less pigskin, 1 less rope


MISC

Axe, pickaxe (and gold equivalents) last a bit longer
Minerhat lasts twice as long
Fire fueling values have been updated: (all times for campfire, x2 for firepit)
Grass gives 22.5 seconds of light
Logs give 75 seconds of light


PIGS

pigs don’t eat off the ground as often
pigs don’t eat mandrakes
pigs can be given veggiesmore often, and will refuse them if you try to do it too often
pig houses take 3 days to rebuild a dead pig
pigs drop either a meat or a pigskin (75%-25% split)
pigs, spider, and hounds can eat pigskins"
