Cab driver Francis 'Chas' Chandler leads an unremarkable existence. His greatest moments have come 

tagging along with John Constantine -- as a chauffeur. His home life is nothing special, and his beloved 

London is becoming a soulless metropolis. In middle age, Chas is stuck in a rut.

But Chas is a master of 'The Knowledge', the elaborate system of routes and landmarks which every London 

cabbie must memorize. Until now, The Knowledge has been just a tool for Chas. But now, he's about to 

discover a more sinister significance of The Knowledge.

An ominous entity from London's grim history has reemerged, and only someone with The Knowledge can stop 

it. Is Chas up to the task, on his own? From the feverish mind of Simon Oliver (THE EXTERMINATORS, GEN 

13) with lush artwork by Goran Sudzuka (Y: THE LAST MAN, LADY CONSTANTINE), THE KNOWLEDGE is Chas's 

chance to make his own mark on the dark universe of HELLBLAZER.
