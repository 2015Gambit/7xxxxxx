This is the "full length" (~142 minute) version of the Director's Cut of "The Lawnmower Man".

Video track was taken from "Der.Rasenmaehermann.GERMAN.1992.AC3.DVDRiP.XviD.iNTERNAL-HACO" release and English audio was taken from an independent LaserDisc-rip release. HACO's video quality is better than that of the LaserDisc-rip release but it is still not faultless since the guy who encoded it was obviously a total clueless noob and didn't do a proper job at deinterlacing the video. But it's the best video available, short of the actual German DVD which I was unable to find online.

By the way, the "full length" (~142 minute) Director's Cut of "The Lawnmower Man" is only available as a fullscreen (4:3 aspect ratio) German DVD (German audio track only -- no English audio on that DVD). Luckily someone made a LaserDisc-rip so I was able to take the English audio track from that release and mux it together with the German XViD video track and make a watchable version of this movie.
