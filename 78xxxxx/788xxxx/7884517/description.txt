Match of the Day Two 02.12.2012

Colin Murray presents highlights from the day's Premier League game, which pits Norwich City against Sunderland at Carrow Road. The match sees Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill return to the club where he had spells as both player and manager. The Black Cats have a poor record away to the Canaries - their last league win there was 27 years ago. So far this season, O'Neill's side have been tough to beat but over-reliant on summer signing and top scorer Steven Fletcher. A rare away win would therefore be a real boost to the Wearsiders' confidence.

The Canaries suffered the disruption of losing manager Paul Lambert to Aston Villa this summer. His replacement, former Newcastle and Birmingham boss Chris Hughton, had to wait until City's eighth league game of the season to register a first win, courtesy of Grant Holt's strike against Arsenal. Holt was Norwich's top scorer last season, and the Canaries need him back to his best if they are to avoid being drawn into a relegation struggle.
