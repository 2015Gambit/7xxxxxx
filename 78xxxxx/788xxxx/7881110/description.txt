Rogue Wave's first album, Out of the Shadow, was an underrated indie rock gem that managed to be reminiscent of many fine bands (Yo La Tengo, Elliott Smith, the Elephant 6 collective) without sounding like a carbon copy. Their first single for their second full-length sounds like they haven't change much. "10:1" is taken from their 2005 album Descended Like Vultures and is a clattering rocker that balances a rollicking wave of electric piano and drums with Zach Rogue's yearning vocals. While it sacrifices tunefulness in favor of wild energy, it serves as a fine intro to the album. The other three tracks are exclusive to the release and are as good as anything on the first album. "Interuptions," "Wait for It," and "Crush the Camera" revisit low-key and introspective bedroom pop territory with acoustic guitars and achingly wistful vocals the main focus. Terrifically lovely and tender, they make the disc well worth springing for if you are a fan of the band.
