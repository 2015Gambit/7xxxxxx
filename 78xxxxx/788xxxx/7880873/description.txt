Still Game Christmas Special: Cold Turkey
First broadcast: 28 Dec 2005
BBC

Christmas comes with a bang and a barrel of
laughs to Craiglang. Winston's stolen turkey
turns out to be far from oven-ready, Tam and
Frances enjoy their first yuletide as a married
couple, and Navid's customers get more than
they bargained for with his mulled wine.
