,anacondon,2012-12-04T01:16Z,"I agree w/tookie325: excellent choices and the one that leaped out is ""Last Lion"" (churchill).  Also encountering DRM protection with this particular one (getting 'wrong vendor authorization' blah blah msg when trying to open through Adobe, etc).  Thanks.  Great upload indeed."
