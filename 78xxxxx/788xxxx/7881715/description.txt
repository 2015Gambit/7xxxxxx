PLOT :

For a factory worker named Douglas Quaid, even though he's got
a beautiful wife who he loves, the mind-trip sounds like
the perfect vacation from his frustrating life - real memories
of life as a super-spy might be just what he needs. But when
the procedure goes horribly wrong, Quaid becomes a hunted man
as he finds himself on the run from the police.
