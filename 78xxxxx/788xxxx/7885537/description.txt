Starflyer 59 is an alternative rock band from Riverside, California that was founded in 1993 by Jason Martin, brother of Ronnie Martin of Joy Electric. While Jason Martin has written nearly all of Starflyer 59's songs, the band has included a number of different musicians over the years, including Jeff Cloud, Frank Lenz, and Richard Swift. The band's sound was initially identified as an outgrowth of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, but the band's music has gradually evolved to the point of little resemblance to that of its early days.


Starflyer 59 complete 1994-2010 discography. There are songs missing from some of the collections, eps what have you because they were duplicates. This is everything that I know that they have put out, minus Live at the Paradox (EP) (2002) & Live at Schubas II (2006). I'm not a fan of multiple live versions and all and you might be able to find those elsewhere. I've included various artwork for most of the albums.
