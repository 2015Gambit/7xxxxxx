Welcome to the heavily revised and expanded 2nd edition of Johnston Karate's in-house student manual. Karate is an exciting and rewarding holistic pursuit practiced by millions around the world. Whether you are an existing or prospective student of martial arts, there is always something new to learn. I have hopefully provided a good starting point, as this guide details karate history, various techniques, combat principles, and philosophy. It also goes into detail about Mizuumi ryu Karate, the style of Johnston Karate. If you like this book enough after reading it, please consider purchasing it as a professionally bound and printed trade paperback book, or a Kindle E-Book. Both of these editions includes most of the material from our supplementary guides, which this free edition does not. Visit the official Amazon store -
