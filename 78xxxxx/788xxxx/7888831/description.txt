"Squeak Means Squeak"

Jimmy confronts Sabrina about only doing the 
"fun stuff" with Hope, and none of the heavy 
lifting of parenthood. Sabrina gets the 
chance to prove him wrong when Jimmy joins 
Barney as a Natesville Auxiliary cop for the 
day, and leaves her with Hope. Meanwhile, 
Virginia and Burt are determined to capture 
a squirrel that has been harassing all of 
the other squirrels in the neighborhood.
