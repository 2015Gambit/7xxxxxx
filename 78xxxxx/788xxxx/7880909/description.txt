Produced by Playgrounded and George Alamaras ΓÇ£AthensΓÇ¥ is a testimony of a country and its youth in crisis. It is sketches of a new balance between metal and electronica driven by endless talks on the dead-ends of modern Greece. Influenced by the likes of Tool, Deftones, Porcupine Tree, Karnivool, Dream Theater to name a few, they invite the listener into the deepest details of their soundscapes Playgrounded enlisted Grammy Award winning Ted Jensen(Muse, Dream Theater, Deftones) to master ΓÇ£AthensΓÇ¥, which is released worldwide by Casket Music/Copro Records(UK).
