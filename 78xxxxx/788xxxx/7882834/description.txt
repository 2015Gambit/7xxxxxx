Hi all,

Haven't seen this on Piratebay, decided to upload it. No idea who this was scanned by, so if you know please contact me. A great trio of Green Lantern stories by arguably one of the best comics writers ever, the esteemed Alan Moore. Of note in particularly, "Tygers" was illustrated by Kevin O'Neill, whom he would collaborate with later on "The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen", and "Mogo Doesn't Socialize" was illustrated by Dave Gibbons.

Synthesist noted this earlier- this was packaged on a Mac. For Windows readers, rename the end from a .cbr to a .zip, unzip, and then delete the _MACOSX file. Then repackage. This will allow you to read on a windows computer. Easy process!

Enjoy the comics,
