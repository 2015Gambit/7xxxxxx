Yosemite Sam is an American animated cartoon character in the Looney Tunes and
Merrie Melodies series of cartoons produced by Warner Bros. Animation. The name
is somewhat alliterative and is inspired by Yosemite National Park. He is
commonly depicted as an extremely grouchy gunslinging prospector, outlaw,
pirate or cowboy with a hair-trigger temper and an intense hatred of rabbits,
particularly Bugs Bunny. Along with Elmer Fudd, he is the de facto archenemy of
Bugs Bunny. In cartoons with non-Western themes, he uses various aliases,
including 'Chilkoot Sam' (named for the Chilkoot Trail; Sam pronounces it
'Chilli-koot') in 14 Carrot Rabbit (although in the same cartoon, when he tries
to gain Bugs Bunny's trust, he cleverly invents alias 'Square-deal Sam'),
'Riff Raff Sam' in Sahara Hare, 'Sam Schulz' in Big House Bunny, 'Seagoin' Sam'
in Buccaneer Bunny, 'Shanghai Sam' in Mutiny on the Bunny, and 'Sam Von Schamm
the Hessian' in Bunker Hill Bunny and many others. During the Golden Age of
American animation, Yosemite Sam appeared in 33 shorts.
