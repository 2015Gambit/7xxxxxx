Dynamite presents the return of yet another Legend as Matt Wagner unveils the all-new Zorro! Writer, Art Director, and cover artist Matt Wagner is in command of this all-new year one Zorro comic book adventure. Similar in tone and scope to Dynamite's acclaimed Lone Ranger series, Zorro also features artist Francesco Francavilla who complements Wagner's pulp action writing!  Zorro was created in 1919 by pulp writer Johnston McCulley, and first made his appearance in The Curse of Capistrano, serialized in the pulp magazine All-Story Weekly. From there Zorro has been the star of countless films and has been noted by Bob Kane as a main influence on Batman (Bruce Wayne even went to see Zorro the evening his parents were killed) and recently featured in a WORLD WIDE BEST-SELLING novel by Isabel Allende! Joining Wagner and Francavilla for the return of the legendary Zorro is cover artists Mike Mayhew (with the incredible colors of Dean White) and Lone Ranger cover artist John Cassaday!
