And here you go, the next two Clara After Dark books.

Relieta has once again done an amazing job in both restoring the pages, and translating the books, and I did my part with proofreading editorial work on them.
And if you happen to like these books, there are good news ahead, since relieta is working on a LOT more Clara strips.

There have been a few Clara books out in english, but official and scanlations, under the names Betty by Night (see my Jordi Bernet pack), The best of Betty or Betty by the Hour. For some reason, they decided to rename Clara to a name similar to the inspiration for her, Bettie Page.

But for those of you that dont know Clara/Betty, she is a "lady of the night", a whore with a heart of gold, who tries to raise her son as a single mom who have had to make some hard choises in her life.
The comic itself is two page gags about Claras life, what she gets up to with her job, her friends, and her son.
Mainly it is a comedy book, but with the occasional dose of social realism that quite clearly contrasts and offset the humor in the book, nicely balancing out the books.

This book is NOT for children, it do feature nudity and sexual acts, though it is softcore, nothing worse than you can see on the average HBO TV show :)
