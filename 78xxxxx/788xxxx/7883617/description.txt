Here's the vastly improved third release of the public beta for The Age of Decadence, an isometric, turn-based, single-player 3D role-playing game set in a low magic, post-apocalyptic fantasy world inspired by the fall of the Roman Empire.

Among other improvements, it now includes the alchemy system for you to play around plus the latest update that fixes some bugs the original R3 release had.
