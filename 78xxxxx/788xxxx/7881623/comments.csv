,cipherpunks,2012-12-03T05:29Z,These Speed.Cd torrents are always terribly slow. I don't understand why this is a problem.
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-12-03T06:50Z,"Because EVERY torrent by sceneline is the slowest shit EVER.  They don't bother with getting the files to us in a decent amount of time, because they want to be the first to post everything!"
,cipherpunks,2012-12-03T07:13Z,"Shit, the sound is out of sync."
,inf0x0,2012-12-03T07:21Z,"Plus the audio is out of sync start from the very beginning, unwatchable."
,cipherpunks,2012-12-03T07:37Z,"Oh it gets worse, inf0x0. I shifted the audio track back in sync using a reference point of the gunshot in the opening sequence. It drifts out of sync again within a minute.

On a different site, there's another torrent from Dibya9999 marked PROPER that presumably doesn't suck. His torrents always download faster anyway."
,Ventol667,2012-12-03T07:41Z,WORST TORRENT EVER!  Out of sync so fucking bad that you can't even get it in time at all!  Plus RARed.  I mean in this age of Tbyte hard drive who the fuck rar's anything anymore!  Get your head out of your ass and start doing this shit right!
