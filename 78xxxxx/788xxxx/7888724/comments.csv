,ape2212,2012-12-05T04:02Z,"I'm downloading this only because Rebel Wilson is in it, She is hilarious and will hopefully make all the singing worth it. "
,ELNbotini,2012-12-05T04:48Z,"Thank you!  We NEED more ""Chick Flicks"" as opposed to so many ""Dick Flicks"" that are uploaded on PB! "
,RyanGee92,2012-12-05T04:57Z,I love this movie! I saw it in Theaters twice! I will download & seed when I get home. Thanks so much for this scene4all! Much appreciated.

Faggots."
,ELNbotini,2012-12-05T06:32Z,"sagesagesage; sorry to disappoint you but I'm a very straight female, you homophoic moron.. What are you? 12? Ignorant twit."
,far_kit,2012-12-05T06:51Z,I will take the dick out of my ass so that I can concentrate better

,biitchinbabi17,2012-12-05T07:01Z,"Oh, nvm had to update my torrent client."
,wistfool,2012-12-05T07:04Z,"Hear hear @ ELNbotini's comment. 

If you're a homophobe/misogynist, then please shut up in order to not sound like a dick.

Can more people seed this, please? The download speed's really slow right now."
,keila0407,2012-12-05T07:13Z,are u faggots serious? this movie is good if your a music fan fukn homophobic closet queens calling ppl gay for watching it coz ur hiding the fact ur gay urself grow up lil poofs

,kvolk8,2012-12-05T09:39Z,SEED PLEASEEEEEEEEE JUST FUCKING SEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
,PsychoticDragonfly,2012-12-05T11:33Z,"@keila0407, So because you dislike people calling others gay, you're simply going to toss it back at them? Sound logic there. 

In any case, this is an awesome movie. While you may disagree, and that's perfectly fine, it's hardly necessary to start calling eachother names. And I see no reason why 'gay' should be tossed around in the first place. If you're so scared about your masculinity being taken away from watching a movie of all things, I'm sorry to say, but it's likely you never had any to begin with."
,Babygeorge,2012-12-05T11:57Z,I was not even interested in this movie...but now thanks to sagesagesage/ba567 comments I will put a dildo inside me and watch this with the utmost pleasure ever! :P
,SkeelZ91,2012-12-05T13:12Z,"I have no idea how you guys can find this funny. 
But I guess its just me, after seeing the trailer, I wont be downloading it. Thanks anyways. "
,martaf1,2012-12-05T13:21Z,"Hey love all the movies you do Great Job.

,rara1993,2012-12-05T15:19Z,"OMG scene4all you bloody legend! Ive been looking everywhere for this movie, once again an amazing upload :D"
,Brends2012,2012-12-05T15:31Z,Can anyone give me a Decent reason why this piece of shit is at #1 here on TPB?
,Brends2012,2012-12-05T15:34Z,"Beca, a freshman at Barden University, is cajoled into joining The Bellas,
her school's all-girls singing group. Injecting some much needed energy into their
repertoire, The Bellas take on their male rivals in a campus competition. ?? Shit story guys!! lol.."

others are soundin like whimpy kids"
,Phatfish,2012-12-05T20:51Z,"I have hard time believing this deserves being here or the 7,6 it got on IMDB. It probably gonna prove once again that IMDB has derailed completely as a website. TPB seem to be not far behind sadly.

However I will watch and see. "
,mmmfafa,2012-12-05T21:56Z,I came. 
,Bnt33,2012-12-05T22:05Z,"While the premise and trailer might seem uninspired and lame, the movie is pretty good. 

A lot funnier than most would expect, great musical performances, the scene stealing Rebel Wilson, and Anna Kendrick was awesome as well. 

The movie pokes fun at itself too and doesn't take it too seriously. "

Great Movie!!"
,-UTA-,2012-12-06T02:16Z,"Thanks for uploading! I find it hilarious how everyone in the comments is calling this a chick/gay flick and they can't watch it to protect their masculinity (im looking at you crwildman, BA567, sagesagesage). Chill out, its a fucking movie. There is a target audience but there is no such thing as a movie that only ""chicks"" can watch. You all probably really want to see this but your to afraid you will be called gay if you do. Grow up!  "
,jagwiz69,2012-12-06T02:49Z,this is a chick/gay flick.
,bran2k,2012-12-06T03:55Z,"Watching now, awesome movie really fun. A/V 10/10
Oh and there is plenty of penis in it for all of you straight guys afraid it's a gay movie because girls are in it."

,Evil_Star,2012-12-06T05:46Z,"not really a fan of these but the trailers look funny so ill give it a look

also you'd think with this many seeders and being this high on TPB roster i would actually be able to get more than 130kb/s"
,pxpierre,2012-12-06T06:47Z,"From RT: ""What we have here is a not-very-funny college comedy for tweens, full of unappealing characters (and although the musical arrangements are fun, some truly unimaginative choreography). """
,smellmyar3e,2012-12-06T07:02Z,I guess the intellectually challenged morons bashing this as gay/chick material must have really strained to see past their guts to their dicks. It's good entertainment if you like this sort of thing. If you don't then just shut the fuck up and post your ignorance in some other forum.

,MoviePirater,2012-12-06T12:09Z,"The quality is good, however the movie itself isn't all that good. I watched this movie because Adam Devine is in it. I was hoping that because he is in it that is would be funny, but for the most part it's just a chick flick."

,rocdriller,2012-12-06T16:09Z,"Gotta luv how Hollywood continues shove this pop culture bullshit down our throats. It's kinda like politics, they wanna dictate how yu act, feel, eat, live yur life, etc. Keep the masses stupid. Its all crap "

,pezster,2012-12-07T09:07Z,Someone here wrote that this movie is better than Twilight? That's not gay. That's 端bergay. 
,keila0407,2012-12-07T09:32Z,thanks for taking my comment and rewording it psychoticdragonfly you almost said the exact same thing bar the attempted insult in the beginning anyway to the person expecting it to be funny because adam devine is in it? are u for real? you must find tracy morgans overacting hilarious aswel
,Solkyl,2012-12-07T09:55Z,The fact that you said ubergay makes you ubergay
