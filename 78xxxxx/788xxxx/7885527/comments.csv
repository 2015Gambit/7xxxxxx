,sup1990,2012-12-04T18:58Z,thanks!
,mpup54,2012-12-04T19:47Z,"k3nd00d, can you also post the HDTVepisode 4 of this show? The  current one that someone else posted on TPB was cropped to counter an aspect ratio issue and has a black line running through it.

I already watched your first three episodes and each rip was well done with no issues at all. Im looking forward to your episode 4 post and beyond.

Thanks in advance"
,k3nd00d,2012-12-05T09:24Z,"psspss already found a source for ep4 and fixed it up and uploaded it on 11/30 so I did not bother capturing the re-air on 12/02.

,djarmani,2012-12-06T11:16Z,I vote k3nd00d do a rip of s3 ep 4 too! Thank you for capping the episodes :)
,djarmani,2012-12-06T11:19Z,"BTW - Is it just me or does it seem like the network is trying to kill Jesse Ventura's show by making it a bit too silly this season?

All these episodes about aliens and scenes of the cast poorly acting out rehearsed dialogue give the whole series a different feel now.

Anyone else agree?"
,k3nd00d,2012-12-06T18:19Z,"Yes, I agree. They delayed showing this season for a year after both directing them to cover less serious/substantial topics, running the episodes through DHS censors (which resulted in an episode about the TSA and the full body cancer machines at airports being canceled (though the episode exists) and all remaining episodes were re-edited (likely to make them more silly/less substantial)).

I'll cap and encode ep 4 as well, I suppose. I was considering it anyway since it seems some ppl are confused as to why I haven't."
,mpup54,2012-12-07T03:44Z,"k3nd00d thanks for the info about the TSA episode. I wonder if any of our pirates could manage to snag that deleted show.

There was briefly another rip of episode 4 that I saw on another site but that site just reads ""gateway time-out"" now."
,bubbanuggzz,2012-12-07T08:16Z,"thanx for the up man.idk why ppl don't want to dl psspss's rip of ep.4,its the best on the net at the moment.I guess ppl just like the uploaders they like."
,k3nd00d,2012-12-07T08:48Z,It is nice to be liked Even if I am fairly unsocial. 8)
