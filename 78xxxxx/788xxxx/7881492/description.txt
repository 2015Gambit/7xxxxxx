The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday, December 2 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the ongoing effort by the international banksters to take down the United States with their relentless economic warfare and long-term effort to consolidate power and foist a centralized globalist government on the nation and the world as a whole. He talks about the so-called ΓÇ£fiscal cliffΓÇ¥ currently under negotiation behind closed doors by the corporatist one party system and what it means to the future of a withering middle class and America as a whole as an engineered astronomical debt piles up and the value of the dollar slides toward the abyss.
