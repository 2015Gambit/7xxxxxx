Somewhere around 250 free hardstyle releases from facebook, youtube, artist websites, forums, etc... Mostly old stuff 2008-2010, and a few recent packs.

Not all in maximum format, I converted wav/flac downloads to 320 mp3.

Thought it'd be nice for people new to hardstyle, most of these aren't available online anymore.

Enjoy!
