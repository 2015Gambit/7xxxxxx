Angry Bones came together from friends recommending friends to other
friends and in the end after many phonecalls, mails, meetings (and
denying a 3 year old drummer the drummer job) the band was formed.
Within 3 months, the songs were written, rewritten practised in a no
toilet studio and then recorded in Studio Syrland, where there are
heavenly toilets! We hope you enjoy our music and we look forward to
maybe performing live someday in a toilet near you.
