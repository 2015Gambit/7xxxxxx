

The Songs and Sonnets, Elegies, Holy Sonnets, and Prose of John Donne, read by Corin and Vanessa Redgrave.

Corin Redgrave was a classical actor whose career culminated in a King Lear that had echoes of his father's performance in the role. Vanessa Redgrave, among a great many other things, is a great Shakespearian actress. Both are superb readers of 17C English poetry.
