,bosco8145,2012-12-03T19:57Z,Agree with Oldman38.  RAR file missing.  Will not install.
,jx91,2012-12-03T20:28Z,"no it´s not! this is a scenerelease, they are always rar:d first and then zipped. that´s just the way it is.

unzip all zips, and then you have all the rar:s.

if that´s a problen then don´t download it.

otherwise Enjoy! :)"

,puppydog60,2012-12-03T23:39Z,"Unzip all the files to a separate folder the unzip the files in the new folder.
Works like a charm.
Thank you very much for this. "
,Oldman38,2012-12-04T01:11Z,I am sorry about first comment. Didn't realize that each zip file had to be opened individually. program works great. Thanks for the great upload.
