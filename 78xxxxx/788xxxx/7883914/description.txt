Diners, Drive-ins and Dives-S11E02-Po Boys, Pasta and Pork

The long "missing" episode! Well, almost. 

According to someone's Excel listing of all the shows, the three restaurants featured were
  Mahony's PO Boy Shop - New Orleans, LA
  Q-Fanatic BBQ and Grill - Champlin, MN
  Hills' Restaurant and Lounge - Spokane, WA

One day, I got to thinking that all the parts might be available somewhere. I found two individual segments on YouTube, but the Hill's Restaurant segment was not there. Looking around, I found it right on their website.

They were all different quality/size, so I did some editing and reconstruction and created this. Because of the show's consistency in it's various lead-ins, I even think I got them in the right order.

It isn't the highest quality. The best I could do with the worst quality segment was 480x360, but it works pretty well for anyone who wants to watch it.
