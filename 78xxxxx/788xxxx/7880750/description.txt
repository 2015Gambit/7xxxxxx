Information
------------------------------

Cross of Iron is the only war film directed by master filmmaker Sam Peckinpah, starring James Coburn, Maximilian Schell, and James Mason. Director Sam Peckinpah, with the same tenacity and style he brought to such classics as The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs and The Getaway delivers a riveting and violent tale of men on the front lines of battle. Highlighted by Peckinpah's trademark balletic violence and ultrarealistic battle scenes , Cross of Iron blasts open the gates of hell and affirms director Sam Peckinpah's prowess as an action filmmaker of graphic mayhem. At its core, however, it's quite an acute study of the 'universal soldier', and the paradox of fighting for your country but not actually knowing what you are fighting for beyond that. No less a film authority than Orson Welles called it the greatest antiwar movie since All Quiet on the Western Front.

"Passion & Poetry - Sam Peckinpah's War". This documentary by Mike Siegel gives fascinating insight into the making of "Cross of Iron" and Peckinpah's directorial style through contemporary and later interviews with James Coburn, David Warner, Senta Berger, Maximilian Schell, Roger Fritz, Vadim Glowna, Katy Haber and Peckinpah himself. The production background on this Peckinpah classic is again as entertaining as the feature film itself.
