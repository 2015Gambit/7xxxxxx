Description:
Paul the Apostle
2004  NR  145 Min.
From the Emmy award-winning director of Joseph and Jesus comes the story of Paul the Apostle. This miniseries chronicles the life of Christ's most prolific messenger. Paul, originally known as Saul of Tarsus, was a persecutor of Christians until Jesus came to him in a vision. Forever changed, Paul withstood persecution and imprisonment and with unflagging determination he spread the word of Christ. Beautifully shot in the Moroccan desert, Paul the Apostle is a sweeping saga of a man whose story continues after the Passion of Christ.
Director: Roger Young

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
