,Grubster-11,2012-12-04T03:28Z,can anyone confirm this works? 
,360R8D,2012-12-04T03:40Z,"I have not.  didn't think this was gonna come out for another 9-12 months; especially when it was made by a new developer & new engine.  virus scan it, hope for the best.   1.39GB seems small for an open world game that is supposed to have decent graphics,  shoot thinking about left4dead2 is atleast 6GB.  So it seems VERY Sketchy and the uploader Keluizo, doesn't even have one Skull next to his name. "
