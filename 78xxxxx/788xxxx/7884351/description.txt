Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, December 3 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers end of the world hysteria, the impeding fiscal cliff, more accusations of maltreatment even rape at the TSA, and the establishment's effort to continue the legacy of Obama (who continued the legacy of Bush) by running current Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016. 

He also talks about the British version of the IRS spying on citizens as government steps up efforts at wealth confiscation and revenue enhancement.
