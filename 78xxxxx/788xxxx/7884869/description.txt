[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this bitch, everybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be digging me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleek
All these bitches think theyΓÇÖre the shit, I sent them up shits creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
ItΓÇÖs OK if you turn up just donΓÇÖt turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what IΓÇÖm smoking I grew it
These are Blood gang Piru it, all rats gotta die even Stewart
On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You donΓÇÖt get dissed, you get disfigured
She sorry I didnΓÇÖt shave so that pussy is a little furry
I put that pussy in my face I ainΓÇÖt got no worries
Tunechi

[Hook: Detail]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We ainΓÇÖt got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ainΓÇÖt got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar I say why you in a hurry
She say why you asking questions I say bitch you tryna be funny
Now take them fucking clothes off, let me see your donkey kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bars
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my hoe, I swear she was with my hoe
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch itΓÇÖs Tunechi and IΓÇÖm out here, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit would be a long story
