But where is the 540p? "
[V],Nepotu,2012-12-03T17:35Z,"Thank you all for your great words! You are all my dear friends, and everytime you're happy, I'm happy.
The 540p version it isn't ripped yet. I'm waiting the ripper for this. Later, I think."
,jayspot,2012-12-03T18:29Z,Whoo-hoo!  Thanks again Nepotu!  The world is a better place with you :-)
,jayspot,2012-12-03T18:45Z,unable to download :-(
,rabbit.on.the.moon,2012-12-03T18:49Z,"I echo everyone's sentiments Nepotu... Just looking at your upload history shows your dedication, and we all appreciate it greatly!  Thank you!  And this is another high quality upload, in case anyone couldn't figure that out."
,chiatlpole,2012-12-03T20:51Z,"Hey thanks Nepotu so much for all your work, your awesome for getting all the games, if you can rip a copy under 4g i would greatly appreciate it....720/540/rar doesn't matter to me thanks again!!! I am stuck with fat32 :("
,rabbit.on.the.moon,2012-12-03T20:57Z,"He'll almost always put it up in 540p also, which will be well under 4GB."
[V],Nepotu,2012-12-04T00:21Z,"Thank you, thank you, my friends! Your words really make me feel very happy and very pleased. Real friends...
By the 540p, I'll try to find, like always, 720p and 540p for every game. Today the rippers are very lazy :) I hope don't disappoint you."
,courtdeze,2012-12-04T02:36Z,"You sir, are a great person. NFL wants me to pay another $40 on top of my already ludicrous cable bill just to watch the replay.

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!!!!!"
