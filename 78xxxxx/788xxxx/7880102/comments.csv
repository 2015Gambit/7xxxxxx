2. start the BeaverX installer
3. select a language
4. go back to the 'Temp' folder. two new directories will have been created. 
   Open the one at the bottom.
5. inside you will see two files and one folder. open that folder.
6. copy the 'ascrypt.dll' from the 'crack' folder to that folder you just opened (overwrite the existing file).
7. now proceed with the installer and leave all the registration fields open :-)"
