All Music Guide - Ned Raggett
Thanks to its distinct, downright catchy single "Orinoco Flow," which 
amusingly referenced both her record-company boss Rob Dickins and co-
producer Ross Cullum in the lyrics, Enya's second album Watermark 
established her as the unexpected queen of gentle, Celtic-tinged new age 
music. To be sure, her success was as much due to marketing a niche 
audience in later years equally in love with Yanni and Michael Flatley's Irish 
dancing, but Enya's rarely given a sense of pandering in her work. She does 
what she does, just as she did before her fame. Admittedly, avoiding 
overblown concerts run constantly on PBS hasn't hurt. Indeed, the subtlety 
that characterizes her work at her best dominates Watermark, with the lovely 
title track, her multi-tracked voice gently swooping among the lead piano, and 
strings like a softly haunting ghost, as fine an example as any. "Orinoco Flow" 
itself, for all its implicit dramatics, gently charges instead of piling things on, 
while the organ-led "On Your Shore" feels like a hushed church piece. 
Elsewhere, meanwhile, Enya lets in a darkness not overly present on The 
Celts, resulting in work even more appropriate for a moody soundtrack than 
that album. "Cursum Perficio," with her steady chanting-via-overdub of the 
title phrase, gets more sweeping and passionate as the song progresses, 
matched in slightly calmer results with the equally compelling "The Longships." 
"Storms in Africa," meanwhile, uses drums from Chris Hughes to add to the 
understated, evocative fire of the song, which certainly lives up to its name. 
Watermark ends with a fascinating piece, "Na Laetha Geal M'Oige," where 
fellow Irish modern/traditional fusion artist Davy Spillane adds a gripping, 
heartbreaking uilleann pipe solo to the otherwise calm synth-based 
performance. It's a perfect combination of timelessness and technology, an 
appropriate end to this fine album.
