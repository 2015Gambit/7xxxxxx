good quality clearscan pdf

Another scan of this book has been available for several years, but it's low quality. This new scan uses a text that has no underlining, cross-outs or notes. Pages are split; deskewed; centered. The pdf has full bookmarks for contents and accurate metadata.

If you have this book and Basic Writings (published by Modern Library), then you have all of Nietzsche's major works in the excellent Kaufmann translation.

description:

The works of Friedrich Nietzsche have fascinated readers around the world ever since the publication of his first book more than a hundred years ago. As Walter Kaufmann, one of the worldΓÇÖs leading authorities on Nietzsche, notes in his introduction, ΓÇ£Few writers in any age were so full of ideas,ΓÇ¥ and few writers have been so consistently misinterpreted.

The Portable Nietzsche includes KaufmannΓÇÖs definitive translations of the complete and unabridged texts of NietzscheΓÇÖs four major works: Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist, Nietzsche Contra Wagner and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. In addition, Kaufmann brings together selections from his other books, notes, and letters, to give a full picture of NietzscheΓÇÖs development, versatility, and inexhaustibility.
