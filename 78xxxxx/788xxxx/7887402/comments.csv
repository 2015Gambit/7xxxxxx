,kangir,2012-12-04T21:35Z,thanks for this. but could you upload this in rar or cbr format? 
,FriendlySpidey,2012-12-04T21:45Z,"Don't know about this one, but I've downloaded lots of comics that were in .pdf. i just changed the file extension to .cbr and it opened in the comic reader on my PC and on my tablet. It's worth a try."
,kangir,2012-12-04T22:12Z,"om using cdisplay on pc, and it did not work. instead i just opened the file in photoshop and extracted the images"
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-04T22:38Z,Renaming the file from .PDF to .CBR works.
,arzo82,2012-12-05T10:11Z,Any chance for a cbr upload? I've downloaded this and switched the .pdf to .cbr but the file isn't viewable after the switch.
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-05T11:53Z,"Use ComicRack 9.156 after renaming the file from .PDF to .CBR, creating the .RAR file from the extracted images works in CDisplay."
,thecardmonster,2012-12-05T14:22Z,pdf's blow
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-05T15:40Z,No .PDF's work.
,arzo82,2012-12-06T12:47Z,"I got this to work by using your steps above. Thanks for the explanation on that.

The images seem fairly grainy though. Any thoughts on how to improve that?"
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-06T14:45Z,Use higher DPI when creating the images that causes bigger file size and images. The images used in this torrent are best for file size and clarity. Recommend using page layout two pages in ComicRack 9.156 letting the application adjust to each image loaded for best viewing quality.
