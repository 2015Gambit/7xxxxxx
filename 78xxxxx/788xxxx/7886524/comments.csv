[T],spanikopita,2012-12-05T00:22Z,"Look in my torrents for Reformed Theology and the two Christian Mega Packs. 

Find the authors Kostenberger, Craig Evans, Dunn, Hurtado, F. F. Bruce, Bauckham, Boyd, Brueggemann and Ehrman. 

By the way, Ehrman is a devout athiest, but an outstanding critical scholar on Christian origins.

1. Open the URL of the torrent.
2. Click on the number by ""Files"" (like this one is 238).
3. CTL-F any of those names I just mentioned.

There may be lots more hidden in there, but this should give you a great start at some seriously good scholarship on the topics you mentioned. "

Thanks."
,dm1969,2012-12-05T05:35Z,"Dear Spanikopita, I downloaded your reformed torrent but one of the books was empty. only 2 pages.  can you please reup ""the christian tradition"" by jaroslav pelikan. i really want that 5 volume book. thanks alot."
[T],spanikopita,2012-12-05T14:06Z,dm1969...the file is now converted. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7890677
[T],spanikopita,2012-12-05T14:13Z,"Thank you both. I know some overlap will happen and not all those hundreds of books will operate smoothly. 

I do try my best, but since my brain only works at half speed (when at all), it may just appear like bad work. Please forgive my sometimes shoddy efforts. 

It is embarrassing at times to have a ""trusted"" skull and then not provide that service 100%. If you stick with me, I will continue to upload as long as I can."
