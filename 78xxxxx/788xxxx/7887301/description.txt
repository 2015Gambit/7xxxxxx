The true story behind the notorious international murder

In Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007, police discovered the body of a
British college student stabbed to death in her bedroom. The prosecutor
alleged that the brutal murder had occurred during a drug-fueled sex
game gone wrong. Her housemate, American honor student Amanda Knox,
quickly became the prime suspect and soon found herself the star of a
sensational international story, both vilified and eroticized by the
tabloids and the Internet.
