In this sequel of the first Jack Frost movie, Sheriff Sam Tiler,
his wife Anne, and Sam's two deputies (also husband and wife)
decide to go on a Caribbean vacation to take their minds off the
traumatic events of the previous movie in a place with absolutely
no snow. Their holiday will be short-lived, however, as the thawed
murderer gets inadvertantly re-frozen and brought back to life.
As if that weren't bad enough, he now has the ability to remain
frozen even in tropical temperatures, and he's headed south to
settle some old scores.
