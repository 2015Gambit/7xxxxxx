From Publishers Weekly
The authors, management consultants and partners of JeffersonLarsonSmith, offer a fascinating look at corporate tribesΓÇögroups of 20ΓÇô150 people within a company that come together on their own rather than through management decisionsΓÇöand how executives can use tribes to maximize productivity and profit. Drawing upon research from a 10-year study of more than 24,000 people in two dozen organizations, they argue that tribes have the greatest influence in determining how much and what quality work gets done. The authors identify the five stages of employee tribal developmentΓÇöLife sucks, My life sucks, I'm great and you're not, We're great and Life is greatΓÇöand offer advice on how to manage these groups. They also share insights from the health care, philanthropic, engineering, biotechnology and other industries and include key points lists for each chapter. Particularly useful is the Tribal Leader's Cheat Sheet, which helps determine and assess success indicators. Well written and enlightening, this book will be of interest to business professionals at all levels. (Feb.)
