CGI animation, originally aired on network TV in 1997. They went back and re-rendered all the scenes for IMAX theaters in 2002. The newer presentation is not just HD, but widescreen as well, which really opens up the outdoor snow battle scenes.

Original video was 1080i HDTV rip with Russian audio. Deinterlaced, re-encoded as 720p and remuxed with English audio from DVD. There's a little audio sync mismatch (about 200ms) toward the end, but not too bad.

Happy holidays, enjoy and please seed.
