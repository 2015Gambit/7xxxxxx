Professor Farnsworth sends the Planet Express crew to Neptune to shut down Robot SantaΓÇÖs naughty-or-nice tracking system, which is spreading embarrassing personal information about everyone across the Internet. However, an overload of so much secret information may very well destroy Earth unless Robot Santa can bring a little peace on Earth and goodwill to all men.
