Mikey Dread's productions have always been at the top of the heap, whether collaborating with masters like King Tubby and Lee Perry, or even working with the Clash. Mikey made that rare progression from top radio DJ (on Jamaican National Radio) to actual recording artist, but he never strayed too far from his radio roots on his records. One of his earliest hit albums, AFRICAN ANTHEM, sounded a lot like his radio show, including shout-outs, announcements, drops, and skits tucked in among the mind-blowing dubs.
