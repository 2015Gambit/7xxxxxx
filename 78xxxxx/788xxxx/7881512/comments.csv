Sadly, my answer is the same as last time - When they fly by, I'll snag them.

So far, no luck, they don't exist in cyber space as yet.

Sigh ...

Check my record - If it says ""AVIGUY"" and was posted by ""MP4SUX"", then it IS legit.

Click on my link above and see last week's upload to compare.

Enjoy,
