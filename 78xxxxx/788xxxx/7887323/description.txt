Robot Chicken - Season 6 - Episode 11 (WEB-DL - MP4)
----------------------------------------------------

Robot Chicken is back for its Sixth Season of hilariously insane, wackadoodle,
totally off the wall stop-motion animation! This season's 20 brand spankin' new
episodes will flash images across your retinas and flood your brains with an
overabundance of mind-melting pop culture spoofery that will most likely cause
your head to explode and leave a stain on the couch that will never come out (sorry Mom)!

Produced by Stoopid Monkey, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, Sony Pictures and Williams Street.

Robot Chicken creates a new Sesame Street character; The Mario Bros. spend
all those gold coins they've collected; What we imagine Pinky and the Brain
would do if they had a wild night on the town. Two Vietnamese guards try to
break Rambo in our reimagining of this famous movie scene.
