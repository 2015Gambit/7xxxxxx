,crwildman,2012-12-05T02:03Z,"@shadohchaser  If you don't know what a false positive is, then you shouldn't be pirating or using any cracked software.  You sir are a complete moron and your account should be deleted and IP banned.   "

,shadohchaser,2012-12-05T09:47Z,"Fuck you COWARDS stupid fucks...is it wrong to say when I get a positive? Fucking fucks...

,charlene17,2012-12-05T12:24Z,"Well, nostalgia isn't strong enough to play such a shitty game with an over scripted playfield (using (again) unreal engine acting like a bad game system not allowing to save or restart when you fail). I don't own a modern computer to turn it into an old playstation or such.

Karateka, go back to limbo (you should have rested with your apple][ box) !"
,Relaq,2012-12-05T12:42Z,God Damm what a stupid game.Sorry but this is not wort to download it.
,Jona198102,2012-12-05T20:20Z,"The torrent is fine. I also get a false positive but that's just the way Theta does their installers. Had the same 'positive' with Magic the Gathering.. It's all good.

Fun game and a good remake!

Thanks HeroMaster!"
