Chinese novelist Mo Yan won the 2012 Nobel Prize for Literature. There are six of his books here. All are in epub and mobi format except Red Sorghum, which is a pdf.

Red Sorghum is a new scan. It's not yet available in ebook form except for this pdf. It's an optimized image pdf of good quality.

includes: 

Red Sorghum
Big Breasts and Wide Hips
The Garlic Ballads
Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out
The Republic of Wine
Shifu, You'll Do Anything for a Laugh (short stories)

Files are calibre-ready -- just import to get full metadata added. Epubs have embedded fonts.

For android users I recommend aldiko for epub files and ebookdroid for pdf files. Ebookdroid in particular is dramatically better for pdf ebooks than any other app I've seen.

For windows users I recommend calibre (it's essential) and adobe digital editions for epub. I don't use mobi files but the kindle app will open them.
