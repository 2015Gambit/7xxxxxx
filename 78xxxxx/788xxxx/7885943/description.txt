These tracks are from the CD "See Saw" by Eidolon (South Africa). They are all by Tanya Vandenberg, and are available to anyone to listen and use as they wish. Please just remember to credit me (Tanya Vandenberg) if you choose to use any of the tracks, or any part of them, for web use, distribution, commercial use, remixing or sampling. Thanks!

This is the second torrent, apologies to those who tried the first one - I had problems with utorrent. I hope this works better.
