Cinebooks' English translation of Les Aventures du Grand Vizir Iznogoud.

In Baghdad, the Caliph’s Grand Vizier Iznogoud has one aim in life: to become Caliph instead of the Caliph. The benign ruler, Haroun al Plassid is blind to his vizier’s scheming to get rid of him and generally had rather take a nap. Iznogoud is faithfully seconded by Wa’at Alahf in trying to put his fiendish designs into action.  Here are the adventures of the Grand Vizier Iznogoud!
