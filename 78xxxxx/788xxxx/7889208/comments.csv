,casidios,2012-12-05T10:28Z,Waiting the xvid version...
,cancab,2012-12-05T13:00Z,may have convert xvid myself although i prefer to leave it to those who know how to do it better than I....nothing against mp4 ....just not campatible with current software and playback formats ..oh well
,STONEDSTONER,2012-12-05T13:04Z,"i know we have to wait fucking AGES for XVID its a joke, eztv and numerous others supply x264, it bs why doesnt ettv stick to xvid and eztv stick with x264? would be alot better

I WANNA WATCH THE LAST EP ALREADY , I dont give a fuck about DL speeds just put the fucking torrent up already"
,casidios,2012-12-05T14:00Z,"No xvid, really? A lot of people in other countries no US, need the AVI version to put the subtitles on the PS3 or other Media Players"
,cancab,2012-12-05T14:36Z,"@STONEDSTONER
I got the ipressions u were piss w/me
iwant the xvid as bad as u and others...never took this long before ETTV is usually only a little behind
the mp4 file "
,STONEDSTONER,2012-12-05T15:16Z,"cancab lol if you take anything said on the internets personally theres something very wrong with you 

Fuck it i ended up just DL this... ill convert it myself

And the Difference in video quality between SD Xvid and SD x264 is barley noticeable , its just that xvid is supported by ALOT more devices

Stupid idea the scene supporting x264 for non HD stuff"
