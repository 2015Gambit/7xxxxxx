,ajsztehlo,2012-12-04T10:51Z,"Hi tuchaj, I'm afraid I don't have any that are not already on piratebay. I believe you can find those at: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7754899/The_Lone_Ranger_Zorro__The_Death_Of_Zorro_ and http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7750292/Zorro_Rides_Again__1-12 , but I don't know about the ongoing series. It's on my list of things to do. I'll get around to tracking the issues individually and putting a torrent together some time soon, but busy at work at the moment- so could be a couple of months. Cheers, ajsztehlo"
,ajsztehlo,2012-12-04T11:22Z,"Hi tuchaj, just started putting the torrent together now, should be up in a few days. I'll also package the other miniseries in together to have a complete dynamite zorro package (aside from masks which has just started)"
,tuchaj,2012-12-04T11:40Z,"Yeah i was looking for Zorro 01-20, not the later Zorro Rides Again series, and i could not find it anywhere, thx for the quick answer anyway, cheers"
,ajsztehlo,2012-12-04T11:44Z,"Haha no problem. Problem with obscurity of Dynamite is that there aren't many torrents, but can always find individual issues up on rapidshare. Anyway, got a few, will try and get a torrent up in a few days, some issues are proving harder to find."
[T],blackcanary,2012-12-04T13:50Z,I have Zorro v1 #1-19.  Once I find #20 I'll upload it if ajsztehlo hasn't already.  I'll also upload Zorro - Matanzas #1-4 (2010) later if ajsztehlo hasn't already.
,ajsztehlo,2012-12-04T14:21Z,"Hi blackcanary, I have NONE of those. Thanks for putting this together!"
