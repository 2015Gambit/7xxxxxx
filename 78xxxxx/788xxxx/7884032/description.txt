Wile E. Coyote (also known simply as 'The Coyote') and The Road Runner are a duo of
cartoon characters from a series of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons.
The characters (a coyote and Greater Roadrunner) were created by animation director
Chuck Jones in 1948 for Warner Bros., while the template for their adventures was
the work of writer Michael Maltese. The characters star in a long-running series
of theatrical cartoon shorts (the first 16 of which were written by Maltese)
and occasional made-for-television cartoons.
In each episode, instead of animal senses and cunning, Wile E. Coyote uses absurdly
complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) and elaborate plans
to pursue his quarry. It was originally meant to parody chase cartoons like
Tom and Jerry, but it became popular, much to Jones' chagrin.
