Assisting the FBI in their attempt to recover the missing boy, Stephanie reaches into the past to uncover the motive for the abduction. Has Jimmy been taken by his own relatives? Is StephanieΓÇÖs obsessive ex-lover trying to teach her a lesson? Has one of ScarlettΓÇÖs stalkers come back to haunt them all?
