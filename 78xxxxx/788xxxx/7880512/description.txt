The Tasmanian Devil, often referred to as Taz, is an animated cartoon character featured
in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes series of cartoons. The character appeared in only
five shorts before Warner Bros. Cartoons closed down in 1964, but marketing and
television appearances later propelled the character to new popularity in the 1990s.
As the youngest of the Looney Tunes, the Tasmanian Devil, or 'Taz' as he has come to
be known, is generally portrayed as a dim-witted omnivore with a notoriously short temper
and little patience. He will eat anything and everything, with an appetite that seems
to know no bounds. He is best known for his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls
and rasps, and his ability to spin and bite through just about anything.
