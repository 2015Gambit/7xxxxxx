,airth,2012-12-04T22:33Z,any chance for the mac version of this?
,trsalemme,2012-12-04T23:22Z,"hahah  nice virus.  dont d/l people.  Use the other torrent to d/l. The one with all the zip/ rars.  It takes a whole..30 extra seconds to unrar the stuff...and IT WORKS>  unlike this one...click on installer.exe and if u have a decent a/v, it will jump all over it. and please..no lamerz posting about how keygens are false positives blah blah blah/. There is no keygen with this...and its not cracked.  dont d/l"
,AlexSant,2012-12-05T04:11Z,Mac version please.
,genenioo,2012-12-05T06:28Z,What other torrent?
,bosco8145,2012-12-05T06:31Z,"Scanned this with Avast, AVG and Malwarebytes.  Came out clean.  This is the same program as the one with all the ""zip"" and ""rar"" files.  Once you get finished with the uncompressing steps in the other program you get the same EXACT files that are in this one.  This is much easier to install and it's from a Trusted uploader.  If you like unzipping and then unraring files before you do the installation, then by all means get the other torrent."
,trsalemme,2012-12-05T13:26Z,"it LOOKS like the same files...if you run the 'installer.exe' though..and you have a decent a/v...you will see what i mean. Genino, there are only 2 turbotax 2012 torrents right now. The other one works fine."
,trsalemme,2012-12-05T13:27Z,working version....http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7883596/Intuit.TurboTax.Home.and.Business.v2012-Lz0
,bosco8145,2012-12-05T16:05Z,"They ARE the same files.  Had a friend run this through Kaspersky and it was clean.  I've downloaded the other torrent and installed it on another pc.  It installed fine but again, had to do all the unzipping and unraring before you could install.  Some people are not familiar with the uncompressing process and this torrent is just easier to install for those people.  Doubleclick the installer and you're done.  No warnings of viruses, no error messages and a fully functional program.  And again, not to mention, it's from a trusted uploader.  I doubt he would have earned a VIP ""skull"" if he was uploading files with viruses.  Maybe it's time for YOU to get a ""decent a/v"" and not one reporting viruses where there are none.  As I'm sure you are aware, NO a/v is immune from reporting false positives.  This torrent is clean!!  Both torrents work fine...this is just an easier installation from a trusted uploader. "
,genenioo,2012-12-05T20:33Z,"I got this to work fine, too.  It's kind of weird--the ""setup.exe"" gave some strange messages and might even have a virus, but if you just use the ""turbo tax 2012 installer"" inside the main folder it sets up fine.  As a matter of fact it seems you could just delete all the stuff outside the main folder and everything still works fine.  Still trying to figure out the purpose of the remaining files."
,edbianc,2012-12-05T22:47Z,"I would appreciate a MAC version, thanks!"
