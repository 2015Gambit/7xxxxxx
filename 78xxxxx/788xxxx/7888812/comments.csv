--------
1- Go to regedit
2- Find the folder: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREUbisoftFarcry 3, and make sure the path in InstallDir and the Version number are correct.
2.1- Then go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall
2.2- Create a new key in this folder named {E3B9C5A9-BD7A-4B56-B754-FAEA7DD6FA88} exactly like this. Then in the new key you just created, make a new string named DisplayVersion, and set it value to the version of the game you have(1.00 or 1.01). Then launch the update file (1.01 or 1.02) and it should work.
