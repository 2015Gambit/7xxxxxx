CLASSICS ILLUSTRATED was a comic book series featuring adaptations of literary classics such as Moby Dick, Hamlet, and The Iliad. Created by Albert Kanter, the series began publication in 1941 and finished its first run in 1971, producing 169 issues. Following the demise of the series, various companies reprinted its titles.

Marvel began publishing MARVEL CLASSICS COMICS, their own full color classic novel adaptations, with DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE in 1976. In all, 36 of them were produced and they were generally well drawn and well interpreted. Some gaffes were made - H. G. Wells' The First Men in the Moon was attributed to Jules Verne and The Cyclops in HomerΓÇÖs Odyssey was drawn as horned and purple - Marvel simply couldn't stop drawing outlandish, out of this world monsters! Most of the titles had appeared in the Classics Illustrated series but two new ones were adapted - H. Rider HaggardΓÇÖs She and Bram StokerΓÇÖs Dracula. After two years, the series ended.
