,BostonAl2012,2012-12-03T16:42Z,"Thanks Nepotu, some great games this week.  Watching the Steelers/Ravens now, followed by the 2nd half of the Jets/Cardinals, then the 49er's/Rams, then it's all about the COMEBACK KIDS, LUCK & WILSON.  So I'll be DLing Colts/Det and Seahawks/Bears. To cap it all off I'll be re-watching the Pats go Phishing.  Thanks for all your work, take your time, because I'm just getting started! ;) But keep them coming PLEASE!
