man  you're a legend, of course we could be friends.. Well I can't imagine how much time you're spending on uploading each awesome torrents you brought here.. I can feel your sacrifice.. :) Keep safe.. cheers.."
[V],Nepotu,2012-12-03T09:11Z,"Great, man! Then, friends will be! :) And thank you for your great words! It's my pleasure to be your friend. Also you're a BB legend too, man, with your love for the NBA and your fastness.
Now, how about, who wakes up first (with the russians) :) chooses what will upload (60fps or 30 fps with 540p)? Separately for the early games (by the East Coast time zone. Ex: 12:00, 1:00 ET etc, anyway until 7:00 ET), which has the same rule. The other picks the remaining version. What do you think about that? Or, if you have another suggestion, I like to hear it. Thank you!
I'm waiting your reply. Cheers, brotha!"
[T],Gondy10,2012-12-03T09:41Z,"Thanks for the reply mate.. Man I think i'll go for 60fps/720p's only (as I don't have much time as yours :D)
all 30fps and 540p's, 400p's and 360p's are too much to handle..

Anyway, what do you think?
cheers.."
[V],Nepotu,2012-12-03T10:35Z,"Like a friendship sign, 60fps version for you it is. But for the early games on sunday or saturday (Ex: PHX@NYK from yesterday), first come, first served. Ok?

God bless you, my friend!"
[T],Gondy10,2012-12-03T10:57Z,Sure! No probs.. :D
,trendstarter,2012-12-03T11:10Z,"You guys are both amazing uploaders, and as a laker fan with dish network (aka no broadcasted laker games) you have both saved my ass numerous times this season. Since your both here might I ask if either of you would like to work on the sunday's game ;)"
[V],Nepotu,2012-12-03T17:06Z,"Thank you, trendstarter, in my name and in name of Gondy10. The Lakers' game it's already up (with wrong date, sorry, 23 nov). Cheers!"
