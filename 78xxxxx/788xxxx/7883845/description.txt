Schematics for the Dell N5110.

Request: I have this laptop but it doesn't turn on, when I connect the AC adapter the blue LED on the connector suddenly turns off. I can't power on my Dell by using only the battery. If you find the solution (or problem), please comment. 

PD: Pressing the power button by 30 seconds doesn't work. The AC adpater works fine. I suspect maybe the AO4407A IC are the ones that should be replaced.

Thanks.
