Gay Hollywood producers Derrick (Peter Szeliga) and Collin (Bruce L. Hart) have a new houseguest - and he's more trouble than they know. Because friendly, innocent Shawn (Dylan Vox, The Lair) is really ex-con Boyd, an actor they fired from their hit TV series when the network wanted someone more attractive. Fresh out of prison, Boyd is newly buff, hot and sexy, and ready to dump his trashy girlfriend, Sheila (Rebekah Kochan, Eating Out 1-3), and dive headfirst into every guy's pants on his way to stardom. Hell-bent on starring in Derrick and Collin's brand new TV show, Boyd will stop at nothing. Seduction, blackmail, manipulation, and sexual trysts this boy's a one-man wrecking crew. All's fair in showbiz!
