This "tranquilizing" album is a joy IMO.  At least one critic was not thrilled.



Here are 12 duets by 2 very expressive musicians plucking a total of 10 strings

in pleasant ways and at the "proper"* times.  In so doing they create ethereal

moods.  I enjoy this as much as HANCOCK/SHORTER 1+1....very good company


The original album has 13 tracks but #13 had physical defects.  #12 provides

as good an ending.  An option is to buy the CD and then hear the intended

concluding track.  Both musicians are from Missouri (USA) hence the title.


To increase further the strangeness I've included (2) low quality photos.

(#1)an unflattering pic of the duo and(#2)a pic of the jewel case/back cover with

scratch marks to indicate my favorite tracks. 



*the word PROPER is really not proper in this context; could "proper" music

 be any good?  I'm thinking improper music would be a better choice most of the 

 time....less predictable.
