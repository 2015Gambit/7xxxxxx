Maigret Jnr - Sick Friends EP

> If you like it, buy it !

The title track from the debut EP from Ru Davies, AKA Maigret Jnr. [Soundcloud], features a bouncy bassline, an R&B backbeat, effective use of a string section and some almost tropical-sounding guitar rearing its head mid-way through the song, which lasts all of six minutes. To top it all off, we have DaviesΓÇÖs portentous baritone and bleak lyrical outlook (heΓÇÖs not just drawing comparisons to Leonard Cohen for his voice, you know), as well as one of the most arresting opening lines weΓÇÖve heard all year: ΓÇÿThereΓÇÖs friends of mine who are trying to get better, but itΓÇÖs a waste of time in this kind of weatherΓÇÖ. Things get even gloomier from there, but the contrast between the delivery of the lyrics and the music that surrounds it could not be more marked, and itΓÇÖs this contrast, not to mention the melange of styles that Davies throws together, that make Sick Friends one of the most compelling debuts of the year.
