,rudown78,2012-12-03T13:50Z,^what's your problem?
[T],rjordan21,2012-12-03T14:07Z,^ no problem at all but uploading duplicate files only serves to dilute the seed pool.
,rudown78,2012-12-03T15:02Z,^Can you explain to me how it dilutes the seed pool?
,piratebuddha,2012-12-03T17:22Z,"It dilutes the seed pool because instead of everyone seeding one torrent, 50% will seed one and the other 50% will seed another, and so instead of all 100% seeding the same torrent, the seed pool is diluted.

Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate you sharing this with us, you upload a lot of awesome stuff, but this really does do more damage than good in the long run."

Please seed. Thx for the effort."
