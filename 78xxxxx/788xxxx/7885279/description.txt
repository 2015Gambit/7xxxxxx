When a bearded, rotund man in a red Santa
suit with an ID reading Kris Kringle falls
from the sky in Central Park, Castle and
Beckett are on the hunt to find the person
who killed Santa. But everything isn't

may have been more naughty than nice
Meanwhile, Castle and Beckett prepare for
their first Christmas together
