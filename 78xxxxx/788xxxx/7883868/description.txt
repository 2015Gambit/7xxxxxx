Paul Richard was the husband of Mirra Alfassa (aka The Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram). The Lord of the Nations is, according to Sri Aurobindo, a disincarnate demonic force bent on Global hegemony. According to them, The Mother's ex was channeling this entity -- and later, so was Hitler. According to the stories, Sri Aurobindo impersonated this entity on the inner planes and told Hitler to invade Russia -- leading eventually to the defeat of the German army. Anyway, this book might be of interest to people familiar with Sri Aurobindo and The Mother.
