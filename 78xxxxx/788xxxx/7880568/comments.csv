I don't see anything strange in it. Feel free to scan it though. "

Potential downloaders for this or any of your ""mega pack"" torrents should know there's a lot here for everyone -- the ""Christianity"" label should be interpreted loosely, since there are books on history, atheism, and other subjects, written from various perspectives, though the majority are Christian books from the neo-Calvinist perspective."
[T],spanikopita,2012-12-03T00:32Z,I tried to include some from a number of perspectives. There should be enough here to offend everyone. :)
,nedand,2012-12-03T01:27Z,Thank you very much!
