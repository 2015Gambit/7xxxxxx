,m3nt4t,2012-12-03T11:49Z,"Man, this is a very bad ""720p HDTV"" encoding, it looks like 480p upscaled to look like HD 720p. Look at the 480p encoding of Homeland episodes and compare it to this supposed 720p. It's the same, I notice little difference, and those files are 1/3 the size of these TWD episodes!"
,Jorfnar,2012-12-03T12:48Z,"@m3nt4t

you might want to get a better computer, or maybe realize that the show broadcasts that way."
,7thWonder,2012-12-03T14:39Z,"@Jorfnar @m3nt4t - you guys are both incorrect. if you have a modern cable company, usually they have a premium tv section where you get the 720p broadcast of the same show (since everyone has a 1070p tv now a days)... so maybe @eztv rips from the 720p broadcast? "
,Mersipp,2012-12-03T15:26Z,Great! Thank you so much eztv!

,Rich-Rock,2012-12-04T01:35Z,"@eztv 
THANKS!!!"
,arkoth0,2012-12-04T02:24Z,"People complaining about lack of speed on a ""newborn"" torrent.
*facepalm*

About the 720p being crap. I'm almost sure it isn't eztv fault. More like the broadcast is crap, at least the ones they are using to rip.
But I agree if that is a better quality being aired then they should try that one."
