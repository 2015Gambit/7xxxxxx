Lee Mack Ritenour (b 1952) blew me away with the title track CAPTAIN FINGERS

(his nickname) when I first heard it on the radio in the 70's.



Today this music sounds more than a little dated, but there are several high

points, particularly the soothing DOLPHIN DREAMS and the nasty guitar licks

throughout ISN'T SHE LOVELY.



Best of all is the cover art which depicts Lee's Gibson ES-335 with whaleboats

in pursuit.  (1) 1/4" plug has already "harpooned" the "leviathan."



Lee's first album FIRST COURSE is even better IMO but I haven't it on CD.
