Still Game Christmas Special - Plum Number
First broadcast: 23 Dec 2007
BBC

Once Isa finds out Jack and Victor have joined
the Community Choir, everyone's laughing in
Craiglang. They regain some respect by digging
out their marigolds to save the day for the choir
but, as ever, life is never straightforward.
Winston, meanwhile, gains some of the Christmas
spirit when he takes over from Charlie the
Lollipop Man. Tam develops a close, loving
relationship with the puggy machine, setting his
sights on winning the jackpot.
