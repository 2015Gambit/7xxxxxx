Sci-fi Fantasy, by B. Cameron Lee
Electric Goanna Dreams

2018. Its coming. Imagine an Australia with DNA matched identity cards, secret Government Agencies and a large secret police force. What freedom? Alan and Wade's computer lab is taken by the Government for a nominal fee after brother Wade is mysteriously killed. Frightened, Alan runs to his aboriginal friend, Jamie, in the Northern Territory and lives with the tribe in peace until the Gov. comes looking for him.
Wade's daughter, Sidhe, carries on his research for the Gov. and eventually has the first bio-organic implant inserted into her brain.
