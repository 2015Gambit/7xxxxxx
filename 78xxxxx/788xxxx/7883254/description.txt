Three goof balls (Marc Stevens, Mary Stuart and Ashley Moore), kidnap billionaire Hugh Howard's daughter from Chicago and head for Des Moines (or wherever), planning on a 7 figure ransom. This is all an excuse for lots of hardcore, strictly outdoor sex. After driving around with hostage Martha (played by an unidentified actress), tying her up and seeking assistance in a nearby farmhouse, the stupid bunch never gets through to daddy with the ransom call. The movie ends abruptly in the middle of one of Stevens' several unfunny phone conversations (we hear only his side), unable to get the billionaire on the line.
