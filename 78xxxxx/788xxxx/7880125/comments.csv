DD at 640kpbs is great too. "
,i.me.myself,2012-12-02T21:34Z,"thanks murdoc for the description. I was about to write comment that I have downloaded 3-4 full hd rips but all are having same issue/release that some frames are full hd and some frames are not, so was wondering if it is all from one source only or rest every BD source have same problem.

[T],murdoc47,2012-12-03T06:19Z,"i'm sorry phenom, i consider requests, i don't want to be the bad guy here, but i don't like the lotr trilogy. it would be a great deal for me to get the whole thing on BD (about 120gigs), and rip each one (takes a lot of time for 1080p!), just for me to delete them after... if it's any consolation, the extended versions are a bit too long to rip them in good quality at this size. but keep downloading and i'll try to do my best!"
