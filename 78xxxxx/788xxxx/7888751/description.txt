I have a quite odd fetish - I want my dick to be fucked in the urethra (it sounds weird, yeah), but as my urethra is non-lengthened it's near impossible to do without a trauma. Though I rather like girls than boys, I've wanted a dick into my dick for 5 yrs, lol. Once it dawned upon me that I'd got a similar effect by the means of a live fleshy worm as its body is like a single muscle. Then I began googling and discovered that there're very few people who push living creatures into their urethrae, at best they insert vibrating rods.

So I decided to improve the situation, lol. I provided myself with a periurethral antiseptic and 4 worms (I digged them up in the village, put into a bag with earth and got to home). But then there was a sequence of failures.

To avoid urethritis I treated my glans and urethra with the antiseptic. But unexpectedly I failed my first attempts to insert a worm as he twisted as if stung, also it turned out my antiseptic was smth like an acid to worms. Only thing crossed my mind was to use sunflower oil - that's was all I had at hand, also the worm normally reacted to it. Having sprinkled oil from the syringe I stained my glans and got it slick so it became difficult to handle my head - I couldn't widen my urethra hole to "help" the worm to crawl into. Also the worm constantly refused to go in, I suppose it bewared of warmth of my dick. As my dick was slippery and the worm didn't obey I wasted a lot of time trying to get it into my urethra.
