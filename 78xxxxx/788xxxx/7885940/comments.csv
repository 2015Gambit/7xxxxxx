Best episode ever!!! Is there a 720p version?"
,Donnaeli,2012-12-04T19:57Z,Hello Rkstr!  I have so very much appreciated all that you have done as far as uploading the Real Housewives episodes.  My husband and I gave up cable to save money and the ONLY thing I miss is all of the Real Housewives shows.  You have been a Godsend and I also just registered because I wanted to thank you for all of your work.  I realize you are going to take time off and I just wanted you to know that you are appreciated for all that you have done.  Thanks so much!

[T],rkstr,2012-12-05T01:10Z,@bhuzse  - if you want a 720p version I would suggest sourcing it yourself. Most people are grateful for this version that I upload for free in my own time
