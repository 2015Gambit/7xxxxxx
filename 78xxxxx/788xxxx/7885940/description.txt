Ep 5: Girls Gone OjaiΓÇÖld
The tension mounts after Brandi's outburst, but the gals try to make the best of their time in Ojai.
PREMIERE: Monday December 3, 9 pm

Still in Ojai, the women have a hard time understanding Lisa's defense of Brandi's language at the dinner table. Brandi and Taylor exchange angry words as well, but the group lightens up the following day, having fun in a golf cart race, at a mud-filled spa and, late at night, in a drunken gymnastics and arm-wrestling contest that is the opposite of ladylike. However, the problems between Brandi and Adrienne have just begun.
