5)  Bath and Wales 
We conjure a bit of magic when we visit the Georgian city of Bath and follow tales of Camelot into South Wales. In Bath, we marvel at ancient Roman spas and peek into the high society of Jane Austen's day. We stop by Wells to admire that city's spectacular cathedral, and we quest for the Holy Grail in the mystical town of Glastonbury. The poignant landscape of Wales' Wye River Valley offers a wealth of scenic riches. We investigate Caerleon's claim to King Arthur and explore a ruined abbey that inspired poet William Wordsworth.
