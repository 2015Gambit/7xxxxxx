If there is one thing that no computer user will ever be stuck for, it's a PDF application. From viewing to converting and creating to printing, there are literally hundreds of programs that claim to be the best for your needs.

Unfortunately for us, however, that's not always the truth. If you are still looking for the perfect all-round PDF suite, give Nitro PDF Professional a go. This comprehensive app claims to be the original contender to Adobe Acrobat, and it has to be said that it is a very good effort.

Whether you want to create, edit, view or combine, Nitro PDF Professional will let you do the job. It has pretty much every option you can think of, from in-built conversion tools (to Word, Excel, HTML, etc.), to advanced reviewing tools, the ability to create new PDF documents, advanced security features and even OCR (text recognition technology).

Nitro PDF Professional does differ from Acrobat, however, in several ways. Firstly, the Nitro PDF Professional interface boasts the trendy Office 2007 ribbon style, which makes it easy to use and attractive. Secondly, Nitro PDF Professional has more limited configuration options and settings than its Adobe cousin. Many users will actually see this as a plus, because only extremely advanced and frequent PDF users ever need the full range of options provided by Acrobat, and for the less dedicated, they can actually seem a little overwhelming.

Nitro PDF Professional is an impressively complete PDF creation and editing suite.
