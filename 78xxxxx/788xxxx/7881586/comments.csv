,watermelonseeds,2012-12-03T05:32Z,what the fuck is the password?
,MtnWalker,2012-12-03T05:55Z,Thanks. Can't wait to see what's going to happen.
,VDBP,2012-12-03T06:04Z,"@eztv
Thanx man your legend"
,dkamm65,2012-12-03T06:09Z,"@watermelonretard

There is no fucking password."
,NOS_4_Speed,2012-12-03T06:44Z,There is a PW. Anyone know what it is? And WTF is EZTV doing with a password protected torrent? The first time i've come around one with them. :(
,SystemFolder,2012-12-03T07:11Z,"You dummies. There is no password. Mkv files are not encrypted, DUH!"
,Froztiez,2012-12-03T07:25Z,"What the hell is the password, these surveys never work for me! What kinda sick asshole would put a survey on a torrent..."
,NOS_4_Speed,2012-12-03T07:37Z,@SystemFolder Then why does it ask for a password as i try opening it? 
,acsmith1972,2012-12-03T07:42Z,"There is indeed a password and a survey. I'm not sure why, it seems like an asshole move. "
,brazilian,2012-12-03T07:49Z,"These trollers are so sad with their posts about passwords.
Give it a rest fools."
,Fitzy727,2012-12-03T08:08Z,This is EZTV you clowns.  They are one of the most trusted uppers out there right now.  Not to mention that the file is also MKV so your attempt to make this file seem fake is FAR from hilarious.  Go do something productive instead of sitting on torrent sites trying to make people stop pirating.
,tetnem,2012-12-03T08:14Z,thanks!
,NOS_4_Speed,2012-12-03T08:32Z,W.E. so i went to another site and got the torrent. This one seems to be the only one protected
,TheTK13,2012-12-03T08:34Z,"Always with the ""retard"" and ""dummy."" If they're encountering a password, instead of insulting them until you're blue in the face, how about trying to tell them what to use to avoid a password prompt? The Internet doesn't have to be a warzone. Just try some courtesy."

,brazilian,2012-12-03T09:03Z,"Uhh that would be because there is no password you fucking retard/dummy/ Piece of shit TROLL! Is that clear enough for you ???

Look at the seeders fool! Another failed troll, SIGH."
,ryballs,2012-12-03T15:19Z,only a fuckwit would troll dexter..
,CrAcKeZ,2012-12-03T15:31Z,"The people who say that there's a password are stupid. Even before you finished the downloading of the file check what file type are you downloading?

Its an mkv a matroska that is(matroska is a container just like avi, mp4 and so on). Matroska container doesn't have the ""possibility"" to lock it with a password so stop saying BS.

It asks you for a password? download it again probably you downloaded another torrent or you have some virus."
,sweet1969,2012-12-03T15:49Z,"NO PASSWORD REQUIRED!!!!  IGNORE THE TROLLS!!!!!!!  EXCELLENT QUALITY AS ALWAYS!!

THANK YOU!!"
,Yuika,2012-12-03T17:37Z,"The people who are talking about passwords aren't necessarily trolls. I'm guessing that there are people who downloaded an earlier file that was named the same, minus the [eztv] and THAT one was a fake and required a password.

Relax guys. Give some people the benefit of the doubt. Simple mistake."
,VDBP,2012-12-03T17:43Z,"Hey guys for all you needing passwords i finally got it, The password is ReT@RD.
Wish i was a moderator i would BAN all of you"
[V],spastik64,2012-12-03T20:10Z,"Do NEVER trust ""fake, protected by password"" if torrent was uploaded by a VIP user as EZTV is.

They're just trollers ""I wannabe uploader""."
,sashu545,2012-12-03T21:51Z,"I happen to be one of the morons that have the password protected torrent, but in my case it turns out I didn't torrent this one but another one that came out yesterday at 10:18pm and claimed to be ""IMMERSE"". That torrent was shortly deleted afterwards, but I kept downloading it."
,lukoro,2012-12-03T22:24Z,Thanks EZTV as always great quality. There's no damn password fuckin' trolls.
