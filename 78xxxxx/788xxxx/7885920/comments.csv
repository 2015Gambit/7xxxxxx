,Scoop07,2012-12-05T02:59Z,"Hi Gary,

Thank you, thank you, thank you soooooo much for uploading the two live TOWIE episodes from the weekend!!

I can't wait to get home from work to download them!!! My night will be complete! It has been torture seeing all the feedback and reviews of the shows on social media this week and not be able to watch the shows live in Australia.

Wahoo thanks again!

Lianne "
