Drummer Shelly Manne operated a jazz club in Hollywood, CA where he often performed

with guest musicians.


For 2 nights in May of 1963 Bill Evan's (3rd trio) recorded tracks included on

this reissue at Shelly's club, the Manne-Hole.


It is Evans' only trio recording with LA studio drummer Larry Bunker.




"More than any other recording that I have made with Bill Evans, this one has

a quality of "Surprise! You're on Candid Camera."   ............................


.............bassist Chuck Israels



FYI:   Candid Camera was an occasionally hilarious 1960's show in the US which 

staged provocative situations and then filmed the reactions of unsuspecting 

passers-by with a hidden camera.
