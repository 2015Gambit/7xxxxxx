,Homeoplasmine,2012-11-23T10:17Z,"Sorry to ask here but does anyone know what happened to the other torrent for this release? I cant find it anymore on tpb, I was going to read thru the comments..."
,husksolow,2012-11-23T10:29Z,"@Homeoplasmine I was looking for it too, since I just tried to install it, there was no crack & I got an error message...downloading this one now instead"
,Homeoplasmine,2012-11-23T10:58Z,There is a crack on it... maybe we are not talking about the same one. I think mine was uploaded by HeroMaster or TheNoobish.
,Piecu,2012-11-23T16:18Z,Thanks Perfect Working!
,seanharm,2012-11-23T17:46Z,Been waiting for this one. Can't wait to play! Thanks!
,Yorgal,2012-11-23T18:07Z,"How it work exactly  , im dowloading actually the torrent but it download only one file and its not an iso . "
,seevee1969,2012-11-23T18:20Z,Just curious - why does this one not have a crack like Heromaster's ?
,Sgt.Dude,2012-11-23T19:36Z,I've been waiting for so long :D
,SSJASON,2012-11-23T21:18Z,the way azaq posts games is a exe that does the crack for us most of the time. Always good releases.
[V],azaq318,2012-11-23T22:25Z,"seevee1969
Crack here was pre-installed. So it's already cracked full game. Just run setup.exe after you finish downloading the game."
,Enpremi,2012-11-23T22:53Z,"but azaq, but when instal the repack and want to play it, it says that it cant find rld.dll!"
,grucha19,2012-11-24T01:53Z,"""the dynamic library rld.dll failed to initialize (e408)"" 
THIS IS MY PROBLEM i can't play how fix this  "
,grucha19,2012-11-24T02:07Z,pls help
,Kresler,2012-11-24T07:27Z,"@grucha19
Your anti virus might have blocked it. I got a false positive with MSE that wouldn't let me launch the game. Just made the file trusted and now it works fine."
[V],azaq318,2012-11-24T09:17Z,"Enpremi

Kresler is right. You AV killed Reloaded crack. "
,Enpremi,2012-11-24T11:35Z,"Only AV I have is microsoft windows essentials ,but i dont know how to make it, that I will not block the file."
,grucha19,2012-11-24T12:32Z,I dont have any AV 
,sorry_gregory,2012-11-24T14:11Z,"Don't download, trojan."
,yopyop42,2012-11-24T18:25Z,mind uploading just the crack i dont want to download it again....rld gives me file is missing error
,Green.Lantern,2012-11-24T18:38Z,same rld.dll error
,Green.Lantern,2012-11-24T18:48Z,"PLEASE UPLOAD THE RLD.DLL FILE
SO THAT WE MAY REPLACE IT"
,Shoobox,2012-11-24T19:31Z,"the game did not install all ready cracked as people stated!
when trying to run the supposedly pre cracked .exe it asked for CD. when taking the crack from ISO and trying to past crack in the directory and launched, task manager comes up as a problem, it has nothing to do with the antivirus blocking it. tested on three different machines with no anti installed.

conclusion-Failed attempt at fake reloaded game.
reloaded always has his ISO files labeled this ISO does not.
I will be waiting for my great family from the TeamTPTB to post their copied crack version that works."
[V],azaq318,2012-11-24T22:08Z,"This version is working, you lie about 3 different machines - i'm sure about it. Cause I tested this game myself."
[V],azaq318,2012-11-24T22:21Z,"GUYS with RLD.dll error.
Please download crack here:

,Shoobox,2012-11-24T22:25Z," I beg to differ.
has been tested on three different machines with no anti vrus, no UAC setting, no fire wall."

so who's the one lying, lmao busted!"
[V],azaq318,2012-11-24T23:03Z,"And i'm stick to these words :) Game is pre-cracked, and it's working fine for thousands of people ) But not for you. And it will never work for you. You have bad karma. I'm tired of you by the way. And i'm done talking with you. You have 0 uploads here - you only take. Have a nice life."
,Shoobox,2012-11-24T23:21Z,"@azaq318 

lol what a goomba, it doesn't work,
its not pre-cracked, you have shown no proof it does work, and yes i have 0 uploads moron, because a seed valid torrents ,i do not steel reloaded and skidrow torrents and take them as my own.
have a nice day, smile you've been bitch smacked."
,Green.Lantern,2012-11-25T02:30Z,"for those having problemss
Run the exe on windows xp service pack 3 and it works

I am stuck at the level with the tree monster though
cant find a fix for that

can someone say whether they got past that part?"
,panchus,2012-11-25T04:28Z,Just add to exceptions in the AV program the game directory
,DiegoKermit,2012-11-25T05:25Z,"can't install... when I click the ""install"" button, it says that an error terminated the installation..."
,Megatox20,2012-11-25T12:12Z,Shoobox and other idiots who think the game doesnt work ITS WORKING i have eset and i added exception for rld.dll and the game is working perfect. So just disable your AV or add an exception and play stop spamming!
,vazto,2012-11-25T15:44Z,"@DiegoKermit 

I have the same problem and cant find a way to solve it i think were the only ones with the error."

,Shoobox,2012-11-25T16:36Z,"@Megatox20 
I think my friend your the idiot, its always little brats like you that resort to name calling, well good for you but since you do not read threads and jump to conclusions you must of missed several parts of sex ed class as well and think you pussy is a dick.

i clearly stated it was tested  on 3 different machines without av so read first next time you fuckn juicebox kid."
,Megatox20,2012-11-25T18:37Z,Shoobox fucking 10 year old I am a 25 year old who is a pro informatic and i installed this game to my son in 5 minutes so if you tested on 3 machines you fucking moron and it didnt worked who gives  FUCK?????? It worked for me so fuck you moron and go lick your mommas pussy instead of playing lego game kid and Im glad that it doesnt work for fucker like you MOTHERFUCKER who doesnt know how to install a simple lego game that doesnt need cracking. WELL DONE IDIOT! my son is enjoying and maybe you kid should ask someone older to install this game for you because i think that its too complicated for 10 year old dick sucker like you! OWNED BITCH
,XxHABlOSxX,2012-11-25T19:43Z,works great but the voices... i cant hear them. only background voices from the characters. not the main ones. is there a fix for that. :D
,biteme1011,2012-11-26T01:15Z,"FYI, I have tried everything Dude! I disabled my AV, disabled my firewall, turned UAC on and off, re-downloaded the rld.dll file and re-installed, and I downloaded the crack that azaq318 uploaded and installed that. All of this did not work! I still get that dynamic library rld.dll failed to initialize error! I even tried every entry on the compatibility list and ran it as administrator! Nothing works! I, for the record, am not blaming azaq318 for this because I am sure it is not his fault. This torrent does work for a lot of people. I just wish someone would figure out and upload a fix for this problem that quite a few people are experiencing. I have been downloading and installing these cracked games for years and from a lot of different uploaders such as reloaded, blackbox, razor1911, skidrow, globe, flt, vitality, rg catalyst, nosTEAM, and yes azaq318 and I have never had this type of problem! Someone must be able to fix this error! I have faith in the talent out there."
,fatleo321,2012-11-26T06:44Z,"@biteme1011

Have you tried renaming the Game folder to just LEGO with no funny characters like TM or copyright etc.

Worked for me when i changed the folder to no symbols"
,Kartisem,2012-11-26T09:59Z,"works excellent! Just check this:
-Before INSTALLING, deactivate your ANTIVIRUS cause it keeps deleting the "".dll"" files from the destination directory! 
-If you already lost the "".dll"" files,download the crack from here,and ALSO have ANTIVIRUS DEACTIVATED cause it will delete it from the download (that's why many claim that ""there is no ""rld.dll"" file!)
Do this and the game plays like a charm!!!! 
KEEP CALM and Crack on!"

Yawn, 
   oh I'm sorry, must of been sleeping through your bullshit.

,Dr.D.,2012-11-27T08:49Z,"If you want to change the language to something other than english, you have to change the registry, just edit the ""LanguageVal"" in ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWarner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentLEGOLOTR"" or ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWoW6432NodeWarner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentLEGOLOTR"" (64bit) to the appropriate value for the desired language: 1030 = danish; 1031 = german; 1034 =  spanish (not sure about that one); 1036 = french; 1040 = italian. Those are all in decimal, so watch out for that, also those are the ones from lego indiana jones, so they may not be the same, but I can at least confirm the german one as working.

On another note, for all laptop users with nvidia optimus technology: Optimus may not recognize Lego LOTR, so it will not use your dedicated gpu unless you tell it to, watch out for that."

,MonsterBoXX,2012-11-27T11:27Z,I have installed the game with no problems and it works fine... but I have not figured out how to change language... no options to my knowledge during install.. gives me 3 shortcuts... 1 to play and seems 2 others that are tied to language that do a small CMD prompt fix.. but don't give options and language doesn't seem to be English other than some things in ()... any help please... thank you

,mizery01,2012-11-30T04:19Z,"Hi there, thanks azaq for the upload. I got the game working. I just had to download the crack again because my AV was blocking it. Now I have the game up and working. But do you have to use JUST the keyboard to play this game? For some reason I cannot use my mouse in this game at all. Is that how this game is, or is that a problem? It wants me to use WASD to move and H to attack. That seems odd. I'd really like to be able to use my mouse. Anyone else having this problem? Any help appreciated!"
,Tecness3,2012-11-30T05:18Z,"@mizery01 Have you never played a lego game before? That's how you normally play one...

Also, Shoobox, you're a dumbass. If you truly did try this on three different COMPUTERS, then chances are, it should have worked. If it didn't, then there are two possibilities. Either, you fucked something up in the process of installing it, 3 times, or you fucked up your computer. Either way, you fucked up. 

Game works beautifully for me. Windows 7, x64."

ZZZZzzzZZZZZ YAWN,

I've been doing this long enough to know what I'm doing.I've, I didn't fuck anything up Moron

,niko997,2012-11-30T15:36Z,i cant get this to work i open the game and it stops working
,renoraider,2012-12-02T06:43Z,I'm bumping fatleo321's solution. Just remove any special symbols like the trademark or copyright signs.
,asdfmxx,2012-12-02T07:28Z,Just wanted to confirm that fatleo321's solution works. Rename the folder without (c) or tm symbols and add the folder to your AV exception list for the game to work as normal. (Problem seems to happen most often on Win 7 64 bit.)

,oldmanbluntz,2012-12-02T18:44Z,"and @shoobox, why don't you try restarting the torrent and have it go to where its already downloaded, have it recheck the files and make sure it completly downloaded. maybe your torrent program missed a piece. its working for so many people. but there are a few it is not working for, like yourself. if its not your setupps, like you claim, maybe its the original files. try everything before jumping to conclusions that it doesn;t work, its not pre-cracked, etc. it is precracked, and works fine."
,ptv83,2012-12-02T20:52Z,"game installed easy, plays fine.. but has bugs. cannot progress past pelloner(sp?) fields .. where eowyn and merry vs the with king.. the damned with king is running in place on his saddle.. he's not attacking as shown in the youtube video walkthrough.  at the same time switching over to frodo and sam's mission escaping the tower, progresses fine until the door that must find the armor to wear the disguise, light a fire and pull down the pieces to build the catapult, jump in the catapult, but then can't do anything, the catapult wont fire as shown in the youtube video walkthrough.... can't do either mission .. stuck at a standstill, tried exiting and re-entering mission several times, starting missions from the start all over again.  these are permanent bugs preventing any further progress in the game.

if anyone can progress past these bugs, or has the same bugs.. PLEASE REPLY.

(another bug happened when freeing theodin from the grasp of soromon, gandalf got stuck in a cage and the mission had to be restarted once)

i will cross my fingers and restart my computer to see if that fixes it..."
