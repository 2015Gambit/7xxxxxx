1.Keys only work with Avira Internet Security 2013/12 (Formerly, Avira Premium Security Suite)
Download Link... 
http://www.avira.com/en/for-home-avira-internet-security (Of-course click on Try...)

2.Windows 8 is NOT Officially Compatible with AIS but Latest Version i.e 13.0.0.2761 is working fine(Tested my self)

3.It is RECOMMENDED to perform a CLEAN installation of AIS from the above link and during the installation(Not Recommended) uncheck "AHead"(To make Scanning Faster i.e No false-positive), "Web Protection" and "Mail Protection"(to Enhance your internet Browsing/Downloading speed)

4.To Prolong Activation Period, u must update your Avira Product manually(its for "PRODUCT UPDATES", "Virus Definition Update" has nothing to do with it).
Open Avira, Extras--> Configuration--> Expand update--> Product update and click "Notify user when new product are available". At Below, you must enter at least 3 days or more because if you update regularly, your product key will be expired or being blacklisted soon.
