,hackerps3,2012-11-27T20:53Z,"A/V? Anything,instead of bitching about it why don't you give us an audio and video rating on this clip. Who care's where it came from. If you don't like it go pay for it and see it in theaters! This is what torrent sites are for duh!"
,hackerps3,2012-11-27T21:46Z,"OK guys, V/5 A/4, personally I don't care where the film copy comes from, this is the only copy available everywhere on the internet, I've checked around quite a few places. People need to grow up and quit getting their panties in a bunch about where the video came from. Be glad you can get the video here,that's what torrents are for,otherwise, go pay for it and see it in theaters!! "
