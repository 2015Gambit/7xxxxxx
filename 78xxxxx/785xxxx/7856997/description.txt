PRIMITIVE LOVE -- IMDb info http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057844/combined 
Meet the horrible Italian comedy team of Franco Franchi and Ciccio Ingrassia, moronic bellhops who ogle and leer through keyholes and airvents while Jayne the Anthropologist shows racy mondo films to a colleague in her swank hotel room.

WILD, WILD WORLD OF JAYNE MANSFIELD -- Jayne's trip to Europe, her lust for fame and recognition, and her grieving family are immortalized in this posthumously released memorial gesture.

Two truly tasteless features. The torrent includes the trailer for "Primitive Love."
