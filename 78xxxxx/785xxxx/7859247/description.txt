Star Control 3 is the last installment of the series. Taking a slightly different track that diverged from the Star Control 2 formula, it got excellent reviews though some of the hardcore Star Control fans weren't entirely thrilled by the innovations. Journalists, new fans of the series, and hardcore fans alike all agreed on one thing, though: this game's story is great.

So whether you're an old fan of the series, someone who was put off by a friend's dislike of the game, or someone who's never played the Star Control games at all, here's your chance: pick up the excellent final game in the Star Control series and make up your mind for yourself!
