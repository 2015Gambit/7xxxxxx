Daffy Sheldon Duck is an animated cartoon character produced by Warner Bros. He has
appeared in cartoon series such as Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, where he usually
has been depicted as the best friend and occasional arch-rival of Bugs Bunny. Daffy
was one of the first of the new 'screwball' characters that emerged in the late 1930s
to replace traditional everyman characters who were more popular earlier in the decade,
such as Mickey Mouse and Popeye. Daffy starred in 133 shorts in the Golden Age, making
him the third-most frequent character in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons,
behind Bugs Bunny's 166 appearances and Porky Pig's 159 appearances.
Daffy was #14 on TV Guide's list of top 50 best cartoon characters and was featured
on one of the issue's four covers as Duck Dodgers with Porky Pig and the Powerpuff Girls
(all of which are Time Warner-owned characters).
