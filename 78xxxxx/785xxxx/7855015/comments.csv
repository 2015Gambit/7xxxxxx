[V],psspss,2012-11-25T04:58Z,"yes theres some interesting bits in this collection

that antarctic one does sort of look like a row of tanks looking at the shadows but the guns are angeled away from the round object

its more likely they defending the russians or other nations from getting close or taking the object in the snow

UFO?
