,Alikhat,2012-11-25T05:38Z,This and helder1965's episode 6 are bad files that do not play correctly. Sound and no image.
[T],helder1965,2012-11-25T11:01Z,"Alikhat, it is working here and for thousand of others pals. Maybe you are facing some specific problem of codec or player! PS: anyway, you still can search and test to play the larger release base 1080p-XAN in other places! Thanks and good luck!"
,upx3,2012-11-25T17:07Z,"Seems to play OK on KMP, but not with VLC or on my WDTV"
[T],helder1965,2012-11-25T19:40Z,"Here, it plays fine on VLC, but I will check all x264 video encoder settings and parameters! Maybe I can figure out if there is something different from old ""h65"" releases. Thanks for your support."
[T],helder1965,2012-11-25T21:57Z,"Sent a REPACK release fixing a error of x264 codec parameter that could cause missing of video in some players!
Accept my apologies, please!"
,stephen6789,2012-11-26T01:35Z,.mkv??  really?  Upload in a real video format and maybe we wouldn't have these probs.  I had to convert it and still got no sound.
