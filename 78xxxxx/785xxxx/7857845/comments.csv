,fartboytpb,2012-11-25T20:52Z,Thanks bro. I'd rather watch LQ than nothing at all.
[T],burgundyranger,2012-11-25T21:44Z,No problem. Will try to make same make-do arrangements if/when an encode of episode 18 becomes available.
,Mistyestep2011,2012-11-27T05:49Z,I got episode 18 evil reborn off of itunes for $2.99 and i already paid $3.00 for it.
,jchen9999,2012-11-29T08:17Z,please upload episode 18
[T],burgundyranger,2012-11-29T16:17Z,"To repeat, I DO NOT HAVE episode 18. Dekabroken has relayed he could be 7-10 days away from being able to resume encoding.

If he's that close, I'm going to wait. "
