Keep up the stellar work!"
,noekk,2012-11-23T04:22Z,"Does this work on Win 8 ?

Do I have to have Steam installed ?"
,ALoafPincher,2012-11-23T15:28Z,Thank you! Works perfectly.
,Whitebb,2012-11-23T15:43Z,"Got it, the LAN crash caused by the Skidrow patch 1.2.2 crack content, to fix it install Skidrow patch 1.2.2 and DLC's patch, then install the crack content from previous patch 1.2.2 (not for skidrow)
Skidrow please release new crack for 1.2.2."
,googleLT,2012-11-23T19:19Z,HELP!!! where find Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage DLC ??? in game
,bundolog,2012-11-23T22:20Z,"@Whitebb
Same here, it crashes when selecting LAN. Still trying to find how to fix this. Post from what torrent you got it to work."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-23T23:19Z,"@googleLT
Go to any fast-travel station and there is a new area you can go to. I do not remember the name, but this is the same way *ALL* DLC for Borderlands and Borderlands 2 has worked. (Excluding the mecromancer DLC unlocking a new character type obviously, but even that had a new zone to go to.)

You will recognize the crazy name. :)"
,googleLT,2012-11-24T07:19Z,"thanks OmniNegro , but on fast travel dont exist this carnage , 5. Copy the cracked content from the update and into the main install
folder and overwrite , i dont do this "
,googleLT,2012-11-24T07:25Z,"they say copy the cracked content , but where is it?i got 5 files , 1 info 2 install 3 bin1c 4 bin1a 5 bin1b , so where i cant find crack?"
,samengo,2012-11-24T08:05Z,Is this MULTI-6?
,OmniNegro,2012-11-24T10:05Z,"@googleLT
The cracked content is the 1.22 update cracked content. Just copy the stuff over again. Do not worry about if it asks you to overwrite, just do it and it should work.

,Vosur,2012-11-24T13:03Z,"@Whitebb Just use the update from P2P. LAN multiplayer works fine with it.

,lilok2,2012-11-24T21:43Z,can someone tell me with what software to open those bin files pls
,OmniNegro,2012-11-25T04:31Z,"@lilok2
Just use Borderlands.2.Mr.Torgues.Campaign.of.Carnage.DLC.exe and it will ask where to install to. It is safe."

,zeroeight,2012-11-25T23:14Z,"This doesn't work, game will not launch."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-26T04:14Z,"@Ciechan

While you may be telling the truth and trying to help, I for one do not know you, and have not seen a ""Skidrom Crackfix"" for this as with other releases in the past. Frankly I suspect this is a trojan. I advise extreme caution to all out there until this is an official crackfix, and the MD5 of the files can be verified.

If I am just being paranoid, then I apologize and thank you for the help. If not, well you already know what to do with yourself. :)

,samengo,2012-11-27T17:42Z,"Thanks,awesome torrent as always"
,reeferwarrior420,2012-11-27T22:04Z,"So do we install this, THEN install the v1.2.2 update? Or the update then this? BTW I am updating from the Skidrow update 6 that i used after installing the pirate DLC. Thanks for any help."
,Vosur,2012-11-28T01:08Z,@reeferwarrior420 The instructions are right in the description.
,Nanbu,2012-11-28T15:13Z,"Can someone please tell me where to replace the 3 ""Borderlands.2.Mr.Torgues.Campaign.of.Carnage"" files. I don't see them in my Borderlands folder and tried searching with no success."
,Nanbu,2012-11-28T17:37Z,"Also, is there a way to fix the LAN issue? I appreciate any input."
,pntbll4u,2012-11-28T23:57Z,"Can anyone help? I've never had any problems with any Skidrow torrents, but this one will not open for me.  When I click the launcher, then click ""play"" nothing happens
Help!
thanks!"
,pntbll4u,2012-11-29T00:02Z,"wait, user error. Works great!
thanks!"
,Nanbu,2012-11-29T02:01Z,"@pntbll4u: it happened to me too, but it got resolved after installing Steam (not necessary to log in)"
,psylotic1,2012-11-29T10:32Z,"I own Borderlands 2 on steam, will this work with that? Can i somehow just add it to my steam install?"
,zeroeight,2012-12-01T16:32Z,"I have gone through every single upload of the game, the 1.2.2 update, and DLC, from every frigging site I can possible find (Easily over 25 sites) and not one of them work in any combination.

Every single one of these starts the game then goes dead.

I'm sick and tired of people leaving comments saying this works fine when it doesn't work at all"
,Vosur,2012-12-01T22:29Z,@zeroeight It actually does work for thousands of people. Do you think I hallucinated when I played the entire DLC? Do you even have Steam installed?
,Fatal9099,2012-12-02T02:56Z,"Was having the problem with the game not loading after selecting play, but Steam fixed the issue, just load it up, add Borderlands 2 to your games, and launch it from Steam. It may not make sense but it does work!"
,Violentos,2012-12-02T09:32Z,"It says to install the .exe file, but there isn't one... I searched through everything! I got the first DLC (Scarlette's Booty) working just fine, but it came with an .exe file."
,zeroeight,2012-12-02T17:57Z,"To anyone reading this,

Anyone that says you need Steam installed, is a fucking idiot the purpose of a crack is so that you don't require steam to even be on your computer.

Also the following files ARE NOT NEEDED:
Name Changer
Language Changer
B2Launcher.exe

This is the actual problem no one seems to be paying attention to:

Once you install any 1.2.2 update YOU WILL NEVER EVER BE ABLE TO LAUNCH THE GAME BECAUSE, The fucking idiots that uploaded the 1.2.2 update DID NOT INCLUDE THE cracked 1.2.2 borderlands2.exe file that is needed in order to launch the game. So until an actual 1.2.2 borderlands2.exe has been made and uploaded, then it doesn't matter what you try to use, the game will never ever launch.

This is proven by comparing the size of original cracked borderlands2.exe to the one in the update you will see that the Original borderlands2.exe is only 25.3MB in size and the one in the update is 33.7MB

So someone needs to get their head out of their ass. "
