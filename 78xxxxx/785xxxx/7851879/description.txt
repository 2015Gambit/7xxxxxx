Ross Kemp: Extreme World Season 2
Ross Kemp travels to some of the most dangerous, lawless and violent regions on Earth, to show how international organised crime, terrorists and local criminal networks have created alliances that are destroying the lives of millions of people. Covering stories that are deemed too dangerous to tell, getting first-hand accounts from the victims of crime; he will join the police who are battling the criminals and will come face to face with the criminals themselves. In each episode Ross Kemp will hunt down, meet and challenge criminals who spread death and mayhem around our world through drug dealing, human trafficking, terrorism, and murder. From the violent slums of Karachi to the lawless prisons of Venezuela, Extreme World 2 takes Ross across five continents in search of the stories that rarely make the news yet affect the lives of millions.



6)  Glasgow 
The actor explores Glasgow, a bustling metropolis that boasts a thriving tourist industry and a winning bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, which also thought to have a homeless population of more than 10,000. In addition to learning about the supported accommodation scheme, he visits a private charity-run hostel - and asks if there is a danger that vulnerable people are cared for too much, to the point they take no responsibility for themselves at all. The statistics are shocking: in some areas of Glasgow, despite years of regeneration, unemployment is at 68 per cent, while life expectancy can be as low as 54. Kemp is slightly closer to home than usual, exploring the vicious cycle of poverty, homelessness and alcohol/ drug abuse that still blights the city. There are some good news stories: Kemp meets former chancers whose lives are being turned around with supported housing, but too many others are falling through the cracks of the welfare system. In a programme with its fair share of eye-watering moments, Kemp admits, "I'm as guilty as anyone else of turning a blind eye to the poverty in this country."
