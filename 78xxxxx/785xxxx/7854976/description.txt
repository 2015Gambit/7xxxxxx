Roger, Anita and their canine clan are packing for the big move to Dalmatian Plantation, a home in the country with plenty of room for the 101 pups and far from the clutches of Cruella DeVil. The feistiest pup, Patch, feels lost in a sea of spots and longs to be a one-of-a-kind wonderdog like his TV hero, Thunderbolt. While watching the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show while it&#x27;s filming in London. However, the family move will interfere with Patch&#x27;s opportunity - until he&#x27;s accidentally left behind in the commotion. Patch heads for the audition to meet his hero. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt&#x27;s &#x22;trusty&#x22; sidekick, Lightning, reveals that the producers of the show want to replace Thunderbolt with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself...
