Here it is -- the Big Bang of British Comedy in one beautiful box. 14 DVDs make up 45 episodes, i.e. the complete and entire Monty Python's Flying Circus television show, unadulterated and totally insane. Drawing cues from Lenny Bruce, Sid Caesar, and UK comedy paratroopers Beyond the Fringe, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam et. al. created a new comedy that was as curious and lateral as it was hysterical. It's ALL here, from SPAM to "Cheese," the Lumberjack Song to the Dead Parrot Sketch, the eye-spinning groundbreaking animation to special outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage . . . and so much more. Whether you're a hardcore fan or a new convert, this is the set to keep you laughing 'till kingdom come. This second iteration of the Monty Python Megaset adds two discs not included in the previous release: Monty Python Live!, previously available separately, offers vintage and more recent live performances by the troupe, including the 20-year celebration of Monty Python Parrot Sketch Not Included, and the all-German Monty PythonΓÇÖs Fligender Zirkus episode #1.
