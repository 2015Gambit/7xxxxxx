Agian... Russians are cool bananas. Although I should mention I haven't been able to test this since... Well, I dont own any computer with linux installed. So if it works tell me and if it dont... tell me. Also I have no idea what this includes, I only know it's 1.1.2. (Probably)

Description: (Quoted from Steam) 

"Long ago, the Dark Lord Dredmor was bound in the darkest dungeons beneath the earth by great and mighty heroes. Centuries later, the magical bonds that hold him in place are loosening and his power grows ever stronger. The land cries out for a new hero, a powerful warrior or a mystic wizard like those spoken of in the prophecies of yore."
