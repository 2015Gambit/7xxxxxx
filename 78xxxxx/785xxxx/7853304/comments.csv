error missing file"
,sgt_noobums,2012-11-24T19:19Z,"guys the reason you cant copy crack is because your antivirus just add an exception to it for the destination folder and the crack folder.  And btw for those who say it is a virus, you are wrong.  Hero would not have received a skull if he ever uploaded viruses."

,Yorgal,2012-11-25T03:36Z,"There is all language in , works perfectly , thanks ! "
,Houad,2012-11-25T12:57Z,"It works fine for me on win7 x64. I didn't have any trouble with my AV (avast). 
I'm not sure but I think there are all available languages (or at least the european ones), including spanish, french, german etc. You get to choose when the installer starts.

Sometimes the crack won't start and you get an error message ""rld.dll failed to initialise"". This is (at least on my computer) because a previously crashed process didn't close itself properly : you have to open the task manager and kill it (it's called LEGOLOTR.exe).

If you lost the crack it's available here (not tested but I suppose it's the same files) :

,bananaz4ever,2012-11-26T14:55Z,"Where is the game installed?
It's probably right in front of me. -_-
I did Easy Installation, no idea where it installed, have the crack ready to go."
,bananaz4ever,2012-11-26T15:01Z,"Found it. >.<
Word of the wise: read the ReadMe...
Installs to ProgramFiles(X86) or whatever, since there was no shortcut installed, I couldn't right click on the shortcut and go to ""File Location""..."
,djjewel2012,2012-11-26T15:47Z,"This is quite weird. I have succesfully installed it on an older PC. It was fine except the graphic lags.

On my PC (win 7 x64), I can't launch it, event though it has all the requirements. I have tried everything. Weird weird weird..."
,djjewel2012,2012-11-26T16:25Z,"even weirder is that the official demo from the site works like a charm, so it's not my computer I guess"
,uchimichi,2012-11-26T17:36Z,"Once installed and cracked and opened, the game opens up for a couple of seconds, the minimizes itself (like when there's some kind of video issue). I maximize it, it continues for 2-3 seconds, then minimizes again.. I made it to Options > Resolution, changed it, but with no luck. 
I tried with this crack, with another one from another source, changed compatibility mode, shutting down the 2nd monitor.. Video drivers updated. Win7 Ultimate 64bit..
Anybody got any ideas?"
,Runhash,2012-11-26T20:05Z,"At the end i get this :
""Unable to find dsetup.dll""
Then installation rollback's,and I can't install it !
Please help !"
,Runhash,2012-11-26T20:35Z,I fixed it ! :)
,Dr.D.,2012-11-27T08:51Z,"If you want to change the language to something other than english, you have to change the registry, just edit the ""LanguageVal"" in ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWarner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentLEGOLOTR"" or ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWoW6432NodeWarner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentLEGOLOTR"" (64bit) to the appropriate value for the desired language: 1030 = danish; 1031 = german; 1034 = spanish (not sure about that one); 1036 = french; 1040 = italian. Those are all in decimal, so watch out for that, also those are the ones from lego indiana jones, so they may not be the same, but I can at least confirm the german one as working.

On another note, for all laptop users with nvidia optimus technology: Optimus may not recognize Lego LOTR, so it will not use your dedicated gpu unless you tell it to, watch out for that."
,Dr.D.,2012-11-27T08:52Z,"@mycomment: that is to say, change the language after you already installed the game."

,asdfmxx,2012-12-02T07:24Z,"The (c) and tm characters in the folder path cause the ""rld.dll failed to initialize"" error that some people are getting. Renaming the folder to anything without those symbols and adding the folder to your AV exceptions list allows the game to run as normal."

,ptv83,2012-12-02T20:51Z,"game installed easy, plays fine.. but has bugs. cannot progress past pelloner(sp?) fields .. where eowyn and merry vs the with king.. the damned with king is running in place on his saddle.. he's not attacking as shown in the youtube video walkthrough.  at the same time switching over to frodo and sam's mission escaping the tower, progresses fine until the door that must find the armor to wear the disguise, light a fire and pull down the pieces to build the catapult, jump in the catapult, but then can't do anything, the catapult wont fire as shown in the youtube video walkthrough.... can't do either mission .. stuck at a standstill, tried exiting and re-entering mission several times, starting missions from the start all over again.  these are permanent bugs preventing any further progress in the game.

if anyone can progress past these bugs, or has the same bugs.. PLEASE REPLY.

(another bug happened when freeing theodin from the grasp of soromon, gandalf got stuck in a cage and the mission had to be restarted once)"
,ptv83,2012-12-02T21:00Z,"about previous answer.. after sifting through a million google hits of no-lifes possing their legos and taking pictures at home and filling the internet with them... (yeesh)  ... i found a post on xbox forums, the answer from travellers tales is that this is a known issue and you must exit the game.. some memory error or something.. 

i will cross my fingers and restart my computer to see if that fixes it...
