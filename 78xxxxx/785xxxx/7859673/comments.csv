,Postoasted,2012-11-26T02:43Z,This video switches to Vikes VS Bears at the 22 min mark.
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-26T02:53Z,You're sure? Because the ripper has labeled this like Viks-Bears. I haven't checked it yet.
,bunthom,2012-11-26T06:02Z,"I will check it when finished.

Just want to thank you for your dedication to upping these sports torrents.

Hope that you have the Giants game today and thanks for all that you for us"
,MrRager6,2012-11-26T07:25Z,So is this the complete Bears vs Vikes or not?
