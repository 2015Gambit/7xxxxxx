,ristopalazzo,2012-11-25T09:39Z,It should be good now. This is one of my favourite albums overall. The addition of the permanent keyboard player puts a bit of Deep Purple into the album and it works great. You'll really enjoy this one vintage_vinyl.
,vintage_vinyl,2012-11-25T13:13Z,"kool looking fwd to it and thank u for seeding....from the action on this one, it seems like you made alot of people happy out there with this album, love deep purple too and on the earlier opeth albums i really like the classical piano interludes so im certain the keys will add some great resonance to their already awesome sound.....this band is very original with their sound which i like whereas many other bands sound like one another there is nobody i can compare opeth too, which makes them very appealing to listen too, thanks again my friend,
