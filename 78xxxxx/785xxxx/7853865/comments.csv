A couple of years ago Ben Afflack was at the bottom of the Hollywood barrel, now he's venturing into the elite level director status. Who'd a thunk it. "
,waitesb,2012-11-29T13:04Z,"I've been seeding for 2 days now, and I'm only at 0.659 ratio... apparently people don't like free movies if there are hardcoded subs. Picky Picky!

A:9 (a little quite)
V:8 (because of the subs)"
,abeajde,2012-11-30T15:04Z,"Great movie, but I don't think that is worth watching it in this quality, I was searching and I found great copy (similar to dvd rip) at film.nearks.com and it worked great for me! Enjoy! "
,nycmon,2012-12-01T05:07Z,Decent quality video and bearable audio....chinese hardsubs hella annoying...and some english subs for the entire section with the housekeeper might be nice lmao....don't understand farsi and don't read chinese >_
