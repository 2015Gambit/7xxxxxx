Finally, after all this time, FRANK CHO gets off his lazy butt and collects his multi-award winning LIBERTY MEADOWS Sunday strips in one place. This book showcases the first three years of LIBERTY MEADOWS Sunday strips, fully re-mastered and digitally recolored. It also showcases never before seen comic strips and art since their initial newspaper publication. This is book 1 of 2. The second LIBERTY MEADOWS SUNDAY COLLECTION, collecting years 4-5 of LIBERTY MEADOWS Sunday strips, will be published in November.
