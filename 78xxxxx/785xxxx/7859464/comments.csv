[T],helder1965,2012-11-26T11:44Z,"Seanex, the first 2 (1080p-mp4) were introducing the original download from YT, my standards are 720p-MKV and SD-mp4 and I've released just 720p for all episodes of this series! You still can search for 1080p releases at will, they are direct download from YT."
,temporary2010,2012-11-27T09:34Z,"MKV has more options than MP4, but for this purpose, either are equivalent.  You can probably remux either formats back and forth easily enough.

I'm not sure why the uploader needed to re-encode the video, as the YouTube mp4 is already H.264.  You end up losing quality.  Re-mux, don't re-encode."
