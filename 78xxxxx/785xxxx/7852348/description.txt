This book presents an oasis of information on the world's starkest deserts. "Journey from Death Valley", the lowest point in North America, to the Libyan desert, the hottest on Earth, where temperatures can reach 136[degrees]F, to Antarctica's vast polar deserts, which have not had ice cover for thousands of years. From trade wind and rainshadow deserts to interior and coastal deserts, "Deserts" spotlights 10 superlative examples and reveals why these astonishing landforms are never static, but always changing. A dramatic, full-color photographic insert adds visual appeal to this compelling title.
