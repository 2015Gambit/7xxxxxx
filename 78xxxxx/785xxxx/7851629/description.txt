
South Park Season 1 Complete with Trey and Matt's Commentary

When Warner Brothers produced the South Park Season 1 DVD set
they refused to include the commentary because Trey and Matt
wouldn't let them censor it.  So Trey and Matt released it
separately, on a set of five CDs, with instructions on how to
time each CD track to go along with each DVD episode.  That was
about halfway okay unless you had to pause or rewind the show,
and then it was just about impossible to get the synch right
again without starting over from the beginning.

Enter the Riktronics DVD Development Squad!

We've combined the five commentary CDs with the Season 1 DVD set
and produced a complete set of South Park Season 1 with Trey and
Matt's commentary included.  The video quality is unchanged.
There has been no re-encoding or shrinking, and we did a pretty
fair job on the DVD authoring, artwork, and menus.  It's a damn
nice set.

Each of the 13 episodes has three audio tracks.  The first track
is the original episode soundtrack with no commentary.  The
second track is Trey and Matt's commentary with the episode
soundtrack subdued in the background.  The third track is the
commentary only, with the episode soundtrack completely
silenced.  You can switch between these tracks at any time using
the Audio key on your DVD player's remote control.

Subtitles are intact!  More info in the text file in the torrent.
