2)  Cape Town 
Cape Town is a nexus of cultures in a setting so stunning, it s called the 'new California' or 'Africa's Riviera.' Where else in the world can you wake up in a cosmopolitan city, spend the afternoon with penguins, ride a funicular to the edge of a continent, and watch the sun set from a beach with a glass of local wine in hand? From the dizzying heights of the city's iconic symbol, Table Mountain, to the rugged cliffs and wild flowers of the Cape Peninsula, you'll see all the natural wonders that surround this city.
