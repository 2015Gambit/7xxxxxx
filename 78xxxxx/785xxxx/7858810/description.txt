The Demon finally has Sara Pezzini and the Witchblade where he wants them: in the pits of hell. To get back home to her family, Sara must fight through a legion of the Witchblade's victims. She must also finally defeat the Demon himself. The Demon is just as motivated. At stake is a place in the hierarchy of hell's bureaucracy, vs. an eternity of perpetual torment. All-out, hellish action in the final chapter in this twisted tale of revenge and redemption.
