Release Notes:
--------
Co-produced by Lewis and legendary Nashville hit-maker James Stroud (Toby Keith,
Tim McGraw, Willie Nelson, Chris Young), The Road follows Aaron Lewis' debut
solo EP, Town Line, which bowed at #1 on the Billboard Country Albums chart in
2011 year. The Road contains ten songs, including first single "Endless Summer,"
which CMT has hailed as "the anthem of the Summer of 2012." It also contains the
Rhett Akins/Dallas Davidson/Bobby Pinson-penned "Granddaddy's Gun," marking the
first time in Lewis' entire career that he has cut a song he didn't have a hand
in writing.

The songs that make up The Road mirror the country roots of Lewis' childhood.
"This music and these songs represent who I am and where I come from," says
Lewis, who still resides in rural western Massachusetts.
"I hope people hear the record and realize that this is all me," Lewis says of
the songs on The Road. "I'm writing songs about who I am and where I am, just
like I've done my whole career. The setting for the songs might be different but
they're as honest as anything I've ever done."
