Transsexual Teen, Beauty Queen is an observational documentary following Jackie Green, the worldΓÇÖs youngest female transsexual, as she attempts to win the title of Miss England 2012.

The 18-year-old Leeds lass, born a boy named Jack, aims to become a role model for the trans-community and hopes competing in the beauty pageant will inspire other young people struggling with gender identity disorder. But how will she cope when pitted against some of the most beautiful girls in the land?

The film digs deep into JackieΓÇÖs difficult past: from hearing first hand how she came to realise she was trapped in a boyΓÇÖs body and its affect on her close-knit family, and how she made the social transition from a boy to a girl, aged just eight; to how the bullying at high school led her to the brink of suicide and how her life was changed by a trailblazing American doctor who stopped the onset of male puberty.∩╗┐
