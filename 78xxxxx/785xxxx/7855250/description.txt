Review:
It is no hidden secret that Liquid Music is the mastermind of keyboard player Chuck Wild who was part of the mid-eighties band Missing Persons. Though by the early nineties Wild found he was seeking solace and began creating calming solo material under the name Liquid Mind. With ten studio recordings to his name, the latest is subtitled Meditation with Wild retaining the wide open spaces courtesy of his soft flighty keyboards to create another project that will help you get away from it all.

Unlike his prior album Dream, Meditation is all new material though if you have heard one album you have essentially heard them all which is probably very intentional of Wild who continues to focus on his much understated melodies. With six total tracks running seven to fourteen minutes long, while there are brief breaks between the songs, they could have run seamlessly into one another. The tone, pattern and pace remain consistent throughout, allowing you as the listener to escape into your own private retreat.
