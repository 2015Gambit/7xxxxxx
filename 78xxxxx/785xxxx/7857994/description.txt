Smyslovye Gallyutsinatsii

Smyslovye Gallyutsinatsii is a Russian rock band which has won the Golden Gramophone award twice.
The name of the band may be translated as meaningful "hallucinations " or "semantic hallucinations". This is not a medical term; it was produced as a slip of the tongue and stuck. The band is also known under a much shorter name "Glyuki", a slang term, which means basically the same: glitches in your brain.

Biography

The band was formed in Sverdlovsk in 1989. In 1990, they became part of the Sverdlovsk rock club, and they were the last group accepted to it before the club was closed down.
For a decade the group had many problems, split a few times, and had problems getting a contract.
Their breakthrough came in 2000 when two of their songs, Rozovye Ochki (Pink Glasses) and Vechno Molodoy (Forever Young) were featured on the soundtrack of the Brother 2 movie. During this year the band also released their debut album, 3000.
In 2001, the band released their second album, Lyod 9 (Ice 9). Two songs from the album, Zachem Toptat Moyu Lubov (Why to Step on My Love) and Razum Kogda-Nibud Pobedit (The Mind Will Win One Day) received the most prestigious Russian musical award, the Golden Gramophone.
In 2003, the band released the Obratnaya Storona Zemli (The Other Side of the Earth) album. The album was a success and in 2004 the band was nominated for the Ovatsiya award as the band of the year.
In 2004, the band released a greatest hits compilation, called 66 Rus.
