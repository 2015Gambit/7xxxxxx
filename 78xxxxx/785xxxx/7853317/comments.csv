Or this one if you want seperate tracks for every song...

I prefer the split tracks myself."
,rlywndr,2012-11-24T05:53Z,"Thank you for non-split!  It's all a matter of preference, but I'm going to listen to all of it anyway and it is easier to load onto mp3 players as a single file."
,baby967,2012-11-25T14:43Z,"Try the cue file if you want to separate tracks.
It has everything you need for.
Thanks [:-)"
