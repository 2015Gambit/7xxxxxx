The Criminals of Islam by Shabbir Ahmed is probably the most challenging book you 

will ever read. It took courage to write this book and it will take courage to read 

it. It will give you an extraordinary stimulus to think and reflect. Our inherited

beliefs are idols deeply rooted in our psyche and emotions. The breaking of

these idols is no less a calamity than breaking the stone idols of an idol

worshiper. Therefore, this book is recommended only for the open-minded

reader with considerable moral courage.
