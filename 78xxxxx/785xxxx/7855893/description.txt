This informative survey shows how dampness can become an enemy when it invades our interior space, damaging our domestic fittings, finishes, and furnishings, encouraging mold and the spread of fungus and decay in the structure of our houses. A major industry has developed with specialist contractors that sometimes concentrate on a single treatment rather than offering a comprehensive diagnosis. Penned by an experienced architect, this manual will help readers evaluate solutions offered to them by professionals, enabling them to solve simple problems themselves.
