Defeat is eating away at the trickster god Loki. He hates being banished to the barbaric, backward lands of Hyboria. He hates the food, the wine, the women and he hates Red Sonja most of all for putting him in the position. He dreams of revenge, and putting this backwater land under his heel. Sometimes dreams come true.
