,82bear,2012-11-22T13:08Z,What's it do? Like what is the problem it is fixing exactly? Just curious.
,danv6,2012-11-22T13:53Z,"nope, didn't help"
,Darkilla,2012-11-22T14:05Z,this does nothing for me doesnt fix my problem
,Poulpe32,2012-11-22T14:10Z,"It adds lot of stuff to Steam install folder.
But, it didn't change anything to me either.

What was your problem, jKlark? ""Hitman5 has stopped working"" or directx11-related error ?

For info, how did you install hitman? In the steam's steamapps folder or in a different folder, like d:/hitman ?"
,Darkilla,2012-11-22T14:12Z,basically i run windows 8 32 bit and when i try to run the game nothing happens tried a lot of compitability modes and run as admin nothing worked
,nicklas1015,2012-11-22T14:14Z,"My problem is that the regular installer closes about halfway and does not finish the install...

I hope this fixes it"
,jKlark,2012-11-22T14:18Z,"@82bear Many people are saying that the skidrow release doesn't work for them. Now some people said that installing & updating Steam fixes the problem. So what this does is that it integrates & patches Steam. If it doesn't work for you, just uninstall it from the control panel. I'm just trying to help."
,jKlark,2012-11-22T14:22Z,"@Darkilla Do try installing Steam from their official site, then let it update. I myself have gotten the game to work that way. Otherwise I'd modify the crack & upload it for you guys like i did for Black Ops II."
,Darkilla,2012-11-22T14:23Z,why dont the comments update...
,Darkilla,2012-11-22T14:23Z,ill try thank you
,nicklas1015,2012-11-22T14:29Z,"Crap, didnt work for me.

It just edited some useless steam files ffs!"
,Darkilla,2012-11-22T14:31Z,installing steam and letting it update made the game launch but it crashed on the logo screen also the menu where you press play before the game launches is very laggy for some reason should i try using the patcher now?
,nicklas1015,2012-11-22T14:52Z,"CAN ANYONE HELP ME, I CANT INSTALL THE GAME SINCE THE INSTALLER CLOSES ON HALF WAY!

AND WHEN I TRY TO START GAME IT SAYS ""GAME CORRUPTED, PLEASE VERIFY CACHE"""
,Relaq,2012-11-22T15:00Z,Dont work. Delete this Shit
,Poulpe32,2012-11-22T15:13Z,"@Relaq : why don't delete yourself as you are a big piece of shit? This guy jKlark is kind enought to try and help people. If it doesn't work for you, just go buy the game or buy a rope to hang yourself."
,riahc3,2012-11-22T17:22Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL THIS. If the uploader does not give a clear description of what this does and/or what it modifies do not install it. May it work? Of course. But its shaddy that he does not detail the process. My recommendation is DO NOT install. You will most likely get malware in your system
,mqdn,2012-11-22T20:38Z,"@jKlark thanks for trying, I still have the ""Hitman5 has stopped working"" I'm beginning to think it's not really related to steam"
,82bear,2012-11-22T21:10Z,"@jKlark

Thanks for replying, and thank you for doing something for the scene. I don't have the skidrow copy but well done anyway."
,ashersh,2012-11-23T01:45Z,"Thanks for trying but it didnt help in my case, still getting that crash after selecting difficulty. bummer"
,jKlark,2012-11-23T09:16Z,"Since this is not working for anyone, i tried deleting it, but it's not deleting. So, i suggest you guys to just ignore it.  This is my first bad release... but everyone does mistakes."
,newgos1,2012-11-23T18:00Z,"WARNING DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Steam said someone else tried logging in to my computer.
try to uninstall all of it. and jKlark. i know u take it up the ass fag."
,jKlark,2012-11-23T20:34Z,"@newgos1

Thank you for sucking my d!ck. I hope you die soon."
,Thuggish456,2012-11-27T05:35Z,"Someone help me out-

When I installed the SKIDROW version, it all installed just fine, but when I try to open it... nothing happens.  At all.  No error message, just a quick computer is thinking on the mouse cursor, then nothing.

Will this fix that?"
,getslayer,2012-12-02T21:25Z,"UPDATE your windows, UPDATE you nvidia driver, INSTALL AND UPDATE steam (from the official website obviously) and I'll repeat it again DO YOUR DAMN WINDOWS UPDATE (even if you don't have a legit version of windows) it fixed ALL my problems with every torrents installation AND in-game crash (do the important update only) it will update frameworks and visual cc wich are in most case THE MAIN REASON why you have problems with directx AND the program has stopped working since it's a NEW game on a NEW engine you MUST update period. block your firewall and try running as an administrator also, it always help.
