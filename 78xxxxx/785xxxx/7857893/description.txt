Emphasizing flexible, counterintuitive decision making, Flip calls for a new way of doing business in an economy where conventional wisdom won't get you anywhere
"Business today requires new perspectives"ΓÇöthis is how Peter Sheahan, one of the youngest and fastest-rising stars on the international consulting and speaking circuit, begins this essential guidebook for succeeding in the twenty-first century. Sheahan reveals how the world's most effective organizations and individuals distinguish themselves from the competition, instead of running with the pack.
In Flip he uncovers what the superstars of modern business have in common: an ability to "flip"ΓÇöto think counterintuitively and then act boldly, with no regard for "business as usual" conventions. Sheahan explores six major flips:

To develop competitive advantage, you must Absolutely, Positively Sweat the Small Stuff.
To satisfy customers' needs for engagement and contactΓÇöspiritual, emotional, physicalΓÇöremember that it's not just business, Business Is Personal.
