,8ballin,2012-11-25T23:54Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this. Everyone dropped it like it was a disease. Me, my girl, our kids and grand kids all thank you!"
,growly546,2012-11-26T05:59Z,Thank you so much! You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this. Please do episodes 12 once it's released too. 
,amberpima,2012-11-26T09:52Z,aww yes I check several times evey day looking for this please upload the new ones as soon as they air
,greylion,2012-11-27T20:46Z,"According to epguides.com, this should have aired on the 21st.
I semi-expected rips to show up on the 22nd or so.
It's one week later, and zip, zilch, nada - except for this, which I only found by looking through the list of all episodes.
Anyone who knows why there aren't any (high quality) rips of this out there?"
,muckymucks,2012-11-28T02:44Z,"Yes, I'm wondering where the HD .mkv version is as well. I can't find it anywhere."
,musclestud1,2012-11-28T05:47Z,"I know that uploaders are very busy with Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and CyberMonday.  This version is really really bad quality, but hey!  Questar was the only one kind enough to upload this."
,greylion,2012-11-28T07:12Z,"Ah, of course. Some go back home for Thanksgiving and stay there for a week, maybe a little longer.
I know better than most how important it is to get some holidays/vacation once in a while, and the uploaders richly deserve some."
