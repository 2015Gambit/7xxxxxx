,Mercyflush64,2012-11-23T05:27Z,May main concern is can you choose a device to save your game or is it hosed like the previous upload and you have to start new each time you play?
,Mercyflush64,2012-11-23T06:53Z,Just downloaded and installed. This is the same version just with a different setup install. There is no way to choose the option to pick a storage device so you can't save your game.
,Cerebral222,2012-11-23T09:37Z,"No problems with saving here. This game both saves & loads the save files. If you are having problems with saving, the only thing I can think of, is for you to right the FGUY.exe click go to compatability, & tick the Privilege Level box to run as Admin; I didn't need to do that, but everybody has a different rig setup, but the game does save:

,Cerebral222,2012-11-23T09:48Z,"Ha ha, I've had a few beers; don't pay attention to the slip up in my last comment; right click the FGUY.exe & go to compatability, then tick the Privilege Level box to run as Admin, should do the trick."
