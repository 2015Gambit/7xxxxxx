,ND1DN,2012-11-27T04:08Z,"Dont hate on this user, he used 8$+ to watch this movie! so go and wait a few months for the dvd rip or go pay and see the movie"
,srising69,2012-11-27T08:26Z,"I just finished watching it. It is a little dark in some of the scenes, making it hard to make out whats happening. But, not bad considering. I rather enjoyed it and will seed for others. Thank you."
,adamjc420,2012-11-27T11:02Z,Even though this cam rip is horrible and the worst cam i've seen. I appreciate the time you took to upload it to share with us. 
,hemech01,2012-11-27T18:31Z,Thanks for the upload. But the last 1/4 of the movie is very dark (the whole thing is dark) and difficult to tell what is going on
,CarlZeiss,2012-11-28T01:11Z,@JoaoPauloBR - It's a copy of another terrible film called Red Dawn
,Angolmagyar,2012-11-30T22:11Z,"as i see from the comments, its mostly idiotic, unappreciative ratings, so as soon as its downloaded I'll give you an actual rating, but as a little side note, its a fucking cam rip.. dont expect some HD shit, cuz u'll just be disappointed by your own imagination..."
,nycmon,2012-12-01T06:14Z,DirtyMary one is much better video...I'd go with that one ;)
,DreaD151,2012-12-02T20:51Z,"Ok for the idiot(s) who think scene4all went to the movies and recorded this  let me  replay the broken record for the 100 billionth time......Scene4all and all  the other folks who post torrents dont record these movies they do the best with what they are GIVEN.... the copies of the cams come from different countries ex Russia,China,India,Korea,etc....They have english and foreign language theaters there or they get the audio from somewhere that does ans sync them....they edit the video and audio for FREE for people like us to enjoy... sooo next time you decide to comment please by all means dont be thankful that these folks are even wasting their time doin this for everyone cause i really appreciated it  regardless of the quality ...."
