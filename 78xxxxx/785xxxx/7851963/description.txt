AM Records SACD (493 647-2)

Recently these files were uploaded in 16bit 44khz using a Sony Playstation.  I wanted to share the the high resolution 24bit 96khz files....

2 channel SACD iso downloaded from the russian torrent site.
The individual song 2 channel DFF master edit files were extracted from the SACD ISO with sacd extract app.
The resulting DFF was rendered into 24 bit 96 KHz WAV using Saracon using a clip free gain in a single step with the following settings:

PCM OUTPUT:  WAV
NUMBER FORMAT:  24 bit
DITHER:  TPDF
SAMPLE RATE:  96 KHz
GAIN:  + 2.0 dB

The WAV was split with the cue generated on extraction. 
The resulting track WAV files were converted to level 8 FLAC with dbpoweramp.

All tracks properly tagged with Artwork embedded.
