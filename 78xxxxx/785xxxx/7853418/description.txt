Hi there
Here is our remastered version from "A lonely place to die" BD's movie European version.(HD.1080p)
This BD has been quite difficult to rip due to an hard anti-copy protection.
However we finaly found a way to do it.
Acceptable quality but with a loss of 25% of the full size of this movie as firstly remastered to BD 25 size.
We decided to make a smaler copy size afterwards.
There 's a pixelation for sure during approximaly 3 seconds on a specific scene for sure.
We have downgraded both sound track in US English and French language coming to DTS-HD MA 5.1 to simple AC3-5.1/48 khz/16 bits/512 kbps speed.
We have also added US English sub only as not present in the BD for more convenience to all indeed.
There's a small problem with synchronisation between dialog and subtitle with a difference to 3-5 seconds on time play but it stay acceptable anyway.
So see yourself and decide then
