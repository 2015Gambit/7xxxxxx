Peter Cannon is a world-famous author, an international celebrity, and the superhero known as Thunderbolt, acknowledged far and wide as the man who saved the world from destruction. Unfortunately, he has little interest in fame, even less interest in people, and the peace he has created is based on an illusion. Now, as old and new enemies plan to destroy his efforts -- unaware of the secret he carries -- Peter Cannon must fight to keep the peace and preserve his own sanity, while fending off deadly foes... and mysterious admirers. Join artist Alex Ross and writer Steve Darnall for the story of a hero who discovers that sometimes... the greatest menaces really are all in your mind.
