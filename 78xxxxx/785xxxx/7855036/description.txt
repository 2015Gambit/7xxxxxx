24-Carat Black - Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth [1973]

Original CD release -- mp3 V0

This is a hidden cult classic on Stax.

How this title managed to get buried so deep inside of the Stax catalog of classic material I don't know. What I do know that is Ghetto: Misfortune's Wealth easily holds company with some of the better know heavyweights of Stax Records lore (Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes etc).

Soulful grooves and thought provoking consciencous lyrics are blended together beautifully. Your bound to have heard (although without really having much of an idea that it was from this project) a lot of material on this sampled by some of hip hop giants including Rakim,Dr. Dre & KRS-One.

This album is a must have for true fans of 70's R&B music.

Very tight, a masterpiece. One of the most sampled albums ever.

My personal best are the jazzy groover "24 Carat Black Theme" ΓÇô a killer funky number, with a wonderfully spacey groove and 12.40 minutes ΓÇ£PovertyΓÇÖs ParadiseΓÇ¥.

Don't Sleep.
