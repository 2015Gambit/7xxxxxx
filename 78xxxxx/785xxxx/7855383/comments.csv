Video files are not compressible, so there is no point in RARing them."
,Boggan666,2012-11-24T08:11Z,"Well, actually it is very useful in a couple of cases. When you have limited storage and need to break a file into pieces for example. And you dont *have* to compress the files, just choose ""storage"" instead, that way you dont compress it twice."
,acsmith1972,2012-11-24T08:56Z,"I'm new at this uploading thing. Basically I threw all the episodes into a folder and rarred the whole thing. I'm so used to not being able to upload actual folders, but if I can do a torrent that way and it doesn't change anything I'll do it that way next time. "
,Boggan666,2012-11-24T10:35Z,"Yeah thats not a problem, you can archive whole folder trees, and still retain the directory structure. 
Make sure to, when packing media, Avi, Mp3, Mpg,Mp4,Mkv etc, to choose as compression level ""store"", that way the data does not get compressed again and you will save valuable time."
,Boggan666,2012-11-24T10:42Z,"Just make sure when you are compressing Video files to choose ""store"" when choosing how hard compression you want, that way you wont waste precious cpu resources."

,acsmith1972,2012-11-24T11:17Z,I wish more people would seed this. At some point I want to turn my computer off. It sounds a little like a small jet taking off when it's on. 
,NoMoreAVI,2012-11-24T17:32Z,RAR torrents are retarded. You can't tell if this is crappy AVIs or proper mpeg-4s. You can' t download one video to check quality. 
,acsmith1972,2012-11-25T05:13Z,"AVI: What you can do is read the comments above where I clearly stated that the quality isn't stellar, sort of like an old vcr tape, but fine on a computer. Considering I'm the first one to take the Q episodes and bundle them I think you can cut me some slack for rarring the folder. "
,acsmith1972,2012-11-25T05:13Z,Or you can feel free to go buy the blu-ray copies of the seasons you need to see those episodes...
