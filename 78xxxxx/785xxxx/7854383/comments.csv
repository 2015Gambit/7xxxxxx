Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;ll also point out that it is only about 8 min. long.
It was informative of the nature and definition of a Ponzi scheme.
Thank you for all your uploads cloak-and-dagger."

Learn about investment traps with an insight into fraudulent Ponzi Schemes with iMinds insightful knowledge series. 

A Ponzi scheme is an illegal business practice. Investors are recruited into a Ponzi scheme and offered excellent returns over time for little or no risk. The operator of a Ponzi scheme relies on further recruitment of investors to accumulate funds. Earlier investors are repaid with later investorâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s money. They have also been described as Pyramid Schemes. 
Ponzi schemes get their name from Carlo Ponzi, an Italian who immigrated to the US in 1903. He fled Italy to avoid gambling debts and criminal charges. For several years he travelled through the United States and Canada. During this time he was convicted of theft and served jail sentences in both countries.
