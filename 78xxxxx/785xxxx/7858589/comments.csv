,4gameslt,2012-11-25T17:06Z,Edward_PTM - Try checking torrent.
,4gameslt,2012-11-25T17:08Z,Launcher.exe is from: http://cs.i4vn.com/
,4gameslt,2012-11-25T17:27Z,"nosTEAM - This can be because, it creates alot of temporary files, when it is strated. It makes some files in Steam folder, to auto connect to steam account and validate client.dll, then it creates csgolauncher to see if everything is ok, and game can be started. If okey, then launcher creates not temporary files to launch csgo in  steam/steamapps/common/counter-strike global offensive folder."

,antiqque,2012-11-26T00:49Z,I recommended this to my friend and it's lagging badly for him :( he said that during the free week-end when he played the steam version it never lagged. do you have any tips on how to make it run better on lower end pc's? I don't have lag but once i did experience a major fps drop for ~3s which is really weird.
,4gameslt,2012-11-26T01:06Z,Free weekend didn't have that kind of graphics. So your friend needs to chack his graphic options. He have to reduce almost everything to low. Or he can try to reduce everything randomly.
,4gameslt,2012-11-26T01:08Z,"Ou, and change resolution in game, this can also reduce lags."

can you upload client.dll for those who have unlocked versions?

thank you so much"
,4gameslt,2012-11-26T16:35Z,"@ 4nt1trt 
Client dll is generated by steam. Maybe one day there will be some generators. But for now you only can get it from steam. For now, I think, it wont work with skidrow files. Of course I can make updater, to update these files. But firstly, I will have to download skidrow files and kae Updater. Ofcourse, you can wait, but I think, that  it will be much more faster to download theese files."

,4gameslt,2012-11-26T17:33Z,"@ Yoyu7 - Usualy software like this is like a atrojan, because it creates a lot of files. And yes, that launcher is like a trojan, because it has alot of hidden files inside. And just in case you think that I am responsable for that trojans, I just found this launcher, I use it, my friends use it, other people from this torrent are useing it, and everything is okey."
