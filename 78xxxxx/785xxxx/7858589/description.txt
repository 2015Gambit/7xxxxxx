Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an online first-person shooter developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment, who also maintained Counter-Strike: Source after its release. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike franchise, excluding Counter-Strike Neo and Counter-Strike Online.
Global Offensive was released on 21 August 2012 and made available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade and a U.S. version only on the PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network. It features classic content, such as old maps, as well as brand new maps, characters and game modes. It supports matchmaking and leaderboards.[4] An Elo rating system prioritizes matching players by skill.[5] Cross-platform multiplayer was planned between Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and PlayStation 3 players,[5] but was ultimately limited to PC and Mac due to the differences in update frequency between the systems.[6] The PlayStation 3 version offers three input control methods, which include using either the DualShock 3 controller, PlayStation Move or USB keyboard/mouse
