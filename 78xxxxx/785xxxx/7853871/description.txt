From the Preface:

This revised handbook provides a concise summary of the salient facts and formulas relating to 40 major probability distributions, together with associated diagrams that allow the shape and other general properties of each distribution to be readily appreciated. 

     In the introductory chapters the fundamental concepts of the subject are covered with clarity, and the rules governing the relationships between variates are described. Extensive use is made of the inverse distribution function and a de∩¼ünition establishes a variate as a generalized form of a random variable. A consistent and unambiguous system of nomenclature can thus be developed, with chapter summaries relating to individual distributions. 

     Students, teachers, and practitioners for whom statistics is either a primary or secondary discipline will ∩¼ünd this book of great value, both for factual references and as a guide to the basic principles of the subject. It ful∩¼ülls the need for rapid access to information that must otherwise be gleaned from many scattered sources.
