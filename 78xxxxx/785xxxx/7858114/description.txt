Ayurveda is an age-old medical system that was formulated over 5,000 years ago. Documented in the Vedas, the ancient Hindu sacred texts of India, it is a complete wellness regimen with ultimate spiritual goals. Ayurveda provides a detailed analysis of India's four healing systemsΓÇöAyurveda, Unani, Siddha and Tibetan traditional medicine. This fascinating book also takes a look at India's ancient beauty secrets: essays on hair, facial, hand and foot care are accompanied by more obscure practices such as healing with metals, minerals, crystals and gemstones, the art of body painting and chakra alignment.
