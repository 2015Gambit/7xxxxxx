Am sure folks can not wait but this film is the worst to watch a CAM copy, it has arresting visuals...."

quality sucked but i managed to find a better one at twilight.mobilsurfer.com worked great for me.

Quit peddling your pay sites that my virus software mercifully blocks.  Douchebags!"
,abeajde,2012-11-30T15:03Z,"Great movie, but I don't think that is worth watching it in this quality, I was searching and I found great copy (similar to dvd rip) at film.nearks.com and it worked great for me! Enjoy! "
