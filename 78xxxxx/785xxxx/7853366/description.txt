Imagine it, build it! Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition lets you    
create worlds from the comfort of your sofa. Play alone or    
play with your friends. Explore, build and conquer! At night  
monsters come out, so make sure to build a shelter before that
happens. After that, your world is your imagination. Turn your
hours into minutes with Minecraft!
