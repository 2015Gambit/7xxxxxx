Notes........I see DVDMANIA pred their .PT PAL today. How is 
             it possible that a flick at excactly the same size,
             with just one 5.1-track and one sub, gets a bitrate 
             allmost 350 Kbps lower than this one? That group
             must be real shitty. Shame there wasn't released a
             multisubbed DVD like the BluRay was.




             Love the MPEG and it's allmost 30 year long history!
             It was the very first Codec used for commercial 
             Digital Video/Audio, and deserves respect.
