[V],WTC-SWE,2012-11-25T20:35Z,"Since i've been away for a while from uploading,i decided to upload a special(rare) torrent for you guys.You won't find it elsewhere and that's a promise.(Feel free to google it).Unique footage that aren't easy to find nowdays,warscenes from all six generals etc..so grab it whilst you can.I added a multisub scandinavian package(hours and hours of work,no exaggeration there -->24 different subtitles) and decided to go along with an mkv container instead of avi. [ Audio/sound=English ]

Then i had hard time to decide if i should proceed with embedded subtitles,inside the mkv file itself,idx,sub..etc.. or just leave them as they are-(srt files-converted-final decision, for better experience).
In this case i choosed to merge them into the container.I've also altered the picture to widescreen,in order to preserve the genuine footage and details.(Used several video converters).Raised the framerate and the bitrate on both video/audio.(Between 2600-2700 kbit/s for video and 192 kbit/s for audio AC3).If you want,you can always change the video settings on VLC-player to another dimension, after your own liking.

SUBTITLE PART:
Just click on which part you want to watch 1,2..3...4,5...6 (with VLC-player) and  then continue by rightclicking over the movie.Once you've done so,you will be able to view the subtitle option(Look at the middle of the menu,under sound/video).Continue by scrolling over the ""subtitle option with the mouse,until you see the tracks.Choose from track 1 - 4 for your desired language.I changed the menu so you're able to view them.Also none of the subtitles are forced,so you have to manually pick one.

Tracks:

1)Danish
2)Finnish
3)Norwegian
4)Swedish

Just do as i mentioned above and you won't have any issues,simple as that.
For the record,i've tested the files on many other players,so there shouldn't be any problems whatsoever.

SIDENOTE:
If i've missed some spaces between words/letters/numbers,try to be understanding.I had to deal with 4x6=24 subtitles for a single torrent here,thank you.


FINALLY: It's always a pleasure sharing to you all and if you want to thank me,then please help seed.Enjoy and have a nice day/evening people.
