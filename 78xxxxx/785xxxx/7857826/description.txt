Shamelessly pulled off Youtube as a lot of my videos that are not new races will be. I joined three files here which each had different audio levels. It was clearly pulled off a VHS tape and had a lot of tape hiss and very muddled audio. I've tried to remove the tape hiss, as well as trying to attempt to improve voice clarity. The original source also was letterboxed 16:9 in 4:3 ratio. I've cropped and trimmed the selections and restored the original 4:3 aspect ratio.

Thanks to the original uploader. 

I'm not posting the link here simply because I don't especially wish to help DMCA agents.
