Update 11 (needed for this CK) is here:

,Peccatvm,2012-11-23T23:33Z,I tryed to share this same version 3 days ago but after the upload was complete nothing happened so i quited.
,Valamyr82,2012-11-25T04:18Z,"Thanks for this but Im a bit surprised by the low file size, half the size of the previous version? Why so light?"
,Valamyr82,2012-11-25T04:26Z,"Wow im a moron, its just compression. Nm. This seems legit."
,Sceptrum,2012-11-25T12:16Z,I re-packed this version to remove the password and use 7z encoding thus lowering the file size significantly.
