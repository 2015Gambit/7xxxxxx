Iron Sky Invasion-RELOADED
Iron Sky: Invasion (c) Reality Pump

11/2012 :..... RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: SerialActivation
1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action/RTS/Sim

In 1945 a small band of Nazis escaped the Earth to settle on the dark side
of the moon, where they lay in wait for the next 70 years planning their
revenge
...Now it is 2018, and for more than half a century the Nazis have watched
us, waiting for any sign of weakness. Their invasion has begun. Mankind
faces the most radical enemy it has ever known: the Fourth Reich
The end is coming. Do you have what it takes to become a legend? Because
anything less, and you will fail. In war, a force multiplier is a soldier
or weapon that causes so much damage the enemy loses its will to fight. On
the ground, this means a snipe... but in the sky it means a pilot, a
dogfighting, showboating champion. Do you have what it takes to be the next
legend of the skies
