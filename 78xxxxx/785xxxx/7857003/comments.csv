,dr_mark,2012-11-25T15:34Z,"Once again big Thank You Marcus!  One quick question, I bought the concert and ripped it with anydvd.  The files are all M2TS.  Handbreak does not work with these files to convert them to .MKV  What are you using to convert them?"
,phase700b,2012-11-25T17:14Z,Thanks Marcus. Wanted to mention I needed to run the file through MkvMerge to add a 333 ms delay to the audio. Not a big deal and maybe just my machine acting weird.
,marcus100868,2012-11-25T21:55Z,"Hi dr_mark,I start with Anydvd Makes the M2TS file,then i use  MakeMKV which does mkv file with chapters and which ever audio you choose, then Ripbot 264 to make smaller file There you go but note sometimes some discs have got different encrypt ions and some bands make discs hard to copy to, but i usually notice that disc with dolby true hd are always harder.

,marcus100868,2012-11-25T22:11Z,"Hi phase700b,yes you are right  i notice this yesterday when i was watching the file  on my home theatre the was a slight delay and i compared it with the original bluray disc i even reckon the actual disc is slightly delayed but the again like i mentioned to dr_mark the dolby true hd sound tracks always give me problems i will try to rip again and see how i go and will re upload again if better.

,phase700b,2012-11-26T17:32Z,Hi Marcus. I was wondering. Won't MakeMKV rip an MKV file directly from an encrypted Blu-ray disc? Seems like I read it would work. Might eliminate the need for Anydvd?
,marcus100868,2012-11-26T21:44Z,"Hi phase700b, yes it does you  really don't have to use anydvd but i always use it because i use an Esata hard drive doc on my bdp-95 oppo bluray player to my home theater so i don't have to get up and change disc all the time and it also gives you all the extra features like the disc does.the only thing is you need a lot of hard drives!!! That's why i reckon oppo bluray players are the best they will play any file and audio that exist when i stream from my  computer  MakeMKV is good because you can choose what ever audio you like or multiple audio but the file is still large and all the extra features are in separate folders but it's a very good program there you go i got lost in words a bit."
,phase700b,2012-11-26T22:18Z,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Sounds like a good way to handle the media. I didn't realize that Oppo was that versatile. Pretty cool."
,marcus100868,2012-11-26T22:43Z,I think there is a new model bdp-103 oppo which retails for about $500 us dollars i have had denon toshiba marantz pioneer but the oppo is way better.
