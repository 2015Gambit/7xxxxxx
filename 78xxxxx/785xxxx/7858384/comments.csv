,atlas12,2012-11-25T13:50Z,"Orbx needs to clean up their PR, starting with JV first. "
,aarque,2012-11-25T14:22Z,"Ya, ORBX practices a weird form of capitalism. None of their installers are ever passworded, so they obviously don't care if customers share the product; meanwhile, perfectly legitimate customers who DON'T share the product are being forced to move to sites like Avsim and establish ""pirate"" support forums, huh."

,phantom13666,2012-11-25T20:24Z,"Guys, seriously, stop bitching so much. This was just released, and has a shit ton of leechers, if it isnt going fast enough for you then stop it, wait an hour, and try again. Or buy it."

Gibraltar could be found here:
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6149778
a simple search would yielded you with the same , Enjoy :)"
,KevTheOne,2012-11-26T10:17Z,"Ran the installer and process took 1 or 2 seconds, looks weird considering it's a 3GB file, do you think something got wrong in my install?"
,KevTheOne,2012-11-26T10:57Z,"yeah it's not working for me, installer just close itself after a second without any notice."
,jamesdude,2012-11-26T11:04Z,"@_SnakEye
I've downloaded that, just no idea how to install.."
,Brrr1955,2012-11-26T15:24Z,"Works nice :) (Win7 64)
If you have some UK2000 scenery, they must be above ORBX FTX EU ENG"
,phantom13666,2012-11-26T19:45Z,"KevTheOne, working fine for me and a friend, must be your download, sorry to say :"
,KevTheOne,2012-11-26T20:54Z,"Found the cause, I was lacking of free disk space in my FSX partition :/"
,toff1969,2012-11-26T21:09Z,ok good thank
,.KRAAG.,2012-11-27T04:31Z,"Haha, funny uploader is pissed at software devs

HA!

Take that ORBX!"
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-27T07:08Z,@snakeyes. That Gibraltar installer doesn't work. It installs files but is is missing so much causing the runway to be all messed up and tons of floating buildings. We need a better one with a proper installer. Also@ JamesDude. You can use any Ascrypt from any of the others that comes with one and use that. I only use one on all my installs and it works fine. They are not specially made for each install separate. 
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-27T11:03Z,"Installed great and fine on Win7Pro. However after looking at their website. This scenery looks horrible. Not as great as I thought it would be. It's def not worth what they are charging. I say this should be on the 4.99 rack...LOL.. They made it look so good on the screens they showed. Now the Australia one is great, but this one looks choppy and the detail is pretty lame. Thanks for it though! "
,737pilot7,2012-11-27T16:23Z,"Thanks, 

requesting: Lionheart Creations Piper Pacer"
,jamesdude,2012-11-27T16:55Z,"@CyrusTheVirus07
The installer has a ascrypt_pro.dll and NOT just a usual ascrypt.dll, i tried moving a cracked ascrypt.dll and delete the ascrypt_pro.dll nut it gave  me a dll error"
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-27T18:09Z,"@jamesdude! that is odd because I only use one ascrypt.dll file for all my aerosoft products. All it is designed to do is bypass the registration and allow you to put in anything you want as opposed to the serial you should have if one purchases it. For example if you were to install aerosoft maderiaX and use the ascrypt.dll file to bypass the normal registration process, you can use that same ascrypt.dll fill for another aerosoft product. I only use one and not each separate ones that came with the downloads. All you do is over-write the existing one by replacing it and giving permission to copy over the first one. Do not delete it the original one, but replace it only. It will ask you if you want to copy over the original and once you hit yes, you will be allowed to put in what ever name and serial code you want. "
,jamesdude,2012-11-27T18:41Z,@CyrusTheVirus07 Yeah its being a bitch to me now!
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-28T00:23Z,"@jamesdude! Are you trying to install GibraltarX? I tried the installer one and it did not work, so I downloaded the one with just the scenery and effects files and I added it manually. That Vatican Installer one is a load of crap which added some maleware in it. Nothing vital, but useless junk to slow down ones PC and give problems. We need one with the actual installer from aerosoft. "
,relfel66,2012-11-28T05:13Z,"After selecting which version to install (FSX) and hitting next I get an error message: 

Radio Buttons> On Next,Line 10: Argument 2 must be of type string.

Stack Traceback:

1: [Radio Buttons > On Next] Line: 10 in main   chunk

If I hit ok it takes me back to the screen to select my version. Any ideas?"
,jamesdude,2012-11-28T07:40Z,"@CyrusTheVirus07 I have the installer, if you are willing to give me your email address i'll email it to you and see if you can find a cracked ascrypt_pro.dll!"
,DLJHEL,2012-11-28T09:19Z,Right on Brother u tell them Namco and thx for the up ill seed as long as i can
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-29T03:42Z,@jamesdude: my email is cuttingedgevideos@yahoo.com. Can you send that big of a file via email? 
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-29T04:39Z,"@jamesdude! Are you using the FSX or Fs2004 version? Also, your not using the Installer made by Vatican are you? That one actually sucks and it is missing so many files after install."
,jamesdude,2012-11-29T13:54Z,"@CyrusTheVirus07 Yea its the proper fsx one I got from a friend, not the vatican shitty one, im uploading the gibralter x now!:)"
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-29T16:30Z,"@jamesdude! Cool, I will give it a shot and keep you posted. If the one that I use on all my aerosoft products does not work, I will go back and grab each one from the sceneries and try those. If that does not work; I will then have my friend look over the ascrypt file to see if he can do something with it for that scenery. "
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-11-30T02:29Z,@jamesdude! I sent you a couple of emails and having issues with DL that file from that site. There is an issue with that site. I would like to help but can't without the file. I gave some other sending options. 
,MiGKiller29,2012-12-02T01:49Z,Thank you!
