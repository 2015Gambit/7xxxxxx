While attending a demonstration in radiology, high school student Peter Parker was bitten by a spider which had accidentally been exposed to radioactive rays. Through a miracle of science, Peter soon found that he had gained the Spider's powers... and had, in effect, become a human spider! From that day on he was... The Amazing Spider-Man


The Amazing Spider-Man is an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics, featuring the adventures of the fictional superhero Spider-Man. Being the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously until it was relaunched with a new numbering order in 1999. In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume. The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. A film named after the comic was released July 3, 2012.

The title will end its 50-year run as a continuously published comic with issue #700 in December 2012. It will be replaced by The Superior Spider-Man as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch of Marvel's comic lines.
