As if things couldn't get any worse, satanic forces are closing in on Collinswood. This time, however, they are not hunting for Barnabas Collins. Who are they coming for and what do they want with the Collins' bloodline? Only Barnabas' darkest abilities and urges may give him the strength to save his family. But have those gifts left him as well? Is Barnabas truly not evil enough to prevail?
