Author of "Bird by Bird," "Traveling Mercies" & "Operating Instructions."In this workshop, Anne Lamont's animated, witty words take you beyond her book "Bird by Bird." Good writing, she says, slow you down, opens your heart and teaches you who you are. Good writing arrives through your fingers, knowing what. But you must endure terrible first drafts and use short assignments to get there, word by word.
