Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?! is a 2D side-scrolling, action-adventure game that is based on Cartoon Network's animated television series Adventure Time. The game was developed by WayForward Technologies, and published by D3 Publisher of America for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS consoles. The game was released on November 20, 2012 only for North America.

The gameplay is shown to top-down when Finn and Jake are exploring The Land of Ooo, but when the player goes into a dungeon, the gameplay switches into a 2D side-scroller, much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The game will have a second quest once beaten. It will have many items that helps you on your adventure, many which are iconic items from the show such as the Tiger Claw and Royal Tart. Some items are food items that replenish some of your health. Combining food can either replenish more health, (like hamburger and ketchup)or harm your health (like hamburger and maple syrup). There will be four mainlands players will explore like the Grasslands, Candy Kingdom, Ice Kingdom, and Red Rock Pass. Jake will learn more of his stretchy abilities once you progress into the game. They include a wavy punch, ear shield, transforming into a bridge, dinghy, parasol and many more.
