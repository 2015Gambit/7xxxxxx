It has a very important text file you should read, and then, some songs, and SouthPark and Simpsons .wav's and one .wav from Donald Duck  or the woman who did his voice. Enjoy. And, as always, remember to seed. Thanks.

And one more thing: READ THIS.

Free Anakata!

Our friend and founder Anakata (that once created The Pirate Bay tracker) has been arrested in Cambodia. The Swedish government want him sent to Sweden to serve his 1 year jail time. There are also suspicions that they want him locked up due to Anakatas long involvement and friendship with the Wikileaks crew.

And just as he got arrested, Sweden just happened to donate $59 million to Cambodia. Just a coincidence of course... or?
