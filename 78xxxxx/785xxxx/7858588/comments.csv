,jc4321234,2012-11-25T17:04Z,Can someone let me know if this is working properly and if they've received the file. It's my first attempt at uploading anything
[T],xgimpyx,2012-11-25T18:35Z,"You did good. I just connected and hooked to 20 plus seeds right away. I think your not getting more leechers because it's not showing up in search unless you add the apostrophe in ""I'm"". I put your link in the comments of ep 11 so maybe more will find it."
,jc4321234,2012-11-25T18:57Z,"cheers, xgimpyx. That should help. I had no idea apostrophes affected the search. That sucks, wish i could change it."

I can't find it anywhere.

Thanx"
[T],xgimpyx,2012-11-25T23:36Z,"Hey nursex78,
If you don't find avi you can use converterlite a free program to convert an mp4 in about 3 minutes. Heres a link if it doesn't get removed from the comment.
