We know what happens when aliens attack the White House and we've got a pretty good idea of what happens when they attack Sigourney Weaver, but what happens when a race of pig-eating, flesh-gnarling sonsofbitches attack a Kentucky moonshining town? Well. You best put your feet up, sit a spell and kiss yer sister on the mouth 'cuz you about to find out. It's gonna be up to Johnny Ray to kick some green-skinned butt AND keep his moronic brother Elvis out of trouble, while protecting the sister he loves...probably more than he should. It's aliens, rednecks and incest!! Brought to you by the good ol' boys at RAW STUDIOS!
