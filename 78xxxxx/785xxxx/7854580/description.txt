||		ViDEO LENGTH: 1h24m04s					||
||									||
||		NOTES: Right before commercial breaks Hallmark		||
||		switched ar from 16:9 letterbox to 4:3, so that's why	||
||		the last few seconds before each commercial break	||
||		the ar switches back and forth, it's how it aired.	||
||		It's beyond our control, and it didn't make sense	||
||		to cut part of the programme out.			||

==========================================================================

||		A huge thanks goes out to those of you			||
||		who don't complain about the video quality.		||
||		It's a TVRip, what do you expect? Familiarise		||
||		yourself with release tags or GTFO. :)			||

||				ABOUT:					||
||									||
||		UNPOPULAR is a lame P2P group that sucks at		||
||		releasing on time and in high quality. They		||
||		do what they can, but without HDTV feed or		||
||		any prior encoding experience, they receive		||
||		more complaints than compliments. They try!		||
