,Letyme,2012-11-22T19:55Z,How does this help if Borderlands 2 isnt on Mac? I suppose 41 people ported it. 
,Th3Trigg3r,2012-11-22T20:22Z,@Letyme this game is supported on mac but now im just downloading it to know if this works or not. (btw its a steam version)
,Th3Trigg3r,2012-11-22T20:34Z,Oh Facepalm Don't we need the game itself not the dlc unlocked
,Th3Trigg3r,2012-11-22T20:35Z,oh guys this is just dlc umlocker not the game URGH
,coctopus,2012-11-23T12:19Z,@Th3Trigg3r Read the title.
,coctopus,2012-11-23T19:12Z,Where is the original Binary for BL2?
,emasen,2012-11-24T02:15Z,Where is the Binary in the file? 
,sportschain91,2012-11-24T03:36Z,"I've replaced the binary and placed the POGameStop folder in DLC. I doesn't seem like any of the dlc's are working. Do I have to have bought the game off of steam, or out of the box to use this, or could I use this with a torrent of BL2 from this site?"
,Gustvera,2012-11-27T16:40Z,where is the binary in the BL2?? i need to pay the game on the steam or i can play the cracked version??
,gatosardina,2012-11-27T19:05Z,"@Gustvera go on finder, applications. Look for borderlands. Right click or whatever you want to call it on it. Select ""Show package content"" (should be the second option). 
Contents>GameData>Binaries"
,BraydenS,2012-11-28T15:16Z,Yes! The Mac version even has DLCs. Thanks!
,whichjoke333,2012-11-28T22:01Z,"Has anyone got it to work? I downloaded the version that on TPB - I can't seeem to get it to work, does it have to verify online?"
,whichjoke333,2012-11-28T22:03Z,cos my version can't connect to stream
,XnaXioX,2012-11-29T04:36Z,"i still without finding the binary in the game, i selected borderlands 2>contents>gamedata>binaries but theres no binary to replace, only a folder called Win32. Please help (i installed the native version of borderlands 2 for mac)"
,emokid117,2012-11-30T05:06Z,"Right click Borderlands 2 > Show package contents >Contents > MacOS. 

Then open terminal and type chmod +x (With a space after the X.) 

Drag the borderlands 2 file from the torret folder to terminal and press enter. 

Then Drag the converted file to the original Borderlands 2 Binary. Hope this helps!

Comment back if you'd like me to make a video tutorial. :3"

,TalibanNinjaX,2012-12-01T08:48Z,"@emokid117 
I followed all the steps, and I think it worked. How do i know if it worked and how do i download DLC?"
,emokid117,2012-12-01T09:04Z,"@TalibanNinjaX you'll know if the DLC unlocker worked if you are able to select gaige the mechromancer and if you can fast travel to the oasis which is the Pirate's Booty dlc thingy.

and I am not sure on how to get the newer DLC's like Mr. Torgues Campaign of Carnage. so ya.."
,emokid117,2012-12-01T18:34Z,"Guys, sorry for the delay on the video cuz I got a bit busy with my relationship and a lot lazy today.. so ya.. it's rendering right now...I should be able to upload it by tomorrow. please stay tuned thnx :3

I'll post a link here and in the Borderlands 2 torrent... off to bed ...zZzZz..."
,TalibanNinjaX,2012-12-01T22:08Z,"@emokid117
Is there any additional downloads that I need to do, like do i need to download the Pirate's Booty DLC from Steam? "
,TalibanNinjaX,2012-12-02T04:14Z,NVM! it worked
,MacPro5,2012-12-02T05:37Z,"@emokid117

Everytime I do this, it says Permission Denied in terminal. I allowed all the files permission and its still saying this. I can replace the binary, but the game wont launch. How do I fix this??"
,emokid117,2012-12-02T10:59Z,@MacPro5 I've never encountered that problem so the only help I can provide is google. sorry :/
,emokid117,2012-12-02T13:57Z,strange..somehow i post a comment ._.
,emokid117,2012-12-02T14:04Z,uhh...how do you comment links?? ._. it says database error. :/
,emokid117,2012-12-02T14:22Z,sigh I really can't post the link :/ 
,emokid117,2012-12-02T15:46Z,just go to youtube and type jeffgwapo2. You should see my channel that way. I really just can't post links for some reasons. :/ 
,rekahn,2012-12-02T17:15Z,"I had the same permission problems. The mistake was pressing return after entering the cmod command. 
Follow emokids video exactly and it'll work, good job mate!"
,MacPro5,2012-12-02T21:46Z,The video really helped. Thanks a lot.
,jcl1,2012-12-02T23:50Z,"If I use this on the steam version, will it break anything like multiplayer etc?"
