download this torrent and play the reloaded version ;)"
,Be-ez1,2012-11-26T00:49Z,"Hotspur77, looks like I'll have to do that. The last two repacks I tried were buggy. I get to a point in sequence 5 where a lock I'm supposed to pick wont break, so I'm hoping to just skip ahead. I have to wait 16 hours for the reloaded version to dl though lol. Great game so far."

,Whodi,2012-11-27T16:01Z,Hotspur77 I already tried that one. The game freezes up 2 minutes in. I need a save from after that mission- anything like mission 2 or 3 in sequence 8 or sequence 9. Just anything that comes after the one you uploaded. Even sequence 9 would do. And Thanks man!
