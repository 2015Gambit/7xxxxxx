These are the Marvel comics I got from the week beginning 11/21/2012.  These are not a complete list of what Marvel put out this week.  There are other torrents for that. There are 10 titles in this week's offering. All comics are either in CBR or CBZ format and are labeled individually.  Please do not share my descriptions or torrent ads with anyone without messaging me first.  If this torrent has no seeds please msg me privately.  I will be glad to reup anything that has no seeds.  I sincerely ask that if you like what you get, please purchase them in some way.  We cannot do what we do if there is nothing being made to scan and upload.

Starting with the first week of November, I will be releasing a new pack with only the Marvel Now comics.  I will still carry this torrent as well as my DC Universe 52, Zero Day, and Independent comics packs.  If you would like to help, please let me know.  

Starting with the first week of December, this particular torrent will change its name to Total Marvel.  I will be changing the format of this release to include all "Marvel Universe" releases.  This means books from the Marvel Universe, Marvel NOW! line, but not anything from Disney or any of the children's lines.  Those will still be released in the Zero Day torrent.  This means that I will be releasing five packs a week including:

DC Universe 52 (Wednesdays based on scanners release times, but not later than Friday morning)
Marvel NOW! (Marvel Comics in the NOW! universe will be released Wednesdays, based on scanners release times)
Total Marvel (All Marvel Universe comics, released on Thursday, based on scanners release times)
Zero Day (Marvel, DC and Independent comics, released between Saturday night and Sunday afternoon)
Independent Scanners (from scanners not affiliated with groups, released on Mondays)
DC Monthly (all DC Universe comics for the month, released the first Friday after the end of the month)
Total Marvel Monthly (all Marvel Universe comics, released the first Tuesday after the end of the month)
