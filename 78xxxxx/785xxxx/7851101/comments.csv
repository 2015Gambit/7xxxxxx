,VampCel,2012-11-22T18:17Z,Game doesnt even start up for me
,jKlark,2012-11-22T18:25Z,"BTW, to those concerned if this is legit or not, take a look at my version 1 of the crack, and read the majority of positive comments from different people here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7835317/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_II_REAL_Proper_Crack_-jKlark"
,mcukki123,2012-11-22T18:29Z,"I was really skeptical at first and scanned this at least 5 times, but no virus and it actually works! I got past the part it used to crash on me every time. Thanks!
Also, if some people don't know yet, Black ops 2 doesn't support windows xp so that could be your problem."
,tonin_haggard,2012-11-22T19:39Z,"It does NOT work, it lags and csrashes as hell :O"
,Josue2899,2012-11-22T20:26Z,"Mmm, its working for me... I start a new campaign and the only crash i got is on the POTUS mision, defending Anderson, i failed and exactly on that moment it crash. I'll try later if it passes :P"
,ashref,2012-11-22T21:58Z,"didn't works for me, same as all cracks i'v tried before"
,Zerrb,2012-11-22T22:59Z,"This isn't related to your crack but... I can't start the game at all, I double click the shortcut and absolutely NOTHING happens. I formatted my PC today, so I take it that I am missing something. Any idea what exactly?"
,rutavi,2012-11-23T03:04Z,"Awesome upload,solved issues with freezing.THANKS Jklark"
,jKlark,2012-11-23T08:28Z,@Zerrb Try installing Steam...

,bobcool09,2012-11-24T03:03Z,"Scanned with both Avast and Microsoft Security Essentials, so there's no virus
Most likely doesn't allow zombies as it replaces the Single Player .exe and doesn't have a zombie one too.
It starts up (Big +, none of the cracks I tried before worked)
Dolby part was very laggy, the Treyarch/Activision was a little sped up it seemed.
Opening cutscene is laggy, but it gets better as it goes.
So far so good! Haven't gotten into any actually gameplay yet though"
,bobcool09,2012-11-24T03:29Z,"So, it works, it got a little wierd on the boat when I was shooting people, like my comp went in between the game and my desktop.
But, very playable!
So excitedd!!!"
,scalar,2012-11-24T07:55Z,"My game crashed occasionally on your previous patch, now this one works fine. thanks a lot jklark and kudos to you for helping people play! I'll seed this to at least a 10 ratio!"
,Durifon,2012-11-24T11:09Z,"It didn't even startup until I install Steam, and then, it worked great!
Thxs a lot!"
,quebramar,2012-11-24T13:57Z,"crack v.2 ta a trabalhar bem!! 
obrigado jklark"
,Riga11,2012-11-24T17:45Z,"My Zombies doesn't launch with this crack D: I double click t6zm.exe and the process appears for about 10 seconds then it's gone.
Other and that, the game works great! Played until the end with no issues."
,Riga11,2012-11-24T17:57Z,"I guess it'll be a while until we see a SP Zombies crack. However, this one was very good :D played until the end with no problems except the shitty choices I made during the Campaign :P"
,bobcool09,2012-11-25T01:54Z,"So I just flew and defeated some of mendez's guys, but when I was going into the temple the screen started jitterring and I couldn't move or anything.
However, I Ctrl-Alt-Del'd out and when I clicked back in The screen was black but when I clicked I could hear myself shooting, and when I threw a grenade I heard it. When I hit escape my mouse came up but nothing else. When I went over the invisible menu options, I heard the chink.
Solution?"
,bobcool09,2012-11-25T04:13Z,"PROTIP: As soon as the game starts, open up task manager, then go to the processes tab. Look for t6sp.exe (It has the description Call of Duty: Black Ops II) then right click, hover over change priority, then click ""High"" (It won't let you do realtime), click Accept, and then your game will run faster"
,notnowplz,2012-11-25T12:56Z,"@bobcool09

samething here!......Errrrrrr"
,bobcool09,2012-11-25T17:56Z,"@notnowplz I restarted the game and had to redo the mission, and when I got to that part I ran ahead of all the people and it didn't happen"
,Qajs1,2012-11-26T02:52Z,Can't seem to load zombies....
,philipe89,2012-11-26T13:24Z,dont work for me
,random425,2012-11-27T04:52Z,"A weird issue popped up. I start the game and I get black screen. But then I tried bringing up the Task Manager as soon as I start the game. At this point, though I was out of the game, I could hear the audio of the intro video running. But as soon as I go back into the game, it freezes up. 

Win 7, Steam running, everything up to date.

Ideas/solutions? Thanks in advance."
,nadelyn,2012-11-29T06:41Z,The first of many cracks to work!!! THANKSS!! :D
,bobcool09,2012-11-30T03:09Z,"Update please?
My game keeps freezing but the non-cutscene sounds still play whenever I'm at the table in the mission in the desert in the 70's.
Before this, it worked really well!!"
