Trolls of Troy is a French comic series published by Soleil Productions. It is a spin-off series of Lanfeust of Troy and is created by author Scotch Arleston and writer Jean-Louis Mourier. Since 1997, 14 volumes have been published in French. The series is also translated in Polish, Dutch, German and Spanish. Troy is a fascinating world where magic is involved in the daily lives of all. Everyone indeed has a power, small or large, more or less useful. One has the gift to freeze water into ice, the other to melt the metal at a glance.

On Troy, we find all sorts of creatures, but the more troublesome to human beings are without a doubt the Trolls. But, these fearsome predators are friendly. They hunt dragons, gather peasants and have countless recipes for cooking them.  Two centuries before Lanfeust's story, this is the humorous adventure of a savage troll and a young girl.
