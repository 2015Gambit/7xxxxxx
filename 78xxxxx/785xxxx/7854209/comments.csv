,BlackeyeVuk,2012-11-23T19:36Z,"Oooh damn. Thank you. Shame Nexus 2 didnt make it on kickstarter. Bad advertisement i guess.

I really hope they somehow manage to fund and create it."
,ZtorkX86,2012-11-23T20:34Z,"Ah, awesome! Thanks. Yeah, shame about Nexus 2. Hopefully they'll make another with perhaps better marketing and less goal (quite the nichĂŠ genre)."
