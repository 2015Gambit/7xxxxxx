In the late twenty-third century, the gala maiden voyage of the third Starship Enterprise (NCC-1701-B) boasts such luminaries as Pavel Chekov, Montgomery Scott and the legendary Captain James T. Kirk as guests. But the maiden voyage turns to disaster as the unprepared ship is forced to rescue two transport ships from a mysterious energy ribbon. The Enterprise manages to save a handful of the ships&#x27; passengers and barely makes it out intact... but at the cost of Captain Kirk&#x27;s life. Seventy-eight years later, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-D find themselves at odds with the renegade scientist Soran... who is destroying entire star systems. Only one man can help Picard stop Soran&#x27;s scheme... and he&#x27;s been dead for seventy-eight years.
