Overview:

Picking up immediately where original Myst ended, you are presented the privilege, challenge, and responsibility of restoring the lost empire of the D'ni--an ancient civilization of people who thrived for thousands of years before they met with a great catastrophe. Like each previous Myst title, Myst V: End of Ages advances the graphical beauty and detail of its worlds to create an environment that is so real you feel almost like youΓÇÖre living in it. Cyan carefully crafted and combined elements of adventure, puzzles, storyline, and gameplay innovation creating a worthy ending to the one game to which millions will forever compare any adventure title--Myst.

Myst 5: End of Ages brings the marvelous story presented in the series to a very satisfying and definitive end. This is one of those games where you keep the whole end-credits rolling while you submerge yourself in thoughts of what you have just experienced and how incredible it was. It is even a little sad that this is it but every great story has to have an end and this is clearly the conclusion the series deserved.
