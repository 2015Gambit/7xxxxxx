Your other torrent,

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7772550/Mechanical_Engineering_-_2010kaiser

Is stuck @68% and everybody is asking to seed that one. Please look into this one."
[V],2010kaiser,2012-11-25T00:33Z,"burt007:

I've re-loaded that torrent to re-seed it. If there's any problem with it or ANYONE needs a torrent seeded. Post the re-seed request on my latest torrent, whatever that may be. That way i can get to it quickly to re-seed as i can't watch ALL my torrents given the number of them.

Hope this helps you guys out."
