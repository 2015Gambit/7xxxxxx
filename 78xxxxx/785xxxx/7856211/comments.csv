,OmniNegro,2012-11-24T16:52Z,"Bullshit. The game is available as a ""Pre-Load"" and will not unlock until the 28th.

Details are here.

Fucking scammer."
,lordsargo,2012-11-24T16:58Z,"So the game isn't playable?

Will I need to download a crack on 28th or will I be able to just play?"
,karlosss999,2012-11-24T18:05Z,"Well at the page linked in description the info section is pretty explanatory:


UNRAR
WAIT FOR CRACK

So, no this seems to not be playable. I think this is just the data-pile you pre-load with the purchase. We will get to play at RELEASE TIME + TIME IT'LL TAKE TO CRACK IT.

@OmniNegro Yes, the title is misleading, but watch your tongue - remember that internet is as polite (at large) to you, as you are to it. You get to reap only that what you have sown.

Over&Out"
,nastypants,2012-11-24T20:39Z,"Why should I visit that link just to find out the description 'FULL UNLOCKED' is bogus?

There's no good reason to download a torrent that no-one can verify for days, and it's something we keep seeing.

My guess is there's a survey in there too.

Based on the misleading description alone, this torrent should be deleted.
Just look at this suers other torrents, there's a pattern ehre.

And poor choice of name too."
,ZtorkX86,2012-11-24T21:24Z,Simply put FULL UNLOCKED = P2P release without crack. Either download and wait for scene crack or wait for scene release with crack.
,fishboy11,2012-11-25T00:33Z,"full unlocked doesnt mean a game is crack, unlocked means the pre-load files have been decrypted so that all you need is the crack to be able to play, whereas if it where the preload files you would need the manifest files with the encryption key to decrypt them, so unlock doesnt mean its cracked it means its an unlocked preload, basically the same as what would come on a retail cd."
,STONEDSTONER,2012-11-25T12:12Z,fishboy11 shut the fuck up noob
,zeroeight,2012-11-26T00:46Z,"WTF is wrong with all the stupid internet retards.

Something CANNOT BE FULL UNLOCKED if there is no crack AS well as it cannot be played yet to check to see if all the content is there.

Fucking idiots."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-26T04:35Z,"You know what TPB removes torrents for?
1. Illegal stuff? Nope.
2. Stolen stuff. Nope.
3. Incorrect labels. Yes.

Figure this simple concept out. Calling it full unlocked when it is not is enough to have it deleted. I am not interested in pursuing that. I would rather people just bother to learn and say it exactly as it is.

I do not know if you are a scammer or not Skidrowz, but your name and track record sure suggest you are."
,prodallasosoft,2012-11-26T05:58Z,"I am disappointed that one of the best games out there has come to this at the finest torrent site in the world. Only thing any of us can do at this point is wait for full release and the greatest crackers in the world can get their hands wet once again. Can't wait for the game release,still play ps2 all the time, come on people, lets show some courtesy to  Skidrowz whether we like the torrent or not! Being human is a fragile condition! Baldurs Gate Rocks..............."
,zeroeight,2012-11-27T04:20Z,"Will people stop saying things like ""I can't wait until this is released""

This already is fucking released what do you think this torrent is.

People should say I CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THIS HAS BEEN CRACKED.

Idiots!"
,slepth,2012-11-28T06:54Z,"Missing another 500MB. Should be around 1.8GB.

,Xaenor,2012-11-28T17:15Z,"zeroeight, you are so clueless it's even funny. The actual release is 4 hours from now, and it was more than a day from your message. Pre-download does not equal release, and if you don't understand that, then look at the mirror next time you yell ""Idiot!"", please.

Hopefully this torrent will be updated when Overhaul decides to unlock the game. No point in downloading a client that is not full yet."
,michal_ssj,2012-11-30T10:10Z,"Guys, I have a very strange problem with this game. 

It seems to work properly but when the first cinematic shows up it freezes. The only way to proceed is by skipping it by a double-click. Then again - everything seems to work, I can create a character and so on but when the actual game is supposed to start it crashes to desktop. I tried reinstalling the game and even downloaded it from a different torrent but every time I have exactly the same problem. 

Please, help me. I've been waiting for this game for months."
