For a small size, it's worth a look. Slow and haunting is this really old Johnny Cash.
Smallest resolution I've ever seen and it doesn't look awful. Not bad at all.

I dropped this file into VirtualDub, went to 00:50.417 "copy frame to clipboard"
Opened IrFanView, pasted, then trimmed off 8 columns to save as 300x172 jpg
The picture you see for this is that frame of virtually the same quality as video.

JOHNNY CASH LYRICS 'Hurt'
(originally by Nine Inch Nails)

I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything

[Chorus:]
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

(You stay the hell away from me, ya hear?)

I wear this crown of thorns
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here

[Chorus:]
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know goes away
In the end
And you could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt

If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
I would find a way
