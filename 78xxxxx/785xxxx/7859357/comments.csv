,55trucker,2012-11-27T18:27Z,"Nice work, many thx for all your effort..

has ANYONE recorded & up loaded the entire sky broadcast in 720p?

I haven't found the pre race & post race in 720p as of yet.

The BBC broadcast signed off not too long after the podium ceremonies and all that extra coverage on Sky isn't there on the BBC. "
