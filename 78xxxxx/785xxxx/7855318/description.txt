The only easy thing about Jude and LucyΓÇÖs relationship is their love for one another. Everything else is hard.

Especially when it comes to reigning in JudeΓÇÖs trigger touch temper and LucyΓÇÖs increasing jealousy of JudeΓÇÖs Spirit Sister on the cheer squad whoΓÇÖs attached herself to him in just about every way a girl could. Feeling the stress of trying to hang on to her quintessential bad boy while becoming the foremost dancer in her class, Lucy knows somethingΓÇÖs going to break. She wants both. She needs both. But if she doesnΓÇÖt make a choice, she risks losing everything.

For Lucy Larson and Jude Ryder, love might be the thing that just isnΓÇÖt enough.
