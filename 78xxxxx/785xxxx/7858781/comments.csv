,Playit96,2012-11-25T16:34Z,"What the hell is this? ""Hackers"" is not officially a trilogy... There's the weak Angelina Jolie film, then what? I know some people like to say ""Takedown"" (or ""Trackdown"") is ""Hackers 2"", but there's no connection between them - and the Mitnick film, at least, is a better story!... Then what? What's the third one? ""Antitrust""? How the hell does anyone combine these movies in a trilogy?

And why is it that the whole bunch is archived, making it impossible to download just one of the films, instead of the whole set?

Amateurs... or worse. "
