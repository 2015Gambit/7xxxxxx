Learn More, Study Less - Scott H Young

If you understand something in only one way, then you don't really understand it at all. the secret of what anything means to us depends on how we've connected it to all other things we knw. well-connected representations let you turn ideas around in your mind, to envision things from many perspectives until  you find the one that works for you. and that's what we mean be thinking.
