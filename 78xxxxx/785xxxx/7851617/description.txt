Annandale Urban House - A tough council and heritage buildings on two sides. This block spelled trouble, but passionate builders Brett and Rees are determined to see their 21st century townhouse come to life. Will they have the stamina?Brett and Rees are the proud parents of three young boys and desperately need more space. They love their inner-west community in Sydney's Annandale, so the plan is to build on the small empty allotment behind their apartment. The first sod has barely been turned when one of the heritage buildings on their boundary is in danger of collapsing. Exhausted by ongoing battles and a build that's months behind schedule, will Brett and Rees have enough grit and determination to see their project through to completion?
