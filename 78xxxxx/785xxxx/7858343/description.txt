Release  Notes

VueScan is an easy-to-use replacement for the software
that came with your scanner and supports most flatbed
scanners, printer/scanners and film scanners. Over 10
million people have downloaded VueScan since it was
first released in 1998. Whether you are looking for
more advanced features that your scanner vendor doesn't

scanner.
