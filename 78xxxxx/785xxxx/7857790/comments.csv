,tapp3r,2012-11-25T17:17Z,Why is this so popular? It's obviously crap.
,Si-klops,2012-11-25T17:38Z,Looks Oscar worthy
,serb_1982,2012-11-25T20:27Z,Typical Hollywood load of crap!

,Arthzil,2012-11-25T20:36Z,Made by Asylum. Enough said.
,ksweeley,2012-11-25T20:49Z,"This looks like a mockbuster of the movie 2012, the ""Ark"" in the poster looks very similar to the one in 2012."
,dubblue4,2012-11-25T21:55Z,thanks

This looks like a mockbuster of the movie 2012, the ""Ark"" in the poster looks very similar to the one in 2012. 

It does look similar, either way gonna check it out, comment on quality later,
 thanks for the up Acesn8s"
,jblaze78,2012-11-25T23:12Z,Oscar worthy!?  Really!?
,nobodynever,2012-11-26T00:03Z,"Look out Shawshank! Move over The Departed!  It's 40 Days and Nights.  Which is also exactly how long it took to produce this movie, start to finish. "
,jpmcnown,2012-11-26T00:08Z,"@jblaze78, Oscar Wilde once said that ""sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, but the highest form of intelligence"". Clearly, suggesting that this film is ""Oscar Worthy"", was sarcasm.

I watched it, and frankly, I rank this movie down among the likes of ""Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus""

Audio-10
Video-10
Movie-01
Acting-Wait, that wasn't a documentary?
Honorable Mention-Extended scenes of cold wet tshirt action might distract you from the dialogue, and that's a good thing.
Drinking Game-Take a shot whenever something really obvious happens. Wait, no, that will certainly kill you. Please drink responsibly. "
,exe1951,2012-11-26T06:28Z,CHEEP A10 V10 I THINK MY GRANDSON'S 5th grade class made the movie.

,3juddy3,2012-11-26T10:43Z,I am downloading this solely for the extended wet t shirt scenes. Thanks for that comment. Spoiler???
,Phatfish,2012-11-26T13:54Z,"I laugh quietly to my self reading these comments.
The comments in themselves aren't funny but that no one have commented on the extremely ignorant movie title proves that not only are there no women on the internet but only 12 year olds. "
,babybluetits24,2012-11-26T18:47Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2439946/ no imdb score yet but sounds like the film sucks !

The US churches have way to much money. Time to start taxing these mothafvckas, cause that's the type of projects they invest.
