,themrdr,2012-11-25T20:46Z,"I've noticed starting in episode 583 album art tags were included in the tracks. lavf pretends this is a stream with one frame, and in mplayer this causes nasty buffer fill errors when it tries to read the next video frame, demuxing the entire file and all the other streams in the process.

This also bloats the size of each track (negligibly); could the album art be placed in a separate file as was done earlier?"
