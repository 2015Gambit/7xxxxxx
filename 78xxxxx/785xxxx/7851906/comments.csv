,Mnathan19,2012-11-23T00:03Z,"Guys,justbto say
I never buy comics,i just get them at torrents and others sites ,but when i saw that one of my favorites comics,captain marvel,wasnt avalible i got really angry.
Then i remembered all the things the comics taught me,if you have the power you have the obligation to use it in favor to the society ,and decided to buy it and put on TPB.
Comics arent just a child book,if i never learned about ""power and respinsability"" you probably wouldnt be reading our favorite female superhero comic book.

P.S. You all owe me 2.99

P.S.S. Sorry if there are any gramatical errors ,i m not american nor english.

P.S.S.S with great power comes great responsibility"
