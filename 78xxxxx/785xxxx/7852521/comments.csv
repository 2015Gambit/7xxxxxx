There is bots in the missions. Bandit bots, and other survivors that are there to team up with you or kill you.

They have random loot!

Oh and yes you can now use a hatchet as a weapon. I know in my previous DayZ missions you couldn't."
,Lexie._.,2012-11-23T06:22Z,"TESTED ON DayZ build 1.7.4.4 (Latest as of now) IT WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!!

Please use 1.7.3.  Its still very new and has all the features except weapon durability."
,Lexie._.,2012-11-23T07:02Z,"Feel free to request any other map that you want to be converted into single player. I'll get my friends that converted these missions into single player. 

Then of course uploaded on TPB !
"
,Lexie._.,2012-11-23T07:17Z,"Want a DayZ map converted to  a single player mission?

Feel free to suggest which one i should have my friends convert next !

And i'll ask the same people who converted this one to convert the map you guys wanted !"
,Gameboy4,2012-11-23T07:40Z,"I can confirm that this works as said on 1.7.3, how do you use cheats, and thank you for this! "
,Lexie._.,2012-11-23T08:01Z,"Press ""0"" then press ""0"" again then it should pop up the cheat menu.

,jaypukes,2012-11-23T08:54Z,thatnks man.. offline right?
,Lexie._.,2012-11-23T09:00Z,Yes offline !
,motley666,2012-11-23T14:20Z,683 kilobytes???
,Lexie._.,2012-11-23T21:03Z,"Yes 683kbs, mission files aren't large. Check your own mission folder in your arma directory. "
,crazyshadowdami,2012-11-24T13:59Z,i thought singleplayer was disabled in 1.7.2.4.? and this is for 1.7.3.?
,crazyshadowdami,2012-11-24T18:27Z,"also, do i really need the 1.62 oa patch? i hate the gun damage reduction. also, where do download dayz 1.7.3 patch?"
,Lexie._.,2012-11-25T01:18Z,Use Dayzcommander or find the download link to 1.7.3 on here tpb. Single player is disabled in the latest 1.7.4.4 update.
,crazyshadowdami,2012-11-25T13:28Z,"thx but, do i need the 1.62 OA patch?"
,crazyshadowdami,2012-11-25T14:17Z,"damn, i spawn in the middle of the woods, with no gear at all, and im invisible in 3rd person. so, i guess i need the patch?"
,dubsnax,2012-11-25T18:07Z,"It appears there are no zombies or loot in zargabad. Takastan has the HUD for DayZ but the character model is a soldier from normal arma 2 and 3rd person wouldn't seem to work. the bots always only carry a map, large backpack, pistol, and 8 magazines for said pistol.  Chernarus worked great except the bots identical inventories. how do they survive with no food or water? "
,dubsnax,2012-11-25T18:10Z,Also I couldn't get any of the bots to not shoot at me. Is there a special way to have them be friendly?
,Lexie._.,2012-11-26T00:37Z,"1.62 patch is needed.

There is friendly bots, sometimes if you go to a church you will find them and they will team up with you and follow you, kill zombies and bandits."
,spartanhero93,2012-11-26T05:17Z,I want to change the time but it says that that the script for time.sqf what can i do?
,spartanhero93,2012-11-26T05:17Z,that im missing that .sqf file
,crazyshadowdami,2012-11-26T14:40Z,goddammit. i really really dont like the damage reduction!!! >:(((((((((((
,Lexie._.,2012-11-26T22:35Z,"You can always switch back versions crazyshadowdami.

spartanhero93, you can try looking up the files on google. I'm going to ask my friends that made these mission files to see if they have the settime.sqf file."
,spartanhero93,2012-11-27T05:13Z,"never mind i can change the time by changing the time on my computer, do vehicles spawn? Thanks for the missions btw"
,spartanhero93,2012-11-27T05:15Z,on chernaraus
,crazyshadowdami,2012-11-27T12:56Z,"yup, the vehicles spawn"
,Lexie._.,2012-11-28T03:47Z,"I uploaded settime.sqf to Mediafire

,UpEagle,2012-11-28T21:41Z,"Do I put these in the missions folder of the Arma II OA directory? When I run the single player mission it starts to load, then gives me an error message:
You cannot play/edit this mission; it is dependent on downloadable content that has been deleted.dayz_code, dayz_weapons, dayz_equip, dayz_vehicles

Please help if you can I really want to play Namalsk single player :)"
,Lexie._.,2012-11-30T03:34Z,"You put the mission files in your missions folder its in your Arma 2 directory.

Download the latest Namalsk from DayZCommander. It will work then!"
,IAMBBMK,2012-11-30T22:25Z,"So you have to play this on Dayz 1.7.3 and Arma 2 OA on 1.6.2? Can you play it on a newer version besides 1.6.2? If you do have to play it on 1.6.2 then where can I find a download link for it? Whenever I find one it patches the Arma 2 OA launcher instead of DayZ.bat (which is how I can play DayZ)? There are many weird glitches such as no character model when in 3rd person, No buildings or anything, No zombies NPCs or loot, and no HUD! Is that because I am playing on 1.6.0?"
,IAMBBMK,2012-11-30T23:48Z,Nevermind I figured it out! :D
,IAMBBMK,2012-12-01T19:08Z,"Okay I have everything working except Namalsk. I updated it to the latest build using DayZ Commander and it still gives the error code You cannot play/edit this mission; it is dependent on downloadable content that has been deleted.namalsk, Do you know a fix? I really want to play it!"
,Lexie._.,2012-12-02T05:00Z,Try Namaslk 0.55  that is what that mission file was built on so it should be guaranteed to work!
