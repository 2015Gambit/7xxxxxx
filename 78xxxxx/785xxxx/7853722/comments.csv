,shevilian,2012-11-24T20:52Z,slow download
,Steerage,2012-11-24T21:39Z,"The plot is probably written that way because the car is probably American, probably."
,NotPopular2,2012-11-25T03:49Z,"The new season is going to be great. There are some video clips on YouTube on them filming it.

,ashleyhat,2012-11-30T03:51Z,"A=10

No Richard Hammond, and it's pretty boring. Watch this if you want to know the specs of a bunch of british cars from the 70's. I'm a huge Top Gear fan but this was mediocre. "
