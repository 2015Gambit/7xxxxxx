FRONTLINE spent months following three young girls who are growing up against the backdrop of their families' struggles against financial ruin. The result is an intimate portrait of the economic crisis as it's rarely seen, through the eyes of children. Poor Kids is an unflinching and revealing exploration of what poverty means to children, and to the country's future.
