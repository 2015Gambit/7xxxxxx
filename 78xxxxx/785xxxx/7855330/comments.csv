,kiwi320,2012-11-24T10:38Z,"Is it just me or at around 26 minutes in does the sound start to get all choppy?

I just updated video drivers, VLC, codecs, etc, restarted PC, still choppy."
,four20snakeman,2012-11-24T12:26Z,"@kiwi320

I noticed the same thing. there's a few minutes of sound distortion around the 26-35ish minute marks."
,ziggyff,2012-11-24T13:07Z,"YES, I NOTICED THE SOUND PROBLEM AS WELL, went looking for another copy of the video, else we're stuck with this..it does clear up later"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-24T15:59Z,"The Dirt takes the previous week's episode and includes unseen footage, brief aftershow interviews, and incorporates tweets or something like that.

Sorry about the sound, didn't notice that or else I wouldn't have released it."
,craddle,2012-11-24T16:42Z,Sound is messed up starting at the 25min mark.
,craddle,2012-11-24T16:47Z,"No sound issues:

,nobodynever,2012-11-25T02:09Z,"I am quite embarrassed that I enjoy this show so much.  But since we're all here for the same thing, I think I'm safe.

Thanks, the projectfreetv isn't working for shit and I'm glad you take the time to ul this. Kindof a thankless job."
