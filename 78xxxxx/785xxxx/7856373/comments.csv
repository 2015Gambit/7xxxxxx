i guess i'm too late so good luck with the results"
,NIT158,2012-11-25T05:40Z,"for those who have doubts on movie quality...
the movie was made from 16mm film stock and without lighting..
Probably the cheapest movie ever with a budget of $6000

But worth watching coz its a Christopher Nolan movie .. "
