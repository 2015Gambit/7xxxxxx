Pianist Myra Melford, bassist Mark Dresser, and drummer Matt Wilson perform
seven intriguing originals on this CD. To simplify the improvising a bit, it
hints strongly in spots of Cecil Taylor, the percussiveness of Don Pullen, and
of Keith Jarrett's '70s inside/outside music without sounding like a copy of
any of those predecessors. The interplay between the three musicians is
consistently exciting and, while Melford is the main soloist, Dresser has some
spots on bowed bass while Wilson's supportive contributions should not be
overlooked. The performances are consistently unpredictable, drawing upon much
of jazz history of the past 40 years while creating new and fresh music. This
set grows in interest with each listen and contains some of Melford's finest
playing to date.
