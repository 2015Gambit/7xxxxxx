Album: This New Year Will Be For You And Me
Artist: Lacrosse
Year: 2007

Not sure what to say...found these guys on youtube and couldn't find the album on the pirate bay. Stumbled across the album on kickass torrents (I think?) and figured I'd share it here!


12 tracks. Upbeat, playful, pop sound. Not much in English on the interwebz about these guys, but from a German wikipedia page, it sounds like they're based out of Stockholm. This album was their first full-length (2007).
