,Avenager,2012-11-23T00:00Z,"I have a question, where is your save game folder? I have a theta crack and when I apply yours there is no save game. So I found theta save game and I want copy it to your folder but where it is?"
,kaliver,2012-11-23T00:26Z,"well, first of all, theta is not a scene group. their releases aren't considered as such. second, skidrow's release is a hacked together crack of an old uplay launcher from prior AC games. reloaded goes the same route that theta did in circumventing uplay completely, while at the same time preserving metadata in saves which theta's crack does not. "
,RedStash,2012-11-23T03:36Z,"Works perfectly and only needed to copy 3 files into the installed directory.

Just use AssassinsCreed3.exe to play game. Might want to wait a while for some patches to come out, though. It still seems like this game is kind of buggy based on reading through comments."
,grdzero,2012-11-23T10:03Z,Nicely done!

,dis_dat,2012-11-23T14:02Z,"Hello!

I lost my savefile earlier and I cannot get it back. I was at Sequence 9 when uplay.exe crashed and deleted my temporarly access to AC3.

So, if anyone out there is currently on sequence 9, or around 9, it'd be SO so so so awesome if you could send it too me so I dont have to do it ALL over again! >.< I'd appreciate it ALOT!

The problem occurs after the cinema when the forrest women shows you the wall with the paintings etc, and they kiss blabla. Anyway the problem is that nothing happens after that. The game just stops, nothing more. And when I relaunch the game after exiting I start in the fortress agian. Please help anyone!"
