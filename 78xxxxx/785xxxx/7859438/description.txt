IMDB Info:
A well-heeled family from tony neighborhood of New Delhi travels from the city through dusty roads that lead into the village in Haryana, far out and buried in the debris of the past. Shreya, the tomboy of the family, finally arrives at her father's village for the first time during her vacations, that too after coaxing her father, Dev, to the best of her abilities. She and her brother, Sam, had, in their imagination, spun the village right out of a fairytale, replete with streams, lakes and grasslands that will allow them to run free. But all they find are dusty alleys, dried up ponds and hostile playmates until they spin their magic and befriend this unknown place, especially some of its people, like the Pehelwan and the gang of kids led by Ajithe. The story revolves around Shreya and Sam's adventures and misadventures which turn this dull place bereft of water into a land of enchantment...
