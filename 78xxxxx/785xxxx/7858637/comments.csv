Hi NLUPPER
Thank You For Replying

First, if you have PAL version of any movie it is the best. I do not need NTSC. 
I mean if you do not get the PAL version for some movie then NTSC can work. 
Any ONE will do , not both.


For...  The Heroes Of Telemark (1965)

Nordic with English Menu is good, I think.
But can you PLZZZZ  put in English subtitles in the movie. No need to EDIT the MENU. 
Jst the ENG subs in the main movie file.
Eng subtitles for this movie is available on the internet BUT I do not know how to put Subtitles in a DVDR.
PLZZZ  if AND WHENEVER you get the time.


For ......  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)

I found your release :
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7245980/Tinker_Tailor_Soldier_Spy_(2011)_PAL_Retail_DVDR_NL_subs

If you can put proper ENGLISH Subtitles in it and re-upload it. Its fine. No need to EDIT Menu.
Or if you find anythIng NEW with ENG subs then it is Good.

Your Super Work on the uploading of the movie Hindenburg (1975) , has made us Greedy  
:-)  :-)
Plzzz  if you get time ....


THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING US
TAKE CARE"

@ maxelan ....

I can see that YOU really are trying to tell NLUPPER007 exactly how to 
create DVD-Uploads so that YOU will accept them .... ( ""Customized for YOU"" ) ....

I allso can see that YOU paste out the same requests to 
different uploaders here at The Pirate Bay ....

Maybe YOU should start to upload movies YOURSELF,  so
they become exactly how YOU want them .... ( ? )

/ YOU'RE welcome !"

Why is it bothering u so much ??
I enjoy NLUPPER uploads.
And NLUPPER does keep our requests so we request.
This is why we don't request ppl like you . . . who give a whole lot of advises which aren't very helpful.

If NLUPPER does not get irritated with our requests why is tht you are so bothered ??
If NLUPPER says something, I accept tht.
But not from you . . .

It wud be very helpful to a lot of us who enjoy NLUPPER uploads if you would be so KIND as to mind your own business
It might jst help you out too.

Thanks and Regards"
