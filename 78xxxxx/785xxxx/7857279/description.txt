The Blue's fiercest warrior returns as FATHOM: KIANI vol 2 concludes! It is civil war amongst the Blue under the surface and no one may survive in this Fathom Universe-shattering conclusion! Kiani and her dissidents find themselves with only one option left in their campaign against Siphon and the Elite Council-they must battle his immeasurable forces for their survival...or die! Yet, the tragedy of events leading to this regrettable war between their own-kind will pale to the shocking actions taken by those who Kiani once trusted! Alliances will be broken, cities will fall and the world of Fathom will never be the same again! Brought to you by the creative team of Vince Hernandez, Oliver Nome and John Starr, FATHOM: KIANI vol 2 #4 is a must have for any Fathom fan!
