Office 2013 - Office 15 if you are keeping track of the version numbers - ahead of the release date, as is de rigueur these days. This means mere mortals like you and us can download a consumer preview of the new offering ahead of the official launch later in the year.

Just because you can, it doesn't mean you should. So weΓÇÖve downloaded the new suite of applications to find out whatΓÇÖs what, to save you the bother. 

SkyDrive takes you to the cloud
Regardless of what new features Word 2013 offers, or how PowerPoint 2013 will make your sales pitches better, the main crux of Office 2013 is taking you in the cloud. ItΓÇÖs the buzzword at the moment and Microsoft, like Apple and Google, wants you to accept this new way of keeping your files. 

Now everything can be stored in the cloud, your documents, presentations and spreadsheets - all ready to be accessed from whatever device you happen to have to hand, be it a tablet, a PC, or your phone.

Central to that offering is MicrosoftΓÇÖs SkyDrive service. Office saves documents to SkyDrive by default, so your content is always available on all your devices, but unlike Google Docs you wonΓÇÖt need to be online to access them, only to sync them.
