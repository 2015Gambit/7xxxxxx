Honey (Turkish: Bal) is a 2010 Turkish drama film directed by Semih Kaplanoglu, the third and final installment of the "Yusuf Trilogy", which includes Egg and Milk. It premiered on 16 February 2010 in competition at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival, where it became the third Turkish film, after Susuz Yaz in 1964, to win the Golden Bear award. The film, which went on general release across Turkey on 9 April 2010, was selected as TurkeyΓÇÖs official candidate for the Best Foreign Film Oscar at the 83rd Academy Awards but it didn't make the final shortlist.

In the remote and undeveloped eastern Black Sea region, a six-year-old boy (Yusuf) wanders through the woods searching for his lost father, trying to make sense of his life. His father is a beekeeper whose bees have disappeared unexpectedly, threatening his livelihood. A bizarre accident kills the father. There is little dialogue or music in the film. The three main characters (Yusuf and his parents) are all fairly taciturn, and the soundtrack is filled out with the sounds of the forest and the creatures that live there. The environment is a recurring theme.
