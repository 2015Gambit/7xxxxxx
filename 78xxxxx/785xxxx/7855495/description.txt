MDaemon 6 - Windows Mail Server System

I've had this set of files in my possession for several years, and I'm only posting it because I saw that some people were having trouble registering the other one that's on here. Several plugins are included, as well as their corresponding keygens, and keygens for incremented versions of the main program. (The registration key of the base install is included in a text file.)

I use to run this myself a long time ago (as production) on a Win2k box as a free multi-domain web-based email service. It was a VERY stable system with lots of options, and much of it is customizable (especially the web-based email client) if you spend some time learning it. After setting it up, it's just a matter of configuring it, then point your domain's MX record at your Windows box's IP address. Honestly, I miss the old days when I use to run this thing. :)

I'm only posting this for current lack of availability, and I'm sure there are likely other systems out there that you might prefer to use. This just gives you one more choice! Sorry I couldn't copy/paste the specs from thwe website, as I'm sure the original web page for this version is long gone. (If someone would like to look it up on a web archive site, feel free to copy/paste the specs.)

For anyone interested, an invitation code for YTEpisodes is included.
