I mean sure you're dedicating your time, effort and doing a service for the sharing community without any real benefit to yourself but regardless you should still be chastised for not serving content up on a silver platter in exactly the way we want it damnit!!!!

I trust you've learnt your lesson.."

To the one complaining, why not watch it on your laptop/pc with VLC? Just hook that up to your tv if you want to watch it on a big screen, most laptops these days have TV out sockets and all desktops almost always have that."
