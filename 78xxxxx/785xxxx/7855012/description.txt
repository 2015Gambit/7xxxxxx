Alice Clark - Alice Clark [1972] [Album] [1999 Toshiba EMI Ltd TOCP-50758 Japanese CD Reissue]

From DustyGroove.com:
There weren't many vocal albums on the Mainstream label during the early 70s, and this rare soul side is a real overlooked gem! Alice Clark has a rich soulful voice, with a style that sounds a bit like Esther Marrow, mixed with some of the lead vocalists in Voices Of East Harlem -a really right-on sort of sound that's totally great, and way hipper than most 70s chart soul! Arrangements are by Ernie Wilkins, who brings in a touch of jazz but again, with a much hipper feel than most of his other backings and most of the tracks are quite obscure, well-written tunes of the sort of material you might expect to hear sung by Gil Scott-Heron or Donny Hathaway.
