6 Reasons to Read This Book
Even if You Hate Cooking

YouΓÇÖll Learn How to Become World-Class in Any Skill in Record Time.

Whether you want to learn how to speak a new language in three months, how to shoot a three-pointer in one weekend, or how to memorize a deck of cards in less than a minute, the true ΓÇ£recipeΓÇ¥ of this book is exactly that: a process for acquiring any skill. The vehicle I chose is cooking. Yes, IΓÇÖll teach you all the most flexible techniques of culinary school using 14 strategically chosen meals, all with four or fewer ingredients, and all taking 5-20 minutes to prepare (literally, The 4-Hour Chef). But I wrote this book to make you a master student of all things.

Eating (And Life) Will Become High-Definition.

In China, a common greeting is ΓÇ£Chi le, mei you?ΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£Have you eaten?ΓÇ¥ This is the universal check-in. So I pose the question to you: have you really eaten? I now realize that before writing 4HC, I hadnΓÇÖt. Back then, food was either good or bad, hot or cold, spicy or not. Now, itΓÇÖs a million colors, and I can pick out the subtleties: the cilantro or tarragon, the umami savoriness, or the lack of vinegar. ItΓÇÖs like going from a 7ΓÇ│ black-and-white TV to HD. Before 4HC, much of my life was in black and white. As youΓÇÖll see, the awareness we build in the kitchen and in related adventures will affect everything. Life itself becomes high-definition.

You Will Get Into The Best Shape of Your Life.

The dishes youΓÇÖll learn, apart from desserts for ΓÇ£cheat day,ΓÇ¥ are all compliant with the Slow-Carb Diet, which has become a global phenomenon (page 74). Fat loss of 20 pounds in the first month is not uncommon. If you follow this book, you wonΓÇÖt have to think about following a diet, since itΓÇÖs built in. If you ever decide to follow another diet, youΓÇÖll be twice as effective, because youΓÇÖll understand how to manipulate and maximize food.

It DoesnΓÇÖt Take Much to Become Impressive.

In the first 24 hours, IΓÇÖll take you from burning scrambled eggs to osso buco, one of the most expensive menu items in the world. If 28% of Americans canΓÇÖt cook at all, and if another third are on some variation of mac and cheese, having even one seemingly difficult meal up your sleeve puts you in rare company. Make that two bulletproof meals and you can host impressive dinner parties for the rest of your life.

Cooking is The Mating Advantage.

If youΓÇÖre looking to dramatically improve your sex life, or to catch and keep ΓÇ£the one,ΓÇ¥ cooking is the force multiplier. Food has a crucial role in well-planned seduction for both sexes, whether in long-term relationships (ΓÇ£MLBJ,ΓÇ¥ page 234) or on first dates (Sexy-Time Steak, page 186). For real romantic superpowers, learn how to teach the skill of tasting (Learning to ΓÇ£TasteΓÇ¥, page 50).

Because ItΓÇÖs Fun.

The ΓÇ£practicalΓÇ¥ fails more than weΓÇÖd like to admit. IΓÇÖll take breaks in this book as often as necessary to keep you amused. Food marathons? Check (page 468). Hysterical kitchen lore anecdotes? Tons. Eating 14,000 calories in 20 minutes (page 454)? Why not?

This isnΓÇÖt a textbook. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure book. 

As Bruce Lee said, ΓÇ£Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.ΓÇ¥
