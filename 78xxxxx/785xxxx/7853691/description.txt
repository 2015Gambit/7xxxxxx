A full quality rip of Electric City for those of you who don't get along with flash ( (yahoo's player would periodically murder the quality of the streaming video, and I couldn't find any way to let it buffer). 

I ripped it straight from electriccity.yahoo.com using rtmpdump. The only other torrent I could find was a 720p screen recording, which didn't do the original justice.


Here's what mplayer says when I play one of these files:
