This is the "complete" discography of Buffalo Springfield, for the most part. Everything has a CBR of 320. 

With all 3 studio albums, I've also included 2 Bootlegs; "Fillmore West: 1967" and "The Final Concert; Long Beach; May 5th, 1968" (both in FLAC to preserve them), the 2001 "Buffalo Springfield Box Set", and the Bootleg Compilation "The Missing Herd" which was supposed to be part of the 2001 box set. "The Missing Herd" also included the highy sough after Extended Version of "Bluebird" on the 2nd disc.
