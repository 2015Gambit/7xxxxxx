About Game:

Hitman: Absolution is an action-adventure stealth game developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix. 
It is the fifth entry in the Hitman game series, and will run on IO Interactive's proprietary Glacier 2 game engine.
The game will take place in the United States, and will feature an online option. 
In addition, the game will feature "instinct mode" which will allow 47 to predict enemy patrol routes, much like the "sonar vision" that was featured in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction.
Hitman: Blood Money ended with Diana helping 47 to fake his death, in order for him to escape The Franchise. 
47 killed their leader, former FBI director Alexander Leland Cayne, though he was part of a larger secret society called Alpha Zerox. 
Diana and the rest of ICA do not know 47's whereabouts, nor does the player for certain - though the last scene shows 47 entering an Asian (possibly Chinese) establishment, asking suspiciously what they have to offer, "preferably in the back". 
The first in-depth trailer for the game shows Agent 47 storming a safe-house, and confronting Diana while she is showering. 
47 is "betrayed by those he once trusted and now hunted by the police, he suddenly finds himself at the center of a dark conspiracy and must embark on a personal journey through a corrupt and twisted world, in his search for the truth".......
