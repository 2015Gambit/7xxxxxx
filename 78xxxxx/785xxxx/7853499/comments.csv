I have the latest versions of DirectX, and graphics drives are updated. I also meet the minimum requirements. Followed install directions, never had any trouble with other nosteam torrents. 
ANY help appreciated."
,XHaloXX,2012-11-28T03:42Z,"@nosteam, dude you should stop opening your webpage in every installer, i dont care and i dont want any shit related to your webpage. you can just post it in the torrent info and thats it.

either you do it cleanly and stop advertising your shit or you will find noone left downloading your stuff.

For me, its the last time i download a shit from you."
