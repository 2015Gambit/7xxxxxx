,Autoritet,2012-11-23T00:07Z,"I tried almost every crack on PirateBay for this game. Every time I get error: Steam must be running to play this game; or black screen, and then game crashes. Help would be appreciated."

,akczean,2012-11-23T10:59Z,"Is there any one who know how to fix problem with no audio, I can play single player, but i have no audio in game, there is no problem in windows and in other games, i tried many things and nothing works !!!"
,masquemea,2012-11-23T11:40Z,"Doesn't work after following all instructions. Pre or post update, the same thing happens. Running the single player just spools up the t6sp.exe process, which takes up a lot of CPU, but nothing ever happens. Running MP and Zombies goes straight to Microsoft Windows has found an error and requesting to close the program, but I knew those wouldn't work based on the comments. Any idea why the game wouldn't start up at all other than make the fan sound like my CPU is overheating? Thanks."
,masquemea,2012-11-23T11:55Z,Doesn't work. Spools up process but nothing happens afterwards. Same as before the update. Thanks but please fix.

,Tihzz,2012-11-23T18:43Z,"Reading from the comments this doesn't look like it fixes the availabilities for offline Zombies, I'm not completely sure though, so could anyone tell me if it does fix it?"
,nandou,2012-11-23T21:31Z,"I used this sound fix and worked great. Seemed a little strange because of the name file ""sound fix.rar"" or something like that but it actually worked!

,savvas3000,2012-11-24T12:47Z,can fix at least the single player in order to finish the FUCKING game?
,Richy2012,2012-11-24T14:17Z,"Has anyone installed / used crack from this torrent and managed to complete the game without experiencing any crashes? 

With otehr cracks my game kept crashing at the same part but after applying this update and crack the crashes stopped happening but only played 10 mins more so Im not too sure if it will start crashing again. 

Also the sound went but like mentioned above just use those files / cracks and the sound will be fine. This game btw is the biggest F&# around ever, why cant it be nice and simple like it used to be? "
,SadEntity,2012-11-24T22:40Z,"Please, anybody can help me fix my pc?? One of those cracks totally destroyed my pc. I guess it's this one  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7841993/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_II_Crack_Final_-_Steam006 
it contains an infected file called buddha.dll which enabled an attacker to gain control over my pc. I have AVG and i allowed the file so it destroyed my pc.
It somehow overloads my CPU to 100% all the time till it overheats. when i started noticing this on the CPU gadget, he removed the gadget totally from windows. The only thing that stops it is running the taskmanager! I don't know why.
I removed the file to the recycle bin and blocked it on AVG, scanned the whole pc with AVG and other online scanners but it still happens.
How can i repair windows without formatting?
Plz HELP!"
,sekosonic,2012-11-25T20:58Z,"@SadEntity

I have the same problem. ANd I don't know what am I going to about the overheating CPU problem. It is so strange that when i open the task manager the fan runs normally. But when I reinstalled the game and used original crack and install this uptade the game actually works... at least for now, I passed 4 missions till now.. We'll see what's gonna happen in the future.  If you fix the problem, please write a comment."
,mrmouth,2012-11-26T04:29Z,"Check this thread out: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/igfxupdateexe-forces-cpu-to-load-100/5936cbd2-a758-4a27-946f-0bac401d56f3

Really unfortunate that nobody can crack a game anymore. It will lead to more of this. Although Im hoping that this steam006 idiot just wanted Steam info, based on him requiring you to install it and create a dump folder. The crack actually does work, but there is no reason to have Steam installed. He is trying to steal your info and accounts. Follow the steps in the link and uninstall the game."
,WillAlvers,2012-11-26T08:06Z,Worked for me TY! Fixes previous issues.
,sekosonic,2012-11-26T15:41Z,"@mrmouth

thank you so much man!!!!!! I solved my CPU problem........"
,3Dazz,2012-11-28T10:33Z,"Best update so far. I had tried all the other fixes, got the game going, but couldn't finish the 1st mission. Re downloaded Extremezone's up and tried this one and I'm into the 2nd mission with no probs. Thanks for continuing to keep trying new updates."
,Sunderas1,2012-11-28T12:15Z,"Got everything done as required. Still get the t6sp spooled up but no launch at all.... Just sits there.

Could anyone help?"

and thanks to mrmouth i solve the problem"
,coolouf,2012-11-29T16:42Z,"i can play only the first mission then it crashes when the hillo is hit by the stinger ....but the sound continus playing, i can move , shout by i can't see anything ...black screen"
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-11-29T17:09Z,"I still cant get the game to start, both BlopsII and Hitman AB wont start, is it shitty skidrow that fucked it up or the games? Because with this Codblaops2 i always get ""unhandled exception caught"" problem every time I try to start the game?!"
,JayMont89,2012-11-30T16:42Z,Thanks! worked great for me. Never had to change time zone. Played the whole game with no crashing on a win7 64bit gtx 570 settings maxed out. I don't understand why everyone is having issues. And for thoes saying this is a virus norton 360 scanned it and didnt find anything. 
,JayMont89,2012-11-30T16:47Z,I also wanted to add im using nvidia drivers 310.61. If your game is crashing might want to try out their beta drivers.
,lookito,2012-12-01T13:44Z,"Thats a solution for a bug that i found during the Cordis Die mission

SOLUTION:

""I found out if you press Alt+Tab during the cutscene before the error occurs and wait for the cutscene to end it'll let you keep playing."""
