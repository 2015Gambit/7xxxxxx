ΓÇ£Only God can make a tree,ΓÇ¥ wrote Joyce Kilmer in one of the most celebrated of poems. In Tree: A Life Story, authors David Suzuki and Wayne Grady extend that celebration in a ΓÇ£biographyΓÇ¥ of this extraordinary ΓÇö and extraordinarily important ΓÇö organism. A story that spans a millennium and includes a cast of millions but focuses on a single tree, a Douglas fir, Tree describes in poetic detail the organismΓÇÖs modest origins that begin with a dramatic burst of millions of microscopic grains of pollen. The authors recount the amazing characteristics of the species, how they reproduce and how they receive from and offer nourishment to generations of other plants and animals. The treeΓÇÖs pivotal role in making life possible for the creatures around it ΓÇö including human beings ΓÇö is lovingly explored. The richly detailed text and Robert BatemanΓÇÖs original art pay tribute to this ubiquitous organism that is too often taken for granted.
