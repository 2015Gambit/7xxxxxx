,gidiyoruz,2012-11-22T19:27Z,How do i move my savegame from Theta to Reloaded?
,G3tm3soda,2012-11-22T20:46Z,"@gidiyoruz You can't. The save game from Theta and Skidrow is not in the same format than Reloaded relase. Theta and Skidrow is .save and Reloaded is .sav

I am asking someone of you that are downloading this rease, if you can please upload the save game from Reloaded relase, when you will be at the start of Sequence 5 in game. The save game for Reloaded release is in folder C:ProgramDataOrbit54 (ProgramData is a hidden folder). Please upload all 3 files (both .sav files and .ini file) to some filesharing site, like Mediafire.
I would be so very grateful if someone would take the time and did this, because I want to play Reloaded relase, because it is less buggy, but I don't want to play 4 hours through campaign again."
,Hancock79,2012-11-22T22:05Z,don't bother with the 'ognjenosmancevic' it's just videos of him showing off how much finger talent he has doing kickflips on a miniature skateboard or his fat dad dancing.
,AbedRulezz,2012-11-22T23:22Z,seed u greedy monkeys!!!
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-23T02:12Z,"@G3tm3soda
Thought so... Tried to move the files and rename them, but did not work. Had hoped for some kind of ""converter"" or something... Too bad, i guess ill just have to go through the beginning of the campaign again..."
,G3tm3soda,2012-11-23T03:32Z,"@gidiyoruz
If you'll be playing the Reloaded version again, can you maybe upload the save game when you will be at the start of Sequence 5? Save is in folder C:/ProgramData/Orbit/54 (all 3 files). I would be very grateful to you."
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-23T10:42Z,"@G3tm3soda
Sure, i'll try to, but i don't really have much time to play atm... I have 5-6 games waiting for me + lots of assignments."
,Hotspur77,2012-11-23T19:17Z,"G3tm3soda 
when you had the save, add a link please;)"
,Sildur1,2012-11-23T19:46Z,"Heres my save from Sequence 5, i was not sure which one is the right so i uploaded 3 saves 2 of them are corrupted i think. (number 3 is the right one i think)"
,Sildur1,2012-11-23T19:48Z,Damn i can't post links here o.O
,Hotspur77,2012-11-23T20:01Z,"please send ;)

,lingjr,2012-11-23T20:06Z,"so I followed the unclear instructions as clear as I could, copied and overwrote the crack, blocked both uplay apps and all three AC3 apps (inbound and outbound) yet when i run autorun and try to play uplay still pops up... what did you guys do to avoid uPlay?"
,Hotspur77,2012-11-23T20:11Z,"sildur1
how could you send it to me?"
,Hotspur77,2012-11-23T21:13Z,I already have a save date ;)
,lingjr,2012-11-23T21:30Z,so could you guys share what exes you blocked? and how you got around uPlay? willing to help at all?
,G3tm3soda,2012-11-23T22:08Z,"@Sildur1 If you can't post link form an external site here, then maybe you can upload the save to piratebay and post the link to the torrent here. Is the save from the Reloaded version?

@lingjr If you have the Reloaded version, then Uplay is bypassed already.

Exe's to block (just in case):
AC3 folder:
- AssassinsCreed3.exe
- AC3SP.exe
- AC3MP.exe

Ubisoft Game Launcher folder:
- Uplay.exe
- UbisoftGameLauncher.exe"
,Sildur1,2012-11-23T22:41Z,"Hmm i think it's from the skidrow release, i log in to uplay and start the game in offline mode....."
,Sildur1,2012-11-23T22:51Z,"So:
Go to youtube, search for Sildur123 go to my channal, on the right side of it you will see the download link to the SAVEGAME. 
(Sry for that long way, but can't post links here)"
,lingjr,2012-11-23T23:02Z,"@G3tm3soda  Thanks, I have all those connections blocked, and I copied the crack files to the right spot.  When I try opening the game Uplay still tries to sign me in.. all blocking it does for me is saying it's not connected to the internet."
,Hotspur77,2012-11-23T23:18Z,"SAVE Sequence 5

,burnoutz,2012-11-30T20:37Z,"Well, here's where I'm at: I had the P2P version and it worked fine. Had to reformat my PC but I copied my saves for later. After I got my system working again, Uplay just wasn't having it. So I tried the SKIDROW version, not working, RELOADED, not working, R.G. working but wont take my saves. Anybody know how to make Uplay work now?"
,olimpas83,2012-12-02T20:40Z,"So in Buyed game are works fine??? Anyone can say is it worth buyin, or is it same errors with original buyed version?"
