Again, this uses the setup files from 32bit for enabling both installs.  This will remain the case for 32/64 bit installs until josh cell softwares comes up with a new version of his AIO software for win8 support.

I will upload an x64 version and x86 version soon.  Do not use this release to upgrade from win7x64."
,murphy78,2012-11-25T11:23Z,"Yah, him and T.F.K are on my sh** list for upping my stuff and claiming it was their work.

I am trying not to harass them more than I already have.  They know what they do.

You are most welcome for the monthly stuffs.  This is an entertaining hobby for me in the last few months.  I used to do xp stuff, but I didn't have the common sense to leave the windows settings alone back a few years ago. Bout the coolest thing I did back then was slip supremophantom's 1.0.40 wga thing into a legit kb file cab.  The file was so good it fooled everything.  What an odd thing to be nostalgic about... xp haha"
,murphy78,2012-11-25T11:32Z,"If you guys haven't heard about the program Advanced Tokens Manager from Josh Cell Softwares, I strongly recommend checking it out.
http://www.joshcellsoftwares.com/
The latest version as of right now is 3.5 RC2.  This is a great app that lets you save and restore the windows 8 activation files.

Note that it won't back up fake activation like the korean thing.  That is just something that modifies system files, it doesn't really activate your windows."
,seppmoser,2012-11-25T11:37Z,nice worke...murphy78 is the best...please can you upload this version in german or multilng ????
,rajesh1215,2012-11-25T14:11Z,"yes please. but if you could leave .NET out of it would be better, have downloaded so many times, I guess everyone must be having it to install separately. "
,toast_SWEDEN,2012-11-25T18:50Z,"Thanx a lot! This one also allows for downloading any language through Winupdate right, no matter what version you install?"
,murphy78,2012-11-25T23:31Z,"Thanks for the support fellas.  I may do language support versions of these as I have laid the groundwork.  It just depends how much stuff I do before the next patch day, which is likely to be December 11th.  If you can read the English version, and don't mind the system language being set to English, you can always add language from the control panel for your current user.  Just press winkey+r then type ""control panel"" without the quotes.  Then click on the ""add a language"".

As far as the net2-3.5.1, I know it bloats the OS a little bit, but there are still so many programs that require it, I got TONS of requests to put it in.  I think for the next year or so until people start using more net 4+ programs and less net2-3 programs, I will just include it.

Anyways, enjoy...
I got some testing to do"
,MaSs ZeRo,2012-11-26T15:08Z,"Can I request for a Windows 8 x86 Retail Channel Free WMC Nov24 2012...

Windows 8 Pro with Media Center OR Windows 8 Pro (x86)..... :)"
,54n1,2012-11-27T02:34Z,"hai murphy, i'm noob here, but i like your torrent, i use your 18nov release win 8 pro wmc, i follow your instruction, but i didn't get the email from microsoft, may i ask your help, can you give me the valid key via my email :) maybe you have 2 or more :) i'm very confuse with this...

a8y54n1@gmail.com"
,murphy78,2012-11-27T04:22Z,"mass zero, I already have a pro version with these kb files included.  That is my nov13 release.  ProWMC versions I released on nov18.  The instructions aren't quite as clear as these, but it's the same install, just not AIO.

54n1, you have to log on with a legit microsoft email.  They won't send you anything if you don't. Log in with something like an outlook.com, hotmail, live, etc email account from microsoft.  You can then send the free wmc code to whatever you want."
,murphy78,2012-11-27T04:24Z,"For an x64 version that supports x64 recovery mode from boot and upgrade from x64 operating systems you want this:

,rajesh1215,2012-11-27T13:47Z,This only confuses me. so many versions. guess a simple x64 x86 combine will do for me. 
,murphy78,2012-11-27T22:24Z,"I'm sorry if this gets a little confusing sometimes guys.  I really want to simplify things, but they can be hard to articulate without getting convoluted.

If you have questions, feel free to ask and bookmark page to come back to later. I or someone with knowledge will most likely get back to you.  I can be reached by pm'ing me on the forums, but I confess I don't check them very often.  I am usually testing or integrating."
,maxsuser,2012-11-28T01:45Z,"Thanks Murphy78, works 100%. At least installing on 5 machines saves you from installing so much updates individually. Also like to add that I found preparing flash drives for setup takes forever {USB2.0}. Its much faster to setup using external HDD. Just need to make a small partition first. More info here under answers (post 5) for noobs like me:  http://superuser.com/questions/317270/how-can-i-install-windows-7-from-an-external-hard-drive

Thanks Again M'78, appreciate all the hard work."
,rajesh1215,2012-11-29T12:49Z,murphy78... do you have this rip without the N versions? thanks
,Dix-huit,2012-11-30T01:52Z,"Where is the imagex.exe file ?
I need it to install windows 8 on a external hard drive. Thx"
,murphy78,2012-11-30T04:18Z,"imagex is in the windows apk, which is the developer tools for windows 8.  oscdimg is also in there"
,51D35W1P3,2012-12-01T06:51Z,"Hey Murphy, Can't U just make it Windows 8 Pro (x86) and (x64) version along with KB files and reduce the size of ISO. AIO is good but it would be better if we don't have to use a dual layer disc for this."
,51D35W1P3,2012-12-01T06:53Z,dfdfd
,amn1987,2012-12-01T17:44Z,I thought RETAIL versions were not tied to the first installed motherboard. Correct me if I am wrong.
,OnionRex,2012-12-02T11:42Z,"51D35W1P3

Use a simple USB flash drive. Quicker than burning a DVD and the time to install Windows is faster!"
