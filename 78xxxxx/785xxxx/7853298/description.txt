Superb narration of the first Round the World sailing trip (1519-1522) of MAGELLAN by the master of Biographies, Mr Stefan ZWEIG;

 A pure Masterpiece, totally edited, with TOC and notes, in .AZW3 (for kindle) and .ePub for the standard compliant readers (ie everyone!) 

And also for your enjoyment a collection of way-points ( the magellan.kmz file) that you can open with google earth to follow the progression and errances of our circumnavigators.
