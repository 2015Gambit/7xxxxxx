,vashterbation,2012-11-26T08:18Z,@ Daman. Do you plan to upload C:The Money of Soul and Possibility Control in 720p or should I grab the 1080p for now?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-26T08:51Z,"I sugeest grabing the 1080 now, since Level E, Index, are coming soon and i cant do everything at once."
,mooserocka,2012-11-28T05:10Z,honestly i dont think there is ANY difference to 1080 or 720 i think with ym tv and monitor It looks EXACTLY the same.
