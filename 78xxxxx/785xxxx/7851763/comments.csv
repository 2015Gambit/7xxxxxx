,RafVne2,2012-11-22T21:51Z,"Thank you for the up.
If it is in fact a Black box release, then I'm sure it will work as it should.
Thanks again. And thanks to the Blackbox members (even though they won't read it here)"
,RafVne2,2012-11-22T21:54Z,And a BIG thank you to skidrow members as well. Positive thoughts are going in your direction... :) (even though I don't believe in karma)

,mrjoh,2012-11-23T19:26Z,"hey im having trouble launching the game. As soon as i launch i get an error and am forced to shutdown the program. any suggestions on how i can fix this ? 

Thanks again! "
,Shaman72,2012-11-23T23:45Z,"If you run the game and nothing happens this is what you should try to do:

1) If you run it under windows 7, make sure you have Service Pack 1 installed
2) If you don't have Steam installed, than download and install the Steam client
3) Log in or create an account
4) Once logged in, click ""Steam"" in the upper menu and select ""Go Offline"". Steam client will restart itself
5) Click ""Add a game"" in the bottom left corner and select ""Add a Non-Steam Game""
6) Select the HMA.exe file for Hitman: Absolution
7) Launch the game from Steam
8) Enjoy

I hope this helps as it worked for me :)"

,xxxGAMExxx,2012-11-27T12:26Z,All those getting dont send error message pls install steam then ur game will run. I face the same problem but after insatlling steam My game works fine.
,TURTLE1984,2012-11-28T22:58Z,For those who are having issues with DX11 and the game will not play. Change settings to this: Ensure you've turned off MSAA which is under 'display' not 'graphics' as you might expect it to be. Also turn off 'Exclusive Fullscreen'.
,jKlark,2012-12-01T13:24Z,For whomever the game crashes on startup. try my fix: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7876312
