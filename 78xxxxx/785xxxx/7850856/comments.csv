,CaliGirl2,2012-11-22T23:49Z,Hi  everyone... so  I  have  Windows  8  Pro  with  Media  Center  64Bit  installed. I  went  to  folder  options  &  checked  off  the  boxes  to  show  hidden  files  in  order  to  see  the  dll  file. I  replaced  the  file  &  restarted  my  computer  &  followed  the next  steps  as  described  which  is  bringing  up  the  activation  window  &  putting  in  the  serial  provided  &  then  after  that  I  put  in  the  activation  provided  but  it  keeps  on  telling  me  that  it  is  invalid. Am  I  missing  something  here?? Can  anyone  confirm  that  this  works  on  a  Windows  8  64bit  operating  system?? Any  help  would  be  appreciated  guys... Thank  you :)

Will look somewhere else."
[V],Alia_Erenel,2012-11-23T22:35Z,"Cracked DLL goes to :

C:Program FilesCommon FilesMediafour
or
C:Program Files (x86)Common FilesMediafour"

C: Program Files/Common Files/Mediafour
or
C:Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Mediafour

If you run into the can't copy becuase .dll is open elsewhere try:

1. Closing all document tabs

2. Making Sure (Task Manager) all instances of MacDrive are closed.

3. Close the Current Location and go back into it directly.

Works Windows 8, 64 bit. "

Best to split or convert videos using Xilosoft Video Converter Ultimate.

And I figure I should mention this as people may feel to realize this:

If you format to HFS, then Windows won't read the drive, if it's portable, it'll be able to eject and that's all.

You'll need either a Mac or an Xbox 360 (Possibly PS3) to reformat it back to a readable format like FAT32."
