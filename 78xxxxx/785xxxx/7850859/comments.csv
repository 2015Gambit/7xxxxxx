Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 5 seed,(im never having a go at the uploader ! ) if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent /bittorent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please google it then copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out , ive more than done my share of helping now its your turn, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc ,also copy & paste this comment onto a Word document or Openoffice (which is free) & keep spreading the message on every torrent you look at ..we must get more people to help out , theres too many hit & runners who never comment or add links etc :( "
