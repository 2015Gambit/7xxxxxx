The two-part, fifth edition of Advanced Organic Chemistry has been substantially revised and reorganized for greater clarity. The material has been updated to reflect advances in the field since the previous edition, especially in computational chemistry. Part B describes the most general and useful synthetic reactions, organized on the basis of reaction type. It can stand-alone; together, with Part A: Structure and Mechanisms, the two volumes provide a comprehensive foundation for the study in organic chemistry. Companion websites provide digital models for students and exercise solutions for instructors.

It took me forever to find the fifth edition of this book, so I thought I should post this. I found this PDF somewhere on 4shared, but I made the bookmarks within the PDF myself. The PDF is not just a scan of the pages (all text is recognized and searchable), so it looks like it came from an ebook directly.
