The Blue's fiercest warrior returns as FATHOM: KIANI vol 2 begins! In Volume One, she discovered her true identity. Later, she was labeled a dissident by her own people. Finally, she was killed by Aspen Matthews... Now, Kiani is back-and she's pissed! This all-new Fathom saga kicks off with the return of one of the Aspen Universe's favorite heroines, Kiani, as she returns to the awe-inspiring underwater world of the Blue seeking vengeance for her past!
