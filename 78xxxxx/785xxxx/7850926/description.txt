Gulf Publishing, Hydrocarbon Processing | 2012 | ISBN: n/a | 241 pages | PDF | 17 MB

This handbook showcases recent advances in licensed technologies for gas processing, particularly in the area of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The handbook includes new technologies for shale gas treating, synthesis gas production and treating, LNG and NGL production, hydrogen generation, and others. Additional technology topics covered include drying, gas treating, liquid treating, effluent cleanup and sulfur removal.

The LNG industry is poised to expand worldwide as new natural gas discoveries and production technologies compliment increasing demand for gas as a low-emissions fuel.
With the discovery of new reserves come new challenges, such as how to treat gas produced from shale rockΓÇöa topic of particular interest for the growing shale gas industry in the US.
The handbook addresses this technology topic and updates many others.
