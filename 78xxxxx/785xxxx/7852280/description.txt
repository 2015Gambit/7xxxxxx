
An early crossover set from Mtume ΓÇô one that still holds onto some of the elements first forged in the spiritual jazz underground of the early 70s, yet one that also starts to showcase more of the tighter soul groove he'd burst into prominence in the early 80s! The blend is a great one, and makes the album one of Mtume's most compelling records ΓÇô as even amidst some of the more grooving numbers, there's some great offbeat elements at work too ΓÇô almost putting the record in the territory of work by Roy Ayers or Edwin Birdsong. The mighty Hubert Eaves contributes lots of great keyboards to the record, and famous partner Reggie Lucas plays guitar ΓÇô while Mtume himself sings along with his percussion, and also gets some female vocal help from Tawatha. Titles include the sublime "The Closer I Get To You" ΓÇô plus "Just Funnin", "Kiss This World Goodbye", "Love Lock", "Metal Flake Mind", and "This Is Your World". (Out of print.
