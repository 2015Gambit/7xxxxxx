 who's lying now"
[V],azaq318,2012-11-24T22:59Z,"The game is pre-cracked:) But some guys there asked for this files, because AV killed them first time. Release downloaded by thousands of people, and so few of them face such problem ) In fact - 3 of them ) I'm don't even know why am I disputing about this with you ) I don't care what you think, I don't care who are you, but I know that you are a liar ) And this is bad for your karma. For sure ;)"
,it9999,2012-11-25T01:58Z,Microsoft Security Essentials has blocked the file because it thinks it contains VirTool:Win32/Obfuscator.XZ which is a severe level. creates viruses. Is there any way to get around this
,Green.Lantern,2012-11-25T02:26Z,anyone else get stuck in the level with the tree monster?

Three files in this torrent.

1. LEGOLOTR.exe
2. rldata.dll
3. rld.dll"
,Bogdin,2012-11-26T01:44Z,"Found a fix that worked for me... 

The crack comes with three files.
1. LEGOLOTR.exe
2. rld.dll
3. rldata.dll

Just make sure you have those 3 files in your folder.  When you download this crack or the main torrent the AV detects some kind of virus in the rld.dll and auto deletes it. But if you hide the download from your AV you can have it. Just make sure you keep hiding that file from your AV where ever you put it. Probably not totally safe...    but fuck it. "

,asdfmxx,2012-12-02T07:27Z,"On Win 7 64 bit, the (c) and tm symbols in the folder name cause the ""rld.dll failed to initialize"" problem some people are getting. Rename the folder without those symbols, then add the folder to your AV exception list to allow the game to run as normal."
