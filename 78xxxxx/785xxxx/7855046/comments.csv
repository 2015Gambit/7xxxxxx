,marcolou16,2012-11-24T03:18Z,Well done Max! This one work great...your still the man !!! Tks.
,maxdesolate,2012-11-24T03:20Z,just leave the torrent on. dont remove it after you have downloaded it. and set the upload speed to unlimited or 40 or 50 if you have low bandwidth. then it wil seed by itself.
,marcolou16,2012-11-24T03:21Z,Well done Max! This one worked great. You're still the man! Thanks.

Evangeline: With a normal BitTorrent client, as soon as your download is 100% completed it will automatically begin to seed, as long as there are outstanding leechers still downloading. You don't really have to do anything, just let yours seed to at least 100%, but 200% or more is even better...try to give back more than you took."
,maxdesolate,2012-11-24T03:42Z,comments are acting up. just leave the torrent on and it will seed by itself.
