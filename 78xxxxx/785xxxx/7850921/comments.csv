,scamInc,2012-11-22T20:21Z,What's r.g. mechanic
,DJDFS,2012-11-23T04:17Z,"@scamInc - R.G. Mechanics is a scene release group, they released the original Murderous edition with all the assassin's creed games except for Assassin's Creed III, and now they've released Assassin's Creed III, so it was all packed together as a single download.

tl;dr- It's an Assassin's Creed Collection, the games are pre-cracked and updated to the latest patches, the installer for each game allows you to install it in either english or russian."
