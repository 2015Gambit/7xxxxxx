Hi NLUPPER
Thank You For Replying

First, if you have PAL version of any movie it is the best. I do not need NTSC. 
I mean if you do not get the PAL version for some movie then NTSC can work. 
Any ONE will do , not both.


For...  The Heroes Of Telemark (1965)

Nordic with English Menu is good, I think.
But can you PLZZZZ  put in English subtitles in the movie. No need to EDIT the MENU. 
Jst the ENG subs in the main movie file.
Eng subtitles for this movie is available on the internet BUT I do not know how to put Subtitles in a DVDR.
PLZZZ  if AND WHENEVER you get the time.

I found your release :

If you can put proper ENGLISH Subtitles in it and re-upload it. Its fine. No need to EDIT Menu.
Or if you find anythIng NEW with ENG subs then it is Good.

Your Super Work on the uploading of the movie Hindenburg (1975) , has made us Greedy  
:-)  :-)
Plzzz  if you get time ....


THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING US
