,mikehawk_,2012-11-23T07:20Z,mutliplayer doesn't seem to work 
,the1four,2012-11-23T14:16Z,"multi player dont work??? seriously people WTF.

Really a great torrent and works great on iMac 2.7 i5, 4g ram, radeon hd 6770m 512mb.

,gazzon,2012-11-23T14:43Z,"@zack793 hey men please let me know of the results, I have a late 2011 13'' - we are quite on the edge of the requirements"
,shenalthegamer,2012-11-23T15:40Z,is it seriously only 5 GB
,shenalthegamer,2012-11-23T15:42Z,is it only 5 GB cause borderlands one was 7 GB and then GOTY was 8.9 GB
,shenalthegamer,2012-11-23T15:55Z,"will this work on Processor 


Processor 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5

,emasen,2012-11-23T20:19Z,"Thanks a lot! It is working on my 8gb, early 2011, 13"" Macbook Pro. Running pretty smoothly on low graphics settings but I can't complain.

Only issue is the co-op. The PC version of Borderlands 2 is a few updates ahead of the Mac version, thus we cannot play together cross platform, but I have yet to try with another Mac user via Hamachi or some sort. Nonetheless,  let's hope for an update soon. ^^"
,yung_12,2012-11-23T20:22Z,we might have to wait for the Borderlands 2 MACOSX-MONEY
[V],thenoobish,2012-11-23T20:59Z,This could be Borderlands 2 MACOSX-MONEY but the original uploader must have renamed it!
,manualdownload,2012-11-23T22:24Z,Any way to use a controller with this other than the mouse and keyboard?

I'm not sure if it's the game, or my performance, or the network connection. But I'm pretty sure it's not the connection cuz we played a lot of borderlands 1 without any problems. anyways ya..if it's the game, I hope it gets fixed, or if it's jst my mac then fuck this. >."

3. Lan games work. (not tested with windows to mac or vice versa)

4. a few problems with lan gaming. (not sure if it's the game or just my mac)

5. awesome game and awesome torrent!!"

Thanks in advance!"
,grandslammer,2012-11-28T15:17Z,"This torrent works fine on my 2007 Macbook Pro even though it does not meet the official vRAM requirements (which is 256 mb and mine is 128).

BUT!
The game is kind of pointless without being able to connect to Steam to play multiplayer...

We may actually have to buy it unless someone finds a solution!"
