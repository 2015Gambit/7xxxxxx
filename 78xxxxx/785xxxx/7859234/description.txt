It's time to cash your reality check and re-create your life on your own terms. 
In your twenties you expect to finally live life on your own terms. But it can seem like the worldwon't cooperate. Roommates drive you crazy (but you can't afford to lose them), entry-level jobs frustrate you ("Four hundred double-sided copies before lunch,"), and even a dreamjob can take over your nights and weekends, leaving you feeling like you are running hard but going nowhere. 
Jason Ryan Dorsey helps you turn this coming-of-age crisis into opportunity. He shows you thebig secret of the real world-that you don't realize how much control you have over your life until you use it. In "My Reality Check Bounced " Jason shows you howto: 
Find the courage to climb out of your real-world rut 
Create a Future Picture that gets you off your "buts"
Uncover opportunity and build a tag team to make themost of it
Live like you mean it, and finally cash your reality check.
