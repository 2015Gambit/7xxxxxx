But it is two (2) folders! Not one (1)!!

One is named 54 and one is named 100 or 103 and has the ""metadata"" file. "

,HavokMker,2012-11-26T22:01Z,Can anyone upload a save starting from Sequence 08. 
,proxysoul,2012-11-27T04:15Z,"I am pretty sure you are supposed to put the save files in C:UsersUsernameAppDataRoamingAssinsCreed3UsernameOrbit54 

however the save file provided in this torrent does not seem to be the right type of file..."
,proxysoul,2012-11-27T04:16Z,sorry meant C:Users/Username/AppData/Roaming/AssinsCreed3Username/Orbit54
,unreadable33,2012-11-30T23:51Z,"@petaflux- If you didn't use the same crack that I did then no, you prob don't have an orbit folder. I do know for certain that is where my saves are kept."
,bishopbutters,2012-12-01T19:59Z,"it seems this save will not work with the SKiDROW version+Orbit Launcer. I tried simply moving it and renaming it to 2.save (instead of Save002.sav), neither worked. I am guessing this is a Theta/Reloaded save or Original save game tyoe."
