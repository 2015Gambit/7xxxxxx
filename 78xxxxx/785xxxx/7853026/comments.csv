,babybluetits24,2012-11-24T05:07Z,"imdb says 
Language:
English | Spanish   so if i dont understand spanishwill i need subs or is it just a few words ? can any1 let me know thanks"
,piratebuddha,2012-11-24T16:57Z,"@babybluetits24 It's an American production so if there are moments in the film where someone speaks Spanish the film probably already has subtitles. So to answer your question, No, you don't need subs, you'll be just fine."
,jundamane,2012-11-24T23:01Z,one of the best films of the year and a great hd quality rip. thanks bozx

,snaz27,2012-11-25T09:43Z,"Does playback stop at 1:16 for anyone else? 

Sound and video quality are phenomenal up till that point, but I'd really like to see the rest of the 1 hour and 46 minutes of the movie!

I'm using VLC. Any help would be appreciated!"
,FlyingMilkan,2012-11-25T11:28Z,Sounds is 640kbps AC3

Yes this does have hard coded subs for Spanish parts only.

When required...

@snaz27

Check your file size. Depending on your operating and file system it should be around 5.18 to 5.14 GiB. 

If correct, try using GOM player Ver. 2,1,21,4846. It's freeware and works for me.

@piratebuddha

Although proven correct with this torrent, movies produced in the states are sent to many other countries. Some not able to read English.
So it depends on the region where the DVD or Blu-ray rip comes from.  "
,snaz27,2012-11-25T23:14Z,"@militsiya
Thanks for the help-Unfortunately, GOM player skips through the parts of the movie where VLC gets stuck-not the best viewing experience.

I only have this problem with this specific file. All my other .mkv files work perfectly fine.

I'll have to continue troubleshooting VLC, I guess. :-/"

Sorry to read. Nothing worse than not being able to finish a good movie.

I could very well lose my name for providing links here. But three sheets into the wind... I know it is a pain to download 5.2 Gib of data all allover again. However on several sites that I dwell, there have not been any issues with HDCLUB's 720p release.

You may have to consider your file is corrupt.

Wow! Thank you so much for that!
Words will fail to exhibit my gratitude!"
,ancientmyth86,2012-11-26T09:39Z,"DTS 640 kbps????? that is rubbish quality....DTS should be at least around the 1,500 kbps. This isn't out on bluray yet so no wonder!!!!"
,QborT,2012-11-26T21:24Z,"ancientmyth86 your ignorance is impressive.  It clearly states that it is 640kbps @ 5.1, congrats on not understanding."
,Primuz017,2012-11-27T20:56Z,Don't download. You will just be disappointed of how shitty this movie is. Not the quality but the movie itself.
,Powerslave0,2012-11-28T00:54Z,"It clearly states: English DD5.1 Ch 640 kbps (From DTS-HD MA).  It's probably AC3 from the DTS HD Master audio.  English is a hard language to master, we know how people cannot read it."
