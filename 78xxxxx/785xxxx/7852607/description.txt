Notes Audio from Hive-CM8
.
The dvd didnt have studio audio so used the best line around from JiiNX
I filtered and cleaned it for 2h an synced it back to my video, took me
20 cuts to get all lipsync and entered it back into the russian 5.1 track
sounds very nice now and all scary effects are inside now too
will give you the extra scary kick and will do me till bluray
btw, removed the russian narrator voice from the endcredits hate when its still left inside
