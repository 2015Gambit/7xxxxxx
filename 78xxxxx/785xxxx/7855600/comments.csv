As the original seed I'm now notice other seeders on my torrent and plenty of leeches, but Vuze itself is retardedly putting the file in the incoming, not outgoing section and says I have ""0%"" of it, despite me being the originator of the file.  I'd call that a ""WTF?"" moment.  Just want to confirm that other people are in fact getting the real file, despite Vuze barfing its own brain out on me."
,MkUltra7,2012-11-24T13:12Z,"No its not, your not uploading, it says there are many uploaders but noone connects, check your settings,"
,MkUltra7,2012-11-24T19:23Z,"PPL this is a MPAA or whatever scam, there are supposedly 160 uploaders and 400 downloaders but the uploaders are not connecting and the downloaders, none of the have any data, so this is a MPPA scam to collect you ip adresses for policereporting."
,twin_loverrr,2012-11-25T08:51Z,"No, it's just this latest version of Vuze having a totally broken ""Force recheck"" feature (this is documented in the Vuze forums, it turns out). The result is that when you create the torrent, then stop it and upload the torrent file to TPB, then download it again to run that copy of the torrent in Vuze instead of your original (which is missing the TPB trackers), and tell it to use the same data file with the new torrent file, what used to take a moment to check the data file on the HD with that in the ""TPBified"" torrent file and get the torrent going for real, now simply fails completely. It sits there trying to download what it is so broken it doesn't realize it already has. Dammit. 

This isn't an MPAA conspiracy.  The original 'Blood & Chrome' files are FREELY DISTRIBUTED online officially, including via YouTube. I only attempted to provide it here as a courtesy for people who have censorious governments that block YouTube, like much of the Middle East.  Don't be paranoid.  The MPAA can't take action against something that's not illegal.  If you're worried about MPAA, Google ""SafePeer Level 3"", and read your BTware's docs on how to install IP filters.  You should stop getting legal nastygrams from your ISP claiming copyright holders have ID'd your IP as a pirate after you do so.

That said, the newly uploaded ""E06-10"" torrent IS an outright fake. E05-06 only came out about 24 hours ago, and these are being released as double episodes on a weekly basis, so the next will be E07-08 in ~6 days.  I don't know why the the ""E06-10"" file was posted, but don't bother with it. No idea what that bullshit is or who is behind it, for what reasons.

In the interim, I am going to try downgrading to an older Mac Vuze and seeing if I can get this damned file to seed properly."
,twin_loverrr,2012-11-25T09:32Z,"FIXED!  The ""File -> Open -> Torent file..."" method was also failing, BTW.   I downgraded to Mac Vuze 4.7.0.2 from late 2011, and set the torrent up again, and am now seeding it with no (apparent) problems, at the rate of ~128 Kb/s.  Enjoy!

After the downgrade, I just had to catch Vuze attempting to download and install 4.8 again and stop that torrent, and nuke that file so the 4.8 torrent is dead inside my client. I'm hoping that will prevent my copy from ever upgrading past 4.7 without me doing it manually.  Then I restarted the torrent and it worked fine.  Vuze 4.8 is simply broken."
,grifter_t7,2012-11-26T01:45Z,thx for both eps in 1 makes life easier
,twin_loverrr,2012-11-26T03:24Z,"Update: If you need to stop Vuze from updating itself, as I did, instructions are here: http://harleyshelphut.com/how-to-stop-vuze-from-updating/

They are so detailed even a retard could follow them. Most users will not need to read the whole thing. The short version is to turn off the four version checking and updating options in Vuze's Preferences (Options) window, under Vuze -> Preferences -> Interface -> Start (Mac) or Tools -> Options -> Interface - Start (Windows), then restart Vuze.  You have to be in Advanced mode in Preferences/Options to access this stuff."
,twin_loverrr,2012-11-26T03:25Z,@grifter_t7: I didn't merge the episodes. They were originally posted to YouTube that way.
,grifter_t7,2012-11-30T17:20Z,well even better then thx for making this available to someone who can't watch it in there own country man what a croc.
