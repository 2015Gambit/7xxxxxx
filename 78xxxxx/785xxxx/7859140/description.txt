Dear Gardener,

Imagine you knew a secret about growing plants in a break-through new way... to the outside world your organic garden or farm would seem almost "magic", Why? Because people almost never see you working in it!

While every one else works hard at planting, weeding...more weeding..., watering, fertilizing, composting,... and more and more weeding... You're gardening from the comfort of your hammock.

What's more... your plants grow twice as fast, and you can grow up to ten times more of them in the same area of space as your neighbors do. That means, if you're growing lettuce, and have 10 square feet of space... your method grows as much lettuce as someone would with 100 square feet of space!

If this sounds like a dream, you may be shocked to discover that farms and home gardens like this already exist... and you can do it too.
