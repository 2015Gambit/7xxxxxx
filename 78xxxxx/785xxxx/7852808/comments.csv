,abhi1423,2012-11-23T12:54Z,does this torrent include every update and dlc
,Whitebb,2012-11-23T15:45Z,"Got it, the LAN crash caused by the Skidrow patch 1.2.2 crack content, to fix it install Skidrow patch 1.2.2 and DLC's pack, then install the crack content from previous patch 1.2.2 (not for skidrow)
Skidrow please release new crack for 1.2.2."
,zeroeight,2012-12-01T16:31Z,"I have gone through every single upload of the game, the 1.2.2 update, and DLC, from every frigging site I can possible find (Easily over 25 sites) and not one of them work in any combination.

Every single one of these starts the game then goes dead.

I'm sick and tired of people leaving comments saying this works fine when it doesn't work at all"
,ejstout,2012-12-02T02:57Z,"Zero, in order to get the game to work you need to change the shortcut from the launcher to the borderlands2.exe in the win32 folder.

Regardless though, you cannot play online or through lan with the 1.2.2 or torgue addon."
,zeroeight,2012-12-02T17:52Z,"@ejstout
Where do you people get this bullshit from that doesn't do a fucking thing I've double clicked the borderlands2.exe file itself directly out of the directory.

The borderlands2.exe DOES NOT LAUNCH THE FUCKING GAME it goes dead after double clicking it.

Once you install any 1.2.2 update YOU WILL NEVER EVER BE ABLE TO LAUNCH THE GAME BECAUSE

The fucking idiots that uploaded the 1.2.2 update DID NOT INCLUDE THE cracked 1.2.2 borderlands2.exe file that is needed in order to launch the game. So until an actual 1.2.2 borderlands2.exe has been made and uploaded, then it doesn't matter what you try to use, the game will never ever launch.

This is proven by comparing the size of original cracked borderlands2.exe to the one in the update you will see that the Original borderlands2.exe is only 25.3MB in size and the one in the update is 33.7MB

So someone needs to get their head out of their ass. And people like ejstout need to stop being retarded and saying stupid bullshit that won't do anything."
,ejstout,2012-12-02T23:14Z,"Zero, I don't know what to tell you man.  I installed the game, then the pirate booty, then the 1.2.2 patch, then torgue, then took the exe from the 1.2.2 patch and copied it into the win32 folder and the game worked for me, except when I tried to set the game up as a lan to play on tunngle, at that point the game locks up and I had to control-alt-del to close it.

But the standard shortcut that opens the launcher didn't work either, which was why I had to create a shortcut to the exe directly instead of using the one created when installing the game.

Don't know why you got all this hate though dude..."
