,moviekil,2012-11-22T20:09Z,"@Mr443x1 of course windows 8 recognized as virus but you should know everything detected as virus not necesarily is a virus, it is an activator, in another words is a hack, windows 8 even recognized my ipod as malware and i know is not . but as far i know this activator works"
,kaderben,2012-11-22T21:39Z,"activate only to 06/05/2013. (380 days).
not definitive."
,leyo1022,2012-11-23T00:29Z,Why not use activations via phone your Windows 8 will be activated permanently and it is still working right now...
,tpbl,2012-11-23T10:53Z,"If activator provided with this torrent doesn't work then use this updated activator at
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7789752/Windows.8.Activator.K.J.v1.11_Tam.exe
This works 100% "
,tpbl,2012-11-23T10:54Z,"@GRDriftKing
the script only works when that server is on else it won't work"
,DeadToll2012,2012-11-29T01:32Z,"OMFG. I seriously don't wanna believe another Windows 8 Activator again, my current one (idk if this was the one I downloaded) activated for me but its not permanently activated (which means after a few days, or one week rather, its back to not activated yet).

And yesterday, my laptop was fucked up to a black screen. And I thought it was Microsoft's problem. And today I tried to turn on my computer to see if there's any luck of recovering, and guess what? Its back to inactivated again! And the fucking black screen is gone!! Holy Jesus. I seriously do not dare to download ANY Activator again... (unless you can trick me into believing this)"
