Book Description
Beginning R: An Introduction to Statistical Programming is a hands-on book showing how to use the R language, write and save R scripts, build and import data files, and write your own custom statistical functions. R is a powerful open-source implementation of the statistical language S, which was developed by AT&T. R has eclipsed S and the commercially-available S-Plus language, and has become the de facto standard for doing, teaching, and learning computational statistics.

R is both an object-oriented language and a functional language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and completely free. A large community of dedicated R users and programmers provides an excellent source of R code, functions, and data sets. R is also becoming adopted into commercial tools such as Oracle Database. Your investment in learning R is sure to pay off in the long term as R continues to grow into the go to language for statistical exploration and research.

- Covers the freely-available R language for statistics
- Shows the use of R in specific uses case such as simulations, discrete probability solutions, one-way ANOVA analysis, and more
- Takes a hands-on and example-based approach incorporating best practices with clear explanations of the statistics being done

What youΓÇÖll learn
- Acquire and install R
- Import and export data and scripts
- Generate basic statistics and graphics
- Program in R to write custom functions
- Use R for interactive statistical explorations
- Implement simulations and other advanced techniques
