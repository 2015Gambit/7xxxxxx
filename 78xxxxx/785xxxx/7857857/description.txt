In the late 70s, when the fortunes of Motown Records
seemed to be flagging, Rick James came along and rescued
the company, providing funky hits that updated the label's
style and saw it through into the mid-80s. Actually,
James had been with Motown earlier, though nothing had
come of it. After growing up in Buffalo and running away
to join the Naval Reserves, he ran away from the Navy to
Toronto, where he was in a band with future Buffalo
Springfield members Neil Young and Bruce Palmer, and with
Goldy McJohn, later of Steppenwolf. As the Mynah Birds,
they signed to Motown and recorded, though no record was
ever released. James had a journeyman's career playing
bass in various groups before signing again to Motown as
an artist, songwriter, and producer..

After an eight-year stay at Motown, Rick James moved to
Reprise/Warner Bros. with 1988's LP "Wonderful". By that
time, the funkster wasn't nearly as popular as he had been
in the late 70s and early 80s, and he hoped to make a major
comeback with this album. Now incorporating pop/rock, synth
funk, and hip-hop elements this wax right here features
album's title in five, kind of bugged out, electro funk
versions remixed by the likes of Paul Simpson, Dave Shaw
and Bruce Kane. Rest in peace RJ!

ooh ye..
