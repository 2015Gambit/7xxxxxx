Works fine, DLC content is activated in-game, and Nod32 detects NO viruses.
Thnx for the upload."
,Dufox,2012-11-25T05:39Z,"this works just fine but take care installing it.
i installed it after i was a few missions into the game and now i have to restart the missions from level 1.

this is not the ""omg freak out"" the dlc deleted my save post, my save file is still in the folder and all my unlocks are still unlocked, i just have to restart the missions. which is not a big deal but worth mentioning it happened to me :D

it could be as simple as moving my save to a new folder that i just haven't found yet.
but alas...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
