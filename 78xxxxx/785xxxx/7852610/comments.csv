,kanha,2012-11-23T20:52Z,"@mf-den

plz re-up the links of 'Rvenge S01' in your site

or here in torrent.

thx for all ur uploads. +1"
,rameramwe,2012-11-23T21:29Z,man i was thinking who should i speak to so they encode the wwe ?? so u can upload it in torrent ???? and if u can why not ask any encoder to do it ??? cuz it's really big like 1.75 gb evrey week for the raw only and the quality isn't that goood
[T],mf-den,2012-11-24T06:28Z,"^Talked to the encoders, they dont plan on doing it cos the source itself has a poor quality (compared to normal tv shows) and if u do further encoding, it only becomes worse. Have seen a few good quality ones (compared to other encoded ones) in tpb itself, so just check it out."
,rameramwe,2012-11-24T07:28Z,thanks mr mf-den hope i didn't annoy u
