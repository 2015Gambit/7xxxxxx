,dhjudasx,2012-11-23T01:12Z,"Pitch Black is in the rip query... Even as much hardrive space as I have.. I quite often have to let encodes catch up before I can rip more... 

just 20 bluray movies alone consumes over 1TB of drive space quite often.

I need to get james bond casino royale uploaded as well as the star wars clone wars not to mention a few 100 others lol"

I sense that u are having all the 22 James Bond in 1080p, but aren't getting the time and space on ur hard disk, isn't t?"
