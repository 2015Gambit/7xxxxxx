,denitr,2012-11-24T21:20Z,this is actually quite bad quality
,CrimsonKiss07,2012-11-26T21:21Z,"Great quality to start with, but then towards the end of the show, it starts to skip MAJORLY bad. It's not very watchable at the end and you can't hear what the ponies are saying because the sound skips and the video freezes. It's brief, but it's only a 22 min show, so it does make things confusing. Downloading the other one that's up and hopefully it will be better. Thanks anyways!"
