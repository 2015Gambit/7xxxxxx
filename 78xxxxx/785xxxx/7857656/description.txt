Rob Papen Plugins Pack



Rob Papen Blade v1.0.1
R2R | 25.11.2012 | 64.3 MB

The initial idea for Blade was born out of the want to have more ΓÇÿhuman inputΓÇÖ into the sound. The classic synthesizer parts for modulation are LFOs and Envelopes. The ΓÇÿhuman inputΓÇÖ is the keyboard we play and controllers like pitch bend or modulation wheel. A XY pad is perfect for the human input, but it controls only the filter and volume... We found this to be too limited. We wanted also to control the ΓÇÿharmonicsΓÇÖ of the oscillator...changing the waveform using the XY pad.

Rob Papen RG v1.6.0f
R2R | 25.11.2012 | 85.8 MB

RG is a unique groove plug-in that is far more than just a "virtual Rhythm Guitar player ! New released RG 1.5 included 'Muted Guitar' model.

By using the RG onboard sequencer it is possible to create classic Rhythm Guitar grooves, but beyond that you can use the synthesizer features and effects to make fresh new edgy guitar grooves. To play the grooves RG is using a keyboard layout of "major chords" and "minor chords", each with two sequence patterns (A or B) option.
It is only a matter of hitting a single note in the major keyboard range or minor keyboard range and the groove plays. The sound sets are clean sampled guitars, which gives you great freedom and flexibility when using the synthesizer features and effects of RG.
