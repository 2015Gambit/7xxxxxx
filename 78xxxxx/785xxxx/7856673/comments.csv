,greyaburton,2012-11-24T20:41Z,"after applying patch,license info says dvd copy expires dec 24 2012 and the rest,ripper and bluray expires dec 31st 2157.need the dvd copy to say the same as thats the one i use the most.thanks"
,greyaburton,2012-11-24T21:14Z,"the problem was that i had previously used the dvd copy option before i applied the patch.i installed it on another computer,applied the patch and that one says expire date of dec 31 2157 for all the options.sorry about that.thanks"
,greyaburton,2012-11-25T01:26Z,got it to say never expire.have to disconnect from the internet then run it.thanks
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-25T01:55Z,"Questions""
1. Can I allow DVDFab internet access? When starting, it displays ""Accessing Server Information""?
2. I ""Firewalled"" it - denying it any internet access.
3. Is this necessary? Does the ""cracked"" DVDFab still display this even if it is allowed internet access?
4. When displaying this message it seems to take a long time to start and I wondered if this is because I denied it internet access."
,greyaburton,2012-11-25T01:59Z,"sorry for all the comments,but decided to try blocking it from connecting to the internet in windows firewall and it worked that way,so dont have to disconnect my internet.either way,it takes longer for the main screen to load up though.thats kinda sucky in this new version.thanks again."
,greyaburton,2012-11-25T03:14Z,"in reply to the empathicear questions.if you allow it internet access,when you check the license info,(once the program is running, click on the question mark circle,in top right corner,then license info.should see expiry date of year 2157.dont think well be around that long.ha).however it does start little faster that way,rather than blocking it.however when you block it,the license info says never expire.it always starts that way with or without applying the crack.must be a new thing they came up with.maybe someone will come up with a patch to bypass that part?still the best software i have used for burning.as i only burn dvds,and they do offer just that program if it can be found to download with a crack to use?hope that helps.have a good one."
,greyaburton,2012-11-25T03:31Z,"i checked back to their site to get more info about just the dvd copy program(as i mentioned in my previous comment).though they say its just that,when i click download,the download is still the full version?so i guess thats not an option.sorry about that."
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-25T04:09Z,"1. I have firewalled/denied the program internet access.
2. Now, When I start it the message ""Accessing Server Information"" screen is there for an annoying amount of time before the main starts.
3. This is why I am asking about the cracked exe.
4. Does it prevent a server check or do something else? Or, both? Or, what?"

Works great- unlike the .dll recplacement method!
Thanks~"
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-25T19:58Z,"[I may have to wait for an updated version. I am using v9.0.1.1]
Whether I allow the program internet access or not, it seems buggy - keeps crashing. And, when I do get as far as a DVD Copy, it complains about not being able to access the output DVD Writer. I have two DVD writers and tried swapping the source and destination disks in each to no avail. And, I tried accessing the drive it complained about with another program [EB's CloneDVD] with no problem."
