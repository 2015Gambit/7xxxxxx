Hola, Senors!

This is a run that I couldnt find in one torrent anywhere else. Of course Demonoid would have probably had it, but nooo, fucking MPAA pushed for it to be shut down. (Come back, Demonoid! I see your trackers!)

Anyway, this includes J. Michael Straczynski's entire run on Spider-Man, as well as the dreaded One More Day story line, and at the end, as a bonus, I added the explanation for One More Day, Joe Quesada's One Moment In Time.

Enjoy! Hope you guys were looking for this as much as I was
