,lucabara,2012-11-25T06:43Z,"seeing this ratio ,, faster to download from hotfile even at 300kb/sec lol .. if you know where to look, you shall find.. only if you cant wait like me..

but football fans always seed .. so just give this torrent a couple of hours then will be fast"
,hangsterman,2012-11-25T07:01Z,"Lucabara you have no idea what you're talking about. Footy torrents are always well seeded. 30 sec in and I got 300KB

Footy, thanks!"
,kennymac12,2012-11-25T07:26Z,"@hangsterman, its flying now,  652seeders, but the first 4hours were painful... anyway cheers footy"
,lucabara,2012-11-25T07:38Z,"lol i always seed footy's torent.s  thats why they have good speeds (last 3-4 weeks Match of the day) are still seeding...
 BUT today decided to download from another source.. when there were 30 seeders and 1400 lechers.. 
 i love footy's torrents what you talking about :P

if you got speed you were one of the lucky ones .. but it didnt take long for the seed ratio to be at least 1:1.. which is great..and now its over

Have a good day"

,oneleggoalie,2012-11-25T11:30Z,"In Hong Kong, where the Plutocracy rules with the help of an Hypocracy, there are 2 ""cable""channels.
Each one has managed to obtain the rights to broadcast Premier League matches to the paying public every 3 years...coincidence, or blatant collusion? And the customers have to pay for a ""new"" subscription for the service they originally paid for and lost.
We therefore submit footy for canonisation upon his possible detention by the Internet Taliban. Thank you footy."
