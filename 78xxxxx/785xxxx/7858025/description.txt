Gopal and Seema are two small children who live in a small town in India. While Gopal lives with Bansilal, who he believes to be his father, the much more wealthy Seema lives with her dad, Rana, who does not approve of her friendship with Gopal. He wants Bansilal to send Gopal away, and Bansilal does so. Years later, Gopal has now grown up and is curious to know what has happened back in the small town especially to Bansilal and Seema, so he travels back, meets with Seema and both re-kindle their friendship, which turns into love much to the chagrin of Rana. Gopal is told that Bansilal is dead, but village belle, Saloni, who is in love with Gopal, tells him that she has seen Bansilal's ghost. A practical Gopal must now use all his resources to find out the truth behind the ghost story, secure his land against a greedy Rana, as well as advocate his right to the estate that his father had left him from none other than his step-mother..
