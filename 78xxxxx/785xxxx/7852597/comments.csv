OR
The game will start and then crash with an error message that says Borderlands2 has stopped working

In either case I'm sick and tired of people leaving comments saying this works fine, or there is nothing wrong with it, when now, the game cannot even be launched AT ALL.

The only 2 updates and DLC that actually work are: Mechromancer and Captain Scarlett and her Pirates Booty.

NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK BEYOND THAT so stop people are lying. Or leaving comments with different accounts on their own torrents or having their friends in on this scam doing it.

SO KNOCK THIS SHIT OFF.

I have started reporting every single torrent anyone uploads of this that tries to say this works."
