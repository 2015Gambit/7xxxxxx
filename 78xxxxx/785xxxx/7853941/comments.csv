,doncollum,2012-11-27T02:22Z,"@Fili0Mon - Yes I did, it actually works fine, but with zero sound with updates 1 and 2. As soon as I get that sorted out I can play it. "
,eightballsmith,2012-11-28T05:28Z,It wouldn't do anything for me either at first. Had to update my realtek sound drivers then it worked. Thanks!
,dman67,2012-11-28T16:22Z,"this is what I did to get the sound working for me....
""Go into the installation folder, then the redist folder then the Directx folder and run DXsetup again. After that go in game and see if you can change audio device, you should be able to. Tip by Rouss3l"""
,rbs49,2012-12-01T01:48Z,"Is this a clean or not?
Can someone confirm this plz?"
,doncollum,2012-12-01T17:57Z,"@dman67

That did it!! Oh, thanks so much for that tip...evidently the BO2 setup doesn't bother with the DirectX setup for some reason, so it needs to be done manually...I can even change the resolution without it crashing now...I'll spread the word.

Thanks again, you da man."
