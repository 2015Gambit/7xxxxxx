but file has no extension (missing .mkv). Not an issue for me but others might run into trouble. Just rename the file by adding the .MKV extension yourself and it should work."
,monkeyslut42,2012-11-25T12:03Z,Not an .mkv or .avi you assface. Can't change it either cause it doesn't have anything to change at the end. Such a waste of f. time.

All I did is I renamed the file by adding the .mkv at the end of the file name."

You obviously have no clue. This IS an .mkv file if you look at the description. Try opening your eyes and read what's in front of you. Typing/adding the .mkv on the end is the solution.

If you weren't so busy f***ing monkeys maybe you'd get a REAL education.
peace out......"
