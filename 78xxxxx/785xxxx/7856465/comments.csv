I appreciate what you do MrUnpopular, but why is the rip 4:3?  I can't help but think with the way technology is today that you would have to go out of your way to NOT make it 16:9. "

,TheAnt3177,2012-11-26T23:36Z,"Well that's a bullshit excuse. If you're going to 'offer what you can', make it the best possible. Stop settling for second-best."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-26T23:57Z,This is the most we can offer lol
