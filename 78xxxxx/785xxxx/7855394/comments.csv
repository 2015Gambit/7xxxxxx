Well, it's something important I have to say. Somewhen I'll have to delete this torrent, because I'll be adding some more discs to the discography (YES, it's not complete).

I have 52 albums/singles, but it has to be 64 albums, and unfortunately the ones I'm missing are very very very difficult to find. So, after I get all the albums missing, I'll delete this torrent and upload a new one.

Don't worry about the time, it will take me a lot of time to get the missing albums, more than 2 months at least.

If somebody could help, these are the CDs I'm looking for (just audio, not video):

1.- KOUGEKI SAIKAI 2008 I.V. ~ HAMETSU NI MUKATTE"" MUBOU NA YORU
2.- ~World Tour Hakai No Yoru extra In Hong Kong~
3.- ~World Tour Hakai No Yoru extra In Hong Kong~ 2
4.- World Tour Live in Tokyo Dome ~ Kougeki Zokku Chuu ~ Muteki Na Yoru
5.- WORLD TOUR Live in YOKOHAMA 2010
6.- X JAPAN BEST - Fan's Best Selection
7.- Forever Love [CD-extra]
8.- Singles ~ Atlantic Years ~
9.- X With Orchestra In Japan
10.- Kyoto Sports Valley Live of Legend
11.- Jade (Downloaded)
12.- Scarlet Love Song (Downloaded).

Thanks fore reading."
