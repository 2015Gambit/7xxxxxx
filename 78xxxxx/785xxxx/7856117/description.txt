U.D.O concert., which passed on November 16, 2011 in Sofia, Bulgaria was professionally removed for release of the new concert DVD which has received the name, Live in Sofia.
Any anniversary provides artists with the perfect opportunity to look back and review the experiences they ve had. And, who realistically, could look back on more Heavy Metal history than Udo Dirkschneider, the legendary founder and frontman of Accept, and now singer with U.D.O.? Dirkschneider's unique voice, his humbleness and consistency of style have made him the fan s favourite. A quarter of a century for U.D.O., and it is time to pop corks all over the world.
