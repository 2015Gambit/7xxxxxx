"Rick Tedesco came up and ripped on guitar for two tunes. The new song More Cowbell rocks live, sure to be a fan favorite at the shows. Managed to get a real good video of the whole show." -Edosaurus

"David played the cowbell.  His dad played in one of the other bands.  There is an art to playing the cowbell and David nailed it! " -Joe Bouchard
