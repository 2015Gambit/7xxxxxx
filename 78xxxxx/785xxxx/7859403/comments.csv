,Polymathj,2012-12-01T18:51Z,"Not everyone watches on computers.  

Mkv = bad."
,Polymathj,2012-12-01T18:53Z,"Plus, it doesn't look like ""English"" it looks the same as the others but massively cropped due to the foreign subs."
,nicknamed,2012-12-02T08:51Z,"If they would keep the foreign subtitles, that would be viewable. It is cropped to 720x224 and it is been cropped too much for me so I am not going to watch this one. Though yes, I think if you want good quality for picture and audio, this is perfectly fine."
