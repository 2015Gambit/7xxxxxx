To the best of my knowledge, Pepé Le Pew: Zee Best Of Zee Best will contain 17 cartoons (despite what the box art says) – including all 15 Chuck Jones’ Pepe cartoons, plus a Freleng Tweety in which he appears in cameo (Dog Pounded), and an odd Art Davis outing (Odor Of The Day). The DVD goes on sale December 27th. The titles included are:

Odor-Able Kitty (1945), Scent-imental Over You (1947), Odor of the Day (1948), For Scent-imental Reasons (1949), Scent-imental Romeo (1951), Little Beau Pepé (1952), Wild Over You (1953), Dog Pounded (1954), The Cats Bah (1954), Past Perfumance (1955), Two Scent’s Worth (1955), Heaven Scent (1956), Touché and Go (1957), Really Scent (1959), Who Scent You?
