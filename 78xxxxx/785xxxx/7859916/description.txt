Match of the Day Two 25.11.2012

Colin Murray introduces highlights from the day's four Premier League fixtures.

Rafael Benitez takes charge of Chelsea for the first time, hosting champions Manchester City, who have recorded only two Premier League victories from 15 visits to Stamford Bridge. Brendan Rodgers takes his Liverpool side to former club Swansea for the first time since his summer switch to Anfield. The Swans won the corresponding fixture 1-0 last season and kept clean sheets in both games against the Reds last term.

The day's other fixtures see Alan Pardew return to former club Southampton with Newcastle, while Tottenham host West Ham in an eagerly-anticipated London derby. There is also another chance to see all of the goals from Saturday's games.
