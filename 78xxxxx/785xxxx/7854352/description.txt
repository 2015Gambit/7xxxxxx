1983 - New Jazz Records / OJCCD 079-2 / CD

The Cats, a 1957 Tommy Flanagan date featuring John Coltrane, Idrees Sulieman and fellow Detroit natives Kenny Burrell, Doug Watkins and Louis Hayes, showcases Flanaganâ€™s compositional talents with four of his original tunes performed by the sextet. The standard â€œHow Long Has This Been Going Onâ€ is presented via trio and showcases Flanaganâ€™s tender touch and Hayesâ€™ brush prowess, with Watkinsâ€™ bass blending perfectly.

â€œEclypsoâ€, with its Caribbean-flavored head, has Flanagan flowing bebop lines with ease and Sulieman blowing a textured trumpet solo in the Fats Navarro-Clifford Brown style. Kenny Burrell, regarded by many as the midpoint guitar master between Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery, shares the melody line on â€œSolaciumâ€ (The tuneâ€™s title is the Latin word for â€˜solaceâ€™). This sentiment is especially true of Flanaganâ€™s and Suliemanâ€™s solos.

John Coltrane, here in his middle period, begins his improvisation languorously but quickly assures with his â€œsheets of soundâ€, squeezing flurries of notes from his horn. Burrell follows suit, starting with a blues-drenched statement of empathy, but filling the arc of his solo with double-time finesse.

The CD closes with a blues, â€œTommyâ€™s Tuneâ€, and tells a similar instrumental story, each player initially mournful but fighting the blue devils of discontent. Rhythm section support is superlative. Coltraneâ€™s cries and Watkinsâ€™ sighs during his one solo on the session are a fitting end: only two of these artists, Hayes and Burrell, remain with us today.
