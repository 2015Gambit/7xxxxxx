,dbouya,2012-11-26T11:39Z,"this is not the steeler game, not the entire steeler game with a huge chunk of the game missing and replaced by the wrong game...well.. no one NO ONE should download this, we weren't warned, and this torrent should be nuked. or taken down by the uploader at least out of courtesy."
,dbouya,2012-11-26T12:22Z,"don't download this, it's wrong video footage, at least partially, go here instead

[V],Nepotu,2012-11-26T15:49Z,"Thank you dbouya  for your reply. I don't if it so or not. I can't watch any torrent that I upload. Anyway it's ripper's fault. I'll try to find another source for this version (720p). BTW, I can't delete the torrent because it can't. Cheers!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-26T16:14Z,"@dbouya: That link: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7859669/NFL.2012.RS.Week12.%2825_nov%29.PIT.Steelers.v.CLE.Browns.540p
it's also a 720p version, not 540p. I have labeled it wrong 540p. Sorry!"
