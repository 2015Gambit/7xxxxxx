,BurglesHams,2012-11-25T08:41Z,"I've been using PirateBay for more than 2 years and have never felt the need to register an account.... until now.  

The reason I registered?  To give a MASSIVE ""THANK YOU"" TO FOOTY!!!!  Your Formula 1 uploads have allowed me to follow this sport for the past year or so, and I'm extremely grateful to you and everyone else that uploads regularly.  Keep up the great work!

Also:  BBC / Sky Sports should pay footy to upload their broadcasts (with advertising) and share them with the world.  I'd happily fork over a few bucks to the broadcaster and the distributor.  Too bad F1 & the broadcasters are too short-sighted to do anything of that sort.

Anyway, thanks again Footy!"
,ftpv014,2012-11-25T12:24Z,Thanks again footy for all the uploads this season.
