Enter "Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage" and see if you have what it takes

the Big Loot against some of the baddest baddies in Pandora, including
hordes of Biker Bandits.  Plus, take special quests from Tiny Tina, Moxxi
and others for extra rewards.  And don't forget to bring your friends --
those higher levels get pretty tough.
