IMAGINE AN AMERICA IN WHICH a vast number of people routinely vote; where voting is easy, accessible to all, and fair; in which campaigns know they cannot win by dividing slivers of the electorate, but by energizing large numbers behind their plans and ideas.

This America is Seven Steps Away.

A Return to Common Sense presents the Brennan Center report on the most critical flaws in our current democratic process and the bold reforms that will revitalize our nation.
End Voter Registration as We Know It
Fix Electronic Voting
Increase Voter Turnout
Campaign Finance Reform
End Partisan Gerrymandering
End the Electoral College
Curb the Imperial Presidency and Fix Congress

A Return to Common Sense is a passionate call for change, a road map for restoring the vision of the Founding Fathers and renewing the great spirit of America where the people run the government and the government works for the people.
