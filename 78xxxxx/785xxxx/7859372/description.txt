Bud Fox is a Wall Street stockbroker in early 1980&#x27;s New York with a strong desire to get to the top. Working for his firm during the day, he spends his spare time working an on angle with the high-powered, extremely successful (but ruthless and greedy) broker Gordon Gekko. Fox finally meets with Gekko, who takes the youth under his wing and explains his philosophy that &#x22;Greed is Good&#x22;. Taking the advice and working closely with Gekko, Fox soon finds himself swept into a world of &#x22;yuppies&#x22;, shady business deals, the &#x22;good life&#x22;, fast money, and fast women; something which is at odds with his family including his estranged father and the blue-collared way Fox was brought up.
