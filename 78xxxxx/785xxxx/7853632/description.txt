258 pages.

Quote from pg 120:

Cinema Paradiso was filmed in the streets and squares of Palazzo Adriano and used many of the locals as extras, conferring fame on the village.
The weeks the film unit and the inhabitants of Palazzo Adriano spent working together are commemorated on a majolica plaque on a corner of Piazza Umberto I.
