,dr-presenterer,2012-11-28T23:36Z,Hi Snowhiter - Just wanted to give you a big thanks for uploading so much high quality drama -- it has been really appreciated.  One little request though -- is it possible to let the credits roll on the remaining episodes of the Killling as the music at the end of each episode gets cut off and destroys the mood which has been built up so brilliantly.  Many thanks again.
,woofdawg2010,2012-12-01T23:12Z,I have watched season 1 & 2 and am looking forward to season 3.  This is by far the best television series that I have seen.  There is another one called Borgen (Government) check it out.  Thanks for the excellent upload!

[V],Snowhiter,2012-12-02T16:33Z,@dr-presenterer - I cut out the credits due to network voiceovers which spoil the mood. There were none on E05/6 so they were left in. The DVD will be available soon to purchase if you wish to truly get the full effect...
