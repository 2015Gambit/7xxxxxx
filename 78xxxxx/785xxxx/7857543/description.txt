Following Julian's murderous rage from last issue, Julian returns to Tony to confide in him. But Tony instead decides to have Julian kill Venus. But being a master manipulator, Venus attempts to get inside of Julian's fragile mind as she asks him why he's the one taking orders rather than giving them. Sparks will fly in the incredible series that reinvents Greek and Roman mythology!
