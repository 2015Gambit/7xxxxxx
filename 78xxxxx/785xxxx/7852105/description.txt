YouΓÇÖve seen it all before. A malicious online rumor costs a company millions. A political sideshow derails the national news cycle and destroys a candidate. Some product or celebrity zooms from total obscurity to viral sensation. What you donΓÇÖt know is that someone is responsible for all this. Usually, someone like me.

IΓÇÖm a media manipulator. In a world where blogs control and distort the news, my job is to control blogsΓÇöas much as any one person can.
 
In todayΓÇÖs cultureΓÇª
1) Blogs like Gawker, Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post drive the media agenda.
2) Bloggers are slaves to money, technology, and deadlines.
3) Manipulators wield these levers to shape everything you read, see and watchΓÇöonline and off.

Why am I giving away these secrets?  Because I'm tired of a world where blogs take indirect bribes, marketers help write the news, reckless journalists spread lies, and no one is accountable for any of it. I'm pulling back the curtain because I don't want anyone else to get blindsided.

IΓÇÖm going to explain exactly how the media really works. What you choose to do with this information is up to you.
