[V],Nepotu,2012-11-25T00:48Z,"Sorry, is NCAA Football!"
,weaping_reaper,2012-11-25T19:55Z,"Shit man, You cut out all the espn logos!!! I wanted to take a vlc snapshot of the ""Saturday Showdown clouds"" logo to put as my wallpaper, But FUCK NO! I SURE CANT, YOU CUT THEM OUT!!!
Can you atleast put up a snapshot of that logo? If you still even have the original?"
,weaping_reaper,2012-11-25T20:07Z,"Still Can't believe you cut out all the logos! FUCK YOU FOR THAT! All Goddamn day yesterday, I was trying to find the ""Saturday Showdown clouds"" logo, But couldn't, So I figured downloading the game from here, I could take a nice little vlc screenshot of it, and put it as my wallpaper, HELL NO, FUCK NO, You took every ESPN logo OUT OF THE GAME, Now I'll never find that fucking pic, thanks to you."
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-26T00:04Z,"You are retarded or what? If anyone up something here, it isn't an obligation, of any kind. How dare insulting me, weeping boy?"
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-11-26T03:16Z,"@Nepotu: Isn't it ironic that the ones who complain the most are the ones who have never uploaded anything! Don't pay any attention to people with idiotic comments. If he wanted the logo, then just Google it and search like everyone else does. Keep on posting."
,weaping_reaper,2012-11-28T06:23Z,"Dumb fucks, The picture I'm looking for isn't on Google.. It was in this game, But not anymore! 
@Nepotu, Yeah, I'm retarded but can somehow  manage to type ""this"" comment, using perfect American grammar. You on the other-hand, can't even construct a sentence without me wondering what the fuck you're talking about. 
Do you still have the original game? if you do, upload a screenshot of the picture I'm looking for. 

""Showdown Saturday"" clouds, espn logo.

P.S, I'm not a boy, fuck head, I'm 25"
