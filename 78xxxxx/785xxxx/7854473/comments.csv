AND THIS SHOULD NOT REQUIRE UPLAY TO WORK OR EVEN BE INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS WORK."
,fishboy11,2012-11-23T22:17Z,"uh-huh, and just why would you need to let the executable through your firewall?"
,zeroeight,2012-11-24T01:56Z,"You asked me about the firewall and thsi is the answer:

If you don't let it through your firewall, it will just sit at a black screen forever. Why it sits there I do not know and don't really care, but if you want to play the game that's what you'll have to do.

Now with this version ONLY, (No other installs, or registry files or any previous aspects of AC III and it's files and installs) if you can manage to get it to work without having to let it through your firewall, all the power to you.

But that is what I had to do to get it working."
,zeroeight,2012-11-25T21:10Z,"So now, can anyone confirm if this allows you to play it just as is and without UPLAY even being installed on your computer?"
