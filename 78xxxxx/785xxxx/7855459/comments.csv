It emulates better than most PS2 games, so it's better on PC rather than PS2. I personally give the game a 8 out of 10, if you liked Metal Gear Solid 2, or Splinter Cell, you should like this game, enjoy."

,Cerebral222,2012-11-24T19:06Z,"@ZtorkX86, yeah, I got a couple of those & they are worth every cent, but I use a PC-PS3 generic wireless controller I bought from ebay for around $20. If you have virtuagirl on your PC, you can have it going while you play emulated PS2 games in full screen, you can't do that with PC games, it's distracting, but fun.

NOTE: Game starts in window mode, just double click the window to toggle between modes, enjoy this very underated gem."
