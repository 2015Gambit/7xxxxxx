The game is promoted as "stealth action inspired by genre-defined espionage classics" and gives players the ability to disguise themselves as any character in the game. The lack of advertising before release and realism in the game are commonly cited as reasons why this game was outshone by its competitors in the stealth genre and sold poorly.

This game is best played on PC, because the graphics are far better on PC than PS2.
Use the PCSX2 v 1.0 which I have included, & use my setup config to begin the game (Very easy) I've been playing this on 2 fairly standard rigs with core 2 duo & half reasonable graphics cards, didn't get a single skip in frame rate. On PC, NTSC or PAL doesn't matter. Everything needed to play this game is included.


For PC, I recommend:

Core 2 Duo 2.4 & above.
Windows XP / VISTA / 7
Graphics card GeForce GT 8800, or ATI 6 series & above.
4 Gig of RAM


For PS2, I recommend:

Need a modded PS2 console; burn at very slow speed to compensate for 
the weak PS2 laser.
