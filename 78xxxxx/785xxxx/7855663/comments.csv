,mlipman,2012-11-25T09:40Z,Doesn't appear to work
[T],helder1965,2012-11-25T11:04Z,"Mlipman, it is working fine here and for thousands of others pals. Maybe you are facing some specific problem of codec or player! PS: anyway, you still can search the ""very much larger"" release base 1080p-XAN in other places and test to play it! Thanks and good luck!"
,upx3,2012-11-25T17:07Z,"Seems to play OK on KMP, but not with VLC or on my WDTV"
,Fuzi0719,2012-11-25T18:19Z,"Confirmed does not work on VLC or on WDTV Streaming Media Player.  IMO, if it doesn't work on VLC then something is seriously wrong with it."
[T],helder1965,2012-11-25T19:39Z,"Here, it plays fine on VLC, but I will check all x264 video encoder settings and parameters! Maybe I can figure out if there is something different from old ""h65"" releases. Thanks for your support."
[T],helder1965,2012-11-25T21:58Z,"Sent a REPACK release fixing a error of x264 codec parameter that could cause missing of video in some players!
Accept my apologies, please!"
,esdii,2012-11-26T01:09Z,Works w/ vlc 1.1.13 FWIW
,temporary2010,2012-11-27T09:26Z,"You're re-encoding these?  All you have to do is download the MP4 from YouTube and remux it to MKV, using something like MKVToolnix (freeware, cross platform).  The 1080p versions are already encoded in H264.
