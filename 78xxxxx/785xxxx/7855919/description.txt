Video2Brain - Getting Started with jQuery

jQuery is rapidly becoming the language of choice for creating web applications and websites capable of running on multiple devices and screen sizes (think cell phone, tablet, desktop). It can dramatically reduce the amount of time spent coding both basic and complex functionality within a website or web application. In the workshop author and trainer Kevin Ruse teaches you the fundamentals of jQuery, which is essentially a code library designed to reduce your development time. YouΓÇÖll learn how to work with the jQuery wrapper, selectors, elements, attributes, events, effects, and more. In no time, youΓÇÖll be up and running and ready to explore the more complex areas of jQuery development.
