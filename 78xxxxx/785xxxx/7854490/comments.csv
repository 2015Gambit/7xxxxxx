actually, the scene did not forget,they released this episode many hours ago  - 

Falcon.S01E02.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA

It's just that no one uploaded it here."
,IotIP,2012-11-25T05:51Z,"Though a gigantic (file size) 720p release isn't wanted, or usuable, by many people (those who want to view on portable devices, those who have limited bandwidth or disc space, those whose eyesight isn't good enough to warrant HD, those with slightly older tech, etc.).
Better quality ""small"" versions by people who know how to properly encode, would be appreciated.
If the series is good enough, like ""Homeland"" ""Breaking Bad"" ""Boardwalk Empire"" ""Luther,"" and many others, I'll get the HD BD disc, myself."

Could download mp4 or mkv but am so used to the good old avi that it will remain always part of my 1st choice over any other format"
