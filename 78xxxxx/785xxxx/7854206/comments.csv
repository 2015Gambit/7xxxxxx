[V],Acesn8s,2012-11-23T19:23Z,Another one of YIFY's torrents http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7853440/End_of_Watch_%282012%29_720p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY 699.71 MB mp4  your a piece of shit mate. I'm glad YIFY pays for your site for you. what kills me is u don't even give him credit.  
[T],micron66,2012-11-23T20:07Z,So this is basically the same file that YIFY encoded/uploaded ? Why rename it and upload as if it's your own encode ?

Some trolls here.."
[H],Cerberuss,2012-11-23T21:08Z,Guys please stop with the abuse comments they are not needed or wanted. reuploading torrents is not against the rules.
[T],micron66,2012-11-23T21:20Z,"@giginho67

no,not trolls .

but taking someone else's encode and re-naming it to look as if you have done the work is pretty lame."

Look at you all high and mighty. Last time I check ""abusive comments"" weren't against the site rules either, so dont tell anyone to stop that either.

and regarding the upload, no its not break any rules, but an when identical file being uploaded is pointless, all its doing is splitting up the seed swarm even more. "
