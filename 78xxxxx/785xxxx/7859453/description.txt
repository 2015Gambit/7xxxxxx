Schematics and service information for virtually every radio made from the beginning of radio through 1954

The Bible for antique radio repair!

This is extracted from a previous torrent that went dormant for ages and the seeder finally came up today.  The problem was that I and many others were sitting at 97.3% for months, and the whole thing was in a single zip file.

This torrent has all the files extracted, and renamed more appropriately and descriptively.  You can download one book, or all 26 books.  There is no sense in waiting for the whole thing to download just to extract a zip file.

Use this torrent, and PLEASE SEED!
