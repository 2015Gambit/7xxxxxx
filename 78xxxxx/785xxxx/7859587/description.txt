
Tony Hawk's Underground


Activision's definitive skateboarding game returns on the 
PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance and PC with 
Tony Hawk's Underground. In a departure from former games 
in the series, Underground gives players the chance to take 
an ambitious non-pro skater from an unknown, to superstar 
status. For the first time in the series, players will be 
able to get off their board and explore the expansive 
levels on foot, or in a vehicle. Customize the look of your 
skater, your skater's tricks, and even create custom 
skateparks. Tony Hawk's Underground features nine sprawling 
courses, as well as a level of freedom and customization 
that is unprecedented in the popular series.
