Status Quo: Hello Quo Access All Areas Edition 
HELLO QUO! Tells the candid, no-holds barred story of Status Quo's astonishing 50 year career as a touring and recording rock band. With 120 million worldwide album sales already under their collective belts, two OBE awards, a million neon lit 'Sold Out' signs, a record 103 appearances on Top of the Pops - you'd think that one of HRH Prince Charles favourite band had nothing more to prove... but never have their lives and career been laid out in such an unabashed and forthright manner. Collecting hours of previously unseen footage and classic live material with full exclusive access to all band members this is the definitive story of a band that has done and seen it all. As well as full access to the band, Hello Quo! Also features input from a host of the biggest names in rock including: Brian May of Queen, Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, Thin Lizzy, Buzzcocks, Slade, Paul Weller, Sir Cliff Richard and Midge Ure. The documentary also exclusively features the moment when the original line up of the band met again for the first time in over 30 years. A truly poignant reunion, after years of legal wrangling, saw the band clear the air but also plug in and play together once again... This Access All Areas Collector s Edition includes 3 hours of astonishing never seen before Quo footage!
