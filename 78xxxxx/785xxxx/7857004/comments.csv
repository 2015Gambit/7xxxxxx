Is there any chance you could do them unzipped in the future? No probs if not...

Cheers!"
,yura15cbx,2012-11-25T12:36Z,"No :( not on this torrent site. unzipped ""Upload error 4"", too big torrent file because too many files."
,Harlekin33,2012-11-28T01:09Z,Thank you som much! I have been waiting for torrent like this for years!
,yura15cbx,2012-11-28T05:09Z,"You are welcome. here's another one of my uploads: thepiratebay.se/torrent/7862134/BOOKS__GENETICS__biology__MOLECULAR_BIOLOGY__etc. not the newest editions, but it may be useful to someone."
