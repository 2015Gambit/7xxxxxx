Also, I will be uploading Galapagos 720p BluRay in the near future as well as How the Universe Works 720p BluRay and South (Wild) Pacific 720p BluRay as well, but it will most likely take quite some time for all these uploads, so patience is necessary!"

That is how torrenting works people.  I don't have good upload speeds, so I can only seed one torrent at a time.  Looking at my last two torrents (Yellowstone 720p BluRay and Great Barrier Reef 720p BluRay), they are already down to single digit seeders.  When I stopped seeding them, there were 20+ seeders.  This is frustrating as an uploader.  Help me out and seed please!"

To Seed means to upload the documentary to other people once you have fully downloaded it.  I appreciate your comment and your seeding.  Also, I do not know what you mean between upload limit and seeding.  I would just love if everyone seeded my torrents a bit so I could go on and upload others without fear of the torrents dying instantly since nobody seeds."

As evident don't limit seeding as it has nothing to do with download, and your torrent downloading client also starts to see after you download it, till u delete from the list. so, just leave it there after download, and it will start to seed"
