https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7855599/Alliance_of_Valiant_Arms_%28A.V.A%29_Aeria_Games

Which has the file ""ava_us_installer_20121115sfx.exe"" in it. I never knew that Aeria A.V.A had other languages different than English, but okay. :)

Let the people on TPB be the judges."

You can take a look over official website.

Download is long because at the moment, only one seeder is available and it's not a server."
