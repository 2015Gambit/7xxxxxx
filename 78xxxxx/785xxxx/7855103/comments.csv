,atlanticjack,2012-11-24T23:07Z,"Thanks for sharing. I had a few problems due to having a previous version of WinZip already installed. Having uninstalled v15.5 Pro and then entered a username into the Keygen and generated a serial I was getting an error message when trying to register.
Error; WinZip could not save your registration credentials in C:ProgramDataSinZipWinZip.sureg. 
Could not write data to file, error code = 5.

Solution; In Windows Explorer make sure hidden files are unhidden. 
Go to C:ProgramDataWinZip then delete file WinZip.sureg
Open WinZip and enter registration details."
