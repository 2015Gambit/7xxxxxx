Techniques are beautifully illustrated with hundreds of gorgeous black and white photos. This special edition adds more than a dozen spectacular color photos, taken during the book's original sessions which appear in gorgeous two page spreads. Also in this edition: a 40th edition preface by Gordon Inkeles that evokes the spirit of San Francisco and tells the story of the book that started the massage revolution.
