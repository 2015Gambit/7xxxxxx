Miklos Bona, "Combinatorics of Permutations"
English | 2004-06-25 | ISBN: 1584884347 | 382 pages | PDF | 3.5 mb

There are 650 articles with the word permutation in the title whose primary classification is combinatorics, but, until now, there have been no books addressing the topic. The very first book to be published on the subject, Combinatorics of Permutations contains a comprehensive, up to date treatment of the subject. Covering both enumerative and external combinatorics, this book can be used as either a graduate text or as a reference for professional mathematicians. The book includes many applications from computer science, molecular biology, probabilistic methods, and pattern avoidance, and the numerous exercises show readers a fairly comprehensive list of recent results from the field.
