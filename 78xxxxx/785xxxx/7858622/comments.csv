,harofreak00,2012-11-29T03:43Z,"Installs fine. Keygen is a false positive virus. Keygen works, here are a few serials: 
GTL3-SQUT3E2EFE70BQ3900
GTL3-RYNTBR7EFEB95AF585
GTL3-TBAGDD5EDE9E4NF933

However this is a fail, as only 10 minutes after installing and forgetting about it, I got a popup that says ""COUNTERFEIT GENIE TIMELINE"" and it no longer works."
