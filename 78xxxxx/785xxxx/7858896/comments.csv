[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-11-26T12:00Z,"@dbranson17: This is hardly meant to be a ""tease"".  This is an entirely new scan, part of an effort to rescan the full series.  DobisP.R.-Novus released the first 3 of the series already under the name Minutemen-EmeraldEmpress.  And will be continuing to release the remainder of the series as time allows.  Once the full run is complete a series pack can be posted for them all. 
In the meantime please refrain from shopping your warez on other people's torrent comments..."
