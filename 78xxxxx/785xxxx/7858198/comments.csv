,sankhasubhra,2012-11-26T14:08Z,thanks for the upload. is there any english sub of any kind?
,rayinsma,2012-11-26T19:38Z,The subs on Opensubtitle do not sync correctly with this file. Probably need to wait for it to come out on DVD in the UK or US!
,black-hound,2012-11-27T00:06Z,"The subs at opensubtitle do not synch because they are mislabelled and not for haneke's 'amour'. they are for a taiwanese movie. 

this is probably some sort of R5 pre-release (i believe russian subs are available). the dvd isn't due till March next year. hence the 'official' subs won't be due till march next year. we can only hope for some kind (french/russian) soul to post 'unofficial' subs in the meantime."

I can't wait to see this!"

,bareed235,2012-12-02T13:53Z,"The English subtitle is available now, and it's synced perfectly with this release.. http://subscene.com/subtitles/amour/english/659067"
,bareed235,2012-12-02T14:02Z,I re-synced the English subtitle with this version. You'll find it in subscene.
