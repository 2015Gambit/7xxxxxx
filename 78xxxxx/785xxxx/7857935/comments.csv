,IndigoAK,2012-11-25T14:41Z,"I had this game when I was a teenager.  At one point, my parents took away the power cord to my computer as punishment for not doing homework, so I borrowed one from a friend and would wait until they were asleep and then play this for hours."

,hopedeny,2012-11-25T18:10Z,"oh man, i remember this game... nostalgia."
,tmcmahon51,2012-11-25T18:45Z,"Wow, nostalgia strikes back. I used to play the hell out of this game, and Shogo: Mobile Armor Division back in the day. Got both in the same box. I think I have it laying around somewhere, too."
,IndigoAK,2012-11-25T23:45Z,"@tmcmahon51: Yes!  That's where I got my copy too.  Blood was before I got heavy into PC gaming, so Shogo was my first Monolith game."
