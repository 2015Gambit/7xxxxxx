In this steamy tale of crime and seduction, Andrei (James Remar) is a charming but devious confidence man living amidst the decadence of Berlin in the 1920s. Andrei becomes infatuated with Pauline (Valentina Vargas), a mysterious but beautiful woman known for her many lovers and her voracious sensual appetite. Andrei and Pauline become lovers, and she finds herself drawn into his scheme to bilk American oil tycoon Sid Slaughter (George Peppard) for a fortune by implicating him in a phony sex scandal. Die Tigerin proved to be the final screen role for actor George Peppard, who died of pneumonia in 1994.
