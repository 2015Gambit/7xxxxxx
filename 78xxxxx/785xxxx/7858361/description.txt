Welcome to the 18th edition of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. In the 62 years since the first edition of this textbook was published, virtually 
every area of medicine has evolved substantially and many new areas haveemerged. In 1949, when the first edition appeared, peptic ulcer disease was thought to be caused by stress, nearly every tumor that was not resected resulted in death, rheumatic heart disease was widely prevalent, and hepatitis B and HIV infection were unknown. In the intervening years, both the infectious cause of and the cure for peptic ulcer disease were identified; advances in diagnosis and treatment made it possible to cure two-thirds of cancers; rheumatic heart disease virtually disappeared; atherosclerotic coronary artery disease waxed and thenΓÇöat least in part through management of modifiable risk factorsΓÇöbegan to wane; hepatitis B and its consequences, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, became preventable by a vaccine; and HIV, first viewed as a uniformly fatal worldwide scourge, became a treatable chronic disease. During this same period, the amount of information required for the 
effective practice of medicine grew unabated, and learning options for students, residents, and practicing physicians also burgeoned to include multiple sources of information in print and electronic formats.
