,_EnderW_,2012-11-23T20:15Z,Minor mistake in creating the torrent.  Edit the trackers and add a blank line between each.
,_EnderW_,2012-11-23T20:22Z,"ignore that last comment.  trackers come out fine as downloaded, at least via magnet link.

proper trackers as uploaded should be:

udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80

udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80

udp://tracker.istole.it:6969

udp://tracker.ccc.de:80"
,I_QBot,2012-11-24T00:33Z,Thanks Bunches. Need this badly...
,_EnderW_,2012-11-24T00:40Z,PLEASE SEED!  The only way these books stay available is if people seed to at least 2.00.

He swore by his transistor amplifier, but looking at this book, I would be willing to state that tubes would be far more adept at attaining the voltage swing.  Cathode followers could be used for impedance matching."
