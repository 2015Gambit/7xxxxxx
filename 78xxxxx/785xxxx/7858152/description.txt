When life takes a turn for the worse, Zoe (Tori Black) and her husband reach desperate times. Afraid of losing her home, Zoe seeks advice from her friend Amber (Stormy Daniels) who lets her in on a little secret: that she's an escort.
Frantic, Zoe decides to try it... just once. Once turns into twice and soon it becomes a way of life. But when tragedy strikes, she's forced to come clean to her husband. Will it tear them apart? Sometimes when you do whatever it takes, you lose the very thing you were trying to save...
In what could be one of Stormy Daniels most defining moments as a director, Whatever It Takes is a potent combination of hot sex, top rate acting performances and inspired vision.
