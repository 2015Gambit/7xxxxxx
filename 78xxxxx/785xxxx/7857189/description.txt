A dying man is found and aided by a small boy. Slowly the man begins to seek the truth behind his past, but the closer he gets to the truth, the more deadly his quest, with cannibals after his blood and nightmarish demons after his soul. What is the secret of the dead man, what has happened in his past that has made him seek out the quiet of the grave? An astonishing secret and a brutal truth will be revealed in this tale of blood and revenge.
