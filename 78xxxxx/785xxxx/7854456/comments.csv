,Rob2042,2012-11-24T08:29Z,"I`m with SpEaKs60.  It`s stupid to upload a movie with no info especially when there are other movies with the same title.  I can`t find one with this title made in 2012.  According to the info supplied by another member it is this one...
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637641/ which was made in 2009.  If it is, it didn`t get high marks on IMDB."

,AddyTzu,2012-11-24T17:25Z,"Why so much hate towards the up? Yes it is preferably to have a imdb link in description, but if there is none, then search your self you lazy fucks. Is it really that hard to copy/paste? And even if it is an less known movie, somewhat harder to find or something like that, first pic is the poster. And if you are incapable to find a movie knowing the name of the movie and the names of 3 actors do the rest of us a favor and do not comment next time. Additionally there is a link in the nfo pic link by up, but i guess since some of you guys cannot be bothered to copy/paste, reading is out of the question.
Thanks LegendET for up.
P.S.: rob2042's link is corect, also present in nfo by LegendET (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637641/)"
,SpEaKs60,2012-11-25T00:09Z,@ Scottjwkelly ~ Look how many agree. 
,SpEaKs60,2012-11-25T00:14Z,"@ AddyTzu ~ All I did was make a CIVIL LEGITIMATE comment, without any ABUSE , unlike you good self, and that makes me a Lazy F***. Sadly you need to look in the mirror."
,shaclac,2012-11-26T22:12Z,"SpEaKs60~ I have to agree with AddyTzu.
it literally takes 1.5 seconds to find the info
If i was the uplopader I would be inclined to put no info in future, its like you complain and I spit in yur oinon rings.
Thanks Legend ET"
