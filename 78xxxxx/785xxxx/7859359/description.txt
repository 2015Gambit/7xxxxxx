What happens when a soldier is no longer a fighter, but turns into a squalid killer. What cruel madness takes over form military discipline and turns defense of country into savage slaughter.  

There are men of power, like Stalin and Saddam Hussein, who are cold mass-killers, and there are those who emerge from the ranks, mens like SS Captain Kahn who wiped out an entire French village.

In War Crimes some of the worst atrocities of the century are analysed in their full horror, as are the men who perpetrated these acts.
