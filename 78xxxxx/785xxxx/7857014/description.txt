Overview:

Machinarium is our first full-length adventure game in which players take on the role of a robot who has been exiled to the scrap heap. You must use logic, collect important items, and solve environmental puzzles to get the robot back into the city of Machinarium so he can rescue his robot girlfriend, save the head of the city, and defeat the bad guys from the Black Cap Brotherhood.

Machinarium is a prime example of why point ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ click adventure games are not dead. It was created by people who clearly love the genre with aim to deliver a top-notch entertainment for all those gamers who really miss the magical world of adventure games. And boy did the developers deliver! Every element--even the smallest ones--are crafted with exceptional care and polish by people who clearly knew what they were doing and loved it. This level of detail is hard to find in most modern games that seem to be mass produced, so it is a very refreshing feeling to see a title that is made with such care and passion.
