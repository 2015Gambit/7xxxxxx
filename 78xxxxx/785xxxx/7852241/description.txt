Ernie Hines - Electrified [1972]

Original Release / We Produce Records / XPS-1902 / CD

An underground set from early 70s Stax Records ΓÇô the only set cut back in the day by Ernie Hines ΓÇô a really great singer who works here with a blend of southern soul and sweet harmony modes! The album's got a pretty laidback vibe, which is great ΓÇô almost in the same space as The Temprees, with an undercurrent of super-dope arrangements, and Ernie's lead vocals right up front in the mix! There's a bit of strings on the set, and most tracks have some sort of harmony support behind Hines' lead ΓÇô a vibe that's a bit different, and maybe almost more east coast than the usual Stax set. Arrangements are by Wardell Quezquerque, Dale Warren, Lester Snell, and Tom Nixon ΓÇô and both The Bar Kays and The MGs play on the record. Titles include the sample classic "Our Generation" ΓÇô plus "Electrified Love", "Sugar Plum", "Change Is Gonna Come", "Your Love (Is All I Need)", and "Come On Y'All". ┬⌐ 1996-2010, Dusty Groove America, Inc.
