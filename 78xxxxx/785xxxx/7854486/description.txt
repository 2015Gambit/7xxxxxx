ALONG WITH KISS, AEROSMITH, AND ANGEL, STARZ WAS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL HARD ROCK BANDS OF THE 70'S. COMBINING HEAVY GUITARS WITH SMOOTH CATCHY VOCALS, STARZ CREATED ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY COPIED SOUNDS OF ALL TIME. ONE LISTEN TO THIS THE FIRST STARZ ALBUM WILL SHOW YOU WHY THEY WERE A MAINSTAY ON THE 70'S SCENE. THE MUSIC THAT HAS INSPIRED ALL OF TODAY'S METAL SUPERSTARS, SOUNDS JUST AS FRESH AND EXCITING TODAY AS IT DID THEN. I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO BRING YOU THE ENTIRE STARZ CATALOG ON CD AND CASSETTE. I THINK YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT STARZ IS ONE OF THE BEST ALL TIME GREATEST METAL BANDS !!!  -BRIAN SLAGLE-

SHE'S JUST A FALLEN ANGEL

She's just a fallen angel
Her dreams are shot to hell.
We're all fallen angels
Can't cha' tell.

She likes the roll
She likes the tuck
Loves to roll it over in the
back of a truck
So all the other girls are
calling her bad.
She's looking for the love that
she's never had - 

I know...

She's just a fallen angel
Her dreams are shot to hell.
We're all fallen angels
Can't cha' tell.

The way that treat that girl
it's so hard to take
Every night she cries until
her little heart breaks.
And she aint got no one to
call her own.
It's her against the world and
she's all alone.

I know...
She's just a fallen angel
Her dreams are shot to hell.
We're all fallen angels
Can't cha' tell.
