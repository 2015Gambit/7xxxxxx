S01E04 of Dave Attell's "Dave's Old Porn" on Showtime. Each week Dave screens a rare gem from his collection of vintage porn and, along with a guest comic, gives it the "MST3K" treatment. Once they've finished skewering the film, they're joined by a Golden Age porn star -- typically a star of the just-viewed film -- for discussion of other scenes drawn from Dave's collection. This week stars Bill Burr and Nina Hartley; the featured film is 1986's "Ultimate Lover."
