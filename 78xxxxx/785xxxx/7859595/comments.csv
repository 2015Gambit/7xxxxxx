,s47000,2012-11-26T05:17Z,"This is a useless torrent.  10GB+ of eBooks (allegedly) zipped into one file.  Please, uploader, unzip the content and retorrent."
,crustard,2012-11-26T05:18Z,"May be a wonderful collection, but it would be good to know what's here before downloading this enormous file."
,triggerjerk,2012-11-26T08:15Z,"Once again, a MOFW (man of few words).

C'mon, somebody dl it and see if there's a virus in there?

OK, let me be the MOFW:

No.  
Fuck No."
,reallytony,2012-11-28T01:51Z,It is a rip of bookboon.com.  Could be useful to some but in my opinion you can get better quality of same books in other places.  The zip has many problems so you lose a lot of books plus the Literature files are .lrf??
