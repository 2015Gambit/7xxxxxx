                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slenderman's Shadow is based off of indie game 'Slender'. It shares the same 
gameplay elements as the original - you must complete the objective while 
avoiding the enemy.

!!!NOTE!!!

I noticed that a ton of people were having problems with the VishnuPacker that 
these all were distributed with.  So I took the liberty of manually unpacking 
each one and then putting them back together in a nice clean autorun interface.  
If anyone needs just a single "map" unpacked, and doesn't want to download this 
entire bit, just let me know which one and I will upload.  Hope it works for you 
guys, as it did solve my problems!

For those who are wondering this bundle includes all maps that have been 
released so far:

Map 1: Sanatorium v1.4 
Map 2: Hospice v1.3
Map 3: Elementary v1.1 
Map 4: Mansion v1.1 
Map 5: Claustrophobia v1.0 
Map 6: 7th Street v1.1
