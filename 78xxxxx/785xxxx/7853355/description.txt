The Beginner's Guide to Cajun Music 1928-55 (2CD) [FLAC] {MKOP}

''It's Said These Sounds Still Hover Over The Louisiana Bayou''

From Joseph Falcon's 'Lafayette' in 1928 to Clifton Chenier's infectious 1955 recordings, this collection spotlights the irresistible appeal of the unique Louisiana hybrid which is Cajun music.This 2-CD set comes to us from Czech-based Primo Music, and whether you're a devoted fan of the infectious musical sound of the transplanted French-speaking Acadians from the Canadian maritimes, now known as Cajuns. Or just curious about this unique genre of "folk" music, this is an excellent album, with surprisingly good sound considering the age of some of the tracks, which date back to 1928 Columbia recordings. Most sung in the quaint patois dialogue developed over many years in Louisiana. Appropriately enough, CD 1 starts off with accordionist Joseph Falcon who went from his southwest Louisiana home with wife Cléoma Breaux to New Orleans in 1928 to record Allons à Lafayette, acknowledged as the first recording of a Cajun tune. From there the discs bring you some of the legends of the genre, including Harry Choates, Jimmy C. Newman and Clifton Chenier. The list of tracks are:
