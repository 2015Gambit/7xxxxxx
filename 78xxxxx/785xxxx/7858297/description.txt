PLOT SUMMARY

Winner of the Best Actor and Best Screenplay awards at the Berlin Film
Festival, and written and directed by Nikolaj Arcel (co-writer of THE
GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) A ROYAL AFFAIR is an epic tale of a passionate
and forbidden romance that changed an entire nation. Denmark, 1766, and
Caroline Mathilde is married to the mad and politically ineffectual King
Christian VII. Ignored by the wild King who chooses to live scandalously
Caroline grows accustomed to a quiet existence in oppressed Copenhagen
When the King returns from a tour of Europe accompanied by Struensee
his new personal physician, Queen Caroline finds an unexpected ally
within the kingdom. The attraction between the two is initially one
of shared ideals and philosophy, but it soon turns into a passionate
and clandestine affair. Committed to the ideals of the Enlightenment
that are banned in Denmark, Struensee convinces the King to assert his
previously untapped power to remove the conservative political council
and implement drastic changes to Danish society. As the Court plot their
return to power and the downfall of the Queen and Struensee, the
consequences of their affair are made clear and the entire nation will
be changed forever
