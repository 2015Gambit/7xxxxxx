                       " Joan ( Sylvia Sidney) is the secretary to the public defender in a large city. She is in love with a career criminal named Eddie (Henry Fonda), and she believes that he is a basically good person who just had some tough breaks. She uses her influence to get him released early, and he tries to go straight after marrying her, but things don't work out, and they both go on the lam."
                        " As superb as Henry Fonda is in portraying the foredoomed hero, Sylvia Sidney is even better as his wife; her reading of such lines as "We just call him...baby" are enough to shrivel the heart even after six decades."
