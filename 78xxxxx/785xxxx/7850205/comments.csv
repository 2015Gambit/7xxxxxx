That is thanks a lot in romanian."
,prince4god,2012-11-23T00:42Z,"Murphy78, I download this and it did not install.  In the process of installing it says files are corrupted.  Please, this is a lot of data consumption in downloading, it is a complete waste of time and resources when it happens like this.

Please, Murphy78, is there anything I can do?  Or have I wasted my data money and time just like that?"
,murphy78,2012-11-23T05:19Z,prince4god if you have another windows 8 on a different flash drive it will sometimes read the wrong files after booting and give that error. I tested these copying them directly from the ISO.  Remove the extra flash drive and you should be just fine installing this.
,murphy78,2012-11-23T09:44Z,"Tested it again, just to be sure. Works perfectly. Make sure you don't have two different usb drives with win8 setup on them."
,mew7946510,2012-11-23T22:01Z,Does it need some activator or something?
,murphy78,2012-11-27T11:52Z,"It will nag you quite a lot to activate if you don't.  There are some legit activators out there that use kms servers and the slmgr infrastructure.  There are also some falsely labeled activators that alter system files to fool the user into thinking the windows is activated by removing the watermark and altering the activation window.  It doesn't fool windows, just the user.  I really haven't played with the hack versions too much, but if you just wanna get rid of nag screens and can't find a legit activator, that might be your cup of tea."
