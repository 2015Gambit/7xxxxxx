[T],blackcanary,2012-11-23T16:41Z,"SchlhcbPrime, this is the hardcover version of the X-Men: Mutant Massacre which has not been uploaded to TPB before.  While the individual issues do exist in other torrents on TPB, the story arc has not been collected into a single torrent (like the excellent job you have done collecting other story arcs).  If a torrent of this story arc was on TPB, I most likely would not have uploaded this.  I hope you enjoy reading this story arc as much as I did. :)"

,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-23T22:54Z,"u didn't hurt MY feelings, bc, just the storage space of TPB. redundant torrents r never kewl."
,STFmaryville,2012-11-24T17:15Z,"Thanks blackcanary. No offense to either of you is intended, but I have downloaded both torrents and this torrent is BY FAR a better scan than the other. The source hardcover has much better paper QUALITY than those old back issues that were the basis of the older individual issue scans. The result is a MUCH better reading experience. Sometimes newer really is better."
