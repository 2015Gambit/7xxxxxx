Information
------------------------------

In 2011, northern Mexico experienced its worst fire season in more than a century. Luckily, Martin Mars, the world's biggest seaplane was there to battle the blaze! Martin Mars has a partner in firefighting - the Sikorsky S76 - which uses HD and infrared cameras, along with state-of-the-art laser technology, to guide the Canadian owned and operated aircraft to a guaranteed bulls-eye with every drop. MIGHTY PLANES joins the four-person aerial crew when they answer the call for help as Mexico's northern states endure countless wildfires that threaten to destroy vast expanses of wilderness.
