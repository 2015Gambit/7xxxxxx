,GSPT,2012-11-24T10:27Z,"Ta very muchly, but how does registration work?"
,ClubQBall,2012-11-24T22:09Z,"Probably would help if you actually *READ* the information provided in the description:

""Install the application.

With root rights, add the following lines to your /etc/hosts
file:
127.0.0.1       digidna.net
127.0.0.1       www.digidna.net

Use our keygen to generate your personalized serial."""
,GSPT,2012-11-24T23:02Z,"Guess it's Google for me to learn what ""roots rights"" and hosts files are and how to enter the information. Guess we can't all be proficient at the technical stuff."
,Rizzo220,2012-11-27T06:13Z,"I had to google wtf this meant also not to fuck it up. Check this out for Terminal help:

* After you confirm DiskAid took the keygen serial, remember to replace digidna.net & www.digidna.net back to what you previously had.

App runs great on Snow Leopard 10.6.8.
Cheers scene4all!"
