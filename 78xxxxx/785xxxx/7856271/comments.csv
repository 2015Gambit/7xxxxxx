because I already tried the famous method described in all web sites and nothing... 

can you help me? 

thanks"
,kmik3nn,2012-11-27T00:24Z,Does it come with vfr charts and full airportlist.bin?
,JAB69,2012-11-27T10:12Z,"Total crap, not complete
PC version holds all you need"
,carcarah1,2012-11-27T19:04Z,These files are for people who know how these work. For those idiots that come here just to criticize I suggest going into jeppesen website and ... buy the software.

,aguilarjacobo,2012-11-28T18:00Z,Is anyone else having problems with IOS 6? I am only able to copy the charts... The waypoints shown are really old and are not updated

,goonre,2012-12-01T02:53Z,Is anybody who upgraded to JeppFD 2.0 seeing enroute charts?
,el_barto7,2012-12-01T22:49Z,"to Goonre, the JeppFD v 2.0 works fine (Charts, Maps, Weather, Etc.) Tested.

on DiskAid (preferences, advanced, enable: display all apps, show hidden & show root)

then navigate to JeppFD, Documnets, Data and Delete: Enroute & TermCharts. copy the ones that comes woth the torrent.

Good Luck"
,okkie79,2012-12-02T13:35Z,"@ el_barto7 what am i doing wrong, I do exactly what you discribed. When I only do the terminal charts I have all airports, with probably old enroute.
When I copy the enroute I have nothing left. No enroute and no terminal charts"
,el_barto7,2012-12-03T04:57Z,"to Okkie79, First rule of Hacking, Never Expect a Stable o Easy Hack.

Try this: on iPad setting, Apps-JeppFD select ON to ""Reset User Settings & Deactivate"" the run JeppFD, press OK and continue. after that, go to Home Screen and Delete the JeppFD from your iPad. Turn Off then On the iPad.

Re-Install the JeppFD, when done (Do not Open it) copy the Enroute & TermCharts directories using DiskAid. Should Work!"
,okkie79,2012-12-03T07:47Z,"to el_barto7, thanks but it doesn't work. If i don't open the app 1st, there's no data folder in documents in diskaid. So i can't copy it anywhere"
,Scopy83,2012-12-03T08:08Z,"ANYONE KNOWS SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB 2, TO ANDROID??

Thanksss"
