Video2Brain - Getting Started with iOS 5

With hundreds of thousands of apps in AppleΓÇÖs App Store and research groups such as Gartner estimating the value of the mobile app market at around $30 billion for 2013, building apps for iOS is certainly big business. In this workshop, creative technologist and trainer Robert Turrall teaches you how to apply your programming knowledge to creating apps; the course assumes that you will have a basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, but no previous iOS experience is necessary. After learning the basics of Objective-C and Cocoa Touch, youΓÇÖll work along with Robert to create a series of increasingly complex apps. Once youΓÇÖre done, you will feel confident in your ability to build and test iOS apps and ready to get in on the action.
