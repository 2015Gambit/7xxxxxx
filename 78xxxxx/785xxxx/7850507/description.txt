Consider the fact that in certain ways, we're all alike as human beings.

We are all like everybody else when it comes to culture or country. However, we are also all unique, made differently - even in twins!

But yet, some of us tend to be like certain groups of people while others are clustered together with others as a different and distinct group.

Is this a coincidence?

Of course not...

Once you start to identify certain patterns and manerisms, predictibility and understanding comes into play and you will know how to deal with people in a certain way that is completely different to someone else!

Consider this...

Research has been done on people throughout the world and regardless of culture or national borders, the behavioral patterns are so damn predictable, it's almost as though the same group of people are produced from the same 'factory'!

This fact is alarming because the secret to successful communications, business success, fulfilling relationships and enjoying friendships are all tied to this in one way or another!

Do you understand it's significance?

You deserve better. You can be more efficient. With the years of experience I've poured into this book, you will lack nothing. You will be able to know yourself deeply and get results with others!
