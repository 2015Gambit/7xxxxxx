,Lightsplasher,2012-11-23T21:02Z,Thanks a lot for your good work !! Will you upload Marvel Now's comics ?
[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-11-24T01:46Z,"@Lightsplasher:  Sure, whichever ones Novus does, I will be uploading, which I believe will be quite a few.  Feel free to check out the Marvel NOW books I've already posted to-date.  Namely Uncanny Avengers, All New X-Men, X-Men Legacy.  Indestructible Hulk, and Journey Into Mystery will either be posted in the next couple of days, or be included in my weekly Novus pack on Tuesday night. :)"
