With so much emphasis these days on making students globally competitive and prepared to beat students of other nations on international assessments, and with so much talk about academic rigor and emphasis on rigid accountability measures, we are in danger of losing sight of the most fundamental element of successful teaching and learning ΓÇö love. Teaching Kids to Love Learning, Not Just Endure It makes the case that if we really want "no child left behind" we must return to the solid foundation on which successful teaching and learning has always rested ΓÇö the love of teacher for her students (and they for her) and the passion of the teacher for her discipline and her desire to share that passion with her students.
