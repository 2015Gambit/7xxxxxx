FIRECRACKER was nominated for the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

You remember, don't you? The impossibly winsome girl with the tortoise-shell specs who staged a bloodless coup on MTV thanks to a strategically-placed cut on the REALITY BITES soundtrack? The one who shamelessly pledged allegiance to Olivia Newton John and endeared herself to every teenage girl with a diary full of subversive secrets? She's back for a second round of radio-friendly alterna-pop on FIRECRACKER. Loeb earned a Grammy nomination for her last effort, and a legion of fans who will find this album full of the same sparkly pop-rock confections they gobbled up so avidly on the gold-certified TAILS.
