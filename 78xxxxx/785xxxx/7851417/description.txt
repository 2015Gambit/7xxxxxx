Cleveland Brown (Mike Henry) and his family and friends are back for more

Cleveland discovers a conspiracy behind hip-hop music; pursues his dream of
becoming a Major League Baseball scout; and befriends the family's new physician,
Dr. Fist (recurring guest voice Bryan Cranston). Also, Donna takes her run for
local office way too seriously, and Cleveland Jr. takes Rallo under his wing
after a lice outbreak at school forces him to chop off his beloved 'fro.
