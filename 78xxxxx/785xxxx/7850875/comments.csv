,Cee9,2012-11-23T01:03Z,Game freezes when LAN is selected. Torgue DLC (incl. Update 1.2.2) works perfectly.
,edman3d,2012-11-23T08:36Z,Does this fix the Hamachi patch version mismatch error?
,Whitebb,2012-11-23T15:41Z,"Got it, the LAN crash caused by the Skidrow patch 1.2.2 crack content, to fix it install Skidrow patch 1.2.2 and DLC's patch, then install the crack content from previous patch 1.2.2 (not for skidrow)
Skidrow please release new crack for 1.2.2."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-23T23:26Z,"Sounds like a bad crack from Skidrow. And people whine that P2P stuff is inferior to ""Skidrow"" stuff all the fucking time. Wake up. They have good and bad releases like everyone does.

This one missed a few spots that were not missed by the P2P version.

I could be mistaken, but I think this one will fix all that mess. And it should work just fine on the Skidrow release too. Remember that P2P is not always shit, and ""Scene"" is not always better. This one proves that quite well.

,zeroeight,2012-11-25T23:22Z,"This doesn't work, game won't even launch after installing what's in this torrent."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-26T06:22Z,"@Ciechan

While you may be telling the truth and trying to help, I for one do not know you, and have not seen a ""Skidrom Crackfix"" for this as with other releases in the past. Frankly I suspect this is a trojan. I advise extreme caution to all out there until this is an official crackfix, and the MD5 of the files can be verified.

If I am just being paranoid, then I apologize and thank you for the help. If not, well you already know what to do with yourself. :)"
,DL11523,2012-11-27T23:45Z,game stopped working after i installed this
,DL11523,2012-11-29T01:26Z,"i fixed the problem of the game not starting.
turns out you have to replace the default install directory of SKIDROWs original release from
C:Program Files (x86)2K GamesBorderlands 2
to
C:Program Files (x86)2K GamesGearbox SoftwareBorderlands 2
so i just reinstalled the game with this directory,
installed this update then the DLC pack and now everythings running perfectly."
,noekk,2012-11-30T18:16Z,Is there a Win 8 .exe with this ?
,zeroeight,2012-12-01T16:33Z,"I have gone through every single upload of the game, the 1.2.2 update, and DLC, from every frigging site I can possible find (Easily over 25 sites) and not one of them work in any combination.

Every single one of these starts the game then goes dead.

I'm sick and tired of people leaving comments saying this works fine when it doesn't work at all"
,ToshiroRyuu,2012-12-02T01:41Z,"Every time I start the game the main icon pops up but then says BL2 stopped working. Then I close the program and another window pops up saying ""can't bind to native class WillowGame.WillowAnimNodeBlendWheeledPawn"" followed by some addresses with filename not found. does anyone else have this problem or have a solution?
