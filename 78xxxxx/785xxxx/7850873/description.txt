The 4-Hour Chef isnΓÇÖt just a cookbook. ItΓÇÖs a choose-your-own-adventure guide to the world of rapid learning.

#1 New York Times bestselling author (and lifelong non-cook) Tim Ferriss takes you from Manhattan to Okinawa, and from Silicon Valley to Calcutta, unearthing the secrets of the worldΓÇÖs fastest learners and greatest chefs. Ferriss uses cooking to explain ΓÇ£meta-learning,ΓÇ¥ a step-by-step process that can be used to master anything, whether searing steak or shooting 3-pointers in basketball. That is the real ΓÇ£recipeΓÇ¥ of The 4-Hour Chef.

You'll train inside the kitchen for everything outside the kitchen. Featuring tips and tricks from chess prodigies, world-renowned chefs, pro athletes, master sommeliers, super models, and everyone in between, this ΓÇ£cookbook for people who donΓÇÖt buy cookbooksΓÇ¥ is a guide to mastering cooking and life.

The 4-Hour Chef is a five-stop journey through the art and science of learning:

1. META-LEARNING. Before you learn to cook, you must learn to learn. META charts the path to doubling your learning potential.

2. THE DOMESTIC. DOM is where you learn the building blocks of cooking. These are the ABCs (techniques) that can take you from Dr, Seuss to Shakespeare.

3. THE WILD. Becoming a master student requires self-sufficiency in all things. WILD teaches you to hunt, forage, and survive.

4. THE SCIENTIST. SCI is the mad scientist and modernist painter wrapped into one. This is where you rediscover whimsy and wonder.

5. THE PROFESSIONAL. Swaraj, a term usually associated with Mahatma Gandhi, can be translated as ΓÇ£self-rule.ΓÇ¥ In PRO, weΓÇÖll look at how the best in the world become the best in the world, and how you can chart your own path far beyond this book.
