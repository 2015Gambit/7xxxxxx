,Fan_of_Claudia_z,2012-11-25T00:48Z,"Thanks again, MsF.

That episode didn't air in Australia. 

What happened was that the network which had Y&R was about 3 or 4 years behind. Then, sometime in the early 2000s or maybe late nineties, they ran a series of ""catch up"" compilation episodes. 

Even then that didn't make them current. 

So, this ep was one we've never seen, nor have we seen one with that intro.

Thanks again."
