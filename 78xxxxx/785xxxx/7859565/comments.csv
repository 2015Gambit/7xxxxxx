,seven7hson,2012-11-26T00:05Z,"@footy. Just want to take this opportunity to thank you for a season well covered. Like others have already said, for some of us we wouldn't have enjoyed the season as much as we did had it not been for your superb job. Keep up the good work mate, ""See"" you next season. "
,drew1972,2012-11-26T00:37Z,This is the last time I'll get to say this this year.  Thank you so much for all of the Formula One uploads that you've provided this year.  I am grateful for your generosity of spirit.  I hope to see your F1 posts again in 2013.
,nobodynever,2012-11-26T01:02Z,"I doubt you read these but:

I live in the US and there is absolutely no way to watch if not for ULs to TPB.  I got into the sport in 2009 from downloading races.  In 2010 I started giving a shit about qualy.  A few weeks ago I went to the race in Austin.  If it wasn't for your efforts, and the ease of watching I wouldn't have gone, wouldn't have cared.  Thanks for doing what is seemingly a thankless job.  

Also, he puts standard def for the xbox'ers and hd for PC viewing.  That's a ton more work.  Thanks again from damn-near-Canada."
,nobodynever,2012-11-26T01:05Z,"I also doubt I'd have joined a Karting League either it not for you, footy."
[V],footy,2012-11-26T01:22Z,"@ nobodynever: I do read the comments, All the best in the Karting League.

I am glad that you have all enjoyed this season, there may be a few more uploads to come for this season, like the season review.

,bjporno,2012-11-26T20:57Z,"@footy, where to begin! 2012 has been a difficult year for me, but every other week or so this sport gave me a few hours of escape. Mostly due to economic reasons it was almost impossible to watch the races live, but thanks to you I have seen every qualification and race this season. In the long run I guess you could say you were one of the persons that made 2012 just a little bit easier. Thank you"
,bjporno,2012-11-26T21:03Z,Wow... is that my username.. never trust your friends to create accounts for you I guess. So sorry
,Incognito2781,2012-11-27T02:15Z,"Any Chance of the SKY coverage in HD footy ?
and Id like to know where the show went after it was cut off after the post race, did it continue ? or did they just go off air ?"
[V],footy,2012-11-28T21:58Z,"The post race stopped after they said their goodbyes, there was no interview with Seb."
