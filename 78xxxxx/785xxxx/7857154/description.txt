Islam and Healing: Loss and Recovery of an Indo-Muslim Medical Tradition, 1600-1900



This e-book traces the Islamic healing traditions interaction with Indian society and politics as they evolved in tandem from 1600 to 1900, and demonstrates how an in-house struggle for hegemony can be as potent as external power in defining medical, social and national modernity. This is a pioneering work on the social and medical history of Indian Islam.
