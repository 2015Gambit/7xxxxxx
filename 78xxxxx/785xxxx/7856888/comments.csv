1. Can I allow DVDFab internet access? When starting, it displays ""Accessing Server Information""?
2. I ""Firewalled"" it - denying it any internet access.
3. Is this necessary? Does the ""cracked"" DVDFab still display this even if it is allowed internet access?
4. When displaying this message it seems to take a long time to start and I wondered if this is because I denied it internet access."

You just don't want it to update cause if it does the crack is trash. Not sure if there's other security issues but that's the main one."
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-25T03:49Z,"I unchecked the ""Update"" box. It's whether of not the crack prevents a server check that I am curious about?"
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-25T19:57Z,"[I may have to wait for an updated version. I am using v9.0.1.1]
Whether I allow the program internet access or not, it seems buggy - keeps crashing. And, when I do get as far as a DVD Copy, it complains about not being able to access the output DVD Writer. I have two DVD writers and tried swapping the source and destination disks in each to no avail. And, I tried accessing the drive it complained about with another program [EB's CloneDVD] with no problem."
,thewongg,2012-11-28T02:41Z,"Note:  This version of DVDFab will dial home every time it is first opened regardless of how you set the ""auto update"" checkbox.  This will prevent ""never expire"" from showing in the license.  The only workaround (for now) is to either block DVDFab in your firewall or disconnect the internet when opening DVDFab.
Another note:  this version does crash occasionally whether using the trial version or the cracked version.  It has nothing to do with the crack itself.  I am using Windows 7 64 bit."

,greyaburton,2012-12-01T16:30Z,patch is out for the newest one and it works.can find it on here.
,gpb59,2012-12-01T19:01Z,"can't figure out how to use the dvd creator.  When you open the directory that has the files, you have to add them one at a time?  Then when I went to start, it dose one task and then stops.  wonder if it's just me.  If anybody has any answers I'd appreciate it"
,greyaburton,2012-12-02T02:30Z,"if your trying to create dvd from avi files etc.i use a free program called dvd flick that works good.converts the file or files to dvd format then burns them to a dvd.never tried using dvd fab for it though, as i found dvd flick easy to use for that purpose."
