This is the ONLY exception that I agree with (love the song)

Consider knocking and those who knock.
Observe that about 85% of the time, it's an odd number (usually 3 or 5).
Unless a second knock is required and then it's an even number (usually 4).
So, everyone should start telling knock knock knock jokes.
