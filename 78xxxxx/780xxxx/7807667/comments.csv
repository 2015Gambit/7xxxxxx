,creative3,2012-11-09T08:54Z,"@irawan83,
Welcome dear,

I have seen that there are many windows 8 pro which first need to activate and for this users were spending hours to search cracks/activators but either failed to activate or if activated those were rejected by the Microsoft when they wanted to upgrade to WMC with their legit key.
Then I made this ISO which will not require any activator or cracks or any KMS host server. just use your WMC key and get activated online legally.
Nothing added or removed from the original ISO from MSDN account but I little house keeping. I just modified the data.dat file  and its done. data.dat file is just of 17 kb size.

Hope now users will get relieved from searching activators or cracks or fake activation.

Have a nice day."

dear, did you download it? no, then how did you judge that this is fake?
first download, check that, check with antivirus and then pass comment.
don't you think without downloading or checking passing a comment is itself a FAKE?
next time do not pass comment without checking the stuff please. I appreciate your concern but passing comment without testing is misleading others.
I do not have hard feeling against you.
have a nice day. "
,creative3,2012-11-11T14:57Z,"@petrus7,
I have read those lines carefully and then went forward,
those lines says if you obtained your wmc key then you must use it before 1st Feb 2013. further it says that it will contact your via your email to remind you to use your obtained wmc key to activate before 1st Feb 2013.
but let me clear your concept that once it is activated it will not be deactivated even after 31st March 2013. MS will only reminds you about the activation period and that is activation before 1st Feb 2013. this means activation with this wmc free key can only be done until January 31, 2013 but this does not mean that once you activated it will be deactivated after 31st Jan 2013.  Once activated will remain activated forever permanent.
Half reading and quarter perceiving is disastrous for yourself and others too.
so please stop misleading others.   "

hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.

Mean time I succesfully installed this on Virtual Box. And updating right now. thank alot creative3 for this work. But creative3 can you tell me it is future proof? Will this activation ever black listed? Second can i use this key lator on for re installing (I don't think microsoft keep this free media pack for ever)"
,creative3,2012-11-17T02:51Z,"@Mutant_Gu,
dear, activation is permanent forever and it can't be blacklisted in future.
But the bad news is that you can't use this key to activate your windows after 1st Feb 2013.
but you can make a system image of your activated windows and can be restored at any time even after 1st Feb 2013. 
I do not know why you are not able to upgrade from win7 to win8. there is two way to upgrade your wind7.
1. running set-up file as an admin from your windows. just extract the iso and run setup. if it does not work, then
2. boot from win8 prowmc DVD/usb stick and then try to upgrade it. it should work in this  way."
,chaiyont2,2012-11-17T12:10Z,"This works perfectly. It is not fake. You do need the free media key from MS and use that for the install. if you mess up (like I did) you can change it later without any 3rd party software. Thanks, Creative!"

I am never worried about ratings, if it works 100 percent I recommend. And yes Microsoft is totally brain dead to allow this hole. Yes a slip can be made anyway, but why provide the whole yourself.

dear, problems are at your end. please confirm that your system has the following minimum specs:
C =30 GB around where you want to install windows
RAM = 2 GB and more, 
Processor = 2 GHz, Dual core, Core2Duo, or later.
otherwise please install 32 bits windows 8.

,creative3,2012-11-19T08:17Z,"@ nikhilbhargav,
there is two ways to upgrade.
1. Extract/Mount the ISO and run the setup as an administrator
2. boot From DVD and run the upgrade.

try 1st method . if not successful in 1st method then boot from DVD and upgrade.

your all files and compatible programs/applications will remain as it is. "

please do not get panic, its still working. your delayed because of weekend. when they say 24 hours that means one working day.
you will sure receive your free wmc key but in your case it will take 48 hours to 60 hours.

have a nice day."

bro i hv a prob
i am upgrading my hard disk frm 500gb to 1 tb
that means i m gonna loose my windows 8
is there any way i cn get the same windows with the same activation key on my new hard disk
prob arose due to some other sites and posts saying that windows installation gets bound with hardware..and if change in hardware takes place then activation is lost...pls help "
,creative3,2012-11-20T05:38Z,"@meecheevous,
dear, from where did you download that ISO?
please download from my torrent and it will never give such an error. Please do not mess up your download with this torrent as you have downloaded from somewhere else and certainly not from my torrent.
My torrent has only one file and that is Win8_Pro_WMC_x64_En.iso and it does not have any thing extra, certainly not any text file or any cd key.
so please first download from my torrent and your wmc upgrade key will work like charms."
,creative3,2012-11-20T05:47Z,"@vikky66,
better download windows 8 pro with media center from this torrent and have fresh install on new HDD with your wmc key. activation is free till 1st Feb 2013.
but if you have many other applications installed then you can make a system image back up and can be restored on new HDD but I am not sure if it will work as sometimes hardware change refutes the activation. but there is no problem in trying this. if fails then have fresh install with this windows 8 pro media centre ISO and use your wmc key to activate it online. will work like charms."

buddy i also thought that...but i hv already used my wmc key to install windows 8 in this hdd...if i use it again to install in new one then online activation might create a problem bcz the key has been already activated online once...thats wat my concern is.."
,Mutant_Gu,2012-11-20T06:52Z,"I have a boot up issue here. This is not related to this torrent i think. But i use this ISO. I'm writing this only to get some help if any one get the same issue. This is not a problem of this torrent.. This is my personal problem.

I have cleaned install windows 8 pro by formatting. Previously i was using windows 7. 
Pc was running smooth 2 days. But now i have this weired problem that PC switching off itself with out showing the login screeen.
All i see is windows booting then PC switching off. But it look like a shut down i don't see like crash. It happens just after the windows loading screen. (Blue windows and below small circle rotate as dots)

But there is a way that i can avoid it that is to press some key in key board.. Then it goes to logon screen with out any problem. If i don't press a key it just switching off itsef and it is pretty annoying. Once i go inside (By pressing any key in keyboard) i don't find any warning or errors in event viewer. There is no sign of system crash. I checked power plans. nothing wrong here. It just running Balanced profile. Only change i have done is Disable the hybrid sleep because i have a UPS. 

There is no heating issue here. Becase if i press a key and hold in keyboard it just goes and work with out any problem as long as i want. But with out a key press while or after loading it is geting off itself.

you can use your wmc key on new hdd, no problem. it will work. If not then grab one or two more from microsoft as this offer is free till 31st Jan 2013, you just need different email ID and nothing else."
,creative3,2012-11-20T09:14Z,"@Mutant_Gu,
please give me info on the following:

size of windows partition, How much filled and empty
whether your windows partition is C drive or not if not the what is on C drive.

Blind suggestion:
as you said your system was working well for 2 days so did you try to restore your system to a restore point 2 days earlier?
try using a restore point on which your system was working well."
