The year is 1934, a time of two-fisted swashbuckling, of fearsome threats and wild adventure-and of ever-growing threats on the horizon. Three valiant humans -- Flash Gordon, Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov -- are plucked from the Earth, traveling to the distant planet Mongo. Their exploits are legendary, battling the machinations and terror schemes of the dreaded emperor Ming, the All-Seeing Ruler of Mongo. But they did not fight alone...Written by Eric Trautmann (Vampirella, Red Sonja), from a story and designs by Alex Ross (Kingdom Come, Marvels, Project: Superpowers), and illustrated by Daniel Lindro.

Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist #6 - The Rebels in the Walls
As Earth burns beneath the might of a Mongo-allied Third Reich, Ming the Merciless's domination plans are on the cusp of success. With two universes at stake, the only hope lies with Flash Gordon, Dale Arden and Dr. Hans Zarkov. Allegiances are forged and battle lines are drawn as Dynamite adds to the legend of the greatest space fantasy hero of all.

Flash Gordon: Zeitgeist #7 - Pomp & CircumStance
As Ming prepares for the final offensive against the Earth, Flash Gordon -- and allies both new and old -- moves against Ming's palace. Fighting alongside his fellow Earthmen, the brilliant Dr. Zarkov and the beautiful Dale Arden, Gordon leads a rebel band into the teeth of Ming's fearsome defenses. But will even the universe's greatest hero be in time?
