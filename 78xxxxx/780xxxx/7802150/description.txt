Creationism Conspiracy Road Trip
Tue 9 Oct 2012 00:30

Comedian Andrew Maxwell takes five British creationists
to the west coast of America to try to convince them
that evolution rather than creationism explains how we
all got here.

Stuck on a bus across 2,000 miles of dustbowl roads with
these passionate believers, Maxwell tackles some firmly
held beliefs - could the Earth be only 6,000 years old,
and did humans and T-Rex really live side by side?

It's a bumpy ride as he's confronted with some lively
debates along the way, but by the end could he possibly
win over any of these believers with what he regards as
hard scientific fact?
