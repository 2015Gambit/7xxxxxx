Cecilie Ore: "Codex Temporis" (1996)

(Contemporary.  Electro-Acoustic. Avant-garde.)


- This monumental composition really is something else.

All 4 pieces are written for amplified(!) classical instruments.

Two for amplified string quartets and two for amplified ensembles.



Now... ...Turn up your volume, press play, and get ready for a journey into the unknown!
