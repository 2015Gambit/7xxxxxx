,LAMBORGHINI39M,2012-11-09T12:31Z,thanks a lot
,ThatTunechi,2012-11-09T22:42Z,i guess ur the only 1 that uploads tna now.its kinda said cuz tna has got a lot better than what it was.if it  keeps on the same path i see great things for tna.this show i think is better than most smackdowns so wwe should be shitting bricks soon.theres no reason why there cant be 2 wrestling companies without 1 getting bought by the other.
,rustedhalo,2012-11-11T08:35Z,"Video plays off in VLC, like off FPS had to use QT and even then video skips for the first hour and then both audio and video skips. I'd expect better from a HDTV 2.4GB release. If this was anything but wrestling it'd be unwatchable. "
[T],SCSA420,2012-11-12T21:21Z,"Sure is funny NONE of the problems you describe are happening here so go buy yourself a new pc or learn how to install and configure the KLITE codec pack full version and use media player classic home cinema that comes with klite to play the video because it plays EVERYTHING unlike VLC that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't I think VLC is a piece of shit. I got 2 words for you:

VLC SUCKS"
,rustedhalo,2012-11-13T04:13Z,"Hey SCSA420, I'm just leaving my comments about the video. Nothing against you. We all have our personal preferences with media players. Nothing wrong with my computer and I've used VLC for years with never a problem or need to install second party codecs. I'm just leaving a review of the video for others who may be d/ling since another source didn't up this episode. cheers."
,Sprungli,2012-11-13T22:05Z,Thanks again SCSA420 you're the king of wrestling torrents! And thanks for the advice about KLITE it solved a bunch of problems it was having. :)
,Sprungli,2012-11-13T23:47Z,I don't know if I've ever had one of these files play correctly without a huge hassle though. Usually have to set an audio delay. Watched hundreds of videos with no problems but SCSA420 is doing something different from everybody else. Wish he would just make normal videos. :(
,Sprungli,2012-11-14T00:33Z,Converting to .mkv and then watching with KMPlayer makes it work.
