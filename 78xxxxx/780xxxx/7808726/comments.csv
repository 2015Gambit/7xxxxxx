hi everyone, 
(1)there is a virus in the Activators so avoid using antivirus as it will delete the files and windows will crash.
(2) In Windows updates, change settings to check but don't install automatically and by installing (KB2756872 update) you have to run the activator again but not fix.
(3) Buy Windows 8 if affordable for you!!!!!!!!!!~
(4) If you are not an advance user and that also means if you don't know what restore points are then disable windows update.
(5) Every single time you guy install any software or update please create Windows Restore Points, only if you think windows is out of bad luck.
