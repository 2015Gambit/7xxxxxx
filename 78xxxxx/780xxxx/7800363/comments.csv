Don't know if you saw this request from Scarab torrent comments: i have yet to see any Roy Thompkins or Trailer Trash comics on TPB, or any Johnny Ryan's work including Angry Youth. I grew up reading these along with Daniel Clowes and Peter Bagge and was wondering if you had any comics by or similar to these fine storytellers. Thanks again!"

No, totally missed that comment, and I try to catch them all. 

Yeah, I can do Angry Youth for sure. In fact, it was already on the upload list. Got a couple other things with Ryan in them, but not his own books. I'll see what else I can find. Trailer Trash is a hard one to find. I only have one issue myself. But I'll see if I can find more of them or some other Roy Thompkins stuff."
