,dhjudasx,2012-11-17T08:07Z,Appreciate the comment Brenton.... Now that i'm somewhat back and have another 50+ encodes ready to upload.... soon as I get some rest and recover a bit and things prepped.... i'll be back to uploading a new movie approximately every 24 hours again. I've been on holidays for the past week.
,Phenom100,2012-11-19T09:30Z,"@judas: I've have this movie as 3gb 1080p mkv hardcoded subs and another 1080p of YIFY
deleted both fr ur work..
Thanks mate.. Yeah and well soon u will get the trust skull or an other status which is superior to it. If possible can u UL Lord of the Rings Trilogy in 1080p Extended version max size limit to 4.36gb. Video rate same as avatar or more :) Please take this one request for the love of 5.1
and yeah Enjoy ur holidays.

,dhjudasx,2012-11-20T09:58Z,"Actually i just finished ripping the Bluray Directors Extended version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy...

I haven't encoded.. but i intend on doing 2 encodes of the first movie with 2 different methods.... see which one turns out best..

As it stands, looks like they are definitely going to average out to around the 3-4 gb range... i do not expect them to surpass 4gb though.

We'll see"
,Phenom100,2012-11-20T12:09Z,"yeah 2 diff encodes of FOTR Extended, very well then.. After ur done with the encodes u might as well post some screen shots n A/V specs here and Do u intend to keep the audio @192?
I mean I have my 1080p rips @ 192 but I still feel 320/384 should do.. as u are keeping to max 4gb, pls do the 5.1 @320 or 384 please I beg u judas.. The Trilogy deserves such audio & I guess it will not make the size more than 4.3gb

Anyway fingers crossed & just try once with the 384 audio please."
,dhjudasx,2012-11-20T17:11Z,"AAC shines at the lower bitrates, that's what it was designed for. At higher bitrates it doesn't really improve things at all much. If i were to break from my current 192kbps 5.1 audio, and jump to 384 (because idealy that'd be the thing to do) I'd likely switch over to DTS or DD which would make the audio more compatible with users running Toslink/coax/fiber digital audio connections.

This would increase the file size by about 500-800MB or potentially more depending on the length of the film.

My audio equipment here that i'm using is proffesional grade, Bumping the AAC encode from 192kbps to 256 or 320 make litterally very little to nearly no difference, any audio improvements are in the 40khz or higher range, and even then it's very very suttle and only noticeably different if you use a tool that can graph out and compare original audio frequency, crush and distortion/audio anomolies.

Provided the AAC 192kbps encode isn't rushed and it is handle properly... it will sound fantastic still... the HE-AAC/LC combo encoding method is about as high level as you can get. Yify's uses a LC encode only which saves on file space (although very marginally) and it also is less work to decode due to being a smidge more simplistic. Frankly i don't see any real benefit of doing it that way just to scrape a couple megabytes at best.

I will see how the encodes fair first... I may revisit the audio again, but like i said, my testing really doesn't warrant the extra space required."
,Phenom100,2012-11-20T19:26Z,"Okay 1st of all thank u fr replyin & ur patience. Secondly I hardly know anything about audio encode..
All i can say is Do u knw the trusted uploader murdoc47? I did his godfather 1080ps which hav 384kbps ac3.
All I know is .aac is good @192 constant or vbr and fr ac3 384-640 is legit. So as 384 ac3 is supported by mp4's too u may opt it (only if ac3 is supported fr some standalone mp4 dvd players or xbox or ps3) If not AAC @ 192 would be enough fr a file size of 3-4gb

I've seen Kingdom release rips with 320 vbr aac bt quite hard to dload fr lack of seeds and huge size @ 5-6gb fr each!

As i recollect ur a Techie & anything u encode is the best interest of all users. Just upp the Video to 3000kbps and audio (ur choice)

Eagerly waiting sir :)

I'd be blessed if u can give some of ur gyaan (knowledge) abt encoding the way u do the 1080ps with both 2.1 and 5.1.. pls I'd start with starxrip software that u suggested and upp some trial rips :)

Don't get pissed I'm asking coz I'm fascinated after seeing ur work. On the contrary YIFY's work just made me drop the idea.
Pls oblige in ur leisure time.

May the force be with you :)"

,dhjudasx,2012-11-20T19:48Z,"Not pissed or anything at all lol.... More people uploading good work would be best...

Staxrip is a good place to start no doubt... I could send you a template to follow if you like.... I still prefer to do everything command line/scripted... "
,Phenom100,2012-11-21T05:13Z,"yeah pls do send some tips to the mail and
Mr. Genius I use win 7 with 3gb RAM as memory could u think my pc can use the ""command line/scripted"" that u do.. or does it req more RAM?coz If it's possible I'll be able to make rips like u that work like a cake! :)"
,dhjudasx,2012-11-21T16:27Z,"Doing your own scripted command line is something best suited for someone very well experienced with it and that has created their own script, that way if something needs to be changed or adjusted, it's not a confusing unfamilare mess... Best to start with a gui program than it is to jump straight into scripted command line."
