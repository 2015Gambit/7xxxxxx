,jboydgolfer,2012-11-08T23:13Z,"I find it hilarious how ALL of their Names have 2-a's or 2 d's or 2 h's. It look's like it's a joke , or a prank or something.
Example:Sameer,,,Kapoor,,,Bagga,,Chhabra. That shit is hilarious, especially if it is real. Also why Does EVERY single one of these ABORTIONS have to do with some guy or girls village??? Aren't any of these Savages civilized??"

,forgive,2012-11-10T15:54Z,"vivaldi0, you have a valid point that it may be easier to classify movies from Hollywood, Bollywood, etc. But by using this forum to vent out your anger against non-American nationals, you are losing the plot, and diverting attention from your key demand. Instead, try & focus on amassing a critical mass of votes to have classified video sections. Derogatory & abusive language only spreads hatred & negative energy. I'm sure you have seen ""Inside Job"" - the documentary on economic slowdown - it was an Indian economist who warned of the crisis much earlier. Look at your country's present debt status - but for low-cost BPO destinations, your economy may crumble sooner. Look at the growing number of US nationals working in India and elsewhere. Come to terms with the fact that we're living in an increasingly globalized world. Stay positive, stay united, and strive to keep the freedom of internet. Agree?"
,forgive,2012-11-11T05:53Z,"@vivaldi0, the world becoming globalized is not your or my call, its a fact no matter what. But noticing how you like making things personal on every occasion (like bringing up the caste angle now out of no where), I tend to agree with @Geofizz. You are obviously oblivious to Madonna learning yoga, Katy Perry and Russell Brand falling in love with India (and getting married here like Liz Hurley), Julia Roberts being spellbound by Indian traditions, Goldie Hawn meditating in India, Oprah Winfrey and Russell Brand supporting Indian art and fashion, Mischa Barton finding India ""truly amazing"", JLo and Paris Hilton adorning saree-inspired gowns, and even President Obama praising India's resilience, celebrating Diwali at the White House, generating thousands of jobs for Americans and raising $10b in new contracts for US exports to India during his India visit in 2010, and saying that India and US ""are two great republics dedicated to the liberty and justice and equality of all people"". Sitting there on your couch in another country, you will only be mistaken about the cats and dogs. When you plan to visit India, remember what Obama said - “You don’t just visit India, you experience India.”"
,abhi9818,2012-11-11T16:17Z,"@vivaldi0: LMA) after reading ur comments.. to weed out garbage, you can simply Search whatever u want, IMHO its high time u polish you searching Techniques... 
I suspect what u claim to be, a .Net Developer?? Gimme a break man.. U cant be if u dont know simple searching techniques. From your comments you appear to be a Mothrfukin Retard, who has gone imbecile after being sexually abused as a kid by his own father ;)"
