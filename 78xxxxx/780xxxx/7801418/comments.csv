,hitchup,2012-11-08T10:35Z,"Thanks, aarque! ...... what happens to P3D?"
,aarque,2012-11-09T02:39Z,"hitchup, unknown. I have not started messing with P3D yet, but comments I read imply it is a vast improvement over FSX. I am given to understand one can travel underwater in P3D.
 This installer asks which sim to install to, so presumably the plane works fine in P3D."
