Modern Marvels Volume 27 - Ron Garney, published in 2011 by TwoMorrows. The art is great, and the interview is good too. I like the parts about what an asshole Bob Harras was as Editor-in-Chief at Marvel in the late 1990s, although Garney is too polite to say much you can read between the lines. The image here is a rejected Captain America cover where Cap is standing atop a mound of dead soldiers. The cover was redrawn with Cap atop a hill. This is dedicated to LeonardTSpock who uploaded a ton of the first 25 MM volumes for me awhile back. Credit to the original scanner!
