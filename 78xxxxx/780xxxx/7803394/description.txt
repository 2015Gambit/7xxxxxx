45 Powerful Kettlebell Workouts and Training ProgramsΓÇöto Inspire You in Your Quest for Athletic Excellence
 Since 2001 and the worldΓÇÖs first Russian Kettlebell Challenge (RKC) Instructor Certification workshop, thousands of individualsΓÇömartial artists, first responders, military, and fitness and strength professionals, have learned how to use kettlebells quickly and safely. And then introduce the remarkable benefits of the kettelbell to a global community of kettlebell enthusiasts.


Many of these RKCs have created a wide variety of effective workout programs for their clients, customers, teams, and units. So, who better to answer the question ΓÇ£How do I use kettlebells to get the best possible results for ME and MY goals?ΓÇ¥ than these same RKCs?

 We asked the RKC Instructors to submit their most prized workouts, so you can not only see, but also use proven programs that have been successfully used by these qualified experts. The result became The RKC Book of Strength and Conditioning, replete with time-tested, results-producing kettlebell workouts that can satisfy the needs of newbie and pro alike, for years to come.

Some workouts are used to develop strength. Some are used for conditioning. All have produced results either for the instructors themselves, their clients, or both. Enjoy the pain!
