,BrazilianHybrid,2012-11-08T16:35Z,"In what format is this movie in? avi, mp4? Can this be played on the ps3? Thank you for your answer"
,gaama,2012-11-08T18:10Z,why is my download insanely slow?
,Eolo_DaSilva,2012-11-08T18:27Z,"@ BrazilianHybrid normalmente ĂŠ em formato mkv, mas podes perguntar em http://publichd.eu/index.php?page=torrent-details&id=ddaf5458ea64f0d306b59bcdac683946e22d9506"
,hsinghg,2012-11-08T19:01Z,"@BrazilianHybrid: The format(well, actually the container) is mkv.
As far as it running on a PS3 is concerned, if you are planning to run it from a pen-drive, no(since a file-size greater than 4GB is not allowed in FAT32).
I suggest you download a 1080p rip of less than 4GB of mp4 format(never download avi, quality sucks) since that should work perfectly, though of very slightly lower quality than an 7GB rip."
,RENOBPHACE,2012-11-08T19:07Z,"@gaama

It's slow because there's 10 times the amount of people downloading the file than there is seeding it."
,viemaillot,2012-11-08T19:58Z,Is it the unrated version?
,BrazilianHybrid,2012-11-08T23:11Z,"Thank you hsinghg for the input, e valeu Eolo_DaSilva (sou brasileiro tb :) )"
