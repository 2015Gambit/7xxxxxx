You don't have to create any folder... The folders were created when you installed the game..

Go to ""C:UsersINSERT YOUR PC USERNAME HEREDocumentsCriterion GamesNeed For Speed(TM) Most Wanted""

Now copy the files from this torrent into that folder, replacing the originals.

If you have a saved game that you want to continue using later, then back up your files before replacing with the torrent files."
