International biobank collaborations allow for studies with large number of subjects where generalizability of findings across populations can be investigated, which means establishing quality criteria concerning the nature of the sample, conditions of sample storage, and the adequacy of available information is of vital importance. Methods in Biobanking brings together contributions from experts in the field in order to aid in the establishment of this much needed consistency. The volume discusses how to use existing collections of biological material to answer significant questions concerning the cause of disease without violating the personal integrity of participating sample donors, the ethical issues surrounding biobanks, guidelines for the use of coding systems and the use of biocomputing and registry linkages in research projects, as well as many other key subjects. As a volume in the highly successful Methods in Molecular BiologyΓäó series, this collection provides the kind of detailed description and implementation advice that is crucial for getting optimal results. Authoritative and cutting-edge, Methods in Biobanking seeks to provide scientists with the tools necessary to take advantage of the tremendous current resources of the worldΓÇÖs biobanks and strengthen those resources for the future.
