The.Return.Of.Starbuck.v01 is a FANEDIT of the last Galactica 1980 episode redone so it could easily fit as the last episode of Battlestar Galactica 1978. All images and dialog from Dr Z and Bearded Adama were removed and the opening introductions and credits were changed to 1978 versions. This Fanedit is 45minutes 1second and the Original is 46minutes 10seconds.
