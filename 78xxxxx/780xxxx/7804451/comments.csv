""Battlestar Galactic 1980 FANEDIT The Return Of Starbuck v01""
This is a FANEDIT of the last Galactica 1980 episode with Dr Z and Bearded Adama removed and the credits changed. It works very well as the last episode of Battlestar Galactica 1978. Please enjoy and share!

If you need the PAR FILES and can share them too, please download them here:

,bsg4you,2012-11-09T06:59Z,"According to the BSG wiki, Glen Larsen was fed up with Gal1980 and got his friend Dirk Benedict to come back to do a good episode and maybe revive Gal1980. It got cancelled right after this though. http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/The_Return_of_Starbuck#Official_Statements
I like TROS more than the 1978 episodes - it is really outstanding and telegraphs many of the themes in BSG 2003. Not having the few minutes of silly Dr Z and Bearded Adama makes it all the better. Thanks for your interest!"
