,ricyb_ricky,2012-11-07T18:51Z,Just tried.. but none of these 4 options are working. Simply says that cant contact the KMS server. Can i install a KMS server locally? how to do it
,CoryTheGreat,2012-11-07T20:48Z,"@ricyb_ricky
Please re-install MY retail version Windows 8 from the link. The servers are still working for me. Make sure you're running as Admin. I forgot to include the README because I was rushing to get this up for you guys...

Also,
Go here and sign up to get it free from Microsoft:

,beechyboy,2012-11-09T01:26Z,How long will the activation last?
,bert16,2012-11-09T02:58Z,"What I don't understand is, if in order to activate permanently with WMC, do you have to download and install something? Where does it prompt you to enter a key?"
,netusername,2012-11-09T03:13Z,"@bert16 ""Where does it prompt you to enter a key?""


AFTER activating using the activators in this torrent, 
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search. (If youâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;re using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, and then click Search).
Enter add features in the search box, and then tap or click Settings.
Tap or click Add features to Windows 8.
Then tap or click I already have a product key.
Enter the product key, and then click Next.
Read the license terms, select the check box to accept the license terms, and then click Add features."
