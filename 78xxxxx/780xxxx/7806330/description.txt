Had trouble copying data originally, corrupt disc.
Built the previous Live Wires from a 352x240 file. Finally able to recover data
from disc but with unrecoverable read errors which distort small spots momentarily.
The clarity is much better than the previous copy so i am putting it up.
Handbrake handles the errors fine. Not set up for re-recording original tape now.
