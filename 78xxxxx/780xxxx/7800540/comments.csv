,dragonbandit314,2012-11-08T00:45Z,"Part 59 is an odd place to stop.
I feel sure you still have so much more to offer.
All of your efforts are appreciated and I will seed to at least 10:1 as usual.
Be well T."
[V],80zforever,2012-11-08T04:54Z,"welcome guys. enjoy. dragon, you're damn right, stopping at vol 59 seems odd but it looks like it's the last one. and thanks for seeding."
,r.trifun,2012-11-08T08:08Z,"Wow, how many more rare and, unleast probably for most of us, unknown songs. 
80z, your contribution is immense, you've enriched musical history with so many valuable songs, that would have otherwise been overlooked and forgotten. For that we can't ever thank you enough.
Please continue bringing this kind of joy to our lives, unleast from time to time.
Cheers.  "

[V],80zforever,2012-11-10T06:41Z,"r.trifun, thanks man. I don't know why I did what the useless recording companies must have done. I think they are responsible to enrich the musical history with all their big paid bosses LOL. Just imagine if they would release these on CD?"
