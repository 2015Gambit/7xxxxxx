Waiting For The Sun (Steve Hoffman Vinyl Remaster) 

180+ Pure Virgin Vinyl-Analogue Pressing (DCC LPZ 2049) remastered by Steve Hoffman using an all vaccum tube cutting system.

Viny transfer made using the following great gear:

Turntable: VPI Scoutmaster Signature Plus
Tonearm: Trans-Fi Termninator
Cartridge: Audio-Technica AT33PTG
Preamp: Pro-Ject Tubebox

Thanks to PBTHAL. I prefer these over the recent Kevin Grey Remasters...
