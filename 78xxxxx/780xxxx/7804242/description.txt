Here is the season finale of BBCΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Masters Of MoneyΓÇ¥.

Season 1 , Episode 3: Marx

Stephanie Flanders, the BBCΓÇÖs economics editor, explores the work of Karl Marx, the 19th-century German intellectual who argued the capitalist system needed to be abolished as its inherent unfairness meant it was destined to collapse. She considers whether his theories could provide solutions to the current global financial crisis, and tries to separate his economic analysis from the atrocities carried out by political regimes that claimed to be inspired by his thinking.
