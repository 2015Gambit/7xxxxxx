,AlexLibman,2012-11-09T07:56Z,"1%ers?  Republicans and Libertarians combined got 49% of the popular vote.  They weren't bribed into voting - they voted for their freedom.  Millions more chose not to dignify the inherently-corrupt system of collectivist violence, that you call democracy, with their participation.  Thus the idiots who were bribed to vote with handouts of stolen loot sadly had a very slim majority.  If votes were weighed by the competence and intelligence of each voter, Obama would have lost in a landslide!"
