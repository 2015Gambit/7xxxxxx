Athena.and.Helo.v2 is a 1080p video, 5.1 surround sound audio TRUE FANEDIT of Battlestar Galactica 2003-2009 that includes all of Athena's story and her relationship with Helo. Some Helo material is included that doesn't directly relate to Athena, for example Helo's time with Boomer in the miniseries and most of The Woman King story. All scenes where Athena has a line and almost every frame of when Athena was on screen is included. Additionally, Athena.and.Helo.v2 includes all non-Boomer Eights that are on the Galactica or around Helo, e.g. Rebel Eight from The Hub, the construction worker Eights, etc. This began as an edit with every Battlestar Galactica scene Grace Park was in and developed into Athena.and.Helo and Boomer.and.Chief. There is a standalone release for The Face Of The Enemy webisodes. Compared to Athena.and.Helo.v01, Athena.and.Helo.v2 is much more carefully edited, has fewer editing and encoding errors, has 448Kbps instead of 320Kbps audio, and the video and audio quality are better with v02 since Handbrake was used.
