NOTE: I personally suggest viewing this amazing release using VLC Media Player, which you can download at:
 
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

NOTE: You can change/disable the subtitles if you would like, by Right Click, Subtitle, Disable Subtitle.  You can also change/disable subtitles by tapping the V key.

NOTE: You can change the audio by tapping the B key if you wish to listen to the score or commentary.

NOTE: Some scenes are still a bit grainy in this release, and in EP04 some dark areas are get pixelated a bit, but I saw there were no releases on TPB with DTS audio, so I decided to get this off Usenet and upload it.  Overall, the video looks phenomenal other than those dark spots.

NOTE: Lastly, obviously this will be a slow upload.  Not only is the size very large (47gb), but I do not have constant Internet access.  This means that many times there will be no seeders, but you need to be patient.  This upload may take a couple of weeks, if not more.  If you are dying to see it, I would suggest you all setting EP01 to high priority in your bittorrent client, and then to EP02 after that, etc.
