,TheScribe56,2012-11-09T22:21Z,"I'm 62-year old white guy so hip-hop ain't exactly my style, but I'm from Chicago and the Bulls hat won me over.  Besides, being ""Mr & Mrs"" is old school and I'm always for that."

,lynnedebin,2012-11-09T22:31Z,"Love it - good job, people! Going in my weight-lifting mix"
,FlopoMarx,2012-11-09T22:47Z,"Thank you for sharing this. I may never have heard this new music any other way. I like the fact that the artists are so willing to give this to the public. If  downloading this helps the artists in their endeavors in some small way, then I am glad they can benefit from their generosity. I am not the poster boy of what may be considered a hip hop fan but I really like their music. I may be a retired 56 year old white guy from Kentucky but I recognize talent when I see it. I wish these young people much success and look forward to hearing more of their work in the future. Thank you Pirate Bay for showcasing Mr. & Mrs. music. I appreciate it very much."

,92mattster,2012-11-10T01:11Z,Can't you see that RDawgg where just kidding? I for one loled when I read it.
,maxchillen1,2012-11-10T02:20Z,"I heard the word nigger (nigga-whatever) and turned your video off. The word is never going to go away until black people stop using it. Until then, white people are going to keep calling black people that. Isn't it well past time for change?"
,ta2ed,2012-11-10T03:21Z,"always somebody around that wants to bitch and whine about something. they have the right of freedom of speech and expression so shut up and stop being negative.

The lyrics are generic  and auto-tune has never done anyone anyone any favors, just shows you can't sing and need a silly crutch."

,solly69er,2012-11-10T11:18Z,"lol Don't why niggers be bitching bout niggers saying nigger. Let the nigger be. Our ancestors fought so that the ""white man"" should stop oppressing us. So by us niggers saying nigger is like saying fuck the man your use of such terms don't mean shit no more. Nigger be over that."
,slicer_05,2012-11-10T12:00Z,"Respect to you Mr and Mrs for doing this :D

,ShaTR,2012-11-10T20:48Z,"Listened to the video. Not bad, just not that great either. Kinda mundane. Good beat, good video, but the lyrics were SOOOOO generic. No intricacies, no changups in the flow, not tellin any kinda real story. "

,Malakore,2012-11-11T01:31Z,"I really like this open minded approach of 2012. Deliver the stuff to people of Earth for free and then give them opportunity to buy it if they like it.

Result = free commercial + all customers will be happy ones.

You are smart, I wish you good luck."
,8899liava,2012-11-11T02:09Z,Not my cuppa tea but good luck!
,1subgenius,2012-11-11T02:13Z,"I posted this on the FLAC download:
""Will check out. 
BTW the future is hi-def audio/video, so thanks for this.
Artists take note. You went to all that trouble to record your stuff and you know how it should sound, make it available in a format that captures all the effort you put into it. Some sort of universal lossless format.
I'll say it again: hi-def audio is the future.
Or the present for some of us."""
,MorrisMorris,2012-11-11T03:29Z,"You both are very talented emcees, and the production is sweet. I am so happy to hear rap about real life, as opposed to ignorance over drum tracks. I wish you much success, and I will tell all my friends about you. I am also a DJ, and i'll gladly play your tracks during my sets, and tell the crowd where to get your music. One love! 

-Morris "
,MagicSunny,2012-11-11T09:47Z,Man thats awsome...I love a variety of music from hip hop to french house to jazz.... I'm a connoisseur. I only get shivers and warm feelings off really cool music. I played Surrender and it gave me shivers and a head buzz. Very cool!!!
