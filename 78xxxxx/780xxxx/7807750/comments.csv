,burt007,2012-11-09T08:25Z,Why is this not working? I have deleted the torrent I created in my computer and downloaded this one after uploading it to piratebay.se but it does not show 100% and seeding.
,burt007,2012-11-09T08:28Z,"It shows 1 seed and 2 peers, DHT is not working. Please someone tell me what I am doing wrong? I created this torrent using Utorrent software version 3.2, the latest I think."
,burt007,2012-11-09T09:02Z,"Finaly, at last it is working, I removed it from utorrent and downloaded it again and it works now."

Not at this moments but I will look into it. I am using windows 7 so I will install and see what happenes. Please keep checking the comments."

I just double clicked the .exe file and it worked flawlessly I am using windows 7 build 7601 professional version. May be rightclick on the installer and use the run as administrator option. If you still have problems let me know, may be we can figure it out together."
