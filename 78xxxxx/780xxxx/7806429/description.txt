'Know also, O prince, that in the selfsame days that the Cimmerian did stalk the Hyborian Kingdoms, one of the few swords worthy to cross with his was that of Red Sonja, warrior-woman out of majestic Hyrkania. Forced to flee her homeland because she spurned the advances of a king and slew him instead, she rode west across the Turanian steppes and into the shadowed mists of legendry.' -- - The Nemedian Chronicles The story of Sonja's march to the throne continues as writer Joshua Ortega and artist Mel Rubi weave an incredible tale of intrigue and power in the ancient lands of Hyboria!
