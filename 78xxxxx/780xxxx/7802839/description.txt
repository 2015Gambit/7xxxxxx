"SycAmour is a band thatΓÇÖs difficult to put in a box. Citing influences such as pop duo, ΓÇ£Panic At The Disco!ΓÇ¥, and the nearly diametric ΓÇ£The Devil Wears PradaΓÇ¥, it's clear that SycAmourΓÇÖs roots are spread through more than one soil. 

The 6 piece hails from Michigan with one main objective as a band: To motivate love and growth in as many people as possible. Through music that is above all else, emotive, and catchy to boot, Sycamour combines familiar, honest, and theatrical to assure they stick with their listeners."

We will rape and pillage your ears, and you will like it.
