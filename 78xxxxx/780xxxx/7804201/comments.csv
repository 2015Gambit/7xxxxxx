,thorhammer2000,2012-11-08T11:43Z,@Longhorn93 - it worked just fine and is a very nice HQ upload. Many thanks for sharing!
,Longhorn93,2012-11-08T15:48Z,So do I leave my computer open? I will be traveling soon and will need to shut down at times.
,drlsmg,2012-11-08T18:56Z,"Once you have seeded it fully, and you can see other people are seeding (the number of seeders is above 1) then you can shut down and travel without an issue, as other people can seed the file for you (they have 100% of it and are sharing it back).
Does that help?"
