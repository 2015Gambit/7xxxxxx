,5-click,2012-11-07T16:29Z,Thank you as always for the new EB. I love your all-in-one packages. 
,shallow2,2012-11-07T21:38Z,"@5-click: Prefer the all in one packs too, but now we get the WMV's a good hour before the MP4's, and dont get the pics until 1-2 hrs after the MP4's. And that is way past my bedtime ;)

Also, uploading and seeding the WMV's only is quite fast, and then we can take one mp4+pics at a time the next afternoon before next evenings new releases.."
