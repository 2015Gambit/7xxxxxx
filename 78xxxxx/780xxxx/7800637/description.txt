One of those mostly unknown and nearly forgotten books that contains early work from a long list of artists and writers who would go on to do seminal, popular and important work in all levels of the industry over the coming decades (in fact, some had been working before this book, and many of them are still working today).

I could make note of any number of names and the work they went on to do, but, being me, I'm going to focus on Dave Sim, creator, writer and artist on Cerebus for 300 issues (yes, with a huge help from Ger in the art department - but Ger ain't in Quack!). Issues 3-5 contain some of Sim's early, pre-Cerebus work, 'The Beavers'.

Also of note, Michael T. Gilbert's, 'E.Z. Wolf', a character that went on to appear in several of its own books. 

Also, early Howard Chaykin, Dave Stevens, Sergio Aragones, Ken Macklin and, obviously, others.
