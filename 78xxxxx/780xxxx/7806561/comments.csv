there are thousands of people having these issues, even on the official EZTV forums. i am one of them, i have done nothing to update my codecs on any of my computers, i have done nothing to either of my xbox, i have not changed tversity settings in anyway, the ONLY thing i've done lately is update adobe flash .. 

X264 files.. whether MP4 or MKV played just fine, either off a thumbdrive on the xbox, or in WMP, MPC, or VLC .. on both my desktop and laptop computers, throughh media center, or system video player alone or system player tversity on my xbox's from any of my computers. i've always used klite mega and x64 packs, never had an issue.

now all of a sudden NO X264 files PLAY, i get format not supported errors, through tversity from any of my computers my xbox just hangs on black screen unresposive for 15minutes, WMP, VLC, and MPC all give my render errors or nothing at all, no resizing or anything... i've attempted to follow others by changing splitters, internal and external decoders, .. gone as far as to try the files on a brand new install with up to date drivers and codecs.. NO LUCK AT ALL"

 in a rural area where cable or broadcast tv is not an option.. and satilite is to f'n expensive. TPB pretty much all i got most days when i'm stuck in bed.. that or look at the wall for several hours... in conclusion , NON-X264 PLEASE!!! "
