When Professor Simon vanished, the Air Force shanghaied the professor's son to Groom Lake to take over the job of babysitting the "problem" residents of Delta Hanger. Now Kirby Simon has to not only process that aliens actually exist, but the fact his father has been running a refugee camp for them under Area 51 without the government's knowledge and the acting up of the "Deltas" has been a cover for the alien's plan to save the professor from his captors. A plan that involves Kirby leading them...whether he's ready or not.
