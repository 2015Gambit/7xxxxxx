,Aoishiro,2012-11-10T11:45Z,"I'm trying to remember old game like this. Not too old,i played it back in 2007-2008? it's on PC. I remember we can customize the ship as well, i remember the strongest weapon is some kind of hexagonal beam thing and a blue orb kind of thing circling the ship. All i can't remember is the title, Anyone who know the title of the game would be much appreciated."
,Doniazade,2012-11-10T16:35Z,"Aoishiro: Sounds like Jets'n'Guns. Fantastic game, one of the best horizontal shmups ever. Great music too."
,VRBUniversal,2012-11-11T00:46Z,Ty
,CommonsCarnival,2012-11-11T03:55Z,"Great game. Doesn't take up a lot of space of your hard-drive and the chapters and missions are pretty quick, so its a fun diversion when you only have several minutes and want to 'blow off some steam(punk)'. Really cool and dark story with great soundtrack."
,Aoishiro,2012-11-11T06:43Z,"@Doniazade. Thanks. It is Jets 'n' Guns, now i can play it again."
,nitsy15,2012-11-11T12:03Z,please can u upload windows 8 pro retail DVD
,codeir,2012-11-11T12:04Z,Great! Thanks!
,SandRunneR,2012-11-11T14:33Z,"Me and my friend both have the same problem... The voice-over is in hungarian, and it can't be changed. I tried using the Launcher, as well as changing it in the SKIDROW.ini. Anyone knows a possible solution?"
,SandRunneR,2012-11-11T14:43Z,"Sorry... I just found out that there are no english voice-over, only hungarian."

,dany31,2012-11-12T16:43Z,"Thank you for the upload ez the game is very nice,it reminds me about those older games :)I only encountered one problem,my controller is not working with this game,anyone else have this issue ?"
,Stefanovics,2012-11-12T19:39Z,"anyone who's whining over the voiceover:
IT'S A HUNGARIAN GAME!
There's a english and other languages in the menu, and subtitles for crying out loud!

Show some empathy! 99% of the games voiceovers are ENGLISH! If they didin't choose french or german or spanish in the install.

so now you get a hungarian game with subtitle, is it that bad? We hungarians are getting used to subtitled games, SO STOP WHINING, IT'S A GREAT GAME!"
,Rezhan,2012-11-15T01:28Z,"Stefanovics : Actually, half of the staff who made the game is japanese AND american. It's a great team who made a great game, and they clearly said that they wanted the voices to stay in Hungarian because it sounded more fantasy-like than dubbing.
And I do agree, since I don't speak a word of Hungarian, It fits perfectly the whole ambiant.

Also, thanks for the upload"
