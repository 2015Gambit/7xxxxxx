Robert Shaw, Genevieve Bujold and James Earl Jones star in this lusty, rollicking pirate adventure set in the 18th Century Caribbean.

After rescuing his friend Nick Debrett (Jones) from execution, swaggering buccaneer Red Ned Lynch (Shaw) comes to the aid of wronged noblewoman Jane Barnet (Bujold).

The feisty lady is also good with a sword, and together the three attempt to free the citizens of Jamaica from the evil Lord Durant (Peter Boyle). It's treachery, romance and treasure in this entertaining action-filled high seas epic.
