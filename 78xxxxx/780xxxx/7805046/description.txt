The Raven is noted for its musicality, stylized language and supernatural atmosphere, it tells of the mysterious visit of a talking raven to a distraught lover, tracing his slow descent into madness. This illustrated version contains detailed, masterly engravings by Gustave Dorés, from a 19th-century edition of The Raven, among the most popular American poems ever written. Dreamlike, otherworldly illustrations perfectly capture the bleak despair and mournful musings of Poe’s poem. Includes an introduction/analysis by Edmund. C. Stedman.
