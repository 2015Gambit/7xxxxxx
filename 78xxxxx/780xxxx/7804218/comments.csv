I assure it's safe though, I've run it on multiple comps, and sandboxies, and VM's. You're best bet is always to just disable your AV, use the keygen, then either delete the keygen, or add it to the exceptions list, then turn your AV back on. That should clear up any confusion or fuss haha. Happy writing!!!"
