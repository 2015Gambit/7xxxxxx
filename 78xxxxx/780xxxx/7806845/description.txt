2011 GRAMMY NOMINEE: BEST COUNTRY PERFORMANCE BY A DUO OR GROUP WITH VOCALS & BEST BLUEGRASS ALBUM 

The SteelDrivers, the distinctive combo who uniquely meld back-country high lonesome and Delta soul, return with their much anticipated follow up to their acclaimed Rounder Records' self-titled 2008 debut. Returning to the studio with producer Luke Wooten (Alison Krauss, Jim Lauderdale and Dierks Bentley), the follow up continues to stretch the boundaries of bluegrass.
