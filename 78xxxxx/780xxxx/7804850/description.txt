 Kanji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) is an atheist, who  
 runs an antique shop. For him, God and         
 religion are nothing more than a business      
 proposition as he goes ahead making money      
 by selling the faith of people for his profit  
 His life suddenly is thrown off gear as        
 an earthquake ironically destructs only        
 his shop in the entire area. while his         
 detractors blame it on his atheism that        
 led to God's wrath, Kanji remains unperturbed  
 and finds his victory with the insurance.      
 They promptly reject the claim stating an      
 earthquake to be an 'act of god' rather than   
 a man-made phenomenon.Kanji takes GOD to       
 court when his shop is destroyed by earthquake.
