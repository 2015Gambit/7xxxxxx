Always appreciated :)"
,r.trifun,2012-11-11T12:05Z,"How rare these albums are, and yet how fresh, free-spirited and beautiful they are. 
I'm affraid that the ones who appreciate this kind of music could hardly be the big paid bosses of the record companies, that you 80z mentioned in the previous comment. If these bosses were free-spirited, they certainly wouldn't be that well paid or bosses in a record company nowadays LOL.
Thanks once again. This should be seeded forever.
Cheers."

[V],80zforever,2012-11-12T23:55Z,"Thanks for taking the time and commenting on my posts. This is the labor of love, so positive feedback is an encouragement to rip and post more music. From the other hand these records are nothing special. They are just part of this '80s library. "
