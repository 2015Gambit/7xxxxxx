""This album (Deftones â&#x20AC;&#x201D; Koi No Yokan (2012) [FLAC]) seems to be CDDA with probability 99.73%""

,slipknot342,2012-11-11T03:57Z,"@ s0bersky, Well that's a good thing that you've never uploaded a shit. Not many people would want to see a video of you taking a shit lol."
,SquareEggs,2012-11-12T03:53Z,"@slipknot342
You'd be surprised. I'm sure there are plenty of freaks out there who would love to see it. (and have probably already previously downloaded vids of similar acts). lol


@s0bersky
