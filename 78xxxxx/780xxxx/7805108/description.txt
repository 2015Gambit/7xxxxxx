My Bloody Valentine [2012 Remasters]


My Bloody Valentine have announced details of the release of a trio of re-issues on Monday May 14th 2012 through Sony Commercial Music Group.

They will release their 2 full-length studio albums, IsnΓÇÖt Anything and Loveless, plus EPΓÇÖs 1988-1991, a brand new compilation which draws together their 4 EP releases, Feed Me With Your Kiss, You Made Me Realise, Glider and Tremolo alongside 7 additional rare and previously un-released tracks.

The original studio albums have been painstakingly re-mastered by Kevin Shields at Metropolis Studios in London and Loveless comes as a 2-disc set featuring a previous re-mastering from original analogue tapes, completed by Kevin Shields but never released.

Alongside their EPs, the compilation album features a mixture of rare and unavailable and previously unreleased tracks.

My Bloody Valentine remain one of the most unique and thrilling bands of the last 25 years. Sonic pioneers, they stood alone in the late 80s / early 90s, their two albums sounded like nothing that had gone before. Loveless in particular was a breathtaking piece of work exploring the outer reaches of a guitarΓÇÖs capabilities ΓÇô itΓÇÖs no surprise that 20 years later the album is still influencing a new generation of musicians from The Horrors to Radiohead.

IsnΓÇÖt Anything, released on Creation Records in November 1988, was My Bloody ValentineΓÇÖs debut long-player. Formed in Dublin in 1983, prior to IsnΓÇÖt Anything they had released a number of EPs and mini-albums. The album was preceded by You Made Me Realise, an EP which gave some indication of the avant-garde musical direction of the album, which, on release, was heralded as peerless.

IsnΓÇÖt Anything was Recorded in Wales over a two-week period in the late spring of 1988 and produced by the band and following some personnel changes it featured the line-up of Kevin Shields (guitar, vocals), Bilinda Butcher (guitars / vocals), Colm O Coisoig (drums) and Debbie Googe (bass) which would go on to record and release Loveless 3 years later.

Their second album, Loveless, was released in November 1991. Recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991, the albumΓÇÖs gestation was long and complex with numerous studios and engineers used, yet on its eventual release it was soon apparent My Bloody Valentine had released a hugely innovative, original and definitive album, the legacy of which still resonates today.
