,train_wreq,2012-11-09T10:14Z,wrong episode!!! this is from season 5
,meh72,2012-11-09T10:15Z,"Guys, this doesn't look right. The file is called The.Big.Bang.Theory.S06E07.480p.XviD.AC3-playTV.avi, so apparently no MP3 audio, and as you can see, its total size (217 MB) doesn't match the declared (and much more usual in avi realeases) size of 177 MB. So I'm downloading it but not putting too much faith in it."
,meh72,2012-11-09T10:43Z,"No it isn't, train_wreq. Its vanity card is #398, so it's the right episode, but as I said, it doesn't have MP3 audio. GSpot output:

0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3
48000Hz  384 kb/s tot , 6 chnls (3/2 .1)

And the video track is slightly smaller than usual although the frame size is higher (720x400 instead of 640x352).

So thanks for the upload but, why oh why...?"

,manlymatt,2012-11-14T17:22Z,"it's the right episode, and the video is fine, but the sound volume is very very low -- for everything but the opening song and the laugh track."
,jeff.wright-,2012-11-15T21:20Z,"Wrong file. Wrong size. Not HDTV. Audio is not mp3. Wrong resolution. But, well... it's playable.

For those of you who want the ACTUAL HDTV release (from AFG, 178MB, mp3 audio, 640x360, etc), here it is:
