,nawnwa,2012-11-09T21:54Z,"dnt dload it guys,,, death by hearing the voice acting!!"
,ntongh2o,2012-11-10T07:18Z,"This is truely an indie game. The voice acting is bad. There are absolutely no options at all. No tutorial to tell you the controls. Enter is the action key btw. No health bar, no ammo count, no flashlight? Download only if you're extremely bored and have no other games to play."
,mibmib007,2012-11-10T09:02Z,everx7  there is not crack have downloaded it and uninstalled it allready and no crack dir =)

,Dranken432,2012-11-21T16:26Z,you shouldnt take the game serious the developer wanted it so what you can see in the game manual when you buy it
