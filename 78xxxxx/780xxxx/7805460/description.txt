Lotus [Deluxe Edition] (2012)





After a stint judging the U.S. TV talent show The Voice, the hugely popular diva returns to making music of her own with this seventh studio album, the follow-up to 2010's Bionic. Having divorced in 2010, she viewed this album as a chance for a kind of rebirth, and kept her horizons wide open, refusing to be tied to any one genre. The material within encompasses dance-pop, piano ballads, and R&B, and features collaborations with her fellow Voice judges Cee-Lo Green and Blake Shelton, as well as the racy single "Your Body."
