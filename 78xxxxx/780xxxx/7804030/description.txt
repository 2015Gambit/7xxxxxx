Notes: The Screener source for this one was a 4x3 letterboxed source with an
extremely low bitrate on both video & audio, hence the 700 MB file size, slightly
smaller than normal res and the 128 kbps ac3 2 channel audio. Quality is still
pretty decent for what it is, no screener watermakarks/b&w scenes etc. that we
noticed from scanning through. Take it or leave it, or reencode it On another
note, have heard some pretty good things about this one. The film has been playing
at festivals and has been getting a lot of praise, enjoy!
