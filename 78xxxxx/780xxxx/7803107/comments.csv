,4nt1trt,2012-11-09T22:49Z,"@Markosargo The problem is not on your system, the game is not cracked"
,ncthalia,2012-11-10T01:21Z,@Markosargo I think the problem is your's are windows ...not mac...this torrent i think is support mac not windows...
,DarkKnight123,2012-11-10T15:26Z,Works great but how do you change the name from EMPTY to something else?
,Markosargo,2012-11-10T16:12Z,"I think that 4nt1trt has right.It's not problem on my system,just game is not cracked yet.I heard that game only works on Windows Xp 32bit or 64bit.Just we have to wait that somebody makes win764&32bit patch for this game.

P.S. Counter Strike:Source works perfect on my system,and15 more games,including CoD1,Cod4MW,CoD6MW2,CoD8MW3"

Mac System Requirements

MacOS X 10.6.6 or higher
Processor: Intel Core Duo Processor (2GHz or better)


So,this version is for MAC  not for Windows"
,ihazlulz,2012-11-13T03:22Z,Game launches as normal in windowed mode but then it just CTDs immediately after this... I'm running Mac OSX Lion 10.7.4 and all of my specs are higher than what jaymcmelt lists in his description...
,Markosargo,2012-11-14T21:03Z,"OK.Sorry,i didn't see that the game is for mac.I've first read comments."
