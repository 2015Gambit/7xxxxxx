HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems main health sensors : voltages, temperatures, fans speed. The program handles the most common sensor chips, like ITE┬« IT87 series, most Winbond┬« ICs, and others. In addition, it can read modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature.


Features:

Remote Monitoring
Watch the sensors of one or several distant PCs through a simple TCP/IP connection.

Graph Generator
Save monitoring data and generate logging graphs as bitmap files.

Improved Interface
Sensors in system tray, editable sensors labels ...

PWM Control
Fan PWM control (for ESA compliant devices).


Changes
Fixed package temperature on AMD FX (Zambezi and Vishera).
Report real-time power on AMD FX (Zambezi and Vishera).
Support complete telemetry on AMD APU (Trinity).
Fixed package power on multi-CPU Intel platforms.
Added support of Nuvoton NCT7904D chip.
Added option "Minimize to tray".
Support for Antec CC watercoolers. That support is preliminary, it requires the use of the 32-bit version of HWMonitorPRO, and requires that the ChilControl application does NOT run in the same time.

Install:

- run application
- use keygen
