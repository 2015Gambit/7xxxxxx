,w213,2012-11-15T07:18Z,This is fantastic!!!!  Works perfectly!!!!  Would definitely love to see the rest of the classic Tomb Raiders as well as the rest of the Silent Hill series (your torrent of that works great too).  I look forward to downloading more torrents from you!
,deuz,2012-11-15T20:28Z,"Thanks for comment and suggestion, Soon I will port The complete Tomb Raider Games to mac and of course the silent Hill Saga."
,punksterhd,2012-11-19T12:10Z,"How do you port games to Mac? I'm a Mac hardware repair tech.

If you need any help, let me know, I have a bunch of Mac over here. 

I know wrappers and stuff are used to run some dll and the directx engine..

Trow me some links or email me at punkbusting@live.com

Great day ;)"
