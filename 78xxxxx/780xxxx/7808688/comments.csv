,harry_h13,2012-11-09T22:07Z,"Really need help! Whenever I'm trying to download any torrent, I constantly get the error message that 'The System Cannot Find the Path Specified'. This is something new I am encountering and unable to fix it. I tried changing the location of my downloads but that doesnt help either. Any help on this is GREATLY APPRECIATED."
,LishenG,2012-11-09T22:23Z,"@harry_h13 I had the same problem once, try deleting the torrent file from your client (eg from utorrent) exit utorrent completely, start it up again, redownload the torrent, after the magnet link retrieves the torrent data, stop the torrent, restart it and click recheck/ force reckeck, I did that and mine worked."
