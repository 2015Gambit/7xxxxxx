This looks perfect. Now I'll relive my youth, when I first started reading comics on the reg, and even better I get all the crossovers I missed. Thanks also to whoever requested this one.

How could this be improved? Only if everything had ads/text pages/etc. And including the Legend of Wonder Woman mini, plus the Animal Man follow up to crisis, this is almost fanatically complete, although throwing in a copy of ""The Last Days of the Justice Society"" special would really round it out.

A thousand thanks."

and, in an effort to round things out, i give you this:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7814522/The_Last_Days_Of_The_Justice_Society_Of_America"

Thanks for the work these take."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-13T13:58Z,"@ emperios:  just use Comic Book Reader, available here:  http://www.cbrreader.com/

Orrrrr, CDDisplay, available here:  http://www.cdisplayex.com/

Orrrrrr, unzip the files (using WinZip  http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm  , or 7-Zip  http://www.7-zip.org/download.html  (Hint: 7-Zip is Free!)) and use Windows Photo Viewer, etc.

Sorry I am unfamiliar with ComicFlow."
,emperios,2012-11-13T14:43Z,"Thanks, @SplhcbPrime, but I'm on a Mac and an ipad and those are Windows programs.

ComicFlow is a great free app on the app store that let's you view cbr, cbz, zip, and pdf files without having to do any conversions.  Just load it up and read.  :)"
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-14T23:51Z,"sounds like a mac problem to me, emperios; if u unzip the issues into their individual files, can u view them then?"
