Ultimate Performance Boost
Disk Defrag Pro increases file access speed, meaning that just about everything on your PC will work faster.

Smart Defrag Algorithms
Thanks to 4 different algorithms for intelligent file placement, your hard drive will always run at its top speed.

Boot-time Defrag
Now you can defrag every single file, including crucial system files that are normally locked by Windows.

Fragmentation Prevention
Disk Defrag Pro not only defrags, but also can prevent further fragmentation by leaving free space after specified files.

Disk Cleanup And Checkup
For faster and safer defragmentation, you can set the program to remove temp files and check disks for errors.

Performance Charts
Speed improvements and disks' state can now be easily tracked through detailed reports and performance charts.
