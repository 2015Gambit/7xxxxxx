Obama: What Happened to Hope

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Andrew Marr, published by BBC broadcasted as part of BBC This World series in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Andrew Marr looks back at Barack Obama's first term in office.

When Obama stood before a crowd of nearly two million people, preparing to take the oath of office, it was a moment that many never believed they would see: the inauguration of a black American president. Now, through informal and candid interviews with some of Obama's own White House staff and those who have worked closely with him, Andrew Marr assesses how far this presidency has lived up to the huge expectations.

Administration insiders like Austan Goolsbee, the economics professor who advised Obama through the worst economic crisis since the great depression, and Former Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs PJ Crowley recount the stories behind the moments that have defined a tumultuous presidency, revealing how this extraordinary orator who entered the White House with a flourish of bold idealism and grand promises to change the ways of Washington has ultimately been replaced by a very different man.
