,zandbak,2012-11-09T07:47Z,"The most important in the release infos is the format ! You not say to know if this vid is an AVI, MP4, MKV, FLV or others ! Why not to mention it? It would be exxtremely usefull to kown it before to download a vid impossible to play on a home DVD's. Thank you to think about it !"
,Ingz.86,2012-11-09T08:32Z,"Lol, up there beneath ""Type"", above ""Size"", There is something called ""Files"". In front of that is the number 2. Click that number and you'll see what format it is."
,frkzoid,2012-11-09T10:20Z,The torrent info tells you what file type it is. Just need to work a little harder for your free files.
