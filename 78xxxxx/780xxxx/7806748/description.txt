Doctor Who: The Whispering Gallery (February 2009)
In this special one-shot, superstar artist Ben Templesmith tackles his first full Doctor Who project, alongside writers Moore & Reppion. In 'The Whispering Gallery,' the TARDIS lands in a maze-like gallery filled with thousands of talking pictures, and the Doctor and Martha discover they've come across a planet where showing emotion has been outlawed. The inhabitants have good reason for their supression, but it wouldn't be like the Doctor to leave them in fear of truly living.

Doctor Who: Autopia (June 2009)
An All-American creative team tackles the celebrated Doctor in this special standalone tale.

But things aren't quite what they seem...

Doctor Who: Room With A Deja View (July 2009)

Writer Rich Johnston (Whatmensch) and artist Eric J (Rex Mundi) bring you this mind-twisting tale.

Doctor Who: Cold-Blooded War (August 2009)
