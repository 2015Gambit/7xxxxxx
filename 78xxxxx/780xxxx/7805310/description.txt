CPUID HWMonitor Pro is our extended version of the hardware monitoring program HWMonitor. In comparison to its classic counterpart, HWMonitor Pro adds the following features : Remote Monitoring - Watch the sensors of one or several distant PCs through a simple TCP/IP connection. Graph Generator - Save monitoring data and generate logging graphs as bitmap files. Improved Interface - Sensors in system tray, editable sensors labels ... PWM Control - Fan PWM control (for ESA compliant devices).
