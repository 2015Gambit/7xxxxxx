,Malakore,2012-11-09T14:43Z,"Thank you EZTV, thank you LOL.

Also, about that later release thing. Just one word - patience.
Watching TBBT isn't something you have to do asap. Speaking of which, I really don't understand people watching CAMs and similar crap just because they are impatient, I always thought those releases are only good for translators to prepare subtitles for DVD/BR... But hey, patience comes with age right? That's why we say ""impatient like a little kid"".
But now went off-topic, sorry and enjoy the show.

,rodsvin,2012-11-09T14:59Z,THANKS !!! :D Cheers from brazil ! :D
,FrozenApe,2012-11-09T16:05Z,Thanks for the up but this show is made for complete idiots with IQ's of 75 and below. Besides it's programmed to turn you gay and a loser with dominant women running your life. Other than that there's a couple laughs here and there about Stephen Hawking. 
,hoping4more,2012-11-09T16:15Z,Thanks!
