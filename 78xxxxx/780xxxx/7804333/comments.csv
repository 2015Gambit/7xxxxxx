,.Leto.,2012-11-09T20:38Z,"LOL, +17 in quality even though there's a serious problem with the Sparks release. An when you look at all the other DownHD releases you can see that they also have +10, +8. That uploader with a skull really seems desperate :D"
,slapnutz,2012-11-10T12:01Z,Do not download. Definitely has a looping issue about 3 different times in the movie. Skips ahead then back. The last one actually skips back then ahead for some reason.
