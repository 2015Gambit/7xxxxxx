,Alpha.Omega,2012-11-10T01:13Z,"No problem, working smooth, but the game itself SUCKS!!!, not worth playing>> my personal assessment only, i do not know if others will like the game."
,PseudoPositive,2012-11-10T03:23Z,"Well it works, thanks azaq318. It has some issues though, I had to use Xpadder to map keyboard & mouse to my gamepad since there's no controller support, but after that controls were perfect. I wouldn't take the game too seriously though, it even has the theme music to MacGyver when you get the ""Tinker"" Achievement, ha. I would give it a 2 out of 5 stars, it's the kind of game you play when you've played all of your other games; +1 though."
,ntongh2o,2012-11-10T07:18Z,"This is truely an indie game. The voice acting is bad. There are absolutely no options at all. No tutorial to tell you the controls. Enter is the action key btw. No health bar, no ammo count, no flashlight? Download only if you're extremely bored and have no other games to play."
[T],Knaster,2012-11-10T10:15Z,ntongh2o  thats the whole point of the game you cant see a hud with ammo  in real life either do you? Nab
