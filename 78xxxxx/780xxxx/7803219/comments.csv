The downside of creating smaller pdf's can be a compromise on quality.  Acrobat Distiller in my opinion has its good points, yet the outcome of the converted file doesn't always guarantee a high quality output.   It's a trial and eror thing."

Infact I smaller size file opens into the window full size, I like the smaller file better, all ready getting a few in epub format soon all will be.
Thanks"
