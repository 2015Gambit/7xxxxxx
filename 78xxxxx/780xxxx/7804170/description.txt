I just found this recording on a good pal's site. And boy is it a find. And the most remarkable thing, personally, is that this show apparently took place on November 9, 1973, two days before I was born. Thanks for the welcome, Townes.

I found these files on the site above and I must say this is an awesome and very rare (no torrents exist for it, that I can find).  Enjoy!
