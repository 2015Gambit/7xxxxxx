New York Times best-selling, award-winning creator Bill Willingham turns the spotlight on the female FABLES--spinning secret histories of Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Cinderella, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, Snow White, Rose Red and others. They may be beautiful, but there will be blood.

We look back to Rapunzel's first fateful steps as she's shipwrecked on the shores of the Hidden Kingdom. She's charmed by the Celestial Court, but there is political intrigue afoot and a forbidden love affair when Rapunzel falls in love with a kitsune fox spirit.
