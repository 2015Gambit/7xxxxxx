I've been playing this version for a long time now, since the very day the game came out and I only got 1 error this whole time. Try it out.
And don't forget that usually is not the rip that causes the problem but mostly the way and quality of your burns. If you have an IHAS drive patched with burnerMAX be sure to use Verbatim (made in Singapore), but I guess you know all that already if you've been burning games for a while. Good luck."
