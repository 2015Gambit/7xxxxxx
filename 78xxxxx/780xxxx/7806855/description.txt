Goofs
Errors in geography: When George Needleman (Eugene Levy) goes to his Manhattan office building and enters the elevator to go up to his office, the elevator inspection certificate is visible. It is issued by the Georgia Department of Labor, meaning that the elevator used for the shot was not located in Manhattan, but rather in Georgia. See more ┬╗
