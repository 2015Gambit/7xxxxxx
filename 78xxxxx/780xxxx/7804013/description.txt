Roger Corman said in 1988 that THE INTRUDER is the only film he ever made that failed to turn a profit.  Of course, it's one of his best.  William Shatner tears it up as a white supremacist who visits a small southern town and incites a riot over the recent racial integration of the town's public schools.  Very much of its time, and well worth seeing.  Filmed in a Missouri town where the locals were kept in the dark about the film's actual "perspective" on the integration issue.  Re-released over the years under various titles including "I Hate Your Guts."
