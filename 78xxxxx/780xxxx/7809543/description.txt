I didn't create this torrent and only sharing it with the TPB community.

This is what I did and it's working fine on my Windows 7 64bit:

1. Install the plugin Perfect_Photo_Suite_7.exe (I chose only version CS6 x64, 32-bit without photoshop)

2. Run the patch PerfectPhotoSuite7_PatchX64.exe. You must manually select three folders where files are required. They're in a directory with the plugin. 

3. Run the license manager.exe in the directory with the plugin, copy the id into the keygen, generate a key, copy into the license manager.
Before that I had to first uninstall version 6.

This is the virustotal report for the patch:

And this for the Keygen:

If you don't trust these files then run in sandbox first...


This is all the help I can provide.

Enjoy!
