Everyone who has a freezer finds something unlabelled, unrecognisable and out of date every time they defrost! What they need is a practical management plan to control this waste. Here it is! It includes everything they need to know in one handy volume. There's food preparation and packaging, storage times, freezing made-up dishes, cooking from frozen, defrosting, freezer-to-microwave cookery, hygiene, and food safety. Plus that fail-safe system to prevent you finding UFOs (unidentified frozen objects)!
