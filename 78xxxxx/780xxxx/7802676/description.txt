"The North Star" is a ship meant to go on a journey for two months. On board we find its crew, a teacher, a scientist and a bunch of students about to start an adventure they would never thought of.

Julia Wilson (Irene Montal√†) is a scientist working with the people in charge of the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva. Something goes terribly wrong and a black hole will make the continents disappear under the water. They all survive the storm and the side effects of the particle accelerator and now the only solid surface they can step on, it's their ship. Nevertheless they are not safe, and more problems come across as they go on with their journey which is now finding a piece of land that is still standing.
