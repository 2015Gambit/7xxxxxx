,XilE-,2012-11-08T05:07Z,"I love South Park so much I disable my ad blocker on their website! Well the same for TPB however there are so many I use a convenient script to still hide them even though they're loading.

They're getting paid still and I keep a squeaky clean screen lol. It's called having your cake and eating it."
,epicfrog,2012-11-08T05:29Z,"XilE, nobody cares. thanks eztv."
,ksoul,2012-11-08T05:30Z,I thought they only get paid when people actually click on the ad.
,stijr,2012-11-08T09:33Z,thank you!
,LuHv,2012-11-08T09:56Z,thanks
,oikjgbvguiugfc,2012-11-08T11:37Z,"hahaha ""nobody cares"". I love TPB. 

Thanks for the upload, good episode."
,arildus,2012-11-08T14:55Z,Thanx:)
,itool,2012-11-08T16:46Z,"Fuck epicfrog! Do you have any USEFUL input, like a comment on the upload? Or are you just an asshole?"
,ytnewtruof,2012-11-08T21:30Z,does anyone else think this comment thread is hilarious? i laughed for 10min without even watching the show
,jacobleb420,2012-11-08T23:40Z,The nobody cares commemt made me lol! 
,nobodynever,2012-11-09T01:02Z,"Can I be both?  Someone with something to say about the upload AND be an asshole?  Cause I'd prefer both if that's doable.

There's no point in reviewing the A/V quality of the ul.  Have you ever got anything from eztv that WASN'T legit?

I think this episode was really dry.  And I LOOOVVEEE Southpark. Anyone know if this is the finale?  Hope not, kind of a dud."
,SrMLove,2012-11-09T01:23Z,"@itool: hey you are a tool and a douche... was that ""useful"" enough for you.... and no body cares about you either.... you can input that wherever you may like.... "
,SrMLove,2012-11-09T01:28Z,"and more importantly..... thank you Ez... 

see ""itool""... that's called saying thank you before we even being to d/l the torrent... i have a feeling no one likes you very much so go be a dick somewhere else... or just shut the fuck up..... b/c you didn't post anything helpful towards the torrent... you only helped prove and make aware to everyone what a jackass you are.... "
,epicfrog,2012-11-09T09:05Z,"nobodynever, it was the finale. they've been doing 14 episodes per season for awhile. I agree it was a bit of a dud. hope that wasn't TOO useful of a comment. "
,erazerjinxed,2012-11-09T12:51Z,cheers champ
,sami_nasri,2012-11-09T13:43Z,"See,The problem with Itool is he did the same thing he criticized,which is kinda weird because this means....FUCK itool
Yeah Anyway awesome as always eztv 
A10 V10"
,Viktor6665,2012-11-09T14:56Z,"Thanks!
Btw this was the most complicated and interesting episode in the history if SP."
,avaadorey,2012-11-10T23:49Z,"That episode was Okay, 10/10 V&A. I'm just still trying to figure out how they knew Obama won before he won, unless they had 2 different episodes set to air, but I strongly doubt that's the case. They may have had insider information."
,CockForYourMom,2012-11-15T02:38Z,"itool.... I need you to shut your AIDS cock full mouth.  If you don't, your mom's vagina will be filled to the outer labia with my baby batter.  "
