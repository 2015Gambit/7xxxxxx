,gazkammre,2012-11-08T18:06Z,Don't download! This one is nuked. Get the proper one from DAA. 
,.Leto.,2012-11-09T20:40Z,"It's true, don't download this, the Sparks release got nuked, ""The release from SPARKS contains some looping scenes and or glitches. Shortly after 01:11:43 for example they are at a completely different location and the sentence cuts off midway"". And don't believe those +10 in quality, the uploader is the one who's doing that. Quite pathetic..."
