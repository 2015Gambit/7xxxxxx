,RTT2,2012-11-11T12:44Z,"And there it was. The sum total of right-wing humour.  A technically laboured pun, jarringly unrealistic and political. 

It's always good fun when a right-wing pundit (and this has included people who should have known better) tries to write a column about how the best comedy is right-wing. This is usually one of a series of 'best of' articles blatantly designed to attract naive young arrogants, who fancy being on the winning side without having to think or read much.

The comedy articles backfire hilariously though, as people who really know comedy completely and easily refute them. And are actually funny. 

'Strong' right-wingers seem obsessed with claiming comedy, because, like a monkey at a urinal, they can see it's a useful tool, but don't know how to use it. Infuriating no doubt, but funny all the same. Unless it's 'the half-hour comedy hour', of course. 

The reason comedy will never be a tool for extreme political hacks (both right and left), of course, is that comedy is, and always will be, about what they are not: the truth."
