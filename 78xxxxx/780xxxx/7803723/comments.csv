,numse,2012-11-09T10:36Z,"hey lets all spam hindi movies on this scandinavian site to get our ratings up!!


extremezone!! biggest loser online!"
,koltbolt,2012-11-09T12:33Z,"If you want to watch this movie, then who am I to argue. You deserve to watch it. 

Although deep down I almost wish I was 10 again thinking everything was great. 

Just a note: The poster says ""One step can change your world."" Warning kids this is especially true right next to a portal to an alternate universe or on the lip a very high cliff.

Please learn from my experience! Thankyou :)"

,Zerox998,2012-11-18T19:45Z,"I actually love all the dance movies, but i felt this was written for a musical not a movie in every way.

Dancing top notch, story was way to small even smaller then the first stepup movie which says a lot :)

I think if they did this one 100% for musical it would fit like a glove.

,dsmith7681,2012-11-19T02:31Z,"thabks, fast download"
,Jonathan55555,2012-11-20T20:58Z,"Good film but it's a little cheesy, if you're mature as I am this movie will make you cringe"
,mrfactsright,2012-11-22T18:02Z,FILM FOR FAR GONE YANKS
,darkesio,2012-11-25T07:26Z,"Okay to all you simple minded, slow, small brained knuckle draggers. This movie sales more copies each day and makes more money in one day then you fucking make working a $20 an hour job at 40 hours a week and 365 days a year in which most people don't work half that. Until you can make the same amount of money or more than the people selling this movie, shut up sit down fuck off and either watch it or don't but don't run you damn mouth about it because you did not make it...."
,vampzcore,2012-11-27T11:26Z,thanks!!
