Huxley returns to one of his traditional homes, the ever quality house imprint Tsuba, this autumn with two brand new cuts and two reworks from house music royalty, MK.

2012 has seen HuxleyΓÇÖs stock seriously rise with standout releases and remixes sitting comfortably alongside an impeccable gig schedule and many a press plaudit. Despite this surge in attention, the British producerΓÇÖs music remains how itΓÇÖs always been, with a firm focus on beat driven house music that touches on elements
of Garage, UK Garage and beyond.

ΓÇÿNo Matter WhatΓÇÖ sees Huxley delve deep with a robust yet light in tone house cut riddled with playful melodies and a hooky vocal refrain that is gently teased throughout. Heady and punchy at the same time, ΓÇÿNo Matter WhatΓÇÖ is followed with a similarly impressive cut in ΓÇÿCanΓÇÖt SleepΓÇÖ. Centred around warm yet dominating chords that leap from the earthy beats/bass bedding, ΓÇÿCanΓÇÖt SleepΓÇÖ is yet another Huxley bomb.

MK delivers two mixes of ΓÇÿNo Matter WhatΓÇÖ, with his ΓÇÿmixΓÇÖ version proving infectious from the off with some nimble vocal edits and FM bass licks unravelling towards powerful mid-section drop that switches the bottom end rhythms up nicely.
The MK Dub is last but by no means least, with the veteran producer chopping the vocals up even more and pairing them with light key stabs and wandering bass notes in his much-copied but never-bettered style. Here the drops are limited to nagging vocal edits, serving only to emphasis the kicks even more.

Tsuba never misses the mark and this 12ΓÇ¥ is another winner, and one that sees two producers in their element.
