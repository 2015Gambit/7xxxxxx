,deuz,2012-11-10T00:55Z,"Ahhh you want to edit save game files to cheat.
Ok, first you need to right click the App> then show package content (or something like this)> the you will see the folder ""C"" (like Pc Version) and then browse to the save game files (i don´t know where is it) but i hope you can find it."
,deuz,2012-11-10T00:57Z,"By the way, I´m working on porting Pc Games to Mac so you can tell me which games you want and i will try to port."
,Sp4rt4nKai,2012-11-10T13:16Z,The port is good but I've experienced crashes and an inability to load saves. 
,deuz,2012-11-10T17:23Z,Let me check the load game but I´ve been testing and works fine.
,chrede2750,2012-11-11T15:19Z,"Damn: D I've found it .. thank you!
it is in the folder C Drive and then under User and you'll find it in one of the 3 folders :)!
total nice .. but could not open the old save files .. so I download it from YOUTUBE . there is a video show how to do.. and then i put it into the save folder: D now i have 1million dollar: D

,deuz,2012-11-11T18:18Z,"I think there's no architect 2 right now but, there's only the Alpha 3 witch is the version 3.0 of the same game, by the way are you having problems with load and save games too???"
,chrede2750,2012-11-11T18:54Z,"now i understand. :) so the "" new "" one is just or update or somting. :)! cool

,deuz,2012-11-12T18:08Z,ok thanks for info and enjoy the game. :)
,RADIUS_0,2012-11-17T02:15Z,Scanned with ClamXav and found a Trojan. Care to explain?
,deuz,2012-11-17T16:05Z,"I port this game to play in Mac, I download this game from internet and port with wineskin so if there's a trojan should be for Windows not for Mac."
,Sp4rt4nKai,2012-11-20T10:46Z,"Trojans do not affect Mac, they are Windows viruses."
,deuz,2012-11-21T02:35Z,"Sorry guys, I don't have a virus scanner on my mac so I don't realize there is a trojan on the files but there's no way to worried about it not even on Windows because the App is isolated and there's unaviable Windows."
,RADIUS_0,2012-11-21T03:57Z,"Cool, cool. I figured as much. Not trying to sound like a prick... just curious. Thanks for the upload!"
,RADIUS_0,2012-11-21T03:57Z,deuz - ClamXav is free and pretty decent. http://www.clamxav.com
