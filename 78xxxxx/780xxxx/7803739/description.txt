"Arrested"

Phil and Claire get the dreaded late night 
call that Haley has been arrested for under-
aged drinking, so they bring Mitchell, the 
family lawyer, in tow to the police station. 
Cameron stays back to watch over Alex and 
Luke, but they get into some crazy mishaps 
under his care. Meanwhile, Jay gets out of 
baby shopping with Gloria, but ends up 
having to deal with a surprise visit from 
Dede, and tries to scoot her out before 
Gloria gets home to prevent Dede from seeing 
that she's pregnant and to avoid the 
potential blowback.
