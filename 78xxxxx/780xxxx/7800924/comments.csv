,fregim,2012-11-07T16:29Z,"this is working. i had the same problems as you guys. the problem is that you are unzipping the folder 'football manager 2013 editor', and you have to unzip the files in it. so:
1) create a folder in SEGA with the name 'Football Manager 2013 Editor';
2) open the .rar file that you've downloaded, open the 'football manager 2013 editor' in it, select all the files and unzip them to the folder you created in 1).
This worked for me, I hope I helped you."
,pirconan,2012-11-07T16:54Z,"Ok after 2 hours of experimenting it finally working!!! fuckin lazy skidrow and fuckin sega-y

First you have to unpack files into EDITOR folder, for example d:FM13editor

then edit special folder.xml (located there) replacing every  line '..football manager 2013 data' with your game location (for example 'd:fm13data'

finally start the game, go to preferances and disable/untick cache option there.

that's it."

,4_touchdowns,2012-11-07T18:08Z,"@ pirconan

I don't use the editor, but I unticked the cache option in preferences - interface (the only cache option I found), and still get crashes. The xml files are created with the editor, isn't this so? "
,pirconan,2012-11-07T18:37Z,"@st.Lucifer
open 'special folders.xml' (in editor folder) with notepad and replace every line ""..football manager 13/data"" with -your game location- for example ""d:/FM13/data"" there are 7 of them i think.. btw maybe it could work even if you don't do that but you have to untick cache in preferances and make editor folder

@4_touchdowns yea that xml file is from editor but it doesn't change anything- game /bad crack? is very unstable atm"

[V],DeGun,2012-11-07T21:49Z,"@ CreepySpook.

well done , i tried using the edior and succeed .

Yes game will still crash as long as a fix hasnt come out.

What i ve done to make it work is basicly what said PIRCONAN which was :

Create a folder named EDITOR (easy to find) on desktop.
Extract the rar ""football manager 2013 editor"" to that folder 
Rename the extracted folder FROM Football Manager 2013 Editor TO fm13 editor 

My fm2013 is there:
D:/GAMES/SEGA/Football Manager 2013/fm13.exe SO i ve put the fm13 editor folder just into my SEGA folder which contains as well the game in another folder, the football manager 2013 one.

so i did copy/paste my fm13 editor folder in that SEGA folder, near fm13 but NOT inside.
then i went into sega/fm13 editor folder, right click onto the ""special folders"" and click on MODIFY .

then EVERYWHERE you see ../Football Manager 2013/data change it (7 times you see it seven times you change it) to you DATA FOLDER ADDRESS which is THE DATA ONE FROM YOUR FOOTABLL MANGER 2013 Games.

for instance mine was, remember : D:/GAMES/SEGA/Football manager then add as well /data so = D:/GAMES/SEGA/data

IMPORTANT : watch out for the right ------> / "
[V],DeGun,2012-11-07T21:52Z,"some of my comments went missing... lol too much :)

so change the  to / and paste your data folder (from the game folder) address ina modified special folders from the fm13 editor (the one extracted !) then close, uncheck cache in fm 13 preferences and run editor  , load it and . change it."

[V],DeGun,2012-11-08T13:04Z,"for me it worked... spent 4h last night adding and changing team/players etc.

so extract into one sega/fm13 editor folder .

put it near by (but not inside) the game you instaled.
go into that editor folder you ve just extracted - change the special folders (right click/modify) 

add the address of your REAL data folder from where your game is and so REPLACE the ../data (there is 7 to replace) ... mine was D:/pc games/sega/football manager 2013/data/ BUT MAKE SURE you change the ""slash"" to / THAT / one it appears ina special folders as  that  .

save /close the special folders . start fm13 as normal . go to preferences down left ... then third tab on top INTERFACE then uncheck the line where you see CACHE ... , close FM13 .

Go into your editor folder, start it and ... enjoy .
