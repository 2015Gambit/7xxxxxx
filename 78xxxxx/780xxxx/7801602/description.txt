General
Adjusted enemy spawns so that lower tier enemies still spawn at slightly higher kingdom worth or lower depth while higher tier enemies remain the same
Underground enemies can not spawn in mined out cells for 2 days
Underground enemies no longer spawn on cells with a construction - block floors, stairs, workshops, etc
Added hot key to toggle highlighting areas that are dark enough for enemies to spawn in
Crates can now store claymores, battle axes, warhammers, torches, pistols, blunderbusses and crossbows

Music
No longer using XACT
Added 3 new songs
Replaced combat music
Shuffle music on repeat instead of long periods of silence
Loosened music choice conditions to only day/night so that rarely heard songs play more often

Fixed
Crash on load in some cases
Rare crash when animals try to leave and their path is blocked
Pathing issue when start and end positions are both under water
Gnomes getting stuck trying to pick up two handed items
Gnomes only filling a quiver or ammo pouch with 1 ammo


I'm slowly trying out these changes to enemy spawns and will continue to make adjusts based on feedback.  In general, enemies at the copper and bronze levels will spawn in a wider range of Kingdom Worth or depth, while iron and steel level enemies will spawn as before.  A higher minimum worth is required for beetles to spawn and at lower values of Kingdom Worth the number of mants will be lower while remaining the same at higher values.  The toggle for displaying dark areas ignores depth and constructions, meaning some cells will still be highlighted red when turned on but won't actually spawn enemies.
