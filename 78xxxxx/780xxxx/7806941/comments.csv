there really isn't an ""explicit"" version of this album, only 1 song is all that explicit. the song ""shut up"" is bleeped out on all versions of the album. hope that helps"
,treko200,2012-11-10T01:39Z,Thank you very much!
,funke1,2012-11-10T01:51Z,Your Body is explicit...It's actually (F*ck) Your Body...trying to find it for a friend. Thanks though!

you are correct, there is a recorded explicit version of that song, but it was NOT released officially. check itunes and google play music if you don't believe me, the song is not listed as explicit on the ""parental advisory"" version of the album."
,funke1,2012-11-10T03:24Z,Ok thank you!
