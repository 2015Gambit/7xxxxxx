,Azncrook,2012-11-09T14:52Z,"is it me or the video quality is really poor? i mean its a 1080p rip and its grainy, image is not clear, not sharp   :( compared to othes bluray rip, or is it the movie that was filmed like that, was it intended to be cheap image quality for 80's nostalgia?? wtf!"

dont think the film was ment to be like this.
Sound also not the best."
