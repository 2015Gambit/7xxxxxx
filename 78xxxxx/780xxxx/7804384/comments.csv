THANK  YOU SO  MUCH  !!!
I didn't think that I'll be getting them so quickly.

U're  too Good."

Sorry to disturb again, Only wanted to say that if for some movie you do not get a DVDR then a Blu-Ray convert will do.
You knw -  720p.BluRay.x264    OR  1080p.BluRay.x264

If it is reduced to 5GB , I'll convert it to DVD.
All that is required ,
Audio      : English (AC3)
Subtitles  : English    

THANK  YOU  AGAIN  FOR EVERYTHING YOU R  DOING"
