""MOONSHINERS"" tells the story of those who brew their shine - whether in the woods behind their house using camouflaged equipment or legally in their garages for local distribution - and the local authorities who try to keep them honest. The series show what life is like in the Appalachian Mountain region, a close-knit society where survival depends on resourcefulness and endurance. From hunting bear and raccoon to catching frogs and catfish, theirs is a world forgotten by modern conveniences. (Source: The Discovery Channel)
