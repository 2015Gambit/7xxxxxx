,Aaronza,2012-11-08T11:26Z,"thanks mate, any chance you could upload the MTV series 'wake brothers' ? much appreciated. (only some eps have been put up)"
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-08T12:05Z,"maccabajani1995: Thanks mate, yeah that's why I decided, you know what fuck it, no one keeps up with this show and uploads a good quality download every week so I'm going to do it!

Aaronza: I checked it out but honestly the way I have to rip these, it takes way too long and that show isn't really on ""high demand"". If you're really keen on it maybe throw TvTeam or Eztv etc. etc. a request, they might be able to help out?"
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-08T12:06Z,The way I have to rip these off the MTV website*

,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-08T13:55Z,"You're welcome mate, glad you like it 

And yeah sorry mate, had a second look to see if I could actually do it and I can't since it's on the US MTV, region blocked sadly but no worries :)"

,kirsty101,2012-11-09T04:52Z,much appreciated! thanks :)
,Gam3OveR,2012-11-09T06:57Z,"@IKnowWhatImHereFor - using fire fox, download the addon ""Modify Headers"" . For the addon options, you want to choose add. Then for name use ""x-forwarded-for"" then for value use ""70.229.6.59"" which is a random US IP, this will let you view US content on MTV. Thank me later "
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-09T08:59Z,"@Gam3OveR: Yeah I basically do the exact same thing for the MTV UK website, use a software called Expat Shield, does the exact same thing, creates a random IP in the UK, I think I can use it with the US as well but I really have no need, but thanks I'll keep it in mind if I ever have to use it :)"
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-14T02:44Z,"ATT: MTV have changed the way they allow users to watch full episodes on their website in the UK, so sadly I won't be able to upload any more episodes unless someone has a workaround. Basically have to pay to watch full episodes and since I'm not in the UK, that isn't going to work, otherwise I would. So sorry guys, hopefully another source will start uploading, or I've noticed TvTeam are uploading the episodes a week after they air."
