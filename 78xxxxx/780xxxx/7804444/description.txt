Alright guys, I plan to upload the entire season 4 of the UK show Geordie Shore (Unless a better source starts doing it, in that case I'm not going to waste my time).

They will be webrip's from the MTV website, so fairly good video quality (for a webrip anyway) and excellent audio.

I live in Aus so sadly I won't be able to upload them straight after they air considering it airs on television a week later here, so I will upload them a couple of hours after they become available on the MTV website.

If anyone can tell me a rough time of when that will be just comment (I'll check daily for new comments).

Also if anyone has any suggestions in terms of quality or faster uploads, please let me know in the comments as well.

Initially the upload speed will be fairly poor (I live in Aus not much I can do about it) so until it gets a few seeders just be patient.

That's about it guys, so comment on quality to let others know I'm not just talking out of my arse, most annoying thing in the world. Oh and if anyone has a dvdrip of the first three seasons, please upload that shit! No good sources of this show anywhere (Anywhere I've looked anyway).

Thank you and enjoy :)
