I don't have a blueray player and renting / buying the blueray would be pointless so I was wondering if you could be kind enough to upload the deleted scenes / movie with commentary for me? Others like me want this but it's not available. Thanks!"

Commentary you might be able to download from the old torrent:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6778828/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo_2002_1080p_multi_%5Bmkvonly%5D
I won't rip commentaries, extras etc in the future."
