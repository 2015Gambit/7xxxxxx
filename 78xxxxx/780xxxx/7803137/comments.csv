,Jacksn87,2012-11-08T01:53Z,Is this legit? 
,domaug,2012-11-08T02:29Z,"Jacksn87: yes it is completely legit, which is great since there were tons of fakes out there over the last few days.  this is one of the best albums i've ever heard!

(also, no password protection, even better)

do your part and still order the album, though.  Deftones deserve every single penny they make off this album.  i still have mine on pre-order."
,Jacksn87,2012-11-08T03:28Z,"Excellent :) I'll give it a listen. I'm most likely going to order it anyway, love Deftones, consistently fail to let me down."
,Jacksn87,2012-11-08T03:38Z,"Checked it out, amazing album. Their best since Adrenaline. Definitely worth a purchase. And a huge thank you to Evil811 for the upload :)"
,kaoskirby,2012-11-08T15:36Z,Definitely gonna buy this!
,s0bersky,2012-11-08T15:43Z,I think it's always better use -V 0 preset instead of -b 320. Files are visibly smaller and the difference in quality is inaudible.
,packman81,2012-11-08T16:05Z,This is a BAD ASS album! Deftones have definitely grown with their base and created a masterpiece. Great quality upload.
,BrewskiFubar,2012-11-08T16:08Z,AWESOME!!! can't wait until tuesday! :)
,ghostrx,2012-11-08T16:53Z,Thanks!

,plagasx,2012-11-09T07:51Z,"Please guys, support these guys and buy the album when it releases Tues!!! It's an amazing album and with Chi (original Bassist) still in recovery, the Deftones need all the SUPPORT THEY CAN GET!!"
