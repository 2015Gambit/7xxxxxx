Wellfear is a norwegian melodic metal band, this is their first album, Legacy of the fallen. 

From their site "Wellfear is the latest addition to Norway's thriving metal scene, bringing a more melodic perspective while holding on to the aggressiveness that norwegian  metal is known for. Musically they hold the middle ground between the catchy hooks and melodies of Bullet For My Valentine and the brutal aggression of Slipknot."
