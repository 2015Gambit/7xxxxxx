Renegade Press, 1986

Written and Illustrated by Terry Beatty


A Special Message From Baron Munchausen

THE PHONY PAGES is an erroneous chronicle of the graphic story medium - a false history of fabricated funnies - a collection of crackpot cartoons. In short, it lies like a rug. The creator of this maddening mess, Terry Beatty, is obviously a demented madman, unable to discern fantasy from reality. I wouldn't listen to a thing he has to say.
