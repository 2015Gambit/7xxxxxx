However, the render/encoding on this really sucks. 

It is full of some sort of vertical line distortions.

I am going to try another to see if the others were made from different capture crew.

Normally the DIMENSION crew is the top of the mountain, but something went wrong tonight on this one. 

Thanks to DibyaTPB anyone for getting this into the wild."
