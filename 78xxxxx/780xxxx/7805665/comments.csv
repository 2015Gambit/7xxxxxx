,giyanvice,2012-11-08T21:13Z,"What the fuck is wrong with you people.

If you don't like that autoplay shit (i don't like it too) you can easily download a normal copy of ""Deep Freeze Standard 7.51.020.4170"" at:
http://www.faronics.com/en-uk/downloads_en-uk/

OR, if you don't like the above download link than here is another one for you:

@ promodsharma 
You could have done the same thing too.

And i have no idea what this TBP user ""marfdiogo78"" is trying to do here:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7643301/Deep_Freeze_Standard_7.51.020.4170#filelistContainer
It is the same mother fucking torrent made by TBP user ""ThumperTM"". Why the hell is he uploading the same thing which was uploaded by a VIP TBP user, is there no moderator on this site."
,w4r3zh4ck,2012-11-08T21:51Z,hey guy I went to %appdata%LocalTemp and found the autoplay folder at the time it was running and just copied the executable from the Docs folder. 
[V],promodsharma,2012-11-09T01:28Z,"@ 'giyanvice' - I Thank You for your ""Expert Advice"" and education to members of TPB. It's really news to me that these alternate methods exist !
