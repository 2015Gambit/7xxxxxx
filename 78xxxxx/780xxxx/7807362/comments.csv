,zandbak,2012-11-09T16:41Z,"The most important in the release infos is the format ! You not say to us if this vid is an AVI, MP4, MKV, FLV or others ! Why not to mention it? It would be exxxxxtremely usefull to kown it before to download a vid impossible to play on a home DVD's. Thank you to think about it !"
