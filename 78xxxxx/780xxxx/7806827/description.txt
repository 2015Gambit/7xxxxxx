RELEASE NOTES

Transcripted is a mixture of two incredibly addictive and vastly
popular casual gaming styles: the dual-stick shooter and the match
three puzzle game. In Transcripted players take control of the Nano
Probe, a microscopic apparatus used to combat disease. With the aid of
a skill tree that improves ship equipment, health, shields and the Nano
Probe's arsenal of upgradeable weapons, players must successfully
navigate through hordes of deadly pathogens to destroy the disease's
pseudo-DNA as it twines perilously on its endless path to infection.
Along the way players must defeat gigantic boss colonies the pathogen
has evolved with the sole purpose of stopping the Nano Probe from
completing its mission. Difficulty levels of both puzzle and shooting
segments can be adjusted independently to suit every play style,
making Transcripted an amazingly replayable experience.

Features:

Twin stick shooter meets match three puzzles for addictive, tactical
and fast-paced action

Many weapon and ship upgrades allow players almost limitless
customization options for their Nano Probe

Beautifully rendered microscopic environments with animated backgrounds
showing various areas of the body as the infection spreads

Difficulty levels of both puzzle and shooting aspects of the game can
be adjusted independently

25 core campaign missions, and 5 Challenge levels for scoring
competition

Players are rewarded for skill shots and huge combos with experience
points that can then be used to purchase weapon and ship upgrades

Memorable, ambient score
