,SandRunneR,2012-11-11T14:36Z,"Me and my friend both have the same problem... The voice-over is in hungarian, and it can't be changed. I tried using the Launcher, as well as changing it in the SKIDROW.ini. Anyone knows a possible solution?"
,SandRunneR,2012-11-11T14:44Z,"Sorry... I just found out that there are no english voice-over, only hungarian."
,Stefanovics,2012-11-11T17:41Z,"it's a hungarian game, yaaay, but it's too bad that are no other languages in the game"
,Stefanovics,2012-11-12T19:39Z,"anyone who's whining over the voiceover:
IT'S A HUNGARIAN GAME!
There's a english and other languages in the menu, and subtitles for crying out loud!

Show some empathy! 99% of the games voiceovers are ENGLISH! If they didin't choose french or german or spanish in the install.

so now you get a hungarian game with subtitle, is it that bad? We hungarians are getting used to subtitled games, SO STOP WHINING, IT'S A GREAT GAME!"
