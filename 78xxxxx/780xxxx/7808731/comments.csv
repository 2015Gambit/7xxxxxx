,Nightsaberr,2012-11-11T14:33Z,"There seems to be a problem with the game on my end (or maybe it's the game itself?). When I enter the Main Menu all the options are for example:

ID_STATIC_OPTIONS, ID_STATIC_LOAD etc etc...
Same thing happens when I choose New Game ID_TUTORIAL... 

I redownloaded it, reinstalled 3 times, no luck.
Any thoughts? "
