Information
------------------------------

Land of oranges, Valencia is a critical city of importance for Spain. Its strategic location on the Mediterranean attracted Greeks, Romans and Moors ┬û who have all taken turns at its control. During the Roman Empire, Valencia was a supply restocking city for ships, and a major trading hub. Today, with its parks and long beaches, Valencia has no car congestion, just the sea and the perfect climate.
