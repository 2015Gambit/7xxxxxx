Here's the movie that precedes and anticipates Antonioni's golden era (1960-1966), which saw an uninterrupted stream of all-time classic by the italian master. I intend to release them chronologically, starting now, releasing better-than-DVD-looking torrents in very small files.

Which actually makes this a kind of experiment : will people pick it or just assume that such a small torrent has to be of bad quality ?
Just in case I guess I have to insist : this is top quality, and if you can compare with the DVD I think you'll like more what's there (short sample included).

As usual, I stand by my stance not to spoil anything (link to the imdb page just above anyway).
