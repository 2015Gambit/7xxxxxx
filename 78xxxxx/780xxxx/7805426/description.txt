                         Eloquent RUBY - 2010kaiser



ItΓÇÖs easy to write CORRECT Ruby code. But its far harder to gain the fluency needed to write great Ruby code. To do that, you need to go beyond syntax and absorb the RUBY WAY of thinking and problem solving. In Eloquent RUBY, Russ Olsen helps you understand Ruby like true Rubyists doΓÇöso you can leverage its immense, surprising power.
Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the Ah Ha! moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does and how you can take advantage of its unique approach.
Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. Youll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for.
