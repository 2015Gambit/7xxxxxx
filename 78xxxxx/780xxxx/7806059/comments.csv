,simongous,2012-11-08T19:40Z,Is this the game + dlc or the dlc on its own? For a skulled uploader your description sucks.
,tiboka,2012-11-08T20:27Z,"Game +DLC

So no more immortal scorpions and mouse spinning?"
,ski_zx,2012-11-08T20:33Z,Pls Crack only
,Machine4578,2012-11-09T00:17Z,"this release is way screwed IMO... the game itself is build 170182 and the crack is for build 171822.
so the game needs to be updated to build 171822 first and the also the nfo did not mention that the game needs to be extracted to the same folder as the NEOGAME release c:steam.steamapps.common.Serios Sam 3 otherwise YOU WILL get the camera spin!!!!!"
,ermporshe,2012-11-09T01:20Z,Does this work or another crack is needed?
,Machine4578,2012-11-09T06:13Z,i meant to say the game version is build 170136 and the crack is for build 171822!!! and make sure the game is in the right dir. like i already said.
,zoromo27,2012-11-09T18:59Z,game crashes in the episode we're together in dlc
,Pj30,2012-11-10T15:35Z,With what am I suposed to unzip this?
,severni.pol,2012-11-10T16:46Z,"doesnt work, the game wont play... I tried twice to unzip, copy, copy crack, and nothing.. :("
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-10T19:09Z,"The game is working. No need to download the folder called ""bonus"". Camera spinning after 5-6 hours of gameplay... Happens at the bridge with a lot of skeletons and 2 bosses..."
,severni.pol,2012-11-10T19:26Z,so how did you make it to work??
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-10T20:31Z,"SPINNING MOUSE FIX! Tested 100% working.
1.Make new folder called “Steam” (you don’t need STEAM installed!) open it and create folder “steamapps”, open it and create folder “common”. It should look like this:

D:Steamsteamappscommon

2. Now, paste your game folder “Serious Sam 3” to folder “common” Like this:

D:SteamsteamappscommonSerious Sam 3

need to restart level Mouse Fixed Have fun!!!!"
,klord2010,2012-11-11T09:23Z,did anyone experiencing crash after killing khnum? it's bugging me.
,Pj30,2012-11-11T16:15Z,"Weird release... Had to use Hj Split to unpack it... Poor info doc...
anyway, thanks for the effort:D"
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-13T12:47Z,"@klord2010
I'm experiencing crash to desktop at Khnum aswell... Might be a random DRM trigger? Let's see if a fix for this is released..."
,StewyGriffin,2012-11-14T12:23Z,"Yeah, the DLC does not work properly!! It needs a new crack.

Starting in level Together Forever, whenever u kill Khnum the game crashes back to desktop. I used a cheat to go to the next level and all plays well until Khnum is back; you shoot the shit out of him and just as he’s about to die the game crashes. Also the game forever says “enumerating packages” which it shouldn’t and when I start it, it complains that it can’t find a video driver or the driver is too old; such crap as I have the latest driver installed. It plays really well other than what I already mentioned so the driver message is bullshit.

Seems Revolt didn’t test this before releasing; we need a new crack. Come on Skidrow, Razor, Fairlight, Reloaded; please save us!"
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-14T13:10Z,"@StewyGriffin The cracker is ViRUS (SKIDROW), so it's not cracked by REVOLT."
,StewyGriffin,2012-11-14T14:26Z,"@gidiyoruz - Oh, ok then, my mistake, but I wonder what the hell Revolt is doing putting their name on it? I hate fuckers who try and take credit for the work of others.
Sure hope Skidrow will make a crackfix cos really wanna play this."
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-15T20:42Z,"@StewyGriffin
The NFO states that ViRUS cracked it."
,StewyGriffin,2012-11-17T09:51Z,"@gidiyoruz - true, VIRUS is the actual cracker person's name but I am talking about the cracking GROUP. Games always have the crack file named either as ""crack"" or as the cracking group's name, ie. Skidrow, Fairlight, Razor1911, Reloaded, etc. In my copy of this game the crack was in a folder called ""REVOLT"". If the Virus guy is part of Skidrow then the folder should have been named that. Why was it called Revolt? Are they a subgroup of Skiddy or are they some wannabe group trying to bignote themselves off the work of others?
Anyway, doesn't look like we're going to get a crackfix anytime soon, if at all dammit. I know C++ very well but my knowledge of Assembly is very poor so I can't have a go at it myself. Hopefully some1 will take up the cause."
,PoppaChubbie,2012-11-17T14:28Z,"nfo?? you mean the nfo called revolt.nfo ? Thats like me taking a skidrow game, removing skidrow.nfo and uploading it with poppachubbie.nfo ... fuckin disgraceful. either revolt are affiliated with skidrow and have their permission or they are shitstains who basically stole a skidrow release.
look at the top of this page, it says:
Serious Sam 3 BFE Jewel of the Nile-REVOLT
if gidiyoruz is right then this is really a SKIDROW release; revolt have no right to put their name on it"
,gidiyoruz,2012-11-18T17:21Z,"Just got this fixed, now it should work properly. Here is a small guide:
1. Download this release (don't use crack)
2. Download demde's fix at http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_serious_sam_3.shtml
3. Download the file called All_171822.gro and put it in ""Serious Sam 3ContentSeriousSam3"" folder"
,klord2010,2012-11-19T11:01Z,"@gidiyoruz

google keyword to find 'All_171822.gro':
