Serious Sam 3: BFE is a glorious throwback to the golden 
age of first-person shooters where men were men,         
cover was for amateurs and pulling the trigger made      
things go boom. Serving as a prequel to the original     
indie sensation, Serious Sam: The First Encounter,       
Serious Sam 3 takes place during the EarthΓÇÖs final       
struggle against MentalΓÇÖs invading legions of beasts     
and mercenaries. Set against the collapsing temples of   
an ancient civilization and the crumbling cities of 22nd 
century Egypt, Serious Sam 3 is an exhilarating fusion   
of classic twitch shooters and modern gameplay features. 
NO COVER. ALL MAN.                                       
                                                         
JEWEL OF THE NiLE:                                    
                                                        
Serious Sam 3: Jewel of the Nile follows the legendary   
hero to the mysterious Temple of Isis on the Island      
of Philae where a monstrous temple guardian lies in      
wait. Set in the midst of the events in Serious Sam 3:   
BFE,Sam and his team will battle through three new       
campaign missions against the unrelenting hordes of
MentalΓÇÖs forces.
