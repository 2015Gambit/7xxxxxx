This is a collection of ebooks focused on computational neuroscience, but it also
contains all the standard neuroscience textbooks, some neuroanatomy, and a lot of
other possibly interesting books. I have used many of these for self-study, and I
hope they can be useful to you too!

If you have newer editions or suggestions for other books please contact me, and
remember to buy the books you deem worthy.

Also, my upload speed is horrible so be patient and try to keep seeding :)
