Red Sonja #46-70
Publisher:  Dynamite Entertainment
Publication Date:  July 2009 - October 2012

Dynamite Entertainment bought the rights to Sonja from Marvel in the early 2000s and decided to bring back SonjaΓÇÖs classic bikini armor for her new series, which debuted in 2005 and featured the art of Mel Rubi, who has since put his own stamp on the character just as Frank Thorne did in the 1970ΓÇÖs. The series was an immediate hit, becoming DynamiteΓÇÖs best-selling title and firmly returning the character to mainstream popularity.

In addition to her own title (storyline detailed below), Sonja also would star in a number of miniseries, including one alongside Claw the Unconquered. In 2007 Marvel, with the cooperation of Dynamite, welcomed back Red Sonja for a five-issue miniseries in which Sonja and Spider-Man met again in modern-day New York City, in a scenario very similar to their first team up. Sonja again switched bodies with Mary Jane Watson, and she and Spider-Man battled old nemesis Kulan Gath once more. The two succeeded in defeating Gath a second time, despite the latterΓÇÖs recruitment of Spider-Man's arch-foe Venom to his cause.
