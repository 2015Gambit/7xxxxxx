Sir Thomas More, was an English lawyer, author, and statesman. During his lifetime he earned a reputation as a leading humanist scholar. More coined the word "utopia", a name he gave to an ideal, imaginary island nation whose political system he described in a book published in 1516.
This book is all about the fictional country called Utopia. It is a country with an ΓÇÿidealΓÇÖ form of communism, in which everything really does belong to everybody, everyone does the work they want to, and everyone is alright with that. This country uses gold for chamber pots and prison chains, pearls and diamonds for childrenΓÇÖs playthings, and requires that a man and a woman see each other exactly as they are, naked, before getting married. This book gave the word ΓÇÿutopiaΓÇÖ the meaning of a perfect society, while the Greek word actually means ΓÇÿno placeΓÇÖ.
