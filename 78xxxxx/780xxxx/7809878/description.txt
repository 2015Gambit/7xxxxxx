Documentary which gets to the heart of who Jeff Lynne is and how he has had
such a tremendous musical influence on our world. The story is told by the
British artist himself and such distinguished collaborators and friends of
Jeff as Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh, Olivia and
Dhani Harrison, Barbara Orbison and Eric Idle. The film reveals that Lynne
is a true man of music, for whom the recording studio is his greatest instrument.
With access to Lynne in his studio above LA, this is an intimate account of
a great British pop classicist who has ploughed a unique furrow since starting
out on the Birmingham Beat scene in the early 60s, moving from the Idle Race
to the multi-million selling ELO in the 70s and then, with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty
Roy Orbison and George Harrison, as a key member of the Traveling Wilburys.
