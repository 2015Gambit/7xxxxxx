,lglenwoodc,2012-11-12T14:31Z,"Nice. Thanks. Now that we've seen the great work with the fan edit and for us that haven't seen the series, it looks highly entertaining, Would you consider doing the series the edits came out of, in your unbelievable 1080p quality of course. Would probably be better than anything we could view over Christmas. I know you'll do your best (as always) so thanks either way. We all appreciate the time, effort and resources you sacrifice to share. 

Appreciations!"

Can you please state your question again more clearly? Thanks, bsg4you"
