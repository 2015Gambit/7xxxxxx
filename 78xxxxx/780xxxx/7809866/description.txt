VMware Workstation Ubuntu 12.4 (32bit)+ 5 working serial keys, the only one I could find that works, the 32bit image was downloaded from the VMware site for the 30 day trial, the keys all work, as always block firewall access and don't update the program version, .

I use it for sniffing wifi, the most sensitive combo hands down.
