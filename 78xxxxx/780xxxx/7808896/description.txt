Special Agent Sally Biggs has a secret. She can rewind time--a few
seconds--whenever she wants. It's enough to make her a celebrity at
the FBI and control almost everything in her life. But deep down,
she's afraid of the pain that comes from the things no one can
control. Her worst fears are realized when her scientist husband
disappears mysteriously. Paranormal apparitions begin to surround
her. Strangers with terrifying technologies know her secret, and want
her dead. Her only clue is her husband's ghost--who she follows onto
a battlefield she never knew existed. She must discover the awesome
truth that ties all the mysteries together, before the fabric of her
being--and the ones she loves most--fade out of reality.
