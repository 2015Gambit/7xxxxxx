this was really nice of u and much appreciated"
,gayavenger,2012-11-07T20:22Z,"Hey Tony - Nice of u to fill in the gaps but yours are the only JJ's that work,  The other recent uploaders are trying to charge money to watch this show.  It would nice if you threw a spanner in their plans and uploaded working copies of JJ from E53.  But I guess we'll get used to an incomplete series from now on.  Damn shame that - but thanks for your piddling effort."
