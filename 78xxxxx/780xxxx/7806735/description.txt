tLaw of Attraction says to live in the knowledge that 
you are getting what you want.  It may seem like a feel-
good philosophy and nothing more.  You might think it is 
worth considering, but not something that exists in nature.  
However, the Law of Attraction is based upon the science 
of Physics and can manifest itself in matters of wealth, 
health, and happiness.
