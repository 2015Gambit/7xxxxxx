,wardy0,2012-11-10T04:41Z,why was it nuked? just curios... :)
,SrMLove,2012-11-11T01:59Z,"its the same as sayn it ""bombed"" (its not good)
 ....so use the link provided that says ""proper' in the title..."
,SrMLove,2012-11-11T02:01Z,"first link is sayn fake... im pretty sure ""QborT"" doesnt know what he is talking about... i gave it my best guess.... but nothing seems t make sense b/c those links are b/s"
,apoptosis71,2012-11-11T17:31Z,"trust eztv.  trust the seeders.  this link is fine, i am currently watching it."
,QborT,2012-11-11T19:44Z,"Wow, I feel bad for the ignorance around here.  The links I put up are not fakes, they are legit PROPERS by scene groups.  If you don't understand what all that means then you are hopelessly lost.

I'm not slagging on eztv, they do a great service for this community.  But sometimes scene releases get nuked, not eztv's fault.  But seriously, do yourselves a favor and trust me.  Hell I even linked to VIP uploaders they couldn't possibly be fakes..."
,QborT,2012-11-11T19:54Z,"NUKED:  Dupe Frames and Ghosting.

Seriously if you don't know what nuked means, you probably aren't going to understand the reasons either.... 

It's funny, all I try to do is be a little helpful and point people in the right direction.  

I'd suggest you all take a few minutes to google ""NUKED"" and ""PROPER"" in relations to scene releases.  Learning is for champions, complaining is for bitches.  Good luck newbies."
