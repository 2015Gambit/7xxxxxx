Is this a VHS rip?"
,Seaford,2012-11-09T15:23Z,@afkuser - I don't know what a good quality video is either but I'm going to find out by downloading one episode and finding out - I suggest you do the same!!!
,Seaford,2012-11-15T03:36Z,I've been trying for several days to download some of this to see about it.  As of yet none of it has been downloaded because there appear to be no seeders.
