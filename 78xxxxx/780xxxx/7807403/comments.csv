,MGBHallinONE,2012-11-09T05:36Z,"@mgmostafa
this is the original .iso file downloaded from microsoft.com after purchasing the windows 8 pro =40 usd.
This is the real deal and include 2 pdf to let you know more about windows 8.
No crack included as I do not have one.
Sorry for not adding any information as it is my 1st torrent here."
,MGBHallinONE,2012-11-09T05:46Z,Can I edit the torrent to incllude more details!?
,MGBHallinONE,2012-11-09T05:59Z,"Titles says it all.
Windows 8 Professional Original untouched, downloaded from Microsoft official website on 26/10/2012.
No key or activator or crack included, but just the original .iso file.
You will need any dum ket to be able to set it up, so please use this one:
PF9TR-KNB98-T7JPF-TWF8W-F3G7C
All you need to do is to burn the .iso with a DVD on the most lowest burnning speed.
If you are new to the Windows 8, no problem, I've included 2 recent ebooks with various formats to know more about Windows 8 and believe me when I say you gonna learn a lot by reading these eBooks.
- Window_8_Step_By_Step
- Windows_8_Plain_and_Simple
Sorry if the download speed is slow but you will be seeded 24/7/365.
Sorry if I did not include its built as I am not that technical to know so.
That is all info I know about.
If you want to know anything else ask in comment but please sow down as it is my 1st torrent here :)
Thanks
Enjoy with Respect and seed!"
,Daus90,2012-11-09T06:29Z,Is it x64 or x86 or both?
,sherrypizza,2012-11-09T06:40Z,"@mgmostafa, is it x64 or x86 version?"
,clkgtr2,2012-11-09T06:59Z,"from the size of the iso, its looks to be the 32bit version or X86. Not 64 bit (x64)."
,MGBHallinONE,2012-11-09T11:26Z,"@ all
It is 64x version."
,ashah98,2012-11-09T13:41Z,"@MGBHallinONE

,MGBHallinONE,2012-11-09T18:22Z,"@ ostapai
Please do not hijack or spam the torrent please.
You can go ahead and buy and download then compare without spaming my torrent please.
DUDE, Renaming the .iso file does not mean that it has been modified!!!
Comeone please give me a break here and so some repect and appreciatiaon.
If you like it, download it and if not then leave it.
Thanks!"

With all the due respect & appriciation ...I'd like to tell you that..

Rectify your technical knowledge & english skill as well first...

It's x64 ...not 64x 

& it's 'show' not 'so'

and either way...as ostapai said if the SHA1 & MD5 is not matching then it 'll always be treated as a counterfeit copy ...."
,ZoziRaisin,2012-11-09T18:49Z,"I hope someone here can help me before I download.  My laptop had a hard drive failure and I need to replace with a brand spankin new hard drive.  I'm gonna need to put an operations system on it.  I'm wondering if I downloaded and burned this torrent, will it work on a new hard drive?  Or do I need a whole other program?  Thank you."
,MGBHallinONE,2012-11-09T19:05Z,"@SM-003
Yes English is not my native and yes my technical is not good as well.
So what!?
guys and girls, I purchased this copy and thought sharing it will be good and make someone else happy.
Ok, it seems that I was wrong, drop it and I will delete it.
-END-"
,aauda,2012-11-10T05:32Z,"First, I want to thanks  to MGBHallinONE, I have downloaded and burned the iso file and when I tried to install it asked me a product key and I typed the product key which you have provided in the comment but it says didn't match try again. Can you help me!!!"
,MGBHallinONE,2012-11-10T07:35Z,"@ aauda
I am sorry I do not have any keys except the one I bought.
The reason for uploading this is to provide an untouched and un modified copy of .iso for windows 8 pro 64 bit
I am sorry for not having a valid key :(
Please accept my apologize"
,aauda,2012-11-10T11:10Z,"Well MGBHallinOne, finally I am able to install trying lots of product key but it is not activated so can't access to personalization. Still thanks for the torrent."
,race774,2012-11-10T15:54Z,"For everyone wondering,
It's 64-Bit Windows 8 Pro - Build 9200

I installed on a virtual machine with no problems at all. I activated it with KJ Activator For Windows 8. Just search ""KJ Activator"" on TPB.

Works flawlessly so far. 

I wasn't asked for a product key when installing, possibly because I installed on the virtual machine and chose to enter one later before installion, but from previous W7 installs, I assume there must be an option to not activate during installion and manually enter a key after its installed so anyone having trouble look out for that. But, no guarrantees its there. Just a guess as of now"
,slopet6,2012-11-10T17:09Z,"You really ought to upgrade to a modern bit torrent client such as uTorrent or Vuze.
The old BitComet that you are using has been obsolete for many years now.

Hence the padding files.... "
,Kaero,2012-11-10T22:59Z,Burning this to a disk now. I got the Windows 8 upgrade for $15 but the stupid thing won't completely download windows 8 completely so I'm hoping that this will work with my activation code. Stupid microsoft and their stupid ways of downloading things >
