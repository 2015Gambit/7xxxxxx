[V],psspss,2012-11-09T02:09Z,"hmm just noticed some audio drift as well from 5min to 8min? corrects itself after the ad break splice

this will have to do until a HD source comes to light
and re-do a xvid from it :)"
,swingcat73,2012-11-09T02:38Z,"Thanks, been looking for this"

[V],psspss,2012-11-09T03:18Z,"as I said though I noticed 3 minutes of audio out of sync (but couldnt be stuffed re-editing it to fix it since its minor and syncs back)

and its a bit blurry... but I dont care as long as I get to see it better then nothing"
,freeme13,2012-11-09T06:14Z,Thank you.
,k3nd00d,2012-11-09T07:18Z,"I am trying to post my HDTV capture, but TPB doesn't seem to be getting my posting when I submit the form. Hmmm"
,k3nd00d,2012-11-09T07:28Z,Got mine posted.
[V],psspss,2012-11-09T08:56Z,"ok I will see if I can grab the new hd source of you

i see you choice xvid.. most will still wanted a mp4 or 720p"
,curse,2012-11-09T10:21Z,"Thanx psspss for the effort.
I see k3nd00d added a version where no one mentioned neither blurryness nor oos, so I guess I'll grab that instead. Still thanx for the effort."
,e8hffff,2012-11-09T23:38Z,This seems to be a webrip
[V],psspss,2012-11-10T01:47Z,Lol i said that in the description dont people read before posting or downloading stuff?
[V],psspss,2012-11-10T01:49Z,"sure theres plenty of other versions out now

but mine was a good 12 hours before any other source showed up

again I uppped stating the quality and that
really they best wait for a HD one if they niggly
about quality over just wanting to watch stuff sooner :)"
,SerSpec-V,2012-11-11T23:48Z,This show was a complete joke. Not a good way of starting a season with this waste a time. 
,cindy25,2012-11-13T13:48Z,"any chance u can post Oliver Stone's Secret History
from Showtime ?"
,sup1990,2012-11-14T02:08Z,thank you! i hope you will post the whole season :)
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-14T07:55Z,haha thanks psspss I was looking for this since i don't have cable.. Very watchable since no one has a hd version I suppose no one knew about season 3 and forgot to record it. I have to admit it is watchable but yea its a bit too blurry. I had to sharpen it with VLC.. thanks for the effort. CAN NOT find it anywhere else :/
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T02:56Z,"hdtv versions are now out and in xvid form so I wont bother re-upping..
I think it jogged some cappers to go and get a better source for us :) which is good
I recall this series wasnt capped well last year and I had to hunt down sources even some crappy tv sources so people got to see it"
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T03:02Z,"ser spec-v
maybe this show episode was a joke a bit
but it was pure entertainment

and Jesse kick butt in the end exposing that david icke as a lier so he can earn millions a year conning people

must admit most lizard photos are fake and the rest is really a trick of camera lighting and angels

still was amuzing though

cant wait to see the free energy one.. and the guy who was killed after exposing.. it or invention
Ive been following free energy project for a while some are scammers but some inventions seem to work and perhaps tap into this said dark energy

tesla done some research called radiant energy
he found one can get more energy from a SPARK
he had a circuit that made a spark and 2nd circuit that trap some of the energy from a spark and found it had much more energy they was put into the circuit various inventors have taken this on over the years like EV gray and peter lindennman
(look up cold electrity and very interesting lecture on it)"
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T03:03Z,":O Im out of data CAP! darn leechers have ruinned it a bit.. greedy free loaders.. so I wont be able to share any hard to find episodes or converts for
a WEEK! :(("
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T12:45Z,"theres a good interview with JESE on C2Cam

my UFO bundle when I get data again and share in 5 days

here is a useful list of S03 episodes
=---------------------------------------

301 (16) ""Reptilian [19]"" November 7, 2012 (2012-11-07)
Ventura looks into one of Time Magazine's ""Top 10"" ranked conspiracies â&#x20AC;&#x201D; that some world leaders and other influential people are really shape-shifting lizard beings from another planet who are manipulating the world in human form. Tyrel and Shawn interview a self-proclaimed hybrid, while Jesse reviews video of alleged shape-shifting in progress, searches for a rumored alien base in Dulce, New Mexico, and finally interviews the man who popularized the conspiracy, David Icke.
302 (17) ""Death Ray [19]"" November 14, 2012 (2012-11-14)
Ventura looks into rumors that the government is using directed-energy weapon technology, not only for strategic missile defense, but as a tool for assassination and possible false flag operations. Ventura feels he's on to something when he learns numerous people involved in the project have died under mysterious circumstances, (including whistle-blower Fred Bell, who died two days after an interview), and a theory that a ray may have been used to disintegrate and collapse the World Trade Center towers on 9/11.
