[V],LeonardTSpock,2012-11-10T06:40Z,"Well, I guess after the two you uploaded (thanks, btw), the only one I hadn't uploaded yet was 24 (done now). So we're still just missing 23 and 26."
,whaletail935,2012-11-10T12:44Z,"IIRC, 26 (or perhaps 23) wasn't even available via TwoMorrows as a hard copy.  Can't remember the artist, but I was really trying to find it a few months ago.

In any case, thanks much for this.  Powell's quite the talent.  Fans who don't typically read Conan should check out the guest issue (Robert E. Howard Centenary tribute) he wrote and drew for the initial Dark Horse series.  Can't remember the exact issue, but I think it was in the high 20s."
,STFmaryville,2012-11-10T23:04Z,"LeonardTSpock, thanks again for posting all the other ones. You posted the Guy Davis one, that was a tough one to get! Yes as whaletail935 pointed out, Volume 23 - Darwyn Cooke was never published. TwoMorrows had an ad over a year ago saying the interview was finally done and it would be out soon, but it isn't. So yes, Volume 26 - Frazer Irving is the only one published out of 27 (number 1-22 & 24-28) that we don't have. I suspect it hasn't been scanned."
