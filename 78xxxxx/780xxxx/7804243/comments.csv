I've been waiting for this for years.

I will help seed this pretty much forever if it's real.
Thank you ZilEighty or should I say sil-eighty lol."
,Big_and_fluffy2000,2012-11-08T14:08Z,"ya its real, they came out with the episode on the 6th, i tried to upload it yesterday but TPB took to long to load and i was tired, if you play with VLC, be sure to download the latest version, otherwise you'll get a green screen and only hear audio, if you play with something like divx, then you wont get subtitles"
,FeaGaur,2012-11-08T19:10Z,"Thanks but I use Windows Media Player Classic and it works perfectly(also the subtitles are good)

Perfect video and audio quality.

Again thanks for this upload. Will be helping seeding for as long as I have a computer lol.
