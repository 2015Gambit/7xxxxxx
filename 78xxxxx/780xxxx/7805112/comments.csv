,mooserocka,2012-11-08T19:42Z,Thank you so much daman. I have been waiting for this for so long. So whats next on your release list? You should send out a release list with dates. Either way i dont mind checking every day you just type daman and if something new is uploaded it pops up. Once again sorry for the arguements on your pages i have no conrol over that but am partially at fault for responding usualy i just ignore. I appoligize anyway your awesome thanks daman. 
,vashterbation,2012-11-09T00:41Z,@Daman Why such a big file size for this one?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-09T01:05Z,"Vash Episode 00 is 50mins, so its 2.2x the size of regular episode"
,mooserocka,2012-11-09T18:14Z,I think episode 0 is an ova. Im not sure though. I didnt know weather to start with that or episode 1. I looked around the internet and they said it doesnt matter. I actually watched like 6 episodes so far. This show is not what i expected. The audio and video are 10/10. I mean the actual show itself. I was expecting like a detective conan type of show but more mature. I did not get that. Its still good just not what i expected which is a huge letdown. I am going to keep watching hope it gets better. Daman what anime is next on your release list?
,mooserocka,2012-11-09T18:49Z,O yea i forgot to ask you daman When Are you releasing Shangri La and 006 if you are releasing them. I remember you saying your def going to release Shangri la ITs an amazing anime I only saw like 5 episodes but im DYING to see more.
