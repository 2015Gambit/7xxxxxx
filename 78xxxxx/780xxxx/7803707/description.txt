Mac + Devin Go To High School
Soundtrack (2011)





The soundtrack to their Cheech & Chong-like feature film, Mac and Devin Go to High School finds Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa in glorious stoner mode, offering plenty of blunt anthems and smokers delights. Production-wise, the album is split evenly between booming, G-Funk nostalgia (prime cut ΓÇ£I Get LiftedΓÇ¥ features a slow, rolling, Warren G beat) and more contemporary, Wiz-friendly sounds (lead single ΓÇ£Young, Wild & FreeΓÇ¥ is polished, bright, sunshine material crafted by Bruno Mars and his crew, the Smeezingtons). Highly desirable names like Jake One, Drumma Boy, Exile, and Nottz fill the rest of the production credits, and while the material is light and redundant, anyone with a little hip-hop schooling should be prepared, and rightly assume, this is much more How High than Blackout! Snoop and Wiz offer a flashy, multi-generational alternative to Method and Red, and bouncing between their styles keeps this single-minded effort from being a bore. The target audience should think of it as a bag marked ΓÇ£regsΓÇ¥ that comes with no organic flavor or transcendent buzz, but is easy to roll and surprisingly dank.
