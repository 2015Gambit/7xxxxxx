Read Me!

I AM LIMITED TO MY BANDWIDTH. 
THERE ARE TIMES I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEED! SO PLEASE BE PATIENT!
Seeding may be staggered due to my bandwidth allocation. Seeding speed is around 10kbps to 20kbps! Don't complaint and do not PM me asking for high speed seeding, what you see is what you get! It may take sometimes for the torrent to complete, but my computer runnin' 365 days 24/7!... Enjoy!

Howdy!
Eighteen.eight gb it's quite big & with ten-twenty kilobytes that goes in, it's takin' a long time to upload. Downloading from ur computers seems to be taking a while, but like an ol' sayin' it's better late than never. I ain't no quiter i gave it 110 percent (as opposed to 100%)'til then i'm done!. Now y'all, when you're done please help me seed, i dont have much bandwidth & cannot seed for long, so PLEASE HELP ME SEED, Thanks y'all. Any country music fans around the globe can appreciate this stuffs. Anyway, you don't have to download it bcoz of my poor upload speed,ten-twenty kilobytes that's all i can give. I'm sorry!. I base my calculations on the expectation that this torrents will complete in 30 days!
