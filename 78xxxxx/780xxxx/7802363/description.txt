 Omi Khurana's London dream has just ended.     
 On the run from a dangerous UK gangster        
 who he owes money to, Omi returns to his       
 native village in Punjab, pretending to be a   
 well-heeled London lawyer. Much has changed    
 since Omi ran away from home a decade          
 back after stealing money from his doting      
 grandfather, Darji. The old man has since      
 become senile and most importantly, forgotten  
 the secret recipe of "Chicken Khurana" a       
 dish that made the Khurana dhaba  famous       
 across Punjab. Omi's childhood sweetheart,     
 Harman is soon to be married to his cousin,    
 Jeet, though neither seems too happy about it. 
 Adding to the quirkiness of the Khurana family 
 is a free loader uncle, Titu, who once did     
 a stint at a mental asylum. Will Omi be able to
 cover his deceit and lies for long, even as    
 he tries to recover the lost recipe of         
 Chicken Khurana - the family's only hope       
 to reclaim their pride & wealth.
