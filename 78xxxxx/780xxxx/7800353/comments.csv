Yes you can, if only you would install the same free software that everybody else uses instead of insisting on using the crappy thing that is bundled with your computer. I could tell you where to get it, but you aren't a baby bird, are you!"

,jalucian,2012-11-11T15:17Z,raiderman77... stop whining and being an idiot and use VLC like you should. There's no excuse for people using any other player. VLC plays everything including mkv with no need to DL codec's.
