It's a matter of laugh or death in Theme HospitalT, another installment
of the Theme series. Design, maintain and manage a hi-tech hospital
facility, making the most of limited resources and turning cures into
cash. The Grim Reaper stalks the corridors, the ill have some very
odd ailments, and the staff want to play doctors and nurses together.
No matter how you look at it, you're in control of a very sick hospital.

If there is one word that describes Theme Hospital then it has to be
"hilarious." Almost everything in this game is made with great dose of
humour. You might think that someone's illness is not a laughing matter
but wait till you see a patient with KingComplex dressed as Elvis or
serious case of Hairyitis caused from prolonged exposure to the moon.

Finding treatments for such diseases is a part of your job, but there's
no prescription to cure the insanity that may result from trying to
figure out those cures. You start off small with an empty building, a
few doctors, a general diagnostic, a pharmacy, a reception desk, and a
few other necessities. From there it's up to you to move your way up
in the health care industry.

A hospital simulator is not something you might consider a good theme
for a game but the guys from Bullfrog Productions were famous for
creating innovative and fun titles from the craziest idea -- and Theme
Hospital no exception. This game is a piece of art and definitely the
best "hospital" simulation so check it out. Our diagnosis: fun!

Since there sadly are games that are since long lost, and other games
where as only exists archived as rip's - we, gamers that love retro-
games - decided to release classics so that you too can enjoy these
as we do. Don't want it? Then don't keep it.
