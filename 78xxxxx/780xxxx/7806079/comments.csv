,koltbolt,2012-11-09T11:38Z,"A screener??? This means Oscar season is approaching. Time for hollywood elite (academy members) to read the dvd covers, vote for their favourite actors and directors from a current flim but choose based on movies they did three to fifteen years ago, then let their kids upload the screener to the pirate bay! Merry Christmas everyone!!!! "
,Vacum66,2012-11-09T13:59Z,Thanks Sam!!Great copy!!

,animalmcburger,2012-11-09T17:51Z,"Best cop movie in a long time.  Filmed in a way that really keeps you at the edge of your seat BUT be warned, the plot kinda gets thrown together at the end.  None the less, great f`n cop movie."

The biggest load of bollocks i've seen in a long long time.
How Ray Winstone put his name to this shit isbeyond me. Must have been a need for an extra few hundred thousand in his Pension Fund.

The screen writer should be shot with his own balls of shit.
The editor has to have Parkinson's or some other degenerative disease which renders him/her incapable of cutting scenes properly.
The director really went out on a limb to prove he should have stuck with flipping eggs.
And to top it all off. The BBC,.  courtesy of Top Gear endorsed this pile of shit. 
Saying that it's not surprising. They gave Jimmy Saville a nice young Cock Warmer every day for decades.

The upload is immaculate as always by SaM. But this movie is so fucking shit it's beyond belief.

But don't take my word for it. download and form your own opinion.

Good to see that they have the Suprbay home page up on the monitors in the slick office scene around 58.13mins.

This movie was leaked purposefully because it's such a crock of shit it'll never see the inside of any reputable movie theatre or corner video store.

END OF RANT!!!   ;-)"
,dfl3506,2012-11-10T04:58Z,Ray Winstone just trying too hard to be tough... and failing.
,zhool,2012-11-10T11:46Z,"don't tell me what to do, kaiser.
i WILL take your word for it, not download it and leave my opinion unformed. so there."
,russTnail,2012-11-11T00:45Z,"@newportbox.....sharing is caring dude. way to go with TPB spirit. everything I download is fed back at least 1:1 so others have a chance to view and form their own opinion. I will download, view and share even though it's not a great review....it is free after all"

I registered an account after five years of using this site daily without, just because I had to express my disgust for your attitude.

Please, please, be nicer."
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-11-11T11:00Z,"NewportBox just trolling, don't feed him/her. If he wasn't trolling and was just a leech he/she would just download and not seed, yet they leave comments to get reactions."

Total respect for my friends in the UK, but I know I cannot be the only American on here who doesn't understand half the dialog in this film. 

They are speaking ""English"" English so fast, it's like -- WTF did they just say. Reminds me of the Pikeys in Snatch. Gonna look for some subs. Cool movie, though. Cheers. "
