============================================

Transcripted is a mixture of two incredibly addictive and vastly popular casual gaming genres: the dual-stick shooter and the match three puzzle game. In Transcripted players take control of the Nano Probe, a microscopic apparatus used to combat disease. With the aid of a skill tree that improves ship equipment, health, shields and the Nano Probe's arsenal of upgradeable weapons, players must successfully navigate through hordes of deadly pathogens to destroy the disease's pseudo-DNA as it twines perilously on its endless path to infection. Along the way players must defeat gigantic boss colonies the pathogen has evolved with the sole purpose of stopping the Nano Probe from completing its mission. Difficulty levels of both puzzle and shooting segments can be adjusted independently to suit every play style, making Transcripted an incredibly replayable experience.
