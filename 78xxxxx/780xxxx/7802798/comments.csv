,tomc100,2012-11-07T23:40Z,"Simple math. 

freeloaders>workers =Obama

Dream Act +backdoor amnesty=permanent Democrat majority

mainstream media corruption=morons

morons>critical thinkers=Biden 2016"
,tensigh2,2012-11-07T23:40Z,"I'm dumbfounded. I can't believe people can't look at the unemployment rate and Obama and put 2 and 2 together.

,ItBitTorrent,2012-11-08T05:52Z,Sometimes you have to touch bottom before turning around. Apparently we (United States) haven't been there...yet. Rush will only flourish in this time of adversity.
