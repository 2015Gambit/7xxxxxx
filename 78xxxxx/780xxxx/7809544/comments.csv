,Tegra3,2012-11-13T14:57Z,It works for me! Select the game from Multiman and it will kick you back to Xmb. The default Ps3 start up. Once the game shows on the Xmb the Ps3 make sure your internet is either plug in or wireless working. what I notice is the game checks for a internet connection before booting. I can assure 100% the this method works.

Is there no way to do this without the active connection? I don't want to risk connecting to the net."
