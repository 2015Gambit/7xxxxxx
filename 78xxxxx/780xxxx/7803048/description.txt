This is an "after-the-fact" compilation of Murdoch Mysteries Season 5 from many different individual sources.

This was somewhat difficult to assemble because no one group had all 13 episodes available - so there is a myriad of different formats [mp4/mkv/avi] and quality is a bit "across the board".  Then there is the fact that some uploaders incorrectly labelled certain episodes [episode 8 and episode 11 come to mind].  Oh - and let's not forget the hard-coded swedish subs [episodes 8/9/10]!  At least the uploaders will know their stuff when they see it!

Thank you to all the people that ripped, uploaded, and kept seeding :)

I apologize to the original rippers/uploaders for removing credits via renaming files to follow "show - ep# - title" - my OCD felt it necessary to label them properly - since they were somehow uploaded wrong - maybe a correct label *may* have averted that...?

This is for all the people late to the party like myself.  Murdoch Mysteries is a pretty fun show - but I am guessing the fanbase is small enough that the individual episodes may fade over time...

Here is an attempt to keep season 5 alive and in one torrent.  At least until Season 5 hits blu-ray (and DVD of course) sometime in March 2013 :)
