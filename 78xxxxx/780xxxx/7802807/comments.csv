,aibonlengket,2012-11-08T09:08Z,"one other thing is, if we use this, the online server that shows up is only demo server. so that would be 1600 @ proto. i can confirm, if using the legit key, the server are a lot more. but this really is not so much of an issue, since we can actually can the ip of the server. so no problem. the cracker group just need to get that Battery always working, not zero charge. hopefully we can get it soon.
