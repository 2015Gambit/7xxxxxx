,drader,2012-11-12T23:48Z,I like that someone named 'mossrite' is bellyaching about someone else's name on here.
,warmachinewtf,2012-11-13T02:42Z,"I have a copy of the bootleg where someone snuck in the concert with a decent video camera.

Ill upload it if its gone from here. Its watchable but the quality isn't even close to what we are waiting for. 
If your a fan I would consider waiting for the real deal. 
They sucked at Live aid, they sucked at Atlantic Anniversary, Hall of fame gig was....ok.
Page/Plant with a dozen musicians was awesome to see live but it still wasn't the real deal.

They fucking nailed it at the O2! 
Its Led Zeppelin! "
