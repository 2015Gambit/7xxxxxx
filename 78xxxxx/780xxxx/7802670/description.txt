The designers are treated to a night at the museum by Alex and discover that for their next challenge they will be working in teams. They are asked to create demi couture outfits inspired by what they have seen at the museum. While each designer is individually responsible for their own outfit, as a team their creations must form a cohesive collection. With the winning team being safe from elimination, there is a lot at stake, but not everyone is a team player. Who will put their differences aside and wow the judges and who will go home?

A big thank you to all original cappers and posters.
