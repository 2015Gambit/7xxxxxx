Dead or Alive 5 *REAL* REPACK (c) Tecmo

Date      : 11-2012                   Languages: English
Platform  : PS3                       Genre    : Fighting

Release Info:

In DEAD OR ALIVE 5, players will once again take on the roles of the cast
of DEAD OR ALIVE fighters in an intense, action-packed brawler set in
visually striking locations from around the world. The famed DOA
hand-to-hand combat returns, supported by completely new 3D stages that
update the series' characteristic style with a fresh look and feel.

Notes:

Our initial release was a bad rip (still encrypted files), then our repack
seemed ok for a while, but then it turned out, that it freezes in story
mode at a certain stage in NY (and maybe elsewhere) due to 5 corrupt files.

Well, since DUPLEX cares about quality we have done a 3rd attempt to get this
game out properly - what a nightmare! So this time we ripped it from
a different original and with different consoles and crc compared several rips.
So this one should be working alright and if not we can't help it either :wink:
A fix would have been 2gb - so we decided to pre the entire game again..

We've tested it with our upcoming Eboot Patch on CFW 3.55

Enjoy This Fine DUPLEX Release
