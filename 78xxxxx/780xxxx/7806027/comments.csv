Oh please try to release other magix music stuff like the music maker special editions and stuff like that but thanks anyway for this great release :D"
,Abaris777,2012-11-10T05:18Z,"Hi trialanderror, thanx and well doe for ur job, however i cant find the Magix Vita Solo Instruments....can u plz help? cheers!"
,Abaris777,2012-11-10T06:27Z,*especially the Vita Upright Bass. :/
[T],trialanderror,2012-11-10T08:44Z,"The add-on instruments can be downloaded from the ""Instruments"" tab. When you click ""More..."" there, you will be directed to the download page. There are 12 additional instruments. The upright bass is one of them. Normally they cost extra, but all but two (concert guitar and soundtrack percussion) seem to work without registration. I will probably pack them into a torrent and up them later."

[T],trialanderror,2012-11-10T12:34Z,"Sorry, I have no idea where to find that, and to be honest no personal interest in it."
,EpicJkz,2012-11-10T13:12Z,"hey do u know how can i fix this ?
everytime i try to run like busy drums it says: the following VST plugins cannot be loaded = vita"
[T],trialanderror,2012-11-11T17:50Z,Even updating seems to work. You just need to replace the protein file again afterwards and you may need to specify the path for the soundpools. Other than that i see no problems. The person who cracked this did an awesome job. Even all the add-on vita instruments work without activation. You can find them here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7811155/MAGIX_Music_Maker_2013_Add-On_Instruments_[trialanderror]
,shirleyj,2012-11-12T15:25Z,i need a good download link
,OreanoX,2012-11-12T19:22Z,Is there any Keygen? I can just try the test version..
[T],trialanderror,2012-11-12T22:27Z,No keygen. You need to replace a file. Read the install guide.
,Dragonisseth,2012-11-20T03:26Z,"Install went fine, but everytime I try to run the exe. in protein folder, it requests authorization, then does nothing. Any suggestions?"
[T],trialanderror,2012-11-25T20:48Z,You don't start the program by clicking the exe in the protein folder. Click the desktop shortcut or choose from your programs list.
