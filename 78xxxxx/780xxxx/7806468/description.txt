The New Seekers are a British-based pop group, formed in 1969 by Keith Potger
after the break-up of his group, the Seekers. The idea was that the New Seekers
would appeal to the same market as the original Seekers, but their music had
rock as well as folk influences. They achieved worldwide success in the early
1970s.
