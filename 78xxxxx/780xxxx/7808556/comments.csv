[T],teslaman,2012-11-09T13:09Z,Sorry for the delay on this one. Ended up having to redo it a 2nd time because of the crop issue in the first 720P release.
,dvdrip111,2012-11-09T15:57Z,what about a non 720p lighter avi version
[T],teslaman,2012-11-10T05:16Z,"Oh, sorry for the confusion there. My encode isn't 720p, I just use the 720p as the source. 

It's just High Quality SD in the 480p size range. ;) Normally this would be 700MB, but the double episode....well, doubled the size. :P"
