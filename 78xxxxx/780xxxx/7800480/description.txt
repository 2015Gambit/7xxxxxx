Set over Halloween weekend of 1987, My Brothers is the story
of three young brothers' epic quest to replace their dying
father's watch. Noel, 17, serious, weighed down by
responsibility; Paudie: 11, cocky, not so bright and dreams
of playing in goals for Liverpool and Scwally: 7, naive and
obsessed with Star Wars (despite never actually having seen
the films). Using a battered bread van, the brothers embark
on a journey across the wild Irish landscape on the Halloween
weekend, grinding gears and screaming at each other to get to
an arcade machine in Ballybunion. Along the way they are detoured
by escalating brotherly battles in an off-beat and moving journey
that can only lead them home.
