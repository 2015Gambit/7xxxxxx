Not one comment on any of the season, that's terrible...
I appreciate your effort =)

I see u have added several torrents on the same day. It has now been 14 days since you started seeding, and you're still the only seeder on season 3 and 4. Have you considered using a ""initial seed"" function where you share different parts to different people? 
This would be a faster way of getting up the count of seeders. 

Keep up the good work! "
