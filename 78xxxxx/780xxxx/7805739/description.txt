Because she loves the prince and she's only four years older than him, the Empress also sends assassins to protect the prince. Even in the palace, the prince also escapes all the Emperor's assassination plans. In order to celebrate the 100th day of his reign, the Emperor will organize a banquet.

A loose adaptation of Hamlet, is set in an empire in chaos.
