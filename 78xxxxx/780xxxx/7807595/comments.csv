,Swaddles,2012-11-10T18:52Z,"dvdrip111 ,  if your having problems viewing this you should download VLC media player it is by far the best and most versatile media player I have ever used and it's free.  It's the only one that plays every file type I have encontered"
,dvdrip111,2012-11-10T21:35Z,"thanks for the answer, but i need avi version to play it directly on my tv, it only reads avi."
,ziffel323,2012-11-11T02:56Z,@dvdrip111: convert it from mp4 to avi. tons of free converters out there.
