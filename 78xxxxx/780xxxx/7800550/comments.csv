Lagomoprh in Neon ""sculptureWallVegasNeonSign.Sims3Pack"""
,kakifry,2012-11-24T18:03Z,"Actually the other 4 objects from the Happy Holidays Presents were also mispriced, but I learned that it's not a problem with your files, but rather the problem was with rachelstoolbox's ""Complete Sims 3 Store"" torrent.  So sorry to waste your time, and I'll take it up with her."
