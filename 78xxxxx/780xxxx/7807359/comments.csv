V:10
A:10

,diabloweb,2012-11-09T19:17Z,tnks!
,Primuz017,2012-11-09T22:19Z,"Don't download, audio is broken. You can chose between the audio 1 and audio 2. One is commentary and other one should be the real movie audio, problem is that you can hear the background music and when people speak on the television etc. But you can't hear the character voices. SO DO NOT DOWNLOAD. And delete this crap BOZX. Maybe check the movie before uploading it?"
,firexninja,2012-11-09T23:24Z,thank you!
,Primuz017,2012-11-10T00:23Z,"Ignore my previous comment, the audio settings were wrong as default. "
[V],HolyRoses,2012-11-10T01:35Z,you can probably remux it with mkvtoolnix
[V],HolyRoses,2012-11-10T03:35Z,"if you remux it, note that one of the Chinese subtitles is set to default as well."

[T],SCSA420,2012-11-12T05:22Z,"JUST A HEADS UP FOR PEOPLE DOWNLOADING THIS TORRENT

WARNING:  THIS TOTAL RECALL MOVIE AND THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN MOVIE ARE INFECTED WITH CINIVIA AND WILL NOT PLAY ON PS3 OR ANY BLURAY PLAYERS THAT HAVE CINIVIA IN THEIR FIRMWARE IF THE AUDIO IS CONVERTED TO AC3 OR AAC FORMAT FROM DTS. 

IF YOU HAVE TO CONVERT THE AUDIO FROM DTS TO AC3 AND VIDEO FROM MKV TO MP4 TO PLAY ON PS3 IT SUCKS BECAUSE THE PS3 WON'T PLAY IT. :( 

HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE A BLURAY PLAYER THAT IS CINIVIA FREE LIKE I DO THEN THIS MKV VIDEO WILL PLAY FINE. "
