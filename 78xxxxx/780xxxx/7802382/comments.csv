[V],NLUPPER002,2012-11-10T08:01Z,"May be so, but I felt sued, and if you were right, I did not say anything."
,Chupacabra321,2012-11-11T07:19Z,"Even fuckin Arab subs but no spanish...Guess Im gonna have to use english subs.

Thanks.
By the way, the official release date for this one is December the 18th. Too much time."
,torpydoo,2012-11-13T05:55Z,"damn this spanish. don't blame the uploader for not having your language as subs. and another damn for blaming the uploader that you can't understand english as INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE. i'm from a non-english speaking country.

it's good that ferdinand magellan brought hundreds of spaniards into massacre.

BILLION THANKS for the release."

@ the linguistically challenged: There is only one form of true rape concerning subtitles: Morons who hardcode them!!!
