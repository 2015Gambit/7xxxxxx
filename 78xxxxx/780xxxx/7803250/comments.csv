The web site is listed in my description. What do you mean by ""cylinders"" and so forth?"

Could you rephrase this for me? Thx, I don't quite understand what you mean."

This boot disk often triggers false positives."

,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-10T03:22Z,"Hiren releases to a few folks [not sure exactly how many] on an Email list that has link(s) to ""cyber locker"" sites. After I download it, I share it via Bittorrent here at TPB. But, there are others who get it using a search engine like Google. You will find other site that have direct download links."
,adrianyujs,2012-11-12T03:47Z,"Hi, may I know where I can download complete program for this? It seem some of them are missing which is paid one, so hope somebody can create a complete HBCD :)"
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-12T14:30Z,"@adrianyujs

I am not sure what you mean by ""missing""? Or, ""complete""?
Hiren releases HBCD. And, after a few weeks another group modifies his release to create Hirens Boot CD/DVD ""Restored"". This has all the commercial software that Hiren stopped including as of HBCD v11.0"
,adrianyujs,2012-11-14T02:03Z,"@TheEmpathicEar

Yeah I means commercial software, hope somebody have complete commercial software in latest HBCD and share with us :)"
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-11-14T03:37Z,"@adrianyujs

They will. As I pointed out, it is called Hiren's Boot DVD ""Restored"". After a new version of Hiren's is released, someone uses it as a starting point and creates this version that contains the commercial software and more. It is usually uploaded at [h][3][3][t] and possibly here at TPB."
