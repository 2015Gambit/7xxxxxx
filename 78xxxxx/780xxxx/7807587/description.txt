MY RATING OF THIS EPISODE: 4 of 5 stars


-1 star for even entertaining that idiot lying woman claiming to be a reptilian and for making me feel uncomfortable with the David Icke confrontation. +4 for addressing this belief and, frankly, properly expressing skepticism and pressing David Icke (who by saying the elite are literally shapshifting reptoids actually taint the other issues Icke's theories and facts share with other people's). (Yes, I think the Icke thing was good and bad.)
