[V],psspss,2012-11-09T08:05Z,if I had knowing you have a hdtv I wouldnt of added mine today :)
[V],psspss,2012-11-09T08:22Z,however i cant find any seeders and not on any http tracker since I dont use udp
,Hilpi75,2012-11-09T08:23Z,Thank you much  ;)  Been waiting for the new season of Conspiracy Theory   :)
,k3nd00d,2012-11-09T08:32Z,"Hehe, no biggy. I have a feeling this is the ""bad"" episode of this season. I hope the other 6 are better (7 total, an 8th episode TruTV said won't air, I guess...not sure of its topic yet)."
,k3nd00d,2012-11-09T08:34Z,"psspss, but your torrent for this only used udp...I figured that was the trend, to not use http anymore."
,k3nd00d,2012-11-09T08:36Z,"I just added the http versions of the trackers in this post. So manually add them if you need to.

,k3nd00d,2012-11-09T08:48Z,"Oh wait, the topic of the season 3 episode they will not be airing is the TSA."
,curse,2012-11-09T10:18Z,Thank you!
,EliteBeast,2012-11-09T10:57Z,"I had no idea they were doing a 3rd season, too bad nothing has helped cause obama was re-elected instead of Ron Paul or Gary Johnson winning. Just vote independent next time which should be Jesse Ventura, if there is anything left of USA in 2016"
,RicanLord83,2012-11-09T15:24Z,"Yea they actually finished this season like 8 months ago but was put on hold because one episode is called ""Free Energy"" and the guy who was giving all the info to Jesse told him that the CIA watches him to make sure he doesn't reveal any top secret info and he wouldn't be surprised if he was killed for what he told Jesse...2 weeks later he died. So they were shaken up about releasing the show."
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-09T20:57Z,"Hey k3n, quick q-

Will you be uploading s02 of Doomsday Preppers like you did with s01? I capped the s02e00 special that aired a week or so ago but won't be uploading it until another week or two, (I've got like 200 things to up) so I was just wondering if I should continue capping/releasing Doomsday Preppers season 2 or if you plan to do it."
,k3nd00d,2012-11-10T08:24Z,"I was going to get S2 of Preppers. I did not catch the special, I'd have to see if it is going to re-air and cap it unless you put it up. Hey, you and psspss have skulls and I don't. *cry* LOL"
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-11-10T15:10Z,"Great, I'll let you get S2 of the show then - less work on my end. :P I dunno if/how soon the special airs again, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's on the day of the season premiere.

I'm sure you'll get your skull one day. :)"
,k3nd00d,2012-11-10T21:06Z,"I think the special you refer to is episode 1, it aired last Sunday. Ep 2 is this coming Tuesday (regular night)...but I already got ep 2. I'll get ep 1 when it re-airs this Tuesday."
,SerSpec-V,2012-11-11T06:10Z,"Thanks, finally this is airing on TV. "
,cindy25,2012-11-13T13:51Z,can u post Oliver Stone's secret history?
[V],psspss,2012-11-13T13:53Z,"cos utorrent tends to leak real ip when using proxies (can test with checkyourtorrentip site)
also read the how tos there about making secure
and preventing leaks

I abondon udp as http and tcp wont leak

it depends how you run your p2p client of course
but I go for max security"
,sup1990,2012-11-14T02:09Z,thank you! i hope you will post the whole season :)
,furthur11,2012-11-14T04:14Z,Thank You!!Yeah! finally season 3!! i've been waiting for these to kick off again. just pure entertainment :) 
,lif3isfr33,2012-11-14T08:53Z,"much better rip than the one I previously downloaded from psspss. LOL no harm done. I watched this one with more ease. Thanks man, I appreciate it. "
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T02:50Z,"cheeky.. if it wasnt me providing you people missed episodes in any source form you miss many shows
sometimes posting a missed show reminds some other cappers to record it and get a hdtv one
as well. people just forget to record
"
[V],psspss,2012-11-15T02:53Z,"note various sites like tpb change the uploaded
tracker lists and even inserts its own UDP trackers

its good to add some other http trackers and hope they are deleted.. i think some stick as I see people connecting to my http ones and when they connect they relay the ip to the udp trackers for me"
,tuckd,2012-11-15T06:51Z,That was hilarious! I'd forgotten all about Mr Icke and his lunacy! Haha former Governor Ventura lets him have it! Awesome viewing. Thanks for the upload!
