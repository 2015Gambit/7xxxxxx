,samljer,2012-11-09T18:27Z,"@softkille05 

Id avoid playing this anyway. 
pre-release play = ban hammer.


iMAX drive FW on DL Verbatims imgburn
is how i do them with 99% perfect burns every time.

if you dont have iMAX you could try overburn i guess but i dont trust that. others say its fine though so do as you will. GOOGLE the tutorial."
