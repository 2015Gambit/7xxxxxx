,twisterjh,2012-11-13T19:23Z,"@EuroGroover you are welcome :) I wish it was in better shape. this is one of my favorites and was my first vinyl I ever got. I was recently in an antique store that had about 5 of bob Seger's Stranger in town and I'm like ""Oh man maybe I can get a better shape one!"" they were all in worse shape then I have and some pretty much had no grooves!
