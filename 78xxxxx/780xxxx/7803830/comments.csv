,weaping_reaper,2012-11-08T06:41Z,"@sceneline Why do you upload ""Supernatural"" If you have a problem with it? Every rar I download from you has a fucked up title. At first they didn't seem so bad, But always something gay ..and now this one says ""Super Gay brothers naturally* So I take it you are part of the whole Wincest joke  
Sooo.. Why do you even upload them? 

As for the quality.. V/10 A/10  @ cranked
Your rips are always my favorites .. But why?"
