RYMUR (The Leo Ryan Murder/Jonestown Investigation) On November 18, 1978, while investigating human rights abuses by a large cult led by James Warren ΓÇ£JimΓÇ¥ Jones (1931-1978), Congressman Leo Ryan (1925-1978) and several companions were murdered by JonesΓÇÖ followers. Ryan had traveled to ΓÇ£Jonestown,ΓÇ¥ the cultΓÇÖs compound in the South American country of Guyana, at the behest of his constituents, some of whom had family members in the cult. Following RyanΓÇÖs murder, Jones ordered his followers to commit mass suicide; more than 900 bodies were later found, most having died by taking poison. The FBI, charged with investigating violence against public officials, opened a probe into the murder of Ryan (hence the case name RYMUR) and provided other support and investigative assistance in relation to the mass casualties.
