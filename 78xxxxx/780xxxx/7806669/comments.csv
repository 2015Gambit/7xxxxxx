Hope they don't go weaksauce on this version like they did with version 4. 
Tons of achievements but no rewards for them...just bragging rights. 14 year olds might be satisfied with that but if I have to run all over killing pigeons and finding things I want some sweet assed weapons or car upgrades...SOMETHING! lol"

,herpthederp,2012-11-09T09:49Z,"This is pretty sweet, thanks."
,brianxxx,2012-11-09T16:57Z,"THE PASSWORD IS FINE...and copy and paste works too.

You just have to be sure you copied only the password and not more, which happens easily to those without mouse skills or any other ability to calmly manipulate their digits."
