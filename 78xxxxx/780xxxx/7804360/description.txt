-Latest Upload of Norton-


Please forgive me for all my mistakes of all the other uploads of Norton.

I have just made a ISO of the disc. Once your download finishes, extract the ISO and copy all the files other than the txt file with the serial in it to ImgBurn. Choose "Write files/folders to disc". Drag and drop all the extracted files and folders to ImgBurn and hit the burn button. Once it's done you can pop it in and install Norton with the Serial.

Sorry about the slow downloads.

I will be seeding this for a while!
