Rock on, Prez Obama!!"

I'm not too upset about the result of the election, just upset that the majority of my fellow citizens are blind enough to usher in an end to America as we know it. Four more years... and we'll be the United Socialist States of America. RIP Freedom"

,RTT2,2012-11-08T10:53Z,"Well said, retrenched! The other comments are typical of what Conservatives need to lose (racism, conspiracy theories about communism/socialism, and also Global Warming, and even birth certificates!) and believe me, there will be a long-overdue backlash against them and their Tea Party cohorts, because they lost the election for the republicans....

Tea Party over!"
,AlexLibman,2012-11-09T07:39Z,"Sadness.

This assures that USA will continue to slide down on the rankings of economic freedom and international competitiveness, perhaps even faster than it has under Obama's first term.  Once a uniquely superlative nation in the world, it will end up just another Argentina...  More brains and capital will go elsewhere, and the best business innovations will happen somewhere else...

Why start the next IBM or Pfizer in a socialist cesspool like New York when there's Singapore or Dubai - or whatever other champions of economic freedom will soon emerge.  As USA is a champion of capitalism no more, it will be those new places that will encompass humanity's greatest accomplishments in the 21st century.

Evolution will find a way, and capitalism will survive.  Civilization sees socialism as damage and routes around it.  Obama cannot build a Berlin Wall to keep us from escaping, so in the end he will simply run out of competent people to tax.  These historical processes do take many decades to play out, and USA still ranks pretty well compared to most large countries in the world - but, sooner or later, ""atlas"" will ""shrug""!"
,AlexLibman,2012-11-09T08:15Z,"Retrenched:  You use words like ""integrity"", ""competence"", and ""truth"", but in applying them to the empty suit of cheap charisma that is Obama you demonstrate that you have no understanding of what those words actually mean.  As for ""tolerance"" - Obama only has tolerance for those he can steal from, and those whose loyalty he can buy with stolen loot.

RTT2:  Opponents of Obama are not just called ""conservatives"" (which is largely a meaningless term) - they include classical liberals / libertarians, pro-capitalists / pro-natalists, constitutionalists, and (given Obama's ""far-left"" rankings on many objective political benchmarks) centrists as well.  You are addicted to throwing the word ""racism"" around, but in reality like 99% of the racism that exists in USA today is the political racism of people like you.  Identifications of Obama as relatively socialist and criticism of the politically-motivated AGW hysteria are rooted not in ""conspiracy theories"", but in rather solid facts.

I suggest you both spend more time reading books on all sides of the issues and developing your brain, and less time showing off your capacity to be mindless online puppets for the ruling elite."
,RTT2,2012-11-09T11:19Z,"I don't need a political lesson from someone who seriously thinks communism is a risk in America, but thanks anyway, Alex. I see you're another libertarian who is trying to cover their extremist beliefs by pretending to have support from classical liberals, centrists, etc, when in fact you're nowhere near those. You should read some books yourself, rather than waste time on your dysenteric posts. Classical liberalism was actually proto-socialism, very much concerned with welfare in C19 when libertarian business owners were ruling the day.  In fact the reason you're so obsessed with communism is because you NEED it - it's the only possible way people would, in sheer desperation, swing to the other extreme, libertarianism (over-regulation vs no regulation).

Oh and try to read the context of people's posts, and you might avoid generalized rhetoric that makes you look like a politician. Since I used it once, I'm hardly 'addicted' to using the word 'racism', clearly referring to the 4th comment above. Must have hit a nerve, eh?! That you think the 'hysteria' about AGW is supported by facts reveals your hand as an AGW denier, and indeed that you join the long line of libertarians in opposing vital issues that threaten our long-term future. And all because of an instinctive support for a business quite big enough to look after itself. If that isn't conservatism, I don't know what is. Ever heard the phrase 'speak truth to power'?

Have a think on that. No really, read and inwardly digest. I don't suppose you will though, you'll just react with rhetoric again. You represent a sad trend on the internet where people who are 'running before they can walk' think debate means using all the tricks and fallacies you can to 'win' (I recommend reading 'straight and crooked thinking' and looking up '38 tricks'), always having the last word, never conceding, and ultimately never learning. 

Perhaps the impending decline of the Tea Party will at least teach you something. I hope so."
,AlexLibman,2012-11-10T07:36Z,"You need to brush up on your remedial reading comprehension skills.  My usual habit of hyperlinking all complex concepts to encyclopedia articles (and other RTFM materials) don't work well in this silly little comments section - you'll just have to learn to use Google and Wikipedia like a big boy...

I never said ""communism is a risk in America""; I was very specific in talking about the objective benchmarks (ex. economic freedom, international competitiveness) according to which USA is sliding in the more socialist direction.  (Whether a particular flavor of socialism is subjectively called ""communism"", ""fascism"", ""theocracy"", ""social democracy"", etc is irrelevant.)

My beliefs are gradualist, not extremist.  I am somewhat of a pariah among extremist libertarians because of this.  In another reading comprehension failure, you've missed that I was talking about ""opponents of Obama"", not libertarians.  ""Libertarian business owners"" never ""ruled the day"" - libertarianism (in USA'ian sense of the word) is a futurist vision that is pretty much impossible prior to the 21st century.  I am not ""obsessed with Communism"", I am obsessed with loss of economic freedom.

Your AGW religion is debunked in great depth elsewhere - please open your mind and read.  And AGW has nothing to do with ""long term future"" - by the end of this century humanity's contribution to this planet's CO2 production will fall from 4%, where it stands today, to 0%, as cleaner sources of energy become viable, and eventually all mining and manufacturing is exported to space.  AGW is a short-term political propaganda campaign backed by faulty data analysis - as explained elsewhere.  In a few years it will be swept under the rug, along with hundreds of similar environmentalist hysterias that were proven to be bunk.

""Conservatism"", since you don't seem to know, is skepticism about new and (allegedly) unproven ideas.  It can mean very different things depending on context.  In early 20th century China, conservatism meant opposition to Western learning.  In modern Russia, it means holding on to Communist traditions and opposing the resurgence of the Orthodox church.  In some European countries, it means monarchy and the state church.  And in the USA it means limiting the size and power of the Federal government, as defined in the Constitution.

Unlike yourself, I always use my real name on the Internet (even when ""it isn't safe""), and everything I ever wrote is a matter of public record.  In my history you will find many examples of learning and admitting past mistakes, and ""speaking truth to power"" happens to be my specialty...

I've supported Ron Paul in 2008, and some may argue that that campaign was the genesis of the ""Tea Party"", but I never supported that vague and easily-hijacked movement.  I stand alone."

You have even less idea of economics than I thought. Conservativism (which 2 posts ago was 'meaningless') is instinctive opposition to the new, with no reason required. It may be right or wrong, but the point is that the conservative usually doesn't know (or care). 

And you don't know. You know nothing about the science of AGW, nothing about (and have no respect for) the scientific method, nothing about peer-review (and why it works), and nothing even about basic logic and fallacies (I repeat - read those '38 tricks'), or you wouldn't fall for this ludicrous conspiracy theory.

It's nice to hear you're a 'moderate libertarian' (if that's saying much), but if you were truly independently minded the very first thing to go would be what Clarke called 'pig-headed 'scepticism'' (over AGW), as opposed to the reasoned kind, which is the true sense of the shamefully misused word scepticism. If you were to bravely step outside of the denialosphere, where your hand is permanently held as you pick your way along the cherry orchard, you would see this.

Your last post has noticeably less generalized rhetoric and more specific qualification - this is good. You are obviously using your last card, please remember to do this in future, as it will save everyone a lot of time. I have to warn you about 'hypertexting' though, which is often just reflexively googling for an interpretation you want to find, from the worst sources - this is NOT research.

It's nice to see that 'American libertarianism' is distancing itself from it's shameful heritage (understandably), and is located safely in the future (where no doubt other unfortunate, scientifically illiterate mistakes - sorry, sound rational positions - like both smoking/cancer and AGW denialism, will be forgotten too), but isn't this called 'deferring reality'...?

It's lovely to know who you are btw, Alex, but I judge people on their arguments, not whether I can poke/meet/stare at pics/google for dirt on them. Thanks for suggesting I have something to hide (a common tactic amongst denialists), but since I'm not a self-obsessed blogger or card-carrying commie (only a very occasional scientific poster), it would be even more meaningless. Besides, I know what denialists do with professionals' e-mail addresses (ask a climate scientist), and I've annoyed quite a few on forums...

See you in the future"
