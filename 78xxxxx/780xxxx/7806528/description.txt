Kanji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) is an atheist, who 
runs an antique shop. For him, God and        
religion are nothing more than a business     
proposition as he goes ahead making money     
by selling the faith of people for his profit 
His life suddenly is thrown off gear as       
an earthquake ironically destructs only       
his shop in the entire area. while his        
detractors blame it on his atheism that       
led to God's wrath, Kanji remains unperturbed 
and finds his victory with the insurance.     
They promptly reject the claim stating an     
earthquake to be an 'act of god' rather than  
a man-made phenomenon.Kanji takes GOD to      
court when his shop is destroyed by earthquake
