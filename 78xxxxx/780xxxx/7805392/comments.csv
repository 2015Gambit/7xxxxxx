Video quality changes very often: from clear and precise to blurry and extremely grainy. But the original bluray is like that, read the reviews. Really annoying and disappointing but there's nothing we can do about it."
,camaro1975,2012-11-09T20:21Z,"have been downloading for over 30 hours now and still am only 65% done, please people seed!!!!!!"
,camaro1975,2012-11-09T20:22Z,The piratebay should switch over to a ratio system where anyone with a seed ratio of .5 or lower should be banned!!!
,Malakore,2012-11-09T21:18Z,"camaro1975: I understand your frustration, but that would make torrent like this nearly impossible to get for people like me, who can download 900kB/s while average upload speed goes like 20-25 kB/s... Also, sometimes nobody downloads from me at all, I guess it's because their client detects faster and reliable sources, not sure.

My point is - not everyone can seed properly, really. I'm not going to let my computer run 24/7 just so I can download single movie. Well, maybe if you pay electricity bill for me."
,Revisionist,2012-11-10T18:07Z,"I give this a ""B"". Lots of little glithces thru out the film.  Audio/Video quality fine but the encode is only mediocre. "
,Heduxz,2012-11-11T13:09Z,Thank you
,FBInot,2012-11-13T02:52Z,"Ya know whats really annoying about these up/downloads ? It's you DICK wods that come here and cry about speed and the same want to comment on that speed. Your up/downloading a frigging movie and the comments SHOULD be limited to THAT movie and NOTHING else. If it's taking you three fcking days to download, then get a fcking connection with a fcking interent provider instead of fcking dial up and ds fcking L. Geeeezzzz, Now, to the purpose of the comment box, is this upload worth downloading or do we keep waiting until somebody gets a descent copy on here ?????????"
,JamJulLison,2012-11-14T14:27Z,"@FBInot
I partially agree with you.  Most comments should be kept on the quality of the torrent. That said, I understand the frustration of downloaders.  Like Malakore not everyone can seen properly and even some who do, don't always have a high enough upload limit.  Which really slows things down. I have had some torrents with barely any seeds and at least triple the leechers download faster then some torrents with high seeds and only double the leechers. I think the main issue is either people are trying to seed that shouldn't (poor net) or they just don't always set the upload limit high enough. "
