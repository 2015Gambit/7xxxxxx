This is everything you need to install IK Multimedia's Miroslav Philharmonik v1.1 with both sound dvds. Just follow the easy instructions on the folder! You will however need a program like PowerISO(my favorite) or MagicISO or something similar to install. Have fun, and happy producing!

PS. I do not take credit for creation of the keygen or cracking of this program, as listed in the readme this was provided by TEAM BEAT
