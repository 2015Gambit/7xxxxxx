,BUTT_SEX,2012-11-09T09:29Z,"I had already converted the scene's mp4/x264 into avi/xvid, but thanks for making xvid available so people actually have a choice on the file format. It doesn't make much sense to me when 3 or 4 different uploaders from the same exact group upload the SAME EXACT file. 

You would think it would make more sense for one to focus on a HD rip, one an avi/xvid rip, and then another x264 (which is less compatible than xvid with marginally better quality if compared to the same exact file size). "

Sigh ...

What ""they"" do and what I do are different. None of them are actual encoders.
They are a distribution network vying for who can be first.
They also each have their loyal followers.

While I have no problem with ANYONE spreading my stuff around, for the moment
I am the only one presenting my stuff. The bane of being the new guy.
Also wouldn't know a ""top site"" if it bit me. Used to hang when they were open IRC.
But they went all exclusive and clearly don't talk to outsiders.

There is one thing that fairly screams into the wind - trouble in paradise.

Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me there was a pretty even sharing of shows
among the various ""Scene"" release groups. But now a LARGE majority is only LOL.
It's like the move to MP4 has caused everyone else to do the bare minimum.
And LOL is left having to use his damaged equipment from his damaged feed
just to maintain ""market share"" or whatever you want to call it.

Sigh ...
