Super Mario Brothers X
is a massive Mario fan-game that blends elements from Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, 3, World and several other games, including custom elements that can be added using our graphics pack. It has many power-ups, such as the Ice Flower, Hammer Suit, Tanooki Suit, Kuribo's Shoe, the Billy Gun, and several types of Yoshis. You can also play the game with a friend in the 2-Player Co-op Mode, where the screen seamlessly splits and combines as the players separate and rejoin.

SMBX is most notable for its extensive Level Editor that allows you to create almost any kind of level you can imagine. The real-time editor allows you to edit the level while you are playing it! You can also create your own episode and upload it to http://smbx.mtsapd.com using either the SMB3 or SMW styled World Map, or you can create a Mario 64 Style Level Hub level and have the players collect stars to advance!

Some of the features include:

    There are five playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, and Link!
    There are over fifty cleverly designed levels in the default installed episode!
    Easy to use Level Editor with thousands of objects to choose from, as well as a graphics pack to add more!
    Both classic and new power-ups such as Yoshi and the Billy Gun!
    2-Player Co-Op with an intelligent camera that splits and combines!
    An intense 2-Player Battle Mode that will leave you coming back for more


"On April 17, 2011, Redigit (Andrew Spinks) commented on his YouTube page that he received a call from Nintendo's lawyers asking him to remove Super Mario Bros. X from SuperMarioBrothers.org and delete all SMBX videos from his Youtube account. They also asked him to transfer SuperMarioBrothers.org over to Nintendo.[citation needed] He complied with their first two wishes, but did not want to lose SuperMarioBrothers.org. He said, "It is a good Mario fansite, even without Super Mario Bros. X." Nintendo was going to decide on that and get back to him. Redigit has asked that no one post copies of Super Mario Bros. X on the internet, as it goes against Nintendo's wishes and might make things more complicated for him."

->Whoops! :P Thru my searches on this I found out 1.4 is a hoax, theres talk of a SMBX:R edition, its fake as well. Both were dropped projects and no ones got copies. Side note, this is probably the only direct download without some extra installer or downloader needed (ie cnet or whatever)
