,chop007,2012-11-12T15:49Z,"Rocking torrent bro, freakin perfect on my sgs2 and my sgs3, works awesome. I am getting worried man, this game is too addictive, especially when I have obsessive compulsive disorder, there is just too many possibilities to get the perfect launch and strike. Thanks for this bro."

,blmeeksrn,2012-11-18T02:50Z,Is there a code that I need to put in to unlock the paid version? I have it installed on my Samsung galaxy 2 android phone and it is not unlocked. It's trying to have me pay at the exact spots that it did when I installed the free version from the market.
