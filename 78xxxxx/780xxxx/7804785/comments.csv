,falafelface,2012-11-08T16:36Z,No wonder rightwingers are always being called stupid and ignorant
,bonzofan,2012-11-08T19:48Z,"Have to agree about the internet bill though.

@ steinmanj; Insults like that just make you sound more racist than the uploader. Relax, dude!"
,Korge,2012-11-08T20:09Z,"Well...having heard the comments from Palin et al you can wonder on which planet and in which time the US right is living. I just hope and wish for the US and the rest of the world that the democrats can do a good job and keep the world in good order.
When all those people which legal right to vote CAN actually vote...the democrates will win even more. We need a world which is full of compassion and intelligens...and that you'll never get with a republikan Pres.
Says a Swedish Moderat!!!"

Look at California, 40 years ago it was a vacation destination for millions, now reduced to a Broke Welfare State that resemblesďťż the third world. Even Liberal dumb shits need to understand what they cost in Welfare, Healthcare, Education, Housing, Crime, Rape & Murder. What could be more irrational than flooding our Country with illegals in a Failing Economy & handing out 1 million work permits for votes! "
,ercwynn,2012-11-10T17:00Z,"Irrational is thinking that a million illegals in California would have the ability to vote.  Plus the election was called for Obama, even by Fox News, hours before the poll results from California were counted,  California and Florida didn't matter in the overall election.  

Obama won because Mitt RMoney proved thru the whole year that he would run the government the same way he ran his campaign.  By ignoring reality and assuming that he was entitled to be President because he was born on third base.

,RTT2,2012-11-11T11:27Z,"Quite. And the Tea Party lost the election for the republicans, with attitudes like those at the top of the page, as well as crazy AGW denialism, which virtually no republican would come out and say is nonsense. And it was not long ago that the republican party was majority birther - that's some 360 to get into the real world! At least the republican party is now realizing this too, perhaps they may even be able to join the debate again in the future.

They really need to get rid of the Tea Party though. When I first suggested the above here, you wouldn't believe the reams of protesting, confused nonsense that came from their defenders. Not that they're worried, of course. Oh no..."
