,Feels_Good,2012-11-09T18:50Z,"Since this is for MAC OSX the only way to run it on a Windows OS would be to download a Mac Emulator... I did some research and it IS possible.

For those who can't wait for a SKIDROW release you can learn how to get an emulator here:

This is not some dumb survey or scam, i'm just being helpful. But for me, i'm just gunna be patient and wait for a PC fixed release.

,IIXVII,2012-11-12T04:39Z,"@rwdmac If you have access to a windows pc do what I did ,
1, Download extremezome's fm13 torrent .
2,Instal it in windows 
3,Copy the instal file onto a flash drive
4,go onto your Mac copy over the instal file into your applications 
5,do not crack it and play !! 
Simple as that .

@spst1981 On a windows PC you need a crack whether you convert the dmg to iso or not ! there is no working crack for this game yet .

To the rest, These links for "" working cracks and keygens "" are dodgy don't believe it !! There is no keygen or working crack fix available ."
