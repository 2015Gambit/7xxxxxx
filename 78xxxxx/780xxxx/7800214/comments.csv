I have confirmed it will play on iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad. It plays through iTunes and VLC Media Player, however i don't own an Apple-TV so yea guys it would be really helpfull if you could help me and as always happy pirating and enjoy the movie."
,woritstoh,2012-11-07T10:51Z,"Is that YOU tr108 ?

,thefan23,2012-11-08T05:40Z,"Yeap, Spiderman worked on ATV 1. I can try this movie and let you know soon."
,ScubaSteve5678,2012-11-09T00:39Z,"@hambosas 

Will you be uploading the movie Ted now that there is a bluray rip out "
,Hambosas,2012-11-09T03:00Z,I will once it is atleast on iTunes Pre-order because without it on iTunes I can't fully tag it.
,getswordfish,2012-11-09T13:14Z,"Hambosas, before tr108 went offline he wanted to do The Godfather films. Do you foresee doing those anytime soon? That would be awesome! Thanks for this btw!"
[T],dabadguy69,2012-11-09T16:15Z,Thank you for the awsome upload!
,Hambosas,2012-11-09T18:56Z,If it is a request then maybe
,Klazik666,2012-11-11T02:40Z,"Cool. Hope you can indulge me with 2 requests: Lawrence of Arabia and Sunset Blvd.

Particularly ""lawrence"", some rips are up to 16 GB (1080p) and 10 GB (720p). And maybe Criterion's ""In the mood for love"", and... Ok just the first 2 :D"
,getswordfish,2012-11-12T17:38Z,"@Hambosas: Yes, can you please do the Godfather trilogy? Thx!"
,Hambosas,2012-11-12T23:09Z,"I will do The Godfather trilogy but It will be a while because now that I am doing 1080p ups I'm getting all my movies ready. So far I'm doing Madagascar 3, Ice Age 4, Ted, Total Recall, and hopefully The Hunger Games."
,getswordfish,2012-11-14T11:08Z,"@Hambosas: Thanks! Looking forward to your future uploads. Also, if you want to save yourself some time, this uploader does only 1080p ups in iTunes format, one of which is The Hunger Games.

,getswordfish,2012-11-15T11:40Z,The Dark Knight Rises is out :D...1080p please?
,getswordfish,2012-11-15T11:45Z,The Dark Knight Rises leaked :D. 1080p please? Thanks!
,Hambosas,2012-11-15T21:42Z,Yea I'll TRY to do The Dark Knight Rises. It changes to 1920x1080 to 1920x800 at certain parts in the movie and i have had trouble with movies like that in the past but i'll try
,getswordfish,2012-11-16T14:21Z,I think 1080x800 is normal. @catskinsox rips only 1080p films and they yield the same resolution. Not sure whether he set them like that or they automatically came out as so. Just a thought. Hope it helps. Really looking forward to your rips! Any idea what's the ETA on new rips? Thanks dude!
,getswordfish,2012-11-19T17:14Z,"Hambosas, another possible reason why it changes at certain parts of the film is that TDKR was partly shot with IMAX cameras so the resolution changes. Let me know how you make out & good luck!"
,Hambosas,2012-11-19T23:04Z,"Sure I watched it, great movie. I'm working on Total Recall, Ted and Lawless right now so I should be up-ing those soon."
