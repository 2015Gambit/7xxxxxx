To my own surprise, I release a Luc Besson flick. I had a little forgotten about this one. Yet it's actually quite good science fiction and cinema, and great as a first movie. The comparison is quite adequate with Geoorge's Lucas' tragetorie : good, proper sci-fi as a first movie (THX 1138 for Lucas), then a massive space opera (The fifth element in the case of Besson); in both case hard to imagine how one moves from this to that.
This is another piece of the puzzle, here in blu-ray quality -and there's no HD version of this flick available to buy, so I guess that's the best version of the movie you can find.

As usual, I stand by my stance not to spoil anything, I'll just throw in a few words : post-apocalyptic, mute but not silent, brillant.

Short sample included.

VIDEO :
The source is Full HD DVB-T, also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted! Very few and almost unnoticable imperfections because of the reception (which was close to perfect), they should not be a concern.
