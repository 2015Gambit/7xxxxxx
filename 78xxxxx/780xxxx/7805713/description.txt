In Search of Mozart (BSkyB)

Arts Documentary hosted by Juliet Stevenson, published by BSkyB in 2006 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Made to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth, In Search Of Mozart is a detective story that takes us to the heart of genius.

Produced with the world's leading orchestras and musicians, the prolific composer's story is told through a 25,000 mile journey along every route Mozart followed.

In Search of Mozart traces his life through his music and extensive correspondence. From K1a to K626 (Requiem), over 80 works are featured, revealing striking parallels between the music and Mozart's own experiences.

But it is the music that takes centre stage, with the jigsaw of Mozart's life fitting snugly around it. With rigorous analysis from musicologists and experts such as Jonathan Miller, Cliff Eisen, Nicholas Till, Bayan Northcott and the late Stanley Sadie, a new, vivid impression of the composer emerges. It dispels the many common myths about Mozart's genius, health, relationships, death and character, to present a new image, very different from Milos Forman's Amadeus.

Narrated by Juliet Stevenson and with Mozart voiced by Samuel West, the series features interviews and performances with over 70 of the greatest exponents of Mozart's music including.
