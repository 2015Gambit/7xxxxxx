Again, only mentioned in case you care about such things (I do, annoyingly).

Thanks again for all your efforts.  Haven't yet read this Clowes fellow, but looking forward to it."

Yeah, I should always double check the actual books I'm uploading for that information, but truthfully, I don't. I often go by what Amazon, Wikipedia or the comicbookdb tells me, because it's quicker to work from websites than to constantly be opening all the cbr/cbz files. Amazon says 2002 on this one, so we'll blame them. "
