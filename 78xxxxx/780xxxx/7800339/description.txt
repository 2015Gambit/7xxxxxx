'Like A Velvet Glove Cast In Iron'
Fantagraphics Books, 1998, 142 pages
'Like a Velvet Glove' collects all 10 chapters of the serialized story from Eightball. As Clay Loudermilk attempts to unravel the mysteries behind a snuff film, he finds himself involved with an increasingly bizarre cast of characters, including a pair of sadistic cops who carve a strange symbol into the heel of Clay's foot; a horny over-the-hill suburban woman whose sexual encounter with a mysterious water creature produced a grotesquely misshapen, but no less horny, mutant daughter; a dog with no orifices whatsoever (it has to be fed by injection); two ominous victims of extremely bad hair implants; a charismatic Manson-like cult leader who plans to kidnap a famous advice columnist and many more!


'Ghost World'
Fantagraphics Books, 1998
Ghost World has become a cultural and generational touchstone, and continues to enthrall and inspire readers over a decade after its original release as a graphic novel. Originally serialized in the pages of the seminal comic book Eightball throughout the mid-1990s, this quasi-autobiographical story (the name of one of the protagonists is famously an anagram of the author's name) follows the adventures of two teenage girls, Enid and Becky; best friends facing the prospect of growing up, and more importantly, apart.

'Pussey'
Fantagraphics Books, 2006, 64 pages
A vicious satire of pop culture and the commerce of art. This hilarious classic from Dan Clowes is a brutal and scathing peek into the insular, pathetic world of the comic book industry, as seen through the eyes of antihero Dan Pussey (pronounced "Pooh-say"), creator of the smash superhero comic "Nauseator." From cradle to grave, Clowes presents the complete saga of Young Dan Pussey, mercilessly skewering the business and medium of comics, bouncing from art to commerce to culture high and low. Through it all, Pussey dreams endlessly about having sex with a woman, but even those fantasies degenerate into superhero scenarios. 

'Wilson'
Drawn and Quarterly, 2010, 80 pages
Meet Wilson, an opinionated middle-aged loner who loves his dog and quite possibly no one else. In an ongoing quest to find human connection, he badgers friend and stranger alike into a series of one-sided conversations, punctuating his own lofty discussions with a brutally honest, self-negating sense of humor. After his father dies, Wilson, now irrevocably alone, sets out to find his ex-wife with the hope of rekindling their long-dead relationship, and discovers he has a teenage daughter, born after the marriage ended and given up for adoption.Wilson eventually forces all three to reconnect as a familyΓÇöa doomed mission that will surely, inevitably backfire. 

'Mister Wonderful: A Love Story'
Pantheon, 2011, 80 pages
Meet Marshall. Sitting alone in the local coffee place. HeΓÇÖs been set up by his friend Tim on a blind date with someone named Natalie, and now heΓÇÖs just feeling set up. Natalie is late, but turns up eventually. During the extremely long night that follows, Marshall and Natalie are emotionally tested in ways that two people who just met really should not be. Not, at least, if they want the prospect of a second date. A captivating, bittersweet, and hilarious look at the potential for human connection in an increasingly hopeless world.

'David Boring'
Pantheon, 2002, 136 pages
Meet David Boring: a nineteen-year-old security guard with a tortured inner life and an obsessive nature. When he meets the girl of his dreams, things begin to go awry: what seems too good to be true apparently is. And what seems truest in Boring's life is that, given the right set of circumstances (in this case, an orgiastic cascade of vengeance, humiliation and murder) the primal nature of humankind will come inexorably to the fore.


'Ice Haven'
Pantheon, 2011, 88 pages
Welcome to Ice Haven! ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs not as cold here as it sounds,ΓÇ¥ declares Random Wilder, our reluctant guide to this sleepy Midwestern town. HeΓÇÖs also its would-be poet laureate. Would-be, that is, were it not for the ΓÇ£florid banalitiesΓÇ¥ of his arch rival, Ida Wentz, pub┬¡lished ad nauseam in the Ice Haven Daily Progress. Among Wilder's other fellow Ice Havians are the love┬¡lorn Violet Vanderplazt and Vida Wentz; the adorable interracial moppets Carmichael and Paula; the Blue Bunny, newly sprung from prison and the bitterest rabbit in town; and poor little David Goldberg, miss┬¡ing for more than a week now...
