Based on the international best-selling novel by Fergus Hume,
The Mystery of a Hansom Cab is now a stunning new telemovie with twists
and turns to the very end. Melbourne, 1886. Two gentlemen climb into a
hansom cab late one murky night. One man climbs out, the other travels
on to St Kilda. On arrival, the driver finds the second man dead; murdered.
The high-society killing sends shockwaves through the young city, still flush
from its gold-rush boom. The victim, Oliver Whyte (Brett Climo), fresh from
England with glowing letters of introduction, had endeared himself to one of
the wealthiest men in the colony, Mark Frettlby (John Waters). It is Marks
21-year-old daughter, Madge Frettlby (Jessica De Gouw), who Whyte instantly
sets his sights on, but Madge is already in love with Brian Fitzgerald
(Oliver Ackland), a sensitive, hard-working Irishman.
