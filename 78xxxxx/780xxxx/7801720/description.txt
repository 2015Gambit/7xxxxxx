30 years ago, unidentified creatures appeared out of nowhere and began to cause havoc on Earth. That's why people named them Troubles. 
Luckily for us after they came, children with supernatural powers were born. Let's call them Traces. The Traces were the only ones who could fight against the invaders. It's a shame but most of them were considered as freaks.

Our young hero, Sa Ghang Gwon, is one of them. He tries his best to hide his abilities and to blend in society as a normal being. The plot also involves another man. Kim Yun Seong, who acquired his abilities in his early 30's, is a wanted criminal.
