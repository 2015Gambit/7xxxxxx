His life was the subject of the 2009 documentary film Still Bill.

I can not say enough good things about this man. I am more of a recent listener to Bill Withers music. I have heard it for some years on movie tracks, commercials, hearing other artists cover his songs, but I never actually equated him with the songs I was hearing. I managed to get a hold of just about every album he has created and am loving it. His style to me has a sort of Country and Western style to it MINUS the country TWANG...I think it is something to do with his delivery and the theme of his songs. 

I hope you Bill Withers fans love it as well. As usual seed as long as possible and more importantly enjoy
