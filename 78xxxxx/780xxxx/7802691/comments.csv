,Atlantan,2012-11-07T22:21Z,"Indeed. However, it IS difficult to oust an incumbent, especially a 'historic' one, and with media obscuring what he's done, and never holding him accountable. The REAL painful turning point I thought was when Elizabeth Warren won! SO clearly a flawed candidate, and the person behind 'you didn't build that', while utilizing affirmative action for her own ends! Maybe because Brown wasn't all that conservative; but he was the incumbent. I don't get it."
