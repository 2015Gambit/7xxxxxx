,ruppert10,2012-11-09T20:07Z,hi slick there is a problem with the activation when you try to activate it  the program says number of activations using this activation code has been exceeded any idea how else to activate this ????? do i un then reinstall it i use revo uninstaller to make sure there is no old info in my reg then i always restart the pc then install it but is there a chance that the serial is just used to much like it said ???? any help on this will be great thanks for all that you do for us with these great torrent programs really thank you

,ruppert10,2012-11-10T21:14Z,hi slick i downloaded a older copy that you had on here i just went right over the other copy put in the serial key it registered fine then i just reinstalled the new copy and ta da its all working now i guess once in a while taking everything out of a reg for a uninstall of a program is not always the right move it messes up the reg key for the new updates im just posting this in case anyone else out there has the same issue i hope it helps them thanks again slick

1.first find and download an older version. (I dl'd Boilsoft Video Joiner v6.57.17 with Key from here)
2.Install it and use the serial. (it should work and register)
3.Now download the latest version (you can do this from Boilsoft site or use this one 7.01.2)
4. Finally Install the new one over the old (don't uninstall the first one)

It will update the old one to the new version that has already been registered.. worked for me"
