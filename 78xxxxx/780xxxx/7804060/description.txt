This is Golden Cube, a timed, 3D match the shapes puzzle game. This was uploaded earlier on by a first time uploader, but the torrent went 404, not sure why, but the uploader made a rar file of an exe which was the same size extracted, that's usually sus, so MODs pulled it, which is fair enough for saftey sake. I installed it using Comodos sandbox to be safe, & scanned the installed folder, the game is clean, since the original torrent is dead, and it's a good puzzle game, I re-uploaded this for you guys.


I have made a new installer for this game since not everybody uses sandbox to install.
Just run the installer, then use the shortcut to start the game.

FYI: This game is timed, and gets hard, if you have a short fuse, this might not be fun a game for you.
