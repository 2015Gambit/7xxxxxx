,iryhousen,2012-11-08T00:13Z,"This uploader has a couple of pages of torrents, going back to June.  

The show was on last night in the UK.  I've been waiting for GaryBradbury to do it. "
,billiejean12,2012-11-08T00:32Z,"Yea agreed with iryhousen, he has other torrents like the soup that have got reviews, so im pretty sure it's legit."
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-08T02:37Z,"It's an .mp4 file even if you download it the worst you can do is it being the wrong ep, downloading now, I'll comment back on quality and if it's the right episode."
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-08T02:44Z,"Good seeders, fast download, legit first episode of season 4.

Quality;

V: Pretty good definitely watchable
A: Pretty awful but it gets the job done

Thanks locks04 for the upload :)"
,iryhousen,2012-11-08T03:00Z,It works
,Aaronza,2012-11-08T03:31Z,"the size reflects the quality, past geordie eps are normally ~350.

I would rate quality just above a cam, V is alright but A is pretty bad.."
,locks04,2012-11-08T06:14Z,yea and i didnt cap it i just seen it wasnt uploaded so i shared what i had 
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-08T08:59Z,"Decided to upload my own, with much better quality, ripped from the mtv website, here:

But thank you locks04 for the upload :)"
,locks04,2012-11-09T19:41Z,its cool u couldve just uploaded it instead of trolling my torrent if they wanted it in better quality they wouldve seen it and downloaded it pretty sure everone has moved on 
,maccabajani1995,2012-11-14T06:05Z,@locks04 - episode 2??
,IKnowWhatImHereFor,2012-11-14T07:49Z,"@locks04 - 1. Kind of hard to tell the quality without downloading mate, most people go for the one with the most seeders...
2. Trolling? Learn what it means first then use it

@maccabajani1995: Right here,

,locks04,2012-11-15T06:44Z,there are no screens on just about anything on this site so what u are saying about quality is irrelevant and like i said before u are trolling
