Obama - What Happened To Hope?
5th November 2012
BBC HD

Andrew Marr looks back at Barack ObamaΓÇÖs first
term in office.

When Obama stood before a crowd of nearly two
million people, preparing to take the oath of
office, it was a moment that many never believed
they would see: the inauguration of a black 
American president.

Now, through informal and candid interviews with
some of ObamaΓÇÖs own White House staff and those
who have worked closely with him, Andrew Marr
assesses how far this presidency has lived up to
the huge expectations.
