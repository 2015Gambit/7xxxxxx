In 2009 a live-action television series based on the books by Terry Deary was made by Lion Television and shown on BBC One and CBBC in the United Kingdom. The production of the television series followed a relaunch of Deary's books, Horrible Histories would be "stuffed full of blood, battles and black humour ΓÇô and will also give children some of the great facts and narratives of history. and it is also a very funny show for adults although they probably will not admit to watching it, i do and that is why i bought the dvds and i am 66 years young and love it.....ENJOY everyone no matter how old
