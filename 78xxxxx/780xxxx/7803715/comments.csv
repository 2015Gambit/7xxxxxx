I'll be waiting for those games then.

I'm from Chile and I'm trying to find NTSC or PAL games in spanish. Specially FIFA's. I have like 10 FIFA's from PS2 xD. FIFA 06, WORLD CUP 2006 and UEFA saga are the only ones that I need to collect them all. So you are my only hope 'cause I can't fin them :(

Grettings man, and ...Thank you again so much ;)"
