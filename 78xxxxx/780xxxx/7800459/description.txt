Pip thought he had it all, a pampered lifestyle,
huge mansion and adoring owners, that is until
the Taylor family booked an African safari.
Pip finds himself separated from his clan,
which forces him to reluctantly adapt to a new
way of life in the jungle. As he bridges the
divide between feuding wildlife he learns that
caviar and manicures can never bring the same
happiness as friendship.
