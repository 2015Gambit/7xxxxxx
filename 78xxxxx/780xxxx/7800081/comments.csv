,mrstars,2012-11-07T04:26Z,Usually happens when tv show aint going that well and they try to move it to a diffrent time and day to lower the competition with other shows.. hard

You really have no clue what you are talking about!  This show hasn't changed it's date and time!  It airs Wednesday at 8 p.m. on the CW here in the states!  The ratings aren't dropping either for this show because it's giving the CW it's highest ratings in almost 3 years!  

There is some other reason why this is being posted a day early!  I won't complain.  Just the opposite!  Greatly appreciated for this early post!!!"
