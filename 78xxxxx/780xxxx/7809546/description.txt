Saroj lives a poor lifestyle in Nagpur along with her widowed mom, Leela, and a younger sister, Nanhi. She gets employed as a singer/dancer in Bombay and relocates there. Once there, she meets with Ajit, and the couple fall in love. Circumstances compel her to re-locate to Nagpur and seek employment with another dance/drama company run by Chunilal. Ajit decides to follow her to Nagpur, and visits her mom and sister. It is from here he locates the dance/drama company and does meet Saroj - only to find out that she has changed her name to Mary D'Souza. Ajit will eventually discover that Saroj had witnessed the murder of Chunilal and the killer(s) are now out to silence her - and whoever else dares to come in their way.

This movie has all melodious numbers as listed in the above poster.
But my all-time fav one is : Balmaa Maane Naa sung by Lata Didi.
