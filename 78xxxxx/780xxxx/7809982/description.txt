Plot..........: Sarah Sparks is pregnant and feeling wholly ambivalent, despite 
her boyfriend's pure enthusiasm. A committed tech-geek, she fears she is more 
interested in ultrasound technology than in what's being ultra-sounded. When 
her sister lures her to L.A. for what ends up being a terrorizing baby shower, 
Sarah keeps her rental van and hits the road in search of the source of her 
anxiety: her estranged mother, now living off the grid. SMALL, BEAUTIFULLY MOVING PARTS takes a comic and poignant look at one woman's coming-of-parenthood in the age of technology.
