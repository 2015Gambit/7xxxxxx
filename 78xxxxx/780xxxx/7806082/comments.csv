,ScottyD7421,2012-11-09T11:59Z,"Many thanks as always MM82 :-)

Does anyone have an opinion on what device to read these comics on e.g. e-reader or is it better to simply read from the PC?

Appreciate any input.

Cheers :-)"

,hrmschach,2012-11-09T22:45Z,@ScottyD7241: i'd recommend a 10 inch tablet with a decent screen. i recently bought a used first-gen motorola xoom to read my comics on and its totally awesome.
