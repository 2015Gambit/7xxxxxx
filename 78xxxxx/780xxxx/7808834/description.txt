This 1968 album (by then very popular singer and keyboard player) is without doubt one of the best US record debuts of the late 60's! In contrast to the later Lee Michaels' recordings the Carnival Of Life LP is simply a full-blown psychedelic (pop) rock based on heavy Hammond organ sounds; massively charming harpsichord notes; fuzz-laden guitar parts (by the Euphoria member); very solid and busy drumming (by Eddie Hoh); catchy, Beatles-like melodies; memorable hooks and (last but not least) very clear baroque-pop influences. This awesome record is absolutely recommended - even in a first glance an average cover might discourage some listeners... The sound of that remastered CD is just gorgeous - much better and cleaner than previous, very noisy and muddy editon.
