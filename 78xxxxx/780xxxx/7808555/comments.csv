,fsxking08,2012-11-09T23:43Z,"Guys, this works 100%, BUT DO NOT RUN THOSE INSTALLER THINGS THAT ARE INSIDE THE B200 FOLDER THAT ARE IN YOUR FSX AIRCRAFT FOLDER, DO NOT!!!!! if you do, the aircraft will be messed up, I did it to see waht they did, and it got messed up, so I had to uninstall and reinstall, just a warning, DO NOT run those, my guess would be they are anti piracy things"
,phantom13666,2012-11-10T00:48Z,"fsxking, those are for RealityXP integration, and should be left alone unless you use RXP. If you ran the ""RXP530"" exe, simply executing the ""CAR530"" should fix the issue. It just swaps out the GPS."
,N109GE,2012-11-10T01:05Z,"Putzfrau,

Happy Birthday...Enjoy, many, many more.  Now back to business (lol), thank you for cracking the original EXE file..  :)

Namco-nexgen, thank you for EVERYTHING that you have done also to make the B200 come to life..  ::)

,mathjkt,2012-11-10T15:09Z,Can we get the SP1 please?
,putzfrau,2012-11-10T17:37Z,"Hi guys and thx everyone.For those who asked about sp1, i don't have it, neither i have the installer dated after 5.11 which contains also sp1.
If someone will provide me with one, i will 'fix' it.
On the other hand,since i like this plane very much,
i made a torrent with the docs i have for the Aeroworx B200 for FS2004,which contains a better manual and two tutorial flights very well made.Have a look and i'm sure you will like it.

,Raptor05121,2012-11-12T14:43Z,"putz,

if i gave you the .exe to the CT182T, could you get it working?"
,putzfrau,2012-11-12T15:49Z,"sure,but that file is already in the wild somewhere,cracked!"
,W_B_Pilot,2012-11-12T17:38Z,"Okay, stupid question time...How do you open the readme file? tried changing the extension to an .exe but that just caused an error. It may be that I'm highly intoxicated at the moment also. Any help is appreciated."
,fsxking08,2012-11-13T01:53Z,"to open the readme, just make it a text file by adding .text or .txt to the end"
,Taco92,2012-11-16T07:17Z,"Don't change the readme file extension to .txt as it will corrupt the torrent. Open it and select ""choose a program from the list"", then select notepad."
,Ibluesky,2012-11-16T10:42Z,req:Sp1 of B200!!!!!!!
,Raptor05121,2012-11-19T06:36Z,"working great
