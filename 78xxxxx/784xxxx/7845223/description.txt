ABOUT US / NEWS

► We are just  another small non-scene group who  started in
2007. Since then we became a bit more skilled, now we have
done over 3000 quality  releases, and we hope to bring you
more of them.

► We are seeking for new talents:

- Coders          ► If you have any good experience and want
- Crackers          to join us - read  CONTACT  section  for
- GFX artists       details.
- Suppliers
- Others?         ► There will be requirements.
And there will be cookies as well. :)

NOTES

► Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
something  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security
software. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too
smart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are
not responsible for modified releases.

► We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
people and always  indicate  original authors of releases.
We have permissions to use their files.

► We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always
remember to support the developers if you like the product
and its quality.
