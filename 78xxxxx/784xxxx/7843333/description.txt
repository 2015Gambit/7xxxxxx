This is the last of 0.7.2.
FreeNAS 0.7.2.6694 both i386 and x64 version, both iso and embedded .img

But for old PCs, like s478, I think the 0.7.1 is still best fit. This one and the NAS4free can't regulate 1,7GHz Celerons speed and give full console of errors. I will not upgrade my old servers, but use this for 2 new ones. Also not sure what to use for printing support, LPRng or p910nd...
