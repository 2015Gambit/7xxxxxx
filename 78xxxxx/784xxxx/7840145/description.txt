C++ is a general purpose programming language that is used by millions of developers. It offers a powerful combination of performance and abstraction that other languages donΓÇÖt have. You can use C++ to write different kinds of applications for a variety of platforms. In this course, IΓÇÖll cover basics of language syntax ΓÇô declaring variables, classes, building expressions using operators and functions ΓÇô and work up to templates, pointers, const, and polymorphism. IΓÇÖll be using the principles of ΓÇ£modern C++ΓÇ¥ as much as possible, relying on the Standard Library and using idioms like Resource Acquisition is Initialization to reduce the effort involved in memory management. Some people are scared of C++, but IΓÇÖll show you how to approach the language without fear.
