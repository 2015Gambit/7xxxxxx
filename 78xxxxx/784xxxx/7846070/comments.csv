Ok, what the hell is happening to Jax? He's lost it! First couple of seasons he killed maybe 2 or 3 guys total and it was real hard for him. Now he's killing like 2 or 3 guys a week and loving it. Love this show though!"
,funseeker521,2012-11-25T04:58Z,"The problem isn't because of the number of seeders dumbass, it's your settings on your torrent client and your ISP and whoever else is on your IP."
