,Rocshi,2012-11-23T00:15Z,"Alright, I can't.
When I started it before this update, it would just redirect me to the Steam page for Torchlight II. After this update, it says it's missing a part of CEPUIbase.dll, which wasn't updated in this update. Dafuq do?"
,Rocshi,2012-11-23T00:56Z,"Fixed that, but now it just the cursor just shows it's loading for a bit and then nothing happens. Doesn't run any processes either."
