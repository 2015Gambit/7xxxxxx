Match of the Day Two 18.11.2012

Duration: 50 Min

Colin Murray and guests introduce highlights of the Premier League clash between Fulham and Sunderland at Craven Cottage.

Martin Jol's Fulham side made an excellent start to the season at home, keeping clean sheets in three out of their first four matches at Craven Cottage.

Sunderland have found goals hard to come by and have relied heavily on record signing Steven Fletcher to find the back of the net.

Craven Cottage is not a ground the Black Cats have enjoyed playing at in the Premier League, having managed a solitary victory in eight visits to west London.

There is also a chance to catch up with the goals and talking points from all of Saturday's games.
