,sadguy101,2012-11-23T00:42Z,"First time I've ever posted, been using this site for years seed usually at 500% cmon people I'd really like to get this and it's downloading at 22kb/s "
,snake290,2012-11-24T16:50Z,"I have downloaded the game 2 times, and every time the norton internet security blocks the ""Setup.exe"" as a dangerous virus/trojan. I don't care if it's a false alarm ... I will never let a blocked file again, cause the last time I did that (again with a PC game, again a setup.exe file ... F1 Race Stars - FLT), I got a really nasty trojan which made me format it few minutes later (it couldn't be removed).
Are you experiencing something similar or is it just me? I know Mr. Stifmeister is a good reliable uploader and that groups like Skidrow or FLT release virus free files."
,educatedtim,2012-11-25T02:19Z,Can anyone please confirm if LAN Coop works
,Raazer,2012-11-25T16:09Z,"I run the game. The sound works, but the video not. Help me please!"

1. Unpack the release
2. Mount or burn image
3. Install
4. ""Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder into the game installation""                              How do i do this? also, when i downloaded it, it was already unpacked, And when i try to launch the icon for the gome on my desktop, it says ""Steam must be running in order to launch this game"""
