John Lee Hooker - Don't Turn Me from Your Door: John Lee Hooker Sings His Blues [1963]

1992 - ATCO Records, Atlantic Recordings / 7567-82365-2 YG / Remastered / CD

    This set of 1953 sessions consists of lesser-known John Lee Hooker material, but it's none the worse for that; Don't Turn Me from Your Door[/b] is as fine an indication as any (as if any were needed) that Hooker is one of the greats. For the most part, it's just the man and his guitar, but really, no more is needed; between his solid feel for rhythm, his clear, expressive guitar work, and his more-than-serviceable vocals, Hooker doesn't need any help. He's a master of setting a mood, whether it's the intimacy of "Stuttering Blues," the sweetness of "Wobbling Baby," or the lamentation of "My Baby Don't Love Me," and he's so subtle that most of the time you don't even notice him doing it. Okay, so "Boogie Chillen" isn't on this album. Doesn't matter.
