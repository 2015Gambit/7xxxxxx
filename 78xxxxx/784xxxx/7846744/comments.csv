,eddshomie,2012-11-21T13:47Z,"It works ,languages are English,German,and Russian"
,WthnMyslf,2012-11-21T14:30Z,"Yep, it works fantastic...although the installer puts an icon for something called Cat A Cat Games on the desktop..game works great though and is very very fun....no crack needed...just install with setup and play away"
,mrblaze94,2012-11-21T14:31Z,been waiting for this. Thank you! hope it works on my pc^^
,WthnMyslf,2012-11-21T14:32Z,"I did have to ""run as administrator""   just to let you guys know"
,N1kky98,2012-11-21T15:31Z,"Please, Please, Please SEED because the download is like 0.2 kbps and I want the game badly! I come home from school and keep searching on ways to download it and I finally found one but its really slow please seed!!"

THANKS"
,N1kky98,2012-11-21T16:06Z,Thanks for the seed!! Now it's like 300 kbps!! Thats my regular internet speed!! 
,Gomen,2012-11-21T16:30Z,"Can't launch the game, it says d3dx9_43.dll file is missing."
,Gomen,2012-11-21T16:44Z,"Nevermind, worked after I upgraded DirectX from the install files provided in the folder named Redist.
Like WthnlMyslf said it runs only in Administrator mode, but other than that everything is fine."
,agentscarn,2012-11-21T18:27Z,Thanks for the up! Been looking forward to this one. Downloading now. 
,agentscarn,2012-11-21T20:56Z,Make sure to run the shortcut as admin. Works perfectly on windows 8 64 bit
,Kaltikutt,2012-11-21T21:06Z,Seed please!!!
,N1kky98,2012-11-21T21:36Z,"@agentscarn How did you run Scribblenauts Unlimited on windows 8? What are your specs? Mine just keeps on telling me there is a unhandled exception has occurred... Please help, Tried every thing I could find. I'm running windows 8 32 bit. Any help would be appreciated! Thank you!!"
,N1kky98,2012-11-21T21:38Z,"Help I'm on windows 8 and it says ""unhandled exception occurred"" Any help would be appreciated!

,perfniall,2012-11-21T22:02Z,"@N1kky98 http://steamcommunity.com/app/218680/discussions/0/882966056564111468/#p1 the same thing is happening to me, i searched it up and this came up.  they're working on fixing it apparently x"
,RiionYoarashi,2012-11-21T22:43Z,@perfniall  Yeah I heard about that but will the game run after they fix it on steam? I feel that after they fix it I have to install another Scribblenauts Unlimited
,agentscarn,2012-11-21T23:27Z,"@N1kky98 I ran the setup.exe as an admin, and in order for the game to open I run the shortcut created by the installer as an admin as well and it runs without error.

My specs: 
Windows 8 64 bit
AMD Phenom II X4 965 @ 3.4 GHz
4 GB DDR5 RAM 
Radeon HD 6650 1 GB"
,Meromann,2012-11-22T00:08Z,"I'm having an issue with the installer, i'm running it as admin, it installs up to 943MB and then starts uninstalling, after that i get error code -5, which says there wasn't enough memory to unpack the .bin, even though i have a lot of free space. I tried relocating the installer and installation folders, but it's a no go, any help?"
,Meromann,2012-11-22T00:20Z,"I ran the installer as admin, it installed up to 943 MB and then started uninstalling; after tar i got error code -5, which said i don't have enough memory to extract the .bin files, but i have lots of free space. I tried relocating the installer and installation files, but nothing changed."
,perfniall,2012-11-22T00:35Z,@agentscarn I did that and i still get an error! :(
,marvey,2012-11-22T00:36Z,"when i run as administrator, it has a blank and black screen? Windows VISTA. how do I fix it?"
,marvey,2012-11-22T00:42Z,"When I run as administrator, it shows a black screen. I use windows VISTA. How can I fix it?"
,snake0463,2012-11-22T02:10Z,"This game will not work for some until the devs release a patch. You will get an error. I got the same thing, apparently the patch is supposed to be out in a week or so. Download, then wait for the patch. That's what I'm doing anyway."
,Gomen,2012-11-22T04:32Z,"Don't know why it lags so much on 7 though, there are no complex 3D environments to render. My hardware isn't badly outdated and the game runs at full speed only with minimal resolution."
,agentscarn,2012-11-22T05:17Z,@perfniall Maybe try Skidrow's release until a patch is released? D: idky i'm not having issues like you guys. 
,RedDire,2012-11-22T05:20Z,I can't even understand the notepad it's in a weird language. Don't download.
,perfniall,2012-11-22T05:53Z,@agentscarn i've already tried it and Norton says theres a virus and won't let me run the setup! i'll just have to patiently wait for the patch :( sigh. thanks anyways! x
,N1kky98,2012-11-22T09:39Z,"Thank you all for your help. BTW I read the forums posted by the dev and realized I'm not the only one. @agentscarn I did run the program as admin and also ran the installer by admin... The dev says its a problem with integrated graphics card, as you have a Radeon, which is not integrated.... If the patch is only on steam then  can you all do me a favour, and upload Scribblenauts Unlimited with the fix to piratebay!! Thank you all!!"
,Kennuckle,2012-11-22T18:17Z,"My characters are transparent. Need a fix, I would greatly appreciate it!"
