The Who's Quadrophenia & More Tour

November 1st, 2012 in Sunrise, FL at the grand opening of the BB&T Center.

The sound quality is good, but not great. It is not a "professional" bootleg, although once the music gets going, the quality shouldn't be a problem. All tracks are seamlessly woven together. Nothing has been omitted.
