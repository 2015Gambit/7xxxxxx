Nancy Sinatra couldn't act, and sing, more or less, if it wasn't for dad helping... I remember watching as a kid her film Get yourself a college girl, what a riot, SO STUPID that it was funny to watch her wooden 'acting'.... 

This said, I JUST LOVE THIS SONG !!!!  Thanks.

I always thought of her as being anachronistic - like a female Kennedy - what the male(s) of the family do makes their existence something of a farce. Are they to be dominate as the family dictates or submissive as females are treated by the family males?

I also like her ""The Last of The Secret Agents"".
