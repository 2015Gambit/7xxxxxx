Completely clean and legit, MP4 file type, working on getting an HD version so hang tight!	

This is just a re upload that I converted at a higher bitrate, I'm still working on getting my hands on the HD version. Please seed!

p.s. if anyone has any good DRM removal software (better than aimersoft), let me know in the comments.
