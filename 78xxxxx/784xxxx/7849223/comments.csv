,adamdow2,2012-11-24T04:32Z,"psspss,

can i ask what these specials are, no-one else has them and they aren't advertised in wiki or anywhere else that i can see, are they 2 fresh specials that follow on after the secret special weapons special which was uploaded a week ago (also not on wiki which was no.4, which should actually make to more sp no. 5&6)"
[V],psspss,2012-11-24T05:50Z,"i suspect theyre web only (like what i did last year e.g. Aftershows) but compiled for TV (as every so often they take clips from aftershows and mix them
with extra footage)

one will appear to be Ep3 but its actually
got extra footage here and there

I think there other copies hdtv of one of them
floating about maybe 2 by now also but these are good enough to watch on lappy"
[V],psspss,2012-11-24T05:51Z,"and know I doubt I be doing the aftershows was much work rip and converting them

but never know depends on data cap and time
and maybe do a bundle and join them to make worth while.. but have to see"
