,reitzen,2012-11-21T08:02Z,"Under the Ocean coder here. I checked; the torrent is virus free and up to date (at least for the next few days, Alpha 3 is out very soon).

I'm currently seeding, but it's a really slow connection. 

As our site says, we don't have a problem with piracy. It's unavoidable, and worrying about making a great game is a much better use of time and effort. The game is left DRM free so as to not hurt legitimate users.

If you like the project, please do consider supporting it - we're just a couple of developers in a garage, and each sale is a meaningful contribution to the final product.

We're aiming to make purchasing it worth your while due to a steady stream of updates, and some convenience features (integrated mod browser when it's available, etc).

i'v been a long time torrenter of games, the 2 games of interest are minecraft and terraria, which shares similarity to your game. what's interesting about these games, for me at least, is that after torrenting them i bought em. there were a few reasons that led me to that decision:

1. Respect for the developers (minecraft more-so)
2. Multiplayer, buying the game made it easier/possible to play with random people not using himachi/lan (although UTO....)
3. the game was fairly priced 

my $0.02, needed or not "
,reitzen,2012-11-22T00:34Z,There's no question that multiplayer would indeed be a kick ass feature!
,Satori42,2012-11-24T02:16Z,"reitzen, I wanted to thank you for not only making such cool games (I loved Under the Garden), but also being so cool with torrenting as to seed this.  I'm homeless with a laptop, volunteer full-time at our shelter without pay, and certainly couldn't afford to buy these.  But phenomenal games like this are one of the few joys I have in life.  Thanks again."
