Book of Spells is the first title for Wonderbook, a unique single-player
virtual reading/entertainment experience exclusive to PlayStation 3.
The latest addition to the PlayStation augmented reality series, the
Wonderbook system combines game software, and the Wonderbook peripheral
(sold together as a bundle in the Book of Spells release), along with
PlayStation Eye camera and PlayStation Move motion controller
(both sold separately), to bring words to life for readers as never
imagined. The story and interactive activities built into Book of Spells
are steeped in the Harry Potter universe, and are designed to capture the
imaginations of new and longtime fans alike.
