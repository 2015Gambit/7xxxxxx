The Red Bar Radio London Documentary Thing! A feature length film by listener ELLIOTT MARIESS! Footage was collected from everyone's cell phones & cameras to create this 2+ hour documentary! Beautifully edited together, to tell a story of sin, comedy, and craziness! You get to see it all, and Mike's not sober for one bit of it!
