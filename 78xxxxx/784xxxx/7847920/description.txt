Features
--------
The living will have to survive amongst the dead in this game based on The
Walking Dead, the widely acclaimed comic book series and television series.
Across five dark and emotional episodes of gameplay, every decision and
action you take can result in the entire story of the game changing
around you.

Based on Robert Kirkman's Eisner-Award winning comic book series, The
Walking Dead allows gamers to experience the true horror of the zombie
apocalypse.

A tailored game experience -- Live with the profound and lasting consequences
of the decisions that you make in each episode. Your actions and choices
will affect how your story plays out across the entire series.

Experience events that connect to the Walking Dead saga. Meet people and
visit locations that foreshadow the story of Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes.
Meet Glenn before he heads to Atlanta, explore Hershel's farm before Rick
and his group of survivors arrive and before the barn becomes a notorious
location in Walking Dead lore.

You'll be forced to make decisions that are not only difficult, but that
will require you to make an almost immediate choice. There's no time to
ponder when the undead are pounding the door down!
