,m4TTl00m,2012-11-22T09:35Z,"Daman, do you have the first 7 seasons of Bleach in Dual Audio? And will you be uploading 720p or 1080p of Bleach? Oh, and also part 2 of Persona 4: The Animation?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-22T09:53Z,"M4t, there is no such thing as Bleach in True HD, VIz only realeses DVD version and the TV streams arent really full 720p either. 
Only bleach movies are True HD"
,mooserocka,2012-11-23T06:50Z,omg please dont upload the other bleach episodes til later lol. Also i think if u just type bleach eng dub they are already on here uploaded by someone.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-11-23T11:40Z,"Moose, like i said before is not weather i can upload something else or not, Bleach just happens to be done. 
And the other english Dubs are TV streams with cencored video and audio."
