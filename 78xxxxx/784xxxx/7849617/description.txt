Attila Zoller - Common Cause [1979]

2007 - ENJA Records / ENJ-2125 2 / 24 bit master edition / CD

"A spare trio outing from guitarist Attilla Zoller, done with support from Ron Carter on bass and Joe Chambers on drums ΓÇô and in a groove that nicely slips from mellow straight material one moment to more adventurous tunes the next! The straighter work is oddly some of the most appealing here ΓÇô and is a refreshing change to some of Zoller's more experimental (but still great) work from the period ΓÇô a great illustration of his strong tone on a simple line, in a way that we don't often get to hear on record. Straight numbers include "Lady Love" and "Kaybee" ΓÇô juxtaposed with the more "out" "Tshitar", and the soaring number "Meet".
