,mr1991,2012-11-21T01:15Z,Thanks Maherz. I Waiting for your release.
,Addryann,2012-11-21T08:22Z,"Maherz, you are a true inspiration. I've seen your work stolen on countless sites/forums. Good work as always, guru :D"
,Dable1,2012-11-21T09:15Z,"This is for your not the best XP on the net Maherz.
No Recovery Console no WMP11 no Microsoft Visual updates ...
You should take more time in optimizing this Windows XP."
,lamportyx,2012-11-21T10:43Z,"yeah here we go again downloading best stuff from our hero, maherz!"
,choodles,2012-11-21T12:58Z,@Dable1 No offence meant but at least Maherz IS UL stuff.
,Dable1,2012-11-21T16:34Z,"Yes duplicate stuff and spam.
And i upload also, only not on TPB to much spam here."
,MalwareGen,2012-11-21T23:40Z,Whats language?
,MalwareGen,2012-11-21T23:50Z,Whats language supported?
,Heartofthorns,2012-11-22T04:36Z,"Thanks Maherz, it works fine!

@Dable1
With all due respect, I don't get what you mean by spam. If maherz wants to upload something, he can upload it. This is HIS original version of XP Pro which he created. There's an unwritten rule here, you'll find it mentioned many times on piratebay forums : 
""What others upload is none of your business, if you like it, download it, if you don't like it, don't download it. What you download is none of others business."""
,bigbigbuddy,2012-11-22T09:25Z,"Searching through Maherz's stuff, could anyone link me to an x64 bit version by chance?"
,Dable1,2012-11-22T09:40Z,"Then he should put all the informations in HIS torrent and not only half of it.
And it is also my business i need to search true all the crap that the noob are uploading."
,Heartofthorns,2012-11-22T11:59Z,"@ bigbigbuddy
I checked Maherz's torrent list, he hasn't done x64 (64-bit) versions of XP. If you want a 64-bit version, search for ""Windows XP x64"" without quotes in piratebay's search.

@ Dable1
1. You do realise you can use the Automatic Updates to update whatever Microsoft Visual updates you want right? Or rather, you can use it to get any updates listed by Microsoft that you want.
2. Here's what Maherz mentioned in his previous XP torrent (the October one) :
""I've mentioned it about 100 times! When the I386 folder is edited the repair console disappears automatically!
You can't add SATA drivers without modifying that folder, got it?
Like it download it, don't like it, don't :)
Good luck.""
Also, you're saying a VIP uploader is a noob and uploading crap? Lol. "
,Dable1,2012-11-22T20:24Z,"@Heartofthorns
That's bullshit i found another XP yesterday that has SATA drivers and Recovery Console with more updates.
And i also don't get it way he has VIP with this uploads."
,Heartofthorns,2012-11-22T23:42Z,"@ Dable1
1. If so, can you share that XP torrent with us? 
2. And yes he deserves his VIP, I've used his Win 7/IDM/Flash and other torrents many times before. They have been working fine for me. My first time with his XP though.
3. Also, apologies if this seems like an attack on you, but, if you are capable of creating such a torrent, kindly upload it to TPB. You stated in a previous comment that you upload somewhere else. If you feel others are uploading crap and spam, why don't you upload good ones? That would help others too. If you contribute to the community regularly and positively, you might even get trusted and later vip status.
Again, apologies if anything offended you."
,NdluvTPB,2012-11-23T17:57Z,"Thanks Maherz for the upload.

@Heartofthorns
Please stop apologizing to that clown Dooble.  Some people are complainers, some are idiots, even more are both.  Its been said countless times before if you dont like something, dont download it.  Period.  That includes complaining about something someone else did instead of just doing it yourself and keeping it moving.  The fact that this guy wont shut up about someone else's work but does none himself tells you all you need to know about him."

You're welcome.

@choodles
Thank you guys :)

@MalwareGen
It's English, but you can change it to whatever language you want using the appropriate MUI.
Search Google.

@Dable1
As my friend Heartofthorns told you, if you like it download it, id you don't, then just go away!
Stop complaining!!!

@Heartofthorns
Thanks a lot bro for your support, if it was for me I would give you a VIP status here ;)
And forget about Dable1 and don't apologize to him bro!!!

@NdluvTPB
Anytime ;)"
,Sheper,2012-11-24T02:23Z,"@NdluvTPB
Dable1 is right to complain about this torrent there is no Recovery Console and WMP11 in this Windows XP something like this should be written in the Description.
And by the way it's not hard to do a Windows XP or Windows 7 like this you only need 2 Tools for it."

,meowpoop5,2012-11-28T03:39Z,"Seems ok...but CANT BE TRUSTED...

For all those interested..... Microsoft is distributing Windows XP for free now (because the technology is so old), and you can download the clean and activated version here:

go to xp_free_download.info (remove the underscores)"
