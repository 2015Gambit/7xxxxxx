The first seven issues of Courtney Crumrin, a middle school witch in training who is learning the dark arts and navigating (or not) the social scene at school.

Well written and drawn, perfect for your 12 year old.

It's a bit of a chore to hunt down the individual issues of the ongoing series, but I've collected 'em. All thanks to the Empire group.
