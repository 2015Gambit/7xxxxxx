,disneydreams,2012-11-20T15:22Z,I'm just wondering is anyone else having trouble getting this one to work? 
,disneydreams,2012-11-20T21:02Z,"jmanvaf, thank you for doing these every day. I liked it when you did the flv format. i convert them over to avi, and from mp4 format doesn't want to open so it can be converted.  but i thank you for doing them."
[T],jmanwf,2012-11-20T23:49Z,you need vlc media player to play mp4 file formats. let me know if you want me to go back to flv lets have a vote
,Dakota85,2012-11-21T02:37Z,"Hi There Disney & Jman, I use Format Factory and VLC (VLC to play them if I want to but usually I just send them straight to FF and convert to avi) and honestly, didn't even notice the difference, except how much quicker it was to download and format due to the smaller size. So honestly, at this stage i'd say MP4 barring any crazy changes that may occur lol. Thanks again for all this jman - really appreciate it!"
[T],jmanwf,2012-11-21T05:56Z,great program format factory i might start using it myself and upload then it .avi files cheers didn't even know about that program very good
,disneydreams,2012-11-21T12:26Z,"thanks so much i will try that program. i watch them on my portable player well i take cancer treatments. and it only takes avi files. i was using had converter. and that worked on the flv files. and i can use it on some mp4 files but for some reason this time it didn't work. will get the one you mentioned and try it.
my vote is for flv or avi.
thank so much for your help, and jmanvf thanks so much for doing these every day. your great!"
