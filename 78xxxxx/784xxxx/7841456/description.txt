Derrick Storm is hired to bug an African head of state's hotel suite -- but the routine mission quickly spirals out of control when Storm overhears a woman's terrifying scream on the wire. Soon, he'll discover an international conspiracy reaching further than he ever imagined -- and perhaps the truth about Clara Strike, a CIA agent the world thinks is dead!
