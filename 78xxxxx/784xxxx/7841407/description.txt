Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time


SOURCE
Russian DVD-R (Petlja.vremeni.2012.DVD.D)


NOTES
First i want to say: no, the source is not a new dvd-r, the russian dvd-r is identical to the ltu version,
they just didnt tag it right and the follow up encoders tagged it wrong too to hide what it was, it was a
r5 from the first second, and one of the lower ones with the typical problems, all reddish, colours wrong,
too bright on daylight scenes, gamma, hue, saturation, colours all was wrong terrible i can tell, at least
no subs like on the korean release. but it came along with english studio audio.
since the retail is far away i gave it a try.


ENCODE
took me 4 nights to do a perfect version, hrs of work, it was torture, but finally the 8th version is the one to get here.
tried a couple different approaches, all were ok but not perfect, problem was by restoring the colours and getting rid of
that reddish the other colours got problems too, and dark scenes got other influenced than scenes at daylight and
broad daylight. had no other choice than to cut the movie in pieces, and treat every piece different as needed.
btw: the sky is now blue and not greyreddish

since i wont release a version i am not 100% sure its perfect it took me 4 days to do so. like i said before i had to make
couple versions to get it done, also there is an audio problem from 4m30s to 6m19sec, the audio sounds strange and hollow
at that timeframe, thought when i am already doing that version i can fix that too, so i cut out theaudiopart from the
korean subbed release since it was also 5.1 audio, but it didnt work because the audio on the korean version wasnt 5.1
just a fake upmix 4 channels were empty and inside just stereo, so i had to cut the voices into the r5 audiotrack and
insert it back into the movie to get a 5.1 track thats perfect now too.

all in all hrs of work, but the movie is nice and deserves a quality version
will do me till bluray comes along
hope you enjoy
