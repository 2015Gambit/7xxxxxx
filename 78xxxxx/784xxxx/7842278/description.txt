Squeeze - Black Coffee in Bed [promo].VOB


HQ very rare promo music video from a promo DVD with AC3 2+6 ch audio tracks. "Black Coffee in Bed" was the first single released from Squeeze's fifth album, Sweets from a Stranger. At the time of its release it was the longest Squeeze track ever issued, and it remains the only 7" Squeeze single over six minutes long (the 12" single version of "Last Time Forever", released in 1985, exceeds "Black Coffee in Bed" in length by 11 seconds). It peaked at #51 on the UK Singles Chart. 

Backing vocals on "Black Coffee in Bed" were performed by Paul Young and Elvis Costello. 

Squeeze are a British band that came to prominence in the United Kingdom during the New Wave period of the late 1970s, and continued recording successfully in the 1980s and 1990s. They are known in the UK for their hit songs "Cool for Cats", "Up the Junction", "Tempted", "Labelled With Love", "Black Coffee In Bed", "Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)", and "Hourglass". Though not quite as commercially successful in the U.S., "Tempted", "Hourglass" and "853-5937" were all American chart hits for Squeeze, and the band have a dedicated following there and continue to attract new fans. All of Squeeze's hits were written by band members Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford. 

The group formed in Deptford, London in 1975, and first broke up in 1982. Squeeze then reformed in 1985, and broke up again in 1999. The band reunited for tours through the United States and United Kingdom in 2007, and this touring version of Squeeze has continued into the present day. 

In an interview with Rolling Stone in April 2012, Difford and Tilbrook confirmed that they would be recording an album of new material for release in 2013. The band will be undertaking a full UK 'Pop Up Shop' Tour in November and December 2012. 

Squeeze announced on the Radcliffe and Maconie show on BBC Radio 6 that they would be selling live recordings of every night's show on the tour at each venue via a 'Pop up Shop'. They also debuted the first track 'Tommy' from their as yet untitled studio album.
