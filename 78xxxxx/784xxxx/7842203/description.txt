The English language version is not available: sunspots and stormy weather and other acts of god.  Sorry.  I donΓÇÖt have any of this Basho prior to day 5.  Sorry.  DonΓÇÖt waste your breath, or lament.  ThatΓÇÖs just the way it is.

Ps.  Gone to the MP4 Format: easy for me (and on advice from some).  Like it or lump it.
