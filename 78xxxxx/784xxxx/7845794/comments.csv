They still haven't convinced me the show is going up again. The cast isn't as good as they used to. 
Is it just me or does it look like there is a sort of white-filter in the season 10? Everything looks abit brighter, but it kinda dampers the mood. I also find it hard to stay focused on the storyline.  
They can definitely do better than this.

Great upload thought, thanks for posting!"

And thanks VTV."
