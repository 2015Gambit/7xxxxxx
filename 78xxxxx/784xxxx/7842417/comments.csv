[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-21T17:14Z,"Sicanddisturbed, yeah I think I even have Disciples complete discography.  It has 15 titles which, Lord willing, I'll be torrenting for you just as soon as this 49th bundle finishes up."
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-21T17:15Z,"Dessertgi, I have that Jesus Culture Live From New York release, and it'll be included in my 50th bundle in the days ahead.  :)"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-11-21T17:17Z,"Weston0175, I don't have access to my music collection right now, but off the top of my head, ""Brave Saint Return"" and ""Jonnie & Brookie"" don't ring any bells.  I'll be sure to check it out for you though."
