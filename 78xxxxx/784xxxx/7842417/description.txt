2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

With the year winding down, there still seems to be plenty of new Christian Music filling my hard drives, and hopefully yours too. When I started torrenting these bundles back in 2011, I had set a personal goal for myself to share 1,000 releases by the end of that 2011 year.  But because of my late start, I fell short of reaching that goal.  So I simply carried the goal over for 2012.

With today's 31 new titles in this 49th bundle, we're now up to 1,299 Christian releases this year.  Easily surpassing my hopes for 1,000.  Yet I still have plenty more to share, and my continued prayer is always the same ... Please share this music with those in need of the message.  Family members, friends colleagues, etc.  Please seed for a little longer than you might otherwise would.  Please support the artist in his/her ministry by purchasing those titles that find a warm place in your heart.  And in all, be thankful in Him.
