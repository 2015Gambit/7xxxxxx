I got throm the ultimate petra fan Terje AKA trodland 
Checkout his website www.petrafiles.com
He and I traded shows recently and he recorded this show himself in HD
Here is how he described the recording.
"I have made this flv/mp4 file in Full HD with Adobe Premiere.   ItΓÇÖs as good as it gets with 
Premiere.  Audio should be as good as on camera.  ItΓÇÖs a cheap camera. 
Cost under 1000 dollar. ItΓÇÖs ΓÇ£lossy/compressedΓÇ¥ when recording to memory in camera. If not, this show would 
have been 20GB in size."
 
This is the best recording of Classic Petra I have come across  Enjoy!!
