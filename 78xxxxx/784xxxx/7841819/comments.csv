,Cibaka,2012-11-26T15:00Z,"Really outstanding video and sound.
Thanks marcus100868.

But I can't copy, move or extract -
stuck at 4%...
Anyone else ?"
,marcus100868,2012-11-26T21:59Z,"Hi Cibaka, what do you mean by can't copy, move or extract -
stuck at 4%...?"
,Cibaka,2012-11-27T12:08Z,"Let me elaborate. When I tried to copy the file
to another disk, it got stuck at 4%.

When I tried to extract the video and audio with mkvextractgui, it froze at 4.8%.

Playing from the beginning, it froze at 7min.21sec.

I've tried force check the torrent; it hit error at
4.8%.

Marcus, can you confirm you can play thru
7min.21sec ?
Thank you for your attention."
,marcus100868,2012-11-27T13:10Z,"Cibaka,does the file play fully on your PC ?"
,marcus100868,2012-11-27T13:12Z,If you want to copy to disc you must use 25gig blu-ray disc and also have a blu-ray player that plays the mkv file because it will come up as a data disc i use oppo bluray player the play just about any disc or files or if you stream from PC to home theater.Or other option  convert the file to another format with ac3 audio but the you will be losing quality.
,marcus100868,2012-11-27T13:13Z,"Extracting the video and audio that could be because the Mkv file  you downloaded is Dts Hd Master audio Sampling rate : 96.0 KHz 24 bits.

Yes i can confirm it plays with vlc player on pc the full concert and it streams with twonky server to my home theater but i have not tried this file on disc but i have tried different concerts files  on disc and it works.

There you go hope this helps."
