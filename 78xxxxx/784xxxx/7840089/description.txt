Book Description

Yammer is the private and fun way to collaborate, plan, and keep up with co-workers.

Just about all of us either use or know about social media networksΓÇô Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and more, which are all simple-to-use, popular, and satisfying.

Yammer is just that, a social network but with one huge difference. ItΓÇÖs only for your company and it is private and secure.

In the ΓÇ£Yammer StarterΓÇ¥, we explore how Yammer operates and the many exciting ways in which it helps your company and you. This book will also show you how to get more out of Yammer and join in all the contributing and other fun things going on. We will keep it all simple, use lots of helpful illustrations, and include useful examples of how Yammer works. YouΓÇÖll learn quickly and have fun doing it.

The ΓÇ£Yammer StarterΓÇ¥ leads you gently from the activities you do most (connecting with people, sharing content, networking with clients/customers) through the tasks you might do less (administrative, technical).

The ΓÇ£Yammer StarterΓÇ¥ introduces you to what Yammer is and how it works. It shows you how to collaborate with the people across your company as well as in specific departments and local workgroups. You will learn how groups are created to get work done more efficiently, how to tap into your companyΓÇÖs ΓÇ£collective brainΓÇ¥, and the many ways Yammer lets us share content. You will be able to master creating networks to communicate with outside clients, customers, vendors, etc.
