Cheers!"
,brownnotesuicide,2012-11-21T07:29Z,+1 btw
,OmniNegro,2012-11-21T07:48Z,"I question this torrent. Is it not too early for this to be available? And even if not, would it not require a patch to work?

Update #1 was a long time ago. And this is your first torrent under this username. I will not partake. I will wait until it is posted by someone I know I can trust.

Presuming it is not malware/fake, then I thank you anyway."
,Vosur,2012-11-21T07:52Z,"@OmniNegro The new DLC was released on November 20th. If you choose not to trust me, that's fine. In the meantime, you can find the same files uploaded by long-term members on alternative torrent sites."
,shigbrox,2012-11-21T09:56Z,"Just started downloading all the patches, in which order should i install them? are they all neccessary?
(skidrow patches 4-6, skidrow captain scarlett dlc)"
,Militance,2012-11-21T11:55Z,thx mate +1 if it works :)
,Militance,2012-11-21T12:49Z,"I can confirm it works thx fr this, i had error messages while unraring this but let it unrar it works"
,Vosur,2012-11-21T13:38Z,"@shigbrox Install Borderlands 2 in the following order:
1. Main game
2. Patch 4 (including Mechromancer DLC)
3. Captain Scarlett DLC
4. Patch 6
5. Mr Torgue DLC
6. Patch 1.2.2

This order worked for me and those whom I play this game with.

@Militance That's strange. I have not received any errors when extracting these files. But it ultimately doesn't matter if it still works for you."
,chameleeon,2012-11-21T13:39Z,it works! =)
,nefariousP1G,2012-11-21T14:23Z,do i need to extract the files still or just copy the rar files into my borderlands folder?
,Vosur,2012-11-21T14:57Z,@nefariousP1G You need to extract them first.
,Krowphyl,2012-11-21T17:20Z,"Like Militance, i got alot of error messages while unraring the DLC. Most errors were about the Iris folder and now that I tried the DLC in-game I got the problem that there aren't  voice sounds (including echos [they just pop in and out without anything]) and now i wanna ask if someone got a clue how to fix this unraring problem."
,Vosur,2012-11-21T17:27Z,"@Krowphyl Which extracting program are you using? I remember an instance in which I extracted something with 7zip and got a bunch of error messages and when I tried it with WinRar, it worked just fine. I suggest you to try it with these two programs."
,OmniNegro,2012-11-21T17:34Z,"Looks correct. Ignore my pessimism.

As for extracting the files, do not try to extract them directly over the final location. Different archive tools handle this in different ways. Just extract in a temporary location and copy the files manually. It is easy to do and only requires one more step.

It works just fine. If you have errors or bugs then sorry, but that is a problem not associated with this torrent. It is likely a mistake on your part. No big deal. You can fix it. Start over. Uninstall and reinstall from a known working copy.

As Vosur said, main game first. Verify it works before you try the next step. And do the same each time you follow the next step. This way if you have a problem at one step you can see what is wrong or try another solution.

For example, if you install the Skidrow release of the game, then verify it loads and quit, you can then apply patch#4 with the Mecromancer DLC and see if that works. If not you should not expect to fix that with the other steps. Fix the first broken thing before you move on.

And despite the claims in the title, it looks like this is patch 1.22 anyway, so I have no idea why you would re-apply that on top of this."
,jadrdc,2012-11-21T17:51Z,"This torrent works fine just follow the instructions, i still got the exclamation point in the download contents but the DLC is in the fast travel tower. thank you Vosur sorry the bad english mates cheers"
,jlk69,2012-11-21T18:05Z,It looks like the voices are missing ? or is just me?
,Vosur,2012-11-21T18:14Z,"@OmniNegro I'm glad that you have changed your mind. :)

Regarding the title of this torrent: As you said earlier, this is my first torrent on TPB. I didn't know that you can't edit the description and title of a torrent after uploading it. Unfortunately, the forum staff couldn't change it either. I would have deleted and re-uploaded it if it wasn't for the fact that over 800 people are actively involved in keeping this torrent alive.

It looks kind of flawed, but it ultimately doesn't have any effect on the functionality of the torrent, so I suppose it's not all that bad."
,Vosur,2012-11-21T18:19Z,@jlk69 The voices are included in this torrent and are working fine. I've tested it a few minutes ago. so the problem has to be on your end. Did you get the same error message when unpacking the files that the other peeps described?
,jadrdc,2012-11-21T18:22Z,Ignore that unrar error cuz the files will be extracted anyway just wait
,jlk69,2012-11-21T19:05Z,"@Vosur: Now, tested in english it works properly, but in spanish the voices don´t work. "
,xxela,2012-11-21T20:11Z,"THANKS !!
Ignore that extraction error. It works just fine. For windows 8 apply the fix."
,11770,2012-11-21T22:07Z,my game still won't start after applying the dlc + updates >.> what gives skidrow....
,JayWeishaupt,2012-11-21T22:08Z,"Installed and working. However, my inventory capacity has been set to 27 from 115. I uninstalled the game and reinstalled everything according to the steps on here and encountered the same problem again. Any suggestions?"
,JayWeishaupt,2012-11-21T22:23Z,This install reduced my inventory capacity to 27. I uninstalled and reinstalled everything according to the above steps but the same error was still happening. Any suggestions?
,11770,2012-11-21T23:18Z,jay did you do anything specific to  get it working like run the installers in admin mode?
,JayWeishaupt,2012-11-21T23:28Z,I just followed the steps listed in the comments here. It sounds like you made a mistake with the crack somewhere. Try redoing that part.
,11770,2012-11-21T23:58Z,"i've been dl'ing from here for 7 years now sir, i believe i know where a crack goes >.< my original does work but this does not :/"
,noekk,2012-11-22T02:09Z,Does this shit work on Windows 8 yet ?
,Vosur,2012-11-22T05:54Z,"@JayWeishaupt The maximum inventory capacity is 27. In order to raise it to 115, you have to use a mod or something similar."
,Vosur,2012-11-22T05:56Z,"@11770 Did you install Steam? For whatever reason, one needs to have Steam installed to play the Skidrow version. You must not have it running while you play, though."
,samengo,2012-11-22T10:40Z,"For GOD´s sake someone help me please!I don´t have any voices in the DLC :(
What went wrong?"
,NightNiix,2012-11-22T14:55Z,"Maybe I Know why some people can't play... You must not copy Crack content to game folder - instead you must copy to 

Borderlands 2 > Binaries > Win32

The game exe and dll's are there.

Worked just fine for me! Thanks for the upload!"
,jlk69,2012-11-22T15:33Z,"@samego: The voices only works in english, this download is not multilanguage, the folders of the voices in ""C:***Borderlands2DLCIrisLicAudio"" are missing for other languages except for the english voices. 

Waiting for a MULTI6 DLC download..."
,Vosur,2012-11-22T15:38Z,"@NightNix You're welcome. I really can't tell why it's not working for these few people based on the information they give me. It has worked for hundreds of people so far and I've verified it myself. I've already played through the whole DLC and didn't encounter any problems. If it doesn't work for them, it's because they did something wrong.

Now, I'm more than willing to help them, but simply saying ""It doesn't work"" doesn't get us anywhere. For those of you who encounter problems: Give me an exact step-by-step description of what you did, otherwise I can't do anything."
,samengo,2012-11-22T18:37Z,"@jlk69:This can really be,I was playing in german.I appreciate it,hopefully it works."
,samengo,2012-11-22T19:03Z,"@jlk69:
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!You are my personal hero,atleast for a day :D"
,jadawgkss,2012-11-23T02:15Z,"It's amazing that you were able to include the DLC, the Update, the crack, and all the fixes in "
,lazyknob,2012-11-23T14:48Z,"I discovered a trojan downloader today on my system. The only two torrents I've downloaded is this and another.

I am not accusing this torrent of being infected but I'm just narrowing down the possibilities in terms of file changes done today.

Please help me by searching for these two files. MSESS.EXE(did a google and this is a known trojan downloader) and checker.exe(this is in some cases a legitimate file but as i keep track of my system processes, this was out of the ordinary in my case).

Do reply reply kindly if you do not find this on your system"
,Vosur,2012-11-23T17:10Z,"@lazyknob This torrent is absolutely clean. It has been confirmed both by a moderator of TPB, as well as by two independent virus scanners I used (KIS 2013 and avast! Free-Antivirus 2013). The files you mentioned are neither on my PC, nor are they part of this torrent.

Are you sure that you got the viruses from this one?"
,XprojectX2,2012-11-23T21:54Z,Thank you !! you are a GOD !!
,plenary88,2012-11-24T08:01Z,trying to extract the files i get a whole bunch of error messages and then antivirus removes the borderlands2.exe file due to WS.Reputation.1
,lazyknob,2012-11-24T08:48Z,"Like i said, I'm not saying this is infected, I'm just narrowing down the possibilities. If no one found the files i mentioned, then simply this isn't it. 

Which makes my other torrent a prime suspect now :P

If that is the case then, this torrent works fine. If you get any errors during the unzipping which was what happened to me, ignore it.

Also I don't bother with anti-virus softwares, they cause you more inconvenience than help when it matters. Being attentive to your system is the best anti-virus!"
,zeroeight,2012-11-25T23:13Z,"Doesn't work, game will not launch."
,Vosur,2012-11-25T23:41Z,@zeroeight You need to have Steam installed.
,kev004,2012-11-26T00:56Z,"does it work on the legit version? followed the instructions and all, but the map is not appearing in the fast travel system."
,Wn161,2012-11-28T15:34Z,"i just downloaded it, and tested, it's working i didn't test the in game yet but, it think there will be no issues for me, and the best part is NO VIRUS! thanks for uploading an seeding!, even with the error on winrar it works, like i read before just ignore them"
,Vosur,2012-11-29T15:39Z,@Wn161 You're welcome. Though I still don't understand why you guys get an error when unzipping the files. I tested it both with Winrar and 7zip and didn't get an error with either of them.
,zeroeight,2012-12-01T16:44Z,"I have gone through every single upload of the game itself, every update that's been released, and every piece of DLC that's been uploaded, from every frigging site I can possible find (Easily over 25 sites) and no matter what order or combination I install them in, and no matter what .exe I launch the game with, the same thing happens which is the game starts to launch, starts then goes dead
OR
The game will start and then crash with an error message that says Borderlands2 has stopped working

But in either case I'm sick and tired of people leaving comments saying this works fine, or there is nothing wrong with it, when now the game cannot even be launched AT ALL.

The only 2 updates and DLC that actually work with this are: Mechromancer and Captain Scarlett and her Pirates Booty.

NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK BEYOND THAT so stop people are lying. Or leaving comments with different accounts on their own torrents or having their friends in on this scam doing it."
,Vosur,2012-12-01T19:37Z,"@zeroeight Human behavior is very interesting. Instead of considering that you've done a mistake, you rather conclude that thousands of anonymous people all over the world are conspiring against you specifically, pretending that the cracked versions of the game work when it doesn't. 

Do you want me to upload gameplay footage me playing with the cracked version on YouTube? Do you want me to make a video of me installing the cracked version and then playing it? "
,Vosur,2012-12-01T19:40Z,"@zeroeight Additionally, have you ever tried installing Steam before running the game? It's a well-known issue that the Skidrow version won't launch without having it installed."
