Ross Kemp: Extreme World Season 2
Ross Kemp travels to some of the most dangerous, lawless and violent regions on Earth, to show how international organised crime, terrorists and local criminal networks have created alliances that are destroying the lives of millions of people. Covering stories that are deemed too dangerous to tell, getting first-hand accounts from the victims of crime; he will join the police who are battling the criminals and will come face to face with the criminals themselves. In each episode Ross Kemp will hunt down, meet and challenge criminals who spread death and mayhem around our world through drug dealing, human trafficking, terrorism, and murder. From the violent slums of Karachi to the lawless prisons of Venezuela, Extreme World 2 takes Ross across five continents in search of the stories that rarely make the news yet affect the lives of millions.




2)  Venezuela 
While Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian revolution has improved the lives of millions of Venezuelans, there are still areas impervious to his utopian socialist vision. These are the parts that Kemp seeks out in Caracas, from the hospital dealing with dozens of gunshot wound victims every night, to the grim prison where there are no guards. One Chavez supporter points out the clinics and new housing, but Kemp is left bemused that a country so rich in resources can still be failing so many of its people. The actor visits Caracas, Venezuela, to find out how the world's most oil-rich nation has also become one of its most violent. Ross visits a police station on the edge of the capital's most notorious slums, spending time with cops who are out-manned and out-gunned in a city where 50 to 60 police officers are killed a year.
