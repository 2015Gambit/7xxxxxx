'There Are Many Hells.' The Crow in Tokyo. The Crow searching for the stolen soul of his lost love-the search taking him on a blood-red trail of vengeance. In order to set her free, the Crow must now do important things, like descend into the layered hell of Japanese Buddhist mythology. Then he must find the living body of his beloved... and kill it. The Crow's return concludes in explosive fashion here!
