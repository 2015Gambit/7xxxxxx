Rage Against the Machine - The Collection [5-CD Box] (2010)


Collecting some of the most defiant and politically charged rock to be released during the '90s into one complete set, the value-priced Collection gathers all five of Rage Against the Machine's albums together in one box. This compilation charts the rise of the incendiary rap-rock act as they blew up both speakers and minds with their socially conscious lyrics and groove-heavy aggression. While all five albums are housed in mini-LP sleeves, there isn't anything in the way of B-sides or previously unreleased material, so this set is definitely more for the newly initiated than the die-hard fan. 

This 2010 five CD box set contains all five of their albums, each housed in mini LP sleeves. Included are the albums Rage Against The Machine (1992), Evil Empire (1996), The Battle Of Los Angeles (1999), Renegades (2000) and Live At The Grand Olympic Auditorium (2003). As one of the forefathers of the Rock Rap movement in the 1990s, this limited box set celebrates Rage Against The Machine's status as an influential political band in contemporary music.
