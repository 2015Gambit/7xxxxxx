ARGH ! As always, with TsuyaTsuya, I start a manga seeing it as a potential fap object, until I totally discard sex and get interested in the story and what light, or what shades instead, it projects on the human soul.
And here, once again, I lost track of the drawings halfwayΓÇª PLEASE, am I the only person finding the mangas by TsuyaTsuya interesting for their story like that ? 
Here, we follow a young man, between adolescence and adult age, whoΓÇÖs discovering in an unusual manner the matters of sexuality, of adulthood, and learning that his body and soul may have conflictual inclinations. ItΓÇÖs an interesting read, this young man has a quite mature and analytic personality, and heΓÇÖs faced to a situation that requires guts, acceptance and humility, qualities he was partly lacking ΓÇô acquiring them is part of him growing up, precisely.
Sorry for the long speech, I canΓÇÖt help but read TsuyaTsuyaΓÇÖs mangas as if they werenΓÇÖt porn at all and worth for their single scenario.
Anyway, graphically, itΓÇÖs the usual, women aged 18-20 or 40, plump bodies, intensity seen through the eyes, while hole censorshipΓÇª
Me, IΓÇÖm recommending you this manga, well, it will be as you like
