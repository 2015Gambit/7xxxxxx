Video2Brain - Getting Started with 3D in Photoshop

In this unique workshop, digital artist Uli Staiger walks you through the process of using source images, a downloaded 3D object, and PhotoshopΓÇÖs tools to create a striking composition. After combining source images and creating layer masks, youΓÇÖll add a 3D object, lighting, and details like steam, corrosion, and a stream of water. Finally, youΓÇÖll stylize the composition by adding a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer with the Soft Light blend mode. Along the way youΓÇÖll learn how to work with layer groups, textures, 3D cameras, point lights, and more. Select lessons feature picture-in-picture live footage of Uli working with his pen and tablet, enabling you to see and learn from his techniques up close.
