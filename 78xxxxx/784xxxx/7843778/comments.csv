[T],RayCort,2012-11-20T14:45Z,"these hit and run folks are really upsetting me. I am limited on monthly bandwidth, and not part of a team. It was showing 30 Seeders the first time I uploaded it before I removed it. This madness has to stop. If people keep hitting and running and NOT willing to seed to share then I will ask Admin to remove all my torrents and close my account then I will look for better site where people are willing to Seed and share my torrents."

,_Palleba,2012-11-20T17:32Z,"To RayCort: You are realy working hard to make us all the TV movies avable to us for download, and I really love all these movies you are uploading.

I got your torrents fom Demonoid at first, but then they were shut dows...

I seed your torrents as much as I can but my bandwidth is limited to 60 KB/s, so...

But anyway, you are realy working hard time and I say Thank you so much for yout hard work!!"

0 peers.
Really hoping someone could seed."
[T],RayCort,2012-11-21T16:21Z,@sugarbabyeqin. Try to delete the torrent then redownload it. Send me a PM in the SuprBay Forums if you still need help.
,KwyjiboLinguist,2012-11-21T22:36Z,"Thanks @RayCort !
Only 9 hrs to go before it's completely downloaded so I  should have it just in time to also watch it on tv tomorrow morning! lolz!
I'm downloading this for the sole purpose to ensure that it continues to be seeded, at least by me anyway, because without seeders and re-seeders sites like just won't exist.
So please don't pull your torrents RayCort.

And have a Happy Thanksgiving all you Americans."
