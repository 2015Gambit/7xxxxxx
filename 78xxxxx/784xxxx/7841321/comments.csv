,letsgetstronger,2012-11-19T18:55Z,"sceneline and DibyaTPB: Any chance of you both talking to each other in respect of your duplicated torrents?

I'm very grateful for the time you spent uploading this stuff for us, but two torrents of the exact same thing does not make sense. It just splits us. Seeders of one torrent can't talk to leechers of the other and we can't get the performance of just one torrent.

For the BitTorrent community, please. Let's get stronger!"
