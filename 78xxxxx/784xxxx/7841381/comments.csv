,poijhbn,2012-11-20T02:40Z,Stop posting that. Converting won't make it horrible and AVI is not better. Just figure out media streaming.
,gjones88,2012-11-20T03:05Z,Thanks Dibya for the 1080p Web Downloads!
[V],azizex666,2012-11-20T05:11Z,"like gjones88 said,
Many Thanks for all the 1080p.WEB-DL uploads."
,kiwij,2012-11-20T22:24Z,"The 1080P web-dl is not encoded by dibya, it is encoded by the studio/distributor, asking for an avi version doesn't make any sense and asking dibya to convert to .avi is no different than you converting the source to .avi yourself."
,grefranger,2012-11-24T07:55Z,Thanks Dibya I love yoU!!!!
