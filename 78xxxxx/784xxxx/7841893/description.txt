Being Human is een Engelse serie van de zender BBC Three. De serie ging in première op 18 februari 2008.
In Being Human delen 3 vrienden een appartement. 
Om het bijzonder te maken, zijn deze drie vrienden niet de doorsnee medemens, maar is de een een weerwold, de tweede een vampier en de derde een geest. 
Deze drie personen vinden dus genoeg uitdagingen om het dagelijks leven door te brengen

Life among the living is tough. 
Meet Mitchell, a 120-year-old vampire, George, a highly intelligent werewolf, and Annie an agoraphobic ghost who died under mysterious circumstances, whom all live together with just the slight bit of hope that they can fit into the community and smile at the thought of being human. 
But they soon discover that being human is not as easy as they hoped.
