,LfromDeathNote,2012-11-21T10:17Z,"Downloaded fine, installed fine, configgered all the settings and such...

""Sonic Adventure 2 failed to start (error code 54)""

I dunno if it's just me, or if it's the torrent, but it is not working. "

,jackle86,2012-11-21T15:26Z,"Everyone who's having problems: Use poweriso or daemon tools or something like that to open the iso, and look for a folder named ""Crack"". then copy the files in that folder to the game directory. Then the game should run just fine."
,iddo400,2012-11-21T15:58Z,i try and it and the game doesnt show up again what to do?
,pulpitow,2012-11-21T16:59Z,dont work!!! APPCRASH :( help me :c
,flowmethodz,2012-11-22T03:25Z,"Thx for torrent.
But the crack does NOT work.
plz fix"
,TailaFTW,2012-11-22T04:23Z,"This runs as WAY TOO FAST. It also will not allow me to use my controller in-game, but it lets me configure in the Launcher still.

Please upload a better crack. (Not full game.)"
,LfromDeathNote,2012-11-22T04:52Z,"I tried the thing that jacke86 recommended and it worked. 

At this point, only one question remains: What's that groovy-ass music on the setup wizard called? It haunts my dreams."
,flamingskulls,2012-11-23T00:26Z,ok so when i finished downloading  i installed it and did the crack and all that  the game looks as though it wants to start but then it just doesnt no matter what i do  like try different cracks and  grant admin full control shit like that pissing me off now
,cyzor767,2012-11-23T15:40Z,"I have the exact same problem as flaming skulls. if anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated. i have a feeling it may be because i'm running win 7 x64 instead of x32. if anyone has knowledge on this, please help."
,cyzor767,2012-11-23T15:44Z,"I am having the exact same problem as flaming skulls. if anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated. I think it may have something to do with me running a 64 bit version of win 7 instead of 32 bit. My question is, is it compatible with win 7 x64? if anyone can help, please do."
,wizallah2000,2012-11-24T05:15Z,Better to just download a dreamcast emulator and find the iso for this. This port is really bad. More trouble than it's worth.
,ED1XCD,2012-11-25T00:06Z,"Installed fine and the game is running, But the only problem is that the game runs way too fast, I guess there is no FPS cap."
,chriscrash,2012-11-25T17:29Z,"guys, to run this game without problems just install it, then install directx9 version for this game in redistributable folder:( c:/program files x86/sonic adventure 2/redist), finally crack it, and that's all, no crash at the beginning, no framerate issues ;) "
,Kraliburning,2012-11-27T12:54Z,"Guys guys settle down xD

You can fix the errors by copying the crack to the game folder , and run the launcher.exe with administrator :P then launch.. Should work :P

The game is working fine 100% "
,Kraliburning,2012-11-27T12:56Z,test
,callofktulu84,2012-11-30T19:57Z,"I just downloaded it and copied the crack into the game directory, etc. and now after I launch the game it works fine, but when I get to the file select, I choose the only ""New File"" and it doesn't choose it, it just says file select again and it never works. Any help?"
,Kirbyman100,2012-12-01T12:40Z,Did everything it said to do. It doesn't work at all.
