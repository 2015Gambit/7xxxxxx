PHASE REVERSE
They started as a trio on October 2007.
The three of them meet at JohnΓÇÖs recording studio, and they decide to join their forces.
It was clear from the very beginning that there was chemistry between them, and everything seemed to be very promising. John was the part of the puzzle that was missing all these yearsΓÇª His unique style, sound, and ΓÇ£freshΓÇ¥ approach, got the best out of A
lex and Tas. After lots of live performances and a year later they hit the studio and record 11 songs that signal the birth of ΓÇ£PHASE REVERSEΓÇ¥...
Blues, Rock' N' Roll, Hard Rock, and Heavy Metal all sonically mix while the American Southern Rock is set as a background all processed in a ΓÇ£PHASE REVERSEΓÇ¥ mode resulting in the particular
and simultaneously modern sound of the band.
They called it ''Heavy Rock'' and this was something new for the Greek Rock and Metal scene in 2007.
One thing is for sure, that we are dealing with some genuine rockers that their songs simply and genuinely declare their presence in their own unique way with a voice of their own at a time that is characterized by labelsΓÇª in their own words:
ΓÇ£ΓÇªour music is just RockΓÇªHeavy Rock!ΓÇ¥

┬╖ ΓÇ£Phase ReverseΓÇ¥ released their Debut CD on 07 Dec 2009 available on the Greek market only
and digitally at: Amazon ΓÇô e Music ΓÇô iTunes ΓÇô Napster & Rapsody.
