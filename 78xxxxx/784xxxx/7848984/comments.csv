,my3angels,2012-11-22T02:03Z,Extreme do know how long I will have to wait for breaking dawn part 2??  super excited
,Silvak,2012-11-22T05:38Z,It just came out to theaters.  Look for a CAM version somewhere else other wise you'll have to wait till next year.
,Xanthippus,2012-11-22T07:25Z,"Thanks, extremezone! Any word as to when Resident Evil: Retribution and/or Bourne Legacy are coming?"
,Pragmadox,2012-11-22T07:48Z,Titles come out when they come out ffs. Expect new movies to take at least 100 days after their theater release. Except during December and January when screeners come out for awards season.

Movie is pretty shitty, the FX in the poster are better than all the effects in the movie together. It has some good parts but it's boring. You can put it as a background movie while cooking or browsing the web lol"
,CommonsCarnival,2012-11-23T21:01Z,I can't believe people are asking for Breaking Dawn part 2 already. Good grief! The same people that complain about having to sit at the children's table at holidays no doubt.

,liana_01,2012-11-24T04:23Z,CommonsCarnival stop being so rude we are allowed to tell extremezone what we would like him to upload so he knows and it may take time but he always comes threw in the end. if your not happy with how things are don't download simple
,jeffplane,2012-11-24T11:46Z,"@ liana_01 It's coming ""through"" not threw...
