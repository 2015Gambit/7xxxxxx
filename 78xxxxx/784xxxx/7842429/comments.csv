,Optimus10,2012-11-20T17:27Z,Lang. is Engish NTSC I believe ..... however there are ways to use both just may have to do some digging to learn more about the settings depending on what ur working with....
,axprodigy1,2012-11-21T02:28Z,"Whilst I appreciate the hard work of every uploader out there, I have to question the posting of duplicate torrents. https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7826719/Disney_Epic_Mickey_2_-_The_Power_of_Two_%5BWBFS%5D_SERE4Q_NTSC_wiiGM That file is identical to this and has a rock solid seeds/peers base. Uploading duplicate files just fragments the seeding base when we could easily collaborate on a single file and keep it alive and healthy for a long long time. Again, I appreciate your uploading anything at all and its not just you but I feel this issue needs to be addressed."
,Optimus10,2012-11-23T19:42Z,axprodigy1 I usually seed the original torrent also for as long as I can I have been downloading for many years from TPB however am just figuring out the uploading so some are just my way of trying to switch from my laptop to my home without using up double memory thanks for the heads up on the info tho .
