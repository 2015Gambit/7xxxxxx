Definitely not recommended  if you plan to stream to a screen larger than 18"" or resolution higher than the vid itself. 
It felt like I was watching a futuristic version of Mario on my 23"" (Acer G235H. 50,000:1 A/R. 1920x1080 res)
Sound on the other hand was good, but could have been better. 
Like I said this is not good for larger screens or higher resolutions; so if you are looking for HD quality and crystal sound I would suggest finding a better torrent (Look for one about 2-3gb and Brip)  "
