4.9 is available here from the developer: http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html"
,okbyme,2012-11-21T08:41Z,"To emphasize what pryingeyes has correctly said, there is actually no point uploading FREE software easily available from a number of sources, especially if one of those sources is the DEVELOPER himself.

If you fuckers don't like it, then by God Almighty, don't download the damned thing.  Neither one of you dumb-ass fucks has uploaded a GODDAMNED thing, so shut the fuck up.

@oneslider - THANK YOU.  *I* appreciate your efforts.  "

thank you guys !!!"
,oneslider,2012-11-22T16:34Z,"In actual fact I found the file to be ""damaged"" my fault for messing with the contents, the app doesn't like you changing the apps main icon.
I'll make a torrent for the main DMG if you want it, post a comment if you want it or go to  http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html
And get the latest.
