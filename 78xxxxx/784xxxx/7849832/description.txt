Book Description
If youΓÇÖve heard of Arduino or even used it in your own projects, you probably know that the AVR microcontroller is the brain of the Arduino. In Practical AVR Microcontrollers, youΓÇÖll learn how to use the AVR microcontroller to make your own nifty projects and gadgets.

YouΓÇÖll start off with the basics in part one: setting up your development environment and learning how the ΓÇ£nakedΓÇ¥ AVR differs from the Arduino. Then youΓÇÖll gain experience by building a few simple gizmos and learning how everything can be interconnected.

In part two, we really get into the goodies: projects! Each project will show you exactly what software and hardware you need, and will provide enough detail that you can adapt it to your own needs and parts availability. Some of the projects youΓÇÖll make:

- An illuminated secret panel
- A hallway lighting system with a waterfall effect
- A crazy lightshow
- Visual effects gizmos like a Moire wheel and shadow puppets

In addition, youΓÇÖll design and implement some home automation projects, including working with wired and wireless setups. Along the way, youΓÇÖll design a useable home automation protocol and look at a variety of hardware setups.

Whether youΓÇÖre new to electronics, or you just want to see what you can do with an AVR outside of an Arduino, Practical AVR Microcontrollers is the book for you.

What youΓÇÖll learn
- How programming the AVR is different from programming an Arduino
- How to use the Arduino IDE to program the AVR, and when to use AVR Studio
- How to network your AVR devices and use them in home automation
- How to add intelligence to your AVR devices
- How to make games with AVR
