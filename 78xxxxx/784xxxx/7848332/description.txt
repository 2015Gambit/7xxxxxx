Jelly, Titch and Smiler are back in action. Led by their "boss" Guy Tenby, the Convict Commandos are thrown into the middle of an assassination plot in Yugoslavia.

Commando #4552 - The Sergeant and the Squad (2012)
By Ferg Handley

He was a tough loner, a veteran of the war in Far East, a survivor of the terrors of the jungle and a hundred brutal fights against the Japanese. The last thing he wanted was to take a group of raw recruits under his wing.

To them he was more a like a machine than a man ΓÇæ and a killing machine at that - gruff, remorseless and cold. To them was the only man who could get them through the war.

But some of those rookies worried that they'd end up just like... The Sergeant.

Commando #4553 - Sky Ace (2012)
By Maitland

This is the inside story of two ace British fighter pilots, and the strange and deadly rivalry that drove them to outfly, outshoot and outdare each other through every risky second of their dog-fights with the mighty Luftwaffe.

They did things with fighters no aircraft were built to do, writing the story of their feuds with each other in the skies over Southern England in the flaming wreckage of dozens of Nazi planes. They became a legend in their own lifetimes.

Between these covers, for the first time, is their glorious story.

Well, the German Army was heading straight for the kitchen where Stan worked, so his first taste of action was going to come a lot sooner than he reckoned!
