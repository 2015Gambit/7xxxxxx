Tim Duncan added 20 points and 15 rebounds, as the Spurs imposed their will against an overmatched Boston defense, shooting a season-high 58.4 percent from the field, the highest number Boston has allowed to an opponent since 2007. Rajon Rondo kept the Celtics within striking distance by scoring 18 of his 22 points in the second half, but the All-Star point guard and his teammates could not keep pace with the Spurs late, as they pulled away for the 12-point win.
