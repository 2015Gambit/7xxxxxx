are long believed to be dead, ∩¼ünd that many of the planets remaining inhabitants were in

the *.nroff files are how the book was created. it was created by hand fro the original Easy Script 64 documents. there is a shell script in the package that makes the book using Nroff/Groff with the -ms macros. it produces a postscript document and I believe an ascii document that can be fed into a standard line printer or a daisy wheel (do you even know what those are ;) )
then,  the script uses ps2pdf to convert it to a PDF document.		"
