On rutracker titled "The Interpreter (..... / Sydney Pollack) [2005 ...., Blu-ray BD50 1080p] EUR", released on 09-APR-2010.
On hdclub titled "The Interpreter (2005) Blu-ray EUR 1080p VC-1 DTS 5.1-BX", uploaded on 08-AUG-2010
I personally wouldn't tag it with EUR having Jap & Lat Spa audios and more asian subs on disc. 
Some asians wouldn't click on a torrent tagged with "EUR" thinking it's not their cup of tea, so "multi" is a better choice I think.
Anyway it seems the source is Spanish BD (EUR + LAtin)

( Region B ,european).
Good political thriller with Nicole Kidman & Sean Penn here, don't miss it, strong seeders here. 
And yeah, I'll upload the "...1080p DTS multisub HighCode" (about 6GB) encode soon.
