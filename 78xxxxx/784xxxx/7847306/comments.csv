Each episode will have a story arc from Sam and built around that will be characters and sketches, some in Sam’s ‘world’ and others in a world of their own. It will be set in the suburbs but is not a riff on suburban life, Australia is the suburbs and their cream brick endlessness provide a great backdrop for our odd little world.

This show should be submitted to the Library of Congress as evidence that Australians are:  a) nuttier than squirrel shit.  b) totally wasted on a deliriant similar to datura.  "
