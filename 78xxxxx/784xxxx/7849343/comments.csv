,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-23T08:01Z,"yw, mhtorrent; i appreciate the positive feedback."
,Oneiromancer12,2012-11-25T03:31Z,"Awesome post as always!

It would be pretty keen if you could upload Mark Millar's Swamp Thing run."
,SplhcbPrime,2012-11-26T10:56Z,"@ oneiromancer12:  thanx for the comment; i'm glad u like. 

RE:  ur request...  i could post the files (issues 140 - 171 of volume 2) in a new torrent, but y don't u first try brodahisou's fantastically complete swamp thing torrent located here:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4971787/Swamp_Thing_v1-v4___Appearances 

if u r using the utorrent client, after u start the dl listed above, u can stop it; then, choose the files u don't want to download, and grab the rest.  (other torrent clients have this capability, too.)"

Avengers: Celestial Madonna "
,DragoMaster009,2012-11-30T02:54Z,"Sorry about the double post, but here are a couple more ideas:
Legends
Invasion
Kree-Skrull War
Kang Dynasty
Fatal Attractions/Bloodties"
