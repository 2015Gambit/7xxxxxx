SPECIAL THANKS
Our family and friends and all the fans, without whom we would never have done this in the first place. We'd like to thanks Ibanez for making amazing musical instruments and Musta Krakish because he is one bad-ass son-of-a-b**ch. We'd also like to thank all the metal and rock bands before us both locally and internationally for creating this culture and laying the path for us to follow.
