,vze2mp9g,2012-11-22T05:00Z,Is anyone seeding? I am unable to download this file and the others posted by murphy78. He is one of the most reliable user on TPB. I'm using uTorrent 3.2.1. I usually seed for 24-48 hours after the download.
,rajesh1215,2012-11-22T12:04Z,my confusion is that if I do not want the media center upgrade can this be installed as win 8 pro version with proper pro key or activator? or are you going to upload another version which only consist of win 8 pro 64 bit version?
,rajesh1215,2012-11-22T12:04Z,sorry wrong place

Just download the Activator (A video is included to show you how to activate). It Works, ignore comments. But, download Murphy's Windows 8 ISos as they are more recent and maintain the integrity as per the MSDN ISO Source.

@  'hikari114' - Down Load this Torrent :

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7786020/Windows_8_AIO_16-in-1_%28Final_Build_9200%29___Permanent_Activator

Select to download only the 'Permanent Activator' ( After loading the torrent in uTorrent, Click on ""Files"" Menu at the Bottom Left of the uTorrent Progeam . You will get a list of files included in the Torrent), Uncheck all other files except ""Permanent Activator"". This will enable you to download only the checked file ie ""Permanent Activator"".. It is about 120 MB in size and should not take 30 minutes to 60 minutes (Depending on the speed of your Internet Connection) to download. It is a tested Windows 8 tester (ignore all the negative comments in the comments box).

But, for genuine, untouched and latest  Windows Torrent prefer 'murphy78' as I always prefer him for original MSDN ISO source."
