,doomdemon,2012-11-20T20:49Z,Why upload this? Anyone can download 1.08 pirated or not. Crack Sunset Invasion and upload that if you want to do something actually useful.

,rallybanner,2012-11-26T00:02Z,"Does anyone know where the directory for CK2 is supposed to be? Everytime I try and run the patch it says ""Crusader Kings 2 is not installed"". I've been moving the folder all around trying to find the right directory for it."
,doomdemon,2012-11-28T00:04Z,@rallybanner just use the check for update button in the ck2 launcher
,rallybanner,2012-11-28T05:02Z,"Thanks for the response doom, but it still didn't work. Once it finished downloading I clicked run and it said the same thing."
,doomdemon,2012-11-30T01:04Z,@rallybanner install this http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7406041/Crusader_Kings_2_v.1.06___Sword_of_Islam_DLC then http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7743592/Crusader_Kings_2_-_patch_1.07___Legacy_of_Rome then try the update
,rallybanner,2012-11-30T02:39Z,"@Doomdemon Alright, thanks. I believe those are the two I already have, but I'll try it and post results."
,rallybanner,2012-11-30T05:00Z,"Alright. That worked. Not sure how I messed up my other installation. Thanks, Doom."
