I present to you a legitimately bought copy of "The Witcher 2 - Enhanced Edition" from Good Old Games.com. One of the aforementioned sites' policies is to avoid using any kind of DRM, meaning that you don't have to download a crack or use a serial. It comes with a launcher that will automatically patch your game to the latest version.


Seed and enjoy! :-)
