Photoshop Shapes Tutorials :
----------------------------

In anticipation of uploads of  Packs of 'Photoshop Shapes', I am  uploading  this 

torrent of Tutorials for Photoshop Shapes.


The File Extension for Photoshop Shape File is .csh. So if you see a .csh file 

Extension, you may be sure that it is a Photoshop Shape File.



Photoshop Shapes offer a wide scope and possibility of livening up your Photoshop 

Experience as well  as enable you a method for vector drawing within Photoshop.


Pen Tool is one of the tools to draw Custom Shapes within Photoshop. This Tool 

also has a Steep Learning Curve. But, if mastered, you stand Heads and Shoulders 

among equals. I am also enclosing a Tutorial Folder for Pen Tool, separately in 

this torrent. Pen Tool mastery can also be worthy of using within Adobe 

Illustrator and CorelDRAW both of which also contain Pen Tool.



I will be uploading  about  435 MB (UnZipped Size) of Photoshop Shapes in 

different packs (Total 6 Packs)



UnRar the downloaded file and place the .csh files in :

C: - Program Files - Adobe - Adobe Photoshop CS X  - Presets - Custom Shapes,  Folder.


You can assess these shapes from within Photoshop by --

1. Pressing the Keyboard  u  key, 

2. A Horizontal Bar above in Photoshop will display the parameter for the Shape 

Tool

3. On the Horizontal Bar, you can assess the Shapes by Pulling down the "Shapes" 

Menu which will display all the Shapes from .csh files placed in the above folder.

4. Drag the desired shape on to the canvas. You can then manipulate it .

(You can customise , Add, Remove Shapes by using the  the Menu by clicking on a 

small triangular sub Menu from within the above mentioned Shapes Menu).

 These shapes are widely compatible from Photoshop 7 to CS6 and Windows OS - 98 to 

Win 8.


I have also included a Program  "Vector Magic Desktop Edition.V 1.14", Which is an 

excellent  independent "Vectorisation' Software.


THE  UPLOADS ARE ESSENTIALLY FOR 32  BITS SYSTEMS AND WINDOWS OS ONLY. THEY MAY OR 

MAY NOT WORK ON 64 BITS OR OTHER OS.
