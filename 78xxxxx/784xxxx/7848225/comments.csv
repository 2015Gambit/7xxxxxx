,harbrackgrad,2012-11-22T08:37Z,Maybe I'm doing something wrong but all I see are questions.  No answers at all.  How about you guys?  I'm using Stanza with the .epub
,SectorVector,2012-11-22T13:51Z,"The ePUB is good. Am using FBReader.

Quoting from the book ...

First question in Chemistry:

,harbrackgrad,2012-11-22T19:27Z,Figured it out.  Neither Stanza nor Nook Simple Touch have the fonts to handle the handwritten answers.  Converted .epub to .PDF and am good to go.
,SectorVector,2012-11-23T17:25Z,Good. Happy ROFLing. :)
