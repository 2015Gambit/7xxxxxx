IMDB...
Language: Mandarin

Can anyone confirm English dub (language)...?"
,tapp3r,2012-11-22T09:54Z,Why the hell would you want English dub? Just get subtitles you tit. 
,Lartzzz,2012-11-22T13:03Z,"@Hanne70 - If you use your skills from school, if you actually went to school, the info on THIS PAGE can tell you ""*Audio 1 English/Bit Rate..: DTS/755 Kbps"" and ""*Audio 2 Chinese/Bit Rate..: DTS/755 Kbps"", aswell as the title states ""Dual audio"". Thanks for letting me be a minor ass this morning. Much appreciated."

We said bro, is this how you treat your younger generation? Because if that is the case, then I feel sorry for you, if not .. well then you have a condition there son !
Insted of replying straight, why do you have to TROLL?
cAN'T CONTROL YOUR TONGUE?
Go see a doctor.
& thanks for letting me be a SMART ASS today night !
Much appreciate it !"
,Lartzzz,2012-11-22T18:20Z,"@openhouse - Np, glad to be able to help ! And i didn't think Hanne70 was a younger generation since his nickname suggests he's born in 1970. But still, glad we could both be asses today. Let's make this an annual assday. And mainreason for trolling? This discussion right here ! :p .. Since trolling also is a form of fishing i think it's hilarious."
