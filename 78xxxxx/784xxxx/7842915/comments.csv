I think SCYPT may update the activator with a new key soon.  We'll have to wait and see.  You can keep checking his stuff at:

,murphy78,2012-11-21T13:10Z,You can use a usb flash drive or a dual layer dvdr.
,murphy78,2012-11-21T13:14Z,"In the future, every one of these x64 language support releases will be too large to fit on a normal 4.37GiB dvdr (4.7GB).  Right now, some of them still fit, but not many of them.  If you prefer, you can install the nov13 pro english or nov18 pro wmc english and then add language your preferred language.  It won't set your computer's language for non-user related stuff, but as long as everyone who uses your computer reads english well enough to set up their primary language, you should be ok.  You can just click my name and look for those releases."
