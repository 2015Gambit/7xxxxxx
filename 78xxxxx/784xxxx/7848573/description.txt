The designers are given the task of making dresses for 6 lovely young ladies who are going to their school formal.But not everyone will have the same amount of money to spend on fabric for this challenge - there are envelopes with different amounts on them and last week's winner will allocate these amounts to their fellow designers!
 Not only that, their clients will accompany them to Rathdowne to help choose fabric.This week it's not just about blowing the judges away, but their clients too!Who will make the cut and who will be out?


A big thank you to all original cappers and posters
