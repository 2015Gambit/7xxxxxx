,helloThisIsMike,2012-11-21T07:04Z,"For those that had problems getting pass the first intro screen (the multicultural team one), I found a way to get past it. I'm guessing this problem occurs with those with Nvidia Optimus. I right clicked AssassinsCreed3.exe and ran it with High-Performance graphics. Before the game starts, I right clicked anywhere else to bring up the standard Windows dropdown and I left the dropdown OPEN. This will trigger AC3 to load in the background, and this time, will get pass the intro screen."

,bandrizzle,2012-11-21T22:55Z,OK. i just fixed my own problem. for some reason the game was reading my razer nostromo as a controller of its own and wouldnt let me look at or set any controls. so i switched it to mouse/keyboard and now it is working perfect WITH my nostromo and all. thank you all very much for this game :)

I have never used Theta before (mostly Skidrow or EZ, but they've dropped the ball on this one) but you absolute had the most simple installation ive ever had (which is saying alot to Skidrow's regulars).  

The Game saved just fine and I just rebooted my comp to test the save file.  Worked fine.

The only complaint I have so far is that the v-sync is delayed at times and there's no settings to fix this (any ideas?).  This us a small detail, especially since the other 2 cracks for this arent working -- whether due to choppy frame-rate or no graphic settings showing up.

,WoIfbanes,2012-11-23T19:32Z,"Basically, this is just the singleplayer game.  The multiplayer was removed which explains the 7.7GB over the other 15GB torrents.

Installation is the same as other games, there's probably a crack or something.  But, with THETA releases I rarely have to worry about it.

I'd say if you have problems with something your best bet would be to make sure you got no corrupted files, so force re-check your torrents.  If all is fine, reinstall the game.  If that doesn't help, make sure your computer can run the game and has all the necessary programs to run it.  And lastly, if you're not sure why it's not running, find out something specific about your problem and search if anyone has had that problem and has overcome it.

Also, asking here you most likely won't get your answers, you're rarely the only one with your problem so just go searching away."

If you're having problems with frame rate and can't seem to get a fix, the only thing i can recommend is connecting your PC to a 1080p TV and changing the picture mode to dynamic, as it draws more frames through the TV's processor. I haven't researched it enough to know if it's totally true but it seems to work a treat for me.

,YawnGG,2012-11-28T20:03Z,Horrible game. Lots and lots and lots of talking.. after sifting through like 30 minutes of bullshit talking and walking around I was finally going to get to a real battle! For some unexplained reason my screen went extremely blurry and i couldn't make anything out. I do not recommend wasting your time with this.

I heard disabling scaling (right click, properties, compatibility) may solve your problem."

,jl28922,2012-12-01T03:02Z,"origonaki

I don't know what your specific problem is, try googling and downloading that missing dll, and any other missing dll's that pop up, and dump them into your installation folder"
,tall70,2012-12-01T11:08Z,Runs very smooth at high on my little dual core 4g ram and 560ti. Nice work with all that movement in there.
,tall70,2012-12-01T11:22Z,@origonaki I'm assuming you not trying to run this on XP. Min req. are calling for Vista so it looks like that file is part of directx10 as well. Search for it in your windows folder.
