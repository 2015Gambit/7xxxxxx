,dahaka47,2012-11-22T08:34Z,"WORKS PERFECT on Windows 7 (x86). If you are on Windows 8, that's yhour problem, dumb bitches. It is WELL KNOWN by now that most cracks DON'T WORK on Windows 8. If you upgrade to Windows 8, get ready for no games. It isn't anyone's fault but YOURS."
,avarcis,2012-11-22T09:04Z,"For those having issues with DX11 error:
1) Update your videocard drives. 
2) After that go to their website and install beta version drivers on top of that.
3) Instal system updates. I realise that it doesnt sound like it should help, but it does.
4) Reboot
6) At this point my DX11 error changed to a different one
7) Install steam. Don't have to login or create an account, but have to download and install it. Again, I know that this doesn't sound like it should help but strangely enough it does.
8) Enjoy the game."
,Celarion,2012-11-22T09:05Z,"It installs just fine, doesn't ask for cd-keys and doesn't redirect to survey sites like some people suggest but it also doesn't launch. 

For me it doesn't launch because of the ""buddha.dll issue"" while others report ""DirecX 11 fatal crash"".

Either theres is an issue with cracked files or the game itself. Maybe it doesn't work on vista x64 for some reason."
,riahc3,2012-11-22T09:06Z,The thing is what about the CD key; The NFO says nothing but this may be a different installer....

When you get ""hitman5 stopped working"" window press the small arrow in the lower left corner to show more information about the issue. It will name the module responsible for the crash.

Probably should just wait couple of days for another crack or official patch. Either way it looks like a compatibility issue."

Update your system too. Otherwise check what I posted on the previos page of comments and follow it to the letter. I had the same problem as you did at one point, and it solved it.

@Sugamwtoxristo 
Check the previous page comments. updating your drivers is not enough. Also gotta update the system and install steam. Only then it will work."

,BlurKiller,2012-11-22T12:39Z,"@Nezmaroth
Well its unlikely you will find one soon, since this release was made to install without one. I would rather download this than keep waiting for a key that may or may not work.
Besides, its not as bad as everyone is saying, it took me just 8 hours to get to 98% now :)"
,brownnotesuicide,2012-11-22T12:42Z,"@Nezmaroth the one you downloaded is fake/scam, download from either HeroMaster or extremezone...they are both the exact same installs, and they are both legit.

,riahc3,2012-11-22T12:46Z,"Thanks to all of those who are clearing it up....

Folks this is a different install: I downloaded the old 12GB torrent as well so we are just going to have to download this one again. This install does NOT ask you for a key. You simply install it, copy the crack files over and done. You do NOT need a cd key to play this game. I repeat you do NOT need it. Just download this torrent and thats it."

,Morphesto,2012-11-22T16:50Z,"CRASH TO DESKTOP,BLACK SCREEN SMALL FIX:

I´ve tried this torrent, black box and mechanics (forgot the name)

Black box works better then mechanics but the problem remains. As soon as I enter the city my problems occurs. Either the game crashes or the graphic is glitchy.

What you can do to make it less worse:

- Go to documents, assiassins creed folder, press the ini.file. Change the vertical sync from 1 to zero. Now the game runs a bit smoother.

If u have a gtx 500(70,80) series card like I do u will probably not get it to work due to the direct X 11 is effed up on most of those cards. 

U can try to increase the voltage from 1000 to 1025 on the gtx 570 and from 1035 to 1050 on gtx 580.

These advices will probably not make your problems go away but I hope they help you a bit. I, myself will wait for an update of the game and then try again because I´ve given up trying to make the game work properly...

And ofcourse my comp is above the spec recommendations if anyone wonder."

There are two different versions of this on here by skidrow. One is 11Gb the other is 14Gb. (there is a repack too but im not counting that one. Its 12Gb btw). The smaller is (apparently) the standard game and the larger is the premium version. Hope that clears things up for ya.

@ blnc9949
Could be that there are two exe's that can be run. One that runs in dx11 other in dx9. Im not sure as I have not installed this yet. If you dont have a card that can run Dx11 then that might be why it is not working for you and that might be the problem in which case run the other exe.
Anything else is anybodys guess im afraid.

@ sirstevealot
Had similar problems with a few games but never found out the problem. The only way I managed to get some of them to work was by formatting my hd and starting on a fresh os. Might have something to do with the installation and removal of programs messing (adding, moving or removing) with key files. Maybe some really good system maintenance would help without starting a new. Any info on that would be appreciated from anyone that knows."

I've played the first couple levels. The game is fun albeit kind of slow. If you want a run and gun action type of game then this game doesn't appear to be much like that. Atleast at this point. It's been slow, methodical, and demands a lot of patience & planning.

First go where your game is installed, right click on the game's folder and make sure ""Read-only"" is not selected. This will make the game start but it will crash when trying to start a mission.
Now for the second part, install Steam. It apparently works for some reasons."

Check for and Install all the latest drivers you've got!

Install the game(disable your internet if you have Steam already installed or log out of Steam so it doesn't ask for a product key). 

After it's done, copy all the crack and paste it in the installation directory.. 

If you don't have steam installed then download & install it from Steam Website and let it update. After it's done, don't log into or create an account!  

Run the game!  

(P.S.: Windows 8 is not officially supported, if it runs then it's your luck if not GTFO and install W7 noobs)

(dont live in a city, theres only one EB games store) so i decided to get the digital version from cj's cd key store. which fucked me over and gave me a duplicate key, to which im STILL waiting for now and soon to be the 3rd day for a resolve of either another key, or a refund. So i came here to download it. So excuse me for not passing around good fucking manners when i have to leave in one day for 12 weeks. i wanted to get a couple days in on this or at least fucking 1 day? and instead ive been uploading more then im downloading for what's going to be 3 days soon, to what seems an international cluster fuck of selfish fuckwits who only care about there own little life. So at this rate, i'll be leaving and the game will be lucky to be on 70%, cj's cd key store will have stitched me 40 dollars and i'll probably come back to post 1 final fuck you message. "

,charzz,2012-11-26T02:48Z,Thanks for those vista users who have confirmed this won't run on Vista. So for those of who wonder why it's not working that is the problem. I just saved myself heaps of bandwidth by not downloading this. I may just end up buying the game. That way I can enjoy the full features and multiplayer.

My guess is noone really knows what they're talking about and if that is the case then you are all getting passed the error by pure coincidence. I have steam, tried in both online and offline, with game blocked in firewall and trusted in MSE(antivirus), restarted steam and computer, updated my up-to-date drivers, ran as admin, updated my up-to-date directx.

1. Make sure HMA.exe (in your game directory) has 'Run this program as an administrator' ticked under the 'Privilege Level' option.
2. If it still doesn't work, try right clicking on the Hitman Absolution folder (which IS your game's directory) and check if 'Read-only' is ticked under 'Attributes', if it is, untick it."

,razorwindmo46,2012-11-30T13:30Z,This game started out as download only. Thats why it was available before the physical dvd was sold.

,olepeasy,2012-11-30T15:33Z,"ataata477 is a retard. this is clean! no virus..
but if you guys wont some bad news, you cant choose weapons/equipment in the campaign. you can choose replay missions in contract modus(where you can choose weapons) but Contract modus does not work with this torrent :/ so you cant choose weapons in the game..

the game works perfect, only thing that wont work is contract modus"

I'm running the lastest drivers and the previous one before that. Keep in mind I am using the beta drivers.

@ahmedkmsheesh

You might be right. I'm running a GTX660TI"
,teh1buck,2012-11-30T21:46Z,"Works perfectly. I had an issue with it crashing on start up, but it was easily fixed.

1. Download Absolution and Install
2. Copy ALL of the Skidrow folder to the Installation Folder
3. Made sure Windows Firewall blocked the HMA.exe
4. At this point, I couldn't play due to immediately crashing
5. Installed Steam, restarted PC
6. Opened HMA.exe and it worked perfectly!"
,razorwindmo46,2012-12-01T02:13Z,Doesn't work

,Deathtrap668,2012-12-02T14:03Z,@KKKDownlow - That is the most ignorant statement I have ever read. To say that a high end game is meant to be played on a console and not a low end computer. Consoles are low end computers. Any decent PC is better than any console. I haven't turned any of my consoles on since I built my PC because they just don't compare to my PC. The graphics and overall gameplay experience is just fantastic on my PC compared to any console that I have ever played on. It's not even really comparable.
