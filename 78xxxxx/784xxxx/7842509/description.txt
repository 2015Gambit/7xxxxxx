After Hours

In the aftermath of a disastrous "Meet the
Parents" dinner, a bickering Castle and
Beckett are sent to retrieve the only
witness to a murder. But when they get
ambushed, they're forced to take the
witness on the run. Stranded in the middle
of the night in a bad part of town, with no
phone, badge or gun, Castle and Beckett
must find a way to protect him from a team
of mobsters who want him silenced -- that
is, if they don't kill each other first
