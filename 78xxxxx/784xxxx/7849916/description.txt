Quality is reasonably good considering DVD was 10 years old
Original AR was 2.25, 720x320 But just didn't look quite right
I recently DL Nhance James Bond Torrent, This movie was missing
And the ones availabe weren't very good so i decided to encode it to Mp4
Even Yifys 500Mbs one had a lot of floating pixels, And he usually does a pretty good job.
Anyway Enough Bullshit.
Enjoy.
