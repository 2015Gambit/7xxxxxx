Act Cadenza Strife is a 2D fighter that uses characters from the "Tales of" RPGs.

Look up the Wiki for all the moves and instructions on how to use the online. Everything is all set up. Just hit the ACS Icon to play. You can copy the DLC folder stuff for new title screens and character icons, etc. Don't touch anything else though. This was in annoying to download via the wiki so I made a torrent. Seed!

I'm AggressionSsbb on YouTube I'm actually finishing the "Tales of" walkthroughs so the series has a complete guide. Sub me as thanks if you <3 me.
