,Bramdal,2012-11-21T12:03Z,Thanks a lot !
,Aoishiro,2012-11-21T12:09Z,"I've been holding back playing this since the 1st episode, now it's finally here? Thanks, i'm going to wait for a little while longer for the batch release so there's no save game transition problem."
,DffeD255,2012-11-21T12:11Z,"Of course its only episode 5 ... its only 730 mb so ? the other 4 episode together was 2.5 gb :)

Ty a lot Heromaster"
,sadistlex,2012-11-21T12:46Z,There are .ttarch files in there. How can i unpack them?
,AfroHero,2012-11-21T12:55Z,Kinda new here and I want to help the community now that I'm done downloading.. How do I seed? Does it just auto-seed when I'm done downloading?
,Vulenoy,2012-11-21T13:05Z,Doesn't work. Crashes when you start up the episode.
,iancortez,2012-11-21T13:11Z,Please confirm if works!!
,SSJASON,2012-11-21T13:36Z,"works perfect thanks heromaster.

Just drag and drop into the pack folder."
,DarkJediLV,2012-11-21T13:51Z,works with nosteam 1-4 release?
,nignug,2012-11-21T13:52Z,"@AfroHero Yes. Seeding occurs when the torrent is fully downloaded. And thanks for the upload Hero, this episode was a good one.



*****KINDA SPOILER*****

i hope the next season continue's clem's story now that ive played this ep"
,CharlieTea,2012-11-21T13:57Z,"@AfroHero Yes, it auto seeds. As a rule of thumb, seed torrents with more leechers than seeders and maybe big files for a 1:1 ratio. More is often unnecessary and a waste of bandwith.

Btw, welcome to the bay! That's a great attitude to begin with. If you feel like it, come back with some feedback about this torrent, if it works or not, etc. 

Happy pirating! :)"
,Infenix13,2012-11-21T14:04Z,Thank you so much HeroMaster for uploading everyone of these episodes. I've been downloading since the beginning and wanted to say I always will be :)
,phl00p,2012-11-21T14:12Z,"So, does anyone have any idea where the save location might be? I tried starting a new game in order to generate the new directory, but I still can't find it."
,YAOIS,2012-11-21T14:18Z,"I vouch for this torrent!

Episode 5 working (So far) as it should."
,iancortez,2012-11-21T14:28Z,"Works completely fine. NOW I SHALL PLAY :D

Thanks HeroMaster"
,Hugotoxx,2012-11-21T14:39Z,"Thanx HM , game is done and it is very powerfull one "
,CrazyFilmmaker,2012-11-21T15:22Z,"Obviously it's only 5th episode, because previous episodes 1-4 was about 2GB together in one release"
,FatBoxx,2012-11-21T15:25Z,"Just beat it with no issues at all. Damn what a sad episode, so good though"
,adriano2011,2012-11-21T15:37Z,"Thank You!
"
,Rbanh,2012-11-21T15:48Z,"Stop fucking spoiling it.

Also, Walkingdead101.exe has stopped working"
,Rbanh,2012-11-21T16:02Z,walkingdead101.exe is crashing at launch...
,someguy92,2012-11-21T16:30Z,"More Leech than seed... sure gonna take awhile. Crash problem, you guys put the files in the right folder? (WalkingDead105 goes into ""The walking dead/Pack"" with the other episodes), tried without internet connection? Firewall and Antivirus treating the .exe like a virus? I'm still on the download at roughly 70 to 110ko/s sometime 400 but the obvious reasons it crash might be the one I named."
,kyramas,2012-11-21T16:57Z,How do you use the saves from the previous episodes ?
,davidxdavidson,2012-11-21T17:34Z,"I'm lost just like kyramas. I can copy episode 5 to the folder where my other chapters are, but it doesnt recognize the saves"
,adonese12,2012-11-21T17:49Z,"thanx HeroMaster you're the best
downloading now"
,someguy92,2012-11-21T18:13Z,"It worked, thanks HeroMaster for this wonderful upload.

My save is able to detect the episode 5 and I can continue to play from where I left (Episode 1 to 4 completed)

All I had to do is put the folder WalkingDead105 in the pack folder of my game. Had no problem so can't really help more than what I said earlier except: I run it on a window 7 64 bits, my antivirus is Kapersky and the other 4 episodes were downloaded from NosTeam (All 4). I hope this kind of information along with my previous comment can help anyone to find out what is going on so they can also enjoy this last episode. "
,McMerda,2012-11-21T19:46Z,@AfroHero Arrg! it does me heart good to see new weblegs on the ol' Bay. keep a watch out for those Viacom skallawags and you'll fare nicely! 
,McMerda,2012-11-21T19:59Z,"the instructions are crap. ""copy the game in the drive?"" were they written by a 4 year old?"
,xxela,2012-11-21T20:12Z,"THANKS !!
works just perfect !"
,unreadable33,2012-11-21T20:44Z,Works great!!! Thank you so much for this release HeroMaster. 
,maicon_cs,2012-11-21T21:07Z,"wow it crashes when u start episode 5, and more, it deletes ur save game. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,EvilAsh34,2012-11-21T21:27Z,I'm having the same issue as a couple of other people. It doesn't seem to recognize my previous saves and is asking me to generate random decisions (or something very close to that) for previously skipped episodes. Not sure what the deal is. It works but is kinda useless since it can't read old saves.
,Redante,2012-11-21T21:49Z,Same problem :( Can't use my old saves.
,asdfkjjj,2012-11-21T21:49Z,"Didn't delete my save from ep 4,  just wont use it to start ep 5, only allows me to randomly generate character info, otherwise works and does show in the game as being installed, character transition doesn't work however."
,Redante,2012-11-21T22:17Z,"Solved save problem. Just rewind 4th episode to the final part, finish it and than you should be able to continue. It just takes 5 minutes."
,everx7,2012-11-22T00:59Z,"i didnt have the same problem as many of u did, with save files, i continued the game exactly from there where i finished episode 4, GREAT GAME going to buy the whole 5 episodes, becuase its that big :), if there could be more games like these, the end sucks a bit, but ull get over it, and sry for this little spoiler, but anyway ull play it through and will see for urselfs whatll happen :) HF im sure i did"
,Koca114,2012-11-22T01:12Z,@Redante OMG. Thank you so much. It works :)
,Redante,2012-11-22T01:28Z,"Yep. Definitely worth buying.
And there will be a second season next year."
,johnnyycyber69,2012-11-22T01:54Z,yaaay!!
,Vysera,2012-11-22T06:21Z,"Came up with ""walkingdead101.exe has stopped working"" after i pressed play and then closed, it ended up reseting all my settings to default and it's not showing up with any of my saves in-game? strangely though my saves are showing up in User>Documents>TeltaleGames>TheWalkingDead but the game doesn't seem to read them anymore! does anyone know how to fix this?"
,nignug,2012-11-22T10:42Z,"For you guys not able to load your save, this problem has existed since episode 2. When you finish episode 1-4 you need to let the game run through the credits at the end. if you exit early your save wont be complete."
,spacevart,2012-11-22T11:03Z,@nignug; dude don't put spoilers that's a real douchey thing to do. tell ur video game hopes and dreams to someone who cares.
,noidea963,2012-11-22T14:48Z,Awesome torrent no complications !
,soyuz16,2012-11-22T15:06Z,for clementine.
,asdfkjjj,2012-11-22T15:28Z,Waiting for credit to complete doesn't solve the issue.
,wgacaround,2012-11-22T16:21Z,To whoever can't play episode 5 with your old save: Try installing the complete pack (all 5 episodes) from RELOADED. Worked for me. 
,Maxery,2012-11-22T16:25Z,"Also got the savegame problem, hope there will be a solution!"
,RiverRaidII,2012-11-22T20:36Z,"Works like a charm. Just copy the PACK folder over the PACK folder in your game directory.

If you have the previous ^^no steam^^ torrent, your save games will be recognized.
"
,gino1965,2012-11-22T22:09Z,Thank you again!!!. Excellent.
,luksonije,2012-11-22T23:41Z,"Thanks man, great upload...
Advice to all WALKING DEAD  fans.. This is so brutal episode, the end is really sad and I will personally play only first four episodes. The fifth is to hard for my heart..."
,Leibritz,2012-11-22T23:59Z,"@luksonije : oh, do you need a hug?"
,formigaz,2012-11-23T00:29Z,can't wait to play this season finale! best Horror Interactive Movie Game since Phantasmagoria 2 ^^
,Monkeyateballs,2012-11-23T12:47Z,For any body who has problems with the save feature make sure you go to where the save game file is and copy and paste prefs.props to your default file inside the pack folder hope that helps people. The game is amazing just a little way to short wanted more! 
,sam970605,2012-11-23T15:05Z,"hey plz help

,Land_Shark,2012-11-24T06:28Z,"Ok I've done what everyone has suggested in the comments, but I can't get the game to start anymore. I want copied over everything  was supposed to, installed the episode, and now the game won't work at all.

,Kartnisch,2012-11-24T09:48Z,What do i do with the fucking TTARCH files its driving me insane i cant get it to work.
,superalieninvasion,2012-11-25T05:14Z,"Had the same problems as many here. I tried some of the suggested comments, but no luck.

But I managed to find a solution from google search. Thanks goes to Siezemore in the telltalegames forum.

Note: If you want to skip the hassle of save files not being recognized, copy and put in episode 5 before playing this awesome game."
,Aintnevernot420,2012-11-25T10:31Z,@Redante - thx bro - you got me all fixed up - appreciate it.
