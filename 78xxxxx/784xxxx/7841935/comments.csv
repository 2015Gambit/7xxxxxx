,H2oDragon,2012-11-19T21:39Z,"The IMDB says: C.R.A.Z.Y. 2005  Drama. Extraordinary lives of ordinary people in search of love and happiness - that's the premise of ""C.R.A.Z.Y"", a family drama unlike any other.  

I de-muxed it and re-muxed it (whatever that is) and worked with the IFO files in the Video_ts file, and got it down to 595mb, as an .avi (it was 7.49gb!) And I did it all for you! I haven't even watched it yet, but the IMDB gave it a 7.9 out of 10. It must be a good movie. It is in French-Canadian, with English subtitles hard-coded.

,H2oDragon,2012-11-20T01:03Z,"Sorry everyone. I threw away the movie, which was a video_ts. I saved my one which, it turns out, was not the movie, but an interview of the author, and some advertising for another movie by the same author.  Now I have to find and download the movie again, all 7.49gb of it, and start again. But at least you have the interview. SORRY."
