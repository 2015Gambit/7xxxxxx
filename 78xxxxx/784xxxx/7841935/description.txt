The IMDB says: C.R.A.Z.Y. 2005  Drama. Extraordinary lives of ordinary people in search of love and happiness - that's the premise of "C.R.A.Z.Y", a family drama unlike any other.  

I de-muxed it and re-muxed it (whatever that is) and worked with the IFO files in the Video_ts file, and got it down to 595mb, as an .avi (it was 7.49gb!) And I did it all for you! I haven't even watched it yet, but the IMDB gave it a 7.9 out of 10. It must be a good movie. It is in French-Canadian, with English subtitles hard-coded.
