As always, enjoy and seed back"
,smurf212,2012-11-22T07:35Z,"Did you rob my release and claim it as your own? lol Identical file size down to the byte, identical filename.  And still no known official scene release according to http://wii.ds-scene.net/?s=releases

Seems a bit questionable to me...."

Nay, I did not. Here is a more reliable source for the latest releases (I'm afraid with the launch of Wii U there won't be too many more):
http://www.abgx.net/wii_releases_date.txt

it is the same size because you probably used wii game manager instead of wii backup manager to create the wbfs file, which produces a slightly smaller file. i have no doubt yours functions probably identically, but they are different dumps."
,smurf212,2012-11-23T06:42Z,"Lol, I don't actually care either way, but I didn't use Wii Game Manager nor Wii Backup Manager to make the wbfs, I just ripped it directly on my Wii and copied the file from my HDD haha.  Ultimately just glad I could help out in some way considering I've been a leech all my life so far :3

I'm even writing a walkthrough for the game on GameFAQs look at me go! :D"
,Masta_Zone,2012-11-24T20:54Z,"Hi ppl.

,winkywoowaa,2012-11-25T12:15Z,"@ masta-zone....try creating a new folder and putting the wbfs file in it..then see if wbfs manager can locate it...failing that download wii backup manager...see if that works, hth good luck dude"
,dman1965,2012-11-25T14:27Z,Thanks hobbitgamez you always seem to get the latest and greatest! Thought the wii was going the way of the dinosaurs...LOL
,Masta_Zone,2012-11-25T18:17Z,"@ winkywoowaa i tried Wii Backup Manager and it worked. Thanks bro, you have been most helpfull."
,Sivos,2012-11-25T19:53Z,"I put this on my Wii using a USB and every time I click it, the whole thing freezes.  I can click any other game just fine, but this one freezes.  Any idea how to fix this?"
,Sivos,2012-11-25T21:29Z,"Never mind, I figured it out; one of the other games was causing the problem.  I guess it was competing or something."
,skinlabel,2012-11-26T10:58Z,"Hi HobbitGamez, can you upload 'Little King's Story' as a favour?? Thank you very much!!! Love all your uploads!"
