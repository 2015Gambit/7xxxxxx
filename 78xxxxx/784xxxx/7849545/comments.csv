,steveoski,2012-11-29T01:43Z,I had to register just to say THANK YOU FOR THE AVI! I can not tell you how grateful i am for it! I am so tired of .MKV. Sure its up and coming and a great container but MS and XBOX dont support it! So until they do Screw .MKV keep the .AVI or .MP4 a coming!!! You rock!!!!
