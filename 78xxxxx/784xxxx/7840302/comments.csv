Since most of you are not playing the game (ie, download it to 100% and immediatly close their bittorrent client, not seeding a single byte of it), I'll have to take measures if you continue this way. I'll be seeding this a few more days. If within 3 or 4 days I am still the only seeder, this torrent is going to hell.
Do not download this until you are disposed to share. Stop being selfish little punks.

You've been warned."
