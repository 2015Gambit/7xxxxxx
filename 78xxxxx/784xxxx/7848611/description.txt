A Feast for Dragons - AFfC and ADwD combined together in an ultimate Song of Ice and Fire book. 

Book 4 and Book 5 from the hit saga A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin are one and one only storyline that was divided in two parts due to the size and the speed of Martin's writing. 

A Feast for Crows (book 4) covers only the south and west of Westeros. While A Dance with Dragons covers the East of Essos and the North of Westeros. 

This geographical divide creates a burden on the readership that is really disturbing. And... let's face it, what happens in the South and West is not at all as interestting as what happens in the North and East (at least not when read alone). 

But now, that the two books are finally published, it's possible to read the two storylines finally combined, with the minimum hassle and preserving the surprises and other things that shouldn't be spoiled.

That's exactly what this ebook is doing, simply putting the chapters from AFFC and ADWD together in the best fucking possible reading order ! 

And damn, it's good.

Enjoy !
