,kcomp1863,2012-11-22T04:18Z,"Oh yeah...I forgot to say thankyou for uploading this, cause I missed the second half....but don't understand why it's not seeding?"
,mr2old,2012-11-22T06:00Z,"Can you please also upload as .mp4 files ? I tried to convert but then audio was off and would really like to be able to stream these through my Xbox 360.

Otherwise, great work and many thanks for uploading."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-11-22T17:11Z,"DO NOT PANIC as unlike the big groups who stop seeding in a day or two, I seed all my torrents for at least 2 months."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-11-22T19:02Z,@mr2old: I do not know how to make an MP4 but you should be able to Google it and find freeware that will do the job. MKV is just a container and the file inside is already an MP4 but the audio is a separate file also.  TRY HERE (http://www.videohelp.com/). Hope this helps.
,Tattybogle,2012-11-23T16:40Z,"Make a copy of the file (as a backup) then simply change the ending from mkv to mp4.

It works with vlc at least!"
,9fatcats,2012-11-24T23:49Z,"Okay, two things...Handbrake is a good free mkv to mp4 converter @  Second this film (both episodes) is available for free for a limited time (12/04/2012) @ PBS Video online .
Hope this helps...thanks to thetorrentlord for the up. :)"
