,DST1962,2012-11-27T16:24Z,Works great. Just follow the steps as written.
,Bkp666,2012-11-27T19:04Z,"Well I have a problem.. When trying to copy the files from Crack to Start8 directory I get ""The action can't be completed because the folder or a file is open in another program"" 
And I removed Start8 from the Task Manager "
,Bkp666,2012-11-27T19:34Z,"^ Problem solved, I used Unlocker to unlock the Start8 folder and copied the crack and now it works"
