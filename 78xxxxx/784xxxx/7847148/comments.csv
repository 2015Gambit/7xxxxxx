,Avenager,2012-11-23T23:44Z,"I have a question, this is best quality, so this version hasn't fps bugs? Like only up to 30 fps? I read somewhere that bad quality of crack causes descent of fps (in my case it's about 30 fps but when i turn my hero in other direction it's 19) So, bad crack causes descent of fps or crack have nothing to do with it? 
I'll give you my Pc specs, maybe it helps. I have four core processor 3.0Ghz (AMD), 4GB ram and graphic card Sapphire (Radeon) HD 4850 with 512 mb of vram.  Most of games I can play on high or full details on 45-60 fps. Thanks for any help and sorry for my english. (It's from school. ;p)"

,myname432,2012-11-25T14:16Z,"Hey, I pre-ordered the AC 3 game, and got this copy after I hand't recieved mine 2 days after release. I've gotten really far but when I installed my legit copy uninstalling this one and supposedly keeping my saves, now I magically don't have my save from before when trying to play singleplayer. Do you guys have the saves in a different spot, or did the uninstallation just **** up with not deleting my saves and i'm screwed now?"
,wyvern14,2012-11-26T05:17Z,"i know im gonna sound like a total noob, but how do you install this crack? i put the files into the games folder and ubisoft still fucks me up..."
,virtualmatrix258,2012-11-26T12:18Z,"Runs great! Downloaded quicker than the skidrow upload, about 2 hours. Been playing for 8 hours straight, no crash, no FPS drops, although I did have to underclock my GTX 580 to 630MHz for smooth gameplay but this year devs do no know how to code for the 500 series for some reason. Great crack, great game, great upload, thanks EZ."
,Soladarius,2012-11-28T00:29Z,"Guys, I and other people who used the Uplay-cracked version to play got screwed today and need some help from you. 

Ubisoft released a new updat that render that crack useless, so I installed the Theta version and it's working fine, but my saves don't work on it.

I've run some tests and found out some stuff. The save folder for the Theta version is: C:Users\AppDataRoamingThetaOrbit54

I've found some different kind of saves throughout the versions. The Theta version uses files like this:
1.save
1.save.metadata
2.save
2.save.metadata

That's really different from the Skidrow version, which I couldn't find the save files, while Reloaded version uses ""save001.sav"".

If anyone's got the .save version, please upload it for us, we'd be totally grateful. I particularly got 'til the beginning of sequence 8, does anyone have that save file?"
