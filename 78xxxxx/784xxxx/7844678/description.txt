This is a collection of the works of Friedrich Nietzsche.  It includes all of Nietzsche's major works.  Most are in the Cambridge University Press editions.  Several books and essays on Nietzsche are also included, some for their quality and insight, others because they are representative of the (lamentable) orthodox Anglo-American academic approach to Nietzsche.
