English subtitles for Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922) For The Use of Those on A Night Flight




***** Please note that this is NOT a loyal translation of German to English. It is rather a free adaptation of available subtitles of the movie found on Internet intertwined with subtitles of the 1979 remake of the film by Werner Herzog.

As the title suggests this subtitle is mainly meant for a certain ritual of watching Nosferatu, which is on a night journey. However, this subtitle is carefully recommended for other nocturnal viewings. *****
