,wcott,2012-11-22T15:08Z,"Wicked awesome!
How about ""Cold Day"" -  the new Harry Dresden novel by Jim Butcher? I've just gotten the paper copy here at work (I work at a library)...a download should be forthcoming??"
,anubis7914,2012-11-22T20:55Z,"I second the 'cold day' request
the book comes out the 27th
it's been a long wait!
thanks so much"
,wcott,2012-11-22T22:17Z,"Hmmm - maybe it comes out earlier in Canada? Because I have it in my hot little hand right now, and there's no ""Don't display before..."" note."
