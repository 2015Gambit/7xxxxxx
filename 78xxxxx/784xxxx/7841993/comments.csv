,Darkilla,2012-11-19T23:05Z,this is the only crack that worked for me follow the instructions thanks a lot provecho now we just need a zombie mode fix :(
,Ptolomeii,2012-11-19T23:27Z,"Thanks! Did You play without crashes at least until the mission when Mason rescues Woods. With others cracks, the best result I had was the unhandled exception during this stage."
,mikekiuh47,2012-11-19T23:32Z,Finally this one worked !
,wtstalin,2012-11-20T00:04Z,"this one worked for getting the game to launch smoothly without the date fix.
HOWEVER, i still don't have voices"
,saifs1410,2012-11-20T01:15Z,"I have been trying all the cracks that came out on the internet from the day the game was launched and this is the ONLY one that worked perfectly...

Great work Steam006 and thanks for uploading provecho..

No need to change time zone or date or any bullshit... Just copy all the cracked contents into the game folder and voila..!!! No crashes, no voice issues or any other issues so far after playing for the past 1-2 hrs... :)

,ubextreme,2012-11-20T01:16Z,It's still crashing.. Why is there such a big problem with releasing a GOOD crack afterall?
,tonin_haggard,2012-11-20T01:48Z,"Still  crashing, i don't know tried 100 cracks tried reinstalling game, but when i get to i certain point it crashes... :O"
,hank266,2012-11-20T02:11Z,Best crack so far.
,Ptolomeii,2012-11-20T03:07Z,"This is the best crack I tried. Still crashing (sometimes), but only when I close the game. I am on the horses mission and really is playable until now. Thanks."
,rrikard,2012-11-20T03:40Z,this is the ONLY crack that got me past the opening sequence!! GREAT JOB provecho!!
,pbmyers,2012-11-20T04:24Z,"I keep getting a ""directx encountered an unrecoverable error, check the read me for possible solutions"" Anybody have a fix for this? I've updated all my drivers, but nothing seems to work."
,shmimbadad,2012-11-20T07:03Z,"the big question is: does this crack actually work with no crashes, ALL THE WAY THROUGH?

I've tried over a dozen different cracks, with varying degrees of success, and managed to get pretty far in. I can't get past the ""time and fate"" mission, though. there's like 6 points throughout that mission that it's crashed on me. Every time, if it doesn't crash at the first point, it will on one of them. It's getting extremely annoying repeating that mission, with the bullshit, stupid, poorly acted, cliched, sometimes-skippable-but-for-some-reason-not-always cutscene before it."
,shmimbadad,2012-11-20T07:21Z,"Aaaaaaand, it does not work any better. Still crashing at various points in the ""time and fate"" mission. Has ANYONE got a cracked copy to play through/past that mission yet? Is there not actually a single functioning crack of this game on all of the internet? I'm actually starting to think so. If that's the case, well damn. Good job activision, on your efforts to fight piracy. Whatever you did has been more effective the the most restrictive ""always online"" DRM programs ubisoft came up with. *golf clap*"
,savvas3000,2012-11-20T19:17Z,my game with this crack crashes at the mission 4 everytime
,savvas3000,2012-11-20T19:35Z,why the fuck all cracks crashesh either on 1st mission or the time of fate? any help is welcomed
,(hotrodder),2012-11-22T08:43Z,"I'M not having any crash's, been playing for about 3 hours now and completed a lot of missions,  works just fine, i just installed the skid-row release then this crack, created the dumps folder in steam, and that's it, only campaign though nothing else loads, but I'll say this the mission is really cool...."
,Yeezzy,2012-11-22T12:25Z,How do you make the dump folder on steam and how do we copy the files to black ops 2 install folder.
,rhino999,2012-11-23T21:58Z,"@Yeezzy
U just crate a dump folder in steam folder like any other . U then copy files from crack to black ops 2 folder"
,rbs49,2012-11-24T18:36Z,"Best crack ever so far I play.
Just follow the instructions guys and you will be able to play without crash or blackscreen."
,zeroeight,2012-11-25T15:39Z,"Why the fuck is Steam still involved in this crack when that defeats the purpose of this whole piracy situation.

The purpose of a crack is so that Steam DOES NOT need to be involved
"
,zeroeight,2012-11-25T15:56Z,"WTF is wrong with people when they upload shit.
Single player DOES NOT FUCKING REQUIRE MULTI-PLAYER files.

GREENLUMA is just as bad as that piece of shit software Tunngle that causes an i7 to bog down and lag like such ass. and regardless of what people try to say, Greenluma dumps both male & adaware on your computer.

I don't give a shit what anyone says you do not need LumaEmu.ini TO RUN single player.

First you defeat the purpose of a crack by still having to have Steam installed on your computer (Whether you use it is not the point) it doesn't belong on your computer to make ANY crack work. A crack is specifically made so that STEAM IS NOT INVOLVED.

Secondly, who the fuck are you to try and force multi-player onto people for SINGLE player.

Learn to upload things correctly you stupid fucking pretz.

Of yeah, and to anyone that tries getting on me about what this person did and people can semi-play this

FUCK YOU!"
,kbcao_,2012-11-26T01:35Z,100% work!! great! thanks provecho!!
,corcovacorcova,2012-11-26T03:49Z,"Didn't work. It says ""steam must be running to play this game"". Somebody knows what happen?"
,mrmouth,2012-11-26T04:32Z,"This is a no shit virus. There is no reason to have Steam installed until he adds a Steam file that prompts you to install it. The crack works, but he is stealing your info and accounts.

,philipe89,2012-11-26T13:17Z,dont work for me
,Omgwat,2012-11-26T19:15Z,"WTF! None of these cracks on this site work for me!!!! (P.S I'm not blaming the site for non-working cracks)

My Single player Won't even Start-up! (No, I am not having start-up crash, Just doesn't do anything when i click t6sp.exe)
Yet..t6zm.exe and t6mp.exe will!! 

How can they start up, but not single player!?!?

That Doesn't Make sense!!!

And zombies and multiplayer are useless until there is a crack for them.

There can't be anything Wrong with my comp I've done Everything right, i followed the install instructions perfectly!! 
Even if there was a problem then How Am i able to open Zombies and Multiplayer but not single player? 

I have never had any problems with any other games...Never had a problem with Skidrow, nosteam, etc Releases.

But this is by far the worst piece of shit I've download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*Calm* 
All I'm asking is for Someone to Upload a Proper working Crack... no shitty fixes no Work-arounds..

I Support the game developers..If i enjoy it i buy the game, if i don't i delete it.

BUT I CANT BLOODY DO THAT IF I CAN'T EVEN FREAKING OPEN THE DAMN GAME!!!!!!!"
,djdream-d,2012-11-28T18:25Z,"This is a VIRUS, after uninstall all cpu cores go to 100%, for solve the problem folow mrmouth link"
,rbs49,2012-11-30T23:17Z,"Yes this is a malware.
I formatted my windows atleast 8 times, sometime 2 times a day.
Fuck u idiot and I dont even think that this a malware I d/l Viking and think may this game file contains malware or something I uninstall and delete the whole game iso but I never think that this asshole is playing a game with all of us through this.
Fuck u provecho motherfucker son of a fucking whore bitch."
,brianxxx,2012-12-01T16:18Z,And this is exactly why you must learn to be patient and download items like this ONLY FROM VIP MEMBERS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!
,SLeePYG74,2012-12-02T00:44Z,Simple answer for all problems with this crack: do not download.
