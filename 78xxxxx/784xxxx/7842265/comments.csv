The 1957 EYE IN THE SKY is one of the first Philip K. Dick's books you should read if you still don't know this american writer. If I'm not mistaken, it was the first time that Philip K. Dick, in a novel, was treating the theme of the virtual realities.
Eight persons, while visiting the Bevatron, the only pure science-fiction element of the novel, are trapped in a time hole after having accidentally been hit by the Bevatron ray. They wake up in a world that at first is pretty much the same than the one they have just left but they soon realize that they are caught in a world entirely created by the phantasms of one of them.

One can like THE EYE OF THE SKY for numerous good reasons such, for instance, as the slight favour of Agatha Christie's "" and then they were none "" in it, the reader waiting anxiously for the next imaginary world to appear and the clues that will lead him to the identity of the new dreamer's name. One can also appreciate this book for its critique of the late fifties's american society : The Mc Carthy syndrome, the anti-communism parano誰a or the wave of the evangelism don't have the slightest chance under Philip K. Dick's cruel pen.

With this book, PKD revealed himself as the first class writer he will be during the sixties."
