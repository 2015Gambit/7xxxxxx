That is code for Abrams and Kripke are trying to decide if they should actually do a little work on the show, or if they should just keep counting their cash for phoning it in.

The ratings have been sliding quite quickly, but they started very high, and are still twice as high as anything else NBC has, so it will probably not be cancelled outright (will just see it's budget slashed)."
