I know this because 10.6.8 gives you an error incl. this information. DP8 doesn't run on earlier than 10.6.8. See web site. please post how to install or what I am missing. Thanks again!"

,Lexpero,2012-11-25T17:43Z,"It came to my mind what you mean with ""replace application"": Replace application in Digital Performer.app/Contents/MacOS
You may want to point this out. Most Mac user don't even know how to open the Application Package. (Right Click) Cheers, seems to work very well! Thanks again! "
