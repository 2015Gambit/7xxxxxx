- Danny : Truth. great game. but may be hard to download. i got lucky. overall great game based on ancient chinese history. around 150 to 220 ad. you play has the shu kingdom.
- Johninnit: Great. Best defence/strategy game I've come across - some real character, and since later updates it's way more stable too. would like to see a paid version without ads, but that's hopefully in the pipeline.
