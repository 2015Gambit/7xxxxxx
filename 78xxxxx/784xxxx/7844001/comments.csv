,aielmiel,2012-11-20T16:26Z,Iam using nvidia optimus..if iam using integrated graphics the game will run...if using nvidia the will get stuck at the beginning..is there any fix for this problem?
,moflowsmodope,2012-11-20T16:45Z,"For those wondering where the Theta saves are located its, 

C:UsersYOURUSERNAMEAppDataRoamingTheta

and save games from the Uplay crack is in ubisoft, C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launchersavegames

Put the save files from folder 54, in ubisoft saves, to Theta's 54 folder and it should work."
,benq20,2012-11-20T16:52Z,"It wont work with older saves. When I try to load, it says: ""Damaged save game"""
,sotos1992,2012-11-20T16:54Z,it doesnt work..its says damaged save file..fuck

,blue.dot,2012-11-20T16:55Z,My game freezes on first intro video...
,costandan,2012-11-20T17:02Z,How to change Language!? i  cant find the way inside menu give some assist with screen shoot or something
,Mathayus5,2012-11-20T17:30Z,After the first sentence (the one telling its based on team with cultural beliefes and bla bla bla) it freezes.
,Spiritios,2012-11-20T17:40Z,"Used RG Mechanics but after some problems I got to use theta. I have no 54 folder in savegames of Ubi Soft Launcher so I copied the 103 folder's stuff into the 103 folder of theta and it is damaged save game, is it something I can fix or restart the whole game? (this will suck)"
,aiantas97,2012-11-20T17:57Z,I've downloaded a russian AC3.Does anyone know how to download an english patch or something else?BTW THETA Crack works!
,mohdkyle,2012-11-20T19:24Z,I'm using an NVIDIA card. Freezes at the 'multicultural team' screen at the beginning. Others getting this too apparently. Any fixes?
,06158,2012-11-20T19:39Z,"THANK YOU.

I struggled for hours yesterday with cracked versions of ""uplay"" and none of them worked. This works. Again, Thanks!"

I downloaded this crack and copied over the localization.lang file over to where you installed AC3, and it changes the language to English"
,killr0y31,2012-11-20T21:11Z,Will someone let me know if the new crack improves the fps when they get to Boston. I would hate to copy the new crack just to find out its doing the same. I've got like 7hrs and would hate to start over for nothing.

,theamazingrapeman,2012-11-21T01:10Z,"Another worthless crack, freezes on launch."
,Eosphoros,2012-11-21T03:03Z,"The game launches then I get a black screen and have to open task manager to get back to my desktop where I see a window has popped up telling me that ac3sp.exe has stopped working. This is with a fresh install of uPlay and a fresh install of AC3 that only has the loclization.lang swapped out for English.

It shouldn't be a problem with my machine because I got the game to run and play for a couple of hours with the uPlay crack, but the uPlay crack wouldn't let me play after the first session. Started demanding a serial key.

If anyone can solve either of these issues so that I can get one of the cracking schemes working consistently I will be eternally grateful."
,awesomekiller123,2012-11-21T03:59Z,"Wait so all i have to do is download the game, find the game folder, and put everything inside the THETA folder into the game folder?  PS this torrent only took like 2 seconds NICE"

,wtstalin,2012-11-21T05:58Z,still no voices for me :(
,helloThisIsMike,2012-11-21T07:02Z,"For those that had problems getting pass the first intro screen (the multicultural team one), I found a way to get past it. I'm guessing this problem occurs with those with Nvidia Optimus. I right clicked AssassinsCreed3.exe and ran it with High-Performance graphics. Before the game starts, I right clicked anywhere else to bring up the standard Windows dropdown. This will trigger AC3 to load in the background, and this time, will get pass the intro screen."
,helloThisIsMike,2012-11-21T07:06Z,Leave the right-click dropdown OPEN so that the game will start in background.
,duke85,2012-11-21T22:31Z,"I've got the black screen/""ac3sp.exe has stopped working"" problem too -.-"
,LordFrips,2012-11-22T01:31Z,"*POSSIBLE SPOLIERS*- I am not sure if it is related to this crack or not... but on I believe act 4 of the game, when connor (the main character) is given the homestead book to look over to buy logs and what not right before the ships repair, the menu can not be clicked. So you can't complete the level even with key remapping. I am not sure if this is related to this crack or the old version of the game I had which was the early Russian version with the lang vile to make it english. Just wanted to know what would cause being stuck at that part like that, corruption or what not? Any ideas appreciated."
,tommycr,2012-11-22T07:01Z,i can play smothly but after 5 minutes of gameplay the game crashes because of d3d11.dll anyhelp?
,Bishop111,2012-11-22T10:41Z,Help pls. Have a problem in sequence 5 in the manor with the leger. Can not select the trade menu. Is it a version glitch? 
,hkrek,2012-11-22T13:14Z,"This crack works great with RG-Mechanics-Repack and you dont have to mess with that ubisoft luncher unplay stuff which is troublesome.
If u are still having problems with being stuck at first game subtitle screen, update ur Nvidia drivers to beta 310.61 version, they also improve ingame framerates. Have fun playing!"
,DrakeBaron,2012-11-23T00:01Z,"Thanks to this crack, i just lost 4 hours of gameplay and now i have to watch that stupid movie of William Miles narrating and play as fucking haytham for the fourth time"
