The pdf doesn't really work well though, it's formatted with very large text. ePub looks to be the same too, maybe it's formatted for smaller screens than an iPad?"

Hi, 

To answer your question about the PDF. I warned about it in the 2nd paragraph of my torrent description: 

------ QUOTE -----
Epub + Mobi + PDF
PDF is not retail, it's a conversion done with Calibre from the original Epub.
