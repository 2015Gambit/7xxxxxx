The bold futurist and bestselling author explores the limitless potential of reverse-engineering the human brain

Ray Kurzweil is arguably todayΓÇÖs most influentialΓÇöand often controversialΓÇöfuturist. In How to Create a Mind, Kurzweil presents a provocative exploration of the most important project in human-machine civilizationΓÇöreverse engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works and using that knowledge to create even more intelligent machines.

Kurzweil discusses how the brain functions, how the mind emerges from the brain, and the implications of vastly increasing the powers of our intelligence in addressing the worldΓÇÖs problems. He thoughtfully examines emotional and moral intelligence and the origins of consciousness and envisions the radical possibilities of our merging with the intelligent technology we are creating.

Certain to be one of the most widely discussed and debated science books of the year, How to Create a Mind is sure to take its place alongside KurzweilΓÇÖs previous classics which include Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever and The Age of Spiritual Machines.



Reviews:

It is rare to find a book that offers unique and inspiring content on every page. How to Create a Mind achieves that and more. Ray has a way of tackling seemingly overwhelming challenges with an army of reason, in the end convincing the reader that it is within our reach to create nonbiological intelligence that will soar past our own. This is a visionary work that is also accessible and entertaining.
--Rafael Reif, president, MIT
 
Kurzweil's new book on the mind is magnificent, timely, and solidly argued! His best so far!
--Marvin Minsky, MIT Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences; cofounder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab; widely regarded as the father of artificial intelligence
