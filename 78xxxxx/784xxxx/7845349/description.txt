Helen continues her advances towards Sam and Jerome warns him to keep his distance. Later, Sam walks in on Helen and Vivian. Helen makes Vivian leave so she and Sam can be alone. Meanwhile Dr. Crawford inspects the patients progress in Farmhouse and he's pleased with the results so far. Naomi has some news for Sam and it's not good. To get some perspective Sam has dinner over his old high school friend Mike's house. That night Sam has another dream about his mother.
