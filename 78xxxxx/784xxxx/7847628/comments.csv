-I downloaded zip file
-extracted all to sd card, to folder tomtom ( on my phone it is /mnt/sdcard/tomtom )
-installed aplication
-started tomtom app
-it starts OK, but then shows : no maps found

If the path on my phone already is /mnt/sdcard/ there is no need to change the metadata file?
When extracting zip. file there is about 15 duplicate files. What to do with those files- replace with newest ones, keep oldest ones or keep both files?

Please help, need to get it work! Phone- Sony xperia Neo
Thanks!"
