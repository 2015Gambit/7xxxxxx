,nignug,2012-11-22T03:26Z,Wow just a warning to fans of the Hitman series...they seriously fucked up this game. The game goes into this story that isn't interesting and has little to do with the last games. What a letdown :(
,Frostee,2012-11-23T00:18Z,What the hell do I put for product key?
,DamirAvdic,2012-11-23T16:19Z,"Is there GERMAN included ? :) 
Good speed"
