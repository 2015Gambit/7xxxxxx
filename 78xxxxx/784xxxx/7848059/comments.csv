,noonelovesme,2012-11-23T15:19Z,"NO, this is NOT real. I mean it's not the official dvd/br release. The main title and subtitles are with some kind of russian characters written... And imho the pic is not br nor dvd quality just some kind of retail (or just very bad compression). And at last but not least i think something with the audio is also wrong, it sounds like they were in a box.

short: NOT REAL.
