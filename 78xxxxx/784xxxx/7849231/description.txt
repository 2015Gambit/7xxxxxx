This is the senior project of four students at DeVry University studying Game and Simulation programming. 


In 2012 mankind celebrated as the verge of computer science reached a high point with the creation of hive mind technology. The new technology was developed by Cynex; a leader in the robotics industry. 


Specializing in industrial robotics, Cynex created over the next 3 years Environmental Reconstructing Machines (ERMs or terraforming robots) in hopes of reversing the damage mankind had done to the planet over the years. 


While mankindΓÇÖs intentions were noble; the Cynex ERMs calculated mankind was the source of the damage produced on the Earth and began systematically wiping out the human race. 300 years later mankind struggles on the brink of extinction. 

Our hero Ryan must fight to survive as the ERMs get closer and closer to completely terraforming Earth.
