It creates another explorer.exe or some shit and everytime you launch a game/application it shuts down. And when you restart/shutdown your computer you get BSOD.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND USE THIS CRACK, THETAS CRACK IS THE ONE THAT REALLY WORKS!"

,Joha1992,2012-11-21T19:33Z,"@sammemannen

You are retarded... no AV program and you wonder why your PC gets BSOD?

@Gh0stNet Will this crack work with this version: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7839514/Assassins_Creed_III_RePack-RG_Mechanics ? Also I would like to ask if the problem with saves getting corrupted is rectified. Thanks :)"

,dis_dat,2012-11-23T14:01Z,"Hello!

I lost my savefile earlier and I cannot get it back. I was at Sequence 9 when uplay.exe crashed and deleted my temporarly access to AC3.

So, if anyone out there is currently on sequence 9, or around 9, it'd be SO so so so awesome if you could send it too me so I dont have to do it ALL over again! >.< I'd appreciate it ALOT!

Thanks!"
