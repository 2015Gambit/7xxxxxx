New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is certain of three truths: People donΓÇÖt just vanish into thin air. Never anger old people. And donΓÇÖt do what Tiki tells you to do.

After a slow summer of chasing low-level skips for her cousin VinnieΓÇÖs bail bonds agency, Stephanie Plum finally lands an assignment that could put her checkbook back in the black. Geoffrey Cubbin, facing trial for embezzling millions from TrentonΓÇÖs premier assisted-living facility, has mysteriously vanished from the hospital after an emergency appendectomy. Now itΓÇÖs on Stephanie to track down the con man. Unfortunately, Cubbin has disappeared without a trace, a witness, or his money-hungry wife. Rumors are stirring that he must have had help with the daring escape . . . or that maybe he never made it out of his room alive. Since the hospital staffΓÇÖs lips seem to be tighter than the security, and itΓÇÖs hard for Stephanie to blend in to assisted living, StephanieΓÇÖs Grandma Mazur goes in undercover. But when a second felon goes missing from the same hospital, Stephanie is forced into working side by side with TrentonΓÇÖs hottest cop, Joe Morelli, in order to crack the case.

The real problem is, no Cubbin also means no way to pay the rent. Desperate for moneyΓÇöor maybe just desperateΓÇöStephanie accepts a secondary job guarding her secretive and mouthwatering mentor Ranger from a deadly Special Forces adversary. While Stephanie is notorious for finding trouble, she may have found a little more than she bargained for this time around. Then againΓÇöa little food poisoning, some threatening notes, and a bridesmaidΓÇÖs dress with an excess of taffeta never killed anyone . . . or did they? If Stephanie Plum wants to bring in a paycheck, sheΓÇÖll have to remember: No guts, no glory. . .
