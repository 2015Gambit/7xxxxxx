Madman Atomica! This is the big one! Hugemongous! The perfect companion to the now classic Madman Gargantua, this collection contains the complete Madman Atomic Comics series, The Atomics series, and the many now-out-of-print one-shots, plus a huge pile of extras, pin-ups, and rarities! Collects Madman Atomic Comics #1-18, The Atomics #1-16, Madman King-Sized Super Groovy Special, and the It Girl and Mr. Gum One-Shots.

Madman Atomica chronicles the bizarre exploits of Frank "Madman" Einstein and his friends the Atomics (former street beatniks who obtained super powers through an alien spore).

Creator Michael Allred has found his greatest inspiration in the world of Madman and friends (in an already inspired career), constantly experimenting with technique in art and story.  This volume will attest to that even if you only look at issue no. 3 of MADMAN ATOMIC COMICS where Allred drew each panel in a different style of one of his classic influences or "the World's Biggest Comic Book Panel" which makes up the continuous action sequence of MADMAN ATOMIC COMICS issue no. 9.

The world of MADMAN and THE ATOMICS is a kaleidoscopic journey through pop culture and a pure love affair with the comic book medium.  Light, fun, and joyful, while often deep, introspective and existential all at the same time, Allred's creations are a true American original.
