,LanceLionroar,2012-11-22T16:00Z,Is this repack missing cutscenes or voices/sounds or is it the full thing? Need confirmation soon please.

,[AU]StarScream,2012-11-22T18:23Z,Read error after pressing New Game. Crashes to desktop; reinstalled everything and even lost all my Steam games to no avail..

,preda96,2012-11-22T19:30Z,"Is it working, and does it have surveys?"
,[AU]StarScream,2012-11-22T19:52Z,"No, it's not working."
,dno256,2012-11-22T20:42Z,Why doesn't this work?
,[AU]StarScream,2012-11-22T21:29Z,"Dunno, I've already downloaded this game 3 times gonna find another version ;_;"
,biteme1011,2012-11-22T23:00Z,[AU]StarScream just a quick question. Why the fuck would you download this torrent 3 times after it didn't work the first time and especially after it didn't work the second time!? The definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over expecting a different result!lol OR are you just a fucking TROLL!?
,Adrian4493,2012-11-22T23:52Z,"have the same problem as [AU]starscream. game crashes when you try to start a new game, anyone have a solution? "

,[AU]StarScream,2012-11-23T00:31Z,"biteme1011
My bad, I meant I downlaoded 3 different versions of the same game and encountering similar problems. I'm not trolling, as you can see above someone else experienced my very issue."
,[AU]StarScream,2012-11-23T00:34Z,"I recommend the Black Box version, it seems to be working fine according to plenty of comments. "

,thorgrimmar,2012-11-23T07:20Z,"Game starts normally, but when I press new game it crashes with error ""read error. please verify your game cache"". NZupload, can you please explain what to do? Does this Repack need a cracked steam? Because pasting it in normal steam doesn't make any difference."
,thorgrimmar,2012-11-23T07:35Z,"Game launches ok, but when i try to load new game it says ""read error, cannot verify game cache"". What to do? Does it need a cracked steam or what?"
,fureya07,2012-11-23T08:32Z,If you have problem with cache error change language in skidrov.ini to russian and works like charm ;)
,fureya07,2012-11-23T08:46Z,The problem with cache error is english language. If you start game in RUS all work's fine. If you use ENG always crash. I think repack is broken.
,BOSS1338,2012-11-23T09:13Z,"Yes this torrent is real, although as soon as i choose a difficulty, the game crashes (black screen), i don't know if this is due to the crack provided by skidrow, or if it's to do with your torrent, either way it's not working."
,Mescwalrus,2012-11-23T09:30Z,This is crap.  I downloaded this.  When I install it got stuck at 19.4%  Now I cant delete certain files it installed off my pc.  Im downloading the skidrow version since more people said that worked.
,hatim05,2012-11-23T11:39Z,the problem is with the English language if you tried while on English it will crash to desktop BUT on Russian it works fine ..please NZupload work this out 
,Migjmz,2012-11-23T12:01Z,Don't work. RUS or ENG.
,alizma21,2012-11-23T12:46Z,Awesome game!
,knight95,2012-11-23T13:53Z,"NZupload, Im only having this crash on starting a new game. Could you tell us your specs on which you ran easily? Please reply :) thank you.. I am installing it for the second time because I replaced many cracks in order to try to run this game and got that dirext x 11 error but fixed it when i updated the game. 

Hope everything goes smoothly with others. "
,chip211,2012-11-23T14:04Z,"If you put the game in russian it works,but the english version is crashing"
,knight95,2012-11-23T15:06Z,Okay Russian version is working fine. NZupload I downloaded his other games but I am disappointed with the hitman release. Either the game files are corrupt or something might've happened with installer. Have you guys tried installing it only in Russian language and see how it worked out?? Im going to uninstall and install in russian version. Perhaps that might be english language files.
,knight95,2012-11-23T15:28Z,im so eager to play this game ;_; dreams crushed by IO DEVELOPERS :@
,knight95,2012-11-23T19:32Z,NZupload WHY DONT YOU REPLY man :( I downloaded your repack . Please do something about the russian english language thingy
,Xplosive99,2012-11-23T20:32Z,this shit doesnt work if u want english
,takisxx,2012-11-23T22:33Z,"it works only rus but you can use english subs^^
anyway i think its only 1 hitman absolution who can play ,the others  doesnt work..."
,knight95,2012-11-24T01:14Z,"After going through many forums, I came to realize the game files were missing from the repack so in other way the uploader screwed us with audioslaves release. This version has one manifest missing from it which is why it is giving that english version error. I got an unpacked torrent and compared it with the game ffiles only to find one gb of them missing......."
,lehshara,2012-11-24T08:32Z,FUCK YOU! YOU FUCKING CUNT NZupload IT DOESNT WORK WASTED TIME DOWNLOADING 9GB OF THIS SHIT TO REALIZE ITS UNPLAYABLE BECAUSE IT ONLY WORKS WITH RUSSIAN LANGAUGE FUCK YOU AGAIN BITCH HOPE YOU DIE MOTHERFUCKER
,herra0,2012-11-24T09:19Z,"GUYS GUYS I FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET THIS WORK! First of all, you must put the language to russian. (don't worry, just read whole thing!) Then you must try to navigate to the options, text language, and put it to english. They will SPEAK english, but just put subtitles on! Enjoy!"
,takisxx,2012-11-24T09:35Z,herra0 with that way the audio is russian..you cant put audio on english
,herra0,2012-11-24T11:14Z,"I know takisxx, but it doesn't ruin the game for me in any way. I a m not russian and i play with the audio russian, and i am on Streets of Hope level now. I love the game!"
,rcords,2012-11-24T16:02Z,"Why are people downloading this crap? It doesn't work in English.

The uploader has made a 2nd version and said nothing about why, and nothing about how to get this version to work properly. Who knows if the 2nd version will work."
,konakona,2012-11-24T18:59Z,"I concur with @rcords. This uploader is very unprofessional. Do not download unless you are ok with the tedious methods to get it to work, not forgetting the language error."
