Thanks so much for your efforts and time and your willingness to share with others. It kinda amazes me that there are still that many cool users around who contribute something to the community, you know do their part even if feedback is meager and people are quick to whine and criticize, despite all the selfish leechers around these days who give a fuck about others and don't understand that P2P is a two way street and not a 24/7 self-service story. Responsible sharing is important, it's a philosophy that touches also on the consumer markets, how people handle the resources available to them.

Ranting a bit but I guess people get my point. Thanks again for sharing, it's much appreciated here!"
