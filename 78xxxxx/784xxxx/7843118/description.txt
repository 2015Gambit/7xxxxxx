I have wanted this show in MP3 format for years - since it apparently doesn't exist anywhere on the planet, I finally did it myself.  

Ripped from the original DVD in WAV format - then uploaded to recording software where I edited each song individually with fade ins/outs so each track could be seamlessly added to an mp3 mix, or a mix cd (without harsh beginnings/ends), then mixed down to WAV, then finally converted to 320 MP3's.  All tracks are in order of the 2001 DVD.  2 or 3 tracks have a single, mild "tick" as I had to splice large tracks together - I tried the absolute best I could to make them perfectly seamless, I forget which tracks have them, just thought you should know.  Overall, it sounds pretty damn fantastic - download and CRANK IT!!!
