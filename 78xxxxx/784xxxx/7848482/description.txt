Jackson Browne with Sara Watkins - Live Concert 14Nov2012 - Blu-Ray BD9


The legendary Jackson Browne (now 63) gives an amazing and intimate acoustic performance with special guest Sara Watkins at the historic Paramount Theater in Denver Colorado on Nov 14, 2012.

As Jackson describes it this concert is a collaboration of friends who play together privately and in a small club in Southern California. Earlier in 2012 two of the members recorded albums and Jackson sang on those albums. So, to promote their collective music, it seemed natural to all go on concert tour together. The result is an incredibly entertaining concert series.

Jackson is supported by guitarist Val McCallum, bassist/keyboardist Tyler Chester and drummer Fritz Lewak. And they are accompanied by song writer and fiddler Sara Watkins and her brother Sean who plays acoustic guitar.

This live concert series continues thru 2012 and into 2013. Be sure to check out the list of upcoming concert dates shown in the credits at the end of the music.
