[T],hairpickl,2012-11-23T19:07Z,they play fine.  they are 192kHz/24 bit.  i'm listening the them as i type. what are you using to play them? try foobar. or burn them to dvd-audio.
,fZAP,2012-11-23T21:03Z,"the files play fine, but i do get error message in foobar at the end of track 5, but heres what i found elsewhere on the net:

** - Here's another HDTracks' defect at the end of the track ""5"" - Decoding failure at 6:26.112
But this is not correct, because the real track lenght is 6:25, and you can play it fully correctly to the end.
No better version available.
