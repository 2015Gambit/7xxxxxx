,zzixsixx,2012-11-23T22:31Z,"you got me how this works,after down loading i couldnt find the patch first of all and how come you have 126 seeders when you only uploaded it yesterday?"
,wired2,2012-11-28T05:50Z,"The patch fails. Ran it as admin, but still fails."
,-xbt-,2012-12-01T03:45Z,"Excellent. Works perfect.

@wired2:
1) You have already run the patch once (will fail after first time because it's already done), or

2) You have the program open. It will fail if Xilisoft is open when trying to patch."
