[T],dynstab2,2012-11-23T23:46Z,"Quick question to uploader: What's this file named ""folder.jpg"" (not the one contained in the folder Artwork - info) which saves with the attributes H(idden) S(ystem) and with a time stamp anterior to even the existence of this work?"
[V],oneanight,2012-11-24T00:21Z,"@ dynstab2

,gusfring,2012-11-25T08:09Z,question: why are the screenshots only 640x360? and does this have a 2-channel audio? thanks.
[V],oneanight,2012-11-25T23:52Z,"@ gusfring 

The reason I posted 640x360 screenshots is because some sites they look ridiculous they take over the whole page and you have to navigate via your browser to get to what you're looking for just wish that some sites would restrict 720p screenshots to a certain size as you can right click on the image to view at the original size go figure. Audio read the description it's all there nothing more nothing less simple.. Some screenshots for you in 720p hope that answers your questions.. Peace and love brother/sister
