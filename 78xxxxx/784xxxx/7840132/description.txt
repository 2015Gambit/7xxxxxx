3)  Barrio of Blood 
In Southern California, black and grey tattoos connect a culture that started in the barrios of Los Angeles in the 1940s and survives on today's rough streets. Amid the sun and palm trees, ink marks territory and serves as a reminder of blood spilled on neighbourhood streets. Marked dives into the origins of this distinctive tattoo style, born in the violent, gang-saturated California prisons and refined on the streets of LA. Artist Freddy Negrete, one of the originators of the Chicano style, takes us on an exclusive journey, deep into this unknown world, where we decode the ink that decorates the bodies of current and former Chicano gang members.
