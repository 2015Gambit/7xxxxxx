This novella was expanded from "Freak Show," the nigh impossible to find anthology F. Paul Wilson edited back in 1992. It was originally published as a 500-copy collector's edition that sold out on publication. With copies of the limited going for over $100 on the aftermarket, the author decided to make inexpensive paperback and ebook editions available to his readers. The story involves the Otherness and ties into both the Repairman Jack series and The Adversary Cycle. Follow Oz and his band of freaks as they tour the country on a dark mission that threatens the nature of reality itself. (A companion piece to "The Last Rakosh" and the Repairman Jack novel, ALL THE RAGE.)
