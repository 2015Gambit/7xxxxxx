,maralsin,2012-11-21T14:59Z,"GUYS.....READ THE FUCKING DESCRIPTION !!

Final size..........: 10.2 GB

The multiplayer is ripped.


PS: Finishing my download in about 45min. I'll upload at 1mb/s for all day long !"
,Xxii-AMD-iixX,2012-11-21T15:05Z,"this is just the multiplayer, no singleplayer...
anyways thnx ez gonna wait for a scene release"
,quackrat,2012-11-21T15:14Z,multiplayer takes 5GB whereas campaign takes 10GB... so this is the multiplayer version
,faris1997,2012-11-21T15:22Z,"Guys this is only 5 gib because the multiplayer component is separated, thanks EZ you rock!!!"
,maralsin,2012-11-21T15:36Z,The 2 guys to top = kids

,ravi00,2012-11-21T16:13Z,Downloading ... thanks Ez
,FlankerB1,2012-11-21T16:18Z,People claiming that this is multiplayer only are IDIOTS! Multiplayer is ripped - that means it is not in this version of the game. And small size is because this is BlackBox repack (BlackBox repacks are always highly compressed). Notice how it requires 10.3 GB of space after install.
,xboxgamer999,2012-11-21T16:39Z,"@extremezone
Any chance of uploading Hitman Absolution because its been out since the 20th of November and were still waiting :/"

,preparationh,2012-11-21T20:11Z,"I'm gonna assume that by 'ripped' you mean taken out, because ripped sometimes also means copied, which would mean only multiplayer got uploaded... but seeing how cracked games don't play online, uploading only multiplayer would just be a huge waste of time for everyone..
i've never heard of this beeing done before, that's the only reason i'm confused."
,Timbo6669,2012-11-21T22:07Z,"THis torrent means it has foreign stuff removed, logo files, intro movies, sometimes in-game movies, or whatever you can remove and still playfine...they do this to half or even quarter the size of release..of coarse they wouldnt upload 'multiplayer only'..That soesnt make sense at all..."
,BuciO.o,2012-11-22T01:00Z,"Just installed it and I have a problem. When i start the game, it looks like its skipping the intro videos and then it just gets stuck on ""Inspired by historical events and characters"". Help pls?"
,Melix87,2012-11-22T01:24Z,"Pls seed, at this speed I will finish at 22th century:)"
,kokolastico,2012-11-22T02:56Z,"Hi, thx for the torrent extremezone .

Also can anybody tell me how I can find the file where the game put my save ?"

,roks41988,2012-11-22T09:32Z,"I've downloaded Skidrow, Black_box, and Theta but every time I start up a game the game will go to the loading screen and then freeze up. I then get a prompt saying that AC3SP has stopped working... Does anyone know what's going on here or how I can fix it? I have all the right specs to run it on my rig according to CanYouRunIt"

,zeomal,2012-11-23T04:00Z,"Lossless means that there is no loss in quality of the Videos, Audio and Texture (in this case) that have been repacked to reduce their sizes.
And people, please seed! Download speed is about 20 Kbps. Let us too enjoy the game as you are probably doing now!"
,zeomal,2012-11-23T04:04Z,"@roks41988
Looks like you have some problem with your game or your PC. Either reinstall the game, or download another crack of another scene group, or wait for another update/patch t your existing game."
,faizaan10,2012-11-23T10:46Z,lossless audio. Does this mean the cutscenes have lesser video and audio quality than the original game.
,WhiteJuggernaut,2012-11-23T13:17Z,great download... but I can't play with my xbox controller... why? :(
,nj98110,2012-11-23T13:19Z,Ripped means the multiplayer is ripped out from this edition! And multiplayer is not going to work anyways when you don't have original key.
,coa1994,2012-11-23T13:25Z,ty :D
,Sikiz,2012-11-23T14:56Z,"Hi people, are you sure this torrent is great? I mean you sure only the multiplayer were removed?"

,PlaysGames11,2012-11-23T23:40Z,"The game don't work : glitch and bugs everywhere, sometimes, nobody speaks but there is subtiles, fights don't work (left click don't do anything when you're on the boat)"
,preparationh,2012-11-24T00:28Z,"Actually, ignore my last comment. The glitches at the beginning of the game were caused by my system. I just got very similar 'glitches' while listening to music on Windows Media Player.
Game works perfect. Thanks Blackbox and extremezone!"
