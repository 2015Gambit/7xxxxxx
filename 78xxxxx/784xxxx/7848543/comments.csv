,totoro_9000,2012-11-28T17:39Z,"i encountered a bug in chapter 7: the coroner's office. whenever i click the cork board. the cursor disappears and the game freezes. i checked some forums and they said that some of the work arounds was to look for ""flashInstall"" folder in the game folder, unfortunately it's not there. i updated my flash player and shockwave but it didn't help.. thanks for the upload, though..."
