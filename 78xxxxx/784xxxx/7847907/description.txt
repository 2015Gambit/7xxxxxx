NOTE: I suggest downloading VLC Media Player to watch this release.  You can download it here:
	 
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html

A few important and simple keyboard shortcuts for VLC are:

Double click: Fullscreen
Spacebar: Play/Pause
V key: Enable/Disable/Change Subtitles.
G/H key: Subtitle Delay (-50ms/+50ms each tap)

NOTE: For English Subtitles, Right Click, Subtitle, Open File, & then choose either the .idx or .sub file.

NOTE: Two samples are included for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: I do not have constant Internet access, so even though this is a relatively small torrent, it may still take a few days to upload.
