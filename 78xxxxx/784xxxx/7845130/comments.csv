,shabbamanuk,2012-11-21T04:09Z,"haha....i do speak spanish and am learning swedish as i will be living there next year.I guess german and russiian were not top of my list.People like you are very rare;this community is something that is out of control of governments and tv networks,and thats why they hate it.All over the world we wait and wait for u guys to do this;that to me is delicious.People who never meet but trust....thank you sir/madam."
