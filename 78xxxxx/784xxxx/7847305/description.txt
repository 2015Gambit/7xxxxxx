When an eccentric millionaire offer a group of opposites $1,000,000 to spend the night in a so called &#x22;Haunted House&#x22; with a murderous past, they figure it is a quick way to get quick money and leave. All of them are sure it is some made up story just to mess with their heads a little and test their courage.
