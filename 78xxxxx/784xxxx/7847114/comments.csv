,slim114,2012-11-22T01:59Z,thank you.
,vivow,2012-11-22T02:46Z,keygen or serial included?
,vivow,2012-11-22T03:04Z,"downloaded and installed it already. but when you open the program, it is still asking to enter the key and says - your trial period will expire in 15 days. but when you go to ""About ProShow Producer"", it says it is registered to rndd. 

please clarify if this is already full version eventhough it says 15 days trial only.

thanks!"
