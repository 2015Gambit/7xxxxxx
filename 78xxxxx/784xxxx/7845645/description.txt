It was the 1960sΓÇôΓÇôa time of economic boom and social strife. Young women poured into the workplace, but the ΓÇ£Help WantedΓÇ¥ ads were segregated by gender and the ΓÇ£Mad MenΓÇ¥ office culture was rife with sexual stereotyping and discrimination.

Lynn Povich was one of the lucky ones, landing a job at Newsweek, renowned for its cutting-edge coverage of civil rights and the ΓÇ£Swinging Sixties.ΓÇ¥ Nora Ephron, Jane Bryant Quinn, Ellen Goodman, and Susan Brownmiller all started there as well. It was a top-notch jobΓÇôΓÇôfor a girlΓÇôΓÇôat an exciting place.

But it was a dead end. Women researchers sometimes became reporters, rarely writers, and never editors. Any aspiring female journalist was told, ΓÇ£If you want to be a writer, go somewhere else.ΓÇ¥

On March 16, 1970, the day Newsweek published a cover story on the fledgling feminist movement entitled ΓÇ£Women in Revolt,ΓÇ¥ forty-six Newsweek women charged the magazine with discrimination in hiring and promotion.  It was the first female class action lawsuitΓÇôΓÇôthe first by women journalistsΓÇôΓÇôand it inspired other women in the media to quickly follow suit.

Lynn Povich was one of the ringleaders. In The Good Girls Revolt, she evocatively tells the story of this dramatic turning point through the lives of several participants. With warmth, humor, and perspective, she shows how personal experiences and cultural shifts led a group of well-mannered, largely apolitical women, raised in the 1940s and 1950s, to challenge their bossesΓÇôΓÇôand what happened after they did. For many, filing the suit was a radicalizing act that empowered them to ΓÇ£find themselvesΓÇ¥ and fight back. Others lost their way amid opportunities, pressures, discouragements, and hostilities they werenΓÇÖt prepared to navigate.  

The Good Girls Revolt also explores why changes in the law didnΓÇÖt solve everything. Through the lives of young female journalists at Newsweek today, Lynn Povich shows what hasΓÇôΓÇôand hasnΓÇÖtΓÇôΓÇôchanged in the workplace.
 

Some reviews:

Gloria Steinem
The Good Girls Revolt is as compelling as any novel, and also an accurate, intimate history of new women journalists invading the male journalistic world of the 1970s. Lynn Povich turns this epic revolt into a lesson on why and how we've just begun.

Jeannette Walls
A meticulously reported and highly readable account of a pivotal time in the womenΓÇÖs movement.
 
Kirkus
PovichΓÇÖs in-depth research, narrative skills and eyewitness observations provide an entertaining and edifying look at a pivotal event in womenΓÇÖs history.

New York Times
The personal and the political are deftly interwoven in the fast-moving narrativeΓÇª. The Good Girls Revolt has many timely lessons for working women who are concerned about discrimination todayΓÇª.But this sparkling, informative book may help move these goals a tiny bit closer.
