Here is a collection of audio adaptations of some of the plays of Euripides I got from Demonoid forever ago... included are multiple are adaptations of Medea, Alcestis, and the Trojan Women, and a single adaptation of Hecuba.

For all of those people who have been enjoying my uploads, fear not! There is more to come. And if is the first torrent of mine you have downloaded, check out my other torrents. I plan on continuing to release more audiobooks for those who wish to pursue their education beyond the classroom.

And if you like Greek tragedy, check out my upload of the Theban plays by Sophocles. I also plan on bringing some Aeschylus to the Pirate Bay before long, too.
