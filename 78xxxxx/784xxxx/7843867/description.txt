The star of the sold out mini-series is back!  Adjusting to life in the far-flung present is one thing, fighting the female assassin Silencer is another. Worse, one of Diana's most dangerous adversaries from the 1960s resurfaces to complicate her life, Lincoln Stanley, aka Hepcat. Has he really reformed, as he claims, or is he back to his old tricks?
