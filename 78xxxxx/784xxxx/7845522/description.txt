The IMDB says: In the depths of the Korvatunturi mountains, 486 metres deep, lies the closest ever guarded secret of Christmas. The time has come to dig it up! This Christmas everyone will believe in Santa Claus. 


It was made in Finland. Santa Claus is a big, horrible, ugly creature, I guess. You only see his tentacles. But it is not a horror film. I don't even like horror films, but I liked this film...a lot. I hard-coded it in English, because...except for the beginning, it is in Finnish. 
Enjoy. And don't forget to seed. Thanks.
