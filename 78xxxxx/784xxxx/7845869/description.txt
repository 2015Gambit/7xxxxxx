A collection of Bryan FerryΓÇÖs solo CDs.

These are the 1999 remastered versions.
 
1985 ΓÇô Boys And Girls
1987 ΓÇô Bete Noire
1994 ΓÇô Mamouna
 
I fell in love with the Boys and Girls album while at University and have been a fan ever since.

If you like this brand of super smooth art funk. I can recommend his 2010 release Olympia or Roxy Music's last 2 albums Flesh+Blood (1980) and Avalon (1982)
 
Enjoy !!
