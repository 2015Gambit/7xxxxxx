Plot
After the birth of Renesmee, the Cullens gather other vampire clans in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts the family in front of the Volturi.





VIDEO - Well the video is the spanish release according to unknowns notes,probably a little bit better and less cropped
that matines release....HOWEVER the video has a blurred logo top left,there is lots of camera movement,so you might get
sea sick.The video was dark,and lacked colour aswell.
Also where cuts have been made the video does change AR i've noticed.

AUDIO - Much better than the cam audio out,but found this a little overpowering and the balance of it a little off.
Oh also there is some minor sync issues ...little slips here and there.

WORKDONE:

Took the video and rotated by 1.600 to level it up better,then cropped the borders that made ( only a few pixels all round ).
Then i resized the video,to fix the AR better...still some change throughout,but seemes better too me now.
Also made the video brighter and added alot more colour to it.
Slightly tweaked the rgb colours,used a smoother aswell....

Audio stripped it and dropped it into AA and first off lowered the DB's and then changed the EQ bands for a better balance/sound.
Then resaved and remuxed.
Will be honest and say i haven't fixed the slight slips in audio,but they don't last long and are only like 100 -200ms.


Overall IMHO ...not great at all and normally would wait a little longer,but not alot happening atm and i'm sure someone might
want this lol ...if not just for the audio.
No doubt better video will come soon ....so either wait till then,or grab it if you want....
