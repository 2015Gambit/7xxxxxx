You're the only one dumb in this thread

Are u saying all StylishSaLH is doing is reuploading YiFy's movies?
LOL some of the movie he has released has not even been touched by Yify, like Nolan's 1998 movie Following 
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7856373/Following_%5B1998%5D-480p-BRrip-x264-StyLishSaLH_%28StyLish_Release%29, so who's the fool now??
Moreover: both Yify and StyLishSaLH are release ""smaller"" versions from much bigger BR sources. YifY has two versions for every release : 1080P and 720P - so that people can CHOOSE between quality and bandwidth. Same with StylishSaLH, their group releases various qualities too - TDKR is available 480P, 720P and 1080P, better variety and more choice is what makes StylishSaLH special.
And another detail that you failed to see is that YiFY's 1080P fails as it still gives petty stereo audio
While Stylish 1080P release has 5.1. How can a supposed ""copy"" can be better thanoriginal you dumbass?? can you answer that??

So suck it up and let people decide which is original/better for themselves."
[V],StyLishSaLH,2012-11-28T08:27Z,"Hello. .
feel free to post your opinions, and I'm okay with all allegations. I know this would pop up someday, that's the reason why I'm replying to the comment. I've been adding a watermark in the video and you can notice it @ right bottom part of the screen. 
Yify is a good friend of mine, and we are on the same boat. I respect him as a fellow pirate and as a human being. He uses 1080p sources and has a good team. My connection isn't that good. So I had to rely on 720ps for my 480ps sometime. I often get file from my friends, too.
 Yify has his own space in our community and I dont' want our comment section to be bleak bleek :)
And I'm no one to ask you not to comment. It's just my opinion. 
Be nice friends. God bless. . :)"
,MANIUIS,2012-11-29T21:20Z,Excellent ripas always... too bad the movie completely sucks.
,gaurang1001,2012-11-30T04:25Z,Please upload Bourne Legacy in 480p
