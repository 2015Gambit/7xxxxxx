After being brought back from near-death by Edward after childbirth, Bella begins her new life as a vampire and mother to their daughter, Renesmee, who is growing at an accelerated rate. But when Irina, a member of the Denali coven, mistakenly reports Renesmee as a human infant who has been bitten and transformed into a vampire to the Volturi, they set out to battle and destroy the Cullens for breaking vampire law. To prove Renesmee is not an immortal child, the Cullens gather foreign vampire clans, including the Denali, the Amazonian, the Egyptian, the Irish, and Romanian covens, and also European and American nomads, to stand as their witnesses to the Volturi. Aro, the Volturi leader, has ulterior motives for battling the Cullens, however. With their vampire allies and the Quileute wolf pack, the Cullens defend themselves against the Volturi.
