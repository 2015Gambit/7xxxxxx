Here is a pack of Dark Horror Ebooks. This pack includes zombies, monsters, and other creatures of the dark. Also included is one of my personal favorite Dark Horror writers Brian Keene. If you get nightmares from Stephen King books then this pack will freak you out. Dark Horror Books have more gore, violence and brutality, these can be considered as the adult horror genre as Stephen King is more Thriller compared to Dark Horror.
