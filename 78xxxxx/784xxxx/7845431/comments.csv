,AlvaroLezama,2012-11-21T03:38Z,What Is The Diference between a regular bluray and the imax version?
,chalotn,2012-11-21T04:59Z,"@AlvaroLezama  

Its the same thing... IMAX is how they call the 16:9 full screen scenes... some rips resolutions are for example 1280x528... that means there will always be black bars on top and bottom of the movie...

This movie contains over an hour of IMAX (no black bars scenes) on it as most bluray rips over 6gb in this site... but they dont mention the IMAX thing for some reason.

Sorry for my english i hope you get what im trying to say.

btw i was hoping for .idx and .sub subtitles in this release... your source has them could you please upload them somewhere?

Not many people can download a 32gb file in a matter of hours just to get the subs... please any help?

Thanks alot 3li"

,user_001,2012-11-27T12:50Z,"IMAX is more than just a format shot at 16:9. IMAX is shot on film that is twice the size of regular film (i.e. 70mm (IMAX) not 35mm (standard cinema)), hence a sharper and clearer image is produced from this format."
,Coldblackice,2012-11-29T02:59Z,"I'm still unclear as to why this is titled ""IMAX"". Technically, all of the movie rips have ""IMAX"" in them. 

Was this ripped from some source other than the bluray? Or did the poster just throw ""IMAX"" in the title to clarify that he correctly ripped the bluray's resolution that changes between 30mm and 70mm throughout the film?

(Whereas some other uploaders incorrectly ripped the movie, leaving IMAX scenes stripped of some picture, instead leaving cropped/black bars in place."

,3htthe,2012-12-01T10:11Z,"I don't understand. If half the movie wasn't shot in IMAX, how are you getting the aspect ratio to suddenly fit 16:9 without cutting out parts of the scenes or stretching the video? Or ARE you cutting out bits of the screen?"
,lif3isfr33,2012-12-01T14:16Z,"@3htthe 

The secret lies in the film it was recorded in. IMAX is 70mm and non-IMAX/ regular screens is 35mm by commercial standard. IMAX is special in that it doesn't crop anything. It fully captures everything in 16:9 size without the use of black boxes. Regular screens doesn't capture too much detail and is cropped only from the top and bottom. Why that is  I do not know. But IMAX is far superior. At least with regular 16:9 you get wide screens. 4:3 crops out both top, bottom, height and width. So best is:

1. IMAX nothing cropped, full screen 16:9 +crisper lens and boost in detail and light.
2. Theater (Regular 16:9, known for widescreen)
3. TV 4:3 "
