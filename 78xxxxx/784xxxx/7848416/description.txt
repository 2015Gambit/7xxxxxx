Overview: 

Torchlight. A booming mining town that grew up around unbelievably rich veins of Ember, that rare ore with the power to enchant--or corrupt--everything it touches. It s a powerful thing, and everyone knows power, well. Power can corrupt, too. You ll set out into the nearby mountains and depths below to discover the full extent of Ember s influence on the civilizations that have come before. 

Choose from among three character classes, and venture from the safety of the town of Torchlight into randomly generated dungeon levels, with a huge variety of creepy monsters, endless variations of loot to find, and quests to complete. The endless randomization ensures that you ll never be playing the same game twice. A fun, crunchy action-RPG, this one game that oozes style, care, and polish out of every single pixel and is a definite must to pick up if you like RPGs or just having some mindless fun.
