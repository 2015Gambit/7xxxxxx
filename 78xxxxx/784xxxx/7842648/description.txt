Naomi Klein, author of the international bestseller The Shock Doctrine, says the tragic destruction of Hurricane Sandy can also be the catalyst for the transformation of politics and our economy. SheΓÇÖs been in New York visiting the devastated areas ΓÇö including those where ΓÇ£Occupy SandyΓÇ¥ volunteers are unfolding new models of relief ΓÇö as part of her reporting for a new book and film on climate change and the future, and joins Bill to discuss hurricanes, climate change, and democracy.

ΓÇ£LetΓÇÖs rebuild by actually getting at the root causes. LetΓÇÖs respond by aiming for an economy that responds to the crisis both [through] inequality and climate change,ΓÇ¥ Klein tells Bill. ΓÇ£You know, dream big.ΓÇ¥
