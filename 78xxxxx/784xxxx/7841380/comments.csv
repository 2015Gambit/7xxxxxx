Would it be possible in the future for you to remux these releases with the dolby track from the HDTV rips? I've tried using mmg through mkvtoolnix, but because there are breaks in these releases, the audio becomes more and more out of sync as the show goes on. 

e.g. After the intro the audio is around 300ms ahead of the video. Then after the second break the audio is somewhere between 400-600ms ahead of the video. I can sync the a/v for any part of the show, but not all at once."

I'm very grateful for the time you spent uploading this stuff for us, but two torrents of the exact same thing does not make sense. It just splits us. Seeders of one torrent can't talk to leechers of the other and we can't get the performance of just one torrent.

For the BitTorrent community, please. Let's get stronger!"

,TekSquid,2012-11-20T16:49Z,Don't be daft. Two perfectly healthy torrents are better than one. Why give up valuable redundancies for very little gain?
,letsgetstronger,2012-11-21T02:20Z,"TekSquid, they are healthy because they are very recent. And redundancy should be solved in the tracker level, not with a lot of torrents with the same content (in my opinion).

It is just something that bothers me. TPB is a great place, but I think it can become better (i.e. I think some content should not be private-tracker only).

I don't know, I was just trying to help. :-)"
