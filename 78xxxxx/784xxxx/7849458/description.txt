In this atomic adaptation of Mickey SpillaneΓÇÖs novel, directed by Robert Aldrich, the good manners of the 1950s are blown to smithereens. 
Ralph Meeker stars as snarling private dick Mike Hammer, whose decision one dark, lonely night to pick up a hitchhiking woman sends him down 
some terrifying byways. Brazen and bleak, Kiss Me Deadly is a film noir masterwork as well as an essential piece of cold war paranoia, 
and it features as nervy an ending as has ever been seen in American cinema.
