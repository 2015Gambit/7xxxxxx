Does anyone know how to fix it?"
,FenianLad,2012-11-25T22:53Z,"I downloaded, installed and started it okay. But when I got to the main menu, instead of words it's just random broken patches of text on the buttons. I managed to find the New Game button, but the problem persisted, and on every single piece of text is broken.
Anyone encounter this?"
,tqbv,2012-11-26T09:35Z,"For the people who are getting the crash.dump error on launch, here is the official developer thread regarding the subject. We must await the arrival of new patch:

,mtmoore81,2012-12-01T03:26Z,"i have it downloaded and copied crack.  i've used sskidrows  Skyrim, Borderlands, and New Vegas cracks among others so usually all goes ok.  On this I copy everything over and when clicking the icon nothing happens but a quick ""loading circle.""

When I try using the launcher file from the copied crack folder it lets me pick my language then click save and play but it again just drops me out.  

I can play all the aforementioned games when I downloaded and really want to get this working to see if my 4 almost 5 year old can play it with me.  I think it would be great for him but also bought a wii when he was three and he wasnt really able to get that down with dual controllers.  Us parents always pushing too soon :-)

Me and my son would really be grateful for any help.  Also, for some reason Saints Row and sleeping dogs I had trouble starting today but those forums are chock full with issues.  I'm really hoping to get this going.  "
,mtmoore81,2012-12-01T03:27Z,"also should note, I'm not getting any errors and it doesnt show up in task manager as running or not responding."
,mtmoore81,2012-12-01T03:38Z,Also to my prior post...I allowed it in windows defender and what not.  running malware bytes also bu that shouldnt affect it since it never has before.  I tried deleting and reinstalling and getting that cant install directxredist whatever but I already have directX updated and said so when I tried redownloading the update for it from windows.
,mtmoore81,2012-12-01T03:40Z,"Ok, thought I changed it to run as Admin but hadnt clicked apply i guess.  did that and working now.  thanks ."
,N1kky98,2012-12-01T05:22Z,Yay It's officially out but the comments on the forum suggest it might not be working for many people so I don't know if it'll work or not but Please UPDATE and then UPLOAD the game to Piratebay Thank you! ;)
,swagandvans,2012-12-01T07:10Z,"when i run as administrator, it says an unhandled exception has occured. crash dump created and then program files and stuff in the scribblenauts folder crash_11_01_2012@17-08-43.dmp"
,N1kky98,2012-12-01T08:01Z,"@swagandvans That is why we need the new BETA fix that went out live today! We need someone to upload it on the piratebay though!! :( I want to play it badly! Can someone who owns the game update it and then upload it! Thanks, and we'll be waiting!! "
,amorsito,2012-12-01T11:11Z,I'm having the same problem as xDim. It works since I can hear the sound but the screen is black. :( Any help?
