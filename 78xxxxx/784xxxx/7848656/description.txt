Every few years a bookΓÇöthrough a combination of the authorΓÇÖs unique voice, storytelling ability, wit, and insightΓÇösimply breaks the mold. Bill BrysonΓÇÖs A Walk in the Woods is one example. Richard FeynmanΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Surely YouΓÇÖre Joking, Mr. Feynman!ΓÇ¥ is another.
 
Now comes Youngme MoonΓÇÖs Different, a book for ΓÇ£people who donΓÇÖt read business books.ΓÇ¥ Actually, itΓÇÖs more like a personal conversation with a friend who has thought deeply about how the world works ΓÇª and who gets you to see that world in a completely new light. 
 
If there is one strain of conventional wisdom pervading every company in every industry, itΓÇÖs the absolute importance of ΓÇ£competing like crazy.ΓÇ¥ Youngme MoonΓÇÖs message is simply ΓÇ£Get off this treadmill thatΓÇÖs taking you nowhere. Going tit for tat and adding features, augmentations, and gimmicks to beat the competition has the perverse result of making you like everyone else.ΓÇ¥ Different provides a highly original perspective on what it means to offer something that is meaningfully differentΓÇödifferent in a manner that is both fundamental and comprehensive. 
 
Youngme Moon identifies the outliers, the mavericks, the iconoclastsΓÇöthe players who have thoughtfully rejected orthodoxy in favor of an approach that is more adventurous. Some are even ΓÇ£hostile,ΓÇ¥ almost daring you to buy what they are selling. The MINI Cooper was launched with fearless abandon: ΓÇ£Worried that this car is too small? Look here. ItΓÇÖs even smaller than you think.ΓÇ¥ 
 
These are players that strike a genuine chord with even the most jaded consumers. In fact, almost every success story of the past two decades has been an exception to the rule. Simply go to your computer and compare AOL and Yahoo! with Google. The former pile on feature upon feature to their home pages, while Google is like an austere boutique, dominating a category filled with ΓÇ£extras.ΓÇ¥
 
Different shows how to succeed in a world where conformity reignsΓÇªbut exceptions rule.
