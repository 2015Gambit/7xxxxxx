V:9.5
A:9.5
I will also work on it to improve hue, saturation, and audio sync."
,guiltedbird,2012-11-22T07:21Z,"don't listen to want3d4life, he's lying

V:3
A:5
M:1

horrible quality, the camera keeps unfocusing and focusing, and sometimes the screen is so dark you can't see anything

the audio isn't as bad, however

If you're a twi-fan, wait for a better copy. If not, and you just want to laugh at the movie, then this one's OK (since there won't be any better copies around for a while)"

,yob09,2012-11-24T01:00Z,"I don't usually download movies if its not from my trusted uploader in tpb like extremezone, scene4all or Yify, but dis one TBD part 2 cam copy from Acesn8s is best quality by now compare to my previous download where you'll see people blocking the screen and heard them laughing all along in the movie. abl1991 is right, can rate this movie v=8, a=9 & m=10, a definitely must see movie dis year.

tnx Acesn8s (& friends), you made my twilight saga movie collection complete....looking forward more of your uploads."
