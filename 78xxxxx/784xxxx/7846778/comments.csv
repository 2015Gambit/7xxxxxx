WS.Reputation.1 is a detection for files that have a low reputation score based on analyzing data from Symantecâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s community of users and therefore are likely to be security risks. Detections of this type are based on Symantecâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s reputation-based security technology. Because this detection is based on a reputation score, it does not represent a specific class of threat like adware or spyware"
