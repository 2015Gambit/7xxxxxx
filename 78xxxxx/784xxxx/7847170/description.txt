Hamish and Andy's Caravan of Courage: Aus vs NZ S01E02 WebRip x264 - LolzoidBeancake

WebRip by LolzoidBeancake

I don't know what happened to the guys who record Hamish and Andy off live TV, so here you go =)

For some reason, this season's episodes are supplied on Ninemsn Catchup in two parts.

I haven't watched this episode myself yet, but I have confirmed that both the video and audio are working in VLC.

My process is now much more streamlined, so now you can expect new episodes soon after their release on Ninemsn Catchup =)

Downloaded from Ninemsn Catchup with RTMPExplorer and RTMPdump.
Transcoded with Handbrake since Ninemsn Catchup's FLV files are larger than necessary.

Frame size: 1024 x 576
Bitrate: 1100 kbps average
Total filesize: 517 MB
Total duration: 00:59:13

Enjoy!
