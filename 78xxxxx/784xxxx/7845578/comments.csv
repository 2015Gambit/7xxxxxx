None of of the PDF readers opens the book 
""Scientific American's Ask the Experts"".
Mantesh can you do something about it
I remember some of your other uploads had the same problem.
Thank you for your efforts."

Thanks."

,Steerage,2012-11-25T10:30Z,"What a load of bollocks this is. Slow moving and mostly pointless drear. Quality is not that good and it is probably only any good for a 15 year old girl who read the book, otherwise forget it."
,Gargamel77,2012-11-26T00:34Z,"The kid in the movie is actually a girl, I thought it was a boy.

Good movie. 8/10"
