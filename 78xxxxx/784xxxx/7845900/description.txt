Emily and... The Tell-tale Heart

When a drug impaired patient in the ER
embarrasses Emily, making her the laughing

Bandari's advice to be tougher. Emily and Will
discover that their teenage patient needs a
partial liver transplant, but when neither
parent is a match, a shocking secret is
revealed. Meanwhile, Cassandra tries to get
some intel on Will by being nice to Emily,
while Tyra sets Emily up on a date with her ex
without Emily's knowledge
