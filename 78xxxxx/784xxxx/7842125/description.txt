Whether avoiding pointless meetings with the clueless pointy-haired boss or angsting over insanely impossible sales goals, meaningless performance objectives, and a mind-numbing cubicle environment, Dilbert and his fellow corporate victims soldier on, providing a humorous release for the great brotherhood of office drones. For 20 years, Dilbert has connected with the unappreciated, making one and all wonder, "Has Scott Adams bugged our offices?" In Dilbert 2.0, a collection of the strip's first 20 years, Scott clearly demonstrates that through the dot-com and real estate bubbles to the new normal, Dilbert knows that the stuff of work is really funny business! Now presented for the first time in a four-volume electronic edition! This third volume of Dilbert 2.0 covers the dot-com bubble from 1998 to 2000 for the celebrated cartoon strip.
