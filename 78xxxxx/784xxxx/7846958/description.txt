Video2Brain - Getting Started with ActionScript

ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language that has a wide reach on the web, the desktop, mobile devices, and beyond. If you want to be able to hit many targets with one code base, ActionScript is a great way to do so; it also lets you build a variety of application types, from 2D and 3D games to enterprise applications, video players, and more. In this workshop, expert software engineer Joseph Labrecque teaches you the very fundamentals of programming in ActionScript 3 using both Flash Professional and Flash Builder. You will learn how to use core constructs and object types such as variables, arrays, and functions, as well as more advanced types like video, sound, XML, and JSON.
