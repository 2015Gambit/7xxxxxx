,totocon,2012-11-22T20:13Z,"Hey Footy,

thank you so much for all the work you've done this year. I would not be able to follow the races. Just had some kind of a technical question. Is it possible for you to upload in HD directly? I love you're HD F1 uploads. Awesome quality and sound. I would wait longer, just to get the HD version asap after the race instead of the other versions. Anyway i have to thank you again. Hope we could enjoy it next year as well. 

Best regards"
