The action of the second episode of Black Ops, dedicated to the secret operations of heavily armed special forces, will unfold in 2025. Technology development does not impact on common sense, and the slogan "World Peace" has remained a distant dream.

And the ultra-modern weapons, robotics and drones will be the last hope for victory.
