 from the Preface:

 Nearly all puzzle books published today grossly underestimate the
 intelligence of their public. The reader can no longer be enter-
 tained with the simple match-trick or coin puzzles, neither does
 he want to see problems purely mathematical in nature, such as
 can be found in any textbook. We have tried to produce a book of
 those puzzles which lie between the two extremes.

 Although most of the problems can be solved by logic and
 common sense, some of them may also be solved more elegantly
 by mathematics.

 The essential ingredients of a good puzzle are not hard to
 establish. It should be ingenious but clear, complete yet concise,
 if possible amusing, and have a unique solution. It is for oUr
 readers to decide how many of these puzzles bear comparison
 with this ideal.

 Completely new ideas for puzzles are unfortunately rare and
 so we do not apologise for including a few of the "Aged but not
 infirm". Many of the problems are original and we claim to have
 improved others.
