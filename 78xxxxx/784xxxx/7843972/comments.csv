,drew1972,2012-11-20T22:27Z,"Thank you so much Nepotu.  I wish there were more people like you out there (especially people who upload English language versions of UCL games!)

Oh yeah, and thank you for the UCL games, I still watch them even though I don't know Russian, Ukranian, German or Spanish.  I'm slowly learning how to say corner kick in Russian though!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-21T16:47Z,":) You're funny, drew. Well, the russians are more helpful. If I would had a generous upload bandwidth I would upload much more english versions of La Liga, UCL, ECL etc. But with max. 80 kB/sec what can I do? You're welcome, bro!
PS: If you can find though a radio mp3 commentary, you can put in sync with the video an you haven't to learn russian :)"
