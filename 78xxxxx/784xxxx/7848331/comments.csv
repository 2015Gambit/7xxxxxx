,hackpsp7,2012-11-22T04:25Z,"how do i save, there's no device to save it to?"
,3razar3,2012-11-22T07:58Z,"sAME PROBLEM, IT KEEPS DENYING A SAVE DEVICE"
,3razar3,2012-11-22T08:04Z,"@ hackpsp7 Found out how to save, Set the properties for the fguy.exe (under compatibility) to RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. you might also want to change the ACCESS LEVELS to FULL CONTROL under all access levels under the SECURITY tab. Apparently the program doesnt install with ADMIN functions so it doesnt know its allowed to save (kinda gay) .. At any rate, this WILL allow you to save."
,3razar3,2012-11-22T08:05Z,RUN The program as administrator and you can save
,3razar3,2012-11-25T06:37Z,"This SHOULD be nuked, it doesnt take a genius to realize how to give admin rights, i did tthat as soon as it told me it couldnt save.. but you cannot progress past act 1.. you cannot play SOMETHINGS AMISH in the campaign mode.. it gets stuck on a black loading screen.. also multiplayer is fuxored.. so yes, it SHOULD be nuked"
,Taix4,2012-11-25T17:18Z,works perfectly about to finish the game...
,Stefanovics,2012-12-02T18:03Z,"Black screen fix (for me worked)
1.) run in admin
2.) run in window"
