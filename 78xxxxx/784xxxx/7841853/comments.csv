,caiosilva96,2012-11-19T22:33Z,"In my opinion, better than the mostly downloaded 480p ~350mb releases, with lower size"
,Knan4051,2012-11-20T02:20Z,Yeah its better than regular 480p rips by far. If uncompressed 720p rips are 10/10 I'd give this:   V8 / A9 (I don't have a big tv so I don't see a difference)
