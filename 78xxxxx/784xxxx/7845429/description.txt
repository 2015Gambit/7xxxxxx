Description: 

Set against the rugged beauty of Washington State at the turn of the twentieth century, Amanda CoplinΓÇÖs debut novel, The Orchardist, introduces readers to William Talmadge and his lovingly cultivated orchards of apples and apricots. CoplinΓÇÖs characters are deeply rooted in the mystery of the American West, and she brings them together, like the grafting of TalmadgeΓÇÖs trees, to form a unique family bound not by blood but by the shared experience of tragedy, the land, and ultimately fate.



Some reviews:

ΓÇ£Many contemporary novelists have revisited the question of what constitutes a family, but few have responded in a voice as resolute and fiercely poetic.ΓÇ¥ (New York Times Book Review )

ΓÇ£Amanda CoplinΓÇÖs somber, majestic debut arrives like an urgent missive from another century. You can only be thrilled by a 31-year-old writer with this depth of understandingΓÇªthe final epiphany equals in stark grandeur similar scenes in Emily BronteΓÇÖs WUTHERING HEIGHTS and Pat BarkerΓÇÖs ANOTHER WORLD...ΓÇ¥ (Washington Post )

ΓÇ£Patiently beautiful, THE ORCHARDIST builds its characters and its situations so carefully that the story becomes as real to us as this morningΓÇÖs news. I am in awe of Amanda CoplinΓÇÖs book, which does not feel like a first novel but a lifeΓÇÖs work.ΓÇ¥ (Charles Baxter, author THE FEAST OF LOVE, National Book Award Finalist )
