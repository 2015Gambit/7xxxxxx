,FS14,2012-11-21T21:39Z,Hey Murphy78 Love your work thank you so much :D :D I just wanted to know wether this certain version contain the WMC Pack??
,murphy78,2012-11-21T22:54Z,"fs14, this is just an updated version of pro with the languages integrated.  Every pro has the ability to upgrade to ProWMC, but if you want the free windows version with the data.dat change, you should use the prowmc release I made and then add your preferred language in the control panel."
,MattSL97,2012-11-22T02:23Z,Is there any way for me to remove all of the languages except English so that I can fit it onto my DVD?
