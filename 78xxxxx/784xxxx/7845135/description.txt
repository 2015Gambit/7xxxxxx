Conrad Yeatis "Sonny" Clark (1931-63) left us far too early.  This was his second last album as leader. It consists entirely of original compositions.  

Nat Hentoff speaks highly of it in the liner notes (although nobody ever says that an album sucks in the liner notes)
".....by far his best album largely because he has never had rhythm support so apt for his style."

Track#7 MY CONCEPTION a piano solo would be worn out if this was a vinyl record...a rather obscure album....hard to go wrong with Max Roach on drums
