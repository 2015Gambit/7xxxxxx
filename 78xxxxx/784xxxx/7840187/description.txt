* Plot Summary *

Alim is a young gay man. Born in Kenya and raised in Toronto, he moved                  to London to get away from his conservative upbringing. He faces the hardships of coming out to his mother Nuru, as well as hardships in his relationship with his boyfriend Giles. Alim has an imaginary friend (or maybe a guardian angel or ghost friend, depending on how literally or symbolically one takes the film) who is supposedly Cary Grant, who gives Alim advice when Alim is in trouble. Unfortunately, the advice often seems to make more trouble.
