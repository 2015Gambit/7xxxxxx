Ok, I've created the torrent file, and online it says that to seed it, I need to add it to my program, and I did, but when I do it, it just says that it's downloading and it (of course) doesn't move (the bar that shows me how much is downloaded) because there's nowhere to download the file from.

So... what do I do to seed it?"
