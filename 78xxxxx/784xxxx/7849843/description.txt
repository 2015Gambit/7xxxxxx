TO YOU, THE DOWNLOADER:

Prepare to have your hard drives rammed full of Ruby Gloom!

Video: 1280x720 23.97 FPS, H264
Audio: AC3 192 KB/s

This is the complete series, ripped lovelessly from iTunes. It's unlikely that
there'll ever be a better release than this on the Internet, until we can get iTunes releases of the 1080p files.

If you can't play this in whatever player you're using, try VLC or QuickTime.

TO THE CREATORS OF RUBY GLOOM:

We fell in love with your show as soon as we saw it.
We wanted to buy copies for ourselves to both show our support, and to have a
version of it stored on our computers for watching and archival.

So we searched for places to buy it. None of your DVD releases have the complete
series. There are no Blu-ray releases either.

After searching far and wide we found it was available on iTunes. GREAT!
However it was only available in Canada. We tried using various methods to cheat
the system to buy it, but in the end we had to get somebody overseas to buy it
for us.

The simplest way to fix this mess is to have the show available globally on
iTunes. I assume there's legal reasons why this hasn't happened already.
This is why we can't have nice things.

We apologize for this torrent. Seeing the end result of love, hard work and
passion freely available on the Internet must hurt. But this is the only way
for the world to experience your art. This may be the only way to save your show
from fading to obscurity like others have. We won't let that happen, even if
hurts. And neither should you.

Once again, thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

TO ARCHIVISTS:

These files were grabbed from iTunes 10.5 and decrypted using Requiem 3.3.5.
They were then scrubbed using a modified version of wildflower76's tunescrub.pl
script. The only modification to it is that bottom 32 bits of adjusted times are
just set to 0 instead of a random value, making it deterministic.

After that, all the files had their (HD) tags removed at the end and renumbered
to be one big list of 40 episodes instead of two volumes of 20 episodes.
