So. Goddamn. Much.

The other ""active"" torrent is complete b.s. Lots of ""seeds,"" but it wouldn't download. My girl's oldest little girl (7) found this show on netflix by herself and liked it. My girl (26) gets a chuckle out of it because she likes the references in it. I've been wanting to download this for them as I'd rather the child watch this as opposed to some bratz bullshit, but haven't been able to.

You came through, big time. I registered on TPB just to offer my thanks. Great job, and with a purely digital collection, to boot! "
