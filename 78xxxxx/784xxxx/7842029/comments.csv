Is there any other way we can file share??? I REALLY WANT to get MAVS 2011 NBA playoff games from you, you have 1-3 seeds on some, which may take some time. But on some, no seeds at all. Please respond back."
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-20T02:06Z,tell me what games in particular do you want. I'll see what I can do.

All the Mavericks game you have. There is, I think, like 16 or so. I am downloading two at the moment. I don't has fast internet. If you can see them all for like a month or few weeks, that would be really great. Thanks in advance."
[V],Nepotu,2012-11-20T08:47Z,"With the dead torrents I can't help you by seeding, because I haven't those games already. All I can do is putting here some other links. But I don't guarantee you that is working for all links."
,che3to,2012-11-20T09:07Z,"That is fine. I will ask for the links then. Though, they may not work, I very much appreciate the help."
