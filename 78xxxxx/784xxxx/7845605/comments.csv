,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-11-21T15:43Z,"Not by chance,some of Chelsea's matches this season have been quite interesting.Great games against United,which you cannot predict a winner,the ones against Shacktar,with both teams' midfielders showing strength and creative plays,and decisive encounters with great champions such as Juve make their games a ""must watch"" even if you don't support them.Chelsea's matches are just an example of you efforts,mr.Footy.You bring those and many others to millions of people every week.Unto you our gratitude.An unsung hero you are."
