She Thinks I Still Care: The Complete United Artists Recordings, 1962-1964 5CD.

Bear Family Records. Release: 2007. Remastered.


Country music doesn't get any more essential than this. The five-disc box set SHE THINKS I STILL CARE is undoubtedly the most awe-inspiring George Jones collection to date. Jones was at his peak during his 1962-'64 stint on the UA label, and some of his most unforgettable recordings hail from this era. You get much more on this set than mere timeless, undeniable gems such as "The Race is On," "She Thinks I Still Care," and "Let's Invite Them Over," though.

From heartbroken Hank Williams tributes like "Take These Chains From My Heart" to the spiritual intensity of "Kneel at the Feet of Jesus" and a generous helping of Jones legendary duets with Melba Montgomery (easily on a par with his Tammy Wynette collaborations), this set gives us a full picture of the man's artistry. And with five discs worth of tracks, you couldn't ask for more comprehensive coverage of this era. You can get the aforementioned hits on a million best-of packages, it's the rest of the story that makes SHE THINKS I STILL CARE such an outstanding musical document.
