                                 SYNOPSIS                                     
  Hanklin Purvis enjoys the outdoors, and he loves to hunt. He and his wife,  
 Dorothy, live on a farm in the rural mid-west. For some reason, during the    
  season before autumn, things start happening. The first victims are family  
     pets, then wild animals. But it's not until people are injured that      
                      the police get involved.
