As promised, I ordered this CD, ripped it in iTunes at the highest possible MP3 settings (320kbps, "Normal" Stereo, VBR enabled (with 320kbps being the lowest bitrate accepted), and frequency clipping disabled). All the songs are there, and album artwork *might* not be. If it isn't iTunes can retrieve it for you.

Total download should be around 117mb in an uncompressed directory. My upload speed sucks, so you'll have to be patient in the beginning! Please seed!

Any requests? If there's no high quality torrent up on here, and I like the type of music, I'll probably be willing to buy a CD and UL it for you! Leave a comment!
