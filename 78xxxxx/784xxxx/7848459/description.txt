Notes: (READNFO) Source had a timer, watermark and a scrolling watermark.
We placed a nice smooth blur over both of them (Took 6 hours). The scrolling one
is still there but that only pops up every now and again. We filtered the video
as normal and then fixed the audio sync which was only out by like one second.
I'm not normally a fan of placing blurs, but I think it's the best choice for
this one, others will think different. In the darker scenes the blurs aren't as
visible, in the lighter scenes they are. Take the sample and decide from that.
Oh, and we don't want to know if you're not going to download. Oh, and If you
don't know what a WORKPRiNT (WP) is, please do some research
