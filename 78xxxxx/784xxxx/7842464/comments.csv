,josh1960,2012-11-20T10:41Z,Excellent timing!  Thank you.
,howdyk,2012-11-20T17:37Z,"Thanks.  It works great.

But it's a shame that all dozen or so drivers it listed for me were older than I have installed even though it said they were newer.  Otherwise all drivers failed to install.
This app probly works just grt if you have old drivers installed.
I recommend DriverEasy, which seems to have newer database of drivers."
,howdyk,2012-11-20T18:05Z,Ok.  I see if I Live update the database the found drivers is accurate.  Unfortunately updating also unregistered the app...

,howdyk,2012-11-20T23:21Z,"Hi thanks, that's what i got and it works good.  Although the download drivers works more reliably with driver genius.
If u could add the updated driver database to the driver genius that would be great too.
Thanks much for sharing."
,some-young-guy,2012-11-22T00:30Z,"Is it me, or is Driver Easy retardedly slow?  It's been downloading drivers for about 5 hours now.  I think I'm gonna cancel it and toss it and use this Driver Genius.  I never had problems with it in the past.  Thanks uploader."
