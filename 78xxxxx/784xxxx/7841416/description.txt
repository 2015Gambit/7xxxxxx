Shepherd Moons is an album by Irish musician Enya, released on 4 November 1991. It won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album of 1993. It was a #1 album in the UK and a Top 20 hit in the US, peaking at #17 on the Billboard 200. It stayed in the Billboard charts for 199 consecutive weeks. Shepherd Moons is the last album Enya used guest artists.

    "Caribbean Blue" was released with "Orinoco Flow", "As Baile", "Angeles", and "Oriel Window" as additional tracks.
    "How Can I Keep from Singing?" released with "Oíche Chiún" and "'S Fagaim Mo Bhaile" appearing as additional tracks. (Chiún is an apparent misspelling of Chiúin.[citation needed]) In the lyrics book, the song lyrics are missing a part, although they are the full lyrics of the video, which is a reduced version of the original song.
    "Book of Days" released with "Watermark", "On Your Shore", and "Exile" as additional tracks.
