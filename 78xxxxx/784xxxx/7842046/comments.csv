,Nitrousbird,2012-11-20T02:36Z,"You don't lose any quality transferring a MKV video to a native format the PS3 can read.  Just use tsMuxer or another muxing software to de-mux (muxing a file is NOT a file conversion).  Re-mux it into something native to the PS3, such as a .TS or .M2TS container.  Takes all of 30 seconds to do.

Also, no one is going to upconvert a file to 1080p.  It would serve no purpose, the video would not look better, and would take more bandwidth.  I love these straight, uncompressed, 1080i files...most people posting torrents have no clue how to properly compress a video and it always looks like hell on a large TV.  This uncompressed streams are how the program is meant to be seen."

you can play mkv on ps3 without converting

go to divx website download their codec pack and install onto your pc (using windows7) and stream any mkv file to your ps3 via media server.

most of these episodes would be too big for a fat32 storage device anyways."

This isn't 1080p and it isn't an MKV. It's a 1080i Transport Stream. PS3 & 360 are capable of playing them. It might help to change the file extension to .mpg or .mpeg though first.

@oku-ichiban
Streaming to a system is reducing quality content by quickly downconverting the streams of the file in comparison to internet speed."
