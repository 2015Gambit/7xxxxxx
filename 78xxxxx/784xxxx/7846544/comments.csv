wires visible and such?"

Bit out of sync
There is a timer of how long the movie has been going top right the whole time and a spanish i belive copyright note that scans across every now and then"
,desuru,2012-11-21T19:56Z,"just flicked through.  
video is good, except for watermark left corner and large timer right upper corner - not too distracting for me though.   Did not come across obvious parts where special effects not added on my quick look.  
audio unfortunately out of sync on quicktime and vlc.  "

there is a watermark on the upper left of the screen and a timer on the upper right of the screen. they are fairly large and i would consider them intrusive.

otherwise the movie is watchable.  the movie itself has some really dumb parts, but it also has some parts that are hilarious. overall i would say its worth a watch, i laughed my ass off. "
