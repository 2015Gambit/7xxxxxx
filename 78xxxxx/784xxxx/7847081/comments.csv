They are great, Except : In every one that i have used i have found A BitCoin.EXE in every one ?

Now I understand why there is so many Versions.

Look in the Default user File in AppData it is there!  Every person who uses Any of his OS'S
are Bit minning for him ?
He just puts out a os every few days and people
use it - He gets Paid !"
,AxOpLiX,2012-12-01T18:35Z,"Alright, I've two questions mainly:

1) Do I run the DAZ loader after I've installed the OS(leaving the product key empty) or it does something by itself(it says it injects something before boot) ?

2) Could the OS be/stay updated once it is activated, or I'd have to reactivate it again after the updates ?

This may be silly questions, but any help would be much appreciated!

Oh, and thanks murphy78!"
