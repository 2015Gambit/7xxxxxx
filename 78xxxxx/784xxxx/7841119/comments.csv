,3danim,2012-11-23T14:36Z,Thanks YIFI. I am a fan of yours and got some 3D movies from you. Howeevr this 3D movie is not playable in my 3D TV. Can you please make this files playable in all 3D TVs and  if possible publish some intermediate format which has more sound in it. It is ok to file get 3-4 GB in size if have good sound quality. Dont get misunderstand. your rips are good but sometimes sound feel little bit low. Keep up good works!
,UNiKMeTaLLiX,2012-11-24T03:06Z,Awesome once again YIFY  lol need i say more?
,mcskuss,2012-11-24T16:43Z,"hi yify, can't play this movie in my 3D tv either.
i don't know what seems to be the problem here coz i downloaded this movie twice using uTorrent v3.2 but still no luck.  i also tried playing this in widows media player v12 and can't see anything except pixelized pink screen with audio. but i tried this in VLC and windows media classic player and it played perfectly.

any help???"
