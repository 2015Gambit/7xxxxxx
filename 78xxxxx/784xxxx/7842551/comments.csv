Following the success of TLC's Breaking Amish, Discovery Channel is going to attempt to reach into the gold mine that is Amish life with a new reality series entitled Amish Mafia, which debuts in December.

The series will focus on the ""men who protect and maintain peace and order within the Amish community"" in the ""Garden Spot of America or Pennsylvania Dutch Country"" Pennsylvania's Lancaster County. 

""This is a side of Amish society that exists under the radar, and the Amish church denies the groupâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s existence,"" said Discovery. The series will provide eyewitness accounts of the incidents, misdeeds and wrongdoings within the Amish community ... To protect participants and their family members, some identifying information and property has been changed. Some scenes have been reenacted.
The basis of this is the Amish Mafia's peacekeepers, who handled a 2006 murder of five Amish girls by a gunman that was not Amish. The Amish were uncomfortable with outside law enforcement handling the case, feeling that they might be treated with some prejudice.

The series premieres Dec. 12 at 9 p.m. ET. A sneak peek will air on Dec. 11 at 10:30 p.m. ET.

What do you think of this? I can safely say I am interested. I donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t know a lot about Amish life.

For all of you Breaking Amish fans, I will upload this after it airs in December. - BeechyBoy"
