,Dwch,2012-11-22T22:17Z,"The audio sync on this one is terrible! Audio is a good half-second behind the video, which made it nearly unwatchable for me... If you don't know how to correct audio sync problems, stay away from this one.

The KYR release is the way to go. It has perfect audio sync, and somehow has better overall quality despite its slightly smaller file size."
