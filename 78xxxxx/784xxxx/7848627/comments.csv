,mossi123uk,2012-11-22T16:29Z,"Is there anyway to save the game when it loads up  it says select storage device but when i click on it nothing happens and it says selected storage device is unavailable.

Or i can continue without saving to play the game"
,zendoang,2012-11-22T18:16Z,seed please
,3razar3,2012-11-22T19:42Z,"this should be nuked, bad crack. only first episode runs, game fails on ""Something's Amish"" & no multiplayer"
,hackpsp7,2012-11-22T19:47Z,run as an admin to save
,mossi123uk,2012-11-22T21:09Z,Thanks running has admin worked :-)
,3razar3,2012-11-23T01:28Z,has anyone gotten the second chapter to load? i have tried reinstalling several times w/ no avail
,Juular,2012-11-24T04:33Z,"It shouldn't be NUKED you guys. SKIDROW didn't test the crack to the extent where they would have to tell people in the NFO to 

1. RUN WITH ADMINISTRATOR PRIVILEDGES
or
2. INSTALL OUTSIDE PROGRAM FILES or where Admin privileges aren't needed."
,Juular,2012-11-24T04:34Z,"Also, this is not a game worth investing $60 into. If FOX Interactive wants to make a decent game they should settle with the Unreal engine next time regardless of the royalties."
,coa1994,2012-11-24T11:37Z,ty dud :D

,Jaus202,2012-11-24T18:10Z,"@fatzx2 if you want the cheats y dont you google search for them, makes sense right?"
,3razar3,2012-11-25T06:34Z,"Disagree, it SHOULD be nuked, it doesnt take a genius to realize how to give admin rights, i didtthat as soon as it told me it couldnt save.. but you cannopt progress past act 1.. THAT is why i said it should be nuked.. you cannot play SOMETHINGS AMISH in the campaign mode.. it gets stuck on a black loading screen.. also multiplayer is fuxored.. so yes, it SHOULD be nuked"
,mossi123uk,2012-11-26T18:16Z,Ive done the level with all the bearded guys if thats what you are saying you cant load 3razar3 im unable to play multiplayer has well but thats to be expected
,fatzx2,2012-11-27T22:13Z,@Jaus202 cant find ANY i dont know why..its weird
,OswaldTheElephant,2012-11-28T12:07Z,"I downloaded it and installed it, now when I try open it it says ""Steam needs to be running to play the game"" and it also opens up the page to purchase it on steam, how do i fix this?? The game itself doesnt run"
