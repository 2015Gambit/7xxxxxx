Thanks in advance; I'll be grateful!"
,ScorpioPirate,2012-11-21T21:35Z,"Hi shano12 :)

I only have the apk file in Mexican, don't have the maps content to.
So sorry :)"
,vctrt,2012-11-22T07:56Z,"Thanks for the upload. I haven't installed it yet so can't comment if it's working or not yet.

For those who struggle with the instructions, you should extract the zip file in the root of the SD card. This will create a folder named tomtom. Then edit the file tomtomcom.tomtom.uscanada.metadata.xml 
with a text editor."
,newfalcon,2012-11-22T16:45Z,"Thanks for the upload, but can you give me more specific intructions? "
,ScorpioPirate,2012-11-22T20:20Z,"hi... open the metadata.xml file
changes this path: file://mnt/sdcard/tomtom/com.tomtom.europe""/

change: /mnt/sdcard/ to where your ""tomtom"" folder are located on your device.

Have fun :)"
,newfalcon,2012-11-22T22:01Z,"@ScorpioPirate
Thanks for your quick response.I put the tomtom folder on my ext sdcard so I used your example above ""file://storage/extSdCard/ Is this correct?"
,ScorpioPirate,2012-11-22T22:33Z,"Yes... that correct :)
I use this path my-self on my SGS3

Have fun :)"
,ScorpioPirate,2012-11-22T22:35Z,"And for more info:
I'm the releaser to, and have made plenty off moderations in both akp + data + maps

Have fun guy's :) "
,elcarezapato,2012-11-26T16:36Z,"Anyone knows what extension to use with a Razr M. Looking at my phone, it reads my microSD card as: ""/storage/sdcard1/tomtom"" or ""/mnt/external1/tomtom"" but both of these do not work... :("
