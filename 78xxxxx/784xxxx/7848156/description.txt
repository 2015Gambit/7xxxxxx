Welcome to the unique vinyl sound !!!
Welcome to the era of the groovin' 70s !!!
This is torrent 158.
Very good vinyl condition.
 Medium sound quality : Too much compression(almost 1 hour playing time).Quantity instead of quality.Missing harmonics.Sounds like cd.Too much treble.
 Personally i prefer the original sound from the records of the 70's.Please have in mind that this production dates back to 1988 when CDs were already in production.
Please comment with your own opinion.
Sound unprocessed(only fade in-out and normalize).
mp3 320 kbps CBR
Images from record sleeve and labels included-even for printing a poster :).
