,The_Inspector_069,2012-11-27T23:33Z,"Jose,

Great Job on uploading the software and allowing to be avaiable to the general public. My concern is, you really do not have any informtion on the CORE10k, how to use it and the purpose it serves. There are novices out there, that do not understand. So a little .txt file my help. :-)

People, listen up. 
The files in the ""setup"" folder, burn them to DVD disc. This way, all you need to do is insert that newly burned disc, and it will execute the install process, like any other retail program you have purchased in the past.  

And take the advice from DenisAllmighty, do not click on ok, to receive updates before install.  To play it safe, just disable you Broadband connection until the install is complete."
