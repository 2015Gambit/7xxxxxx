,sammemannen,2012-11-21T22:32Z,"Thanks.

But the game cannot be installed without a CDKey how am I supposed to install?"
,eden2508,2012-11-21T22:40Z,Same here
,laggo123,2012-11-21T22:48Z,"either you dl the unpacked version, which doesnt have that install stuff, or u get to learn how to unpack those csd etc files with sisinstall"
,xanat0s,2012-11-21T22:53Z,"@sammemannen

The crack will do nothing for you if you don't have the unpacked version"
,simongous,2012-11-21T23:04Z,Anyone else crashing after choosing difficulty?
,STC896,2012-11-21T23:20Z,got the  Hitman Absolution Professional Edition and it worked with crack.
,kamil93p,2012-11-21T23:42Z,"I have Hitman Absolution Professional Editon from Skidrow 25GB and don't work :(

Directx 11 launch failed..."
,Skykeery,2012-11-22T01:11Z,Well first time give me errors all the way stoped worked etc. but then i install steam without creating account and the game is working now !
,john6425,2012-11-22T01:24Z,"This works, thanks so much!"
,Sheet2,2012-11-22T02:07Z,What does CRACK ONLY mean... do u have to have hitman already installed or what?
,Poulpe32,2012-11-22T02:15Z,"Thanx for the crack.

unfortunately, I can't run the game.
I get a ""Hitman5 has stopped working"" error, I can't even get the launcher window. :/

Anybody got an idea about what's going on? Thanx!"
,thane37,2012-11-22T02:58Z,read error: verify game cache 
,Skykeery,2012-11-22T03:13Z,"Poulpe32 i get the same problem, then i just install steam client without making any account on it, just install it and game should work, atlest for me was the option to get game working i was geting the same. "
,nignug,2012-11-22T03:34Z,@skykeerey That doesn't make any sense. How would you install it without a CD key?? Gotta download the unpacked version which doesn't require installing.
,nignug,2012-11-22T03:35Z,Or are you saying you need Steam installed to run it? Because you shouldn't.

HELP ME"
,Enkhsaikhan,2012-11-22T06:22Z,Merci beaucoup!
,laggo123,2012-11-22T07:07Z,"u can install even if u dont have the unpacked version. cuz u can unpack it urself. just like its been done in those unpacked torrents.

all you need is sisinstaller.
google it: sisinstaller hitman

it will lead u to pages telling you what to do exactly. also u need hitman manifest files, google it too."
,mqdn,2012-11-22T07:08Z,"I downloaded the one uploaded by HeroMaster.. Game installed fine.. but I have the ""Hitman5 has stopped working"" ERROR. I downloaded the latest drivers, copied crack, followed instructions. Anyone know how to fix this? 

@skykeerey  your comment makes no sense, you shouldn't need steam client if you have the crack, btw I always have steam client, didn't work."
,avarcis,2012-11-22T09:05Z,"For those having issues with DX11 error:
1) Update your videocard drives. 
2) After that go to their website and install beta version drivers on top of that.
3) Instal system updates. I realise that it doesnt sound like it should help, but it does.
4) Reboot
6) At this point my DX11 error changed to Hitman5 has stopped working"" ERROR
7) Install steam. Don't have to login or create an account, but have to download and install it. Again, I know that this doesn't sound like it should help but strangely enough it does.
8) Enjoy the game."
,mqdn,2012-11-22T09:39Z,"@avarcis  I already have Steam client, it is up to date. Still have ""Hitman5 has stopped working"" ERROR....."
,kamil93p,2012-11-22T10:18Z,@mqdn  I have the same problem... :/
,Poulpe32,2012-11-22T11:31Z,"A question for those who get the game to work:
What is your installation path ?

Anything like ""d:/hitman"" or in the Steam folder ""c:program files x86steamsteamappscommonHitman"" ?

I don't get why I still get a ""hitman5 has stopped working"" error when I launch the .exe file :/
So I wonder if it has something to do with installation path or not, at least... Thanx guys."
,avarcis,2012-11-22T12:01Z,"@mqdn 
updated the system, got the beta drivers too?

@Poulpe32
d:/G/hitman, if that helps. Otherwise, same as mqdn, did you update your windows and installed beta video drivers?"
,kamil93p,2012-11-22T12:18Z,"I have GTX 560M and beta drivers, steam and dont work.. 

Hitman5 has stopped working"
,kamil93p,2012-11-22T12:23Z,"I don't have any idea.. 
I download dll files (d3d11, d3dx11_43, d3dcompiler_43) and paste to system32 and error DirectX11 disappeared. 

But appeared error Hitman5 has stopped working"
,Poulpe32,2012-11-22T13:45Z,"@avarcis :
Yes, did all windows updates, updated beta drivers from nvidia, did try to install the game in d:/hitman and inside the steamapps folder from steam, updated Microsoft Visual C++ 2012, directx, ... Nothing seems to work. :/

I'm downloading two other versions of Hitman, the Skidrow one and the Steam Unlocked one, to give a try.

As I've seen on Steam forum, many users get the same ""hitman5 has stopped working"" even on genuine version. Maybe I'll need to wait for an update for the game."
,laggo123,2012-11-22T18:15Z,"when u got ""stopped working error"" u got some stuff not right.
i had the same, but fixed it. this is how:
i had retail verison.

i unpacked files with sisinstall to be around 25gig.
i dled dlc put into dir
i dled TINcft and the latest hitman update
i applied update.
i putcrack on it
update + unpack around 3hrs computer processing stuff but now
everything works fine"

,psycho34,2012-11-23T18:11Z,"installed steam and now it works!

,xanat0s,2012-11-24T00:50Z,"I seriously urge you all to seriously considering supporting the developers of this game. Hitman has been an amazing series, and this latest release is FUCKING SICK"

,Tintin_82,2012-11-26T18:19Z,"@194skull:

Update your Windows 7 with Service Pack 1. 

OTOH, the crack isn't working. I can get to the main menu, choose difficulty and then the game crashes to desktop. Anyone here been able to run it with this crack?"
,194skull,2012-11-27T09:29Z,lemme try this out... i have tried all possible shit but everthin in vain... hope this works.... thanks bro:)
,Green.Lantern,2012-11-27T19:24Z,I get the menu to play but it crashes immediately before I can press anything
,vragoslav,2012-11-27T21:33Z,"@metroidmen why you seam to be surprised? Its win8 which is not made for desktops, and its still donot have all drivers and supports needed for gaming. I'm sorry but i dont see common sense in installation of win8 on PC."
,metroidmen,2012-11-28T03:21Z,"@vragoslav We aren't here to debate on the operating system, we are here about the game. I've never had any issue with any game up til this one, meaning it's a problem with the game, not likely the operating system."
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-11-29T00:32Z,"Game wont start at all, nothing works, damn shitty game or shitty crack?!"
,194skull,2012-11-29T13:37Z,thanks a lot @tintin_82.. game is workin fine now :)
