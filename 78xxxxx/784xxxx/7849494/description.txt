           ***** CrackMyDay brings you The ITEMIZER v9.0.31 *****


The ITEMIZER computer software develops efficient cutting plans using dedicated routines for Panel, Roll and Linear stock. It is used by all industries that require optimization for their cutting processes.

Our version 7.0 release boosts material efficiency with two Power Search options that analyze a multitude of cutting schemes. New Smart Drag and Drop provides for manually rearranging the cutting plans after they are automatically generated. You can turn pieces vertically or horizontally and move pieces within or between layouts.

Additional features include decimal or fractional entry and export in DXF format. Scale drawings with numbered and dimensioned pieces along with piece description prevents costly cutting errors and optimum sheet selection minimizes waste. Multi-view reduces the number of drawings required for the shop by printing multiple layouts per page.

Besides creating highly efficient layouts, The ITEMIZER prints the drawings and cut lists, figures costs, prints custom labels, maintains a stock selection list, works in English or metric units and accounts for the saw kerf and grain.
