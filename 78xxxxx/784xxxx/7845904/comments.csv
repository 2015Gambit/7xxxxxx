[V],psspss,2012-11-21T09:58Z,"I have it on force seeding to make sure people share

if you limit or dont seed it will punish you

so faster you share the chunks out the faster speed you will get from me"
[V],psspss,2012-11-21T11:42Z,"dont forget about doomsday prepper new season too as Im not doing them

,SLAiN121,2012-11-22T08:33Z,"Man there's a few of us stuck at 35.7%.... lol... my stupid ISP limits my uploads to around 40kB/s max.... I'm given it all I got captain!.... Hey thanks for the heads up on doomsday preppers too, I've been keeping an eye on your uploads for it and scratching my head...

MEATEATER wasn't bad, it made me hungry when he deep fried the freshly shot bear meat in the ""campfire rendered"" bear fat... All it would have needed was a good coating of salt.... My chest is tightening just thinking about it...."
[V],psspss,2012-11-22T08:45Z,"people arent stuck its still seeding... its poss to get 100kb.s but sadly theres some poor seeders .peers on it slowing it down

if I release the force seeding some leap ahead in percentage and since theres only 5 showing on my list as wanting it.. its low priority seed

make sure you see me on fr33dom http tracker
and I think many are blocking my vpn as well

since some spammers use them.. they get flagged in block files.. 

as some people load ips for malware and ads
in their Peer block lists ! not just level 1
antip2p list"
[V],psspss,2012-11-23T14:58Z,"ive shared 3.7gb I dont understand why others havent 100 percent and help seed this now

anyhow its 3am and Im shutting down the pc

between you all you have 100 percent.. if only you shared amongst yourselfs

I will check on it in the morning and share a little more but really the gigs is too much now"
[V],psspss,2012-11-23T23:36Z,"

OK finally.. all seeded out.. lets hope someone with better data caps and net can keep seeding it

for others to come..


perhaps someone can find a good description of the series and post a comment too.. as I hadnt time to hunt one"
[V],psspss,2012-11-23T23:46Z,"all i found.. doesnt really say much for a good blah on it..
