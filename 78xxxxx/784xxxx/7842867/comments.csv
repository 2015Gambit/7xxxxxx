Too bad the show has only got a few more episodes to go before it's over for good... Dam!!"

Sad news for fans of the bickering Teutel boys -- Discovery has decided to draw their long-running documentary series, ""American Chopper,"" to a close after ten years.
After 10 years and 233 episodes of incredible, riveting reality television, American Chopper will be ending its run on Dec. 11."

Full props go to Mikey for telling them all to fuck off and leaving the show with dignity."
