demands her mother puts upon her. Serena

unexpected emotions. With Ivy's help, Chuck
discovers there is evidence incriminating
his father in illegal activities and
enlists the help of Nate to retrieve it.
Meanwhile, Rufus and Ivy are excited about
their art gallery opening until they find
an empty RSVP list and must scramble to
find another way to make the event a
success.
