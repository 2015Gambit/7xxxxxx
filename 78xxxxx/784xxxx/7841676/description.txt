VICE followed the story of the Westboro Baptist Church as families split and children were brainwashed into picketing funerals and bashing homosexuals.
During that time, VICE interviewed more than a dozen members of the reviled group, including some of the only members not related by blood, the Drains.
They welcomed the filmmakers into their homes and gave them access to 17 years of home video footage. In return, they produced an unbiased look into the lives of one of AmericaΓÇÖs most despised organizations.
