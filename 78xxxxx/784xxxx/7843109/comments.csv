@ 'notnowplz' - Copy - Paste - Replace 'Patched exe'. Try not using the Patcher."

,shaggytheblack,2012-11-25T19:15Z,"I have a question..

I convert video using ConvertX but i burn using Nero.  After i downloaded this, i went to burn using Nero and was given an error message about allocation of dvd files.  I went back to Convert X 4 and didn't have a problem at all.  Keep in mind, i've been using Convert X since 3.0 so it's usually a snap for me.

Can anyone help me, please?"
