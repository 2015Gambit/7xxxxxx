,bangstun,2012-11-21T17:19Z,When might you be able to upload Hitman Absolution because i can't wait to play it!
,darksniper48,2012-11-21T18:00Z,Many thanks bro :D
,8452,2012-11-21T18:21Z,seeed pls
,Somacruz_92,2012-11-21T19:32Z,"Latest walking dead!! o/
*is gonna seed*"
,diamondhead880,2012-11-21T20:04Z,"thank you 
but what about HITMAN Absolution"
,Valendane,2012-11-22T05:14Z,"Hitman Absolution is a fucking Splinter Cell game if you're a fan of Blood Money do yourself a favor and don't play it.

But if you intend to put yourself through that anyway, you're in the right place. For the love of god don't buy it, IO doesn't deserve your money now any more than when they made Kane and Lynch 2, and Square-Enix sure as hell doesn't"
,LSBRAH,2012-11-22T05:41Z,"Thankyou so much! You are a legend. Although fellow downloaders may I ask that you please seed, as I am stuck on 2.5% and have been for a long time. Once again thankyou :)"
,magikarpkilledkenny,2012-11-22T06:18Z,"470 seeders
1005 leechers...
Looks like I'm not gonna get to play tonight... Thanks for uploading, though!"
,LSBRAH,2012-11-22T08:01Z,"This is taking me a really, really long time to get. And so I promise to seed :)"
,pepperandice,2012-11-22T13:27Z,"hi i know i might be asking the obvious but its an honest question, i know the info box says ""Your saved data is not in game folder - if you have played previous episodes you can continue game after installing is done."" im totally confused by this, it says the saved data is not in the folder and yet you can continue to 5 after installing?? i downloaded and played the 1 2 3 4 version when i discovered this just last month, now when i install this will it just let me play the 5th game immediately, like does the saved game info get transferred over?"
,faizaan10,2012-11-22T13:41Z,@nosTEAM. ive downloaded ur previous torrent in the series which had the 1st 4 episodes. so i was thinking to download the episode 5 only but i need to know if that previous torrent of yours is compatible with episode 5 installation from any uploader.... HELP...
,Gilart,2012-11-22T16:10Z,"Can someone please help me, whenever I boot up the game, there is no saved data, even though all the save files are in my documents folder"
[T],nosTEAM,2012-11-22T18:40Z,"@ pepperandice  - yes ,you can play episode 5 

@ faizaan10   - I don't know what folder for save data use other versions

@ Gilart  - this version use  ""My DocumentsTelltale GamesThe Walking Dead"" for save data"
,thezoo_,2012-11-22T23:35Z,"Hey there, when I try to play the game it says "" The program can't start because d3dx9_41.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem."" Do you know what that means? I have reinstalled several times to no avail. "
,thezoo_,2012-11-23T01:23Z,"Got it, Direct X update.  But it still won't work, when it opens it has to close because WalkingDead101.exe is not working, I tried both of the fixes from the site, the admin control one, and blocking walkingdead101.exe with firewall, no results."
,v1ck84,2012-11-23T03:22Z,"I want to thank the nosteam for being so awesome, thanks for the great work!"
,Flukather,2012-11-23T04:55Z,"Doesn't work for me either. The exe does nothing, totally dead."
,magikarpkilledkenny,2012-11-23T10:05Z,"At 5 and a half hours, and only 85% downloaded. Will definately seed."
,Kyashii,2012-11-24T05:17Z,"Right so I've already got the first three episodes, yeah.

Then I download this torrent thinking I'll just exclude the files I don't need.

God dammit, guys."
,Cracker_Jak,2012-11-24T06:50Z,"Thanks for this, will seed, unless infected. Peace"
,kareka283,2012-11-24T20:12Z,"hi, thanks for the upload!
I'm having a bit of a problem, I did ep. 1 and I sat through the credits, but it still wants to generate random choices when I want to play ep. 2.
Any suggestions?"
,macfly59,2012-11-24T20:55Z,"thanks where do you change a key configuration 

i have a azerty keyboard not a querty :/"
,Decompress,2012-11-25T02:05Z,Installed just fine.  Played through the whole game last night and no hiccups or bugs.  Thanks much.
,baayama,2012-11-25T07:29Z,"thanks heaps
i have a issue after i installed it slowed my computer. My pc is slow at everything now, i dont get it. Game freezes in places for a minute etc, anyone else having this issue?
other games worked fine before i installed.
Seeding"
[T],nosTEAM,2012-11-25T20:13Z,"@ baayama  - this game cannot be reason of slowing your PC  ,is downloaded and played thousands times and you are first with this issue "
,jojoleo42795,2012-11-25T21:09Z,30 of 1298 seeders. Please seed!!!
,baayama,2012-11-26T05:12Z,"@ nosTEAM:
Yeah i know its strange, never had this problem before thats why i thought i would ask. The only thing i installed was this, very strange.
Thanks for the reply 2 :) "
,Smnx,2012-11-26T09:53Z,"Works great, thanks."
,angelozki,2012-11-26T15:02Z,"hello. 

is is possible for you to upload separate episodes? so we dont have to download gb's everytime there is a new episode?

thanks for the upload! i trust your game uploads than the other uploaders."
,ANTiLEECH,2012-11-26T15:14Z,"Amazing nosTEAM. I formatted and figured I'd have to download 1-4 and then get 5 seperate but I see you have all 5, you save me time! As I got your 1-4 I know this'll work flawless, keep up the work!"
[T],nosTEAM,2012-11-26T19:29Z,@ angelozki  - this is last episode from Season 1 
,RUBDEEZ13,2012-11-27T00:03Z,"i hope that this one works, i normally use SKIDROW but im ok using diffferent torrents"
,simply_complicated,2012-11-27T03:40Z,"Does anyone know why when I download this torrent (even the walking dead games from other uploaders do the same thing, not just this one) i follow directions to a -T-, and it downloads just great, but when i go to play it, all there is is a grey screen, then goes back to desktop with a microsoft error message saying the wa;lking dead has encountered a problem. Im using XP, anyone know how to fix this? I really love the show and want to play the games."
,angelozki,2012-11-27T06:19Z,"sorry, i meant episodes 6-10 next year. it will be faster to download just the new episodes than downloading 1 torrent of episode 1-10  which could be more than 5gb by then.

hope you consider :)"
,ANTiLEECH,2012-11-27T07:47Z,@simply_complicated would you be kind enough to post your specs?
,Land_Shark,2012-11-27T16:47Z,"No matter how far I've gotten into the game, the next time I play my saved game is gone. I've restarted five times. I'm kind of sick of playing the first chapter. Any ideas anyone? ):"
,bravo95,2012-11-29T18:20Z,Thank you!
,cute69,2012-11-29T19:26Z,"Sadly today the 5th episode was deactivated somehow, I can't play it anymore. 
Plus when I finished the 5th episode some days ago, it got stuck in the results screen. :("
,xecon,2012-12-02T01:14Z,"I have tried everything and can only play episode 1, the other four episodes just say coming soon. any suggestions?"
