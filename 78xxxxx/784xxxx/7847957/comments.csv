,86ETA,2012-11-21T18:48Z,"Thx mate   ;)   

cheers "
,adighraiz,2012-11-21T23:06Z,"thanks man...

is this the last episode ?
i want to play full not waiting new release
thanks again"
,elDunge,2012-11-21T23:43Z,"@adighraiz : Yes, judging from telltales site this is season finale. And judging from the torrent size, it include all previous ones."
,tehaceman,2012-11-22T00:00Z,Doesn't work under Windows 8
,Karlston,2012-11-22T00:18Z,"Looks like all 5 episodes, judging by the file size.
No need to mention that in the notes, of course, just label it episode 5 when it's in fact ALL EPISODES.
And what's worse, a gazillion people too lazy or stupid or both, will not read earlier posts and will now brainlessly ask if it's all episodes or just 5."
,tehaceman,2012-11-22T01:40Z,"About me saying it doesn't work on Win8, there's a DLL file missing from the install

""dinput8.dll""

If you find that online, place that in your install directory and the game starts."
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-11-22T06:24Z,Yes this one got all episodes :)
,adighraiz,2012-11-22T10:56Z,"@elDunge

,spacevart,2012-11-22T11:25Z,"Thanks Mr.Stifmeister, ur uploads are the user-friendliest! thanks again."
,TAM70,2012-11-22T13:34Z,"Thanks, keep up the good work ^^"
,asdfkjjj,2012-11-22T15:32Z,"Installed but my episode 4 save file isn't recognized,  says episode 5 coming soon for some bizarro reason, even though installed right off this ISO. The folder structure is there for all episodes, alas,  no joy. Replay the end of ep 4 and credits then thats it."
,baroku,2012-11-29T17:48Z,Can you upload just episode 5 by reloaded?
,baroku,2012-11-29T21:01Z,"Fuck man, this one of the best games I ever played. And the ending...just fuck man! I can't wait for the next episode/par !"
