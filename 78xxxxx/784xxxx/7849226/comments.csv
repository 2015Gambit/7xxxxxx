You posted at 9:22 CET 22nd (8:22 GMT 22nd) (23:22 CA 21st)

That would make the seeding almost five hours old - spillover (when superseed converts peers to seeds in a fairly quick cascade) occurred less than two hours later.

So, at the time you posted your comment, it was five hours into seeding and there should have been more than a hundred seeders. It is now 3:29 CA 22nd (12:29 GMT 22nd) (13:29 CET 22nd)

My client reports 206 seeds and 370 peers
TPB reports 203 seeds and 103 peers
TSI reports 201 seeds and 102 peers

Anyway, if you're still having problems, comment here again and I'll try and keep track. I hope I got the time conversions right.

Sorry for any inconvenience,

AVIGUY"
