,mewaan,2012-11-25T16:37Z,Game keeps crashing 5 minutes in :(
,macht102,2012-11-25T20:53Z,"if you have mods, update or delete them. also go to documents/electronic arts/the sims 3 and delete DCCache, IGACache, SigsCache folders and CASPartCache, compositorCache, scriptCache, simCompositorCache, socialCache package files."
,Crgeorge,2012-11-25T22:08Z,^^^^Before or after instalation
,Crgeorge,2012-11-25T22:24Z,^^^^Before or after we install the game?
,macht102,2012-11-26T01:43Z,only if the game crashes on you. sometimes removing mods and clearing the cache fixes it.
,LilyNae,2012-11-26T10:01Z,"Downloaded, installed the game kept crashing, deleted the files you had said and it's working perfectly now. I still have the program open so it can seed. Thanks!"
,meowspaws,2012-11-26T11:14Z,WORKS GREAT ! THANKS A LOT :') YOU MADE MY WHOLE SEASON !
,MisaMeow,2012-11-28T01:43Z,Downloading now :D Been waiting for this since Seasons came out. And have tried many other failed attempts... thanks :D
,MisaMeow,2012-11-29T18:15Z,"So I downloaded and installed. I deleted my mods and the things you said but when I pull the screen up its missing all the writing. I can't make a new neighborhood (had to delete my old one cause the mods weren't updated) When I go to pick a neighborhood some of them are missing their stories (Moonlight Falls is one of them) I tried getting onto one of my families (before deletion) and the log on to your sims account popped up with the lil unchecked box but there was nothing inside it. 
 I am so distraught D: I miss my sims. Pleaseee help me. "
