An Antonioni masterpiece, but with Alain Delon and Monica Vitti at their finest.
No synopsis, no spoiler.

VIDEO :
Picture quality should be better than the DVD to most eyes (short sample included); the Criterion edition is a bit of a disapointment, as it shows unstable ligth (flickering). I've worked to reduced that anomaly and it shouldn't be a concern on this release, other than that less noise than on the DVD as usual and no sacrifice in quality.
Important ! almost every video you can find on the net, including some high bitrate HD releases should be played with ffdshow installed whenever possible. Reason is that by default ffdshow activates the deband filter which is the most universal useful post-processing video filter (deband). Without that you watch something much less nice, and regurlaly awful (especially dark scenes). A simple install of K-Lite Codec Pack will install everything you need in case you've listened to the bad advice often given on the bay or elsewhere and you're still using VLC or worse.
