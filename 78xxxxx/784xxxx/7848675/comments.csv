But since a little while, they are less caring about posting specification of they torrent than adding some advertisement for their site. It would be nicer to publish it here than forcing people to download .nfo file in order to judge if yes or not they are going to choose that torrent...

I have no clue how the file is so large considering the crap audio and horrid video. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Not to mention this uploader failed to mention any specifications for this download... it's now obvious to me why they left it out. "
