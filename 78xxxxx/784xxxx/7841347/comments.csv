,sh1998,2012-11-25T07:54Z,It is A Carol Christmas made in 2003.  It was done for Hallmark I believe.  In 2008 they made a hallmark movie called Our First Christmas which no one has and it is not on DVD.  Well it is but only in French.  DO you have either of these?  You will be my new hero if you do!!!!
