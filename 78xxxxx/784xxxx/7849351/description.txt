Two Families

Everyone in the firehouse is ordered to take
a drug test after a call to a daycare center
exposes them to a makeshift meth lab, and
Severide stalls, not wanting his injury, or
the painkillers he takes, to be discovered.
Meanwhile, Truck and Squad find themselves
pinned down by gunfire while trying to help
the victim of a gang shooting, and a deep
fried turkey fire grows from small to
explosive when a garage catches fire.
Elsewhere, Dawson saves a bleeding man and
Casey delivers a baby on the scene of a
massive car pileup on the freeway
