CutMaster 2D works just fine with or without automated cutting equipment. You don't need to save up for a Cutting Table or Beam Saw to start saving money on your panel costs or improving your cutting productivity.
CutMaster 2D is successful layout designing software because it consistently delivers the best cutting patterns. There are cheaper panel optimisers available, and optimisers are often free with cutting tables and beam saws - but the bottom line is that you get what you pay for. An optimiser that creates sub-optimal best fit patterns will cost you money in time and materials - and quickly.
