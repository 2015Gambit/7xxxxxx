NOTES:

VIDEO - Pretty poor Q all round to be totally honest.Cropped too hell,cam movement,whacked colours and looks like
2 -3 different cams used....plus reading in matines nfo missing a few mins aswell.

AUDIO - Not to good of cam audio either ...way way too loud and overpowering.Also got some noise to it.

WORKDONE:

First off i cut the video into 3 ,where the colours changed each time and cleaned each part differently ....rotating the video,
fixing the rgb colours,brightness,contrast etc...
After i changed the AR as it looked off and then resized each part to the same res and appended to make it whole again.
After i stripped matines audio and cleaned it up in AA ...lowering the DB's alot and also changing the EQ bands to rise the voices,
and lower the noise...

Wil be totally honest and say the video is rather poo and is only really for cam lovers at best.Audio is alot better now,but still
as some noise to it that comes and goes.

Overall ...IMHO,for viewing on small screens.....v5.5 a5.5 m7
