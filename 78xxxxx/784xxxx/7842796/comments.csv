[V],Acesn8s,2012-11-20T17:14Z,"This is not a good rip lads the source was nuked:( I would honestly wait, this is a big torrent and not  worth downloading it:)  a better source will be coming soon:)"
,i.r.stoker,2012-11-22T00:11Z,"Any word on what this source will be? I've attempted dl of this torrent (from various sources) a few times, and every time my bittorrent client loses the hash - any chance this can be sorted as well?"
,Santoshakur,2012-11-23T03:33Z,"also really starting to appreciate Acesn8s work and no, im not talking about Devon and his thugs....HAHAHAHA!!"
,doubledge101,2012-12-02T14:38Z,"@Santoshakur :
I don't think you're understanding what's going on here:
Acesn8s is a VIP member here at TPB - he/she uploaded the video to TPB

The ""Work"" or the actual ripping was done by ""INSPiRAL"", which isn't really a person, rather a release group - either to the ""Scene"" or ""P2P"" (torrent release group)

INSPiRAL is also who wrote the nfo information that you're reading above. 

So....comments about quality should be directed to INSPiRAL (who will never read them here)

You can thank Acesn8s for grabbing this and uploading to TPB"
