IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS

- For video resolutions greater than 720x480 set focus mode to "Continuous" if available. Else recording might start delayed (app looks as if it hangs for some seconds on the Samsung Galaxy S2)
- Zooming and picture controls can only be modified BEFORE video recording
- Changing from continuous autofocus to some other focus mode can be very slow
- Sometimes the direct HD video preview in the video player (started from CameraPro) shows only a black screen. When the player is started manually the video play back is fine.
- If updating from CameraX fails, uninstall CameraX before installing CameraPro.
- Video recording on some HTC devices and on all devices with Android 2.2 and older is only partly supported

HTC/Distorted Pictures:
- Some still picure resolutions on some HTC devices are distored (e.g. 16:9 resolutions). Enable the "HTC fix" under settings to fix.

LG/Viewfinder orientation:
- On some devices the viewfinder orientation is wrong (e.g. LG P500). Enable "Orientation fix" under settings to fix.
