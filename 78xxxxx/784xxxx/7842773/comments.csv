If you're looking for the book series that the concept of this show was stolen from, it's called ""The Change Series,"" and the first book is called ""Dies the Fire"" by S.M. Stirling. In the books it goes even further, saying that electricity, gun powder, internal combustion, steam and explosives all no longer work. Also, the cause is unknown, there's no stupid family protecting the way to bring the power back, no stupid girl, no stupid stock Hollywood dialogue or plots and plenty of real character development.

@rudeboyskunk

You must be new to the world of television.  Books are ALWAYS different from television, whether the concepts are borrowed, adapted, or stolen.

Second, literally thousands of works were written in a world with no electricity, gunpowder, internal combustion, explosives, etc.  The majority of them were written over 700 years ago.  The concept of no electricity, firearms, gun powder, combustion engines is a depiction of the past, a concept prevalent in many novels, especially fantasy.  J.R.R. Tolkien wrote about a world where no electricity existed, for example.  

The television show ""Lost"" does without many of those factors as well.  After the crash, the world was basically limited to primitive means, for the most part.  

This show and plot differs greatly from those books for all of the reasons you mentioned - it is simply electricity that fails, not the majority of scientific means.  There is a stupid girl, a family, guns, a train, a guarded means to restore the world, and character development is different.  There is only one thing in common is absence of electricity, thus I'm not exactly sure your comparison between the two is even relevant.  They're not even like in story.  Oh well.  Good show :)"

shit wasn't stolen, no apocalyptic concept is original. atroces pretty much hit it on the head. 
and if you dont like the 'stupid family' then why are you even watching it? Thats kind of Kripke's trademark. So is character development, you can be assured that there will be some massive and 'real' CD coming at some point, maybe not this season but it's a slow process sometimes."

Yeah, you're right.  And I really did enjoy Chaucer's story about how the miller laments that because of the loss of electricity and all the other marvelous scientific breakthroughs that disappeared in the span of a few seconds he can no longer do whatever the hell millers do.
