Notes:
why so small sized.. x264 codec allows a lot of compression therefore allowing you to use lower bitrates by keeping constant quality...(CRF encoding...)..

reason for ar change read before commenting:
Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated that he intended to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. The Dark Knight Rises featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, The Dark Knight contained 28 minutes of normal bluray video the reason why for the ar changes). Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues. Wally Pfister had expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX, but because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, 35mm and 70mm cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes, as dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras. Adeed 2 samples of the IMAX scenes and one of the normal bluray scene.
