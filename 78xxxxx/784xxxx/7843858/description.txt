Adjusting to modern day life is one thing. Fighting the female assassin Silencer is another. Worse, one of Judo Girl's (Diana Moore) most dangerous adversaries from the 1960s resurfaces to complicate her life, Lincoln Stanley, aka Hep Cat. Has he really reformed, as he claims, or is he back to his old tricks?
