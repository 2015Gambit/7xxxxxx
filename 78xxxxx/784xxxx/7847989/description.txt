Randral, Torn, and Talandra fled Waterdeep for the wilderness. Only to learn, as the sinister intrigues they fled reach after them, that they've arrived in a place where outlaws and marauding monsters lurk?a place that's called the Ghost Holds for good reasons. Now they just have to get out of it alive.
