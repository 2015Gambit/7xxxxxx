On his third offering for Warp, Brian Eno returns to ambient music once again. He displayed it on his label debut, 2010's Small Craft on a Milk Sea, but the various pieces on it were either rejects from The Lovely Bones soundtrack or developed with Leo Abrahams on the Everything That Happens Will Happen Today tour. The music on Lux is a single, 75-minute composition divided into four segments that are just over 18 minutes in length or under 20. They were composed to accompany an exhibit of Eno's visual art in Turin. While the music on Lux adheres to his ambient principle of making music that is "rewarding attention but not being so strict as to demand it," and there is an elemental drift in all four parts of this work, that's not all there is. Aided once again by Abrahams on Moog guitar, and violins and violas by Neil Catchpole, Eno's electronic textures and drones are also accented by the piano's stray single notes or minimal chords, and skeletal use of bass and/or acoustic guitar. But that sense of drift, while inescapable, is actually more deliberate and tactile. Music swells in places, wanes in others. The listener's role isn't so much to be absorbed in actively engaging the composition, but to be absorbed by it. That said, there is great reward in actually focusing on what "happens" in this quiet landscape, because Lux betrays the implication of vastness and musical adventure just underneath its dulcet tones and restrained palettes.
