1) Update your videocard drives. 
2) After that go to their website and install beta version drivers on top of that.
3) Instal system updates. I realise that it doesnt sound like it should help, but it does.
4) Reboot
6) At this point my DX11 error changed to Hitman5 has stopped working"" ERROR
7) Install steam. Don't have to login or create an account, but have to download and install it. Again, I know that this doesn't sound like it should help but strangely enough it does.
8) Enjoy the game."

but now it does not work with beta amd drivers"
,DocHolidayy18,2012-11-26T06:42Z,"The game works perfectly fine but I have a problem. Each time I close the game, it doesn't save my progress and it resets itself as if I am playing the game for the first time again. 

Anyone know how to solve this problem? "

(Block the game in your firewall and mark our cracked content as
secure/trusted in your antivirus program)????? Can any body tell me???"
,kssamseed,2012-11-26T21:57Z,I tried beta drivers and even windows update. Still get direct x 11 failed to start error. This is nuked. Don't bother downloading

,AleCCC,2012-11-26T23:52Z,"I'm starting to get worried about that I'm actually not going to make this game work. The following is happening:

I installed everything following instructions, and I got the game to work (I did not have that DirectX 11 issue at all) After playing the game for a random amount of time (usually 15-60 minutes) the game suddenly freezes and I get the message that ""Hitman5 have stopped working"".

I read the comments here and did everything that was suggested. I uninstalled steam, reinstalled it, and updated it. That didn't do it. (I suppose it doesnt matter if steam is running while i'm playing the game? Tried with it running anyway and that didnt help)
I've got the latest graphic drivers installed aswell. I'm using windows 7 64bit.

I did not get windows SP1 yet, though I got the impression of that the SP1 was only suggested to people having the directX 11 error.

Can anyone help me out? I really want to get this game to work"
,AleCCC,2012-11-26T23:55Z,I forgot to mention that I've alot tried running the game as admin after reinstalling steam (as I read that solved the problem for some people)
,kssamseed,2012-11-27T00:02Z,"I already have steam. I have steam games installed for years. I updated, but I wont do whole service pack, rather download other games"
,kssamseed,2012-11-27T01:09Z,I have identified that the problem is direct x 11 features like tesselation failing to work. can sum1 who got this working upload their entire Hitman Absolution folder from My Documents? then I can turn these features off in settings file!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,gocleaver,2012-11-27T01:51Z,I don't get how this isn't being shat on enough.  I CANT GET THROUGH INSTALLATION WITHOUT PRODUCT KEY< HELP - ive seen multiple users ignore this issue.
,kssamseed,2012-11-27T02:20Z,I give up on this shit release. I hope Reloaded will put a proper release out soon. 
,aoxo,2012-11-27T06:48Z,"This seems to work fine with the exception of a sound problem that sounds like a game problem and not a crack problem.  I have a Soundblaster X-fi Fatality Pro card, and the latest beta driver from over a year ago that they remind you they don't support (sarcastic: thanks awesome product support from creative as usual).  I have sound during the splash screen, intros, menus, loading screens, and the first few seconds of gameplay...then the second I move I hear a ""pop"".  From then on there's no or almost no sound, with the exception of random horrible static that sounds a bit like someone just tasted the rainbow and a million skittles are falling on their head.  Hitting the forums I found numerous rediculous suggestions as per usual..then found several people that ""fixed the problem"" by setting their sound channel setting from whatever surround setting they use to stereo 2 channel sound.  This sounds likely, and it's not the first time I've seen a recent game fail to support surround properly for all common hardware (skyrim fails on realtek audio when set to surround...which is probably only used by about 95% of players).  Surround sound made it's way to the PC for gaming, for games much like hitman and skyrim.  It even worked in previous hitman releases just fine.  I'm not going to play this if the only way I can is in stereo...good thing I didn't pay for it.  I also took the time to read a review and the game sounds aweful anyway, doesn't stack up to previous releases.

Response to other posts: yes it works (mostly), no it doesn't contain a virus, no it doesn't ask for a cdkey (unless you didn't copy over the crack perhaps), yes people are seeding...stop fucking posting telling people to seed it's annoying."
,kssamseed,2012-11-27T09:46Z,"what system do you have aoxo, what hardware, operating system? Do u have steam? How did you make it work? Did it work right away?"
,WhiteNinja2746,2012-11-27T12:13Z,"when i try to play it say ""Failed to initialize directx 11"", does anyone have the same problem as me? and can you please tell me how to fix it."
,Azu5s,2012-11-27T14:05Z,"Change the name of the .exe (the crack) from HMA to HA and right click and run as admin for those who the game doesnt launch. 

Update your drivers for those who the game crashes. For Nvidia users, dowload the beta drivers 310.61 in website of Nvidia, specially made for Hitman.

,Richy2012,2012-11-28T07:17Z,Is there a way to by pass this shitty direct x 11 failed to initialize error apart from installing windows service pack? Every time I try to update my windows it gets stuck and then I have to do a system restoration after a few attempts. Sucks!

,Furix666,2012-11-28T19:17Z,"ATTENTION!!! This will solve some problems!:

4.) RE-INSTALL the game.
5.) COPY the crack.
6.) RUN HMA.exe
7.) ENJOY!

This have solve me problem!
I hope it will solve your problem too!"
,AleCCC,2012-11-28T20:24Z,My HMA.exe wouldn't stop crashing even though I did everything as instructed. It finally gave me a break when I decided to tryout the new Nvidia beta drivers 310.62. I also have to start the game as admin or it will eventueally crash.

,Aazerus,2012-11-29T23:58Z,"Installation went fine (pretty quick, too) but the game won't launch. I've tried changing the crack to HM and running as administrator, but it won't start. Any ideas what the problem could be?"
,Aazerus,2012-11-30T01:50Z,"Also, one of the steps is to copy the files from the ""SKIDROW"" folder, but after I mounted the image, there was only the ""Hitman Absolution"" folder it was installed in. "
