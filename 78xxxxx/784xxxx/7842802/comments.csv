These files are in lossy mp3.  If you want higher, actual CD quality tracks check the link."

[H],politux,2012-11-21T23:43Z,"My torrent came from the physical CD, without the bonus tracks.  I'm guessing your source is iTunes or something similar that's why you have the extra tracks.  However, mp3 is a LOSSY codec and doesn't give you the same sound as a lossless codec like FLAC, which sounds identical to the source.  "
