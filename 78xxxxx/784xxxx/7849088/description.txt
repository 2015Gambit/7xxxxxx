Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, November 21 Thanksgiving Eve edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex details the immense threat posed to civil liberties by Obama's secretive Presidential Policy Directive 20, and also breaks down the latest consumer surveillance and prisoner indoctrination concept discreetly manifested through unsuspecting store mannequins. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes author, journalist, and editor-in-chief of the influential WorldNetDaily (WND), Joseph Farah, to discuss the secession movement's explosive response to Obama's re-election and the continued conflict between Gaza and Israel. 

We'll also reissue the call for Americans to assert their Constitutional rights at airports in light of TSA Opt Out and Film week.

Today's broadcast went a full four hours.
