[V],GunningHawk90,2012-11-21T07:56Z,"Thanks a ton, man :-)"
,nbrazil,2012-11-21T11:36Z,Looks like the file is screwed up by a couple of duplicate pages at the end. Which in turn makes me wonder if any pages are missing.
,STFmaryville,2012-11-21T13:18Z,"^I just read it and the comic is complete. The last 2 pages are redundant but just ignore them.

Now ... HOLY SHIT DAN SLOTT ... oh wow he got me. I didn't see that coming. The funny thing is, reading the first 2/3 of the book, I kept wondering what wasn't right ... definitely the Comic Book of the Week."
,Tinny_pb,2012-11-24T04:04Z,"Thanks for the upload. The quality of the scan is mediocre - blacks aren't black and colours are weak. It's great for free, but not up to the usual standard of comic scans. A perfect copy is here (and smaller file size too) :
