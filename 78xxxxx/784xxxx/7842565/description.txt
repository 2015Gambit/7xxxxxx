Another week of C2C for all of our enjoyment, Dreamland is included as well. For those of you looking to find something to fill those hours when C2C runs out, check out Ground Zero Radio with Clyde Lewis. I caught it by chance a few months ago just as his national syndication got started. He's syndicated by the same network as George (Premier Radio{Clear Channel}), check your local stations, it's a good compliment for the audiophiles out there. See you next week, and as always, please seed, I'm on DSL, keep this alive.....because with the other stuff I like to download.....I can't.
