Lots of luck trying to find this anywhere else.

Randy Weston trio live from Cafe Bohemia 1956 Greenwich Village; NYC


The OJC limited Edition series IMO was created to market recordings that had 

some fairly serious shortcomings. A higher price was strategically charged to 

attract collectors.  All of the ones I've acquired have sound quality

(fidelity) issues.  Notwithstanding the sonics this series (1700) offers more than a 

few treasures.


Check out the miserably out-of-tune piano....Randy Weston makes it sing!

Cecil Payne's bari sounds like a cello but the feeling is wonderful, especially

when taken as a whole.  I often use this record to put myself to sleep at the end

of another good day.
