Edvard Grieg's incidental music to Isben's Peer Gynt is performed, in its first complete recording, by the London Symphony and Oslo Philharmonic Chorus under the direction of Per Drier.The performance was recorded in September 1978 in All Saints Church, Tooting, in London. The original vinyl recording was released on the Unicorn label and subsequently on Dolby B open reel tape by Barclay-Crocker in the early 1980s. This is a digitized version of the BC tape, run through a Dolby B decoder to assure noise suppression and proper tonal balance. The complete score runs about 95 minutes. The notes from the BC release are included.
