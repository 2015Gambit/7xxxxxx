The Hunt were a Canadian rock band formed in 1977, mostly made of members from another Canadian rock band Dillinger. After Dillinger broke up, guitarists Paul Dickinson and Paul Cockburn, drummer and percussionist Paul Kersey, keyboardist Jacques Harrison, keyboardist and bassist Gerry Mosby, bassist Carl Calvert, and guitarist and bassist Brian Gagnon would eventually all be in The Hunt. Most members also sang vocals. Producer Steve Vaughan would join the band for two of the albums. Carl Calvert played bass on the album Thrill of the Kill in place of Brian Gagnon. After having success in Canada but not much in the U.S., the group disbanded in 1984.

After the first album, which was released by GRT, who were based in San Antonio, the band's success was hard to come by. There were doing a Canadian bar circuit, and eventually Mosby left to play bass for Rheingold. By 1978, both Harrison and Cockburn jumped ship.
