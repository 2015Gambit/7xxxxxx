,nerakamme,2012-11-22T22:51Z,"i downloaded this but it is just a bunch of rar file, is there a way for me to play this.  when ever i try to open one it says something about buying it online. please help?"
,arka1989,2012-11-23T03:36Z,"@nerakamme
though I didn't download this because I dont possess an XBOX, it probably asks to buy winrar.
Don't try to open them by double click. right click on any of the .rar files and extract"

What I do is check the release date for the game, and ABGX will usually have it verified the day of or the next day."
