I got a problem. I downloaded this Game via qtorrent. Everyting ok so far but when i tried to install it i got a error message after ""Cheking File integrity"". There was a popup from Windows 7 ""Error"" "" ShellExecuteEx failed; code 71. There can be no more connections to a Remotecomputer because maximum Number of Clients is reached. Anyone got this Problem too or got any ideas what is wrong ?

Thx for any help."
