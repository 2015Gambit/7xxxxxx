,Vanek679,2012-11-21T15:09Z,Thank you
,Vanek679,2012-11-21T15:10Z,How do you take them if I may ask?
,IPASuperior,2012-11-21T17:42Z,"@Vanek679 I grab the stream and download it. The stream usually is an flv file, and so after downloading I have to convert it. In the long run, it's sort of confusing, but I actually get these for my little sister, as she loves these, then I just torrent them."
,GdeFt,2012-11-21T20:02Z,"@IPASuperior
What exactly do you mean by ""I have to convert it""?

Do you reencode the file? And if you do, isn't it possible to extracl video/audio streams with FLVExtract tool, and then just merge everything back with MKVToolnix?"
,IPASuperior,2012-11-21T20:17Z,"@GdeFt The framerate was really screwy. I did use FLVExtract to get the source files, but I the framerates (both of them) did not work properly. I had to mess around. I then used Yamb to recompile into an MP4."
,Vanek679,2012-11-22T11:14Z,And with a flow you take that you know a site where you can watch Nickelodeon online?
,Egodeath88,2012-12-02T08:47Z,Awesome. Thank you for taking the time to convert and upload these. =)
