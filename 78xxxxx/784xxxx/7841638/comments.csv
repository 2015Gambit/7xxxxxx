,Caika,2012-11-20T07:35Z,"Thanks Coldan, I will seed. I really appreciate the effort you put into this! Thanks!"
,simicsasa75,2012-11-20T09:45Z,"@ CordanCursed
 You are wrong my friend, you should FIRST INSTALL  
The Sims 3 Seasons after the core game and only then all other expansions and stuff because Seasons will automatically patch game and launcher to the latest patch so you should have no problems with the installation at all. 
Best regards."
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-20T10:26Z,"@ simicsasa75

You are possibly right! I never thought about that, and I do not want to promote it because I've never tried it myself. My way works, that I do know. However, if more people chime in with your findings I'll gladly change the directions as that does sound simpler! :) 

@Caik
No problem! Thanks for seeding. "
,Valendane,2012-11-20T11:41Z,"I don't get why EA won't just release a bundle pack already, it's impossible to keep up with everything and if you're new there's no fucking way you're going to be able to get all the core expansions or even know which ones to get.

They should have two bundles, a core bundle and a stuff bundle, and if they really want to milk it they should bundle old store content no one buys into a ""Store Stuff"" pack or something.

I mean, I just don't feel I should have to invest $200 to unlock all the features, some of the content like in World Adventures or the City I wouldn't mind buying separately, but a lot of this stuff should have been in the same pack or released at launch you know?"
,Valendane,2012-11-20T11:45Z,"I understand EA must be making a lot of money for very little work at this point, but it feels like they're trying to force people to pirate their games in order to play them. A lot of people just can't afford it otherwise."
,Valendane,2012-11-20T11:47Z,BTW thank you for including the serials AVG goes ape shit over Key Generators.
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-20T12:12Z,"I highly agree Val. I bought Sims 3 and World Adventures. After that I started downloading them because frankly, I'm an unemployed want to be student living with my fiancee bustin' a nut to get some money and I just can't afford to spend money on my hobbies.. (Gaming) 

As for the serial keys, NP. I believe there are a few generators in there though, I got tired of copying serials/finding serials after a while so I just took the ones that came with the actual torrents I downloaded from the beginning. "

,SD-Ravana,2012-11-20T16:19Z,"The more I watch EA and their shitbag business etiquette and their overwhelming program instability, the happier I am to rip and seed these torrents. Thank you so much for the up-to-date pack :) I'll be happy to seed throughout as well.

EA Games: Pirate everything."
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-20T17:22Z,"I really appreciate all of the positive feedback I've been getting, glad to know I'm making people happy. I had no idea it'd be this popular. I guess people are like me, lazy! Want every thing in one nice clean download.

Next one I do (When next expansion/stuff pack comes out) I'll ensure to only include serial keys, no generators and try to remove all of the un needed files to make it as small as possible. "
,Nobume,2012-11-20T17:49Z,Can anyone seed please? I'm trying to download this torrent but there are no seeds at all. I'll be seeding this awesome torrent aswell :)
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-20T18:20Z,"There are definitely seeds, Nobume as I've been seeding non stop since I put it up.. I'd suggest checking your firewall and making sure your ports are open if you are having difficulties downloading it or experiencing slow downloads. "
,esbornia,2012-11-20T19:45Z,Does this torrent contain the store updates?
,esbornia,2012-11-20T19:47Z,does it contain the store updates?
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-20T20:28Z,"Nope, it does not include store updates however this is something I'm considering for the next version of it. "
,RFSMassacre,2012-11-21T03:17Z,"I see this has low seeders, but is exactly what I was looking for. I will seed if the download finishes. :D I'll have the upload at max speed for all to enjoy. Will check back if installation works."
,esbornia,2012-11-21T03:50Z,"Can't finish the download, it gets a write access error when near 20%, prob my bitdefender acting out, anyone else with this problem? First time it happens with me."
,RingMeUp,2012-11-21T05:35Z,"Not sure if it's just me but the cracks are setting off Norton, which is accusing it of being the Graybird Backdoor (basically, typical trojan). Someone scan please?"
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-21T05:47Z,"Esborn, definitely sounds odd.. Try using Utorrent, it's my personal favorite and I've never had any issues with it.. 

Could also be due to some off problem, possibly a blue screen while downloading or something that would make the files not download correctly.

To be honest, I'm not sure. Just shooting in the dark. Hope the problem fixes itself! 

@RFS
Would be greatly appreciated. I can't seed it forever, been keeping my computer on at night which is an electricity hog.. :P "
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-21T05:48Z,"@Ring

It's a false positive. I can assure you of that, too lazy to scan however but I can say I've installed all of them on my computer.

Next upload I do will contain no key gens and only serial keys to avoid any false positives. "
,Valendane,2012-11-21T06:24Z,"The sad part is EA isn't even making any money by doing what they're doing.

You'd think they were but despite how bit their corporation is and all the stuff they own their profits are kind of pathetic.

All the really big game companies are like that, they get all corporate and out of touch with gamers and the people making games under them don't have much freedom so the art suffers.

I'd bet if Obsidian got that big they'd be slaying the market, just doing what they do."
,Valendane,2012-11-21T06:26Z,"You know I'd buy this, I really would, just to support the guys who are still in Maxis, but they never fixed the glitches from the last expansions, and they never fixed the lag times in CAS even though the solution is simple and obvious, and with all the content I already paid for that I felt ripped off after getting and can't even share because no one else bought it, I'm done buying from EA."
,Valendane,2012-11-21T06:27Z,Low seeders because it's a brand new torrent and it's a big one so it will take awhile I'll seed when I finish downloading.
,Valendane,2012-11-21T14:37Z,"@Ring This is a compilation, the keygens are probably the problem so just ignore them, you don't need to use keygens anyway. The only crack you need is the latest Sims 3 crack, none of the expansion cracks included are necessary anymore.

Before you apply the Sims 3 Crack, just be sure to back up the original, that way any new expansions can be installed as well as any updates."
,esbornia,2012-11-21T19:42Z,If I don't download the keygens can I still seed after I finish?
,eden2508,2012-11-21T22:07Z,Is this game updated and patched?
,Ahug,2012-11-22T11:58Z,"Thanks for the pack, great initiative! I'm getting an error message when I'm trying to start the game after installing everything and using only the Seasons crack. ""Service initialization failed (0x0175dcbb)""

Has anyone else encountered this?

Thanks again!"
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-22T17:30Z,"I wish I had better knowledge of computer programming and I'd just make them all into one installer... Sadly, I don't so I can't.

As for your error, Ahug, are you certain you put the Seasons crack in the correct place? It is supposed to go into the Sims 3 folder, NOT the Sims 3 Season folder. "
,Ahug,2012-11-22T19:38Z,"Yes, and I've tried it several times and get the same error. :/"
,vampiraecho,2012-11-23T06:06Z,"In case of difficulty with keygens, here's some CD keys for those that did not already have them:

#0 The Sims 3 - CWDDAMKSE2KSP4J22WNF
#1 The Sims 3 World Adventures - BD7F8H5NTF6U54QN74HB
#4 The Sims 3 Generations - 3Z6N7RLY3CL4FWSEWMLT

Sorry I don't have ALL the keys :("
,Massing,2012-11-24T00:43Z,"I'm getting the same error that @Ahug. I did everything as specified and the game still won't start accusing ""Service initialization failed (0x0175dcbb)"""
,deathundothee,2012-11-24T02:49Z,Please seed if you can - I've been stuck at 12.05% all day and can't connect to any peers with the full file. Thanks!
,Massing,2012-11-24T03:33Z,"Oh, nvmd, figured it out. I didn't installed the Katy Perry SP and Supernatural EP at first simply because I didn't wanted them. Seems like that the crack only works with all EPs and SPs."
,AduroTri,2012-11-24T15:50Z,"I'd gladly seed it, if others would, if it would ever pick up! I seem to be stuck below 100KB/s most of the time."
,aame892,2012-11-24T19:05Z,Please seed!
,Valendane,2012-11-25T14:53Z,"@esbornia sure you just won't be seeding that part of the torrent, but it's a small part people will get from other seeders or leechers. "
,Valendane,2012-11-25T14:57Z,"Ewwww wait you mean I have to install Katy Perry Stuff?

Oh well, I guess I can sort through the ugly shirts and stuff that pack inflicted upon us."
,LilMissNaughty,2012-11-25T18:09Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7837053/Sims_3_Ultimate_Bundle_-_Rip_Edition_(November_2012)
^^FAR better torrent.
Discs have the redundent Patches ripped out and all DLC is included as well and it is under half the size of this torrent.
So basically, you get everything this one has plus LOTS more and its under half the size."
,ColdanCursed,2012-11-25T18:45Z,"I agree, LilMissNaughty, If it works (I haven't tested it) that torrent looks to be far better and some one who took the time to do what I was going to in my next torrent. Go through all of non-needed files and remove them. 

I'd highly suggest to every one to use the torrent that LilMissNaughty linked, will save lots of time + space. (If it works, that is. I have no doubts as to why it should, just saying I haven't tested it.) 

Either way, I'll continue to seed this torrent for a few more days. "
,ps3vspc,2012-11-27T01:48Z,"everything works great, i installed the sims 3 then the sims 3 seasons and then installed the rest of the expansion packs in order then installed the stuff packs in order then put the sims 3 seasons crack in the sims 3 which was located here -
C:Program Files (x86)Electronic ArtsThe Sims 3GameBin and copy and replaced both then started it up"
