Hello every one!

I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR ANY OF THE GAMES / CRACKS ETC!!
The only thing I've done is put them all together for ease of installation and made them all into ISO files.


I've made this compilation of all of the current Sims 3 expansion/stuff packs.
I hope it makes things easier for every one!

I've numbered the order of expansions and stuff packs in which they were released. 
Ensure that you install The Sims 3 (#0) FIRST. And that you install The Sims 3 Seasons (#8) LAST! 
Also, if you are having trouble install #1 (World Adventures) due to it not updating, simply skip to #2 (Ambitions) and go back to #1 afterwords. It should fix the problem

The torrent includes;
The Sims 3
The Sims 3 World Adventures
The Sims 3 Ambitions
The Sims 3 Late Night
The Sims 3 Generations
The Sims 3 Pets
The Sims 3 Showtime
The Sims 3 Supernatural
The Sims 3 Seasons

Stuff Packs:
High End Loft
Fast Lane 
Outdoor Living
Town Life
Master Suite
Katy Perry Sweet Treats
Diesel





**** WARNING*** DO NOT FORGET TO BACKUP YOUR OLD FILES BEFORE REPLACING! ***** WARNING ****
The only crack you have to place is the last one, Seasons. I've included the crack in the Seasons Folder.
You have to go into where you installed the Sims 3 at (For most people, it's located in Local Disc C -> Program -> 
Electron Arts -> The Sims 3 -> Game -> Bin 


Replace the two files (TS3W and TSLHost.DLL) and simply start the game with TS3W!



Enjoy!

P.S: All Serial Codes are included as well.
