Marvel Graphic Novel 5 X-Men:  God Loves, Man Kills is a graphic novel published in 1982 by Marvel Comics, starring their popular superhero team the X-Men. It was written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Brent Anderson.

The story concerns a minister, the Reverend William Stryker, stirring up religious anti-mutant fervor and kidnapping Professor X in an attempt to eradicate all mutants. The heroes do not fight any costumed super-villains in the story.  Although Magneto is featured in the graphic novel, he is not the X-Men's foe here, but rather forms an alliance with them against William Stryker. The X-Men members featured in this story are:  Professor X; Cyclops; Storm; Wolverine; Nightcrawler; Colossus; and Ariel.  Other characters who appear are:  Colossus' sister, Illyana Rasputin (after she is aged by Belasco, but before she adopts the identity of Magik and/or joins the New Mutants;) and the X-Men's civilian ally and friend, Stevie Hunter.
