The IMDB says: C.R.A.Z.Y. 2005  Drama. Extraordinary lives of ordinary people in search of love and happiness - that's the premise of "C.R.A.Z.Y", a family drama unlike any other.  

I de-muxed it and re-muxed it (whatever that is) and worked with the IFO files in the Video_ts file, and got it down to 595mb, as an .avi (it was 7.49gb!) And I did it all for you! I haven't even watched it yet, but the IMDB gave it a 7.9 out of 10. It must be a good movie. It is in French-Canadian, with English subtitles. 

It failed, and only had an interview and some commercials for another movie, by the same guy. So I did it agaim with the Italian version, hard-coded, and with English subtitles, hard-coded. It is 1.38gb .mpeg4. I made it especially for the people on thepiratebay. That means you, oh pirate. Arrrr. Shiver me timbers, it worked!
