It's A Miracle

Chloe and June have different feelings about Thanksgiving - Chloe
hates it, June loves it. Sadly, June can't afford to fly home this
year, so Chloe persuades June to come with her to her parents' house
for the holiday -- but under the most strange and awkward
conditions. Meanwhile, James volunteers at an exclusive celebrity
soup kitchen in order to get a photo opp, and is unpleasantly
surprised when he and Luther get roped into actually working.
