I'm assuming its legit since Acesn8s's torrents always are:)"
,svalley,2012-11-23T21:16Z,Of course it's legit! :-)
,jayrockskee,2012-11-24T01:36Z,Watch my balls dangle over your mother's mouth Maky. Get a fucking life

the quality is just not acceptable to enjoy the movie
DVD is the minimum, and this is like a 240p piece of bad quality bs"
,fagg0try,2012-11-24T02:39Z,Lol @ 240p
,XxHABlOSxX,2012-11-24T06:39Z,"@rastamees of course its gonna be bad quality you dumb fuck, it just came out in theaters. since you dont know what that means apparently then you dont need to be on this website. just fuckin enjoy the damn movie. no i didnt download this one from this uploader but just gtfo. nobody cares what the quality is, as long as you dont have to go out and waste about $10 a person. people like you make me sick.  "
,leaves,2012-11-24T07:31Z,"@XxHABlOSxX actually a lot of people care about the quality of the films they are downloading. It's encouraged to rank the video and audio quality of a film you've downloaded to let other people know if its worth it to them or not. Maybe some people like you don't mind watching a blurry mess but others do. To me, this movie was A5/V5. It's is not your average dvd quality and I'll be waiting for a video with better resolution. But still, thanks for the upload Acesn8s!"
,rastamees,2012-11-24T18:15Z,"XxHABlOSxX, take a chill pill and calm the fuck down.
maybe you dont care about quality and like to watch blurry movies, but i do. i dont see the point in CAM releases anyway, its like they are for little kids who cant wait and unknowingly ruin the experience by watching a distorted picture with bad audio. where the hell is the pleasure in watching a movie if the quality is unacceptable ?

and thats my point - you can not enjoy the movie."
[V],Acesn8s,2012-11-24T22:49Z,@ rastamees my point is theres always the theatre mate if its not good enough for you. you don't have to be rude after all what have you shared here besides rudeness i haven't seen u upload anything any better or anything at all for that matter:( its pretty decent for a Cam if your waiting for a DVD its gonna be awhile mate alook here-> http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/5444/Skyfall-2012.html
,AntBrown,2012-11-25T08:57Z,"For those who only watch DVD quality & better, this isn't for you. But for the recording format (TS), it is not lacking at all. Thanks for the upload! Always good work, keep it up!

Also, didn't rate because I'm unsure of the scale most people use, and I have seen severe backlash at those who dare rate incorrectly. :)"
,balrog814,2012-11-25T11:33Z,"I just hope, these fuckin assholes, like rastamames, won't make quality uploaders, whose work is really appreciated, go and say: fuck these unappreciative assholes and i WILL NOT UPLOAD ANYTHING FOR THESE PENNILESS WHINING BITCHES. Rastamames should be banned from here. Cool dude Acesn8 should have  the tool to eradicate these cumwits from here for good immediately."
,Jpasz,2012-11-26T06:35Z,"Why does it take so many bad comments to get 1 good one? It's like youtube on here, I don't know, I sort of expected people to put some more thought into the comments...  And they're always the same too, ""Vid is shit"" ""Fuck the guy who said vid is shit"" ""Just go to the movies if you don't like it""

I for one think it's respectful and helpful to know the audio video quality from the comments, but apparently that's not good enough for some users, they want to make it as mysterious as possible, and any complaints against it seem to be met with ""You're a cheap shit and should just go to the movies and such and so forth!""

If you didn't like the torrent, leave your rating, if you did, then still leave a rating, and if you didn't like someone else's rating, then what good is internet flaming going to do? It's like a pack of children in here for no good reason, if everyone just calmed down and left unbiased reviews, without having to wipe tears of rage from their eyes, then we'd all be fine.

I for one did not download the movie, because it was a cam and I was just hoping it wasn't. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with cam movies existing, it's people's personal preference as to whether or not they care, but I do care, I like a crisp video and audio and can wait for it.

There's not a lot of pride I have for this community because of this kind of stuff, I mean even the uploader is coming in to take jabs at the comments..."
,rastamees,2012-11-26T12:56Z,"i expressed my opinion. i downloaded this with my slow net connection and it was a total waste. you cant tell from the screenshots what the quality is really like, and i was pissed when i saw the blurry image with bad audio. "
,balrog814,2012-11-27T10:55Z,"Just for the record, with vlc one can play not fully downloaded torrents, thus one can check quality when downloaded 10-20 % only. Please, write comment on quality short and objective, and be thankful to all uploaders, regardless the qualities."
,divemstr,2012-11-28T22:57Z,"For me, using VLC, the audio did not sync"
,julllleee,2012-11-30T21:29Z,Thanks :)
