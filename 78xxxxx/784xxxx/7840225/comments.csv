I'd rather like to get my stuff from someone that can take the 2 minutes to check back once a day. I have yet to try one of your downloads because not a single question has been answered.
,IiTraxiI,2012-11-19T22:03Z,"@Mercyflush64  well perhaps it would be a great idea to download them from somewhere else. If people actually read the descriptions it provides a link to self help guides at 1337x as i can not answer all questions as The Pirate Bay is blocked where i am and having to use a VPN just to connect to it which provides rubbish upload speeds so i have to switch back to my main provider to ""actually provide others with the add-on"" now that they are well seeded i can answer questions from other users ""although self help guide was provided in the 1337x.org link"" I do hope that this is a resolution to your concerns."
