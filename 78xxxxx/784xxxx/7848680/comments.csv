[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-22T02:08Z,"I loved the first three seasons of the original show. Especially when they got into cool temporal mechanics (coming back from the past and people you knew now no longer exist and then show up later as an almost completely different person).

But the show went downhill for some reason with ""corporate politics"" being their new mandate.

Jury is still out on the new show. The first series didn't hit its stride until the second season, so I'm willing to wait and watch. But if they modified and lost the original series by catering to ""American"" whims, then moving the show to the North American continent doesn't bode well.

Glad you enjoy it, I enjoy bringing it.
