From the creators of Angry Birds: an all new game from the PIGS
point of view!

Create the ultimate flying/crawling/rolling/spinning/crashing
device and pilot the pigs safely to the eggs!

The Bad Piggies are after the eggs again -- but as usual, nothing
is going according to plan! Can you create the ultimate flying
machine and steer them safely to their destination? Those tricky
pigs have a few objects they can use, but they need your help to
turn these into the perfect transportation!

With more than 60 levels, and free updates coming up, you have
hours and hours of pig-crashing, exploding, and flying fun! Get
three stars on every level to unlock 30 more puzzles! HINT:
Sometimes you need to play the level several times to achieve all
the objectives -- try building a new device or steering in a
different way to earn all the stars!
