I noticed that no matter where I looked, I couldn't find much of Ms. McEntire's music anywhere. Finding all of these albums took a long time. Her 2 songs from Malibu Country released on iTunes are missing since I haven't found them anywhere yet, so if you find somewhere to download them, I will be very grateful. If I'm missing anything, please let me know and if possible, a link to download would be nice.

Please seed and comment to let me know if there are any problems. Some songs may be slightly tagged wrong as I haven't filtered through the albums one by one. All should have the right name, just small typos. I've changed what I've spotted. All songs seem high quality except for the 1977 self titled debut, which I could only find in that version.

I will be seeding as long as possible so I hope you enjoy Reba's sweet voice. It sure is mellowing.

P.S It is categorized under Other because apparently there's a file that can;t go under Music... .-.
