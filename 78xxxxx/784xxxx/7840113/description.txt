"Up Through The Spiral, a concept album inspired by the philosophy and dreams of Edgar Cayce. From the heavy psych of 'Tune In' to the years ahead of it's time 'Automatic Writing,' POE's Up Through The Spiral will have you scratching your brain in amazement at this truly 1971 hard and heavy psychedelic trip through the mind of the Edgar Cayce and of course POE from McAllen, Texas. The CD also contains all 14 songs released between 1965 and 1970 by their earlier incarnation The Playboys Of Edinburg."
