In a postapocalyptic wasteland populated by mutants and terrorized by flesh-eating ogres, a young amnesiac searches for the answers to the mystery of his identity. Wandering aimlessly, he comes to the rescue of Lorna, a young girl who gives him a name: Number 13. Facing danger at every turn, Number 13 fights to stay alive as his quest to find out who he is leads to the deadly truth of what he is.
