,SerSpec-V,2012-11-20T00:28Z,Why are you giving us lower quality rips now in xvid-AVI format? Your MKV's were much better. Please go back to MKV.
,integls,2012-11-20T05:53Z,footy: is there a place we can donate to you ? Id love to throw you a few dollars for all you have done.
[V],albiondean,2012-11-20T17:53Z,"@SerSpec-V  are you thick or summat, for once i'm not having a go at footy bloke, but he has no control what format he uploads, only the original capper has that control, better to be avi, than no format at all posted."
