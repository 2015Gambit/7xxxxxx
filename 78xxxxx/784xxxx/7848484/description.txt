Notes: (READNFO) Source had a timer, watermark and a scrolling watermark. We placed a nice
smooth blur over both of them (Took 6 hours). The scrolling one is still there but that only
pops up every now and again. We filtered the video as normal and then fixed the audio sync,
which was only out by like one second. I'm not normally a fan of placing blurs, but I think
it's the best choice for this one, others will think different. In the darker scenes the blurs
aren't as visible, in the lighter scenes they are. Take the sample and decide from that. Oh, and
we don't want to know if you're not going to download. Oh, and If you don't know what a WORKPRiNT
(WP) is, please do some research.
