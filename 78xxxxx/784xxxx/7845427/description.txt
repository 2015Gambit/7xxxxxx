"Scream and Shout" is a song by American recording artist will.i.am featuring Britney Spears, taken from the will's upcoming studio album #willpower. After RCA Records executive vice president of promotions announced that Spears was going to take a break in 2012, the singer signed a contract to be a judge on the second season of American music competition show The X Factor. A few months later, she announced that she had collaborated with will.i.am on a new track; they worked together the previous year on two tracks for Femme Fatale , with one called "Big Fat Bass" making the final cut. Initially rumored to be called "Sexy Sexy" and set to be released on October 15, 2012, will.i.am pushed back the release date following unauthorized leaks of the album. "Scream and Shout" was then confirmed as a single, premiering on US and UK radio on November 19, 2012 and will officially be sent to mainstream radio through Interscope Records on November 27, 2012.
