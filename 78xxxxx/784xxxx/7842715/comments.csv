,TPBMastro,2012-11-20T05:00Z,Are you kidding me?! Just saw the commercial for part 2. This is awesome. Thank you. Ill be seeding.
,RegimeL,2012-11-20T07:18Z,Come on guys lets get some seeders on this. I really want to see this as I missed it last night! 
,chernye,2012-11-20T20:28Z,"OMG man, i was looking for this, thank you SO MUCH! looking forward to the next part"
,joe14580,2012-11-21T01:11Z,"Thank you so much, can't wait for part 2."
,crumrugin,2012-11-21T08:20Z,Thank you Everything by Ken Burns is great
,chernye,2012-11-21T15:28Z,people are not seeding :(
,BadgerBob,2012-11-21T22:06Z,Nothing grows without a seed.
,r0ssxx,2012-11-22T01:51Z,Lack of Seeding isn't the problem. The problem is no one you can connect to has entire file. I guess we just have to wait until the original leech has the entire file.
,kcomp1863,2012-11-22T04:12Z,"Again, like Part 2, utorrent showing nearly a hundred seeders, but none online! Someone PLEASE SEED this so it can complete and grow!"
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-11-22T17:13Z,"DO NOT PANIC as unlike the big groups who stop seeding in a day or two, I seed all my torrents for at least 2 months. It is going out strong at this end so the leechers must not be seeding back with any speed."
,Lazycrockett,2012-11-22T20:17Z,Im suck @ 95.3 and I really want to watch this and ditch the family.
,topk,2012-11-23T15:31Z,"Unable to finish download!
If you check the column AVAILABILITY - it's below 1 - this means that the file is incomplete, someone left or I dunno what but we won't ever finish it like this."
,topk,2012-11-23T15:35Z,"In uTorrent check the column ""Avail."" it's just below 1.0 - this means that you will get only as far as 9x%, never will finish this download unless someone comes back"
,r0ssxx,2012-11-24T08:12Z,The amount available is rising about 1 percent a day for the past 2 days LMAO. My guess is Torrentlard is some kind of idealist and is trying to force leechers to seed by setting up the torrent so you can only download from other leechers.  My guess is torrentlard will milk the last few percent out till we all upload 2.76gb
,topk,2012-11-24T16:05Z,"@r0sxxx: The Avail. is not in percentage - 1.0 means the file is complete, like a quotient. You will always look for the Avail. of at least 1.0 - then you can finish downloading the file."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-11-24T16:27Z,"@r0ssxx: If you know how to do what you posted then you are a better man than I am. I have never heard of being able to do what you propose that I am doing. I am seeding this at 100kbs and if you are not getting it then put the blame where it belongs, with your fellow leechers who never upload anything but always complain about their download speed. When they limit their sharing speed it only makes sense that it will take everyone else longer to complete the file if I am the only one seeding with any speed. I sit here and watch one leecher get 80kbs and then see everone else not increaseing their percentage of the file at all as his or hers rises steadily. Be patient and quit complaining about what you do not understand. You should be glad that ther are people who do all the work and all you have to do is sit back and click a link. Do not be so ungrateful."
,r0ssxx,2012-11-24T23:03Z,Limit the number of connections and let a couple of leechers actually finish the torrent and the problem will take care of its self. Normally the more users on a torrent the faster it downloads but in this case with only 1 seed it will go on like this for days. Since the torrent is @98.5 percent you should cut down on the amount of incoming connections and seed to just a handful and let them take over the seeding.
,r0ssxx,2012-11-24T23:06Z,@topk Avail. is the percentage of the Torrent available to you through the seeders and leechers you are connected to.
,moopymoop,2012-11-25T01:50Z,"Stuck on 99%. Is there anything I can do to help this reach people?

Sick with the flu so would love to curl up and watch this tonight."
,Lazycrockett,2012-11-25T04:14Z,Thank You.
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-11-25T04:57Z,"@r0ssxx: If you understood Torrenting then you would know that your idea is unworkable. As I indicated, the leecher was taking almost all of the upload bandwidth and if said leecher is at the top (with the most completed) and I restrict it so that he could not leech, I would not be able to seed to anyone below him. Therefore no one would be able to get anything. In plain English, if you stop seeding to the leecher who has completed the largest percentage who would therefore be at the top of the leech list, you would have no one to seed to.If you can tell me how to pick and choose who to seed to then I would be glad to try."
,r0ssxx,2012-11-25T06:41Z,Wow that's a long upload to 1 leecher. Well anyway its done now so thanks for the show. I guess the 150 seeders were all hacked utorrent clients leeching as fake seeds. Sorry about busting your balls.
