This edition presents the classic John Coltrane Quartet's complete long unavailable concert in Stuttgart on November 3, 1963, for the first time ever on a single set. Two of the songs, "Impressions" and ΓÇ£Mr. P.C.", totaling more than an hour of music, have never previously appeared in any format. We have completed this set with the only known track (also previously unissued) from the concert given by the same formation at Salle Pleyel, in Paris, two days before the Stuttgart performance.
