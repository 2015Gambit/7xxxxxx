English is changing all around us. We see this in new words such as ΓÇ£blingΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£email,ΓÇ¥ and from the loss of old forms such as ΓÇ£shall.ΓÇ¥ ItΓÇÖs a human impulse to play with language and to create new words and meaningsΓÇöbut also to worry about the decay of language. Does text messaging signal the end of ΓÇ£pure EnglishΓÇ¥? Why do teenagers pepper their sentences with ΓÇ£likeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£you knowΓÇ¥?
By studying how and why language changes and the story behind the everyday words in our lexicon, we can learn a lot about ourselvesΓÇöhow our minds work and how our culture has changed over the centuries.

Beyond this, words are enormously powerful. They can clarify or obscure the truth, set a political agenda, and drive commercial enterprises. They have the power to amuse and to hurt. They can connect us to each other or drive us apart. Sometimes words are unsayable, and other times words fail us completely because, for all the vibrancy and breadth of English, we still have major gaps in the lexicon.

In The Secret Life of Words: English Words and Their Origins, youΓÇÖll get a delightful, informative survey of English, from its Germanic origins to the rise of globalization and cyber-communications. Award-winning Professor Anne Curzan of the University of Michigan approaches the subject like an archaeologist, digging below the surface to uncover the story of words, from the humble ΓÇ£sheΓÇ¥ to such SAT words as ΓÇ£conflagrationΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£pedimanous.ΓÇ¥

In this course, youΓÇÖll

discover the history of the dictionary and how words make it into a reference book like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED);
survey the borrowed words that make up the English lexicon;
find out how words are born and how they die;
expand your vocabulary by studying Greek and Latin ΓÇ£word websΓÇ¥; and
revel in new terms, such as ΓÇ£musquirt,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£adorkable,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£struggle bus.ΓÇ¥
Professor Curzan celebrates English for all its nuances and curiosities. By stepping back to excavate the language as a linguist, she shows you there is no such thing as a boring word.
