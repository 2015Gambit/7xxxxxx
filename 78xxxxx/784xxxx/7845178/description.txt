After the birth of Renesmee, the Cullens gather other vampire clans in order to protect the child from a false allegation that puts the family in front of the Volturi.





VIDEO - Very nice,seemed a little cropped,but not too much.Video did have alot of noise and AR looked a little
off.

AUDIO - Nice and got to say probably slightly better than jiinx this time round....this one has more life to it,with
that bass balance decent.Still got issue and also oos throughout for me.

Oh the "new source" tag was used because we already did a TS and wanted users to know it was a different source used.


WORKDONE:

Right took the 720p files and resized them,thought the 720 x 304 2.351 looked slightly wrong to me so opted for the 720 x 288
res.....think its due to the crop.
Anyway this corrected the AR ...and from there i used a HQ smoother as the source contained a fair amount of noise,so had to smooth
it a fair bit aswell.Also changed the brightness/contrast/hue/intes and rgb colours slightly.
Once all done it was a case of adding a touch of sharpness back ...only used +8 otherwise back to square one and making more noise.

Audio i had to stripped and totally resync it,as it was oos for us ...needed 11 cuts ranging from -300 to + 400.Once done saved the file
and dropped in AA to give it some TLC aswell.
Tweaked the EQ bands and lowered the DB's ....before saving as mp3 and remuxing to our rip.



Top work on those that got use this video and audio and also on the other audios ( jiinx ) ....so hats off lads
IMHO this video source is best to date and can only see a R5 really beating it.
Audio wise ...this time round adtrg have edged it....got more to it than jiinxs.BUT both are decent line audio.

V8.5 A8.5 M4'ish lol ....
