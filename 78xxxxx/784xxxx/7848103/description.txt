John Steed & Emma Peel are not fooled by the con the new Hellfire Club has pulled over Parliament and the leaders of the UK -- but will they live long enough to do anything about it? Mark Waid (IRREEDEEMABLE, DAREDEVIL), Caleb Monroe (BATMAN 80 PAGE GIANT, ICE AGE) and Steve Bryant (ATHENA VOLTAIRE) bring us 'A Very Civil Armageddon'!
