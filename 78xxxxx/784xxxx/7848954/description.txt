Since this is first a LOL/DIMENSION release and must be pre-screened
to be trusted, I've decided that those wanting my encode of this show
will have to wait for the WEB-DL version a day or two later. Apologies.
Not wanting to stop providing the show, I can only assure quality this way.
.
They're making a big "Red John" mistake, just like they did with Monk.
They'll milk it until the very last Episode when script writers solve it easily.
So, I've lost too much interest to pre-screen it sliding downhill this way.
.
I'll regain interest when Red John is completely solved (no more fakes).
