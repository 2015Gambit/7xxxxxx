ALL-NEW ARC! From out of the ashes ? RENEGADES! After a crushing defeat at the hands of his would-be mentor, Peter Stanchek lies critically wounded and the only person who can save him is the person that hates him the most ? his childhood love Kris Hathaway. As Harada's Eggbreaker strike force closes in, the helpless Peter wonders if he is going to find forgiveness at Kris's door ? or unbridled vengeance. But when Faith returns as the superhero she's always dreamed of being, the game is going to change for everyone involved?
