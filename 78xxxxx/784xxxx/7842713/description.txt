Two years have passed since Carrie Bradshaw finally bagged John &#x22;Mr. Big&#x22; Preston, the man she was always meant to be with. Just as her friend Charlotte must deal with her young daughter&#x27;s &#x22;terrible two&#x27;s&#x22;, Carrie must deal with her relationship taking a turn for the worse - Big likes to watch old black-and-white movies on TV and eat take-out food, which prevents Carrie from feeling like the free-wheeling party girl she used to be. Meanwhile, Miranda copes with a new boss that can&#x27;t handle an intelligent, powerful woman, and Samantha works a public relations angle that gets the fashionable foursome an all-expense-paid trip to Abu Dhabi.
