WELCOME TO the Sixth Edition of Introduction to Programming Using Java, a free, on-line textbook on introductory programming,

 which uses Java as the language of instruction. This book is directed mainly towards beginning programmers,

 although it might also be useful for experienced programmers who want to learn something about Java. 

It is certainly not meant to provide complete coverage of the Java language. 

The sixth edition requires Java 5.0 and can also be used with later versions of java.

 Almost all the examples in the book will work with Java 5.0,

 but some features from later versions of Java are also covered.

 You will find many Java applets on the web pages that make up this book, 

and most of those applets require Java 5.0 or higher to function.
