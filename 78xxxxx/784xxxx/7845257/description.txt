Install Notes::

1) Launch AssassinsCreed3Updater.exe it will update on it's own then exit after update is complete
2) Copy the uplay.exe from the 'Crack' folder to "UbisoftUbisoft Game Launcher" folder and the .lang file to the game install dir.
3) Check AC3SP.exe is blocked in your firewall.
4) Start the game and log in/create an account if you don't already have one.
5) Play the game

These are the steps i followed, you may not even need to redo the .lang file i did though so i am repeating my steps verbatim.
I have left the manual update .exe in here however this did not work for me saying 'incompatible version' or similar.
