,k3nd00d,2012-11-29T04:58Z,"We missed this week's new episode because they changed the day the show is on again. And, instead of showing the show they originally called episode 4, they aired the episode they originally called episode 7. I plan to label it episode 4 when I get it. It is the Ozarks episode."
,cindy25,2012-11-30T06:26Z,"ep 4 is being shown on the trutv website, but is only accessible for those with trutv on their cable

couldn't u download and post the web rip (its the full 42 mins)  as I don't think this ep will be shown on tv again."
[V],psspss,2012-11-30T07:52Z,"to rip it depends what encryption they use.. might be as easy as use tubedigger however it can grab it but it still could have encryption

failing that screen capture always works espc if got a fast PC and set to about 20fps and use the correct codecs.. or grab uncompress is best and reedit it
screen virtuo pro 3.x is good for that
but you have to watch it as captures it may cliche if they have bad web speeds too.."
,k3nd00d,2012-11-30T08:01Z,I will get a HDTV capture of it very soon. ;)
[V],psspss,2012-12-01T01:10Z,"no need I found a hdtv source and fixed it up and added last night

but next time or atleast try the web capturing
or screen capture it can be better results then tvrips"
