Hamish and Andy's Caravan of Courage: Aus vs NZ S01E01 PROPER WebRip x264 - LolzoidBeancake

WebRip by LolzoidBeancake

I don't know what happened to the guys who record Hamish and Andy off live TV, so here you go =)

For some reason, this season's episodes are supplied on Ninemsn Catchup in two parts.

I haven't watched this episode myself yet, but I have confirmed that both the video and audio are working in VLC.

I'm very sorry about the wait for this proper version! I was very busy with exams and work commitments, and hadn't realised that the original was faulty.

My process is now much more streamlined, so now you can expect new episodes soon after their release on Ninemsn Catchup =)

Downloaded from Ninemsn Catchup with RTMPExplorer and RTMPdump.
Transcoded with Handbrake since Ninemsn Catchup's FLV files are larger than necessary.

Frame size: 1024 x 576

Enjoy!
