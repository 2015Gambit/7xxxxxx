As promised, I ordered this CD, ripped it in iTunes at the highest possible MP3 settings (320kbps, "Normal" Stereo, VBR enabled (with 320kbps being the lowest bitrate accepted), and frequency clipping disabled). All the songs are there, and album artwork *might* not be. If it isn't iTunes can retrieve it for you.

"Another Door" - 3:40
"Voices" - 5:20

"Traveled Too Far" - 4:33
"Andelmans' Yard" - 6:13

Total download should be around 101mb in an uncompressed directory. My upload speed sucks, so you'll have to be patient in the beginning! Please seed!
