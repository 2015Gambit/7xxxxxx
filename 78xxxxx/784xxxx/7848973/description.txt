The Darkness is a series of ongoing American comic books created by Marc Silvestri, Garth Ennis, and David Wohl and produced by Top Cow Productions. The Darkness is the story of Mafia hitman Jackie Estacado who was both blessed and cursed on his 21st birthday when he became the bearer of The Darkness, an ancient elemental force of nearly limitless power that allows those who wield it access to an otherworldly dimension and control over the demons who dwell there.  Notable writers such as Paul Jenkins and Phil Hester have also written for The Darkness comic at times.

In Volume 3, Jackie has established a drug cartel in Sierra Muñoz with a narcotic made from his own bodily fluids thanks to the help of a demented, but brilliant scientist named Professor Kirchner. With the Darkness, Jackie is able to take control of the small tropical republic, build himself an impenetrable fortress, an army, even a lover he calls 'Elle'. Most of these come at a price since the residents of Sierra Muñoz don't take very kindly to him. To express their distaste, they perform various acts of guerrilla warfare and in their struggle for liberation, they have found themselves a sponsor in their struggle - The United States. To make matters worse, the Darkness has forsaken Jackie and sided with Elle who is now being manipulated by Professor Kirchner. Powerless, Jackie has been taken captive by the rebel forces, and now aims to infiltrate his own fortress.

NOTE:  Starting with issue #11 of Volume 3, Top Cow changed the numbering to reflect the original numbering.  Thus issue #11 is now issue #75.
