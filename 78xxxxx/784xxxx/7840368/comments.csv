,Llwynog,2012-11-20T04:01Z,Thanks for the warning.
[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-20T15:50Z,"I beg to disagree - full 640x360
Same quality that I have become known for
in over 500 offerings.

About once a month somebody says something bad. Don't know why ...

[T],MP4SUX,2012-11-20T16:52Z,"The proof is in the pudding, of which the ingredients are:
.
This appears to be the only AVI of this episode on the planet.
.
There are currently 1459 downloads and 289 continuing seeders
As reported by torrent-stats.info
.
Take any torrent file there and you get something resembling the truth.
.
The sad truth is that TPB (1041), KAT (653), my client (356) & TSI
all give different answers.
.
But all agree that people in the hundreds donate their resources to keep this seeded.
.
That's the mark to believe.

Yeah, the quality of using a lower than required standard bitrate, and it shows as everything you upload has heavy mpg artifacting and a screwball file size (there is a reason FMQ and AFG xvid avi's are 350 megs and not 280!)

Seriously, 768Kb/s is NOT suitable for live action video. It's barely suitable for animation. 768kb/s is considered low quality according to every encoding chart out there. Good quality doesn't start till 1000-1200kb/s. When I transcode, I use 1200-1500 depending on the frame rate.


MP4SUX: ""About once a month somebody says something bad. Don't know why ...""

Because you don't know how to properly encode and post low quality video, that's why. "
