I then get a prompt saying that AC3SP has stopped working... Does anyone know what's going on here or how I can fix it?  I have all the right specs to run it on my rig according to CanYouRunIt."

,Killa619,2012-11-22T09:50Z,"FIX FOR THE TITLE SCREEN FREEZE:

If you experience freezing at the ""..multicultural team"" screen, simply right-click anywhere to open a drag-box right after you start the game, this will let it load in the background, and you should be able to play. Enjoy!

Also this is the most convenient download: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7844040/Assassin_s_Creed_III_-_THETA_(2012)_PC_[ENG_RUS]_RePack"
