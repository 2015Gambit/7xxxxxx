By virtualizing and centralizing the end user desktop IT organizations can dramatically reduce the cost of supporting the end user. This does, however, require a deep level of understanding of how the infrastructure works to avoid wide spread and long term outages.

This includes defining, configuring, monitoring, troubleshooting and maintaining the users, pools, applications, data and components that make up the VDI system.

This course will help students to prepare for the VMware Certified Associate 4 Desktop (VCA4-DT) exam and certification.
