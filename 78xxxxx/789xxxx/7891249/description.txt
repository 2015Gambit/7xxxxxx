Brickleberry - Season 1 - Episode 10 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
-----------------------------------------------------

Brickleberry National Park is facing closure, but not if the park's dysfunctional
park rangers can help it! Steve (David Herman) has been "Ranger of the Month"
every month for years, so he feels threatened when Ethel (Kaitlin Olson) is
transferred from Yellowstone National Park to help whip the park into shape.
Connie (Roger Black) and Denzel (Jerry Minor) are two unique rangers that
each bring special skills (or in Denzel's case, lack of skills) to the job,
and Woody (Tom Kenny) is the hapless Head Ranger who puts nothing above
his beloved park, except his adopted bear cub, Malloy (Daniel Tosh),
who he's taken in and spoils to death.

Produced by Comedy Central and Fox 21.

The dam that holds back Brickleberry River is destroyed by fireworks
set off in honor of Woody's birthday. The park floods, and our rangers,
along with the rest of the survivors, must re-form society on the island
that is now the top of Brickleberry Mountain.
