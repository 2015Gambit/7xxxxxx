This Iso file is a clone copy of original Dvd audio disc so it has not been change from original disc."
,Sten1972,2012-12-07T12:10Z,"Yes I know that this is a slightly better format, but I still wonder if it sounds better?
;)
The 2012 version in 5.1 sounds really good.

I still reckon when i listen to Machine head on vinyl it's the best."
,Sten1972,2012-12-07T14:19Z,"Ok. Thx for your answers.
:)
I still have it on an old picture LP, maybe I should give it a listen too.
