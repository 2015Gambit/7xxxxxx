Lili, MGM's charming little musical romance from 1953, stars Leslie Caron as a naive French girl who joins a traveling circus when she learns her father is dead. Mel Ferrer is the lame and embittered puppeteer she loves and fears. The title song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, is as poignant as ever. This edition is from the recently released WarnerArchive DVD, which has been remastered and corrected the faulty registration seen in airing on TCM the last few years.
