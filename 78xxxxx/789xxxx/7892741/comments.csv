Although stop show Sydney harbour off, it's way too crazy expensive already.

When i was looking to buy in 2007 (right before GFC)  a TINY 1 bedroom apartment with no parking was expected to go for around my max of $350,000.  It went for $510,000.  Still renting, cause my shares are still haven't recovered to anywhere near what they were.  boohoo, whinge, whinge"
