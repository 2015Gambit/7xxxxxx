Christopher Hitchens vs Tony Blair Debate 


Is Religion A Force For Good In The World


a very good debate between to signifigant figures arguing the age old question, is religion good for people?

the video isnt great quality which isny my fault but it is indeed watchable and the audio is fine.

christopher hitchens is a personal favourite of mine, a real intellectual and crudely honest debater.
