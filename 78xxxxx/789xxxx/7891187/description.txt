Music is a powerful thing. It has the ability to affect peopleΓÇÖs attitudes, to alter their thinking, and even influence their lifestyles. There is no shortage of musicians or bands, in fact quite the opposite. What our nation needs is not another band. It doesnΓÇÖt need a new ΓÇ£IdolΓÇ¥. What our nation needs are Christians that stand up for truth. In a country that confuses ΓÇ£LoveΓÇ¥ with ΓÇ£ToleranceΓÇ¥ we need a voice in the darknessΓÇªSilverline exists to be a part of that voice.

In Christ,
