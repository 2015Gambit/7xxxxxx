People used to scoff at the features that VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) offered saying they could produce most of the technology they needed with home grown scripts. With SRM 5, that claim is no longer possible. With features like the new vSphere Replication technology, failback and planned migrations, SRM 5 has raised the bar. This course has something for seasoned SRM professionals looking to quickly learn the new features, as well as the sysadmins new to SRM looking to learn the product for the first time.
