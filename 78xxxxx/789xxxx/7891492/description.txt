Win7 MAC Address Changer is a very simple application designed to change the MAC address used for identifying a specific network adapter or computer in a network.

Especially designed to work on Windows 7, Win7 MAC Address Changer boasts a rather simple interface that can be safely used by beginners as well, at least as long as they know how can a MAC affect the computer.

The clean interface prompts the user to choose the adapter whose MAC is supposed to be modified, while step number 2 asks him/her to select the operating system, which can be Windows 7, Vista and XP, all three being fully supported.

Next, the user has nothing to do than to enter the new MAC or, in case he wishes to switch to a random one, it's enough to hit the ΓÇ£RandomizeΓÇ¥ button and let the application generate one automatically.

Once you've reached this step, there's nothing more to do than to press the big ΓÇ£ChangeΓÇ¥ button and let Win7 MAC Address Changer modify the MAC address. You need to disable and enable the network adapter back in order to apply the new settings.
