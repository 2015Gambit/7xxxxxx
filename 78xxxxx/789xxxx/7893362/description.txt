Ravi Shankar Discography
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar

Robindro Shaunkor Chowdhury aka Ravi Shankar (that is the "Beneficent Sun")
So far I made a lot of torrents but when I completed this I stared at what I had sought:
more than 60 years of music... 
A 92 years old musician who is probably the major harbinger of the hindustani tradition and surely one the founders of the concept of world music as we know it today.
I was deeply moved. To my westerner sensibility the aesthetic experience was akin to the fruition of Bach or Mozart: cathedral of sounds...
In the indian way... ragas... moods... scales... in hundreds of ways and permutations with the numeric dizziness so typical in the vedantic tradition.

He was one of the first (if not the very first) who tried to expand his music tradition to other cultures.
His collaborations with Harrison, Menuhin, Previn, Rampal, Glass (just to mention some) defined a matrix of art which innervates the contemporary scene of world music and nullifies boundaries between different cultures.

It was years that I mused to retrieve the most complete discography available for him.
And I think I eventually made it.
So let me share this treasure to you all :)

You will find here 81 albums, solo and collaborations.
All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).
The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.
Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips. Soundtracks are signed as "ost"...

Enjoy :)
