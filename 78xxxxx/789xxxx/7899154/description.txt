What Happened to the Humans?

Set in a post-apocalyptic world strewn with cast-off machines
Primordia tells the story of Horatio Nullbuilt, a stoic robot who

becomes threatened when a rogue robot steals the energy source that the
pair needs to survive

When Horatio and Crispin's search for energy brings them to the
