"Dwight Christmas"

When the office holiday party fizzles, Dwight 
throws a traditional Schrute German 
Christmas. Meanwhile, Darryl suspects that 
Jim has forgotten to include him in a new job 
opportunity in Philadelphia, and Pete teaches 
Erin about the film "Die Hard."

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
