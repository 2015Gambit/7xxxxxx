Welcome to the wonderful world of digitally capturing HDTV!

HD Capture cards are analog and you will NOT have the ability to clean up
double-blended frames, remove duplicate frames, or any of that good stuff to
get the best quality possible.

This is for x264 encoding. I will not be messing with the outdated XviD format.
This is almost 2013, not 1995.

Hardware Required:

ΓÇó High Definition Cable/Satellite Set Top Box
ΓÇó IEEE 1394 (FireWire) cable
ΓÇó Personal Computer with minimum system requirements
=== Windows XP or higher OS
=== 2.5 GHz or faster CPU for HD signals
=== Display of at least 1024x768
=== 4-8 GB of HDD space per 1 hour of HD recording


Software Required:

ΓÇó TSReader
ΓÇó VideoReDo TVSuite
ΓÇó DGIndex
ΓÇó Avisynth
ΓÇó VirtualDub
ΓÇó x264
ΓÇó eac3to
ΓÇó NeroAAC
ΓÇó MP4Box
ΓÇó MKVtoolnix


What to Install:

If the .rar file contains a folder, just place the folder
into the HDTV directory. If the .rar file is of an .exe
then that will need to be ran to install.

x264.exe is left alone and placed as is in the HDTV folder.
e.g. C:HDTVx264.exe

ADDITIONAL NOTE:

TSReader and VideoReDo are cracked softwares.
If unfamiliar with using patched/cracked software,
this bundle is not for you.
