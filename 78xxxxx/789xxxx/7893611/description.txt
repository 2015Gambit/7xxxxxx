The Ed Show; December 4, 2012.

 There was breaking news on the fiscal cliff negotiations: House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has a plan to get around Speaker John Boehner.

Ed was in Washington with an Exclusive interview with Pelosi!

Then, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) will weigh in on Pelosi's comments, the Republicans' so-called fiscal cliff "compromise" and Elizabeth Warren's appointment to the banking committee.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell rails against filibuster reform, but his buddy John McCain doesn't really agree. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) joins Ed for reaction and analysis.

Americans petition the White House to construct a "Death Star" to "strengthen our national defense." Ed had the details on that.

And in the BIG Finish, Sen. John Kerry scolds the radical right after Senate Republicans block a U.N. treaty on rights for the disabled because they're concerned about home schooling. Ed had tape reaction from Howard Fineman (NBC News Political Analyst and Editorial Director of the Huffington Post Media Group), and Ilyse Hogue (Columnist for The Nation magazine).
