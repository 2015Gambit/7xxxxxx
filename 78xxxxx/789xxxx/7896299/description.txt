           Invasion Iowa! When William Shatner and his wacky
           entourage roll into Riverside, Iowa (pop. 928) to
           supposedly film a big-budget sci-fi flick, a prank of
           mass proportions unravels as the locals fall victim
           to their bizarre demands and hilarious schemes. And
           when Shatner fesses up at the "premiere", it's a
           reveal Riverside will never forget.
