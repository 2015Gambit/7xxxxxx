Nearly thirty years after her triumphant debut novel, Oranges are Not the Only 
Fruit, Jeanette Winterson returns with Alan Yentob to the scenes of her 
extraordinary childhood in Lancashire. She was adopted and brought up to be a 
missionary by the larger-than-life Mrs Winterson. But Jeanette followed a 
different path: she found literature, fell in love with a girl, and escaped to 
university. 

Following her recent memoir Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal, Jeanette 
Winterson tells the story of her recent breakdown and suicide attempt, her 
quest to find her birth mother and how the power of books helped her to 
survive.
