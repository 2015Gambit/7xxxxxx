Letters from the world's most troublesome (some would say troubled!) passenger. Dear Air 2000 is a hilarious collection of correspondence to and from forty different airline companies. From a former TV scriptwriter who previously tickled your ribs with sketches on The Les Dawson Show, The Two Ronnies, Not the Nine-O-Clock News, Morecambe and Wise and many more shows.
After reading this book it is doubtful if you will ever risk eating an airline lasagne ever again.
