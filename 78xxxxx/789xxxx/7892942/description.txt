All episodes are encoded from iTunes files. 720p MP4 files with compatibility with most devices. More than a few episodes have AC-3 audio with the MP4 container which isn't compatible with all devices. Latest episodes have AAC audio. Episodes are numbered by airdate. Includes the movie as well. I'll seed as long as I can. 

If you've downloaded these episodes before through Cartoon-World or tehPARADOX as pf_episode_hd.mp4, you can renamed those to match the filenames here and seed what you've already downloaded. An untouched 1080p Web-DL torrent will be coming soon as well.

Enjoy!
