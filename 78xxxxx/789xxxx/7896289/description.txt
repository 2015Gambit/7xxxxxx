"We'll Always Have Bourbon Street"

When Stefan confronts Damon with a suspicion about 
Elena, Damon has no choice but to help Stefan 
investigate. Searching for answers, Damon and 
Stefan visit modern day New Orleans to see if they 
can find anyone who remembers the events of their 
last visit in 1942, including one of Damon's former 
flames, Charlotte. Elena, Caroline and Bonnie share 
a girls' night while the Salvatore brothers are out 
of town, and emotions run high when Elena delivers 
some shocking news. At Hayley's urging, Tyler 
confronts one of Klaus' hybrids, Kimberly, and the 
situation quickly escalates into violence. Finally, 
Damon is faced with a heartbreaking decision.
