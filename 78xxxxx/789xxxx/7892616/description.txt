"Christmas Help"

Christmas doesn't seem so merry to Mike 
when he helps brother Rusty (Norm 
Macdonald) move some furniture into the 
Heck house garage and discovers that Rusty 
doesn't actually own the items. Meanwhile, 
Frankie hatches a plan to take a part time 
holiday job in a department store in order 
to get an employee discount to buy 
presents; Axl turns the garage with the 
stolen furniture into his own bachelor 
pad; and Reverend TimTom makes a bold 
choice by casting Brick in a holiday play 
and tasks an overly zealous Sue with 
baking cookies for the event.
