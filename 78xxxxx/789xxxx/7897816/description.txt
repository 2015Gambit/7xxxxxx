About the game:

Left 4 Dead (abbreviated as L4D) is a cooperative horror first-person shooter arcade-style video game. 
Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, the game pits its four protagonistsΓÇödubbed the "Survivors"ΓÇöagainst hordes of the infected. 
There are four game modes: a single-player mode in which allied characters are controlled by AI a four-player, co-op campaign mode an eight-player online versus mode and a four-player survival mode. 
In all modes, an artificial intelligence (AI), dubbed the "Director", controls level pacing and item placements, in an attempt to create a dynamic experience and increase replay value.
Pennsylvania suffers an outbreak of "Green Flu" a highly contagious virus causing extreme aggression, mutation to the body cells, and loss of higher brain functions. 
Two weeks after the infection four immune survivorsΓÇöBill, a Vietnam veteran Zoey, a college student Louis, an IT analyst, and Francis, an outlaw bikerΓÇömake their way through the city of Fairfield, only to discover that the virus is creating more dangerous mutations. 
After narrowly avoiding these new infected, along with hordes of others, the survivors are alerted to the presence of an evacuation point at the nearby Mercy Hospital roof by a passing helicopter. 
Fighting their way through the city's streets, subway and sewers, they are rescued from the hospital's roof by the pilot, only to discover he is infected......
