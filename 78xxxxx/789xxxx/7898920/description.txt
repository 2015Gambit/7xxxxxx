Apparently there's a leak to this mysterious and foreboding alley behind UseNet
Just look at what was shoved over my transom!
Bet you don't even know what a transom is ... luckily you don't have to.
.
If you can do UseNet, my originals are from there, so you can too.
.
I know you're NOT seven years old, but I want this understood by thems that are.
.
The UPSIDES:
.
I have all 13 episodes for season two in 720p Blu-ray rip (not mine).
This Torrent has ONLY the FIRST EPISODE in three levels of quality
You probably ONLY WANT ONE of them.
Look at the file names, sizes and probably d/l the NFO file(s) first.
.
If you don't know how to download just part of a torrent, fer crissakes ask someone!
Wasting bandwidth on what you don't want delays others with what they do want.
.
Now the DOWNSIDES:
.
If it's text on the screen, it's in FRENCH (someone should do a translate.srt - you?)
In this first episode, there are exactly two places where translation is a must.
Please excuse my pitiful two line subtitle .srt - it gets the job done.
.
If it's spoken, it's in ENGLISH (French accent, go figure).
.
The original ripper labels this "INTERNAL" for that reason.
Who am I to know different?
.
Was unsure of how to present this - three different torrents?
Competing with myself has never been particularly fruitful.
So, I'm putting it ON YOUR HEAD. If you don't read and default to just
downloading everything, you'll get more that you don't want than what you do.
Again, that's on your head - I've posted clear directions to HERE.
.
If you just want to see quickly "what's it all about" (is it real?) do the 272p
If you trust me and want my usual quality, then the 352p is better by TWICE.
If you see everything is all right and want the original quality, Who am I to say no?
I've tried u/l large files before, so I cannot say I'll continue 720p through all 13 eps.
.
This is all from a Blu-ray rip, 720p is original, not mine - see NFO
352p & 272p are mine, all mine.
1280x720 is (5200Kbps Video) (1500Kbps 48KHz 24bit 6ch DTS audio) 2.18GB
624x352 is double my usual bit rate (1536Kbps video) and (160Kbps/48KHz audio) 
480x272 is 1/4 my usual bit rate (192Kbps video) and (48Kbps/22KHz audio) 86MB
.
Any complaints about the 720p has nothing to do with me, I'm just the distributor.
Any comments about the other two are highly encouraged - tell me what you think.
.
EpGuides says the first episode is due to air 20130104 heh ...
IMDB says some episodes have already aired. I cannot confirm or deny this.
Can't find season 2 on Amazon or TPB. So, maybe, I've done a good thing here.
Maybe not. I've viewed the first ep in 272p & 352p and see no problems.
.
So, with all that in mind ... Enjoy!
