"Merry Crap-Mas"

The Weavers ask the Bird-Kersees to hide the 
multitude of Christmas gifts they've purchased for 
Amber, Max and Abby. But when Marty and Debbie are 
put off by their kids' entitled attitude towards 
the holiday, they decide to return all the gifts 
and put the money toward a family vacation where 
they can focus on the true meaning of the holiday. 
There's just one problem: Larry Bird has opened 
one of their gifts, spawning a frenzy of gift 
opening among the aliens and leaving the Weavers 
with no gifts and no way to pay for the trip. Can 
alien "Scrooge" Larry Bird save Christmas for the 
Weavers?
