Past Present is the twelfth album by Irish folk group Clannad, released in 1989. It is a compilation of the band's work up to 1989. It includes two new songs not found on any previous or (to date) successive Clannad album, "The Hunter" and "World of Difference". Three singles were released to promote the compilation: "The Hunter", "In a Lifetime" (re-issue) and the band's only double A-side "Hourglass"/"Theme from Harry's Game". A book of sheet music for all songs except "Stepping Stone" was also produced.
