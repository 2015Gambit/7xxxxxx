This document is written for the in-between group of people.Toolmakers will frown
upon this document and yet it may provide you with some useful insight (even if it
better the tools you manufacture) . it attempts to provide a methodology for hacking.
It attemp to answers to 'how to' question, not the "why" or the "who". It completely
sidesteps the moral issue of hacking,it also does not address the issue of hackers/
crackers/black hats/gray hats/white hats.it assumes that you have been in this industry 
long enough to be beyond the point of worrying about it. It does not try to make any
excuses for hacking , it does not try to pretend that hacking is a interesting past-time.
The document is written for the serious cyber criminal.
All of this sounds a bit hectic and harsh.The fact of the matter is that sysadmins,
security consultants, and IT managers will find this document just as interesting as
Cyber Criminals will.
