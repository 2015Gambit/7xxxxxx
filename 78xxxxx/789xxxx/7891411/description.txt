Why use Driver Reviver?
Considering all of the individual components on your PC, not to mention external devices such as printers, scanners, web cams, Hard Drives and more, keeping abreast of all the latest Drivers can not only be a time consuming and tedious task, but also one that can be terribly confusing.

Driver Reviver solves this problem by allowing you to scan all of your hardware to identify the current Driver that is installed on your system, and determines if it is the most up-to-date version. Once the required updates are identified, Driver Reviver then allows you to quickly and easily download and install all these updates from one central location. Driver Reviver ensures you are getting the maximum performance from your PC, its components and its software.

One of the most important features of Driver Reviver is how it sources its Driver updates. Other Driver update tools collect their Driver's from various sources on the Internet and store them on local servers which runs the risk of the Drivers being obsolete or even worse, not being from the original equipment manufacturer and potentially containing crapware or spyware.

Driver Reviver Features and Benefits

Eliminates the risk of downloading a faulty Driver or even malware. The wrong Driver or malware could render your PC inoperable and potentially put you at risk of identity theft.
Saves you time. It can take numerous hours to track down each Driver for each single piece of hardware connected to your PC. Driver Reviver accomplishes this in minutes.
Protects you from mistakes. The restore point setting in Driver Reviver ensures that if there are any problems with an update, the changes can be easily reversed to get you back up and running in no time.
No need to be tech-savvy. It can take considerable PC knowledge to scan for Drivers, download them, and install them correctly. Driver Reviver does all of this for you, quickly, easily and safely.
Driver Reviver is RISK FREE. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase, simply contact our customer care team within 30 days of your purchase, and we will give you your money back.
Prevents you from incorrectly using the wrong Driver. Drivers are hardware-dependent and operating-system-specific. This means that Drivers (1) must be compatible to your PC's operating system, and (2) be suited to your hardware's brand and model. Driver Reviver automatically works on this basis so you're assured that Driver update recommendations are specific to your system and hardware.
