If youΓÇÖve ever wanted to write Mac apps, but didnΓÇÖt know how to get started, this is the course for you. IΓÇÖll take you through it step-by-step from the *very* beginning. You donΓÇÖt need much experience; the target audience is a hobbyist web developer whoΓÇÖs done some coding in Javascript and maybe some PHP, but has never written a complex app before. As long as you know what a variable and a function is, youΓÇÖre ready!
In this course, Bryan Jones, creator of the immensely popular CodeKit app, will teach you the ins and outs of Mac application development.
