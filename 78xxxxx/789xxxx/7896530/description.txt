Welcome to the Hotel Transylvania, DraculaΓÇÖs lavish five-stake resort, where monsters and their families can live it up, free to be the monsters they are without humans to bother them. On one special weekend, Dracula has invited some of the worldΓÇÖs most famous monsters ΓÇô Frankenstein and his wife, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, a family of werewolves, and more ΓÇô to celebrate his daughter MavisΓÇÖ 118th birthday. For Drac, catering to all of these legendary monsters is no problem ΓÇô but his world could come crashing down when a human stumbles on the hotel for the first time and takes a shine to Mavis.



Seed and Enjoy.
