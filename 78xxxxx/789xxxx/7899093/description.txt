80th Live is a excellent collection of later day Sinatra in concert. Would have been nice for a few more songs to be included to make it longer but I will take the 14 they give along with the my way duet with Pavarotti, which is great. By the late 80's Frank was getting up there but really gives it all he has here. The overall sound quality is top notch with Sinatra in pretty good voice. A must for any sinatra fan.
