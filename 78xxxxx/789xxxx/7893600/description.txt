An Endless Aftermath has been caused by every move we make. It's a ripple effect in the world caused by every decision acted upon that we make starting from the beginning of time, to our present, and ultimately our end. Everything you do or don't do affects everything around you and causes a reaction from the world surrounding. Your surroundings act or react to everything YOU do which affects their surroundings and so on...

*Example: When someone gets murdered, that death affects all that are surrounding that act of evil in a negative way. Family members and friends of the murdered react in an obvious manner of grief, anger, depression, etc. which affects everything they do and the people surrounding THEM (who weren't even directly related to the incident) in the same manner. The similar thing can be said for the murderer's surrounding world as well. Everything gets affected by ONE action. And everyone around all individuals in the scenario are affected.

After reading the example, how many negative things have YOU experienced in your lifetime? How many negative actions have WE ALL seen in our lifetime? How many lives have we all affected by our actions or reactions? Maybe now you understand why we're living in such a negative world. This world needs that change. Time to open your eyes...

Our goal is to pass on a positive ripple into your world and bring to light the evils that have resided in and control this planet. We want to pass good vibrations through your ears and into your life so that the world surrounding you is impacted and affected in hopes to make this a better place for all.

We're putting music back where it should be. Taking a spiritual stance against evil, no matter what the face may be...greed, cruelty, hatred, (and here's a big one) religious difference. We all come from the same creator, so why are we fighting over our origins? We should be celebrating our lives and embracing our similarities, not fighting over our differences.

Remember, a smile is just as contagious and has as much impact on someone's life as a scowl. Creat an Endless Aftermath of GOOD in the world!

Open your ears, join us, and take in the world. Filter it through your mind to turn this world into the positive, caring, loving world it should be.
