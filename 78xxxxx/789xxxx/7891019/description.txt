SUMMARY:	RARE AND HARD TO FIND!

"New Order Story" is one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen. From the tragic fall of Ian Curtis and Joy Division, to the peak of success as one of the worlds leading "pop" bands. The documentary is filled with familiar faces, including New Order members themselves, speaking about their career and what not. I felt that this film really conveyed a good insight into what the people in New Order are like, seeing as they are a somewhat "quiet" band when it comes to the 
media. Also, "New Order Story" is an amazing collection of music videos and is perfect for anyone that likes such things.
