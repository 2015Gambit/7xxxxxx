    One of the coolest, grooviest cats who ever cut a record ΓÇô an an artist with a really unique conception at the time of these recordings! Roy Porter got his start as a drummer during the bebop years, and worked hard on the LA scene of the R&B and soul scenes of the 50s and 60s ΓÇô but to us, his crowning achievement is these amazing funk sides of the early 70s ΓÇô amazingly complex, but right on the money too ΓÇô and a whole new kind of music that's impossible to describe in words! Roy mixes funky drums with lots of cool jazzy changes ΓÇô keyboard lines, horn parts, and bass bits that have the frenzy you might find in fusion, yet come across with the down-to-earth vibe of a funky 45 ΓÇô a killer blend that goes way past jazz, and even most straight funk too ΓÇô as you'll hear in this sweet little set. The package brings together all the best tracks from these key Porter years ΓÇô and titles include "Jessica" and "Panama" in both vocal and instrumental versions, plus "Wow", "Funny Feelin", "Funky Twitch", "Love You", "Hense Forth", "Out On The Town Tonight", "Givin Me The Blues", "Waver-ing", "Party Time", and "Hip City". CD features the bonus track "Drums For Daryl". ~Dusty Groove
