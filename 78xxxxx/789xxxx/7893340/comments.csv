Thanks for any help"
,q2323,2012-12-07T13:50Z,"so I downloaded steam, made an account there, and now, the game closes itself even faster than before. any advice? when I press generate button, it changes itself to a sentence with a word MOMENT and exclamation mark in it, and never changes again."
,darkony1992,2012-12-07T14:02Z,@q2323 I think you should install steam. I have steam installed and it works fine. Also try running the launcher as an administrator.
,q2323,2012-12-07T14:34Z,"I have got it working!! 

You need to have steam INSTALLED, and CLOSED. then you can run the launcher and generate something."
,russianhornybear,2012-12-07T15:45Z,Non Steam but Steam required to play? Lame...
,guy92,2012-12-07T15:49Z,"This is the third time that I have downloaded this game and unable to run it!
I face the same problem as q2323 when I click generate a sentence with a word MOMENT and '!' comes and nothing else for long time...
run as admin, and installed steam and kept it closed
(also downloaded steam again through the launcher)
still it shows black screen and force closes
please help"
