With 21st Century Astronomy, students see the universe through the eyes of a scientist.
21st Century AstronomyΓÇÖs distinctive writing style, superior art, and supporting media package all work together to teach students how science works, help students visualize basic concepts and physical processes, and keep students focused on the 'big picture.'
For the Third Edition, the entire text has been reread from a studentΓÇÖs perspective and rewritten to eliminate jargon and ensure that the bookΓÇÖs hallmark tone resounds throughout every chapter. New Visual Analogy icons help students connect the textual analogies used to describe physical processes with the figures that illustrate them, and new AstroTour animations and simulations developed at the University of Nebraska provide students with opportunities for interactive learning.
