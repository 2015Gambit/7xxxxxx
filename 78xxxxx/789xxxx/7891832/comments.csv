Oh, I see this was directly on request for me. :P

I gotta ask, does this have any of the registry tweaks that are present in your Win7 lite 32bit v3, or is the OS configuration itself stock?"
,nileshtambe,2012-12-06T11:48Z,"@RinTosaka
it has most of reg tweaks like all others its not like plain vanilla 

yeah defiantly u requested 2-3 times so i am uploading made this long time back but not uploaded.

like 32 bit in this iso also i have not removed lang 
so give me feedback u r able to use these lang
otherwise no point in keeping them in lite version just to waste space of 500 mb~1 gb in installed os."
