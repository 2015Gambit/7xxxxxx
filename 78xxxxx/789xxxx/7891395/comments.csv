[T],bill_214,2012-12-06T00:23Z,"miamisunset, that's bullshit.

During the most prosperous time in US history the upper tax rate was 91% and all that's going to happen now is we just go back to the Clinton rates which were in effect during the last prosperous time in US history.

I'm sure the rich will flee in droves over that additional 4 cents on the dollar. Get real."
,trueholygoat,2012-12-06T06:18Z,I'll happily support returning to the Clinton tax rates just as soon as the Progressive left agrees to return to the Clinton spending rates.
,frobknob,2012-12-06T21:25Z,"@bill_214: There were also tons of loopholes that made sure that no on in the 91% tax bracket ever actually paid those rates.

Tax the rich at confiscatory rates and you'll find out very, very quickly that the rich have ways of hiding their money. It's not like this is a new idea."
