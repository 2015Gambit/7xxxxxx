In this two DVD set, I teamed up with my good friend and outstanding bass player, Thomas Brinkley. Thomas and I have played together for years and have done several tours together. Learn from our experience playing both together and with other groups. We will teach you some of the "tricks from the road" that we have learned over the years.

You'll learn how to find the "holes" to fill. I'll show you what to fill in those holes. We'll talk about leaving space, backing up others, the "one drop", some slick chord progressions, soloing concepts, staying in the pocket and much more!

In the second DVD, Thomas and I let loose and play around with the groove. You'll see in real time how we put together a groove, solo over it and interact with one another.
