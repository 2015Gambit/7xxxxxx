Each package contains the e-book and example code files. ;-)

This is almost the Ultimate 'Head First' Collection. Why? Because it's not perfect yet. It contains some poor quality IMAGE editions, which are not suitable for reading on the screen, they suck. Once I found the TEXT editions, this compilation will be the ULTIMATE one so far. The IMAGE versions are marked by (*). If you have one, several or all these e-books in their TEXT edition, please share them and let me know so that I can integrate the best torrent. Thanks for downloading!

Enjoy!
