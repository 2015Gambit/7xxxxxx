   Perhaps your energy is dragging, but you need laser-sharp focus for a meeting or exam or presentation.
Maybe concentrating on a single task has never been one of your strong points. Now you can easily reach
high-performance brain states, ideal for increasing cognition and focusing on any task. Nobel
Prize-winning scientist Sir Francis Crick believes that the 40hz brainwave frequency used on this
program is ΓÇ£key to the act of cognition.ΓÇ¥ See for yourself.

   Simply slip on your headphones, press play, and within minutes your brain waves will become organized
into a state of ΓÇ£high-coherence.ΓÇ¥ This state of crystal clear clarity arises when both hemispheres of your
brain become balanced and mental energy is maximized. Suddenly youΓÇÖll feel your mind focusing like a laser
beam as your brain releases catecholamines, which boost your learning and memory skills.
