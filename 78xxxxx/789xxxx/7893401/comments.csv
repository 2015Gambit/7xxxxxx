both one in the same thing..

It's a HUGE upload.... the previous biggy was Avatar which took nearly a week before it broke 25 seeders.. and then it just shot up... Inception did the same thing.. and now look at it... over 150 seeders give or take depending on the say.

I'm still seeding this.. and i'm just kind ""preloading"" the two towers right now allowing others to get a head start.... once I get the screenshots organized and uploaded.. it'll appear here."
,Phenom100,2012-12-07T15:51Z,"yeah I'm downloading two towers too struck done till 35%.. hope it will finish soon.

# Btw judas I've combined both parts by using mkv merge and later muxed them into mp4 without any flaws. But can u tell me what is the advantage of adding the chapters to mp4 file? hope that wont create any problem while playing on smart phones with 2.1?
pls clarify.."
