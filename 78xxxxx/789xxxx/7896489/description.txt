Embarcadero Delphi is an integrated development environment for console, desktop graphical, web, and mobile applications.[1]
Delphi's compilers use their own Object Pascal dialect of Pascal and generate native code for 32- and 64-bit Windows operating systems, as well as 32-bit Mac OS X and iOS. (iOS code generation is done with the Free Pascal compiler.[2]) As of late 2011 support for the Linux and Android operating system was planned by Embarcadero.
