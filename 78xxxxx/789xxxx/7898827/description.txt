My Fellow Administrator,

Have you been tasked with investigating or implementing a VMware View environment? Not quite sure the best way to get it up and running? If so, then I have a great resource for you. I?ve collaborated with Lane Leverett, a VCDX and fellow View expert, to develop the new VMware View 5 Essentials training course.

This course was designed to walk you through:
* The concepts of a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
* The components of VMware View
* How to install and configure VMware View
* How to manage desktop pools, user data, printing and applications within VMware View
* Some basic troubleshooting tips

For those of you who may already be familiar with View 4.5 (or have seen my previous View 4 course), we will cover the upgrade process from View 4.5 to View 5.0 along with new features like Persona Management and the new PCoIP optimization settings. I hope you?ll check it out and find it useful.
