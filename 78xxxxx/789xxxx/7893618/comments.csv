,inverse_of_zero,2012-12-06T14:18Z,"Audiochecker Summary: Linkin Park Underground 12 (2012) 4.50% CDDA

So why/how is it that we have a full album uploaded in FLAC that Audiochecker thinks is more than 95% likely to be just transcoded MP3?! :-"
,g8aso,2012-12-06T18:24Z,"Rather confused with this, firstly I didn't look at the torrent and blindly downloaded it to find it was in FLAC (respect) and also in MP3, but the MP3 in in Joint stereo!
Surely you must appreciate sound quality or you would not have offered it in FLAC, but Joint stereo is the very worst of the 3 MP3 formats and isn't even 2 channel stereo as the name sugests.
It is partial stereo with limited high frequencies. Stereo also in not 2 channel stereo as some data is shared between left and right.
The ONLY stereo MP3 is Dual Channel or Dual Stereo that uses a different channel for left and right, the ONLY stereo MP3 there is.

Anyway, I got it in FLAC, so I'm happy. Try ripping it to MP3 Joint, Stereo, and Dual Channel and you can hear the difference easily.

Thanks"
