This is the complete Hobbit ready by Rob Inglis. I've ripped the original 219 tracks to a single, 64kbps, mono, mpeg 4 audio track. I'm sure most of you listen to this on media playing devices where it is easier to deal with one big file rather than many small ones. Thanks to the original poster, cyclingbum, on TPB.
