A sound so profound it takes your breath away The Trio Barry Guy-Marilyn
Crispell-Paul Lytton is one that has worked together for some time and it shows
in their interplay. Barry Guy's writing for this group is full of shifting
dynamics. Marilyn Crispell plays much darker than she does on her recent ECM
work, and Lytton putters around his percussion kit evocatively. the group's
work together on "Void," "Fire And Ice," and "Ithaca" is a lovely rattling web
of music that conveys a sense of life and danger while Guy shows his virtuoso
pizzicato and arco bass abilities an the brief "Shard" pieces. As it moves from
quiet to frenzy, this powerful, skeletal music becomes extremely compelling and
hypnotic, a sound so profound it takes your breath away.
