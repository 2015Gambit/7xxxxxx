           Desc: Seeking Asian Female is an eccentric modern love
           story about Steven and Sandy--an aging white man with
           "yellow fever" who is obsessed with marrying any Asian
           woman, and the young Chinese bride he finds online.
           Debbie, a Chinese American filmmaker, documents and
           narrates with skepticism and humor, from the early
           stages of Steven's search for an Asian bride, through
           the moment Sandy steps foot in America for the first
           time, to a year into theirprecarious union. Global
           migration, Sino-American relations and the perennial
           battle of the sexes, weigh in on the fate of their
           marriage in this intimate and quirky personal
           documentary.
