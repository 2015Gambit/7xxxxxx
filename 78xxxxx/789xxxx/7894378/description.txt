            Video2Brain - Getting Started with JavaScript Programming

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that allows you to create dynamic websites. Fortunately, it is also easy to learn, as youΓÇÖll see in this workshop from web developer and trainer Joe Chellman. After a quick exploration of the basics, Joe walks you through a series of real-world examples that show how JavaScript is used in actual web pages to create interactivity, move data between web applications, power mobile apps, and more. YouΓÇÖll also be introduced to jQuery, a hugely popular programming framework that adds some great features to JavaScript, and get tips on avoiding common coding problems. ThereΓÇÖs never been an easier way to get started programming with JavaScript.
