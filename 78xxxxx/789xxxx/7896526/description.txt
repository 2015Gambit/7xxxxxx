Firstly, allow me to apologize for re-uploading a torrent I had deleted. I am doing so, because I'm told the one I uploaded yesterday did not work (I would have known had I thought to test the zip, which I shouldn't have even HAD in it).

Cut from the old description: "All 57 episodes of the show as of Dec.4.2012. Most are 1080p, at least one is 720p, though.

S301 and S302 are in one file, though the other episodes each get their own.

All episodes are in MP4 format, if that matters to anybody.


I don't believe I'll uploading any episodes that air after these, but if you're after them, get a Youtube video downloading program (I recommend DVDvideosoft), check Equestria Daily's stickies every Saturday evening, and get yourself the 1080p version."

No .zip this time, since I now know that you can't compress video files...something I should've known had I, you know, GOOGLED IT.

Either way, I'm pretty sure this one works. If it doesn't, just leave a comment and I'll do...well, something.
