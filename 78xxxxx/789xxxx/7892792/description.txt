"Leaving the Station"

At the site of a train accident, Peter Mills 
becomes deeply upset when he observes the 
dead body of a young victim. Unable to shake 
his emotional distress about the event, he 
questions his future as a firefighter. 
Dawson and Shay save a 6-year-old girl whose 
mother is abusing her - but their 
confrontation leads the woman to resort to 
dire actions. Meanwhile, Severide aggravates 
his injury while rescuing a heart attack 
victim and Shay sends Clarice, her married, 
pregnant ex-girlfriend, back home to her 
husband.
