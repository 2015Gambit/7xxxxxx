,FriendlySpidey,2012-12-06T18:44Z,"^ I don't get this mentality. I download YIFY for high quality picture at a reasonable file size since I don't mind stereo like others.

If you desire 5.1 sound, why continually stick with an uploader who doesn't provide it? if YIFY added it, it would increase the filesize, thus defeating the whole purpose of their torrents.

If you want 5.1, there are plenty of other uploaders who provide it, but obviously the file size is going to be larger, just like it would be if YIFY did it."
,PetaFlux,2012-12-06T18:49Z,Is this also upscaled?

,Haloman247,2012-12-06T22:21Z,"Hey YIFY, huge fan. Sadly, a lot of your new releases are Cinavia protected. Now I'm not sure if this program is legit or not, but they claim to have support for Cinavia now. This is the article: http://www.dvdfab.com/news/19  I'm not trying to tell you how to do your thing but as a PS3 user, and many of us, we'd really appreciate it if you gave it a try... thanks. And keep up the good work! :) "
