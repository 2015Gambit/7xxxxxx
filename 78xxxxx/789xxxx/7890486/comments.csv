,Nikoli1129,2012-12-05T13:39Z,Thanks!  Do you have 224 and 225 as well?  The ones that have been uploaded here recently are poor quality and the pages are all out of order.
,thecardmonster,2012-12-05T14:25Z,Yeah that other guy is a tool with his PDF's. Thanks Canary!
,STFmaryville,2012-12-05T14:54Z,"And what have you two shared?
Thanks blackcanary"
[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-12-05T15:46Z,"@Nikoli1129: At this time no other versions of 224 and 225 have been released, beside what has already been posted on the site.  I'm uncertain if there will be Novus releases for those 2 issues, but at the very least you should expect a set of DarthScanner releases to come at some point.  
@thecardmonster: Dude, calling someone a tool who's only trying to help share books that haven't been scanned is a bit uncalled for imho.
@STFmaryville: Thank you for your efforts. "
[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-12-05T15:48Z,"Oh, and of course. Thanks blackcanary!!! XD"
,thecardmonster,2012-12-05T18:35Z,"I really appreciate what you guys do rubrum and maryville. But you don't have to have such a holier than thou attitude about it. What have I shared you ask? I seed all this stuff that you guys upload for WEEKS. Unlike most people who just come in, download and go. That's what I contribute to the cause. And calling that person a tool is not nice, but neither is me wasting my time and bandwidth downloading crap that doesn't work and is out of order. "
[V],RubrumPopulus,2012-12-05T23:49Z,"Well, it isn't really a holier than thou attitude.  I guess from my perspective, I'm happy for everything that is contributed to the community.  I just can't fathom how someone could tell someone who has spent their hard earned money, spent hours of their time scanning editing, packing and releasing work for no reward except the bit of self satisfaction they get and the atta-boy feeling of giving back, i couldn't fathom telling that person that they're a tool or that their work isn't appreciated, just because it isn't up to a certain quality standard.  That's what I was trying to get at.  The sense of entitlement in that kind of behaviour is very off-putting to me."
,thecardmonster,2012-12-06T01:41Z,I respect you're opinion but disagree. Thank you for your efforts.
