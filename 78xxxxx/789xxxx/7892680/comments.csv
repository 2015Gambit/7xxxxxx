The score for this season is 0 damaged and 9 perfect (including this one)

Removing this from the pre-screening process.

----------------

For the record, I no longer pre-screen:

Bones
CSI
Criminal Minds
Don't.Trust.the.Bitch.in.Apartment.23
Elementary
Last Man Standing
NCIS
Once Upon A Time
Scandal
The.Neighbors

As there has NEVER been an error and I find them completely reliable.
