What does an education get you? Education is the only way out of poverty, as it 
has been sold to the Chinese population since ancient times. China's economic 
boom and talk of the merits of hard work have created an expectation that 
studying is how to escape poverty. Yet it seems the system only leads to jobs 
for a few, and debt for all. Weijun Chen's film, set in Wuhan in central China, 
looks at the realities of Chinese education through the lives of private 
college tutor Wang Zehziang, high school graduate and would-be university 
student Wang Pan, and graduate jobseeker Wan Chao. 

A BBC Storyville film, produced in partnership with the Open University, 
China's Ant People screens as part of Why Poverty? - when the BBC, in 
conjunction with more than 70 broadcasters around the world, hosts a debate 
about contemporary poverty. The global cross-media event sees the same eight 
films screened in 180 countries to explore why, in the 21st Century, a billion 
people still live in poverty.
