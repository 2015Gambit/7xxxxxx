,dududus,2012-12-07T12:04Z,"The default game that starts is Revelations which you can play without installing.

AC2 and AC:Brotherhood are PKG files which must be installed like PSN games. Internal drive space needed is 17 GB for both. They cannot be played by just running the mounted game. But the disc needs to be mounted while playing them. (unless a crack appears)

Everything working on Rogero 4.30.

Thanks for this!!"
