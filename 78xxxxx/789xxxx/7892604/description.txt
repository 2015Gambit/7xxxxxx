"Sex, Lies, and Alibis"

After Alex reveals he "faked it," 
Whitney decides they need to come clean 
about their past lies. Lily reveals too 
much about Whitney's former life to 
Alex. Meanwhile, Mark hires R.J., (Tone 
Bell), the new bartender at Low Bar, 
proving to be fresh meat for Roxanne 
and Lily.
