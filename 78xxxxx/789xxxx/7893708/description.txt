Escape from Sobibor is a 1987 British made-for-TV film which aired on CBS.[1] It is the story of the mass escape from the extermination camp at Sobibor, the most successful uprising by Jewish prisoners of German extermination camps (uprisings also took place at Auschwitz and Treblinka). The film was directed by Jack Gold and shot in Avala, Yugoslavia (now Serbia).

On October 14, 1943, members of the camp's underground resistance succeeded in covertly killing eleven German officers and a number of Ukrainian guards. Of the 600 inmates in the camp, roughly 300 escaped, although most were later re-captured and killed. The escape forced the Nazis to close the death camp. They dismantled it, bulldozed the earth, and planted trees to cover it up.

The screenplay was based on the book of the same name written by the American author, Richard Rashke.[2] Alan Arkin, Joanna Pacuła and Rutger Hauer were the primary stars of the film. Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Television). Thomas Blatt, a camp survivor who had assisted Rashke with his book, served as a technical consultant.
