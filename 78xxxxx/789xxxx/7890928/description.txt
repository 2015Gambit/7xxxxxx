The C++ standard library provides a set of common classes and interfaces that greatly 
extend the core C++ language. The library, however, is not self-explanatory. 
To make full use of its components - and to benefit from their power - you 
need a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions.

The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition, describes 
this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11).
