Theodore Anthony "Ted" Nugent born December 13, 1948) is an American rock musician from Detroit, Michigan. Nugent initially gained fame as the lead guitarist of The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career. His hits, mostly coming in the 1970s, such as "Stranglehold", "Cat Scratch Fever", "Wango Tango", and "Great White Buffalo", as well as his '60s Amboy Dukes hit "Journey to the Center of the Mind", remain popular today, and are played semi-often on classic rock and less frequently active rock radio stations.
