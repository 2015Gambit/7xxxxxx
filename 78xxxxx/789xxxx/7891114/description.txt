Ripped straight from DVDs with H.264 (x264) codecs using Handbrake

Contains
>All episodes from the third season in great quality (probably unnecessary large files but I can't be arsed to fix that)
>Behind the scenes material for every episode
>English and Finnish subtitles
>Commentary track with Riku and Tunna for every episode (only in Finnish and without any English subtitles though)

Enjoy
