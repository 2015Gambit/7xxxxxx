This is a podcast I just recorded on December 4, 2012. 

Look, I don't know if Prince William's son will be the Antichrist. I don't know the time Jesus will return. Nobody knows the time that Jesus will return! I did this podcast on a whim. It has been a long time since my last podcast, so hopefully you can give me a break. I'm really rough around the edges.

Basically, I did this podcast because my prediction for December 21st, 2012 was that Prince William's wife, Katie Middleton would announce the birth of her child. This predication was made a few months back before she was not even pregnant. After reviewing a lot of 2012 material presented on the internet, I came to the conclusion that most of it was junk. Most of the information was straight up lies. I could see that 2012 was being promoted to the whole world, like no other event, ever. So realizing this, I knew something big was going to happen. Knowing that 2012 was being promoted by the Illuminati themselves and that material presented was false, I knew it was all misdirection. I still believed it was the dawning of a new age. So I began to think about what might happen. Then I realized that the new age would need a new savior. I thought logically that this messiah would likely be born from royalty. So my next conclusion was that this savior would be born from Prince William's wife Katie. This would be the Antichrist. I first heard about Mercury, Venus, Saturn being in alignment over the Giza Pyramids, days before it happened on December 3, 2012. I then thought the announcement of Prince William's child could very well be made on this day, instead of December 21, 2012. And it did! 

In this radio podcast, I go further into detail why I think Prince William's possible son will be the Antichrist.
