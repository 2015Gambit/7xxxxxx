The Occult Agenda documentary series is designed to awaken the church and non-believers alike to the spiritual warfare happening in the world today. 

Part I focuses on the Harry Potter phenomenon that has swept the world since author J.K. Rowling introduced her best-selling book series. But is Potter-mania merely the result of imaginative writing and clever marketing? Or could there be a hidden power behind the craze that has ΓÇ£cast a spellΓÇ¥ on adults and children alike? 

Pastor Joe Schimmel has spent nearly 25 years researching cults and the occult from a Biblical perspective. His research has led him to believe that the ΓÇ£seducing spiritsΓÇ¥ prophesied of in the Bible are today at work preparing the world for the coming of Antichrist. Can Harry Potter be a part of this occult agenda?
