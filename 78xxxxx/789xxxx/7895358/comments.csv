,backups93,2012-12-06T21:55Z,if this is another 1920x820 I'm gonna be really pissed for you calling it 1080p
,nomad1980,2012-12-07T12:31Z,So you want him to crop it?
,backups93,2012-12-08T02:47Z,crop it? I want it to actualy be 1080p. I got a 1080p screen I want to watch all of it. Who the hell wants to see 2 black bars one on top and another on the bottom? it's like this every bloody time. even 720p is better than some shit 1920x800
