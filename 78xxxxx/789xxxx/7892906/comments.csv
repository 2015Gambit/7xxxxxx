,Mephitis,2012-12-07T02:13Z,"Cinavia SUCKS!

I tried everything reasonable to get rid of it... you know what worked? I bought a media streamer... I got the WDTV Live for $80.  hooked it into my home theatre and voila!  Cinavia defeated.

Best of all, I have it connected to an external HD and because it has a wifi connection, I now just copy files from my PC straight over my home network.

Thanks for the upload Bozx!"
