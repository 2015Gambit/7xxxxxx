Plot: YouΓÇÖll want to book a trip to Montevideo after watching Por El Camino, Charly BraunΓÇÖs gorgeous road movie through Uruguay. Santiago, a twenty-something Argentinean, takes a boat to Montevideo to claim land willed to him by his parents. On his way out of the capitol, he notices Juliette, a young Belgian woman who was also on the boat. After discovering theyΓÇÖre heading in the same direction, the two travelers hit the road together. Both are looking to make a change in their lives: Santiago used to be an investment banker in Manhattan, but his parentsΓÇÖ death has inspired him to try something different. Juliette is hoping to ignite a relationship with a Uruguayan commune leader sheΓÇÖd met in Costa Rica. The two strike up a playful friendship as their trip brings them in contact with peculiar locals, SantiagoΓÇÖs wealthy, well-connected family, and the hippy communeΓÇÖs earthy residents. Braun combines French, U.S., and South American influences with dramatic Uruguayan landscapes and his lead's relaxed chemistry to create a road movie that captures the airy restlessness of youth, in the tale of two characters who start out digging into their past, only to find theyΓÇÖve unearthed their present.
