--> Description:

Single Page Applications (SPA's) focus on delivering rich user experiences with significant client-side 
interactions using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. In this course I'll explore how to build end to end SPA 
solutions using data binding and MVVM on the client, data services for abstracted calls, navigation and 
routing, responsive design for mobility, and local storage. On the server, we will explore layered patterns, 
ASP.NET Web API for RESTful services returning JSON, and Entity Framework Code First for data access.
