   +-RELEASE.NOTES

       Playable Regions: NTSC/U

       XGD2, SplitVid, SSv2, and verified with abgx360!

       This is the first Wave 17 game to hit the scene. Not only is there a
       new PFI, but the new Video data is larger than previous Waves.

       The current v2.9.0 build 421 of Xbox Backup Creator does not properly
       deal with the larger video when building the ISO, so all components
       (game data, video, PFI, DMI, and SS) had to be ripped individually
       and rebuilt into a proper (verified) ISO with abgx360.

       Xbox Backup Creator's author, Redline99, has been notified and a new
       build will be released soon to address the issue.
