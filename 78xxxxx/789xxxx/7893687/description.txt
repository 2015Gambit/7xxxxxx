SUMMARY:


Following from the "Essex Boys" [2000] movie, this is the 2nd Re-Make telling of 
theTrue Story about Essex (UK) underworld crime gangland which made headline 
news throughout the UK and where the full details where never discovered by the 
police. Hence this updated version was made due to the release of additional facts 
from mob members who served time in prison.

STORYLINE:

Rise of the Footsoldier follows the inexorable rise of Carlton Leach from one of the most feared generals of the football terraces to becoming a member of a notorious gang of criminals who rampaged their way through London and Essex in the late eighties and early nineties. It is three decades of his life following him from football hooliganism, through to his burgeoning career as a bouncer, his involvement in the criminal aspects of the early 'rave' scene and subsequently to his rise to power as one of the most feared and respected criminals in the country. 


UPLOADERS NOTES:

I remember hearing news of this criminal tail from the media and also additional 
rumours were spread around the underworld that reached all corners of the UK. I will soon be uploading the original movie "Ther Essex Boys" that was made 3 years after the final event. It is very interesting to watch both movies in either order to get a picture of how the the unsolved murders were portrayed in different lights.

Enjoy it.
