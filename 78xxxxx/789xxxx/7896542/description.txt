Church Service Essentials is designed to guide you through an entire church service, from devotional service all the way to benediction. For those of you who have been struggling to get through a good old fashion foot stompin∩┐╜ church service then this DVD is designed for you. This DVD is specifically tailored for the beginner keyboard player as we take our time and go really slow. Furthermore, we spend almost a whole hour on left hand bass and right hand coordination with tons of practice exercises to help increase your speed. As an added bonus for beginners we have added the addition of scrolling sheet music and virtual chord names. From the beginning to the end of church service, this DVD will give you all the essential chords, hymns, and progressions needed to play on Sunday morning.
