so many of us were waiting for this, and no one else can say thanks?"
,ShoReleases,2012-12-05T20:01Z,"@cindy25 your welcome. :)
As for other people saying thanks, that's ok, just uploaded it so it might take some time before i get a few more thanks ;) :D"
,canoli99,2012-12-05T20:40Z,"I'll say ""thanks"" - Thank You!! To ShoReleases and to anyone who doesn't hit n run. You are ALL very much appreciated!

really was starting to wonder if we'd ever see these episodes ... I'm happy they are now available for all of us who don't have / can't afford showtime.

Maybe one day this series will make its way into our curriculum and our ""official"" history."
