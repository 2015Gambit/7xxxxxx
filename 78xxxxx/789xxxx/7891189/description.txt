D-Maub is "Dedicated to Making All Underestimaters Believers" ... it's what his name stands for. Like most thrown onto to the platform of ministering the word of God, this young man has seen his share of trials and tribulations. When his childhood friend, Robert "Lazarus" Smith pulled him aside and introduced him to Christ, Donny took the role full on.

In Christ,
