In part 3 of "The Hidden Kingdom," Rapunzel kicks ass when hungry ghosts and angry Yakuza storm the skyscraper. Meanwhile, Bigby and Frau Totenkinder arrive in Japan only to get captured by local Harijuku girls. And back in the dark, simmering pit that is the witching well, something is stirring -- and it wants out.
