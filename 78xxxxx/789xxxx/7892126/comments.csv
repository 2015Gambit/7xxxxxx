,jersson,2012-12-05T23:57Z,Installed and copied the file into the appl but it's still in trial mode. I uninstalled it  and went back to the old vers 9.70 again. How to fix this ?
[V],TorDigger,2012-12-06T05:36Z,"Please follow given instruction step by step, Sure it will work, an other hint:
Copy akey.dat file from key folder and paste in C:>Users>..select your own account name here..>AppData>Roaming>DVD-Cloner and paste it here. this step also work.

Both ways are working..."
