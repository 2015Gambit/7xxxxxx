Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, December 6 edition of Infowars Live, radio host Alex Jones dissolves the over-hyped rhetoric poured over the alleged Syrian chemical weapons threat being used to justify military intervention. 

He'll also break down the privacy violations perpetrated against the American people by drones already conducting domestic surveillance in non-restricted skies throughout the country. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes American economic trend forecaster and publisher of the Trends Journal Gerald Celente to discuss what steps should be taken in response to an imminent so-called fiscal cliff.
