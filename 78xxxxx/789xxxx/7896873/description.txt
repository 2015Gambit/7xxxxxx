The Book:

Time-travel back 100 years to match wits against the fiendishly clever Professor Hoffman and his amazing collection of the best of the best from the golden age of puzzles. Some are mathematical, some are mechanical. Others are logical or visual. Still others are verbal-conundrums, enigmas, and more! But the toughest ones refuse to be caged in a single category-youΓÇÖll have to use all the corners of your brain to solve them! All the puzzles and their solutions come to you illustrated with fun drawings that dare you to grab your pencil and dive in. If you get stumped, donΓÇÖt feel bad - the Old ProfessorΓÇÖs been doing it to others since 1893!
