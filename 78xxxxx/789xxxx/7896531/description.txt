Unrelated social conscience section:

Stopping 3rd class "junk" mail will take a concerted effort, but it CAN be done.

Follow these steps:

1) using a black felt marker (sharpie) black out your name and address.

2) also black out the "magnetic ink" line of characters along the bottom.

3) pop it back into your local mailbox.

The post office is required by law to attempt delivery of anything dropped into a 

mailbox. If they can't send it to you, they will send it back where it came from. And 

there will be postage due - far more than the third class bulk rate it cost to mail it 

to you. They'll have to pay first class rates to get it back. They won't know what 

they're getting back until AFTER they pay the postage (the post office is sneaky that 

way).

If millions do this, then they WILL stop. It'll cost them too much to continue.

========== Related action - France:

Ever hear of "The Denver Boot"? It's that cup thing they attach to the wheel of your 

car so you can't move it until you pay up.

In France, every good citizen knows that when passing such a device to fill the lock 

with super glue so every time a "boot" is installed, it is destroyed.

And that's why France no longer uses "The Denver Boot".

We are all just one person.

We are all billions of people.
