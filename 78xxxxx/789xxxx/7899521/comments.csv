You'll notice that some of the screenshots have minute black bars on each side and that i kept the 1920 resolution width. I did not crop these out as the films perspective would change slightly degrading picture quality if i had, tvs would attempt to ""stretch"" the original image to fit the 1080p hdtv displays resulting in pixel crawl and various other artifacts that would be introduced. The idea is to keep the original content as close to that of the bluray and retain as much quality as possible."
