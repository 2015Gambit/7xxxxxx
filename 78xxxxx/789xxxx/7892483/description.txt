WindowBlinds 7.4_Build_320 (windows 7 Edition)


___.xX[...Description
                     WindowBlinds is a software utility that allows you to completely change the look and feel of Microsoft Windows.
It works by applying new visual styles, called skins, across the entire user interface (title bars, push buttons, start menu, taskbar, etc.) of the operating system. As a result, you gain complete control over the way Windows looks.
As good as someone might think Windows looks, it is a one-size fits all solution. WindowBlinds gives users thousands of new looks to choose from

This release didn't come with install instructions so I guess you just run the .exe setup file and hope for the best :/
