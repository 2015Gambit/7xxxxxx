Science Documentary hosted by Ward Robin, published by Discovery Channel broadcasted as part of DC Forensic Factor series in 2004 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

The cry for help comes from Oklahoma City's most exclusive neighbourhood. "My wife's bleeding all over the place," Dr. John Baxter Hamilton tells the 911 operator. "I don't know, she looks like somebody hurt her." It's Valentine's morning and socialite Susan Hamilton lies nude, smashed in a pool of blood. The science suggests a crime of both heated rage and cold calculation, a killer with the intelligence to cover his trail and the composure to mask his guilt.
