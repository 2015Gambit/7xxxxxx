A Young Doctorâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Notebook is a four-part comedy drama based on a collection of short stories by the celebrated Russian writer and playwright Mikhail Bulgakov. The drama recounts Bulgakovâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s semi-autobiographical experiences as a young doctor working in the small village of Muryovo at the dawn of the Russian Revolution in 1917.
Recounting from his notebooks, the Doctor considers his life and career as he tries to treat the patients of a village that is struggling to enter the modern age. Dealing not only with the superstitious and poorly educated patients but with his own inner demons, the doctor reveals doubts about his own competence and struggles with the immense burden of medical responsibility.
