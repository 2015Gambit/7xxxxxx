All 57 episodes of the show as of Dec.4.2012. Most are 1080p, at least one is 720p, though.

S301 and S302 are in one file, though the other episodes each get their own.

All episodes are in MP4 format, if that matters to anybody.


I don't believe I'll uploading any episodes that air after these, but if you're after them, get a Youtube video downloading program (I recommend DVDvideosoft), check Equestria Daily's stickies every Saturday evening, and get yourself the 1080p version.

Season 3 will apparently only be 13 episodes, yadda yadda yadda.
