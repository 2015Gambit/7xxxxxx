This is the best of DiMeola's years with the Manhattan label, which only included three releases: Ciello E Terra, Soaring Through a Dream, Tirami Su. The selections here are an adequate representation of his output during this three-session stint, so this is fine for the casual fan. Those with more interest are encouraged to check out all three of the aforementioned releases, as they are all excellent. Robert Taylor
