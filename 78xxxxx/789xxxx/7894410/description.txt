The Ed Show; December 5, 2012.

 President Obama is done playing games. He's holding the line on taxes and drawing a line on the debt ceiling,

Ed welcomed House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer(D-MD) for the latest fiscal cliff developments and the Democratic line on Medicare.

Then, how is President Obama supposed to negotiate with Republicans who won't recognize reality or deal with the facts? Ed asked former Rep.Tom Perriello (D-VA).

Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio try to re-invent themselves as warriors for the middle class. Ed checked in with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-FL) Chair of the Democratic National Committee, to see if their actions match up with their rhetoric.

Voter suppression across the country was a man-made disaster. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has a new plan to end it and she joined Ed Wednesday to explain it.

And in the Big Finish, a new poll showed half of all Republicans thought the defunct group Acorn stole the election for President Obama. Ed talked with Karen Finney (MSNBC Political Analyst and former DNC Communications Director), about the GOP's alternate reality.
