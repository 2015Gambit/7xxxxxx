Born in Italy, University of Chicago economist Luigi Zingales witnessed firsthand the consequences of high inflation and unemploymentΓÇöpaired with rampant nepotism and cronyismΓÇöon a countryΓÇÖs economy. This experience profoundly shaped his professional interests, and in 1988 he arrived in the United States, armed with a political passion and the belief that economists should not merely interpret the world, but should change it for the better.
In A Capitalism for the People, Zingales makes a forceful, philosophical, and at times personal argument that the roots of American capitalism are dying, and that the result is a drift toward the more corrupt systems found throughout Europe and much of the rest of the world. American capitalism, according to Zingales, grew in a unique incubator that provided it with a distinct flavor of competitiveness, a meritocratic nature that fostered trust in markets and a faith in mobility. Lately, however, that trust has been eroded by a betrayal of our pro-business elites, whose lobbying has come to dictate the market rather than be subject to it, and this betrayal has taken place with the complicity of our intellectual class.Because of this trend, much of the country is questioningΓÇöoften with great angerΓÇöwhether the system that has for so long buoyed their hopes has now betrayed them once and for all. What we are left with is either anti-market pitchfork populism or pro-business technocratic insularity. Neither of these options presents a way to preserve what the author calls the "lighthouseΓÇ¥ of American capitalism. Zingales argues that the way forward is pro-market populism, a fostering of truly free and open competition for the good of the peopleΓÇönot for the good of big business.
