songs found not to be working on legit steam using the damnit appID:


Barracuda, Tighten Up, Creep, Some Might Say

You can try other ID's (Not sure if it will work) or just buy them..

All others songs work fine...


This torrent includes all songs.. including the pantera pack and the funk pack.

The repack tool is also included if you might need it.


Theres about 86 songs in here if I counted it right (and I really hope I'm not missing any songs) also the bass in the a7x songs has been fixed.
