,burt007,2012-12-06T06:09Z,Is this real? I don't believe it. Let me check and than I will post a comment.
,burt007,2012-12-06T06:48Z,"Yes this is real, I had to download calibre software to view it, but it has no horrible watermark and it is perfect. Thank you spanikopita you did it for all of us. I had been looking for this book for over 8 years. I can't thank you enough for this.
 Would you be so kind to share this knowledge as to how did you convert and removed the drm from this book? It would help us in the future."
[T],spanikopita,2012-12-06T11:16Z,"I use several methods to DRM-free my books. The first method is ripping software (I have four different programs that I use). I also use Acrobat 11 Pro, Calibre and Sigil.

The second method involves intercepting the source material. The third is involves retail rips. That's what I did with yours. I found a good consumer version and stRipped it.

The other copies out there sucked. That one with the huge red watermark was a nightmare. I worked on that one for hours and couldn't tear all the content out. It acted like an embedded graphic in some places but in other areas, I could strip the URL and links. Weird.

So here's the final product. It's my least favored way of retrieving titles, but after a little while, I felt your frustration and went for it. And it worked."

I understood only 10% of what you wrote, but finding consumer version and stripping is interesting, I don't know where do you find it and how do you strip it but obviously it works for you. Thank you for everything that you did for all of us."
[T],spanikopita,2012-12-07T08:20Z,You are very welcome. I appreciate you coming back here to comment. It makes it seem more worth the risk I put myself in. Helping people.
