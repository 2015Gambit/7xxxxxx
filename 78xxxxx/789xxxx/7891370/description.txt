Hi! Let me introduce you this torrent.


Just the name says, it's basically Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion with some mods 

installed. The main difference in this collection is that it's the MOST COMPLETE 

COLLECTION OF ADULT-ORIENTED MODS out there. Or at least as far as I know. It has 

most of magnificient Lovers with PK mod series, it has brilliant Claudia's Little 

Secret mod, and much more. There are also many lovely companions for your 

character,who can help you in more than one way.


Installation


1.Unzip archive with 7-zip archive manager somewhere on your computer (but NOT 
in Program Files!). 

2.Copy files oblivion.ini and OBGE.ini into your Documents/My Games/Oblivion folder. 

3.Copy plugins.txt and DLClist.txt into C:Users(INSERT YOUR USERNAME 
HERE)AppDataLocalOblivion. IMPORTANT! Delete line "Dungeon Poses 1.1.esp" from plugins.txt, or your game will crash!

4.Default ingame screen resolution is 1280x1024, so you may want to change it from 
Oblivon Launcher. 

5.To start playing, run obse_loader.exe from your Oblivion folder (NOT oblivion.exe 
or launcher!).


If you expirience TOO MUCH crashes with your game (crashes WILL happen anyway, so 

save often), you may want to turn some mods off, using program 

Oblivion/Mopy/WryeBash.exe. You can learn more about it here:
 
http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/22368. 

You may also have to download an updated version of this program.



So, I think that's all. Enjoy playing Eblivion!



Yeah, and all credits go to the modders who created all those wonderful mods. Please don't think that we don't  appreciate your work!
