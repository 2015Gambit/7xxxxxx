           Notes: This series was never released on DVD. The
           source is bootleg.tvrip, a new tag designating that
           it is a 2nd (or 3rd?) hand copy of a tvrip. We didn't
           record it, we merely ripped the bootleg. Keep your
           eyes peeled for more of this tag from us, it denotes
           rarity, and especially items that are not available on
           retail DVD/BluRay.
