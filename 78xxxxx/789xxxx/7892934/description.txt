"Where He Leads Me"

Rayna needs to take a look at what's really 
important to her after hearing Teddy's side of 
the story about Peggy; Juliette feels a sense 
of belonging with Sean's family that she has 
never experienced before; Gunnar risks his 
partnership with Scarlett when he confesses 
his feelings; and music producer Dominic Wells 
invites Avery to Atlanta to work together 
while Deacon gets an amazing offer to tour -- 
but both opportunities come with a price.

18/Slower+
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
