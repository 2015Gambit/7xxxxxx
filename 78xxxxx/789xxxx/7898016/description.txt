This is a massive compilation of sourcebooks, supplementals, and setting books for Shadowrun 4th Edition.  It includes a lot of hard-to-find books and is nearly complete (save for Runner's Black Book 2074, which is mostly just a compilation of the smaller releases such as Gun Heaven and This Old Drone).  If something is missing, however, please leave a comment.
