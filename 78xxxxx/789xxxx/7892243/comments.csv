,rifraf_jon,2012-12-06T08:10Z,hello twijit thanks for all your work. do you mind if i ask you a question? is there special trick to uploading torrents so ppl are able to download them? i followed the tutorial on the forum but didn't have any luck.
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-12-06T20:36Z,"@rifraf_jon nope, you just have to be patient.

Also, twijjit: I capped last night's South Beach Tow and Operation Repo, it's SD 4:3 AR though. I plan to upload it in a few days time (along with lots of other shows capped)

So it's up to you if you wanna spend the money or not for a higher quality version to upload, I just figured I would let you know in case you want to save the cash."
,rifraf_jon,2012-12-07T00:52Z,@MrUnpopular I redid the whole processes and it work like a charm. So i must of messed up something the first time.  I had the bad torrent deleted lol! Thanks for the advice.
