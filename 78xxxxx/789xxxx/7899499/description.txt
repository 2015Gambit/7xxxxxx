Custom hosts file that I made by combining multiple hosts files already available,

This hosts file will be blocking most advertisement servers on the web, protect against various dangerous websites and also avoid some tracking websites.

I have been using this on 2 computers with windows 7 and windows xp, no problems other than that you need to disable "DNS-Client" service, also on my iPhone 4 version 4 through 5.1.1 atm and no problems so far.

So read this if you don't want any problems when using it: http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm#Note
