SUMMARY:


Madchester was a music scene that developed in Manchester, England, towards the end of the 1980s and into the early 1990s. The music that emerged from the scene 
mixed alternative rock, psychedelic rock and dance music. Artists associated with 
the scene included New Order, The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 

Northside, 808 State, James, The Charlatans, The Fall, A Guy Called Gerald, and 
other bands. At that time, the Ha√ßienda nightclub was a major catalyst for the 
distinctive musical ethos in the city that was called the Second Summer of Love.

Excellent nostalgia from the heart of UK acid house music, illegal warehouse raves 
and Manchester bands such as the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and much more.
