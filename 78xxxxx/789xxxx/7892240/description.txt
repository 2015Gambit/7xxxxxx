Operation Repo S10E24 Warzone At The Worksite (Aired Nov 28th 2012)

Description (from iTunes): Ronnie's gotten a raise and a promotion, and Carlos's jealousy sends him looking for more appreciation. But when his quest for glory goes wrong, will it turn the entire team against him? Matt and Sonia wrangle with a small business owner with some violent cargo in the back of his truck, Sonia and Froy have some hard lessons for a bratty hipster, and Froy and Carlos get in too deep with a dockworker who will destroy anyone and anything who messes with his car.

Notes:

* I only post episodes for South Beach Tow and Operation Repo when xgimpyx is unable to. He's always done a great job at keeping us up to date on these shows, and several others. The real credit goes to him! Also, both SBT and Op Repo are (in some areas) available on iTunes in High-Def for $2.99 USD. Something to keep in mind if another episode is missed, and you want it sooner. :)

* The first five seconds of the video are glitched (the fault of SoundTaxi), but doesn't affect the overall episode. For some reason it only occurred with Operation Repo Episodes.
