Ruckus (1981)

Kyle Hanson is a Vietnam veteran whose traumatic war-time experiences have left him unable to rejoin mainstream society. When Kyle, unkempt and in dirty fatigues, stops in a small town for some food, the local bullies can't wait for an opportunity to harass him. After Kyle uses his Special Forces training to escape the bullies, he becomes the subject of a community-wide manhunt. Only Jenny Bellows, a local girl whose husband was declared missing in action in Vietnam, is willing to give Kyle a chance.

One of many First Blood adaptations/ripoffs, including Thunder Warrior (an Italian film), Death Hunt (starring Bronson) and Flooding With Love For The Kid (a one-man low budget along the lines of Raiders Of The Lost Ark: The Adaptation). Even The Hunted (Benicio Del Toro) and Red Rock West (a great neo-noir from Jonathan Dahl) appear to be different takes and may have been inspired by the book and/or film. The book was released in 1972 and was in development hell for the better part of 10 years, so studios knew about it. Many erroneously think of First Blood the movie ripping some of these films off, not realizing it was the book that was actually being ripped off.
