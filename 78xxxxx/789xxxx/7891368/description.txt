Britain's New Railway

Explore one of the largest engineering projects in UK history: High Speed One, the groundbreaking high-speed rail link.

Britain's New Railway features the team behind one of the largest engineering projects in UK history: High Speed One, the risky ┬ú7 billion bid to complete a high-speed train link between London and Paris. It took 9 years, thousands of people and millions of man-hours to construct. It has delivered over 109km of new high-speed railway, the world's longest span concrete high-speed rail bridge, 47km of cutting edge tunnels, and in St Pancras International, has created a truly world class station.
On the 6th November 2007, High Speed 1 (HS1) was delivered to the nation. Britain had finally got its first new railway for over a century, and was fully connected to the rapidly expanding European high-speed rail network.
