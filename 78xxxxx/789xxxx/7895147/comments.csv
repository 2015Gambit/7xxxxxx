,SerialKilla12,2012-12-07T09:03Z,Reducing the size of the comic images makes file size smaller still going to use this version of the comic book. Adding another smaller .CBR file to fit the needs of users like xenoFLASH the quality maybe slightly lower on upcoming releases but is requested.
,SerialKilla12,2012-12-07T11:33Z,Reduce the file size by extracting each image opening it with Adobe Photoshop CS6 save as .JPG under image options change the quality to 0 and create own .RAR with new lower quality images.
