Soon after the name change, the band was selected to play at the 2006 Vans Warped Tour. While on the tour, they were scouted by Tooth & Nail Records, who signed them in 2007 and released their debut full-length, There Came a Lion, in February 2008. The album hit No. 25 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart and No. 15 on the Top Heatseekers Chart.
