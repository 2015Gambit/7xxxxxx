,LukeSpencer,2012-12-06T06:13Z,"Thanks for the uploads.

I'd like them in MP4. It'd save me a step and a little space since I'm using an Apple TV"
,1964XMEN,2012-12-06T09:20Z,I appreciate it for my wife - got Dell/ Vista and not that cpu knowledgable- theyve all looked good on VLC - thx again
,cbix29,2012-12-06T09:57Z,"Please upload them in MKV or FLV. Your MP4s don't play on my tv and when I convert them, the video looks choppy. MKV or FLV both convert flawlessly using Handbrake. In fact, your FLVs have the best VQ I've ever seen. Great work!! And thanks for upping GH!  "
