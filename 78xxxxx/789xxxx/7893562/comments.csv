,zero423,2012-12-07T14:15Z,"it doesnt matter what your shit ""virus scan"" shows... this is garbage and shouldnt haved even been posted. you know it doesnt work and it most likely DOES contain a virus."
,KingDillaDoe,2012-12-07T22:08Z,"No, as I have got feedback from other users who tried it, some said it worked, others like myself it didn't. Sorry but you being mad will not change anything."
,KingDillaDoe,2012-12-07T22:14Z,And it does matter what a virus scan shows as it is made for this and much more reliable than your instincts.
