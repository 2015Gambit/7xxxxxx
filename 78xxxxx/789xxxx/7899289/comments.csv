•Support for playing the game on multiple screens.
•Game Settings are now saved and restored properly even when using Steam offline.
•Fixes for some interactions with Granny Rags that invalidated nonlethal playthroughs under certain circumstances. (Note: These fixes work even for savegames AFTER the final Granny Rags encounter.)
•Fix for a crash that could happen during loading/transition between areas – notably near Dr. Galvani’s house.
•Reworked “Choke” interaction to make it more reliable in valid contexts.
•Fixed global post-process that sometimes worked improperly during some missions."
