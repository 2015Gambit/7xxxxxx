The only thing I miss is the Podcast versions which take all of the irritating music and bumpers out and smoothly fuse the talk together. The podcast still has her live reads though.

Will you be recording the upcoming pre-holiday shows that Nicole Sandler will be hosting too ? She's filling in for Randi for 2 weeks."
