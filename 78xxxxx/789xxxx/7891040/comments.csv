,STFmaryville,2012-12-05T21:16Z,Great debut by Hickman! Looking forward to seeing how this initial storyline progresses. It's reminiscent of the Justice League Unlimited show ... I mean that in a good way. Thanks GunningHawk90!
,JustAnotherApprentice,2012-12-06T03:04Z,"Thanks a lot,man!"

,STFmaryville,2012-12-06T14:48Z,here you go you little bitch http://bayimg.com/HAGIlAAeN
,Calamity-TPB,2012-12-07T00:47Z,"Thank you, @GunningHawk.

@STFmaryville: Wow, the ingratitude here is incredible. Anyway, I actually commented on what you said on post#1, but apparently TPB didn't register it. What I said regarding your 1st comment was: How's that? Except for a few issues every now & then, I've been away from the Marvel U for some time. You mean in the sense that everybody's there? Ok, I guess that's good. And yes, the JLU series WAS awesome in any case."
,STFmaryville,2012-12-07T04:49Z,"*Minor SPOILERS below*

Calamity-TPB, yes I was thinking of JL becoming JLU in the 3rd season with the League able to call on almost every DC hero. The final pages of #1, and what Stark talked to Cap about, seem to indicate the writer's going to expand the team. Do those symbol pages suggest that each ""core"" Avenger has a group of (substitute? trainee?) heroes assigned to him/her?"
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-12-07T06:52Z,You guys are right about the ingratitude. I pity these idiots. I even pity their parents.
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-12-07T06:55Z,"And STFMaryville, I guess it's gonna be more of the substitute-type. Y'know, where random heroes come across for a particular storyarch."
,j0nnyboy,2012-12-07T09:23Z,bob you fuckin idiot. GunningHawks done soooo much. Where's your contributions dickface?
,STFmaryville,2012-12-07T16:35Z,there are a lot of underused heroes for Hickman to choose from. thanks again GunningHawk90.
