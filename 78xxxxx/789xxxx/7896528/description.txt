1) GospelKeys Urban Pro 600 Disc 1: This is where you'll learn various chords and voicings for the first half of the scale. Jon really takes his time and gives you an in-depth look at dozens of chords to play when you're in various situations.

2) GospelKeys Urban Pro 600 Disc 2: Jon starts from where he left off in disc one, introducing dozens more chords to you in this disc, alone! He also emphasizes the use of grace notes, slides, pivoting notes, fill-ins, and other nuances that differentiate one musician from the next.

3) GospelKeys Urban Pro 600 Disc 3: You'll study everything from major, minor, dominant, diminished, augmented, sevenths, ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths --- the big difference, however, is that you get urban and contemporary ways to voice these chords. Two musicians can play the same chord and sound two totally different ways. 

4) GospelKeys Urban Pro 600 Disc 4: In our last product development meeting, we discussed separating disc 4 into its own category but ultimately decided to include it with this package for the next 150 serious musicians to order. Jonathan brings in a bass player (Bryan White) and shows you real-life examples and situations of these chords in use! You get a front-row seat as you watch him put all of his chords and progressions to use. You're guaranteed to walk away with tons of "A-HA" moments from this disc, by itself!!!
