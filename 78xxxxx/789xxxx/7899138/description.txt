Description:

Light Yagami is an ace student with great prospects--and he's bored out of his mind. But all that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goalΓÇª or his life?

Death Note 13 uncovers more details about the characters and the relationships between them, both human and death god characters. The reasonings behind the story line and more info about the Death Note are also described later in the volume. (It seems to be a databook)
