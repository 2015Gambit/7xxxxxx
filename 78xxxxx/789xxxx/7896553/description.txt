"Love Turns You Upside Down"

The new batch of interns find themselves 
involved in all the drama at Seattle Grace: 
Meredith asks Heather to go above and beyond 
to help fix Derek's hand; Cristina starts a 
healthy competition between Stephanie and 
Leah, which inadvertently leads to a medical 
emergency for Cristina's patient; Alex sees 
Jo in a new light as they work to save a 
baby's life, and April teaches Shane a 
valuable lesson during "lumps and bumps" 
duty.

Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
