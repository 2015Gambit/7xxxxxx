Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the December 5 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the increasingly likely prospect of U.S. and NATO intervention in Syria as warships arrive off the Syrian coast and U.S. officialdom warns that the regime of Bashar Assad may use chemical weapons against CIA-supported mercenaries and al-Qaeda. 

He also continues his coverage of stepped-up attacks on the Second Amendment and the right of the American people to own and use firearms following comments made by Bob Costas and sports journalist Jason Whitlock.
