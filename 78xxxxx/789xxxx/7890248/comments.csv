,Aaronza,2012-12-05T15:54Z,"Was hoping for a bit better quality for 400mb, audio is fine but visual is very blurry. worth the download if you cant wait a few more days i guess. 

thanks for the up neways."
,maccabajani1995,2012-12-05T16:21Z,"i know its a decent file size but the title isnt misleading and i have been the only one who is bothered to put it up for you all. I know it isnt the best quality, which is why there is no 'hdtv' or '720p' on there. but yeah you can have brilliant quality and for it to come out less than 24 hours after it was aired in UK"
,ncraig,2012-12-05T18:04Z,@maccabanjani1995  thanks for the upload so quick.
,iryhousen,2012-12-05T22:35Z,"Oddly, this works better with the VLC media player than with the BS player.  Thanks for the upload and many seeds."
,bexwey,2012-12-05T23:52Z,"Yes Macca, I agree, you are the only one who has bothered doing it for his, this one is perfectly watchable!! haters gotta hate, but for some of us, lovers gotta love ;) xx"
,maccabajani1995,2012-12-06T02:42Z,"okay first off, you commented 4 times in a row, secondly the file was 1.3g, most people dont usually download a file that big to watch 1 tv episode. "
,iryhousen,2012-12-06T15:33Z,The comments disappearing are a glitch in the system.  It happens to everyone.  It's not a conspiracy.
