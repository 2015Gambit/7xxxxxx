The Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage DLC for Xbox 360 JTAG/RGH.

Includes the TU3 (the DLC doesn't seem to work without it) and the Premiere Club pre-order bonus, includes:
-a relic to have 5% more chance to loot rare items.
-a key to open the chest in the sanctuary.
-three gold bonus weapons (useful when you start the game, useless later).
If you don't want the Premiere Club bonus, just remove the 60kB file.

The DLC needs the season pass to work correctly (included in my previous torrent of the Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty DLC).

If you don't have a JTAG/RGH console, don't ask how to install this, this is not for you!
