Four immortal brothers and sisters, consumed in an epic struggle to influence and shape the history of Western civilization. From Moses' challenge to the Pharaoh to the origin of the Grail myth; from the extermination of the Cathars to Nostradamus' travels in Italy; from the Spanish Armada to Napoleon's conquest of Egypt; and finally to the trenches of World War I: a secret occult history of the world told in seven chapters.
