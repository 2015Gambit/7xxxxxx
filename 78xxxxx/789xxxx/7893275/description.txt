PLOT :

Barney Ross is approached by CIA man Church, who wants him and
his guns for hire to go to the former Soviet Union to retrieve
something that was on a plane that crashed. Church doesn't tell him
what he is getting. And Church sends a woman, Maggie with him to make
sure he gets it. They find the plane and get the thing but some men
take one of Barney's people hostage and the leader tells him to give
him what they got or he'll kill his hostage. The give it to him but
he kills his hostage anyway. Barney asks Maggie what was so important
about that thing. She says that it showed the location of a Russian
plutonium storage mine. Barney decides to track the man down and
deal with him. They track them down and discover that the man they
seek is Vilain who leads a group known as The Sangs and that they
have taken all the men from the surrounding villages to work the mine.
