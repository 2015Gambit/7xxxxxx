Plot
   1968 was the year that changed the world. And for four young Aboriginal 
sisters from a remote mission this is the year that would change their lives 
forever. Around the globe, there was protest and revolution in the streets. 
Indigenous Australians finally secured the right to vote. There were drugs and 
the shock of a brutal assassination. And there was Vietnam. The sisters, 
Cynthia, Gail, Julie and Kay are discovered by Dave, a talent scout with a kind 
heart, very little rhythm but a great knowledge of soul music. Billed as 
Australia's answer to 'The Supremes', Dave secures the sisters their first true 
gig, and flies them to Vietnam to sing for the American troops. Based on a true 
story, THE SAPPHIRES is a triumphant celebration of youthful emotion, family and 
music.
