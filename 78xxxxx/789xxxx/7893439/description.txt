Percy and Marilyn are renewing their vows for their anniversary, and their daughter Theresa brings her boyfriend Simon for them to meet. Unbeknownst to her parents, the kids plan to announce their engagement during the weekend. The Jones family is Black; Theresa neglects to tell them Simon is White. Race complicates Percy&#x27;s general mistrust of any boyfriend, so he instigates an investigation of Simon, discovering he&#x27;s recently lost his job and hasn&#x27;t told Theresa. Mistrust rears its ugly head, and in the process of Theresa and Simon&#x27;s argument, Marilyn and Percy fall out. What can the men do to cross the divide between each other and between men and women? Will anyone be exchanging vows?
