In this special production we put notable speaker, Scott Hanselman, to the test: learn CoffeeScript in 90 minutes, then present a 15 minute talk. We sit live with Scott as he probes the CoffeeScript documentation and designs his talk, walking us through his slide design process and code demos. Along the way we do what we do: to throw curveballs and see how he handles the pressure.
