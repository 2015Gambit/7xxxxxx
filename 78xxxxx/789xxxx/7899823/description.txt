From Zero to Hero offers an insight into the life of just one soldier out of the many thousands in the British Infantry deployed to Afghanistan. These modern day heroes risk their lives on a daily basis to help bring peace to a troubled country.

Some of these soldiers are fresh out of school or college and within a few months find themselves in a war zone fighting for their lives. The book gives a candid account of life on the front line. The ups and the downs of fighting a war thousands of miles from home.

The heat, dust, loneliness and frustration, worry, and lack of sleep. The endless nights on patrol or guard just watching, waiting for the stillness to be shattered by the sounds of gunfire and explosions.
