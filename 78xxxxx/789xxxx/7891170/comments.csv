,IndigoAK,2012-12-05T17:30Z,"Dishonored 1.2 Update

BUG FIXES
• Support for playing the game on multiple screens.
• Game Settings are now saved and restored properly even when using Steam offline.
• Fixes for some interactions with Granny Rags that invalidated nonlethal playthroughs under certain circumstances. (Note: These fixes work even for savegames AFTER the final Granny Rags encounter.)
• Fix for a crash that could happen during loading/transition between areas – notably near Dr. Galvani’s house.
• Reworked “Choke” interaction to make it more reliable in valid contexts.
• Fixed global post-process that sometimes worked improperly during some missions."

And I can read. I just choose not to download patches until I know what they do, you fuckin' moron cylinderquarter!"
,elarithon,2012-12-07T20:28Z,I have only one question about the game. Where are the DLC's? When will someone crack them or anything? I'm talking about the DLC's that you get when you buy the game from a certain shop. How is it possible that not a single one of these pre-order DLC's has surfaced yet? Can anyone explain this to me?
