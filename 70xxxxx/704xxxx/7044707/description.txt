                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Top Gear is one of the most popular shows in the UK and the most popular car 
 show "...in the world!" It is presented by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and 
 James May, with special appearances from the tame racing driver, The Stig.
 

 Don't be fooled, this is not another boring technical car programme, there is 
 carnage, mayhem and fun, with less stuffy mundane car reviews. The boys have 
 races and do crazy things with cars - anything from driving them into swimming 
 pools to setting them on fire! 
 
 Yet another example demonstrating that x264 provides better compression
 and equivalent or greater quality at smaller filesizes.

 Video Settings: --preset slow --crf 22 --level 3.1  
                                
                                 Enjoy!
