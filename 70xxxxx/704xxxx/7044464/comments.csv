,410tc1,2012-02-20T07:52Z,so many seeders and leeachers and still no comments! can anyone tell about a/v?
,some-young-guy,2012-02-20T12:07Z,"According to Sample,

A-10
V-8, There is a slight blur throughout, similar to if you were swimming for a long time in a highly chlorinated pool.

Quality is overall excellent."
,piciyola,2012-02-20T13:50Z,Can't wait to see the quality for myself....
,Snow233,2012-02-20T22:23Z,@some-young-guy: video 8?! What the fuck have you been smoking. And can I have some? Video is 6 at best.
,vikingman11,2012-02-21T02:38Z,A9/V5. Audio is great but video is blurry.
,car1015,2012-02-21T07:37Z,"Very watchable a/8 v/6 it's a little blurry, There are a couple of parts where the they lower the cam when somebody gets up, so it cuts of the top of the screen, but other wise it pretty good. M/9"
,car1015,2012-02-21T07:43Z,And I'd also like to say thank you very much Hackulus for getting the movie so quickly. Pretty good copy.

,jOEcOOL0_2,2012-03-27T21:40Z,"Thanx 4 the upload man, but I'll wait for better quality.

A/4
V/4"
,TehAgent,2012-03-28T01:14Z,"for a cam, its way to blurry, you cant really make out much details and sometimes when someone is at a distance you cant really make out the features on there faces.

Sound wasnt that good either quite tinny with little to no base. good effort but ive seen a lot better quality out there on other films, shame really. 

V4/10
A5/10

If you really must see the film its watchable, other wise id wait for a better release or even longer for the dvd / b-ray rip. "
,dynamic_pulse,2012-03-29T12:10Z,FOOOOOOOOOK!!!! why is there no DVDrip yet?!!
,srennie,2012-03-29T23:37Z,"nate_dawg26 (Page 1 of Comments), says he joined TPB just to leave a disparaging comment about the quality of this file uploaded on 02/19/2012. Curiously, he uploaded an episode of Gold Rush Alaska on 02/14/11. One can only admire the prescience it took to join at least a full year earlier in order to ready such a pithy and well-thought out critique. I'm beginning to suspect that some folks may be misrepresenting themselves on the internet...
O.K. for CAM, but I think I'll wait. Thanks, Hackulus!"
,BAPS2x130,2012-04-12T13:41Z,CAM ... not worth it..
,keila0407,2012-04-14T02:22Z,"srennie...omg!!! misrepresentation on the internet oh no!!!! lol
dude if youre going to make a comment dont add to that stupidity by stating something which is done 1 million times a day and making it seem like it doesnt happen otherwise the rest of your comment becomes redundant "
,srennie,2012-04-15T09:12Z,keila - i was being ironic. look it up.
,ds12,2012-04-22T10:46Z,"***YOUR FREEDOM TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION OF THIS MOVIES QUALITY, I.E. THE FACT THAT ITS COMPLETE SHIT, DOES NOT EXIST.  YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR SAID MOVIE OF SHIT QUALITY, THEREFORE YOU CAN ONLY POST IN THE COMMENTS SECTION THAT THIS MOVIE HAS A QUALITY OF 8.5 OR HIGHER***"
,ds12,2012-04-22T10:47Z,"A:  10

,filero27,2012-04-23T00:21Z,"I dont know why everyone bitches about quality.  If its not available on bluray or dvd, its obviously a cam or theater screener.  If you dont like it go pay the outrageous price at the theater.  If thats not good enough go fuck yourself"
,filero27,2012-04-23T00:22Z,"By the way Hackulus, thanx for the service you provide."
