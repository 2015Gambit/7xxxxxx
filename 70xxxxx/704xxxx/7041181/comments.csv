and bering sea gold at same time
so may take a bit longer to seed out espc if
people are capping their upload speeds
like they have been doing all week lately.."
[V],psspss,2012-02-18T07:37Z,"one seeder those other 14 are weird ghost

,johnny142,2012-02-18T07:57Z,I am currently downloading this from you. it is uploading insanely fast on my end at 1400kb/s but my download is insanely slow at 40kb/s. usually they match each other at around 1000kb/s

[V],psspss,2012-02-18T08:38Z,"86 percent now and overall says everyone is at 65

looks unless they add some more on LOL"
,greylion,2012-02-18T10:25Z,"Both CRiMSON and MOMENTUM call this S02E17, why is this called S02E15?"
,greylion,2012-02-18T11:22Z,"To fit it into other releases, everybody will rename it S02E17 anyway, you're just annoying people by forcing them to rename it."
[V],psspss,2012-02-18T11:24Z,"cant you read the descr.. like a broken record here

cos 2 cappers wrongly name a series dont mean
I have too.. I named according to the aftershows

stop posting silly comments about the naming
being wrong"

[V],psspss,2012-02-25T06:01Z,"you cant read their site as it clearly shows this

[V],psspss,2012-02-25T06:06Z,"its says aftershow for EPISODE 16 !!!
