[V],rr-ne,2012-02-19T09:16Z,Do you have ALL the episodes on your harddrive?
,twijjit,2012-02-19T21:51Z,"The only ones I have on my hard drive are the ones listed here, but you can grab many others off YouTube. The quality would pretty much match the ones here :)"
[V],rr-ne,2012-02-20T00:26Z,"Oh, I was just wondering. Cause i have Season 1-4 complete.

on my harddrive.

Did you download these from Youtube?"
[V],rr-ne,2012-02-20T00:38Z,"1-5, i mean."
,twijjit,2012-02-21T06:09Z,"I didnt...as I mentioned in the description, most of these came from another guy's torrent - I just added episode info and removed 5 duplicates. They were marked ""WebRipz"" and I can only assume that means either from YT or ""grabbed"" from the network's website. Feel free to make a torrent of the other episodes, cuz I'd love to see em! I got addicted to this show, cuz it's different - and I'm from Detroit :)"
[V],rr-ne,2012-02-21T06:12Z,"I have uploaded HARDCORE PAWN Season 1-3 (COMPLETE) so far.

I recommend you to download all of them.

Season 4 and 5 will be up soon"
,twijjit,2012-02-23T15:11Z,"Well that's a damn shame! When I went looking for episodes of HP, I didn't see your torrents...otherwise I woulda never bothered with these crappy little 50-meg files :) Thanks, and much appreciated!"
[V],rr-ne,2012-02-23T19:16Z,"It took me about 2 days to get them all together from several websites.

But it was worth it!

Do you like Pawn Stars? I love Pawn Stars!!
