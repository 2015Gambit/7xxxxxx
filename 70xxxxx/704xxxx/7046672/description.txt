Mat Zo is one of my favourite dj's and I like to share a collection of his great music. 

As a music fanatic, but also critic, I always rate every song I download one by one. In a scale from 1 - 5 it needs at least 4 stars, otherwise it's out of my playlist and I won't listen to that song again (also due to the tons of music available and every song just needs to be good).

So these are all 4 & 5-star rated trance tracks :D


Let me know your favourite track! Mine is: 'Tritonal feat. Cristina Soto - Lifted (Mat Zo Remix)'


Besides I especially want to thank -inspiron- for all his great 'A State Of Trance' uploads! He made this possible! Thanks man :D

My max. upload speed is ~80 kB/s, so please be patient and seed as much as you can ;)


Thanks!
