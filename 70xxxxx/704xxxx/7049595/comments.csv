,Punisher_Bay,2012-02-22T18:27Z,"A lot of people are Jealous of the YIFY team.  They just seem to vote bad on the quality without knowing.  SAD, GO YIFY Team!"
,aussietracker,2012-02-22T23:33Z,"great quality for a small file, thanks"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-23T00:07Z,"Thx ! Lucky me that i was waiting for the YIFY version of this movie ! YIFY 650mb HD rip beats all 1.4 GB xvid releases hands down. Great work. Very happy now again. A million thanks, Sir !"
,CrazyMoo05,2012-02-24T03:48Z,Thanx!! Ive been waiting sooooo long to see this movie!!! YAY!!! =)
,michaelrwatson,2012-02-25T02:21Z,"YIFY: Your rips are good, but why not do 1024x432 instead of 1280x544? (i.e. 432p)  My PC, like a lot of people's, will not play the higher resolution smoothly. Even if it did, i don't care to task the processor. I think 720x304 (or whatever is the correct A/R) is perfect, and even 640x272 would be fine. 1280x is gross overkill. A bad movie in superhigh resolution is still a bad movie, and a good movie isn't good because it's super hi-res. Thanks."
,hunkmac85,2012-02-28T12:37Z,@michaelrwatson Go FU*K yourself. Get a new PC and start living in 21st century
,denisdelrey,2012-03-03T14:06Z,Never downloaded a movie from YIFY. I have noticed that the size is pretty small compared to the quality. Going to see if the quality worth it and then i will come back here to give my opinion and maybe become a YIFY fan.  
,lollerpops,2012-03-05T02:56Z,"@michaelrwatson Are you using the Quicktime player? Because if so that may be your problem. If I try to play HD MP4s thru Quicktime I have the same problem, it's not smooth. However, if I open the MP4 videos in Media Player Classic they play perfectly. (I'm on a Windows machine, natch.)"
