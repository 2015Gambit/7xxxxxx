Using the torrent file, it starts right away.
You seem to use trackers solely by udp, and I may have an old transmission-daemon version that doesn't support udp..
It's on linux, and I would have to update the entire distro to be able to install a newer version, and TPB will stop offering torrent files soon, only magnet links.

Please use at least one http tracker."
