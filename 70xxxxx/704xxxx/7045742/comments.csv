[V],ThumperTM,2012-02-21T10:31Z,"as charan99  said.... use in safemode.

Thank you"
,ge1453,2012-02-26T19:24Z,the NTR is old for this version of Norton we need a new NTR to get 180 days.
,mr.poor,2012-03-02T21:49Z,"Hope this works, thanks!"
,mr.poor,2012-03-06T02:27Z,"No, It does not work at all, either ways!"
,bhutu,2012-03-07T21:34Z,Running the NTR in Safe Mode does not help. I have installed Norton in normal mode and tried to run in the Safe Mode. It failed. Then Tried in Safe Mode with Networking as told in the torrent description that Internet Connection should be ON. It failed again. Probably because the Norton 360 interface is not available in either of the Safe Mode and there is no way to uncheck the Tamper Protection. Please guide me to uncheck the Tamper Protection in Safe Mode. Want to try again.

It worked great! It will only reset your 30 day trial though, but it works! I had 1 day left, now I have 30!

Just disable the norton tamper protection (choose to disable it permanently), boot your computer into safe mode with networking and run the NTR, it will give you an error telling you it was unsuccessful in disabling the norton account thingy, but don't worry, just restart your computer and norton should be back to 30 days left of your trial :)

Note: It's very important that you disable the norton tamper protection BEFORE booting into safe mode, because norton will not start, or at least not show you it's user interface when you're in safe mode. And remember to choose to disable the norton tamper protection permanently and not until restart, otherwise it will just turn itself back on when you boot into safe mode.

Again, thank you for the UL!"

,spockman,2012-04-19T03:01Z,"Save yourself from SLOWWWWW browsing with Norton 360. I too fell for Norton when all the rag-mags placed it as FIRST in Antivirus and taxing system resources. However IF you are used to fast browsing, you will notice Norton is about as fast as running thru water 6 feet deep. Don't take my word for it: x32 Top:

,DarkCrow123,2012-05-21T18:28Z,Thumper dude plz help ok so my trial ended now what do I do? D:
,vanillacoke,2012-07-17T16:14Z,"I could not get this work.

I am running Win7x64. N360 installed fine, and the account setup was fine, and the 30day initial trial period worked fine. But I could not get the NTR to work.

Firstly, it doesn't work until you turn Tamper Protection off. But when I did that, it said NTR was not compatible with my system?

So I tried running NTR in Safe Mode, and I forgot to turn off Tamper Protection and it gave me a generic error telling me to reboot. So after I turned Tamper Protection off permanently, I tried again in Safe Mode and this time it gave me a different error saying something about an ""account couldn't be removed"".

After this I gave up."
[T],EvilCraze,2012-08-13T08:45Z,Thanks !
,AhmadLight,2012-08-15T15:50Z,"Thanks,
It worked 100% here"
,AhmadLight,2012-08-15T15:50Z,Note: I used NTR 1.7 to activate it as v3 didn't work
,la_cross37,2012-08-18T01:12Z,"@vanillacoke the NTR 3.3.1 can only give you a 30 day subscription if you're using Norton 360 v6, so it's like resetting your trial period, but I don't think it says that you are using a trial though.

I also got the ""couldn't disable the norton account"" error or something like that, but it still worked.

Remember to rerun the NTR before the 30 day subscription ends, otherwise you will have to uninstall Norton, use the NTR to purge Norton from the system, reinstall Norton and run the NTR.

Note: I don't think you have to go into safemode to install the NTR, at least not the second time you do it, so it's really simple to get 30 days again when you only have 1 day left or something like that."
