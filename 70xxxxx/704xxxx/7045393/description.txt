:: PLOT :: Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt that gives Oskar the task of finding ordinary objects throughout New York City. The scavenger hunt begins at a swing set in Central Park, where Thomas recalls swinging when he was a child. Oskar, however, is scared of swings due to his fear of jumping from them and falling to the ground. Thomas intends the game to be a learning experience for his son so that he can learn that "if things were easy to find, they wouldn't be worth finding". On September 11, Oskar is let out of school early while his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds 6 messages on the phone from his father, saying that he is in the World Trade Center on the 105th floor of the North Tower. Oskar soon learns of the Twin Towers attack by seeing footage on the TV news. As the Twin Towers collapse, Oskar hides underneath his bed, knowing that his father has been killed.
