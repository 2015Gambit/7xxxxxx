,vctrt,2012-02-21T03:54Z,Thanks! How is the sound quality?
,[phrend],2012-02-22T13:02Z,"Thanks for the up, but if the source is a DVD-Screener, why up-sample it to 1280x536?  Doesn't that just increase the file-size for no visual benefit?"
,walkersdelight,2012-03-01T11:06Z,The file lags in the first few minutes and can't play from there without the sound and action not in sync. Hassle of a file which is too big for a screener. Why can't anyone just upload avi or mp4 files which is more convenient to play. Appreciate the effort though.
