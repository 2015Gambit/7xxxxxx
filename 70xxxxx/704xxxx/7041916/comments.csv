,hrmitcrb,2012-02-18T18:49Z,This is an amazing read.  I read it cover to cover on a plane ride shortly after it came out in the late eighties.  I loaned my copy and have since lost track of it after being shared by many friends. Thanks for the upload!

Every human being must read it.
If I get the other books, I shall upload them.
Like regression, he has published a book on progression to future!"
