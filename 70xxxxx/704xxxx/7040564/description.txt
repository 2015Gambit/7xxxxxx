                    Notes:                       
                
                                                       
                                                               
                                                                       
    This film traces the early career of Bob Dylan in a manner no other      
    has ever attempted telling his tale from his birth in Duluth,            
    Minnesota; through school and college; across his years as New York's    
    bright young starl, through to his electric phase, culminating with      
    the controversial 1966 world tour. Featuring interviews with a host      
    of friends, colleagues and associates from that era, and numerous        
    others, rare and often previously unseen footage, daring and             
    outspoken contributions from the very finest Dylan writers [such as      
    Derek Barker, CP Lee and Clinton Heylin] and a host of other             
    features, this film is among the finest Bob Dylan documentaries yet      
    to emerge.                                                               
                                                                             
                                                                             
    Nearly twenty years since Nirvana imploded, former drummer Dave Grohl    
    is among the most respected men in rock music and remains a true icon    
    of the American post grunge landscape.                                   
                                                                             
    Having made his mark in Washington DC hardcore band Scream in the mid    
    1980s, Grohl is said to have performed with more than 30 different       
    bands during his career to date, but it will long remain Nirvana and     
    The Foo Fighters for which he is remembered first and last and           
    always.                                                                  
                                                                             
    This film tells the Dave Grohl story from his earliest performances      
    as a teenager at the 9.30 Club in DC, right up to his global status      
    as mainstay in one of the world's finest bands around today.             
                                                                             
    Featuring rare footage throughout, including never before seen film      
    from his very first appearances, archive performances and interviews,    
    contributions from those who have known him best and a host of other     
    features, this extraordinary film goes some way to explaining what it    
    is that makes Dave Grohl the man with the midas touch.
