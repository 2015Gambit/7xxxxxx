and fast download"
,fooooomanchu,2012-02-27T03:47Z,"NOT true 720P, decent quality, but defiantly NOT 720P quality. True 720P on a movie like this should at least be close to a gig anyways, if not over. Will delete off computer and no longer seed. I will only seed Torrents with truth in what they claim."
,blackarun,2012-02-27T12:47Z,"If you want 720p with 4.3GB or 90GB of size, go get it. This rip is intended for people with less bandwidth. For your concern there is no video quality loss in this rip, because it is encoded in x264 algorithm instead of xvid. Also the audio is AAC 2.0 instead of AC3 5.1."
