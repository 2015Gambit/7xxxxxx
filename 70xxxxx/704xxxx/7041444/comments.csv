,roystone,2012-02-19T00:30Z,sweet.
,kozmo960,2012-02-19T04:37Z,Thanks works very well.  Do you have or know how to activate the remaining components or have a key/serial number that works continuously...most i have seen work for a day or so and then revert back to free version.   Thanks
,LiveHacking300,2012-02-19T15:23Z,"Welcome! :)
It takes you back to the trial version Kozmo960,because you don't temporary disable your internet connection.You need to disable your internet connection first and then paste the serial.After that advanced system care will be PRO version.Now you can renable your internet connection."

,lordpoopy,2012-02-28T03:40Z,When i try and use pro tools it ask for a license code... i opened the license doc in the crack folder but it just has a bunch of jumbled up letters
,lordpoopy,2012-02-28T03:42Z,i did disable the internet
,martyn666,2012-03-03T16:58Z,"I dont know why but i have tried with the connection OFF and done every thing the instructions have said, i try to enter the crack and the license gives me a video that doesnt even run ??????? unless im doing some thing wrong ??? and nothing happens when i open the liscence ???

Just thought i'd let you know...! "
,acsmith1972,2012-03-06T05:39Z,"The crack doesn't work at all. It just stays on free. Even if you disable the internet, make sure all processes being used by ASC are shut down, it's just a bad crack. "
,spikeb68,2012-03-15T16:30Z,DFF7A-8204E-69ADE-0D5AA works to upgrade this version
,Nancy2B,2012-03-19T22:55Z,"Thank You - Works just great with provided serial. When I followed your instructions precisely, and activated the program with the Internet disabled, the activation failed.
The program DID upgrade to the Pro version.
Hurray!"
,marajuran,2012-03-20T15:20Z,"Thank you, it works perfectly! Just install, copy and replace files from the Crack folder on to the installation directory, disconnect internet, paste this serial DFF7A-8204E-69ADE-0D5AA and it's on! Connect to the internet again!"
,AlexRyder,2012-04-02T06:36Z,"Worked super duper, no problems.

If you have any problems just do what is said in the description. and upon re-opening ASC 5.
just click 'upgrade' and switch off your Internet connection.
Then copy and paste one of the many serials posted by the friendly people who have commented.

I used... 

DFF7A-8204E-69ADE-0D5AA

Then after that, you'll be running ASC 5 PRO!

=D"
,JJ_PR,2012-04-04T21:13Z,"I don't trust the crack ASC has the power to see a crack, Id rather use licenses (I put it in offline and then enable internet) 390 Days left on my license"
,Mathrix,2012-04-21T02:34Z,Thank you very much 
,fubarmalone,2012-05-02T15:12Z,"Works great, thanks for this used it for yrs, I just copied the contents of the crack folder to c/program files/iobit and its job done....cheers LH300 :-)"
,Ph0nixFury,2012-05-06T06:31Z,Works Great. Good Torrent
,lordc2,2012-05-11T05:50Z,The key code below does not work anymore :( Anybody can solve this?
,ghandi0007,2012-05-18T00:54Z,dosnt work anymore ?? any more ???
,mrnimesh1234567898,2012-06-07T04:52Z,"Crack worked perfectly! ^_^ Thanks! :)

Btw, i assume i cannot update asc v5.0 to v5.3?"
,DavidBurford,2012-06-07T09:08Z,"I've been using this for about a month, no problems, then I got a pop-up msg. that said there was a new version.....DO NOT CLICK IT.... I had to reinstall after I accidentally hit it and went back to FREE version because they said my license was invalid!!!! ...just wanted to warn everyone...."
,gamertag24,2012-06-11T02:27Z,"the code being posted on here, doesnt work. lol."
,XXD1XX,2012-06-15T09:32Z,"I've installed it exactly as instructed and it does in fact say ""PRO"" after Advanced System Care but it's not actually PRO, I can't set either scan to auto and when I try it asks me to upgrade to PRO... 

Is this just the free version with the background edited to say ""PRO"" instead of ""FREE""??? -_-"
,XXD1XX,2012-06-15T09:35Z,"Disregard my previous comment. I turned off my internet connection and tried the code that's been posted in the comments and at first it said that I had to connect but after I closed that dialog box it allowed me to turn on all of the auto protect features. 

Great upload LiveHacking300! 
(Can a moderator/admin please delete my first comment so it doesn't reflect poorly on the uploader?)"
