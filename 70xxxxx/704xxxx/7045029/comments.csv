[V],thetorrentlord,2012-02-21T08:41Z,"@mojtabata2001: Bit rate and file size is up to the uploader. If you want a smaller file the go to the SD section.                                                                      Thanks for another fine upload! Nice to not have to make hundreds or even thousands waste time un-raring 

files when the seeder (Un-named groups) could save us all a lot of time. Many thanks to all the uploaders 

who no longer use RAR files."
