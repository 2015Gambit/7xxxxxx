I appreciate the upload.

Remember seeing this in theaters... one of Denzel's best.

The video quality is excellent, the audio however is poor.  I notice this with a few of your torrents.

During the ripping process the audio levels get messed up.  For those who use speakers, it wouldn't affect them as bad.

I have excellent quality headphones and I have to use max volume just to hear everything.  

It ranges from having to yank my headphones off from a car crash scene or pinching them to my ears because the voices are too quiet at times.  The levels go up and down.  All my volume settings are max.

Hope you can improve on the next rip.

CHEERS"
