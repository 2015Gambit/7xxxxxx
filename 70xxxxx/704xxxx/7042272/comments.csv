Many of the bronies (sp?) out there hate the Hub captures because it's loaded with badging and commercial stuff...
You should also point out the technical stuff (sound codec, channels, bitrate, video codec, pixel size, etc.).  You did get the package type."
,lazycat,2012-02-23T05:48Z,"Info on this file from VLC:

Video
Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)
Resolution: 1920x1080
Frame rate: 23.976023

Audio
Codec: MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)

Don't have anything to confirm the bitrate at the moment and I'm feeling a bit lazy. I can confirm the source is The Hub, and the general quality of this is decent."
