,zero423,2012-02-18T02:37Z,how come every torrent this person puts up is fuckin slow as dogshit? stop capping your up speed playa!!
,mrnexus,2012-02-18T03:04Z,"boobsman you should include a link in your torrents so that people can donate a few pound if they want or dollars or whatever to help you out out with the stuff you need to do what you do for us mate, for us all,your torrents are getting better and better,great early release games smashing e-books/magazines and movies,i for 1 would throw you a couple of quid for the time that you put in to making this possible for us gamers etc,without you m8 i would be out a fortune which i don't have,but i want to donate a few quid for the cause,thks boobsman :)"
,mrnexus,2012-02-18T03:07Z,"@zero423 /why dont you take the time and effort and get the contacts that boobsman has to give us these games yeah,people like you make me sick you ungrateful fuck."
,dududus,2012-02-18T07:22Z,"@mrnexus

best thing is to get rhg, no more opening xbox for flashing, no more special burner, no more dual layer discs.. 

flashing drives is so 2007"
,mrnexus,2012-02-18T08:42Z,"@dududus /how do I do it pal,can you point me in the right direction to a good video/written tutorial at all,so you don't use a liteon Ihas burner or verbs and imgburn to copy ur games,wtf lol,how on earth to play the games then or better still get them into ur hardrive,I have 2 xbox's 1 phat liteon 2008 model and 1 slim 2011 model but i have the new 147 dashboard on it will i still be able to RGH it if you can help me out with info,thks."
[V],boobsman,2012-02-18T10:17Z,@ zero423 why don't you go download off someone else? Maybe because there aint anyone else!!! I run 2 seedboxes UNCAPPED!!! The reason you get slow speeds is cause im seeding the fucking world! I'd love to run 1GB dedicated boxes so everyone has fast speeds but that aint possible so unless your gonna pay shut the fuck up and remember its free!!!!
,tomi676,2012-02-18T11:50Z,"Hey can i burn this and play normal when I have LT 2.0? Because description says:
""THIS IS AN XGD3 ISO AND IS ONLY BE PLAYABLE WITH LT+2.0 or ABOVE!!!""
Or maybe first I must patch this iso just like The Darkness II (LT 3.0 to LT 2.0) Thanks for answer!"
[T],Sunblock.,2012-02-18T12:05Z,the main issue is that ppl just hit and run. :S/
[V],boobsman,2012-02-18T14:11Z,"@ tomi676 it depends on what drive you have to what firmware you'll need, if your using the downgrader to patch for LT2.0 then use that.

@ Sunblock too true, so many hit n run and spoil it for others!"
,Gvarimoto,2012-02-18T14:47Z,"@boobsman can you put up a release site, and a donation link :)

I'd gladly donate !!"
,Gvarimoto,2012-02-18T14:52Z,"@boobsman can you put up a release site, and a donation link :)

I'd gladly donate !! !"
[V],boobsman,2012-02-18T16:40Z,"@ Gvarimoto thanks mate but i don't want your money, everyone needs to realise that giving you free games cost ME money for seedboxes etc... so when i get criticised for slow uploads it annoys me, this stuff is free n everyone needs to remember that!  "
,Gvarimoto,2012-02-18T16:51Z,"@boobsman i totally agree, im very thankfull for your job here, hope you keep it up :)

Always quality rips from you man!"
,mrnexus,2012-02-18T18:48Z,"ATM theres 180 seeders including me and 2691 peers,it took me 14 hrs to download at an average of between 500-850kbs thats slow i know compared to mu mums house were i can get 2-3mibs but sunblock and boobsman must be correct people with faster internet must have downloaded this in a few hours and then deleted it,how selfish can you be w are supposed to be a community so if you read this keep seeding once you have downloaded please lets help each other and set an example."
,azuziel,2012-02-18T20:08Z,"nice - this game rocked back in the Genesis days, nice to see it revived and reworked. "

Also I play offline with Ethernet unplugged.

Any ideas"
,mrnexus,2012-02-19T07:28Z,"At the moment there is 459 seeders and 1573 peers downloading
so my comment from last nite if you do the maths
thats roughly about 600 to 700 people who have hit and run form this torrent what selfish bastards you know who you are."
,mrnexus,2012-02-19T07:30Z,sorry to double post but it tells you in utorrent the exact figure plus trackers etc.
,tomboss82,2012-02-19T13:02Z,cose i have lt+2.0 and i need pre patched XGD3 games... so i have a question this is pre patched version or already ABGX'ed  ?
,tmgforever,2012-02-19T15:47Z,I confirm that it works on my LT2.0 with the patch. Many thanks to boobsman for sharing such an amazing game!!!
,rochet289,2012-02-19T19:53Z,Where do we get the patch
,rochet289,2012-02-19T20:02Z,Hey tmg do you have the link for the patch
,fanfasnight,2012-02-19T21:34Z,"well i tried 3 times with final fantasy patch no patch and something else:) . I havent tried the latest games like final fantasy or soul calibur or koa. Not sure what to do anymore . If anyone have any ideas it with help, if not ...well its not the end of the world"

[T],razalgul1979,2012-02-20T03:26Z,"Updated here for 14717 normal games are running normal, but when you enter or change the profile message is displayed:

XBOX Live
The console could not connect to XBOX Live. Do you want to log out and test the network connection? If you are playing you will lose any unsaved progress.

Is this normal? How to remove this message?"
,mrnexus,2012-02-20T10:03Z,"@slimwadeyi/Thanks for the info m8,i'am happy with what i have as it works u know whata mean but i am going to check this RGH thing out.
ps does it cost much money for hadrware as i have already bought from teamx the x360usb-pro,ck3i,and a probe for  getting the key out of a
 phat lteon,then i had to buy a 124-b Ihas  liteon for xgd3's etc,good luck pal,cheers :)"
,mrnexus,2012-02-20T10:07Z,"@Trusted razalgul1979/I just updated to new dash/147 did you revert to stock 1st then reflash etc after updating.thats what i did and am ok everythings fine,that does'nt sound normal."

Have searched a lot out there and can not find solution
Anyone got a light?"
,slimwadeyi,2012-02-20T13:57Z,"@mrnexus. If you were to buy the kit from CK it can cost around £40+ but you can get all the bits on ebay for about £15
I have an original Falcon Jtag and an RGH slim too. only did the slim to see if i actually could ! "
,tmgforever,2012-02-20T14:15Z,"I just followed this instruction :-

1.If you have LT 2.0,Apply these patch 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0
(For LT3.0 users, skip this step)

2.Open Imgburn (must be the latest version 2.5.6.0) and go to Tools>Settings>Write. Now select Calculate Optimal if you have the iHas burner and User Specified for those who doesnt have the iHas burner and will use the truncate method.If u select User Specified, write 2086912.
(If the game you have is XGD2, the layerbreak should be 1913760.)

3.Now close the settings and select write image file to disc

4.Load the your .dvd file 

5. Burn the game!

I have the dashboard 2.0.13604.0 and LT2.0. As long as you follow the instruction, the game should be working flawlessly.

,eternal666,2012-02-20T21:23Z,"@ct7 
looks like you burnt it wrong"
,mrnexus,2012-02-21T02:33Z,@Trusted razalgul1979 /have you found an answer yet?I don't really understand what u mean by ur 2nd reply can you explain more exactly what you have done what chipset u r using to flash and did u revert to stock before updating?
,mrnexus,2012-02-21T03:07Z,"For everyone on LT+3.0 and also for those using the Ihas liteon burner theres 6 different types i use the baseline model 124-b,anyway to burn and be safe on xbox-live you must take these steps 1st open up imgburn go to the bottom right hand corner and click on change advanced settings once it opens pick the liteon tab then 
1st enable force hyper tuning
2nd enable online hyper tuning
3rd enable overspeed
4th enable smartburn
5th clear OPC history(do this for everyburn)
Now onto the burn settings
As I am using Verbatim discs made in Singapore I burn them at 4x speed so I 'check' Perform OPC before write. I also make sure BURN-proof is NOT checked!TOO DO THIS in imgburn  click tools-settings-write,it will bring u to the page
NEXT I set my buffer size to 512mb,that can be found on page 2 of the I/O TAB
Then select your .dvd file to burn and thats it it should take about 25/30 mins to burn
Then when that is complete you have 1 more thing to do to check that you iso has been burned proper and that you can go online and be safe
close imgburn and open open KProbe 2 v2.5.2.
and set the read speed to 4x and begin the test
when the test is complete save your test results and the most important thing is,is the results you want ur test to be within these 
PI MAX should be 100 or less & PI Average should be 5 or less
PIF MAX should be 4 or less & PIF Average should be 0.20 or less
All thanks go to R3D over at iXtreme.net
And for those of you still using the truncate method please for your own sake buy a Ihas-liteon burner a baseline 1 costs Â£10/15 quid
remember when you truncate an iso ur only burning 97%of the data which will get you a flag then ban.

,Bacardi7,2012-02-21T04:13Z,"I am on LT+ 2.0 on two different 360s (a Hitachi & Benq). I have applied the FF patch, and burned the ISO with an iHas burner with Burner Max. I made three copies, all of which boot into the game, get past the menus and then freeze immediately upon starting to play it. If anyone has any ideas, I'd be grateful to hear them. Thanks, and thanks to Boobsman for the upload."

Note that I don't have an IHas burner, just a regular laptop DVD burner. 

Does anybody know what to do? I wanna make sure that I need the IHas burner 100% for burning before buying it (I read somewhere that this - with an IHas burner - is the only to burn XGD3 games for LT 3.0..). Obviously, Id like to continue burning with my current burner. "

im getting a bit sick of deleting the 400 other (ie.complex-hdff.360-rf-lookatme-imthegreatest-megatorrent-2012-retail)characters from the START of title of the .iso so i can find it in a folder...
not only does it shit me (and im sure others) but i cant rename it and keep seeding without having 2 copies on my computer, seems like theyre more concerned with a (little) bit of internet fame, than the continued availability of the torrent.
put ur name on the torrent and the zip even the folders but not the start of the .iso for gads sake.
ok whinge over thank you."
,SuperGeekNo1,2012-02-26T12:59Z,@Narsil360 did you flash your ihas burner and also configure it to the disc your are using i.e the default for ihas burner when flashed is mkm 001 which is for verbatim discs if your using cheaper ones you need to flash the drive to that disc type hope it helps  
,Smallz94,2012-02-26T14:34Z,@Narsil360 i used 2133520 this number for the layer break and the game worked.
