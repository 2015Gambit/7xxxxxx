Story about the youth of India today. A young 
London based film-maker plans to shoot a film 
on the Indian revolutionaries mentioned in her
fathers diaries. She comes down to Delhi, &  c
a group of five friends to play the pivotal ro
of these revolutionaries. However, products   
of modern India, initially refuse as they dont
identify with these characters from the past. 
To them issues like patriotism & giving one's 
life for one's beliefs  is the stuff stuffy   
text-books are made of . In the film both the 
1930's British India and the India Today run  
parallel and intersect with each other  at    
crucial points. As the film reaches its       
resolution the line between past & future     
blur's as they become one in spirit.
