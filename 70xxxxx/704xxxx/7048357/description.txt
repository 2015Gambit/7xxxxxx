
Plot:

From the creator of the hit series â€œBonesâ€ comes â€œThe Finderâ€, a quirky, one-hour procedural centering on a remarkable man with an eccentric personality and a unique gift to help others recover what theyâ€™ve lost. Iraq war veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) gained a reputation in his army days as being the go-to guy for tracking down insurgents and deserters and finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Unfortunately one IED found Walter before he could find it, resulting in severe brain damage with a lasting and unexpected effect. Walter transformed from someone skilled at the standard recovery of people and things in wartime scenarios to someone - something - much more extraordinary: a Finder. Walter left the military, but his reputation as a discreet professional able to unearth anything and anyone passed on to generals, politicians and other powerful figures.
