,vwjets,2012-06-02T22:03Z,"To answer my own question, it does have Disk Doctor!!  :)"
,skulldragon,2012-06-10T00:11Z,"This is NOT v15.0.0.124, it's 15.0.0.122.
Registration tool doesn't detect Norton Utilities.
Norton Utilities doesn't even work properly on my WinXp x86 SP3..."
,skulldragon,2012-06-10T00:15Z,I also had a lot of trouble getting rid of NU from my computer!
,pixie82,2012-09-13T12:08Z,"Your upload is littered with the Win32.Heur Trojan which is deadly lethal to someones pc if it gets loose. I dont know how you can say that you scanned it with Norton 360 and it came up clean cos this is one of the most well known viruses there is due to the damage it can do and how many people have been affected by it in the past. 

You need to be more careful mate about what your letting people download on to their pcs as people without any know how will think its a false positive. No wonder T.P.B. gets a bad name with these kind of things going round its site :("
