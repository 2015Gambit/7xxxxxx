Description Of This File:
The file is very usable to Norton users who can't activate their Norton Utilities 15.0.0.124 since this file contains the registration tool.
The Norton registration tool is scanned by Norton 360 v6.0 and it is virus free, you don't have to worry about having threats in your computer system. The Norton registration tool is compatible for x86 and x64 computers. 
Norton Utilities 15.0.0.124 is I think the latest software of the product, but the program will automatically install the latest updates so it can be up to date.
For Windows XP users, you are required to have Service Pack 2 or later to install Norton Utilities 15.0.0.124 and make sure you have the operating system of Windows XP Home/Professional/Media Center. Only compatible with x86 computers. (Not sure about x64 computers, so please test it out!)
This is a "ZIP" file, so you don't need WinRAR to extract it. Please comment on this file so I can know what's going on with it and please seed so other users can download this faster. Thanks!
