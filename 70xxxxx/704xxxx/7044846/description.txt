"At Long Last Leave"

The Simpsons are evicted from Springfield
and join an off-the-grid community outside
of town. But when Homer and Marge try to
sneak back into Springfield, they are
welcomed with hostility from their former
friends and neighbors and begin to
appreciate their new and more accepting
home
