If Robin Dies are 4 folk-punks from Wales. We like fucking up songs and generally twatting around with shitty old instruments and knackered amps. If you never saw us live then you'll have no idea how good we were. You'll just be stuck with some pretty nasty recordings like this one. Always free with a big fuck you to the MAAFIA and all the other fucks trying to screw every last drop of blood out of 'creativity'. Share freely and Enjoy. 

Demo II was our attempt to catpure some of the mayhem we make when we're playing live. It is subtitles Songs For Our Swedish Friends in honour of some coold guys on Soundclick we were going to do a CD swap with. Don't remember if we ever did get round to it though...
