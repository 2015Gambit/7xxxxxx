FAQs
Q. My game hang when I click on New Game, Options or Favorites in game menu.

A. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages and then try video fix \"Counter-Strike\\videofix\\video_fix.reg\". If it don\'t fix the problem then apply this patchthis will definitely solve the problem.



Q. When I create a listen server my game freezes during map change.

A. Solution#1 Use changelevel command to change the map e.g changelevel de_inferno Or quit the game and create New Game again.
Solution#2 go to \"Counter-Strike\" folder and open \"rev.ini\" file in notepad, comment \"ClientDLL=steam\\steamclient_orig.dll\" to \"#ClientDLL=steam\\steamclient_orig.dll\"
This is permanent solution but now no server will show in internet tab. This is a revEmu bug.



Q. I can\'t able to add server to favorites.

A. This will only occurs when you try to add old protocol 47 server. You can play on protocol 47 server. e.g Server IP : 172.16.100.100:27015 and password : 123. Open game console and use the following commands
password \"123\"
connect \"172.16.100.100:27015\"
