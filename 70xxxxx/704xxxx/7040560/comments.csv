,lordquad,2012-02-19T07:36Z,"This movie is such a masterpiece even though some kids don't understand it. Most of what Scorcese has done are really great masterpieces.

I just looked at the Box Office and it really hurts to see that a movie such as this one is outperformed by such a HUGE PILE OF CRAP such as ""Marley & Me""; that F*ing RETARD who made that movie should get shot for it!!!!!"
