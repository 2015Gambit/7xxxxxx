,spifkitten99,2012-02-21T14:44Z,"DVD my ass.

Probably a webrip or something.

This looks like something that was originally really low resolution and really low bitrate, and then just scaled up, and encoded really poorly at higher bitrate.

It's pixelated, blurry and full of artifacts.

It has blurred areas, so most likely it does have a watermark, but it was just blurred out. Therefore, the torrent name is fake.

The quality fits more with a file with a quarter of the size.

It's watchable, but that's it."

,dlarrym1111,2012-02-26T02:09Z,"Is there a copy of this screener where the ""watermark"" was left alone? That blurry strip across the bottom of the screen is MUCH MUCH worse and distracting then the watermark itself.

I haven't downloaded from  except for a few other times. Don't get me wrong, the effort is very much appreciated and beside the blur, it is really good quality and is watchable. just for the record and meaning of terms. This is labeled as NO WATERMARK. That isn't quite true. The water mark cannot be removed, so it is still there but is covered by that blurry strip.

It should read, water mark is hidden under a blurry, annoying strip that also blurs the part of visual information that would be visable behind the watermark (which is a few words explaining this is a screener and not for retail use). . . or something like that.

Even if it could be removed, that watermark proves it is a screener and comes from an actual DVD. A DVD that isn't intended for sale to the public, but a DVD non the less.

I'll hold out for another screener where the watermark hasn't been tampered with. A solid BLACK strip may as well be laid on top of this watermark because the blurry strip doesn't let one see what is behind it any more then a solid black strip would.

If another screener with the intact watermark doesn't appear, I guess I'll be waiting for an upload of a Blu-Ray rip where a watermark isn't an issue what so ever.
Always glad and grateful for ones efforts, I just rather hold off for now.

 You can't download because they seem to have switched to only magnet links.. for some stupid reason.

 They work differently..

 As it says directly below ""GET THIS TORRENT"" (that's what you have to click to DL) you probably just need to upgrade to a newer torrent program."

 Seems some of you saw ""DVD"" while missing the ""SCR"" and expected to much. 

 Looks good to me, a little bit of fuzz but not really noticeble sitting further away on a tv.

 If you expect more than this out of movies this recent, then you should probably just goto the theatres.

 I didn't notice the watermark either.
