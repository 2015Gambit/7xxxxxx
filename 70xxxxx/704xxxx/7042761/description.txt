Workdone:
Well getting pm's like crazy...some believe it and some dont, but yes we removed the watermark, but only 90% of it. Then we had a choice to blur it or not for the finishing touch. If we didnt litely blur the area you would be able to see the outline of the watermark, so we litely blur it. Last 2 screenshots will show examples. After that was all done, it was a pain to get this file saved in this new program and we had to read up on it. After that was done we insert it into vdub and did our usual, levels, brightness,contrast,and litely ran a smoother.

Audio: untouched
