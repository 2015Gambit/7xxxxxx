Death was an American metal band founded in 1983. The band\'s founder, Chuck Schuldiner, is considered \"a pioneering force in death metal and grindcore\".The band ceased to exist after Schuldiner died of brain cancer in 2001, though remains an enduring metal brand.

Death is considered one of the most influential bands in metal. The band\'s debut, Scream Bloody Gore, has been described as \"death metal\'s first archetypal document\" and \"the first true death metal record\". One music biographer has referred to Schuldiner as the \"Father of Death Metal\" while another has claimed that Schuldiner is \"readily acknowledged as the true founder of the U.S. death metal scene\".


Vivus! captures two stunning full concerts of the final lineup of metal pioneers Death in one deluxe double-cd package. Disc One features the band at the height of their prowess tearing the roof off of the infamous Whisky A Go Go in Los Angeles while Disc Two is a brilliant recording of the band on the festival stage at Dynamo Open Air. 

Stacked with brand new liner notes from Death drummer Richard Christy and the bands long-time manager Eric Greif as well as newly unearthed photos of the band, Vivus! is more than just an artifact from one of heavy-metals true legends, it is a pair of discs that sit confidently next to Deaths untouchable catalog of albums.
