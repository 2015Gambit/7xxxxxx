Techno Soft - Elemental Master Original Sound Version Collection
Vertiphon 2012 Remaster MP3s

This torrent contains the 24 tracks that comprise the soundtracks for the Sega Genesis game Elemental Master by Techno Soft.  Techno Soft released a variety of game soundtracks, some containing this music, but they\'re insanely hard to track down and very old now.

As with my Gunstar Heroes OSV remaster, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an \"album\" (watch out for the continuously segued \"boss medley\").  This is some of the very best music the Sega Genesis had to offer, and seeing as a few nabbed my Gunstar Heroes torrent I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, it\'s one of my favourite Sega Genesis soundtracks.

This collection of audio does NOT in any way duplicate the audio from Techno Soft\'s own 1991 Elemental Master CD release with the catalog number \"TSC-0004\".
