,oceansoflovewi,2012-02-21T06:51Z,You too? Wheres the quality description? Take down this garbage and give us some 320 kbps. Especially if its a special enhanced remix not off the original album i can get in 320.
[T],ThingsfromHeaven101,2012-02-21T15:30Z,"Why you're right oceansoflovewi, I was unable to find the remix at a higher quality in time to uplod it. But if you do, please feel free to upload it yourself and I will personally advertise it over mine, ok :)

Until then, be a bit more appreciative "
[T],stumpie1971,2012-03-06T22:57Z,"@ The Uploader, if you download a song in less Quality than 320kbps then change your setting in itunes to Convert MP3 To 320kbps and Create MP3 And there is your song done in 320kbps m8 :) its as simple as that....... And @ Ocean ? WTF With the attitude Dude your getting these songs for free and maybe if you upload any torrents you would understand that it uses up alot of time during the day !!! RESPECT THE UPLOADERS NOT HATE THEM ? Just Saying Like !!! Great Upload ThingsfromHeaven101"
