This is Robert Harris's and Jeremy Paxman's shocking book A Higher Form of Killing - The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare (1982) which opens with the first devastating battlefield use of lethal gas in World War I, and then investigates the stockpiling of biological weapons during World War II and in the decades afterward as well as the inhuman experiments conducted to test their effectiveness. It presents an astonishing account of the British-U.S. World War II development and production of anthrax bombs, at Churchill's insistence, for possible use against German population centers. Now eclipsed by nuclear weapons, germ weapons have been outlawed by the 1972 Biological Warfare Convention, and, even before that, in 1969, such biological and toxin weapons were unilaterally and unconditionally renounced by the United States. But poison gas weapons have not been outlawed. U.S.-Soviet negotiations to do so have been suspended by the US administration, partly because of serious but unproven doubts about Soviet compliance with existing constraints on biological and chemical weapons and warfare. At the same time, with essentially no Congressional or public analysis of the real military and political issues, the United States is embarking on a multi-billion-dollar program to produce a new generation of nerve gas artillery, shells, bombs, rockets, and missile warheads, generating much controversy among NATO allies. Against this background, the great value and importance of Paxman and Harris's book is as a reliable guide to the past history and possible future developments in this little-known and poorly understood but possibly momentous aspect of the arms race. A Higher Form of Killing is an important addition to the very small number of written accounts available to the public on the subject of chemical and biological warfare. 295 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.
