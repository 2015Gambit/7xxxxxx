I already told him the leak isn't available in such a high quality "
,Leonardo,2012-02-23T07:43Z,"@ThingsfromHeaven101 - That too..192kbps was what it was leaked/released at. A higher kbps will only appear once it released as single or in an album or something. But for 192kbps, the sound quality is SUPERB!!
ENJOY! :)"

I downloaded it in .flac and it seems to work but I don't know the quality is there. Sounded good to me though.

Just thought I'd share.

Cheers"
