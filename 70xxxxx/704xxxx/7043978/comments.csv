,Karlston,2012-02-20T00:37Z,Thanks. Looks a very nice game reminiscent of C & C 3 Tiberium Wars. Is the 1.01 patch available for download other than using that horrid Impulse crap?

As for the 1.01 update there seem to be non yet. Even with orginal purchase I would still perfer nodvd so to preserve original disk. Looks like it will be a wait. 
Official site suggest serveral bug fixes such as armor upgrade issue, resource net count issue etc. Rather vital detail hoping this patch can be provided soon.
Thanks and I will seed as much as possible."

,whiteorc,2012-03-10T08:53Z,"thank you for this, i can't wait for the 1.01 patch!"
,whiteorc,2012-04-04T17:44Z,emmmm i get an error when i try to run the unleashed app: job error!!
,whiteorc,2012-04-19T10:11Z,"Ok, i have it working. I dlded the archive from rlslog. Now the fun part begins. They released the 1.1 patch wich u can download but being a installer it needs the original game. I found a nice app called universal extractor. This baby extracted all files from the installer resulting in 2 folders. Grab the files from the first one (data and exe) and overwrite the ones from the game(unleashed version) and u have the game patched to 1.1. So far works fine, including the new mod tower defense."
