When Peter and the guys try to salvage a sunken Mercedes-Benz, Peter half-heartedly promises a favor to a helpful dolphin (guest voice Ricky Gervais). Soon the dolphin moves to Quahog, outstays his welcome at Peterâ€™s and moves into Clevelandâ€™s house across the street. Peter tries to reunite the dolphin with his ex-wife in hopes that heâ€™ll return to the ocean, but his plan backfires and the whole dolphin family moves into Clevelandâ€™s old house.
