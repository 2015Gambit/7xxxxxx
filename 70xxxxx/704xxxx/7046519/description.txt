Tired of playing gay games and seeing your kid being brainwashed watching Teletubbies, Power Ranges and playing Disney shit?

Want him to grow up like a man?

How to play Carmageddon with 3DFX enabled:

1- Install nGlide.
2- Run "Start menu -> All programs -> nGlide -> Configurator" and set resolution to native resolution of your monitor.
3- To start the game, run Carma\carma.bat

Notes:

1- The password for uncut version is: blood (the cut version replaces people with zombies).
2- Type the password slowly because some keys can be skipped when typing very fast.
3- Unlock-all cheat: at the start race screen type "KEVWOZEAR" (case-sensitive). If you entered the code correctly, you will hear a sound.
4- DOSbox emulates DOS environment, so the game may run slow (it ran fine in my i7-930 CPU + GT470 GPU). If this happens reduce screen resolution in nGlide Configurator.
