I have 20 of Erin's 21 sets -- I'll see about getting those reseeded but I can't reseed the whole thing."

so please Seeding!"
[V],bestec1234,2012-02-19T05:47Z,"FYI -- Try to put all of your reseed requests on a user's most recent torrents rather than spreading them out... it's easier to find.

Or come to the IRC channel, where this type of communication is WAY easier than trying to correspond by torrent comments."
