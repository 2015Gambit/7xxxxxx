,carson300,2012-04-12T05:54Z,"sorry, incredible hulk is loosley related to the avengers. the casting is different however so it becomes a bit dicey."
,dp_pirate,2012-04-24T15:01Z,"There is a 8 issue comic book series called ""Marvel's Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week"" which ties all the movies together from Nick Fury's point of view leading up to the Avengers.  Based on that the Incredible Hulk is not loosely related, it is tightly integrated."
