NOTES:

Sources:
OK thanks to lum1x for sending us the better sors files....this time round no encode from a small 352 x res file...
The source was nice but alot of cam movement and was also 30+ secs longer than the other releases....
Audio was sics audio which was nice,had some noise and a tad over powering.

Workdone:
First had to cut the sors file into 7 parts due to major cam movement...then had to cut 16.6 secs off the intro to line up 
with sics encode so i could sync it easier.
The video i had to use a quad filter to level up the best i could and then crop and resize,aswell as changing all the colours,chroma
brightness and contrast levels....must also point out the AR changes through only slightly except 2mins about 10mins onto the film...
this is because of the different cropping i had to do and only way to append them is to make them all the same res.
Audio i was hoping would overlay straight over....but nope i had to make 10 cuts to resync it...due to extra video,some oos and some repeat
audio on sics release.
Did the best i could and on some parts there was no audio,but i mean less than a sec on most and one part was 2 secs ...also tried to fix the
repeated audio but yet again not always possible without the full line.
Check around 45.58 roughly too see what i mean .
