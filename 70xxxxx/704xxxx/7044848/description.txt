Bruce Springsteen Live In Dublin(mp3 320kbs)ICM369


2006, saw the release of \"We Shall Overcome - The Seeger Sessions\", 
paying tribute to the American folk music of Pete Seeger, which 
brought The Boss back in the spotlights in an entirely different way. 

This CD, \"Live In Dublin\", is the logical - and sublime - successor to 
\"We Shall Overcome\". 

It is incredible to hear how this music matured further and enhanced in 
richness in just a few months of touring.
 
While the merriment of Springsteen and his Seeger Sessions Band when per-
-forming these songs in LSO St Lukes in London in May 2006 (broadcast by 
the BBC) was already striking, \"Live In Dublin\" is a breathtaking and 
stomping set recorded in November 2006 with flailing fiddles, banjo, 
harmonica, & a stomping dixieland-like horn section that brings the house 
down in \"How Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times And Live\", \"Jacob\'s Ladder\", 
and \"Pay Me The Money Down\". 

It is more than obvious that Springsteen\'s ensemble are enjoying themselves 
immensely, their performance radiates sheer joy and passion throughout the 
concert, and they play with an extraordinary power that is both amazing and 
exhilarating. 

The material varies wildly in origin, from the sea shanty \"Pay Me My Money 
Down\" to the Negro spiritual \"O Mary Don\'t You Weep\" & the 19th century Irish 
anti-war ballad \"Mrs McGrath\". 

Erie Canal is a rollicking tune, & \"Eye On The Prize\" & \"Further On Up The 
Road\" are eerie and haunting. 

This album is a milestone in The Boss\' career, a must have for any music fan, 
and the best (live) album I\'ve heard over the last couple of years. 

So get it, open the bourbon, crank up the volume and enjoy.
