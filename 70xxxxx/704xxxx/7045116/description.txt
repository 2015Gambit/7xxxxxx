Throws light on tinsel town

Rarely are made movies that take an inside look on the film industry itself. Director Rajkrishna has gathered guts in his first film to narrate the troubles a girl would face if she wants to become an actress in Kollywood. It is a series of events that occurs in the life of an actress, who is seen as an object of lust by fans. There is also life and feelings for her. This is what the filmmaker has tried to convey through the movie. Sonia Agarwal makes a comeback to play the
lead role. She does with consummate ease.
