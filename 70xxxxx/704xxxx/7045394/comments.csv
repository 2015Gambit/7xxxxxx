Don't worry, guys.  Ep. 19 coming up in a minute.

As I've mentioned before, I don't encode these videos -- ""ZR"" does, who posts them to Uploading.to (or whatever upload site).  And then I make a torrent out of that file.

But I'm looking to change that.  I'm tinkering around with encoding stuff myself -- I just finished one of ""Luna Eclipsed"", actually.  If all goes well, I will only have to wait for iTunes, not both it and ZR."
