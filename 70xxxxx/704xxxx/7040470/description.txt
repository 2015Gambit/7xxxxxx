Wildside - Speed Japan


Lyrics:

KCP, Tommy B with MOMO mix, move your feet
This is the speed sound of Japan

Close your eyes, take your time and clap your hands
All the night
This is the boom boom speed Japan

Rock and rollin till the end
You will feel so fine
Everything alright

Boom boom speed Japan
Sing and shout the way you are
Every single minute aih aih ahhh
Listen to the speed Japan

Boom boom speed Japan
This is all the way you are
Everybody love it aih aih ahhh
Move your body, speed Japan
