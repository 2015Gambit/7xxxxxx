TRIVIA FROM IMDB

This is the seventh time that father-son Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez have worked together.

In an LA radio interview on "The Busted Halo Show with Father Dave", Emilio Estevez revealed that much of the inspiration he got for this film was the identical pilgrimage that his father Martin Sheen and his son Taylor Estevez made a few years before on the Camino de Santiego de Compostela in Spain. Estevez' son, then 19, fell in love, moved to Spain, and got married a few years later. Since that trip, Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez spoke often of how they could make a film about the pilgrimage until an idea surfaced. 

Filmed with a small crew of fifty people and a couple of cameras for filming. No trailers were used, and, as Estevez jokingly remarked, neither was a director's chair. 

Tom (Martin Sheen) places bits of his son's ashes at various places on El Camino to signify that his son is making the journey with him. Though touching, this goes against Catholic teaching - cremation is allowed, but all of a person's ashes are to be kept together, in one place. Scattering or dividing the ashes is officially not allowed. 

Production of the film took 40 days, and Emilio Estevez's son, who served as an associate producer on the film, met his wife-to-be on the Camino.

PLOT: "The Way" is a powerful and inspirational story about family, friends, and the challenges we face while navigating this ever-changing and complicated world. Martin Sheen plays Tom, an American doctor who comes to St. Jean Pied de Port, France to collect the remains of his adult son (played by Emilio Estevez), killed in the Pyrenees in a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago, also known as The Way of Saint James. Rather than return home, Tom decides to embark on the historical pilgrimage to honor his son's desire to finish the journey. What Tom doesn't plan on is the profound impact the journey will have on him and his "California Bubble Life". Inexperienced as a trekker, Tom soon discovers that he will not be alone on this journey. On his journey, Tom meets other pilgrims from around the world, each with their own issues and looking for greater meaning in their lives: a Dutchman (Yorick van Wageningen)...
