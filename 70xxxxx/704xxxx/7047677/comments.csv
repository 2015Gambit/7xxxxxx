,k0ticgood,2012-03-11T11:22Z,"Just wanted to give a big thank you. I've only had the hardware to watch 1080p for a few months now (could only handle 720p before), and this is the best quality rip I've ever seen. Really appreciate the upload. The movie was surprisingly good as well, I was expecting a pretty bad but entertaining movie; it was definitely entertaining, and it actually wasn't that bad.

Contrast to the last movie I watched, ""In Time"" which I had similar expectations going into, which was one of the worst movies I've seen lol."
