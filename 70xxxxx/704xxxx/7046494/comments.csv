,jamz3243,2012-03-01T17:12Z,"@matty95 I was going to ask if you know of a linux client but I found out you made this in vb.net(so I should be able to just emulate this in wine), can I ask what version of .net you used to make this?"
,snakeroom,2012-03-01T18:54Z,"Nice job Matty!...2 things I would of did different, 
1. you should convert the size in the datagrid into something a little more readable(Mb or Kb maybe).
2. I think you can use parallelism to feed that grid(it would significantly reduce the time it takes to load(at least for me w/6 core)) don't quote me on that though it's worth looking into. Still thank you very much.
p.s. this is a clean program :)   "
