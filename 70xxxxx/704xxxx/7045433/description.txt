Classic Albums
A series celebrating the classic albums that many of us have tucked away on vinyl at the back of a wardrobe. We say get them out, dust them off and give them a spin! 
This series will remind you why you really, really should. Like cornflakes, you may have forgotten how good they are...
Frank Zappa - Over-nite Sensation and Apostrophe (!)
Frank Zappa is an American composer and musician of such breadth and prolific output - 60 albums - that fans differ constantly about the contenders for his Classic Album. What is agreed is that over 30 years of work, Zappa's records embraced Rock, Jazz, Funk, Blues, Doo Wop, and Classical influences and lyrically most were tinged with sufficient degrees of humour, satire and wry political observation and exuded excellent musicianship and faultless production. The two albums which encapsulate this cornucopia of musicality perfectly are Over-nite Sensation (1973) and Apostrophe(!) (1974).
