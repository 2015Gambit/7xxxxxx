In this documentary we look back over Whitney Houston's life and career â€“ her rise to fame and 
spectacular fall from grace, her history of drug abuse and her ill-fated marriage to Bobby Brown. 
Along with archive footage illustrating some of the key moments in her rollercoaster career 
there'll be contributions from those who were close to her and witnessed her often erratic 
behaviour first-hand.
