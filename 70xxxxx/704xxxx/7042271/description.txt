Baneling Starcraft 2 (original and smooth model for 3D printing)

OBJ - original 
STL - smoothed
---

I\\\\\\\'ve managed to find the process of ripping the ingame 3D models from
starcraft 2 and diablo series into a printable format.

I am currently in the process of seeding...this is my first ever torrent :D.

I don\\\\\\\'t have much upload bandwidth sooo..

I can supply any model/asset from the game (including buildings).

Any questions or requests - email me at rencio7 (at gmail.com)
