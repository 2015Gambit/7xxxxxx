,Krood0824,2012-03-19T05:28Z,"I was using version 1.9.3, did a clean uninstall and removal of all previous program files and installed version 1.9.7, but for some reason 1.9.7 does not work if trying to use with XBox.  I had to reinstall 1.9.3 and it again works just fine with Xbox.  I'm using Windows 7 btw."

For the cute GUI? 
Well thanks but I'll go with something that actually works."
