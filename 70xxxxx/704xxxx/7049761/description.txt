Steely Dan is an American rock band; its core members are Donald Fagen and Walter Becker.The bands popularity 
peaked in the late 1970s, with the release of seven albums blending elements of jazz, rock, funk, R&B, and pop. 
Rolling Stone has called them "the perfect musical antiheroes for the Seventies."

The band's music is characterized by complex jazz-influenced structures and harmonies played by Becker and Fagen 
along with a revolving cast of rock and pop studio musicians. Steely Dan's "cerebral, wry and eccentric" lyrics, 
often filled with sharp sarcasm, touch upon such themes as drugs, love affairs, and crime. The pair is well-known 
for their near-obsessive perfectionism in the recording studio, with one notable example being that Becker and 
Fagen used at least 42 different studio musicians, 11 engineers, and took over a year to record the tracks that 
resulted in 1980's Gaucho â€” an album that contains only seven songs.

Steely Dan toured from 1972 to 1974, but in 1975 became a purely studio-based act. The late 1970s saw the group 
release a series of moderately successful singles and albums. They disbanded in 1981, and throughout most of the 
next decade, Fagen and Becker remained largely inactive in the music world. During this time, the group steadily 
built and maintained "a cult following." In 1993, the group resumed playing live concerts; later Steely Dan 
released two albums of new material, the first of which earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. They have 
sold more than 30 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001

Gaucho is the seventh studio album by the American Jazz rock band Steely Dan, released in 1980. The sessions for 
Gaucho represented the peak of Steely Dan's recording studio perfectionism and obsessive recording techniques. 
To record the album, the band used at least 42 different musicians, spent over a year in the studio, and far 
exceeded the original monetary advance given to the band by their record label.

During the two-year span in which the album was recorded, the band was plagued by a number of creative, personal 
and professional problems. MCA, Warner Bros. and Steely Dan had a three-way legal battle over the rights to release 
the album. After the record was released, jazz musician Keith Jarrett successfully sued the band for writing credit 
on the song "Gaucho".

Gaucho marked a significant stylistic change for Steely Dan, introducing a more minimal, groove- and atmosphere
based format. The harmonically complex chord changes that were a distinctive mark of earlier Steely Dan songs are 
less prominent on Gaucho, with the record's songs tending to revolve around a certain rhythm or mood. Gaucho proved 
to be Steely Dan's final studio album before a 12-year hiatus.
