Traffic is the second album by the English rock band Traffic, released in 1968 on Island Records in the 
United Kingdom, and United Artists in the United States, catalogue UAS 6676. It peaked at number 9 in 
the UK albums chart and at number 17 on the Billboard 200.

In January 1968, after some initial success in Britain with their debut album Mr. Fantasy, Dave Mason had 
departed from the group. He produced the debut album by the group Family, containing in its ranks future 
Traffic bass player Ric Grech, while Traffic went on the road. In May, the band had invited Mason back to 
begin recording the new album.

Mason ended up writing and singing half of the songs on the album 
(including his biggest hit "Feelin' Alright") but making scant contribution to the songs written by Jim 
Capaldi and Steve Winwood. His flair for pop melody had always been at odds with the others' jazz ambitions
evidenced by the dichotomy seen for the songs on this album, and by October he was again out of the band. 
He would return one more time for a tour and album in 1971 to run out the band's contract.
