Biology: Life on Earth [9th Edition] Chapters 1-17

There are a total of 30 chapters, I will be scanning more as I progress through the book. The book is pretty thick so it will be awhile for me to scan the whole thing.

Scans are 300dpi and in color. PDF format. Only the chapters have been scanned, not any pre-text garbage or table of contents, etc. It's hard scanning such a thick book once you get into the middle of it because the spine only bends so far so some words are in the "gutter" of the book, it is still very readable though.

Please seed.	

EDIT: I know I already uploaded some of these chapters (ch 1 - 13) but they were all in separate torrents so this is just a new one that combines all the previous ones with some added chapters to make it easier for me and everyone else.

Eventually when all the chapters are scanned I will put them all into one full book/torrent for easy download.
