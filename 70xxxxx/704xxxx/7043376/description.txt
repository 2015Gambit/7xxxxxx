Here is a complete rip of the DVD for Season 3 of Mister Ed. All files are in MKV format and include English subtitles.

These are different file sizes because they were encoded for quality not bitrate. Grainier episodes tend to have higher file sizes.

I forgot to include the Studebaker commercials that were in season 2 so I am including them in this torrent.
