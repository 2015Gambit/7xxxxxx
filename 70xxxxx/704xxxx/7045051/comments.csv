,Laker32,2012-03-09T01:27Z,Folks...this has to be episode 7 because I downloaded it and saw the preview of two of the ladies arguing in a restaurant that I have NOT seen yet (It was not in ep 5)....So TV Team....you guys are GREAT....can you please hook us up with EP 6 and so on?  Much gratitude for your efforts!!!
,Laker32,2012-03-09T01:30Z,This has to be episode 7 because I viewed highlights from the beginning of the download and it showed a scene I did not see in previous ep 5....so hopefully TvTeam can hook us up with ep 6 soon.  Thanks Tv Team for all the great uploads!!!
