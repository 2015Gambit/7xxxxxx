Sorry, but I just saw a lot of questions pop up in Google about how the pirate bay has to change.
I have no idea how it is going to work and whether it affects me or not.
I somehow suspect we will all be affected, but I'm not sure how, or what to do about it."

Maybe there could be a chance with a model like VideoPimp has: a number of operators who ""release"" the stuff, no CDs, no DVDs, no BlueRays. Maybe you could add your great project there ... and some more people. But VideoPimp has enough problems on their own project and the servers costs. Get in contact with one of their operators to check ...
Hope your project will last 4 ever - I learned so much about ""my"" music from this ... and sometimes bought a CD or DVD based on it. love & peace from Beaujoulais"

What can I say?
It seems like there is bad news everywhere.
We must learn to accept and live with it
I hope we will preserve ""our place under the sun"" here on Pirate bay and realize our dreams."
