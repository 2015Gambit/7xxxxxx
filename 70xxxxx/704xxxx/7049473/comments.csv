,Meat69,2012-08-07T01:03Z,@realawesomedude lol the moral of the story is to retire with dignity or commit suicide. Maybe she knew she was gonna be a dead living legend oppose to a living legend. And no love for the Whitney comment. I'm forever a lover of Mrs. Houston. Every diva has their day..... Love Marilyn..
