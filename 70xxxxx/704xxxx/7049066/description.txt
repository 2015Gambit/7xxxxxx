The British attained the greatest standards of articulation for
what has been the human experience throughout our history.

While the Greeks and even the French have contributed to our fundamental
philosophical teachings as have the Romans including the inclusion of legal
principles through the use of Latin, it is the German crop of what is British
that gave us the English language that involved the engagement of the Irish
spirit as a pre-requisite to its proper use in respect of Christianly engagement
in fact. We otherwise have only a superficial benefit from its use and even a
detraction from or negation of what is its true intent.

I hope that Europe will adopt the right use of the English language as the
standard - after it has found a way to retain its spirit where it is best found
to still exist - (in Germany Sweden Holland etc) as this movie tells us that
The British paid too high a price to attain what is their expertise on the
relative quickness of the uptake as it were.

Yet for me personally, none will ever be as much of who I am or my real true
family- other than what is to come perhaps that tries to be as good in this regard

If you don't require subtitles to view this movie, please turn them off using
