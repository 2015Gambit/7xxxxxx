Sega - Sonic The Hedgehog 2 1992 Original Sound Version Collection
Vertiphon 2012 Remaster MP3s

This torrent contains 35 tracks, 31 comprising the soundtrack for the Sega Genesis / Megadrive game Sonic The Hedgehog 2 by Sonic Team / Sega, as well as four "bonus" tracks from the Sonic 2 Beta.  These were deemed different enough, and interesting enough, to warrant inclusion and make this a semi "archival" issue as well.

As with my Gunstar Heroes OSV remaster, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an "album".

This collection of audio does NOT in any way duplicate audio from any other Sonic The Hedgehog 2 music CD.
