I'll be uploading the Escape From New York commentary from the special edition DVD later this week.  I synced it to the Blu-ray release so now the Carpenter Russell trifecta of The Thing, EFNY and Big Trouble in Little China can all be enjoyed in HD with commentary.

Those guys are great together and REALLY need to make another film."
