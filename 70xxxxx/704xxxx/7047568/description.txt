Marvin Bookman is a small shop owner in Gary, Indiana,
USA. After he sees a drive-by shooting of Laurie
Thompson's son by a local gang, he gives up the license
number of the car to the police. The gang doesn't like
this so they go to the store and rough him up. Soon,
John Bookman comes to town to set the wrong things right.
With the help of Laurie and his old friend Jake, they
attempt to take back the streets and show the new breed
of gang members what the true originals can do.
