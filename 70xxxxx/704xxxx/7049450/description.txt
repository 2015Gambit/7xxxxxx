This is our final xvid release. There is simply no valid reason to use the codec
anymore. Compatibility for 264 is currently more widespread than xvid/divx
was when vcd died. The quality of the resulting encodes is leaps and bounds
beyond what xvid is capable of. Of course there will be dinosaurs still trying
to rationalize the usage of an outdated format, and continuing to drag the scene
further and further down the evolutionary ladder. The scene used to lead, and
thanks to such individuals, it simply does not anymore. Time to step up and
begin repairing all the damage that has been done. As some friends like to
say, time to evolve, or time to die
