To keep the disk small (I guess 6.65GB  is small), we aren't going to include what is less then 500mb, and most likely needed to run the game.

thanks for saving us that disk space, now we can make this fit on 1 DVD.

If you're too idiotic to be able to update your own DirectX and framework, what are you doing downloading cracked games to begin with?

Thanks BONE, another great release."

,draken.456,2012-03-20T22:14Z,"Having same problem as ProjectYoyo, that with the 'console' sign on the left. Any suggestions? Thx."
,h709055,2012-08-01T14:05Z,"Don't download this, it's a bad copy. It doesn't work on 64-bit processors. You can't run it, you can't patch it.
It's better to download ""Hellgate London [PCDVD][MULTi5][DVD9] By josvila"" (6.87 GB) + single player patch 1.2 (187 MB) + Revival mod 1.2.1 (7 MB).
Have fun."
