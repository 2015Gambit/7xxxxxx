A second-rate cage fighter on the mixed martial arts circuit, Luke Wright blows a rigged fight and the Russian Mafia murders his family and banishes him from his life forever. When he witnesses a frightened twelve-year-old Chinese girl, Mei, being pursued by the same gangsters who killed his wife, Luke impulsively jumps to action...and straight into the heart of a deadly high-stakes war. Mei, he discovers, is no ordinary girl, but an orphaned math prodigy forced to work for the Triads as a "counter." Luke tears a swath through the city's brutal underworld to save an innocent girl's life...and perhaps even redeem his own. Lionsgate and IM Global present in association with Automatik a Lawrence Bender production in association with Trigger Street Productions and 87Eleven, Inc.
