[V],thetorrentlord,2012-02-18T21:11Z,"Thanks for another fine upload! Nice to not have to make hundreds or even thousands waste time un-raring 

files when the seeder (Un-named groups) could save us all a lot of time. Many thanks to all the uploaders 

who no longer use RAR files."

@thetorrentlord

Is ""unRaRing"" really this long?!

Plus this often makes the download time shorter and is more economic on the internet usage...

Fix your computer, it is too slow!"
