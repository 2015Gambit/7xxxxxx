Hi there

Finaly after a long run vlc has reached the very latest official Final version of
vlc media player 2.0.0 :)
I'v just renamed the title to avoid certain possible confusion.
But don't worry,this is the true official final version anyway.
Win32 exe edition but should work as well on Win64 version anyway.


VLC reaches 2.0

VLC 2.0 "Twoflower" is a major new version of our popular media player.




With faster decoding on multi-core, GPU, and mobile hardware and the ability to open more formats, notably professional, HD and 10bits codecs, 2.0 is a major upgrade for VLC. 

Twoflower has a new rendering pipeline for video, with higher quality subtitles, and new video filters to enhance your videos.

It supports many new devices and BluRay Discs (experimental). 

Completely reworked Mac and Web interfaces and improvements in the other interfaces make VLC easier than ever to use.

Twoflower fixes several hundreds of bugs, in more than 7000 commits from 160 volunteers.
