I left this unattended when my driver was out of contention so the run time is slightly longer then the race and captured the local news. And re-encoding was not an option. FINALLY the season has kicked off and pack racing does seem to have found a way back!  Please help seed afterwards and be sure to check out my other NASCAR torrent. Enjoy Racefans!
