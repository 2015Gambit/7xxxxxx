,Hard2Find2,2012-02-20T01:14Z,"Lap 82 -- CHECKERED FLAG: Kyle Busch pushes Tony Stewart into the lead. Busch edges to the outside coming to the stripe and scores the win by inches.

Lap 81 -- GREEN FLAG: Tony Stewart, Marcos Ambrose, Clint Bowyer, Brad Keselowski are the front four. Ambrose is pushed into the lead by Keselowski. Ryan Newman goes to third.

Lap 77 -- Obviously, this race will end in a green-white-checkered flag finish ... at least one. 

Lap 75 -- Jimmie Johnson, in the garage, wants to go back in the race because so few cars are left in decent condition. There's the pace car and ... and ... well ... that's about it, right?

Lap 74 -- YELLOW FLAG NO. 5: There's a huge wreck. Jeff Gordon is upside down, flipping. He has told his crew he is OK, and is asking for the car to be rolled over before he gets out. Jimmie Johnson, Kurt Busch and Jamie McMurray are also involved. The race was triggered when Kyle Busch got out of shape off Gordon's front bumper. 

Lap 73 -- Tony Stewart slides down in front of Kyle Busch for the lead. 

Lap 72 -- Kyle Busch tries to block Jeff Gordon on the backstretch. All bets are off.

Lap 71 -- Kyle Busch has pulled alongside Jeff Gordon for the lead, with Greg Biffle still trailing him. Busch leaves Biffle outside coming off Turn 4.

Lap 70 -- Here comes Kyle Busch to the outside, leading Greg Biffle. Charge!

Lap 69 -- The leaders still aren't going to the whip, although they are closing on each other. 

Lap 68 -- Kyle Busch joins the lead pack. 

Lap 66 -- Denny Hamlin, running seventh, has received the free pass twice tonight. 

Lap 65 -- Ten to go. It's calm for the time being, but that will not last. 

Lap 64 -- Kurt Busch, Marcos Ambrose and Denny Hamlin have caught the front four.

Lap 62 -- Jeff Gordon Jimmie Johnson, Tony Stewart and Jamie McMurray are single file up front. The same cannot be said further back.

Lap 61 -- GREEN FLAG: Greg Biffle and Jeff Gordon stayed on the track, and they're the leaders. Jimmie Johnson, Tony Stewart and Jamie McMurray round out the top five. Gordon motors into the lead, with Johnson in second.

Lap 57 -- Most of the leaders are on pit road.

Lap 55 -- Joey Logano is pulling into the garage, and so is Kevin Harvick. 

Lap 54 -- YELLOW FLAG NO. 4: Dale Earnhardt Jr., Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick, Joey Logano, Matt Kenseth and others are involved in another multicar mishap. Harvick's car has a fairly substantial fire underneath as he drives away from the accident site. The accident was triggered when Logano was nudged from behind by Marcos Ambrose.

Lap 51 -- So long, Mr. Gordon. Kevin Harvick pushes Jamie McMurray to the lead, but then Greg Biffle leads Jimmie Johnson past them.

Lap 50 -- Twenty-five laps to go. Jeff Gordon is still the leader. The field has broken up into three distinct packs.

Lap 49 -- Jamie McMurray, while everybody else is still scratching their heads over the Kyle Busch save, takes the lead for a moment. Jeff Gordon crosses the line in first, however.

Lap 48 -- Kyle Busch, love him or hate him, makes an incredible save. He does everything BUT wreck, and keeps going with some damage to the nose of his car.

Lap 47 -- Kevin Harvick is the leader, and it's pick 'em for second place.

Lap 44 -- Move Jimmie Johnson to the advantage ... or then again, it's Kevin Harvick. Take your pick.

Lap 43 -- Jimmie Johnson and Kevin Harvick are trying to work their way to the front.

Lap 42 -- Martin Truex Jr. comes out on top of a scramble up front, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. giving him a push.

Lap 40 -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. dives under Jamie McMurray for the lead going into Turn 3, and he's awful close to the double yellow line. The move doesn't work. 

Lap 38 -- Not so fast there, Juan. Dale Earnhardt Jr. isn't going down without a fight. Jamie McMurray roars into the lead, and Juan Montoya roars to the back of the pack.

Lap 36 -- GREEN FLAG: Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Greg Biffle lead the field to the restart. Juan Montoya and Jamie McMurray weave their way past Earnhardt for the lead .."
