,pirateradiorocks2,2012-02-23T02:48Z,"Thanks, yet again for another outstanding upload.  Preppers, should indeed take a note from what happened in NZ and take steps to secure water, food and weapons.  Waterproof containers are just common sense.  If you are Prepper, take your time, think it through, quality over quantity.    

Oh, just a thought if you have a diesel vehicle that you plan on using-you might wanna look into 'mechanical' pumps for your vehicles and bulk veg oil.  For bulk oil shipments, you can get 20 metric tons, or 44,000 pounds, from China for something like $2500 dollars. You would need to have a cooperative for this, be near a port, and to find out more, go to  http://www.alibaba.com/ for the sources.
