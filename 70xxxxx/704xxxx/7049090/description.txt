Does anyone know the artist and the name of this reggae tune. I think its a 7 inch vinyl rip. Its probably not rare or obscure but after weeks of searching I can't find out who it is. It might be a YouTube rip though it sounds above their minimum audio bitrate. The vocalist name checks himself and I originally thought it was Papa San but I'm not too sure.

If you know then please leave a comment.

cheers for all your help in advance.
