Blind faith ?"
,N3rass,2012-02-24T08:58Z,"If you update your dll files and host file, you can install the full version with one of the serials, make sure you follow the instruction. "
,jlh1976,2012-03-01T04:05Z,"I downloaded, installed, use one of the serial numbers, replaced the .dll file, and so far it seems to be working fine.

My anti-virus keeps detecting one of the .dll files as a possible problem, but it seems the norm with cracked software, so it's a false positive."
,N3rass,2012-03-01T12:40Z,"You are welcome guys, glad it was worked for you

I can't guarantee the serials will work cause so many people have access to them but it's worth a try and if they don't work, you can find hundreds of serials online these days ;)"
,jlh1976,2012-03-03T10:55Z,"UPDATE:

It installed fine under XP OS.

Now that I'm trying Windows 7 I installed from a USB device and it required the disc.  I then dragged it to the Hard Drive and it's installing.

I'm not 100% sure, but on the USB device I set the English to North America - no go, needed disc.  Installing from the hard drive with international language it didn't ask for the disc.

I would definitely install from the hard drive.  Maybe this is well known, but just putting it out there."
,slickkkyboy,2012-03-04T03:34Z,install works perfectly and so do the serialz...follow the directions...i turned off my antivirus and turned on proxy and added the local addresses as exceptions....works flawlessly.

,kevsternajari,2012-03-06T18:38Z,So i changed the dl file to the 64 bit based on my computer specs but it still tells me that my activation key is invalid even tho i used a valid one from uptop how do i fix this issue ?
,kevsternajari,2012-03-06T18:45Z,"i changed the dl file and pasted the new one but it still say's i need an activation key although ive already used a working one everytime i open my PS program file , is there a way to fix this ? "
,Kamidora,2012-03-07T16:52Z,"I just hate adobe and their arrogance. Their system requirement, means I have to buy a PC that runs on Intel etc. before any CS85 could install. "
,urbancompanions,2012-03-11T03:41Z,"So I downloaded it, changed the host file, followed all instructions, installed it and everything installed fine... BUT the program won't run. It crashes before start up saying that the program ""has stopped working"" What's going on?"
,Close2Beer,2012-03-16T15:39Z,"consider my a dummy at this...

Good job."
,gayleau,2012-03-20T05:31Z,You are a wizard. I downloaded the trial version because it is faster. I used the very first serial you have listed here and everything is working great. Thank you.
,sonofrebus,2012-03-20T16:51Z,"Geezer please help a dude who is not a computer programmer, no problem with the host business but after that nada. the dll thing is a bit more complex than copying and pasting. really appreciate the upload but i am scoobied as how to install it, I thought stting up daemon was a piece of piss compared to this. help a man out please"
,cristyrawks,2012-03-27T06:25Z,I just keep getting that my trial has expired. I have entered serial number after serial number. I have deleted and reloaded the program and yet I still can't get it to work. Help!

,eagleflyy1,2012-05-10T04:06Z,found a place smartHlolH.com/share.php delete the capital H's in the link for it to work. would defiantly recommend 
,willchocks,2012-07-08T03:23Z,"Uhh, wtf mate. i downloaded it, installed, everything seemed to be working fine. Then i realised it wasn't the extended edition. Fuck i'm pissed off right now. I used the third serial key, does it matter which one i use? Will that effect whether the program is 'extended' edition or not? other than that. Good torrent man."
,Jj[x],2012-08-24T03:19Z,Its not Working for me Its says Invalid Serial
