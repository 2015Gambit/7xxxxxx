,cantbereached,2012-03-12T16:57Z,How to play online with this one ? All I found on internet is for SKIDROW and this release obviously works differently. So any ideas ? I've tried steam but no...
,diamond-optic,2012-03-13T19:57Z,"this works.. sorta

only problem is the game is basically shit.. crashes whenever I try to load a save game.. and that doesnt seem to be an issue caused by this release as google shows a ridiculous amount of people (who bought the legit game) have the exact same issue...

glad i didnt buy a game where you have to sit there all day (or more then 1 day straight) and play from start to finish otherwise youve wasted your time

save games with only a few turns seem to load, but any of my save games that have like 100+ turns make the game crash

what a programming fail it is to make a long game not have working saves"

,OmgItsAlex,2012-03-20T11:33Z,"Works fine for me, but I was wondering if anyone has got this working online yet?

,MeSaber,2012-03-23T07:54Z,if its an ISO u can extract it to folder with winrar and install from that folder.. no need for mounting.

now I need help, did a sys restore as I couldnt uninstall skidrows version, which I actually got to work as it included the direct x files I needed, but yeah anyways, anyone know which directx update to get that includes d3dx9_42.dll? & no I dont want to dl that file seperately as its not a good idea according to most experts, for many reasons 2 apparently. thanks."
,pbird21,2012-05-14T19:55Z,"@codieLM and others who are having problems with a black screen on startup.

I had the same problem and it just would not load past the black screen no matter how long you waited. So to fix this issue, you need change the setting to automatically skip the intro video on startup. Just follow these steps after installation and after launching the game at least one time:

1.Go to the following directory: ""My DocumentsMy Games Sid Meierâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Civilization 5""
2.Find a file called ""UserSettings.ini"" and open it with notepad.
3.Find the line of text called ""SkipIntroVideo="" and change the value from 0 to 1 and save the file. It should be near the bottom of the list, or you can just press ctrl + f and search for it that way.

Note: Although this skips the intro video, you will still see a black screen for a bit when you launch the game, because it is loading. Usually the game loads while the cinematic is playing, that is why you can't skip it right away.)

This solved the problem for me! I can run the game now with no problems in both Directx 9 and 11. "
,pbird21,2012-05-14T20:03Z,"@LordOfKobol and others who are getting the d3dx9_42.dll missing error.

I also had this problem before running into the black screen issue. To fix the d3dx9_42.dll error, I did the following:

1. Go to: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/search.aspx?q=directx

2. Click the link in the search results named DirectX End-User Runtime Update.

Note: Typically, the DirectX End-User Runtime Update link will be your best option since it's the latest release and only installs the DirectX files you are missing.

This solved the missing d3dx9_42.dll error for me. Then I ran into the black screen problem after this, but was able to fix that by setting the .ini file to automatically skip the intro video (steps listed above). 

Those were the only problems that I ran into, now I can play it no probs, even on my laptop! Hope this helps out!"

,CrazyAaron84,2012-06-13T09:00Z,"the biggest misconception among windows 7/vista users is that they think since they have direct x 11/10 then they already have 9... but they dont. when microsoft makes a new direct x version it does not include the previous version, meaning if you get the errors saying you are missing the direct x 9 files, you really are missing them! its not the same as a software update people, its a version number! its like trying to run mac games on a linux pc, you're close but no cigar!"

,arbpacman,2012-07-20T02:09Z,"@Pogie4 - No, it doent, only the Civ V, no expansions.

@The77s, @clayman18, and @SNDjunkie
This game DOES work with LAN, but to get it to work you will have to do a little steps:
1- Grant permission to your user to modify the file named steam_3dm, in your civ V installation folder (this is necessary so that you can save the file, or else you'll get permission denied error);
2- Open the file steam_3dm with notepad;
3- Change the Steam appid number to any other number, and in [settings], change your user name to any of your choice, but it MUST be different from the other users in the lan.
4- Save, run the game, and enjoy!!!

Well, at least this worked for me, and i had the same problem (stuck in loading).
Hope this helped!"
