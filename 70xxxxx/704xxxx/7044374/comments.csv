BUT

A/6.5  Volume is boosted, bass is distorted, appears to be mono.
V/7.5  Reduced way below 720p, just like most screener quality, small format TV's or laptops only.

M/3.0  Seriously, I fell asleep through it,,,,twice, I haven't/wont finish watching it."

,dennisdagger,2012-02-23T07:47Z,"GOODaudio n visual QUALITY but the watermark/logo thingy was hard to ignore, but after a while u 4get its even there.opinion on film:  ending iz crap i think lol"
,Sharak,2012-02-23T08:36Z,"The quality is probably comparable to VHS, or a good cam, 8/8.  The movie however was incredibly boring. I literally fell asleep halfway through. Components of the movie that try to build suspense didn't work for me, they seemed cliche. "
,Smithy087,2012-02-23T09:50Z,"A 4   Volume is boosted and distorted at times
V 6   Quality is good, but the watermark is constant, which becomes annoying.

M 6  Jumpy at times and catches you off guard, also has some slow parts as well."
,gratefulforthis,2012-02-23T13:23Z,"A-3 - Distorted and nasty.
V-6 - Bity and rough but totally watchable. Loses a point for the watermark.
M-6 - Not bad and definately a Hammer film."

,tpboss,2012-02-27T07:56Z,"Suprisingly good quality for a screen. There is a watermark spanning about 90% of the bottom of the screen, but its fairly low down so I guess it isn't too annoying. Although it is that someone seriously couldn't upload this vid without advertising their nothing little company. 

For a screening, V/9. As a video file, V/7

,sprongle,2012-03-24T00:19Z,"Much better quality than any other on TPB. The watermark is a small price to pay to view a clear, non-cam copy. The film is based on suspense and menace, not blood, guts and gore, so Saw-type horror fans won't like it. The 1989 version is much better and makes more sense. It is available on TPB too. The book, and the two films are all slightly different. Thank you for posting. "

,mikey_51,2012-04-03T21:02Z,"Good movie, not bad quality at all given the how long its been out, almost dvd id say (thats on a 55'"" screen so worth a look). 

Yes theres a watermark (which this uploader clearly didn't put on himself) but you only really notice it during the slow parts.

People rating this rips V as 7 and over are noobs that watch nothing but shitty quality. From an HD perspective this would be a V = 3. I'm not bagging out the quality because of the file size, I'm just giving a heads up to my fellow HD lovers. Also fuck you uploader for that piece of shit write writting at the bottom of the screen throughout the whole movie! Deleted it right away and am downloading another one as we speak."
