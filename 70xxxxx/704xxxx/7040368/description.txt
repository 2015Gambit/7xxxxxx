              An imprisoned IRA sniper is freed to help        
              stop a brutal, seemingly "faceless" assassin

              Yo listen up, we don't know how many times this  
              movie has been released as an internal after     
              DHQ, but we don't give a fuck, alright?! Here's  
              a proper because the previous DHQ release was    
              left at 30fps, while it should've been returned  
              to the original framerate of 24, alright? Check  
              the sample we included for proof.                
                                                               
              We also made it 1 cd because we're newbies and   
              can't handle the powers of AC3.

                We're now using XviD 1.0 final. That means     
                b-frames and shit.
