A seasonal food journey with native Kentuckian Maggie Green, The Kentucky Fresh Cookbook takes home chefs through a year in a Kentucky kitchen with more than 200 recipes. With a focus on the cook's activities in the kitchen, this book guides both aspiring and experienced cooks in the preparation of delicious meals using the delightful variety of foods found in Kentucky.

Green welcomes readers with her modern and accessible approach, incorporating seasonally available Kentucky produce in her recipes but also substituting frozen or canned food when necessary. She complements her year of recipes with tidbits about her own experiences with food, including regional food traditions she learned growing up in Lexington, attending the University of Kentucky, and raising a family in Northern Kentucky. The Kentucky Fresh Cookbook acknowledges the importance of Kentucky's culinary and agricultural traditions while showing how southern culture shapes food choices and cooking methods.

Green appeals to modern tastes using up-to-date, easy to follow recipes and cooking techniques, and she addresses the concerns of contemporary cooks with regard to saving time, promoting good health, and protecting the environment. The Kentucky Fresh Cookbook contains a year's worth of recipes and menus for everyday meals, holiday events, and special family occasions -- all written with Kentucky flair.
