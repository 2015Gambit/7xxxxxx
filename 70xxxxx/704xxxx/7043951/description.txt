The main purpose of Breaking the Taboo is to encourage a deep and well-informed debate on the complex drug issue in Brazil and abroad. The film intends to bring youth, families, teachers, physicians and society as a whole together for a long and honest conversation to reduce prejudice, help prevent drug use and spread scientific information on the issue.
Former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso leads the way in the documentary, after accepting Director Fernando Grostein Andradeâ€™s invite to join this quest for successful stories all over the world, in a constant dialogue with local youth and professionals dedicated to giving the drug issue a more humane and efficient treatment than the proposals of the War on Drugs declared by the US forty years ago.
Breaking the Taboo was created by filmmaker Fernando Grostein Andrade over the course of two years.
The documentary was filmed in eight countries, in fifty-eight days of shooting (thirty-one in Brazil and twenty-seven abroad), totaling 400 hours of footage, and 176 people interviewed: Brazil, United States, Portugal, Holland, Colombia, Switzerland, France and Argentina; and in cities such as Geneva, Amsterdam, Washington, Los Angeles, SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and BogotÃ¡, among others.
