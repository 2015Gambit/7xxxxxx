,sahilrox,2012-02-21T16:34Z,"This show is nice. I wonder why the ratings have dropped. Wanted this to surpass 10 seasons. In case of Two And A Half Men, i can understand that Charlie Sheen is a better actor than Ashton when it comes to sitcoms, but i wonder whats up with this? Still, it is one of the most popular tv series made. Kudos to all the actors and production team :

1. Josh Radnor (Ted)
2. Jason Segel (Marshall)
3. Cobie Smulders (Robin)
4. Alyson Hanigon (Lily)
5. Niel Pattrick Harris (Barney)
6. Carter Bays & Craig Thomas (Creators)

Thumbs Up People."
