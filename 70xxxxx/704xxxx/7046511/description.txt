NAMCOT - Dangerous Seed 1990 Original Sound Version Collection
Vertiphon 2012 Remaster

This torrent contains 19 tracks comprising the soundtrack for the Sega Genesis game Dangerous Seed by Namcot.

As with my other remasters, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an "album". Players will know that Dangerous Seed re-uses various tracks during the course of the game (particularly during Stage 8). For simplicity, I've split the stages and boss themes as the tracklist below denotes.

This collection of audio does NOT in any way duplicate audio from any other Dangerous Seed music CD (there was one, apparently, surely incredibly rare outside Japan), or Simon B's previous posting of this soundtrack on FFShrine.

Props to Mushaaleste on Youtube for his longplay, without which it would have been rather more difficult to correctly place each track to their respective stages and bosses.
 
http://www21.atwiki.jp/gamemusicbest100/pages/399.html was also helpful.  For the record, Project2162 have a mostly inaccurate tracklist for this game, as of publishing this soundtrack (February 2012).
