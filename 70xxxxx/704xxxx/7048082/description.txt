Please note that the roman numerals are the centuries in which these songs were first created. I first fell in love with this album after seeing the absolutely AMAZING trailer for this album which you may find here.

This is definitely my kind of music, as I fell in love with the Benedictine Abess, Hildegard von Bingen, when I was quite young, much to the chargrin of my Pagan parents. 

Certainly, this music will not appeal to everyone. But I do hope that those who have a medieval soul will appreciate the authenticity of these lovely tracks, of James\\\\\\\' deep voice and Maite\\\\\\\'s amazing soprano.

This is my first upload, as previously stated, if there are any errors, I am very sorry, and I invite you to message me regarding your questions comments and concerns.
