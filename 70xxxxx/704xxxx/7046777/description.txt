 elect the smiling, happy candidate. Anger does not translate to votes, even if itâ€™s about the right issues. 
Mark speculates on Romneyâ€™s tactics prior to the General Election.

Prager H2: Thin Ice
Mark Taylor fills in for Dennis. Based on Rick Santorumâ€™s recent comment about President Obamaâ€™s agenda not being based
 on the bible, was it a critical mistake or is he still electable? Mark asks why are we concerned with finding the
 â€œMost Conservative candidate?â€ when what we really need is the most electable candidate.
