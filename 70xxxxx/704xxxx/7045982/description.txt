K-Lite Codec Pack (64-bit) 5.9.0 Codec [Wednesday February 15th, 2012]


This is a bundle of 64-bit DirectShow filters that can be used together with 64-bit players, such as Windows Media Center.

This 64-bit pack can co-exist without problems with the regular K-Lite Codec Pack. In fact, it is recommended to install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the codec pack. That way you will get proper playback in both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Many multimedia applications are still 32-bit and will work fine on your 64-bit version of Windows.

Works on x64 versions of Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and Windows 7.
