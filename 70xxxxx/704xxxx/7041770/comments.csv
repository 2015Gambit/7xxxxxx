,BRAYHUNTER,2012-02-19T12:06Z,"Is there a way to get a 7.1 DTS sound on to MKV.

The only reason I ask is because all the films with 7.1 sound which get uploaded on here get down graded to 5.1.

Cant MKVs handle 7.1 sound? 

Some of us do have 7.1 setups so to hear the sound in which the director intended would be great.

Thanks"

,sjw71,2012-07-17T14:22Z,"Great quality, thanks DownTYU.

The movie itself was a huge let down though, visually superb but with bad acting, editing and a story that never really goes anywhere."
