Release Notes

Proper notes: What do you say to a LOL capper with 2
black eyes? Nothing you didn't already tell the bitch
twice. Same exact problem this week as last with the nasty
blendfest. We'll skip the screenshots, just go frame by
frame in any part of their cap and it's blindingly obvious.
