DA Pennebakers classic verite documentary as alternative / modern rock outfit Depeche Mode break 
America in 1989. The film follows Depeche Mode preparing for the final concert of their Music for 
the Masses tour at Pasadenas Rose Bowl while also following a group of young fans who have won 
tickets to the concert as they travel to the show by bus across America.

Im not sure about this. Lets go home' lead singer Dave Gahan tells the rest of the band before 
they take the stage in Pasadena. Pennebaker tracks Depeche Mode as their 1987 Music for the Masses 
album and tour prepares the way for 1990's Violator hit album and tour, which saw the boys from 
Basildon turn into monsters
