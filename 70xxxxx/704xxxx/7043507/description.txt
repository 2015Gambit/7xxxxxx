The Mamas And The Papas  Complete Anthology
Released: 2004
Label: Universal.
Format:Mp3@320



What's in a name? If you love mid-'60s folk-rockers the Mamas & the Papas, this four-volume U.K. Complete Anthology  speaks for itself. The 101 selections run in excess of five hours centering on the vintage long-players If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears (1966), The Mamas & the Papas (1966), The Mamas & the Papas Deliver (1967), The Papas & the Mamas (1968), People Like Us (1971), and The Monterey International Pop Festival (1971). But the real bonus for the hardcore fan comes in the form of the nearly 90 minutes of hard-to-find material ranging from the quartet's debut as support vocalists for Barry McGuire, to rare singles, audio from a pair of television appearances, and a bevy of post-Mamas & the Papas entries from John Phillips, Michelle Phillips, Cass Elliot, and Denny Doherty as solo artists. will want to hold onto copies of All the Leaves Are Brown if for no other reason than the mono "I Saw Her Again," the sole Mamas & the Papas-related release absent from Complete Anthology. ~
