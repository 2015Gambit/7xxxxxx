
Recorded 9th October 1959. This release 1990 on Blue Note.

Review by Scott Yanow:
The Modern Jazz Quartet never actually recorded for Blue Note but their United Artists date was reissued on this Blue Note CD. The MJQ (vibraphonist Milt Jackson, pianist John Lewis, bassist Percy Heath and drummer Connie Kay) perform six of Lewis's compositions which were used in the film Odds Against Tomorrow. Best known is "Skating in Central Park" but all of the selections have their memorable moments and it is good to hear this classic unit playing such fresh material. 

01. Skating In Central Park   
02. No Happiness For Slater   
03. A Social Call   
04. Cue #9   
05. A Cold Wind Is Blowing   
06. Odds Against Tomorrow
