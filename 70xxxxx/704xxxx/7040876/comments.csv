,sr.olav,2012-02-29T00:49Z,WHY DID I GET MALWARE ATTENTION FROM AVAST? why anonymous cuz u give a bad torrent...
,Damu714,2012-03-01T02:34Z,"Your 100% right, that's why I told everyone I pressed anonymous ""in the first comment using my actual username""... If you knew anything you would understand that antivirus software is going to tell you that a keygen is a virus, because they are setup to detect what is known as PuP's or potentially unwanted programs!!! As I said, this Isn't mine, but it does check out, and I have checked it for viruses, it is clean quit trying to scare people..."
,N4o7A,2012-03-17T12:40Z,"Thanks bro, dling rite now."
,Angertek,2012-03-19T20:49Z,You guys ARE AWESOME!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR THIS! i will definitely seed this. THANK YOU!!!!XDXDXDXD 
,xtester71,2012-04-14T14:44Z,"omg man ur so awesome, thanks so much :D"
,coonday,2012-04-19T04:31Z,Don't download this. I received a terrible virus from it.  Utorrent even detected something from it and it WASN'T the keygen like Damu714 says.  He's probably lying about everything he said earlier. Look elsewhere and stop seeding this.
,dkgaby69,2012-04-21T02:52Z,love it thank you man it works perfectly i will seed for awhile :3 . serious is works perfectly. ++++
,Damu714,2012-04-21T10:29Z,"@coonday it's clean... Don't be dumb, the only thing causing flags to raise  are bitches like you. Read the rest of the comments."
,Rimwich,2012-04-23T22:02Z,"I must be missing something, I don't have anything like this in the torrent file:

5-Run xfzb4kg (key generator)

Where do I find the key generator?"
,Rimwich,2012-04-23T22:53Z,"Never mind. Turns out my firewall was deleting the key generator without asking me. Seems to be working for. Make sure when you enter your request code, you keep the dashes in (ie 1111-2222-3333)"
,likwidmotive,2012-04-28T19:56Z,"Actually Damu714, it's called a False Positive. Keygens usually show up as these because it uses code that resembles something made to attack a computer, but it really just generates possible keys. 

If I made a program that remembers all your keystrokes and gives you suggestions of possible word choices, but used open source code from a keylogger, it would more than likely be detected as a false positive. "
,aqueousflame,2012-06-05T19:22Z,thank you muchly. it is nice to keep up with the latest software. not everyone can access demonoid so we all appreciate the reup here.

,mandrac6,2012-07-20T16:51Z,"http://img15.hostingpics.net/pics/410353guesswhat.png

,xhizors,2012-07-25T11:39Z,@coonday: Your first mistake was using uTorrent as anti-virus software. lol.
,Sahfire9,2012-07-25T16:30Z,"my keygen keeps getting transformed in a .0xe file, what is happening??"
