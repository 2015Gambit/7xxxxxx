This is my 7th official SC-SDH release since TNA Impact HDTV 2009-05-28 XviD-AT-SDH that was uploaded by AhsokaTano and I have decided to return to capturing and encoding and uploading and I hope everyone appeciates my time and effort put into doing this each and every week. I don't have to do this. I am only doing it as a favor to the wrestling fans around the world who appreciated my efforts in the past (2005-2009) here on The Pirate Bay to bring wrestling to the fans from the fans.
