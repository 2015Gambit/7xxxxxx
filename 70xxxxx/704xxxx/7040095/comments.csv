My torrents are now uploaded by a friend of mine. I gave him acces to my account here at tpb, cuz I can not upload through other proxies. I do upload my releases at 1337x and extratorrent and kickasstorrents. 
But I wont ask my friend forever to upload here at tpb. If you want to have my releases in the next future......I really recommend you to follow me on Facebook. Username is: Headdock Trance"
