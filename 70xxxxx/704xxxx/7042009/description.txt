"Worth every penny", September 4, 2009 By T. Gardiner


I love Scorpions, Old Dokken, WASP, Some Warrant, Great White, bands like that. I can listen to 95 out if a 100 Pretty Maids songs and think that was great stuff. The Guitar will blow you away and the lyrics actually were well done and have a lot of thought and meaning. I lost track of these guy after Future World. In 2004 I found my tape from years ago and thought these guy kicked ass. I finally could afford some music so I looked these guys up on amazon. I now own almost every album (I have never really liked live albums.) I listen to these guy or scorpions almost every day.
