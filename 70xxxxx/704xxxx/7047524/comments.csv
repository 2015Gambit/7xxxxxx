@NoizeF , Well tell me, how are you going to listen FLACs with a car stereo that only has usb connection and no aux/line-in?"
,merrimanlyon,2012-09-16T05:10Z,having FLAC is the only thing you need. convert that shit. to whatever you want. Your starting point is flawless audio. step it down to whatever lossy shit you want
