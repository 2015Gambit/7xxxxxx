                         Star Wars The Clone Wars
                      +++ DVDRip/HDTV (XviD/MP3) +++
                        The Complete  Season 1,2,3
                                  OAR
                          (Original Aspect Ratio)
                           (Cinemascope, 2,35:1)


The Grand Army of the Republic, led by Yoda, Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and other Jedi Knights, fights the New Droid Army of the Separatists.


There is no other torrent around, that got all episodes in OAR and is as consistent in resolution and quality as this one. The first two seasons I ripped from DVD and the third is a better version of my first Clone Wars torrent.
I re-encoded all episodes to match the resolution and this time NO hardcoded subs.
Speaking of which - I am sorry, but there are no subtitles for the DVDRips at all. For the HDTV Rips just look for the scene-releases from BiA, they should fit.

The Quality should be o.k., at least watchable.
But please feel free to comment :)!


List of Episodes:

And here is an interesting approach to a chronological order of episodes:
  http://dauntlessmedia.net/starwars/clone-wars/episode-timeline.html


Format :		XviD
File size:  		180 MiB avg. per episode
Duration : 		21 min avg. per episode
Width : 		1014 pixels
Height : 		432 pixels
Aspect ratio :  	2,35:1
Frame rate :    	25 fps
Audio:  		MP3
Nr. of Files:		66 + 1 Teaser + 1 Trailer + 1 txt  = 69


All files properly named.


After 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.
