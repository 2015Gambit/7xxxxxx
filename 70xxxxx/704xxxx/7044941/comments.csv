Although I typically prefer x264 encoding, this still looks great nonetheless, and excellent work on keeping the original aspect ratio (and credits!).

Thanks!"
,Pirat34Life,2012-03-16T05:44Z,Seriously! Best Clone Wars torrent of all time! Thanks -JL
,scanfox99,2012-03-30T14:50Z,"OAR = Original Aspect Ratio
in case someone asks... ;)"
,GoldenAce12345,2012-04-11T14:07Z,thanks man
,tommyle,2012-04-26T10:55Z,Is it me or is this a bit stretched?
,oldmmx,2012-05-15T18:03Z,Any chance to get spanish subtitles for your rips?
[V],manOtor,2012-05-15T23:27Z,"@tommyle:
Not stretched. It's the Original Aspect Ratio. Called Cinemascope (2,35:1). The way the episodes were meant to be seen ;).
They crop it for TV to get the 16:9 ratio to avoid the black bars on your usual flat screen TVs.


@oldmmx:
I am very sorry, but I ripped without subs, and gave the source away right after I was done.
So if nobody volunteers to make some... :("
,drako314,2012-05-18T11:21Z,"Best Star Wars Clone Wars season 1,2,3, out there. 
A=10
V=9.7
Series: Priceless

Very watchable on 1080 hi def widescreen. and for only 11.5GB much better than the 30GB or so  a piece for 1080 hi def seasons.

I highly recommend this torrent, episodes in order, OAR, great upload speed (in excess of 600KB/s) and real DVD-rip so i can play on my TV! Thanks manOtor + seeders i will continue to seed this forever! (VLC media player plays everything fine) "
,spara666,2012-05-18T15:16Z,Looks good thank you.
,gothamcityusa,2012-07-05T08:22Z,"best quality available. no doubt about it. taking quite some time to dl , but worth it. thx uploader!"
,tommyle,2012-09-12T08:59Z,"Weird. When I play the videos, the picture appears very stretched. I know that this is OAR, but on my computer, it seems like it is stretched vertically. The faces appear very long. Is anyone having this problem?"
[V],Stuff_and_Shit,2012-09-20T06:13Z,"@tommyle:

You have to switch your players aspect ratio to 2.35:1.
Use VLC, the player recognizes the format and uses the correct aspect automatically."
