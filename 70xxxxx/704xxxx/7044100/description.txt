NOTES:

Sources:
Video was a small 352 x 288 file and also have several cam movements with one major one 10mins into the film.
Colours and brightness etc...not too bad otherwise.
Audio was cam audio we were given and its not that bad too be honest.....

Workdone:
Took the video and cut into 4 files for each movement part and then cropped and resized each part ...so AR does change
but only way to append them altogehter without adding black borders.
Also used a heavy noise filter,HQ smoother,brightness,contrast,chroma and rgb eq...

Audio we just needed to sync .....notice there is arounf 8 secs missing in the video when syncing and that was roughly around
the cam movement times so nothing major and without telling you ,you more than likely wouldn't notice.

Ona side note ...Line is out and is internal so we'll be doing a TS soon ...but until its off internal,heres a cam version for 
those that can't wait or really ain't too bothered.
