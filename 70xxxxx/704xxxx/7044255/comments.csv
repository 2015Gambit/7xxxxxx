,pacocrowley,2012-03-08T05:45Z,"@MarkGreen

aXXo rips were the best when a lot of people had 1 Mbps conections (or less) and it took like 3 hours or more to download a single 700 MB file.

AND, is this the ""final"" version? or the retail? many people said that the retail version looked good, but had bad audio."
,cris11,2012-03-10T19:57Z,excellent quality same as a matroska 8gb or 11gb movie file on video but the audio is lower than what it used to be (at least for me im using 2 normal speakers  and divx player pro)

,swanze,2012-03-26T22:47Z,"This is not 1080p!!! It's just ripped in 1920 x 1036. When played on my projector it looks grainy and pixilated and you can visibly see lines running across the screen.
This should be removed from the ""Highres"" section and listed under ""Large screen size but shit quality"" section!!! But the file size was a bit of a giveaway...."

I highly recommend this one over any other Immortals torrent on TPB.

Audio - 9

Highly recommended.
Thanks YIFY."
