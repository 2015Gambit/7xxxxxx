At a Kali-times Google and corporations decided, which New Bhagavad-Gita MUST BE better for masses.
Today You all ISCKON forces is in your hands.

\"ISKCON now distributes a Bhagavad-gita that contains more than 5,000 unauthorized changes. Srila Prabhupada gave all his classes from his original Bhagavad-gita As It Is and read from this book personally on a daily basis and listened to his disciples read from it, and commented on the philosophical points as they read. With the exception of a couple of obvious typographical errors, Srila Prabhupada never at any point of time ordered that his Bhagavad-gita be changed. He most certainly did not authorize the production of a revised and enlarged edition of his book.\"

We are not Vegetarians: Srila Prabhupada said \"Weâ€™re â€œKrsnatarians.â€ Rabbits are vegetarian,

Srila Prabhupada writes, â€œExtravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending, and matingâ€”which are demands of the bodyâ€”can block advancement in the practice of yoga. As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept prasÃ¤dam, sanctified food.â€ We eat vegetarian food, but we are not vegetarians. Weâ€™re â€œKrsnatarians.â€ Rabbits are vegetarian, elephants are vegetarian. So what? Krsna says, â€œIf all you can offer is a leaf, flower, or fruit, offer it with love. And take the remnants, the prasÃ¤dam. What I want is your devotion.â€
