[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-20T12:04Z,"Yeah, it is always slow when I am the only person seeding at first coz I have max upload of 80kb/s. Once a few seeds are on it, then everyone gets it faster!! So, again, thank you to all the people that help me seed this show :)"
,djt067,2012-02-20T12:13Z,"I always seed for at least 24 hours if not more with these cos I know it does make a difference, thx to everyone that makes all this possible, that way we all benefit. Bring on MIC I say, cant wait."
