It's sort of misleading for some people who are actually looking for Blu Rays and High Res films."
,Esset88,2012-02-23T09:43Z,"You need to copy the link and paste it in a new tab. No idea why opning with ""opening in new tab""-function does not work with shareimage. "
,benn371,2012-02-23T10:45Z,the screenshots shows these are not HD rips?? they look like theater prints WTF?
,filstaff404,2012-02-23T17:44Z,"Screenshots are from Underworld 2, not from Underworld Awakening."
,Sunseeker908,2012-02-23T17:52Z,Is this cam or BR rip?  Can anyone comment on quality?
,Alexonfire7,2012-02-25T19:27Z,"Its a cam, but in ""HD""... quality is no good... this should be in the cam section, not here"
,wolfbeast,2012-02-28T20:20Z,"It would be nice if people do not label torrents ""BRRip"" or ""BluRay"" when the source is not actually a BR disc or master."
,k_akshay007,2012-02-29T18:12Z,"the screenshots are not working,,,,,,they say ""403 Forbidden server"" 

and yes proper labeling is very important so that people are not misled!"
,Micke710619,2012-03-11T14:12Z,The voices come from the right channel and not from the center speker.
,shadowpath21,2012-04-10T22:58Z,"You can switch the audio from right channel to center and it will be just fine, except for an annoying buzzing sound that plays constantly through the movie."
