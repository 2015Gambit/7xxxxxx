Dream Evil tour

SOURCE : EX+ FM MASTER - WRTL broadcast - sample provided

PLEASE NOTE : I shared this concert here back in 2007 from the same source ; this time you get 2 extra tracks (208 & 209) ;
the setlist is more complete and I have split tracks 205 & 206 whick were part of a single track on the previous post.
If you already have my previous source, you may choose to DL tracks 205 to 209 only. Basically the quality is unchanged.

IMPORTANT NOTICE : I used MD before I got a computer ; I threw away the master cassettes which were torn and blocked anyway.
So this MD is all I have. Please considerer the DBX was a professional noise reduction whick may puzzle TLH analysis : don't believe TLH if
he tells you some of the files are mp3 ! Trust me instead :-)

LINEAGE : QUAD FM3 tuner -> Marantz cassette recorder DBX on
-> Sony MDS JE-520 MD recorder for tracks, edits
-> optical cable -> Pioneer PDR 609 stand alone CD burner
