Sega - Sonic The Hedgehog 1990 Original Sound Version Collection
Vertiphon 2012 Remaster

This torrent contains the 19 tracks that comprise the soundtracks for the Sega Genesis / Megadrive game Sonic The Hedgehog by Sonic Team / Sega.

As with my Gunstar Heroes OSV remaster, I have added some sympathetic mastering, made appropriate edits and rearranged the tracklist so that it makes for a better listen as an "album".

This collection of audio does NOT in any way duplicate audio from any other Sonic The Hedgehog music CD.
