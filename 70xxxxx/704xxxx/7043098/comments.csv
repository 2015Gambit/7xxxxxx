,mattchoi365,2012-06-30T14:26Z,people i prefer this game! all you have to do is lauch this game (after u download it) TWICE because the first time it may me a white or black screen. plus if it is black or white screen just press esc or escape on your keyboard and it will show the mouse. then you will still have black screen but hear the music. just press enter until you are directed back to finder. then launch the game for the second time and i am sure it will work.
