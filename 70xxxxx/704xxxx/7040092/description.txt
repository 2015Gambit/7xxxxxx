his Beautiful Life - Helen Schulman

When the Bergamots move from a comfortable upstate college town to New York City, theyâ€™re not quite sure how theyâ€™ll adaptâ€”or what to make of the strange new world of well-to-do Manhattan. Soon, though, Richard is consumed by his executive role at a large New York university, and Liz, who has traded in her academic career to oversee the lives of their children, is hectically ferrying young Coco around town.

Fifteen-year-old Jake is gratefully taken into the fold by a group of friends at Wildwood, an elite private school.

But the upper-class cocoon in which they have enveloped themselves is ripped apart when Jake wakes up one morning after an unchaperoned party and finds an email in his in-box from an eighth-grade admirer. Attached is a sexually explicit video she has made for him. Shocked, stunned, maybe a little proud, and scaredâ€”a jumble of adolescent emotionâ€”he forwards the video to a friend, who then for-wards it to a friend. Within hours, itâ€™s gone viral, all over the school, the city, the world.

The ensuing scandal threatens to shatter the Bergamotsâ€™ sense of security and identity, and, ultimately, their happiness. They are a good family faced with bad choices, and how they choose to react, individually and at one anotherâ€™s behest, places everything they hold dear in jeopardy.

This Beautiful Life is a devastating exploration of the blurring boundaries of privacy and the fragility of self, a clear-eyed portrait of modern life that will have readers debating their assumptions about family, morality, and the sacrifices and choices we make in the name of love.
