,joanmcbitch,2012-02-21T16:32Z,"I think the question is: WHY have they not patched things up with/put Sam Simon back in the writing room & Mike Reiss back on hiring phones?!?!? Clearly, his ability in vetting Conan O'Brien & John Swartzwelder should give him leeway in the responsibility department concerning the crapola douche bag assholes (rejected from the fuck-fests 'Everybody Loves Dickmouth' & 'Tyler Perry Presents: CockGobbling') are writing now. But I digress..."
,ViolentC,2012-02-22T05:26Z,"Good discussion.
I would like to hear from anyone who has a good argument for why this show should stay on the air. cos I can't think of any, tho I download and watch each episode I often ask myself why I bother with this show at all any more. ""Addiction accours when you no longer do the thing for purposes of fun"" or something like that..."
,joanmcbitch,2012-02-23T09:02Z,"Peaks & valleys, I suppose. There's always that (ever so) slight possibility they'll find someone who will write an episode I give a shit about again."
