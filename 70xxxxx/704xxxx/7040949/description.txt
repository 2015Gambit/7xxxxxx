Yesshows is the second live album by British progressive rock group Yes. Released shortly after the 
appearance of Drama, Yesshows comprises live performances ranging from the summer of 1976 to the 
supporting tour for Tormato in 1978. The album's release was supervised by bassist Chris Squire.

Like the group's previous live album, Yessongs, Yesshows begins with a recording of Igor Stravinskys 
Firebird Suite. Unlike the Yessongs version, the band members may be heard playing in tandem with the 
Stravinsky track on this recording.

Although Rick Wakeman is the keyboardist on most tracks, the 1976 performances ("The Gates of Delirium" 
and "Ritual - Nous Sommes du Soleil") feature Patrick Moraz. Moraz left Yes just before the recording 
of Going for the One.

On the original double vinyl LP, "Ritual (Nous Sommes Du Soleil)" was split in two, with its second 
half continuing on Side D of the record. For the CD edition, it was stitched back together, although 
each part is allotted its own track number.

The album shows photographs of the band's late 1970s live stage performances. Around 1977 they developed 
the idea of a circular rotating stage, known informally as performing "in the round", with Jon Andersons 
microphone hanging from the ceiling of the venue.


Recorded 17 August 1976 - 28 October 1978....Released 24 November 1980
