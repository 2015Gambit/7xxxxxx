It could be that some of these apps are already outdated (for example, newest version is V5.0.35 instead of V5.0.34). 

If that's the case, I didn't bother updating because the only thing that changed was e.g. 'small bug fixes'. The apps in this file are stable on iPhone 3g, 4 & 4s and iPod Touch 3g & 4g. I'm not sure if they're working on the iPad (2) as well, so if you are able to try this please let us know the results in the comments"
