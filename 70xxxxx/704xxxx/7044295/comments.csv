,reine12,2012-02-29T22:02Z,subs????
,LackThereof,2012-03-02T05:31Z,Does this have any of the commentary tracks?
,reine12,2012-03-02T08:37Z,"This is NOT a Blu-Ray rip. It's just the complete series in one folder! No extras here, and as i can understand it no subs? Watching a series like this without subs, is like ride your car on the rims, with no wheels on it..."
,LackThereof,2012-03-02T08:58Z,"Downloaded one episode out of the batch and checked for myself.

Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 23.98fps [English (Video 1)]
Audio: DTS 48000Hz 6ch [English (Audio 1)]

Only one audio track and no subtitles.  Very high quality video and sound, but doesn't have any of the blu-ray extras.

Very fast seeds on this torrent right now."
,dramrah,2012-03-13T00:33Z,"How can you even get ride of the Dothraki? I could have sworn they were hardcoded on the frames. 

Anyone have any clues on this? The subs distract me cuz I know the show well and I want to DL a 1080 version w/o subs or remove them myself. 

Thoughts?"

,MCSmarties,2012-04-04T17:32Z,"Some bad information in the comments here.
While I am not 100% sure that it's a indeed a Bluray rip, I think it is. (Note: I said RIP, not BD-R!)

Also, there ARE english subtitles muxed into the mkv containers. However:
- they are PGS format so some players may not support them
- there are no separate ""forced"" subtitles for Dothraki. It's all or nothing.
Hope this clears some confusion!

Great quality release, thanks to the ripper and uploader!"
