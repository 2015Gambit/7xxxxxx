I didn't create this.  This was created by sidxx55 and ps2gamer of http://deioncube.in.  I simply packaged it as an installer and made it available via torrent since it's a hard to find item.  It took me 5 bloody hours to find something that worked for modern encryption.

Enjoy!

How to use
==========

Decoding a file:

#1: Put dezender in a path without spaces or dots (example C:\dezender)

#2: Drag ioncubed/zended file in DECODE_NWS.bat or DECODE_RM.bat and it should produce a decoded file.

---

Decoding multiple files:

#1: Put dezender in a path without spaces or dots (example C:\dezender)

#2: Put the program that needs dezending in _decode (the whole program is fine),
    it will only parse php files but it will copy all other files to the decoded folder.

#3: Run DECODE_NWS.bat or DECODE_RM.bat

#4: Sit back, grab another beer, should be done shortly depending on the size of the program

#5: Take a look in _decoded_nws or _decoded_rm (depends on the dezender used)
