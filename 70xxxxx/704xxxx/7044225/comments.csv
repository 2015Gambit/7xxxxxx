Freur (which I don't know how to pronounce, and who knows what it means) was the precursor to Underworld, one of the most storied names in electronic-derivative music: house/techno/trance - call it what you will. Doot Doot is a great song which lends itself to every scene of every Hollywood coming of age film. Can someone even list the movies it has been played in?"
