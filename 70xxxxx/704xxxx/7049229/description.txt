This is another ISO file I made. It fits onto a standard DVDR blank disc and is NTSC 29fps standard. You can do other things with it including making PAL format, but as is it is ready to burn a DVD to be watched on TV. The picture looks better on a TV screen than on a PC monitor. It will play from beginning to end in well over '9 Hours' and it can also be watched starting at a choice of 3 parts by selection from the menu. So there's way to much for me to list since there are so many short video clips from many sources in the 1st and 3rd (Extras) sections, but I'll try to give it justice briefly...

Extras...1896-1974
Well this has clips of motor vehicles from those years from little known today pioneering examples to others which are famous. Norton, Mercedes, Indian, Porsche, Ducati, Auto Union, Avro Arrow, US 4cly bikes, Tiger (I & II)tanks (as running today), rockets, A-bombs, the LeMans tragedy, 500cc V-8 Moto-Guzzi, Edsel, GM Corvair, Citroen, the Nurburgring, Ford GT-40, Honda GP 250-6, Amphicar, Honda GP 125-5, BSA, Volkswagen, 60s GP car racing, Brigitte Bardot, Gina Lollobrigida, Renault Alpine, NSU Ro8, Giacomo Agostini & the 350 MV Agusta 6, Barbara Eden, Porsche 917, Steve McQueen, Dodge Coronet, the Beatles, Newport cigarettes and more. Most of the videos are pretty good to excellent, but some not so good but still watchable. Most of these are only 1-3 minutes long with the odd one being a fair bit longer. So this is a compressed overview of the late 1800s to 1974 more or less..mostly relating to vehicles but also a bit to life in general. If this sounds like the sort of stuff that you like..you should enjoy it.

Many thanks again to DeVeDe which lets you adjust disc usage and can cram so much onto a disc. I made this back in 2010. It took quite a while to collect lots of video and then choose what made the final selection...and what didn't. It should provide enjoyable viewing for a long time into the future.
