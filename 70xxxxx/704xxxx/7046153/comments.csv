,munkynutz,2012-02-21T05:19Z,"@sumerian actually froggie is right and he was respectful about it, he uploads quality like extremezone and tvteam, they are the top uploaders for a reason, i just tried watching this and can barely see anything, thanks to the uploader anyway but i will wait for something better"
,mr2old,2012-02-21T07:13Z,"Fake or real...do NOT waste your time. Was at a screening of it and watched people flock out and, personally, am VERY sorry I didn't follow em.  TERRIBLE movie"

,tpboss,2012-02-21T09:21Z,"WOWWWW...THIS is like...someone got a disposable video camera and held it in their hand, out of focus and off center, through a low-class movie theater.

,spankdaddy,2012-02-21T16:46Z,"Ok sumer I might joke alot but im no dummy,... you missed the entire point of my post and that was to show froggie respect and not disrespect him like what happened. Froggie was very respectful in his response but was not given the same...and im not sure on your confusion on my name is spelled right infront of you... should i make it caps or spaces to make it more clear to you? Hey I wanna do whatever I can to clear that up for ya :)"
,Paddles,2012-02-22T02:53Z,"the quality on this is awful even for a cam, the audio is great tho, this isnt a fake either so ignore the posts about that"

,pimpmobile,2012-02-23T03:38Z,"This movie might be good if your a 13 year old, way too childish for my liking!  The movie was mostly special effects with a poor story and bad acting.  Oh I'm some little kid with special powers people want me cause I'm so powerful yet cant seem to do what I want boo hoo!"

,djnero,2012-02-24T00:22Z,"its watchable to me, but i do however object to the bit right at the begining when he says about an ilegal download, nick cage needs to suck his own face off by his own reasoning then, people now will ""believe"" they may goto hell for downloading, mostly americans agreed, but thats not the point, programming people through ""entertainment"" is as old school as you can get"
,hulk101,2012-02-24T15:31Z,usually Froggie puts out great stuff but this one must have slipped through the cracks cause the video stinks it's blurry has double vision and is out of focus for 90% of the film I would just wait ... if you can be patient!
,crittman,2012-02-26T05:14Z,It looks like someone tried recording the 3D version of the movie...
