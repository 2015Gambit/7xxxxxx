,gaddavir,2012-02-22T13:37Z,Works and it's great. Even had my internet drivers!
,ebthepcguy,2012-02-22T21:37Z,"LuxLOL, 
I really appreciate your unattended installations of Windows XP, but considering that Microsoft is ending support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014, maybe it's time for you to work on a new project. Perhaps Windows Vista or Windows 7 would be more appropriate. Let me know what you think."
,LuxLOL,2012-02-22T21:52Z,"That's still over two years. :D
I wait till Win8 is out and then compare it against Win7.
Win7 still gets service packs, WinXP should have by now 2 more service packs with all this updates that are out for WinXP SP3."
,Cerebral222,2012-02-23T06:58Z,"Thanks LuxLOL, a m8 just gave me an EL1600 eMachine with 2gig of RAM & onboard only graphics, this is not suited for windows 7, but XP is perfect for this little rig, you even had the right drivers in this edition to allow me to get on the net right away, thanks for this upload, +1 from me, Cheers."

,dimmix,2012-02-24T18:48Z,i can;t find the product key
,LuxLOL,2012-02-24T19:27Z,"Read the Read Me file or Torrent Description ->

(o) General Infos:
* ... a Valid WGA CD-Key is already inserted ...

(o) Infos for Newbies:
* If you want to change the Windows XP CD-Key after the Windows XP installation then use the Tool ""Keyfinder (Key Changer) v1.51.exe"" that you find in the ""(source)\OEM\INFOS"" folder on the Burned Optical Disc and in the ISO file. You can also change the Windows XP Owner and Company with this Tool."
,tirupathy,2012-02-25T18:41Z,"Dear LuxLOL 
You are doing a fantastic job.Thank you."
,Dregon909,2012-02-26T05:07Z,"Thank you very much, Computer won't connect to the internet, and need to reinstall OS but don't have the disc, hopefully this'll do the job. :)"
,expirii,2012-02-28T01:20Z,"Got error messages about missing file in the file copy phase, and install stalled shortly after first boot.

The burned disc was verified."
,LuxLOL,2012-02-28T09:55Z,"Read Me file ->

* If you are getting corrupted file error(s) or missing file error(s) during the Windows XP installation then try this:
1. Burn the Disc at the lowest possible speed.
2. Don't use old scratched Discs.
3. Try to clean your Optical disc drives.
4. Use another Optical disc drive to install Windows XP.
5. Try to install Windows XP from a USB Flash drive."
,expirii,2012-02-28T13:12Z,"The problem I had with missing files, which were the same with CDs burned with different programs on different burnes, was related to me not wanting to do a clean install.

Trying now with a clean install and it appears to be working greatly.

Thus: This CD cannot be used for anything but a clean install, as some of the files needed for that is not included.

And Hibernation will only work if you have installed your computer drivers."
,LuxLOL,2012-03-02T04:59Z,All CD-Keys work if you do a fresh installation.

,LuxLOL,2012-03-07T00:38Z,Don't know what you do to get this error but you should first check out the WinToFlash f贸rum and google. And if you still have problems to get it to wokr then use a CD-ROM driver.
,authoriseduser,2012-03-07T14:05Z,Great work again.  Thanks for the updated version.
,sogman808,2012-03-08T11:56Z,"LuxLOL: /salute

If I were gay, and had a spare bazillion dollars, I'd marry you mate!
You seriously know your stuff, and you've crafted this Black Edition with as much skill as Leonardo da Vinci has shown .. (a man of ""unquenchable curiosity"" and ""feverishly inventive imagination"")
Cheers mate :)"

I want to put it on a CD, I just burn it or is there any thing else?"
,LuxLOL,2012-03-19T22:26Z,Even a Newibe should know to download the new version and to read the Read Me file ;-)
,lynchy46645,2012-03-20T02:10Z,"i had the same problem as @expirii did this is not suitable for dual booting since the extra setup post install will only work on drive c for some shit reason i dont want to fresh install but look like im forced to

@luxlol is this problem fixed in your newest version by any chance?"
,LuxLOL,2012-03-20T06:07Z,"There is nothing to fix.
You can install it on every Drive letter you want.
You should Google for tutorials on how to make a WinXP dual boot it works if you do it correctly like it should be done.

,john1233,2012-04-30T08:15Z,"I downloaded this torrent, and installed it on my laptop with no troubles and it is quite nice, but the computer that i downloaded it on (this one) now has multiple viruses. Malwarebytes found two trojans and vipre found the same trojans and a keylogger in the unzipped torrent, which is confusing, because the actual laptop i installed it on has found none of those. the install is clean but the zip has viruses?

Anyways, if lux could help shed some light on this it would be greatly appreciated. I am very concerned about the keylogger because since then I have ordered stuff on my credit card and entered all kinds of sensitive info."
,john1233,2012-04-30T08:27Z,"specifically it was in the keychanger. Trojans were in the key changer. I think that it is pretty normal for those to be a false positive, but i would wait for lux to respond before downloading and maybe someone can vouch for the torrent?"
,bluerainbug,2012-05-27T04:03Z,"For all newbies. After downloading, simply burn this ISO file with Magic ISO with the lowest possible speed. you can find Magic ISO here http://www.magiciso.com/download.htm After doing so, you should have a bootable disc in no time. Just pop it in your cd/dvd tray and boot from cd/dvd. If you have any trouble booting from cd/dvd, you'll find tons of instructional videos on youtube. Good Luck!"
