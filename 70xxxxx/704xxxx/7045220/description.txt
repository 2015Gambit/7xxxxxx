Long running British situation comedy with the vaguest of situations. The Goodies are a three man agency whose brief is to do \'anything, anytime\'. This gave the series carte blanche to do whatsoever it pleased, with a cartoon-like surrealism and a heavy reliance on slapstick. Ran for ten years on BBC TV before removing for one final series to the commercial channel London Weekend Television.
