,.KRAAG.,2012-09-27T00:22Z,"Quality is absolutely terrible for most of the episodes, out of ten, it varies between ONE and FIVE.
Audio is not much better, very low bitrate for most episodes, sometimes only one channel (left or right speakers)

Considering this is the only torrent with all the episodes, it's better than nothing!

Thanks Alfcon68 - for the trip down memory lane."
