Ancient Voices, Modern World:
Acclaimed anthropologist Wade Davis journeys into hidden worlds to find cultures that have preserved their ways of life in the face of modern society.


1)  Mongolia 
Acclaimed anthropologist and explorer Wade Davis travels to the Central Asian steppes of Mongolia to meet descendents of Genghis Khan. These people are remnants of an ancient nomadic horse culture that thrived in the region's harsh conditions for more than 2,000 years.

2)  Australia 
National Geographic joins Wade Davis on a journey deep into the Australian outback to document the disappearing cultures of Australia's Aborigines, thought to be one of the oldest groups of peoples on earth. After losing clan members to disease, war, and famine-as well as battling enforced relocations-small Aboriginal clans must fight to keep traditions alive for the next generation.

3)  Amazon 
National Geographic ventures into the rain forest with Wade Davis for an up-close look at the Barasana River people, a group believed to be descendents of the legendary "lost" Amazonians. Davis embarks on a symbolic journey that will honour the group's ancestors and witnesses the rituals that demonstrate respect for this tropical landscape.

4)  Colombia 
Acclaimed anthropologist and explorer Wade Davis makes a remarkable journey into the heart of war-torn Colombia to visit one of the indigenous groups that call themselves the Elder Brothers. These extraordinary people claim to be the last descendants of a once-great civilization, the Tairona, and to speak with their voice. Could they be the last window we have on the great high civilizations of the ancient Americas?
