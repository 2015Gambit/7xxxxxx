IjGPuw/yl.tib

try putting this in Applescript Editor.app
display dialog ""Here:"" & return & ""(copy and paste this)"" default answer (reverse of characters of ""IjGPuw/yl.tib"") as text"
,alkwef,2012-02-23T03:44Z,"Holy crap, I can't believe they let that through. from now on, I'll just post all links in reverse. 
The applescript to do this BTW is:
