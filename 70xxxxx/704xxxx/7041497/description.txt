Baka: A Cry from the Rainforest
Phil Agland revisits the Baka Pygmy family he filmed 25 years ago in this Bafta-winning documentary. He explores how life has changed for the new generation: the children of the old film are now parents; Camera, who was born at the end of the first film and named after Phil's film camera, now has a seven-year-old daughter, Ambi. Camera's brother Ali also has a young daughter, who is disabled. For the first time the Baka watch themselves in the original film on a huge screen in the forest. Seeing how their parents used to live prompts an epic journey deep into the forest to rediscover the old life of their fathers. The story that unfolds is a tragic one of a family caught helplessly between the world of the forest and the outside world that rejects them. But it is also a story of redemption inspired by the children, especially Ambi, who attends school for the first time.
