NOTES:

sOURCE:
Well the video was nice,but looked washed out,had whacked AR and as property of text across the bottom throughout.
The audio was nice but too me was too over powering IMHO.

Workdone:
Opted to crop the text,changed the brightness,contrast and chroma levels....also used a HQ smoother and finally added
some sharpness back to it,oh and fixed the AR issue.
Audio i just lowerd the DBs so it wasn't too powerful.
