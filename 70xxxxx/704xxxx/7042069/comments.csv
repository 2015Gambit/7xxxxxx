,Magic_friendly,2012-07-27T07:24Z,"Can you guys please seed? Of course the updates and DLC are not needed, but I would love to have them! =D Hey Scene4all I have a question man, Is it possible to get Scott Pilgrim vs. The World on pc even though they don't have it? Or what about Castlevania HD and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix? Just thought I'd ask. "
,Magic_friendly,2012-07-27T07:30Z,"Was browsing XBL arcade and indie games and searching for them, thought I'd get some more and found this game again. I tried the demo before and liked it, but didn't know about this site before either. 
I know some people may know how to move the games over themselves, it's all in the coding."
