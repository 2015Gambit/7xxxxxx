Probably a webrip or something.

This looks like something that was originally really low resolution and really low bitrate, and then just scaled up, and encoded really poorly at higher bitrate.

It's pixelated, blurry and full of artifacts.

It has blurred areas, so most likely it does have a watermark, but it was just blurred out. Therefore, the torrent name is fake.

The quality fits more with a file with a quarter of the size.

It's watchable, but that's it."

As a thriller movie i give it an 8 out 10
a-10
v-8
some blurring, but very watchable "
