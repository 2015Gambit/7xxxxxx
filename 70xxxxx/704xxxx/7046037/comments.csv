,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-20T18:32Z,@middyman. I get no pop-ups when i use the Chrome browser with AdBlock extention. Just try and you'll be happy.
[T],webmodelsindex,2012-02-20T19:32Z,"@middyman

Same as DM, I use Chrome with AdBlock. I do get a single pop up when I come to the site, but once sessions kick in, I don't get anymore. Maybe it's a logged in feature to not show pop ups."
,Holy Divr,2012-02-20T19:52Z,Idc what anyone say's Sandra's always going to be the best. She will be missed. And she'll always be loved by all. 
,middyman,2012-02-20T20:39Z,"@Who-He-iZ & webmodelsindex, Thanks guys I'll check my AdBlock, maybe there's a problem. I've  had no problems on other sites though and I am logged in. Again Thank You."
,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-20T21:01Z,@HolyD. I totally agree. Nobody else comes even close to Sandra. She is and will always be No. 1

I went into my settings and tried to block it . but nothing seems to stop it , any suggestions apart from using google chrome ."
[T],webmodelsindex,2012-02-21T02:37Z,"Odd. I just tried viewing this site in Firefox with AdBlock, and didn't get a single pop up.

Are you guys using the latest version of AdBlock? The version I have installed is 2.5.19 in Chrome, in Firefox I'm using version 2.0.3, neither one is allowing pop ups. Should also mention that both Chrome and Firefox are up to date."
,SD1000,2012-02-21T05:03Z,"Never had any popups on this site...... I use firefox, also with adblocker. But maybe you have some sort of malware that makes these popups occur? I've had one of those once. "
,sila11,2012-02-21T11:33Z,"fault3 broke the user terms set out by TPB by uploading content that sexualised and exploited minors, good on TPB for sticking to their standards and stopping the spread of such content, and also for taking notice of those of us who reported the torrents."
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-02-21T16:00Z,"I FINALLY FIXED THE POP-UPS . 
TOOLS /POPUP BLOCKER / POP-UP BLOCKER SETTINGS / BLOCKING LEVEL / SET TO HIGH - BLOCK ALL POP-UPS . 
I HAVE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS BEFORE , AND I HAVE READ IN A LOT OF COMMENTS FROM OTHER USERS THAT THIS IS JUST A RECENT PROBLEM , AND IT IS ALWAYS 888.COM CASINO THAT POPS UP IN THE BACKGROUND . 
HOPEFULLY TPB WILL GET THIS STOPPED SOON ."
