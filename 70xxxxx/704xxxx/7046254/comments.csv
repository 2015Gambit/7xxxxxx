,Assassinprofessor,2012-02-20T17:43Z,is it playable with FF XIII-2 patch?
[V],boobsman,2012-02-20T18:25Z,"@ Assassinprofessor however you've been burning the other xgd3 iso's is how you should burn this one, if you've used the downgrader for your other games then use it for this :)"
,Assassinprofessor,2012-02-20T22:24Z,thnx boobsman..as i can see i'll report you after 44 weeks..thats the time i need to download this game ...cool
,onlyforgames,2012-02-20T22:30Z,"hi, i have a stupid question. i have LT 2.0 on my xbox. what should i do to play this iso? must i patch it or something? thx"
[V],boobsman,2012-02-21T02:28Z,"@ Assassinprofessor, it'll speed up, too many people trying to download n not seeding back at the moment, this is always they way :(

@ onlyforgames, it depends what drive you have n if its effected by the latest updates n topology? Make a copy of the iso and try the downgrader i uploaded for FF13-2, it so far has worked on all LT3.0 games n downgrades them to work on LT2.0.

,meatypete78,2012-02-23T01:09Z,Thanks Boobsman you rock ;)
,abernick00,2012-02-23T02:28Z,"again,,, all you ppl complaining about download speeds....  GET NEW GEAR. i have said it 50 times.   i have basic cable internet, with a linksys E4200, a killer comp, i7 2600k processor, 32 gb RAM, TWO Nvidia 560ti OC edition vid cards, KILLER ASUS board, and i get these games RIGHT when they come out in under an hour.  
      USE peerblocker! there are IP's out there used to slow us down. if your system is out of date, and you are using mommy and daddys computer or a laptop to download these games, you are slowing EVERYONE down, so stop complaining!!  

boobsman works hard to supply you unappreciative f**ks with games that are usually not even released yet,,,,    if you want to get the games faster, spend the money you are NOT giving the developers on some new gear.... It WILL make a difference!  I'm trying to give advice, because i have no problems.... 

      I do networking for a living,,, if your computer cannot handle the incoming data, it will slow you down....  build a gaming comp!  and stop your complaining,,,, boobsman, you rule, as usual....      
@exndo 
    YOU ARE AN IDIOT.    no, you CANNOT play xbox games on your pc, not even mine.... someday maybe???  but are you kidding???? are you reading the problems people are asking about???? do you think they would go through allllll that trouble if they could just play it on their PC's????  jeeeeezus, they REALLY need to start membership and weed out some people...."
,Smallz94,2012-02-23T04:08Z,thanks  it took a day or less to download this  thanks!!!
,Smallz94,2012-02-23T05:44Z,IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Crinson12,2012-02-23T08:01Z,Nice torrent tried yesterday fully working with xbox backup creator and topology data thanks boobsman
,Crinson12,2012-02-23T08:02Z,Can some one upload naruto shippuden uns generation jpn ???
,lrv2012,2012-02-23T14:35Z,"Hi Everyone! 
I am currently running LT+2.0 and I believe that I am on a BenQ drive. If I patch this iso using the ff13-2 patcher that boobsman uploaded, would I be able to run it without updating to 3.0?
Or would that only work on Samsung/Hitachi?

Also, would I need to update my dash? I have not done so since early december I think. Can I do so directly from this disc?

Sorry if this has been answered before. I've been reading around and gotten even more confused!

thx in advance
- Lucy"

,narsil360,2012-02-25T15:08Z,"I have updated to LT 3.0 yesterday, but am having problems with burning XGD3 games, they all stop at 50% when burning. I get this pop-up window saying there's been an error with the sectors.

I have tried setting layerbreak to ""Calculate optimal"", as well as User specified: 2086912 in ImgBurn (latest one) but no luck. 

Note that I don't have an IHas burner, just a regular laptop DVD burner. 

Does anybody know what to do? I wanna make sure that I need the IHas burner 100% for burning before buying it (I read somewhere that this - with an IHas burner - is the only to burn XGD3 games for LT 3.0..). Obviously, Id like to continue burning with my current burner. "
,homdawg,2012-02-26T22:12Z,"BOOBSMAN,
DOES THIS HAVE DASH UPDATE IN IT..
I HAVE LT 2.0 WITH DASH 13599..
I HAVE READ THAT IF U UPDATE FROM DASH 13599 OT 13604 IT DOES NOT TURN UR DRIVE INTO STOCK...
THANX..!!!"
,17chand,2012-02-28T07:43Z,"Hi!
Can someone help me pls.
I have burned the game with no problems.
I can se the intro, but the game stoppes at the loading schene, when the game shall start, and the loading never ends. Whats wrong with the game? "

,homdawg,2012-02-29T17:57Z,"i never joined xbox live..too.

,Assassinprofessor,2012-03-01T18:56Z,"@homdawg
you are using the wrong dash number, set on optimal 2133520..
to play this game you also need FFXIII-2 topology...I confirm it works like a charm, as all boobsman's torents :)"
,homdawg,2012-03-01T20:13Z,"@Assassinprofessor
i did set it calculate optimal
how will i update my dash..
and how do u use FFXIII-2 topology.
thanx man..
really really sry for being a noob..and putin u through this!!!"

,thezys,2012-03-22T21:38Z,"Is burning with IHas Liteon necessary?
Or maybe I can use something else?"
,ykp42,2012-04-16T08:54Z,"i am having a little problem
