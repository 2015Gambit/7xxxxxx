MEDIA LOBBYIST WARNING: any action you take against The Pirate Bay will be harming our ability to freely distribute our uncopywrighted music and side-step your evil industry. You will be liable for repairing the gapping hole in the lives of everyone who didn't get a chance to hear our music for free because of your actions. Stop fighting it and find a better way to monetise the new era of innovation in media distribution or go fuck yourselves."
