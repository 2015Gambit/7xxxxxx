From the eastern peopleâ€™s primeval shadows theater of until the modern greek folk shadows theater, the historical course is seeded with assumptions and legends that are spread from word of mouth and from generation to generation. The programme follows the evolution, presents the characters of â€œberdesâ€ and introduces to us the craftsmen who marked the history of the modern greek shadows theater. History and tradition get tangled with extracts from contemporary theater performances and the figures of Karagiozis obtain life and shape in the hands of children.
Karagiozis is a poor hunchbacked Greek, his right hand is always depicted long, his clothes are ragged and patched, and his feet are always bare. He lives in a poor cottage (Greek: Ï€Î±ÏÎ¬Î³ÎºÎ±) with his wife Aglaia and his three sons, during the times of the Ottoman Empire. The scene is occupied by his cottage in the left, and the Sultan's Palace (Sarayi) on the far right.
Because of his poverty, Karagiozis uses mischievous and crude ways to find money and feed his family.
Students of folklore divide Karagiozis' tales in two major categories: the 'Heroics' and the 'Comedies'. The Heroics are tales based on tradition or real stories involving the times under Ottoman rule, and Karagiozis is presented as a helper and assistant of an important hero.

EYGENIOS SPATHARIS
Spatharis was born Jan. 3, 1924, and followed his puppet master father, Sotirios Spatharis, into the craft.
From his first performance in 1942, he worked until the end of his life, most often as a solitary performer manipulating his puppets behind a small semitransparent screen.
He also collaborated with theatre and dance companies to expand the art form. He recorded 15 stories starting in the 1960s.
