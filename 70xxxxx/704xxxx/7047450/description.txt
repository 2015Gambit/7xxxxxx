                             The Complete Season 1


Pan Am takes you back to 1960's when the excitement of the "Jet Age" was in full swing and also the scandals and entanglements that comes with it. The series follows four women: Maggie (Christina Ricci), Kate (Kelli Garner), Colette (Karine Vanasse)and Laura (Margot Robbie), as they go to the luxury of Pan Am as Flight Attendants. With the glamor of the plans, the pilots are revered as rock stars and the stewardesses are desired by everyone. As the ladies are trained on everything related to flying, many characters come to show their support. Joining them is pilot Dean (Jonah Lotan) who is confident in his charisma and ambitions.

Created by Jack Orman (ER, JAG), "Pan Am" is an unique look into the past on one of the most famous airlines in history. With Tommy Schlamme (West Wing) on board as Director, the show shows the deep insight into what the world was like back then on board the most expensive luxurious planes.
