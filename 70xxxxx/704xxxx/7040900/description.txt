This is the ISO file of the DVD I created for my video essay "Revelation and Revolution." At present, it is only available in NTSC format -- that's the DVD format used in North America and only a few other places, not in most of the world. If there is a big demand for it, I will make a comparable DVD in some other format, but I don't expect that to happen -- the video is about worldwide revolution, but it is focused mostly on the USA, where I live. 


The entire video can be watched ata web location that can be reached more easily through the alias http://reveal-revolt.org. Watching it there will be easier and quicker than downloading the ISO. But if you've watched it and you find it terribly inspiring, you might want to then download the ISO, so that you can put copies of it onto DVDs and given them to people who don't have a good internet connection.

By the way, there is a text (html) version of the essay atThe text version is embedded with many links to related articles and videos by other people.

Peace, love, and revolution. - Eric
