,shooty1976,2012-02-29T22:06Z,"Bongojiing, as much as I admire your torrents and the effort of putting them up, IMDB does NOT tell people what languages are on any given DVD, and features may change from region to region. It's generally taken as courteous when posting a DVD to list the audio and subtitle languages. 

Thanks."
