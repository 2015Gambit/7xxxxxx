The only up of episode 5 on the Bay.
Thanks also for the BAFTA files.

,blondie2,2012-04-07T03:01Z,Thank you so much! I have been waiting for this!
,blondie2,2012-04-08T02:27Z,This isn't working for me.
,MojoMouse,2012-09-17T13:21Z,"Thank you for the upload, but this file doesn't seem to work. It's a hdtv.xvid-tla.rar file. I use VLC media player, which plays most files.

Is there a workaround that someone knows of? I love this series, and would like to see this episode before I watch the last one."
