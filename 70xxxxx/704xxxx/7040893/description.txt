In a unique approach to supporting charity, filmmakers Peter Furst and Garnet Mae have produced a parody/satire of Quentin Tarantino\\\\\\\'s cult classic Reservoir Dogs, with the twist that the male dominated cast is replaced with women. This is the first feature film ever produced solely to raise awareness and money for charity, with all cast, crew and supporters providing their time and goods for free.

Our aim is to raise $1,000,000 for breast cancer research and support by asking all those that watch the film and enjoy it to generously support the cause. Payments as little as $1 will all help and can be easily made using paypal or credit card via the website.
