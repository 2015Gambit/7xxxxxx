<b>Dead Buddhas - God is not the author of stupidity</b>
Our 'God is not the author of stupidity' album  is more like a catalog of unfinished potential that never went past concept stages, it was written during a time when Dead Buddhas was in a musically different direction. The songs on 'God is not the author of stupidity' date back to 2006, I compiled the best of those compositions, packed and wrapped them in this nifty little album.  

Help us out by downloading the album/songs or purchasing yourself a copy of the album/songs. By purchasing our 'God is not the author of stupidity' album, it would contribute funding towards the studio production of our unnamed album we are currently working on. In the meantime, we hope the music provided is suffice.
