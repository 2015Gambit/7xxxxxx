,pierobon,2012-07-11T19:17Z,"Video quality suggest good DVD upscaled rip instead of blu ray.
Also, audio and video sync issues after disc layer transition.
I would give maybe 6 or 7 rating."

I am sorry but can somebody with knowledge and XP please HELP ME????

I am trying to convert this MPEG4 video to DVD with ENG subs via ""AVS video converter"", I can convert the video alone but when I try to include the subs I cannot, I am guessing cuz there are in SUB and IDX format????

What can I do to convert this video with subs to a DVD???? HELP...

Sorry for being annoying, but, THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!!!!!!!"
