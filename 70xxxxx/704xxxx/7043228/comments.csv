,kankur,2012-02-19T15:30Z,Is there any trick to do the same thing using usb?
[V],Slickinator,2012-02-20T00:08Z,"and if in need i did add the serial txt on too the disc as some windows requir you to register it so explore the boot disc after and u will see it....

works with all windows"
[V],Slickinator,2012-02-20T01:11Z,"if you get a copy of

Password Recovery Bundle 2012 Portable


it will do a usb one also"
,pelikan947,2012-03-08T13:40Z,"This worked perfect for me on windows vista home premium. wrote the iso to cd with nero,  booted from it and the program found the windows user account names. you need to select options > about and enter the user/pass details then it happily removed the passwords, even from the administrator account.

user : Koma
pass : 94659-VOFVS-I5FFZ-BS055

thanks slickinator."

,woodywade2,2012-06-25T03:34Z,"This is the exact same file as the torrent before this, only it doesn't do USB. 
And if you have a newer computer than apparently these people have, it won't work.
I tried it on Windows 7 PE."
