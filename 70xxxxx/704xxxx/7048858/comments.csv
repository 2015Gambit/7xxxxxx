Is it possible to search for a book called ""Aloha Magnum ""?
It is written by actor Larry Manetti and it is about  his time on Magnum P.I. and anecdotes about fellow cast members and celebrities such as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, and Michelle Pfeiffer.
I know its probably diffult to find but if you can, make a ""quick"" search.
Thank you."
