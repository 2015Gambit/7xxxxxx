Great upload; fantastic quality and works perfectly. Should I block with Little Snitch or not though?
Also, if you have iOS devices try using them as remote controls!"

,Fair_Feedback,2012-06-21T03:21Z,"It won't let me use this application with the OS version I have on my Mac. I'm currently using version 10.5.8 and this version of this application does not work with OS version 10.5.8

NOTE: TO SAVE TIME AND DOWNLOAD SPACE, THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT WORK ON VERSION 10.5.8 OF MAC OSX."
,gamer1996,2012-06-23T17:15Z,"@ Fair Feedback
The reason it doesn't work on you 10.5.8 operating system is because leopard doesn't have the mac app store. you must have 10.6.8 or higher to have this to work"
