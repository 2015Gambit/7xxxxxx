,Kooblukhan,2012-02-23T03:41Z,"uh protected?  I seriously doubt that ol frogs would up something like that, I'll download now and confirm but I assume there is no DRM of any kind."
,thenoobest1,2012-02-23T04:39Z,Is this 5.1 448kbps better than a bitrate with 640kbps?

,oddgirl8,2012-02-24T19:35Z,Cinavia is a watermark on the audio it mutes the sound on PS3 and some Sony Bluray players
