Let's Go is the second studio album by the American punk rock band Rancid. It was released on June 14, 1994 through Epitaph Records and was the band's first album to feature Lars Frederiksen on guitar. 

The album initially achieved little mainstream success, though it appealed to the band's fanbase. However, the surprise success of punk rock bands such as The Offspring, Green Day and Bad Religion in the mid-1990s brought forth more mainstream interest in Let's Go, and it peaked at number 97 on the Billboard 200.

Until the band's fifth album Rancid (2000), Let's Go was the only Rancid album to be produced by Brett Gurewitz, although he engineered the band's third studio album, ...And Out Come the Wolves (1995).
