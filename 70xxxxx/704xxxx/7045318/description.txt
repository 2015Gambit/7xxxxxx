                Franky is in a bad place - it's the week of her mock
                exams and she's unable to concentrate on her studies.
                Her friends are avoiding her, parental support makes
                her feel smothered and in her isolation she feels
                propelled towards Luke. He's bad news, but he feels
                as if he's the only person who understands her and
                she's intoxicated by him. Drawn into Luke's dangerous
                world, she finds an outlet for her anger and
                frustration. Burning bridges with family and friends,
                Franky is in more trouble than ever before. But help
                comes in unlikely forms, and out of the darkness a
                new friendship is born.
