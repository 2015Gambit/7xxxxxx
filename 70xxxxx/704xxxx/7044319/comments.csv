,macomaniac,2012-02-23T10:05Z,"Thanks, Polisdavid. Once burnt to a DVD, DiskWarrior boots quietly. Speaking of 'quietly', I mean you get a chance to experiencing Satori, too, from contemplating the many turns of the spinning wheel (lol)..."
,ustink,2012-02-23T15:58Z,"Thanks for this.
Looking for Remote Buddy 1.2?  Seems to be hard to find?"

,counterivan1,2012-08-09T06:26Z,"Hello, I just wanna say thank you so much for this. Here is what I did: I downloaded this and then burnt it into a dvd in my laptop with windows cause I dont have another Mac. Then i putted it in and pressed c till the apple logo came up. It booted. Then I copied the image I had in the dvd to my desktop and ejected the dvd. With disk utility I burnt it into a new dvd , and NOW IT'S BOOTABLE. Then you have to restart, press c, and the application will appear, just follow the steps in the burn it word file . Hope I helped and sorry for my bad english."
,irishboyo,2012-08-15T17:58Z,"Doesn't work for me. Took about an hour to boot up and it came to the screen where there is a software agreement confirmation box from Alsoft. However I then got the spinning beach ball of death which I could not escape out of so I could not click on the ""agree"" button. I waited another hour for the spinning beach ball to stop but it never did. I had to force reboot.

Anyone have any workarounds to get this working? If you buy the CD from Alsoft does it have the same problem or is this just a bad disc image?"
