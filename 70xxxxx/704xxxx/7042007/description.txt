Description: 
Phil Agland revisits the Baka Pygmy family he filmed 25 
years ago in his BAFTA award winning documentary '
Baka: People of the Rainforest'. An extraordinary journey 
into the heart of the rainforest in Cameroon, where the 
past of the Baka revisits them through watching the old 
film projected in the forest - raising questions about their 
old life in the forest and what is happening to them now. 
One generation later, the children of the old film are now 
parents. Camera, who was born at the end of the first film 
and named after Phil's film camera, now has a gorgeous 
seven year old daughter, Ambi. Camera's brother Ali, who 
wanted his baby sister thrown away in the original film, 
also has a young daughter, but tragically she is disabled. 
Watching themselves for the first time on film, seeing how 
their parents used to live, prompts laughter, amazement 
and a profound sense of loss. Leading ultimately to an 
epic journey deep into the forest to rediscover the old life 
of their fathers, and a quest to find the magical 'Elephant's 
Mirror', an almost mythical place where, their fathers had told 
them, the elephants go to admire their tusks.
This is a tragic story of alcohol addiction, and the death of 
little children, of a family caught helplessly between the 
world of the forest and the outside world that rejects them. 
But it is also a story of redemption inspired by the old film 
and a lifeline to the future offered by the children, 
especially Camera's daughter, Ambi, who attends school 
for the first time.
