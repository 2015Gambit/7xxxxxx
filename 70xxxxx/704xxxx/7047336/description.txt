As a matter of fact, BTNRip (Better Than Nothing). The only source I could find was a YouTube video. It's above average for YT and with some manipulations pretty watchable (everyone can try and get better results!), but has three or four 1-2 second gaps. So the upgrades are welcome.



A poor boy rises to power in politics. When the banker husband of his secret love takes money and flees the country, he replaces the lost amount and becomes implicated in the crime.
