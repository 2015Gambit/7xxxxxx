[V],globeplus,2012-02-19T09:05Z,"This is a movie file not game file and the link you refered (paritdada) is really lost , i don´t have how to put him back because i don´t even know the exact conteud , they are lot of sites with the mgpload problem , needing to many reuploads or simply too much work probably for nothing , play as you get it ."

[V],globeplus,2012-02-19T12:38Z,"To paritdada : how i am suppose to know just by the link the conteud of the file ? as you forgot that i can´t acceed the mgpload files anymore and maybe was already deleted because that link probably was available for more than one year , so the chances to know the conteud is 0 , ok ? sorry but play as you have the file ."
