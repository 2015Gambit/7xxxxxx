Thank you very much, work like a magic for me.

There are 2 points I want to confirm:
- When I installed this package for the first time, my windows 7 x64 is already activated. It is written in the system properties that my windows is activated and there was a ""Get Genuine Microsoft Software"" Icon. Then I execute the RemoveWat and then the ""Your windows is activated"" message and ""Get Genuine Microsoft Software"" icon disappeared from the system properties. Is this OK?

-Yesterday I updated to SP1 and the  ""Your windows is activated"" message and ""Get Genuine Microsoft Software"" icon shown again in the system properties. Should I execute the remove WAT again?

I never, never got a message about my Windows is invalid or something... I just confused, why I didn't get any warning.

if you didn't back everything you needed up, before installing a new OS, you are a fool sorry to say. you might be lucky, if you have seperate partitions or seperate drives, that your information might be stored on one of the extra drives (not your C drive), because when installing a new os, generally it wipes your c drive in the process, leaving the other drives as they were."

Help?"
,Zellogi,2012-05-05T20:05Z,"@murph263
If you used Windows Explorer to burn the ISO to a DVD, you did it wrong. You gotta download a program that burns it to a DVD, because an ISO is basically a CD Image, and there are programs that can extract that image and produce files, which a computer with no OS can read. 

I stupidly tried the above (Thank god I had a RW DVD) and found out that it wouldn't work that way. A friend told me that I needed a program to  burn the ISO file to the disk so it would actually create files that a blank empty computer could read.

If that wasn't the problem, then try re-burning it. Sometimes it misses a file or two, and re-burning it could help. Worth a shot if you still have the ISO.

If not, Google is your friend. :D lol don't know anything else to suggest."

,Tenshi24,2012-06-03T00:02Z,"@UnderworldDemon666
Some questions before i proceed to formatting my PC:

1. does this require CD key?
2. is it ok to leave auto updates off for the rest of teh pc's life? or is it ok to update and update and just rerun RemoveWAT everytime i get a ""not genuine"" message?

thnks for teh torrent btw. more cracking powers may be bestowed upon you! :D"
,UnderworldDemon666,2012-06-03T03:50Z,"@Tenshi24: The ""RemoveWAT.exe"" takes care of the need for the CD key. When you first install it, if you check it, it says that it has a CD key already activated, but once you do most of the updates, especially the WAT update (KB971033). You can leave updates off, but in all seriousness, it's good to have the updates on with as many viruses as Windows operating systems get, and the way Microsoft patches security holes with the updates, it's a good idea to have them on.

@dinggggg: Not sure what specs your MBP is, but if it supports 64-bit, and you have over 4gb of RAM, then it should install and work. I've bootcamped a few other peoples computer, so I know the process, but I would stick with the 32-bit anyways."

I was able to burn the image file to disk...since I had XP I had to do a Custom Install, which was the 32 bit version--it went smoothly until the first restart, then the MBP ejected the disk. I tried reinserting it, and it seemed to work, but the program froze about 2/3 into the final install step. I rebooted from my original XP partition (as the Startup Disk), and it picked right up where it left off.

Also, I didn't need to copy anything into my Windows folder or really do anything to activate it...I've since received over 300 GB of updates, no problem. It's listed as a Genuine copy, so I suppose all is good.

After the installation you'll need your OS X install disk to get the iSight camera, etc. to work. Insert the disk, find the Boot Camp folder, open it and click on Setup. After that it's pretty much automatic.

,heysup2009,2012-07-25T11:52Z,"I made an account just so I could post on this torrent. It was very easy to install this on my Macbook Pro without using Bootcamp (must faster and easier imo).

1.) Download this torrent
2.) Open Disk Utility and partition your internal hard drive to OSX and Windows partitions (make sure you give your Windows partition at least 30+ GB, doesn't really matter what you partition it as since you will have to format it during the installation).
3.) Burn image (the iso you just downloaded) WITHIN Disk Utility (Don't just right-click --> burn) to a CD or DVD.
4.) Open Bootcamp and only choose to install drivers to CD or DVD (or Bootcamp support, w/e it's called).
5.) Restart your computer and when it's black/loading up hold down the alt/option key.
6.) Put in your DVD that you just burned your Windows iso on.
7.) Choose to load from that.
8.) Follow Windows installer until you get to which partition it wants you to install.
9.) choose the partition that you just made and it will say ""unable to..."" or something like that. Go to edit, and then format. It will tell you that it will erase everything but that doesn't matter since it's clean and we just made it. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORMAT YOUR OSX partition (you will lose everything)
10.) Hit next after it's formatted properly.
11.) Wait for it to install and boot up.
12.) Insert your CD or DVD where you burned your ""Bootcamp Support"" or Bootcamp Drivers or whatever, and run setup.exe
13.) After that's done, you have a perfectly working Windows OS on your Apple device that has all the drivers set up (bluetooth, wireless, etc!).

I'm not sure if you have said so or not, I believe I have read differently. I downloaded your torrent, she runs perfect! I ran the RemoveWAT like I was told to do. Question though, I cant run it after its been installed on the pc. Would I have to uninstall it, then just re install from the disc to do so? I ask, because i got the windows isnt genuine (took it a week to notice) I tried to run RemoveWAT again, said that I couldnt due to it being some virus or something.  So I went to put the disk in and accidently reset the pc. It came on, the keyboard wasnt recognized, and the wireless woudlnt work. after a few seconds the keyboard came back on, and i pulled the wirless adapter out and put it back in, no issues after that. No message either. I never ran the removeWAT a second time. 

What im asking is, does it only need to be ran one time? Or does it need to be ran multiple times, if so, how do i do that without doing it from my disk?

,bazpaul,2012-08-28T17:55Z,"I found a fix for the windows 7 (KB971033) update problem.

Here is what I did:

1. Go into windows updates and uninstall the KB971033 update. (google how to do this)
2. restart computer
3. Put in the windows 7 CD you made from this torrent
4. copy the ""REMOVEWAT/REMOVEWAT.EXE"" file from the disk to your C:Windows folder, and run it.
5. Select ""Remove WAT"", and your computer will restart.

The activation should disappear. I recommend changing your updates to let you choose what updates can be installed."

I used the WAT remover after I installed windows, and everything worked fine untill 2 days later windows updated to the newer servis pack and I got the message. 

Easy fix:

Just run the WATremover again, and pick 'restore WAT' and let your system restart. 
Now just run it again and re-remove the new WAT and after this restart your system should be back to normal and be 'genuine' again with the new servis pack.

wd 1.5 tb hdd

I got windows to install, and update. I used removewat after update, and sacrificed an older hdd and used removewat before installing updates.  Same problems on both.
After powering down the HDD was not longer detected (not bios, or windows).
I tried connecting it to another windows 7 desktop and it wasn't recognized either.

Any tips?

,Denivish,2012-09-18T17:35Z,"Alright I had huge problems with installing this and I could really use some advice.

First of all I couldn't get the install working for many hours. I was getting slammed with a BSOD saying ""The BIOs in this system is not fully ACPI compliant..."" After countless different tries I managed to get the damned thing working after removing one of my memory sticks. 

Note that it is not the RAM that is faulty here, nor the slots. I tested every possible combination of RAM and order, and the installation ONLY WORKED when one was inserted in either slot. 

So I install the OS, relieved that it was at least working.. and now I'm unable to launch this fucking thing with more than one memory stick inserted. I just get the BSOD again. Cool, I love having 2GB of RAM. What gives? Anybody?


Another problem: I've tried twice now to install this OS and both times I've chosen ""x64"". However when I open my HD in explorer and check the folders, it says x86. What the actual fuck? 

Please help me out here. Thanks."
