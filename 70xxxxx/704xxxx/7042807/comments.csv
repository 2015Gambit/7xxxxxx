[T],warriorph,2012-03-22T04:58Z,"@azunal: don't know what your problem is, but it plays on all the media players you mentioned with the right codecs. maybe you're just preventing others to d/l my uploads because you posted the same comment on most of my uploads. respect to all p2p groups & encoders!"
[T],warriorph,2012-03-22T09:05Z,U can try installing Combined Community Codec Pack. All my ups play perfectly in my vlc media player & wd tv live hub stand-alone hd media player.
,tadhana06,2012-03-25T08:27Z,"Pre astig mga torrents mo. Kaso MKV format e. Sana lang divx para pede sa ordinary dvd player. please.
a10 - v10
thanks"
[T],warriorph,2012-03-25T13:41Z,"@tadhana06: sorry about that. the reason I switch to x264/mkv is because of my stand-alone hd media player & hdtv. the quality of x264 codec is much better than xvid/avi on a bigger screen hdtv. and can produce good quality picture in small bitrate or file size. if will encode xvid/avi, i need to encode again to x264/mkv for my own collection & i don't have that time because of my work. i can only do that if i don't have work or on a vacation. maybe sometimes i will use xvid/avi, but the filesize will be 1gb to 1.4gb to get a good quality for a large screen hdtv."
,vinvinroxas,2012-05-01T04:21Z,salamat!!
