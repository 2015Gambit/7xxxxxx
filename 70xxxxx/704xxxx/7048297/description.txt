By "Yugoslavian for tourists" a young boy makes contact with a woman who became mentally ill then. She misunderstands his words so that she will get her son back if she will bake bread. Meanwhile the men steal and slaughter a pig. Then the women throw their car down a mountain-side. On the next day the choir and the women reconcile.
