It actually took over three hours to get through it all! Didn't matter the media player or device for me. I give the sound 6 and video 4.5-5. Side note for those that were hoping for a clash of the titans prequel or sequel, its not. I hope others have better luck! Probly would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't for the sound screwing up..."
