DC-3 Legends of Flight Expansion Pack Thanks in Advance"
,geoorge83,2012-02-23T16:14Z,"The crack is not working
Thank in advance for fixing thisproblem!"
,will_goodfellow,2012-02-23T22:34Z,"Thanks very much for this (as per my request?), tested for a couple of days and it is working.

1. Install MCE from setup.zip to chosen folder, i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\Multi Crew Experience\

2. Paste the entire'LAUNCHER' folder from MCEL.rar into the above folder (or your equivalent istallation folder). DO NOT PASTE THE CONTENTS OF THE 'LAUNCHER'FOLDER AND OVERWRITE FILES.

3. Run program using MCE-Launcher.exe in the 'LAUNCHER' folder (*NOT mce.exe).i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\Multi Crew Experience\LAUNCHER\MCE-Launcher.exe'

'Terminate Trial Timer' will run (perhaps giving false positive) and will then launch MCE. 

4. Check time-trial is infinite in 'About' drop-down menu in MCE ('Runs left' and 'Days left' will not tick down)

5. All of above info is in MCEL.rar>README_EN.txt (and README_DE.txt). I hope I have made it a bit clearer. (Check README_EN.txt if the ticker starts to count down and follow instructions to solve.)

6. geoorge83 apologise to _SnakEye :)"
