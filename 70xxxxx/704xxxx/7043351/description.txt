Mad Dogs  is a British black comedy and psychological thriller television series created by Cris Cole that started broadcast on Sky1 on 10 February 2011.

Max Beesley (Bodies), Philip Glenister (Ashes to Ashes), John Simm (Skellig) and Marc Warren (Hustle) are out of their depths in this surreal psychological thriller that will keep you on your toes.

Woody (Beesley), Quinn (Glenister), Baxter (Simm) and Rick (Warren) have been friends since sixth form. The fifth member of their gang is Alvo (Ben Chaplin, Dorian Gray), a risk-taking opportunist who, having made his fortune in property, leads a luxurious lifestyle in Majorca.

Now in their 40s, they've all taken different paths in life with varying degrees of success. When Alvo flies them to his extravagant villa to celebrate his early retirement, they enjoy a trip down memory lane.

However, all does not go to plan and they find themselves entangled in a web of deception and murder involving beautiful police women, large yachts, Speedos and a rather short assassin in a Tony Blair mask...
