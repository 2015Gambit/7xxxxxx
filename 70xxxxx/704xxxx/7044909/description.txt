To be involved in atrocities is a dehumanizing process for all mankind. 
The punishment of anyone should always fit his srime and no child should
be asked to open a door to check as to whether it is booby trapped as a
show of "superior genes" as they do not have any prima facie validity at
exactly such a moment. It has an effect on the mind which is to cause insanity
towards ALL children and if you cannot understand that, you aren't playing with a "full deck".

Much to learn from the lessons of wwii - most particularly - how to pick what is
good and bad in both barrels of apples that were involved (on both sides that is)
as no nation has perfect peoples in all of their citizens, and to pick one group
when there is just as much of an argument that it is statistically just as
reasonable on grades of willingness to show humanity as the larger group is
in fact an act of sheer stupidity and barbaric madness that is still destroying
us today hat want to put the past behind us in a way that will allow for the best 
spirit to survive and to reign once more free of guilt from all this - as the
best people could never have been guilty in their hearts of anything evil - if 
they just look at it straight enough to bring perspective to bear. Not everyone
was Hitler and ultimately he was the bastard that all need to bury forever - 
as the villain to all he pretended to be fair to, or openly victimized as he did.

May god restore the Christian Irish spirit to its rightful place as what will now define Germany Sweden Italy and elsewhere as the best way forward - leaving all
other ideas of "supremacist" in the trash where they belong.

Amen
