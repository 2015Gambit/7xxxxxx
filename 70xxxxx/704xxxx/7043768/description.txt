From BBC Radio 4 Extra. Written by P.D. James; Full-cast dramatisation starring Richard Derrington as Adam Dalgliesh, Deborah McAndrew as Kate Miskin and with Carolyn Pickles as Emma Lavenham.

In the seventeenth century, a witch is burned in a stone circle. Three hundred and fifty years later, an investigative journalist arrives at a nearby clinic to have cosmetic surgery - and a week later, she is dead.

Dalgliesh and his team, called in to investigate the murder and later a second equally horrific death, find themselves confronted with problems even more complicated than the question of innocence or guilt.
