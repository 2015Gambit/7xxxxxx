So I was looking here on TPB and I find that quite a few things I have on vinyl aren't available in digital format.

Not on iTunes, not on Amazon, not on CD at all either.

So I will share some of them here as time allows.

Vinyl rip using:
Technics 1200
Stanton 680 cartridge
Rane SL2 for phono preamp.

Recorded in ProTools 8 at 24-bit / 96khz using Digi002 Rack

Bounced to disk as 16-bit 44.1k WAV
for your convenience.
