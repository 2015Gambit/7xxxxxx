Yoruichi knocks Ichigo unconscious when he refuses to leave, and manages to escape Byakuya with Ichigo. After Ichigo regains consciousness, Yoruichi begins to train him to use his Bankai, the most powerful form of ZanpakutÅ. Renji later joins to train with them as well, bringing news that Rukia's execution date has again changed. Meanwhile, UryÅ« and Orihime are confronted by Shinigami captain Mayuri Kurotsuchi. UryÅ« battles him but is quickly disabled by the Shikai of Mayuri's ZanpakutÅ. Even after UryÅ« overcomes this with the Quincy technique RansÅtengai, Mayuri is still too much for UryÅ«, who is forced to remove his Sanrei Glove. UryÅ« then completely overwhelms Mayuri, even after Mayuri uses his Bankai, but is unable to finish him, as Mayuri escapes by turning himself into a liquid.
 
Meanwhile, Shinigami officers are fighting throughout Seireitei. Shinigami captain TÅshirÅ Hitsugaya confronts fellow captain Gin Ichimaru, whom Hitsugaya believes killed Aizen, and battles him. Ichimaru retreats after lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto arrives. The next day, Kenpachi rescues Ichigo's comrades, but is stopped by Shinigami captains Sajin Komamura and Kaname TÅsen. Kenpachi manages to defeat TÅsen, even after TÅsen uses his Bankai. Elsewhere, Renji attempts to rescue Rukia, but is stopped by Byakuya. Renji, despite using his newly acquired Bankai, is defeated by Byakuya. Finally, Rukia's execution begins, but she is saved by Ichigo and sympathetic captains Shunsui KyÅraku and JÅ«shirÅ Ukitake.
 
While Rukia is spirited away by Renji, numerous Shinigami officers start to battle each other. Ichigo defeats three lieutenants that were pursuing Renji and is then engaged by Byakuya. Ichigo was about to die in the battle but his Hollow self takes control of him and attacks Byakuya with more powerful attacks. Ichigo then manages to retake control of himself in the battle. Using his Bankai, Ichigo manages to battle Byakuya on even footing, and narrowly defeats him. KyÅraku and Ukitake flee the execution area for a more secluded place to battle Captain-Commander GenryÅ«sai Shigekuni Yamamoto. Yamamoto incinerates the surrounding area with his Shikai, and begins to battle his former students. Captain SuÃ¬-FÄ“ng is similarly accosted by Yoruichi, her former mentor. In a tearful encounter, Yoruichi defeats her using the ShunkÅ technique, but was underestimated earlier because of her avoidance of battle for many years.
 
Hitsugaya, while searching the Central 46 Chambers, discovers that Aizen is alive, and is the mastermind behind the events that have transpired in Soul Society. Aizen then effortlessly defeats Hitsugaya and travels to the execution area. As Rukia has been sent there by TÅsen, Aizen's accomplice, Aizen extracts the HÅgyoku from her, despite the efforts of Renji, Ichigo and Captain Komamura. However, before Aizen can flee, the entire officer corps of the Gotei 13 stops him. However, the arrival of several Menos Grande enable Aizen and his accomplices to escape to Hueco Mundo. Ichigo and his friends then return to the real world, leaving Rukia behind on her request.
