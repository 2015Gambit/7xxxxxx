,ReconRedneck2,2012-02-21T19:19Z,"Due to the watermark text being very fine the blur on this video has worked out very well.  Video looks good a solid 8 but the audio is a bit crackly most notable at the beginning, a 5. So far this is the release that is worth downloading in my opinion.  I thought this movie was very creepy & well done definitely download this if you enjoy a good haunted house film!"
