Just a few segments clipped from this show:

John Stossel

- examines the gov't budget, with 8 or 9 zeros lopped off so as to be presented like a typical lower-middle-class home budget.

Judge Andrew Napolitano

- examines how Greece's profligacy has reduced its autonomy, with a plan for imported eurocrats representing creditors to manage the country like bankrupt business in receivership. He infers a lesson for the US.

Stuart Varney

- on how the government is subsidizing the rich with all the green energy incentives. After all, who's going to buy the green electric cars with true costs north of $100K. He explains how we're being bribed with our own money.
