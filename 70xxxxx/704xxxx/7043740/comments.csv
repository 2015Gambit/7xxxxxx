Although the screens look pretty good hopes its good as the screens!"
,HsKing,2012-02-21T17:05Z,"Definitely a great encode!

A/V:10/10

It's good as a normal DVD rip gets.

M:8.5/10 

The movie is pretty good ; to me it reminded me of the movie ""Coraline"" (which is also a great movie) because it has that same kinda feeling to it and in ways the ending is similar... I won't go on further just in case of spoilers :P anyways I highly recommend you watch this movie! If you are a fan of Coraline no doubt you like this one."
