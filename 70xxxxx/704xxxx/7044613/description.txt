:: Synopsis ::
Chilean first feature Huacho looks at first as though itâ€™s about to reiterate a familiar message: folks in the country have it tough, but roll up their sleeves and get on with it anyway. While this is pretty much the gist of Alejandro FernÃ¡ndez Almendrasâ€™s film, an unusual structure and some acute observations make this exercise in rural realism an involving, quietly rewarding experience. A labour of love in the best sense, the downbeat but accessible Huacho should overcome its obvious commercial limitations to intrigue some specialist art-house buyers, although it will find its truest audience on the festival circuit. 
Winner of the Golden Bear in 2007 for his similarly crafted short, "Along Came the Rain," Fernandez Almendras portrays a world in which even the smallest events can carry great weight for those barely scraping by. His minimalist script blends with docu-style direction that reveals the minor beauties of the rural setting, as well as the darker plight of peasants trying to survive in a ruthless market economy.
