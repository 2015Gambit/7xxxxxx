You have no idea how happy i am - i used to buy NBA on VHS from the US in the eighties... thank you so much mister!!!!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-21T02:30Z,"I'm very happy for you! I didn't realise that you are such a Boston's fan. Enjoy it, my friend! The video quality is not that good but watchable."

,jmbsc,2012-02-21T11:24Z,"and by the way, yes I love Boston but I love basket-ball more... Used to play it on county level back in the days in France... also big fan of The Bulls (Jordan and co) amongst others... Hourray for Nepotu!!"
,ivo1978,2012-02-21T11:46Z,It is interesting to see young Isiah and Bill Laimbeer against world champions - Celtics. This rivalry would continue through 80's with great tension! Thanks Nepotu!!
