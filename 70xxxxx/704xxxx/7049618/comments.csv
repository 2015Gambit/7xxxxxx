[V],Nepotu,2012-02-22T15:47Z,"@BayFarm10: U'R Welcome! El mejor Messi!
@generalbarca: Thank you for your understanting, my friend.
@Kole97: Dear friend, first I have colect Barca'games in DVDs for myself, because, it's true, I'm Barca's fan. Then I thought that would be nice to share in TPB with you. Then I started to up NBA games because nobody done it. Now, to up Chelsea's or Real's matches would be a little difficult to me. First because of my internet bandwidth, and second because of my HDD size. I'll try to help you somehow but I don't promise nothing. OK? Cheers, mate!"
