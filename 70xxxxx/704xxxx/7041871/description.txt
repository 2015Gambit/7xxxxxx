Old Mad Joy is the major label debut of The Gourds.

The Gourds are the national band of Austin. Their junkyard sound crisscrosses the roots-music spectrum with a whacked-out, independent spirit. For their 10th studio album, Old Mad Joy, the fivesome recorded in Woodstock, N.Y., relinquishing production duties to Larry Campbell, an associate of Bob Dylan and Levon Helm. What you get is vintage Gourds with a coat of polish.

"It has the best of both worlds in that we are playing with a familiar passion to our live shows, but still all the parts are clear, present and well-placed within the arrangements," said Kevin Russell, the bandâ€™s guitarist and co-singer-songwriter. "I donâ€™t know that we have ever gotten it this perfect."
One of roots music's most fervent leaders, Texas greats, The Gourds will be releasing their Vanguard Records debut, Old Mad Joy. Produced by Larry Campbell at the infamous Levon Helm Studios a.k.a. `The Barn', Old Mad Joy embraces the eccentric character and sonic range of the band while pushing their sound to the next level. Based in Austin, TX and formed in 1994, The Gourds have released ten studio records and multiple live recordings and soundtracks. In 2006, they performed in an episode of the NBC show Friday Night Lights and have been featured on PBS' Austin City Limits. The Gourds high-energy live shows and endless touring have earned them the reputation as a `must see' artist. "This record represents to me a brilliant artistic achievement that only scratches the surface of the raw talent in this band." - Larry Campbell "A no-filters blend of country (both the cosmic and classic varieties), folk, gospel, ribs (both the spare and shiny varieties), zydeco, punk, rock, and soul - for people who like everything." - No Depression
