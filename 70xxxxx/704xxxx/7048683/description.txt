The reason why I only recorded the medley (side A) is because it is the only track that is really exclusive on this LP. The rest of the songs are available on many other albums. If you want a full release of this vinyl just let me know and I'll upload it sometime in the future as I don't have much time these days.  Most of my recent torrents are recorded months ago.

Hope you like it. Enjoy!
