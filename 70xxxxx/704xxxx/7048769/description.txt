BatchPhoto - The Fastest Photo Editor

BatchPhotoâ„¢ is a powerful photo manipulation program that makes it easy to convert, resize, watermark, annotate, touch-up, apply effects, and rename hundreds of photos in a single operation. Instead of enhancing and adjusting pictures individually, BatchPhoto lets you select a group of images, define a series of edits, and apply them in a single operation!
