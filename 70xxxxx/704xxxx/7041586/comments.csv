,dlarrym1111,2012-02-29T09:41Z,"Has anyone noticed that some movies have the download this torrent in green and the magnet option to the left of that. Some other movies ONLY HAVE the MAGNET option to download. Sadly, I can't download a magnet type of torrent downloading. Anyone have any feedback on that. Its not ALL the movies, but this movie doesn't give the ""get this torrent"" option?? WHATS UP?"

,michaelrwatson,2012-03-01T10:46Z,"Hey PIRATEBAY, what the f*ck is with the missing torrent links on more and more pages? 

And what the hell is that MAGNET link above? That does NOTHING on my computer (except give me an error). 

Are you trying to get people to go to other sites for torrents? 'cause it's working....."
,FurTehLul,2012-03-01T16:14Z,"@michaelrwatson you should read the blog before ranting on about how this sucks. try getting a better PC or using the latest utorrent for you magnet links, or even try using a different browser such as google chrome.
