From Wiki:

The Grapes of Wrath are a Canadian folk rock band, who were one of Canada's most successful pop bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s before disbanding in 1992. With the band name tied up in litigation, most of the band continued to record through the 1990s as Ginger. The Grapes of Wrath briefly reunited for one album in 2000, although not with their full original lineup. This same version of the band reunited again in 2009, and the original three members reunited in July 2010. They have gone on to play several concerts in various Canadian cities, and are once again active as a group.


The Grapes of Wrath were formed in Kelowna, British Columbia in 1983 by Chris Hooper, Tom Hooper and Kevin Kane. They came up with the name for the band after looking at a movie guideâ€”nobody in the band had seen the movie or read the book. In 1984, they signed to Nettwerk, releasing a self-titled EP that year. The following year, their debut album September Bowl of Green was released.

1987's Treehouse, produced by Tom Cochrane, was the band's initial Canadian breakthrough, yielding the hit single "Peace of Mind".

Their 1989 album, Now and Again, produced by Anton Fier, was the band's most successful. The band expanded to a four-piece with the addition of keyboardist Vincent Jones. Jones would later describe working with Fier as "like pulling teeth." [1] The band's tour to support this album was also notable for its opening act, a then-emerging singer/songwriter named Sarah McLachlan.

Produced by John Leckie, These Days, released in 1991, found the band experimenting with a harder rock sound, and while it sold well and spawned the hit singles "I Am Here" and "You May Be Right", it was to be the band's last effort for almost a decade. It received the 1992 CASBY Award for Favourite Album.

Kane then split from the other members of the band, who continued to perform and record together as Ginger. In 1999, Kane and Tom Hooper, the Grapes' main songwriting team, decided to work together again, and in 2000 released Field Trip under the Grapes of Wrath name. Neither Chris Hooper nor Vincent Jones participated in the reunion. Matt Brain was enlisted as the band's drummer, though he was not an official member of the group. After the tour for this album, Hooper and Kane said that they "had taken the reunion as far as they could take it"[citation needed] and deactivated the band in 2001.

In 2009, Kane and Hooper decided to play together again, as an acoustic duo.[2] Two concerts were scheduled in Western Canada, during which they were to play all their hit songs.[3]

On July 18, 2010, the three original members performed together at the Surrey Fusion Festival in Surrey, British Columbia. It was the first time the original trio had played together since 1992.[4] Dave Genn was brought in to fill Vince Jones' place on keyboards, and a small-scale series of Canadian dates followed throughout 2010.








Field Trip (Extended Edition) 2000


Field Trip is an album by The Grapes of Wrath, released in 2000. The album marked the reunion of Kevin Kane and Tom Hooper as songwriting partners and bandmates for the first time since 1991's These Days, although they were the only two original band members to appear on the album. Session musicians filled in the remaining slots left by departing members Chris Hooper and Vincent Jones, including Pete Bourne on drums and Dave Genn on keyboards.

The album was also packaged with a bonus disc comprising new renditions of several of the band's older songs. Matt Brain drums on the bonus disc.

A video was released for the song "Black Eye".

After the tour for this album, Hooper and Kane said that they, "...had taken the reunion as far as they could take it" and decided to part ways. No further albums have been released under the Grapes of Wrath name, though the group once again reunited for live dates in 2010.
