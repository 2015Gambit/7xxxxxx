,amenz,2012-02-22T01:41Z,"This is a total fake. I used my VLC player to view the partial download and it's an episode of  DEXTER tv series.

cruel joke and possible virus! I contacted tbp! it should be removed shortly."

,Tyson212,2012-02-22T16:03Z,"Oh for fuck's sake....

THIS IS NOT FAKE!!

Knock off the bullshit already...

I used VLC to view the partial...it's the real thing...only problem is that it's incomplete. I'm stuck at 99.5%.

I may not be a mod or anything like that on here, but believe me, it's the real thing...it's just not finished. I'm downloading right now as we speak since LAST NIGHT and it's just stuck...

@VIDEOTECAWEB.....you need to fully seed this thing, because I don't wanna seed a partial file to everybody...

Thanx"
,Tyson212,2012-02-23T05:41Z,"*Update*

It IS complete....when I posted my last comment, there weren't this many seeders....now it's officially complete...

Thanx for the upload!"
,amenz,2012-02-23T06:58Z,"well... based on the last few comments, I am downloading it again. Now it's fixed. TU whoever fixed it..... but stuck yesterday @ 58.7% it WAS a DEXTER episode that was downloading before. I checked it in various ways, so I dunno. Anyway, this one is okay now and much seeding. "
