[T],promodsharma,2012-02-20T19:06Z,Unfortunately this version worked only on my Win Vista Computer. It is not compatible with my Computer running Win 7.
,DavyJones4ever,2012-07-15T07:45Z,hmmm....thx buddy. Just sampling this app and on a Win7x64 seems to work (followed instructions of course)
,jar9,2012-08-29T04:02Z,thanks works fine on win 7 64bit
[V],Kuthumi,2012-09-03T08:16Z,"This did NOT work on my new Windows 7 64 bit PC. Error message: This version designed for Windows XP/2000. If you have Windows 7 or Windows Vista then please download and install i-sound 7.0 from our site http://www.abyssmedia.com/isound7/
Looks as if only version 7.0 will work. Its interface should be orange. There is a new conspiracy in Windows 7 to block recordings from the net, but the trial version of this version 7.0 did work."
