Hey guys, I've seen a couple of torrents up saying they are Marvel Ultimate Comics Truly Complete with missing or damaged files, and as a huge fan for the imprint I wanted to create this torrent.

I've organized it in the most cohesive reading structure I could.
Also, you should check this link out. Its a great reading order for the books

Please let me know if there are any corrupt or missing files and I may re-upload as necessary.

Anyway I hope everyone enjoys it!
