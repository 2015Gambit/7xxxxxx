,Uriz3n,2012-02-20T14:57Z,"Thanks for the collection. 
Although I was surprised to find the complete Ultimate FF in the Ultimatum Folder... Most of the other series are split up (like Spider-Man and X-Men) when it comes to the big Events.
Just a thought.

Great job, though."
,Dexterosity,2012-02-20T16:33Z,"ahhh, crap. Somehow I lost a bunch of the FF during the upload. Oh, well. Let me know if anything else is missing. There's a complete ultimate FF torrent out there that's good, its where I got the files from immediately. Thats irritating though. This thing took a while to put together"
,Dexterosity,2012-02-20T16:35Z,"Actually. The files are there on the torrent I'm seeding. they just don't appear to list correctly here and on KAT. Lemme know if you got them all or not.
Also, FF is not ALL in Ultimatum. I sorted some of the issues of the ongoing series by the story arc for an easier read"

help please"
,bobspreek,2012-02-21T01:51Z,"Ooh, just when I planned to post my updated collection(old one posted as spreek), you added a nice new one. Always good to be spared work :p "

,mexico16,2012-02-21T03:35Z,I miss peter.
,Uriz3n,2012-02-21T15:27Z,"Everyone misses Peter. Nothing against Miles, but he's not Peter Parker. And while I applaud the audacity, courage and tremendous Gojones it took to actually take Peter away, I cannot help but feel that the center, the very heart of the whole Ultimate Universe has been ripped out. And we all know what happens when the center cannot hold...

On another note, I just checked, and I - apparently - was wrong. Which might cause the Universe to implode, so don't be too smug about that. According to the file structure all FF titles are pretty much where they are supposed to be, yet I am certain that when downloading the torrent and looking for them, all of the FF (1-60) where in the Ultimatum Folder. Which is weird. But still my bad. Sorry."
,Uriz3n,2012-02-21T15:34Z,"Yes, I just checked again. When I download the torrent and open it in utorrent, the file list shows in: 
""1. The Beginning"" ""Ultimate Galaktus Trilogy"" after ""Ultimate Elektra""; 
then further down in 
""3. Ultimatum"" ""Ultimate Fantastic Four"" is the first entry, starting with ""reading order"", followed by issues 1-60 + Annuals.
And yet, when I look at the actual files, it puts the whole ""Ultimate Fantastic Four"" issues in the folder: ""Ultimate Comics\1. The Beginning\Ultimate Fantastic Four\"".
Weird."
,parmex08,2012-02-22T00:11Z,"guibarros, what happened with those password protected files? Which ones are they? "
,Dexterosity,2012-02-23T05:14Z,"Weird. I'm glad it came out right in the end for ya though.
Also, yeah, what's up with the password thing? Anyone else having that problem?"
,Dexterosity,2012-02-23T06:19Z,"And I actually think while killing Peter may have been questionable I'm a huge fan of where the books are going so far.
Hell, Reed Richards is a villain who's already taken out most of Eastern Europe, a few X-men and the Hulk went into the Ultimate Celestials and Eternals cities, and Johnny Storm thinks he's a mutant.
All in all these are big, but logical steps. And they make a great read.
Miles' books are moving a little in the first arc so far though..."
,killys,2012-06-13T02:31Z,i check BT after leaving it on over the weekend to find that i've uploaded 85 GB of this :O
,Jaspenz,2012-06-17T18:42Z,"ultimate spider man comics #125 has a password protection, when i open it up on comical, i cant even upload some comics to comic zeal cause there corrupted. i dont know if it my download or just the files itself. Other then that this is a brilliant torrent. kudos. "
,Hellflare,2012-06-20T21:14Z,"Missing Ultimate Vision, not the mini series included at the back of certain issues but the full issues where she teams up with falcon. Looks like you're missing ultimate x-men 1/2 as well. Other than that it is a good collection, thanks for putting this together, saves me time looking for individual issues."
,skl_bukol0,2012-07-25T15:14Z,More seeders please! Thanks! :D 
,skl_bukol0,2012-07-29T18:17Z,"Hey, can someone please help me? I already finished on downloading it, why can't I open the file?   It seems i dont have the necessary program to open it. "
