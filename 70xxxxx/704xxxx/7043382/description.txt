DiskWarrior recovers your files including your photos, music and videos.

DiskWarrior is the safest, most technologically advanced, most powerful utility to eliminate directory damage and recover your files, folders and documents. DiskWarrior is so advanced it can even recover your data from a failing hard drive. Yet all that power is hidden behind one button.

DiskWarrior cures those cryptic errors reported by Disk Utility.

Messages from your Mac such as "Invalid node structure" and "Keys out of order" may seem mysterious or even scary but DiskWarrior fixes these problems and many, many more.

DiskWarrior uses a different approach to disk directory repair than other programs.

DiskWarrior is not a disk repair program in the conventional sense. Instead of patching the original directory, it uses a patent-pending technology to quickly build a new replacement directory using data recovered from the original directory, thereby recovering files, folders and documents that you thought were lost and that no other program could recover.

How does DiskWarrior recover data no one else can?

At Alsoft, we know that the most important thing when you are attempting to repair your disks is getting your data back. That's why the first thing DiskWarrior does is scavenge your original directory to find all the file data it can. It then uses this data to build an entirely new replacement directory.

DiskWarrior is the only product that finds all of your data.

Its patent-pending method always results in a perfectly rebuilt directory without any errors and that contains all of your file and folder data.

DiskWarrior is the highest rated and wins more awards.
