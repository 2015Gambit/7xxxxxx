,jctcom,2012-02-29T07:42Z,"If you are going to insist or rarring please add it to the title or something so we know which ones to skip over without having to actually go look at it.  No one wants your rar'd files.  There is no benefit to them whatsoever.  People please take few seconds extra to look for and support the non rar'd versions of these shows.  If enought people stop downloading / seeding them then they will eventually get the message and stop using their antiquated rar system.  You can find the non rar'd version here:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7052801/Hawaii.Five-0.2010.S02E17.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION
Go download and seed that one and stop supporting these rar'd files."
