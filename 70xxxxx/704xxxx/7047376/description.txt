WHAT IS HIPPOREMOTE?

Control your computer with a wave of your hand or a flick of your finger! Impress your audience at speaking engagements or just veg out on the couch.

HippoRemote Pro turns your iPhone and iPod touch into a Wi-Fi keyboard, trackpad, and remote control, making it the perfect pocket-sized controller for your computer.

HippoRemote works great as a clicker for your Keynote or PowerPoint presentation. Or to control your classroom's interactive whiteboard.

In addition, like a high-end universal remote, you can customize the buttons and tailor them to specific apps. This makes it an ideal remote control for your HTPC, whether it's a Mac mini running Plex, a Windows PC running Windows Media Center, or a Linux box running XBMC.
