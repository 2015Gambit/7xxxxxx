[T],promodsharma,2012-02-20T06:17Z,"@'booobp. - So, you are a pirate and sermonising ? Keep your sermons to yourself. You come here to pirate and refuse to share or upload. Reminds of damn politicians. Pirates are way better than politicians."
,SergDavid,2012-02-20T06:35Z,Sadly due to bad planning I was a few hours late finding out and donating a few bucks. Wanted to try it anyway so here we are.
,Medevila,2012-02-20T06:36Z,"Some of us didn't catch the sale. I wasn't home this weekend, and Humble doesn't sell the bundle when its over. I would've bought it had they afforded me the chance."
,AnthraX2112,2012-02-20T07:07Z,@booobp I donated. Not all people can. And if it's all 100 % for charity then technically the game is free. So i'm really just distributing free software. Not pirating shit. Get the fuck out if you don't like it 
,Gkkiux,2012-02-20T14:16Z,"Thank you and BURN IN HELL >:D
No, seriously, thanks, there is no way for me to donate (or pay for anything over internet) so this is the only way I can get this or any other humble bundle"
,epiplon,2012-02-22T17:10Z,I'm pirating because the Bundle is over and I can't buy anymore. I would love to spent some money for this...
,wuggle,2012-02-22T20:49Z,"The fists of resistance should be up now, please upload!"
,Dueler96,2012-02-23T02:47Z,Have yet to download this. Waiting for Fists of Resistance :/
,gamingguy0808,2012-02-23T04:43Z,"Get updated version of Catacomb Snatch at UberSoft Technologies. They call it Uber Catacomb Snatch.

@booobp, et al: Also, Jakob Porser (@JahKob), co-founder of Mojam, says to get a torrent copy. Do a google search for ""Jakob Porser twitter bit torrent"". "
,Brozzel,2012-02-29T19:09Z,The Broadside Express is a txt file? WTF?
,Luciphage,2012-03-20T06:06Z,"Thanx, I missed the boat completely."
,doctor_roxo,2012-04-18T17:04Z,here's a group that tracks indie bundles for people that keep missing them http://steamcommunity.com/groups/IndieBundleTracker
,d3w10n,2012-05-04T22:08Z,"Man, I was so pissed when I bought this, I saw ""Bundle Mojam"" and I presumed that this bundle contained Minecraft -.-"""
