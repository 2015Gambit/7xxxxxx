,mrnexus,2012-02-22T12:53Z,"@boobsman There is word they are going to try to block the TPB here in the uk in the summer,have you or can you tell me away round it,they made the ruling on the 21/02.2012 from what i can tell."
[V],boobsman,2012-02-23T12:01Z,@ mrnexus not heard anything about it mate but if they do you should use a vpn to get round the block. You connect to the encrypted service n any site you connect to cannot be seen by the service provider as you can only be seen connecting to there server.
,mrnexus,2012-02-24T07:06Z,"@boobsman right ok a VPN what like Ipredator or something like that,What about using a proxy server to connect to TPB would that work and get me in past whatever block is put in place by the uk in the summer,cause if they hit TPB they will start hitting everyone like demonoid,etc etc,we in the uk will be hit hard,it won't just be the TPB THE BLOCK,I know ur busy boobsman but when u see this let me know about the proxy thks m8."
