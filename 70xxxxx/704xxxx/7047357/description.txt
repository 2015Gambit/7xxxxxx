On the night of this show, I had the idea to make a DVD using all the handheld camera footage I could find. Most of the shots are from the very front of the crowd, in with all the fans who traveled the world to be at this show. The audio was recorded on a stereo audio recorder right in front of the stage. The location of it left it a bit muffled, so I have done some remastering of it so you can't tell. I explained some of this in the credits, in case some trader gets this ten years from now he will know what it is.

This DVD has been exclusively available since it's creation on the official forum of The Gathering. I've made it available now on demonoid for a wider audience.
