,thunderbum,2012-02-22T23:34Z,"@Tainan2u - feeling better, and a little stronger every day although it doesn't seem to take too much to make me feel tired. I guess that goes with the territory...

....thank you for the kind words - much appreciated!

@annoyme - I've got the missing days and I'm catching up on all I've missed :)

Cheers! :)"
