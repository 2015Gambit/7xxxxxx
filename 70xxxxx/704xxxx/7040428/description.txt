When a madman attacks Batman with a new and powerful fear toxin, The Dark Knight visits the coldest and most distant part of his soul.

But what Batman discovers hidden in a moment of courage may change his life foreverâ€¦ for a dark figure from his past has returned â€“ the one adversary The Dark Knight truly fears.
