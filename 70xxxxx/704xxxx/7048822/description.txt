This little-seen English comedy / crime-drama series starred 
Anthony Steward Head ( 5 years after "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" ended), 
Jenny Agutter from the "Logan's Run" feature film as his wife, 
and Warren Clarke as his partner in crime.   

I'll be uploading one episode daily.  Only 6 were made.
