I have scanned Quran Majeed and then split every page into 3 parts having resolution 320x240 or less . More on every page first line is also last line of previous page for easy link.It is rar file having PDF files.These files can be read in any mobile which supports pdf file.So u can recite Quran on any mobile have acrobat reader.U can also download acrobat reader for your mobile from adobe web.U can extract pdf files from rar win winrar software.
