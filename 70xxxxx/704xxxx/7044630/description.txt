Synopsis
Further information: Mildred Pierce

Mildred Pierce depicts an overprotective, self-sacrificing mother during the Great Depression who finds 
herself separated from her husband, opening a restaurant of her own and falling in love with a new man, 
all the while trying to earn her narcissistic daughter's love and respect. The miniseries follows Cain's 
original novel exactly, dramatizing nearly every scene and dispensing with the murder subplot which was 
added for the 1945 film. The dialogue is almost entirely taken word-for-word from the novel.
