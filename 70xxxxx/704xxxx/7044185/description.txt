Blood Feast (also known as Egyptian Blood Feast and Feast of Flesh) is a 1963 American horror film directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis, often considered the first "splatter film". It was produced by David F. Friedman. It is a low budget pioneering Gore movie, which quickly became notorious. The 'plot' involves an insane Egyptian caterer who kills people and uses body parts for meals and also offerings to his goddess...Ishtar. Compared to this movie, Friedman's 'She Freak' of 1967 looks 'big budget' believe it or not. But Blood Feast did OK thanks to lots of bad reviews giving it lots of free publicity and nothing quite so bloody..in colour!..preceded it.
