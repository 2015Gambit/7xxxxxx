,expometty,2012-02-23T10:41Z,Question for people who watch movies on their PS3: How are you dealing with the recent .mkv popularity in the torrent world? I liked it when we had BR rips in mp4 format cause it was always easy to just put it on a flash drive and view it on PS3.
,daboblin,2012-02-23T13:59Z,@expometty use PS3 Media Server. Google it.
,nuborn13,2012-02-23T22:58Z,@expometty: I used PS3 Media Server but the transfer was just too slow. I now use an external HDD (Fat32) and convert convert the mkv files with Rebox.Net. Don't forget to set the option to split at 4gig.
,expometty,2012-02-24T02:03Z,"Thanks guys, I'll give PS3 Media Server a try since I had already considered the conversion solution and found it too time consuming + it downgrades the .mkv A/V quality for some reason when it converts to .mp4 although I'm sure the problem is some complicated settings I'm supposed to pay attention to but won't.  "
,iPodSniper,2012-02-24T06:07Z,"@expometty: try using GOTSent it's a fast mkv to mp4 converter. It takes me less then 10 mins to convert a movie, give it a chance you might like it"
,antreasg9,2012-02-24T06:15Z,just hack you ps3 and use filezila with ftp app 
,silenceisgood,2012-02-24T12:30Z,thanks
,expometty,2012-02-25T01:14Z,"@iPodSniper I like that, thanks man. @antreasg9 Thanks for the suggestion but I've looked into hacking the PS3 before and found it to be a long exhausting process of reading tutorials and posts on forums, etc + I know if I fucked it up it will be hard to fix."
,koobie777,2012-02-25T03:52Z,"just use mkv2vob it works perfectly for converting mkv to vob it just the sound not the video pretty much

,RTFW,2012-02-25T04:12Z,@expometty Use txmuxer to convert mkv to m2ts.  PS3 can read those directly and you lose nothing in the conversion.   I have burned some to DVD or copied to PS3 hard drive as m2ts and play right in the PS3.  
,Spike73x,2012-02-26T12:29Z,Does anyone else get the cinavia protection message?
,Jookycola,2012-02-28T02:57Z,Yep i got Cinevia shutdown errorcode 3 about 15 minutes into the movie on my ps3.
,The_Shank,2012-02-28T21:20Z,What you all complaining about - use Vuze as your torrent downloader. Then you can drag and drop which ones you want to view on PS3 - simple. Thanks for upload
,kgpirate,2012-02-29T07:34Z,"Just watched it!> it was great, going to seed this torrent fully because the quality is really good!, thanks Dibya"
,manicgamer,2012-03-04T05:18Z,cinavision is for when you connect to the internet. Disconnect and voila pot o gold in your brain pan.
,downloadedthat,2012-03-05T03:39Z,Being tracked by paramount. They have file name logged.
,rock53,2012-03-10T13:26Z,"Great Quality, Average Movie.

,letzgostate,2012-03-14T00:39Z,"Warning, copyright trolls are in full effect on this one! "
,BinkySlats,2012-03-15T20:34Z,"Could someone please explain ""Being tracked by paramount. They have file name logged."" and what it entails?"
,Phov,2012-03-20T02:13Z,Full on Cinavia Protected. Too bad... great quality.
,BinkySlats,2012-03-20T15:55Z,"** NOTE: Cinavia Protected - EASY to get around. 1) Don't play it on a internet connected device
2) Convert it to a different format
3) Copy it to a thumb drive and plug it into your TV

If you play it in a connected device - about 15 minutes in the sound will drop out and a window will pop up telling you you're screwed!"

,sabeku,2012-03-28T03:26Z,"@BinkySlats Thanks for the workaround. I'll need to find a way to skype with someone while watching this. maybe transfer it to a flash drive, then play it from there?"
,sabeku,2012-03-28T03:38Z,"Nvm. I did some research on Cinavia and it only effects PS3s, so computer playback should be fine. The article i found was here:
