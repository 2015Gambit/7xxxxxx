,emtoec,2012-03-05T20:36Z,Doomer... Turn the PC on and seed the file!  Once we get a few downloads we can add seeders.   SEEEEEED!
,emtoec,2012-03-06T15:15Z,It shows two seeders.  Can someone help out?  This is painful.... :-).
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-06T15:18Z,"Clever strategy for a long lasting torrent !

Today...97,7%...and 315 leechers...


I hope for the best!

Cheers."
,emtoec,2012-03-07T01:37Z,"We are up to 3 seeders, but no one is seeding.  You are right CodyBoss... lets hope for the best."
,pingman1969,2012-03-07T12:55Z,well well now at 97.7 % and it still ain't funny !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Taima,2012-03-07T21:20Z,"Well now it finally got seeded and plenty of people have it, including myself (haven't tried it yet). Thoughts on it thus far?"
,ScarySquirrel,2012-08-30T03:40Z,"Installed perfectly. 
Installation ran cracks at startup. 
Includes options for fences and other special windows enhancements. 
More features than I can list here. 
Suffice to say, this torrent deserves more seeders. 
The guy whose desktop I installed it on was impressed with its look and speed, even though he had had windows 7 on his computer already. 

In short, I want to have this operating system's man babies. If you have to dual boot, why not spoil yourself. Seriously.  "
