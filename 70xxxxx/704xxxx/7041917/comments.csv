,zoso5150,2012-02-18T16:42Z,Brilliant!!Thanks very much.As soon as I saw that YOU had put this up I knew that it was a must have´gem´(there have been so many ´mupploaders´lately who don´t know what they are doing!!!!!!!!!!)
[V],smbdownload,2012-02-18T17:33Z,"thanks brothers for the kudo's ~ so what do you mean mupploaders´ ?? 

I know not all uploaders are equal - I rip 50 % from CD ~ 45% I convert FLAC to MP3 [I want to share with as many people as possible] and 5% I re-up from other sources [but by the time I tag and add artwork and rename, etc I usually don't give credit to original source...PEACE"
,zoso5150,2012-02-18T18:27Z,"´Mupploader´is a word I made up referring to competence,using that old favourite tv programme The muppets (if we call someone a muppet it´s not a compliment) and Uploader combined , so its not complimentary,but there again it´s not outrageously rude either:)Rock On."
