You could at least attempt to comprehend the torrent before commenting.

This is the Skyrim Total Enhancement Project, which is meant to compliment the ""REAL HD textures"" you spoke of.

And Ther123, you are a goddamn saint for uploading this. I'm going to seed the fuck out of this torrent."
,Ther123,2012-02-21T13:20Z,Planning to update package and add additional new awesome mods (especially Wars In Skyrim).
,Indroid,2012-02-27T09:54Z,"Thx bro a lot! I fallow the step guide and nothing... 3 day trying to get that shit to work. All for nothing. Many mod are updated sense that gay made that tutorial and sometime, somehow mods will ""die"". Dont know about this, but i will try. Did u update some/all mods sense u made this torrent, and did skyrim work now? Anyway, thx a lot once again!!! "

Skyrim works fine for me. I made this torrent exactly to have a chance to ""reload"" Skyrim to previous state if it starts to crash etc...
I cant update now my torrent becouse torrent editing is temporary disabled. When it will be available i will try to update.
Of course largest part of this mods are updaiting every time. To mods will be outdated. Its your job to update before i have a chance to edit my torrent."

That`s superb, thx a lot that tweak! I I`m on nexus and google, trying to get hd skyrim in full [textures, lighting, EVERITHING]. Now i have 70 mods, half of them are dead... Now i`m downloading skyrim with new update, hd textures, and after that i will download this. 

""Its your job to update before i have a chance to edit my torrent. "" 

Yes yes, sorry about that, it`s my job :). Now i have list of modes [thx too you], and update is easy now. Respect :) "
