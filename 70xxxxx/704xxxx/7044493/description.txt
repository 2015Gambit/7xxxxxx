Hello!
Want to play Skyrim on High/Ultra textures? Dont want to spend a half or a full day downloading at low speed from Nexus mods and unpacking it? Scaring that you will make a mistake and Skyrim will get a nice crash, glitched testures or invisible floor so you will be falling 99999 years straight to the hell?
I made a job for you. But! You have to make a little bit as well.
This is unpacked mod collection from STEP at Nexus (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11). All i did is downloaded mods and unpacked them by following that guide.
What you have to do? Follow the guide:
1) Follow the guide "STEP Guide (PDF).pdf" (inside the directory) STEP 1.
2) Copy/paste to your fresh installed Skyrim directory with latest patch 1.4 and HD textures DLC.
3) Install Nexus Mod Manager (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/content/modmanager/) or inside the directory and register on
4) Install "NMM MODS" by NMM. Follow the guide!!!
5) Install "INTERFACE MODS". Follow the guide!!!
6) Optional- install "OPTIONAL MODS" if you want.
That's it. Now Skyrim becomes awesome.

Best regards
