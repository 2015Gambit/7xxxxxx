,cschrille1,2012-02-19T01:29Z,"Eh, are you just ripping on BF3? If so, waste of your internet rofl."
,cybervalo6,2012-02-19T01:59Z,"soo.... this is just another re-upload of what's already on TPB? 
and just so you can hate on BF3?
if so, pathetic...

if not, what's different in ""your version"" ?"
,sage1210,2012-02-19T03:31Z,"@peterwan: hahaha don't you know ? that Doomtrigger1 is a bf3 fanboy. his routine is to lie (may be brain wash)  him self that bf3 is the fresh and new invention of a video game.

i wonder don't he notice that the health regenerate and perk system is a pure copy from another game. and now this game even copy gun's accessary feature and weapon unlock quest from cod. 

amazing fanboy.

,dandalis,2012-02-20T14:14Z,"yeah BF3 is for noobs, real men play BF play4free - pay2win"
,Ascocrist,2012-03-06T23:16Z,"Well it's really not my quarrel guys (peterwan vs. Doomtrigger1) however... Tuesday 25 October 2011 is the release date of Battlefield 3... CoD-mwf2 got released on November 10, 2009 and Black Ops was released on Tuesday 09 November 2010 (they like Tuesdays now aren't they?) so... peterwan was right about this"
,Ascocrist,2012-03-06T23:21Z,as per addition: BF3 keeps crashing randomly in the middle of the god damn gunfight for god's sake... i've read a loooot of forums/entries about this cuz i have win7 sp1 64bit so i thought the game just simply hates my OS... but no actual fix came out... any ideas? -- oh and... cod-mwf2 and 3 AND black ops made me veeeeeery surprised... they say it's meant to be realistic... realistic my ass... all the damn enemy soldiers are after me and in the meanwhile my guys're pumping the bullets in the air the enemy don't give a sh:t about them and they aaaallll shooting at me like apes... oh and if I sprint forward every enemy soldier dies by household accident.... :D
,peterwan,2012-03-07T00:04Z,"@Ascocrist
yes BF3 crashed on me too, what i did was
set the game to low config and i played to
the last level without any problem."
,shubhank1,2012-03-10T03:45Z,"hey motherfucke* this is just battlefield 3 
not battlefield 3 back to karkand 
what the fucking shit is all this give us the real torrent

In this game we just have to save 3 terrorists 
give us the real torrent man"
,peterwan,2012-03-13T22:37Z,"""shubhank1"" i have got no fucking
idea what the fuck are you talking
about. Please SIR talk in ENGLISH;)"
,halorec998,2012-04-08T14:25Z,"OK peterwan,
If you insist that:
This game has nothing new at all, the idea

and concept of this game is 100% Ripped from

Call of duty MWF2 and Black Ops, except for

the graphics quality.

Then you are Wrong...

Look at the first release dates of 

battlefield 1942 = September 10, 2002

And

Call of Duty 1 = October 29, 2003

You will notice that battlefield was released earlier than CoD so that if you state that they are of the same idea and concept then The makers of CoD must have RIPPED it from Battlefield. If you want proof :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_(series)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty

Look on the left side for first releas...

Greetings Halorec998

Ps: If you want to have a fun game, buy Halo Reach :DDD"
