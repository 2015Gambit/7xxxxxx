,blankproductions,2012-03-04T14:00Z,"@jpchen

PirateBay are only using magnet links now mate.
if your using uTorrent, just click the magnet link on this page (GET THIS TORRENT) and the normal ADD TORRENT window will open in uTorrent.

Sometimes the window will not show anything in the torrent item list, just click ADD or START anyway,
once it starts downloading all info will be there.

if you want to 'save the torrent & add it for download later' then you can just add it into your torrent client and not start downloading it until you wish or you can just Bookmark the page and come back when your ready.

you can also add a torrent by clicking ADD TORRENT BY URL (or something similar) in your torrent client (uTorrent, BitTorrent, Vuze, etc.)
and just copy & paste the page url into that.

hope that helps"
,Sokiii,2012-03-05T02:08Z,@B34J3W the problem people are having is due to the change TPB changed to. For some reason Utorrent is not recognizing the files within the magnet link since there are no longer download links.
