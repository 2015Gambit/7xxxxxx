  During one gruesome night at an isolated bar located in the furthest       
  stretches of the Australian outback, the fun-loving staff go from drinking,
  partying, and negotiating sexual politics with each other, to fighting for 
  their lives, as some evil force lurking in the cellar finally rises to the 
  surface, and begins to leave a bloody, horrific trail of bodies in its wake
