,zootalaws,2012-02-20T06:41Z,Well the first thing you could do would be to seed your torrent... It's nice to see Blake's 7 on the net - it would be nicer to see it on my PC :)
,mchlclark,2012-02-20T08:24Z,"Yes I know. Sorry. It took a bit to get going. I'm in Australia and we don't have cable only ADSL2+. So max up speed of 80-100kbs. We will have cable installed to 96% of Australia in 2016. It sucks. It's going now and am doing my best to keep it at top speed. It's saying about 4-7 days. I just want to contribute and have some great torrents if people can be patient with speed.

,zootalaws,2012-02-24T03:49Z,"Well you need to seed it for longer than that - currently it is showing only .6 availability - which means that only 60% of the files are being shared.

It is annoying that people don't seed after they download, but such is the nature of torrents. I would say you need to seed until you see that the availability is over 1.5 at least."
,mchlclark,2012-02-25T02:04Z,Thanks For the tip. I will make sure to do this with all torrents in future.
,mchlclark,2012-02-25T02:15Z,"I just looked on my end and my client says it's ""Availability"" is 1.5. So not sure what's happened. Maybe somebody decided to seed since you posted?"
[S],velvet.,2012-02-25T13:01Z,"@mchlclark:

You made a serious mistake when you created this torrent using a 8 MB block size.
You ought to have used a 1 MB or 2 MB block size instead.
The smaller the block size, the more efficiently the data will replicate between the peers in the torrent swarm."
,mchlclark,2012-02-25T20:28Z,OK. Thank you for telling me. I just left the Piece Size on Default Size? I assumed it would be smaller than that. I will manually select Piece Size from now on. Will making it smaller be even better or are those sizes from dial up days?
,DrSyn001,2012-03-12T01:22Z,Is this torrent ever going to fully seed? seems like it's been stuck at 6 GB for days!
[S],velvet.,2012-03-12T23:55Z,"@mchlclark:

When are you going to seed the rest of this?
The whole swarm is waiting for you to do so.
Everyone seems stuck at 85.8%, except for one guy who got 92.3%, but he is not sharing with anyone."
,DrSyn001,2012-03-16T14:55Z,So ... is this ever going to properly seed and be finished? Been waiting almost a month.
,DrSyn001,2012-03-20T06:47Z,"I wish I could tell you how sad I am that this torrent appears to be dead. I've wanted to see B7 for years, and it's not available on DVD in the U.S. I thought this was finally my chance, but I guess not. "
,bluesj22,2012-03-29T23:38Z,"this is such an excellent show! too excellent for these nice small file videos to get stuck at 86 % 
waiting for seeds 
please =)"
,DrSyn001,2012-03-30T06:57Z,"Sorry, bluesj22 - I think we're hosed."
,mchlclark,2012-03-30T09:05Z,Sorry thought it was ok. Seeding now.
,mchlclark,2012-03-30T09:08Z,I hadn't checked comments for a while. I finally got ratio above 1.5 and availability at 1.00. Was checking it via my client. I'm guessing relying on my client to tell me the numbers is not a good idea? Anyway it's uploading at an average of 50kbs at moment. I will try to get speed up a bit.
,bluesj22,2012-03-30T18:49Z,"woo hoo! now we got it rolling !
its going really fast too =) 
i will seed this once i get the whole thing, as much as i can. my internet is also slow and i'm on solar power, so cant carry it too much, but will seed for a while when i can.

but hey mchlclark, thanks! this is a great show, i'm happy to get the whole complete thing in small files. sorry we've been giving you flack. got nervous it wasnt going to finish."
,mchlclark,2012-03-31T01:01Z,I completely understand. I'm new to this as a seeder so am still learning. I really thought it was still being seeded. I have had a couple of really large torrents I really wanted above 20GB stop and never start again. It is really disappointing. I will keep a better eye on my torrents from now on and make sure it's all good.
,DrSyn001,2012-04-02T15:28Z,Thanks.
