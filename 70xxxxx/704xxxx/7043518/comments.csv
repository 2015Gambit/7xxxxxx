,gypsywin,2012-03-02T22:14Z,Your specified files are not there. Unless you renamed them and did not change the readme. 
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-05T08:04Z,"@'gypsywin' - My sincere apologies for not being clear :(  and Thanks for pointing out the anomaly :)

The ""ZBrush_4R2b_upgrader.exe"" is a 200 MB File which has to be downloaded from ZBrush site, which upgrades the V 4R2 to V 4R2b. Follow instructions after the ""ZBrush_4R2b_upgrader.exe"" has been downloaded and then follow instructions.

My sincere apologies again."
,708z00,2012-03-14T22:46Z,"ZBrush_4R2b_Upgrader.exe Does not seem to be available from Pixologic anymore? 
Only 4R3.
Upgrading with ZBrush_4R3_Upgrader.exe 
gives a ZResc4.31.ZRS in Zdata folder. Not ZResc4.3.ZRS.

Anyway its not working for me. 
Would it be possible to get a new crack for the R3 version?
Thaaaanks =)"
