To play Flac files - type into Google: videolan vlc player 

Download VLC media player, install and thats it.

Windows Media Player does not support Flac at the moment though there are free codecs that will allow you to play Flac files in WMP.

Both WMP and VLC player can be installed on the same computer without any problems therefore allowing complete freedom of choice. 

Flac is a lossless format and gives you CD quality playback.
