[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

President Obama says his new budget will put the country on a more sustainable fiscal path, but his path adds $1.3 trillion dollars to our already massive debt.

What would happen if you planned your family's budget the way the politicians plan theirs? I showed people this chart:


Everyone agreed that this would be a ridiculous household budget.

But that's the federal budget, if you just add 8 zeroes!

People on the street were horrified at our debt, but when I asked them what they would cut, most had no clue.

So tonight, with the help of our guests, we will tell them.

Stuart Varney, host of Varney & Co. on Fox Business, will join us along with Rich Benjamin, a senior fellow from the progressive think tank Demos, to debate Obama's new budget.

Texas Congressman Jeb Hensarling, House Republican Committee Chairman, will explain why the President's budget creates a debt crisis.

Since we are on the path to Greece, Fox Business correspondent Ashley Webster will join us from Athens, at the heart of Greece's chaotic debt crisis to report on how the Greek people riot over cuts to their giant entitlement state. Here is a sample of that.

Our high debt burden is not just insane, but immoral, says former welfare recipient Star Parker and Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute.

Finally, even with a busted budget, politicians want you to pay for this: a mandate to force adult film stars to wear condoms. Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy says it's needed for public health and safety, but adult film star Kayden Kross will appear to say that she doesn't want the government's protection.

A lively show, tonight!
