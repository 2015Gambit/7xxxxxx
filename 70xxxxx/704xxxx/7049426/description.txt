  Afghanistan - Girlpower!                                              
                                                                        
  Theyre two women from utterly different worlds so what do a          
  seasoned Australian television producer and a 19 year old student     
  from Kabul, Afghanistan have in common. Its a shared hope for the    
  ascendency of female rights, aspiration and opportunity in one of     
  the most dangerous and oppressive places on earth. The outsider is    
  shaping some of the countrys TV drama, tackling confronting issues   
  that challenge the orthodoxy. The teenager is boldly fighting         
  violence in the street and at home. Its a massive battle against an  
  age old order but dont discount her  Noorjahan Akbar isnt about    
  to take a backward step.
