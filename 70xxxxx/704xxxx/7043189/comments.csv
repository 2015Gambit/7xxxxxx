,mfa39,2012-04-04T11:45Z,thanks! was wondering how it's in such a small size though? most 720p videos are usually at least 500mb per episode. great quality still tho!
,brunofreitas,2012-04-24T03:32Z,"Is there any torrent of the first season in 720p that is not in spanish? I keep on getting ""anno 2030""..."
[V],maximersk,2012-04-26T17:35Z,"It's my torrent dude... my videos reencoded !

,willis00,2012-05-05T23:41Z,"Is there any quality loss between this torrent and the original 12GB source? 

Just wondering how you compressed it?

Thanks for the upload"
[V],maximersk,2012-05-06T17:12Z,"I'm awesome dude, the quality is the same... Trust me... dude ! Trust me !"
,gregori.ath,2012-05-08T22:53Z,Thanks dude!
,VicVega,2012-08-23T22:23Z,"Well I trusted you and got disappointed. Quality is inconsistent, I just watched one of the episodes that had CBS as source and it had the wrong framerate and low quality sound. I'll go get the bigger torrent and see if that's any better. "
