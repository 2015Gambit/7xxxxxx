,Dirrrrt,2012-03-23T16:44Z,"It can be me.. But can't get this torrent to work.

When I start a scenario, I get a pop up of fails to load some items. Most of them are the trains that can't be loaded.

What I did was I extracted the file with WinRAR. After that I installed the .rwp files with the Package Manager in TS2012.

Does anyone have a suggestion to get this to work?"

I had the same problem when I tried to install this months ago. I haven't managed to fix it. It is weird because other routes that came with trains worked.

I was just wondering, do you need to have a cracked version for this to work or can it still be installed on the steam version?"
