Excited to spend quality father-stepson bonding time with Rallo, Cleveland takes Rallo to his very first magic show, where they get hired to be the opening act. Thanks to Ralloâ€™s sharp wit in the role of the puppet, Cleveland and Ralloâ€™s ventriloquist act becomes a hit.

Not one to be taken for a dummy, Rallo proves that he is the heart of their comedic act
