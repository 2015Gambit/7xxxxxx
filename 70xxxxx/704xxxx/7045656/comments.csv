,xx2000xx,2012-02-20T18:36Z,"I don't think I gave you a ""thank you for your hard work"" in maybe 1-3 years but I just reset my pw here (as I forgot my old one) when I use to upload my own original stuff back in the day, but I need to thank you again.

It's not for me, but my 63 year old G'ma from the US appreciates it like no other for so many years now. Thanks so much dude. We had a scare there for a second when all your posts went down but it looks like you're still rocking and rolling. "
