,diawkdfi,2012-02-18T17:16Z,I usually like to look at original p2p productions.  But webM/Vorbis encoding?  What were you thinking?  Can't you encode to something more popular?  What's wrong with avi/mkv/wmv/ac3/mp3?

WebM is already implemented on YouTube, which will make it ubiquitous for sure. The version of VLC I had installed seems to play the YouTube videos alright, even though my VLC is a few months old, standard installation from the Videolan website's frontpage.

Oh, I almost forgot; Mozilla Firefox plays WebM too. Firefox does not play DivX avi for example, so I would suggest WebM is one of the most supported formats now."
