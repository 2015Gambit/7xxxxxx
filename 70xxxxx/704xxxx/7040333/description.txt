Your Face is a Saxophone is an animated series â€” a bizarro-surreal satire of the advertising industry, and the people who work in it because they couldn't find a job in what they actually went to art school for. Also, everyone has inanimate objects instead of heads for some reason.

Your Face is a Saxophone is a non-commercial, fan-supported series. We aim to prove that great TV shows can be made without corporate funding.
