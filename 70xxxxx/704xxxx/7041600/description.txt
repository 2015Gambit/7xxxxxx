Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii is a 1972 film featuring Pink Floyd performing six songs in the ancient Roman amphitheatre in Pompeii, Italy. It was directed by Adrian Maben and recorded in the month of October using studio-quality 24-track recorders without a live audience. The film was scheduled for a special premiere at London's Rainbow Theatre, on 25th November 1972. It was canceled at the last minute by the theater's owners, Rank Strand. Their eventual explanation was that the film didn't have a certificate from the British Board of Censors and they wouldn't allow the Rainbow Theatre, which was a music venue, to be a venue for showing a film and thus could be seen to be in competition with their other established cinemas.
