
Gorillaz The Singles Collection 2001-2011 CD FLAC 2011 PERFECT{ICM369}


Perhaps the most striking thing about the music on offer here is how stripped down it is. 

The influence of dub and hip hop looms large, especially on tracks featured from their first two albums, their self-titled debut of 2001 and its 2005 follow-up, Demon Days. 

These see simple instrumentation bedded down over programmed drumbeats that sounded nostalgic even at the time of release. (Once upon a time theyâ€™d even have been described as â€˜baggyâ€™.)
 
But Albarnâ€™s alter ego seems to allow him to shake off concepts of indie credibility that he may otherwise have clung to, aiming instead for the pop jugular with the simple melodies of Feel Good Inc and Clint Eastwood, whose loping gait does nothing to diminish that chorus: 
"Iâ€™ve got sunshine in a bag", a sly reference to the actorâ€™s classic The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (also the inspiration for the name of another Albarn side project, The Good, the Bad 
& the Queen).

Eastwoodâ€™s there again on the brilliant Dirty Harry, another shuffling beat underpinning an uplifting childrenâ€™s choir until Bootie Brown takes the mike. 

Albarnâ€™s social conscience is also in evidence here, the kids singing "I need a gun to keep myself from harm", an idea echoed (obviously) in Kids With Guns. 2010â€™s Plastic Beach birthed four further singles, but they made less of an impact, despite the fact that they see Albarn pursue a more commercially pop route: 

Superfast Jellyfish demonstrates an attractive lightness of touch, while On Melancholy Hill reflects its name perfectly, Albarn sounding glum over a candyfloss minor-key pop classic that deserved to peak far higher than 78 in the British charts.

Sadly thereâ€™s nothing here from their iPad album, The Fall, and instead weâ€™re given the sped-up, somewhat disorientating Ed Case/Sweet Irie version of Clint Eastwood. But that fails to distract from the fact that Albarn has, against the odds, proven himself to be one of the most inventive of the UKâ€™s high-profile musicians over the past two decades. 

Admire the riches this national treasure has bestowed upon us. 

Thereâ€™s plenty to smile about, though Gorillaz remain no laughing matter.
