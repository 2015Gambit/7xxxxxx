Manufactured Landscapes 
This film by Jennifer Baichwal remarkably documents the environmental effect of globalization.

This documentary focuses on Edward Burtynsky, an accomplished Canadian photographer known for grand-scale industrial landscape imagery. From here, director Jennifer Baichwal raises concerns about the environment and the ways in which our planet is changing. Cameraman Peter Mettler helps to bring these issues to the forefront through stunning cinematography which acts as a counterpart to Burynsky's images of modern China.
Quote by Edward Burtynsky
"	"I think the environmental movement has failed in that it's used the stick too much; it's used the apocalyptic tone too much; it hasn't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out."
