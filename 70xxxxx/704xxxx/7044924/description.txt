"Be Careful What You Fish For"

When Peter and the guys try to salvage a 
sunken Mercedes-Benz, Peter half-heartedly 
promises a favor to a helpful dolphin 
(guest voice Ricky Gervais). Soon the 
dolphin moves to Quahog, outstays his 
welcome at Peters and moves into 
Clevelands house across the street. Peter 
tries to reunite the dolphin with his ex-
wife in hopes that hell return to the 
ocean, but his plan backfires and the 
whole dolphin family moves into 
Clevelands old house.
