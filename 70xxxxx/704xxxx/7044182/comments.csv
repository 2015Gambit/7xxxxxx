[V],globeplus,2012-02-19T16:13Z,"Hi ! Perfect hard work with excellent results for a pratical file , all game available and updated with a very complete trainer that works perfectly , i tested personally , of course dlc 1 and 2 included , everything that it is available for the moment for this game and total portability around the computer ...

enjoy ... "
,ravibose49,2012-02-19T16:21Z,can you rip kingdoms of amlaur or darkness ii
[V],globeplus,2012-02-19T21:36Z,"To ravibose49 : 

without giving to you any expectations about a possible work on the mentionated game , iÂ´ll make a deal with you : iÂ´ll take a look and after all the necessary analysis of the game if somehow i think that it is possible a positive work i do the file but if i think that it is really tough to get a pratical file then i certainly prefer to reccomend the all game because the point on the pratical files is to get the games pratical enough at least , i canÂ´t consider that i am uploading a pratical file if the final size it is close to the original iso , it is ridiculous to look like a valid option with a rip or pratical file close from the original file size ... just donÂ´t make sense ... so if it is possible the work i can give a shot but if donÂ´t well , get the original certainly more reccomendable because my file if it have a close size somehow donÂ´t give nothing new really compared to the original , i canÂ´t even call the file a valid rip or pratical file , i think you can understand very easily this point of view and happy games to you ."
[V],globeplus,2012-02-19T21:39Z,"Small note : i was talking about darkness 2 on the before comment , no ofense but the first mentionated game out of question to work . Thank you ."
,tweaker61,2012-02-19T22:53Z,"Wow, 2.67 gigs? Nice man, damn, Ive thought ive seen it all, but wow. Ive seen a lot of torrents with highly compressed games but wow, this is great. Did you RIP anything? Sorry had to ask, but its just when a 7 gig game gets put down to 2, ya know lol. Still, even if stuff is ripped, still pretty damn good."
,drkabarkin,2012-02-19T23:18Z,"@globeplus


are the dlc included here??"
[V],globeplus,2012-02-20T01:13Z,"Sorry , Darkness 2 out of question , not possible a nice pratical file ."
[V],globeplus,2012-02-20T01:14Z,"To tweeker61 : it´is in english , that´s all , videos worked perfectly about 100 ."

[V],globeplus,2012-02-20T11:16Z,Hi again ! This comment is to say that unfornatly many times the games comes in heavy archives compressed somehow without modding tools not letting do a satisfatory work for a pratical file so certainly not in all the games is possible the work ... see all of you around and happy game . 
,ravibose49,2012-02-20T11:43Z,ok globeplus no offense

[V],globeplus,2012-02-21T00:00Z,"LA:Noire confirmed already that it is not possible , i checked very closely 1 week and half ago after a suggestion from another user , really heavy archives that can be open with some smart tough tool to get and it is possible the extraction of the conteud but no way back after a possible work to make the heavy archive that works after the modifications with the game running , once more , sorry but no way to a pratical file . See you around and happy gaming to you ."

The game is good but the gameplay, the view, and the graphics sucks. Any way its worth the download.
