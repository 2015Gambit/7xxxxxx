Because the ETA of months would suggest not :/

Only 5 people have 100% of this torrent and all are choking it.

If you're posting torrents you should at least upload for longer than 30mins."

And folks complaining about Magnet Links, it's not a drop of sweat harder than clickin on torrent files.

You can pick and choose the files you want as soon as the downloads starts, on your torrent client.

If your client doesn't let you see the files and decide what to get, use uTorrent, which you should already be doing anyway."
