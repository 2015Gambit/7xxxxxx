,ASkyNinja,2012-02-28T00:08Z,@GopherTee Which files are you talking about?
,ASkyNinja,2012-02-28T00:20Z,"@GopherTee That folder is used to downgrade the Wii to 4.1U so you can install Priiloader and then the IOS files needed for 4.3U. After the downgrade, you will install the IOS files which 4.3U has. So, really, it has all the updates of 4.3U."
