,zlidzon,2012-04-04T12:20Z,"Hi Doubzstep!

Great upload! I still haven't tried to install the software (no free time...:) but I managed to read your installation instruction... So I have a couple of questions before I start:

1) What comes first (ok, first step is Before you install:): Installation Instructions (body text) or Instructions (numbered)? Because it seems to me that these two overlap to some extent (or I am wrong?:) and I was not able to catch a line where and how... :) Sorry for my ignorance :)

2) Interweb is this network thing?:)

Well that's my questions for now, and I hope for good:)

Thanks for your reply!

Best,
Z"
,Doubzstep,2012-04-04T17:35Z,"@zlidzon, the first instructions are for people that want to distribute the SAS software to more than 1 computers at a time (server, etc). For a single user (more than likely like you and me) just use the numbered instructions at the bottom.

Hope this helped."
,zlidzon,2012-04-04T23:21Z,"Helped indeed! 

Thanks a lot Dubstep, will try to install tomorrow ;)"
,zlidzon,2012-04-05T16:00Z,"Works!

,de1pher,2012-04-14T05:18Z,"thanks for the upload. Unfortunately I couldn't install it. First, i changed the date on my PC, disconnected from the internet, and ran setup.exe. I  then chose to install SAS Base, and all the components in it. The next screen asked me for SAS installation data file and when I clicked Next, it said that an incorrect data file was selected. Then i tried to exist setup and start again, but then I couldn't even launch setup.exe - when I click on it nothing happens. I've tried removing the the installation file out of the runtime/professional folder, and the boostrap file out of the application data (which by the way always ended with ExitInstance -=101). I would appreciate if someone could help me figure out what to do. thanks"
,iamthank,2012-04-14T22:06Z,"I would like to express my sincere thanks to Doubzstep for his work in uploading this torrent and accompanying it with clear and concise installation instructions. I was able to successfully install SAS 9.2 from this torrent on both Win7 x64 and WinXP x86.

Note, for those interested in SAS Enterprise Guide 4.2:

I could not install EG 4.2 through this torrent (I don't believe this particular installation contains it), but I was able to get EG 4.1 working with SloveniaX's torrent, located here:

,SloveniaX,2012-04-15T02:13Z,"dude, as much as I am grateful and happy to see people sharing and helping the community with free software, you could still acknowledge that your torrent is just a repack of stuff you've found online, specifically http://kat.ph/sas-system-9-2-t2593878.html, http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6276181/SAS_9.2_original_release_(latest_SID_-_Sept_2011)_-_reupload and a new license (which is the only novel thing here, to be honest). yeah, we're pirates but this doesn't mean we don't know what honor is ;)"
,SloveniaX,2012-04-15T02:28Z,"oh, i can see this is your first torrent - I guess I shouldn't be too hard on you, but still... iamthank is completely right, this torrent DOES NOT contain Enterprise Guide 4.2 (and NEVER HAS)..."
,Doubzstep,2012-04-15T07:50Z,"@SloveniaX, First off, I already provided the link to where I compiled this from; more specifically, from the chinese website called verycd (the link is provided on the first comment page) Secondly, may I ask where you got your SID file? Thirdly, where did you get your original SID that you provided to TPB? The whole points of torrents is to share what you find to others. So, you and I are alike; uploading torrents from what we find on the internet or what has not been posted to the internet here (more specifically TPB). So, please, do not call out any uploader that has already provided accurate documentation from where he/her got his/her torrent from and has taken the time to share his work, take the time to prepare it, upload photos to The Pirate Bay. You sir, are a shame to the sharing community. I do not see a Pink or Green skull on you name. What authority do you actually have? None. If you have a problem with my torrent, I believe there are several threads found on the Suprbay Forum if you would like to complain to the Moderators. Have a good day.

Meanwhile, if any other downloaders have issues installing, I will be here to help.

-Doubzstep"
,de1pher,2012-04-17T23:14Z,"Yes, I am having issues - I think you may have missed my comment.

First, thanks for the upload.

My problem is:

When I first tried to install the program, I selected base SAS and proceeded until the point where it asked me for SAS installation data file. I pressed Next, but it said the path is not valid.

So I thought I'd start all over again. I pressed exit, and then tried to run the setup.exe file again. It didn't work. So now for some reason, the setup.exe doesn't seem to work at all.

I've tried removing  the installation file out of the runtime/professional folder, and the boostrap file out of the application data, but that didn't help.

I would appreciate if you could help.

many thanks in advance."
,Doubzstep,2012-04-18T05:15Z,"@de1pher, I have also had this issue before. At this step, you must navigate to your download folder and select the ""ORIGINAL SID (June2009).txt"" file. Then hit next. A new screen showing what you have ""purchased"" should pop up. Let me know if this helped."
,gabriel.angelfire,2012-04-20T01:17Z,"Thanks for the Torrent, great jog. Now, if itÂ´s not too much to ask, where could I get the Enterprise Guide?"
,de1pher,2012-04-20T01:46Z,"thanks Doubzstep, I'll try that. But before I could get there, I somehow need to be able to launch setup.exe which just doesn't seems to respond in any way. Any advice on how I could get it up and running again?"
,Daifik,2012-04-20T11:48Z,"Man, U R the best! Thanks a lot 4 relevant SID!"
,Doubzstep,2012-04-20T15:15Z,"@de1pher, Has the installer run before? If it has not, you may have to re-download again. What OS do you have? And, if mounting the .iso does not work, either A) extract all the files using 7-zip, winzip, etc. or B) Burn the .iso to a DVD and install that way. I'll check back to see if all goes well.

@gabriel.angelfire, Man, I have been looking for that for a very long time, and cannot find Enterprise Guide 4.2. To be honest, the Enterprise guide is a watered down NOOB guide to SAS and will run SAS programs even if there are mistakes in the program you wrote. In my opinion, the Enterprise Guide is unneeded. 

@Daifik, You are welcome for the relevant SID file, but I must disagree with you, I am certainly NOT the best. Just a caring and giving regular guy just like the rest of the lot on TPB.

Thanks a lot!
Onlysmall glitch was :

One Small question to you : Will this install require any further renewal from my side ? OR can I continue to use it over next couple of years.

Thanks again!"
,Doubzstep,2012-04-23T03:45Z,"@garryb21, You will need to renew the SID after September 2012. Or, you could set time back temporarily if you needed to use it. I will post here of any new SID's and will upload it here when I find new dates. Glad your install went well."
,de1pher,2012-04-24T22:47Z,"Thanks for the prompt response.

The installer ran fine the first time I've launched it. Extracting iso doesn't seem to help either.

According to the SAS website (http://www.sas.com/offices/europe/uk/support/sas-hints-tips/vista.html) They do not support Windows 7 Home Basic/Premium. I think that may be your issue. I would upgrade your install of Windows 7 and that should fix your problem.
