Skip James Studio Sessions: Rare & Unreleased
Released: 1967 
Label: Vanguard Records
Format::Flac


These recently recovered sides constitute an addition to the blues vernacular tantamount to the discovery of a hitherto unknown late Beethoven string quartet. Prior to the release of Studio Sessions: Rare and Unreleased, Jamesâ€™ entire output existed on a handful of long-playing albums, one from the early 1930s and the rest contemporaries with this recording from 1967. While it is a bit of an exaggeration to say the James is neglected, his output nevertheless is often obscured by that of Son House, Robert Johnson, and Mississippi John Hurt when compared to his sheer artistry and honor.

This session finds James limiting himself to traditional music and spirituals. A highlight among many is his post-modern piano performance of Hoagy Carmichaelâ€™s "Lazy Bones." The majority of rural blues artists from the 1920s and â€˜30s were fluent in the popular vernacular. Here is one of the most perfect examples of cultural cross-pollination one could imagine: a monument, if only a minor one, to perhaps the finest talent expressed from the Mississippi Delta tradition.
