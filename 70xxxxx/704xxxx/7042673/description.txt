It All Belongs To Me in the comeback duo single by Brandy and Monica. It is the sequel from their 1999 hit, The Boy Is Mine. While neither vocals have flawed in any way, the song shows a more positive side of females, with both forcing their man to leave her bags at the door.

The single is set to appear in both Brandy's and Monica's upcoming 2012 albums. The video for it will be shown on Vevo and the two will perform the single together.
