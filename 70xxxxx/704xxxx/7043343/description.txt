This torrent was originally uploaded to Demonoid, by Beb him/herself, over a year ago.  It is an update of the outstanding PDFs that s/he had shared on Pirate Bay @ http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4304296
This update includes new British, adult versions of the books, as well as corrected typos.

I am uploading the torrent because of all the inferior or outdated versions I've seen uploaded here, but most especially because of a recent pseudo high-quality version being shared.  You know who you are.  This pseudo version has the British cover artwork, so how come the spelling is American???  It also features obvious typos, such as THE VANASHIG GLASS.  I'm not saying BeB's PDFs are typo-free, but they are very high quality, and have had readers submit corrections to him/her (and BeB has made no self-website promotions, either ;-)).

Below is the original description of BeB's torrent, taken from Demonoid.  S/He deserves all the credit for this.  If the screenshot above hasn't sold you, visit the old torrent (URL posted above), and read the comments.  This is the absolute best PDF of the books you will see, unless Rowling herself authorizes Harry Potter eBooks for sale.
