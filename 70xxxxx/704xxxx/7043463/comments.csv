,Weirdough,2012-02-20T09:47Z,"You're welcome, it took me a while to get it, but the first thing I did was create a torrent. 
Now, it might take a while to download because there's only a seed or two, but be patient. "
,bleedforseed,2012-02-20T19:19Z,This is great! I just started and ive turned on my upload limit to the max for this one!
,bleedforseed,2012-02-20T19:26Z,"So far everyone is stuck at 6.9% :( 
but those 6.9% downloaded themselves really fast :D

need at least 1 guy with 100%"
,potah,2012-02-22T14:01Z,"I actually have to agree to this, seed people. ItÂ´s up to 14 % now. Close all other stuff that you are seeding if that speeds it up. :)"
,abababababa,2012-02-24T12:11Z,"Thank you so F'ing much Weirdough. 

And they wonder why people pirate things... 

Pricing a DVD... at $300... no matter how ""incredibly good it is"" seems so ridiculously ludicrous.

It makes me feel like I'm buying into one of those ""Make money off the stock market NOW!"" ads. 

I suppose we'll see if it's worth the cost. 

Thank you nonetheless.

,joshw220,2012-02-27T02:49Z,"So it seems to only be 1 active seeder and he comes on in the late evenings PST for like 30 minutes, I am at 55% and try to seed, Hopefully he comes on again to get the rest. I do not think this torrent will be tracked so I will seed when it is done. 

I am almost on my 3rd letter from my internet provider. So I am being careful about uploads. I am guessing this guy doesn't even know his product is online, saw his website."
,htshpst,2012-02-29T03:25Z,Now stuck at 60.8% .. I'd seed these 24/7 if I could only download it!
,Endless_t,2012-03-01T07:48Z,any way you can make a avi file from this? and THANKS SO MUCH FOR ADDING THIS!!!!!!!!but a avi will be so helpful. and i will seed
,Weirdough,2012-03-01T19:02Z,"The .rar has two .mp4 files inside. Sorry, but I can't convert them. Also, I'm pretty sure the file would be bigger if I did.
To those of you who are stuck or are worried because you sometimes see 0 seeders up there, don't worry, I'm seeding. But be patient, bear in mind it's only me seeding, and there's like 130 of you. "
,Bluewolf44,2012-03-06T00:46Z,It's sooo close! I gain about 4% every day. At 82% now.
,ziazon,2012-03-09T16:44Z,"Really.. 97% and stuck... okay who ever has it please for the sake of others, seed! It's not all about you."
,ShaneXtopher,2012-03-09T18:57Z,"Ziazon, you are a complete tool.

If you had taken the 30 seconds necessary to read the previous comments, you would see that there is one (very gracious) seeder who is slowly but surely seeding for the rest of us, all of whom have been patient and appreciative enough to not post obnoxious shit like you. Many of us have been waiting for this torrent over several weeks. And at an average of 4-5% a day, the file will be at 100% very soon.

Weirdough, thank you for sharing this with the lot of us.

Ziazon, you suck at life."
,nuk8,2012-03-10T09:52Z,"Can some create a torrent for Fashion Photography Exposed, by Melissa Rodwell"
,ziazon,2012-03-10T19:00Z,"Oh ShaneXtopher, seriously, you think there is no one else who has downloaded this? The least those guys can do is come back and seed it, whether it be for a week or more instead of putting all the stress on Weirdough (which I am highly grateful of him seeding for us all).

I will guarantee you I shall be seeding for a good month at least. Even though my upload may not be good, I still will seed."
,ShaneXtopher,2012-03-10T23:24Z,"Ziazon, you still don't seem to understand that Weirdough created the torrent. How can there be another seed when nobody else has hit 100%? I understand bitching about a lack of seeds if there are a multitude of seeds, but in this case, there is just one. We're all at 99.5%, so that will be changing shortly. THEN you can bitch about people not seeding."
,ziazon,2012-03-11T05:20Z,"ShaneXtopher, if you had a look last night, you would of seen 2 - 3 seeds. There are a few out there with it finished. I know Weirdough is the torrent creator."
,siii3,2012-03-11T17:57Z,Damn. Just downloaded the rar but I can't extract the rar file. Getting error that the file is corrupted.. 
,josh2020,2012-03-11T22:50Z,"Un-RARed this with 7zip and worked fine.
V:10
A:10"
,Weirdough,2012-03-12T01:04Z,"Jesus Christ... does it say 86 seeders there? Amazing. 

siii3: the .rar should have two mp4s inside, they should be easily extracted with WinRAR, 7zip, or the zip/rar program of your choice. I created the file with WinRAR, so I guess that should work best. 

P.S.: I'm so glad all of this is over. I've been seeding alone since I uploaded this and it's been hell. I'll keep seeding, but if you like what you got and you were pissed because it took too long to download, do everyone else a favour and keep seeding for a while, it'll be better for everyone. Thank you in advance. "
,ShaneXtopher,2012-03-12T05:35Z,"Weirdough, thanks so much for sharing this. You're a champ. It took some time, but we finally tipped, and I for one truly appreciate it."
,Weirdough,2012-03-14T01:28Z,"ShaneXtopher, you're welcome. I've downloaded so much stuff over the years, that when I finally had something that wasn't available through torrent, I just HAD to upload it. It's the least I can do, really. "
,edaffy2818,2012-03-20T01:28Z,"can someone show me how to download this, it keeps downoading something called codec-M "
,VinceJ,2012-04-08T15:28Z,"Many, many thanks for this! You're a LEGEND! Currently download and will definitely seed! 

A second request for Fashion Photography Exposed, by Melissa Rodwell please! That would be AWESOME! "
,eyesonlyt,2012-04-10T21:33Z,"Hey Weirdough, THANKS A MILLION, you have Paypal, so I can send you a small, vey tiny  donation ?? :)"
,eyesonlyt,2012-04-10T21:40Z,THNKS you are my hero!! Weirdough
,Weirdough,2012-04-13T22:27Z,"I don't accept donations, but you can give to the Red Cross or some orphans or something. "
,iippiikk,2012-04-15T11:20Z,"Thank you weirdough. You really the best. Now is very fast download. I download the file for couple of hours and left to share for everybody else. I will quote user abababababa : 'Pricing a DVD ... at $ 300 .. no matter how ""incredibly good it is"" seems so ridiculously ludicrous. ""  It's to much!!! Thanks one more!"
,er3wi1,2012-06-01T15:13Z,"Fuck You  Weirdough,
For $300 i could buy your mother.
So cut that crap.
And do not ask for money.
Here is TPB."
,Weirdough,2012-06-05T12:23Z,"er3wi1, learn to read before posting a comment. The dvd costs 300, I uploaded it for free. I was offered money and I turned it down. "
,ssalazars,2012-06-21T23:24Z,"How can I download this torrent? While adding the URL directly on uTorrent, the ""file"" is empty. And There is no ""Get Torrent File"" link. Help please!"
,ssalazars,2012-06-21T23:29Z,"How can I download this torrent? There is no ""Get this torrent"" link nor I can download it from pasting the link directly on uTorrent. Help please!!"
,Weirdough,2012-06-23T03:37Z,"ssalazars, that's odd... I can see the ""get this torrent"" link right there... Try searching for it on the search engine, and IN THE RESULTS LIST, click the little magnet icon below the name... see if that works. "
,ssalazars,2012-06-23T04:43Z,"I finally managed to download it, thanks a lot!"
,ballalaaa,2012-06-30T22:03Z,"Thx, your the best :)"
