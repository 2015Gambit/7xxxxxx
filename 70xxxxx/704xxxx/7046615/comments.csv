I'm looking for any Wally Lamb books...

Thank you so much for all of your help and for all your hard work getting these torrents!

Cheers,

I already own paper copies of them all and really don't feel like spending close to a hundred bucks to get the e-book versions.  Thank You."

,rufussondheim,2012-02-21T04:28Z,"John Irving books that are widely distributed are A Prayer for Owen Meany and Laqst Night in Twisted River.

Looking for The World According to Garp and The Cider House Rules mainly, but there are others that would be nice to have like Setting Free the Bears, The Hotel New Hampshire, The 158-Pound Marriage among others."
