I'll comment on quality (as if it's NOT gonna be awesome?) as soon as it's finished downloading. â&#x2DC;Ž"

Anyway... as expected from CoopsUK... it's a high quality rip/encode. A/V 10/10.

Black levels are good & colors are vibrant... & the surround mix is stellar... with plenty of surround & sub-woofer activity.

Thanks again to CoopsUK & the uploader of it here. â&#x2DC;Ž"
