Vampyr (Dreyer, 1932)


With Vampyr, Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyerâ€™s brilliance at achieving mesmerizing atmosphere and austere, profoundly unsettling imagery (The Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath) was for once applied to the horror genre. Yet the resultâ€”concerning an occult student assailed by various supernatural haunts and local evildoers in a village outside Parisâ€”is nearly unclassifiable, a host of stunning camera and editing tricks and densely layered sounds creating a mood of dreamlike terror. With its roiling fogs, ominous scythes, and foreboding echoes, Vampyr is one of cinemaâ€™s great nightmares.
