The source at demonoid still has the 2/15 program as the most recent one, so my hope for a 2/17 program there is fading quickly..."
[T],theburningbush,2012-02-21T23:15Z,"Also, in case anyone here isn't aware of this: 3 video segments from the 2/17 show, as well as the written transcript of the entire program, are available at http://current.com/shows/countdown/episodes/2012-02-17"
