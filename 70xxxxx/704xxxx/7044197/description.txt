"Los Ciegos [The Blind]"

When the whole crew of the Magus goes 
blind due to spores from a tree, lone 
holdout AJ will have to overcome his most 
paralyzing fear to find a cure before the 
blindness becomes permanent. Meanwhile, 
the local Morcego tribe stalks the crew 
and judges whether they are worthy to 
stay in the jungle. If they are deemed 
unworthy, the consequences could be 
fatal.
