The only problem is its compatibility... couldn't play it on my Sony BDP-S370 or my PS3. This has happened to me before with other ViSiON releases.

Still overall a good rip. Thank you froggie100, AMiABLE and ViSiON.

Anyway sorry, but this movie is just one hell of boredom. Good actors, great camera work and nothing more.
I don't give a rat's ass about the fact it's directed by Scorsese. It is NOT a masterpiece at all."
,99jay88,2012-02-25T06:29Z,"Compatibility issues are always going to be an issue, because there just isn't a universal format or codec that always work on every device/software.

I use a program called Xmedia Recode.  There are TONS of preconfigured settings for all kinds of devices. I have found that if I convert/re-encode everything to PS3 720p that it plays back  perfectly on my Xbox 360 (weird) and also works perfectly on iPads when streamed via Seagate GOFlex Home network hard drive.  They also work when streamed to my Sony blu-ray player from the same network drive."
