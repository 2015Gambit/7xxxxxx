This is the 1979 film, Dimenticare Venezia (To Forget Venice). The version contained here is the original Italian version, from a television broadcast and part of the logo of the television channel is visible in the bottom-right-hand corner, but does not affect the image much.
The subtitles included are in English but are not quite synched up to the image - they should be set at -22 (minus twenty-two) seconds, though this sometimes changes by one or two seconds at various stages in the film.

Enjoy.
