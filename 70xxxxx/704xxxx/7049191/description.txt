I have scanned Quran Majeed and then split every page into 3 parts having resolution 320x240 or less . More on every page first line is also last line of previous page for easy link. This can be recited on every mobiles. It is rar file having thirty folders having 30 paras. These folders can be copied to image or picture folder (whatever ur mobile has) and then can be recited by seeing them in image viewer or etc.
