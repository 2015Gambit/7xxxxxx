Paramount Home Entertainment 05/70 DVD Feature Film
R - violence, adult situations



Lord John Morgan (Richard Harris), a British aristocrat, scorns his heritage and goes on a hunting trip in America's West. There, his companions are killed by a Sioux war party, and he is captured. The year is 1825, and these Native Americans have never seen a "white" man before. Morgan is named "Horse" and treated as a beast of burden by the chief's mother, Buffalo Cow Head. He is tutored in the ways of the tribe by another captive, Batise (Jean Gascon).

Realizing that freedom can only be gained in one way, Morgan works his way up the Sioux ladder of success. He wins the heart of the chief's sister, Running Dear (Corinna Tsopei); he gains the respect of Chief Yellow Hand (Manu Tupou) by undergoing the Sun Vow, an ordeal of pain and violence by which the Sioux warrior is honored for his bravery. In the end, he fights with his Sioux brothers against the Shoshones and then leaves with a war party escorting him back to "civilization." His life, however, has been dramatically changed.

A Man Called Horse is a rare piece of historical drama directed by Elliot Silverstein. Minor flaws in the style and storyline do not mar its documentary-like feel. The film's crew went to great lengths to reference every detail of Sioux life and culture, which was validated by Clyde Dollar, a Sioux historian-archaeologist. The outcome is impressive. Meshed with the storyline of the film is an ambitious attempt at anthropological reporting. We view an organized system of beliefs, traditions, and customs characteristic of daily life amongst the Sioux. We are challenged to respond with the British aristocrat to their unusual rituals as well. This fascinating film deserves many viewings to fully absorb its many insights.

*****************************************************************

Full of sincere and earnest portrayals of a people generally presented by Hollywood as brutal savages, these flicks catered to a certain sense of social guilt and succeeded.

But that's not to say A Man Called Horse is push-button or simply reactionary; it's also a fairly compelling little Old West tale in its own right. The story itself couldn't be simpler: a bored and wealthy Englishman finds himself captured by the Sioux Indians. At first he's treated like an animal (hence the "horse" label) and a captive.

Before too long our protagonist meets up with a goofy half-breed who can act as translator, rescues a handful of tribal tots from a certain death, and eventually earns the respect of his former captors.

It's all very socially aware and nature-friendly, and the tale is a worthwhile one indeed. Richard Harris is quite excellent as the captive John Morgan, and he easily keeps the plight of his character a fascinating one throughout.

There are a handful of truly memorable moments (most notably Morgan's final "test" - which is fairly gruesome and technically quite impressive) and Silverstein's camera has a flair for capturing the expansive outdoor settings.

Up until the big masscare finale, of course.

Note: This is almost entirely in Lakota with a bit of pidgin English. However it is very easy to follow and does add a touch of authenticity.
