graphics cards
- Children of rulers now automatically get the appropriate claims when
you start a new game (they don't need to be scripted in)
- Fixed the Steam install script so it won't run every time you start

characters

- Invasion AI: Will now load armies in port when possible, in order to
avoid loading armies onto the wrong fleets

even when he folded

game over
- Ask for ransom interaction can now be initiated with the liege
- Ask to ransom interaction in the diplomacy window now has a proper
title when selecting target
- Rebalanced the initial situation between William, Harald and Harold
- Gave Edward III a claim on France so the 100 years war bookmark will
work correctly
