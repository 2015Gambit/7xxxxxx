,wallmartysec,2012-02-19T02:57Z,Among all the porn and other crappy files here yours is like the diamond  in the sewer... Thanks.
,wallmartysec,2012-02-19T03:02Z,"I just noticed you put them all in a rar, BAD MOVE, some of us like to select what we want, not to be saddled with 4 gigs of stuff, this wont make you popular here..."
,bornone,2012-02-19T16:08Z,I don't mind rars. Can you please seed?
,Helmer2,2012-02-19T23:42Z,Brilliant!
,wallmartysec,2012-02-22T15:08Z,Whats going on? Ive been downloading for three days and Im stuck (like many others) at 98%. This is no way to upload stuff and not seed it.
,bornone,2012-02-23T04:59Z,"I'm 100% and seeding, thanks for the up!"
,mekhaherz,2012-02-24T16:24Z,"It's amazing how people who complain are those that have 0 uploads and those who, as soon as they get what they want, won't seed. Some of you could at least know how to say thanks. "
,tecnocaos,2012-03-06T03:05Z,"Dude, I sign up just to say thank you. That's amazing."
,paoli,2012-03-24T16:28Z,"I register just to say thank you sooo much! It will help me a lot! Your torrent it's a real treasure! The person that said you did a bad move putting all files together is an idiot! I'm sure you don't care for being popular here! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
,polixeno,2012-05-30T22:49Z,"thank you for the file, it would be interesting to create a network of torrent files you need to work with texts. in the coming days I will upload tgl-e with clients to Mac OS. Thank you."
