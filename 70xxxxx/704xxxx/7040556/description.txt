This movie stars the lovely Ms Margherita Buy - the greatest actress of
Italy - ever! (this movie from a decade ago now)

Italian with english subs - enjoy!

The DVD has an incompetently small picture size with a lot of space reserved
for hard coded subtitles instead. A foreign outfit called mikado put this
onto this dvd - we filtered out the annoying oriental musical sound at the start
of this movie in what was their splash screen - as the movie is not of matching cultural content.
