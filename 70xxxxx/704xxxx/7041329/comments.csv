,shawnaldo,2012-02-25T07:18Z,"I'm glad it's back. 

I agree with psspss to a certain degree. Some of the leaps they take to the ancient alien theory are pretty big stretches of the imagination, 

but the thing I love about this show is the mysterious places around the world that we never get to hear about. There's some VERY interesting questions from the past, that modern science hasn't been able to explain. 

To me, that is what the show is all about. 

Dudes, fake tan and crazy hair-do is always good for a laugh too.  :D"

Can anyone provide English subtitles?

I wish documentaries would allways have subtitles like movies."
