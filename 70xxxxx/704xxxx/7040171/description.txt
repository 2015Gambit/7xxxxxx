"Invaluable information about [Malcolm X's] activities and progress as an activist and thinker."â€”The New York Times

The FBI has made possible a reassembling of the history of Malcolm X that goes beyond any previous research. From the opening of his file in March of 1953 to his assassination in 1965, the story of Malcolm Xâ€™s political life is a gripping one. 

Shortly after he was released from a Boston prison in 1953, the FBI watched every move Malcolm X made. Their files on him totaled more than 3,600 pages, covering every facet of his life. Viewing the file as a source of information about the ideological development and political significance of Malcolm X, historian Clayborne Carson examines Malcolmâ€™s relationship to other African-American leaders and institutions in order to define more clearly Malcolmâ€™s place in modern history. 

With its sobering scrutiny of the FBI and the national policing strategies of the 1950s and 1960s, Malcolm X: The FBI File is one of a kind: never before has there been so much material on the assassination of Malcolm X in one conclusive volume. 11 black-and-white photographs.
