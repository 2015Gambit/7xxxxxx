,Camrat,2012-02-20T07:30Z,"@inrltd

Are you retarded or something? Why the fuck would you write that in the comment section of an episode that almost no one has seen yet?"
,intoXy,2012-02-20T07:32Z,":~downloading.........

,bootlegs22,2012-02-20T07:37Z,@ inrltd   thanks for the spoiler u fucking asshole wanker!

,Toby196,2012-02-20T07:54Z,"Thanks VTV.  Great (and speedy) upload!

As to inrldt, go ef' yourself, you stupid jackass.  Why aren't people like him/her banned immediately?  Personally, I'd have them drawn and quartered, just on account of their stupidity."
,Fiirnokx,2012-02-20T08:08Z,What the fuck?!? So Dale was a walker this whole time and Glenn is really Mexican?
,jmeisgodindisguise,2012-02-20T08:28Z,"Rofl why would you guys believe him? Do you honestly think they'd kill a main character like shane 2 episodes into a midseason premier..? As for you, inrltd you're a moron for trolling on a torrent site. Could you have any less of a life?"
,vmart89,2012-02-20T09:32Z,shane doesnt die
,peacetin,2012-02-20T09:53Z,"Hahaha I'm glad I saw the episode before reading that comment from inrltd, but now I hope he says that on every episode torrent so finally when he doesn't say it, is the time Shane dies."
,d-pad,2012-02-20T10:10Z,"wasn't inrltd the same muppet who said Herschel died in last weeks episode comments?

...besides, Shanes on borrowed time anyway - seeing as in the comics he never made it out of the original camp!"
,theeccentrik,2012-02-20T10:13Z,thanks.
,lobo345,2012-02-20T11:05Z,Excellent single file release!

,TheNarrator23,2012-02-20T11:20Z,"If you don't want this spoiled, you'll have to read the comics. It's just like Game of Thrones: there's always a smartass who read the books, and finds it fun to spoil everything."
,Duraax,2012-02-20T12:22Z,CAN EVERYONE STOP FUCKING SPOILING?!
,peachpuppy,2012-02-20T12:28Z,@inrltd - not sure if trolling or serious but thanks a lot... D:
,chapeti,2012-02-20T15:29Z,Gracias cumpita !!
,VivaLaMikey,2012-02-20T15:30Z,@inrltd i signed up specifically to give u a big FUCK U for spoiling the series piss off and get back to sucking your hick dads cock faggot
,CarGun,2012-02-20T15:39Z,"@inrltd

Wow, either you're a complete retard, or you're just a fucking douche. Fuck you. You really don't understand how people don't wanna know that one of the main characters dies before watching the episode? FUCKING ASSHOLE I HATE YPU SO MUCH"
,Billiam94,2012-02-20T16:42Z,"Ok, not sure why he thinks shane is dead, but anyway.... Thanks! and personally, I think they should have killed off Shane before they went to the farm, like they did in the comic. I hope they let Carl shoot him in the neck...... But again, thanks! Can't wait for the next episode.... or the next issue of the comic for that matter"
,Dianthrax,2012-02-20T16:50Z,"First of all Shane doesn't die- and I can say that with certainty even if I haven't seen the episode because I've kept up on interviews/press releases. Plus he's credited with being in 19 episodes (which means all of season 1 and 2.) 

I can also say that it doesn't matter if you've read the comics or not because the show doesn't follow the same storyline or even have the same characters! Example: no Daryl- he was created specifically for Norman Reedus & the show. Plus Kirkman said he wasn't going to stick to the comics & had never intended to. 

But the Shane-Rick-Lori thing is so much a part of the story that they spent so much time setting up; why would they just kill Shane in ep 9 and waste all of that? What would produce drama and tension on the show for the rest of the season?

Also- deliberately leaving spoilers is the kind of thing that will get you sent to the Special Hell; the one reserved for child molesters and people who talk in the theater. "
,tflagger997,2012-02-20T17:38Z,"Yes, THE Special Hell.  The one the AMC execs are going to for firing the writers and the person that brought the TV series into being, and slashing the budget to line their pockets.  

The show is becoming too contrived, trying to go back to the comic storyline since no one else is left that can drive this (better) divergent story.  But anyone that spoils it for those that do not read the comic should be banned from the internet.  There really *should* be a report button at $0.50 cost to pay for the salary of the extra staff.  I would pay to see that j-o's IP range banned."
,boomerl4d,2012-02-20T17:42Z,Finally Shane dies! YEEAH!!
,Holeraw,2012-02-20T18:14Z,"Guys, commenting on something like ""he\ she  dies"" is the same as re-spoiling the show for everyone. No one dies (no one important anyways), get over it. First watch the show, then comment\ repeat it if you feel in a spoiler mood :P"
,coolkick,2012-02-20T19:17Z,seed !
,coolkick,2012-02-20T19:27Z,seed !
,jonnypii,2012-02-20T19:54Z,"since u retards r 2 stupid 2 look it up, I went on imdb and found out that shane is there at least until the end of the season...."
,jonnypii,2012-02-20T19:58Z,shan is not dead. he is in the rest of the season. according to imdb.com...

,salazam1,2012-02-20T21:33Z,"why is everyone hating on shane? he's like the most level-headed of the characters who fully understands the hell that they're all in and is willing to do anything to keep the group safe, everyone else is stuck in la-la land and I hope they all die (except for the white-trash guy)...

Not like I follow the show or anything... I've been rooting for the zombies ever since season 1 episode 2."
,Cheyenne-tgy,2012-02-20T21:47Z,thanks.
,tinnybell,2012-02-21T00:08Z,fuuuuuck all of you and your spoilers. DON'T READ THE COMMENTS TIL YOU WATCH THE EP because of douchebags like them
,Seph87,2012-02-21T00:21Z,I don't understand. What could you possibly gain by spoiling this for others who haven't done anything to you?
,snipestech,2012-02-21T01:53Z,"@inrltd
You are such a miserable Dick!"
,c0ldpr0xy,2012-02-21T03:02Z,"@CarGun

,sahilrox,2012-02-21T14:12Z,"LOL. I am writing this without reading any comments. This tv show is the worst affected by spoilers. 

@VTV Than You."
,harry_tuttle101,2012-02-22T23:18Z,All you guys who went off the deep end are the real wankers.
,twistedl3itch,2012-02-23T14:33Z,"@ Dianthrax, your comment made me LMAO.  You rock.  =)

VTV many thanks for the upload."
,niteboy82,2012-02-24T23:30Z,"If everyone wouldn't have been responding to the idiots that posted the spoilers, I wouldn't have known... nice job."
,jait69,2012-02-25T02:50Z,"The show has largely been pretty consistent with the comics...  so, should it have been a surprise to those who read the graphic novels?"
,Enchained,2012-02-26T04:04Z,WTH??? Did isnt Episode 9 itÂ´s 8 Nebraska Episode... change the title...
