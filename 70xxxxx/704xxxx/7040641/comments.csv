[V],Hackulus,2012-02-18T02:21Z,@bryentheartist I can confirm that its just the sample thats out of sync the movie its self is fine
,elitecrusher,2012-02-18T03:31Z,"Thanx Hack...Love your downloads. Ive gotten like MANY flicks from you and lots of hours of entertainment lol MAKE SURE EVERYONE VOTES FOR RON PAUL THIS YEAR!! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN OUR HISTORY AND OBAMA THE PIECE OF SHIT HAS ALLOWED OUR COUNTRY TO BE HIJACKED by foreign world bankers and he is deliberatly selling us out to be a communist country and shredding our constitution! Do your homework and find out for yourself and find out. SPREAD THE WORD TO EVERYONE THAT U KNOW, VOTE FOR RON PAUL.. HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR LIBERTY AND TAKING THE POWER FROM GOVERNMENT AND GIVING IT BACK TO AMERICANS... And do not be fooled by the press trying to make it look like Ron Paul is at the bottom of the voting polls!! Its a fucking cover up. Hes on top everywhere.. Romney and Gingrich are in the same bed with Obama and part of the elite world government bullshit...If we dont get Ron Paul elected, we are certainly doomed as a country! Visit ""Youtube"" and watch ""THE FALL OF THE REPUBLIC"" and you will see the truth about what are government plans to do behind our backs and is well under way with their plans!! Post the youtube link EVERYWHERE that u possibly can!!"

,PeaceLoveAlyssa,2012-02-18T21:19Z,"Not a BAD version... The Edges are cropped a little too close so sometimes you lose part of the faces, the sound isnt terrible but near the end there is some kinda of ""rustling"" sound... like a potato chip bag sound, but can be over looked. Over all not bad quality for a cam. TYhe movie however is kinda boring.. its not at all what i expected from rachel mcadams and channing tatum....

,f5t5y5,2012-02-22T16:50Z,"video is good, audio is good if you can get past the fact that the person who did this decided to bring their woodworking project to the theater with them"
,theeccentrik,2012-02-24T09:31Z,"@elitecrusher thanks for the star tangled banner lecture. You missed the part where Lehman's bank, who like your president clinton had it's fingers in alot of pies went bust taking the rest of the worlds banks down with it, thanks. American greed plunged the rest of us into global meltdown and all your interested in is voting in the next fuckin imbicile! So much for allies looking after each other! lol twat"
