Straight-laced Atan is the kind of guy who loves to help out his neighbours. He is being haunted by Hantu Cempaka all the time, especially when he's out with his friends Bun, Pet and Mie. Their horror story begins when they end up in a stranger's house and are being treated like kings - but little do they know that they are in a graveyard.
