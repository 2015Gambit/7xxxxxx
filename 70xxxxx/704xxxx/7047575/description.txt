The collection of songs, which Ritter calls his version of lullabies, came from a recent writing session. The songs didnâ€™t fit with the tracks Josh Ritter was writing for his still-untitled forthcoming album. As he described it, the tracks were â€œstrays,â€ but thatâ€™s not all they had in common. Every track on album contains the word â€œdarlingâ€ at some point. In bringing the collection of songs together, Ritter had his title for the EP: Bringing in the Darlings. â€œIt always kind of rolls off the tongue,â€ Ritter told Paste about the reoccurring word. â€œIt certainly fits in the songs, I think itâ€™s a plaintive word. I imagine, what would a cowboy say to a longhorn?â€ To Ritter, the songs felt immediate and â€œsmall,â€ so he wanted to make sure those qualities transferred to the recording process.

Ritter, whoâ€™s known for sonically impressive records like The Animal Years and So Runs the World Away, decided to take a more direct route to record the songs that appear on Bringing in the Darlings. â€œAs time goes on, itâ€™s good to remember that recording is not necessarily a long process,â€ Ritter said. â€œItâ€™s always a fun process, and what youâ€™re trying to do is balance the art form of the recording with the excitement of recording it. I think thereâ€™s a certain spark when somethingâ€™s written and it rolls off the tongue easily, and you can always hear the personâ€™s excitement when itâ€™s happening.â€ The albumâ€™s six songs were recorded in three days in a small studio in Brooklyn called Homeward Sound. As they were recorded, Ritter didnâ€™t really have plans for the tracks, but the idea of a small, surprise release became more and more appealing. â€œSuddenly the songs were here,â€ Ritter said. â€œI thought it would be a really fun project to do something that was secret and was just pick up and go.â€
The songs that appear on Bringing in the Darlings are exclusive to the EP and wonâ€™t appear on Ritterâ€™s forthcoming album.
