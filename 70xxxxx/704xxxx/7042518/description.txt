When the hard-touring country-rock quartet Cross Canadian Ragweed announced last year that they were taking a hiatusâ€”after 9 albums and 15 years on the roadâ€”their cult-like fan base hoped that CCR front man Cody Canada would emerge with a new band, which he did, in the form of The Departed.  The five-man group features the charismatic Canada on lead guitar and vocals; CCRâ€™s superb bassist, Jeremy Plato; blues-rocker Seth James on guitars and vocals; Steve Littleton (from the Tulsa-based Medicine Show) on keyboards; and Dave Bowen on drums.  The Departedâ€™s self-produced debut album, just released, is This is Indian Land, a tribute to Canadaâ€™s â€œRed Dirtâ€ musical heritage in Oklahoma.

 

The 15 songs are covers of Oklahoma songwriters such as J.J. Cale (â€œIf Youâ€™re Ever in Oklahomaâ€), Leon Russell (â€œHome Sweet Oklahomaâ€), Kevin Welch, and members of the Red Dirt scene (Bob Childers, Tom Skinner, Randy Crouch, Scott Evans), all of whom influenced Canada as a budding musician in Stillwater, Oklahoma.  (Littleton penned â€œAny Other Wayâ€ with Brad James while with Medicine Show.)  Canada lived for a while at Childersâ€™ funky Stillwater compound, nicknamed â€œThe Farm,â€  where in the late 1980â€™s and 1990â€™s the Red Dirt Rangers, Jason Boland, Stoney LaRue, Mike McClure and others experimented with the musical genre blending Western swing, blues, honky tonk, and rock, which now characterizes the Austin alt-country scene.

 

But The Departed are not CCR, and This is Indian Land is not entirely alt-country.  The dueling guitars and keyboardsâ€”both new for CCR fansâ€”infuse a bluesy sound that varies from psychedelic (â€œFace on Mars,â€ â€œHold on Christianâ€) to jazz (â€œKickinâ€™ Back in Amsterdamâ€) to Motown/funk (â€œTrue Love Never Diesâ€).    â€œAny Other Wayâ€ and â€œYears in the Makingâ€ recall the early Allman Brothers.  Littletonâ€™s excellent keyboards are showcased on â€œStarinâ€™ Down the Sunâ€ and â€œIf Youâ€™re Ever in Oklahoma.â€ The Departed depart from CCRâ€™s formula in other ways.  The blues ballad â€œWater Your Own Yardâ€ (with harmony vocals by Stoney LaRue) invokes the retro sound popularized by producer T Bone Burnett.  The line-up of This is Indian Land is more versatile than standard CCR fare and accompanists are used to good effect, such as the tasty Dobro work by Geoff Queen and harmony vocals by Jessica Murray on â€œMake Yourself Home.â€  â€œLong Way to Nowhereâ€ features lead vocals by Plato and lead guitar by Reckless Kellyâ€™s Dave Abeyta. But fans of CCR will not be disappointed. â€œBallad of Rosalie,â€ written by Randy Pease, features the familiar sound of Canadaâ€™s rocking guitar and lead vocals. And â€œA Little Rain Will Doâ€ and â€œSkyline Radioâ€ are mainstream alt-country.
