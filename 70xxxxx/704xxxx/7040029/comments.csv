,Smallz94,2012-02-27T01:56Z,give me your email so i can send you my video that is called How to burn a game. I will show you how i burn my game and other stuff. I think you need is the topology data. 
,Smallz94,2012-02-27T02:58Z,actually in the video i forgot to talk about puting in topology data so i have to make a new video about that. send me ur email.
,Smallz94,2012-02-27T03:23Z,lol my bad nevermind i got this all wrong. Just wait until another week until abgx360 verfiy the game. sorry man. 
,n808,2012-02-28T09:10Z,"Despite a flawless burn (as measured by KProbe 2 and Nero Discspeed), my Xbox still refuses to install this, reporting scratched disc. No problems with other recent burns. This is not yet abgx360 verified though. Will retry when verified."
,69Carrot69,2012-02-28T22:13Z,"haha no worries mate, thankyou for trying to help though, 

what does ""abgx360 verified"" mean

i am useless at this stuff haha thanks so much guys :)"
,n808,2012-02-29T06:20Z,I think my Samsung DVD drive is going bad. Same problem on other games as well now. Ignore my previous post.
,Smallz94,2012-02-29T23:13Z,"@69Carrot69
i cnt believe you dont knw that program. lol abgx360 helps the file to be fixed or fix errors in the file.  read more info in abgx . net"
,Smallz94,2012-02-29T23:14Z,"Help ppl  should i reburn this game because i burned the game befor the game came out and before it was verified. Now it is verified, should i reburn or just leave it the way it is?"
,torrentinator69,2012-03-01T03:42Z,This release has a slimy password so thats the first clue. Its a repackage of the japanese release. it has the same crc and does not verify against abgx360 because the abgx360 crc is different. Keep in mind abgx360 lists Binary Domain as unofficial title so I am not sure what that means. Dont waste your time with this and wait for a proper release or abgx to support this crc.
,torrentinator69,2012-03-01T03:52Z,I always thought the source country did not matter in the release because you can change it to be region free. When abgx360 did not verify I thought maybe I was incorrect but giving it more thought I think my original understanding was correct. Anyone know why this does not verify with abgx360? Thanks
,Smallz94,2012-03-01T04:38Z,idk but im afraid to play online. im pretty sure its okay to play online because even though it doesnt verify the game but atleast in the site told us that it is verified..
,webbmagazine,2012-03-02T00:16Z,"when will the Binary Domain for PAL XBOX 360 comes out? it´s the only game that is verified.

Can i play this even if the game it´s not verified?

,Smallz94,2012-03-02T00:56Z,idk i see that the game is verified but when i ran it through abgx360 and didnt recognized it .. thats funny..
,mrstikiller,2012-03-03T03:55Z,HAVE FUN WASTING YOUR TIME....DOESNT WORK ANY WAY YOU BURN IT....SAVE  YOUR DISKS
,Daky1001,2012-03-05T16:34Z,"How am I suposed to burn this?
There is no DVD file,only ISO."
,Smallz94,2012-03-06T04:36Z,"@Daky1001
you need to use abgx360  it will check ur iso for any bugs and it will verify the game. PLUS  it will give you a dvd file.."
,torrentinator69,2012-03-06T17:53Z,"Does anyone know whats going on with a NTSC/US version of Binary domain or a way to convert the existing JAP and what I think is  PAL version to match the crc of the ABGX version? The three version have different checksums and it seems a NTSC US version of Binary Domain was never released. I have tried the imars, caravan, and the RF which is a dupe of the jap release with a password on it. Any help, suggestions or insight would be appreciated."

If this posts more than one time its the AJAX errors from the site. resubmitted more than once."
,parka_boy,2012-06-29T01:14Z,"Well just to clear things out:

The Password is ""telefon"" whithout quotes, no spaces.

The game is region free, confirmed after trying it in a NTSC Us Mexican Xbox and a Pal Spain xbox, both with Lt 2.01 and Lt 3.0 in the case of pal xbox.

Burned Successfully in Liteon 324B with verbatim DL Id:MKM 001 and Sony DL 
Id: MBIPG101-R10-65 so it can be burned using cheap media just flash the media id you need to burn using the proper firmware for that disk id to the dvd writer, and for the noobs yes you need to use this burner otherwise the truncated version will pop you disk dirty errors.

Regarding to abgx and stealth security i have a samsung ms-25 drive so my xbox wont be flagged if its not stealth, according to c4eva:
Samsung currently does not need v3.0 as isn't an AP2.5-capable drive. LT+ v3.0 is only needed for drives which support AP2.5 (Hitachi 78/79, BenQ, Lite-On). ISOs made for v3.0 that include topology data will work fine on Samsung and old Hitachis. In v3.0, the ISO layout hasn't changed, except that there will instead be new topology data in place of where the old AP2.5 replay sector used to be, which Samsung & old Hitachis ignore anyway.

So i dont care about A.P. Checks or at least i had no problems so far so don't get frustrated by other users, burn the game in 2.4x compatible media with an LT Max compatible drive and you will be fine, by the way the speech recognition of this game is shitty with kinect mic."
,Juular,2012-08-01T23:26Z,When I downloaded the game months ago ABGX wouldn't even accept the ISO as a valid 360 game. Regardless I would still use boobman's torrent instead of this one.
