,almog520,2012-02-18T18:31Z,"Why there's B.Walters in the middle of the movie ?
It's driving me crazy :((

,moremetalthanyou,2012-02-18T19:15Z,"there's a big watermark because it's a screener, and watermarks are there to identify it as a screener  because they're illegal to release to the public. Great quality though. "

,priced324,2012-02-18T19:59Z,@ever2fool what 3rd world country are you in.now go out to your outhouse and kiss your ass.
,tommyhawkster,2012-02-18T21:20Z,Watermark makes it almost unwatchable.  Good effort but can't really do much with it. 
,colcaboom,2012-02-18T21:43Z,"does B.Walters stand for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters ???

Damn we are stealing moviez from a old lady... so mean ROFL"
,johnnyathm1,2012-02-18T22:28Z,Hate it for B.Walters...lol...good luck in court.
,TheLastEmperor,2012-02-19T00:52Z,"I just saw the movie in theatres and the water mark is there, too.

 So give the guy his props"
,OldSchoolFart,2012-02-19T00:57Z,"Pity I wasn't warned about the watermark, therefore won't seed."
,TtToker,2012-02-19T02:49Z,"Pity we have Douche Bags like OldSchoolFart on here that can't just be a huge dick about a detail that is found in almost every comment but he has to announce how much of an ass he intends on being. Just like the Super 8 leak with H Stearn, I'm very disappointed in the ripper of this torrent and the uploaded for not protecting the identity of the person whom made this available. Every time you openly share the Identity of the source you burn bridges, now B Walters will never loan a screener out again if she ever receives one again, but when this hits the news like Super 8 did, it will only make everybody else think twice before sharing a screener. So by being too lazy to crop a bit or taking a short amount of time to blur the watermark, you've fucked another great source, and by doing so you've fucked the whole community.  But yeah, give the guy his props and making jokes about the source of which the movie came and no future films will ever come from again."
,tadavis42,2012-02-19T04:13Z,The source could be anyone in one of the guilds or film unions and they know the risk when loaning these out. There are warnings plastered all over the screeners to not copy and to destroy after viewing. They know the risk they are taking. Alot more than just some burnt bridges is going to happen to them. Sucks
,xniggler,2012-02-19T04:36Z,"""the grey watermark"" in the middle of the screen , in ultra large... useless copy..."
,ajnsd,2012-02-19T05:10Z,"I have to agree with one of the above--posters. The Watermark is not that bad. It is relatively translucent. The operative term being relatively. It will still bother a few people, but not as much as B. Walters. 

But considering some of the CAM quality movies regularly uploaded, this is far better. 

A: 8.5
V: 8.5"

U bitches act like all these uploaders are here to provide for u when really its called file sharing for a reason, cuz everyone is suppose to look out for everyone and upload their files too! As for the name in the middle of the screen that is barely noticeable thru the movie, not one person knows who that person is and for all u know somebody dug this screener outta someones trash and then uploaded it for free to everyone!! Be thankful that there is a good copy out this quick rather then the crappy cam copies that was out!!! "
