I see that you made 1 little mistake, but no problem :)"
,Kokua651,2012-02-23T14:26Z,Wow whole series in 1080p. The best available quality for the size :)
,coke84,2012-03-02T14:40Z,This is the special edition with new scenes and cgi effects.
,coke84,2012-03-02T16:38Z,"..and to add to that; the new, altered editions are the only ones available on bluray.

Perfect quality on this upload, 10/10"

Can someone explain why I can't get the subs to work and if it's possible to make them work on my PS3?"
[V],Zen_Bud,2012-04-09T16:28Z,"@kdryan2 Try here to find solution, good luck :)

,royboy2012,2012-04-30T09:33Z,very quick download great a10 v10 well done thats to all six movies
,lastjedi,2012-05-04T21:40Z,ugh did you have to make the audio AAC.damn!i use avs video converter and they don't accept aac.i can't put that on disc using aac.there is no audio.and if i download the codes for aac it still doesn't work because it comes out out of sync.why couldnt you use ac3.now i gotta look for another 108 source that isnt aac.
,gaspah_1981,2012-05-13T08:37Z,"Damnit, whats the point in 1.33gb 1080p? Especially for epic movies like Star Wars... You'd be much better getting a 5gb 720p or a real size ~12-15gb 1080p release. fks sake i'd prefer a well encoded anamorphic x264 DVD-rip to this crap.

When will people realise that resolution isn't everything, compression artifacting makes these movies look like cat vomit. I'm so sick of them clogging up my search results.

I mean seriously what are you people waching these movies on your fkn phones or some crap.

I'm not having a go at the encoders who provide this free service, rather at you retarded users that make this crap popular. Go out and buy yourselves a real TV for your computer."

Download this if you want it with good quality. I haven't downloaded it yet, but am now. Will comment again here about the quality when done."

"
,FireStricker,2012-05-14T10:17Z,Thank you. Video quality is really good.
,TaiTheGuy,2012-06-22T11:37Z,"Very good quality. Especially considering the size!

I had to turn up the gamma and the contrast just a little tiny bit- that made it look even better & more vivid- (on my 32"" LCD plugged into laptop)."
,grillzey,2012-07-03T15:30Z,"thank you! great quality ! super quick download, everything perfect!

played on VLC player on Acer Aspire one netbook easily.

Awesome, will seed for sure. thanks"
,Zeekpirate,2012-07-10T20:23Z,How can I get hardsubs for Jabba's and Greedo's dialogue? I'd prefer to not have to turn subtitles on for those scenes (and read Han's dialogue which I already understand) and then turn it back off. It interrupts the experience.
,bloodred125,2012-07-15T02:29Z,"@ gaspah, its also 39 friggin BG's...be cheaper to BUY them than download. Some people only have 120Gb's per month lol."
,tmn8,2012-08-05T16:12Z,"awesome quality! Just perfect and I like how you can choose what subtitles you put on it (just translators, or all spoken words). Definitely something you would want simply to collect, these copies are flawless"
,hej123123,2012-08-28T01:49Z,"WARNING: this is NOT the original, but the digitally remastered edition, with all the horrible cgi sequenses and where han doesn't shoot first. 

if, you are fine with that, sure, it's a good upload. otherwise, i strongly recommend harmys despecialized edition for a HD version of the original cut."
,carlmb1,2012-09-03T04:10Z,"Zen_Bud, do you have the phantom menace? i cant seem to find your upload of it."
