     Here you have it, every single show Bill Cooper ever did on his radio station in MP3 form. 

     It took awhile but, I put together all of his shows, and categorized them by month, and year, and also provided a list of all of the descriptions of each video, cataloged via the video number in a text file so you can look up specific shows, or dates. this is everything from his debut in 1993, to his murder in 2001. Enjoy. Please Share this! In every way you can think!
