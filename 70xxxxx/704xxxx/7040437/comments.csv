1.install the game.
2.don't run the game.
3.go to the directory whr its being installed.
4.find settings.xml.
5.open it with notepad.
6.change the screen res to ur native dekstop res.like i changed the values to 1368 and 768.
7.save it inside the same directory.
8.run the game frm dekstop and enjoy!!! :)"
,sr2005,2012-03-14T11:59Z,I have downloaded and install the game and also apply the fix mentioned by some other members.The game also runs fine but the problem is that after clicking the 7554.exe the game starts after almost 25 minutes.Does anyone have any fix.Iam using windows 7 32 bit.Ihave 4gb ddr2 ram and 9800 nvidia gt video card.Nice game though.It really revives some good old memories of the Call Of Duty series.
,sr2005,2012-03-14T21:09Z,"Iam so sad to see that even Vietnam also make such a decent fps games on their historical warfare but India still today doesnot able to made a single game on Indian Army and India's historical warfare like Kargil battle of 1999,1971 battle etc........"
,elzondro,2012-04-03T22:55Z,i have downloaded this game from another site but it requires a code can anyone help?
,Taskerr,2012-04-23T09:12Z,Doesn't work it say the application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect editing settings.xml doesn't help.
