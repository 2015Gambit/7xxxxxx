,bert2006,2012-02-18T18:40Z,"from the trailer it just seems like a rip-off of buried,
downloading anyway, will comment again after"
,ranktank,2012-02-19T01:46Z,whats the rating A? V?
,spifkitten99,2012-02-19T02:00Z,"People, no need to comment about what you think about the movie. Do that stuff on imdb.

Here we just want to know how the video and audio quality is."
,dfl3506,2012-02-19T02:46Z,"I don't mind someone giving their opinion on the movie, I still check with IMDB as well for their rating. If all we wanted was the Audio and Video quality, it would only require one comment per movie."
,marcman951,2012-02-19T11:13Z,"agree with dfl3506.
I also like to read about comments regarding the movie itself.
A 10
V 9
M 8 Pretty good movie. Obviously has similarities to buried but in a good way. "
,spifkitten99,2012-02-19T12:48Z,"@dfl3506, no that's not true, because people have way different perceptions.

Some rate 10 to anything that is just watchable, some rate really lol, for the tinniest faults, and others have a more realistic rating.

So we need many people to tell us, so we can get a better average picture, and can see that the one guy that said it was total shit quality was not trustworthy, cuz all others said it was good quality. (or visa versa)"
,spifkitten99,2012-02-19T12:50Z,"Decent quality.

Nothing like DVD rip of course, but definitely watchable.

,kriptikchicken,2012-02-19T15:03Z,I don't trust mentally high reviews on IMDB wit fairly unknown films as you don't know whether they are written by bias folk connected to the movie.
,dano9700,2012-02-20T04:11Z,"I agree with kriptikchicken, that seems to happen a lot, and it seems rather desperate on their part. Usually the truth comes out after more people see and rate the movie."
,Alesum,2012-02-20T22:46Z,"Decent copy. Enjoyable movie.

A:9
V:8
M: 6.8 IMDB: No Rating Yet

Thanks for the up!"
