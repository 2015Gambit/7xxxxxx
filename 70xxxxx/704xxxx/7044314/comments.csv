,bluesborn,2012-02-24T07:22Z,"Nice copy.As has been noted already use VLC ""crop"" to get rid of watermark I encourage folks to check out TV version.While this is well worth watching I prefer the original which is extremely scary in places and follows a slightly different storyline."
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-02-26T05:12Z,This has the same blown out audio as the others.  Way too loud source has caused distortion.  I'd wait.
,flashman47,2012-03-03T03:47Z,"anyone wanting this film without the watermark, d/load the version from refill sorry hackulus but thought people would like to know"
,RaveHippie,2012-03-03T06:38Z,after u crop it to get rid of the watermark is there a way to get it back to full screen also?
,rick216,2012-03-03T11:42Z,rubbish!!! plays but is just a black screen. Never had this problem with any of my downloads before. what a waste of my time!!!

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 705 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc"
,MaRicoTa,2012-04-15T19:55Z,Where can I get EN subtitles? 
,PirateBrowser,2012-04-28T07:58Z,Can't help laughing at people who gives a dvd screener a 10 in video quality. Only a bluray can get a 10. You people need to watch some good quality so you can understand that this is NOT good quality. I believe in Movie_Guy who gave it an 8. Sounds doesn't matter that much as long as it isn't bad.
