This torrent only contains the trail edition and the so called ""activation"" is a link to a bullshit website which requests you complete a survey, give your mobile phone number (so the activation code can be sent to it) and the small print on the website mentions signing you up as a member for a fee of $13 every 2 days! What a joke!"
