Following his Billboard charting â€˜somebody Loves Youâ€™ (2009), austin Lucas is proud to release his fourth full length album and recording debut for Last Chance Records; â€œa New home In The old Worldâ€ (2011).
Raised in the backwoods of monroe County, Indiana, austin Lucas was born into a folk and bluegrass lineage. Building upon an instrumental palate of banjo, fiddle, upright bass, and pedal steel, a New home In The old World ratchets the sound up to the next level, adding texture with a hammond B3 organ, the brassy flourishes of a trumpet, and muscle courtesy of electric guitar. The album features studio accompaniment from a rotating cast of friends and family, including members of alt-country heavy-hitters Lucero and magnolia electric Co., and no less than four members of the Lucas clan.
The songs themselves are the most diverse Lucas has offered to date, pushing past the confines of singer-song- writer genre convention. singing with the conviction of a preacher bereft of his faith, Lucas accordingly tackles recurrent themes of the soul; sin as personal purgatory; and the possibility of finding redemption in this life.
