Plot:
A Thai reinterpretation of ic0nic Japanese film Rashomon. Set during the Lanna period, a mysterious murder takes place in the woods. But itâ€™s not the killing itself that sparks the controversy but the strange trial that ensues where the event is told from the different perspective of three witnesses; a monk, a woodcutter and an undertaker. With contradicting versions of what happened, the classic story explores time-honoured themes like truth and morality amidst difficult circumstances.
