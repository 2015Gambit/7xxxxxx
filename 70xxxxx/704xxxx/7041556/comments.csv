,lattari,2012-02-19T10:28Z,"I just wanted to post my appreciation for your work. Your uploads have so far been always of top quality. I watch my downloads with a 32"" TV. Somehow your bluray uploads look just as good as much larger versions. I also appreciate you keeping our scandinavian productions available. Keep up the good work!!!! "

,spankdaddy,2012-03-04T15:23Z,"I got no sound from all 3 of the movies within this trilogy. I have aprox.. 800 downloads and only a few have had no sound on my machine. My point being is i was quite thorough in codecs and this is a rare issue that pops up so I do not recommend this download, I'm very sorry, thank you for your upload but I'm affraid this will happen to many others."

,Skuzkid,2012-03-21T19:13Z,"@spankdaddy
it happened to me too, did you find anyway to fix it?"
,candyman3001,2012-03-22T20:07Z,"A/V 10/10.. fool proof and 100% working,
@skuzkid and spankdaddy, the video works just fine, although i'll have to admit that sound is bit low but that is not peta's fault, it's low in the movie too. try to get correct codecs. I am a newbie and dunno much about codecs and stuff so i cant be of much help to u. however, u may ask peta fox via his/her forum: http://petafox.ace.st/
peta fox u rock mate.. :)"

,tuckerss,2012-05-15T01:12Z,"Getting no sound on the sample either.
Make sure to check the sample before you download the whole thing as you might download all 7GB and be painfully disappointed.
Very unfortunate indeed."
