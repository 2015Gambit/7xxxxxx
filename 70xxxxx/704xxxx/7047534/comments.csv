[V],GunningHawk90,2012-02-21T14:39Z,"@vinayfre, I don't see any Green skull beside your name, so shut the fuck up. Do you think I enjoy not seeding my own torrents? It's ppl like you who make uploaders think twice before uploading torrents.

To all the others, I'm really sorry, my broadband connection went down 20 mins after I uploaded this torrent, so I couldn't seed for a while."
,lolraju,2012-02-22T06:22Z,thnx a lot man...
,pragette1,2012-02-23T07:23Z,"Thanks for your great uploads!
Does somebody here at TPB has RSS for Season 7, so that my torrent-client can download the latest episode itself, when uploaded? Or do people not really use that feauture? I just read about it :)"
