[T],iamgreat,2012-03-13T18:53Z,"For anyone who looks to play this in VLC 2.0 please know that it is not compatible due to some change in VLC between version 1.1.11 from July 2011 and version 2.0 from February 2012. And sadly i no longer have the .ts file so i can't re-do it. You will have to watch in an older version of VLC or another programme or hope VLC restores the compatibility in an upcoming release.   

This issues affects most every release of mine from late December 2011 through the Alcatraz ep 8 web-dl  but was fixed for the repack of that Alcatraz episode. This issue does not affect releases from others which i have simply uploaded or obviously my FLAC releases."
