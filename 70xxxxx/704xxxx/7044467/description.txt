Farm Girl is well known for her "green thumb". Everything she planted on her farm grows and thrives. But now there is a new challenge: Building a farm along the Nile! Establish a farm at the edge of the pyramids! Completely new conditions require completely new management on the farm under the Egyptian's sun. You need to adept your manufacture and your offerings to the current marketing situation Â– how about growing papyrus or an ostrich farm? Sandstorms, water shortages or annoying crocodiles from the Nile shouldn't prevent you from building up a premier farm.
Don't just watch about your current facilities, invest in new technologies, too.
