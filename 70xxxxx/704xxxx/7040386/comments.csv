,neeliesu,2012-02-19T13:57Z,"Thanks as always to albiondean :) For the first time I'm having a problem playing this episode on my DivX, I think it's because it's MP4 format, can anyone tell me if I can convert it  so I can burn it to a disc and play on the DivX, an idiot's guide would be welcome :) Thanks.
