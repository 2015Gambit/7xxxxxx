Description: A comic strip about adolescence, culture, politics, sexuality, religion, psychology, and our basic humanity.

Praise: â€œâ€˜Life of Poetâ€™ is the best comic strip about kids since â€˜Calvin and Hobbes.â€™ Christopher Wilson accurately recalls the pain and awkwardness of childhood and views it with an adolescentâ€™s warped sense of absurdity and an adultâ€™s wisdom. He avoids the usual clichÃ©s of the genre and discovers startling truths. Itâ€™s great therapy for anyone who had to endure being young, which I think is pretty much everyone. Above all itâ€™s screamingly funny.â€
Richard Thomas, Editor,

â€œTopical, thoughtful and sarcastic social commentary without the overt political overtones which are the usual mainstay of the alternative press. Plus, he buys all his clients free drinks at the conventionsâ€¦.â€ .

â€œThe Invisible Life of Poet is without question the greatest comic strip of the modern age - this is not opinion, this is fact. Christopher Wilsonâ€™s genius is unparalleled in his field, and in all other fields.â€
