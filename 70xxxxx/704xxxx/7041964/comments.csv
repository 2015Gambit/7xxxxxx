,marick626,2012-02-22T17:57Z,"Is anyone having issues? Airports have problems depending on the order they are on the custom scenery list. In other words, if LFHU is at the bottom of the custom scenery, it appear as if the mesh is appearing over the runway in the form of a great peak at the beginning of the runway. If I put it at the top of the list the issue goes away, but then, for example, LFKX becomes bugged with similar issues. Any help? "
,johnnie47,2012-03-06T16:56Z,how to get the surrounding photo scenery? These airports are not the whole package.
