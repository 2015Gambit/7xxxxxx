[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

Join us this week for a special edition of our show from Washington, D.C. in front of a spirited crowd of 1,000 college students at the annual Students for Liberty Conference.

David Boaz from the Cato Institute and Nick Gillespie from Reason TV will stop by to take the student's questions and discuss how the future for freedom is bright.

These young liberty lovers will also grill our guest panel, which includes the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton . We will debate how the U.S. should react to the possibility of a nuclear Iran and other national security issues.

Ken Klukowski from the Family Resource Council will take the stage to defend social conservative stances against abortion and same-sex marriage.

Finally, comedian Tim Hawkins shines some light on what government can do for us with a satirical song.

Tune in tonight at our new time, 9pm, on the Fox Business Network.
