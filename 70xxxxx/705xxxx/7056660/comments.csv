,Movieboob,2012-02-25T07:39Z,How do we download if you don't seed your own torrent?
,Nigmanigma,2012-02-25T07:48Z,"Bought the dvd and the rifftrax commentary track, but that shit was too fucking complicated for my stoned brain when I tried setting it up a few minutes ago.  This is easier and thus superior.  You know, assuming the volume levels are good and stuff."
,Movieboob,2012-02-25T08:35Z,"Ok, thank you."
,jericho_cane,2012-02-25T08:40Z,"What the hell are you talking about, movieboob? I'm seeding at about 200 kb/s."
,jericho_cane,2012-02-25T08:45Z,"Sorry, boob, didn't see your last comment :)"
,greist6,2012-02-26T10:20Z,"The seed is good, and the quality of the movie is very good.

but

If anyone is willing to direct me to the correct software, I am willing to re-do this and other riffs with proper narration track attenuation.

A soft that can do it as a choose-able second audio track would be all the better

I now marry Rifftrax to movies for myself using Adobe CS 5 Premiere and Soundbooth, but attenuation do-able but laborious.

If there is a better software, please let me know. I really would like to redo, THIS movie, Birdemic, Thor, the recent Batman, (a few others as well) to the same quality as whoever did The Room or Titanic.

Riffed movies with the
- too loud to hear what the Riffers are making fun of- problem are really disappointing

I will post the results for all to enjoy."
,greist6,2012-02-26T11:02Z," BTW No offense intended in all this Jericho.

I've seen the other movies you've posted, and honestly, you have really good taste in movies."
,jericho_cane,2012-02-26T11:08Z,"Really? I didn't have a problem with the audio, but if your hearing is just that sensitive, you can edit it with Audacity or GoldWave. 

Looking forward to your improved versions! :)"
,nonalined,2012-04-22T00:13Z,When I try to open the file in realplayer nothing happens?
,alxonfyr,2012-04-27T02:52Z,"I use Audacity and Avisynth/Avidemux or MKVtools depending on the format.

Audacity has auto-ducking and independent track volumes, which gets rid of the wash-out problem between the two tracks, and those encoding programs are both open-source and allow you to create multiple audio tracks, if you want one file with and without the riff.

Disclaimer: I hope everyone is buying the riff. Torrents are super-convenient, but if you don't support the artists we will keep getting crappy shorts instead of the movies we want!"
,bryentheartist,2012-06-07T07:53Z,shit talks over the dialog
,jericho_cane,2012-07-07T09:37Z,"Too bad you didn't read the description or bother to ask yourself what ""rifftrax"" was before downloading the file. Either you're trolling or you're a colossal dumbass. "

,ZebTheCyClops,2012-08-26T15:00Z,how the hell is there suddenly NO RIFFTRAX with this movie?
