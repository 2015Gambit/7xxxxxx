NOTES:
 
Sources:
Video ...pretty dam nice,but whacked perspective,lots of video noise,tops of subs across the bottom now and then,touch dull
and lack of contrast ....but mega props for getting these so :clap:
Audio ...some pretty decent line ...some noise to it and a touch overpowering,but all good ;-)
 
 
Workdone:
Right shitloads...lots to try and correct the best we could.First we tackled the perspective,for this used the filter in vdub and
pulled the left side to level up the video.From there i had to crop a few pixels off the left and also opted to crop the top of the subs
than remained across the bottom.
Now i fixed the AR and changes the res to the nearest mod16 ...not rescale it back up.
Then cleaned the noise up the best we could without taking too much detail out of it and then onto the brightness,contrast,chromam and sharpen
all increased too better levels.
Oh also opted to change the rgb colours slightly ....nothing major on that.
Then it was just the audio i just had to sync ...few cuts here and there and a little stretch and hey presto.Once synce i saved and cleaned the
audio up in AA,changing the EQ bands and light hiss removal.
 
Readnfo:
Well mainly too point out that i have cropped some off the left and bottom and to also say that the colours do slightly change throughout,so went
for a decent medium.oh and also the cam does slightly move now and then so the perspective,whilst alot better does dift a little in parts,but not a
fat lot and does kick back in :)
 
And yes its well late :lol: but been busy on other projects,but quality always shines through ;-)
