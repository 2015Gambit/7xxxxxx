Subtitles: EN
Date: 2012.02

Director: James Gray

Genres: Crime | Drama

Plot:
This film tells a bitter tale of a dysfunctional family. Joshua, a cold-blooded professional
killer, returns to his Brighton Beach boyhood home for a "job." He knows it will be difficult to
return to the Russian-immigrant community of his youth--in his eyes, we see anticipation of the
inevitable emotional pain and psychic turmoil that seeing his forsaken family and estranged
companions will bring him. To do his job, and try to maintain some semblence of sanity, he has
had to wall off his humanity from even himself. Seeing his kid brother, who adores him, talking
with his dying mother, who still loves him, and yes, arguing with his abusive father, begins to
wreak havoc with his personal defenses. As his steely demeanor begins to dissolve, we are shown
the soul of a hit-man crumbling away, piece by piece. Finally, all that he now allows himself to
admit that he loves is agonizingly torn away from him and he is left with the ultimate punishment
for his transgressions.
