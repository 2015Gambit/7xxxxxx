,zakimar,2012-02-26T22:41Z,"PS. Thanks for the 700 MB version and people can download the sample first to check for themselves.

And DO NOT download uTorrent 3.1.2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every file downloaded gets you a poker SPAM connection and the entire download page has been changed and no longer provides info like when the file began downloading, was completed, how many people are seeding..."
,burn429,2012-02-26T23:12Z,i have 3.1.2 and i haven't seen anything different so far.
,Jakeler,2012-02-26T23:59Z,I dont think the adds are because of Utorrent pretty sure its because of Thepirate bay.
,Kole97,2012-02-27T09:21Z,for those wondering what's this movie about- here's Trailer for this movie - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7060470/Goon_Official_Trailer_[HD]_2011___K97
,Vince82,2012-02-28T04:54Z,"Kole97, you never heard of youtube?  Why would i waste time downloading a trailer when i can watch it straight?"
,Avatar666,2012-02-29T01:37Z,"Whats ""m"" zakimar ?"
,DaYgon76,2012-02-29T13:43Z,"I think what he is talking is now you can no longer download the torrent file you have to use a magnet link. Magnet link doesn't let you choose the files in the torrent you want to download, you have to get them all instead of say, just the sample file. This seems to be a change on the piratebay site. Not sure why. I much prefer to download the torrent file and choose what files are downloaded from the torrent.. The ads and poker page have always been there."
,suckitdry,2012-02-29T14:33Z,they changed to magnet link to avoid lawsuits. but sadly im too stupid to get it to work :( keep clicking it but nothing happens 
[V],neon,2012-02-29T20:09Z,"all questions about magnet links are on the piratebay forum

,rdfilms,2012-02-29T20:58Z,"hi,someone can upload full dvd or french rip version? thanks!"
,kcc02,2012-03-02T01:23Z,"A: 10
V: 8
Seems to be missing a part, but not sure. It's a pretty good movie. "
,Rage_44,2012-03-04T14:50Z,Fast download A-9 V-9 M-9
,sammyboblammy,2012-03-06T01:25Z,"@zakimar the reason your UTorrent looms different is because the newest version starts in a different view. Change that with the buttons on the top right that look like ITunes and it will go to the older view. Then you can see your SE and LE.
@neon thanks again best version Out there"
,EhBud,2012-03-06T10:48Z,Great quality for this early in the game 
,pleaseseedguys2199,2012-03-08T17:39Z,this should be at the top. great movie
,whymichael,2012-04-14T15:00Z,Absolutely great movie!
,resmith,2012-04-16T23:23Z,A / V 10 Great quality. Anyone else hate these magnetic torrents where you can't see what your downloading & have no choice? 
,betume,2012-05-13T14:29Z,"It´a little more trouble but , put the torrent on top of your list , await to it star and then choose whatever you want to download and not , you can also set priorities . It´s not the best way , but you don´t need to wait the download to finish to see what you ´ve got."
