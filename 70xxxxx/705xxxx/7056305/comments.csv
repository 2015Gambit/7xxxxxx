,nr14,2012-07-22T14:23Z,"This is pretty bad, why don't you have an installation guide? 
What was that '!![something].exe'? All it did was mess with the screen simulating the effect of not having any video drivers and causing the anti-virus to go haywire making me remove it.
Great, now I can't do basically anything that involves important information (such as typing in passwords) until someone says just what the hell that was."
,Vicktius,2012-07-22T16:58Z,"Great torrent, clean. Works well. Some cool music in the keygen as well."
,Blackfile,2012-07-23T14:19Z,"@nr14 I think it just made your graphics driver crash. Also, cracked .exe files are usually picked up as a 'virus' by your anti-virus program. It's nothing to worry about. Just add the file to exceptions"
,Linus371,2012-08-17T22:39Z,"Downloading at 5-6Mb/s.
Love the speed.
Going to install now, I'll leave a comment if it's legit :P"
