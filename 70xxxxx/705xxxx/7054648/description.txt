The At0mic mission is to bring more film commentaries to the file sharing scene. They are few and often difficult to find. I have a bunch that I have collected over the years. I will be releasing them in batches over the coming weeks. I hope I can inspire others to share the other commentaries they have in their collection.

Film commentaries offer unique insight into the film-making process. They allow directors, actor, and other members of the production to share inside information on what it took to make the film and film-making in general. This makes film commentaries an invaluable resource for film enthusiasts and students who wish to know what it takes to make a movie straight from the horses mouth.

Up until now there hasn't been any concerted effort to include commentaries in uploads. I urge sharers out there to include the commentary track in the rips they make and advertise them as such.
