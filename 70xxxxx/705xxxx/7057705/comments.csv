  when you finish downloading, you will see an '.iso' file.(it's 'sr-syndicate.iso') this is called 'image'. burning means, you can make this 'image' a DVD.mounting is easier right now so you need a program for this.i'm using Power Iso.(there is also Daemon Tools, Magic Iso, pick the one you want) when you right click on 'sr-syndicate.iso' there will be an option Power Iso. Power Iso > click > Mount Image to Drive ['letter':] > click.
   now you have mounted the game .iso file. go to 'Computers' and you will see the game installation CD is there. double click or right click,  then open . i guess there will be a 'setup.exe', click this. i don't know game installation menu, there must be options like 'Next' , 'I accept the agreement' , 'Browse(for game installation folder, change it if you want to install to D: drive or another)'. click these and install the game. it's now 80%, when i finish downloading the game, i describe the install part more properly.."

,r083r73h,2012-02-26T19:09Z,"@Dermora

The game itself is just the same, the difference lies in how the game is configured to run without SecuROM, EA-Core and Origin. For users, the difference is small. The game runs just as well regardless of version. But SKIDROW is a leading force and they frequently update their games. So would choose this version."

,chuckdm,2012-02-28T17:24Z,"Ok, first things first - this release works flawlessly out of the box on XP x64.  Just install (or rather, extract) and copy the crack, done.  And if you're trying to play games on a dedicated gaming rig that isn't running XP x64 (such as Win7, XP 32 bit, etc.) then don't complain - you're just using the wrong damn tool for the job.

As for the game itself, I just want to say that I am not a loremaster.  That is, I don't read comic books, I don't watch cartoons (besides SouthPark) and I don't read fiction books.  If I'm not playing a game, I'm either watching a cop drama or, yanno, working for a living.  As a result, I read 12 reviews before I wasted bandwidth on this, and yanno what they all told me?  A massive load of jack squat.  All that anyone had to say was ""well it mangles the lore pretty badly but it's a solid shooter.""  As someone who doesn't give a flying fuck about the lore (because I never played the original) all that matters to me is the shooter aspect, and I have to tell you, if THIS piece of shit is your idea of a GOOD FPS, I have a gold mine I want to sell your stupid ass for $10.

The breach mechanic in this game is retarded.  All breaches take 2 seconds or less, yet they all have a tiny little sweet spot that's about 1.7s in.  Optimally, you hit that exact spot and the breach lasts longer.  Of course, I am not a goddamn robot, so I can't hit that magical spot, instead I do the full length 2 second breach and have to re-breach the same fucking target like 5 times.

This wouldn't be a problem, except that every fucking time there's a ""zerg level"" (i.e. bunch of weak enemies where the only viable strategy is to kill them all as soon as they spawn) they ALL have fucking shields you have to breach.  At one point you have to kill almost 20 of these little drones at once.  If it was just 1 drone, you could kill it with 7-8 bullets, and you could let the damn thing shoot you point blank indefinitely - it literally damages you at the same rate as your health regenerates.  The problem is, with 20 of the fuckers flying around, none of the available cover will deflect fire from more than half of them, and 10 of these fuckers will kill you in about 5 seconds.  Now, if it takes 2 seconds EACH to breach them, then another 2 seconds of gunfire, basic math tells us it is literally fucking scientifically IMPOSSIBLE to kill even half of them before they kill you.  I finally got a trainer just to pass the level - I have no clue how anyone would survive it otherwise.  The best part?  This was on fucking EASY!

So yeah, pretty bad game.  As someone who never played the original and got ALL my back story from the game itself, I actually totally loved the lore - it's very well written and convincing, even if it isn't incorporated directly into the game play very well.  (Also no clue how the Japanese now totally own LA, but whatever...)  Frankly, I think every reviewer got this dead wrong.  It's got good lore but it's a fully incompetent shooter - to the point where the game is effectively just one big bug."
,Mahoraba33,2012-02-28T19:40Z,"So there's this glitch that basically makes you unable to continue to the game, for any reason. Mission 12 as you start the mission you are being let out of a Drop Ship, seems simple enough right?

Wrong, The devs thought it was a good idea to make it so that you couldn't simply WALK out of the Drop ship, instead it tells you to press W to make your character do a leap out of the drop ship in an almost acrobatic manner, which is all fine and dandy till you know, he does this acrobatic move and FALLS INSIDE THE FUCKING DROP SHIP AND IS THEN STUCK INSIDE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

There was some one else with this problem that suggested changing my resolution to 800x600 cause it fixed it for him, well I thought, some one with the same problem as me I'm in luck. Nope, no luck for me because it didn't fucking work and I'm still spending time in Drop Ship jail no matter how many times I restart the mission no matter how many button I FUCKING SPAM while/after i hit W.

No matter what I do nothing fixes it and I cannot continue on with the story. Oh, and to top it off I wasn't even fucking looking at the surroundings for the most part because I was too busy spam hitting my jump key with other things to get out but when I turn around I see this Garage Door with the words ""I'm free in all the ways that you're not"" painted on.

If that's not a kick in the teeth from a Dev prank to like every pirate, playing this game then I don't know what is.

P.S. Fuck you drop ships. If anyone has any idea how to fix this, share?"

,tiz2,2012-02-29T16:31Z,"@ chuckdm: It doesn't even sound like we've been playing the same game. I got the hang of hitting the sweet spot on breaches within the first hour of playing, and I beat it on hard on my first playthrough. I can't recognize any of the problems with the gameply you mention. It was just hard enough to still be challenging, considering the vast array of weapons at your disposal. Many fights became a beautiful ballet of headshots, brain-hacks, and broken necks, once you realize you are pretty much Neo in the Matrix and 3 enemies does't necessarily warrant the firing of a single shot, just kill them with your bare hands. I guess you just need to l2p."

,tiz2,2012-02-29T16:38Z,"@chuckdm: Btw, hitting the sweet spot on breaches does not make them last longer, but apart from saving time a perfect breach (breach spike) triggers an adrenaline release, providing extra fuel for your Dart chip and making all hacks available faster. Just one more thing you are wrong about.  "
,chuckdm,2012-02-29T18:17Z,"@tiz2 I read everything you said and...no.  Thankfully, I managed to find the god mode cheat and solved all my issues, so thanks for all your help.  Now on to more pressing matters...

Right after you breach the bigass vault door, you enter a room where you have to fight...oh wait...

SPOILER ALERT

Ok so...where you have to fight the other agent you've been working alongside, as well as 2 emo twin chicks or something.  He launches some type of MIRV (idk what it is since it's not the same as the launcher used earlier...) and destroys the platform you're on.  At this point, you fall down to a lower patform and, I presume, start to fight the jealous prick.

In my case, the game effectively stops.  I mean, it's still running, and I can still look around, but I cannot move in any direction, cannot jump, and my gun refuses to fire (it WILL zoom AND change modes, just not fire, despite full ammo.)

My assumption is that the dude is supposed to jump down and try to manually beat you down or something, but alas, I sat there for 7 minutes and nothing happened.

So...big mistake...I alt-tabbed out and killed the game.  Now, when I try to ""continue campaign"" it goes through the loading screen and, immediately when it should finish loading, I get a MS C++ Runtime Error that says ""This application has requested the runtime to terminate it in an
unusual way.""

I have seen many people who get this error when they FIRST start the game, but nobody else seems to get it on just one level.  I can also go back to a chapter select and play any other chapter, but still cannot begin this next fight.

Any ideas?  Frankly, with god mode it is actually not a bad game...at all.  Not great.  I mean it's not DXHR or Skyrim or even FO:NV but at least it knows firmly where it stands - DXHR with more bullets and less skill.  And that would be nice sometimes."

In this window type exactly (with caps and everything) that I do as follows: cmd(NoClip)""

Same command to turn clipping back on. Thanx."

,wtfronsson,2012-05-23T19:36Z,"If youre choosing between this or darkness 2, go with D2. Seriously. This game has nice graphics here and there, has some ok segments, mechanics are very bland but work. The real problem is the way the game offers challenge. Its the most fucking infuriating, unfair game in a long time. Im having a hard time explaining it. But most of the time when you die, you don't die because your skill was not enough. You die, because you didnt know what was coming, you had no way of avoiding it. So its constant trial and error. There are segments that you breeze through with no problem. Then there are parts that just fucking kill you, at least once, but some do it over and over. The bosses are the worst. Challenging but fun parts are maybe 5% of the game."

If you use all your hacks appropriately you hardly even need a gun. But kudos to you if you still completed the game, even though you disliked 95% of it. The only aspect in which The Darkness 2 has this game beat, is that you can play the multi-player campaign using Tunngle. Syndicate's multi-player is c*ck-blocked by Origin. For now..."
