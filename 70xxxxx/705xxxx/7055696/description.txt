Alrighty, I've spent the last week or so since Mountain Lion Developer Preview came out and I've updated my image accordingly. Torrent contains a self-extractor you just need to run and a link to a tutorial that'll talk you through what you gotta do for it to run properly. Also contains a link to a site containing various patches and drivers you may need to "personalize" your VM.

Perfect for XCode, installs via the App Store. Contains like every fix possible, and should run as a real Mac. Can contact me if you need help (my email is included in the torrent). I'd recommend an email rather than commenting on here if it's urgent.
