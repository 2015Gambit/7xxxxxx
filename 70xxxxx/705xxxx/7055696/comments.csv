,cojones44,2012-02-24T17:34Z,anybody know if this will work with VMWare player?
,brianxxx,2012-02-25T01:05Z,What's with the links? They won't work...adfly...private...UGHHHHHHHHHHHH
,cojones44,2012-02-25T01:46Z,"Okay, right... why does this need to be an exe file? Looks fishy to me."
[T],faren73,2012-02-27T21:06Z,"@cojones44, don't be stupid. Anyway thanks for the upload SoulUploader, it works and it was so easy. Using it now and you did a great job!"
[T],faren73,2012-02-27T21:53Z,"@brianxxx the links work fine, you just have to wait a few seconds and then click on ""skip this ad"" in the top right corner and it will then take you to the video tutorial, okay. Honestly, people if you can't figure out the simple things, maybe you shouldn't be downloading anything that might require some brain cell activity. And to those who do know how to figure things out here, maybe you should say thank you to the uploader. anyway thanks again SoulUploader for your hard work +1 from me"
,slonikm,2012-02-28T22:01Z,"BitTorrent says, that is has size 0B... I really want it, can you please reupload? :("
,hihahu1,2012-02-29T06:54Z,please specify how to use your x86 support
,brianxxx,2012-03-01T16:22Z,"No, links really did not work fine for a day or so. Now they are ok. I get no ad warning or anything but they were wonky when I first tried. All seems cool now."
,brianxxx,2012-03-01T16:30Z,"@Faren - 
No need to be a douche btw. Cojones was asking a legit question...does it work with PLAYER...not the full Workstation package. He was not being stupid or mean. But you sure acted that way.

I had legit problems with the links. Not my fault. I posted an inquiry. I did not flame or attack. I have followed Soul and have used his stuff before. I am a fan. 

So no need for you to go ape shit on people who never asked for your opinion in the first place. Have some manners. And since you are VIP...ACT LIKE ONE."
[T],faren73,2012-03-02T03:28Z,"@brianxxx Seemed like it was not just a legit question, but some kind of accusation to me. It was the second comment he made, to make the torrent seem ""fishy""? those weren't my words, i choose to check the uploader out first and did some research(by the way I check out the comments on their previous torrents) before i make any comment to make a torrent seem questionable. That's why I don't think that THIS torrent deserved any negative comments, steering people away from it. People who make comments before doing some research, are just pissing in my ear. anyway thanks for making me laugh today! you can think I'm the douche if you want, I don't care"
,forest7,2012-03-03T04:34Z,I downloaded the torrent. The .exe file really extract the vmware files but in the App Store I tried to install xcode and the server said that my os x version is too new.
[T],faren73,2012-03-04T04:35Z,"@forest7 I think that when you open vmware that you can actually run older versions of os x, this actually lets you run any flavor of mac i think. not sure if that would help but i think you should try that, it's just not good with mountain lion. Try an earlier version other than 10.8 which is included in this image. i had the same thing with xcode but i haven't tried the other versions yet, so not sure if it would solve the problem or not?"
[T],SoulUploader,2012-03-12T20:45Z,"XCode hasn't been updated to work with 10.8, hence the issues. You can mod it, but it's difficult to explain off the top of my head. If you want XCode, you're better off using a 10.7 Lion build. Lucky for you, I'm uploading my best one in 5 minutes."
,sasawatc,2012-03-18T05:23Z,"I'm having an issue with sound, graphic, and xcode."
,Toaboy,2012-03-24T05:58Z,"can install this on another partition and boot from that partition(so not using vmware or kinda things..)
if not, where can i find one version 10.8(not a vmware file.. but real boot from usb file)
10.7.2 didn't work for me wil this version work?
can I online update Ideneb v1.3(or another hackinthosh) to the newest osx?"
