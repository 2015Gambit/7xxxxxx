After installing it and cracking it, no matter what kind of compatibility I chose (and even if I chose none), the game wouldn't start. It would just crash and an error would appear, stating that the program has found an error and had to be shut down.

I'm using Win 7, I wonder if someone got this to work on their computer? 

Cheers xx"
