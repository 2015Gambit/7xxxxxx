,ofpirate,2012-02-26T19:25Z,"catch wait to watch this... next ion, when its finally finished dl'ing - seriously though, slowest torrents ever?"
,MVC78,2012-02-27T08:36Z,"Is this converted from 2D or an actual rip from the 3D Bluray? 

It kinda looks like it might be a 2D-3D conversion but I'm not sure"
,menacenz,2012-02-27T09:50Z,Thanks for this but I would also like to ask if this and your other 3d torrents are direct 3d bluray rips or conversions? Thanks.
,cinjaxon,2012-02-27T11:31Z,I've been downloading this for like 3 days straight. It's just crawling. If I find out this is some cheap conversion and not legit 3D I'm going to be REALLY mad. I've STILL apparently got 5-10 hours before it's freakin done.
,ronribeiro,2012-02-27T14:07Z,Slowest torrent ever and the audio/video is flickering! 
,Robomatt,2012-02-27T18:07Z,Why AC3 + DTS? File gets huge!!! 
,cinjaxon,2012-02-28T03:46Z,"Okay, well, I finally finished downloading and it looks PERFECT to me. On my Vizio 3D TV hooked up to the computer (playing with VLC media player) there is perfect 10/10 Audio and Video. These people that say it stutters and flickers, well, it hasn't for me. At least in the long portions I've watched of it. Took forever to download, but it seems like a fantastic copy from what I can tell."
,MVC78,2012-02-28T04:49Z,"ok I'm going to guess this was a conversion since uploader hasn't responded. The 3D just doesn't look all the great as if it were from the 3D bluray version. 

Another thing that gives me pause is that the 3D Bluray wasn't even out in stores yet when this was uploaded. There is however a new Hugo 3D torrent on the PB, I'm going to check it out now. "
,MVC78,2012-02-28T04:51Z,"I'm going to guess this is a 2D-3D conversion since uploader isn't responding. Not only is the 3D not that pronounced but the 3D BluRay hadn't even been released yet when file was uploaded. Please correct if wrong, NLUPPER "
,3_3_3,2012-03-01T20:40Z,"Similar to uploaders TinTin.
Is this a 2D version converted to 3D? The 3D doesn't seem as impressive as I thought it would be. I also seem to get a small amount of ghosting on both sides of picture.
Thanks for the upload anyway. "
,ronribeiro,2012-03-02T04:53Z,"Cinjaxon, I used a LG LW5700 3D TV with a WD TV Live Plus (2011) and the Plex Server on my iMac too, in both the A/V are flickering."
,Drachen_Zor,2012-03-02T23:28Z,"Why is everybody uploading ""side by side"" & not sequential, is it just to make smaller file sizes & faster downloads?"
,espinho,2012-03-05T02:26Z,"Hi...I finished the download and i watched on my TV 3D Panasonic, and the 3D effects is great. Is not a conversion i think, because de depth and the images jumping aou from the screen is amazing."
,bjorn198030,2012-03-06T10:21Z,"Hoe krijg ik de ondertiteling weergegeven bij mn lg3dtv via usb,niet de srt veranderen in UTF-8 ipv ANSI?"
,marc_lucas,2012-03-10T18:03Z,Way too slow d/l gave up!!
,etkki,2012-03-14T19:19Z,why the movie has 2 pictures and when I turn it into 1 picture the subs are opposite? what do I have to do?
,ravester2k3,2012-03-17T17:38Z,"Brilliant Copy
