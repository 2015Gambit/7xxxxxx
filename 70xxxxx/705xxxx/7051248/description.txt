07.10. ACID ROCK AND PSYCHODELIC POP & ROCK 

Psychedelic rock evolved in the 60s as an offshoot of the rock and roll movement combining elements of pop,rock, electronic music, eastern influences - particularly sitars, and other diverse elements. Inspired by the use of mind altering drugs like cannabis, mescaline, psilocybin, and especially LSD, psychedelic rock broke with traditional rock and laid the roots for Krautrock and experimental rock genres of the seventies and eighties.
Psychedelic pop is a musical style inspired by the harder, louder songs of psychedelic rock but applied more to a pop music setting.
Psychedelic music could be interpreted as simply a "surreal and dreamy feeling" in a particular song, instead of a specific genre with rules to follow. In some cases, this simply requires writing one coherent song, then to experiment recording that song in the studio while under "psychedelic influence", yielding very surreal musical results.
During the 1960s, pychedelic rock dominated the later half of the decade with bands such as Pink Floyd , Traffic ,The Doors, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, and The Jimi Hendrix Experience obtaining success.
Acid rock is a form of psychedelic rock, which is characterized with long instrumental solos, few (if any) lyrics and musical improvisation. Tom Wolfe describes the LSD-influenced music of The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Pink Floyd, The Doors, Iron Butterfly, Big Brother & The Holding Company, Cream, The Velvet Underground, Jefferson Airplane, Ultimate Spinach, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Blue Cheer, Quicksilver Messenger Service, The Great Society, Stone Garden and the Grateful Dead as "acid rock" in his book about Ken Kesey and the Acid Tests, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.
