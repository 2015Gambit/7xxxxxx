,UrTaintStnks,2012-03-03T06:14Z,"I'm tired of all these fa**ot little pansies complaining about the quality of these movies. If you don't like it, then go to the theaters and pay however much it costs to watch the movie. We here at TPB support the ability to watch movies, listen to music, and play video games for free. So if you don't like it, then just go f**k your mother."
