The drama begins when handsome Johannes Riemann (as Richard de la Croix) is summoned to an asylum, to check on insane brother Alfred Abel (as Andreas de la Croix). As we see in a later flashback, the alluring Pola Negri (as Sappho) left the innocent Mr. Abel, a lowly engineer, for his well-heeled boss Albert SteinrÃ¼ck (as George Bertink); this helped drive Mr. Abel insane. Presently, when Mr. Riemann finds Ms. Negri, she leaves Mr. Steinruck and moves in with Riemannâ€¦

Negri thinks she has found true love, but her promiscuous past is discoveredâ€¦

After "Madame DuBarry" created an international passion for all things Pola, "Sappho" reached American shores as "Mad Love". More importantly, Negri had taken advantage of the sensation by moving her career to Hollywood. She was an instant celebrity. More importantly, she was considered by critics to be one of the finest actresses around town, and had box office support, too. "Sappho" may not answer why, exactly, but it's nicely preserved, with richly restored color tinting.
