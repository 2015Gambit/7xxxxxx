,michaelrwatson,2012-02-27T10:30Z,"Hey RedDr4gon, is this the same SHIT AUDIO as everything else that's out right now..? Sounds like it.

If so, this is NOT a BRrip, but you don't explicitly state the source of the audio. Doing so would be appreciated."
,michaelrwatson,2012-02-27T21:23Z,"Hi RedDr4gon, i see my last post was a bit snippy. I had just downloaded the ZOMBiES version only to find it had shit audio like all the others. So, if you can provide info on your audio, that would be great. If it's the same as most/all of the others that are out, i will wait.

Btw, i have to agree w/ cookie_man408 that screens or better yet, a sample, are good to have. But judging by his rant, cookie_man408 has Asperger's Syndrome, or worse. Thx."

,mikelove3,2012-02-29T15:34Z,RedDr4gon@..Thank You so Much..YOU ROCK MAN..(Audio 100 % Clear..Picture 100 % Clear ) watch it with VLC v2.0 Any one say its BAD HE IS LIYING .. GREAT WORK RedD4gon..THANK YOU MAN.
,MrSpEEd069,2012-03-01T18:35Z,"This got to be .MKV file [x264] not a .AVI file,if you have some problems to watch,and probably it's not BRRIP"
,jodipodi86,2012-03-02T04:28Z,"Great Quality, thank you so much!"
,michaelrwatson,2012-03-02T07:43Z,"Downloaded to check quality since RedDr4gon didn't bother to include a sample. 

Quality is not great, but is watchable. This is NOT a BRrip. The audio is out of sync throughout (and not by a constant amount). But, it's not as bad as ZOMBiES and most others.

I am just amazed how much effort and bandwidth goes into shit releases flying around the planet. Btw, as MrSpEEd069 suggests, this does NOT appear to be an AVI. Not sure what it is, but most players won't open it. "
,Dude1217,2012-03-03T20:57Z,Hey how about this to all the stupid little whiny bastards on here...this guy took the time and patience to release this copy out here for you little cry baby bitches. Quit you sniveling like a little bitch with a skinned up knee and just shut the hell up and be thankful somebody is doing this shit for you because you are too stupid and lazy to do it your damn self. So what if it doesn't have pictures or a sample? dowload the fucking thing and check it out. Then all you did was waste a little bit of your not too precious time you freaking retard. Thank you RedDr4gon for all the work. Audio could be better but every copy out there still has flaws. I'm not one to complain so I watch with a program to sample as it downloads because thats what smart people do rather than picking on somebody else for there hard work they are too lazy to do. Great job and look forward to your next release
,Qwestshun,2012-03-07T17:14Z,"Torrent is damned good. Im really tired of you people complaining about someone elses work. How old are you people? Does mommy still tuck you in at night or does daddy hit you in the ass and your emotionally damaged?

cookie_man408 your a jerkoff.

Thanks Red!"
,EvilFluffy,2012-03-08T13:37Z,i feel a bit like its not the real brrip but its very good anyway ^^ v:8 a:9
,panamalynn,2012-03-08T14:57Z,"I, for one, appreciate all you do.  Try living in a small fishing village where we are so fortunate to even have internet.  No tv, video stores, movie theatres and we can't watch any NA content on the computer, no netflixs and on and on.  Without people like you we would have absolutely nothing.  Thank you, thank you, thank you...xxxoooxxx"
,Prince5577,2012-03-09T06:45Z,"friendzzzz aj kal TPB se torrent download nahi ho raha ye kese download hoga ?
plzzz tell me"
,michaelrwatson,2012-03-15T05:43Z,"Okay, RedDragon you noob--This is *not* an XviD which can only be AVI, nor is it an AVI, nor is it the MP42 codec. It is an .MP4 file with AAC/h264 video. True it says that somewhere in the info, but the filename is .avi

Now, there' s nothing wrong with .MP4--they are good. But to rename the file as an AVI and call it an XviD is lame. 

And a sample is still useful bec. then one doesn't have to download 800MB but only maybe 10MB to see if it's acceptable. "
,jxc2010,2012-03-17T03:44Z,"I want to hear about the quality of the torrent. Not people having immature shit-fits about how things aren't up to their standards. If it's watchable, and you can hear it for the most part, stop fucking complaining. It's free.

Thank you RedDr4gon for uploading this. I can't wait to watch it."
,shahid8202,2012-03-25T19:07Z,fake....rar file with password protected
,Mazalicous,2012-03-26T03:30Z,"Thanks buddy=) 

& omgsh instead of whining how bout you guys just go download a 'better' copy somewhere else. Red Dragon didnt just download this to suit you guys. 

Good job dude"
,GhostRec0n,2012-03-30T11:18Z,please tell me wheres the rar file with password? this fucking shahid curry cock munching mother fucker better fucking get his mother fucking shit right before alerting people. fuck you smelly BO motherfucker!
,Fnaset,2012-03-31T23:30Z,"Dude1217:

Your post should be in every torrent-description!

Screw all you other lazy bastards and be thankful for what you get!  "
,0Figment0,2012-04-08T13:31Z,"Just downloaded this and am watching it now. 13 Minutes in.
V: 9
A: 9

Audio is a TAD out of sync at times, but nothing terrible and unless you're looking for it, you don't really notice it. 
Only thing I did notice was for about the first 4 minutes the audio was very canned and tinny, but then the quality jumped immensely. Not sure what happened but this is totally watchable and is very good quality.
Worth the download. I tried 2 others and this one puts the other 2 to shame. "
,c00ltun3s,2012-04-09T00:47Z,"Wow. So much hostility...

First of all, thanks Red. Your time and effort is appreciated.

Secondly, to all people saying stop complaining about no screens or sample and just download and see. Its not quite that simple. Some people live in places where their only option for internet is satellite. Most satellite providers limit your monthly bandwidth. How would you feel if you were limited to how much you could download and wasted it all on a file you didnt like?

Third, if all you are going to do is whine and complain about EVERY little imperfection, maybe you shouldnt be here. Even a true bluray rip (which this isnt, btw) can have flaws. And cams, TS's, and r5's will OBVIOUSLY not be perfect. These are things you should know before becoming an active member of the torrenting community.

Last, does it make some of you feel better about yourself to hide online behind a username and bash and criticize people for doing something illegal to give you free entertainment? Are you people really that ungrateful and angry that act all big and bad behind the keyboard. God, the nerve of some people."
