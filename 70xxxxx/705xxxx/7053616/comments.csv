THANKS!!

Hearing intelligent talk is very important these days.  Sometimes I think Rush is the only thing keeping me sane!!!

,Annoyme,2012-02-23T22:40Z,"Levin, Schiff and Rush are my must listen to guys.

Each has an individual specialty where they seperately excel. Levin - law, Schiff in economics and Rush in politics, and they all have good foundations in the other two disciplines.

Combined they are the non religion Trinity of all things public policy.
