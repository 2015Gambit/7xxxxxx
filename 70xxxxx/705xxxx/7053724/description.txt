Overview: Master illusionist Lorenzo wants nothing to do with the Pyr. His dragon nature is just another secret to hide and another detail to juggle, like ensuring that each of his Las Vegas magic shows is a true spectacle. Until he feels the burn of his firestorm and his whole world shifts.... Cassie Redmond is tired of photographing celebrities. She wants to pursue her dream of serious photographyâ€”despite the lucrative offer for a shot of a dragon shifter. Las Vegas is the last place she wants to be, but Lorenzo arouses more than her curiosity when he shifts shape as the finale of his show. Instead of forcing him to reveal his secrets, Cassie gets swept away by this illusionistâ€™s masterful touch. Lorenzo wants to satisfy the firestorm and put it behind him. But Cassie is hard to forgetâ€”and he canâ€™t ignore the danger when Slayers target the mate Lorenzo didnâ€™t believe he wanted....
