This is an Xvid from 1080p HD

720 x 404 video at video 1100k bitrate  dual english or german audio 128k

Lovely picture indeed! (although you may want the hd version instead 
for the overall benefits - we have both 720p and 1080p - the disc players
are cheap enough even if your tv monitor isnt HD as yet)
 

"Wanted! a nanny for two adorable children if you want this position
you must have a cheerful disposition... you must be kind and witty... 
never be cross or cruel..." 

What great words of widsom from the most brilliant children in this 
movie example! 


Mary Poppins is as great a movie for most kids as is The Sound of Music
I daresay, and I enjoyed it equally as much as a child myself! In fact it stars
Ms. Julie Andrews equally of course and has a similar storyline to some degree.

Lovely British kids in the best example of great spirit, as an example to all!
Great songs for the children to grow up with!

enjoy!
