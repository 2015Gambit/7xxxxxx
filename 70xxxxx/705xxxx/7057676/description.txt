U2: Achtung Baby: A Classic Album Under Review
Achtung Baby was the album that fired U2 into the 90s. Displaying a broader musical palette than before and with a newfound smattering of irony, the four-piece dramatically overhauled their traditional approach to songwriting. The so-called band of the 80s were moving on. They now reflected their moods in their music, had loosened up and were taking sonic risks and every single one paid off. U2- Achtung Baby: A Classic Album Under Review offers a previously unobtainable level of insight into the band during the recording of their most dynamic and well respected album. Via the use of live footage, long forgotten videos and the review, criticism and insight of a panel of highly opinionated experts, this package delivers the finest documentary film yet to emerge on Dublin s favourite sons.
