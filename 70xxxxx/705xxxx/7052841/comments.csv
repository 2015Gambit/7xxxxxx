,PIRATE300,2012-02-23T21:04Z,Thanx for this n HUGO :))
,Zombie_Boy,2012-02-23T22:01Z,"Hi YIFY, 

I really appreciate all the small files and stunningly beautiful rips u are uploading, your hard work is really appreciated. 

Nevertheless, i haven't downloaded anymore of your rips after trying just one of ur rips. Though ofcourse i wish i could again. Anyway, the reason is, all your rips are in MP4 video formats and NOT in Avi XviD which majority popular rips are in. 

My main point is, with Avi XviD video file, u can easily attach subtitles to the movie rip by using a freely available software called AVIAddXSub, and then you can watch the movie with subtitles on Play Station 3 (some of us, or maybe majority of ppl prefer watching movies with subtitles, and on ps3 too, i believe). 

But unfortunately, with MP4 videos, you cant attach subtitles (using that software) to watch on Playstation 3, it only works with avi video formats. Ofcourse, u can watch MP4 files on PS3, but without subtitles. Also there arent any other software that could attach subtitles on MP4, at least none that i know of after researching on google (lol), obviously only on Avi Xvid files u can do that.  

So if its possible, please change from MP4 to Avi Xvid video formats. Again if its possible ok? And i believe u will be more popular and will win the hearts of many ppl worlwide. 

Lastly, i am not in anyway disrespecting your hard work. As i said in the beginning, your hard work is truly appreciated, well done for the small files and awesome rips. Hats off to u, bro."

,G3tm3soda,2012-02-23T23:46Z,"@Zombie_Boy I am no expert on the field of codecs, but I think avi is way more size/quality demanding container than mp4 and mkv are. Just my thought.

And to Yify, thanks for 1080p of this :)"
,p_alien,2012-02-24T02:24Z,oh man!! how did you get 1080p with such great quality in 1.5gb.. thank you so much..
,LaFouine2011,2012-02-24T02:45Z,"Hi,

@Zombie_Boy, from here (http://www.videohelp.com/tools/AVIAddXSubs ) I see that AVIAddXSubs works with mp4 if subtitles are in idx/sub format, so you just have to convert the srt provide with the movie with SubtitleCreator (http://www.videohelp.com/tools/SubtitleCreator ) to the idx/sub format.

@Zombie_boy you can attach subtitles to Mp4 firmats as-well; Just make sure they both have similar names (i.e.video & subtitles) than keep them in same folder!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Really good movie. The style is fantastic and has a good story. My friend said it sucked but I think he didn't like the art/style on how it was made. "
