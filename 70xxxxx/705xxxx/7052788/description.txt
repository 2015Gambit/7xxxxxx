         Based on the true story of Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley)         
         , daughter of film actor Laurence Harvey. Tired and                
         unsuited to the pretentiousness of her high-society LA             
         life, Domino leaves the glittarti behind and sets off to           
         become a bounty hunter. She quickly falls under the wing           
         of veteran hunter Ed Mosley (Mickey Rourke) and his crew           
         and becomes an unlikely natural in the art of bounty               
         hunting. But things really heat up when a gang of masked           
         men begin a series of armored car heists, and before long          
         the mob, a crazed TV producer, the FBI and a terminally            
         ill child have all got caught up in the crazy situation.

      Domino.2005.RERip.DVDRip.XviD-AFO has aspect ratio              
      problems. Try playing the video using VLC or on a               
       standalone player and it will be very stretched. We've           
         tested our encode and no such problems seem to exist. Nice         
         job AFO for beating us but better luck next time guys.
