,KaTTALIKAS,2012-03-22T18:10Z,WHERE IS FIX
,Madalot,2012-03-23T07:36Z,"Guys it works flawless amazing thank you.
If you have a problem which I put insane mode on = crash or cant alt-tab = crash, then all you need to do is.
In the Win32 folder you have 2 .exe files to start the game, 1 DunDefGame 2 DungeonDefenders.
Number 1 is the one that gave me problems, I recommend using 2. also if you leave the game alt-tabbed for too long it will crash.eg. more then 2minutes. Thanks again for the game its great fun."
,Madalot,2012-03-23T07:38Z,"Aw yea by the way I found no fix folder or file anywhere in the folders, so I don't know what these guys are talking about."
,Madalot,2012-03-23T07:49Z,"Just found out if it crashes on number 2 from my explanation from before, open number 1 and it works; play around with them see what works for you."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2012-03-24T06:22Z,"y is this torrent smaller than an older version? this >>>> http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7027788/Dungeon_Defenders_7.16c_full_

does that other torrent have things this doesnt have?"
,Madalot,2012-03-24T08:59Z,"Well its the most updated torrent around so I am guessing that it would have some things more, I am not sure though because I only downloaded this one.
By the way people who read my comments, I just found out that for me number 1 .exe works on hard and insane for me and number 2 .exe works for easy, medium and nightmare, it crashes .eg. when number 1 .exe is run on a level (whatever) Difficulty >hard"
,Madalot,2012-03-25T05:17Z,"Hey if anyone knows please comment, I was wondering if you can play multi-player on local I didn't try it yet, but if anyone did let me know please."
,Madalot,2012-03-25T07:11Z,"I am level 32 countess already, I'm sure it would be more fun to play with people Online.
Please if anyone has a good idea, that they think it might work, let me know, comment, explain, elaborate and please don't give up. 
Thanks in advance Madalot."
