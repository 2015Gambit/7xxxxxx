,SerSpec-V,2012-02-26T07:43Z,Downloading fast now (15min). Video is very good but Audio is a let down. 
,iceb0x21,2012-02-26T23:00Z,"A=?
V=?"
,michaelrwatson,2012-02-27T10:24Z,"@SerSpec-V you say ""audio is a letdown.""

How the fuck can the audio be a letdown if this is a BRrip..?  Is it because it's NOT actually a BRrip and really uses the same shit audio as everything else that's out? Then it should be nuked.

What a bunch of fucking morons."
,wolfbeast,2012-02-28T20:21Z,"It would be nice if people do not label torrents ""BRRip"" or ""BluRay"" when the source is not actually a BR disc or master."
,win-32,2012-03-06T16:49Z,"A=05/10
V=07/10
its not a BluRayRip"
,cragis1878,2012-03-11T23:27Z,Why do people do that say it's a Brrip when it clearly is not. Only watched first couple of mins. Would rather wait and see better copy.
