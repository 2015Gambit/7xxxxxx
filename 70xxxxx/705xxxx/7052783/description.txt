TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Director Drake Doremus revealed that in order to get a PG-13 rating some slight changes had to be made to the original cut - mainly the R-Rated language - that premiered at Sundance in 2011.

Director Drake Doremus viewed a rough cut of this film to his former students at the Orange County High School of the Arts before submitting it to the Sundance Film Festival. 

At the Toronto International Film Festival (2011), the director admitted that much of the movie was improvised. The script outlined what would happen, but Felicity Jones and Anton Yelchin improvised much of their dialogue. 

Writers Drake Doremus and Ben York Jones looked back at some of the long distance relationships they had been in for the inspiration of this film.
