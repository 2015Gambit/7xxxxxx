,rsl87,2012-02-26T15:12Z,pretty crappy quality just like all the rest.. don't understand why there's not a good version of this out yet.. all are either wayyyy to dark or the audio is horrible.. or both.. i appreciate the uploaders effort but it's kinda pointless to keep uploading all these crappy versions

well i am sorry you feel that way but mine is right for the U.S. Blu-Ray Disk. i did not change anything about the picture. so that is the way the blu-ray disk is. you might want to check your settings on your tv or monitor. "
