In order for this to be successful, I really need seeders.  So please stick around and seed for as long as possible after finishing.  Thanks!"
,NotHuman,2012-02-24T07:43Z,"The site has removed some of the links in the description and I am not able to post them.  Email me at devoidzero@gmail.com if you need them.  You can also do a YouTube search for ""nothingincarnate"" and click on my channel to watch the videos (they are pretty amazing)."
