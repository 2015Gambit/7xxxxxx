Liquid Tension Experiment - \"Live in LA\" 2008 
Full Blu-ray Rip (1080p)

This is a full Blu-ray rip of Liquid Tension Experiment (a side project featuring 3 members of Dream Theater) performing live on their reunion tour at the Downey Theatre in Downey, California on June 27th, 2008.  This Blu-ray disc was exclusively available as part of the LTE Live 2008 Limited Edition Box Set (which has long been out of print).  It was ripped using AnyDVD. 

To watch this on your PC without a Blu-ray player, first download and install Virtual CloneDrive, a freeware program available here:

You will now need a program that can play Blu-ray discs.  I recommend Arcsoft Total Media Theatre, which can be downloaded here: 


After installing Total Media Theatre 5, mount the ISO image contained in this torrent using Virtual CloneDrive.  Then open Total Media Theatre 5 and select the drive you just mounted to play the Blu-ray.  

To watch using a physical Blu-ray player, you must have a Blu-ray burner drive and appropriate burning software to burn the ISO.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me at devoidzero@gmail.com
