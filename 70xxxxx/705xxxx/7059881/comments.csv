,Kudala_Mangalooru,2012-03-05T20:34Z,"Hello Folks,

I am a newbie.  So, please bear with me here.  I downloaded Nero Micro using this torrent, tried to follow the instructions that came with it.  I copied and pasted the serial from the notepad.  That's where I am stuck.  It says the serial is not valid.  I am not able to proceed further.  What am I doing wrong?  Can anyone help with a detailed explanation how to install this with the patch?  Any information is highly appreciated. :) ~Kevin~"
,Kudala_Mangalooru,2012-03-05T20:44Z,"By the way, I am trying to install Nero Micro on two PC desktops, one with Windows XP Pro & the other with Windows 7 Pro, both 32 bit and with Service Pack + all updates.
~Kevin~"
[V],Anacondaz,2012-03-06T05:22Z,"1. Start the installer
2. Enter the key when it asks
3. When it says ""Invalid serial"" - run the patcher (DO NOT CLOSE THE INSTALLER!)
4. Then, back to the installer and click on ""install"" again
5. Enjoy :D


or try this

If you have ""patching failed"" ,
go to regedit, current user, software, and delete ""nero"" directory.
It contains old info from previous Nero installations and follow the above instructions"

,Kudala_Mangalooru,2012-03-09T21:45Z,"Dear Anacondaz,  Thank you soooooo very much for spoon-feeding me the instructions. :- ).  It really worked this time. :- ) Great Torrent!  I love the micro version with none of the other non-sense software.  What would I do without you guys & the Piratebay? :- )"
,anu24592,2012-03-10T12:10Z,"@Anacondaz-  the serial is invalid(as expected)

so i done what you said i.e run the patcher without closing the installer, it said that ""patched sucessfully"" and after that when i run the installation setup again, its again asking me the key which is invalid. so the point is i'm reaching the same point where i began. 
What to do???

p.s- i've windows 7, 32  bit
and i also deleted the nero directory.
