@ MisterPG

elitecrusher Is Actually correct, the bay have been loading real slow for the past 2 days. Some Searches Bringing up blank pages and When Refreshed results then show. Seems They are Updating the system.

,silverkid,2012-02-26T16:47Z,tpb has been running really shit.. its not just him.. i have tried otehr sites and they work well. but tpb slow... would often just stop loading half way through a page .... but seems okay now
,TmUzik,2012-02-26T17:35Z,its Shakespearean because its based off a Shakespeare play....
,snowbirds,2012-02-26T22:47Z,"Yes, but Shakespeare didn't have machine guns in his play.  If they updated the rest of the movie, then why not the language?

I just watched the trailer on youtube, to see how difficult it was to follow the dialogue.  Funny how on the trailer they avoid showing hardly any Shakespearean dialogue..."
,darkwolverinex,2012-02-27T03:17Z,hey blaze!
,1madchef,2012-02-27T06:55Z,i wonder if there is English subs lol not in Shakespearian but English!!! 
,shirt3,2012-02-28T11:11Z,"Snowbirds: Have you ever seen Romeo and Juliet (The modern day version)???

Awesome remake of a great Shakesperian play....has guns in it too. lol

These films are the directors putting a modern day twist onto legendary Shakespeare plays...."

,joepa007,2012-03-02T05:32Z,"Premature comment - watched the trailer, movie looks great, Ralph Fiennes w/ a chrome dome is a bit of an unexpected twist. Can't wait for DL to complete."

You do realise that Coriolanus is a Shakespeare play, right? What do you expect them to do, translate it into Retard for you?"
,TheAsset,2012-03-09T23:08Z,"v-9 a-4.

,Carjacker,2012-04-18T17:40Z,"As this is a re-seed of TvTeam's upload -  nd since this has more seeds//leeches- Ill leave my comment here: video is good but audio is totally horrible. Bad encoding,sounds like they are speaking in a tin can with annoying feedback and almost unintelligible speech.
Video=8
Audio=3 "
