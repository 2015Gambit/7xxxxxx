NOTES:

Right the russian r5 was nice,but lacked on the contrast,sharpeness ....just like most r5s do.
Audio was nice cam but had noise issues and a tad loud.
For the video just make a small script for it containing crop,resize,heavy noise,sharpen ...then dropped that into
vdub and used the rgb eq and contrast brightness to fix the issue it had.
Audio i had to sync ....what a PITA,done the normal way cutting into a few pieces and stretching.shrinking and worked ...
until i went too append them lol ...
Anyway got there in the end without any cuts but took some work and some hair pulling lol.
Once done totally remastered the audio on AA ....and now sounds great for cam audio

Overall v9 a 7.5 .......
