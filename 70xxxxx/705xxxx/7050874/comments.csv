Video..although its Cam, its still good, 8 out of 10

Audio, same, 8 out of 10

there are some parts with fast movement, that show double...
good enough for me to upload as an ISO

im definitely going to buy the Blu-Ray though."

 Audio is ok but has some pretty high trebble (needs manual adjusting), video is dark/faded as expected but suffers from some strange tracer effect when it comes to movement (was it the 3D one or something?).

 Overall an alright cam, watchable - but I think i'll wait for one with better video. I found that tracer shit seriously hard on the eyes."

,jongepier,2012-03-11T22:19Z,"A & V is not realy bad. It's lil' blury but watchable

the movie is okay, but it's not the best one of Marvel. I think the writer of the storyline added too much christian mystics to the story and that's disapointing for a Marvel story because they have usualy their own mythology"
,jongepier,2012-03-11T22:30Z,"and by the way, the special effects in the first ghost rider where way better"
,DACreech,2012-03-12T22:56Z,"The Movie is Watchable.  However, before you download it, you will want to enable Peer Block.

If you don't have it, it is free and you can download it from this link.

Thnx for uploading this."
