INSTALLATION NOTES

Install bookcollectorsetup.exe.  After installation copy
precracked exe from the Crack folder into Book Collector Pro's
installed folder, overwriting the existing file.  You now have a
fully registered version of Book Collector Pro!

*NOTE TO ALL READ NOW ABOUT TRIAL EXPIRE!:*

Going to ONCE AGAIN state the obvious because some people can't
seem to use common sense and nuke a working release because of
their stupidity.  So here we go again and state the obvious in
each release of any Collectorz.com applications:

We have for awhile now made searching at Collectorz.com work and
not show illegal key, allowing book lookup to work from that
source, while another group's crack didn't allow any searching
there at all.  Now of course if you add over the 100+ normal
limit for Book Collector, and request data well over that limit
from that source in ONE BIG SEARCH, your going to be red flagged
and the server WILL block your IP and ONLY your IP and say your
trial is up (and this is ONLY for retrieval of updates from
them).  This again should be quite obvious with server side
protection and using a cracked application, but we give you the
option to still be able to download from them, nobody else could
before (method will not be explained).

We will state it again clearly, don't search over that limit in
one large update to your database!  Example would be 50 to 75
back to back automatic searches/updates in one use.  If you do
half of the normal limit (50 searches) and more at a later time,
you'll be fine as we have patched the counter inside your
collection file.  For people that refuse to listen (like you
nuker), you have been warned and this version of Collectorz.com
Book Collector Pro now ONLY uses Collectorz.com as it's source.

Change your IP if you somehow forget this, or wait for the ban to
be lifted if you don't listen (YES!! using a FREE PROXY found
easily with google, allows you once again to search right away,
showing you its server side!!  Proxy IP is added within the
program).  You still have ALL the other Pro features anyways.
Besides, if your using this program to store that many books, its
about time you paid for it and made that purchase to support this
great database manager.

Thats it!  Enjoy.
