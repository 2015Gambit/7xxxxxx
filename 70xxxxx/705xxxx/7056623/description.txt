Ok some call this episode 18 - now on the aftershow if is was then
why do they call it aftershow episode 16 and not 18
so it matches... *calling it aftershow 16 dont make sense to me
when its episode 18.. that how I see it.

the 2 specials arent part of the normal numbering thats why

so those calling my dumb cos of this are rude frankly

again if disv are incl the specials in naming they are certainly
not matching the episodes up with the aftershows naming and should

regardless the 2 specials are better as separates I think
if your not happy then rename them.. but I see it as
a pointless argument

why for other series were the specials called SP## and not
for this series beats me but im sticking with my naming

I will have the aftershow up soon too..


note wiki
says theres a 3rd special next week to wrap up the season!
