I just want to say thanks for all your hard work getting them to me as fast as you do!!!
you totally rock!!!!!!!!
keep em' coming!!!"
[V],psspss,2012-02-25T07:17Z,"true just i like to match the names of aftershows to 
match episodes even if discovery called the specials
E09 and 10 they didnt increment the aftershows
names from that point and perhaps they should off.

I still say the specials are better as a sep watch
as they have the aftershows with extras in .. 

just like I been rip the AS=s as well and calld them specials so you have a choice to watch sep
after watching the normal episodes

technically they should be appened on the end
of the episode LOL

arrgh who cares as you say.. but insulting me cos
I dont follow other cappers or their naming 
when I dont have to upload these converts or aftershows 

anyhow.. I do it for myself but decided to share my work and costly bandwidth!"
[V],psspss,2012-02-25T07:36Z,"ust started to watch it

it might just be me but I think theres some
voice syncing problems.. drifts in and out
in places.

might of been the source I used after all

its minor though.. like 100ms

maybe its just me or something"
[V],psspss,2012-02-25T07:52Z,"Sorry guys looks like I need to redo the audio
I upload a new one with sync fixed.. arr always pays to watch 10min
before uploading huh

but ALL is not lost, meantime you can watch this one just go into VLC track sync feature
and add + .300 ms

by looks syncs it better.. I checked out the beards talking not 
normal people and didnt notice that small slip!  lol"
,jamkcur1,2012-02-25T07:57Z,Please Seed guys!!
[V],psspss,2012-02-25T08:22Z,"audio fixed one up if keeping it.. but if watching it only
just adjust the sync by 300ms

here is the fixed one hope I got all the problems sorted this time and I just cant be bother with it now haha

take it or leave it as I normally say.. just sharing
up to you if want it

[V],psspss,2012-02-25T09:41Z,"note theres a minor mirror issue at the bottom
of video it didnt worry me but no doubt
some perfectionists will moan 
the audio sync is more annoyance 

but it was another great watch this episode
was exciting and sounds like a SEASON 3 is coming"
