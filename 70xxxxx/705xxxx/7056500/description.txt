Quote:

There are thousands of unused drum loops ... What if they could be morphed into something sounding electronic, glitch, experimental, ambient, industrial, idm, noise, dub, techno? Impossible you say ? Try yourself.

Relectro is no delay, compressor, filter nor pitch shifter but it does all that on a per wave cycle basis. Don't try to grasp that intellectually, fire up some of the most boring, overused, outdated drums you have and Relectro them into something completely different. Don't believe it, do it!
