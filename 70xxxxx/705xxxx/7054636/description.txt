SYNOPSIS:  
When Norah Larkin (Anne Baxter) learns that her GI beau has a new girl, she impulsively agrees to have dinner with playboy Harry Prebble (Raymond Burr). Several drinks later, Norah awakens at home having no memory of the previous night -- and soon learns that Harry is dead. Pursued as a murderess, Norah goes on the run, desperate to evade the law as she tries to piece together the events of that lost evening.
