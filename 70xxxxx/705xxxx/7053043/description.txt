CsalÃ¡di tÃ¼zfÃ©szek aka Family Nest (Bela Tarr, 1979)


Family Nest, director Bela Tarrâ€™s realistic first feature (astonishingly made when the director was 22) about the 1970s Hungarian housing crisis opens with the quote: â€œThis is a true story. It didnâ€™t happen to people in the film, but it could have.â€ Considering the proliferation of non-professional actors in this movie, that statement probably isnâ€™t too far from the truth. In a departure from the intensely stylized, heavily choreographed camerawork that dominated his later masterpieces made after Damnation, he shoots Family Nest in a verite style with direct, environmental sound, location shooting, and editing thatâ€™s a bit too rough to be artful. As such, itâ€™s a film thatâ€™s way more conventional than Tarrâ€™s later works, and not nearly as visually satisfying. The outlook of life here is so unrelentingly bleak that at one point when Tarr inserts a carefree montage at a local carnival that plays out with the accompaniment of pop music feels wholly out of place until Tarr concludes the sequence with a close-up of a character vomiting, a shock stunt that puts thing back on track. As in nearly all of Tarrâ€™s films, the dingy barroom is only escape from dingy houses that the characters live in, and alcoholism seems the inevitable reprieve from their miserable lives.
