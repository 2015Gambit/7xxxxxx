The original re-transferred mono DVD-A MLP tracks

These tracks were all recorded in mono, and hence this is by far the most authentic representation available today.

"Brian Wilson always mixed the final version of his recordings in mono, as did Phil Spector. He did this for several reasons; one of which was that he felt that mono mastering provided more sonic control over the final result that the listener heard, regardless of the vagaries of speaker placement and sound system quality."
