New single from the upcoming The Used album Vulnerable out March 27th 2012

MP3 320 kbs CBR (Constant Bitrate) TRUE STEREO (unlike still most Joint-Stereo music files still being uploaded in 2012) On that subject, WHY? You gain a couple of kB's for what? People upload Blu-Ray rips which go around 2-40 GB's (depending on the container (mkv and the likes)) but for something as precious as music, you go and upload shit. Yes, there's FLAC (thank "god"), but not everyone knows how to convert FLAC to MP3s for portable use.
