Classic Albums: U2: The Joshua Tree 
Released in March of 1987, U2's The Joshua Tree quickly became the fastest-selling album in British chart history. The story of the making of the album is told here, via interview and archive film footage, with contributions from band members Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen. U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness reveals how the album catapulted the band into the category of rock superstars, and there are contribution from Elvis Costello, re-mix producer Steve Lillywhite and, of course, Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. Packed with reminiscences and powerful performances, this is the story of one of the most famous albums of the 80's. After toiling for years as an underground cult favorite with a rabidly devoted fan base, Irish rock band U2 finally broke through to mainstream success on the strength of their 1987 opus THE JOSHUA TREE. Released in March of that year, THE JOSHUA TREE became U2's first number-one album and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The record's crossover appeal stems from its emotional exploration of universal topics such as love ("With or Without You"), death ("One Tree Hill"), and spiritual longing ("I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For") without sacrificing any of the trademark social consciousness of the band's earlier albums ("Bullet the Blue Sky," "Mothers of the Disappeared"). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series details the making of U2's chart-topping album through interviews with band members, archival film footage, and live performances.
