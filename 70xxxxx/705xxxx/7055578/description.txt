This is World of Warcraft 4.0.6a for MacOS!

It has all necessary data files to play on a private server.

It is preconfigured for Molten WoW.

This release supports multiple languages

By default the language is North American English.

To create other language double click on one of the following files:

NA:
Make_Language_enUS.command English (United States)
Make_Language_esMX.command Spanish (Mexico)

EU:
Make_Language_enGB.command English (United Kingdom)
Make_Language_deDE.command German (Germany)
Make_Language_esES.command Spanish (Spain)
Make_Language_frFR.command French (France)
Make_Language_ruRU.command Russian

TW:
Make_Language_enTW.command Chinese menus/text, English spoken
Make_Language_zhTW.command Chinese (Taiwan), Chinese spoken

This will set your locale to that and download the correct data.

Loading the Taiwan data is really slow :) But works fine... :)

Realize it will take a LONG time if you are switching regions for the game to
initially load the menu.  Just wait.  Takes less time if you are just switching
languages within same region.

Also realize if you play on a private server that is english based then not everything
will be in your language.  Quest descriptions will not be in your language.  But items,
menus, chat stuff, menus, maps, etc will be in your language.

You can switch locale back and forth if you choose.  You will only loose Cache data
and this is rebuilt automatically.

Sometimes I notice after switching languages it hangs on connecting to realm.  You
can try to cancel and login again if you see this happen.

Please have patience while data is loaded!  You can monitor your data files and see them grow if you like.
Or if your geeky you can use tcpdump via terminal: sudo tcpdump | grep http

Tech:
NA shares base data with enUS esMX
EU shares base data with deDE enGB esES frFR ruRU
TW shares base data with zhTW enTW
KR ... dont have valid mfil ...
CN ... dont have valid mfil ...

Could likely use a higher mfil for KR and CN and still work but didn't bother finding one.
If you want to research and find correct CN/KR mfils or compatible ones with client
build 13623 feel free to give them to me for inclusion. google away!
