Attempting to impress his ideologies on religion, relationships, and the randomness 
(and worthlessness) of existence, lifelong New York resident Boris Yellnikoff rants 
to anyone who will listen, including the audience. But when he begrudgingly allows 
naive Mississippi runaway Melodie St. Ann Celestine to live in his apartment, 
his reclusive rages give way to an unlikely friendship and Boris begins to mold 
the impressionable young girl's worldly views to match his own.
