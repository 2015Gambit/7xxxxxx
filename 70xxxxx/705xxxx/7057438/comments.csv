If you like the movie, buy it, although I know it's a bit hard to find it in most parts of the world..."
,samderp93,2012-02-26T07:50Z,"Hey, thank you so much for this torrent. I just like to ask, is it possible to get an HD version of this anytime soon? Thanks in advance :) "
,Jrexxx,2012-02-26T09:15Z,"I'm working on getting a the blu-ray, I'll then rip it and upload it but I have no idea when I'm goinf to do that..."
,djvibes,2012-02-28T00:46Z,Thanks for the upload... when the BR will be released??
,Turin1980,2012-03-03T05:39Z,Thanks for the upload. Could you please upload or point at a source for ENG subs? Thanks!
,Jrexxx,2012-03-03T13:47Z,"I don't think the movie has been officially released yet, so english subtitles are hard to find. Once the movie is released I'll make sure to upload it in HD and to include all the subtitle languages that are on the blu-ray."
,capture27,2012-04-02T18:12Z,"Thanks for the upload,but this is not the full movie,
the original 110 minutes long yours is only 97 min. in length. Can you please get this fixed?"
,Jrexxx,2012-04-08T08:50Z,"THx for the heads up, didn't know that. However I ripped this movie off a DVD that I got from Lebanon  BEFORE the movie was even released so that may explain the length of this version. I'm still planning to buy and rip the Blu-ray version of the movie, I imagine that it'll be the full 110 mins..."
,capture27,2012-04-08T17:18Z,Thanks for your response. Can't wait for your rip the Blu-ray version of this movie with English subs.Thanks again.
,Bridget_bri,2012-05-11T17:20Z,I´m looking forward waiting for the DVDRip and the english subtitle in .srt! Please do it!!! Tks a lot!
