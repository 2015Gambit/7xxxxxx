,james_svk,2012-02-24T12:03Z,it's that real update ??? :O 
,lasskke,2012-02-24T12:17Z,"yes, its real,no sweat!"
,lasskke,2012-02-24T21:31Z,"@kadz It's very simple.
Create folder ""db"" inside FIFA 12/Game/data/
Then copy there ""db_ng_db""
You should then regenerate FIFA 12 with iard86 Regenerator.
Download it from here: http://downloads.moddingway.com/file/17418.html
And thats all.
Its all working fine for me."
,FMLegend,2012-02-24T23:38Z,1.27mb? Im not an expert in these things so forgive me if this is legit but surely a transfer update would be much bigger?
,lasskke,2012-02-25T12:52Z,"@fmlegend if you dont trust me, just play with old database, im playing with this new.
I found this file at soccergaming.com and also at fifainfinity and it's legit.
I just want to share with everybody else, who play with reloaded realese, and cannot find winter transfers."
,lasskke,2012-02-25T16:35Z,"@kadz im also playing with reloaded version
You must find fifa 12 folder when regenerator ask you,and just click on GO"
,avve1904,2012-02-25T20:31Z,All I get when I start the regenerator is that it only support the NG version
,stoykov,2012-03-10T11:20Z,works great for me even withought the regenerator cause i have the reloaded version !! thanks
,XeVile,2012-03-29T20:05Z,"This isnt the official EA winter transfer patch, it a user edit db from the game, the official one wont be given away by someone just like that. I already have it including other patches get it from soccergaming.com or its forum alter."
,Muhibulhaq88,2012-05-07T04:32Z,"I click and click on get this torrent, but doesnt works for me anymore :S "
