,barkers01,2012-02-29T21:17Z,"hey, great upload.

is there away though to download the files separately? im only interested in a couple of those games.

when i click to download it just does the whole thing as one lump.  on my 1.5mb download it will take a while :( thanks in advance G"
[T],shemyaza,2012-03-01T00:57Z,wait for the metadata to load then choose files as you would in any other torrent.
