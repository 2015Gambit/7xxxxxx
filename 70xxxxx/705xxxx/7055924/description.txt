Release Notes....: YesTV you should probably read the rules that you sign. 
                   - Keyframe  interval  (--keyint) must be at least 200 and at most 300.
                   - Minkeyint must be 30 or less.
                   We know there are issues with --colormatrix setting for low resolution
                   sources but HDTV sources must still have colormatrix set to bt709.

                   A side note that is not nukable, a crop of 2 on left and 2 on right
                   yields an AR of ~1.772. 720/400 = 1.8 which is a ~1.5% AR error and is
                   borderline unacceptable.

                   Also, you should probably set your cmd line to level 3.1 instead of 4.1
                   to avoid any conficts and check your min/max keyframe intervals
                   your 720ps too. Have a great day
