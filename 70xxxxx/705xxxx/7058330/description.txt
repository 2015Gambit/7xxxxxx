Puss 'N' Boots is the sixth studio album by Crash Test Dummies, released in 2003. The album began life as a Brad Roberts solo project. While the lyrics were written by Brad Roberts, most of the music was written by Stuart Cameron. Perhaps not coincidentally, this album is, musically-speaking, more conventional, less original. Ellen sang backing vocals and Dan played bass, though much of the music was performed by other musicians
