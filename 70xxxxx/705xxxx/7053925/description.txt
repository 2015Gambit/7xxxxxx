Description
Robolinux is today's best Linux Desktop and laptop solution for non technical PC users who want to get rid of Microsoft Windows and replace it with an easy to use Linux operating system. We modified the Ubuntu distribution and put thousands of code changes and tweaks into it, so you can set it up in virtually any language spoken on the earth, thanks to the global reach of Linux. Robolinux looks similar to the Apple interface but has the Ubuntu menu navigation that operates more like Windows. it's not tough to learn how to navigate an Apple Mac but when you are used to running a Windows pc, a MAC has some nuances that require some learning and getting used to. So we made the Robolinux navigation just like what you are used to.
