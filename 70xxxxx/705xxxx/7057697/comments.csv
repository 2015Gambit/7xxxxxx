,OmniNegro,2012-02-26T04:10Z,"Anyone happen to know why this crack is so much larger than the 3DM crack? 3DM is 19.1MB while Skidrow is 35.1MB.

I am not saying there is anything wrong with it, but I wonder what is different.

I am posting this same question on Sonuyos torrent of the same."

,buggermaner,2012-02-26T10:42Z,"I have problem. The Game is close after start.
Description: Syndicate.exe APPCRASH
here is good manual about Syndicate.exe APPCRASH - http://gameblitz.online-net.de
With original .exe game run, but ask disk... if I copy crack files - appcrash error.
Have someone idea? "
[V],blaze69,2012-02-27T06:29Z,"@ buggermaner

The Game Does Not run with original .exe. It only launches the ""date Release Check""

Make Sure You Copy the Cracked Folder ""system"" to the Game's Root folder replacing/overwriting the original files and Folders.. If Not, Try just copying both 

Syndicate.exe and skidrow.dll to 

%GamePath%/System\Win32_x86_Release

Replacing/overwriting as Usual.. If That Doesn't work for U.well seems Ur Antivirus Have auto deleted the cracked File causing headache for You.. If Ur Using  Bitdefender Turn ""AutoPilot"" OFF and Unde rAntivrus in settings/exclusions .. add Cracked Files/cracked Folder'sPath To acception list
