GiliSoft Full Disk Encryption's offers encryption of
all disk partitions, including the system
partition.Through password protecting a disk, disk
partition or operating system launch, the program
disables any unauthorized reading/writing activity on
your disk or PC, restricts access and launch of
specific disks and files. It provides automatic
security for all information on endpoint hard drives,
including user data, operating system files and
temporary and erased files. For maximum data
protection, multi-factor pre-boot authentication
ensures user identity, while encryption prevents data
loss from theft.

The value of Full Disk Encryption (FDE) technology
grows with every report of a lost or stolen laptop or
sensitive data record. The cost of exposing sensitive
business or personal data is devastating. With so
incidents of data loss in recent years, both federal
and state governments have taken action to hold
companies accountable for protecting the sensitive
information they handle. Laws that require disclosure
of data breaches and assign liability in some cases
reflect widespread concern for maintaining the
possible protection of data.

Powerful new generation encryption software with
computer boot authorization will fully protect your
hard drives and flash disks, including the OS. It
provides the ultimate security standard for
at the physical sector level. Based on the most
technology, AES256, this product is an outstanding
data security tool. Another great feature is the
support of flash media and USB hard disk drives, so
that no one will be able to access your data if you
lose it.

Features and Benefits:

?Full Disk Encryption
Automatically encrypts all information on the hard
drive - including user data, the operating system,
temporary files and erased files, for maximum data
protection.

?Pre-Boot Authentication
Ensures that only authorized users are allowed to
access the endpoint.  All valid credentials must be
provided before the operating system will boot.

?Support USB Disk Encryption

The primary function of GiliSoft Full Disk Encryption
is hard drive and flash memory encryption. Pre-boot
authentication and encryption of the whole drive,
including the system files, gives this software
superiority over similar products.

?User-friendly interface

The application has a user-friendly interface and
doesn't require constant attention. No additional
skills are required to use this software. GiliSoft
Full Disk Encryption can guarantee your computer
security, privacy and complete data protection from
undesirable access.

?Superior data security

FDE is a hardware feature incorporated into the drive
to protect data where it is stored or data at rest.
Inside the drive is a complete computing system,
including a CPU used for data encryption and
decryption. Since FDE uses its own CPU, the user does
not suffer performance issues as with software
encryption.
FDE is transparent to the user and independent of the
operating system; users don?t need to turn the
encryption feature on and cannot turn it off. FDE is
always encrypting and the data is always protected.
The FDE drive interface closely controls access to
drive resources. There is no direct memory access and
program memory is separate from data storage,
minimizing the risk of any backdoor data breach.
FDE comes complete with its own memory, a
operating system and an abundance of storage space,
all in the hard drive?s closed computing environment.
