TRIVIA FROM IMDB

The studio originally wanted to shoot the entire film in Salamanca, Spain, but the local government refused to close the Plaza Mayor for nearly 3 months. Production was moved to Cuernavaca and Puebla, Mexico. Only the scenes filmed from the air were shot in Spain. 

When shooting was moved to Mexico, the production design team built a replica of Salamanca's Plaza Mayor, which is slightly smaller than the original.

In the original script, the tourist was a Russian named Lewicki. When Forest Whitaker auditioned for a different role, Pete Travis was so impressed that he rewrote the tourist as an American and offered the role to him.

In order to keep the dozens of video monitors in the TV control booth synchronized properly, the screens were actually greenscreen panels that were replaced in post-production.

PLOT: The President of the United States is in Salamanca, Spain, about to address the city in a public square. We see a plain-clothes cop, his girlfriend with another man, a mother and child, an American tourist with a video camera, and a Secret Service agent newly returned from medical leave. Shots ring out and the President falls; a few minutes later, we hear a distant explosion, then a bomb goes off in the square. Those minutes are retold, several times, emphasizing different characters' actions. Gradually, we discover who's behind the plot. Is the Secret Service one step ahead, or have the President's adversaries thought of everything?
