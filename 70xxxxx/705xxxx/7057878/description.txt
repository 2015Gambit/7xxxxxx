Child Is Father to the Man is the debut album by Blood, Sweat & Tears, released in February 1968. 
It reached number 47 on Billboard's (North America) Pop Albums chart

Widely regarded as a classic fusion of jazz, rock and roll, psychedelia and classical music, 
Child Is Father to the Man is one of bandleader Al Kooper's most enduring works. The album introduced 
the idea of the big band to rock and roll and paved the way for such groups as Chicago. Kooper left 
the band after this album, changing the nature of the group.

Blood, Sweat & Tears (also known as "BS.T") is an American music group, originally formed in 1967 in New 
York City. Since its beginnings in 1967, the band has gone through numerous iterations with varying personnel 
and has encompassed a multitude of musical styles. What the band is most known for, from its start, is the 
fusing of rock, blues, pop music, horn arrangements, and jazz improvisation into a hybrid that came to be 
known as "jazz-rock". Unlike "jazz fusion" bands, which tend toward virtuostic displays of instrumental 
facility and some experimentation with electric instruments, the songs of Blood, Sweat & Tears merged the 
stylings of rock, pop and R&B/soul music with big band, while also adding elements of 20th Century Classical 
and small combo jazz traditions.
