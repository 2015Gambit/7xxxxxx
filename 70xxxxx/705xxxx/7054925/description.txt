Syndicate-3DM
Syndicate produced by Starbreeze AB

No longer governed by politicians, the developed world is divided up into regions controlled
by mega-corporations known as syndicates. These syndicates have revolutionized how the consumer
interacts with the digital world. Since the consumer requires a device to access the world's data
and control technology, they can do this in the blink of an eye via neural chip implant.
Civilians flocked to be "Chip'd" and enjoy all that their selected syndicate has to offer: housing,
medical, banking, insurance, education, entertainment and jobs. One complete package. One complete
lifestyle. In return, the syndicates gained unprecedented insights, and control, over the individual
and their behavior. With little government oversight, business has become war. 
The syndicates will stop at nothing for ultimate market dominance.

At the first line of this war are the agents, the syndicate's bio-engineered and chip-augmented enforcers.
They can breach anything in the wired dataverse, including their enemies, their weapons and the
environment that surrounds them, making them the most efficient and deadly technological weapons in
the world. Take on the role of Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest prototype agent, and embark on a brutal
action adventure of corruption and revenge.
