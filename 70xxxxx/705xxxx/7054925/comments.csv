[T],PirateBoy,2012-02-24T15:03Z,"I think the game is very good...nice upload EZ. :)

Anyway, I think we should wait for a proper scene release by Skidrow or Reloaded because this version of 3DM will probably have some in-game bugs. But, its worth a try. :)"

,scyris99,2012-02-24T15:51Z,Dear god is there anyway to shut off the frigging bloom they WAY over used it to the point my game screen is completly fuzzy/whited out. There was nothing in the options to turn it off.

,opaleg,2012-02-24T16:12Z,THANK YOU!!!!!!!!! I greatly appreciate the work put into these cracks more and more. I'm getting into math and programming. I think focusing on this will turn me away from the negative things in life I've been focusing on. Thank you uploader and all those that crack games for us. AND TO THE MAKERS OF THE GAME!!

I extracted and copied over the crack content but I get an error message saying mccdyn.dll is missing...I downloaded the missing file from another website and I get another error messages about yet another missing dll file.  Some help would be greatly appreciated 
,namtolng,2012-02-25T00:57Z,Norton says the .exe crack is bad :(
,namtolng,2012-02-25T01:36Z,I guess it's a false positive.

I get stupid 'video unsupported' from my monitor, otherwise the games seems to run (considering the audio). Playing with default_video file doesn't change anything.

,Lockjaw664,2012-02-25T04:13Z,Is anyone else getting a black main menu. It shows the ads for EA and the game developer but when it gets to the main menu I only get audio. I know the menu is there because I hear the sounds that the buttons on the menu make when you scroll over them and I get a menu arrow but that's it.

the game is AWESOME, by the way :D
Thanks EZ for another great upload  ^^"
,Hancock79,2012-02-25T05:38Z,"works perfect.  i'm sure most know this already but there's not really an installation, just run the first RAR .exe file and it unpacks ready to play once you copy the crack over"
,reazul,2012-02-25T07:40Z,"extremezone ..... how can i repay you ????? many thanks ........ 
can anyone tell me, what is the condition of HAWX2 ?????

Many Thanks once again ........"
,mrschmutz,2012-02-25T09:13Z,"If you like me, Can't continue from your previous game because the game can't find your save. Try this:

#Place The entire extracted game in C/Program Files(x86)/Syndicate.

#Go to C/User/""JonDoe""/My Documents/syndicate/SaveGames. 
Copy the default folder and give it a new name. Go inside the folder and give the same name you gave the folder, to the ""_profile"" file. ""ex. JonDoe_profile"".

This worked for me when I started this game and couldn't continue from last save.

Thanks EZ!"

,rayzor.edge,2012-02-25T15:02Z,"Instructions:

1. Download this torrent.
2. Make sure the 3DM crack is in it.
3. Replace original with crack files to Syndicate\System\Win32_x86_Release.
4. Run Syndicate.exe in the same folder.

You do NOT have to install Syndicate, so do NOT run the setup included in this ISO. It's for Origin. I don't know if you actually need to have Origin to have the crack work because I already had it for BF3.

You WILL get a malware alert for Syndicate.exe. Trust or not, I use Comodo and although it does automatically quarantine it as malware, I turned off JUST the AV and Defense+ hasn't detected any unusual activity with it.

Been playing for a couple of hours and it works great. Hope this helps some of you guys. Running Windows 7 64-bit."

,namtolng,2012-02-25T19:41Z,"I get why it would be a false-positive, any crack is dangerously close to being picked up as malware [whether it is or not] to begin with simply because of the coding. It's completely a false-positive this case though, don't worry."

I've got the same problem on Milestone 12 (AKA: Right after it says ""Why did she help me?"") that I fall straight through the ship the MOMENT I hit W instead of going forward I go backwards and fall inside of the ship, dafaq batman.

I saw that some one suggested 800x600 with the 4:3 ratio and I was like OH MY GOD, SOME ONE WITH MY PROBLEM, I'M SAVED. Until it didn't work, then I lost my mind and I've now been at this for an hour and i've got a list now of what resolutions I have tried with what settings and nothing is working.

Oh and before you EVEN say it, yes I've tried default didn't do dick, i've also tried swapping to Skidrow's Crack and that also did nothing with the resolution change."

,Mahoraba33,2012-02-29T14:58Z,"Holy fucking shit i found something that honestly I should of thought so much sooner.

If you get stuck inside the ship ever: Hold (Ctrl+Alt + `) This will open a command window and can be closed with the same key combination.

In this window type exactly (with caps and everything) that I do as follows: cmd(NoClip)

Typing that once will enable it, typing it again will turn it off."
