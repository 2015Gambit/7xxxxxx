,soulcoma,2012-02-24T05:00Z,"@Dickford57: Resolution is relative. I watch shows and movies on my Laptop unless it's with the family and the smaller the file, the better. Now, m4v would be suitable for mobile only, but MP4, if done right, as this file is, is PERFECT. And I'm sorry to hear you live in Pekin. The Hole in The Wall? Is that a bar? You are an impressive man calling people out on the internet. I admire you."
