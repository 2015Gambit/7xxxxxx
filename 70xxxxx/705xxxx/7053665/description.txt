In Concert / MTV Plugged is a 1992 concert video and 1993 live album by Bruce Springsteen.

It is part of MTV's Unplugged series, recorded on September 22, 1992 at the Warner Hollywood Studios 
in Los Angeles during the midst of Springsteen's Other Band Tour.

Bruce Springsteen famously played one song, the previously unreleased Red Headed Woman, solo on 
acoustic guitar, then he and the Other Band (this was during the time the E Street Band was dissolved) 
used amplified instruments the rest of the show hence, the concert was called MTV Plugged 
(sometimes written XXPlugged after the album cover art). Reportedly Springsteen had been unhappy with 
the touring band's rehearsals of acoustic arrangements, and this is what led him to break the Unplugged 
format.
