This is Jonathan Marshall's, Peter Dale Scott's and Jane Hunter's explosive book The Iran-Contra Connection - Secret Teams and Covert Operations in Reagan Era (1987) which delves into the details of CIA and extra-CIA operations including drug-trafficking, gun-running, government-toppling, and assassination. By using the vacuum-cleaner approach it sucks up every possible lead, every hint of connection, to construct a picture of the Iran-contra affair as part of a coordinated global system of covert action beyond the law. The authors argue that the Iran-Contra scandal is not merely a plan gone awry, but a consistent outgrowth of a long tradition of covert U.S. activities. From the Bay of Pigs invasion teams to the NSC organizational team; from the CIA and the World Anti-Communist League to the Israeli connection and State Department; this is the full story, unfettered by concerns of "damage control." The Iran-Contra Connection lays bare the full details of the dramatic events, exposing the personalities and institutional relations behind the headlines. It goes beyond the specific events of the recent period to discern the roots of contemporary U.S. covert activity in the recent history. Find out who actually created the terrorist boogeymen you keep hearing so much about. 310 pages. A must read for everyone.
