Notes -

Video very very nice rls from our friends P76, much respect! video needed a little cropping and resizing but very nice rip,
there is a slight change over in the middle where cammer must have changed film or re started cam, who knows, but we try to
be as honest as we can:p Audio is nice cam, we used this on our 1st rls of the movie and had already been filtered and cleaned.
This is a very nice rls now and we hope you all enjoy this movie!
