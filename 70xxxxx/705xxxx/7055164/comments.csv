[T],promodsharma,2012-02-25T04:55Z,"@'blacksidex6' - The serial is perfect & working. You must have gone online while installing, which you have been expressly warned not to do in the instructions. No other downloader has this problem. "
,Lanook,2012-03-02T16:20Z,Serial does not work! I was offline the whole time. The serial is invalid. 
,Lanook,2012-03-02T16:32Z,Can anyone update the serial? Please
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-03T15:10Z,@'Lanook' & 'blacksidex6' - The serial is valid & working. I have retested it. The serial does not need updating. There must be something that you have overlooked.

,Christoffer0002,2012-06-07T03:45Z,tomswiftx: use ccleaner and clean register. Then try reinstall
