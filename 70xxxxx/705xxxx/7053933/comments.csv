And audio is not out of sync, if it is your codecs suck."

,dallanlee,2012-02-27T21:13Z,"Smaller file size than the usual ~360Mb xvids yet better quality! Thanks eztv! Keep the .h264 coming, please!"
,dallanlee,2012-02-27T21:14Z,"I was skeptical of a sudden .h264 mp4 file of smaller size vs the usual xvid avi. I do prefer h264 (mp4 and mkv) over xvid/avi but most uploaders haven't switched to mp4 or mkv for tv episodes. I downloaded both the h264 and the xvid and the quality is actually a little better on this .h264 file although it's only 2/3 the size! Although it's only slightly better (both audio and video), on top of that, it's smaller and my preferred codec."
