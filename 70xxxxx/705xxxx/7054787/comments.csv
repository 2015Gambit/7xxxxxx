Ok, thanks =)
Didn't encounter such trojans in cracks before, that I can't even get access to it without disabeling protection.. =)"
,OmniNegro,2012-02-24T19:05Z,"Most AV is controlled by the media trolls. They see someone cracks their cash cow and so they submit a part of the exe as a virus. The AV companies cannot test everything to be certain, so when the media trolls submit hundreds of false positives most will be accepted as probable due to the sheer number of submissions.

Report the exe as safe and they *MAY* add you to a list that can be used against you since you clearly use the crack in question. That is why most f us do not use active AV anyway. I use Clamwin. I scan as needed and let the rest be blocked by my firewall until I can manually kill the pesty little malware.

This is safe. Several trusted sources have verified this. Read the comments in the other posts too if you still have doubt."
,MohamedkhaledM_K,2012-02-24T22:39Z,good good thanks
,PistolSlap,2012-03-04T08:16Z,"Um, yeah. Before I used this exe, I received a virus report about TR/Black.Gen2, which was listed as a very hazardous virus. 

Your comment said it was a verified false positive, completely fine.  

I used it.

A little later I got a pop up from my AV saying I had the TR/Black.Gen2 virus in my *system volume information*.

Now, if this were such an innocuous false positive, I have no idea how I could have gotten that exact same virus embedded in my system moments after executing the file that the virus was supposed to not have existed in.

Don't advertise things as clean when they're obviously not."
