for some reason just load torrent if not sure to check"
,fckenbullsht,2012-02-24T18:41Z,"psspss, thanks so much for your hard work.  i am new at this so i am asking for advice.

i can't watch any other format besides xvid and mp3 sound, so i have tried converting mkv files to avi or xvid, but the quality is low when i convert using GOM or divx converter.  can you recommend any good program to convert mkv files.  if i can find a way, i can start to upload and contribute to the community.  thanks for your help."
,27825634,2012-02-24T20:51Z,"@frckenbullsht-update your codecs first off and then you wont need to convert...use KMPlayer to watch video files, its not as complicated as VLC but it gets the job done without effort"
[V],psspss,2012-02-25T00:55Z,"kmplayer is resource heavy and like most players
even VLC 2.1 it can hang up with scrolling..fast forwarding a mp4

mp4 needs more cpu to decode it to watch it
unless xvids

xvids work on older gear like dvd players with divx5
support

suggest thought if using pc search TPB for VLC
and grab the latest 2.1 build..

it works amazing for 64bit the 64 vlc

and 32bit is amazing too"
[V],psspss,2012-02-25T00:58Z,"I found umileencoder seemed to do a good job without much of a learning curve has presets for xbox and other phones 

but i use the freeware AVIDEMUX.org to convert
my stuff or virtualdub is still sometimes better
for editing out ads I find avidemux editing can
cut out more frames then selected"
,fckenbullsht,2012-02-25T02:24Z,"thanks for the input everyone.  i should have mention, i have a micca player.  it plays xvid and avi with mp3 sound.  but it does not play mkv files or mp4.  i tried converting a few movies from mkv or mp4  to avi so that i can upload but the quality is really bad.  playing things on my pc, i have no problem with any format, it is when i play it on a micca player.  once again, thanks for any future input."
[V],psspss,2012-02-27T02:34Z,"SORRY AUDIO IS OUT OF SYNC

yeh I didnt notice.. seems a problem with the new sources that are mkvs and mp4 are loosing sound sync when converting to our old fav xvids

its easy to fix if you no how many MS out it is

you can use avidemux to copy the video but change the sound
and time shift it.. either -300ms or +300ms often fixes
is it 1second? seems a lot

also you can watch it and track sync it in VLC

I really havent the bandwidth to reup the fix again"
,Farvamus--Prime,2012-02-27T02:47Z,Audio is about a millisec off. other than that great
[V],psspss,2012-02-27T02:56Z,"if you use track sync and add +200ms seems to
be fine to me??

its not that much out not noticable why I missed
it its hard to understand these folks anyhow
why so many subs lol :)

agian avidemux.org can fix the sound sync
in like 3 minutes write the fixed avi if want to try it

anyhow looks like someone might of fixed and uploading
a new version icrap?"
[V],psspss,2012-02-27T02:58Z,on VLC player like under tools pull down
