,Jeraiya,2012-04-25T09:24Z,"Dear All, please every body put the upload speed to unlimeted since it will increase your download speed and will not affect your ISP qouta
I raised up my upload speed to 1MB "
,xProcreator,2012-05-04T14:15Z,"Wtf. I download this, and half it registers as audiofiles that play through Winamp. Any idea how to fix this, I'll Seed it indefinitely if I can get it to work. "
,xProcreator,2012-05-04T14:22Z,I figured it out. Seemed odd that I could use my media player for half of them.. but not the other. Anyway I'll seed.
,TheTroutsMask,2012-05-08T06:26Z,VLC media player will play all of them. Finished the torrent about a month ago. Took 5.5 days. So worth it. Watched the whole Dragonball series and working on Dragonball Z. Thank you so much. :D
