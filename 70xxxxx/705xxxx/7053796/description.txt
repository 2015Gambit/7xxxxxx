I just want to point out to those expecting this software to copy retail DVD Movies; it canâ€™t. According to LGSoftware, they removed the integrated decryptor that was used to decrypt all Retail DVD Movies sold/rented in North America do to pressure from Federal and International Law. They recommend you use a 3rd Party Decryptor. (I use DVD Fab myself, it does it all.)
 
1 Click will copy your own none protected DVDâ€™s, thatâ€™s pretty much it.
 
Hereâ€™s a link to LGSoftware disclaimer to further assist People running into â€œThis DVD is Encryptedâ€ when trying to copy any rented or purchased DVDâ€™s.
