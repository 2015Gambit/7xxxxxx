D.A.R.Y.L. Ã¨ un film di fantascienza del 1985 diretto da Simon Wincer, che tratta di un particolare esperimento scientifico sull'intelligenza artificiale.
Il titolo Ã¨ l'acronimo di "Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform", traducibile in "Robot analizzatore di dati sottoforma di adolescente"
(la localizzazione italiana lo ha fatto diventare "Dati Adolescente Robotico Ittrio Laserizzato").

Daryl Ã¨ un bambino con una strana amnesia che viene trovato a vagare senza meta dalla famiglia Richardson.
Dopo averlo portato a casa e accudito per alcuni giorni scoprono che il ragazzo puÃ² far cose che tutti gli altri non sono in grado di fare.
Il suo comportamento Ã¨ strano e insospettisce la signora Richardson, che si sente particolarmente frustrata perchÃ© il piccolo Ã¨ fin troppo perfetto:
non dice mai parolacce, si comporta sempre in modo impeccabile ed Ã¨ sempre disponibile.
Sembra che non abbia bisogno di insegnamenti da parte di nessuno.
Ma a parte questo i due coniugi si affezionano molto a lui, che nel frattempo ha fatto anche amicizia con i bambini del vicinato.
Ma un giorno si presentano alla porta un uomo e una donna che dichiarano essere i suoi veri genitori...


D.A.R.Y.L. is a 1985 American science fiction film which was written by David Ambrose, Allan Scott and Jeffrey Ellis.
It was directed by Simon Wincer and stars Barret Oliver, Mary Beth Hurt, Michael McKean, Danny Corkill, and Josef Sommer.
The original music score was composed by Marvin Hamlisch.
The movie was filmed in Orlando and Dillsboro, NC.

"Daryl" (whose name is an acronym for "Data-Analysing Robot Youth Lifeform") (Barret Oliver) is an experiment in artificial intelligence, created by the government.
Despite his name, he is actually not a robot (which is a fully mechanical automaton), but rather a cyborg.
His brain is a super-sophisticated microcomputer, but the rest of his body is human, which allows him to absorb vast amounts of data via sensory input.
Although Daryl is physically indistinguishable from an ordinary ten-year-old boy, his computer brain gives him a number of unique capabilities.
These include exceptional reflexes, superhuman multitasking ability, and the ability to "hack" other computer systems.
The D.A.R.Y.L. experiment was funded by the military, with the intention of producing a "super-soldier".
One of the original scientists has misgivings about the experiment and decides to free Daryl, but is killed in the process.
Daryl is found by an elderly couple and taken to an orphanage.
He does not remember who or what he is.
Though a normal pre-adolescent boy in most aspects,
Daryl begins to exhibit extraordinary talents after he goes to live with foster parents Joyce (Mary Beth Hurt) and Andy Richardson (Michael McKean),
including uncanny abilities at baseball, the ability to manipulate bank funds by interfacing with an ATM, and in playing video games.
He is also introduced to the neighbors of the Richardsons: Howie (Steve Ryan) and Elaine Fox (Colleen Camp) and their children Sherie (Amy Linker) and Turtle (Danny Corkill).
As Daryl was raised in isolation, his social skills are quite limited.
His friend Turtle, who is unusually vulgar and obnoxious even for a ten-year-old boy, helps him develop them...
