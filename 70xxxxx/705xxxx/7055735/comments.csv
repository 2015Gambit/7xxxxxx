[T],promodsharma,2012-02-25T05:05Z,Thanks ! A good upload.
,JAB69,2012-02-26T11:48Z,"waste of time, crack doesnt work !"
[V],ChattChitto,2012-02-26T22:48Z,Crack does work.
,bludanube,2012-02-28T21:05Z,"As always, works perfectly - greatly appreciated! Always enjoy the music selections too! "
,Dashman666,2012-02-28T21:25Z,"Sorry, none of the codes work for me either!  Arghhh.. Love this program too!"
,bludanube,2012-02-28T22:19Z,"Try running the appropriate crack after install, make sure the app is closed. In my instance, I ran the install, applied the automated cracking 2, then launched the program and used the last serial # on the list. Registered successfully, unchecked automatic update option. Running Windows 7 pro x86."
[V],ChattChitto,2012-02-28T23:52Z,"If the Serial is still showing as invalid follow these Instructions please:
""Xilisoft added a hidden registry key, which wont allow you to add any more keys after the first key gets blocked. So here is a workaround:
1-Start
2-Run
3-Type in Regedit
4-Select HKEY_USERS
5-Press Ctrl + f (Search)
6-Search for {C06F4056-C35F-4bf8-A93A-9F098F3E503D}
7-Delete the Key, including the subkeys""

Credits to blackboxcard for writing the Instructions."

This is where I always come first.
thx always"
,boxgml,2012-03-04T15:36Z,Great upload! Thanks.
,artbell2,2012-03-05T15:47Z,"I ran the setup program, Automated Cracking and the serial. But why is the program showing Chinese characters instead of English? It appears to be working but how did I end up with Chinese version? I've successfully installed many of ChattChitto's stuff. This is the 1st mystery for me. Thanks in advance for your response. "
,jupitersmist,2012-03-08T20:54Z,The reason you're getting chinese characters is because you didn't select English when you registered it.  You would probably have to uninstall then reinstall.  The first choice you click to move forward is the language screen and it defaults with chinese for some reason (alphabetical?) This torrent works great!  Thanks ChattoChitto
,deepandhard,2012-03-10T06:39Z,Works fine on Win7 64bit. Used one of the serials to register it. Thanks for the upload and Long Live the Pirates!
,coolnsexy19,2012-03-10T10:30Z,"Job done!!!!!!!!!!!! Excellent upload
long live ChattChitto"
,MandoPop,2012-03-10T12:40Z,"ChattChitto u r the best :D
Thanks"
,artbell2,2012-03-10T23:22Z,"Jupiter, Thanks for the tip but I reattempted 3 separate times (uninstall & reinstall & reboot) but I could not find a language screen choices, or anything regarding languages. It just doesn't show that option up on my computer. btw, I'm running Win7Ultimate 64bit. "
,leracos,2012-03-12T08:49Z,"FYI, if serials don't work (even after deleting the registry key) try copying the crack manually instead of using the automated methods. I had trouble with it too, but after copying the crack manually it worked fine."
,phnx7,2012-03-13T01:00Z,why is it in Japanese ?
,CommonsCarnival,2012-03-13T05:35Z,"The serials didn't work even after deleting the registration keys so I had to manually move the crack to the Xillsoft directory. I was confused and thought it didn't work at first because it still said it was a trial and prompted me for a user name and code. You can just enter WHATEVER you want though and it says ""success!"""
,mosulica64,2012-03-17T17:02Z,you are the best 
,rehceel99,2012-03-17T17:51Z,ay... ay... captain! :)
,skulldragon,2012-03-19T03:02Z,"Crack works perfectly on the latest version.

Thanks for the crack and the instructions for unblacklisting!


But Chatti, why do you always use that awful ""launcher program"" of yours? Why can't we just have the program and it's cures the simple way?

If anybody wants to separate the installer and the crack from this pack, then start the launcher program - it then extracts all of its contents to %Temp% dir and inside ir_ext_temp_0 > AutoPlay > Docs you'll find them.
If you close the launcher program, then ir_ext_temp_0 gets erased."
,BigTown,2012-03-21T05:16Z,"This was working now it's not. Tried every solution on here. Removal of the registry key doesn't work any more. It always comes back. Manually moving the crack doesn't work. Uninstall/reinstall doesn't work. Been downloading Xilisoft cracks for a long time and none of them ever last. None.

There must be some other hidden registry key the program adds? Maybe multiple keys?

Actually, let me say this: I can use the program but I have to add the name/serial every time I use it, because after I close it it reverts back to trial. I have to do this every time I use it, the crack is not sticking for some reason.

But I will say thanks for the work, CC, not disparaging you here.

,Kal-El7,2012-03-24T20:11Z,"Hello, 

Can anyone tell me why this would not install what-so-ever for me in Windows 7 until I turned OFF SpyBot? I know about False-positives, but you would see my other anti-malwares goin' off as well, avast, Norton 360, Lavasoft, etc. Only Spybot, which is aimed toward spyware & not trojans/worms/viruses/adware, was preventing this download. I'm curious as to why...

I tried to extract the executable so I can install just the package I needed, but then the executable is password-protected so that you MUST install the application using the circumvented package...and thus, making you install also whatever Spybot was red-flagging. 

Same thing happened to me with version 7.0.1

So, I'm curious!! "
,anni1994,2012-03-26T16:01Z,thanks a lot it works perfectly

,prince.asher,2012-04-04T08:10Z,"Hello ChattChitto!! It works perfectly but how do I change the language in it? I'd love to have it in english because unfortunately, I can't understand the language and I can't maximize this wonderful software that you uploaded. More power!!"
,prince.asher,2012-04-04T08:15Z,"Oh..sorry for wasting your time..hahaha..i already found how to change the language..it's the fifth option the a sub-menu will appear..just select the second one with an arrow on it and it give you the option ""english""...MORE POWER TO YOU!!! KUDOS!!!"
,ahearns,2012-04-18T08:41Z,None of this matters! His crack will fail in 5-6 weeks. so use  it while u can!
,r41n1sm,2012-04-24T02:43Z,Wait do i search it with the brackets? I can't find the registry...
,r41n1sm,2012-04-24T06:49Z,"Ok, the regedit way won't work with other people's torrents, only ChattChitto's xilisoft. But still, great up."
