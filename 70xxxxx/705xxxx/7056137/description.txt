Itha Ivide Vare is a 1977 Malayalam classic directed by I.V. Sasi. The movie stars Madhu, M.G. Soman, Adoor Bhasi, Sharada, Jayabharati and Jayan. The plot is about seeking the revenge. Vishwanathan's childhood is ruined because of his father's illegitimate relationship with his mother's sister. Things go wrong and his father and mother are both killed. He returns back to his village years later to seek revenge for his parents' murder. The movie boasts of some superflous performances by Soman, Madhu, Jayan and their likes. I.V. Sasi creates a poetic narrative style that enthralls the viewers

Unfortunately I could not get English subtitles for it. This is a VCD rip.

I would personally rate the Audio & Video quality at 8/10.
