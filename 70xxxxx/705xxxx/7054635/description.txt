HE MOST 'REALISTIC' 737NG CREW SIMULATION EVER...
Designed in close consultation with a real-world 737 Captain, this new Edition of FS2Crew brings your iFly 737NG to life by adding an interactive flight, cabin and ground crew to the aircraft!
With the iFLY's powerful SDK, the integration between FS2Crew and the iFly 737 is seamless and clean.
Take your iFly 737 to the next level with FS2Crew. It will change the way you fly!
THIS IS NOT A 'VOICE CONTROL' PRODUCT. YOU DO NOT NEED HEADSET/MICROPHONE. ANY USER FROM ANY COUNTRY CAN USE THIS PRODUCT!!!
Product notes: 
The product is 'Button Control', not 'Voice Control'.
The benefit of this is that 'anyone' can use the software. You don't need a microphone, you don't need to speak English, and you don't need to be able to set your Windows Speech Recognizer to English.
