As Mark Twain said, if you want to tell people the truth, you\'d better make them laugh when you do it, or else they\'ll kill you.

Bill Maher likes to start it up by critiquing people\'s relationship with their Invisible Pal. He correctly and courageously pins a lot of America\'s backwardness on those millions who would prefer to contemplate a perfect non-existent world to a real world that needs plenty of fixing.

Maher was host of TV\'s Pollitically Incorrect until it was shanghaied, likely because he did the non-cognitive-dissonant thing and said the 9/11 terrorists were brave men (which they were, in addition to being sociopathic religious fanatics). At times, Maher is the measured, gentlemanly \"but seriously folks\" sideman to Jon Stewart\'s rebelliousness: capable of taking a blimp-launching nutter like Ron Paul and polishing him up to the point where Ron Paul.com feels like officially linking to the I-view. But that\'s the point: every night, and every time Maher opens his mouth, he makes someone mad.
