The idea for this album was to provide only the words and have other artists remix or add their own music to the tracks they liked and Shane and his friends would decide on their favorites and then release the album in conjunction with those artists. Turns out that after recording the album so many people asked for it he thought why not just release it to the public as a straight spoken word cd. So here it is... Shut Up And Say Something is an intensely personal album touching on subjects from politics to family to love and loss in a way only Shane can deliver.
