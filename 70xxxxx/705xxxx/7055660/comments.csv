[V],gansuk,2012-02-24T21:58Z,@Fatfrumos try reading all the description.
,OmniNegro,2012-02-24T23:28Z,"@Fatfrumos

Could you possibly be a bit more specific? What OS are you using? XP has known issues with the game.

What hardware are you using? How much free space on your HD? What GPU? I and others would be happy to help you, but you cannot expect help if you do not tell us what we must know to help you.

Good luck."

Check your computer system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program and then contact the software publisher."" when I try to run the .exe.

I get this on all the versions though. I have Win7 64bit Ultimate."
