thanks anyway."
,tommyle,2012-02-27T07:40Z,"Good episode, but the thing is that the top and bottom are cut off."
,BDiddy1123,2012-02-27T08:13Z,"I'm assuming that C_P records this full frame, which means there would be black bars at the top and bottom. When he reframes it, it removes the black bars along with anything else in that area.
Just a guess, though."
,newton8573,2012-02-27T18:39Z,"i hope the 720p versions get uploaded soon

the quality is bad, more then usual"
,Spambolo,2012-02-28T21:26Z,"Yeah, it is even slightly less good image-wise than CP's part one, last week. But again, no image missing and on a 22'' LCD monitor it's fine. Last week's one looked fine on my 43'' Samsung Plasma TV, but I reckon this one wouldn't pass muster there."
,8ibn5r,2012-03-04T05:16Z,Need Episode 3... anyone know why these are so slow to be posted?
,tommyle,2012-03-04T07:26Z,"It takes a while for them to upload the episodes. Perhaps, too long."
,tommyle,2012-03-04T09:59Z,I hope they upload the next episode within the next few minutes. I'm dying to see the conclusion!!!
