BIO:
 
My name is TomÃ¡s Vergara, a self taught 3d artist and a film nut. 

As for now, Iâ€™m 25. 

I was born in Chile and I live here. 

In 2011, I left my full time job in advertising to produce The Chase, my first 

personal project, completed in an isolated cabin in the woods. 

It took me 6 months to produce, but 8 in total to complete because of slow render 

times. 

My budget was US $700.
