John Fahey has been a mercurial and eccentric presence in the American music world for almost four decades. Only 95 copies were ever made of Fahey's first plunge into music recording, a self-released album of instrumental guitar songs known as Blind Joe Death (1959), yet the album eventually became known as "the most famous obscure album of recent times," according to the New Rolling Stone Record Guide. Such ironies became hallmarks of Fahey's career. Many of his subsequent recordings are regarded as seminal testaments to the beauty of the acoustic guitar, and Spin contributor Byron Coley called Fahey "as monumental and singular a musical talent as any this country has produced." Despite such critical acclaim, however, the guitarist has been saddled with struggles against illness, excessive drinking, and economic uncertainty. By the mid-1990s Fahey, regarded by many as the father of what is sometimes called the contemporary fingerpicking guitar style, could be found living in a series of welfare motels and Salvation Army locales.
Fahey was born on February 28, 1939, in Takoma Park, Maryland.
