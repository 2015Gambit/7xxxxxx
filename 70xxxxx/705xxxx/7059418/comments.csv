Thanks thehiddentest. For making an ISO from these files(and using it in virtualbox) I've followed these instructions http://fab.over-blog.org/article-comment-creer-un-dvd-ou-iso-amor-able-bootable-de-windows-seven-38210882.html (sorry, it's in french ;)) and I've found cdimage.exe here: http://code.google.com/p/create-iso-file/downloads/detail?name=CDIMAGE.EXE

,chaozassassin,2012-03-14T21:46Z,"To thehiddentest,

i have downloaded the torrent, and it is a zipped folder, now the question is do i just burn to a dvd+rw and put it into the laptop and it will start up the setup? 

also my other laptop is stuck on windows xp setup, found out some keys dont work on the laptop so cant proceed product key entry, will it over ride the os setup and start the windows 7 setup?

p.s a guide could have helped for the unexperienced

thanks"
,chaozassassin,2012-03-14T21:54Z,"last comment disapeared,

downloaded and its zipped do i unzip it? or just burn it to a disc.

also my friends computer is stuck on windows xp setup will this overide the os?"
,chaozassassin,2012-03-15T16:31Z,"finally got it done works great cheers thehiddentest,

I had to unzip it with winzip software, extracted it to my portible hard drive and multiboot the computer from that hard drive worked like a charm, i assume extracted to a dvd-rw will do the same,

thanks again"

,thehiddentest,2012-04-01T01:01Z,"Ok, i ripped this directly off the original Windows installation disk, and added a few files to it, so whatever you can do on the original disk you can do on this one..... (Upgrade, Boot-up installation, restore to factory installation, and more)"
,knglerxst,2012-04-03T03:22Z,"Thanks thehiddentest.  It's working great.  To anyone thinking of trying it or having trouble with the install, I just copied the files to a USB thumb drive and rebooted.  You don't have to create an .iso.  Also, you don't have to activate it.  After my install, it showed as fully activated.  "

,jwol2222,2012-05-03T02:21Z,Is there an install guide? telling ow to partition the harddrive if you even need to do that?
,jwol2222,2012-05-03T02:23Z,"Also will i need to back up my documents and if so cani just copy the entire local disk onto a portable hard drive?

Sorry about all the questions, i never really use torrents"
,thehiddentest,2012-05-11T23:41Z,"yes, you can copy them all on the usb device...

or after you install the new windows, go into the c drive or your default drive, then click windows.old then users then all your saved files should be there.....just drag them wherever "
,CaptainProton,2012-09-07T17:40Z,"This stuff is not bootable!
I tried it with a DVD and a USB stick (I put the extracted archive on it as mentioned here), but it doesn't recognize it.
Gonna download a good old .iso now, this sucks."
