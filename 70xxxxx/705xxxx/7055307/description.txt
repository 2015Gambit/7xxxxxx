Chelsea vs Napoli



It's been an incredibly exciting and eventful first 45min, at Stadio San Paolo, and to the surprise of absolutely no one, neither Chelsea or Napoli has been able to get through the First half with a clean sheet intact. 

Hugo Campagnaro and Didier Drogba had an early collision, resulting in fountain of blood forming on Campagnaro's forehead. It appeared as if the two teams would head into halftime tied.
