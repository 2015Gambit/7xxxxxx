you are ignorant, like most christians out there

-god is not power, KNOWLEDGE is power
-you bible discredits knowledge at all costs...why, it's TOTAL BULLSHIT MAN UP BY MAN
-YOU need to educate yourself. The universe didn't explode from a spec. Like most christains, you purposely ignore the fact when they don't coincide with your myopic views. Research what the REAL bang bang theory and don't write some 3rd grade nonsense about how the universe started. To help you along, the explosion didn't contain everything in the universe, it developed over time, starting with basic atoms like carbon and forming others over long periods of time. 
 - anyone with a 5th grade reading comprehension level can see the bible is just a bunch of contradictions and crap made up by man with a limited view of the world. Arguing that it is real shows just how low your level of education really is. 
-christianity and islam are NOT moral and go against humanity at all costs. If you say no, then you haven't read either book

And on the religious debate:
@hachiko00

I agree that knowledge is power. And that those who wrote the bible were limited in their views as that is all they knew at the time. But Science and Religion can work hand in hand. I love Science and technology but I also love the fact that Bible's underlying message is to love your fellow man. 
Isn't it interesting how all those who who wish to exert their scientific beliefs over religious believers have one fear in common, that is that when you die nothing will happen and you will fade away, is it that fear which makes you have a dig @token923?
Point is it doesn't really matter what religion you believe in. If you try to be a loving person then you are making yourself a better person and whether you believe or not, your ""creator"" proud.

First off:
V-7 (Yes u should be using VLC by now o_O and just press C a few times )
A-9
M-8 
Let me say I am an Atheist and despise being ""preached"" to, however at no point did I feel this was being done in the movie to try and change MY feelings on religion.
This IS however an amazing and thought provoking movie. Based on a true story of a ""preacher"" trying to build an orphanage in war-torn Africa, but who goes about it in a very un-Christian manner....with an army!
Brilliantly written, directed and acted, this is a very well made movie, and massively engaging.
To address the other comments here, both hatefilled and dismissive (yes there are religious speeches in it but very short and as a theatrical device to show his anger with his ""flock""), and glowing and uncritical (I wouldn't trust opinions that seem biased either way). A true work of art should neither confirm or deny peoples BELIEFS, only seek to show how they effect the characters and the world around them.

Religion used to say the Universe is static (stationary for you illiterates) and infinite. We now know , FACT: the universe is dynamic (moving) and finite, not infinite. More stars are dying then new one being created. Take some intro astronomy classes before you run your brainwashed religious mouth. If you don;t believe it, ask any astrophysicist."

reality. or so (check my name, I'm not a friend of the church), first half of the movie was still hinting on dogma, of course trying to set the scene. beyond that this movie is brings things together that shouldn't need to be discussed on a pirate board but have to apparently. download it, watch it, there is no dogma, the christian scenario only points out the sad reality that in our culture people need something to make them realize *right* from *wrong* and too often it happens to be a re-born situation. anyway, did my minutes run out? watch the movie, it's worth the time!!"

,kris_tof,2012-03-02T17:17Z,"@carpetburn983: you seem a little bit confused regarding science. Science is about learning more about the world in which we live. The more data we collect the more we learn, and that is why science is constantly changing/improving. 

Religion however is all written in stone and never change, except for the interpretations of the scriptures. That is why religious people even in todays modern society still believe in talking snakes and burning bushes."

Well, just watched some science program and they said that current thinking is that we live in just one universe, one of many. That we exist in a multiverse. Each of us are our own authority for ourselves. We each define our own right and wrong and then live by that right and wrong. We have been blowing the shit out of each other for an eternity and don't seem to be getting anywhere. "

Have you ever read the bible before? maybe you should. I can't deny that the Bible was written a long time ago. but this book is constantly changing people to better person for centuries. If you go to my church and watch the people when they come for the first time and later on the years. you will see a complete different person. The bible make you smart as you need to think how to adapt every sentence to your live. that the reason why is written in that way. so it will adapt to everyone before, now and all the years to come. ;)

I deeply invite you to read it.
God Bless you."

My 2 cents:
As long as something divine is spread by human hands the true meaning will be contaminated most of the time. People define the words of interpret religion their own way, which leads to a better person if you're lucky or a war in worst case. Regardless, the problem lies with human beings."

Aspect ratio is totally screwed up in this video, download another rip because you'll hate watching this one.

Also, this movie sucks, its plot is ridiculous and unbelievable. Very cheesy and poorly executed. Normally I tolerate Gerard Butler but his attempt at a hillbilly accent was retarded, as was most of the movie's dialogue. 

If you want to watch a hollywood movie about how screwed up things are in Africa then go for something like Lord of War or Blood Diamond. 

Or better yet, seek out some quality documentaries and actually learn something... "

Hate it when America always portrays the black man as a victim and the single white guy as the selfless hero who saves the day. There's no 'inspiration' in that.
