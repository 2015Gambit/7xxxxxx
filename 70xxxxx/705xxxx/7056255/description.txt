SSX XBOX360-SPARE 

Redefining the SSX franchise, SSX will pit riders versus both mountain and man. Players will explore 
the story of a team who seek to be the first to descend the faces of the most treacherous mountain 
ranges on the planet. The team will travel the world to face the worst that Mother Nature can throw 
at them. From the peaks of the Himalayas, where the air is so thin that riders have to descend through 
the death zone at breakneck speeds to keep from blacking out, to the solid ice ranges of Antarctica, 
where a sunlit line is the only survival option when temperatures drop 50 degrees centigrade in the 
shade. And the mountain isn't the only danger players will face. In SSX the first goal is to survive. 
The second, in true SSX fashion, is to look good doing it.
