I don't know if you do requests or not. but if you do and have some spare time,can you upload black[2006 xbox game] modified to run on xbox360.Thank you for all your other uploads...."
,miflezet,2012-02-25T16:10Z,"Hi, 2 questions:
1. does this game need patching like Amalur needed in order to run on LT 2.0?
2. Lot's of comments on utorrent say that the file included here is actually gay porn! which is it realy: gay porn or SSX - the snowboarding game?"
[V],boobsman,2012-02-25T21:44Z,"@ sam_tauras_1990 this is XGD2 no downgrader or topology needed.

@ gunnersrock i do take requests if i have the game which in this case i don't, i'll have a look n see if i can find it but its years old n will be hard to find now :(

@ miflezet what a stupid f'ing question! Its SSX for xbox360, any comments you read elsewhere are from pricks!"
[T],FatFreddy224,2012-02-25T22:11Z,Ok.cheers....

,dev23923,2012-02-26T06:26Z,how did u get this? its not even out  yet
[V],boobsman,2012-02-26T15:06Z,"@ 41212, 50mb is your direct download speed, bit torrent is measured differently so you divide that by 8, your max torrent download would be 6.25mb. 

That said the reason you get low speeds is because so many people hit n run or slow there upload speeds to maximise there download speed n therefore slow it for everyone else. This is on a seedbox and will continue to upload."

,taffy2191,2012-03-01T18:31Z,Hi folks hoping somebody can help me here i have a modded 360 doing my games ok on my comp but just downloaded mw3 on mates as a rar file and the iso file is not there i get 4 files with audio video system update and default. which i dont get with my comp i get the lots of rar file can you help me with this thanks 
,Smallz94,2012-03-01T20:39Z,"@taffy2191
i will help  those are the iso files lol. Run them through abgx360  promise you it will show up. If u still need help, give me your email address so i cans send u a link of my vid about download games and in the video will show the iso files or rar files with audio etc... "
,skatemstr8,2012-03-02T02:01Z,"@TPBPolice

What file did you have to change? What did you name it? I am having the same trouble."
,Smallz94,2012-03-02T02:23Z,"like i said it better to show u my vid then explaining it here. The whole thing is a iso file. The file that contains audio, video, update, etc. rename that one file to a iso file. Once you browse for your iso file on abgx360, it will show a rar file of watever game. Give your email addresses if u want to see the vid. This will help a lot.."
,miflezet,2012-03-02T09:47Z,"Hi, I burned the disc just like any other xbox game (last one I burned was KOA - and it worked!), however when I put it into the machine it gives me the ""Mixed Media Disc""! have I done anything wrong?"
,Mr.Ruud,2012-03-02T14:53Z,"Hey, at a certain point the game freezes, the first time i burned it using the layer break in the tutorial. Then i got the iso through abgx to create a new dvd. file and the game still freezes at the same point in the game. Anybody knows what i should do?"
,thah95,2012-03-02T18:56Z,I am pretty new to this Xbox stuff so does anyone have a tutorial for me? Do i need modded xbox and so on... Thanks in advance.

anujeith@ymail.com

i burned the image using imgburn normally and it didnt work in my xbox ... it says MIXED MEDIA DISK  error .. what should i do ???"
,masse01,2012-03-03T07:46Z,"the disc is labelled xgd2dvd_ntsc, is this why people are getting mixed media? Or is it region free as stated?  "
,thah95,2012-03-03T09:55Z,"Ok, so anyone has a tutorial or something like that for me my e-mail is 

majinvegeta95@gmail.com"
,Mr.Ruud,2012-03-03T11:43Z,"To people that have the problem with the  MIXED MEDIA DISK. you should either put the layer break on the same as the tutorial that comes with this download, or put the iso. through abgx to get a new dvd. file, cause the dvd file in this download doesn't work. (i live in PAL region and it works for me) only problem i still have that the game freezes at a certain race in the game."
,galaxybay,2012-03-03T14:18Z,"there is a default .dvd file with the download but when i select it with imgburn before burning it says
(SYSTEM CANNOT OPEN D:SSX XBOX 360-SPARESSX-SPARE.ISO
REASON:THE SYSTEM CANNOT FIND THE FILE SPECIFIED.)
lol how the F$%#  to burn this image man "

,thah95,2012-03-04T11:40Z,Do you need a modded Xbox for this to work?
,galaxybay,2012-03-04T16:31Z,hey it worked now ...1st rename the .dvd file to sp-ssx-spare and use layer break 1913760 and burn it with 2.4x speed .. you all fine now 
,Smallz94,2012-03-05T00:14Z,yes thah95
