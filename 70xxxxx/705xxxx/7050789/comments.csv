,SilenceMurderer,2012-02-22T22:31Z,"The screenshots (4) are in the torrent as well, you can download them first by giving them a high priority. 

In BitTorrent:
The Adventures of Tintin -> Files -> right click on screenshot 1-4 -> priority -> high"
,AzeXi,2012-02-22T23:06Z,"i did, but it is so slow"
,SilenceMurderer,2012-02-23T00:22Z,"In the mean time it's probably a lot faster, what otherwise might help is set the other files to ""don't download"".
