In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, including acts like The Apples in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Porno For Pyros and Super Furry Animals. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur, and Oasis who drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock, particularly on the album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants (2000) In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia and with Indian mysticism and spirituality .

Many of these bands would re-unite again in the late 1990s or early 2000s, but they never reached the commercial success they saw in the 1980s or early 1990s. Other bands such as MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e and Poison saw personnel changes which impacted those bands' commercial viability during the decade. Some established acts continued to enjoy commercial success, such as Aerosmit.

11.09. CONTEMPORARY R&B , SOUL & NEO-SOUL MUSIC

As disco and funk were dominating the charts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from soft rock and adult contemporary. Many funk bands, such as Con Funk Shun, Cameo, and Lakeside would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Teddy Pendergrass, Peabo Bryson, Atlantic Starr, and Larry Graham.

Contemporary R&B (also known as simply R&B) is a music genre that combines elements of hip hop, soul, R&B and funk. Contemporary R&B and urban pop began between 1991 to 1998. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as contemporary R&B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style.
Popular artists include Salt-n-Pepa, Groove Theory, Diana King, 3T, Brownstone, Shanice, Paula Abdul, Usher, Aaliyah, Keith Sweat, R. Kelly, TLC, Seal, Brandy, Monica, Tevin Campbell, Maxi Priest, Shaggy and Toni Braxton. 
The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994. Neo soul is a term coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop fusion and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its classicist influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.

11.11. EURODANCE AND HIP HOUSE (house rap)

Euro dance (also know as Hands Up) is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the late 1980s primarily in Europe. Original Euro dance is a fusion of several styles of dance music, primarily house and rap with the Hi-NRG variant of disco music., especially Italo-Disco Some examples of "original" Euro dance acts are Vengaboys, Alcazar, Infernal, Alexia, 2 Unlimited, Bad Boys Blue, Cappella, Captain Hollywood Project, Centory, Corona, Culture Beat, DJ Bobo, Dr. Alban, E-Type, Fun Factory, Ice MC, Imperio, Indra, La Bouche, 2 Brothers On The 4th Floor, Le Click, Maxx, Playahitty, Real McCoy, Whigfield, Darude and First Base.

Euro dance has served to popularize rap music in Europe. While rap had been made in Europe at least as far back as Falco's Einzelhaft album (1982), the American variety only gained a more widespread acceptance when Technotronic landed their hit "Pump Up the Jam", followed by Snap's "The Power". The combination of house music with rap vocals in general came to be referred to as Hip house or "house rap".

11.13. TRIP HOP & POST TRIP HOP MUSIC

Trip hop is a music genre consisting of downtempo electronic music which originated in the early 1990s in the UK, especially Bristol. Deriving from "post"-acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz. Musically, trip hop contains a slow tempo and a hypnotic sound created by an electronic background and prominent string instrumentation. Several trip hop artists and bands, such as Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead and Morcheeba have received attention and/or chart success, both on mainstream national charts and on the more dance and indie-based ones.
After the success of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky albums in 1994 and 1995, a new generation of trip hop artists emerged with a more standardized sound. Notable "post-trip-hop" artists include Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto. They integrated trip hop with other genres â€“ including ambient, R&B/soul, IDM, experimental industrial, atmospheric drum n bass/jungle, liquid dubstep, breakbeat, drum 'n' bass, acid jazz, and new age.
