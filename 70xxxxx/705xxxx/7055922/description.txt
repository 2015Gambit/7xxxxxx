    Once Upon a Time in Norway: The history of Mayhem and the rise of        
    Norwegian Black Metal is a documentary about the early black metal       
    movement in Norway. The film is a collaboration by the following         
    directors: Martin Ledang, Pl Aasdal, Olav Martinius Ilje Lien &        
    Oddbjrn Hofseth. After playing at the Bergen film festival the         
    first edition of the DVD sold out within two weeks - which is            
    encouraging as the film offers Black Metal fans something new      
    considering the subject has been hammered to death and cashed in on      
    by photographers, writers, filmmakers and other parasites.               
                                                                             
    It's about Satanist undergrounds, secret brotherhoods, friendship,       
    betrayal, arson, violent death and everything else that makes            
    Norwegian Black Metal the most infamous popcultural phenomena in the     
    world. This is a theme that interests a variety of audiences, not        
    only the typical Black Metal fan or general headbanger, but also an      
    Arthaus audience, as the theme is pretty exotic for a non-Nordic         
    audience. Audiences into subcultures and anthropology will also find     
    interest in this, as well as the general cultfilm audience.
