How do you convert DVD's into separate sections and such small size? I would love to know the thing. I have a hell lot of dvds which I would like to reduce . Thanks :)"
[T],danny_bull,2012-02-25T16:47Z,"too difficult to explain, but you'll defitely need the following software:

1. DVD Decrypter to copy dvd-files into your hard drive
2. DGDecode - to create a *.d2v file
3. Avisynth - to create an *.avs script which will be opened with VirtualDub
4. XviD - the encoder itself
5. VirtualDub - to open *.avs file and configure XviD options + to apply some plugins to the video (such as deinterlace / resize)

while configuring XviD - do not use GMC and QPel options, max consecutive B-frames mustn't be more than 1.

+ to get separate sections you should add I-frames in the 'zones' menu.

in brief, feel free to experiment and read some articles online"

Though, I've downloaded all the softwares you mentioned. I'll experiment. 
Thanks anyway. :)"
