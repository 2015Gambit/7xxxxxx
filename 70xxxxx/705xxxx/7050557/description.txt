                            ==============================






In the years leading up to and following the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West, hordes of often hungry and warlike barbarians swarmed into Roman lands from the East and North, inundating an already weak Imperial government in Rome. In many cases, these barbarian tribes were hired as mercenaries and served the Empire as hired muscle against other barbarians.  Some of the most famous of these groups, two of which went on to become extremely important in post- Imperial Europe. The Franks, under the ruthless, but powerful, King Clovis, would found a great kingdom of their own and lay the foundations for the Holy Roman Empire. 


The Saxons, surging west from Germania, would launch an invasion of Britain, claiming lands vacated by the retreating Romans, and served as the deadly enemies of the Britannic warlord who became the basis for the mythical King Arthur. The Vandals and the Lombards, though less well-known, also left their bloody mark on history as enemies of the Empire.
 

This period of history saw the collapse of civilization in the West and the emergence of a chaotic time known to history as the Dark Ages. At the same time, Christianity spread throughout Europe, largely at the hands of the Barbarians themselves who came to embrace, at least nominally, a belief in Christ.
