The Kills 
The Last Goodbye Vinyl EP

24/96 FLAC


a1. the last goodbye
a2. pale blue eyes

b1. one silver dollar
b2. crazy

A tiny bit pop-clicky but I cleaned the record as much as Im comfortable with, so if you only want mp3s maybe try somewhere else.


**This 24bit 96khz and can Not be burnt to a CD unless you downsample it to 16/44**

I cant seed too long as I only have 25GB traffic a month, so please share and share alike.
