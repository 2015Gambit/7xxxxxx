From Wiki:


Live is an American rock band from York, Pennsylvania, composed of Chad Taylor (lead guitar), Patrick Dahlheimer (bass), and Chad Gracey (drums). Lead singer and principal songwriter Ed Kowalczyk left the band in November 2009.

Live achieved worldwide success with their 1994 album, Throwing Copper, which has sold eight million copies in the US.[1] The band had a string of hit singles in the mid 1990s including "Lightning Crashes", which stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 10 consecutive weeks and the Modern Rock Tracks (now Alternative Songs) chart for nine weeks from February 25 to April 22, 1995.[2] The band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide.[3] Their last three studio albums fared only moderately well in the US, but they continued to enjoy success in The Netherlands, South Africa and Australasia.

When touring, Live have used additional musicians, most notably Ed's younger brother Adam Kowalczyk on rhythm guitar and backing vocals. British keyboard player Michael "Railo" Railton and guitarist Christopher Thorn of the band Blind Melon have also toured with Live.

On November 30, 2009 Chad Taylor revealed that what had initially been termed a "two-year hiatus" was more likely the end of the band, due to what he felt were inappropriate and possibly illegal actions by Ed Kowalczyk,[4] which have resulted in a lawsuit being filed against him by the other three band members.[5] In June 2011, Taylor revealed that he, Gracey and Dahlheimer were to reform Live without Kowalczyk,[6] who confirmed that he would not work with the other three again.

MCA got a hold of the material and pushed us to call it an album." The songs were originally going to be released free to fans as a collection called Ecstatic Fanatic.[2] V only reached number 22 on the album chart in the US and failed to attain Gold status, despite reasonably positive reviews.

Live At The Paradiso - Amsterdam 2008



Live at the Paradiso â€“ Amsterdam is Live's first live concert album and DVD.

The DVD and CD were recorded over two nights at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. Two studio recordings, "Forever" and "Purifier" are included on the album. Singer Ed Kowalczyk said of them, "Both songs kind of have this urgency about them, where we almost missed our deadlines. You can feel the urgency and the energy of the session in the songs".[1]

Despite the fact that the band were about to break up, guitarist Chad Taylor was pleased with the DVD, he wrote, "When I saw the magic that was on camera, I was overcome by emotion. We had documented the energy and efforts of a 20-year career together." The tensions between Ed Kowalczyk and the other three band members were revealed when he added, "When the album artwork showed up with Chad, Patrick and I in black and white and Ed in color it shot pain through my veins."[2]

Taylor also revealed that Kowalczyk was unhappy with his playing during the tour which included the Paradiso concerts, "For some reason on that tour Ed would complain about the tuning of my guitar each and every night in the dressing room following the show. He would call Patrick at all hours of the night asking if we sounded okay. I had long talks with the techs. I begged someone to give me anything tangible that I could work on or fix. The board tapes sounded fine but the constant complaining was driving me mad. It was sucking the life out of me on stage."
