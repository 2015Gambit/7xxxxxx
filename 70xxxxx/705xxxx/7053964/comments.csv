,Hulk.slayer,2012-02-24T05:10Z,"Thanks as usual!

OT:VLC plays mp4 formats just fine. Just right-click and open the file with VLC. 
"
,CD12,2012-02-24T05:12Z,dukeford is right. Fuck the haters.
,ludwig251,2012-02-24T05:34Z,"the audio is out of sync, i had to put it at -3250 ms in media player classic, still thanks for the up :P"

,swissfreak,2012-02-24T06:02Z,Thanks eztv.   Don't know what you guy's problem is -- mp4 works fine for me in VLC.
,Ozdl,2012-02-24T06:31Z,Thanks eztv.  Ignore the idiots who don't know mp4 from their arsehole.
,whmxtra,2012-02-24T06:35Z,"for those bitching about mp4 format, try tigerplayer, plays the files just fine, and less megs to download :)"
,mroneguy,2012-02-24T07:31Z,"What the hell?, why is there no .avi version???, this is fucked up, won't be able to use AVIAddXSub now to watch my shows on ps3 because of this stupid shit!, go back to offer both versions like you've always done ASAP!"
,ManzarZafar,2012-02-24T07:36Z,"For those who are complaining about mp4 format, just download k-lite code pack from:
www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm

Been using this package for years, and regardless of the player used, this works perfectly. Also comes in with Media Player Classic, great player."
,arildus,2012-02-24T08:15Z,Thanx:)
,Mach_One,2012-02-24T11:00Z,Works fine for me on VLC player
,PrincePwn,2012-02-24T12:57Z,"I agree KLite codec pack is the best. But if you wanna watch anything without codecs, use VLC."
,deef1ant,2012-02-24T15:13Z,awesome! lots of seeders. will seed too.. :D
,wecaz1,2012-02-24T15:29Z,"Thanks, this time x264 and 125MB only!!"
,under99l,2012-02-24T15:41Z,"Thanks for the great work guys. I'm sure everyone else is also curious about why the change, but it is still the same great quality.

Is it possible to release two versions? 1 AVI 1 MP4

I prefer the AVI, since all of them have the same size, resolution, etc. I may sound like I have OCD but I like to keep all my files uniform."
,123bou,2012-02-24T16:09Z,"I'm sorry, but I don't get the appeal of the Mp4. Is it the extra 50mbs you're saving? Because that's really not enough to make me switch. I am aware of VLC and what it can do. However, what you are suggesting is like telling someone who went to the theatre to watch a movie that they have to watch it on their phone. I don't pay for cable, I download. I have a crappy old laptop, and a nice 40 inch tv. What would you rather watch your shows on? Until my Xbox plays Mp4's, neither will I."
,karamia,2012-02-24T19:24Z,"please is it possible you could get the film ""simply irresistible"" asked a few ppl now and no one can seem to get it.. would be so grateful"
,ledorius,2012-02-24T19:54Z,Gracias
,Selz1977,2012-02-24T22:30Z,Just want to say thanks for always uploading great quality shows.  I do prefer AVI files as I always transfer to flash drive to watch on my TV but it doesn't recognise MP4's.
,xIKIoIZIx,2012-02-25T01:17Z,"@123bou & the ""I prefer.avi crowd""

First of all, neither .avi nor .mp4 are file-formats. They're Video-Containers that can include a whole pandemonium of codecs/filetypes (DivX, mpeg2, mpeg4 and many more). 
Thus it can help (in some cases) to just rename a .mp4 (if your device eg TV doesnt know what to do with an .mp4) to .avi to make it playable.

Second -123bou you say that you only have a crappy laptop. Even if its really crappy and 10 years old it should be no problem to hook it up to your TV via VGA or S-Video and run VLC on it.
Otherwise a used PC with onboard HD-Graphics, HDMI and 7.1 Sound can be purchased
for a lousy 75$ these days. Add a 20$ wireless Keyboard/Mouse to that and you have a full Media rig hooked up to your TV.

Third, the h.264 codec (or in this case the x.264 container) is the future, for it alows much higher bitrates and higher quality pictures at th same filesize of an .avi, it supports HD-Profiles and supports multicore processor use. Plus the x264 is under Gnu Public license, which makes it free to use.
AVI was implemented in fucking 1992, in fucking Windows 3.1 people,
your bitching about your devices not playing it is the equivalent of somebody bitching that his VHS is not playing BLuRay. "
,xIKIoIZIx,2012-02-25T01:19Z,"by ""it"" I of course refer to x.264."
,xIKIoIZIx,2012-02-25T01:24Z,"Oh, and I almost forgot:

Thanks eztv! You're the best!"
,BarbozaTC,2012-02-25T02:12Z,"Thanks a bunch eztv!!

BTW, the audio is outta sync... Fixed it by adjusting it to -3250ms. Thnx for the tip ludwig251"

,wecaz1,2012-02-29T17:57Z,"Downloaded it but deleted due to AV sync issue. I can adjust it using the player each time I play, but I preferred to spend 50MB bigger file than this hassle. Hence I downloaded 175MB version as usual."
