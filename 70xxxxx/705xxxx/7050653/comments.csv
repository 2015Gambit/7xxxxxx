,pfslow,2012-05-24T06:46Z,"Does not have the Garritan instruments but, if you have them from a previous version, they will work.

You cannot upgrade this to the current version. I can live with that.

I don't find the 2012 features worth the upgrade from 2011. This download allowed me to figure that out - thanks. There are rumors that there won't be a 2013 version - oh well... I'll wait till 2014 to spend more money on Finale."
,pfslow,2012-05-24T06:47Z,It freaked me out for a second asking for my iLok key to be inserted. It was actually making calls to some of my plugins so that was ok.
,pfslow,2012-05-30T12:53Z,"If you have previous versions of Finale installed, avoid this turkey. Yes, it works but has major problems. It corrupted many of my old files. 

I had to restore my system with Time Machine to before I downloaded to fix the problems. Fortunately, with Lion, that is very easy. I am glad it's gone from my system."
,danymein,2012-08-04T23:56Z,Does it works on Lion?
,cubos,2012-09-02T04:01Z,"if I have a Garritan instruments folder for finale 2009, is it compatible with this version of finale? and if it is, what should the location of the folder be?"
