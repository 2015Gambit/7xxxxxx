third world multicultural ideas on stocks of European descent both here
in north America and in Europe as of late - Despite the fact of it being
a dubious posthumous achievement of sorts - as it were.

What did he sound like in private and in public exchanges?
Not a genius i suggest as his ideas speak for themselves in the main.
He likes wearing a turban at one point and looks like a nomadic
oil sheikh in another clip. This wasnt his home in Canada as it existed.


We'll post the French version soon, here are 4 episodes of the English
version with only one 50 minute episode (the final episode) also waiting to post
for you.
