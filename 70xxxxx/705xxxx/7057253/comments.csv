,jmbsc,2012-02-25T19:32Z,"sorry mate... another question - some games (like this one) downloaded recently are giving me problems... i play them with VLC but they don't play very well... it's impossible to watch them actually... the video doesn't hold it together and after a while, I stop it as it gives me a headache... :-("
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-25T22:35Z,I use k-lite codecs and BS player. It work perfect.

[V],Nepotu,2012-02-25T23:30Z,Could be a graphic card fault. I don't know. But VLC player open almost every video format and use fewer resources.
