,LotsOfWaffles,2012-03-02T01:24Z,"THe video quality is amazing as is the sound (mostly) 
10v/8a
I give the sound a lower rating because it seemed you could hear the non english sound at some parts as well as the english but DEFINATLY download this its an awesome download perfect video nearly perfect audio"
,Diabolus_X,2012-03-03T05:14Z,A8/V10 GREAT copy probably the best you will get on the net right now. Great work
,Diabolus_X,2012-03-03T05:30Z,Let me rephrase the Audio issue...the sound effects like gunfire and explosions are perfect....but the voices are muffled and hard to hear. There are subtitles though
,george047,2012-03-08T12:14Z,cant hear the audio
,19KeNnY86,2012-03-08T14:05Z,good copy cheers
,7201080,2012-03-10T16:33Z,"V9  - video stream is 500mb pretty good 720p but movie is only 75mins ?
A6  - Audio stream is 50mb (This should be fine with AAC at 64kb ) 
M6 - no spoiler 

Audio Downmix is crap the center channel is mixed into the right speaker , and the rears are sort of mixed as random echoes through the main mix the right channel is 25-30 % louder and unfixable.  
there is noise ( mid 2 mid high frequency ) through the sound throughout the whole movie , not noticable in the action scenes 

It is watchable . to a degree , audio get anoyining .

Wtf , why do people upload video they obviously haven't checked flick through it and put in the notes

everyone is so contempt on trying to get the smallest files ,"
