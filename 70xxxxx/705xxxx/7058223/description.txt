Music, official name Carole King: Music, is the third album by American singer-songwriter Carole King. 
It is a continuation of the style laid down in Tapestry. The album was released in December 1971 and 
quickly rose to the top of the charts. It features songs such as "It's Going to Take Some Time" 
(US #12 by The Carpenters) "Sweet Seasons," a #9 hit for Carole King, and "Brother, Brother".

Carole King: Music experienced immediate success and was certified gold on December 9, 1971, days after
release. It was certified platinum on July 17, 1995.

Music entered the top ten at #8, becoming the first of many weeks both Tapestry and Carole King: Music 
would occupy the top ten simultaneously. The album hit #1 on New Year's Day 1972 and stayed there for 
three consecutive weeks.

This time Carole King plays the piano and celeste on many tracks.

Carole King (born February 9, 1942) is an American singer, songwriter, and pianist. King and her former 
husband Gerry Goffin wrote more than two dozen chart hits for numerous artists during the 1960s, many of 
which have become standards. As a singer, her Tapestry album topped the U.S. album chart for 15 weeks in 
1971, and remained on the charts for more than six years.

She was most successful as a performer in the first half of the 1970s, although she was a successful 
songwriter long before and long after. She had her first No. 1 hit as a songwriter in 1961 at age 18, with 
Will You Love Me Tomorrow, which she wrote with Gerry Goffin. In 1997, she co-wrote The Reason for 
Aerosmith, but instead it was sung by Celine Dion.
