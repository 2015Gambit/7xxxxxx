Stop this foolishness...."
,torgdough,2012-02-25T09:58Z,"The short answer: This is a scene release.

The long answer: Scene releases aren't compressed, but merely split using winrar. It's against the scene rules to compress it I believe. Second, while there might not be much point in splitting releases when using bittorrent technology, while using more traditional P2P networks there is. Today DC++ actually can download a single file from multiple peers, but it didn't used to. So the greatest reason for it being split up is so you can download from many users at the same time and don't have to restart it all if something goes wrong, like a file getting corrupted or something. Another reason is that it obfuscates the contents somewhat. One thing you should know is that scene rules don't change very often and this would be a very fundamental change. Besides, if you are not using a player (hardware or software) that can play directly from RAR archives, you are using a poor player.

Cue ""cool story bro"" comment. :)"
