1. Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bopup IM Client Software Development Kit (SDK) is a toolkit for Windows 
platform that provides documentation, samples and COM components for 
building powerful instant messaging functionality into existing 
applications, creating and developing a chat messenger software based 
a client/server architecture. Applications built on this SDK interact 
and communicate with Bopup Communication Server (IM server software) 
that must be installed as a server-side part of the instant messaging 
system. 

Bopup IM Client SDK provides functions for connecting and establishing 
IM session with the communication server, sending/receiving personal 
and group instant messages, receiving urgent and high-priority tasks 
from the server, managing user's contacts, receiving presence status 
updates within the Contact List. This SDK supports various 
authentication methods to autorize users on the IM server: Simple, 
Windows Authentication (SSPI) and using Private login and password 
credentials entered by a end-user. 

Provided functionality and supported features:

* Secure and Private Communication
All transmitted messages are encrypted with strong encryption algorithms 
based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 algorithms. That 
is the first and primary way to make corporate and business IM safe and 
secure. 

* Authentication Modes 
Various modes to authenticate and authorize users with the IM server are 
supported. Choose the best way for your corporate and business 
infrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows 
Authentication (SSPI) and Private login/password. 

* Messaging Groups 
The centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize 
a flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and send / 
receive-only permissions set for each user. 

* User Presence Status 
See the current status of each user in your Contact List, i.e. Online, 
Away, Offline (Not available). Manage your own status. 

* Contact List access 
Organize your personal Contact List and access it from any workplace and 
location. 

* Offline and Urgent Messaging 
Deliver important information to users even if they are currently 
unavailable and receive such messages. Offline messages are stored on 
the IM server and automatically delivered to the recipient when he goes 
online. 

* Centralized Notification 
Receive notifications and urgent messages from the IM server and stay 
updated on any events and information. These messages are automatically 
sent by the server on the scheduled time and at the specified intervals. 

* Message Logging & Archiving 
Browse, search and view the entire message archives on the IM server. 
Print information for any period and for any person. 



2. System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bopup IM Client SDK requires the following minimum system configuration: 

- 533 MHz processor (or higher recommended) 
- 64 MB RAM 
- 3 MB free disk space 
- Microsoft Windows 98/ME/NT 4.0/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7
- A C/C++ compiler (Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or later) to build samples
- Network configured for TCP/IP protocol 
- Internet connection (*)

(*) - Internet connection is optional if the IM server running outside 
a local area network (LAN).



3. Installation and Using
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install Bopup IM Client SDK: 

- Launch bopupsdk.exe or bopupsdk.msi setup file (*). 
- Follow all instructions in the Setup Wizard. 
- After installation you can launch this help file's shortcut from 
"Start Menu -> Programs -> Bopup IM Client SDK" folder. 

(*) - The filename may have a different name depending on custom 
installation package or supported platform. 


Bopup IM Client SDK contents:

Installation folder of the SDK contains the following folders under the 
root folder: 

"\" - At the root level, the license agreement (license.txt), 
information file (readme.txt), contact information (contacts.txt) and 
this help documentation file (BopupSDK.chm). 

"\com" - Includes COM components and manifest files to build client 
applications. Files from this folder must be also redistributed with 
applications that use the SDK. 

"\include" - Includes C++ header files that contain interface and 
structure definitions. Must be included into client application's source 
code of Bopup IM Client SDK. 

"\samples" - Sample and tutorial C++ source code and Microsoft Visual 
C++ 6.0 build projects. 


Redistributable components:

Bopup IM Client SDK includes COM redistributable and manifest files that 
are required to run applications built using this SDK. The COM 
components and manifest files are located in the \com folder and must be 
distributed and registered with the client application software on 
a target computer. The components include: 

"CSClient.dll" - A core module which implements the IServerClient 
interface that is used to communicate with the IM server. 

"SecPrvdr.dll" - An encryption module that is used by the IServerClient 
interface for generating encryption session key with the IM server and 
for encoding/decoding instant messages. This component is used by the 
IServerClient interface internally. 

"CSClient.X.manifest" - A manifest file for CSClient.dll module which 
adds a support for deployment of this COM component to a machine without 
the need to register it. 

"SecPrvdr.X.manifest" - A manifest file for SecPrvdr.dll module which 
adds a support for deployment of this COM component to a machine without 
the need to register it. 


Registration of the COM components can be done via stardard COM 
registration with the help of built-in regsvr32.exe Windows tool. Here 
is a sample of registration of the CSClient.dll and SecPrvdr.dll modules 
from a command line: 

"regsvr32 csclient.dll" 
"regsvr32 secprvdr.dll"
 
For more information on the regsvr32 registration tool run it with the 
/? command line parameter. 


The COM components can be used without registration by enabling the 
Registration-Free COM model. In that way the CSClient.X.manifest and 
SecPrvdr.X.manifest files must be also distributed with the client 
application. These files should be copied into the same directory that 
contains the application's executable and both CSClient.dll and 
SecPrvdr.dll components. Please note that it is required to create 
a manifest file for application's executable too and the 
Registration-Free COM mechanism is available in Windows XP/2003 and 
later versions of Windows. 

For more information on Registration-Free COM model please refer 
documentation available on Microsoft's website at Registration-Free
