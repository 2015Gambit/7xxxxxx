The video quality is 10/10 from what i've watched.
I downloaded this thinking it was dubbed in JAP and had ENG and ITA subs included, but really, it's dubbed in ITA and it doesn't come in a folder with JAP and ENG subs included, so there won't be any subs if you use KMV Player..
It's great for gifs and screencaps, but if you're downloading it to watch, I wouldn't recommend it unless you speak Italian b/c their dubbed voices are just annoying imo"
