,Yamaha145,2012-02-26T16:08Z,Many thanks from Canada!
,CBMRACING,2012-02-26T17:06Z,Thanks again Slcik. Hey to the guys with the slow download are you using the most up to date bit torrent. I updated mine to the most up to date one and my download speed dropped huge so I went back to 7.0 and having no problems now. The new version I could barley get 100kb no matter how many se or le. If you go to the site   old version dot com you can get any version of bit torrent you want. try it. hope it helps. Slck thanks again!!! Hey why do you post them twice. I know the difference but why dont you just upload the 720 from the get go?
,krÃƒÂ¶ger,2012-02-26T17:09Z,"@BarnZiipeers:   You have to understand that there is only one person that is seeding this. And that is slicknick610. He is the only one that have 100%.

And he dosent have so fast internet, take really long time for him to seed,share 2.3GB so that a other person also gets 100%. I think it takes him about 4 hours to seed,upload 2 GB.

And there is alot leechers and only one seeder on a crap connection so you can do the math!!

You can have a look at my stats, And dont say that people not are seeding,
Download 1.39GB = 60%
Upload 55 GB 

Thats give a ratio of 38.7"
,Blueoctober712,2012-02-26T17:11Z,"I am soooo bummed. Villapoto crashed in this race and broke his collar bone. Looks like hes out for the season. Stewart wins, Weimer second. Poor Dungey all the way back in 6th. "
,Blueoctober712,2012-02-26T17:23Z,Im so bummed. Villapoto crashes and is out for the season. Stupid stewart wins and poor Dungey finishes all the way back in 8th. This sucks

,ilikethai,2012-02-26T21:22Z,"Awesome job, I hope you can cover other motorcycle racing or share links to the torrents if you know them: WSBK, motogp

,KTM540SMPRO,2012-02-26T21:27Z,"Thanks for that Blueoctober712, now I don't need to watch it:(

,cervus72,2012-02-26T22:43Z,"F@@kind ISP.. throttling my bandwidth back to nothing.. 2.5 kB's! says a week and a half to complete it BS, should of watched this already.
 I dont know how they can tell when i trying to download torrents but they do, speed is fine doing everything esle but torrents. Anyone know how i can get round them knowing?"
,powerport1,2012-02-26T22:59Z,"hey BLUE OCTOBER
HOW BOUT YOU KEEP YOUR FAT FLAPPING LIPS / FINGERS SHUT?
I WOULD BREAK MY DICK OFF IN YOUR ASS FOR THAT IF I KNEW YOU"
,Pirate_Monster,2012-02-27T01:28Z,"Awesome work as always Nick. Your effort is hugely appreciated around the world.

Pity some of you leechers don't seed some more. 
Like BarnZii said, I too can get over 1000kb/s download time but not with Slick's SX races because you leechers wone effin seed!

And take no notice of Blueoctober, he's just pissing in the wind"
,ninjakecil,2012-02-27T02:50Z,"@Blueoctober
I knew your IP address, I can trace you and I'd kill you if you're in my country. Fortunately, you're not.
Anybody wants to kill that motherfuckers?

@Slicknick610
Many thanks man. You're awesome.

@CMBRACING
Slicknick already said that for speed live coverage, it's only 480p (maybe speed only broadcast it in 480p? idk), so the 720p version were the re-run of the live coverage."
,Blueoctober712,2012-02-27T04:49Z,"Hey big tough guy, What Country do I live in then? You lying fag. You cant track crap from someones name on a blog. Idiot"
,micklemack,2012-02-27T05:47Z,Blue October - Perhaps just your accident but please show respect for everyone else who comes here to download it. I am sure you wouldn't appreciate it if the same was done to you.
,slicknick610,2012-02-27T05:53Z,"Everyone calm down Blueoctober is lying about the results anyway.

I will be posting the 720p version shortly. I post the 480p version first because it is quicker to render and upload."
