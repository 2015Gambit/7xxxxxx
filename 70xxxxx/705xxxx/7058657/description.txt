Zaia was a Cirque du Soleil stage production based at The Venetian Macao on the Cotai Strip in Macau. The 90-minute show opened in August 2008 and brings together 75 high-calibre artists from around the world. Zaia was Cirque du Soleil\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s first resident show in Asia[1] and is directed by Neilson Vignola and Gilles Maheu. The theater housing the performance can seat 1,800 spectators during a single show.[2]
Zaia presents a young girl\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s perception of the stars and planets, space and infinity, all populated by a panoply of fantastic, out-of-this-world creatures. The title, Zaia, comes from a Greek name meaning \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"life\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and is also reminiscent of Gaia, the living, self-aware spirit of Earth.[1]


Due to multiple factors, including very low audience turnouts, the show closed on February 19, 2012. 


Despite its closing, they cite that in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Using Las Vegas as a benchmark, Zaiaâ€™s 3 1/2-year run should be deemed successful and provide strong support for the argument that the future of entertainment in Macau is on the right track.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[3]

Zaia opened in 2008 and had a rough start due to low audience numbers. But \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ticket sales have gone up\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with the addition of new Chinese-style elements such as a lion dance performance and a flying dragon. Despite higher box office sales, the show was still recording losses in 2011, Sands China president Edward Tracy revealed on 18 November 2011. The Venetian Macau show remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the only business sector that doesnâ€™t make a profit,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he added. Criticism from Sands China chairman Sheldon Adelson led to rumours that the 10-year contract of Zaia would be terminated earlier. But Edward Tracy rejected this possibility. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"We are prepared to take a loss to provide that kind of entertainment,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" he stressed.[4]
