As disco and funk were dominating the charts in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from soft rock and adult contemporary. Many funk bands, such as Con Funk Shun, Cameo, and Lakeside would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Teddy Pendergrass, Peabo Bryson, Atlantic Starr, and Larry Graham.

Contemporary R&B (also known as simply R&B) is a music genre that combines elements of hip hop, soul, R&B and funk. Contemporary R&B and urban pop began between 1991 to 1998. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as contemporary R&B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style.
Popular artists include Salt-n-Pepa, Groove Theory, Diana King, 3T, Brownstone, Shanice, Paula Abdul, Usher, Aaliyah, Keith Sweat, R. Kelly, TLC, Seal, Brandy, Monica, Tevin Campbell, Maxi Priest, Shaggy and Toni Braxton. 
The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994. Neo soul is a term coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from soul and contemporary R&B. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from jazz, funk, and hip hop to pop fusion and African music. It has been noted by music writers for its classicist influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.
