Oni is a third-person action game developed by Bungie West, a division of Bungie. Released in 2001, it was Bungie West\\\'s only game. It broke new ground by blending third-person shooting with hand-to-hand combat, resulting in a unique, yet familiar game for third-person shooter enthusiasts. In 1999, while still in development, Oni won the Game Critics Awards for Best Action/Adventure Game.

The game\\\'s universe is heavily influenced by Mamoru Oshii\\\'s anime film Ghost in the Shell.[2] The main characters Konoko and Commander Griffin look similar to the film\\\'s protagonists Motoko Kusanagi and Daisuke Aramaki. Dark Horse Comics published a comic-book version of Oni as a four-issue limited series, the first issue of which was bundled with the Windows version of the game.
