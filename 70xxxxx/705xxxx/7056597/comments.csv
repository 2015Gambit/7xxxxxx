,KOTYAR0,2012-03-02T17:28Z,"damn, *persist.dat, file named ""persist.dat""!"
,KOTYAR0,2012-03-02T18:55Z,"Also, if you are encountering awful bugs in this game (like ""F*** Y**, your damn game dont starting"") or want to improve graphics tp 1920x1080 (of course, you do) you should install C-Daodan DLL from this link
http://wiki.oni2.net/Daodan_DLL
Yeah, this is repalcement of ""binkw32.dll"". It also adds many upgrades in the game for skilled players ^:3 
Have fun!)))"
