,neil_diamond ,2012-02-25T02:32Z,Are you going to start seeding any of these anytime soon?
,Neon_Vincent,2012-02-25T13:03Z,"To you, no.  To the other fifty people lined up, yes.   
Then maybe some of them will seed it for you. Fair enough?"
,Neon_Vincent,2012-02-25T13:12Z,"neil_diamond - You posted your whine 35 minutes after I started the this torrent.

Your own uploaded torrent count is zero.

I don't mind a leech unless the leech has no manners, ya stinkin' ingrate."
,neil_diamond ,2012-02-25T19:49Z,"When you listed this torrent, it was your 7th in a row and 2 hours into your starting to post them, and nothing had started. This was a re-up of a torrent you had posted in the beginning.

Usually the mods are starting to take them down by then as fakes.

- fakes.

Don't tell me what the mods ""usually"" do.  Your own share list is a zero.  The mods have a little thing called ""patience"" in addition to manners.  They understand that it sometimes takes time and besides, a glance at my past record shows them I'm not a faker.  You could learn a lot from them.

You did without this collection for all eleven years of your whole life, then couldn't stand to wait a couple more hours before you got itchy and mouthed off to someone who spent hours bringing YOU hundreds of hours of other peoples' work.  You're a loud mouthed smartass ingrate leech.

If you don't like the way I run my torrents, down't download them.

Try starting one of your own sometime."
