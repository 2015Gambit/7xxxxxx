 The world of digital SLR photography has changed incredibly in the six years since I wrote the first version of this book in 2005. So, this Third Edition for 2011 is virtually a ground-up overhaul, with six new chapters and a stem-to-stern refreshing of every other topic I covered the last time around. There are now full chapters on Travel shooting, People/Portrait Photography (with lighting diagrams), Photographing Concerts and Performances, Scenic, Wildlife, and Nature Photography, Action Photography, and Macro work.
