,Potato23,2012-03-01T00:23Z,Why do you guys still upload every thing in .rar files?? Everyone else can take the whole extra minute to extract before uploading. Alot of times ill even wait for someone else to upload the same show you guys will have up 5minutes sooner just because they upload the actual video file. Maybe you should try that.
