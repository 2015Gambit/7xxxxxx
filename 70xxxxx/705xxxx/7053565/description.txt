Description: When the mission must not fail, the National Command Authority calls in the
Tier 1 Operators. And we\\\'re not talking about those guys who sell candles
and wicker chairs. We\\\'re talking \\\" Tier\\\" 1 with a \\\" T.\\\" They are the best of
the best the elite-est of the elite. To give you an idea of just how elite
they are, more than 2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines serve
in our armed forces. Out of those 2 million, about 50,000 fall under the
direct control of Special Operations Command. Although their exact numbers
are classified, only a few hundred out of those 50,000 make the cut as a
Tier 1 Operator. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war.
They are experts in the application of violence. And out of those few
hundred, only one, namely you, will step into the boots of one of these
elite warriors in the hostile, unforgiving battlefield conditions in
present-day Afghanistan. Do you think you have what it takes to confront
a new enemy who improvises mercilessly in a new kind of war? Do you think
you have what it takes to be Tier 1? We dare you.
