,dt7ll5op,2012-02-24T10:10Z,"wow, is this like a rip to fit on a dvd5?"
,jmohawk,2012-02-24T12:19Z,@dt7ll5op An undub is where you replace the English audio with the original Japanese track. That way you can still understand the text while enjoying the original voice acting. That being said you can use wii scrubber to shrink the game so it will fit on a dvd-5.
,dt7ll5op,2012-02-24T19:46Z,"yeah, i know: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undub
but is it like that? i mean will this fit because of that?"
,jmohawk,2012-02-24T20:36Z,"No, if you convert this to an iso it will still be 8.3gb's. You can however make it fit on a single dvd by downloading wii scrubber below and selecting 'trim'.

Still it's probably easier just to load it on a USB device. "
,dt7ll5op,2012-02-25T10:43Z,"i dont have softmod, i've got wasabi dx, so i need a valid dvd5 image.

dvd9 did not work for me neither for ssbb, nor metroid other m, nor sakura wars, nor xenoblade - i've tried them all, even tested distinct releases, it was expensive.

only ssbb has a working dvd5 rip :("
,jmohawk,2012-02-25T20:37Z,Here are the steps to convert to dvd-5 http://gbatemp.net/topic/321437-wii-2860-the-last-story-europe/page__view__findpost__p__4117726
,charly_corr,2012-02-27T02:16Z,"Thanks. The undub is great, voice and music are sync. But, when i am in the city in some places give me this error: Black screen with message ""Error Reading Disc, turn off the console and consult manual"" or something like that. I play via USB with Configurable USB Loader with cios d2x8 beta 3. Anybody has this problem?"
,jwickwick,2012-02-28T04:35Z,"""If you are using an NTSC Wii you may need to select \""Force NTSC\"" in the   video settings of the backup loader you are using.""

Doing this stopped MOST of my ""eject disc"" errors."
,I-Fatman,2012-03-09T17:18Z,"Oohhhhh thanks!

This is gonna be enjoyfull. I was hoping for a undub version with english texting. Thank you so much. Will seed when I can. "
,icatfish,2012-03-17T04:49Z,Download is a bit slow... Can Someone Please seed? I would appreciate it!! Please and Thank You!  
,oshua,2012-04-06T07:10Z,"have to force region setting to pal60 mhz the screen looks blurred but on pal 50 everything is more sharper better .had to go into my settings and change it to 720p or 1080p,  ... "
,thehitman71,2012-04-15T19:35Z,"Hey I got a problem here :o I downloaded it and tested it out on my wii emulator it worked fine but one thing is missing.. the graphics on the characters. their bodies are a black and only the head is visible. But is it because of the wii emulator or just that the file is wrong? 

and one more question, can I put it on a DVD-r cd when it is scrubbed (to 4,15gb) or must it be a DVD-5 or DVD-dl?

already thanks for answering the questions!? ^^"
,angelicfeces,2012-06-29T04:34Z,"Heyo! Wii gaming needs more undubs.
Downloading now. May post results later."
,omegaviper,2012-07-17T03:49Z,"so basically un-dubs are for retards.  ""hey it's in english lets put it back to jibberish"" ""now that's a gud idea"""
,gamester2,2012-07-18T02:06Z,"this bs does not convert to 4.37, thats just a lie"
,gamester2,2012-07-19T23:33Z,"can anyone please size this to dvd-5 and post it, these steps are ridiculous and even some of us that are savvy with games arent getting a dvd-5 in the end"
,gamester2,2012-07-19T23:38Z,anyone have an english dvd5? pleassssssse
,gamester2,2012-07-20T11:13Z,the file extracts to 4.39 is that a joke?
,gamester2,2012-07-20T20:15Z,"so i followed all the steps and i got a 4.37 iso as promised though the first step gives you a 7.92 iso not 7.91, i'll report back, not sure how to make a torrent but i will try to get you all a fully undubbed 4.37 iso ASAP"
,gamester2,2012-07-21T07:25Z,"very baddddddd, works but with tons of issues on a dvd5"
,Hobo1027,2012-08-13T05:49Z,@charly_corr I used to have this problem too but I switched to USB Loader GX and it runs perfectly now.
