The only negative is that iTunes
doesn\'t have a tag field for TV Show.
So you\'ll have to highlight all of
them in the Movies section of your
Library, right click them (or Ctrl Click
if your on a Mac), click \"Get Info,\"
then click on the options tab, after
that you should see a drop down
menu next to \"Media Kind:\" that
says \"Movie\" in it. Drop click on
that menu and select \"TV Show.\"
After you click \"OK,\" iTunes will
sort them together by season in
the \"TV Shows\" section of your
Library.
