,lattari,2012-03-26T13:22Z,"Thank you!. Excellent torrent, I wish I had seen this earlier. Its still good for the fifth season episodes though don't have to fish them one buy one."
,lattari,2012-03-26T13:32Z,How come this doesn't show in a search 'the big bang theory season' even though the uploader has included the word in tags? 
,lattari,2012-04-01T21:03Z,I wish you could edit your comments. Note that there are not subtitles in this torrent like the description claims

,Chrille225,2012-05-08T23:16Z,"I let it download during the night, and after that i saw i've uploaded 36 gb, and only downloaded 9 gb. I turned off the upload til I get more download.

Oh, by the way, why do uploaders write ""Texted languages: English"" when there are no subtitles? Why do you have to make it harder for us hearing impaired, DAMN YOU. Gonna throw this away if it doesn't exist good subs for this, you schmuck"
