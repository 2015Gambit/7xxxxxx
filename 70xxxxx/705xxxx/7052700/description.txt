Michelangelo Antonioniâ€™s Identification of a Woman is a body- and soul-baring voyage into one manâ€™s artistic and erotic consciousness. After his wife leaves him, a film director finds himself drawn into affairs with two enigmatic women: at the same time, he searches for the right subject and actress for his next film. This spellbinding antiromance was a late-career coup for the legendary Italian filmmaker, and is renowned for its sexual explicitness and an extended scene on a fog-enshrouded highway that stands with the directorâ€™s greatest set pieces (-Criterion)
