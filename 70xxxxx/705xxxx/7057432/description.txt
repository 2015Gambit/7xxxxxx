Plot

Neil Shaw is an operative for the United Nations' covert dirty-tricks squad, 
using espionage and quasi-ethical tactics to secure peace and cooperation.
 When a shipping container full of dead Vietnamese refugees turns up on the docks
 and China's ambassador is gunned down at a dinner celebrating a new trade agreement 
between China and the U.S., Shaw is framed for the murder and must evade the 
FBI and Triad gangsters to find out what is really going on
