This is the latest version of the DRM removal tool by Brahms. This version works with OS X 10.7 and iTunes 10.5.3 It is also the first version of Requiem that can remove the DRM from iBooks. I haven\'t tested personally (yet!) but I trust Brahms when he says it works. This torrent contains the Mac version, the Windows version, and the source code. (Brahms open sourced it) Enjoy!

info from the readme file:
===
Requiem has a Tor website: http://tag3ulp55xczs3pn.onion.  To reach
the site using Tor, you will need to install Tor If you\'re willing to sacrifice your
anonymity, you can use the regular web with tor2web.  Just go to 
http://tag3ulp55xczs3pn.tor2web.com.
