This is the complete 1968-1973 Planet of the Apes Series of movies
(the 2001 and later additions to the series being decidedly of different
appeal I submit). Until the 2001 and any later additions, the series had 
for decades consisted of a full series as follows:

1968 - The Planet of the Apes
1970 - Beneath the Planet of the Apes
1971 - Escape from the Planet of the Apes
1972 - Conquest of the Planet of the Apes
1973 - Battle for the Planet of the Apes

This is a most important movie for mankind to come to terms with as
it does say a lot of what mode of existence many are in on the earth


enjoy the show!
