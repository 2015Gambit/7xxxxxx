In Scotsholm lives an energetic little girl named Arche Plumfield. Arche, having moved to a new home in the town of Tonkiness, ended up attending the only school in the area. It is the school for children aspiring to be magic users: the Minasa-Ratis Magic School.
Fortune Summoners is a story about being young. It's a story about finding adventure, about doing good even when doing good is hard. It's a story about owning up to your mistakes and making them right, and facing down danger no matter what. Furthermore, it's a video game.
Gameplay in Fortune Summoners consists of side-scrolling action, with you in control of one of three party members and the computer controlling the other two (with highly customizable AI dictating their actions). You will explore towns, delve dungeons, climb towers and, just maybe, find Arche a snack or two.
Combat is different depending on who you control - Arche, being a swords-girl, controls in a fashion similar to a character from a brawler or fighting game, with many special moves tied to button combos. Sana and Stella, her companions, rely more on their varied selection of spells to see them through a fight - spells that rain ice down on enemies, make mirror images of friends, or set the ground ablaze!
Their magic comes from elemental stones: stones imbued with the power of an Elemental Spirit, which grant the wielder of one the ability to control that element via "magic". In the country of Scotsholm, three centuries have passed since they were first created. Elemental stones are now mass-produced and widely used, making magic a personal, commonplace part of people's lives.
