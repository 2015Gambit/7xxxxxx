1)  The Tenerife Air Disaster 
The Tenerife Air Disaster - Most Deadly, Discovery Channel 43 Mins

On March 27th, 1977 in the beautiful Canary Istands of Spain, the worse disaster in aviation history to date took place. In an attempt to take off in a thick fog, a 747 collides with another on the runway in Tenerife. The fiery explosion kills 583 people leaving just 70 survivors.

By using forensic re-creations and transcripts of the recorded cockpit and control tower conversation, this programme investigates exactly what went wrong. We interview the ony surviving pilot Captain Robert Bragg, and two of the stewardesses working on one of the planes that day as they take us though the events and their experiences. We hear from numerous experts, authors and pilots as we try to unravel the events leading up to the incredible disaster.

This type of collision is referred to as a runway incursion and, shockingly, we Iearn that we are far from protected from another Tenerife taking place again.

3)  TWA Flight 800 
TWA Flight 800 - Best Evidence, Discovery Channel 43 Mins

In 1996, TWA flight 800 exploded shortly after take-off from New York's JFK Airport instantly killing all 230 peopIe on board. The scale of the disaster was enormous and wreckage was scattered all over the ocean. The families left behind needed to know exactly what had happened.

There were three possibilities; mechanical failure, a bomb inside the hold or a missile from the outside. It became obvious that the explosion occurred inside the centre fuel tank, but what nobody knew, was the cause.

After 12 months of the largest and most expensive airplane investigation to date, the FBI & NTSB revealed their verdict on the crash. They believed the fuel in the central tank had vapourised while the pane waited on the hot tarmac. A sprk then ignited the vapours causing an enormous explosion.

However, there is much speculation about the government's spark theory. Over 150 eyewitnesses claim they saw a rocket or missie strike the plane. Radar evidence and traces of plastic exposives found in the wreckage further added to the speculation.

This programme speaks to all those involved in solving the mystery as weII as key eyewitnesses and aviation experts in order to understand exactly what happened on that fateful day.

On 11th September 2001, the world watched in horror as two hijacked American Airlines planes were flown into The Twin Towers, devastating the lives of thousands. But what exactly happened in those 60 minutes leading up to the moment when the first plane hit the World Trade Centre?

Last Hour of Flight 11 uses a real-time split-screen format to examine that fateful hour. Experience the pulse-pounding countdown from the moment that the passengers boarded Fiight 11 to the split second before the plane hit the Twin Tower.

Within these cases were videos of pilots' tours, a hand-held flight computer, a Koran and five sheets of Arabic script detailing Atta's plan of action for that day.

This programme uses Atta's chilling prescription for death in voice over as the minutes unfold from the perspectives of various key people invoived; the terrorists on the aircraft; the hostesses making their telephone calls to the ground and ground control at Logan airport.

Alive : The 1972 Andes Survivors - Minute By Minute, The History Channel 45 Mins

Thirty five years ago, in October 1972, a chartered plane carrying members of a Uruguayan rugby team, along with friends and family, crashed into a remote section of the Argentinean Andes. Thirteen people were instantly killed but there were 32 survivors left 14,000 feet up in the harsh, forbidding snow-swept Andes.

After two weeks, the search for the missing plane was called off and the remaining survivors soon dwindled to a mere sixteen. In order to survive their ordeal, they had no choice but to eat some of their deceased companions. Left with no other option, two survivors, Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa, left the crash site and trekked for 9 days over the Andes in order to save the rest.

Featuring interviews with the survivors we chronicle their incredible tale and provide a first-hand account of their seventy one days spent in the middle of the Andes Mountains.
