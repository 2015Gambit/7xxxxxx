,johnthegreat,2012-02-27T06:08Z,Why you always split the movie in Disc 1 and Disc 2?! Why not rip in 1 single video file?!
,Powerslave0,2012-02-27T07:18Z,"Why you always split the movie in Disc 1 and Disc 2?! Why not rip in 1 single video file?! 

Yeah, that...  It's stupid, especially when you, and other popular uploaders are tracked by AP2P agencies...

SO, yeah, WHY two stupid CDs?"
,bossyboots321,2012-02-27T12:59Z,johnthegreat&powerslave. Why dont you just put it onto 1 disc yourself. 
,JD_GSDB,2012-02-27T21:43Z,I use limewire to download torrents.
,JD_GSDB,2012-02-27T21:44Z,What can i use that is faster for windows 7.
,andorius,2012-02-27T22:23Z,"@JD_GSDB I think it is easier to use utorrent

,QborT,2012-02-28T03:47Z,"LuLz @ the n00bies, extremezone didn't split this.  DiAMOND is the ripper (a scene group) extremezone is simply the uploader. 

It's like asking why the corner store split the twix chocolate bar into 2, fuckin hell time to learn kids."

,Idubthe,2012-02-28T20:09Z,"Can someone tell me what happen to the "" download torrent file"" buttons they have disappeared on files I've DLed previously. Very sporadic  all over the site.  I only say so because I have never used the magnet method before and not quite sure what if any I would need to change on my Utorrent setup. 
+ 1 for the upload ( glad I got it before $h*t disappeared"
,JoelisaH,2012-02-29T01:42Z,Thank you +1

,AMIT005,2012-02-29T17:14Z,I am not able to download the torrent. link is absent..any idea?
,JonJon2799,2012-03-01T16:15Z,"hey extremezone, how do i get the sub titles to play wen watching the movie on a dvd player ? is there something else i need to do ? "
,iberic,2012-03-02T00:44Z,Powerslave0 maybe its better you start and protect your selfs you ips etc and maybe just maybe its easy four the guy that uploads not to upload a big file becouse something hapennds he dont has to start all over again but what do yoy guys know the way you talk its visible you never give a movie to nobody i think piratebay should start banne ingratefull basterds becouse its really risky in this times to get jail to give something to people like you guys that dont say thanks and dont value a free top work... thanks diamond and extremezone you are one of the old ones keep up with the goo work !!!we the old guard salute you
,hoakm,2012-03-03T04:44Z,Thanks for the movie
,hushuoba,2012-03-03T06:19Z,"can anybody tell me why did the ""download torrent file"" button disappear? not everybody wants to download a torrent right away. they might want to save the files and later choose to download (and not always all files in one toreent). it is so inconvenient without that option."
,Powerslave0,2012-03-04T08:01Z,"iberic, you're an idiot...  One file, TWO files, its still the same size torrent regardless, stupid...  It's just dumb to make TWO files, it's abnormal as compared to the REST of the people who put your stolen shit up.  Get with the times...  Protect my IP, from you?  Fuck off, you're all a bunch of thieves, and you take offense to someone complaining about the torrent?  Wow, some nerve, THIEF...

,TBear420,2012-03-26T12:31Z,@powerslave0 you obviously havent been here long enough to know that extremezone always has amazing uploads and i usually thank him before i even download his files. and to call us thiefs after downloading this yourself is really hypocritical you moron my assumption is you must be a die hard christian who has a severe case of taking the internet too seriously
,yarnek,2012-03-27T00:32Z,"All this crap about 2 files...just load em into freemake, click join, then dvd, tv quality and go make a coffee. Sheesh!"
,yarnek,2012-03-27T00:44Z,"Oh and BTW, thanks to all for this!!"
,serz152,2012-03-27T19:39Z,"Powerslave0 must be one of those sopa supporters infiltraiting the lines of  free trade over the internet, sounds like some rich spoiled brat that cries when mommy or daddy can't buy him his way. What sap why don't you and your political execs go suck it easy you spoiled rich brat"
