Here is a request- can you upload ABC's revenge,
the television series. Can't find a good upload anywhere, and yours are awesome."
,kjll,2012-02-23T06:57Z,"I just read your website saying that any request in 
comments will result in a ban. sorry, but WHY?"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-23T08:33Z,"@kjll. It says so because the site has promised a request system for some time, but it's being delayed all the time. Anyway, guys do write requests there all of the time and i haven't seen any bans there - probably because there's no other way to request movies (except here of course)"
