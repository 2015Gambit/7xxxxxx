Russia has some of the very best peoples of Europe - yet for most of
its history it has been at the mercy of those that prey on the 
human spirit of Russia's own in preventing it from joining in with
the European community in a meaningful and edifying way for all
concerned with the future of mankind and its highest prospects.

It is time to purge the old guard - even now - to prevent the
sort of disaster that could potentially have occurred (as 
envisioned in this great movie starring our dear Mr. Sean
Connery of "James Bond 007" and of "The Russia House movie" fame
"equally" I submit!) The best of gals of Russia are the best 
to be found anywhere at all! Same for some of the great menfolk of
Russia too, I daresay!
