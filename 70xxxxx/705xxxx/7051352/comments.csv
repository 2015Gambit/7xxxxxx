what is the difference with this version?"

,mchlclark,2012-02-24T01:02Z,It has a program called CPU Grabber. It basically turns your machine or CPU  into an older slower version which should allow it to run. If you really hit a dead end and can't get it to work. There are other ways around it. Like using XP MODE with Virtual PC. In conjunction with CPU Grabber. I have ran this on XP successfully. And also Win7. But had to use CPU Grabber both times.

It makes game compatible with newer systems. 

The Problem is. I uninstalled it from my win7 pc to repeat the process to make sure I had it right. And now it wont work? It makes it to the Game screen where it has Play Game-Options-Dark Diary etc.. But I click play and it just returns to desktop. I still have it running on my xp PC so will leave that one alone. I will find a solution and post it. If you find one first please let me know."

install for Windows7. It includes two files I didn't include in my upload. The site posts give it a good review saying it worked for them. I am trying it now to get it back on my WIN7 PC. Give it a go and let me know if it works for you. Tip Instead of using the virtual .iso I burnt it to an actual CD. I think the patch looks for ""D"" drive by default."
