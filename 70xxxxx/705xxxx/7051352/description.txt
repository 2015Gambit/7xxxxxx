The Complete Legacy of Kain Series:

1.Blood Omen

2.Soul Reaver

3.Soul Reaver 2

4.Blood Omen 2

5.Defiance

All for PC

All woking, tested thoroughly.

Can be some issues with hardware
which I managed to work around.

These work arounds and complete
installation guides all included.

There aren't any NO CD/DVD Cracks
as the only ones I could find were
not working or malware. 

So the patches remove copy protection 
allowing use of physical discs or 
mounting disc files on virtual drives
for installation and Play Discs.
Up to you.

I know most of you will understand what 
to do. But I did my best to give each
game a how to file for those that don't.

If anyone finds some clean NO CD/DVD Cracks
Please share. They would be really handy.
