Lots of Fonts for Macedonian Cyrillic.

Unrar, copy all fonts (not the whole Folder),then paste into your Font Folder in Control Panel and you are done.

I guess you all know how to add/manage fonts in text,but just in case someone dont know how to ,il spare you the posts and questions! :D
To add-em in (Word,Notepad,Text etc) find/select Font then select the Name of the Font you like to write (theres lots to choose from, like: ÐœÐ°Ñ†ÐµÐ´Ð¾Ð½Ð¸Ð°Ð½ Ð¢Ð¼Ñ ).
Hope that helps^^
