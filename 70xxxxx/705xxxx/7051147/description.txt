The Chicharones have wrapped up recording their upcoming album \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Swine Flew\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and to celebrate the fruits of their labors they decided to create and release the brand new absolutely free mixtape \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Por Que (Pork, Eh?)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This time around Josh & Sleep were on tour with nothing but stolen mixtapes and work out jams to write to. A mash-up of classic and mainstream instrumentals, all re-imagined and re-written with the original Chicharones flavor.
