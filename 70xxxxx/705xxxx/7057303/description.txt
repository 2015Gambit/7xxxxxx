I wanted to have all the Abit motherboards\\\' specs since Abit is closing down its site. So I just saved the webpages in PDF format and put it in a folder structure(478, am2, etc). I worked a lot with it, but I think I wont regret it, it may be very helpful some days. So I decided to put it up on TPB, so others can have the official specs too.

Use it in the memory of Abit! :)
R.I.P. Abit!! :(
