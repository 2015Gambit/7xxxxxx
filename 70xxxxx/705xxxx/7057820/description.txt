Double click on Make_Language_XXXX.command to switch language.

If you want to use a different server than Molten WoW then modify

Logon-Server.txt

and then run a Make_Language script.

Added new script "Make_Language_scripts.command".  If you want to modify
the code for the Language scripts then modify enUS and run the Make_Language_scripts.command
to propagate changes to to other Lang scripts.

A bunch of new WoW.mfil and .mfil files just for saving for future use if needed.
