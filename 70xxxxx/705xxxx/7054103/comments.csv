This show has been fairly described by it's director as ""The Sopranos in thongs""
Is there any chance of getting the following episodes? :-) 
P.S. ""Thongs"" are what Aussies wear on their feet and are aka flip-flops, hawaii chappal, Japanese sandals, or jandals. 
They are not ""freckle floss"" ;-) "
