,nuksecurity,2012-02-28T01:52Z,"Independent film.  Bullshit Global warming propaganda.  Watched it, don't bother."
,nuksecurity,2012-02-28T01:55Z,Awful  Don't download.
,psy_mon,2012-02-29T08:56Z,"The acting's pretty bad, but i don't think it's THAT bad- worth a watch if you like sci-fi (it's only 23mins  anyway)."
,GrimieB,2012-03-01T09:27Z,"Its not that bad. I would go as far as even say it was decent. Your meat probably needs a break between porn videos to recoup a 'wee bit, this 23 minute vid may allow for a 'wee bit of skin healing as well.Pun intended. At the very least it'll give the lotion time to do some good on that raw wanker you're sporting now a days. lol ;-)"
,gullitskatt,2012-03-05T08:19Z,"@nuksecurity LoL, global warming propaganda :D
You live in your bubble :p


This was some REALLY bad episode.
I for one do not wanna see more.
Bad acting well some, bad story line extremely.
Even with as idea that is good as such, fact nothing happen in episode.
If someone wants to see more, you can at least do more for audience than do a watch-paint-dry-episode.

okey it not to be a full actions 100% episode, but WHAT was this.

I will look on next if itÂ´s come, just because i like scifi.
But i need more than this, otherwise straight to trash bin."

global warming is propaganda?!? really??
have you ever looked outside? been to another country?
the weather IS CHANGING and human development is the cause.

stop drinking the bush-kool-aid.

,teamosil,2012-03-23T07:15Z,"I actually was pretty blown away.  I mean, you gotta take it for what it is.  They had a budget of $15,000.  They release it for free via torrent.  Sounds like they're in it more to do something cool than to make a profit.  It isn't going to be like a $50 million movie.  But given the constraints they are operating within, I'd say it's damn impressive.  Well worth checking out."
,kijkekijkenietkope,2012-03-26T13:45Z,"Very nice movie.
Can't wait for the next part."
,crumrugin,2012-09-05T23:14Z,fantastic premise..great stuff for a small budget ..cant wait for part 2 ..thanks I love gigantic spaceships
