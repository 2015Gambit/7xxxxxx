,jesusshockwave,2012-03-25T11:52Z,"Seeded fully, I switch between seeding my two biggest torrents, this and the Motion Loops."
,jazerati27,2012-06-10T17:11Z,"Please Seed. Or If you can give me a ""Direct Link"" for ""5) Particle Storm Countdown - 720p - mp4 - 239.9MB"" I really like that one, especially.

If you can upload it, I wish it on Mediafire if its ok. Hope so, God Bless!"
,jesusshockwave,2012-07-01T11:55Z,"Thank you for your advice in seeking to get a direct link to download everything. I am looking into using Media fire, Dropbox, Pogoplug, or other various sources. Look in the coming weeks for a direct link. Thanks and God Bless you too :)"
,jesusshockwave,2012-07-01T12:01Z,Can't do Mediafire as the individual file limit is 200MB. These are 1080 HD videos and half go over that amount. I have pogoplug and will try and set that up. Stay tuned for more info.
