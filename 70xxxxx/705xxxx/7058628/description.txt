The Resistance of Mrs Brown

From BBC Radio 4 (omnibus on Radio 4 Extra). Written by Ed Harris; Full-cast dramatisation.

It's 1944, and after the British defeat at Dunkirk and the Americans' decision to stay out of the war, we find ourselves at home in bomb-strewn suburbia with Mrs Brown. She is very ordinary, her husband died in the invasion, and now she pushes a tea trolley for the Nazi Military Administration in Whitehall.

Mrs Brown wants nothing more than to be a nobody. Determined above all to survive, and to protect her daughter, she never misses an opportunity to go unnoticed. But when she's contacted by the Resistance, will she keep her resolution?

Mrs Brown is given a task.

She will have one week to complete it.

One week to decide.

One week to prepare.

One week to live.
