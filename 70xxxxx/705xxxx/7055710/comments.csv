I wish I had something to share with you, but you already have everything I have.  I've noticed many request books.  I'm looking for a few authors and was wondering if you had access to them.  1) Jillian Larkin (Vixen & Ingenue),  2) Lucy Monroe, 3) Nancy Drew books.  I know you are very busy and will certainly understand if you do not have time to look for these.  Thanks again for all the books you upload!!!"
