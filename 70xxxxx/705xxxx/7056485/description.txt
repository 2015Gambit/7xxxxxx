Synopsis
CIA analyst Jack Ryan tries to foil a Soviet plot to assassinate the Pope, who has threatened to resign in a protest against Soviet domination (the novel is set during the 1980s, when a real-life attempt was made on the Pope's life). Clancy's novel is distinctive from his other works in that not a single shot is fired until very late in the story.
