,slybunda,2012-06-10T18:32Z,"its in chink audio, no point downloading."
,Fuqthegovt,2012-07-05T08:16Z,@slybunda fucking waaa. If you don't know japanese then learn or read subtitles (if you can). otherwise you probably shouldn't be watching anime. the american/euro version is usually edited/censored to hell and back.

,SullySadface,2012-08-14T15:37Z,HELP HOW DO I WATCH THIS I CANNOT USE SUBTITLE AS I AM UNABLE TO READ OR WRITE
,Fuqthegovt,2012-09-24T01:29Z,I can't believe people are bitching about jap audio. NEWSFLASH: anime worth a crap comes straight from japan and usually isn't edited or translated. You want the english garbage get a jap buddy that knows english to translate it if you are too lazy to do it yourself. Otherwise watch the watered down american garbage on hulu.
