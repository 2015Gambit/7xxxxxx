"You Know I'm Not as Smart as You 
                      (Buenos Aires, Argentina)"

Teams race through Buenos Aires, Argentina, 
where the stress of the Race causes one Team to 
break down into tears. Meanwhile, chaos ensues 
when Racers are required to sharpen their 
numerical skills at the world's largest cattle 
market.

(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower+
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
