It's dementions are 560x304!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT IS NOT 720p pal, so I recommend you change your entire title. Slow download as there are not a lot of seeders, but I took this one since I thought maybe it would be one of the DVDs that some uploaders that know what they are doing tweek to look HD.This is not one of those. Regular DVD quality.  I own the DVD and it looks better than this supposed ""blu ray rip"", so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they want to wait 2 hours for it to download. Thanks anyway for the upload, I always appreciate it, even if the title is a total lie. "
