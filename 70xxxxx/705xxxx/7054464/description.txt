This package contains the Low builds of Quake Epsilon + Mission pack 1 + Mission pack 2.


Quake Epsilon builds are graphically-advanced builds of shareware Quake 1 for Windows/Linux/Mac, able to be upgraded to the full version of Quake along with it's mission packs Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity, just by dropping the full-version .pak files in the right directories. They consist of the Darkplaces engine and many, many graphical mods from members of the Quake One forums and elsewhere (these are listed at the bottom of the page). If it were not for these brave troopers, Epsilon would not exist. The builds are legal and do not contain any pirated content. Just simple unzip-and-play stuff, no mucking about.

There are four tiers of builds, low, medium, high, and ultra.


Ultra builds - Ultra-high-quality texturing and bump-maps enabled. For excellent machines with excellent graphics cards. 2011-year or upwards graphics card, recent quad-core cpu, 4gb+ ram recommended.

High builds - Recommended for most modern machines. Ultra-high-texturing but no bump-mapping. Half the size & memory usage of the Ultra build. For good machines with good graphics cards. Main difference between this and "Ultra" is there is no support or texturing for bump maps. Geforce 7800 or upwards, dual-core 3ghz & upwards, 2gb ram and upwards recommended.

Medium builds - For medium spec computers and laptops with reasonable onboard 3d chipsets. High-quality texturing, fewer shader effects, no bump-mapping, graphical options optimised for performance. About half the size and memory usage of the "High" build.

Low builds - Uses the QRP texture pack and the old models, which is less gritty and grimy but more like the original quake, and uses less memory yet again. This is a low-spec build for people with older laptops, graphics cards without shader support, and older machines in general. But it's also for those who want more of a "original opengl quake" experience, but with slightly more "HD" texturing.
