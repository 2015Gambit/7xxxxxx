,ManLemon,2012-02-29T16:40Z,"@ronin6 and anyone asking about where the .torrent file is, Pirate Bay switched to magnetlinks wich means you don't download the torrent file through their server but via other users themselves. Wait 30-40 seconds for it to download and you're good to go. Don't be so hasty in complaining or check the frontpage for news, they've been talking about this switch for months now..."
,WyzeAzz9,2012-03-01T14:39Z,"The magnet link doesn't seem to be working...can someone confirm this? If not what should I be doing differently, I've successfully downloaded other torrents since the site changed to this format.."
