,dustyshot,2012-03-27T23:15Z,"Funny, how this torrent has more seeds than an actual good quality bdrip. I do not even see how this could be a bdrip and not a dvdrip. Its smaller than a normal dvdrip. Anything smaller than 700 mb is not a dvdrip or anything else, but terrible quality. I would not want to watch something I can hardly tell what it is with pixelation going on.

DVD is outdated even if they are still selling the DVD's, Bluray is better. No arguement needed, because if you don't have a hdtv, then you don't know how Bluray is meant to be. Laptops are HD and HDTV's are HD. This right here download is not what it is claimed to be."
