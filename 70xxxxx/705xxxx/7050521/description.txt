    Directed by Rolf Olsen                                                   
                                                                             
    "An unbelievable journey into a mad, sin filled world..."                
                                                                             
    "For over two years a carefully selected shooting crew led by            
    it's director, the prize winning and internationally renowned            
    Emerson Fox, literally fought it's way through the unknown               
    highlands and the dangerous jungles of the vast deserts of the Asian     
    Capitals. Many times they ended up in prison, hospital or over           
    flooded areas and nearly had to give up their target. They were          
    beaten up, robbed or lavishly invited. They fought against red tape,     
    administration and governments as well as against diseases,              
    pickpockets or blackmail."                                               
                                                                             
    "This film is the unbelievable result of those two years. It             
    reveals a wild and weird world, a bizarre world - a strange mixture      
    of the divine and the demonic - a bloodthirsty, lustful, sin-sick        
    world."                                                                  
                                                                             
    This mondo film depicts graphic scenes from the Asian continent. We      
    witness a mass piercing in India and cremated remains of human bodies    
    dumped into the Ganges river in clear sight of bathers. The camera       
    then shows Japanese sex clubs which reenact bizarre sexual rituals       
    and S&M fantasies. There is also a very graphic sex change operation     
    in Singapore. There is also midget and female wrestling featured to      
    round out the fun.
