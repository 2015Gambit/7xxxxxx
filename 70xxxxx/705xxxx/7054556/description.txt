A songwriter in the Tom McRae/David Ford vein, the Edinburgh-based Alex Cornish could be forgiven for feeling hard done by. No Shore is his third made-on-a-shoestring album of finely wrought, intricately textured and sharply observed songs that, had they Chris Martin's name above the title, would surely shift millions. Like McRae and Ford, Cornish perhaps lacks the demotic touch that has made Coldplay so huge; that may mean his coffers won't swell, but for fans, this favouring of subtlety over sledgehammers will be a cause for celebration. New songs here such as the trumpet-pocked Rely, the piano-driven Open Your Eyes and the lilting, jingle-jangling Always A Way typify a beautiful album that has "Mercury Prize shortlist wild card" written all over it.
