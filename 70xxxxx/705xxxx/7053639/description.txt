ADM EXTENDED EDITION VERSION INFO:

Original Runtime: 117 min
New Runtime: 135 min
Amount of time Cut/Added: 25 added (incl. replacement scenes and audio overlays) 

Cuts removed/added/extended:

List of changes:

1) Opens with "Reedited by ADigitalMan" logo, Blade Runner style 
2) After the company logos, a snippet of deleted "happy ending" audio over a
   black screen where Rachel says, "You know what I think? That we were made for
   each other." 
3) "Tears in the Rain" opening credits. 
4) Original "Eye on the City" opening sequence. The "reactive eye" of the Final
   Cut was too damn distracting ... you spend your time looking at the iris and
   not the reflections. 
5) Holden's shooting cuts to black. Fade in on the advertising blimp heading
   downtown. 
6) Extended intro to Deckard with more voiceovers, including the bit about
   Holden and the bit about his ex-wife. 
7) Final Cut video of the whole Spinner ride to headquarters. 
8) Removed the "Skin-Job/N-word" voiceover ... Deckard refers to them as skin
   jobs himself later, which makes this awkward line even more misplaced. 
9) Extended description of Leon's abilities. 
10) Holden in the Hospital. Brief bit the next morning as Deckard flips through
    the files and some of the voiceover about Tyrell growing slaves. 
11) Alternate version of Leon's hotel room. 
12) Audio of Deckard trying to find four phony ones in a city of 160 million
    over his ride to the apartment. Deckard runs in the rain. 
13) Deckard thinks about his wife while thumbing through photos. Note that he
    and his wife are on the same porch as Rachel and her mom. Hmmmmm. 
14) No Friggin Unicorns (TM). I understand the shot's significance, but is
    inserted ham-fistedly and fits with nothing else in the film. It's the
    midichlorians of Blade Runner. There are enough other hints and the unicorn
    origami has a beautiful significance all its own without needing this to
    distort its meaning. 
15) Alternate Esper analysis. I edited this down some. I especially like how
    this scene actually freezes on the same shot as Deckard's printout. Why it
    was changed to something that doesn't fit escapes me. 
16) Deckard studies the fish scale at the sushi bar. 
17) "Final Cut" video for the snake scale analysis and conversation with the
    snake maker. 
18) Extended bit outside of Taffey Lewis' bar. More hockey-masked go go dancers. 
19) Bartender tells Deckard to talk to "the artists" about the snakes. 
20) Deckard wonders why a replicant would be doing snake dances while he waits
    to corner Zhora. 
21) Final Cut video for Zhora busting through the glass through Rachel shooting
    Leon. 
22) Voiceover about "it's not real blood" added. 
23) Rachel and Deckard walk through the streets before heading back to his
    place. 
24) Extended sequence where Rachel watches Deckard get clean. 
25) Rachel watches Deckard sleep. 
26) Extended love scene. 
27) Return to visit Holden in the Hospital/Bryant and Gaff eavesdrop. 
28) Security check as Sebastian and Roy ascend in the elevator. 
29) "Father" remixed better than the Final Cut. Extended gore. 
30) Roy descends in the elevator, hears the computer and calls her "Mom." 
31) Deckard is a smartass to the cop/"Good luck Blade Runner." 
32) Removed final voiceover at Roy's death. "Final Cut" dove sequence. Final Cut
    video from rooftop to the end. 
33) Gaff says "Are you sure you are a man? It's hard to tell who's who around
    here." 
34) No happy ending.
