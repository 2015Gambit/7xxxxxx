RJD2, AKA the Insane Warrior - 2010 - We Are The Doorways

This wasn't on here and I couldn't find the MP3s anywhere, so I located a FLAC rip and pulled it down to 320kbps CBR with ID3 and ReplayGain info using foobar2000 and LAME.

I did NOT apply ReplayGain during the conversion, that would have permanently altered the tracks.

Yes, FLAC would be better, except the deck in my truck prefers MP3s.  If you want the FLAC files, post a comment here and I'll upload the torrent I found.
