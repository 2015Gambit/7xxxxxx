I have no idea why the smaller resolution is more popular than this official release.

Downloaded via Sprint 3G (Denver) with tTorrent (non-Market Android app) and played with RockPlayer (non-Market Android app) on my Evo ""4G"". Fast, easy, smooth and crisp. No special config or root access needed. My Dad watches Craig Ferguson this way.

Will copy to PC and seed to 5:1 when I get home.

Awesome rooftop scenes and a nice plot, with zero dialog. Left me with tons of questions though: What's with the ring? Who IS that guy? What's in the suitcase?!?

Can't wait for a Part 2.

Hollywood can go suck it. There's like three shows on TV that I ever watch, versus at least six Web only and a constant flood of one-offs that are far more entertaining than the MAFIAA sheltered pablum people pay so much for the privilege of watching, commercials and all. Indie artists are our last best hope to save the world from the insane ramblings of corporate tyranists."
