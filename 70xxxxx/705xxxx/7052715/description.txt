We started producing this album (yet we did not realize it then) in the 2007 when we released Best Before Spain. That track created a spinning vortex of creativity that sucked our lives as a whole and spat us out in the form of our music. It was a heck of an journey and all we hope to achieve for you as a listener, is that you could embark to this journey witt the same kind of fun, blood, sweat and tears intensity that we were on while producing. Thank you to all our families and friends for putting up with us (I know the volume and the constant previews must\'ve been a stress). PLUR to all the old-skool ravers and for the future ones - keep the scene going with love and understanding. 

I\'ve got nothing but rispec o/ to my fellow ravers.
