Debbie gets a spot on the roster of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, which is referenced only as "Texas" throughout the movie. The only problem is that Debbie doesn't have enough money to get there on her own, and her mom doesn't want to help her, so her friends decide to help her out, and they all get small jobs around town to raise money. One day, Debbie is approached by her boss, Mr. Greenfeld, who first offers $10 to see her breasts, another $10 to touch them, and finally another $10 to suckle them. She realizes that they can get more money by performing sexual favors. She finally gets to go when Mr. Greenfeld offers to pay for everything if Debbie helps him reliza his fantasy and let him "score a touchdown". Written by Mike N
