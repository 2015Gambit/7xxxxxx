You need to have your drive modded (latest firmware is LT 3.0). You need:
Jungleflasher (1.92)
latest firmware (Download at ixtreme.net)
a ck3 pro with probe 3 (xconsoles.com)
x360usb pro (xconsoles.com)
molex power cord (unless you want to power with your desktop) (xconsoles.com)

Jungleflasher comes with a very good pdf instruction guide that will guide you through it once you have the proper equipment. I use xconsoles.com cause they are the cheapest and most reliable in my opinion"
