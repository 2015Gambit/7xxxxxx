,bon-bongo,2012-02-24T10:01Z,"Hey people, situation really fucked up across net - r00 nowhere to be found. All public torrents miss it.

Just downloaded missing part form rapidshare and integrated in existing archive set.

IT ISN'T ORIGINAL ARCHIVE, but i believe it work, so you welcome to try it:

I'm trying bon-bongo's file as soon as it downloads.  Thanks, bon-bongo."
,outback7,2012-02-24T18:09Z,"bon-bongo's file appears to work.  Haven't had time to watch the entire episode, but it unzipped just fine and played fine at random points all throughout the file.  Thanks again, bon-bongo!"
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-03-02T20:46Z,No 00 file in the uploaded torrent here by sceneline.
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-03-02T20:58Z,Have been trying to get the single file for over 14 min. but doesn't connect to anyone.
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-03-02T21:11Z,Gave up on that single piece (After 20 min. had not connected to anyone) and am downloading the file as a single file with no rars here (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7056048/Law_and_Order_SVU_S13E15_720p_NO_RAR_ZIP).
