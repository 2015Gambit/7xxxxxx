Things to note:
* Anno 2070 stored all music tracks encoded in mp3. This torrent provides them in that format exactly, without re-encoding.
* Collateral Damage, Drone Predators and Civilian Casualties are split into parts. They were stored like that in the game.
* Drone Predators (second part) cuts off abruptly at the end. It was like that in the game.
* The sound skips at the start of Grinding Teeth. It was like that in the game, and it is like that in the CDrip version. This is not a glitch.
* All track numbers are set according to the complete (and the longest) track list on CD covers, which means that there are gaps in numbering, since some tracks are missing or unidentified.
* In all available rips of the 2-disk set the tracks Our Borrowed Time and Tumbling Raindrops are identical. This torrent includes one track named "Our Borrowed Time (Tumbling Raindrops)"
It is not unlikely that the 8 unknown tracks consist of 7 tracks from the missing list and the track that was originally supposed to be named Our Borrowed Time or Tumbling Raindrops, but was replaced by a duplicate instead.
