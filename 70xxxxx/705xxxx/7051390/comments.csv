And to anyone else looking to download this game.  It's not in english, it's korean.  There is an English patch that you can download from a dedicated fan site.  But even if you manage to patch it, it's extremely difficult to play since you need a KSSN in order to register (Korean Social Security Number)  Meaning, you have to be a korean citizen in order to play.  I've heard that there was a way around this, but it you ask me, it's a bit of a hassle.

Here's the site.

Well I put the same in the description field and in the title that had something of a hurry. XD"
