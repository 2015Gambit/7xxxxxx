This is a 320kb mp3 capture of the 37 minute jam currently streaming on Neil's website, ostensibly 'promoting' the upcoming long awaited Neil Young and Crazy Horse album. It is EPIC, starting off as a variation on "Fuckin' Up" before switching halfway through to a loose version of "Cortez The Killer". A must hear for any Neil Young/Crazy Horse fans! :)
