[H],Eppo,2012-02-26T23:24Z,"@pette12
let's just not do that and look closely before we download something ;)"
,Alfah,2012-02-27T20:09Z,@Pette12: You should be thrown out. If this is not what you are looking for find the right movie! And insulting anonymously is for losers!!!

,muscule_boy,2012-02-28T04:39Z,"I just wanted to say that it is great that someone takes the time to generate sub-titles in any language for a movie. I do however, think that hard-burning the sub-titles into the movie is not the best thing to do. If sub-titles are included in the torrent as sub-title files (such as text srt files), then someone else that knows the language can also translate it into another language to help more people. If English speakers want to watch the video without the sub-titles, then the included sub-title file(s) do not have to be used and the movie can be viewed without sub-titles.
I am just making a suggestion which benefits everyone.  
Thanks uploader.  Peace !!"
,MAMBWAR,2012-02-28T05:22Z,nice work.can u plz upload red tails
,theeccentrik,2012-02-28T05:49Z,"I agree and it's users choice if he downloads or not but in my humble opinion anyone who downloads a camera file/dvd thats over 2Gb needs a shrink. 
It seems most of nlupper's cam movie files are all 4gb+, that and the hardcoded nl subs are a big deterrent.
my 2 cents."

,TimWithaT,2012-03-01T21:47Z,"@Pette12 (The 12 stands for your age i guess?)
It is just hilarious to see so many retarted posts. 
Throwing someone off ThePiratebay because he uploads films with hardcoded subs..?

And @Nordin.. First of all don't make sentences people can't read?
Analphabet? Nice try but it is: Illiterate..
And how can someone be illiterate when he/she writes a comment without just typing in some letters? akward."

,fredsgirl,2012-03-05T03:12Z,"NLUPPER002, Could you please UL ""Act of Valor""?  The only one I found so far was all rar files."
,Barkingspyder,2012-03-05T09:27Z,"Re files over 2GB. Some people (like me) prefer the large file as they are usually ready to burn to a DVD and need no conversion.  I don't watch movies on my PC, I like to sit in my recliner and enjoy the full effect with good sound on a big screen.  I do think hardcoded subs are a problem if they are in a language other than English, which is only good if it's a movie in some language other than English.

Thanks to all who upload your effort is most appreciated."
,westie420uk,2012-03-09T16:49Z,"When people stop bitching about the Dutch subs that it tells you it has in the title could someone rate the quality of the V & A, i just want to know if it's worth downloading or not!"

,ogbugzy818,2012-04-05T20:58Z,people this uploader is a freakin moron. any title that says TS2DVD means it's a CAM. He's putting the dvd title to get everyone to download from him
,ricki3,2012-04-14T15:31Z,fantastic film 
,TyMod,2012-05-22T22:31Z,"You guys are the morons.

HE IS UPLOADING THEM IN DVD FORMAT WHICH IS WHAT DVDR is. Please google shit before commenting.

He is not trying to get seeds at all. In fact he is more streight foward about what he is uploading then many other uploaders.

TS2DVD means it was converted from a TS rip to DVD format so all you lazy asses have no work to do other then to burn it.

If you don't know what DVDr means then dont download.

Yes the vid quality is shit, its a TS rip but atleast you can watch it.

Thank you."
