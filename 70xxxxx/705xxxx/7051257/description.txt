1. Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bopup Communication Server is a secure messaging suite designed to 
provide efficient and private communication over networks of any size. 
The server meets most of the critical business needs, such as 
centralized management, the Active Directory (LDAP) support, message and 
file transfer logging. It can be easily deployed over the business 
infrastructure to unite the entire company's offices and other locations 
into one internal IM workspace with control over messaging groups, user 
permissions to view others and send messages and documents, a message 
and transfer archive with printing support. 

Since the server stores and delivers offline messages and files, users 
never lose information they are supposed to receive. Messaging is 
encrypted with strong algorithms so personal and group conversations are 
safe and secure even if data is sent via the Internet. Users can send 
messages with formatted text, links and graphic emoticons (smileys), 
organize their personal Contact Lists, access their contacts from any 
workplace and see who is online and available for communication. 
The client software can be configured on the server to run in the 
Confirmation Mode, which means that the client pops up every time a new 
message is received and keeps the window on top until the user confirms 
the message. 

To crown it all, Bopup Communication Server is fast to deploy and easy 
to use. It has a great and flexible user interface and comes with a 
built-in messaging system for scheduled and planned user notifications 
including the File Distribution system that offers a managed 
distributing documents to users. Client instant messengers can be easily 
installed and distributed via Group Policies with the support of 
pre-installed settings. 


Key features:

* Secure and Private Communication
All transmitted messages and files are encrypted with strong encryption 
algorithms based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 
algorithms. That is the first and primary way to make corporate 
and business IM safe and secure. 

* Authentication Modes
The server supports various modes to authenticate and authorize 
connected users. Choose the best way for your corporate and business 
infrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows 
Authentication (SSPI) and Private login/password.

* Messaging Groups
The centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize 
a flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and 
send/receive-only permissions set for each user. 

* User Presence Status
Online statuses allow users to see the current status of each user in 
their Contact List, i.e. Online, Away, Offline/Not available and control 
their own status. 

* Contact List Access
Users can organize personal Contact Lists and access them from any 
workplace and location. Users are informed if there are new contacts 
available on the IM server and if they can be added to their Contact 
Lists. 

* Offline File Transfer and Urgent Messaging
Enable message exchange and file transfer even if some users are 
currently not available. Offline messages and files are automatically 
delivered by the IM server to the recipient when the latter goes online. 
Send urgent messages for high-priority tasks and notifications. 

* File Distribution
Easy, managed and secure distributing files and directories to client 
workstations. Important documents can be assigned and delivered to users 
from the server in a fully automated mode with a set of advanced flags. 

* Terminal Server Support
The client software fully supports the Terminal Server, Citrix 
environments and the Windows XP Fast User Switching feature. Users can 
communicate even if they are connected to the same server via Terminal 
Client sessions or have open logon sessions on the same computer 
simultaneously. 

* Confirmation Mode
Activate the Confirmation Mode which pops up the client messenger when 
a message is received and keeps it on top of other windows until the 
user clicks the Confirm Message button. That is the best way to attract 
users' attention. 

* Centralized Notification
Send notifications and urgent messages and keep users updated on any 
events and information. These messages are automatically delivered by 
the server at the scheduled time at the specified intervals. 

* Message and Transfer Logging & Archiving
Browse, search and view the entire message and file transfer archives. 
Save and print information for any period and for any person. 

* Instant IM Client Updates
The messaging clients can be instantly updated from the central IM 
server. This feature allows to keep IM client versions up-to-date and 
deploy new software updates and patches in a completely automated way 
without having to manually install it on all user computers.

* Active Directory (LDAP) Support
Import user accounts from a global catalog and create the local users 
database on the server within a few seconds. Import accounts by choosing 
different criterias: by Organizational Units (OU) or by Groups. 
The server also provides integration options with a directory and can 
search and import accounts "on-the-fly" when new users connect.

* Access from a Command Line Interface
Control the communication server and send messages directly from 
a command line interface. Send scheduled and instant messages to users 
and groups from third-party applications, scripts or batch files.

* Fast to Deploy and Easy to Use
Neither experience nor special skills are needed for installing the 
server. Just go through the steps of the Setup Wizard and get your IM 
system running in a few minutes. 



2. System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bopup Communication Server requires the following minimum system 
configuration: 

- 1 GHz processor (or higher recommended) 
- 512 MB RAM 
- 70 MB free disk space (*) 
- Microsoft Windows NT 4.0/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7 (**) 
- Microsoft SQL 2000/2005/2008 Server and higher 
- Active Directory (LDAP) presence (optional)
- Network connection configured for TCP/IP protocols
- Internet connection (optional)

* - Specified disk space is required if the product installed with 
built-in SQL server.

** - The built-in MSDE 2000 package that comes with the installation is 
not supported by Windows Vista and later systems and on that system 
the communication server should be installed using an existing external 
Microsoft SQL Server software.


Bopup Communication Server requires Windows administrator rights to run 
the Setup Wizard and install the service. After installation the server 
can be run and managed under a non-administrator Windows account. 



3. Installation Tips
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before the installation, make sure that the TCP/IP protocol is installed 
in your Network Settings. Client computers should be able to access the 
server computer. If you plan to organize communications via 
a WAN/Internet connection, make sure that the server IP address 
is shared and reachable from outside locations. 

Since Bopup Communication Server logs and archives all message, file 
transfer history and user conversations, it needs a database server to 
store all the data. The server installation file comes in 2 setup 
packages: the first package requires an installed Microsoft SQL server 
(on a local or remote computer) and the second package includes the MSDE 
2000 engine that can be installed together with Bopup Communication 
Server. 

During the setup of the IM server you can choose from 3 available 
installation modes: 

- "Install the SQL server on this computer" 
This is the Local Installation Mode and the most preferred way to 
install the IM server. Use it to install MSDE 2000 that comes with the 
setup package as an internal SQL server on the local computer. 

= "Use an existing SQL server"
This is the Remote Installation Mode and you should specify an existing 
Microsoft SQL server running somewhere on a local or remote computer. 
Use this option if you already have an SQL server on your computer or 
on the local area network (LAN) of your company. 

- "Install the Management Console only"
This is the Administration Installation Mode that installs only the 
Management Console to manage an existing database of Bopup Communication 
Server. Choose this mode if you want to manage Bopup Communication 
Server running somewhere on your network from the local computer (Remote 
Administrator Console). 


The Setup Wizard creates an SQL database on the specified SQL server, 
installs and runs the Bopup Communication Server service. The IM server 
is managed via the Management Console (GUI). You can start it either 
using its desktop shortcut or from the "Bopup Communication Server" 
folder in the Start menu.
