Please in the future, refrain from the ""mp3"" file name scheme.

FLAC is lossless, will play on your PC and more importantly, media players such as WD Live, ASUS Oplay etc. for achieving 

No need for artist name in file name! 

Improper:

01 - Every Inambition - The Trews

Proper:

01 - Every Inambition

Thanks!!!"
,tipacanoe,2012-02-25T04:23Z,"Proper EAC Name Scheme:

Under EAC Options - Filename ""tab"", under ""Naming Scheme"" - copy/paste this:

%albumartist%\%albumtitle%\%tracknr2% - %title%

For FLAC with version beta 3 from 29 August 2011, use this command line:

-T ""artist=%artist%"" -T ""title=%title%"" -T ""album=%albumtitle%"" -T ""date=%year%"" -T ""tracknumber=%tracknr%"" -T ""genre=%genre%"" -8 %source% "
[V],Kitlope,2012-02-25T23:36Z,"ummm no. I like having the artist name, especially for when I throw together a compilation. 

And besides, after over a million downloads your the first to mention it. Democracy rules :)"
