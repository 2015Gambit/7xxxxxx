[V],mirrormaster82,2012-02-23T12:24Z,"Hey Xp,I know that you're a ""fan"" of Rob Liefeld as much I am,I've been meaning to write a piece about him,but this guy did this before,so check this shit up:http://www.progressiveboink.com/archive/robliefeld.html"
,Xpatriated,2012-02-24T22:59Z,"Best article ever.  And everything in it is entirely true.  I love it.
Fun fact.  If you google ""worst comic book artist,"" that is the first result.  And any online discussion of horrible comic book artists will have Liefeld mentioned in at least half the posts."
