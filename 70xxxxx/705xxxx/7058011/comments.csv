,greist6,2012-02-26T10:15Z,"Hello

If anyone is willing to direct me to the correct software, I am willing to re-do this and other riffs with proper narration track attenuation.

A soft that can do it as a choose-able second audio track would be all the better

I now marry Rifftrax to movies for myself using Adobe CS 5 Premiere and Soundbooth, but attenuation do-able but laborious.

If there is a better software, please let me know.  I really would like to redo, THIS movie, Birdemic, Thor, the recent Batman, (a few others as well) to the same quality as whoever did The Room or Titanic. 

Riffed movies with the 
- too loud to hear what the Riffers are making fun of- problem are really disappointing

I will post the results for all to enjoy.

,jericho_cane,2012-02-26T11:10Z,Although I would be highly suspect of anyone who would *require* the original audio track of BREAKING DAWN PART 1.
,GummoMarx,2012-02-26T20:37Z,"Just bought the Rifftrax yesterday, so this is perfect.  

This may be the single worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen Manos, Skidoo, The Navy Versus The Night Monsters, Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla....

The attitude on display in this movie towards love, sex, marriage, childbirth, etc., are so overpoweringly sick, it boggles the mind.

In other words, PERFECT Rifftrax fodder!"
,heapgun,2012-02-26T22:00Z,"geist6. I believe what you are looking for is something like Audacity's auto duck feature for automatic decibel attenuation of one audio stream over another. (http://manual.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=Auto_Duck)  

In this case, you would have the Riff be the master and the regular track be attenuated whenever anything is being said in the Riff.

The larger file of these 2 riffs put up was sewn back together with mkvmerge (left in the headers of the file) that would also allow the regular track to be kept on audio 2, but again, why bother? S/he also merged the subtitles in at the same time."

,Spendorf,2012-03-02T05:24Z,Movie audio is a tad louder than the rifftrax (e.g. end credits). Needs better audio mixing other than that funny. I'm so glad I didn't see the movie in theaters.
,Fuse_410,2012-06-28T22:50Z,"Thanks for the upload!

Just a note to fellow Rifftrax fans:
Tickets for the NEW Riff of Manos: The Hands of Fate are still available for most theaters. Tickets are currently on sale, showing is nation-wide (US) Aug. 16th."
