Toilet_sniffer_V you just showed ur magic again !! Fabulous ):!!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-23T20:09Z,"Kole, you're a top man. I'm not doing any more uploads now but I need someone to carry on my work. Think of it as some kind of Ace Rimmer type person (if you're not a Brit you wont get that). Do you think you have it in you to become Toilet sniffer VI?"
,blakew18,2012-04-07T08:13Z,Can you please upload all of American Chopper
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-04-07T17:47Z,"I don't do it any more, sorry."
,Lucybabe,2012-06-16T12:35Z,"Thank you sir for your sterling efforts in this and all your uploads.  Can understand fully why you have retired.  A lot of work goes into preparing torrents and unfortunately most people either don't bother to comment (unless to complain) or else don't seed (even though it does not affect their monthly download allowances).

Anyway thanks again and enjoy your 'retirement'!"
,winshot,2012-07-25T09:34Z,"Dude, don't leave us man. Your type of uploaders are hard to come by. Please try to reconsider. Take a vacation and come back open minded, the universe needs you. Even aliens wait for your uploads man. :)"
,bktheman,2012-08-12T12:22Z,"thanks for this one.. and the effort you have put in...
keep up the sniffing thing...
live long :)"
,gamekiller105,2012-08-30T04:26Z,"Hello Toilet_sniffer_V I can be the second of you but I need to know were you get your resources like the programs to encode movies , TV shows , ETC and were to get the TV shows (series) or buy them or find them in torrents?. I know I don't comment too much but I have very good internet. I don't have torrents really only one that’s my first one but it’s in good quality.  I will seed probably seed 3 to 4 mb if I uploaded a torrent from your account I mean if I become a second of you. I can upload movies in 1080p and 720p also I can upload movie franchises like Home Alone all four movies (in 480p but very good quality). I can upload programs like Photoshop (like you install it and enter the cd key then you replace only one file and you don’t any cd keys errors). I know that you never see me in the comments and you don’t trust me so we can do email to email I send you the torrents and you upload them but in the long run you can’t keep uploading stuff because it gets annoying ? Or it does not?. I am not a nub in any way since your account has a VIP skull making another account of your name and making it second people will think I’m a fake and that’s not good man anyway my email is gamekiller105@ymail.com so feel free to drop by or comment me and tell me I emailed you … ok ..?
