,neeliesu,2012-02-26T09:50Z,"Thank you very much:) Sadly I can't play this via my DivX because it's a Matroska file, does anyone know how I can convert it ...sorry I'm a bit of a novice. Alternatively, does anyone know if there's an AVI file around anywhere? Thank you :)"
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-03-05T05:07Z,@neeliesu: Download VLC media player. Free and will play almost anything. I use it to play MKV and DVD's.
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-03-05T09:57Z,"If anyone is having trouble with this file I have remuxed it with AC3 audio so it will be compatible with more players and stand alone devices. My Blu-Ray player will not play MKV with AAC, also this was written with an unknown software as MediaInfo could not read the writing software."
,neeliesu,2012-03-10T08:28Z,@the torrentlord.... Thanks for your reply :) Will give it a go.
