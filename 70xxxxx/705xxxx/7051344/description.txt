         x264 lowres is dumb. Losing a lot of standalone               
         compatibility for slightly higher quality when there's        
         already even better quality is pointless, and whoever         
         decided on MP4 is a moron because partial files can't be      
         played back. Sucks if you want to start watching while        
          still downloading. Xvid+AVI for life!
