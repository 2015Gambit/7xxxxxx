POtHS 2 - Bible Study - Part 25 - Nancy Missler - The Way of Agape



POtHS Says:Nancy has 20 years of research in her way of Agape. Are having marriage problems ladies? You might want to hear what Nancy has to say about it. This book has made her a welcome speaker at Churches World Wide.


Description:

Start a study group using videos of Nancy teaching an actual Way of Agape Seminar. In her warm and down-to-earth style, Nancy shares how understanding God's Agape Love has changed her life, and how it can change the lives of others.

Nancy shares, "Wherever there is a relationship, God's Way of Agape is needed. It doesn't matter if you have been a Christian seven months, seven years or 77 years. It doesn't matter how many Bible studies you attend, how many Scriptures you know, or even how many books you write, it's still a moment by moment choice to love God and walk in His Way of Agape."

The Way of Agape video series consists of four two-and-a-half hour DVD's, and covers such vital issues as:

   What is God's Love, and how does it differ from human love?
   Why is it so important that we know God loves us? How can we be sure?
   What does it really mean to love (agapao) God in practical terms?
   How do we genuinely love others as ourselves? What if we have "justified" reasons not to want to love them?

This video series has been designed for individual, group, or corporate Bible study. Textbooks, Workbooks, and a Leader's Guide are also available.  http://resources.khouse.org/

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was tortured and Murdered for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures.

Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. With Repentance I Am Now forgiven for my sins past, present and Future.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.
