Description

Plot: Itï¿½â‚¬Ëœs 1861, and the country is engulfed in political turmoil and civil unrest. Tensions rise as high as the stakes of those in power who seek to prevent the imminent abolishment of serfdom at any cost. When an innocent Midsummer celebration in a remote village turns into a slaughter, Tadas unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of a rebellion, with dozens of men at his command. Now he is faced with the tormenting choice between his duty as a rebel leader, and his love for the daughter of the sworn enemy. The ensuing doubts, suffering and death of his comrades force Tadas to take responsibility for both his own actions and the lives of his loved onesï¿½â‚¬ï¿½ and to make a stand against evildoers of the Empire.
