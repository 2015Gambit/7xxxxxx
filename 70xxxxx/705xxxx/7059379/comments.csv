,versus802,2012-02-27T07:53Z,bro can you please make hd bluerray movies compatible for my galaxy nexus. thx bro before 
,Dizzy8,2012-02-27T08:32Z,"@versus802 why don't ""YOU"" make the movie compatable with your galaxy nexus, obviously you already know how to use thepiratebay, so google search the converter program , download it from here, download the movie in whatever the uploader put it in and you like, and there you go! Not so hard."
,HerbDon,2012-02-27T17:46Z,"@versus802 Terrible comment, just terrible.. Shame on you."
,Pyrat42,2012-02-27T22:41Z,"Thank you .Bone. Your a Gentleman and a Scholar.

Versus802, no matter how shameful that comment was, use DVDFAB8.  "
