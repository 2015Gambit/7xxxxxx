,AKJ001,2012-02-25T16:58Z,"Good torrent, username and password worked fine.

However, the program couldn't split my 1080i mpeg-2 ac3 6Ch  file as ""same as source video"" .. the limit of this program is 9000 kbps video quality and 320 kbps audio quality.
But overall, splitting speed, variety of file types, and the simple UI are good reasons to have this program."
[T],promodsharma,2012-02-27T02:58Z,@'AKJ001' - Thanks for the info.

Thanks anyhow."
