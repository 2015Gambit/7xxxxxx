,gorm4660,2012-02-24T03:45Z,No file available...nothing here folks!
[V],spastik64,2012-02-24T11:57Z,@gor4660 you are having problems (i dont know why) but the torrent is perfect (as always we try) and it runs normally. Screenshots here: http://imgur.com/x2vAs
[V],bobo66,2012-02-24T12:30Z,"450 seeders (as of now) can't be wrong and they aren't.  The file is fine. 

ps You should click on the commentor's name, see what and if they have uploaded and get an idea if they are an experienced pirate, a troll or maybe just trying to protect their own torrents (again a troll)


Thanks spaskit64."
