Changes in Version 4.11 :
 
Bugs fixed : 

a) WinRAR did not NTFS â€œCompressedâ€ attribute, when creating RAR archives; 

b) WinRAR crashed in command line mode if @filelist parameter was present and 

â€˜filelistâ€™ did not exist. This bug affected only WinRAR.exe, not RAR.exe; 

c) if -x*\somefolder\* exclusion mask was specified when archiving and if name of

 current folder contained â€˜somefolderâ€™, WinRAR excluded all files and stopped 

creating an archive; 

d) GUI self-extracting archives did not work in Windows Preinstallation Environment

 (Windows PE).
