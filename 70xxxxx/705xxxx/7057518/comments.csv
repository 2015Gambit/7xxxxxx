So here's why - WMP does not support Flac at the moment (you can download a free Flac codec for WMP but that only allows you to play single tracks not right-click folder play). To play this download the free VLC player, install and you're ready to go.

To the UK underground dance scene - Flac is CD quality and therefore you can play these tracks out at a club. MP3 just doesn't have the bass. Plenty of my mates (rasta, asian, english, etc) are stuck in the MP3 groove. The reason they give is they are not tech minded and this Flac thing is confusing. Well look at it this way - the UK produces these great underground dance scenes which sometimes go on to have a worldwide impact. Dubstep came out of the UK Garage scene. The least everyone in the UK dance scene can do is preserve and listen to their music collections at Flac or Wav quality (both are lossless). So you have to download VLC - big deal! 

Its up to all of us in the UK - Do we want to stick with no-bass MP3 or do you want to hear that sub kicking.

If you are a dance head then the only logical answer is - give me the bass.

Download VLC player and put the bass back into UK dance music."
