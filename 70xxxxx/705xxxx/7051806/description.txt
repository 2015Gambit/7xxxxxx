Death Unexplained
Every death is unique - and if it's unexplained or unexpected and the cause is unknown, the team at the Coroner's Court must investigate it. With unprecedented access to forensic pathologists, mortuary technicians, police and the coroner herself, Death Unexplained follows Her Majesty's coroner Alison Thompson and her team as they examine in painstaking detail mysterious, violent and unnatural deaths in west London, one of the busiest jurisdictions in the country. Behind each case is also a very human story; these are movingly told by the families of the deceased, revealing more about their lives and the circumstances of their deaths.


1)  Part 1 
In the first episode, Alison's team investigates a rare case of suspected poisoning; a possible prescription drugs overdose; and the case of a man whose body lay undiscovered for months. In court, the coroner must reach her verdict - who were the deceased, and when, where and how did they die?

2)  Part 2 
Alison Thompson's team is called to investigate the case of a man who died at the scene of a suspicious fire, and an unusual road traffic fatality. In court the coroner must reach her verdict; who were the deceased, and when, where and how did they die?

3)  Part 3 
In this final episode, Alison's team investigates the cases of a man hit by an underground train and a plasterer whose contact with asbestos might have contributed to his death. They are also on standby to deal with British victims of the New Zealand earthquake. In court, the coroner must reach her verdict: who were the deceased and when, where and how did they die?
