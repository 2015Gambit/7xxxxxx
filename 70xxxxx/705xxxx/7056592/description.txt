THIRD STAGE EDITION VERSION INFO:

Original Runtime: 137 min (Original Theatrical Release)
New Runtime: 177 min
Amount of Time Cut/Added: 
-over 40 minutes of additional footage has been added to the theatrical cut.

Synopsis: This is a special widescreen edit of David Lynch's DUNE that
reintegrates footage from the Extended Cut, as well as some deleted scenes,
while attempting to preserve Lynch's vision. Also, unfinished extended scenes
have been fixed so eyes are digitally colored blue. The movie has been edited in
such a way to preserve much of the sound and music of the theatrical cut, while
incorporating Lynch's scenes from the Extended Cut. Removed are the unapproved
prologue paintings, male narrator, and fake "constructed" scenes from the
Extended Cut. Various drafts of the script have been used to put scenes in a
logical order. Our intent was to make an extended cut of DUNE that treats Mr.
Lynch with respect.

Cuts Removed:

1. No shots from the Theatrical Cut have been removed.
2. Fake constructed scenes (such as Reverend Mother Mohiam's trip to Arrakis)
   from the Extended Cut are not reintegrated.
3. Redundant alternate takes from the Extended Cut are not reintegrated.
3. Added paintings from the Extended Cut are not reintegrated.
4. Male narrator from the Extended Cut is not reintegrated. Irulan narration
   only.
5. Music changes from the Extended Cut are not reintegrated or, at the very
   least, toned down.
6. Some trims or ambient sound effect changes have been made to the Extended
   Cut scenes in order to mesh properly with the Theatrical Cut.

Cuts Added/Extended:

1. Lynch scenes from the Extended Cut reintegrated.
2. Some deleted Lynch scenes have been reintegrated.

New Edits In This Version:

1. Eyes have been digitally colored blue in the added unfinished scenes from the
   Extended Cut and deleted scenes.
2. Scenes have been digitally cleaned (frame by frame) to minimize evident
   scratches and dirt.
3. Some music and sound effects have been added to accomodate transitions, rough
   deleted scenes, or to help scenes from the Extended Cut mesh properly with
   the Theatrical scenes.
4. Although the Extended Cut dialogue from the Guild Navigator is used, the
   Extended Cut music is toned down and the original Theatrical ambient sound
   effects have been recreated.
5. In the Extended Cut DVD, the background music is out of synch in the extended
   scene when Reverend Mother Helen Mohiam returns with her report to the
   Emperor. Audio from a television version (converted to 5.1 audio) has been
   used here so the music synchs properly.
6. The scene of the House Shield activating has been moved in order to
   accomodate the restored scene of Thufir talking to Leto about Duncan.
7. Some scenes (such as the worm drowning sequence) have been moved to more
   logical places in the film. Various drafts of the script have been used as a
   guide for certain scenes' chronology.

Conceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original edit: 
Basically, this edit extends the film while trying to preserve Lynch's vision.
