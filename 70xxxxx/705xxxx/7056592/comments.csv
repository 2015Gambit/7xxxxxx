If there's a 1080p version in existence, it would be worth the bandwidth.

F-I-N-A-L-L-Y !!

FINALLY a version of Dune that can truly be called epic.

Grand Prize Award for this.  Absolutely the Best.  I've seen them all.  This one is the best.

For those wondering:
While a respectable Frank Hebert story in its own right, Dune was relegated to ho-hum science fiction.  So why the big deal and enduring fandom of Dune?

Simply put, Dino Delaurentis got hold of it.  By combining the talents of author and moviemaker, the product gave the world visuals that, for once, take the viewer far beyond the original book.  Easily on par with any epic of cinema, Dune could sit with Ben Hur and Lawrence of Arabia in immersive drama and pathos, if perhaps not budget.

But there were so many compromises.  And everyone knew it.  Even the uninitiated moviegoer was generally pleased, but knew deep inside that the movie could have been so much more.  

Of course, we remember that gone were the days of 3 hour shows and certainly without A-list stars.  When Ben Hur and L of A were released, there were still orderly Intermissions and uniformed Ushers that tolerated no yapping in theatres.  Dune was released to a world of disount boxcar moviehouses that as often catered to cattle more than humans.  The classic theatre days are gone, natch, and with it, these kinds of movies.

Despite the theatres, if this cut, as we see here in this torrent, had been released first on VHS and later on DVD, Dune would be on every shelf of every home, pehaps next to vomitous drivel like Titanic and Avatar.   Or perhaps not, once the audience understood what a real movie was, they may have been less ready to compromise their tastes for those other titles, either.

This fanedit by k3nd00d restores my confidence in at least a fraction of the viewing public.  It is clean, pro, well thought-out, well-executed, and smooth.  It is satisfying and captivating to watch.  This is a dedicated and talented editor that built this version.  This is the art of fanedit simply at its finest. "
