,dulta,2012-03-03T12:08Z,anyone got a serial number for this?
,miktime,2012-03-12T03:17Z,"It works perfectly, just follow the instructions. "
,zenizm,2012-03-13T19:49Z,should have a keygen as the previous version (Color Efex Pro 3) so it'd be safe to update the program.
,zenizm,2012-04-28T22:27Z,"Just downloaded it.

Did as the instruction. The plug-in for Photoshop works fine on both CS5 and CS6. Aperture plug-in is okay. But for Lightroom, it won't start. I suppose there's something wrong with the cracked ""Color Efex Pro 4.app"" in the folder.

Version 4.002 is out alreadyâ&#x20AC;Ś hope to see it is seeding soon. It would be best if it'll be seeding with SN or keygen so we will be able to update the application by ourselves without waiting for another patch if new version of the application is available."

Si if anyone has a serial/activation key 
(x-force to generate keygen for color efex pro  ?)"
