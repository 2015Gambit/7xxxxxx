,giffo5,2012-02-27T02:53Z,Thank you muchly !! 
,EdoSensei,2012-02-27T07:45Z,"Thanks!

But why are these HD files so slow? Obviously 4.33 gigs is going to take 5 times longer than a 850 gig SD version of a match but I've been downloading over 5 hours and still on 9.8%?! 

When it comes to sports events, I'd always go SD because by the time this finishes someone will mention the result or I'll accidentally see it somewhere!"
,auwkeung,2012-02-27T09:14Z,Thanks but why the ceremony part of it is missing? Can you put it up also?
,EdoSensei,2012-02-27T10:35Z,"Lucky you auwkeung! I'm still on 14.4% after 8 hours with a day left to finish, it estimates!"
