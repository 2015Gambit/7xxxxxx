I have a question. I have been trying watch the your Countdown shows on Roku via Rocksbox. The file format is fine, but when I play the file in Rocksbox, the file cuts out at the opening. I have used Handbrake to try and get it to work, but compressing it again causes the audio to be out of sync. 

Are there better setting in Handbrake I could use that would get the file to work? Is it possible to upload a less compressed MP4 version of Countdown?"

That segment was...
Topic: HBO movie ""Game Change,"" about Sarah Palin, with Julianne Moore
Guest: JC Coccoli, comedian

A complete version of that segment is available at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7054456"

FYI: I just successfully played this mp4 file on my Win7 machine with VLC, WMP, RealPlayer, and QuickTime."
