ALTERNATIVE EDITION V2 VERSION INFO:

ORIGINAL RUNTIME: 137/177 minutes (NTSC)
NEW RUNTIME: 183 minutes (NTSC)

Director David Lynch's strange and visionary sci-fi epic is given a new lease of
life with this unique fan-edit by Spicediver. Dune The Alternative Edition is a
painstakingly created new cut that draws on the Theatrical Version (1984), the
Extended Version (1988), various deleted scenes, and two versions of the
original soundtrack album. Presented in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby
Digital 2.0 stereo sound. The Revised Version 2 replaces V1 and features
additional changes and technical improvements.

INTENTIONS FOR THIS FANEDIT:

Both of the officially released versions of David Lynch's visually amazing
'Dune' have substantial problems. The Theatrical Version was gutted to the point
of incomprehension by executive producer Dino De Laurentiis in his quest to make
it a two hour movie instead of three. The easier-to-follow Extended Version
assembled for cable TV, with much restored footage, was so incompetently put
together by Universal's MCA TV division that Lynch ordered his name removed from
the writing and directing credits.

Broadly, my intention with the Alternative Edition is to improve storytelling
and flow by preserving the best elements from both official versions of the film
while also integrating some newly available deleted scenes.

The Alternative Edition does not claim to be a director's cut. It is also based
more on the Extended Version of Dune than several other fanedits doing the
rounds. In this and many other respects the Alternative Edition is a
significantly different take on the film. I have used Herbert's novel and the
6th and 7th drafts of Lynch's original script as a guide but have also taken my
own liberties with the material.

CHANGES/CUTS/ADDITIONS (including V.2):

1) MISTAKES. Many of the mistakes exclusive to the Extended Edition have been
removed or corrected ? such as atrocious editing, the TV censorship cuts, and
the silly repeated/fabricated footage used to set up or pad scenes.

2) COLOR CORRECTION. The 40 or so minutes of extra live footage hastily
reinserted into the Extended Version by Universal/MCA was never color graded and
suffers from color mismatches with the older Theatrical footage. In V.2
colour-correction has been applied to all shots, scenes and part-scenes where
the mismatches are clearly apparent, which amounts to about 80% of the extra
footage. However the missing "blue eyes" of the Fremen have still not been
restored - a massive rotoscoping job I chose not to undertake.

3) PROLOGUE. The painted-stills Prologue from the Extended Version has been
fixed to make it a more accurate and more helpful background to the Dune
universe. It has been shortened and reconfigured to avoid repetition, to avoid
giving away plot points, and to correct confusing mistakes. In V.2 the Prologue
has been moved to the very start of the film, before any credits and before
Reverend Mother Ramallo's introduction. In V.2 there are also slight changes to
the score and the shot selection.

4) NARRATION. The male narration from the Extended Version was chosen for this
edit and most of it has been preserved, while deleting or correcting occasional
voiceover mistakes or misuse by the producers. I have always found this
narration to be a more persuasive than Princess Irulan's voiceover from the
Theatrical Version. In V.2 the narration has been completely removed from one
scene where the Fremen watch House Atreides arrive on Arrakis.

5) MUSIC. The Extended Version of Dune assembled my Universal/MCA is badly
re-scored. It inexplicably omits Brian Eno's 'Prophecy Theme' and generally the
beautiful score by Toto is used far too often, too repetitively, and at times
very inappropriately (eg. action music in a quiet scene). V.1 addressed this
problem through restoring Eno's music and favouring scenes and sequences from
the Theatrical Version wherever possible. In V.2 the problem is further
addressed by the removal or re-scoring of the music in 6 more scenes.

6) SCENE ORDER. I have restored to their correct place a number of existing
scenes that appear in the wrong part of one or both versions of the movie (eg.
Duncan & Leto's reunion, the drowned baby worm ritual that produces the Water
Of Life).

7) INTERNAL DIALOGUE. This was used successfully by Herbert in his novel but I
believe it was a colossal mistake to adapt this device so literally to the
screen. Many viewers including myself found much of it infuriating. In V.1 a
handful of removals and edits were done to the internal dialogue, mostly in the
dream sequences. In V.2. I have removed or minimized another 14 instances, again
mostly without cutting any footage. Overall, the effect is a narrative that
gives less away and unfolds more naturally.

8) DELETED SCENES. Some - but not all - of the deleted scenes that appeared as
an Extras feature on the 2005 Universal Region 1 DVD release have been
integrated into the Alternative Edition. These are rough-looking compared to the
rest of the film rest but when edited back in these scenes restore plot points,
warmth and character. In V.2 I have also performed some basic color correction
on these scenes but the impact is limited given the poor condition of the
footage.

9) TRANSFER QUALITY. It was noticed after the completion of V.1 that the Region
1 DVD Extended Print is actually slightly crisper that the Region 1 DVD
Theatrical Print. Therefore in V.2 some Theatrical Version footage has been
replaced with identical footage from the Extended print, while retaining the
Theatrical Version's superior audio source.

10) OTHER V.2 CHANGES. Restored the destruction of the Weirding Modules;
restored establishing shots in several scenes; restored several shots of Paul's
filmbook slideshow; restored and fixed one of the filmbook voiceovers and its
accompanying shots.
