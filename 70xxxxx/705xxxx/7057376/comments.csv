,pornznz,2012-03-11T01:59Z,"FOR NOOBS LIKE ""Ellsee12345"" THAT COMMENT

Faulty torrent - DONT DOWNLOAD. Only one sample file to view and the rest are just sfv and r files.

If your going to comment make sure you have tried working out what youve downloaded.
.r files . . . are zipped files. . .download winrar or something, it aint hard to google file extensions

If people that thick then they should go buy the movie. . .. 

Nice up scene

,MeSeeder,2012-03-13T00:04Z,"yep, just f*cking annoying with all the formats. "
,icporn,2012-03-14T18:55Z,"Original BR protected by Cinavia so playback gets muted after 30 minutes on (at least) PS3. There could be a workaround, didn't have the time to solve it right now."
,Incredulous1,2012-03-17T10:32Z,"Rar files....movie is excellent ALL the way through, thanks a bunch
A/V 10"

,TheBeta,2012-03-25T07:47Z,"Thanks for the upload.  New to this "".r"" format, someone educate me on how to get this download to play.  I tried searching the internet without success (obviously).  Thanks."
,91cb-1,2012-03-26T22:34Z,"Likewise i had a problem looking at this on my PS3, none the less until that point A 10 V 10. Thank you i will just have to watch this on my laptop.

,Rsniper2,2012-03-28T07:39Z,"V: 9/10
A: 8/10
Great quality and decent movie. If you're confused on how to work this, just open any of the TT .rar files and press the ""Extract To"" button at the top right (if you're using WinRAR) 
From there just pick a destination and wait until the extraction is complete...it may take a few minutes"
,Maka91,2012-04-04T05:05Z,"Take the TT.rar file from the download and extract it to your destination. Let that complete, and it will be done. Takes a minute, but otherwise A/V 10."
,sebatron,2012-04-14T11:11Z,"At 11% my access was denied, will not even download, in 5 years of using this site have never had this problem before. Do not down load is my opinion!"
,tarnze,2012-05-02T06:48Z,"v10 a10, & thanks to rsniper2,used your directions and finally got it to play."
,Sinsults,2012-08-04T21:57Z,"I love how people are insulting the torrent when they are the ones that can't even turn on their computer without getting a virus.
Basically, if everyone else is saying the torrent is fine, and you're the only one having problems with it, then the problem isn't the torrent.
The problem is: You're a moron."
