Conceptual improvements/advancements of edit over original:

This edit attempts to reconstruct David Lynchâ€™s workprint better than the
official Extended Edition. It removes most (if not all) of the offensive
elements that led Lynch to remove his name from the Extended Edition. Erroneous
FX shots are eliminated, and as much of the Theatrical Edition as possible is
used for the sake of better sound and score. It also restores most of the
deleted scenes that were not present in the Extended Edition but finally showed
up as a supplement on the DVD. These are noticibly lower in quality, hence why I
call this a "workprint" edition. They nonetheless add to the detailed, if
convoluted plot that Sci-Fi fans know and love. At any rate, while some of the
footage is sub-par in video quality, you donâ€™t find yourself taken out of the
moment when the wrong ship flys over the wrong planet in the middle of a scene,
as in the official Extended Edition.

I attempted to correct the missing Fremen eye colorations, but quickly realized
I was in over my head, so only two shots have been fixed (those alone took a
couple of hours rotoscoping by hand). Good luck spotting them! If anybody wishes
to improve this fan edit by fixing all of these eye shots, please do.

I left David Lynchâ€™s name in the credits, hoping this would not seem arrogant,
but instead a genuine tribute by a fan, in hopes that this more closely matches
the Extended Edition he would have created, if heâ€™d only been given the chance
back when he cared about the film. Mr. Lynch, if youâ€™re reading, we do love your
film, and will continue to wish for your true extended cut to see the light of
day.
