I had almost given up on a torrent release of this, and was ready to get it direct download.

this makes life easier on an otherwise annoying day."
,cindy25,2012-02-23T11:59Z,"just wondering if u can find this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleground_(TV_series)

supposedly from in North America"
[T],iamgreat,2012-02-23T17:33Z,"Cindy, 

I can do Canadian shows and i know where to get some Australian and Irish shows too. But the show Battleground is an original web series from Hulu and Hulu does not like non-Americans. The scene groups are likely to absolutely avoid it.  A DVD release might never happen since DVDs are the enemy of Hulu. IF you don't live in the USA it is really awkward-to-impossible to see Battleground. I suggest you pretend you never heard of the show and check back in six months or a year to see what happened.  I'll look for it now and then and maybe one day find it but keep your expectations very modest. "
,cindy25,2012-02-24T03:44Z,"thanks regarding battleground reply; I did not expect a scene release but I did expect someone in the USA to post it. same for Lilyhammer but at least Lilyhammer will be on BBC next month.

will you be able to post non-scene releases of USA and Canadian in avi if there is no scene release?

again, thanks for Doyle and Happy Endings

[T],iamgreat,2012-02-24T06:19Z,"Cindy,  one of the groups that is staying with xvid, 2HD, is the group that does most Canadian shows. TWG does CBC shows. My best guess would be that Canadian shows again will come hours later but will come eventually. I only do things i enjoy and only once it has been some time without a scene release. You won't find me releasing Little Mosque On The Prairie or Redemption Inc. and i don't get W in HD so i won't be releasing Undercover Boss Canada. 

As for non-scene US shows i wouldn't think there is much of an organisation for that, at least yet, since so far FQM and 2HD have covered everything that LOL and ASAP used to do.  FQM and 2HD are two of the groups that never rushed creation of releases in the past, unlike LOL and ASAP, so the pace people might have been used to will now be different. I don't have the means to record everything just in case a scene group doesn't release something. 

British shows is where it might require taking the 720p release and encoding that to xvid in order to have an xvid release. That is not exactly the ideal/preferred/accepted way to do it but many British groups, such as BiA and TLA, have abandoned xvid. 

In other news Republic of Doyle, in one of the most competitive time slots of Wednesdays at 9pm, has been over 1 million viewers for each of the first six episodes of its third season :)  "
,cindy25,2012-02-24T08:45Z,"I am hoping someone posts Murdoch, which starts 2.28; there is also a new Australian series starting today, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, which looks promising. "
[T],iamgreat,2012-02-24T09:42Z,"Cindy, this is turning in to quite the conversation... i do happen to like Murdoch but with Rogers having sold the show to CBC there is not that much incentive at all to align broadcast with that of its British counterpart. Season 5 of Murdoch will be on ALIBI in 4 days but will be on Citytv some time in maybe 4 months. Season 6 of Murdoch will be on CBC in about 7 months and no idea when season 6 will be on ALIBI. 

The ALIBI-sourced releases come from a few people and are of some rather great variety of quality and codecs and containers and compatibilities. They are better than nothing. By the time the show is available on TV in Canada the British DVD release is usually available and some group has ripped it so capping the Citytv broadcast is mostly considered redundant. If you are ok with French then you can get Murdoch in 720p from scene group BAWLS. There is a repack of my release of Murdoch with Harper due to a very belated discovery of incorrect cropping of the initial release. Its out there as a ddl just because i don't know if there is demand sufficient to sustain a torrent. 

And in case you are thinking about it... i do NOT get the HD feed of APTN so i won't be able to cap season 2 of Blackstone until/unless it comes on Showcase. When we finally got Animal Planet in HD i thought it was APTN because in the guide it is listed as APHD. :)  

I don't live in Australia so i don't get ABC1 but i will certainly look for that series as i generally enjoy shows set in the 1920s."
,cindy25,2012-02-24T13:37Z,"found Miss Fisher on emp; amazed the others did not have it. there is always box for the British, although I hate having to use vuze 

today is the first time since last Nov I had to use a private torrent site-and had to 3 times. 

so much British next week, Indian doctor series 2, so I hope that is uploaded somewhere else. 

I didn't know where Murdoch was being broadcast, just saw it mentioned in a shoutbox"
[T],iamgreat,2012-02-25T09:26Z,"I did take the 720p of Kidnap And Ransom and make an xvid file if you are wanting that show. As for Miss Fisher i am still looking for a release from BWB or TASTETV.

Murdoch ripped from UK TV is often analogue and can have some serious variance in quality. Its a Canadian show but since s2 it has premiered in the UK and been shown later domestically.  When s6 comes on CBC in September it will either be months before the UK showing or ALIBI will be moving the show to September too. 

If you are wanting Spartacus it isn't on for me until Sunday night. If you want to make any requests it would probably be better if you PMed me somewhere rather than continuing this in comments that are not really so much about Republic Of Doyle. "
