Someone in the UK should really take it upon themselves to get the episodes off the 4oD website as soon as they're released. I would do it myself, but I can't seem to be able to find a proxy that will allow me access."

,TauraCasanove,2012-02-23T01:29Z,"Damn it, double post... Sorry about that :/"
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2012-02-23T03:20Z,Many thanks
,PW5,2012-02-23T03:29Z,"Thanks so much for posting this. 
Am a huge Skins fan & have been waiting for this season, but then the episodes never come online :(
I'm still missing eps 6.02 & 6.03, the only versions that seem to be out there are huge files or tiny ones and they are all .mkv, which my media player does not play. What happened to .avi???"
,davidsask,2012-02-23T05:00Z,"Thnks, I have to wonder why Skins UK is getting the shaft when it comes to torrents or even streaming etc... It always use to get love from eztv and TVTeam and now nothing? Thanks for posting as promptly as you have for us diehards not in UK!!! "
,jajaes,2012-02-23T05:41Z,"Thanks Releece! You seem to be the only person who consistently uploads skins anymore, many props!!"
,cupkait,2012-02-23T15:42Z,"I registered here just so I could comment and reiterate the appreciation that you've already been shown. I was able to watch the first two episodes of this season the day after they aired... the last few I've had to wait/search for, which is no fun. I really hope you continue to keep us up-to-date with the remaining episodes this season :)"
,Releece,2012-02-24T14:53Z,Thanks everyone! It means a lot knowing that I'm helping others with the same problem as me. I will do my best to keep uploading the torrents as long as this situatioun is going to last :)
,Snadoosh,2012-02-24T23:02Z,Yep - thanks for stepping up!
,jajaes,2012-02-28T00:05Z,"Thanks releece. Your only one who seems to consistently upload skins now, props"
