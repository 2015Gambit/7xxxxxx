Virtual desktop managers have become very popular on most operating systems, for users who want to keep multiple projects open at once. Crystal Desktop makes grouping open applications more convenient for the user: one virtual desktop can hold web browser windows, another virtual desktop a music player, and another one a movie. You can switch between the desktops with a mouse click or keystroke (customizable for each virtual desktop).
