Bail Enforcers (orginal title)

Plot: A group of bounty hunters face a moral dilemma in this action feature from director Patrick McBrearty. Struggling bail bondsmen Jules (Trish Stratus), Ridley (Frank J. Zupancic) and Chase (Boomer Phillips) think theyÃ¢Â€â„¢ve struck gold when they apprehend an informant with a $100,000 bounty on his head. Things soon get complicated, however, when theyÃ¢Â€â„¢re offered $1,000,000 to hand over their prisoner to the mob. When they subsequently refuse to play ball, the hunters become the hunted, as a trio of deadly mafia hitmen are dispatched to bring back the informant â€“ dead or alive.
