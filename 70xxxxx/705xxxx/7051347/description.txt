Release  Notes

x264 lowres is dumb. Losing a lot of standalone
compatibility for slightly higher quality when there's
already even better quality is pointless, and whoever
decided on MP4 is a moron because partial files can't be
played back. Sucks if you want to start watching while
still downloading. XvidAVI for life
