This is NOT a Supreme Commander or Forged Alliance gamerip or crack or any of that jazz. This torrent is merely a part of an ongoing effort to consolidate some of the SupCom stuff floating around on the internet.
Included are some files which facilitate Steam and non-Steam versions of the game to play together (i.e., the FAF Lobby program), as they technically run different versions of the game.
In addition to the FAF Lobby program (developed and maintained by the Forged Alliance Forever community (http://www.faforever.com), there are also 3 map-packs included, the big one (~1.5 GB) is also from FAF.
Hope this proves useful!
