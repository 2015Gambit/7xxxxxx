Not all Super NES sequels lived up to the standards set by their NES predecessors, but there are some exceptions that excelled above and beyond. Take, for one, Equinox - The much-improved sequel to the NES game, Solstice. Although Solstice was an intriguing concept, I felt it was executed poorly. However, Equinox proves that the same basic concept, when done correctly, can result in a rewarding game experience.
