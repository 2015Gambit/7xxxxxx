,rabbit42,2012-02-23T03:56Z,not a stand alone friendly format though :(
,superfunkicalifragisexy,2012-02-23T12:36Z,"a shame that they are ditching avi, much more flexible and play anywhere than mp4. thanks for all the excellent work, though, i am sure others will just provide the avi files going forward."
