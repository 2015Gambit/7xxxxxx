[V],Nepotu,2012-02-25T13:55Z,well! Still exist Chicago. I don't know. I think you are right.
,jmbsc,2012-02-25T16:31Z,"for sure, Chicago is a dominant force in nba at the moment - derrick rose is an amazing basket-ball player. but i still think that Lebron (even if he is sometimes a bit annoying) deserves to win at least one championship... Shit, west ham have just drawn against c. palace... hope southampton loose or draw- take care mate!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-26T02:08Z,Yeah! This is with the small teams. You have to suffer much more. Sorry for your WHU!
,MoviesR101,2012-02-26T13:37Z,"Thanks for the up!

It is Miami Heats Championship to win or lose? How bad does Lebron want it? He has to prove himself in the NBA Finals!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-27T12:00Z,"FINALS, yeah! Welcome, MoviesR101!"
