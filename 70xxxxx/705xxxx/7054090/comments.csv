,deckard45,2012-02-26T19:23Z,"Can I ask why this has been put into rar format? The rar file size is the same as the original mkv file, so whats the point of ""compressing"" it (or not) into a rar file? I've noticed more and more tv shows being posted in rar files. Its just a massive pain in the arse when you've got 5 tv shows that all need to be uncompressed and all a take about 3 and a half minutes each. I just can't see the point, so I'm asking is there one that i'm not aware of?"
,iamhelix,2012-03-05T11:28Z,"what is with everyones hatred of rar files on TPB? Are you all too retarded to open them or something? Fuck a few years ago when we had to wait for downloads you same bitches were bitching about files NOT being rar'd ! 

he probably gets the files from the scene in RAR format becasue they are from ftp or etc and just uploads as is, if you don't like it don't download it."
,deckard45,2012-03-06T03:17Z,"@ iamhelix Too retarded to open them? Its not fucking rocket science. If you read my comment properly you will see that my problem is that they take time to open, not that I couldn't open them. Good answer though,  ""if you don't like it don't download it"", very imaginative, not seen that before on here. By the way, I don't hate rar files when they are used to do their job which is making files smaller or splitting them up to make them more convenient to download from news groups, I do hate them when idiots rar files up with absolutley no compression, ie. video file same size as rar files. Fucking pointless. And please dont quote the other over used line  ""at least he is posting"" because if he didn't somebody else would, and maybe they would un-rar the fucking thing first. Now I wait for the reply where you swear at me lots blah blah blah........"

And yes, it's actually a little daft to complain about the hassle or time of uncompressing, seeing as chances are you don't even have to. Just drag the RAR file on your VLC or MPlayer."
