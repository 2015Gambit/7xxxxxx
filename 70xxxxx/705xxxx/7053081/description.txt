This is a collection of video\'s from my YouTube channel.
I have been self-studying for a few years in various aspects of video/motion graphics.
The videos are very amateur. They are a mix of music, comedy and other stuff.
All filmed in my hometown Borehamwood, U.K.
They are best enjoyed with a bottle of red wine and a couple of spliffs.
The video quality is better on YouTube (HD button).
This is an iso file that can easily be burned to disc (DUAL LAYER DVD+R) with ImgBurn (or your favourite burning software) to make a DVD disc to play in DVD players (although only tested on mine, i hope it works, let me know).
This is my first ever upload, so forgive me if i have broken any rules.
Enjoy...
