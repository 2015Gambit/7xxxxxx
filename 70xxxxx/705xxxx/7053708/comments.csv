,donser,2012-03-02T06:47Z,"Be careful! I guess there's a hidden virus attached to the crack. It's not detected to some of Antivirus softwares because it is packed (encrypted file). 

When I activate the patch, IDM works very fine. But the shutdown and Turn-on welcome screen, will become a full white screen, and you'll see a pop-up dialog box that will only show for a millisecond.

This is a new virus that is not yet discovered by most of antivirus companies. I am very sure of that because this day, I only downloaded 1 file, which means, this torrent. The virus is attached to the patch file. Be carefuL!"
