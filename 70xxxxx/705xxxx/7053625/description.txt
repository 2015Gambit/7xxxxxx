Thomas grew up on a farm in Mississippi and played in juke joints and barrelhouses before he began recording in the late '60s. He appeared in the films Delta Blues Singer: James "Sonny Ford" Thomas in 1970 and Give My Poor Heart Ease: Mississippi Delta Bluesmen in 1975, plus the short Mississippi Delta Blues in 1974. Thomas also made festival appearances in the '70s and '80s. He recorded for Transatlantic, Matchbox, Southern Folklore and regional labels in the '60s,'70s and '80s.
