You totally rock!!"
,Setheral,2012-02-24T01:39Z,"The never-ending honeymoon set will not install for me. It loads into the launcher but when I try to install it, it fails and tells me to update my game and try again; however, it is already fully updated.

Other than that, everything else worked fine. Thank you!"
,UniversalSoldier1911,2012-02-24T07:15Z,Thanks a lot..
,googleLT,2012-02-24T07:25Z,"Tree of Prosperity , this tree for me not working why? i cant pick up the fruit"
,googleLT,2012-02-24T07:27Z,where to add this tree fix?
,googleLT,2012-02-24T07:54Z,"admz0r working now , big thanks for the fix , you really rock :)"
,admz0r,2012-02-24T08:50Z,"@Setheral I dunno, it worked for me. The problem is in your machine, I'd suggest to reinstall the whole sims, but it takes ages. :D"
,Tarkus1975,2012-02-24T21:12Z,"TheMagicSet doesnt seem to work, cant find any of the other sets either in game.....and when i put in Tree of Prosperity (Fix) then non of your downloads are working anymore. (january set's)"
,emilio_user,2012-02-25T09:42Z,"here is the way to install the fix

,JojoWKM,2012-02-26T00:17Z,"Is there any way you could upload these in .package-files as you did in you previous uploads? Sometimes I too have problems installing Sims3pack-files, the game tells me that I need to update my game, which is complete nonsense. I think .package-files would help a lot!"
,Yatios,2012-02-26T00:48Z,Thanks a lot for this torrent. Everything is working fine and also thanks for the fix for the tree of prosperity.
,missyrocks18,2012-02-26T14:45Z,Thank you thank you! It works beautifully for me so far...:-)
,exiledred,2012-02-26T15:29Z,"Hi admzor.
Great torrent you really do have nice uploads. but the neverending honeymoonset isnt working for me i cant install it and when i make .package files of it nothing shows up in game i have all expansions and latest patch so have no clue even tried to reinstall the entire game no luck so far. btw i use the fix from games4theworld dont know if that has anything to do with that"
,kittieali,2012-02-27T20:42Z,I also can't install the Honeymoon set.
,admz0r,2012-02-27T21:46Z,"@Tarkus1975: yay kn00b!

guys I dunno what's wrong with your Honeymoon Set, for me, and for the rest of us, it's working. I dunno what's the problem :S"
,admz0r,2012-02-27T21:58Z,"@JojoWKM: Many of you requested that, I should upload in .package form. I'll upload in .package the January and the February update a bit later, and I'll upload the next months in both .sim3pack and .package! :)"
,Sunnaie,2012-02-28T05:21Z,"for some reason ""NeverEndingHMset"" wont install for me, saying my game isnt fully patched which doesnt make sense because i have legit copies of sims 3 upto pets...but everything else works perfect."
