,ProphetZarquon,2012-06-25T06:08Z,"Well, this *was* the whole Season 1, until March 24th 2012, when Episode 14 - New Alliances aired.  The full Season 1, Books 1, 2 & 3 has now aired as of June 16th 2012.

Book 1 and Book 2 DVDs are now available.  Each contains 8 episodes from Season 1 of the series.

The series is currently on hiatus, but Cartoon Network denies any rumors of cancellation, saying only that the show will be back for a second season.

The original show had 65 episodes each in two seasons, so there should be plenty more fodder for the writers to whack around with.  Frankly I wouldn't be suprised if they call the next episode Season 1 Episode 27...

In short, this torrent does NOT contain the full Season 1.
