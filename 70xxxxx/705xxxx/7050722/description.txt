This is the soundtrack for the 2005 TNT epic mini-series Into The West,composed by Geoff Zanelli.This score is very rare and not sold in stores,but I was lucky enough to receive one from a friend when the movie came out,his uncle worked for TNT network.These soundtracks were only released in special press release promo kits to studios and promoters.I claim first credit as being the first person to upload this soundtrack onto this site,the first and original!I ripped this from the CD in Mp3 format with a bit rate of 128 Kbps,for use in my iPod.The sound quality is great,so if you complain about the lower bit rate,then that's your problem.This is also my very first upload,so please take it easy on me if you spot any mistakes.Please seed,and enjoy!
