Classical MASH

A purely subjective and arbitrary collection of classical music that I am listening to right now. Some of the most recognizable tunes from the baroque and classical eras (once again in my opinion). Its like a Classical Music 101 or Classical Music Best Of Compilation.

Copyright (Thoughts , SKIP IF YOU JUST WANT THE SONGS)

Instead of having CD's in cases and on shelves collecting dust why not share them with people that will listen to them. Isn't this the modern version of lending a CD to your friend but amplified to a world wide level. More CD's more friends. Especially for old classic songs , this is more like a database of music. The person downloading might not have bought it anyway , but now has the chance to listen to it. The compilation was made partly from my own rips and downloaded mp3's. By an assortment of performers , the important thing is the songs! Enjoy!
