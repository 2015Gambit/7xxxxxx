,dafuka,2012-02-27T19:10Z,@wallmartysec. Sadly enough many people's level of consciousness is still below that of cows' as your comments prove. Go troll somewhere else.

And surprisingly, all that makes you people feel 'superior'... Talk of distorted perceptions..."

Thanks for the books dafuka. I for one will keep an open mind while reading them. "
