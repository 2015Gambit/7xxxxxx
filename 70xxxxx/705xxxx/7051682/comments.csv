,Tess-Ann86,2012-02-23T09:50Z,DONT WORK NO VIDEO ONLY SOUND
,Tess-Ann86,2012-02-23T09:58Z,why is this not working???
[V],psspss,2012-02-23T10:15Z,"did you try VLC player.. its the only one to use
on windows/pc

videolan.org

all codecs are built-in and its superfast coding used"
[V],psspss,2012-02-23T10:17Z,"hey tne.. did you watch the pyramid code
some of its new and interesting to what heard before
with ancient aliens and alike.. you might like it..

also have you heard of a new paranormal show
called R.I.P.?

i dont know what happened to home investigators
show the guy in canada vanished.. perhaps his
misses told him off heeh"
,Tess-Ann86,2012-02-23T10:22Z,sorry my bad was using a different player
[V],psspss,2012-02-23T11:18Z,"well actually not sure why but my vlc has major problems scrolling  too and even avidemux
didnt like it much.. 

anyhow I have it almost converted to xvid
will up soon :()"
[T],trialNerror,2012-02-23T12:02Z,"KMP is probably a little better than VLC.
Better interface and controls.
Built-in codecs as well like VLC.

It's always good to have a couple different media players.

@ pss - funny Avidemux gave you problems when it was made into mp4 using Avidemux.
For kicks n giggles I dropped the mp4 into Avidemux to see if there were any issues and on this end nope not having any. Converting to XviD just fine.

I hate when shit works perfectly on my desktop but it won't work for shit on other people's systems.  I don't have anything special installed. A couple media players (KMP and VLC) and K-Lite (for codecs to encode with plus MPC). That's it."
[V],psspss,2012-02-23T12:09Z,"well im not sure.. seems to have missing frames
and hence loosing audio sync and gets worse half way through.. is anyone else having
issues with this rip?"
[V],psspss,2012-02-23T12:11Z,"ive tried 4 converters now and all have problems
with audio

avidemux 2.5.6 latest crashes if dont use safe mode"
,peachpuppy,2012-02-23T16:26Z,Awww yeah! Thanks dude :)
[V],psspss,2012-02-23T17:18Z,"OK it plays fine in vlc 2.1 as long as dont fast forward it..

it hangs my i7 but comes back ok... i really hate mp4s :)

ive managed to convert it to nice xvid and will upload soon"
[V],malestrom_HH,2012-03-21T14:58Z,"Thank you for providing these but mp4 are unwatchable.MPC,WMP,VLC basically all players cannot play this without problems.Yes if you don't Fast Forward it.If you do then you get 90-100% CPU usage and crashes.I'd like to ask then why does anybody upload mp4 video files?"
,Giobemo,2012-04-02T13:26Z,"Strange, I have the opposite problem as Tess-Ann86: video without sound"
