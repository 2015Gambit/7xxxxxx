,RickeeBoy,2012-03-21T23:15Z,From those around the world that absolutely love NASCAR ... Many thanks Hard2Find - all your efforts will be appreciated ( although loads of fuckers never say so) If you can a race down to 1Gb or less this would be brilliant. ( Us foreign folks have allocations and low speed ) Brill - Thanks Man.
,RickeeBoy,2012-03-21T23:17Z,PS - If we still get 3 hrs then 2gb is friggin superb.
