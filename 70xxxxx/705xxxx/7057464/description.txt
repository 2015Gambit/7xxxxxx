- ARTIST
John Mellencamp  (born October 7, 1951 in Seymour, Indiana, U.S.), previously known by the stage names Johnny Cougar, John Cougar, and John Cougar Mellencamp, is an American rock singer-songwriter, musician, painter and occasional actor known for his catchy, populist brand of heartland rock that eschews synthesizers and other artificial sounds in favor of acoustic instrumentation. 
He has sold over 40 million albums worldwide, has amassed 22 Top 40 hits in the United States and has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning one. 
Mellencamp is also one of the founding members of Farm Aid, an organization that began in 1985 with a concert in Champaign, Illinois to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. The Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 26 years, and as of 2012 the organization has raised over $39 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture.
Mellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.
Band members (classic lineup):  Kenny Aronoff on drums and percussion, Larry Crane and Mike Wanchic on guitars, Toby Myers on bass, John Cascella on keyboards and Lisa Germano on fiddle.
