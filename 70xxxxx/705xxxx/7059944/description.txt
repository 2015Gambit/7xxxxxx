NOTES:
Okay so, since the source had black borders & was encoded using mpeg codec, we decided to change that :-)
So, codec is now XviD. No black borders, so cropped and resized. Final size 700,4mb. Yeah, maybe it`s 
not enought for 2h movie, but at least you can dl it fast. And yes it`s watchable.
No subs for non-english parts, they`ll problably come out in 1-2 days
