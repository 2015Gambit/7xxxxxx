Ona Zee and Joey Silvera are dreaming. They're dreaming that they're dreaming. I was dreaming that this video made sense. There's talk about global overpopulation plus gloom and doom. It seems to be a return to the "Nunzio" tapes from a year ago. Joey dreams up an anal encounter with Melanie Moore, the current queen of rear entry; Ona babbles on about the population of China before getting plugged by Marc Wallice in her reverie; Carolyn Monroe (looking terrific) visits Joey's fantasies in a really hot encounter. This is the overall tone of the feature: good sex scenes punctuated by interludes of pseudo-intellectual yakking. A knock-out picture of Carolyn on the boxcover can't help but increase sales.
