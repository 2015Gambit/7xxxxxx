,Bazillin,2012-02-25T05:55Z,"just so ppl know this is not the right episode.. it is  ""Nightsisters"" from season 3 episode 12... so unless you missed it dont bother d/loading this one....  first bad one from eztv i've gotten so no biggie.. i can forgive  :)"
,shawnaldo,2012-02-25T06:58Z,"Thanks EZ, 

Bazillin is wrong, this episode is the right episode. It's the continuation of the Asajj Ventriss-Nightsisters storyline. Great episodes!!!

Good qaulity, fast DL as usual. EZ never fails!"
,titanmatrix,2012-02-25T07:06Z,This isn't Nightsisters.  This is Massacre.  That guy apparently didn't pay attention to Savage being in the newsreel...
