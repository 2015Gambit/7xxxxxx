,ssrinivas,2012-05-01T01:41Z,"Rating: 9.5/10

---The good---
= Free!!
= No loss in content. There are no missing or repeated pages.

---Possible Improvements---
= Formatting. While this is my personal, subjective and VERY biased opinion, I prefer the original formatting of the books. It adds to the tecno-dystopian mood of the story.
= Minor scanning errors. There is an error in the first chapter of the first book itself. (I le hates me, instead of ""It hates me.)

Download!"
,Jay_Rey,2012-05-04T13:42Z,password for pdf please?
,coop02,2012-05-22T00:22Z,"Great torrent, thanks a lot. Don't believe the few trying to claim that these PDF's have a password, they do not, and are only trying to ruin a good torrent. The errors are minimal - a very nice torrent indeed."
,grantenier,2012-05-23T21:33Z,thanks for the seed :D works great
,grantenier,2012-05-23T21:34Z,jayrey if you need a password for the pdf then your not doing something right get the adobe torrent.
,racha96,2012-05-24T10:09Z,"For those asking for the password, it's ""simbooks"" without the quotes. I needed the password as well to bookmark the pages but I couldn't because it was secured. I just guessed the password, and it was unlocked :)

Anyways, excellent torrent, downloaded super fast! Although for me, several phrases of text are a little messed up, but they don't interfere with my reading.

10/10, EXCELLENT Torrent & Series."

,53R4,2012-06-19T05:05Z,"I'm here, sir."
,Slangerb,2012-07-08T13:16Z,"I'm loving the first book, although there are a few comical spelling errors."
,Slangerb,2012-07-18T06:33Z,"Just wanted to add that I bought the second and third books, due to how much I liked the first."
,thirteen37,2012-08-09T09:58Z,Just watched The Hunger Games today. Great movie IMO. Thanks for the UL simbooks. I appreciate it.
