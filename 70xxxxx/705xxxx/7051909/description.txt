            This should speak for itself but I'll do a little               
            explaining to clear any confusion up. The source is             
            the retail R2 DVD which is only being made available            
            in Japan. It's is a few minutes longer than the                 
            retail versions other places around the globe and in            
            addition it is uncensored. For example the tea room             
            scene doesn't switch to black and white like in                 
            other versions so you can enjoy all the blood and               
            gore in full color :)                                           
                                                                            
            Also the AR for the DVD was 2.5 as you can tell from            
            the sample, now y'all can go see volume 2 in peace :)
