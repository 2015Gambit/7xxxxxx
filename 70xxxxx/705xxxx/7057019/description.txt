Game Notes

Turn the starter key on your own delivery business with Delivery Truck
Simulator. Carry your cargo of parcels and packages across the city as you
strive to become king of the couriers

As your business expands, so will your fleet with the option to purchase
from a selection of even larger vehicles, culminating in your own small
truck, each realised in full 3D complete with a fully drivable cab view

Time is your greatest adversary as you work against the clock to deliver a
wide range of goods before the deadline expires. The choice of route across
the massive city is yours, but beware of becoming a road hog as speeding
will incur a fine if you are caught by the long arm of the law!

Choose the location of your delivery depot to maximise your profits. Will
you buy your own refuelling pump or maintenance facilities or will you buy
your fuel on the road and cross your fingers that you don't suffer an
expensive breakdown?

Only skilled drivers with a head for business will prevail and be punctual
with their parcels, turning packages into profit!
