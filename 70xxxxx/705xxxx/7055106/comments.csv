,METALZero2,2012-03-16T21:24Z,this is NOT the hole book. It's the 1/4 of the book.
,urretado,2012-07-27T05:33Z,"48 (bad quality) pages of the book, a lot of random/stupid stuff as well

Don't waste your time on this one"
,Betasilverback,2012-09-13T19:38Z,"This is crap.
It skips dozens of pages several times, just when it's about to get good.
Anyone have more than half the book??"
