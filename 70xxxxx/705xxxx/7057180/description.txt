There\'s lots of talk about how the FFVII soundtrack was so good, but only the PS version\'s OST is ever uploaded anywhere.

This is theYamaha-exclusive PC version of the soundtrack. Every time I see the PC soundtrack mentioned, everyone says it sounds like shit, but that\'s just because they didn\'t own the card it was designed for.

This was recorded using the proper hardware, the Yamaha DB50XG.
