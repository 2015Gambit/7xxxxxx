Find out the card by smelling your iPhone with your magic nose!

Magic Nose is an incredible and powerful trick that anyone can master and amaze his friends and family.

With your face turned, first ask your audience to randomly choose a card. The audience could first change the deck of cards if he wishes to. Then ask him to memorize and shuffle the deck. When the shuffle is done, turn around and use your magic nose to smell the cards one by one, and then you can point out the card correctly.

Then it's time to enjoy their surprised reaction like oohs and aahs, and you could proudly tell them that you have a super magic nose. XD

Though the trick is simple if you have seen the secret, it is not easy for spectators to figure it out.
