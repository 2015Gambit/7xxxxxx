Note: First off, this wont be for everyone. Video is over cropped with a few areas missing.
First six minutes arent there and another 2 minutes missing at 36:28.
Source was slanted and had a stobbing greenish tint to it as well as some 3D effect from time to time.
Cleaned the video up as best as possible and fixed the angle. Audio is nice, fully synced and COMPLETE THRU TO THE END.

Workaround: Video has been Tweaked with the RGB colors best as I could, Added Some Filters, Denoise, Sharpness,Contrast,Brightness, Deform on the movie screen the oposite side of the camera capture, audio boosted and thats all folks!  

Is not something very impressed but have the time to play with some filters :)

I did my best the rest is yours :D
