Fireball is an album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in 1971. It was their fifth studio album 
and the second with the classic Mk II lineup. It was recorded at various times between September 1970 and 
June 1971. It would become the first of the band's three UK #1 albums, though it didn't stay on the charts 
as long as its predecessor, In Rock.

The original UK version had "Demon's Eye" as its third track, but did not include "Strange Kind of Woman" 
which was instead released as a single there. It was vice-versa on the American and Japanese releases.

The boogie-inspired "Strange Kind of Woman" single reached #8 in the UK. This song became a staple of the 
live set up to the present day, and "Fireball" has also made a few appearances, mainly as an encore. 
"Strange Kind of Woman" and "The Mule" appear on the 1972 live album Made in Japan, with the latter morphing 
into an Ian Paice drum solo.
