,exordium1,2012-03-04T00:19Z,"Thank you, works great."
,KM49,2012-03-06T00:19Z,Didn't work for me. I downloaded to flash drive and when i tried to open it brought up an error. I'm not seeding.
,0R74ND0,2012-03-08T02:49Z,"@KM49 I am really sorry for your issues and if I can get more information on the problem. Does the blue splash appear before the error message?-(The cover picture for the torrent) Can it be you are running out of memory?-(It creates the program files in the temporary folder until it closes) and it is possible that your computer can't run it?-(I found out that it cannot run on some computers so they need an older version like CS4 or CS3) And again I'm really sorry for your inconvenience.

,ercan,2012-04-28T14:21Z,"Thanks for torrent, but is this version like the full version of photoshop cs5? Do you have all options and do the option work like the full version?"
,0R74ND0,2012-05-06T22:22Z,@ercan Yes. This will work completely like the full version. If you are questioning the file size then it's because it's compressed and when opened it extracts the files to the %TEMP% folder.
