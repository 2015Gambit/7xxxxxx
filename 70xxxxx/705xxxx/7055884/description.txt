We are short movie authors and producers, currently finishing our last grade at Media college in the Czech Republic.
We would like to promote our latest VFX movie called "Brick." We believe in new means of media distribution, that's why we release it under Creative Commons licence. Enjoy, criticize, comment, or give us a job!
