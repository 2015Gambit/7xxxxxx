,oshua,2012-04-18T08:47Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7026385/Avast__Internet_Security_registration_keys_-_Valid_through_2012_ 

. some are band some but a few are good to go "
,theKD,2012-04-18T18:48Z,"hmmm. i am yet to find one that is working as every time i insert a file, i get a notice like after about 2 hours.  "
,Kenton.B,2012-04-21T01:37Z,"Most of the keys are now invalid, search avast to find a new torrent (not mine, but it works)."
