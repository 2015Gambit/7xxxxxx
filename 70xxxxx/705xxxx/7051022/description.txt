Sorry for the movie being out of focus for about 20 seconds in the beginning of the movie, I had to open a bag of candy. The screeching sounds you hear are not from the movie, I was playing Angry Birds at the same time. I would also like to apologize for the shaking throughout the movie, my hands are not that steady. The reason it gets a little bit more shaky near the end is because I needed to pee real bad, it all worked out in the end.
