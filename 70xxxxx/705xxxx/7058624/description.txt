Downton Abbey is a television series, coproduced by Carnival Films in the UK and WGBH Boston in the US. The series is set on the fictional estate of Downton Abbey in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and features an ensemble cast. It was created and principally written by actor and writer Julian Fellowes, and premiÃ¨red on ITV on 26 September 2010 and on PBS on January 9, 2011.

Reception of the programme was predominantly positive; ratings were extremely high for what is usually considered a "period" show, and the first series picked up a number of awards and nominations after its initial run. It has subsequently become the most successful British costume drama since the 1981 television serial version of Brideshead Revisited, and in 2011 it entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the "most critically acclaimed English-language television show" for the year, becoming the first co-produced US/British show to be so recognised by the Guinness Book of Records.

The second series aired in autumn 2011 on ITV and on January. On 3 November 2011, ITV confirmed that a third series had been commissioned. The third series is currently in production for broadcast later in 2012 on ITV and in January 2013 on PBS.
