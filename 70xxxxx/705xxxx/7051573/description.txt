\\\"God is you, the player, in the world of ActRaiser, and the tale begins with your awakening from a sleep of thousands of years, only to find that the land below has been taken over by evil forces. Now, surveying the continents from your floating palace in the sky, you\\\'ll have to locate scattered sources of monster infestation and descend from the clouds in human form, entering into side-scrolling action/platformer stages to take up your sword against the legions of The Evil One.\\\"
