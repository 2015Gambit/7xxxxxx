,ASkyNinja,2012-02-29T00:43Z,"Download the Host file patcher at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7064808/Adobe_Master_Collection_CS5_Host_File_Patcher[ASkyNinja] and run it after installing, but before running the activator. If you have already ran the activator, run this, and then run the activator again..."
,subuthu56,2012-03-03T14:55Z,"Installed the software and ran the patch- I put the amitlib.dll file in every program directory. Still can't run Indesign, tried running the patch again and then running activation again- when I run Indesign it says software is not properly licensed and shuts down--- Also looks like Acrobat didn't install -it is nowhere to be found. Any suggestions? Please advise."
,realpolorider,2012-03-04T20:25Z,"Hey ASkyNinja, Illustrator crashes within 2 seconds after opening it everytime. I got the InDesign fix, thanks! Do you think you can fix the Illustrator crash as well?"

,v3ct0r456,2012-03-10T10:20Z,"Hey, just a quick question.  Ran the host file patcher, then the activation.  I ran the setup installing as trial since no key was given.  Now does this just stop the trial from expiring or did I miss something? As when I check the reg status it still says trial."
,realpolorider,2012-03-11T17:42Z,"Thanks ASkyNinja!

@subuthu56 - I downloaded the InDesign Fix from ASkyNinja to fix it."
,crackygirl,2012-08-07T16:40Z,"Hello, I'm still running the trial version each time I open an adobe software. I followed the instructions, I installed the trial version, then run everything EXCEPT I don't understant clearly what I need to copy and paste. You say ""adobe"" but what exactly? Could you make a tutorial on YouTube please? Have a nice day ;)"
