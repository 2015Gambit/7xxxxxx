
When Swedish drummer Martin Lopez (ex-OPETH, AMON AMARTH) joined forces with metal bassist extraordinaire Steve DiGiorgio (SADUS, TESTAMENT, DEATH, ICED EARTH), vocalist Joel EkelÃ¶f and guitarist Kim Platbarzdis in a brand new project called SOEN, it was obvious that this collaboration would not be just another name-dropping, substance-deprived â€œsuper projectâ€.
Martin Lopez has described the bandâ€™s music as â€œmelodic, heavy, intricate and different.â€ Even then, Lopez may be selling his band short. SOEN is, in a word, unique.
