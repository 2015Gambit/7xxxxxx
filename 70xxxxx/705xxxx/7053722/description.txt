The game, which I'll write today is Borderlands. The genre is Action RPG. The story begins on a bus to another planet where there are four characters, which must select who will play (I chose Brick). Then you put a stop where a small robot (cute, funky and even irritating) you enter in the game (an interesting feature of the game is that you can still scroll with up to 3 friends, and together perform all missions). You say, "So far nothing new" and you're right. Interestingly in this game is graphics. Engine-off is seen Unreal 3, but as a comic book (which to me seemed a bit ... not a place to imaki genre of game, but some of you might like them).
