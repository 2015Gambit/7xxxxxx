,SystemFolder,2012-02-23T01:46Z,It's a new torrent. WikiLeaks only released it 5 hours ago.
,jox9z,2012-02-23T07:39Z,what exactly is this?
,SystemFolder,2012-02-23T09:58Z,I have no idea what it is. All I know is that WikiLeaks asked for people to bittorrent this file. I actually downloaded the .torrent file from their server and uploaded it here so the hash would stay the same.
,SystemFolder,2012-02-23T10:54Z,I think I have a theory on what these files are all about. I think it's a backup that WikiLeaks needs to transfer to an off-site facility and they use bittorrent technology to give supporters the opportunity to help make the transfer go faster.

,thirdmolar,2012-02-24T03:29Z,"This is a WikiLeaks insurance file, the second released so far. It contains nothing but encrypted data.    

Based on the name of these releases, most people agree that this file contains ""insurance"" against any harm coming to WikiLeaks, its staff and its supporters. It likely contains a large amount of documents that detractors of WikiLeaks would prefer to see unpublished. In case of an attack, the key to decrypt this file would be released.  This would be a deterrent to anyone who would seek to try to stop the distribution of leaks, as a key is much easier to distribute than the documents themselves, which will now have already been distributed in encrypted form.    

This scheme only works if everyone downloads this document and keeps it in long-term storage. This task is up to you. Keep this file stored somewhere for as long as possible. You will know when it is no longer needed: after WikiLeaks releases 65 GB of leaks!    

Commentary: The size of this document is absolutely mind-boggling.  Is it really possible that WikiLeaks has 65GB of leaks in their pipeline?  "

,ctrlplusalt,2012-02-26T01:43Z,thirdmolar... i think it's possible that amount of data and even more...
,neodiem,2012-02-26T11:31Z,Will be seeding the entire day @ 100Mbit upload... come get em people :)
,SystemFolder,2012-02-27T04:26Z,I think only WikiLeaks knows the password.
,legofreak7377,2012-02-27T04:36Z,"The password is not to be known by anyone other than Assange himself, or a trusted follower... or you could run a word list program (with words that Assange has used in published works) and see if that works; it decrypted the last insurance file... so idk... but wow. 65 GB of data corporations/governments dont want you to have... i think ill take it! :)"
,legofreak7377,2012-02-27T04:45Z,seeeeeed!!!! lots of leechers but no progress. 0% is not cool. :(
,legofreak7377,2012-02-27T05:39Z,"down speed varies from 2kbs to 400kbs. its all good... but the password will probably be released when Wikileaks/Assange is shutdown and or killed, which will hopefully be never. Its the fear of whats in the encrypted file that keeps the corporations at bay. And dont be so selfish man. Just be glad there is a Wikileaks to give us all uncensored reporting/leaks. Take the file and dont delete it. EVER!"
,ethande,2012-03-16T05:31Z,How to decrypt this WikiLeaks Insurance file?
,kexet1245,2012-08-13T14:28Z,I'll download and keep seeding
,sm0kes,2012-08-13T18:00Z,its being downloaded from nowhere its dowloading at 200kps and no peers or seeders connected..... 
,sm0kes,2012-08-13T18:07Z,omg... my last comment dissapeared and this is still being misteariouslly downloaded ....
,taarna23,2012-08-13T22:04Z,"Best of luck keeping this alive! I can't help, I don't have the space for it. =("
,paprboy,2012-08-15T16:07Z,After 3 hours of downloading I will try to seed it for a while in order to speed up the download process. Hope that helps Wikileaks...
,Harakiri_,2012-08-19T21:46Z,I hope its a porn mag...
,Harakiri_,2012-08-19T21:47Z,decryption key is: 123456
,powerofthemonk,2012-08-25T23:54Z,"What I plan on doing is putting this file in a bunch of winrar partfiles, then dividing it equally on flash drives. That way if my computer gets destroyed I still have it."
,Deathspanka,2012-08-27T12:46Z,I'll allways support wikileaks!
