skrillex song jus leaked few hours ago 
his newest hit
Yay! New Skrilly track. This is a leak (presumably off his Voltage EP?), weâ€™ll just have to wait and see. Some of you might hate me for saying this, but itâ€™s much better than some of the tracks on Bangarang. Not that Bangarang was bad or anything, but it was kind of obvious he just wanted to finish off his contract with Big Beat Records, and saved some of his better tracks for future release on his own label. Itâ€™s definitely a leak/possible edit though, and will probably sound even more awesome when itâ€™s released. Check it out!

NOTE: i dont do single tracks or skrillex tracks, but this is so different then his usual stuff i had to up it

skrillex came back hard!!
jam this in ur car wit the bass up ppl gonna stare
