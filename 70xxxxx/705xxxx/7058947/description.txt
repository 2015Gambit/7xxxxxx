Description

Plot: Storytelling in all its forms is skewered in The Catechism Cataclysm. In this divinely bizarre and funny tale, wild characters infuse stories within stories until the lines between the Bible, Mark Twain, and campfire tales are hilariously blurred. Father Billy (Steve Little), an eccentric young priest, is forced to take asabbatical by his superiors when he is discovered telling inappropriate parables to his flock. Billy tracks down his high-school idol Robbie (Robert Longstreet), who begrudgingly agrees to a canoe trip. On the water, the two men reminisce about Billyâ€™s days as the keyboardist in a Christian band and Robbieâ€™s as a guitarist for a metal band. When night approaches, they realize they have lost their wayâ€“and thatâ€™s when things get weird.
