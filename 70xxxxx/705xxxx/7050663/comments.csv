Ignore the above statement if you don't have a problem activating it normally."

Man!!! I wrote an extra tutorial specially about this problem in the how to use guide!
I even commented here so you pay attention to that and you DIDN'T!!

Follow the tutorial and fix your problem.
Reading is a Virtue!"

Funciona bien para mi"
,b1grud,2012-02-26T09:56Z,"Apologies for the triple post.  It didn't seem to work first time and then they all appeared.

I now get the 21 day warning after a reboot.  Deleting the lic file cures this though...

Cheers."
[V],ChattChitto,2012-02-28T02:04Z,"@b1grud
Exactly! This is why i wrote this long boring tutorial inside the release! :)"
,b1grud,2012-02-28T07:00Z,"OK, cool.  I can live with that. :0)"
,methosb,2012-03-06T12:09Z,I can get the license applied and all fine but my problem is with AnyDVD calling home and finding the license is not valid. Have blocked every .exe in the Program Files directory for it but it is still managing to call home somehow. You can fix by re-deleting the files and applying the license as it says in the tutorial but it still calls home again eventually.
,thewoodishard,2012-03-27T23:04Z,"hi, i'm having problems with Avatar Extended Bluray, Anydvd keeps searching the disc and then i get an error Anydvd Exeption!, have tried another film and that starts loading the files onto the HD ok, i have watched the film and it plays fine, this version should be ok for ripping this film, any help appreciated."
