IF YOU'VE TRIED LESTER BROWN'S PLAN B 3.0, FOUND IT PROFOUNDLY PROMISING, BUT NEAR IMPENETRABLE, CONVOLUTED, CRYPTIC... ME TOO.  THIS MATERIAL IS THE RESULT OF 1000'S OF HOURS WORK TO DECRYPT, AND MAKE ACCESSIBLE, DIGESTIBLE AND MASTERABLE BROWN'S OTHERWISE SINGULARLY HOPEFUL, HELPFUL WORK.

PLAN B 3.0 IS FAR AND AWAY THE BEST ROAD MAP AWAY FROM ETERNAL, IRREVERSIBLE HELL ON EARTH WE'VE GOT.

Yes, Brown's written other books since.  However, 4.0 and World on Edge (see this PB Channel UnviolentPeaceMaker):
1. Confirm the science
2. Are watered down, cowardly, fragmented... compared to this Plan B 3.0.
