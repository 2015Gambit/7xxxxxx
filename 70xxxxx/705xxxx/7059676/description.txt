Number Two in this timely series for Saint Patrick's Day 2012.  These are new recordings, and some are even new songs.. wink wink... well this is Ireland after all and just remember USA, Country and Western owes a lot to The Scots, Irish and Romney (Gypsy) Folk Music of old Europe..  as you will clearly see in this series.

I am Scottish and Proud of it, but even though there is a Scot in every town or City I have ever visited (and trust me I am a World Traveller) I must hand it to the Irish American's who have not only put Irish Pubs all over the World, but given Saint Patrick a BIG HEAD START over Saint Andrew..  Awh Well the Scottish do have the best Whiskey and of that there is no doubt...

Oh and SORRY to upset the Irish,  I think our grass is greener, and our Mountain's Higher... and I could go on a wee bit more, BUT HECK this is about MUSIC and GOOD MUSIC at that, so enjoy Paddy's Day and if by chance you slip a track or two from this that would be GRAND....
