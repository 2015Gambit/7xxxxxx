I myself used the previous version (for tx 110) successfully particularly the ink waste pad counter. When this counter reads somewhere between 7000 to 7500 the printer will stop working so i used the resetter for tx 110.  I was able to use my printer with several resets till the mechanical parts of the printer reach its maximum usability.
