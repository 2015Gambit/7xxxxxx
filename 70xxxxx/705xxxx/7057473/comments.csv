,zoso5150,2012-02-26T13:01Z,Thanks!!!If you have got any Greek Metal/Rap with a female vocalist(heard them a lot on Greek radio last year)I would be grateful.I never found  who they were due to my lack of the Greek language.
,razorx1979,2012-03-08T05:30Z,"@zoso5150:  Maybe the band you are looking for is STAVENTO...but not sure if the have any metal song. But as u say you heard it on the radio a lot, i cant think of anyone else. Hope this helped...check also non rap bands like C-Real or MPLE."
