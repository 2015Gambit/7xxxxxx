Tales from the Palaces 
The Royal Palaces are the backdrop to a thousand years of British history and are preserved as unique historical monuments. The conservation of these monuments needs to be balanced with the necessity of a continual flow of curious visitors.
Narrated by Robert Lindsay, this DVD features an insight into the activity behind-the-scenes at The Banqueting House, Kensington Palace, Kew Palace, The Tower of London and Hampton Court. As well as the extensive work required to maintain these palaces and their artefacts, we glimpse the detective work it takes to discover and present long forgotten practices. We also learn the intricacies involved in creating the displays that detail real life events.


1)  Palaces and the Public 
How the Royal Palaces organisation deals with wear and tear, as cracks appear in the Chapel Royal and a special invention monitors dust.

2)  The Detectives 
Conservation teams at the palaces have to work out everything, from how Henry VIII's clock worked to the complexities of staging a Stuart banquet.

3)  Signs of Life 
Everywhere in the palaces there are signs left by the people who lived there - from witch marks in the attic of Kew to graffiti in the Tower.

4)  Sensitivities 
The palaces are owned by the Queen, and curators need to exercise tact when organising an exhibition, whether on Diana or George III.

5)  A Thing of the Past 
The palaces are full of beautifully crafted objects that wear out and need to be replaced - from bricks to dresses - and the details have to be perfect.

6)  Who Cares 
Where does the money come from to fund ambitious renovation projects like the Tudor chimney pots at Hampton Court?

7)  The Heritage Theme Park 
Might the desire to entertain visitors with ice skating and ghost stories lead the palaces away from their serious educational and curatorial purposes?

8)  The Secret Lives of the Palaces 
Inside the lesser-known departments of the palaces, where they perform such unusual tasks as freezing stuffed bears to preserve them.

9)  The Great Resource 
A look at some of the amazing treasures contained within the palaces, including a Rubens painting on the ceiling of the Banqueting House.

10)  The Future of the Past 
What does the future hold for the Royal Palaces and their conservation teams?
