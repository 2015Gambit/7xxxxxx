.In all seriousness, the two (yes just two) of you are not accomplishing whatever
it is you think you are. You're jsut getting your groups and your format banned
 everywhere with all the pointless dupes. A group of people representing well 
over half the tv pres (Sweden too!) got together and created a SD ruleset that 
includes US scripted TV. Soemthing that has never been done before, because of 
people acting just like you are. Stop killing the scene with your wholly unfounded
egoes and try to act like adults for once. Grow up, give some intelligent input,
   and help the scene, and yourselves, actually progress and grow, instead of
                         wallowing in the mirth.
