,ChillReb,2012-02-26T10:41Z,"Can't activate the App.... When I open the App it asks for the Buyers email to activate... The Keygen just has  symmetry//Core written in the email line... When I press save lic, it just says ""Registration details saved successfully""... If I put in an email address it does the same... If I try to activate with that email it says no user with that email on their server... Do I need the ""Buyers Email""? If so what is it?"
,AlbertMAC,2012-03-16T05:07Z,you have to change to exit the setup completely for mac pilot launch the keygen and change the drop down menu to macpilot 4 and then enter your email and so on with the installation
,ChillReb,2012-03-16T20:29Z,"@AlbertMac : Thanx, that did the trick... Secret is to open keygen and enter your emai address while app isn't open... Simple...."

,Delusid,2012-09-04T05:03Z,Cannot activate this version. Saved info with Keygen while app is both running and closed. Doesn't work.
