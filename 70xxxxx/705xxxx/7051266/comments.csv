,Guytsu,2012-03-04T04:22Z,"Does anyone know if there's a dvd5 version with the japanese (or english) language options cut, similar to how there was with Xenoblade? Normally the game is dual-layered and won't fit on a single dvd, but that one did. I'd love it if there was a similar iso of The Last Story "
,kaze_stb,2012-03-06T03:40Z,@Guytsu yea its here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7054015/The_Last_Story_UNDUB_[PAL] Japanese audio only but the game is in english
,Guytsu,2012-03-07T05:17Z,"@kaze_stb Thank you. I'll give it a try, though a lot of people seem to complain about many freezing issues. Some also say the size is still dvd9 size after the extraction and upon using wiiscrubber, it's still too large. Still, I'll try"

,HalloweenJack,2012-04-10T12:32Z,"Hey guys,
I have downloaded this and I'm trying to launch it on my old PAL TV using a HDD and Configuable USB loader.

The game tells me I need to configure the Wii for 480i or 480P and 60hz. 

They don't come up as an option in the menu.

Can it work somehow on my old TV?

Cheers"

Mine works with IOS249 base 56 on USB Loader GX. When it starts it says it needs a 60Mhz screen just change the game setting to force PAL60 and it works perfectly."
