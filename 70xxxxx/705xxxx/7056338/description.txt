Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with David Sarti on the Friday, February 24 edition of the Alex Jones Show. Sarti is the "doomsday prepper" from Tennessee who had his Second Amendment right stripped by the FBI after he was declared mentally defective for not following the medical advice of his doctor. Sartiâ€™s story underscores how people who have chosen to live "prepper" lifestyles are being targeted by authorities. 

Sheriff Richard Mack talks with Alex from the studio in Austin.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
