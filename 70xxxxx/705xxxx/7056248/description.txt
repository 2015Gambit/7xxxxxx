                 The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret
                              +++ HDTV (XviD/MP3) +++
                               The Complete Season 2


The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret is an American-British sitcom starring David Cross, Sharon Horgan, Blake Harrison, Will Arnett, and Spike Jonze.

The series follows an American, Todd Margaret, who takes a job running the London sales team for the energy drink Thunder Muscle. He has no experience with British culture, knows nothing about sales, and has only one employee, Dave.

Each episode begins with a scene of Margaret appearing in dire circumstancesâ€”in season one, he is a defendant in a British court, with a long list of charges against him being read; in season two, he is in what appears to be a North Korean nuclear missile base, being forced to press a launch buttonâ€”then flashes back to portray the events leading to his sad fate.
