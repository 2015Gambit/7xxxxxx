,davish123,2012-02-24T13:10Z,I'm the original uploader and am trying to seed but out and about with laptop on 3G atm so can't properly seed...I'll let others take over once I'm on a ratio of 3+. Hope this helps some people--I couldn't use the new MK2 vinyl and it was really bugging me. It works now.

I too have the MK2 vinyl. How did you get it to work?"
,davish123,2012-03-15T19:10Z,@croutonsalad....er well it just worked for me. If you can try swapping the cables around on your headshell

is that what you did? Because when I try to calibrate my timecodes both decks say ""low input"". I'm new to djing, and i havn't bought a mixer yet. maybe i should do that and everything will work..."
