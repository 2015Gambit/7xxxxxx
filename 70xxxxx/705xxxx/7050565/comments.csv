,BlueTak,2012-02-28T21:48Z,"tr108, your uploads look promising. Since HR is on a break, your files could be perfect for me (being an Apple fanboy like yourself), as I've been using YIFY recently instead. 

How do your files compare to HR's quality?"
[T],tr108,2012-02-28T23:26Z,"Thanks for the interest, BlueTak.

Not sure how to compare myself to HR except to say that I believe in smaller file sizes - and, by extension, lower bit rates - than he does. When I encode,  I believe in trimming all the fat - in other words, adjusting the bit rate to suit the material -  because a smaller file is always better.

I'm hesitant to compare visual quality on a numbers scale vs. what HR does, but I think my encodes are serviceable. :)"

[T],tr108,2012-03-10T17:20Z,"Thanks for the love, TomKowl. Subs are pretty important to me too, as I often watch late at night with the sound turned way down.

I'll try to throw up some movies when I can. Won't be a lot for the next few months, but 1 or 2 a week... hopefully. :)"
