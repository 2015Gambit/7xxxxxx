Once upon a time there was ONLY one show of two hours to capture, GBTV.  Now there is a 1 hour show of REAL NEWS, 30 minutes of Liberty Treehouse, Independence USA and B.S. of A.

So the efforts required by a working person is reaching the limit!

Thanks again to everyone who appreciates the efforts to bring the TRUTH LIVES HERE message to the world.  God Bless you wherever you live and work."
