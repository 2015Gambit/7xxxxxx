,ImSoJaded,2012-02-24T20:40Z,I share your sentiments: this is an overpriced POS excuse for a software application that supposed to help and not annoy translators. My family always knows when I use this crap: that's the only occasion they hear me swear.
,Dadaluma28,2012-02-28T16:31Z,This shit is way overpriced!
,transs,2012-03-10T09:26Z,"WOW! managed to create my own trial reset! 
anyone interested in making it an utility using a programming language please contact:

,regtemp,2012-03-13T11:22Z,Could you share the details about how to reset the trial? Thanks
,transs,2012-03-25T09:46Z,Forget it. The trial reset project is closed.
,transs,2012-03-27T06:24Z,At last I managed to break the licensing mechanism. This time SDL implemented a very smart protection system but not smart enough. I know in some days some one will break it too. My favorite CAT is Wordfast Pro but I have not able to make it work as expected. Anyone who would like to exchange a licensed copy of WordFast pro for a professional version of Trados 2011? Drop me an email to the previous mentioned email address.

,i-can-see-through-time,2012-04-16T18:11Z,"Yeah, great, like I am going to pay some money-grubbing fake pirate for a shitty program made by a money-grubbing multinational corporation. Jesus guys/girls, where have you left your morals?"
,zoroman76,2012-06-05T18:33Z,"Thanks, cat tool. Confirmed it works."
