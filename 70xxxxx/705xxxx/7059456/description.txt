Well what can I say.  I am Scottish, This is Irish - But the Scot's and the Irish share a common Celtic Heritage, Language, Custom and Folk Music which blurs the physical boundary of states.

This is the first part of a musical journey into modern Irish Music which I really hope will help your Paddy's Day show.

All the Series, as you have come to expect from myself, are tagged and good to go.  High quality music video's ready for import into YOUR VJ collection for playback on the 17th of March 2012.
