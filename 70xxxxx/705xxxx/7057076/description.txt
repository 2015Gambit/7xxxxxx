Hot August Night is a 1972 live double album by Neil Diamond. "Hot August night" is also the opening lyric to 
Diamond's 1969 single, "Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show" The album is a recording of a Diamond concert 
on August 24, 1972, one of ten sold out concerts that Diamond performed that month at The Greek Theatre in Los 
Angeles. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls Hot August Night "the ultimate Neil Diamond record ... [which] 
shows Diamond the icon in full glory."

The album has become a great success for Diamond, and in Australia, it spent 29 weeks at number 1 on the album 
charts during 1973 & 1974, a feat only reachieved by Delta Goodrem with her Sony BMG-based album Innocent Eyes 
in 2003. This figure was surpassed in the 1980s by Dire Straits with their album Brothers in Arms spending 34 
weeks at number one on the album charts.

It was the number one charting album in Australia for the 1970s, entering the Australian album charts in late 
1972 and was still charting in the top 20 in 1976. It re-entered the Australian top 10 in 1982.

This album, and its predecessor album Moods, are generally acknowledged to be the two most important recording 
projects of Diamond's career in terms of defining his signature sound, and in the case of Hot August Night his 
live performance style, for the future..
