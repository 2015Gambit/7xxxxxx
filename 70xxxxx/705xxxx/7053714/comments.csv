Cyclop Synthesizer!
It's a monophonic monster, armed to the teeth with jaw dropping effects and wobblier than a jelly on a space hopper. CYCLOP is the scratch-looping, sample-mashing, sub-generating, harmonic-splicing mothership of the twisted bass alliance and it's landing on your desktop soon. With masses of new sounds for you audio-junkies, from screaming analog syncs through brutal FM sounds to scintillating spectral shimmers. The integrated sampler also works as wavetable synth and pitch transformer for creating unbelievable and disturbing monster voices. CYCLOP is more than massively loaded with features: 10 incredible filters, unique wobble generator, feedback processor, 3 overdrives and an effects sequencer. CYCLOP is expected to be released in spring 2012. Keep an eye on it! "

,LoopLike,2012-04-30T04:55Z,this RAR is protected with password
,HeywoodFloyd,2012-06-30T20:42Z,"Don't waste your time with this one...

I downloaded 2 others copies from differents hosters, and they were also protected by a password...

However, the 3rd file i downloaded hadn't any pass 
so go search on filestube or else & be patient...
