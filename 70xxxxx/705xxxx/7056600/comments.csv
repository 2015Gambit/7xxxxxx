Due to the way files are transferred over torrents, file corruption is much more likely than with other methods. Whenever you torrent, you're downloading little pieces of your file from hundreds, or potentially thousands of different computers, which are then re-assembled by your torrent client as soon as they reach you. If any one of those hundreds of people has a corrupted copy of the file, then your file is likely to be corrupt as well and you would end up having to re-download the entire file - which really sucks when it's something like an 8GB 1080p video. 

Splitting a large file into several small volumes during compression makes it so that if you get a corrupt volume, you only have to re-download that one little piece of your file. It also makes it harder for those pricks at our ISPs to monitor what we're downloading. Split-up .rar or tar archives are just about the best thing since sliced bread for torrents. 

Even if, knowing all that, you still somehow disagree with it - all you have to do to extract the thing is right-click on the .part01 and hit ""extract here"". It takes all of five extra seconds, quit complaining. "

Thats not entirely correct if i understand you correctly. You are correct when you say splitting up the file and with your ISP, but the file can only be corrupt if the uploaders file is corrupt. When a uploader uploades a new torrent and the file he has is corrupt then those who download the file wil get a corrupt file, it is not possible to get a corrupt file from the source ""The Uploader"" when the file is not corrupt, because Utorrent as an example has a hashing system to check the file. If you right-click on a torrent in Utorrent you will se Force Re-check. So it's almost impossible to get a corrupt file when the uploader files is not corrupt from the moment when he made this torrent.    "
