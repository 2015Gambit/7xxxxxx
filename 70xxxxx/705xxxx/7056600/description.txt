-Gold.Rush.Alaska.S02E18.Judgment.Day.HDTV.x264-MOMENTUM

Release Date.....: 2012-02-24
Filesize.........: 417.7MB
Runtime..........: 42m32s
Video............: 1247Kbps x264
Audio............: 121Kbps AAC 2 channels
Frame Size.......: 720x402
Frame Rate.......: 25.000 fps

Release Notes....: CRiMSON has three duplicate lines at the bottom. If they were part of
                   source, they should have been cropped. I have never encountered that
                   on any discovery channel show so chances are they're just taking a
                   short cut with some disallowed filter to speed up their encode.
