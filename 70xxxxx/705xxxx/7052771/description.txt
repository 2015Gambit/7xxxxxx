TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Catherine Zeta-Jones was approached to play Vivien Leigh, but declined in favor to spend time with ailing husband Michael Douglas. After she dropped out of the project, Rachel Weisz was considered to replace her, however, she was filming three projects back to back at the time (The Untitled Terrence Malick Project, the Untitled Lynn Shelton Project and The Deep Blue Sea), so Julia Ormond was cast instead.

Scarlett Johansson was approached for the part of Marilyn Monroe but turned it down. 

Five actors from this movie have appeared in different Harry Potter movies:Kenneth Branagh (as Prof. Gilderoy Lockhart), Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger), Geraldine Somerville (as Lily Potter), Toby Jones (as the voice of Dobby) and ZoÃ« Wanamaker (as Madam Hooch).

Dame Judi Dench who portrays Dame Sybil Thorndike, actually met her several times in real life. The first time was in 1958, when Dench was in Romeo and Juliet at the Old Vic. "She came round to see us afterwards and was so charming. We were young actors and she was lovely to us and strongly encouraging and gentle. I think they got very, very close to how Dame Sybil was in the script." 

Michelle Williams won a Golden Globe for Best Actress - Comedy or Musical in 2012 for her performance in this film. The real Marilyn Monroe won the same award in 1960.
