PhotoshopPortable 12.1 Multilingual (PortableApps.com Format)
============================================================
Yes.. i know i have posted Photoshop already. 
What can i say? im a perfectionist.
If i keep finding things i can improve, i will continue.
This release is quite a significant improvement.

Most notably: "File Info" module, which is Photoshop's metadata.
You can access this by clicking "File" > "File Info".

Another dramatic improvement is Java support.
I've added support for jPortable.
Simply install into "CommonFiles" and PhotoshopPortable can use it.

If people appreciate these releases, i will continue to update and
release the rest in the coming weeks...
