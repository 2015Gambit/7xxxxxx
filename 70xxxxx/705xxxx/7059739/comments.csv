These language packs are for v3.

If you don't have it, DL the Rosetta Stone program here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso

there is a PDF enclosed, it has detailed instructions on how to install program and languages

DO NOT be fooled into needing any serials/keygens

Replace the exe with the one in the crack folder.

,oranjkik,2012-03-27T17:29Z,"Thanks for the upload Ein. I got all the way through to page 23 on how to install, but can't get the program to recognize any language levels. Keeps saying language cd not found. Tried both daemon and burning iso to cd. No luck. Do you have any suggestions? "
,oranjkik,2012-03-27T18:47Z,Ein. I restarted my computer and it worked! Thanks again! Awesome torrent!
,ban4321,2012-04-26T16:34Z,"this language pack keeps killing my client. 
help maybe?"
,ban4321,2012-04-26T19:46Z,i guess i should say... it begins to open... then the client freezes.. im forced to close it down
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-17T12:58Z,"@ban4321,

Try this instead:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe

Now that TPB is back up I will be UL'ing the language packs later today.

The language packs will have this name format:
""Rosetta_Stone_v3_French_Preinstalled.exe""

TO ALL:

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar""

Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file

Click ""Never register""
At the activation screen, click ""Continue""
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean. "
