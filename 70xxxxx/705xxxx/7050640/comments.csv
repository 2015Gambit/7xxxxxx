,Kole97,2012-02-23T11:32Z,Blur deserve there cred ! The performance was live and raw but still fantastic. Seriously im from Australia and this represents the Britďťż pop rock explosion that occurred in the 90's here. Blur were and remain a great asset to Brit music. u guys should be proud. Adele still has to earn hers.......
