Ice Magazine mentioned it for several consecutive issues, singling out the improved sound quality, rarity of the material and the excellent packaging.  In the ensuing years many other titles have been released with these recordings, but this seminal House Of Elrond release still stands up.The first tape is from the March 19, 1969 â€œmissingâ€ BBC session from the Maida Vale Studio on the Alexis Korner show on the BBC.  Known as the session with the extreme rarity â€œSunshine Woman,â€ the track first circulated on a very poor recording found on an extremely hard to find single and can also be found as a bonus track on the 3CD set Motor City Daze (Antrabata ARM 120773) and BBC Sessions (LSD-61/62/63/64) on Last Stand Disc.
