Sherlock is a British television series that presents a contemporary update of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\'s Sherlock Holmes detective stories. It was created by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson.

Steven Moffat wrote the first episode, \"A Study in Pink\", loosely based upon A Study in Scarlet. Coky Giedroyc had directed a 60 minute version of the episode, but it had to be reshot when the BBC commissioned episodes of 90 minutes duration. The revised version of \"A Study in Pink\", directed by Paul McGuigan, was first broadcast simultaneously on BBC One and BBC HD on 25 July 2010.[42][43]
The second episode, \"The Blind Banker\" in which Holmes is hired by an old friend to investigate a mysterious break-in at a bank in the City, was written by Stephen Thompson and directed by Euros Lyn.[44] The first series concluded with \"The Great Game\", which was first broadcast on 8 August 2010. The episode introduces the character of Jim Moriarty to the series (Andrew Scott), who sets Holmes deadlines to solve a series of apparently unrelated cases. Written by Mark Gatiss and directed by McGuigan, \"The Great Game\" ends in a cliffhanger in which Sherlock and Moriarty reach a standoff involving a bomb strapped to Watson.
