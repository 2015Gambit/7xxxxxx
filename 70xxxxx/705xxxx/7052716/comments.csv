,nhirsch,2012-02-27T03:28Z,Thanks for the great upload.   It appears though that there is a small area missing:  Kaliningrad-Chernyakhovsk-Gusev between Poland and Lithuania. 
,n.covers,2012-03-05T13:25Z,"Något dum fråga, (kanske?) men hur använder jag dessa kartor? 
Är det bara att kopiera över allt till mappen ""Garmin"" på enheten?

Är tacksam för all hjälp."
,Rosenberg666,2012-03-17T15:06Z,"n.covers oftas är det så att man bara lägger dom i ""garmin""

annars om det finns nån txt fil så står det väl vad man ska göra."
,Epithet01,2012-03-17T16:47Z,Thanks for the upload. Works a treat. Great to have my Garmin up to date.
,drayton359,2012-03-27T14:05Z,"UK & Ireland map on device says it is CN Europe NT 2010.10 not 2012.40

Where can I get 2012.40 ?"
,drayton359,2012-03-27T22:13Z,"Nevermind, had to put the map in a Map folder not the Garmin one, you have to do that on the Garmin but can place it in a Garmin folder if using SD card"
,Mettsson,2012-04-01T12:05Z,"I've uploaded the Western Europe-map to my Nuvi 760 but when I turn it on, the map is blank. Nothing. Just the car and no actual map? What did I do wrong and how can I get it right? "
,Ipmark,2012-04-04T11:22Z,"Check ""Map Info"" if the GPS read the map (I think not).
On your Nuvi the map must be copied in the Garmin folder, to avoid conflicts remove (or rename extension to imx) any other map that overlap"
,kammi,2012-04-05T15:17Z,"Hi
Tried in different ways to make it work, but no....
Shall both the wester-and the easternmap be on the card , or on the garmindevice?
Witch countrymap should be where?
So, Witch map should be where?
HELP!"
,kammi,2012-04-05T15:25Z,"Hi again
Forgott to tell U, that I have a 760.."
,sbr8888,2012-04-09T23:56Z,"Ipmark, you the man!  Thanks!!!"
,216579687,2012-04-14T14:00Z,"Thanks!
Works very well.
With ""GmapTool"" I split those files and made myself a custom mapset. Perfect!!"
,rufus0102,2012-04-18T23:01Z,Sweden seems missing ?
,Ipmark,2012-04-22T14:34Z,"Sweden is in 
Garmin Nor-Swe-Fin NT 2012.40 Unlocked IMG.rar
map."
,michelcp,2012-04-27T22:09Z,"Thanks Ipmark, how do we use these .img files?"
,goondog,2012-04-27T23:20Z,Thank you but what are we supposed to do once we have the maps?
,carmenb,2012-06-10T08:15Z,"Hi Ipmark, I have Garmin nuvi 3790.How can I add these maps to it please?"
