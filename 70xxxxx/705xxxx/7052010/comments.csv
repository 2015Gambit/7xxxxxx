[T],momamedienta,2012-03-01T21:38Z,apologies for the poor seeding the last few days.  I know most of you are stuck at about 53% but I am having issues with my internet connection and am currently connecting at free wifi spots so seeding will be slow and intermittent.  Hopefully the situation will be resolved soon.
[T],momamedienta,2012-03-23T00:41Z,I'm really really sorry for the poor seeding.  I am still having issues with my internet at home (issues like I have no internet to speak of).  I'm trying to get to the library where I can seed for an hour or so but that is difficult sometimes without transportation.  Rest assured that I WILL get this seeded so others can help me eventually.

[T],momamedienta,2012-05-22T01:14Z,apologies.  I am still dealing with no internet at home.
[T],momamedienta,2012-05-24T20:49Z,I was able to seed for a couple of hours today but I don't know when I'll be able to get back on
[T],momamedienta,2012-06-27T01:57Z,I am happy to see that we finally got enough people to seed so I don't have to worry about getting online.  Thank you to all who are helping by seeding this torrent.  Season 5 should be coming out in the UK this fall and once it does I will try to up it here.
[T],momamedienta,2012-07-20T03:27Z,I'm seeding again.  Please do not hit and run.  I can't guarantee how long I'll be able to seed
