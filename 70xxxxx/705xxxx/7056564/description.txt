This is the full album of Minecraft - Volume Alpha. 

I tagged the artist as Minecraft and the composer as C418 to make it a bit simpler. I also renamed the album to Volume Alpha instead of Minecraft - Volume Alpha.

Just makes things a bit more easier to understand while giving credit to C418.
