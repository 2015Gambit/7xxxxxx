Beyond Compare is a powerful time-saving utility for comparing files and folders on your Windows system. Keymaker from ZWT still works on the final update.
Beyond Compare 3.3.4 Build 14431 Final (Keymaker-ZWT)
Use it to manage source code, keep folders in sync, compare program output, and validate copies of your data. Beyond Compare can create a snapshot of a live directory structure, and compare it against the live copy at a later date.
