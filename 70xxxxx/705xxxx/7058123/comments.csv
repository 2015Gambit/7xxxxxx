Next is the fellow who believes he accidentally picked up the wrong paper cup because his did not have 34 rocks of crack in it. Finally a minor disturbance turns hilarious as Larry, a shaved headed ex con explains to the cops, ""I am racist. That's just the way I am. That's it, you know? And when I said that, he just went ballistic."" He in this case was a black man out with his 12 year old son. Larry: ""I'm white. That's the way I like it. I don't care to mingle with people like that."" Later... Cop: ""What kind of weapon did you use?"" Larry: ""I cut somebody's throat."" Cop: ""Let me ask you a question, Larry. The person whose throat you cut: what race were they?"" Larry: ""You guess."""
