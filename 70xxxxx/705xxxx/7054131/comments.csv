I don't want this to be a fake, but that's how it appears now."

 Your obviously new to piratebay else you would have noticed the green skull and the fact that this is upped by sceneline.

  If you know its fake then please by all means let us know in what way is it pron..? or simply an old episode mislabeled..?"
,Kooblukhan,2012-02-24T05:36Z,"sceneline is legit, do a little research.."
,LackThereof,2012-02-24T05:44Z,"Sceneline is legit, but why post a torrent of a multipart rar, and then have no active seeds for a whole fucking hour?  500 people on the torrent at 0.0% before they actually start the seed.

some dude on an el-cheapo cable connection could have got the episode out faster.  sceneline's just trolling us."
,btchtits,2012-02-24T12:19Z,"why has this stalled at 79% mark ??
