SYNOPSIS: In the early nineties, theater director AndrÃ© Gregory mounted a series of spare, private performances of Anton Chekhovâ€™s Uncle Vanya in a crumbling Manhattan playhouse. This experiment in pure theaterâ€”featuring a remarkable cast of actors, including Wallace Shawn, Julianne Moore, Brooke Smith, and George Gaynesâ€”would have been lost to time had it not been captured on film, with subtle cinematic brilliance, by Louis Malle. Vanya on 42nd Street is as memorable and emotional a screen version of Chekhovâ€™s masterpiece as one could ever hope to see. This film, which turned out to be Malleâ€™s last, is a tribute to the playwrightâ€™s devastating work as well as to the creative process itself.
