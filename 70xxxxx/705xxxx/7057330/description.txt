David Blair directs this powerful British Drama, loosely inspired by John Steinbeck's novel 'Of Mice and Men' 
Set in Nottingham, the film revolves around the relationship between the thuggish Danny (Stephen Graham) and 
Joseph (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), a giant of a man with a mental age of seven. When Danny finds himself in debt 
to a local crime boss, he feels he is left with no choice but to manipulate Joseph into participating in a series 
of underground cage fights from which Danny can pay his debts
