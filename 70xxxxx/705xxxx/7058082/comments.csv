,Hirudinea,2012-04-30T15:58Z,"Thank you so much YIFY for this upload!
The video and audio are excellent and the file size is very small for 2:22:26 duration at 1920x1072. It's the best 1.6 gigs I ever downloaded!
As reported by xander09 there is a disturbance after ""turn around"" around 14:27 but it's short.
If anyone is wondering whether to get this movie or not, do it! This movie is #1 or #2 on the IMDB best movies list, and deservedly so.
It's not for the faint-hearted - there is bad language and sexual violence, but it's all appropriate in context, and this is a very well-made movie with a great story."

I appreciate the upload.

The audio on this upload is much better than others you ripped.

However, there are a few video quality issues during the movie.  One at 14 minutes, one around 32 minutes, and another about an hour in.  They last from 1-5 seconds.

Hope you can improve on the next rip.

CHEERS"
