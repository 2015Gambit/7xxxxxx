,godofodd,2012-02-25T21:24Z,"7/7 a/v. The PA copy is way better, but scenebalance has submitted an mkv and their tweaks are often the best."
,godofodd,2012-02-25T21:28Z,"Eh, 7/7 is probably overly generous. 6/5. The sound is pretty rough on both this and the PA release, though the video is greatly improved on PA."
,godofodd,2012-02-26T00:10Z,Scratch that. The PA release is the best of the bunch.

,slanx,2012-02-26T06:54Z,"for god and jok..wtf are you on. who the fuck even bothers to burn this shit to dvd anymore. Morons, great job SaM. ooks great on my 27"" iMac."
,slanx,2012-02-26T06:59Z,"Guess I'm gettin' veto'd, last comment destroyed. Considering the awful bit of crap we get here I'd say A/V are 8. Anyone who loves hockey will dig this movie and this copy. Also...I'm curious w the fuck burns DVD's anymore? Whiney bitches."
