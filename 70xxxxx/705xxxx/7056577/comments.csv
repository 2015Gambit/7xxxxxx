http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7056633/Spartacus_S02E05_HDTV_XviD-3LT0N%5Bettv%5D

android and maybe ps3 can't play x264 version, so u should download XviD version"
,xtheghost,2012-02-25T13:08Z,Personally I like the MP4 files better. It's just preference.

,Foxie10,2012-02-26T06:23Z,"I love this 'fucking' show! Expose of gorgeous Aussie & NZ guys in cod pieces, kick arse fighting, awesome FX - same guys that made Xena & Hercules for you young wipper snappers!!
Our clever (and most fabulous) trackers have better faster software now for the new file formats which will all going this way with smaller file size better compression and higher res, need more powerful processors to decompress them.

Totally brilliant episode, quality file, thanks for sharing :o)  Enjoy!"

First off, it's not the filename, it's the codec used. Just to be nitpicky.

""mp4"" files are generally encoded using x264 (H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 Advanced Video Coding) in use since around 2004, but noticeably only since 2008 and later, with not many consumer-grade equipment supporting it natively yet

""avi"" files are lately generally encoded using Xvid (MPEG-4 Part 2 Advanced Simple Profile), in use since 2001 or so, and a hardcoded part of many consumer electronics

Classic commercial DVDs use MPEG2, which is recognized natively by pretty much everything on the market today.


x264 allows better compression rates compared to Xvid (and far, far more compared to MPEG2), so either higher quality or higher resolutions (or a combination thereof) given the same file size, but is significantly more computationally intensive compared to Xvid to decode (which in turn is also noticeably more computationally intensive compared to MPEG2).

Funny enough, PS3 *does* support x264 decoding, but only a very small subset of it, namely high profile, level 4.1 (and nothing else).
You can always just re-encode the movie locally on your computer (using something like the free software Handbrake) so it will be in that particular format."
,Typharius,2012-02-26T10:56Z,"Ah for gods sake, look guys I love your uploads and I always choose you first faithfully. However why have you not uploaded this in avi as with all of the previous episodes? This format will not work on 360 which I am sure many of us use via streaming to the console. The only xvid version up has been decoded strangely and doesn't run properly either. Can we have a good AVI copy please? And I do ask humbly because I realise technically I have no right to complain. Cheers."
,Superman169,2012-02-26T11:14Z,Plays just fine on my android thanks for the up!!

,Sknmissle,2012-02-28T16:46Z,"Umm... my TV Plays has plug and play, it plays the movies of a memory stick just fine, im sorry you wasted your money on a sony product ""Sony which is anti piracy""..... you two faced pirate throw your ps3 away and get something better an Atari would suffice they have a broader game selection... isn't that sad."
,Sknmissle,2012-02-28T16:48Z,for all you android lovers get MX video player app and get the paid version it plays any file of any type and if there is no sound you can choose the audio track in the file to use :)
