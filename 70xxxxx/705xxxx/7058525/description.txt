Decoy represents the first sign of a major shift in the way Miles made music for the rest of the decade. Now, he would delegate much of the work to younger musicians, who used synthesizers and other electronic instruments to create the music. Keyboardist Robert Irving III composed and arranged much of the music on Decoy, which features John Scofield on guitar, Branford Marsalis on soprano saxophone and Darryl â€œThe Munchâ€ Jones on bass. The energetic title track is a classic, while the bluesy â€œThatâ€™s Right,â€ is an 11-minute epic with fine performances from everyone. Decoy also includes two highly-charged live funk numbers
