I have been waiting for the XVID version of this.  my micca player can't play mkv.  So just wanted to say thank-you for all your work.  I have been trying to learn how to convert mkv to avi for the last week or so so that i can upload and do my part in sharing.  however, every program i use to convert mkv to avi gives bad picture results.  i have used divx converter, gom, and so many others.  any recommendation on which program will convert mkv to avi with good clear pictures.  Once again, thanks for all you do."
