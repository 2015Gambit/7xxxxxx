          It was a different time...and  a different pace. Elijah Wood  and
          Kevin  Costner star  in a  rich feast  for the  senses from  the
          director of  Fried Green  Tomatoes. This  heartwarming film tells
          the tale of a close-knit family and their remarkable  Mississippi
          summer of 1970.

          With the  help of  their friends,  Stu (Wood)  and Lidia  Simmons
          (Lexi Randall) are determined to build the ultimate treehouse,  a
          place  of wonder  and magic.  Their father  Stephen (Costner),  a
          newly returned Vietnam vet, has equally high hopes to rebuild his
          life and fulfill his family's dreams.

          Co-starring Mare Winningham, The War will captivate all who  fall
          under  its spell.  It's a  film rich  with humor,  nostalgia and
          mesmerising performances.  It is,  in the  words of  the National
          News Syndicate, "a must-see movie."
