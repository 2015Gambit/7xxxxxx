Your favorite PROJECT RUNWAY designers of seasons past are back! The show follows designers Austin Scarlett (Season 1) and Santino Rice (Season 2) as they travel to and immerse themselves in the culture of small towns across America to create new looks for special women in unique situations as they celebrate such life milestones as anniversaries, birthdays, balls, graduations and bachelorette parties. (In the only way Austin and Santino can ... fabulously!)

As of 2012, Austin is currently a contestant on Project Runway Allstars on Lifetime.  Santino is currently a weekly judge on RuPaul\\\'s Drag Race on Logo.

Uploader notes:

This show aired in HD on the Lifetime channel in the summer of 2010.
Unfortunately the show was not renewed for a second season.  :(

Enjoy!
