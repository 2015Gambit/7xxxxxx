The avis, and everything else except for the sample games, can be downloaded from https://sites.google.com/site/rpgstudio/

Compressing that download leaves only ~100MB instead of 2GB."

True, problem is lots of people stupid enough just to know the RAR need to uncompressed first. And I don't want to make difficult for those kind of peoples."
