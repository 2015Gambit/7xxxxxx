RPG Studio is the easiest and best of it's class for developing multiplayer online Action Role Playing Games.

For non Win XP user:
====================

Update your windows before run RPG Studio.
If still have problems, try run as Admin in compatibility mode, also you may try disable DX 2D hardware accelerator.

====================

One more thing, because games produced by RPG Studio always have multiplayer capability, you must let RPG Studio pass your firewall.

This is a rare piece of software ever, lots of people sought it over internet and so I'm trying to re-seed it.
