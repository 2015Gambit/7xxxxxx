NOTES:
 
Sources:
Well had to use both cams to make a full complete video.....main bulk is the video by p76 and the intro and middle part
around 44-45mins in is the nogrp cam....last 1-2mins.
The p76 was awesome but had bad ar,alots of movement,some colour issues but a really good base too work with.
The audio is from no grp and was very nice cam audio,just needed some lovin
 
Workdone:
Right had to cut the vide into 4 plus 2 cuts from the old cam and had to crop,filter each part differently due to movement etc...
Also AR does change due to having to use one res,but thought it was the best suited over all.
Lots of work done on the video changing the colours,chroma,brightness,contrast and sharpness.
Got too be honest and say you will still see some borders on the video due to the bad movement,but didn't want to hack it too death and
lose loads of video so ....but watching on a tv you can't really tell that much.
Audio ...went back to the drawing board now i've found some nice setting and this was original cleaned beforehand .....so audio is totally
remastered now changing all the EQ bands and also lowered the DB's ..
Oh yeah had to resync it all due to the extra footaged added so ....but at least now it is complete and nothing missing except a few mins of
the end credits,but who watchs them anyways lol.
