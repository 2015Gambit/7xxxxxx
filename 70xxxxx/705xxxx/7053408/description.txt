Our days` soundtrack.

Ending of the first decade of the 21st century became a moment of stagnation, kind of music timelessness Î“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã‡Â£ previous wave of native bands had started to decline, many of them had reached potential maximum, some - disbanded (R.I.P). And new ideas capable of leading the youth hasnt appeared yet. Music society kept waiting for and watching for a band-seer identifying new trends.
What could be noted as a tail of the previous wave?  There is not so much bands that we can respect  and pay attention, they can be counted on the fingers of one hand. 
The fact is that the leader in terms of talent in the music industry sphere interesting us became a triad of cities of the Central Volga region: Kazan, Ulyanovsk and Samara. So we have a couple of dozen bands.
Young group of different styles rather boldly and loudly begin to declare themselves.
