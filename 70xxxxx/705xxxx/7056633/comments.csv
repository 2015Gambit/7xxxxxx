,Foxie10,2012-02-26T06:28Z,"I love this 'fucking' show! Expose of gorgeous Aussie & NZ guys in cod pieces, kick arse fighting, awesome FX - same guys that made Xena & Hercules for you young wipper snappers!!
Our clever (and most fabulous) trackers have better faster software now for the new file formats which will all going this way with smaller file size better compression and higher res, need more powerful processors to decompress them.

Totally brilliant episode, quality file, thanks for sharing :o) Enjoy!"

""mp4"" files are generally encoded using x264 (H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 Advanced Video Coding) in use since around 2004, but noticeably only since 2008 and later, with not many consumer-grade equipment supporting it natively yet

""avi"" files are lately generally encoded using Xvid (MPEG-4 Part 2 Advanced Simple Profile), in use since 2001 or so, and a hardcoded part of many consumer electronics

Classic commercial DVDs use MPEG2, which is recognized natively by pretty much everything on the market today.


x264 allows better compression rates compared to Xvid (and far, far more compared to MPEG2), so either higher quality or higher resolutions (or a combination thereof) given the same file size, but is significantly more computationally intensive compared to Xvid to decode (which in turn is also noticeably more computationally intensive compared to MPEG2).

On a halfway reasonable PC (so it won't stutter decoding), given the same filesize, you will get the best viewing experience with a properly encoded x264 mkv/mp4/avi (yes, you can encode them ""badly"", and some lack the experience to tweak the settings right), then less quality with an Xvid avi, and least quality with a MPEG2 vob of the same filesize."

De okos vagy, csinálj jobbat!

Köszönd meg azután kapd be Jupiter pöcsét, mielőtt a picsádba nyomják!"
,hurkagyurka1979,2012-02-27T00:23Z,Thanks from Hungary!
,QborT,2012-02-27T05:24Z,"Anyone that thinks avi XviD's are better than mp4 x264 truly has no clue what they are talking about.

x264 is the new scene standard and only a couple of scene groups refused to step up to the x264."
