Quote:

Focussed on the essential modules of an analogue synthesizer Alpha 3 offers true hands on operation. Everything is where you would expect it, nothing is more complex as it needs to be. Nothing is less powerful as it needs to be. Alpha 3 is the sum of all our experience in synthesizer manufacturing.

Just when you get tired of over-complex synthesizers of today, when you want to return to the roots, the beginning of all synthetic sound, the times when a Synthesizer could be fully programmed, then the Alpha 3 is the right synthesizer for you. Get the synth that you can control.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac, OSX.4 and above
