Disc Features:
* An interesting presentation from Image. The print is seriously flawed, but then again, it is 80 years old. On an audio level, theres a choice of a re-created score or full commentary by film scholar Mike Budd, who talks at length about the films artistic, technological and social context. There are also some extras -- original art and photographs from the films 1920 opening and a short excerpt of the film Genuine: A Tale of a Vampire, by Caligaris creators. 
SYNOPSIS:  
In this silent 1920s masterpiece, an insane asylum inmate explains to his psychiatrist how he came to the institution, telling the shrink the story of the evil hypnotist Caligari (Werner Krauss) and his unwitting pawn, the sleepwalker Cesare (Conrad Veidt). This stark expressionist film from German director Robert Wiene astonishes with the power of its sets and visuals, and the creepy plot easily raises hackles on the back of ones neck.
