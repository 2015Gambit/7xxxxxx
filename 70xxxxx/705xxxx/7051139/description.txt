Director-Writer, Joe Castro (Terror Toons 1&2, The Jackhammer Massacre) introduces another original tale -- the first anthology slasher film which presents eight killers in 5 gorefest tales.  Featuring Brinke Stevens (Slumber Party Massacre), Nick Principe (Laid to Rest), and Cleve Hall (Nightmare), plus a never before recorded gore epic body count with more than 150 onscreen deaths.


Ungodly brutal beatings turns Chris, a young man, into a fiend that sets off a bloody, like never before seen, rampage.  Beauty is truly only skin deep - Watch a young paraplegic, whose body is also wrecked with spinal bifida, fight for her life as her older, beautiful sister tries to murder her.


Itâ€™s been 36 years since Jesseâ€™s loving mother was raped by his biological father. Now, after hiding and running their entire lives in fear of this murderous rapist --- He has found them!  A group of Christian teenagers are stalked, mamed and burned by a local legend in a haunted forest.


Three legendary serial killers terrorize downtown Los Angeles by murdering countless innocent souls and the killer plan is to go out with a real bang.


Thereâ€™s nothing like the sweltering heat of summer to set off a massacre. The Summer of Massacre is a 100 mph slasher ride that never slows down. Packed with enough gore and insanity to send you looking for your barf bag.
