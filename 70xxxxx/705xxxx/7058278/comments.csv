,kennykillerkoala,2012-08-18T22:08Z,"Good quality works with active glasses but this side by side is pissing me after 5 minutes 
Thanks anyway"
,kennykillerkoala,2012-08-19T00:25Z,"got it working with A.C Rayan and samsung tv problem was media player was set @ 720p but 3d needs at least 1280x720p to show single format.

In acryan change settings video/video system 1080p
I would guess the same for any other media player 
Then go to Samsung picture/3d mode and change picture to side by side and for some reason it makes it single

All working excellent thanks Yify"
