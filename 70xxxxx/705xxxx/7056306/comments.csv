Is this actually in POLISH?
Seems to be quite popular in seeds and leechers so I am wondering if maybe it was a mistake to LANGUAGE: POLISH

Or not???"
[T],rlf-rls,2012-02-26T10:31Z,Language: Polish :)
,meridjal,2012-02-29T22:31Z,Should make clear in the description that it's polish language instead of wasting people's time you prick!
,neeliesu,2012-04-01T15:28Z,"@meridjal. it clearly states.... 
spoken language - Polish, how much clearer do you want it. I'm assuming as you can write you can also read?"
