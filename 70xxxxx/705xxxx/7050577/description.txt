Today, as a result of social progress and developments in medicine, the average human lifespan exceeds seventy years. Is this the limit? Why do we age? What mechanism lies at the base of this phenomenon, and are there means to retard it? What is the physiological norm for each age group?
The author, who is a professor and Doctor of Medicine, answers all these questions from the position of modern science.
The book is intended for doctors, biologists, and anyone who is interested in contemporary biomedicine.

Vladimir Dilman was a famous Soviet endocrinologist and oncologist. In late 1980s he emigrated to USA, where published this English updated version of the originally Russian and thin book. The book appears a little bit outdated in 2010 because we had some discoveries in last ten years. But it really doesnt matter. Why? Because the real beauty of the scientific book is not in the page number or concentration of the ideas in the text, but how the ideas are presented to the reader. How they are clear for the reader.
