,pooloop,2012-02-26T06:30Z,"yes full game and show on by private blog,Its twats like this why real capper stop puplic capping,stupid and sad moan an groan,they find just like you do harder and harder to get good caps of any footy,Half a brain would just google the word pooloop"
,testy108,2012-02-26T06:36Z,thanks for this
,lucabara,2012-02-26T07:24Z,"worst news i got in a while..
POOLOOP blog is by invite only, read only like the 4 comments i can see and seems like you in a lot of re-modelling stuff, please let me know how can i get an invite to the blog.
in the meantime... thanks FOOTBALLMAL"
,EdoSensei,2012-02-26T08:57Z,"I really don't understand your grievances pooloop! Why are you so confrontational? If this is your cap that has been recycled by footballmal, then admittedly he should credit your effort, but even then when he has done so in the past, all you do is hurl abuse at people.

As I write there's 228 seeders and 172 leechers of this MotD. How many downloaded/ing from your blog pooloop? 400 people on here appreciating your effort assuming it was your cap!(I guess it was but I have no proof.) Doesn't that make you feel good that you were able to make all those people happy?

You say that on your private site donations are by CHOICE. That's fine, but then why won't you give out invites to people who haven't donated? That's not choice. I requested an invite stating that I had to wait till the end of the week for the transfer to clear before making a donation, and you refused me because I haven't yet made a donation!

You DO NOT own the rights to any of these programmes you are uploading. Yet you act like you do?! If you expect people to make donations to you for your time, then don't tell people to fuck off all the time!

Rant over!"
,wartyannie,2012-02-26T09:54Z,"Am really happy that Fottballmal put this on PB because I don't know how else to get this program in Australia.  
Pooloop, happy to donate.  I downloaded from your site a couple of weeks ago to see what it was like, was going to donate this week but have gone on an found it's invite only.  Not sure how to get invite and therefore can't donate, so in a bit bit of a bind.
I really just want ot watch MOTD, which I can;t do through the BBC so am just glad that others will help out.  "
[V],neon,2012-02-26T11:16Z,"i also tried to get a pooloop blog membership but cant accsess the blog at all ...no idea how to...pooloop you should make it easier to join... this is what we see

 ""It doesn't look like you have been invited to read this blog. If you think this is a mistake, you might want to contact the blog author and request an invitation.""

how do we do that without getting into the blog

and thanks for this footballmal :)"
,wwwphil,2012-02-26T12:13Z,Thanks.
,sonsofthenaughtyboys,2012-02-26T16:16Z,"I thought this was supposed to be about love of football and that games were uploaded to help out us poor sods, around the world, that can't get MOTD any other way.
Thank you to anyone and everyone that makes this happen."
,namlashs,2012-02-26T22:25Z,"Thanks footballmal !!! Please keep on posting motd's !!
thanks alot again !"
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2012-02-27T04:27Z,"many many thanks footballmal.

poolop,you know what you can do!"
,micron66,2012-02-27T05:01Z,"The credit for this rip goes to hannibal @thebox.bz,not to pooloop.

Furthermore,pooloop why don't u FUCK off to ur blog where now only those who pay money can get these matches.

What u do goes against the basic reason why filesharing started in the 1st place,stop spamming with ur comments here on Piratebay and go back to ur money-making blog.

@footballmal

keep up the good work,lot of people here appreciate it,but in future u may want to give credit to the original uploader/ripper."
,karrbaa,2012-02-27T06:18Z,"@micron66 Cut pooloop some slack he's done alot for us football lovers for quite some time, for a good while he put up torrents when no one else did. Too bad he moved on with a private site it's a great loss for all of us who could'nt come along and the community.

Thankfully footballmal puts up Motd, thanks brah!"
,micron66,2012-02-27T07:45Z,"@karrbaa

i would cut pooloop some slack,but time and again he comes here and starts abusing people who upload football torrents.

he could do the dignified thing and stop with these useless/abusive comments he posts on piratebay now that he has his own private blog.

just because a person uploads stuff does not mean he/she can abuse other people,nor are they free from valid criticism if they deserve it.

,karrbaa,2012-02-27T09:58Z,"@micron66
I agree you are 100% correct sir, still a pooloop fan though I just use /ignore on the tantrums."
,Qolkaa,2012-02-27T20:34Z,Thanks for the upload Mr. Footballmal. . Keep up the good work. . 
,green1985,2012-03-05T07:55Z,"thank you so much for the upload footballmal!
