                          = THE PRESIDENTS BOOK OF SECRETS =
                          ==================================





What secrets have been passed down to each United States president? Why does Air Force One always appear with its left side facing the public and how much does the president know about activating the on-board flares to repel missiles? What other secrets are available to the president, and what information is so highly classified that even the commander in chief's Top Secret-3 security clearance is not enough to gain access?



History uncovers the fascinating truths behind some of the most confidential secrets in American history in THE PRESIDENTâ€™S BOOK OF SECRETS. Interviews with former intelligence operatives, renowned historians and archivists show how classified information is treated in the highest circles of political power, how itâ€™s preserved throughout history, and who ensures continuity when a new leader is elected.
