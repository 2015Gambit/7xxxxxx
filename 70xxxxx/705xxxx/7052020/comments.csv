,President_Kush,2012-02-24T14:56Z,"on LG 32LD550 (2010 model TV) the video plays until 00:08:27 and then cuts out and says ""invalid file"" anyone else get this problem?

It works fine in WMP 12.  I've had this also happen on 1 other movie, could it be that Cinvavia DRM?"
,CrimsonKiss07,2012-02-26T00:25Z,"Great quality! Audio and Video 10/10 the only problem is the MKV is absolutely incapable of muxing into any file for PS3. I've never had this problem before, but always get the error ""muxing failed"" with this video. Still, thank you uploader and great quality"
,President_Kush,2012-02-26T11:28Z,"CrimsonKiss07, what program did you use? and what type of file are you trying to mux to?  As stated in my first post, this vid wouldn't play past a few minutes on my TV.  So... I remuxed it (still .mkv) with MKVToolNix, and now it plays fine on my TV.  Maybe use MKVToolNix with MKVextractGUI 2.0 and then use whatever program you want to mux it?"
,manjurock,2012-02-28T08:35Z,why do ppl upload this kinda crap?it plays for a while in the end n credits at the end n no it doesnt play in wmp12 or in vlc. DONT DOWNLOAD.
,manjurock,2012-02-28T08:38Z,"But the sample works,so don bother."
