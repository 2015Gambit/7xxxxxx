TRIVIA FROM IMDB

When Ernesto and Alberto are at the Chuquicamata copper mine, the foreman shouts that the mine "isn't a tourist attraction." These days, it is. 

"Al otro lado del rÃ­o", by Uruguayan composer Jorge Drexler became the second song in a language other than English to win an Oscar. (The first was "Ta paidia toy Peiraia" (Children of Piraeus) by Greek composer Manos Hatzidakis from the film Never on Sunday). Producers asked Drexler, who wrote and recorded the song for the film, not to perform it during the Oscar ceremony, citing "commercial reasons" (he's not famous). Antonio Banderas and Carlos Santana performed the song instead. When Drexler went to the podium to accept his Oscar, he sang about 30 seconds of the song a capella, instead of giving a speech. 

Despite being based upon an Argentinean book, about a Cuban-Argentinean legend, with a Mexican and an Argentinean actor in the leading roles and spoken in Spanish, the film represented Brazil in many film festivals worldwide. Only the director, Walter Salles, is Brazilian. 

When Ernesto and Alberto are in Temuco, walking with the bike and reading "El Diario Austral," Alberto complains because they misspelled his last name. El Diario Austral still exists, and it's the biggest newspaper in the AraucanÃ­a region of southern Chile. During filming in Temuco, the newspaper wrote a new article about the making of the film, and deliberately misspelled Alberto's last name again, 50 years later.

PLOT: In 1952, twenty-three year old medical student Ernesto Guevara de la Serna - Fuser to his friends and later better known as 'Ernesto Che Guevara' - one semester away from graduation, decides to postpone his last semester to accompany his twenty-nine year old biochemist friend 'Alberto Granado' - Mial to his friends - on his four month, 8,000 km long dream motorcycle trip throughout South America starting from their home in Buenos Aires. Their quest is to see things they've only read about in books about the continent on which they live, and to finish that quest on Alberto's thirtieth birthday on the other side of the continent in the Guajira Peninsula in Venezuela. Not all on this trip goes according to their rough plan due to a broken down motorbike, a continual lack of money (they often stretching the truth to gain the favor of a variety of strangers to help them)...
