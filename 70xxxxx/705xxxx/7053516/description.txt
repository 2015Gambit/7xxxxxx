:: Review ::
Donald Harrison, who gained his initial recognition in the 1980s when he was 
with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and co-led a band with Terence Blanchard, 
has continued growing and evolving ever since that time. Though underrated, 
he is currently at the peak of his powers. Harrison worked with bassist Ron 
Carter, drummer Billy Cobham, and pianist James Williams in a 2002 quartet 
called the Art of Four. He reunites with Carter and Cobham for five 
selections on Heroes and also engages in three duets with the bassist. 
Whether it is a minor blues ("One of a Kind"), the "I Got Rhythm" chords of 
"Double Trouble," "Solar," or the melancholy "Candlelight," Harrison shows 
that he is a superior post-bop improviser with a sound of his own. The final 
three selections, listed as "bonus tracks," have Harrison performing a funk 
piece, a calypso, and a mistitled Thelonious Monk tune ("Well, You Needn't" 
is listed as "Straight, No Chaser") in spirited fashion with bassist Vicente 
Archer and drummer John Lamkin. This CD is one of Donald Harrison's most 
rewarding showcases to date and is highly recommended. ~ allmusic.com
