F29 Retaliator is a flight simulator game.

It is and old game I used to play for hours. It has good dogfight characteristics as well as strategic.

To play the missions you have to read the manual (which is on the folder, pdf and txt) to know what is your objective.

it is a DOS game. No need for installation, just run the retal.exe on the folder from DOS. I used DOSBOX and it worked fine.


Hope you enjoy it.
