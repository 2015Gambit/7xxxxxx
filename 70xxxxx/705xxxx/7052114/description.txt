This is the first studio recording from Mary Black in six years, and itâ€™s a collection that demonstrates an artist in full command of her bewitching vocal prowess. Throughout an impressive career, Mary has consistently demonstrated impeccable taste in her choice of material, and the evidence presented here suggests that her ear for seeking out songs of utmost grace and beauty is as keen as ever. With a voice that has only gained in depth and resonance over the years, Mary brings her trademark warmth and sincerity, casting light and shade amongst the lyrics to create her own personal space amongst the words of carefully chosen songwriters. Never one to rest on her laurels, weâ€™re gifted songs from familiar friends such as Shane Howard, Eric Bogle and Julie Matthews, alongside burgeoning writing talents, including Danny Oâ€™Reilly and Ricky Lynch.

Sharing the stage with a number of guests, Stories From The Steeples contains three duets: the beguiling â€œLighthouse Lightâ€ features Janis Ian in a perfectly balanced performance that whets the appetite for further exploration of this winsome partnership; the robust, soulful voice of Imelda May joins Mary on an affirmative song of place and belonging, â€œMountains To The Seaâ€; and the playful â€œWalking With My Loveâ€ finds Mary exchanging lines with the legendary Finbar Furey. All three performances are notable for their palpable sense of modesty and mutual admiration.

Two stand-out tracks come from particularly close to home, being written by Maryâ€™s son, Danny Oâ€™Reilly. â€œFaith In Fateâ€ paints a stark contrast between the sheer despair of a broken relationship with a determined hopefulness to move on and patch things up. Managing to be simultaneously bleak and uplifting with its heady infusion of hurt and devoted affection, itâ€™s a song that plays to all the strengths of Maryâ€™s typically emotion-wrought interpretation. Offering a similar cocktail of emotions, â€œWizard of Ozâ€ is a mournful reflection on the search for strength and happiness, underpinned by a dreamy string arrangement over which Mary lays her heartwarming vocals.

Fulfilling the role of storyteller, Mary excels in bringing lifelike colour to the characters of â€œMarguerite And The Gambler,â€ a Ricky Lynch song that recounts the familiar tale of many a traditional folk ballad, with its gamblers, true love, misguided familial intervention, heartbreak and devastation. Those purchasing the extended version of the album are handsomely rewarded with an exquisite reading of Chris Woodsâ€™ â€œOne In A Million,â€ a story of true love that takes the mundanities of life and turns it in to utter magic, and proving beyond any doubt that Mary remains a songâ€™s best friend.

Paul Kellyâ€™s â€œThey Thought I Was Asleepâ€ benefits from a tender reading, cloaked in Maryâ€™s trademark warmth, depicting the torment of a child inadvertently witnessing from the back seat of a car, the emotional breakdown of his parentsâ€™ relationship. Equally devastating, though of more epic proportions, Eric Bogleâ€™s â€œAll the Fine Young Menâ€ is made all the more disarming, thanks to the sheer reverence with which Mary furnishes this stark, anti-war anthem.

With a little less polish than some of her earlier releases, Stories From The Steeples steps forward as an intimate, unpretentious collection, bathed in a soft but radiant glow of effortlessness and wholehearted integrity. Time will tell, but Stories From The Steeples may well prove to be Maryâ€™s best yet.

The Sunday Times - by SM

There is something homely about Mary Black's songs, whether it's the tremors in her voice, or a sentimental tone, Black brings a certain familiarity as she flits between folk and Irish country. She rarely ventures out of her comfort zone, but the result is always a collection of elegant folk tales. Stories from the Steeples, Black's first studio album in six years, fits this pattern, despite the odd blast of Americana. The highlights include Mountains to the Sea, featuring Imelda May, while Lighthouse Light with Janis Ian, has a bluegrass-gospel warmth. Danny O'Reilly, the Coronas' frontman and Black's son, wrote three of the songs, including the blistering Wizard of Oz.

Hot Press, vol. 35, issue 22 - by Jackie Hayden: Assured Return By Irish Legend

With here first full studio outing in six years, Mary Black is back with an album on which she uncompromisingly showcases some of the most undeservedly unsung songwriters. The Coronasâ€™ Danny Oâ€™Reilly, (coincidentally her son), leads the pack, supplying three classy tracks. â€˜The Night Is On Our Sideâ€™ is very good while, buoyed by Blackâ€™s expressive vocal talents, â€˜Faith In Fateâ€™ is a true gem.

With the opener, the Dylanesque narrative â€˜Marguerite And The Gamblerâ€™, Black introduces us to the songsmithing skills of Ricky Lynch: Finbar Furey joins her on the jaunty â€˜Walkinâ€™ With My Loveâ€™, creating a timeless duet that suggests they should do it again soon. Imelda May joins the fray on the upbeat â€˜Mountains To The Seaâ€™, a colourful evocation of the outdoors from Australians Shane Howard and Neil Murray. The indomitable Richie Buckley lays his trademark sax on â€˜Faith In Fateâ€™. Black and Janis Ian duet deliciously on the heart-stealing â€˜Lighthouse Lightâ€™. And the album ends on a wistful note with Blackâ€™s Frenchified version of The Holliesâ€™ â€˜Fifi The Fleaâ€™.

Mary Black instinctively makes a song her own, and her voice here is more expressively fragile than before. The musicianship is impeccable, especially Bill Shanleyâ€™s guitar and Pat Crowleyâ€™s keyboards, making Stories From The Steeples a very worthy addition to an already impressive catalogue. Mary: back in the Blackâ€¦

The Irish Times, The Ticket - by SiobhÃ¡n Long

Stories define Mary Blackâ€™s latest collection, and quite a few have Antipodean roots: spare, sometimes parched, and shot through with an intimacy that lures the listener into the beating heart of the song. Danny Oâ€™Reilly of The Coronas contributes three of the best tracks, with The Wizard of Oz a standout: a story of heartbreak and tentative renewal celebrating the best of Blackâ€™s interpretive skills against a spartan backdrop of piano, cello, violin and double bass. Guest vocalists include Janis Ian, Imelda May and Finbar Furey; their disparate styles at one with Blackâ€™s. Paul Kellyâ€™s The Night Was Dark and Deep is neatly reinvented, and Blackâ€™s three offspring get a peep-in on Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s radio-friendly The Night Is on Our Side. Shades of Mary Chapin Carpenter colour this collection, whose main surprises are found lurking in the songwriting.
