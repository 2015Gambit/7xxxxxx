Will is an 2012 British sports drama directed by Ellen Perry and starring Damian Lewis, Jane March and Bob Hoskins. .At the start of the film, eleven year-old Liverpool fan Will Brennan is at a boarding school in the south of England, due to his father Garethâ€™s (Lewis) inability to look after him following the death of his mother. Gareth arrives one day out of the blue, with two tickets to see Liverpool play AC Milan in the 2005 Championsâ€™ League Final in Istanbul. Unfortunately, before they can go, Gareth dies suddenly. Will is determined to go and honour his fatherâ€™s memory. He runs away and makes it as far as France. He then meets Alek, a former Yugoslavian footballer who stopped playing during his countryâ€™s civil war.

After many trials and tribulations, Will gets his wish and has a better experience at the match than he could ever have imagined.
