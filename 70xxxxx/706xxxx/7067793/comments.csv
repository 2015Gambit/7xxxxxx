,jersson,2012-03-07T13:33Z,"Very good, thank's. Can I update or do I loose registration then ?"
,UnderworldDemon666,2012-03-09T12:08Z,"@mariousmc;jersson: It's fine to run updates. The only problem that I've personally had, is that after 30 days, it starts popping up a box whenever you first open an Office application, telling you that you are not connected to a company network. Otherwise, everything else should be fine."
,bkafouros,2012-03-10T04:48Z,Thank! It seems to work fine! 
,Chrissyboy101,2012-03-10T19:10Z,"Hi, I can't seem to get this working, I click install now and instantly shows a full installation bar with the words 'Installing Microsoft office professional 2012 but doesn't go to completion. Task manager shows no change in memory usage for it and cpu usage is at 0% for setup.exe. Any ideas? I'm running Windows 7 64 bit on a pretty good PC.
Thanks!"
,Chrissyboy101,2012-03-11T00:23Z,"Fixed it!
For anyone having the problem I did, use CC cleaner and uninstall any other copies of office before you proceed. My only problem now-The taskbar is red and states 'product activation failed', claiming I need to enter a key. But at least its installed now! Thank you!"

,ziqqi,2012-04-16T20:09Z,after a few weeks..it doesn't work anymore!:-) i have 2 days left before it shuts down..what can i do Underworlddemon666?..download another torrent?
,UnderworldDemon666,2012-04-17T13:32Z,"The MS Office products will NEVER stop working because of activation. If you don't like the message that pops up, you can use this activator thepiratebay.se/torrent/6734019/
But please do not think that this does not work. Even after the activation period is up, you can still use the MS Office products, forever."
,BlardyHell,2012-04-17T17:59Z,"Worked fine!!!, except the notification on product activation.

Made me think it wasn't working for the initial first few days. But like UnderworldDemon666 said it's irrelevant"
,afryan,2012-04-20T02:46Z,works great!!!

Gracias! Thanks!!"
,VaderforprezAZ09,2012-04-21T04:12Z,"What makes me sad is that, to have torrents uploaded on here, someone has to actually buy the software... That violates two of my nonmoral codes."
,oweing121,2012-04-21T19:23Z,It's asking me for a product key. What do I do?
,UnderworldDemon666,2012-04-22T06:18Z,"@VaderforprezAZ09: Not always. In fact, this disk, was never purchased by me, or anyone I know. My sysadmin at my school gets all the new software for free because he knows a few guys. And he just passes them on to me.

@oweing121: Please read my other comment about the product key."

,rajputlad,2012-05-14T19:30Z,"Double thumbs up! Absolutely genuine.

@UnderworldDemon666: thanks a ton!"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-15T00:53Z,"yes maybe after so much searching i foudn it, first i download 86/64 bit then  i tried installing and couldn't. well it would have finish but it got stuck at like 75% for along time,  so i got inpatient, i have 32 bit so it wouldn't work anyway. i think. then i downloaded a 32 bit version and it turns out i didn't notice the "" france"" part of it so everytime i start it up it re does the files to english which is liek a new install so after all the time installing in french i am unistalling it and now going to download this correct version. thanks and i hope this works"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-15T01:28Z,"cool there is no extraction or mounting for quiker install, well mounting doesn't take much time but this is less confusing. i prefer mounting then extracting, random info lol, but i find out while mounting and then installing i get more errors or install seems longer, who knows i am a noob"
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-05-15T01:32Z,"longest ""flushing to disk ever"" is it fully downloaded?"
,bullbrandusa,2012-05-15T05:44Z,"Thank you UnderworldDemon666 for this. It was a perfect torrent. I did have a problem, but I figured It now? I am running Vista 32bit service pack 2. I clicked setup, and a pop up appeared with an error? It only works with Service pack 1. To solve this. Right click that set up, go to properties at the bottom, then compatibility. In compatibility mode check the box, scroll down, and find service pack 1, click OK, and start over. Works perfectly."
,ryoslayer,2012-05-19T19:51Z,"Underworld, after running setup.exe, what will I do to the other files that's in the folder of microsoft 2010? Is those files necessary? Or should I delete them? PLEASE REPLY. THANKS! =)"
,Starsplash_85,2012-05-20T03:27Z,"Works fine! I had some problems with the 2003 version. I have 2 account on my computer. One for me and one for the girlfriend. Everytime she open a Office program it ask for the PRO11.MSI-file, even when I choose that file it will not work. Tried to upgrade to this 2010 version and it works great, so far :) 

But do you have the file for the language pack? I would like to have the swedish one :) Don't wanna pay 245 SEK ($35) for just a swedish language pack."
,UnderworldDemon666,2012-05-28T15:38Z,"@Starsplash_85: Have you tried 2007's language packs? I did some searching, and it seems that 2007's language packs work with Office 2010. Try it out.

@ryoslayer: After the install, you can do whatever you want with the install files. If you are a true pirate, burn the files to a disk and pass it on to someone who needs it. Keep the files circulating.

@raindeuxx: When you receive the error ""Could not download because an important file is either missing or corrupted"", redownload. It means that either the download didn't finish completely, or someone seeding has messed with a file and you got a messed file.

@demonster: For people who have been instructed to download msxml 6.10.1129, make sure you do all system updates before trying to install."

I had a preinstalled MS office 2010 in my laptop before. Before installing this one, i uninstalled the preloaded and was successfully able to install this. But now if i go to open any MS file (excel, word etc) it agaiin takes me to the PREINSTALLED one where it says to activate, purchase or use (which it said when i bought the system). If i go All programs, MS Office, Excel and try to open the file it opens up. How do i get rid of this thing..."
