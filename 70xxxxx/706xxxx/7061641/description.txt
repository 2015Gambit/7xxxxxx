synopsis (EN)	Just Dance 3 gets more people on the dance floor than ever, as the franchise adds quartet play on top of its solo and duet options! The 49-song setlist serves up a mix of new and classic favorites. Dance to chart-topping tracks from Taio Cruz, Cee Lo Green, and Katy Perry with Snoop Dogg. Dial up throwback classics from Wilson Pickett, Donna Summer, and the Sugarhill Gang. Try out rotating challenges in new Smart Shuffle Mode or see if you can handle a blend of styles in Dance Mashup Mode. A new Wii-exclusive Flash Mob feature packs the dance floor even tighter - letting up to eight people dance together.
