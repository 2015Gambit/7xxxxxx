A set between MVP and Ret was missing in my torrent:

MLG_2012.Winter.Arena_Round2.Starcraft.2

This is the missing set.

If you save the torrent in the same directory as the main Round2 torrent, it should automatically place the file in the correct directory since I kept the directory structure identical. Hopefully this works!
