,maroonylife,2012-02-28T17:32Z,"Help please! 

I'm a frequent torrent user, and seed around 2,5gb every day(not fast internet connection). I'm having a problem for like the last 2 hours. Normally when I download a torrent, I click the link next to the 'Get this Torrent' link. Right now that link has disappeared, and it's not caused by the browser.

When I try the remaining link, the one called 'Get this torrent', it doesn't download the torrent file and it automatically opens utorrent program showing the list of files screen, tho no file is seen.

What can I do? I can't access torrent downloads right now."
,haidenn,2012-02-28T19:12Z,same thing is happening to me like maroonylife..... I fear something bad has happened....
,organicmtdew,2012-02-28T19:12Z,"@Maroonylife
TPB has been moving to eliminate .torrent files for some time now. The new default is Magnet files (hance the little magnet icon). I would be lying if I said I could tell you the functional difference when using them on a desktop (I've noticed no difference from mine); as a guy on the go, however, I suffer from no longer being able to use other people's computers (school library, your mom's house, etc.) to DL the .torrent and upload it to my Dropbox/Torrents folder, which my BT program auto-loads/deletes from.
If anybody has a suggestion for a workaround (not involving RDC) that would be great."
,organicmtdew,2012-02-28T19:14Z,"I know it is unnessicary, but I am a stickler for English for some reason, so: hance = hence."
,haidenn,2012-02-28T19:14Z,same thing is happening to me maroonylife..... I fear something bad has happened....
,marko8,2012-02-28T19:52Z,wtf is goin on with TBT? Noooo!
,keepcalm,2012-02-28T20:00Z,"Same thing's happening to me as well, fuck."
,jayskywalker,2012-02-28T20:16Z,@maroonylife magnet files take a while longer to start downloading. Have you tried waiting it out? 
,maroonylife,2012-02-28T20:19Z,"solved. watched some vieos and read some blogs and apparently, the way to go is patience. (I'm using utorrent) Simply click on the magnet link, you won't see any files show up that's normal. And let utorrent try to download it. It's supposed to get to a normal speed in about 3 minutes. After that it's normal torrent.

Just click on the magnet link, and click yes on utorrent, you can right click>don't download the files you don't want later on. system works :)"
,marko8,2012-02-28T20:22Z,"I use the magnet link on one mp3 file, and it's working,but no files to see like previously! Hm?"
,organicmtdew,2012-02-28T20:27Z,"You're not going to see the same list of tiles as you did with .torrents, but if you check the ""Files"" link on the torrents page (like this one) you'll see a list of what will be DLed, then you can de/select what you do/n't want after about 2 seconds of DLing, as you will have the list in your torrenting program."
,OVERLORD4253,2012-02-28T23:02Z,The site is switching to magnet files guys all the torrents well from now on be magnet files a little bit slower but it works just fine thats all that is happening the pirate bay admins for the last month started moving to magnet files gradually so starting today all torrents will be like this i read this somewhere on the internet a few weeks ago
,MiniNeil,2012-03-01T14:35Z,OMG WTF is this Fukin magnet?? I have to buy LimeWire???

And thanks to everyone else for the troubleshooting on the magnet stuff."
,Midorizes,2012-03-03T17:35Z,"@MiniNeil You don't have to buy anything, just click Get this torrent and click OK in your Bittorrent client."
,Cryptic19,2012-03-09T16:34Z,Awesome upload VTV love your work... but where is episode 15 and 17
,thepiratedude,2012-03-12T14:21Z,"How can this torrent ever has so many seeders? That rar-file is inaccaceble, when i go to the site i have to insert all my information and at the end i still don't get a password."
,LOLSOPA,2012-03-14T20:41Z,"@thepiratedude lol
