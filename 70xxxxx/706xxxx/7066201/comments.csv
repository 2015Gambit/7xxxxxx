However, I cant find any conclusive and clear infor mation on how to get from point A(jailbreaking my ps3) to point B (playing backups on my ps3) Any help would be greatly appreciated. And my ps3 is a throwaway, so before anyone comments on how ""If i don't know than i shouldn't do it"", understand that this is why i'm asking. To learn. Thank you. APWunters@live.com"

 are other methods to jailbreak your consol that includes some hardware knowledge by using modchips like Teensy++ or ProgSkeet. But you have to google for that or use this guide:
