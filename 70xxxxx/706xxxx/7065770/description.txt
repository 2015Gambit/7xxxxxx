TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Michelle Pfeiffer's character is forty years old in this movie, while the actress was actually forty-seven at the time of shooting. Her co-star Paul Rudd was thirty-six in real life, although his character was twenty-nine and played the role of a teenager in the TV show inside the movie. But perhaps most unbelievable was Stacey Dash, who plays a teenager in the show within the movie, but was forty years old at the time of production.

Norm MacDonald was originally cast as Rosie's ex-husband. According to MacDonald, he grew a bushy mustache for the role. When Amy Heckerling told him to shave it off, he quit the project. 

Although supposed to premiere in cinemas, this was released directly on DVD. 

Amy Heckerling's earlier movie Clueless starred Stacey Dash and Paul Rudd as teenagers; 12 years later in this movie, both Dash and Rudd play actors playing teenagers in the show within the movie.

PLOT: Rosie (40), a divorced mother, produces the has-been TV comedy You Go Girl. Her boss no longer allows the show to tackle any vaguely controversial subjects, so it seems doomed. Then she meets at an audition Adam Perl (29), an attractive, spontaneously funny, single actor. She successfully casts him, which revives the show's ratings. She also dates him, but her pathological insecurity, focused on their age difference, compromises the relationship. That culminates when she suspects him of infidelity with the show's star, and the studio gives those two their own sitcom. 


Director:Amy Heckerling
Stars:           Michelle Pfeiffer, Paul Rudd and Saoirse Ronan
