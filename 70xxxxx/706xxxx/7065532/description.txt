- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  Kutless has continued to make massive impacts in the last several years being
  awarded RIAA Gold Certification for their worship-based album "Strong Tower,"
  in addition to Gold Certification for Long-Form video "Live From Portland."
  With their most recent album, "It Is Well," Kutless reached the top of the
  charts with their hit song "What Faith Can Do." Already a hit single in 2009,
  the success carried into 2010 as this single topped the 2010 Mediabase
  Christian AC Song of the Year. In addition to Mediabase, "What Faith Can Do"
  was the No. 2 Billboard Hot Christian Song of the Year. Kutless was also named
  the No. 7 Billboard Christian Artist of the Year, and "It Is Well" was the No.
  10 Billboard Christian Album of the Year. February 2012 brings the release of
  the band's new album "Believer" and continues to press them further into the
  AC/CHR market, growing their consumer reach with songs that transcend
  listeners. This album was produced by Dave Lubben (producer of It Is Well) and
  Christopher Stevens/ David Garcia (Mandisa, Sanctus Real, TobyMac). The first
  single "Carry Me To The Cross" is a worshipful cry and reminder about God's
  never-ending faithfulness and grace.
