Jesse Ferguson's second album, The Parting Glass gathers Irish, Scottish, Canadian and American folk songs that recount the various partings people have and still must endure, from leaving oneâ€™s country to losing a loved one. Jesseâ€™s own song, â€œThe Sun Set on My Love,â€ attempts to honour and extend this tradition. 
On this CD Jesse performed all vocals, including harmonies, and instrumentals, including guitar, mandolin, fiddle, bodhran, djembe, tambourine, fife, penny whistle, harmonica, Jewâ€™s harp and rhythm bones. He also recorded, mixed and mastered the songs on Mixcraft 5, and he designed the covers of the album. The album was a labour of love, and it covers a broad spectrum from slow ballads to rollicking sea shanties and drinking songs.
