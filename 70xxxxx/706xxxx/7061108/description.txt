Fictional Band from the TV show FRINGE!

You may remember from second seasonâ€™s â€œNorthwest Passageâ€ episode that Walter has one of Violet Sedan Chairâ€™s albums (â€œSeven Sunsâ€) in his stash:

According to TV Line, the album has been in select independent record outlets â€œfor a couple of months nowâ€. The kicker is that each individual album is different and apparently includes specific â€˜spoilers and clues about the show in its lyrics â€” and possibly elsewhereâ€™.
