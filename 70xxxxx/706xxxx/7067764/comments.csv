,kanelstav,2012-03-01T23:01Z,"I say like The Pirate Bay says themselves:
ÂľTorrent www.utorrent.com
Has always worked, will always work."
,peacetin,2012-03-02T04:39Z,"Utorrent has always been safe for me, bt use peerblock and an ipfilter add on as well.  I get e mails some times without peerblock on."
,xDave,2012-03-02T14:33Z,"Why is everything in .mp4 what happened??
Guys bring back .avi"
,fire_eyes7,2012-03-02T20:38Z,smaller file sizes 
,RaiKageSage,2012-03-02T21:59Z,"Enough about this Magnet link bullshit, just use ÂľTorrent www.utorrent.com. Now someone tell me if this show is any good?!"
,madmarkus,2012-03-02T23:35Z,".mp4??? I tried the latest ep of Justified and while the video as fine the audio was out of sync all the time. 

I'll give this a try anyway. "
,MJE55,2012-03-03T03:19Z,Sound out of sync by quite a bit.   -3400ms. So far I'm finding sound sync problems a lot with these mp4s. Either that or the audio is jerky full screen and only plays ok reduced size. The reduced file size so far is coming nowhere near being an advantage when I have to piss around trying to get the sound to sync. 
,MC_COCADA,2012-03-03T06:35Z,Utorrent can be used do download magnetic Torrents.
,raynrev,2012-03-04T02:09Z,Audio's out of sync. POS .mp4 can rot in hell.
,sputnikwood,2012-03-04T10:19Z,"@ snooke35

use utorrent. when you click on it, nothing will seem to appear within utorrent. you will have to wait for utorrent to download the magnet file (usually takes about 10 seconds)...and then the files will appear under Files tab in utorrent."

Long live magnet links & mp4's!"

,slyxxone,2012-03-16T17:47Z,"@ MJE55, thx for the sync info, to anyone else , if using Media player classic, Go to Options->Audio->Audio time shift : -3400"
,Oxyfire,2012-03-17T09:33Z,"mp4 is the future if you're getting out of sync audio or stuttering video its your equipment thats no good not the file format.

You can buy a media player off amazon for $28 problem solved"
,MyFootHurts,2012-03-29T14:40Z,"Baddies stop crying for avi, it's finally dying it's fucking old shit. If these guys are uploading out of sync files that's cos they're shit, not the format.

Fucking avi crybabies piss me off too much what is this."
,MyFootHurts,2012-04-02T11:58Z,"Oh and I watched it, it wasn't out of sync at all. Guess some people just need to get a clue."
,JuliaanLauwers,2012-04-04T00:58Z,"Thanks for sharing, .mp4 is a lot better than .avi"
