This is my 10th official SC-SDH release since TNA Impact HDTV 2009-05-28 XviD-AT-SDH that was uploaded by AhsokaTano and I have decided to return to capturing and encoding and uploading and I hope everyone appeciates my time and effort put into doing this each and every week. I don\'t have to do this. I am only doing it as a favor to the wrestling fans around the world who appreciated my efforts in the past (2005-2009) here on The Pirate Bay to bring wrestling to the fans from the fans. 


To all you haters out there you should Know Your Role and Shut Your Mouth otherwise I\'ll be forced to put Boots 2 Asses to you haters because I\'m not going away anytime soon and that\'s the bottomline cause StoneCold420 said so!!!
