I am not done downloading yet but one I am I will post another comment with my opinion on the torrent. 
Only thing I can say right now is that its really slow to download!   24 hours = 41%  for me"

,B-B-C,2012-05-21T09:01Z,"Is this a Discovery version? (who is narrating?)
Could you include the commentaries also?"
,lattari,2012-07-21T23:06Z,"I'm at a dilemma. This verison has the original audio but the video is not as good as the dutch release. The dutch, in their infinite wisdom, uploaded a 1080p verison with 2 channel ac3 audio. When I rise the to power such nonsense will not be tolerated. Now I really don't know which one to download."
,lattari,2012-07-21T23:15Z,"I'm going to go with this one. The dutch opening epiode is also 10 minutes shorter than here. The diffrence in video can only be noticed if you focus for really on everuthing that might be wrong. 

If I ever can afford a sound system again I'll enjoy the audio. Thank you for putting this up!"
,enonumus,2012-08-23T22:15Z,"A10/V10 - Amazing quality

Be aware that this is the BBC version that aired in the U.K., so the narrator is British and the script is different from the Discovery version that aired in the U.S..  The basic story is essentially the same and the footage is very similar, but if you're from the U.S. you probably won't enjoy this version nearly as much as the Discovery version.  Either way, the footage is amazing and highly recommend watching whichever version you prefer."
