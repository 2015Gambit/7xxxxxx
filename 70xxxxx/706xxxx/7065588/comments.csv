,CZKryten,2012-02-29T12:21Z,"Missing photos 25, 42 and 46. Any chance to upload them somewhere?"
,jaycantrell,2012-02-29T13:56Z,"If you're using Firefox, go ahead and click the ""Get This Torrent"" link. It will ask you which application you wish to use to open the torrent.

Select your torrent client (uTorrent, TorrentBit, whatever). The download might appear as 0 MB in the download screen but it works OK once you start the torrent.

Hope that helps."

@thim0053:
Why don't you use uTorrent then like 95 % of us do ? It's so simple with uTorrent. Only 1st time your Chrome/Firefox/Opera might ask what program to use - then after installing uTorrent of course, you just tell your browser (if it asks) that you will use uTorrent for magnet links. Ok ? Try now and please tell here if this helped you (to help others with same problem) ?"
,slowquin,2012-03-01T15:04Z,The so called missing pictures wasn't included in the member section. I guess it was just an anomaly. My theory is that the pictures were corrupt in some way. I should have given you folks a heads-up.
