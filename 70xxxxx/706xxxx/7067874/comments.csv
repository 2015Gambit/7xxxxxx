,Ruby_pirate,2012-03-02T15:54Z,"johnstar, I have the same problems as detta and I can't find the ''associate with magnet urls'' on utorrent. Do u know what can I do? Thanks :)"
,dettta,2012-03-03T05:14Z,"@ johnstar- I can't  see any heading that says associate with urls, and I doubt that it will suddenly become 'unchecked' by itself, because it was working fine just 2 days ago! 
@zizajkovski - yeah im doing that, but i hope this is a temporary solution! btw can u download in u torrent using the hash info like in tixati??"

,naeem.63,2012-03-06T12:20Z,U see People Like AVi formats more than MP4......its compatible with all phones....and most of the viewers watch series on on handheld devices like phones blackberry pda tabs pads n pcs.........
,Belvin123,2012-03-08T08:59Z,You cant download this with utorrent because TPB uses now only magnet links. Just install BitComet and you will be able to download again.

,skyline3d,2012-03-11T18:10Z,Please stop using Xvid and encode with h264 codec! quality and motion in Xvid is much lower than h264
