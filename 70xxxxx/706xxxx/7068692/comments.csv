,tijnonlijn,2012-03-01T16:39Z,"3.55 TB Patch is included, as you can see in the title"
,Alanz2223,2012-03-03T19:54Z,How can I play this? Please reply I need help..What can I download?
,tijnonlijn,2012-03-04T17:02Z,"Alanz2223

Get a v 3.55 ps3 or download, get a true blue dongle, get tb cfw, copy blus to external hdd, replace eboot.bin and param.sfo with cracked onces by paradox, copy 1.02 update to external and run update, install multiman, play! anything else?"
,.Korpiklaani.,2012-03-06T13:37Z,"huh,sound very complicated....i hope i can do it"
,.Korpiklaani.,2012-03-07T20:38Z,"tijnonlijn,can you tell me if you experienced lag problems while playing? like to when is many creatures around or bcs of heavier spells cast? i saw some people having problems with it?"
,tijnonlijn,2012-03-07T23:00Z,"its running from an internal ssd in my ps3 but i do experience a tiny bit of lag, but its very very minimal. got problems?"
,.Korpiklaani.,2012-03-13T13:30Z,"i ll play it in 2 months,when i buy ps3,im low on cash right now. just wanted to know,i heard there is no lag on xbox however,but im die hard ps fan,so i wanted your opinion on that. little lag is nothing,i finished dl-ing,so,cant wait to try it out!"
,atengk9,2012-03-14T08:16Z,"awesome tijnonlijn!
tq for uploading. "
,tijnonlijn,2012-03-19T20:51Z,"Running this isn't easy .Korpiklaani. as you need a PS3 with firmware 3.55, which is from more than a year ago, and additional hardware.  When you buy a new PS3 you'll find it ""uncrackable"" and therefor unable to run games the unofficial way. You'll have to buy the game, but it's worth buying."
,naldoloko,2012-03-22T03:17Z,"Hi tijnonlijn. D you know why i get 80029519 error initialization when i try to start the game? i followed all the instruction.. multiman is loading the game, the icon appears in the games menu, but when i try to start this (""X""), returns the error.. can u helpme? thanksss!!"
,tijnonlijn,2012-03-25T22:38Z,"@naldoloko

Try these options: Delete the update and try running it and copy the game to internal HD. If it still doesn't work, go to game options in multiman (press square when skyrim is selected) en uncheck all boxes below the cover art exept Game Disk. Try running again and let me know if it works."
,.Korpiklaani.,2012-03-30T18:55Z,how you mean uncrackable? ill just downgrade it to 3.55.
,Dragzx,2012-04-02T17:53Z,"Is it possible to play this only with multiman and cfw 3.55? because i dont want to buy true blue dongle, i have a jailbreaked console, so is there a way to play without true blue dongle and only with multiman and cfw. please tell me what to do, cause i waited lot for this to dload and wanna get this running, please tell me steps. thanks! :)"
,tijnonlijn,2012-04-04T13:39Z,".Korpiklaani.

Yes, if you want to buy $80,- E3 flasher and $60,- TB to play a $50,- game without support you can. "
,tijnonlijn,2012-04-04T13:41Z,"@Dragzx

You need true blue, dont ask for things you already know"
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-04-04T19:06Z,"Why do people keep asking stupid questions? Nobody can read or what? This game is for true blue dongle, it's even stated in the title, if you don't want to buy true blue then just update ps3 and buy the game, or else wait for a 3.55 patch or newer CF.  "
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-04-12T14:18Z,"By the way, the game is working perfectly."
,bradyo,2012-04-21T02:06Z,"this is way to buggy without the latest updates... its almost unplayable....

real OFW users are on like 2.03

there has been like 20+ updates for the game.... 

if you are using a clone dongle (jb2usb) you will not be able to use the 1.02 update... and its basically completly unplayable... if you have a real true blue dongle its tollerable."
,tijnonlijn,2012-04-24T10:19Z,"@bradyo

there has been 6 updates, not 20+. 
jb2usb can't play 1.2 update, true. 
if you want the support, buy the game.
after 74 hours im still without lag."
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-05-08T09:02Z,"To the people saying it's buggy, I'm on level 15, many hours already into it, I only had one single freeze. Everything is smooth, the best way is to deactivate the autosaving, there's not a single slowdown now, even the loadings are fast. Hell, even the console is whisper quiet, can't tell is on."
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-05-08T09:04Z,"Oh another thing, this game is a must, I am really impressed with the scale, graphics, things to do, and in some dungeons the graphics are even better than uncharted 3. The sound is impressive also, with a good set of headphones."
,danielkk82,2012-05-26T22:24Z,Ugh this is being a pain in the ass.. ive never dowloded a game from here that wasnt for pc... i have this dowloaded whats the next step for me to do?
,tijnonlijn,2012-05-28T23:52Z,"danielkk82

You are officially the most stupid person ever. Dont download stuff you dont understand. "
,monaks98,2012-05-31T14:26Z,"i cant start the game. it says "" an error occured during start operation (80010009).
i have a v 3.55 ps3 and multiman and replaced eboot.bin and param.sfo with cracked onces by paradox. but i dont know how to run update. i copied the 1.02 update to external but i cant see it. i can see skyrim but not the update. i copied the folder to the external and i also copied the file outside the folder to be sure but its not showing up wen i look at it in multiman."
,monaks98,2012-05-31T14:47Z,i found the update in install package files and updated it but it still says an error ouccured during start operation but instead of (80010009) it now says (80029519).
,monaks98,2012-05-31T14:54Z,only skyrim doesnt start. my other games start normally and have no problems
,spystone,2012-06-01T16:31Z,it need true blue dongle or not? :S pls quick answer!
,monaks98,2012-06-03T13:22Z,I'm not sure if I have true blue dongle but I copied a game that was already on the ps3 and played it in the external and it worked. How do know if the external has true blue or not.i dont know what tru blue dongle does but maybe I have true blue dongle
,tijnonlijn,2012-06-15T15:05Z,"@monaks98

....I'm preeeetty sure you don't have it.
Stupid idiots."
,cunamis,2012-08-03T14:44Z,There is a fix for 3.55 now no tb
,wattaman,2012-08-09T05:11Z,"@vitor.fernandes1983 that's because:

1. you're much smarter then everyone else here (I personally doubt that)

2. not everyone is a NERD, PS3 GEEK WITH NO PERSONAL LIFE so... not everyone knows what a f$%6ng ""blue dongle"" is. Capisci?"
,jmessilva,2012-08-10T06:35Z,"Alright, for those without TB;

,2FnFast,2012-08-15T19:11Z,"@jmessilva
tried this method and can confirm that it works
I installed the big file ~95mb followed by the 10mb one
running kmeaw 3.55 CFW, no TB dongle"
,8deez8,2012-08-16T00:06Z,ive got a cobra dongle will that work?
,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-08-22T19:57Z,"Can't get it to work.  I did exactly as described - copied to internal HDD, installed official patch, installed fix patch, then ran it as normal.

It just hangs on the logo after I click ""New Game.""  I get nothing.

It did ask me, when I first loaded it, something about how it requires FW 3.72, and do I want to change something to 3.55, and I said yes.

And, when I start the game itself, it says ""No default string. Must be loaded from INIFile.""  I click ""OK"" and it loads from there.

So guys, what did I do wrong?  And how do I fix it?"
,hedake,2012-08-23T03:59Z,"@Tabascao

Did you find a fix for the problem you are having? I am having the exact same thing happen to me."
,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-08-26T19:58Z,"Nope.  I even uninstalled everything and started from scratch - this time I tried saying ""No"" to the thing MultiMAN gives (I think it said ""Do you want to change PARAM.INFO from 3.72 to 3.55""), and it wouldn't even try to start; I also installed the .pkg files *after* loading the game up in MultiMAN, instead of installing them before like last time.

Still get the same error, still can't get past the ""New Game"" screen.  How the hell did everyone else get this to work?!"
,92Leena,2012-09-23T10:55Z,"To those people who have the ""No default string. Must be loaded from INIFile."" + screen hang when starting a new game, you need to have a disc on your ps3 and check the bd option on multiman when running this game. After mounting this with bd option turned on on multiman, you need to run this game via the disc icon on xmb, NOT ON APP/HOME/PS3_GAME/."
,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-09-27T20:50Z,"That's great for people who have working disc drives, but I don't.  So what am I supposed to do?"
