Nirvana was an American rock band that was formed by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic 
in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being 
Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.


In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American grunge band Nirvana, released on September 13, 1993
on DGC Records. Nirvana intended the record to diverge significantly from the polished production of its previous 
album, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired producer Steve Albini to 
record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The 
music was recorded quickly with few studio embellishments, and the song lyrics and album packaging incorporated 
medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's 
newfound fame.
