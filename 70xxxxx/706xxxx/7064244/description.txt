Details:
Since he debuted in 2006, Surkin has homed in on a style that balances old school house flavor with the hard-hitting sound of fellow Parisian producers like Busy P or SebastiAn. It's this combination that characterizes USA, a stomping electro album that features vocal appearances from Ann Saunderson of Inner City and Kevin Irving, who sang on the Marshall Jefferson classic "Move Your Body." The album was originally slated for release on Institubes, the recently-defunct French label that released all but one of Surkin's other records, but will now see release on Marble, an imprint Surkin runs with Para One and Bobmo.
