Well Gang here we go with part 3 of a collection of Music Video's to perhaps add to your Saint Patrick Night's line up.   This time it is the turn of Mary Duff and two delightful concerts, on recorded at An Grianan Theatre, Letterkenny and the second (The one with the catwalk) in the Famous Aberdeen Beach Ballroom,  Aye my home town, or should I say Toon ;-)

Not only did I see Mary Duff there that night but in 1963 I saw the Beatles perform live in the very same venue.   Anyway number 3 is this series of 5.   Enjoy World, Oh and North American's please note that country & western is still exactly as it should be back in the 'old country' as you will see.

For the track listing please look at the torrent files.   All 4:3 Ratio colour.
