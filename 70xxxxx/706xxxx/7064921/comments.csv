,bryentheartist,2012-02-29T02:34Z,can we get s9 e8
[T],theburningbush,2012-02-29T03:29Z,"WOW, bryentheartist, I'm surprised that s09e08 was never UL'd here. demonoid doesn't have it either.

I only waited about a day last week for a torrent and then DL'd it from here:
http://rapidmoviez.com/r/shameless-9x08-hdtv-xvid-fov-rapidshare-extabit-uploaded-shareonline

If my UL speed wasn't so bad (240 Kbps), I'd UL it here myself."
