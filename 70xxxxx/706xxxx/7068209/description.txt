The TRANSiENCE release suffers from jerky 
playback throughout. We are not sure if 
this is from either bad deinterlace, or 
an improper VFR encoding/muxing. This 
show is not hybrid and therefore VFR 
should not be used.  

We also went with crf 22 as the rules
still have no clear definition as to 
what qualifies as plain reality versus
competitive reality.
