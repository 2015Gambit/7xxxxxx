Quote:
It is the dawn of World War I, and Sherlock Holmes has been dead for 20 years. Holmesâ€™ enemy â€” Professor James Moriarty â€” is a lost man. MI5 blackmails Moriarty into finding Holmes' long-lost brother, Mycroft, but what at first appears to be a routine case leads to a web of intrigue that involves a psychic box and its creator, a woman from Moriartyâ€™s past, and a new villain that threatens to be greater than Moriarty ever was!

In the wake of The Dark Chamber, Professor Moriarty finds himself afflicted with unsettling visions. He sets sail for Burma in search of an old ally, but finds himself caught up in a city on the brink of revolt, a troublesome Imperial Policeman, and a secret that holds the key to his destiny.
