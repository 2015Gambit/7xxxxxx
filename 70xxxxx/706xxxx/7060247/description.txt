Description:
As a young child Luther The Geek or "The Freak" witnesses a band of men goading a geek (a man who bites off chicken's heads and drinks the blood) into performing. In the ensuing hullabaloo, Luther bites his lip and likes the taste of blood. Flash forward some thirty years and a parole board is meeting to discuss Luther's release. It seems the cheeky blighter has been murdering folk in the meantime. A dopey parole board trainee sides with the liberals and so Luther is unleashed, except now he has a special pair of customised metal teeth. Luther then proceeds to "bite the heads off" of many hapless folk until the tense ending. This movie is most notable for it's bare dialogue, whole stretches pass without a sound. Most of the audio is composed of Luther clucking insanely like a chicken. The film is centred around a farm and the mother and daughter who live there. Other main characters include the daughter's dumb boyfriend and an inefficient local law officer.
