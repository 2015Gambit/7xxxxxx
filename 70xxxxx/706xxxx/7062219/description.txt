                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 Nurseries and childminders are costing some families up to a third of their 
 income, and working mums are feeling squeezed out of the workplace. Shelley 
 Jofre investigates the rising cost of childcare, meeting a family who moved 
 abroad for a better deal, and revealing why a group of Yorkshire parents is 
 considering taking over the running of a nursery which has been earmarked for 
 closure.
