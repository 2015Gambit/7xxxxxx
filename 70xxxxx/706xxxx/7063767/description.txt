This is Peter Schrag's shocking book Mind Control (1978) which looks at how the entire field of psychology/psychiatry was developed and is used as an agent of control and repression, particularly through the use of behavior control drugs. Thoroughly documented it focuses on abuses in use of psychosurgery, electric shock and wide spread use of drugs. The fascinating aspect about many horror stories coming from patients is that the brutalities are not committed by Gestapo policemen or prison guards but by those in the so-called "helping professions". They are involved in experiments on human beings that are repugnant to most citizens and are indeed criminal in nature. The behaviour industry still blames the criminality of human beings on their genetical or biological inferiority. Criminals are said to be inflicted with some mysterious brain disorder and need to be treated accordingly. Similar excuses are found everywhere else with the drug industry conveniently producing a new drug for all the invented "diseases" of the human mind. Find out how it all began and how we ended to be the most drugged and mind-controlled society in history. 330 pages. A must read for everyone.
