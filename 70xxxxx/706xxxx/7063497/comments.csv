also how is the size 80 mb if the Mac App Store version is 90 mb?"
,FatFreddy462,2012-02-29T06:59Z,On the App Store is the Version 1.0.3 so the version 1.0.3 is bigger than 1.0.1 because 1.0.3 has more airport. For the problem you need to have mac os x 10.6.6 or later and you have to place the app in the application folder.
,FatFreddy462,2012-02-29T08:00Z,this app is precracked
