,baitman88,2012-03-02T00:30Z,yea magnet links are garbage...  I have always been up to date on utorrent (currently 3.1.2) and it still doesnt work
,Frazier15,2012-03-02T03:04Z,So i'm not the only one with magnet problems... How do you get the torrent file?
,moonieyam,2012-03-02T07:53Z,"lol, my utorrent is working perfectly with the magnet links. i don't know how you guys would screw up yours. it's a click easier"
,iMars666,2012-03-02T15:57Z,"How do you People have trouble with Magnet links? Just click the ""Get This Torrent"" and it will open in utorrent (if thats your torrent application) If you had installed uTorrent correctly there should be no problems.

Complaining about Magnet links is not going to bring back .torrent files. If you can't figure out how to download a Torrent w/ Magnet links then you shouldn't be downloading period."

Open your uTorrent client, go to the preference (pressing Ctrl+P), in ""GENERAL"" press the ""Associate with magnet URI"" and try magnet link again!"
,lmfao20,2012-03-03T05:34Z,thx for the download !
,deaderweterdog,2012-03-03T06:46Z,magnet liks work for me and my utorrents not updated but i still think there garbage you cant pick what files you download piratebay has been the best for years but if thay are going to throw the baby out with the bathwatter i hope another site takes there place soon
,iamandre,2012-03-03T20:01Z,"@ deaderweterdog
You can still pick which files to DL and which to leave out, you just gotta load the magnet link, then give it a few seconds to download all the torrent info, and viola! pick away."
,elitecrusher,2012-03-04T05:50Z,"Yeah dont click on any updates for your torrent downloader, because i made that mistake and it blocked me from downloading so i switched to Bit torrent. Had no choice! Nothing work after trying a few tricks"

,KOLZ,2012-03-05T11:22Z,@TheAsset  I bet you are dumb ass naggar. ;) I am on pc and had no issue what so ever downloading this file in my first click. So...Keep your piece of shit mac that can't ever play new games and does everything else that a pc can do. Try to keep up if you can because video editing isn't the only thing people do. ;)

,funseeker521,2012-03-10T18:06Z,I have an ancient PC that won't allow me to update utorrent (error msg.) and still the magnet links work perfectly. Only problem is when I click on hot girl to the far right she does not take her clothes off or ask me to fuck! Apparently she can say no. LOL!

,Toadizzle,2012-03-13T02:34Z,"The magnet link works, that is not the problem. The problem is its not letting us pick what out of the file we want to download."
,sonny1960,2012-03-14T08:41Z,Thanks for the up. Will seed
,Dorell,2012-03-18T21:12Z,"One has to be a big time moron , not to know how to use magnetic links , c'mon , go on the net and find out, don't just complain here , lazy inbreeds !!! Just one click and it's downloading , you dope heads !!!
Thanks uploader , and ignore the incompetent ones !!"
,ShdwSeeker,2012-03-19T00:46Z,"thanks for the upload! decent quality, but nothing spectacular. great for just catching the flick."
,resmith,2012-03-31T06:52Z,Dorell I have the same problem as others & am not new at torrents so don't be so smug & if you have an answer to Toadizzle just type it out instead of being a jerk off! I have the same issue & have spent hours trying to resolve the issue without any luck. It takes less time to type the answer than to be an idiot. See if you can answer it or if you don't know join the club & stop pretending.

,huegart,2012-05-11T00:26Z,so u fucking faggets how the movie
,nerdrage12,2012-05-25T19:02Z,"@huegart, watch it and decide for yourself you fucking faggot."
,voice-of-reason,2012-05-29T07:59Z,got a threatening letter from comcast for this one thanks AbSurdiTy
,PrototypeR,2012-05-31T15:04Z,V:7. A:6.5. Good enough!
,Zellonous,2012-09-16T22:49Z,"Ok. Right-click ""GET THIS TORRENT"". Select ""COPY LINK ADDRESS"". Open uTorrent (Probably works in others) and click ""ADD TORRENT FROM URL"". The link should already be copied to the text field. If not, Right-click ""PASTE"". Click ""OK"". 

This should work. Works for me."
,Zellonous,2012-09-16T22:50Z,"Oh. I use Opera. So, mine says ""COPY LINK ADDRESS"". Other browsers might say something different."
,Zellonous,2012-09-17T00:56Z,"Oh. I forgot something else. This also works for Transmission, which is how I learned to do this. Left-clicking the magnet link never made Transmission do what it was supposed to. The method I have mentioned works for it, though."
