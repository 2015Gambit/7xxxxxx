,C.Warren44,2012-02-29T01:17Z,"I installed this and it was fucked up, I have a Dell Optiplex 745, this has been majorly modified with some crap. Installs things at the end via the CMD application. Can't do anything with it as you cannot be the administrator. AVOID. Simple. Use at your own risk."

,roy2646,2012-02-29T04:43Z,it means installation of my own application is not possible if i will not be an administrator? is that what you mean mate?
,hackertoll,2012-02-29T06:07Z,thanks Bestboyby excellent work for me to be working perfectly as administrator
,lafaw77,2012-02-29T09:38Z,It is good with windows you can not create the account goes on as administrator even if you create an account
,Typhoon2000,2012-02-29T10:19Z,"Win XP Pofissional?

Thanks, but I think I will download from somebody else."
,C.Warren44,2012-02-29T12:14Z,"Nah serious, when the desktop comes on and you click internet explorer, it pops up but with no webpage, when you try to click tools it tells you to contact system admin. Dead links also on desktop from firefox when firefox isnt even installed. By all means go ahead and try it, but I needed this for my dell pc so I haven't gotta fuck around with any cracks or patches. I appreciate the effort though. I can and have done better before, when you use nLite correctly you can install all available updates and service packs without modifying anything else, so it is stull untouched."
,C.Warren44,2012-02-29T12:16Z,yes roy2646 that's what I meant
,lafaw77,2012-03-01T16:16Z,where do I get the latest updates if I want to add all updates?
,isad,2012-03-02T10:22Z,"Hi everybody, H have a Dell inspiron N5010, Is this will work for me??"
,roy2646,2012-03-04T21:31Z,"@ isad, didn't you see the comment of C.Warren44? That if you are going to use this OS into your pc, you can't install any application of your own because you will not be an administrator at your own PC? "
,C.Warren44,2012-03-06T15:00Z,"True @roy2646

Anytime I tried to do anything it told me to contact system administrator. No webpage comes up also when clicking internet explorer, can't get chrome because it asks to be admin. Can't create new user because...you guessed it...you have to be admin :("
