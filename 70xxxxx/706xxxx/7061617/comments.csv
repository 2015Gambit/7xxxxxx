,martinalex,2012-02-28T01:51Z,"There is no Antiviral software that does not slow down our computers and SYMANTEC is well known of his products to slow our systems dow quite much so consider guys if we really need antiviral software on our Macs from THIS company.
If you think, you really need antivirus software, I would recommend this one that is FREE, light and fast: http://www.clamxav.com/."
[T],nobody2007,2012-02-28T07:50Z,"I agree with @martinalex ... do you need AV really use clamxav or the free version of SOPHOS Antiv-Virus ... it's fast, stable and works great in the background

The biggest virus on a Mac is Norton Anti Virus - made by SYMANTEC!!"
