,kisinan,2012-03-01T05:52Z,"when i go to download it, it says the file size is 0 ... am i doing something wrong?"
,iggypop7,2012-03-01T06:17Z,"@kisinan: Wait until the download actually starts, with magnet links it usually takes a minute to get the file info."
,jaraujo,2012-03-01T06:28Z,"Why can't I download the torrent I used to use the 2 down arrows icon, but its not there anymore... Help please."
,tvobsessed,2012-03-01T06:36Z,What's with all the MP4 files recently? My TV only plays avi!!!!
,rgjjgr,2012-03-01T06:52Z,"whats this mp4 shit, what happened to avi files? "

,melbcro,2012-03-01T07:30Z,mp4's Suck!
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2012-03-01T08:15Z,"Hi VTV,

Thanks for your great work on all the UL's I watch-great quality !!

Though the process has changed I can still DL thanks to Bit Torrent.

Again, thank you !!!"
,dramakeen,2012-03-01T08:22Z,"WTH is going on with all the mp4 downloads?? Everything seems to be in this format. Can't access them on the tv as it doesn't read them. PLEASE change them back to avi, or people will find else where to DL them!"
,bala2012,2012-03-01T08:42Z,THANKS A LOT
,fillinthisspace,2012-03-01T13:02Z,"A slightly higher resolution and the video quality is at least as good as the standard AVI version, but it's 100MB smaller.
Even my phone plays MP4s."
,seancl,2012-03-01T14:32Z,Why the mp4s.  Useless for downloading onto a disc and watching on tv
,wenex,2012-03-01T14:50Z,"I can't believe people. Change them back to avi's or you'll find other places to download them? Seriously? What, are we paying customers or something? ""I'm going to take my business elsewhere!"" Jesus. Download one of the dozens of video converters up on tpb or elsewhere to convert them back to avi's if you can't manage mp4's. It's easy and fast.

Thank you VTV! I don't even search for shows anymore, I just come straight to you. Much gratitude!"
,lovecat66,2012-03-01T15:01Z,"Why are we forced to this shit ""Magnetlink"" ?! Where the hell is the NORMAL torrent link ????"
