,Raynmunin,2012-02-28T06:51Z,"Knock it off with these shitty mp4 or whatever torrents they're always screwed up, making me look for OTHER people to download from instead of your ass. Quality of your shit is going down hill these days."
,pussygal,2012-02-28T08:24Z,"Hey, I don't burn the files. I watch them only with VLC. So, .mp4 takes up less space, and has better video quality. Some episodes of .avi shows are quite bad on a bigger screen, but this is much better."
,Mel1417,2012-02-28T08:57Z,"Really disappointed with the downward spiral you guys are on lately, eztv use to be the best, I didn't look anywhere else, I just came here. But now I am being forced to go elsewhere because of these shithouse mp4's. I greatly appreciate all your previous uploads but I think I will be going else where from now on :("
,FlockOfSheep,2012-02-28T09:11Z,Love the new .mp4 formats!! I hope you never ever switch back to .avi again!! Thanks eztv!!
,Xorakka,2012-02-28T09:36Z,Haters gonna hate. Lovers gonna love.
,Trogdor8freebird,2012-02-28T10:28Z,"Teenagers are so picky these days damn.
Just be thankful that we can even have these for free off of pirating sites."
,MasinaacFTN,2012-02-28T10:45Z,thx for the ep...
,element7x,2012-02-28T11:28Z,Why don't you guys get with the new technology. MP4 is the superior format. If you need an easy way to watch them; download K-Lite Codec Pack!
,DiabloTheCritic,2012-02-28T12:14Z,"If the whiners don't like it don't download it doesn't get any more simple than that. Works great on my Sony 36"" LED TV. Once again thx extv for great & prompt downloads."
,Tuckle,2012-02-28T12:32Z,"""omg, these free files than someone spends all their time uploading for me so I can watch them when I want doesn't use the format that I want, since I refuse to get with the times and get a new media player"".  "
,raevynlunatique,2012-02-28T13:14Z,Just a quick question (cuz I'm a dweeb and don't know)...can these files be put on a thumb drive and played on a Bluray player as easily as the AVI files can?
,TheAslan,2012-02-28T21:37Z,"Magnificent quality under 270mb video!! The best quality I've ever seen in my Castle history, please don't go back for .avi, keep making .mp4 instead!!

And sound is perfectly balanced, watched with VLC

+1000"
,ty_uppers,2012-02-29T00:27Z,"I watch downloads via PS3. More than half the time my PS3 doesn't recognize the mp4 format. I used to prefer your downloads to others, but I now avoid them. Thank you for your efforts, and the years of enjoyment you have given me, but I am sad to now go elsewhere."
,Malum95,2012-02-29T08:36Z,"whats everyones beef with mp4? It's the same quality on your 22"" widescreen monitor, the only difference is on a huge TV, which by the way generaly, MP4 is better. + size is small, I think you people just hate change. Next you will cry about no .torrent files"
,monkey16,2012-03-02T22:31Z,"@Mel1417 and other whiners: ""shithouse mp4""?!! LMAO! 

AVI is an old, craptastic system. x264/AVC is the latest standard which is vastly better than the lousy AVI standard (true, it was good once.. but that was an aeon ago!).

Wake up dumbass! You think these groups/teams (EZTV and others), who've been churning out tonnes of torrents of you to enjoy, DAILY, don't have a clue about which format is better??! They know their shit, it's about time you did yours - go do some research before mouthing off here.. ""downward spiral"" apparently. LOL!

Didn't you freaking notice the vast improvement in the video's quality (mind you, with an even SMALLER FILE SIZE) over the AVI video's of old?!!"
,theflameguy92,2012-03-10T05:49Z,Most truted torrent and definitely the best too. Thanx eztv!!!
