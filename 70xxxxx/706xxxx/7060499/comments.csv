I am just doing my small part to share Buckeye related files with the rest of The Buckeye Nation and former Capital ""C"" residents who do not have access to local reports such as the PDF I post every day. Thanks for your reply. Just trying to share with the rest of the world B-4 governments stop allowing BT like the file sharing sites that they are shutting down. BTJunkie went off-line last week due to all the pressure. Very sorry to see another BT site give in."
