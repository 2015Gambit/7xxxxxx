,Evilution,2012-03-01T07:11Z,"@brigzy If you looked at what you click on, you would have seen that magnet and torrents swapped places on TPB a while ago, and they announced that they will go only magnet, and that is what they have done now.
Update your torrentclient/get one that supports magnet! uTorrent works. Vuze should probably do too. Simple as that!"
,Leeski,2012-03-01T08:16Z,"@brigzy ur PC is remembering the default program for magnet links is limewire. you should be able to download the magnet link, then right click and choose 'open with'. if u cant do this, then go into default programs and change it there.. remember google is ur best friend."
