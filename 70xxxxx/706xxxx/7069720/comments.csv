FWIW :
All of the apps I've downloaded from StoneBoyTony are legit, clean, and work as expected (except Glass Widgets says it's the free version, not the paid one; user error?) . When I say ""legit"" and ""clean"", I mean it. I'm an Android dev (thus paranoid about exploits); I went through the trouble of 'decompiling' a couple of the apps (as best as one can with converting Java to Smali) AND ran all of them on an emulator. Nothing malicious."
,bllorx,2012-03-08T00:39Z,"That said (haha), Stone: Any chance you can upload these?

- Smart Keyboard PRO 
- Groove IP
- PicSay Pro

Thanks!!!"
,StoneBoyTony,2012-03-08T01:43Z,I'll try in the next package
,StoneBoyTony,2012-03-08T02:30Z,bllorx the best thing is to go on Demonoid and type my nick name there TONKAFOREVER you don't want to miss the second package...on the third one I'll make it this weekend the first three I'll add them that you request. See you there couse is been one week I can't post any torrents on Piratebay they have some problem with the server. All the torrent that I wan't to post MySQL is refusing them some big bug.
,bllorx,2012-03-10T04:12Z,"Hey Stone: Thanks for taking time to reply! Unfortunately, I don't have a Demonoid account, and registration always seems to be closed...feel free to help a girl out and invite me, though ;). I'm on fiber and I DO seed. Do you upload elsewhere? Thanks again!"
,StoneBoyTony,2012-03-10T15:00Z,In the description of the package in the bottom the first link you can visit me on kickasstorrents but if you want me to invite you on demonoid type your email so I can send you an invitation code.
