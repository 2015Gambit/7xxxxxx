Burn is the eighth studio album by English rock band Deep Purple. It was recorded in Montreux, 
Switzerland, in November 1973 with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, and released in February 
1974.

It introduced new lead vocalist David Coverdale and new bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes from Trapeze. 
This was the first Deep Purple album with the Mark III line-up. With the addition of Coverdale and 
Hughes, Purple's hard rock sound became more boogie oriented, incorporating elements of soul and 
funk which would become much more prominent on the follow-up album, Stormbringer.

"Coronarias Redig" was recorded during these sessions, but not used on the album, appearing as a 
B-side on the "Might Just Take Your Life" single. It appears as a bonus track (in remixed form) on 
the anniversary edition re-release.

"Might Just Take Your Life" released three days before the album on 12 February, was Deep Purple's 
first UK single in two years.
