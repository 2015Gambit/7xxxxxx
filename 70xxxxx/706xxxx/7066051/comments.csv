I copied the SD files to the correct folder.... installed the game with the apk..!!

The game initiates but the home screen (of the game, where we see all the game types) is not responding to any touch. Not even at the time when I touch on ""YES"" to exit the game..!!

Then I have to force close the game from the settings menu..!!


Any suggestion Mr. Usama Khan..??"
