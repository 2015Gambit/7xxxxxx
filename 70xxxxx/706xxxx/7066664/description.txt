Carl Lee Perkins (April 9, 1932 â€“ January 19, 1998) was an American rockabilly
musician who recorded most notably at Sun Records Studio in Memphis, Tennessee,
beginning during 1954. His best known song is "Blue Suede Shoes".

According to Charlie Daniels, "Carl Perkins' songs personified the rockabilly
era, and Carl Perkins' sound personifies the rockabilly sound more so than
anybody involved in it, because he never changed." Perkins' songs were recorded
by artists (and friends) as influential as Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Jimi
Hendrix, and Johnny Cash, which further cemented his place in the history of
popular music.

Called "the King of Rockabilly", he was inducted into the Rock and Roll, the
Rockabilly, and the Nashville Songwriters Halls of Fame; and was a Grammy Hall
of Fame Award recipient.
