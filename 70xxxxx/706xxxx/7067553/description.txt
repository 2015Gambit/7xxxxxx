The Pointer Sisters is the self-titled debut by the Pointer Sisters, released in 1973 
on the Blue Thumb label

The Pointer Sisters are an American pop/RnB recording act from Oakland, California that achieved 
mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s. Spanning over three decades, their repertoire has 
included such diverse genres as pop, disco, jazz, bebop, blues, soul, funk, dance, country and rock.

The group had its early origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in clubs in 
1969 as "Pointers, a Pair". The line-up grew to a trio when sister Anita Pointer joined them. They 
scored a record deal with Atlantic Records and released several unsuccessful singles. The trio grew 
to a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, 
recorded their debut album, and began seeing more success. The group achieved its greatest commercial 
success as a trio during the 1980s consisting of the line-up of June, Ruth, and Anita. Bonnie had 
left the group in 1978 to commence a solo career with only modest success.
