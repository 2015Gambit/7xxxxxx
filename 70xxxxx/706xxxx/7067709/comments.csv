I am new to this MAGNET thing. Before when I use to download the torrent to my hard disk and on opening it, I use to get the file list of the torrent.

Now, when I click on GET THIS TORRENT, it opens up in UTorrent without any file list at all. I mean how do I know what I am downloading.

Also, now how do I save these magnet files on my local hard disk so that I can download it as per my convinience"
,lra89,2012-03-01T08:25Z,it will come up in utorrent once it starts downloading. Then you get all the info :)

,regina28,2012-03-01T17:03Z,Is it just me? This video has about 3 seconds of audio shift. Seems that all x264 video from eztv are out of sync :(
,zapphb,2012-03-01T21:03Z,Thanks eztv!!
,CecilyBug,2012-03-02T00:23Z,"Yeah, why the sudden shift from .avi files to x264 .mp4 files?"
,DisturbedChucky,2012-03-03T09:19Z,"right, ok i get why the torrent files have been removed, but I use my nas to download as it has a built in BT client and I dont want to install a BT client on my pc.

it will accept either a torrent file, or a url.  i copy the magnet url from right clicking it and putting it in as a url in the nas's BT client but nothing happens

starting to seriously wind me up now"
