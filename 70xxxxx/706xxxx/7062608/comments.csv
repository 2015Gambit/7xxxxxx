Use this :
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe
Read the comment I posted with it, it has the instructions with  it.

I also posted this in another torrent:
TO ALL:

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar""

Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file

Click ""Never register""
At the activation screen, click ""Continue""
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean.


Now that TPB is back up, I plan to UL the language packs later today.

The error 1117 is USUALLY caused by your firewall, you need to block Rosetta 
Stone from the ""calling home""

Here's how:
Go to: C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc
There you will find a file named ""Hosts""
(not Hosts.ini, or Hosts.txt, or anything else, just Hosts)

Open it with notepad.
It should look something like this:

 Copyright (c) 1993-2006 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
#
#         Any other entries you had go here (new line no # no space);  
#
#		Microsoft Activation
#
127.0.0.1                               mpa.one.microsoft.com 
127.0.0.1                               sls.microsoft.com 
127.0.0.1                               genuine.microsoft.com
127.0.0.1                               wat.microsoft.com
127.0.0.1                               mpa.microsoft.com

127.0.0.1	secure.tune-up.com


Now, you see where the last line says:
127.0.0.1	secure.tune-up.com?, under that line put in:

127.0.0.1  rosettastone.com
save and close it

THEN, in your firewall software, you have to allow ""trusted outbound"" or the equivalent.

All of this is because for the Rosetta Stone speech component to work right, 
Rosetta Stone needs to ""talk"" to itself (Done ask me why, cause I dunno :(  sorry"

,mikolajf,2012-06-12T20:10Z,"How to install this pack? Please, help. I have downloaded all cd's but I cannot find install file. Shall I copy everthing into C:/ProgramFiles/RosettaStone/Content? I really don'know.... Perheaps it is easier to download and install preinstalled version?"
