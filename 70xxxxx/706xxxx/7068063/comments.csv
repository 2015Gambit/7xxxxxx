,dincity,2012-03-01T08:22Z,torrent didn't work right in vlc and 99 percent does
,l1zardman,2012-03-01T08:38Z,"It works fine on my vlc, it's just in a stupid format that is mostly only good for mobile devices or vlc but not much else.  Hopefully someone will soon upload in a more widely accepted format."
,l1zardman,2012-03-01T08:39Z,Plus rar - ugh.  I thought we are past that.

,smugdrug,2012-03-01T09:23Z,using VLC audio track sync (hastened) -0.300 s its pretty close.
[T],theburningbush,2012-03-01T09:25Z,"This is very fine to watch if you use VLC and adjust the sync as follows: in Windows, keep hitting the ""J"" key until it says -500 ms; on a Mac, keep hitting the ""F"" key until it says -500 ms.

Yeah, this is a pain, but at least *somebody* uploaded this program!"
,kibsbarz,2012-03-01T09:32Z,Everything is OK. Set audio delay to make it good -650
,kibsbarz,2012-03-01T09:35Z,Audio delay to -600
