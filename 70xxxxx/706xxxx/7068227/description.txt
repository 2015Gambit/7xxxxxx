The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
Working on Mac, hopefully a lot better this time.
Credit for this game goes to Bethesda Studiosâ„¢ and the Porting Team.
This is ready to go, and hopefully there isn\'t any problems.
This is version 1.0 and I do not know how to update it.
The file shouldn\'t use too much RAM and lags very little.
And one last thing: this is MOD friendly, the directory to put mods in is:
The elder scrolls V Skyrim > Contents > Resources > Transgaming > c_drive > Program Files > The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim > Data. Put mod files in here.
