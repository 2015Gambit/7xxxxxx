This is the first part of the capes and claws series, a swashbuckling series of Ayroles and Masbou, who also wrote Garulfo. It was written in the style of an Italian comedy, which means that the most important plot points were thought of before, but the rest was improvisation. This makes the plot sometimes a bit messy, but overall I think they managed quite well. I hope that you enjoy this release, and that you give some critique about the sentences, grammar and spelling so I can improve.

Have a nice read!

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use \\\".cbrâ€ files and open them with ComicRack.
It\\\'s easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
