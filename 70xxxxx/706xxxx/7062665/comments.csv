,organicmtdew,2012-03-04T09:32Z,"Dude, you're breaking TBP; if you address all the things that whiny douche bags complain about, then how will they make themselves feel better about a life that includes as much complaining as they do  about free videos? You jerk. How dare you!"
,Aikousha,2012-03-11T00:27Z,"^_^  s'casm appreciated... but a dude, I am not...  Though there are people out there trying to make changes to issues like that (and I think most of them live in Japan)."
,IotIP,2012-04-08T22:43Z,"Been trying to upload the update for quite a while now.  Unfortunately, it's a no-go.  TPB is having a server-hemorrhage of some sort, and all I get is the following response, no matter how I alter the entries:
=====

,DestinyDecade,2012-04-09T23:26Z,@IotIP: Isn't there another way? I really want ot get my hands on them and plus the season finale is coming.
,IotIP,2012-04-11T19:13Z,Try dem on id.me or kat .ph
,IotIP,2012-04-11T19:14Z,"Wow, I get a database error if I type in either of the two sites listed above, without the spaces.  That's messed up."
,DestinyDecade,2012-04-14T18:17Z,Is there anyway I can contact you because I really hope to get the other episodes.
,IotIP,2012-04-30T20:17Z,"My SO is paranoid, so I don't do real pictures or direct links, e-mail, etc.  Got enough creepy stuff in the past to agree with him.
However, the final version is complete, and bizarrely got upped quickly and smoothly:
