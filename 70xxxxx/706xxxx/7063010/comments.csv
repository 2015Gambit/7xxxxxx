------------------------------------------
Love this album, but there's only six tracks, when there's way more, especially on YouTube and such. "

not sure where you're getting that from as everywhere i check i.e. Amazon, Wikipedia or iTunes it says there are 6 tracks.

perhaps you are thinking of their 2012 full length album that hasn't been released yet"
,d_gorn,2012-05-31T07:26Z,Thanks Hobbit! Ignore the trolls....
,dafaq,2012-06-04T07:11Z,Mr HobbitTunez Do you have Imagine Dragons It's Time EP??
,bogie5of8,2012-06-08T00:34Z,"this is my first time posting a comment ever on tpb.  but I was wondering if anyone else knows where to buy their older albums. they have 3 other eps, Imagine Dragons, Hell & Silence, and It's time, but when I look on Itunes, amazon or yes even zune marketplace, they all say the albums are not available to purchase. I would pay almost any reasonable amount to hear anything else from this artist, and I dont want to wait till their new album comes in september. can anyone tell me where to find the older albums?"
,cacree,2012-07-11T06:21Z,"@bogie5of8 I'm fairly sure they don't have any older albums. Just a total of 4 EP's and a new album coming in September.

But great, fast download!"
,bogie5of8,2012-07-25T00:33Z,"@cacree

thats what I meant. sorry i got the language wrong. I'm interested in finding all the older EP's"
,RichManBigDick69,2012-08-03T04:35Z,"If you guys like Imagine Dragons you should check out the Neon Trees, I bet you already know em but if you don't just take a listen and I'm sure you won't regret it."
