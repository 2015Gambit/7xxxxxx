[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-02T16:59Z,"due to DMCA complains all especialy for my previous torrent as ""Inside Man""
i have to make a necessary pause as my ip is seriously tracked now anyway.
And even if i use vpn they also know that it's me too :(
mates,listen to me attentively now :
for your security and mine,please,do the following stuff :

A)work in incryption in forced mod.
means that all peers that will connect as not like this will be refused.
B)deactivate ""DHT"" feature for all my torrents now of course
C)Local host discovery will be deactivated also for all my torrents and previous.

Please,do this,it's urgent and very important for all of us now so far.
As i have expected,DMCA is able to identify you even if you use a vpn connection,in certain cases only,fortunately.

This is my last torrent for few times anyway.
Ty for understanding as well as your trust in me,sympathy and fidelity by far anyway.
Cu around mates and be prudent as we are unfortunately drasticaly tracked on torrent anyway.
best regards and cheers to all

please,seed asap this torrent for keep it alive anyway but i will be not so far as you could imagine,as the battle is not finished and without freedom,this world would be a serious non sens anyway."

[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-05T18:28Z,"If you like this torrent,keep it alive as long as you can mates by seeding this last one as i will be forced to stop all in few incoming days anyway.
Hope you will like my copy as well indeed.

[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-12T11:43Z,"@ Australian peers :
guys please,give more up speed otherwise you could get serious difficulties to connect or finish your download anyway.
Ty for your understanding

[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-13T11:29Z,"@ Deluxe peer/seeder :
please,bud,disconnect from this torrent now !
You are in conflict with many other slow peers
and my seed does not run very well by your fault anyway.

[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-13T12:05Z,"@ Transmission user (s) :
guy (s),please,do an effort,you often make me mad also.
Give more upload,because if you are not downloading,what is the interest to stay on a seed then ?
...
review your settings option and you can also try to switch to a different external port than 6881 either,like too much people still continue to use without knowing why in most of time...
Try other tests,settings,ect...
Few peers run well with this torrent client but they are approximaly and respectively no more than 35/40 % of all users who running on Transmission.
...
These are my personal statistics on more than 400 torrents seeded.
interesting,isn't it...
cheers"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-05-24T11:40Z,"need more seeders with me,please,for help latest peers to achieve and finish their download so.
Thx by adavance
regards"
