Final thought/result/conclusion :

Well it is a good copy for sure as audio quality stay very good and near of the original.
Video quality is pretty good too but some grain or noise may appear in certain scenes but not during all movie anyway indeed :)
Despite this detail,video quality doesn't suffering too much of it anyway.
Overall it is a good copy for a great anthology movie as a full must have of, indeed.
Tested on different players and play quite well anyway.
Might be laggy on certain computers on vlc media player but not sure...
Very very watchable and very acceptable as well.

With a thought to all his family,wife,friends and more so.
