SYNOPSIS:  
In this gripping thriller, Barbara Stanwyck stars as Leona Stevenson, a young, beautiful, rich hypochondriac who rarely gets out of bed. When she dials a wrong number by mistake, she accidentally overhears two men plotting a murder. As she tries to trace the source of the call, she becomes convinced that her husband (Burt Lancaster) is the one plotting the murder, and that shes the target. But is it just her overactive imagination?
