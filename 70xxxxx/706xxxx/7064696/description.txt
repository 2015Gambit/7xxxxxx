This is the entire Human Genome Project. The entire human genome, millions of lines of seemingly random letters, each one of which makes us who we are.

Each .7z file contains a .txt with the genome data. Use some text editor that doesn't try to load the whole file into RAM all at once. Try something like Emacs.

This is only a high compressed version of an original upload (3.3GB).


Thanks & Seed!
