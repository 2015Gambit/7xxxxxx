thx ripperschoice

Encode:
Une already made us a nice forward rip, wanna get you a tweaked version too, right from the source.

DVD had good quality, a bit of noise in the video but very high bitrate.
added brightness, sharpness and denoise and corrected rgb since they were slightly off.
got very nice
enjoy
