Rita James and the Race to Shangri La combines hidden objects with classic adventure gameplay. Join the "more brave than brilliant" aviatrix Rita James on another whirlwind adventure, this time in search of the mythical paradise of Shangri La! Travel with Rita, Sebastian, Dr. James, and Marbles--the one-eyed monkey--to a land of mystery where few have ventured. Escape a small mining village filled with murderous thugs; traverse steep Himalayan passes rumored to be guarded by a hideous Yeti; and all the while, escape the sinister Dr. Stroheim--who is only driven by greed and revenge! Can you save Shangri La before this paradise is lost? This light-hearted, yet thrilling storyline is pays homage to the 1930s adventure serials.
