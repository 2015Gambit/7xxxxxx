###  Story Line  ###  
    
Abigail Clayton lives alone. Very alone. In fact, the attractive heiress has not left her Manhattan loft 
apartment for almost two decades. The famous daughter of a wealthy industrialist, Abigail disappeared from 
the prying eyes of the press and the intrusiveness of her family on her 18th birthday, the day she received 
her massive inheritance. During years of self-imposed isolation, Abigail has had contact with only two people-her 
building's Concierge, Klandermann, with whom she communicates via notes-and Dr. Raymond Fontaine, a longtime 
family friend and her sole confidant for most of her life. When the death of her elderly neighbor prompts NYPD 
Homicide Detective Frank Giardello to launch an investigation, the agoraphobic Abigail is distressed to find him 
outside her door, asking to question her. Having tried to acquire the dead woman's now vacant apartment to ensure 
her privacy...
