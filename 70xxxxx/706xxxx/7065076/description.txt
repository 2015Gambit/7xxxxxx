I was looking around Google, and I came across 2 of the 3 episodes 
of The Tomorrow Show hosted by Tom Snyder to feature interviews 
with three of the former Beatles. It was a DVD set released in 2008.

This first one was in 1975, and was John Lennon's last TV interview 
before his 5 year "exile" and big comeback in 1980. It was actually 
John's portion of that earlier show re-broadcast in December 1980 
with new guests who remember Lennon after he was murdered.
