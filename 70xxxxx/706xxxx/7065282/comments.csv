,winnie0310_c,2012-03-01T17:24Z,"yeah i don't get it either... and when i tried to download it with magnets, it didn't work either... can someone pls help me out here? tks!"
,DustyVoodoo,2012-03-02T19:10Z,"@NMcGeer TPB did that cuz it said torrent files are waste of time. The magnets are better, and they are. to use them all you need is a new version of bittorrent program."
,Darkfears,2012-03-06T18:36Z,"First, download a decent torrent client, like uTorrent : http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/complete?os=win
Then, click the little magnet icon, and select uTorrent as the application you want to handle magnet files in future."
