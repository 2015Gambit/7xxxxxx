Software to recover data / files / movies / music from CD, DVD, BD and HD DVD

IsoBuster is data recovery software that can rescue all sorts of data, files, music, video from bad or otherwise malfunctioning optical media, such as CD, DVD, BD and HD DVD. 

This software communicates directly with the drive and does not rely on Windows to provide the files and folders. This way IsoBuster can access data that Windows can't.

IsoBuster also supports a wide range of image file formats, such as: *.DAO, *.TAO, *.ISO, *.BIN, *.IMG, *.CIF, *.FCD, *.NRG, *.GCD, *.P01, *.C2D, .CUE, 
*.CD, *.GI and more ... It uses several retry-mechanisms to aid you in getting the data, even if Windows is not able to do so. It is a very useful and easy to use program.

Additional features include Mpg (*.dat) Extraction, Scanning for missing files and folders, CDText support and much more. A good portion of the features are available for free, however certain advanced features such as UDF, HFS, IFO and FAT support are only available in a registered version.
