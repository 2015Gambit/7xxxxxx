,MayorMcCheezee,2012-02-27T06:16Z,"montandon = retard

It takes 2 seconds to check that this is a .avi, not a .wmv  

Not to mention, this was uploaded by a VIP who has thousands of quality uploads already...."
,ButtonsTheMonkey,2012-02-27T06:22Z,"Fake, it's an episode of American Horror Story."
,Sabartooth14,2012-02-27T06:27Z,can anybody verify that?

,xtc2,2012-02-27T09:37Z,"Verified as real, identical to ettv release. ""ButtonsTheMonkey"" is a bullshitter."

,arildus,2012-02-27T10:20Z,Thanx:)
,rscal07,2012-02-27T10:33Z,"dl right now, when post an a/v rating... but since sopa is on the subject, they air these shows for free most of the time on the amc website so, the fact they are sharing the video for free makes the whole sopa bs a moot point in my opinion... vote no for sopa, but at least research the why of it..."
,Josh8697,2012-02-27T11:08Z,"@jonaslorik Good job! I hope you get attacked by coyotes and get eaten alive, cunt."
,kris_tof,2012-02-27T11:16Z,I cant believe the asian guy would get killed. Right after he found out his girlfriend was pregnant!

ps: anyone know the song at the end??"
,markunt,2012-02-27T13:13Z,"I can't believe how bad this series finale was. They all meet up in some church and it turns out they've been in purgatory the entire time. Seriously though, awesome upload and it's what it says it is, VTV delivers again!"

,stacybernhardt,2012-02-27T16:03Z,"Thanks for the great torrent!  It sucks that Rick had to leave Shane for dead, but the guy deserved it after what he did to Otis.  Maybe we'll see Shane as a walker in a future episode. Cool!"

,Anxietic,2012-03-01T18:29Z,"Piratebay removed torrent files and now you have magnet links instead, just click GET THIS TORRENT and it should open in your client, atleast in utorrent it does. If you see no files at first and it says 0kb then just click next and wait a few secs, it will start downloading. Test it and you'll understand."

,qasdew123,2012-03-03T13:58Z,Problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client!-- what is this thing about? I got the latest version of utorrent so what am I doing wrong? :(
,mattyspurs76,2012-03-03T16:12Z,this is bullshit.. dont download anything from this person. the files compressed and you need a password to open it from another website.... i dont trust it!!!  and how can u upload something that hasnt been shown on tv yet?????????? !!!!!!!!!
,Stock3rz,2012-03-04T11:23Z,"@karamia
