[V],mirrormaster82,2012-02-29T12:35Z,"usethisusethis: Unfortunately yes,which kinda sucks if you want to dl only few issues from this torrent..."

,tea8765,2012-02-29T16:43Z,"WHAT THE CRAP IS THIS?!?! Megnet... really?  I have never used it before and dont know the benefit but its the new PB standard apparently.  It seems like a pain, I love 0-Day and have been downloading it for years but I dont want every file, I dont walk into a comic book store and buy every new issue of the week when all I want is the 5 or 6 I follow.  Anyway dont give up hope, its just a new way of doing business, see below from the PB Blog

""you _can_ download individual files using magnets - just wait until the metadata is fetched from the network. It is worth it."""

,mat5denk,2012-03-01T03:15Z,hey guis. just click the magnet link and wait for your comp to dl the torrent. then cancel the dl on utorrent ONLY USING REMOVE. then go to where your torrents dl (i just dl them to my desktop) and dbl click. you can choose what you want from there.
,X111,2012-03-02T16:31Z,"I read somewhere that If you guys has problem with the magnet then you just have to get a newer version of your torrent client and that should solve the problem.
My Utorrent client 2.2.1 works just fine btw :)"
,johneelad,2012-03-02T17:16Z,Mine worked and then a few days later had error messages.I uninstalled and then reinstalled utorrent and it works perfectly
,shonuffx,2012-03-06T16:30Z,"I thank you a lot and always appreciate all the stuff you provide us with, but this non-pre-download-file-selection really sucks a lot when it comes to a torrent like this. I only need like a fourth of this whole torrent, but now I need to get all 3 1/2 gigs and erase most of it when it's finished. Wont that affect that I'd like to seed once it's done? "
