        A story  about triumph  over adversity.  At the  heart of this
        true story is Damien Oliver, a young jockey who loses his only
        brother in a tragic racing accident, hauntingly reflecting  of
        the way their  father died 27  years earlier. After  suffering
        through a  series of  discouraging defeats,  Damien teams with
        Irish  trainer Dermot  Weld and  the horse  Media Puzzle,  and
        triumphs  at  the  2002  Melbourne  Cup  in  one  of  the most
        thrilling finales in sporting history.
