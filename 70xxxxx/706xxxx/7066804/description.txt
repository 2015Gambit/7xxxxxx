Windows 8 Consumer Preview for 32Bit Incl Serial

Windows 8 is the codename for the upcoming version of Microsoft Windows that follows Windows 7. It features a new Metro-style interface that was designed for touchscreen, mouse, keyboard, and pen input. It also adds support for the ARM processor architecture in addition to the previously supported x86 microprocessors from Intel and AMD. Its server counterpart is codenamed Windows Server 8. No specific release date for Windows 8 has been announced.

Windows 8 will employ a new user interface based on Microsoft's Metro design language. The Metro environment will feature a new tile-based Start screen similar to the Windows Phone operating system. Each tile will represent an application, and will be able to display relevant information such as the number of unread messages on the tile for an email app or the current temperature on a weather application. Metro-Style applications run in full-screen, and are able share information between each other using "contracts".[37] They will be available through the new Windows Store.[38] Metro-Style apps are developed with the new Windows Runtime platform using various programming languages; including C++, Visual Basic, C#, and HTML/Javascript.

Windows 8 for x86/64 processors will run most software compatible with previous versions of Windows, with the same restrictions as Windows 7: 64-bit Windows will run 64-bit and 32-bit software while 32-bit Windows will run 32-bit and 16-bit software (although some 16-bit software may require compatibility settings to be applied, or not work at all). Windows 8 on ARM processors (WOA) will not support running, emulating, or porting existing x86/64 desktop applications.[78]

Metro applications will also be cross-compatible with both x86/64 based systems and Windows on ARM.
