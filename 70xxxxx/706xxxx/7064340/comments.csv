Thanks also for the 3D subs. They really work on 3DTVs!"

Ok thanks for comment for the subs,

So all 3D Half SBS i make then subs with these settings."
,whatami12,2012-03-02T06:28Z,"@NLUPPER002

Just to clarify. 3DTVs may not be able to display the 3D subs or any subs which are not in ""srt"" format. This is a limitation of their firmware.

I converted the ""sup"" subtitles to ""idx/sub"" easy enough with BDSup2Sub and this made them compatible with many media players and software players. I have not found any player that will handle ""mkv"" with ""sup"" subtitles.

So if it's not too much trouble, please also include ""idx/sub"" subtitles.

Thanks for all your efforts."
,3Dazz,2012-03-02T23:56Z,"@NLUPPER002, I always grab your rips 1st, even though I have a passive polarised tv (over/under). But this is the 1st I've felt compelled to comment. This rip is glitchy in places and has a lot of bleeding in the black areas of the screen. I usually play these and other files with a LG Smart Upgrader, across my network, and it always works. this time I had use a laptop to play this, and it was obviously flawed. This is not a complaint on my part, Im getting it for free. Just letting you know that I had problems with it. Keep em coming, Thank you."

,andy99999,2012-03-05T12:13Z,"not bad, runs smooth enough.the only problem was on the bits where things are meant to come out of the screen it just didnt happen? the 3d depth was fine. i tried adjusting the 3d viewpoint but with the same results. "

hey man even een vraagje. hoe maak jij 3D srt's zodat je ze kan afspelen op een 3D tv....want de gewoone srt's storen een beetje omdat ze niet 3D zijn.
bedankt voor de up btw!!

,hc32king,2012-05-18T01:44Z,SEED!!!!!! PLEASE.
,hc32king,2012-05-19T05:11Z,the side by side 3d quality kinda bad but i think its just my 3dtv but i think you guys can change the settings or something to make it look better.
