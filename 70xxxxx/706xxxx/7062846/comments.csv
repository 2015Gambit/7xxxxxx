,lynxbird,2012-02-28T20:21Z,"@babybluetits24 don't care about imdb score, because it was on target of Serbian hackers.


80% rate it with 1 without watching (and 20% with 10)"

,chupo28,2012-03-02T14:36Z,"@babybluetits24 
IMDB rating for this movie came from Serbians that rate it with 1 star only because they can't handle the truth. They gave 1 star rate without watching it. 
Just remember, this movie doesn't need good actor or plots, its about FACTS, you have to see it for yourself then judge it. "

,tomy77,2012-03-03T17:33Z,"It was the Muslims who turned Sarajevo into a war zone. 
Nikola Gardovic, a Serb, was the first civilian war victim to be killed in Sarajevo. He was the father of the groom in a Serbian wedding party that was attacked by Muslims in Sarajevo on March 1, 1992 during the referendum on Bosnia’s secession from Yugoslavia.
Eyewitnesses identified Gardovic’s killer as Ramiz Delalic “Cleo”, the commander of a notorious Muslim “Green Beret” paramilitary unit in based in Sarajevo. 
In spite of warrants issued for his arrest by the Bosnian Interior Ministry, Delalic was appointed by the Muslim authorities to the command of the Stari Grad police department in Sarajevo. He was also appointed to the command of the 3rd Mountain Brigade and the 9th Motorized Brigade of the Bosnian-Muslim Army."
,nemac84,2012-03-04T00:13Z,Total waste of time IMDB rating don't lie. 
,ayo7,2012-03-04T03:10Z,"Would recommend to everyone.

This is a reality that was in the war in Bosnia during '92 - '95
There was a genocide against Muslims and RS is a genocidal creation. This is pure reality. This was confirmed by numbers of victims throughout Bosnia and exhumation of the bodies after the war.

I have lots of friends in Bosnia who have lost fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers in the last war in Bosnia.
Many Serbian war criminals be judged in The Hague today, such as Radovan Karadzic, Vojislav Seselj, Ratko Mladic and many many others. (You can check out on wikipedia and many web sites about Bosnia,just google it)

IMdB rating is unrealistic for purposely poor scores of people who deny the genocide in Bosnia, anti-Bosnian-minded people.

Bosnian Serbs are not bad people, I know a lot of them, but they have bad leaders who learned them to celebrate the defeat and live on their behalf and and manipulates them.

,chupo28,2012-03-04T21:59Z,"@Tommy, don't you feel silly when you know that you are lying to yourself:)? In fact, you are such a person that you are never gonna ask yourself, let me quote one of ""the fathers of Serbian nation"", Dobrica Cosic, ""WHY IS ALWAYS THE SO CALLED ""SERBIAN TRUTH"" EXACT OPPOSITE OT THE REST OF THE WORLD'S TRUTH? WE LIE TO DECEIVE OURSELVES, TO CONSOLE OTHERS, WE LIE FOR MERCY, WE LIE TO FIGHT FEAR, TO ENCOURAGE OURSELVES, TO HIDE OUR AND SOMEBODY ELSE'S MISERY. LYING IS A TRAIT OF OUR PATRIOTISM, AND THE PROOF OF OUR INNATE INTELLIGENCE. WE LIE CREATIVELY, IMAGINATIVELY AND INVENTIVELY. 

Your talk here reminds me of another ""hero"", same kind of hero like Karadzic and Mladic, Joseph Goebbels, Propaganda Minister of Nazi Germany, who said that ""IF YOU KEEP TELLING SAME LIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, PEOPLE WILL EVENTUALLY COME TO BELIEVE IT"". But it shall never happen, it is over with your lies, everybody knows what really happened in Bosnia, who was the aggressor and who was the victim. No need to remind who is in Hague now. This movie shows only one percent of evil what your ""heroes"" did to Bosnian people during the war in Bosnia. So just accept the truth, apologize, the hearts of Bosnian people are huge, filled with love, they even might forgive to all the monsters....  "

thanks, mate"
,arsenalfun3,2012-03-05T08:57Z,"READ IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IS MOVIE ACTUALLY TRUE

Yes it is. Im Bosnian, this country is totally destroyed by them. Serbian's leaders crime is equal to Hitler and Stalin crimes. Do you know that 50 000 women were RAPED in war? Most of people who survived are on pills now, like my father. A lot of children and women are killed, they totally ruined this country.

They say it was civil war but actually Serbian army attacked and wanted to literally CLEAN THIS COUNTRY FROM BOSNIANS. This movie is like nothing what actually happened here. Sarajevo was totally ruined and Serbians from Serbia came here to destroy it actually. Serbians did genocide and they are so shitty people. They look like pigs btw. If you don't trust, google serbian fu*kin people.

Peace."
,dalabuuu,2012-03-06T16:08Z,This movie is pure CRAP!

,skadus,2012-03-06T17:32Z,"@arsenalfun3, screw you, you fucking hypocrat! What's that PEACE you signed your post with? You are so full of hatered, as all of the muslim, who are constantly provoking  christian nations. As of the Serbs, they don't give a shit about all of you. Muslims are very welcome, as they have always been, but that was not enough for you, you wanted more, to take away SERBIAN land, as you are trying to do with the rest of Europe. I can only say: Dream on!!! 
About the movie: it's pure propaganda and war pornography for horny idiots, who can't see further from the end of their nose. Go and continue jerking off on Angelina Jolies sick sex fantasies. I could only watch 15 minutes of it. 
As of the raped woman, I can only say that those basterds who did that should be trialled for their crimes, serbian and bosnian as well. Don't forget what happened to serbian woman, maybe Brad Pitt could make a movie about that!!!"

jesus christ
sta vam je?
all movies based off the bullshit war/hate etc ARE bullshit
there almost always lies or inaccurate
BUT it doesnt matter as any normal person with a MIND should know its a MOVIE...nothing else its not a documentary you idiots
comment and rate the movie only dont talk shit"
,laso01,2012-03-08T12:42Z,"I'm reading these comments and can't believe that there is so much evil in all of us even now. Like every story, this has 2 sides that, necessarily, distinguish. If you want to know what happened find some documentary ( like http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6500029/The_Weight_of_Chains_-_Tezina_Lanaca_DVDRip ) and don't judge by some Hollywood movie. Of course, people will say that this documentary is genuine Serbian propaganda and other will say that this is 100% true. I really don't care. If you want, watch it and judge by your self.

Now back to this movie.
If you don't believe IMDB ratings, read some review from foreign authors.

A vi Srbi, Hrvati i Bošnjaci, dokle ćete da živite u jebenoj mržnji. Imam osjećaj da je pola ovih komentara napisano od strane napaljene djece koja nisu bila ni u planu kada se sve ovo dogodilo.
Ne dao Bog da se ono sranje ponovi."

,TreeLivade,2012-03-18T23:24Z,please seed... this is a great movie...
,Deminted4eveR,2012-03-29T16:19Z,well i was just curious about this film but if it is pissing certain people of so much well i already like it and am gonna watch it LOL
,Deminted4eveR,2012-03-29T16:28Z,"I don't care what country you hail from if you are a human on planet earth you are fucked already at birth to be a waste of human sperm.. it is in our nature to be hateful and violent and pathetic in our ways and destroy everything we touch.. All thanks to religion and politics no matter where you live it is all the same bullshite just a different culture and language but all still EPIC bullshit... war is bullshit and there really is hardly ever a GOOD GUY in war and there are NO WINNERS... deal with it or kill yourself.. 

nice upload btw  10/10 thanks movie is fucked but i like it.. shows the main flaw that is human nature.. no matter what language you speak or what god you worship or what other dumbass bullshit you choose to LIVE BY"
,Cameron_Nivea,2012-04-09T15:47Z,"True, it's a dramatic movie. Although I am not muslim nor am I a serb, this movie does show the reality of this so called ''civil-war''. In my opinion, and the majority of the world, it was nothing more than an ethnic cleansing. My respect goes out to Angelina Jolie and the whole cast. Not to forget LegendET for this excellent upload:)"
,Meechiii,2012-04-15T08:52Z,"I think all of your ramblings about the muslim/serb issue is very uncool. The movie, is to  cause a person to look at all opinions/sides/beliefs/understandings......people suck and some people don't suck. I think the behavior of some of the people leaving these comments really. You are the same as your opinion of  what you judge/hate....learn, and educate with compassion and  empathy/sympathy before you open your mouths and look like a fucking idiot....if you do that you wont regret the stupid things you've said. Now if you don't mind I'm going to watch a MOVIE"
,darko31,2012-07-12T22:57Z,"I am a Serbian refugee from that damned war that lead to so much violence, hatred and spilled blood and all in vain. I was a child when my mother and grandmother carried me as we travelled to safe haven somewhere in Serbia while my father was on the warfront. I know the Serbian side of the story. 

The Croatian war heroes plan was to extinguish all that is Serbian in the new Croatian country. One third of the Serbian population was to be exiled from Croatia, second third was to be catholicized, and the last third was to be slaughtered. 

The ""Oluja"" operation is glorified in Croatia as national victory over Serbs. A mass murder and exile is celebrated every year. Trouble is that the whole world has seen only one side of the story, not both. 

This hatred among Serbs, Croats and Muslims has been infused in our minds by our beloved leaders. I often see kids who don't have a clue about the war that happened here but the hatred is in their minds.

People are just sheep, its easier to listen the loudest one, than think with your brain.

And for the movie, nowhere says that this movie is a documentary, this a personal view Mrs Jolie and of course its biased and nowhere near the truth. 

Serbs are showcased to the world as the ""bad guys"" in that damned war. Trouble is that in that war every participant was a ""bad guy"". In the reality everything is gray, not black and white and everyone is guilty.

Only thing that we can do now is to remember the crimes and victims, so they can never happen again."
