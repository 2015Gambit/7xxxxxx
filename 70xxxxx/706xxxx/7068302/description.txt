Ripped February 29, 2012

Took me a while to get a copy of this. I did some running
around on release date just to find out everywhere had sold
out. So I ordered a copy, prepaid, and then pirated the
album. Two weeks went by and my CD finally came. So here it
is in perfect lossless quality!

Ripped with IMGBurn at low speed. Just load up the .cue in
IMGBurn and burn it to a CD. You will then have an exact one
to one copy of the original.

If you like the music, support the artist and go buy the
album! I did.

Enjoy!
