,melbcro,2012-02-29T08:55Z,So sick of mp4's! Can't play it in VLC and then have to restart my computer just so I can delete the crappy file! Please EZTV no more rubbish mp4's!
,Moubleu,2012-02-29T09:20Z,"That's wierd? mp4 works fine in VLC with me? but cant get the torrent here?? only shows the magnet link, which opens an empty torrent? probably a #noob question haha, how do i get it now?"

You can still download it, It only shows magnet link here to, but just click it and it will open in utorrent. It won't show what it is at first but as soon as it downloads it comes up :)"
