Amitabh Bachchan steps out from the literary shadow of his poet-father to find a voice that is as resonant as it is original. You will hear the famous baritone reverberating in your ears as you read SOUL CURRY FOR YOU AND ME that compiles homilies of the heart. Direct, simple, starkly dramatic. Like the man himself.
Bachchan's take on life is unique. Lie, if you can help someone by doing so. Help your enemies. Forgive your friends.Time is a man bald -headed at the back. Seize him by his forelocks. Live your life with zest. Heed the power of words.
The big man helps you celebrate the small and large things of life. He tells us among other things:

â€¢ How to turn our failures into success
â€¢ How we can have a positive outlook on life
â€¢ How we can draw inspiration from the great epics
â€¢ How to increase one's self-confidence
â€¢ How to foster oneness with nature

He traverses great distances, from issues like time and God to society, togetherness, the power of words, losing and winning. SOUL CURRY FOR YOU AND ME embodies Bachchan's brand of philosophy, which is holistic and heartwarming. Amitabh Bachchan is a man who is a genius at reinventing himself. We present him in his latest avatar, the actor-guru! Baring his soul to win your heart. Do you really want to be a crorepati, truly enriched in the heart and mind? Yeh book dil mein lock kar lijiye.

"When we were doing the initial spadework to telecast Kaun Banega Crorepati, we toyed with different ideas of how to take it to the audiences. One idea emerged: At the beginning of every episode we thought of presenting little nuggets of knowledge and wisdom. I know that this is not a new practice. It is an old tradition in our Indian culture. What I am presenting now is a compilation of all those utterances.It is a matter of great pride to me that what was said on Kaun Banega Crorepati is now being presented to you in the form of a book."......Amitabh Bachchan
