,EinDeutschMan,2012-03-30T02:44Z,"@bobnjoe,

DL this ISO, and READ the Read Important.txt file

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso

This is Rosetta Stone v3
install it.
Copy the patch in the patch folder to where you installed the program, then run it.

The patch will MORE THAN LIKELY set off your AV software -->> IGNORE IT!

This will allow you to activate the language packs

Then DL the Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 program here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso

There is a PDF enclosed, it has detailed instructions on how to install program and languages

DO NOT be fooled into needing any serials/keygens.

Replace the exe with the one in the crack folder.

if you have followed these directions, you should not have any problems

I'm having major issues =( 
First off, thank you for all your hard work into these torrents! 

My problem is that if I try to install this language pack with the v3 I get the error 9114 no matter what I do (I unplugged internet, made sure no antivirus or anything was interfering with it). Then (just to see what would happen) I upgraded to 3.4.7 (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso) and the Latin pack installs flawlessly (no errors) but then it shows up as unregistered (which limits available courses). And If I attempt to activate with XXXX's I get error 8118 'There was a minor error click ok to continue'.

I am at a loss any help would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. Cross commented this from your other torrent in case this is a Latin-only issue and someone else is having the problem."
,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-20T01:06Z,"TO ALL:

Here is the PREINSTALLED Rosetta Stone Latin language pack

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7199431/Rosetta_Stone_Latin_Preinstalled.rar

This rar file has a README file and the language pack ISO

Unzip, read the README, Mount ISO, copy to C: Drive and allow to merge.

You MUST use this in conjunction with THIS:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7198284/Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar

I will be UL'ing more language packs ASAP

Try them and let me know

this is ONLY a language trainer

,ralphnc,2012-05-07T03:59Z,I followed the copying and cracking but still have a problem about the application it was the error 2123 could you help me with that?
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-15T15:40Z,"TO ALL:

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar""

Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file

Click ""Never register""
At the activation screen, click ""Continue"" 
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean.
