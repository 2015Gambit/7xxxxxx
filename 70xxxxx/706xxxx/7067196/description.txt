ABOUT THE ALBUM
Unless you're a snob, a good Monkees collection belongs on your shelves, not too
far from discs by the Turtles, the Lovin' Spoonful, and other avatars of clean, 
occasionally rocking '60s Top 40 pop. This was the album an entire generation
owned. Bono sang a snippet of the 10th song at U2's infamous concert at Irving 
Plaza in New York on 5 December 2000. The collection was expaned to 20 songs for
a re-re-re-release in 1995. 
 
http://www.discogs.com/release/881496  This is from the CA release but Discogs
only has the US release listed. 


RELEASE NOTES
This is the first album i recall ever listening to and one of the first CDs i 
ever owned. My mum was a huge fan of The Monkees when she was young. An hour ago
she told me that Davy Jones died early this morning. 


                            David Thomas "Davy" Jones 
                       30 December 1945 â€“ 29 February 2012

                 When the world and i were young, just yesterday

                  I thought love was only true in fairie tales
