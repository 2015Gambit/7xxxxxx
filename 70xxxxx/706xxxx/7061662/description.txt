This is John Alan Coey's amazing book A Martyr Speaks - Journal of the Late John Alan Coey (1994) which is the journal of an American soldier who went to serve in Rhodesia's war against communist terror. Coey served in the Rhodesian Security Forces as one of "the Crippled Eagles", a loosely-organised group of American expatriates fighting for the unrecognised government of Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe) during that country's Bush war. He moved to Rhodesia the day after graduating from college in his home town of Columbus, Ohio, in early 1972, having attended officer training with the United States Marine Corps during his studies. There he joined the Rhodesian Special Air Service (SAS) in March that year and served there until 1974, when he transferred to the Rhodesian Army Medical Corps and was posted to the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI). Coey kept a journal from his first day in the army until his death. A Martyr Speaks delves into personal failures and triumphs of a soldier thousands of miles from home, a common fate for many soldiers of today who fight wars in unknown areas of the globe for equally unknown purposes. 245 pages, some pictures. A must read for everyone.
