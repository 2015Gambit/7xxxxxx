Sensually maneuvering their way across balearic soundscapes, enigmatic Grecian duo Keep Shelly in Athens help dim the lights and set the mood with our first 12\\\" EP release. 
Whether they\\\'re exploring the most laid back, lounge-y vibes or dropping smooth bass laden \\\'90\\\'s RnB cuts, one thing is clear: KSiA\\\'s musical approach is strikingly strange and erotic. 
These six tracks (plus a bonus KSiA remix of Body Language\\\'s \\\"You Can\\\") are destined to land on beige - some call it \\\"nude\\\" - vinyl!
