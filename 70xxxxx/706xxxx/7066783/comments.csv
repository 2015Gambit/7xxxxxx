They made it where you have to buy microsoft credits, and then to unlock certain planes, and more area you use the credits. It is not too expensive.  

I have been playing this for free for hours already and there has been a lot to do. Anyways let me know how this copy is, I would only download when they release the rest of the continents and they are over priced."

My question is does this contain the Hawaiian Islands DLC and 2 extra planes DLC? "

THIS GAME IS AVAILABLE FOR FREE FROM MICROSOFT GFWL.

It's FREE because it has a limited amount of gameplay with paid downloadable content. Buy the downloadables and play the rest of the game. There are lots of Online Web based games that use the same concept.

This torrent version contains NONE of the DLC content so it is USELESS. Download from Microsoft instead."
,Aviatrice,2012-03-18T16:00Z,"Strange, but official website does not allow me to download this game. When I reach 25.20 Mb it always crashes. I have no choice except to download here. Does anyone have the same problem with microsoft website?"
,Taco92,2012-03-22T05:14Z,Has anyone cracked the DLC yet?
[T],tikasukaz,2012-04-15T10:30Z,"I can confirm game is Working and virus free.
