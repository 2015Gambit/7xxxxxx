Description
Roaring engines, squealing tires and amazing graphics! We know yâ€™all want it and we guarantee that Reckless Racing delivers.

Reckless Racing mixes old-school racing gameplay with state of the art graphics and multiplayer features to brew a mean gumbo that takes the genre to a whole â€˜nother level. Perfectly balanced controls lets you skid, slip and slide through some of the most beautiful tracks that you ever did see â€“ leaving nothing but mud-splattered opponents, skidmarks and chaos in your wake. 

â€œâ€¦one of the coolest looking top-down racing games I've ever played.â€
(Eli Hoddap, Touch Arcade) 

â€œThe first thing that strikes homeâ€¦ is the sheer loveliness of the graphicsâ€¦ From sparkling streamsâ€¦ to large wooden churches looming up into the camera at the side of the worn dirt roadsâ€¦â€
(Will Wilson, Pocket Gamer)
