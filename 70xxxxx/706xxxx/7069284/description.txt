I climbed Mount Everest eighty thousand years ago. I am the last
supermarket trolley alive. Aloha.

I once bet 500,000 pounds that God existed. I was a nut. Thanks
to Edgar Malroy I am better now. Really

I was made on the 3rd of November 2022, at 11.30 a.m., in an
industrial estate on the outskirts of Chelmsford.

After I rolled off the production line I was greeted by a technician
with a friendly face. She tapped me on my push-bar and said the first
words I ever heard. Which were: Whos a pretty boy then?
Which was how I discovered my gender.

For a time I considered the technician with the friendly face a
mother of sorts.
We all did I suppose.

The technician who said the first words I ever heard and tapped
me on my push-bar was called Kitty Fitzgerald. She earned 9 pounds
50 an hour in 2022. She was not incredibly enthusiastic about my
existence. She said Whos a pretty boy then? casually, as if
she was uninterested. In fact, she couldnt have cared less.

The reason why Kitty Fitzgerald couldnâ€™t have cared less about me
or the other fifty trolleys she looked after was this: three weeks
earlier she had come home to find her husband having sex with the
family vacuum cleaner.
They got a divorce and she never spoke to the vacuum cleaner again.
