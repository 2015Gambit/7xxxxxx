,dudurr,2012-03-01T19:59Z,Totally random question: are there no more downloadable torrent files? This stupid magnet link doesn't work for my prehistoric torrent client provided by Synology. Sadly I can't use any other though.

In TPB: No
In Other Sites: Yes

You can simply migrate to a new torrent client and start using magnets. In case you cant, simple search the torrent with this hash on other sites, and download it. You are ready to go.

P.S: Magnets are not stupid, they are the key to evolution."
