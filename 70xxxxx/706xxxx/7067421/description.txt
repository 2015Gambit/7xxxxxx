From Wiki:


Jann Arden (born Jann Arden Anne Richards; March 27, 1962) is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

Arden was born and raised near Calgary in Springbank, Alberta, and attended Springbank Community High School.

Her breakthrough came with her critically acclaimed 1993 debut album Time for Mercy and her first single "I Would Die For You". Her success grew with 1994's Living Under June, which featured her biggest hit to date outside of Canada, "Insensitive", which was released as a single from the soundtrack to the Christian Slater film Bed of Roses (number 12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100). Another single from that same album, "Could I Be Your Girl", has also had significant, and consistent airplay on Canadian adult contemporary radio since its release, and featured a dance remix version which circulated on pop radio at the time.[1]

Subsequent albums include 1997's Happy?, 2000's Blood Red Cherry, and 2003's Love Is the Only Soldier. She also released a greatest hits album, Greatest Hurts, in 2001, and a live album, Jann Arden Live with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (2002). In 2005, she released her eighth album (her sixth album of new material) titled simply Jann Arden.

In 1998, respondents to Chart magazine's year-end reader's poll named Arden the Canadian celebrity most deserving of her own talk show. As part of her public honesty about her family life, she has revealed that one of her brothers is serving a life sentence in prison, and that her song "Hangin' by a Thread" is dedicated to him. Arden released her ninth album, Uncover Me, on February 6, 2007. This album was her first comprising cover songs exclusively, except for one original piece, "Counterfeit Heart". This was followed by her Uncover Me Tour across Canada during the spring of 2007.[2]

On the weekend of March 24, 2007, Arden was admitted to intensive care for heart related concerns, diagnosed as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition commonly associated with acute stress and exhaustion.

She had a 2007 USA summer tour with Michael BublÃ©. In 2010, they also carried the Olympic torch.[3]

In September 2009, Arden released her tenth album, Free, and its first single, A Million Miles Away, in June. She is also doing a cross-country Canadian tour, which began in November 2009. She toured with proceeds going to the "Raise-a-Reader Concert Series".[4]

In November 2010, Arden released her first ever live CD and DVD set, entitled Spotlight. Her latest autobiography, Falling Backwards, was released on November 1, 2011, along with a second album of cover songs, Uncover Me 2.

"Could I Be Your Girl", "Insensitive" and "Good Mother" were all significant hits for Arden in Canada, with "Wonderdrug," "Unloved" and "Looking for It" also becoming Canadian adult-contemporary hits. "Insensitive" was Arden's biggest hit internationally, entering the Top 40 in several countries, including Italy and the United States (#12 on the Billboard Hot 100).

Happy?


Happy? is the third album by Canadian singer/songwriter Jann Arden, released in 1997 (see 1997 in music).
 The album's title and cover, which features an image of Arden sucking her thumb, are seemingly at odds with Arden's image as a writer and performer of sad love-gone-wrong songs. However, Arden is also widely known in Canada for being gregariously funny and engaging in concert, and her self-deprecating wit has endeared her to fans. In addition to her own compositions, the album also contained a cover of the 1960s classic "To Sir With Love". The album title's use of the word "happy" ending in a question mark was first employed a decade earlier by Public Image Limited.

1.	"The Sound Of" â€“ 3:33
2.	"Leave Me Now" â€“ 3:50
3.	"I Know You" â€“ 4:16
