It's easy, if you learn proper technique from the start, i.e. to hold it like a pen or pencil, not like a knife, and ALWAYS keep the hook pointing downwards (so many people do a complicated back and forth motion with the hook, completely useless and taking up time and energy). If you follow this advice, it will make it easier and, in time, much much speedier. Oh yes, hold all your fingers together, no left index finger stuck up in the air!
You might want to check out in youtube ""Art of Crochet by Teresa"". She has tutorials for single stitches and also many simple projects. Start with How to Crochet 101 - SINGLE CROCHET and see the links on the right, pointing to the rest of the beginner tutorials. "
