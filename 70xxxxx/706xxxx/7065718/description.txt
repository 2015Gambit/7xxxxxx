They are not rar-ed, so you can pick and choose which files you need. If downloading a magnet, (in uTorrent) go to the lower half of the window, click the "Files" tab, wait until the list of files appear, select all those you don't want, right click and check "Don't download". However, if you download the whole thing and seed it, you will do a service to other downloaders.
