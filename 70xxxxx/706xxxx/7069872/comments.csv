,hrnyseany,2012-03-14T12:38Z,"This Rad Studio Includes Delphi & C++, Sadly no RADPHP or Prism...."
,forastero23,2012-03-15T01:24Z,"Yep, works like a charm. Beware of activator number 2, there is a trojan in there."
,WAmadeus,2012-03-15T20:22Z,"which trojan in activator 2? tried activator 1, but didn't work."
,forastero23,2012-03-16T00:44Z,"Sorry, I misread MSE alert, activator #2 falls into the category of ""HackTool:Win32/Keygen"".

Steps for activator 1:
- Copy files bdsreg.exe, cglm.ini, msimg32.dll, sanctuarylib.dll into RAD Studio XE2 installation path. Yes, overwrite existing ones.
- Run activator.exe, press 'Active' button, wait for confirmation window, and finally press 'Run XE2' button. Easy as that."
,Lomhoerd,2012-03-19T19:10Z,"Works nicely, just use activator 1, no need to copy any files."

,dp31,2012-04-10T13:03Z,"Well, that's fine, Ń ouldn't be better "
,lvs222,2012-07-10T08:20Z,"When I try and install the program I get an error saying ""cannot start setup - setup file may be corrupt or you may have the wrong password."" Has anyone got any possible solutions to this? "
,ImmerHungrig,2012-08-15T17:49Z,"The Download woked great - but the Installer did't: It thows the Error  >"""" is not a valid integer value< before the installpromt already comes up. And the Promt is unaccessable due to an Memomryaccess-Error... I tried it with an other XE-Setup, the same failure!
Needing yor help, please ! "
,desmond_2003,2012-09-05T03:10Z,"Those who are getting..."" is not a valid integer

A method to workaround this issue is to run setup.exe in the install sub-folder on the DVD or in the extracted ESD folder instead of install_RADStudio.exe. Then follow the steps in the installation wizard to install the product."
,agrest8,2012-09-14T14:47Z,"When I installed that and cracked using forastero23 method, it doesnt works. When I opening RAD Studio it opens my web browser on http://www.embarcadero.com/product-validation-error :(
sry 4 my eng"
