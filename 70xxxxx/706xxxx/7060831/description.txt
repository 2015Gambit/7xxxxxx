* Plot :

In 2017, the Eurocorp mega-corporation is born after the world's largest corporate merger. Eurocorp releases the DART chip in 2025, a neural chip implant that allows users to access the dataverse and making most electronic devices obsolete. As a result of the DART chip, the world is no longer ruled by governments but by the mega-corporations, known as Syndicates. However, only half the world's population embrace the chip while the "unchipped" are abandoned and denied the same benefits from their chipped counterparts. Furthermore, corporate espionage for dominance between the Syndicates has become the norm that they created Agents, bio-engineered and chip-augmented enforcers who protect their corporate master's interest and steal their rivals.
The game begins in 2069, where the player plays as Agent Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest prototype agent who is equipped with the new prototype DART 6 chip created by Eurocorp scientist Lily Draw (voiced by Rosario Dawson). 
After a successful test run of the chip's abilities, the CEO of Eurocorp Jack Denham (voiced by Brian Cox), who is fond of Kilo like his own son, gives Kilo his first mission to eliminate Aspari Corporation scientist, Gary Chang, after receiving information that Gary has developed a DART 6 chip just like Eurocorp's own for Aspari and Jack wants Gary's chip to prevent Aspari getting a lead in DART chip research despite Lily's worries he isn't ready. 
Accompanied by his mentor Agent Jules Merit (voiced by Michael Wincott), Kilo and Merit attack the LA branch of Aspari where Kilo kills Gary and retrieves his chip and learns from an encrypted conversation, that Lily has been sharing information with Gary on creating the DART 6 chip. After fighting off the West Meld Solutions security forces and an Aspari agent, Kilo and Merit escape from LA and return to Eurocorp's New York HQ.
