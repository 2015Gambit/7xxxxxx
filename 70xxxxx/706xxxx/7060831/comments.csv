[V],globeplus,2012-02-27T12:48Z,"To joekker : thank you but it is more the case maybe to stop making this kind of files definitively , lot of work and not too many users then ununcessary complaints but the users need to have in mind that for this kind of files the point is have them beeing more pratical as possible even if that means more analysis work ... like i said maybe can be the last game file , the interest and the inerent work not so attractive as that ... see you around and give your contributions when you have the chance , what it is more important most of all is the free sharing spirit to make positive contributions to help the others and with everyone thinking like that , we got a nice community of file sharing ... see you .

,.l.l.l.l.,2012-02-27T13:10Z,"niiiiceeee.....globe you rock man........beat up all other groups in their sizes....!!!!!!!

can i ask whether its a lossless repack or a lossy one or videos are ripped??????"
[V],globeplus,2012-02-27T13:25Z,"This comment is to say that i have a perfect work for this game for a pratical file , already played after my work and what a game and not a single problem ... just perfect the work , i think the users not anymore count with me for this type of files and i will respect that but i have here really the perfect work for this type of file ... thanks for reading ."
,mrsam1999,2012-02-27T14:30Z,Nice work Globe..Please carry on your good work..i really like this portable idea !!
,lal_rice,2012-02-27T14:31Z,does  it require any crack..
[V],globeplus,2012-02-27T14:36Z,"To .l.l.l.l : it is basically a pratical file , what was removed donÂ´t influenciate mimimally the gameplay , this is in my opinion the correct work for this type of file then you ask me if was easy ?! , well no , at least 8 to 10 hours of work spended in tests and deep analysis on the game folders , this game was a sniffing work that means that i needed to search carefull all the folders for see what was possible to do , tough work , after the work done you can say , well doesnÂ´t look too much what you did but the true is that was several hours of research before get the file ready to go and of course a couple of compressions tested arc and 7zip and in this game was the 7zip that wins by 70 mb and i say this because for example for the Left 4 Dead Autorun , with both games of the series ready to go in a pratical way with interface , the arc archive won by 60 mb comparing to the 7zip , so depending on the type of files the games have can happen an oscilation about the best compressor for the present game file beeing worked , all of this is work and the really correct work for this type of file but i think the users are not habituated to my work anymore and have preconceptions about some other groups as you say for this type of files , myself i am in favour of the pluralism of choice , more nice worked files , more options the users can get to choose , it is nice for example when you go to a supermarket buy something and you see at least a few nice possible options for the product you want to buy ... you got the idea but i am not disappointed about the work only with the response from the users about the file ... well this type of files are a kind of complex to work and without too much interest the possible work is not justified ... it is nothing against anyone but just the analysis of the uploading of this type of files ... please the users that want this file be my guests and happy game to all of you and have a nice day and doesnÂ´t matter my laments ..."
,.l.l.l.l.,2012-02-27T15:06Z,actually globe sir i meant to ask whether the videos have been recoded to lower quality or not....????
,.l.l.l.l.,2012-02-27T15:12Z,"and that was quite some info i didnt actually know about......you sir are a great man!!!!
thank you very much for this release....gonna hit straight for the download!!!!!"
[V],globeplus,2012-02-27T15:39Z,"To .l.l.l.l : thank you and just a couple of videos not necessary removed trust me and the rest are originals not recoded , just the correct work avaliating the available videos for this game ... thank you and happy downloading ."
,JoeKKer,2012-02-27T18:35Z,Yup Thnx Man...Jst Keep Up D Gud Work..Forget All Complaints..Dey R Jst BUnch of Losers Who DOnt Know To Install A Rip..
,nota369,2012-02-27T18:41Z,"obviously you can't compare 7zip with freearc. feearc is a compression suite with many compressors. you can get the optimum compression from it by manually configuring.if you apply ultra on a unknown format file freearc applies rep+exe+delta+lzma:max (as iknow) you may sometimes get a better result with rep:a10+dispack070+delta+lzma:ultra -s;
remember there are more than prcmp srp fa 7z
Good work though. keep em comming"

How big is the file once extracted?"
[V],globeplus,2012-02-28T09:44Z,To Edensaria : i think exactly 8 Gb .
[V],globeplus,2012-02-28T10:30Z,"I am starting to think that any other group can do a bad work and have more users than my files ... i was out of this type of work a longtime and the users probably get used to the others work ... well to the users that get this file for example : i always get a clean conscience after any uploading of this type of files , i know that in some games little things can happen but i am here anyway to the users but i am starting to be afraid that the users are not counting with my work anymore for this type of file , well at least i got as usual the feeling the best correct work done in another game ... thank you for reading and sorry because i am beeing a little borring telling this things but i have the feeling that for the work presented i deserved much more users but after all this time start working again this type of files it is a thing against me and the really nice works needs generally a little bit more time to be done to get the best possible pratical file ... well , never mind , happy gaming to all of you ..."
,ravibose49,2012-02-28T10:51Z,what a awsome work done by globeplus thanks man
,ram789,2012-02-28T13:59Z,"hey globe i have a request could u see if u can rip
FALLOUT 3 GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION ?
I WOULD SIMPLY LOVE THAT!!
sorry for the caps just wanted u to notice :)"
,ram789,2012-02-28T14:01Z,"And also i forgot to mention in my previous comment : 
Great rip man , thanx for the rip bro!!"
[V],globeplus,2012-02-28T14:42Z,"To ram789 : i uploaded that file many time ago ... canÂ´t do it anymore but thank you for the comments .

To ravibose49 : thank you but let me tell you some deep feelings : first on this particular file it is looking like the best possible work for a pratical file for this game is bullshit or something and that it is ridiculous and second it is unbelievable that many users no matter how many files are with the full isos still prefering the complete isos with cracks to adicionate or not and with onrigatory installations , it looks this type of work not respected enough by many users and with this feelings i can ask to myself if there is any point in making this type of work ... see you and again thank you for your comment . "
,earth3,2012-02-28T15:23Z,"you beat all others globe grt work! dont give up keep it coming!
people like full isos because they are too lazy to install time consuming rips and iso files have multi player too
but for guys who are low on bandwidth people like you are saviours globe!"
,earth3,2012-02-28T15:26Z,@globe: why did you stop releasing rmvb films? those things were a very less time consuming way to see movies now your movies are like other uploads damn large :(
,earth3,2012-02-28T15:28Z,kepp it coming mate! why did you stop the rmvb movie thing?
[V],globeplus,2012-02-28T16:06Z,"To earth3 : thank you for your comments and it is a pleasure talk to the users in a correct basis about any subject if i got the possibility ... about the RMVB video files , my friendly user i have to say that i really miss the work somehow but at the same time and considering only facts i got much more general users uploading mp4 with quality or xvids , it is the law of the strongest in number of users if you know what i mean but i have to say that the RMVB video type is really the video type with more potencial for some few reasons to keep the best definition of the picture possible for the lowest video size , comparing for example with FLVs (flash video) , while the flvs got pixelization in full screen mode beside the correct presentation in lower resolutions , the rmvb keep the definition on the video even in fullscreen for the same lower video size , the avis , generally speaking without too much bitrate , start to get an unfocus consistence on the picture in fullscreen and a little bass on the background or randomly lost particles on the picture , for the same bitrate as an avi with the mentionated carachteristics the rmvb get correct definition for less bitrate at the fullscreen , this doesnÂ´t mean in anyway that the refered video types donÂ´t have quality or are not good video types , farway from that but if we are talking about consistence and best definition of the picture for lower sizes videos then the rmvb video get the trophy ... ok , i am not working anymore for the explained reasons rmvbs video files but i leave this explanation for the possible interested users knows what i think about the subject ... thank you again and see you around ."
,Jayesh24,2012-02-28T16:26Z,"alan wake and syndicate both work like a charm.!
Thanks a lot mate."
[V],globeplus,2012-02-28T16:39Z,"To Jayesh24 : shore , no doubt but my work is a kind of second divison of rips beside beeing the best work possible to get for this type of files ... life sometimes have ununexplained contrarietys and you simply didnÂ´t get a valid explain beside the correct work ... well , i think that make the best work possible doesnÂ´t really count , i am like an outsider with no perspective about making this files ... what it is strange anyway  , this other groups needs some lessons about the work as i need sometimes too depending on the game ... well life is not fair but never mind ... happy gaming to you and see you around ... "
[V],globeplus,2012-02-28T19:12Z,"Want to know how can i make this game file have lot of seeds and peers ? EASY !!! I only have to make an iso more complex as possible with tough install and with all the bullshit that i can find to adicionate ,  preferencially increasing the inicial size of the original iso then the users think that maybe it is something missinh on the already downloaded isos ... believe me my friendly users this is the best way to go to work on this games ... pure creativity and smart work ...

,nolfrock7,2012-02-28T19:23Z, i could  not trust globe any more ..as  there is no fix for the globe copy of COD MW3 sand man bug.......
[V],globeplus,2012-02-28T19:31Z,"To nolfrock7 : don´t trust me but you getted enough time to know that an unlocker for all the levels are available at game Copy World , many users already finished the game with the file . "
,nota369,2012-02-29T04:47Z,"globe, the thing is unlike older days nowadays better internet connections steam preloads origin dumps come in to the internet so fast. no matter what size is people download it and wait for crack. so then they can enjoy the game just after the crack is released. you rippers have nothing to do for it other than releasing your rips as fast as you can. there are people who wait for smaller sized rips. they most likely grab the one which comes first or wait for their trusted group. in my point of view there is a big competition going out there among rippers.especially russian rippers now do care about english players. well, this time you were slow. that is why you don't see much leechers grabbing this plus this game is total crap. be faster make it smaller while keeping its quality"
[V],globeplus,2012-02-29T12:27Z,"To nota369 : thank you for your construtive opinion and you probably right ... but i am really shore that for this type of work i did the best file for this game , it taked a little more time to be done , needed a kind of heavy analysis beside looking very pratical and nothing was really done after the work but that is the result of all the necessary work , i was at the time of the crack release and you can comprove that very easily working a nice TV series with 16 episodes in total in 2 seasons and beside beeing a TV series that was available for some time i have more seeds than in this recent game ... strange and tough for me to get encoragated to do more nice work for new nice pc games when i got the possibility but of course that your opinion still right independtly of this observations ... thank you very much and positive and constructive opinions certainly welcome ... thank you .

To .l.l.l.l : i can probably take a look with time but i really donÂ´t have a clue about what i can expect in case of the uploading from the possible users , you know it is the always the same doubts on the uploadings about the game files but i will take a look , of course that we have to consider also the possibility of having heavy archives already with great compression difficulting even more the possible work for this type of files ... thank you for the suggestion and see you around ...

What you think about uploading the pratical file missing the crack if i feel the work it is correct just waiting for crack ?"
,---HG---,2012-03-02T09:43Z,well globe it seems reloaded turned to easier cracks but who knows lol and u might upload a file with lesser size with no crack but may i ask u? how u gonna test the game without playing if there is problem or not ?
[V],globeplus,2012-03-02T10:24Z,"To ---HG--- : 

Hi again and i have to say the next thing :

In this new latest PC game , just because i uploaded 24 or 36 hours later than the other groups i got the file going a kind of ridiculous indepently of making the best work for this game , if i upload Mass Effect 3 just needing the crack then after the release of the same i make an update file , at minimum i get more attention from the potencially interested on this type of files for my work ... got it ? Well , based on this if someone want to tell something about it be me guest ... thank you for reading and happy games to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-02T10:35Z,"To ---HG--- and all of the viewers of this comments :

The work on this Mass Effect 3 is going absolutly great , hard work , more than 12 hours in total but great , i still don´t how much can i get from the compression and i have to try 7zip and arc to check the compression that gives the best compression but all is work and i will be using for the first time a new style for the code on the console window , much more light and great to look ... just wait my friendly users and see you all soon ... happy games to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-02T14:55Z,"NEWS ON MASS EFFECT 3 :

New code style for console work tested and approved completly working 100% , now only the compressions that will take a few hours ..."
,lal_rice,2012-03-02T15:20Z,@globeplus I really love ur works u r the greatest games ripper i really want to work with u and learn from u how to rip the game plz grant my request (sry for bad english).....................
[V],globeplus,2012-03-02T15:50Z,"To lal_rice : 

it is great to see general users liking the idea of pratical files for his games , many times i got in my mind that the great percentage of general users are only interested in the originals , with installation work , more hard drive space consumed and cracks to apply that can need corrections , having users that like to have the hard drive more light with the same number of games and still with all the gameplay it is in fact a way to go and my friendly user when this work it is maded correctly  it is like a dream somehow because you are playing all the gameplay in a file more pratical as possible consuming less hard disc space that can be useful for other files and more easy transportation for flash drives or to record in very commons 4.7 gb discs , this type of work have in fact , a few interesting points that it is impossible to deny independtly of the general wish of the original isos ...

As a start i give to you this tip , independtly of the game , make compressions in 7zip or arc (using FREEARC-freeware) , this are the 2 best types of compression analising consumed ram and time necessary to the extraction and of course maximum compression possible under this parameters ... see you and it is great seeing interest for pratical files to play the games ."
,---HG---,2012-03-03T05:46Z,Globe great information thanks.i have always used ur rips b4 using ny other groups ones. well i liked the idea of yours to upload b4 nyone else even without crack.it will work good as well.globe keep good work up u have been great ripper so far been more one of the best.would love to learn how to rip game to smallest size lol. ok thanks got almost all ur rips with me. great
