,Doubzstep,2012-03-01T17:54Z,You are so welcome ed9msi. It really means a lot to an uploader when someone takes the time to go out of there way (already got torrent don't need to go back) and say thanks. I hope you listen and understand Jim's words.

if you find the legit real copy thats more than 18 bs seconds please reupload


its totally fake, only 18 seconds long. media player redirects to a fake download site and vlc that plays everything just plays 18 seconds.
if anyone finds legit download or stream please let me know and share

thanks,"

,derce927,2012-03-13T02:43Z,"i wasnt trying to spam your other torrents. i noticed you had 3 active torrents and saw that you replied back to people on other 2 torrents.
and i realized you were legit because those were real posted last month"
