The Melbourne Cup is truly "the race that stops a nation".
Since it's inception, great stories have emerged from this famous horse race, run each year 
on the first Tuesday in November, but none had a more extraordinary effect on the entire nation 
than the running of the 2002 Melbourne Cup.
In the wake of the Bali bombings less than three weeks earlier, Australians were seeking refuge 
in their most cherished tradition - The Cup. But a grieving jockey's courage in the face of his 
own loss, gave his countrymen far more than just a great race.
The final thrilling moments of this story will be forever etched in Australian folklore.
The Cup is not just a story about horse racing, it's about triumph over adversity and 
that inner courage inside all of us.
