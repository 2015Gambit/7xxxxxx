,rebviruyuy,2012-03-01T09:38Z,old and fake. thank you
,pleaseseedguys2199,2012-03-02T04:34Z,this is not fake. i put this up because i had a hard time trying to find this and people can get it easier here.
,omnipotentidiot,2012-03-02T05:39Z,"it would be good idea to mention that this is only for dev kit 360s, not for retail or RGH or Jtags."
,pleaseseedguys2199,2012-03-03T04:10Z,"this is for jtag and Rgh.
just have your rgh and jtag connected to your homework with dash launch open and open this program and click add devkit then select your jtag.
then you can connect to real time cod."
,afsilver,2012-03-05T18:48Z,"how do you open dash launch? thats a plugin that runs in the background! i just tested on my rgh, got an error sayin "" '192.168.0.108' could not be found "". i was running FSD 2.2 atm.

i will seed if this indeed works on RGH/JTAG."
,m4heshd,2012-05-20T15:30Z,RAR files are corrupted. Don't download this. Shit i wasted days on this ass
