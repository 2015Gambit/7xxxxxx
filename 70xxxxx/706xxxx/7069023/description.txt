Estevao de Brito (Serpa, c. 1570 â€“ Malaga, 1641) was a Portuguese composer of polyphony.
EstÃªvÃ£o de Brito was born in Serpa, Portugal. He studied music at the Cathedral of Ã‰vora with Filipe de MagalhÃ£es. On January 1597 he was already mestre de capela of the Cathedral of Badajoz (Spain), where he stayed until 1613. In that year, he went to the cathedral of MÃ¡laga and succeeded Francisco VÃ¡squez bearing the same office as CristÃ³bal de Morales, precisely 50 years before. He stayed in MÃ¡laga until his death in 1641.
Church Music: The church music of de Brito represents a particularly late flowering of the Renaissance, tempered by Baroque innovations. His setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, from the Holy Week liturgy, is characteristic of his style.
