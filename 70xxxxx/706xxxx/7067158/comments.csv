,xenoFLASH,2012-03-01T12:38Z,Any chance of Justice League Unlimited coming soon?
[T],tr108,2012-03-01T18:22Z,"xenoFLASH: yeah, I'm sorry for the delay. I've just had no uninterrupted time for the last few weeks (and it's 39 eps where I have to match subs, so I need time without distractions, unlike movie encodes; I try not to release anything without subs).

I appreciate that you're waiting - really! - and I think they'll be worth the wait. But I can't give you date right now. I'm about 1/5 of the way thru the 39 eps.

Again, sorry - I didn't think they'd take *quite* so long..."
,xenoFLASH,2012-03-04T07:06Z,Time means nothing. You have a level of quality that you wish to hold. Nothing wrong with waiting. Keep it up.

[T],tr108,2012-03-20T12:31Z,"Tiestick2003 - funny you should ask, I've been trying to get my hands on the GI: The Movie BD for a while. If I ever do, I'll def throw it up. :)"
