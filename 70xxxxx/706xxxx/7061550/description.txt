Ravi Shankar - The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali

"In the East they say suffering is avoidable and not necessary. Life is bliss! You know why? This is because wisdom, yoga and meditation are ways to avoid suffering which has not yet come." â€“ Sri Sri Ravi Shankar

Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: Sutra (in Sanskrit) literally means a thread or string that holds things together and more metaphorically refers to an aphorism. Patanjali is the compiler of the Yoga Sutras, a major work containing aphorisms on the practical and philosophical wisdom regarding the practice of Yoga. Guided by a single thread, a kite can glide and soar to amazing heights. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are life's threads, each one rich with knowledge, tools and techniques. These sutras guide not only the mind, but also one's very being to its full potential, amidst a 21st century lifestyle. Join us every Wednesday throughout the year to unveil the power of each sutra.
 
Sri Sri's commentaries on Patanjali Yoga Sutras: "In Yoga Sutras, Maharishi Patanjali says that the purpose of yoga is to stop misery from befalling you." â€“ Sri Sri

In December 1994, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar began explaining the ancient Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Sri Sri brought to light the profound wisdom contained in Patanjali's Sanskrit passages. The audience was a group of course participants tucked in Weggis, Switzerland. Amidst the bliss of so much knowledge, somebody had the awareness to record those precious talks. For the past 17 years, Sri Sri's humorous and insightful commentaries have helped thousands of people to assimilate and apply this ancient wisdom to enrich daily living. Yoga enthusiasts around the world have been enjoying these talks through books and video series.
