I'll be upping a Jane Siberry discography after I have completed acquiring her albums. No easy task as quite a few are rather rare and she must have about 25 releases (including lives). I have about 10 so far so if anybody has any Siberry please send me a pm or up it in lossless. Thanks!

From Wiki:


Jane Siberry (born Jane Stewart,[2] October 12, 1955 in Toronto, Ontario)[3] is a Canadian singer-songwriter, known for such hits as "Mimi on the Beach", "I Muse Aloud", "One More Colour" and "Calling All Angels".

Siberry has also released material under the name Issa (  /ËˆiËsÉ‘Ë/ EE-sah) - an identity (as opposed to a simple stagename) which she used formally between 2006 and 2009.

Siberry's music is most commonly compared to artists such as Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell and Laurie Anderson. Her music has drawn from a wide variety of styles, ranging from new wave rock on her earlier albums to a reflective pop style influenced by jazz, folk, gospel, classical and liturgical music in her later work. She has cited Van Morrison and Miles Davis as being strong creative influences.

Siberry has often criticized the competitive power of commercial radio and the recording industry.[4] In 2005, Siberry pioneered a self-determined pricing policy through her website[5] on which the purchaser is given the choices of: standard price (about $0.99 USD/track); pay now, self-priced; pay later, self-priced; or "a gift from Jane". In an interview with The Globe and Mail, Siberry confirmed that since she had instituted the self-determined pricing policy, the average income she receives per song from Sheeba customers is in fact slightly more than standard price.
