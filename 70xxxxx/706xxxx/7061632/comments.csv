,Akuseru,2012-02-27T18:51Z,Come on people! let's get this one seeding! :D
,Centurion13337,2012-02-27T20:42Z,So? Does this appear to be a legitimate high quality web-dl?
,Psythik,2012-02-27T23:05Z,"Uploading at 1.2MB/s, dowloading at 1.2KB/s.  This is bullshit!  Somebody seed, damnit!"
,[khemist],2012-02-27T23:12Z,comments please :)
,trollkuk,2012-02-27T23:27Z,"[khemist]

I think that because you chose a really large piece size (2.00 MB) the seeding of this torrent works very bad."
,trollkuk,2012-02-27T23:41Z,The piece size is too large (2.00 MB) and the the torrent doesn't seed well :(
,[khemist],2012-02-28T00:22Z,"yeah the demand definitely exceeded what i expected. piece size really only affects initial seeding but there are so many people trying to get it that even my 2MB/s up doesn't help much.

might try 512kb or smaller for next weeks episode."
,r0ssxx,2012-02-28T01:47Z,"I dont think this is a WEB-DL at all, its the wrong size should be 1.24 gb not 1.68 gb. I could be wrong but my guess is the poster re-encoded rather than stripping the DRM without a re-encode."
,r0ssxx,2012-02-28T01:49Z,The proper WEB-DL is here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7062168/The_Walking_Dead_S02E10_720p_WEB-DL_AAC2_0_H_264-CtrlHD
,[khemist],2012-02-28T02:01Z,the size is only 1.24GB if you use the iTunes version. this is the best quality release of this episode available. take it or leave it.
,trollkuk,2012-02-28T02:07Z,This upload is the greatest failure in the history of the pirate bay!
,[khemist],2012-02-28T04:20Z,so don't download it? is this a difficult concept? obviously the 247 seeders within 12 hours of upload disagree.
,amisnaru,2012-02-28T12:00Z,"So where is this from, seeing as it's not from iTunes like most WEB-DL's?"
,[khemist],2012-02-28T13:15Z,Amazon HD
,CudMan,2012-02-29T19:49Z,"Thanks for the effort Khemist, please upload other Amazon HD WEB-DLs as well. Wankers low on disk space are free to download other WEB-DLs, right?"
