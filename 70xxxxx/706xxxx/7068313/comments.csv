,beezle65,2012-04-18T19:42Z,"Me, too!"
,yakuzadude,2012-04-28T15:42Z,"Hey shankly, i really like your Uploads. You Music Taste is outstanding! 

But unfortunately i will never load any Piratebay Torrent again after two of my Friends received Letters from Lawyers regarding a copyright violation (Piratebay Downloads). Is there ANY Chance that you could Upload your Mixtapes somewhere else? Greetings, yakuzadude"
,cubit01,2012-06-01T23:52Z,So maybe this is the end of Shankly's Mixtapes? Can anyone recommend other similar indie music compilations?
,burntfajita,2012-06-02T18:31Z,"RIP Shankster...I'm already missing you and it looks like you won't be back :( . Thanx 4 the music over the last few yrs.

cubit - Birp! and Indie 69 (google them) are alternatives - both pretty good, but don't meet the the ecleptic standards that our shankly tret us to :("
,Flt4888,2012-06-18T03:27Z,We miss you Shankly! Thank you for all the years of great music! It will be impossible to top your playlists.
