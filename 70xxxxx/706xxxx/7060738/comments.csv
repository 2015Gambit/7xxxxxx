,omega0,2012-03-31T11:38Z,Bogus.  I downloaded it twice to confirm that the file was not proper.  Won't play at all shows as Audio file.  Do not download I  am doing a virus sweep now.  it has been posted a month ago with no comments and 90 seeders so it is probably not proper.

Will give ratings once I have watched it.
As a last note - seriously look into shit before you start talking shit."
