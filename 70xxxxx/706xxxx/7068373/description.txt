-Psych.S06E10.PROPER.HDTV.x264-TooSoon
2012-03-01

As Soon As Possible released too soon, forgetting the last one minute and 
forty-nine seconds of this fine episode of a wonderful television series.
Should not the people who were behind this format be able to use it 
correctly? Perhaps they can also fix their multiplexer so we can watch 
their video as it downloads, like we can with Laugh Out Loud releases. 


Duration: 50 minutes and 15 seconds
