Red Sky July are Charity Hair (The Alice Band), Shelly Poole (Alisha's Attic) and Ally Mcerlaine (Texas) - three successful musician/writers united in a love of folk, country, vintage music and vintage clothes.
The achingly beautiful songs on their debut album range from otherworldly modern folk to bluegrass stompalongs always informed by a wonderful pop sensibility.

Shelly and Charity's perfect two part harmonies throughout, combined with Ally's elaborate, atmospheric guitar playing, make for something really rather special.

Compared to such greats as Simon and Garfunkel, and being hailed as a sexier "The Judds", Red Sky cant wait to get out on the road with this new project. "That's when it all makes sense" says Shelly; "We all spend so long in the studio as writers that coming together to actually play the stuff we love, interact and sing out loud reminds you why you got into music in the first place."

Red Sky July's first album is a true labour of love for three individual players that came together to make a dream, and they did.
