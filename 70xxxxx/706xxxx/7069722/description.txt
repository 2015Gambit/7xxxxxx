Classic Albums - Cream: Disraeli Gears 
CREAM was rock's first true "super group". Combining the extraordinary talents of ERIC CLAPTON, GINGER BAKER and JACK BRUCE, this power trio became the template for many hard rock acts of the seventies. The band remains a huge influence on the genre even to this day. 
Powered by hits such as "Strange Brew" and "Sunshine of Your Love", Cream's second album, DISRAELI GEARS, moved the band beyond the blues into hard-driving, psychedelic pop. This was the album that not only broke the group in the United States but also established Clapton as an international superstar. 
This addition of Disraeli Gears to the acclaimed Classic Albums series features brand new interviews with Clapton, Baker and Bruce, along with lyricist Pete Brown, Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, John Mayall and Manfred Mann. Also included on the DVD are acoustic performances, original studio tracks and archival live footage.
