For the longest time, ever since the prison facility closed down and the remaining hard-core loner prisoners had been evacuated in a final transport, none of the visitors of the small island of Alcatraz seemed to give a thought to their common final fate.

Suddenly, the fog around these criminals is being pierced. One by one, another specialized law-violator with a purpose is being seen in present-day San Francisco, where the newly recruited partnership of a dedicated law officer with an unusually skilled Alcatraz savant faces a plate full of secrets, violence, previously unknown scientific occurrences and interrelated, deep-rooted grudges by police, guards & criminals alike.
