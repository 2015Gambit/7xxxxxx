Just choose the program you use to download with in that box and it will automatically do it for you"

,geek4real,2012-02-29T14:49Z,I can't figure out why this isn't coming up in the RSS feed in Utorrent.  I prefer Web-dl's and would love to see more.  But I actually don't see Alcatraz from ettv at all.  My Rss feed: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/0e3b2f46e5892dc5b2aac6dbe548bc27

,raa714,2012-03-01T02:37Z,Upgrading my utorrent fixed problem but I was always told to keep the 1.8.2 version because of problems with newer version. Upgrade works different now allot slower since only drawing from other users only.
