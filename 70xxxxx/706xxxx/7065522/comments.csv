,Halvarssonlol,2012-02-29T16:04Z,Nvm i solved the problem
,popeye013,2012-02-29T18:54Z,"Its because TPB has fucked over alot of people that don't and won't use waste-of-space magnet links!!
I fucking hate Magnet Links, they take forever and it makes torrents so much more unsafe as you cannot select what you want and don't want from a file, making it so much easier for people to load virus' and other harmful things to you, and you can't stop them in time!! 
Well done TPB.. I won't be using no more. "
