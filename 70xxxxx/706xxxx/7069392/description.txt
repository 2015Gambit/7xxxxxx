The Monkees are an American pop rock group. Assembled in Los Angeles in 1966 by Robert "Bob"

1966 to 1968, the musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith 
and Peter Tork, and Englishman Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer 
Don Kirshner.

Davy Jones was born at 20 Leamington Street, Openshaw, Manchester, Lancashire, England, on 30 December 1945. 
At the age of 11, he began his acting career and appeared on the British television soap opera Coronation Street 
which was produced at Granada Studios by Granada Television in Manchester. In 1961 Jones played Ena Sharples' 
grandson, Colin Lomax, the year Coronation Street was first broadcast. He also appeared in the BBC police
