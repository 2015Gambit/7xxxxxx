How to start on no$gba?"

,BalnazzarBot,2012-03-16T08:45Z,"To make it work on No$GBA download this and place it in the No$GBA main folder. To make the link work remove the = sign between Word and Press.

Now open No$Zoomer and go to: ""Options > No$GBA Settings"" and set ""Reset/Startup Entrypoint"" to ""GBA BIOS (Nintendo Logo)""
Now Save Settings and restart No$Zoomer, that's it."
