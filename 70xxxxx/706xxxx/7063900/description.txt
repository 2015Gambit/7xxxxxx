Cane Toads: The Conquest
Cane Toads is without doubt one of the most unusual, surprising, enjoyable and amusing films of the year. Mark Lewis (Cane Toads: An Unnatural History) explores one of Australia s greatest environmental catastrophes as he follows the unstoppable march of the cane toad across the Australian continent. Despised by many, venerated by some, the toad has occupied a nationâ€™s consciousness achieving both cult and criminal status. Despite its international origin the cane toad has become uniquely Australian yet, for a world wrestling with the idea that we have irretrievably altered our own ecosystem, its story holds universal relevance. Featuring a host of engaging characters as well as thousands of toads, Cane Toads: The Conquest is a humorous yet thought-provoking journey into the issue of invasive species.
