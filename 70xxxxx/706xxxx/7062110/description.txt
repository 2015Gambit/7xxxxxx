Discover what it takes to become one of the most famous pirates in history! Based on Sid Meierâ€™s original masterpiece, Pirates! invites you to live the life of a 17th-century Buccaneer in this epic, open-ended seafaring adventure.

Test your skills as a privateer flying the Jolly Roger across the Caribbean. Duel enemy captains, exchange plank-shattering broadsides and seize valuable booty, woo fair maidens, dig up buried treasure, and of course plunder unsuspecting ports. As your reputation and skills grow, so will the size and quality of your crew, and your ability to take on larger enemy ships, raid heavily fortified ports, and locate ancient treasure. There's a whole cast of interesting and dangerous characters to meet, mysteries to solve, and exotic island destinations to discover.

Itâ€™s a game of high adventure, where brave and skilled players battle for treasure and glory. Those who succeed achieve great fame and wealth â€“ and those who fail rest forever in Davy Jonesâ€™ locker!
