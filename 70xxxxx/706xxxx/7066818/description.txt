Details:

Last summer, Ryan Olson and Channy Casselle - whose previous collaboration, Gayngs' 2010 LP Relayted, was a mesmerizing slab of cheesed-out neo-soul that featured Bon Iver - wrote Give You The Ghost in only a month's time. Quickly, a band was assembled and sent into the studio, fully fleshing out the forlorn, ruminative R&B experiment, and Give You the Ghost was born. The songs are of a piece with Olson and Casselle's previous work, yet slower, more tender - less sharp tongue and more soft cheek. Casselle's focused, tender voice cascades over dense fields of minor-key electronics, backed by with funked-up bass and a swarm of percussion. It's sound of heartbreak and celebration happening simultaneously.
