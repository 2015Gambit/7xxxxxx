Plot: Low budget filmmaker, JAYSON (Glenn Plummer) has made the movie of his dreamsâ€¦ but to his dismay, it canâ€™t sell in Hollywood. The distributors tell him â€œâ€¦ you have nothing exploitative in your movie. Add some sex scenes, more violence, and maybe weâ€™ll buy your film.â€ The distraught filmmaker approaches his neophyte, semi-psychotic producer, BRAVO (Blaine Cade) and tells him, â€œâ€¦ put together a cast and crewâ€¦ weâ€™re going to re-shoot and give them what they want!â€ Bravo nervously tells him, â€œWeâ€™re out of money. â€ Jayson screams at him, â€œI donâ€™t care. Do WHATEVER you have to do!â€ Bravo enlists a young movie crew to follow them into the remote back woods of the Great Bear Mountains by telling them â€œThereâ€™s no money, but when we sell this, youâ€™ll all get a big piece of the profits for your effortsâ€¦ and great craft service!â€ Various â€˜Bâ€™ movie actorsâ€¦
