,Rexeus,2012-03-01T06:40Z,Thanx a lot !
,schmolch,2012-03-01T09:18Z,"Don't waste your time with this release:

""The TRANSiENCE release suffers from jerky 
playback throughout. We are not sure if 
this is from either bad deinterlace, or 
an improper VFR encoding/muxing. This 
show is not hybrid and therefore VFR 
should not be used."""
,CabbageBr,2012-03-01T10:02Z,"I can verify the issue with Herky/Jerky audio/video, synch issues, and dropped frames. This was poorly encoded, sorry [eztv] 1st bad file I have ever gotten from you. 
(tried file in WMP, VLC and on Boxee, same issues regardless of player/device)"

,CecilyBug,2012-03-02T00:26Z,And what's with the sudden shift from posting .avi files to x264 .mp4 files?
,carlredrick9,2012-03-02T01:39Z,"I can't even get the torrent...I click on ""Get this torrent""..and nothing.  I updated earlier this week...what is going on?"
,Apoc_69,2012-03-02T05:10Z,"I have to admit I was a bit sad when I seen the quality of this episode compared to all the rest, but you are still the man and will always rule my tv. 
Many thanks."
,mrflippels,2012-03-02T09:39Z,How come no AVI files anymore?
,chatmaster,2012-03-03T01:59Z,Why the change to x264 and mp4? While you were doing (avi) it was perfect now I'm starting to avoid your torrents.
