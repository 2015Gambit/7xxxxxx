,Bradum,2012-03-01T20:44Z,"lol @ Gripen221122. Skidrow isn't a person, it's an organization, so (while that make be a fake link) it is completely accurate to say ""Skidrow is working on a crack"" just like it would be accurate to say ""IBM is working on a new technology"". It wouldn't mean that the person thought IBM was a person. Also, I don't think there's a more redundant statement in the world than ""idiotic moron"". Combined that with the fact that you quoted something that wasn't a quote makes you a stupid, dumb, unintelligent, idiotic moron."

,Unknown16,2012-03-01T22:11Z,"@robertalexander
It's impossible to know at this stage that it can be converted to English. It's known to be Russian because of Origin detecting the ""GDFBinary_ru_RU.dll"" file. But people on the internet have provided an English DLL file, which I don't fixes it or not. Only time will tell as either Skidrow provides us with a crack or their own version."

So unless he figured out how to compress the shit out of this game somehow, then I wouldn't try my luck.
Next, I only came here because I heard a rumor that the game is linked. And I must say that i'm really disappointed. If you've played the demo yet, you should know for a fact that this game is going to be worth your money. Give Bioware some love and show them support for actually doing a good job on their game by buying this game instead of pirating it. Seriously guys. "

Why do you enter Thepiratebay if you don't wanna ""pirate"" something ?
For fucks sake the NAME IS PIRATEBAY! , This site is made for piracy. I simply refuse to give any money to EA for obvious reasons.
I don't even need to point them out , everybody knows 'em.
If i bought every game that i played , i would be in jail because of debt.
Try to figure it out , i played at least 100 games.
40 bucks a pop it makes 4 grand.
and some of them are way more expensive than 40 bucks.
This is stealing without ""the chance of being caught"".
Use your brain once in a while will ya ?

I'm not sure if it can be english but the autorun is russian and mass effect 3 is zipped.
I checked some of the files and this seems like the real deal.
I opened up the mass effect 3 configurator and it has the icon and everything and it's english.
But i'm not sure why it's zipped though , EA doesn't use that kind of archive files.
Maybe Origin client does.
I have this feeling that it'll be like assassin's creed all over again.
We're gonna direct Origin servers to localhost then run a local server that imitates the actions of the Origin Server. Shit i hated that.
Hope it doesn't come to that.

Hope crack comes out soon.

Good luck to everyone."

@Hyuk412 No, I will continue to be a ""white knight"" for Bioware just to piss little shits like you off. I admit I do pirate most of the games I play, however, for games that I know are going to be good I at least give the creators the money they earned. And the DLC is mostly small stuff like armor and weapons, there is only one DLC that is huge and thats the extra character that you can get for Pre-ordering.

@izmirtheastarach I applaud you for investing in a CE, I just simply bought the regular edition for xbox cause CE was sold out. And if you say it works, then I'll believe you.

@Boltthrower56 I enter the piratebay all the time to pirate games, and yes, I hate buying EA games for the same reasons that you do. But I would think that it would be alright to make an exception and actually buy one game out of the thousands that we have pirated between ourselves. And just so you know, there is always a chance of being caught, so no, its not risk free. :)

@LexLuth0r lol, you really just defeated the purpose of not writing it out when you continued on to say that I fail..... da fuck?

@Unknown16 I applaud you for actually buying the game then. 

@Opiumthoughts ..................... /facenuke

@rawtoni I applaud you for buying the game sir.

There is not even a slightest chance that i can get caught i live in turkey so that's bullshit.
Why should i make an exception ?
And why would you fuckin' buy a game that you can play for free?
Think it like this you don't go to a retail store to buy your game , instead you come here and buy your game from The Pirate Bay for FUCKIN' FREE!
Besides in order to crack it someone must have bought it... So the thing that we do is basically sharing! You know if i had a friend who got mass effect 3 i wouldn't buy the game i would borrow his copy and play. So just because the person i'm borrowing from doesn't know me , doesn't mean that it's stealing. The owner is willing , the leechers are willing. Who the fuck are you to take that away from people? Such a mess...
That's piratebay is all about.
Of course we need some stupid buyers like you to fund the companies , doesn't change the fact that you're stupid and unrealistic.
You seriously think that after pirating every game on the planet and buying only ""one"" to make a difference , would make a difference ?
And why would i pay EA? the money that i pay goes to EA not bioware. EA owns em now , They're on payroll. They're gonna get their money regardless of what i buy. If we're ripping someone off right now , it's EA not Bioware.

Yes I bought the game, and yes I will also download it off of here since I can get it early for no charge!
 But I dont think that it's dumb to invest in something that is worth the money, thats the exact reason I bought this game, and Mass Effect 2 and 1. And yes, if the denziens of the pirate bay were all put there money into a game instead of simply pirating it, I believe it would make a difference.
 And yes, I do know that the money goes directly to EA, but the thing is, EA looks at the income that each company brings them and every once in a while gets rid of the companies that aren't meeting their shit quota. While this won't happen to bioware any time soon. Look what happened to Westwood the creaters of the Red Alert, Command and Conquer and others! EA shut them down after their fiasco with Renegade in 2003!
But its whatever, I really don't care that much whether you buy the game or not, all I wanted to do was get my point across. And judging by how irrational you got, I'd daresay that it did.

Now wait a minute. If you want to make this a discussion about ethics, there is a lot to be said about many of the big corporations that market and publish games. They aren't exactly a pinnacle of morality. They're the bad guys here, by using anti-competitive practices, by monopolizing the market, by ripping customers off, by buying smaller companies and screwing them over, by forcing you to use their software and so on.  So no, i don't feel immoral for pirating the games of a company that does that since they are immoral themselves. 

But i do feel bad for not supporting true value wherever i see it. And this principle i apply everywhere in life, not just on PirateBay. I don't see why i suddenly have to pretend i dont have a morality because i'm on PirateBay. WTF? I pirate a lot of games and i buy the ones that i think are worth it.

,Thigrai,2012-03-05T17:32Z,"I've been following the discussion and would like to throw in my two cents. 

I also live in Turkey and over here you have no incentive to buy a game, literally. 99% of games don't have Turkish language support, Prices are usually inflated and there is no prosecution for piracy. While there are laws that prohibit piracy, they aren't exactly enforced.

That being said i still buy games. Now if i buy a game there are usually two reasons for this: either it's a multiplayer game and so i can't enjoy it without a legit copy, or i have a passion for the ways of the company that are developing it.

So i have bought games like Battlefield 3, Bad Company 2 and so forth. I have also bought many 5$ indie games on steam. Most recently i bought Skyrim, because i had such a good time with Oblivion (which i had pirated). I even bought Mass Effect 2 after pirating the first game.

I refuse to buy ME3 because if i do i am supporting the retarded milk-the-retarded-consumer policy of EA. I will be supporting day 1 DLC and i will also be supporting the fact that EA forced Bioware into developing part of the game only to cut it out and sell it for 10$. I am ofcourse talking about the Prothean companion and everything associated with the From Ashes DLC. That is something the company worked on, but decided to exclude from the game JUST so they could milk 10$ from stupid customers.

I do not support this kind of bullshit and so will not buy this game. I will however pirate it because i freaking-love Mass Effect. 

Me NOT buying ME3 will in no way affect Bioware because obviously millions will be buying the game and the series is over anyway.

If you truly agree with the way EA is milking customers, you are an idiot and i have no business arguing with you."

,0xiDIzE,2012-03-05T20:09Z,"@Opiumthoughts You're absolutely correct.  The developers, or rather, the publishers in most cases, have the right to set the price at what they believe is fair for the product.  But the publishers, being EA in this case, didn't make the game.  They're just the ones who dictated how they felt the game should be made to Bioware, who had to listen because EA was providing the majority of the funding for the project.

Do I believe the Mass Effect series could have been MUCH better without EA's influence on Bioware?  Yes.  Look at Mass Effect (finished before being bought by EA) compared to Mass Effect 2, its DLC, and the Mass Effect 3 demo.  We went from a very complete game story-wise, gameplay-wise, and depth-wise, to something...less.

But all this is beside the point.  I'm not pirating Mass Effect 3 because it's not the complete experience that the first game was.  I'm pirating it because, again, the publisher has every right to set the price at what they believe is fair for this product.  I, conversely, have every right to disagree on the fairness of that pricing.

I will pay something for this game eventually.  A price set upon how much I enjoy the experience.  No, Mass Effect 3 does not cost $300.  It actually costs, with all DLC, and I'm not kidding here...$870/£550/€650.

http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/27/all-the-mass-effect-3-dlc-costs-how-much/

Now, I don't doubt that EA believes the complete experience is worth that.  But they don't make the game.  They just profit off of it.  

I don't claim to take the moral high ground here.  I'd probably set the price pretty high for something that I can simply suck the profit out of without putting any of my own effort into as well.  But as long I'm on the other side of the socioeconomic ladder here, I'm going to pay you what I believe it fair for the experience that you have provided for me.  PROVIDED through distribution and marketing, mind you, not CREATED.  It's not going to be much...maybe $10.  But if I genuinely enjoy the experience, I'll find a way to get around $30 to the developers (Bioware) directly, circumventing those who only live to suck the life out of them.

So that's my little spiel.  The publisher sets the price, and at times I set the argument that said price is unreasonable.  You might find that it is reasonable, in which case you can vote with your wallet in favor of such practices.  I'm simply doing the same."

No, this makes the difference between being taken for a fool by cynical corporations who value profit above anything else (like quality) OR not being used by them and supporting true value where it appears. To me, this is a pretty legitimate moral stance.  

I want to support companies that make good games, not the ones who use viral marketing campaigns and push their subpar products down the public's throat. 

And how many times have your expectations been cheated because of false advertising? Is anyone going to give you your money back for a game that sucked and disappointed you terribly?  
Do the companies take any responsibility for ruining great franchises? 

So no, I will not buy their stuff and will stick to supporting the companies whose games i actually enjoy. These are the ones who should have the highest sales, not the ones with bigger budgets for marketing campaigns. But they don't have the highest sales because morality doesn't make the world go round, money does. 

Just my opinion.

C'mon now, you can blame EA for a lot of shit but BW's quality is not one of them, the changing of writers and philosophies of the producers/directors is what's the problem, the fact that they don't take criticism is another and the biggest one is that they're trying to ditch their current fanbase for the more profitable CoD or casual fanbase, which is why you get ""Press A to awesome"" shit like DA2 and badly written plots for ME2 and ME3(Marc Walters shouldn't have been allowed to be main writer, most stuff he's written is crap and contradictory, like the awful comic books), most people just don't like to blame BW because they still hold a sweet spot for them because of BG or KotoR so they complain about EA ruining everything instead."

Dragon Age was a series specifically touted to bring back the Baldur's Gate-type style, and I'm fairly confident that Bioware would have stuck to some semblance of that model had EA not been the ones pulling the strings.

The changing of writers and philosophies surely had an impact on things, but there's no question in my mind that those events were also motivated by the decision to sell Bioware to EA.

They've destroyed some of my favorite developers in the past, they're doing it now, and they'll continue doing it well into the future.  EA and Activision are a scourge upon the face of the gaming industry."

Download this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7072758/Mass_Effect_3_Multi7_(Language_subtitles)

And Pay attention.

Go into your mass effect 3 folder
Into BIOGame
Into CookedPCConsole

From the torrent you just downloaded Grab the file called BIOGame_INT.tlk

Rename it BIOGame_RUS.tlk And replace the one already in the mass effect 3 folder.

Enjoy, Repost If this has helped you!"

,Dufox,2012-03-06T02:11Z,"@ChipotleGeorge

this version of the game is winrared.
chances are you had an error when you was extracting it. try deleting the game then extracting it again.

also only crack it.
dont mess with any files (like the language fix) until you can confirm the game works for you (to limit the amount of things that can go wrong)

this being winrared is annoying as hell.
i love the guy for uploading this. but winraring it made me want to slap him.

winrar is for cracks (or something that you use to replace a file) NOT for an entire game. 

this is 2012. /ranting off :D"

im just copy and pasting it because others said it worked importing chars from me2.

TO IMPORT ME2 CHARACTER!

Get copy of the save file. It will have .pcsav as the extention.

Create a directory like this: C:UsersYourUsernameDocumentsBioWareMass Effect 2SaveJohn_30_Vanguard_123321Save_0000.pcsav

Replace John_30_Vanguard with your characters name, level and class. If you don't remember, use Gibbed save editor to check. There are 6 numbers at the end of the directory and 4 at the end of the file that don't seem to matter.

You probably have to restart the game after copying the files there. "

if it didnt work, something prolly got corrupted when you unzipped it. try unzipping 1 folder at a time. (or download a version that some dumb shit hasnt compressed into a .rar :D)

after you unzip it, its installed :D there is no need to install origins. make a folder called mass effect 3, drag and drop from the .rar, the launcher is in the mass effect 3/binaries/win32 folder
