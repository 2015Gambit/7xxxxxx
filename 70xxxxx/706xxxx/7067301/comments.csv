,Sp33Dy56,2012-03-01T07:07Z,"Any word on if its working?!?! 
i reallllyyyy want to play it but can't afford a virus lol"
,tibrusjer,2012-03-01T12:18Z,"I know it's never helping, but if this actually is the real deal it would help if you seeded the whole game a couple of times so we others may seed the game with you."
,seed4life4me,2012-03-01T16:52Z,dosent work !!!!!!
,cschrille1,2012-03-01T17:19Z,"Hmm, I scanned csgo.exe in virustotal and its clean. Scanned all files with Kaspersky strictest mode and no viruses.

Now we can say its clean. Then I tried to launch it and i got to see background picture and intro, but when menu load it crashes without error. Minidumps were created, gonna debug them soon.

Conclusion: It is by 90% chance legit, but its not working or something is missing."
,sage1210,2012-03-01T17:25Z,"yeb, not work here too. game crash to desktop after loading main menu.

,cschrille1,2012-03-01T17:33Z,"Hmm WinDBG doesnt debug it, I guess we need visual studio to debug it. I wont download it and go through all that, please ShiftFTW, help us lol.

If anyone fixes game please reply :D"
,tibrusjer,2012-03-01T17:47Z,"I can confirm this seems like the real deal.
New Valve intro as well as background image and such when you boot it up, but the game crashes and goes back to desktop.

ShiftFTW, please tell us what's wrong.
Thanks"

,ShiftFTW,2012-03-01T21:59Z,"@mati1491 i have 64 bit, i also think is something on registry because everyone who download the game from steam and download this it works"

@ShiftFTW now I downloading CSGO beta from russians. They used VMWare Player to create virtual machine. Dunno if this works. You may try with this program and with this way because client.dll is for specific machine. Online not works but they said with bots this works"
,Itbankrock,2012-03-03T17:25Z,"Didn't work even with that .reg file applied on and even my Steam is off. After Intro vids, it goes into a CSGO background and suddenly exits and creates a MDMP file in the directory.

It currently works for me!

This is a fix for Counter-Strike: Global offensive beta!

Please be sure to post if this works, as im working with a new crack/fix for the latest patch.

Thanks again! Hope this works for you guys!"
,ABCnadcompany2,2012-03-11T16:56Z,ExahausTii you fucked bitch this is FUCKED surveys fuck you this is unlimited surveys NOT complete this is no crack this is shit non-crack you find and I testing-THIS NOT WORK
,ABCnadcompany2,2012-03-11T17:14Z,not download ExhausTii is fake sh.it not work only surveys and ... fake not use not download i warning you download this is wasted time
,ExhausTii,2012-03-11T22:04Z,"I can ensure you that you can download the crack from that site, just fill out the survey. If you dont know what to fill out, use fakenamegenerator.com and put in the information the survey need.

Ive downloaded the crack 2 times to 2 different computers. Its working fine for me. I just filled out the survey with some information and then it came up some other stuff and just press some things, bang i got access to the crack.

The game is running very well for me. I promise you that i dont scam you guys, waste of time? Bullshit, this is not waste of time i can tell you guys!

Try it yourselfes, its running fine. And as i posted  before. Feel free to give feedback, it may not work for some people. But im working with a crack for the newest patch right now.

Thanks again, and those comments about this being fake, those comments are fake."
,ABCnadcompany2,2012-03-11T22:48Z,ok exhaustii upload crack on piratebay or any website without survey
,Aaron8001,2012-03-11T22:54Z,"I tried to give the benefit of the doubt with the surveys. Although i have tried these sites many times before i have always found the same issue; you are unable to complete the survey with false information as you must send a text to a specified number (which will cost you ridiculous amounts of money)

so im really confused at how you got it to work without being a premium member. i tried 3 or 4 different surveys and all ended with the same results...never prompting me to download"
,Aaron8001,2012-03-11T22:55Z,i second that....if you have the file then post on the pirate bay please

What you do is write to a friend which actually has CS:GO - im sure most of you have someone like that- you login with his name and password on your steam, download the game, than run it for a moment, close everything, give the guy his account back.
From now on you can play CS:GO offline with your STEAM APPLICATION CLOSED(don't forget to close it) ! You will not be able to run it with the icon created on your deskop. You have to go to steam/steamapps/common/csgobullshiitlongname/ and there you will find ""csgo.exe"". Run it and have fun."
