,jessedubya,2012-03-02T19:46Z,Hobbits....is there a release on TPB of No More Heros??   If not could you upload one?
,Z-Byte,2012-03-06T07:03Z,Need the ISO.  Can't put this onto a WBFS formatted drive because the WBFS drive FORMATS ISOs into WBFS.

just add it with Wii Game Manager

,WIIstpM,2012-03-27T07:08Z,It's not working :S WII Backup Fusion is not detecting the game and CFG Loader too...

So don't use those applications.. use Wii Game Manager

Or are you on a Mac?
Using fusion v1.1?
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wiibafu/files/Wii%20Backup%20Fusion%201.1/

or here is another option:

or use a virtual machine to run Windows applications."
,lx.mrqz,2012-03-27T20:06Z,Thanks for the UL. I noticed the size is a lot smaller than other ULs. Are there files missing or is it a full extraction? Thx.

This is the full game. the other 3905 MB is empty data, believe it or not. Consider it super-compressed. WBFS allows for the absolute greatest compression, more efficient than a scrubbed ISO."
,WIIstpM,2012-03-28T20:04Z,Even if it's NTSC will it play when using CFG Loader? I'm trying WiiGM now I'll give feedback. :)
,WIIstpM,2012-04-01T07:51Z,"Okay I put the WBFS with WII game manager, and when I load the screen goes black with a lot of writing till it says to me reloading in 60 seconds with green and rose square and the bottom..."
,conanfarrell,2012-08-26T16:22Z,"it's not working with Wii Game Launcher. When I start it, there is a wiitdb.xml file is missing... any comments"
