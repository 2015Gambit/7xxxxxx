I used the EZ green button in the tool, it took about 3 seconds to unlock Office Professional Plus on Windows 7 64-bit!"

,emelieli,2012-03-27T09:19Z,Love you! Exceptionally easy to use. I just activated Office Pro Plus by just pressing the green EZ-button. The toolkit automatically tested two different types of activation and the second one worked! Thanks a million for this seed!
