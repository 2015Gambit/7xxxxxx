    This week, Chris joins the Royal Marines in Nad Ali        
    North as they begin to hand over control of security to   
    the Afghan National Army and police.                     
                                                              
    For the Royal Marines of 42 Commando, the handover can     
    be frustrating as the Afghans do things very              
    differently. M Company launch an airborne operation      
    into a known Taliban heartland in the desert of Helmand   
    Province. Accompanied by the Afghan National Police,       
    the operation takes an unexpected turn from the start
