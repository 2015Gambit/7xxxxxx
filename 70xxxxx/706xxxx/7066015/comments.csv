,dnico321,2012-02-29T11:44Z,thanks
,Traziz,2012-02-29T12:05Z,Hmmm blank torrent for me... looks like clients need updating :P
,Traziz,2012-02-29T12:58Z,"Yep just needed client updating, so people wonder... when you use magnets you add it to your torrent program of choice, it will show no files to start with... then wait a few mins once peers with data are connected you will get the file list.

So just be patient :)"

,rchrdcrg,2012-02-29T18:40Z,"Just adding that i'm stuck at 97.7% too, and it's showing 165 seeds, none of which am I connected to."
,Mainlo,2012-02-29T18:46Z,"Please fix this, 97,7 like everybody else..."
,Traziz,2012-02-29T19:23Z,"Blame the seeders who have set their clients to seed with 1 connection at slow speeds. Not all of them will be, but be patient."
,Traziz,2012-02-29T19:29Z,"I will seed this shortly, hopefully be able to send to enough people who can then seed to the others."
,cdnmama,2012-02-29T19:39Z,"I'm at 100% now, will keep seeding :)"
,Traziz,2012-02-29T19:41Z,There we go ;)
,wryfox,2012-02-29T19:44Z,"Thanks, it's completed now!"
,cdnmama,2012-02-29T19:49Z,"100% now, will keep seeding :)"
,Traziz,2012-02-29T19:51Z,Also guys remember to put on peer exchange also :)
,Mainlo,2012-02-29T19:56Z,"Thx! I always seed at least 100 % or 1,0 s/r and so should everyone else. Peace"
