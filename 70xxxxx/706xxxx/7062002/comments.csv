The error 1117 is probably due to your firewall, (at least with me , that's what I found)

Set you firewall permissions to allow Rosetta Stone to ""Trusted Outbound"" (or the equivalent) and BLOCK everything else.

Apparently Rosetta Stone needs to ""talk"" to it's self, 
This error will also come up with as speech recognition error.

DO NOT register anything with Rosetta Stone.

,EinDeutschMan,2012-03-16T18:53Z,"@modysavary,

Some of the language packs will work with V 3, some require V 3.3.7. (or higher)

As far as installing V 3.4.7 over V 3.3.5, you shouldn't have any problems.

But I WOULD recommend that you back up the registry.
As well as the Rosetta Stone folder in the ProgramData folder and the Tracking.db3 file in your user folder.
The tracking.db3 file may be hidden, so you may have to change that in the folder options.

The files in the Rosetta Stone sub folder of ProgramData deal with the program installation,
 and Language pack installation and activation.

The tracking.db3 file deals primarily with your progress, but it does affect the program operation as well.

,EinDeutschMan,2012-03-21T14:15Z,"@chump123,

What version of PowerISO are you using?

The first thing you need to do is reboot.
Remount them
After you remount the language packs, browse them, and make sure that they are intact.

Level 1 - 259 files, 4 folders, 375mb
Level 2 - 259 files, 4 folders, 350mb
Level 3 - 259 files, 4 folders, 359mb
Level 4 - 259 files, 4 folders, 417mb
Level 5 - 259 files, 4 folders, 457mb

If they do not match, then DL them again.

If that doesn't work let me know, but that usually takes care of it.

I'm sorry for the confusion, I added the line about DO NOT update, but left out a vital part, it should have read DO NOT update until you have run the patch.

As far as why uTorrent says access denied, I have no idea why.
Are you running the latest version of uTorrent? 

Since TPB has switched over to magnets, you need to run the latest version to ensure proper function.

This is the  whole program, it contains everything you need to upgrade v3 to v3.4.7

I would recommend erasing the ISO you have and replace it with the new one to ensure that it is not corrupt.
Then install it in the same folder as your v3.

After you have installed v 3.4.7, copy the RosettaStoneVersion3.exe file in the patch folder of the ISO to wherever you installed the v3.4.7, and allow it to overwrite it.

Three things:

1. Are you getting any Rosetta Stone errors, if so, are there any numbers included in the error message, or are they Windows errors?

2. IF, after you have installed followed the steps listed below, and you still get errors,  let me know, you MAY have to delete the Rosetta Stone ISO's, start over.

3. You do not need to burn the images to a DVD, but you DO need to ""mount"" them using a program such as PowerISO (search TPB for PowerISO4.7, that's what I use)

INSTRUCTIONS:
*****************

DL this ISO, and READ the Read Important.txt file

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso

This is Rosetta Stone v3

Copy the patch in the patch folder to the program folder where you installed Rosetta Stone then run it.
The patch will MORE THAN LIKELY set off your AV software -->> IGNORE IT!

This will allow you to install and activate the language packs.

If you try to install levels 4 and 5, you may get an error saying you have to update Rosetta Stone.
Just wait until you have installed v3.4.7 (this is because levels 1,2 & 3 are for v3, but levels 4 & 5 are for v3.3.7).

Then DL the Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 program here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso

There is a PDF enclosed, it has detailed instructions on how to install program and languages

I'm not sure, but if you did the installation in the order you described, you might have done things out of sequence. If you are in doubt, UN-install your current version, and start over. :-(

1. COMPLETELY disable your av software.
2. UNPLUG your internet connection (yes, I mean physically disconnect it).
3. Mount the ISO's with whatever you like (I use PowerISO 4.7, but that's just a matter of preference).
4. Install program (V3), DO NOT run program.
5. Copy files (crack program and Licencingdll.DLL) from Crack folder to program folder where Rosetta Stone is installed and run it.
(if the crack sets off your AV software, IGNORE IT! I've used this same program for over a year without any problems)
6. Block Rosetta Stone program from internet access.
7. Set your firewall to ""allow trusted outbound"" ONLY! (or the equivalent.)
(if you block ALL internet access, you may get a 1117 error, speech component for voice recognition.)
8. Do NOT update the program!
9. Install language levels 1, 2 & 3.
10. Install v3.4.7 in the same folder as v3 (overwrite the contents).
11. Install language levels 4 & 5.

The 5118 error is usually due to the ""permissions"" of the Rosetta Stone program folder not set right.
Make sure that you are the ""owner"", and that you have ""full controll"" access to that folder (and all subfolders)

Next, to preserve your installed language and activation settings:
Go to the Rosetta Stone program folder, and rename the Products.xml file to Products.xml.bak

Then install this ISO:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso
Follow the directions in the Readme file.

Then install this ISO:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso
Follow the directions in the Readme file.

Go BACK to the Rosetta Stone program folder, and rename the Products.xml.bak BACK to Products.xml
and you will still have your installed languages.

==================================================================
FYI:

The Products.xml holds the installed language and activation info
The Tracking.db3 file holds your progress in Rosetta Stone.
The DynamicStoredPaths.xml holds the language file(s) location and Tracking.db3 file location

I STRONGLY recommend making backups of theses 3 files.
If you ever have problems with Rosetta Stone, having these files will save you a TON of time!

If you are using the ISO's you must ""mount"" them first, I use PowerISO4.7, 
There are several ISO programs out there, but I pretty much use PowerISO just because I'm accustomed to it.

You need to DL and install PowerISO4.7, if you haven't already.

After you have installed it, open it, go to ""options"", ""configuration..."",""Virtual drive"", set ""number of virtual drives"" to 1, ""OK""

Reboot,

right click the icon,

navigate to where ever you have the language ISO's,
select language level
right click on PowerISO icon again,
you should see something like this:
""Mount Image to Drive[E:] D:Downloads Rosetta stone French - Level 1.iso""

(remember, your drive letters & paths are probably different from what I have here, these are just for demonstration.)

The v3 of the program is needed to install and activate the language pack(s)
The v3.4.7 of the program is needed to install and run (correctly) language pack(s) levels 4 and 5.

(follow the instructions in the Readme file)

1. Block internet
2. Install program (V3), DO NOT run program.

3. Copy files (crack program and Licencingdll.DLL) from Crack folder to program folder where Rosetta Stone is installed and run it.
(if the crack sets off your AntiVirus software, IGNORE IT! and allow it to run, I've used this same program for over a year without any problems)
4. Block Rosetta Stone program from internet access.
5. Set your firewall to ""allow trusted outbound"" ONLY! (or the equivalent.)
(if you block ALL internet access, you may get a 1117 error, speech component for voice recognition.)
6. Do NOT update the program!
7. Install language levels 1, 2 & 3.

8. DL and install this ISO
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso
(follow the instructions in the Readme file.
9. Install v3.4.7 in the same folder as v3
(overwrite the contents).

10. Install language levels 4 & 5.

You SHOULD be set.

I am having a bit of difficulties completing this installation of Rosetta Stone V.3. I have downloaded the ISO http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso but upon trying to install it I receive an error (""Error 1311. Source file not found: 
C:UsersMacAppDataLocalTemp$PowerISO$Data1.cab 
Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.

I'm not really sure why I am having this issue as I was able to install the program the previous time.

Also, I had two questions...how do I block internet and block Rosetta Stone from accessing internet?

And after seeing this message ""Mount Image to Drive[E:] D:Downloads Rosetta stone French - Level 1.iso"", is that step done? Or was there something more I was supposed to do?

I'm so sorry to be such a bother, but again, I am not very computer literate with these types of things."
,lensky19,2012-05-02T09:34Z,"Will this work with v 4.1.15, on a Mac? A more general question: when you write it is for v3, will it work with v 4.1.15? Many thanks."
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-04T13:23Z,"@lensky19,

No, it won't work for any v4 of Rosetta Stone,
but I'm working on that.

First of all, DO NOT be afraid to ask for help, we were ALL ""NOOBS"" (""newbies"") at one time!

Now on to your problem:

""Error 1311. Source file not found:
C:/Users/Mac/AppData/Local/Temp/$PowerISO$Data1.cab 
""Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.""

This sound like you have a problem with PowerISO, not Rosetta Stone. 
Re-Install PowerISO, and try it again.

You block Rosetta Stone through your firewall, 
but with so many different Firewall programs out there, 
I couldn't begin to tell you how to do it. 
My best answer is to Google it.
""How do I block a program from the Internet using...(whatever Antivirus/Firewall you have)""

And after seeing this message:
""Mount Image to Drive[E:] D:/Downloads/Rosetta stone/French - Level 1.iso"", 
is that step done? Or was there something more I was supposed to do?

I reorganized the directions for PowerISO, maybe they will be clearer now.
After you have RE-Installed PowerISO:

Left click the icon, click ""Open PowerISO"", go to ""options"", ""configuration..."",""Virtual drive"", set ""number of virtual drives"" to 3, ""OK""
(I set the number of drives to 3, so I can mount 3 language levels at the same time,
if there are 5 language levels, set the number to 5)

Reboot,
PowerISO icon should be in the taskbar.

Right click the icon,
It will say ""Drive [your drive letter] No Media""

Click on ""Mount image""
Navigate to where ever you have the language ISO's,

Select language level
Click ""Open""
The dialog box will disappear

Right click on PowerISO icon again,
You should see something like:
""Drive[E:] D:/Downloads/Rosetta stone/Japanese - Level 1.iso""

(remember, your drive letters & paths are probably different from what I have here, these are just for demonstration.)

I hope this helps, 
Let me know,

Thank you for your kindness and patience in explaining this entire process for me. It's really helped a lot.

I removed PowerISO and downloaded/installed again but am still receiving the same error when trying to install Rosetta Stone. I'm not sure what else I can do here. 

Any advice?"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-06T04:57Z,"@JessMac87,

O.K., You seem to be having a ""permissions"" problem:

""Error 1311. Source file not found:
C:/Users/Mac/AppData/Local/Temp/$PowerISO$Data1.cab
""Verify that the file exists and that you can access it.""

Open Windows Explorer, navigate to C:/Users/Mac/AppData/Local/Temp
right click on the Temp folder > Properties > Security > Edit > Add
In the box that opens, enter your user name, click OK until you've closed everything.

Try to RE-install Rosetta Stone, if that STILL doesn't work then,
I think you will need to ""uninstall"" Rosetta Stone.
Go to Control Panel, (in Vista) click ""Programs and Features""
Click on Rosetta Stone and click uninstall.

Reboot, and try to re-install Rosetta Stone

I have tried to download many of your rosetta stone torrents with my aim to learn both french and spanish. I d/loaded rosetta v3, and the french preinstalled torrent, as well as french levels 1-5 torrent. I am NOT understanding how to get it all to work. Im really frustrated!! I managed to ""open"" rosetta stone v3, and then when it says to select a language pack to open, but it prompts me to enter a disc into my drive. I instead use the ISO program I have, but it only allows me to open the folders to view files, I cannot figure out how my rosetta stone actually opens the language packs. I honestly dont even really know what Im talking about right now. Its all too confusing. Help! I've tried reading all the comments/conversations between you and other users but it had just made it all the more confusing. :("

I've tried to make this as easy as I can;

1. DL, unzip and extract this ISO:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7198939/Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar

2. Copy over the ""Program files"" and ""ProgramData"" folders from RS_PreInstalled.iso to your C: drive
   (When it asks you to ""Confirm Folder Replace"", click ""Yes"")
   This will create the ""Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3"" folder in the ""C:/Program Files"" folder
    AND the ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in the""C:/ProgramData"" Folder

3. DL, unzip and extract these ISO's:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7222992/Rosetta_Stone_French_Preinstalled.rar
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7198467/Spanish_LatinAmerica_PreInstalled.rar

4. Copy over the ""Program files"" folder from Rosetta_Stone_French_Preinstalled.iso to your C: drive
   (When it asks you to ""Confirm Folder Replace"", click ""Yes"")
   This will create the ""Rosetta Stone/Content"" folders in the ""C:/Program Files"" folder.

5. Repeat step 4 with the Spanish_LatinAmerica_PreInstalled.iso

==================================================================
If you use the ""Preinstalled"" version;
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7198284/Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar

All the work has been done for you, everything has been installed and activated,
so all you have to do is copy the folders to your C drive.

Then DL the language packs (that have ""Preinstalled"" in the name), copy those files to your C drive,
and you're DONE!

I've tried to make this as easy as possible, to reduce error(s)
But I think I've added too much confusion in the process.

Just keep in mind, if it does NOT say ""Preinstalled"" somewhere in the name,
I cannot guarantee it will work with ANYTHING that has ""Preinstalled"" in it's name.

Does that help clear up some of the confusion?

Let me know,

,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-15T15:31Z,"TO ALL:

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar""

Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file

Click ""Never register""
At the activation screen, click ""Continue"" 
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean.

You must keep them in ISO form, and ""mount"" them with something like PowerISO.

installed, did not run, replaced with file from crack folder, ran program, installed these french language packs - everything seems good.

problem is, it is not backing down on the activation codes. it lets me do all of the lessons that don't require activation, but a bunch of them a grayed and locked out. tried to do the whole xxxx's and 1111's by phone activation - no go. tried a couple of keygen's i found on assorted other torrent pages - no luck.
