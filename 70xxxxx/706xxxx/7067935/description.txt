  Theres a new resident moving into Americas cities and suburbs,      
  peeking over backyard fences and casting a shadow over shopping       
  malls. Some folks are being right neighbourly and are welcoming the   
  new arrival. But many more are fretting about how the stranger might  
  dramatically impact their safe and peaceful suburban lives. Its      
  setting neighbour against neighbour and dividing communities. Honey,  
  meet the Frackers.
