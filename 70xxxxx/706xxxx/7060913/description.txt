A group of fringe astronomers have discovered Vesta, an asteroid the size of Arizona, which has fallen out of its orbit. Vesta is rocketing toward Earth at 200,000 mph with a scheduled impact date of 12/21/12. Scientists say it will create the equivalent of a 15.2 earthquake, and that life as we know it will end. What would you do? Wicked Pictures and award winning director Brad Armstrong bring you THE COUNTDOWN. This touching, passionate film is a must see for those who like great story-based adult drama. A brilliant cast gives the performances of their career, as they portray a diverse cross section of ordinary people in extraordinary times.
