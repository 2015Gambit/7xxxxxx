So, in your mind, it is necessary to point out the ""greed"" of Jews every time you see the word? How exactly is this helpful to anyone? By the way, you might want to look up the word ""fact."" I don't think you know what it means."

But then it does explain why you became a grade school teacher rather than try to compete with the rest of us in the real world. You may be able to bully your 10 year old students with your 11th grade education, but you'd be reduced to tears if you had to debate someone like me in public."
