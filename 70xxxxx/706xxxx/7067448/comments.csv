Get Firefox's browser, then download their download helper off of their site.  Go to youtube and type in naoki urasawa monster.  Come up on manga entertainment or something.  when the movie starts, click on your download helper and then save the video.  Be carefull, sometimes it will download the commercial at the beggining.  You have to stay on the page until the download is completed, it usually takes about 15 minutes an episode. If you ever get into a bind like I did once just skip the episode and move on to the next.  Come back to the one you couldn't download the next day.  It worked for me!"
