FIVE Apollo 13 The True Story xvid
Channel 5, 8pm 28.Feb 2012

In 1970, an exploding oxygen tank put paid to
Nasa's third mission to the moon, and left the
astronauts in extreme danger 200,000 miles from
Earth.

Twenty-five years later, Tom Hanks starred in
Apollo 13, the Oscar-winning account of the
disaster. But how much of the film was fact and
how much was fiction?

This documentary highlights the heroism of
everyone involved, investigates the real cause
of the explosion that crippled the spacecraft
and reveals how close the trio really were to
carbon dioxide poisoning and who built the air
filter that saved them.

Contributors include head astronaut Jim Lovell,
retired Nasa engineer Glynn Lunney, science
writer Jeffrey Kluger and the movie's director,
Ron Howard.
