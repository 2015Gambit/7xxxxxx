,alkwef,2012-02-28T07:08Z,Why is this torrent 230 MB when the Mac App Store shows that it's 93.9 MB?
,FatFreddy462,2012-02-28T09:33Z,Because on the mac app store the app is compressed. It works perfectly well.
,FatFreddy462,2012-02-28T09:42Z,"I have 2 torrent of Limbo :
The first is compressed and he has the size of Mac App Store of 83 Mo.
The second uncompressed and he has the real size of 111 Mo."

,FatFreddy462,2012-02-28T23:25Z,You have to place the game in the application folder.
,FatFreddy462,2012-02-29T08:01Z,this app is precracked
