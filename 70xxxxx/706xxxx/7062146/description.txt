____________________________________ 

Drifting is the act of maneuvering a vehicle through corners at speeds and angles that exceed the vehicleâ€™s grip. A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. 

Itâ€™s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. Itâ€™s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. 
Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It canâ€™t get any better!

HOW TO PLAY
Drifting is a very unique Motorsport where points are allocated on 4 main criteria: Speed, Line, Angle and Impact. 

LINE: Drift within pre-designated zones to get extra points. The line is marked by several clipping zones where the driver must get as close as possible while sideways to increase score.

ANGLE: The more the better. Drift with style and try to get your car as sideways as possible without wiping out to gain more points.

SPEED: Always try to drift as fast as possible while staying in control. If you hit a wall or get off-track, you will lose your current combo score. If you complete the race quickly, you will gain additional points.

IMPACT: This is the show factor! Itâ€™s about entertaining the crowd and delivering an exciting performance. Make them cheer; everyone enjoys the smell of burning rubber.
