escription
You tie your shoes, put on your headphones, take your first steps outside. Youâ€™ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - theyâ€™re everywhere. Zombies. Thereâ€™s only one thing you can do: Run!

Zombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. We deliver the story straight to your headphones through orders and voice recordings - and when you get back home, you use the supplies youâ€™ve collected while running to build and grow your base.

WALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE
Zombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills! 

YOU ARE RUNNER 5 
Hundreds of lives are counting on you. You've got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?

A WORLD OF STORIES
With 30 missions and over 40 runs worth of gameplay, you become the hero in an epic story of humanityâ€™s struggle for survival where your running *really* matters - and thereâ€™s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well...

YOUR OWN MIX
Choose your own custom playlists before you start running: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings.

INTERVAL TRAINING - WITH ZOMBIES
With our optional â€˜Zombie Chasesâ€™ mode, youâ€™ll need to increase your speed and work up a sweat if you hear zombies on your tail. Thatâ€™s right - weâ€™ve made interval training *fun*!

KEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE
You automatically collect items like medicine, batteries, and ammo while running - but when you're back home, who needs them more: the soldiers or the doctors? Which buildings need extra defenses? Itâ€™s up to you - and the bigger your base, the more missions you can play.
