The Fall

by Ed Brubaker, Jason Lutes (Illustrator)

Kirk, a down on his luck convenience store clerk, uses a stolen credit card and gets himself caught up in an unsolved murder case almost ten years old. Featuring illustrations by Jason Lutes (BERLIN, JAR OF FOOLS), THE FALL is a lo-fi thriller in the tradition of Jim Thompson and Roman Polanski.
