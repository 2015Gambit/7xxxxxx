,soletar,2012-02-29T05:40Z,"Dear MM82,

Thanks for all ur efforts. I have made many requests in the past, some u granted, others u didnt . but i like the fact that even the ones u didnt grant, u gave an explanation/excuse (feedback to ur fans,LOL).
Please i have a request again. i find hustler comics (the collection) very raunchy and funny, i found some on rapidshare but i have very slow internet speeds so i prefer torrents...pls upload. I hope you are not too religious a person otherwise u might find my request appalling (just joking).

I remember u saying you didnt remember Conan-Island of no return which u uploaded. Believe me it really ignited my interest in comics which its amazing artwork and graphic violence. THANKS alot for all ur efforts"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-02-29T12:33Z,"soletar:I have issues from 01-09 somewhere and if I locate them I'll upload them,can't tell you when that'll be...sorry...I remember about Island of no return only Sears artwork,which I didn't like few years ago,but he has greatly improved his art over the last few years so I'm kinda digging it now..."
,MuserClair,2012-02-29T23:11Z,thanks for the up :)
,soletar,2012-03-01T05:18Z,"
Thanks alot MM82... As i said i apprc8 the time you take in responding to us all.... i wonder how big the Hustler comics would be, i am really looking forward to it ( i check ur torrents everyday so i am likely to see it when u upload, it has become an obsession). Any of Sears' work that you recommend? Have a nice day and stay cool!"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-03-01T12:54Z,soletar:check this one out if you haven't already http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6852511/THE_HELM
