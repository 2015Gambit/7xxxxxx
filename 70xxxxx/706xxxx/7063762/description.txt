Details:

Delilah is yet another talented young singer from the UK who has a penchant for embracing the more experimental side of Top 40 pop music. Initially making her breakthrough via a guest spot on Chase & Status`s most recent album, she then went on to record a solid #17 chart position with her debut solo effort Go.

Delilah has been tipped for big things in 2012 with a lot of the hype riding on the quality of her forthcoming debut album From The Roots Up, but she has still found time to put together a mixtape called 2-4AM which should get people talking again after she ruled herself out of inclusion in the BBC Sound of 2012 list.
