Logon:

Optional note about Logon: When Windows 7 is installed it requires you to enter at least one name of a user who will access the computer. Once you create this name, the default "Administrator" account vanishes. Only the User neame appears on Logon screen with Admin credentials. If you want to see both Administrator and User name on logon screen do the following: In the Start Menu, select Run. On CMD dialogue type "Net user administrator /active:yes" (without quotes) press Enter and restart. The Log On screen with the available User and Administrator accounts in parallel will be displayed.

Look at the pics below:

Name of ISO: Win7SP1_2012.iso
Size: 3.83 GB
Default Language: English
-Installation: Burn ISO on DVD and boot from it.
-During Setup press Skip or Next on screen when asked to enter product key.
-Check your BIOS if it is set to boot from CD/DVD.
For some "naughty" types of controllers, so that the installer does not see hard drives use your own USB with "your" drivers. If there is a problem in the installation process click "Upload" and select the folder from the USB with the appropriate driver. Remove check mark from the "Show only signed drivers" and install.
