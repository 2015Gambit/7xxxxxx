2012 release, the fifth album from the British singer/songwriter. Secret Symphony is an exquisite collection of songs that perfectly showcases that unique, instantly recognizable voice. Those songs include `All Over The World' (Franâ€¡oise Hardy), `Gold In Them Hills' (Ron Sexsmith), `Nobody Knows You' (Jimmie Cox) and `Moonshine' (Fran Healy). Katie's also written her own song `Forgetting All My Troubles', and she teams up with manager and producer Mike Batt on `Heartstrings' and `Lone Wolf'. Batt also contributes title track `Secret Symphony', `The Walls Of The World', `Better Than A Dream' and `The Bit That I Don't Get'. The result is a collaboration that imbues the songs with a distinct personality that could only be the work of this creative team. The record allows Katie's distinctive voice and the songs to truly shine.
