,couger11,2012-03-14T10:16Z,"wtf is up with these mp4 files now eztv?
I used to ""ALWAYS check that the torrent was added by eztv"" now I have to check that it isnt.

The avi's play great, no matter what computer or operating system I happen to be using; and to all those people who love the mp4 and it hundred variations- I have no interest in throwing all all my money at microsoft just to have the newest version of windows and media player that is out this year."
,AtariMeow,2012-03-18T05:41Z,"I do not understand why all you people are crying about the torrents being MP4. 
One: They are a smaller size which means you can store more on a hard drive and you can download more files if you're on a limited plan. Two: VLC media player plays ANY file. If you don't have it, you can download it here: http://www.any-video-converter.com/products/for_video_free/
Three: It's FREE. Not happy with the format? Wait for the DVD and pay for it then. 
Four: http://www.any-video-converter.com/products/for_video_free/ Here's a program you can use to convert the MP4's to your precious AVI file.
The End."
,funseeker521,2012-03-23T16:51Z,@couger11 I don't understand what you are talking about. I can play this on my 11 year old dell with xp pro or my year old pc with Windows 7. Perhaps your retardation is blocking you!
,gazzazh,2012-05-12T18:21Z,"Ok, First i would like to thank you for uploading the file. Second.. I understand that Vlc plays all the files on windows, and that Mp4 is smaller is size. But AVI was more convenient. It plays on all other machines including TV that have built in USB ports.. Perviously all i had to do was download the torrent, put in on a usb and watch on my tv.. I would just like to say that AVI was better.. and thank you for making this available previously and i hope that one day we will go back to AVi... Thanks "
