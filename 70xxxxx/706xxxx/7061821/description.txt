Details:

Minneapolis quartet High on Stress are about perseverance. Their third album Living Is a Dying Art digs even further into the darker niches of DIY garage rock. They like to get in your face and under your skin, serving up their songs with bravado. They rant and ramble about bad luck (Figure Eights) and conjure up travelogues (Some Things Look Better in Pictures, Coattail Rider).

With this album they proof there's a future for bar bands who insist on doing their own stuff and ignore the shouted cover requests from the inebriated clientele (they make a n exception when they are invited for Replacements tribute shows). Recommended if you like Big Star, Graham Parker and Brinsley Schwarz.
