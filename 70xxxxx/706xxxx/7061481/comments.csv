,LOLren,2012-08-20T21:51Z,"You need to mount iron-lcdawbs.cue to view the video files.

Install Daemon tools then double click the .cue file and a window will pop up with all the video files. 

If the window doesn't pop then just goto My Computer and right click on the mounted drive and ""Open in new window"" 

Easy as pieee.

Thanks MsB1982!"

Any chance you can get the ""addendum"" course to this with the same instructor: Dreamweaver and WP: Building MOBILE Sites?
That would be so awesome because no one else has put it up yet. Anywhere."
