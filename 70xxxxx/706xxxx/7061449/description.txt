Details:

The Consequence was a band that started in 2002 by high school friends JP Makhlouf, Sam Frisch, Mike Diroma & Jeff Sayers. They started as a pop punk band and found their way to a more alternative rock sound with time. Aside from their use of 3 part harmony, one other important aspect of the band that made them stand out was that they recorded, produced, and engineered their own music in JP's basement studio. They released their First 5 song EP titled "Your Own Place" in Summer of 2003.
