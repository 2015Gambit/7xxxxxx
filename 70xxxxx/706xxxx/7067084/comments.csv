,ITFUncleDave,2012-03-03T03:49Z,"Okay, so for some reason that torrent would just stop at 87.5% even if you had the files and even if i was trying to seed to you. DUNNOWHYLOL. In any case, use this magnet instead.

,ITFUncleDave,2012-03-03T04:08Z,...and remember to remove the old .torrent from your list before adding that magnet.
