Synopsis:
Satyajit Ray was an artist in two mediums - brush and film. This documentary explores his genius in both and shows how one influenced the other. It goes on to talk of his artistry in music, with words and his versatility. While doig so, Nitish Mukherjee uses a lot of archival material, including book and magazine covers designed by Ray. A collectors piece for any one who is interested in Ray.

Comments:
The best part of tis one hour documentary is the use of book and magazine covers designed by Satyajit Ray, which shows his mastery over pen and brush. The film also gives pictures drawn by Ray in his workbook, to tell us how he had looked at every single screen and sketched it beforehand. It shows how his use of colour was often dictated by his sketching. Its a film that has a lot of insight into the mind of Satajit Ray the artist.

I also liked the sparing use of narrative. As the film unfolds there is very little pretetious attempt to educate you and me. Instead the Director merely lets the paintings and film clips talk for themselves. The spoken or the wirtten words are used with parsimony, adding to our enjoyment.

If I have two grouses they are that the filmmaker leaves out Rays experiments with typography - he does talk about Rays calligraphy but fails to mention the Ray Roman font and that there is no new insight. It tells us what we mostly know... but it does it with a lot of reverence. It's truly a tribute to a Master.

Uploader's Notes:
They quality of the film varies from outstanding to the abysmal. The black and white sequences are grainy and overexposed but the use of colour is very pleasing. Prabuddha Raha does a fine job with the music including singing some of the songs. Editing is competent. Overall the use of grain in the film is somewhat excessive. It wa a bit difficult to make a good rip of this documentary. Whether I have succeeded I leave the viewer to decide.
