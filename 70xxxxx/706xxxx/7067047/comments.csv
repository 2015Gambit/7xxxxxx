,codyormoe,2012-03-08T15:12Z,I've seeded for a week and shared over 100 times. I'm going to stop seeding this for a while so I can seed other torrents. I hope everyone who's downloaded will keep it going.
,thenaughtons,2012-04-17T02:02Z,Thanks. works perfectly! converted wbfs file to iso with wiibackup manger. then loaded onto wii hard drive with wbfs manager 3.0. i have a soft modded PAL 4.3E system and the NTSC file worked through USB loader GX (load setting on auto patch). also works with Neogamma.
