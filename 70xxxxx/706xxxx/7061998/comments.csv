,Uthgaard,2012-05-26T10:47Z,"Thanks for the great uploads, arabic is the only language I can't install completely and get working speech recognition. I do know what I'm doing - did it with the other ISO - but the folder structure is different here.

Can you double check the files and either advise how to install so speech recognition will work, or upload a self-extracting installer for arabic?

Thanks."
