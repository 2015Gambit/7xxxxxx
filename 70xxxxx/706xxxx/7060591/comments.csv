This ""documentary"" really is not a documentary. It's a bunch of video clips loosely put together presumably in chronological order but it's hard to tell. They should have edited it more and put more background information for the viewer.

Also, you don't know if they actually climbed the mountain or not. It just doesn'tt say. So the description of this ""documentary"" is misleading. It just ends.

I'm assuming part 1 is more of the same thing."
