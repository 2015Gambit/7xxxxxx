Honkytonk Man [1982]

Red Stovall is a Depression-era rascal whose fire-in-the-belly passion comes
from the whiskey he slugs and the dream he chases: singing at the Grand Ole
Opery. He takes off on a drive from Oklahoma to audition in Nashville with
nephew Whit along to help car on the road and Red on the straight and narrow.
