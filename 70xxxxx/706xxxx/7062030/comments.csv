TO THE BIG BANG THEORY
As clearly seen, the Big Bang theory proved that the universe was
created from nothing, in other words, that it was created by Allah. For this
reason, astronomers committed to the materialist philosophy continued to
resist the Big Bang and uphold the steady-state theory. The reason for this
effort was revealed in the following words of A. S. Eddington, one of the
foremost materialist physicists: Philosophically, the notion of an abrupt
beginning to the present order of Nature is repugnant to me.
Sir Fred Hoyle was one of those who were disturbed by the Big Bang
theory. In the middle of the century, Hoyle championed a theory called the
steady-state which was similar to the constant universe approach of the
19th century. The steady-state theory argued that the universe was both
infinite in size and eternal in duration. With the sole visible aim of supporting
the materialist philosophy, this theory was totally at variance with
the Big Bang theory, which held that the universe had a beginning.
Those who defended the steady-state theory opposed the Big Bang
for a long time. Science, however, was working against them.
Some scientists, on the other hand, looked for ways to develop alternatives.
In 1948, George Gamov came up with another idea concerning the
Big Bang. He stated that after the formation of the universe by a big explosion,
a radiation surplus should have existed in the universe left over from
this explosion. Moreover, this radiation ought to be uniformly diffused
across the universe.
This evidence which ,ought to have existed was soon to be found.

,wallmartysec,2012-02-28T16:34Z,"Of course, religious people will always be biased towards a small universe created by their imaginary god. But the facts are: nobody has found limits for the universe, the more powerful the telescopes, there is always something beyond, nobody has ever proved that anything can be created from nothing, in the universe everything is transformed, so there must have been something before the big-bang, therefore the view of an eternal and infinite universe, like I provide in my image, is the most rational and according to the perceived universe by us. It is only necessary for astronomers to find galaxies expanding in different directions from our own to show this to be the correct interpretation, without imaginary gods coming into the picture..."

 Trying is Free :)"
,wallmartysec,2012-02-28T19:28Z,"Ive read the quran itself and was horrified at its ridiculous claims and assertions, so there is no need to read what believers concoct in order to defend it. Time is too precious to be wasted that way."

,raenkae,2012-03-01T19:18Z,"Just as you wallmartysec, I have gazed into the multiverse and found it beautiful. All existence is by FAR more beautiful and amazing than ANY old book by desert tribes uses to trap the mind of the poor and the gullible. Especially the sheer SIZE of it is FAR more complex and larger than any old ""profet"" ever could have dreamed of!
Thank you! You have showed me that there are a lot more people like me out there that have liberated their minds from the old evil dogma of religion.

As you I feel that superstition and greedy theocracy must be combated where ever it rear its ugly head! I want to fight for the thruth and the search for knowledge.

wallmartysec! You give me hope for the liberation of the human mind!"

wallmartysec is a bigot, racist, and likely fat, lazy, and semi-retarded - so American."
,wallmartysec,2012-03-11T08:49Z,"Thank you !  The hatred of neo-nazi turds is a badge of honor for me. If you praised me, then I would worry..."
