My view of the macro-universe, in which we live in a small part of it, infinite, unlimited, godless, with many big-bangs happening all over for ever and ever. A harmonious, impressive, rational view of reality as I perceive it. We only need for astronomers to find galaxies expanding in a different direction than ours to show this view to be right. I find it satisfying until further discoveries are made, do you?
