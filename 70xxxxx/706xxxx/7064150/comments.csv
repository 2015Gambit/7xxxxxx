I was just thinking a few days ago when watching Immortals, about what a nice lad used to be Mickey Rourke, and how he changed, and the first movie (from his youth) that came to my mind was 9 1/2 weeks... 25 years passed, and at least he's still acting, so it could be worse than having a bad guy face...
Thanks again!"
