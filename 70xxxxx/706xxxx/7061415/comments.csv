,theislandman,2012-02-27T19:25Z,These have been put up many times......Does anyone have levels 4 & 5 Italian?
,ragnarok_falls,2012-04-03T21:17Z,Anyone got level 4 and 5? 
,madsal,2012-04-08T09:55Z,This install requires a activation key to use full version.  Where do I get the key?
,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-09T12:55Z,"@madsal,

The v3 of the program is needed to install and activate the language pack(s)
The v3.4.7 of the program is needed to install and run (correctly) language pack(s) levels 4 and 5.
(even though you don't have levels 4 & 5 for Italian, you still want the upgrade for other benefits)
Most of the level 4 and 5 language packs require v3.3.7 or HIGHER (v3.4.7) to install and run (correctly).

1. Block internet
2. Install program (V3), DO NOT run program.

3. Copy files (crack program and Licencingdll.DLL) from Crack folder to program folder where Rosetta Stone is installed and run it.
(if the crack sets off your AV software, IGNORE IT! I've used this same program for over a year without any problems)
4. Block Rosetta Stone program from internet access.
5. Set your firewall to ""allow trusted outbound"" ONLY! (or the equivalent.)
(if you block ALL internet access, you may get a 1117 error, speech component for voice recognition.)
6. Do NOT update the program!
7. Install language levels 1, 2 & 3.
8. Install v3.4.7 in the same folder as v3
(overwrite the contents).

9. Install language levels 4 & 5.

You SHOULD be set.

Let me know...

,madsal,2012-04-10T06:56Z,"Well you got me...I install V3, copy the contents of the patch folder into the rosetta stone folder (it says copy and replace the DLL, I click yes) then I run the patch.  After that I run the program and it just hangs in the task tray.  The first time it installed but wouldn't recongnize the language file, nothing since that time."

Sorry for not getting back sooner, 
I've never had this problem before, so I'll have to check into it more.
1. What version of Windows are you running?
2. Did you get any error messages?

It may be a corrupt DL, that's all I can think of right off the to of my head.

,Florencing,2012-05-07T19:02Z,"Sorry about that last post. I was wondering if there was anyway you could tell a complete newbie to this torrenting deal how to go about setting up your program on my computer. I d/l WinRaR, and extracted the files but all that did was bring up more unrecognizable programs. I'm sure it's due to my error and inexperience. Thanks a lot."
,ticks619,2012-05-13T05:31Z,"do you have Rosetta stone italian 123 for the mac possibly, it would be greatly appreciated"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-15T15:42Z,"TO ALL:

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar""

Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file

Click ""Never register""
At the activation screen, click ""Continue"" 
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean.
