,DanoSutts,2012-02-28T03:06Z,"Great work mate!! Didnt think anyone would of been able to get this one on here!! I know im probably taking the piss now but the misses has been looking for hollyoaks but to no avail, any chance...??"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-28T03:15Z,There are too many episodes of Hollyoaks to upload!! I could not sustain that large amount! It is a daily show and I have a limit to my download quota! Sorry I can't help you there :(
,DanoSutts,2012-02-28T09:53Z,No worries mate just didnt no if you could of done like the omnibus on sundays thats all!!
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-28T10:55Z,"I would really really like to help you, but, as you can see it takes forever to get just these 8 episodes I have uploaded! My upload speed is shite!!
I'm not sure what you mean by omnibus on Sundays?? Is that like 1 episode a week? If it is that, I should be able to do that."
,DanoSutts,2012-02-28T11:00Z,"No honestly mate its fine dont worry about it, omnibus is where they show all of the weeks programs but one after the other, but again would be like 5 episodes so would take a long time to upload. Will you be doing the new series of made in chelsea when it comes out Gaz?"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-28T12:21Z,I hope to! I have in the past. It just really depends on whether I can continue to get lucky and find the episodes! I am very confident that I will be :)
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-28T19:32Z,"If nobody helps me seed this, I won't be able to do requests again. I may not be seeing this correctly, but, 4 people have downloaded this and I am still the only seed."
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-29T01:48Z,"I WOULD NOT ADVISE DOWNLOADING THIS TORRENT ANYMORE!! Nobody is helping me seed it, and I am not going to either in a few hours. It's a shame, but that's how it goes :(
Lucky TOWIE and MIC torrents are a different story when it comes to people sharing. I am not going to post any more requests, coz the same thing always happens. Hitters and runners :("
,DanoSutts,2012-02-29T02:57Z,"Sorry mate im trying to seed but its still downloading for me, taking quite a while to be honest, getting a very slow download speed :("
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-29T03:41Z,"Oh. I know that 4 people have completely downloaded all 8 episodes and have stopped seeding it within 10 minutes each. There are other torrent sites that leech off the Pirate Bay, so those people would not be reading these posts. Still, it is common knowledge, SEED! There are 3 people above 80% at the moment. Once they hit 100%, i'm off this torrent."
,HDrocks,2012-02-29T05:00Z,Thanks Gary i am downloading this now and i will seed for a while :-) any chance you could upload more episodes of Jedwards big adventure? 
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-29T05:23Z,"I have only managed to find those 3 episodes. I keep looking for more to upload, but the original uploader stopped at 3! I promise I'll try, but this particular one may be a little tough :("
,darkness_weaving,2012-03-05T07:01Z,Thanks for this - I'll seed for a couple of months on this as I always do for torrents that have low seeders that I know other expats will want to watch.  Would watch it on ITV player but it keeps freezing and randomly starting from the beginning half way through which is driving me nuts.  Would be grateful  for the new episodes as well :)
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-03-05T08:18Z,Thanks so much. I will seed it all the times I have not uploaded a fresh episode of a show. So you don't carry all the weight. I have uploaded episode 9 here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7077943/Take_Me_Out-_Season_3-_Episode_09.avi and will do my best to get you guys the episodes as they come out :)
,jonny8ball,2012-03-29T18:33Z,"PLEEEEEEEASE SEED!!!!! Been trying to download this torrent for days now :( I will seed for long time once ive got it, Im oversees and dieing to catch up with this great show....

SEED SEED SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-02T08:45Z,"Sorry, I didn't check these comments. If anyone needs me to re-seed one of my torrents, post that request on the last thing I have uploaded. That way I will definitely see it. I will seed this till there are 2 or 3 more seeds :)"
,BBfan,2012-07-16T07:08Z,Thanks for this.
,BBfan,2012-08-22T06:46Z,This show is pretty funny. I wish i got to see more  seasons. I didn't even know the UK had this show. Until i watched the copycat U.S based one.
