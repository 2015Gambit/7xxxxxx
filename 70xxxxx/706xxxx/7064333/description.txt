This is Samuel Chavkin's shocking book Mind Stealers - Psychosurgery and Mind Control (1978) which is a hard-hitting expose of the coming uses of psychosurgery and technological control over our minds. All over the world neurosurgeons are now at work modifying or 'curing' drug addicts, alcoholics, homosexuals, neurotics and other 'deviants'. The hundreds of thousands of children diagnosed as hyperactive are drugged into passivity. Juvenile offenders are subjected to imprisonment, and given behavior modifying, drug injections. Adult prisoners, mostly from lower economic rungs, serve as guinea pigs for 'aversive therapy' programs. Patients in mental hospitals forcibly undergo ultrasound treatment (laundered lobotomy). Finding predictive techniques for weeding out the 'potentially violence-prone' among us is a burgeoning science. Legal protections against psychotechnology are constantly eroded. Big Brother telemetry for the surveillance of every citizen is on the drawing board. Chavkin's prediction that mind control techniques could become standard equipment of government, prisons and police departments is backed by forceful documentation in which he names agencies, and professionals participating in such programs. Mind Stealers is an important, shocking book that will provoke controversy and outrage. 220 pages. A must read for everyone.
