Rocky Horror Picture Show - Entire Movie - Read Description

320 CBR mp3


No commercial RHPS album has ever been released with ALL of the movie's music included. Worse, the commercial CD has edited the songs to remove sections that rely on the visuals. For example, the entire tap dance has been removed from Time Warp. This torrent contains high quality rips of every note from every song.

Any cast trying to learn their parts or put on a performance with the commercial CD will be missing key music and develop screwed up cues.

I have ripped the DVD to lossless audio, and then individually ripped each song to 320 CBR mp3 files, and labeled them to set up smooth timing cues. I have also included certain songs as singles that are only part of a medley in the film, as well as finishing up with the entire movie so any one downloading this can make any individually needed file.

This torrent is mostly meant for RHPS casts who need movie accurate music to work with, but any real RHPS fan who wants ALL the music will like this torrent.
