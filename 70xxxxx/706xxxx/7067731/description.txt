Aired Tomorrow

"Pilot" 

After a car accident, Detective 
Michael Britten discovers that he is 
living one life where his wife Hannah 
survived and he has a rookie partner 
named Vega, and dreaming another life 
where his son Rex lived instead and 
Michael works with his long-time 
partner, Bird. However, Michael isn't 
sure if he isn't dreaming his life 
with Hannah. Each day he alternates 
waking up in one reality or the 
other, and tries to cope with what 
may be his insanity.

Evolve...or die.

I guess most people with an interest 
in this show likely already watched
the itunes, vod, or site stream. But
there has not been a pre yet, so 
this rectifies that.

Enjoy :)
