Description
The Ultimate Warrior is backâ€¦ 

Barbarian, the cult game first released on Amstrad CPC in 1987 under the name Death Sword (Epyx), is making a comeback with an all-new version that remains faithful to the original. 

Your mission, as the most formidable of all warriors, is to rescue Princess Mariana from the clutches of the evil wizard Drax. In doing so, you will travel the world, crossing swords with the many blood-thirsty warriors that block your path. 
Prepare to die ! 

Gameplay: 
Barbarian replicates the intense playability of the original game, which, with a single attack button and eight movement directions, offered a total of eight attack combinations, including the notorious decapitation move, four dodge and four defense moves. With death lurking in every desperate duel, the slightest slip could prove to be fatal.

â™  Gory combats where the blood flows fast and the slightest mistake could end in death. 
â™  Epic, lifelike duels in which you will suffer horrific wounds. 
â™  Superb 3D settings in a Dark Fantasy universe. 
â™  The original Barbarian theme music. 
â™  Two player levels: â€œNormalâ€ and â€œhardcoreâ€, for the most battle-hardened players.

â™¦ Gory tasks for you to achieve, such as â€œDecapitate 50 enemiesâ€.
