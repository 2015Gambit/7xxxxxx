,Little.Wonder,2012-02-27T18:25Z,"I have registered just so I can comment on this crap torrent.
You know how Billy Crystal spoofs all the films in his opening filmed piece?
How would that be if it had two Korean guys talking in their native tongue all over it?
Well, that's what happens here.
I don't know what else they ruined as I have just deleted this torrent.

I am about to jump on this torrent
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7061341/Oscars.2012.With.Fredrik.and.Filip.Swedish.WMV-SwedenArise
which, despite the fact it has ""Swedish"" in its title, states
Spoken language(s):   English
Texted language(s):    English

It's over 2.5 GB, but at this point, I don't see any other choice.

,WaltCD,2012-02-27T18:27Z,"Others have already noted the Korean commentary.
That being said, the video is okay, but I couldn't get the audio to work (easily). I'd recommend skipping  this and look for another.

BEWARE of another torrent labeled with GCD, because it is the SAME file as this!"
,.Leto.,2012-02-27T19:10Z,"I don't know why you're all so mad. It's clearly said in the description that this is a south korean broadcast (Broadcast : CH.CGV south korea, cable channel), so why are you so surprised to hear them talk in Korean???"

It also clearly says ""Spoken language(s):    English"" which is misleading.
This is an English language programme interrupted by Korean commentary.
This renders it unwatchable to me and many other non-Korean speakers.
Actually, if they spoke English it would still be annoying as The Oscars don't need a commentary!
