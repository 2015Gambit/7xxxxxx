Sequel to the excellent "Great Rod Race" this time around Matt Hayes and Mick Brown must trade in lbs of caught fish for miles to travel from the west coast of Ireland to the east coast of England.

From the man himself:

"The Greater Rod Race

Mick Brown and I return in a follow-up series to the 2004 smash hit The Great Rod Race.

The Greater Rod Race is a 15 part travel/adventure series in which we travel from the west coast of Ireland to the east coast of England visiting the very best fishing locations to be found along the way.

The challenge is to catch as many fish in weight as miles travelled. From Sea Fishing, River Fishing and Fishery locations we go through all kinds of weather and use every fishing trick in the book to complete the challenge.

Join us on our adventure and pick up all our top tips."


Anyone who loves fishing will love this! I have 10Mbit upload so don't worry that 5 dvds is such a lot, it'll be seeded fully.

If anyone can help me out I have two fishing requests that I've never been able to get filled:


1. Matt Hayes: Buena Vista Fishing Club
Ten-part series filmed in Cuba which sees me travel across the whole country in an old Lada with a fishing rod for company. The programme's show what a great place to fish Cuba really is.



2. Jeremy Wade: Jungle Hooks Amazonian Giant
Series where Jeremy travels from Brazil in 2002, includes him surviving a plane crash and being persuaded to compete in a local fishing competition while he tries to catch a giant arapaima.


Seen both of these myself but my wife hasn't and we fish together these days If anyone can share them here that'd be great, or if they prefer to share privately I can then share here myself.
