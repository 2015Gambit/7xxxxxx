,ahoi1,2012-02-29T18:54Z,"So, is this any good? Or shit just like the other sequels (except BooH)?

Given that there was like zero advertisment for this title (the official forum has not a single user generated post) I fear the worst."
,SuperFulcrum,2012-02-29T19:21Z,"ok i know you are just an uploader but WTH is wargame european escalation,release date is:Feb 22, 2012"
,RMJ113,2012-02-29T20:29Z,"this game is the same as the original , Graphic updates is a joke !"
,RMJ113,2012-02-29T20:31Z,"to change your ""res"" you have to create a game save first play till u get to  CHECK POINT, THEN LEAVE THE GAME

On xp go here  C:\Documents and Settings\""WHAT EVER YOUR NAME IS ON YOUR PC""\Local Settings\Application Data\Painkiller Recurring Evil

open the ""RE.ini"" file with note pad,  scroll down till you find    Cfg.Resolution = ""1920x1200"" change it to what ever you want , SAVE the change

restart the game

on WIndows 7  C:\USER\""WHAT EVER YOUR NAME IS ON YOUR PC""\AppData\Painkiller Recurring Evil    some thing like that!


If your unsure of what u are doing , just copy this file to your desktop , for a back up!"

,TaleMunja,2012-03-06T00:12Z,Tnx for this.
,gask8,2012-03-15T14:08Z,"   its just another sorry ass game! dont waste time on this, thereÂ´s a lot of better games out there."
,torpedo19681001,2012-03-16T09:16Z,save problems! :(
,torpedo19681001,2012-03-16T09:18Z,save problems! :( 
,colinb74,2012-03-25T04:57Z,"@gask8 - This has NEVER been a sorry ass game.. I am just sorry your ass cannot play it properly. The very first painkiller was pretty much ahead of its time when it came out. these developers do a great job with this game... I support these guys, I buy all painkillers from steam and they are not expensive. With that said I cannot at the present afford the new one so a big thanks to extremezone, yet again, for a great upload! Sorry for the rant, I am just a big fan of these games and they do not deserve bad press!"
,LoydMongo,2012-04-17T19:22Z,"Thanks, this seems to be a good rip. But how do you change the destination folder when installing? After the language selection it goes straight to installing into my C: drive and that sucks balls."
,pa1ner,2012-06-03T08:51Z,Worst painkiller ever...
