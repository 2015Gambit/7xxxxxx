RELEASE NOTES

Battle never ceases in the realm known as Hell. This time around it's a
battle for the freedom of your very soul. Will you be able to escape
from the prison hidden in the darkest deepest chasm of Hell? Do you
have enough courage to travel through the most dangerous and twisted
areas which are infamous for their unsafety even among demons
themselves? Are you prepared to significantly reduce the demonic
population of these areas?

Once again you'll have a chance to experience the magnificent dark
atmosphere of the good (or evil?) Painkiller, the only true oldschool
First Person Shoot, tough as nails, without a trace of remorse, without
a glimpse of motion blur or other technological makeup. Just Painkiller
and nothing else matters

Features:

5 completely new levels with impressive locations like an Angkor
temple, a massive old warehouse and a highway where hundreds of cars
crashed.

A new campaign guarantees for 5 hours of new and genuine Painkiller
action

Even more bloodshed and action per square meter: immerse into freaking
intense gameplay & ultimately challenging FPS action

More dense maps and sick enemies than ever before: kill over 6.000
uniquely spawned wicked monsters

Continues the story of Bill Sherman

Improved graphics, AI, environments as well as new atmospheric
soundtrack
