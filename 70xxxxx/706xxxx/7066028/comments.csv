Tried many times to install and when you get to the last screen of the installation the ""next"" button will not light up and so the installation can't continue and get by the last screen. After copying all the files for installation, you get left with the screen that says ""ready when you are"" and you can't click the faded out next button. I also tried burning to a different disk with exactly the same results."
