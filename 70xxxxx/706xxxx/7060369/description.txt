When_a_City_Falls_NZ_docu_Feb2012_Actual_Footage_Main_Quakes_&_Aftershocks avi xvid

New Zealand Quakes documentary

1.30hr combining people amateur and phone cam footage seconds after
the quake hit and the aftershocks, news footage and a docu makers
efforts most of which was on the other competing docu a_shocking_reminder

this one is better i think as has more real footage and less interviews

gets better like 20min in to 80min where you see the buildings
fall while filming in day time

enjoy and HELP ME SEED THIS!
