,unnim2,2012-02-28T06:49Z,thanks very much
[T],iamgreat,2012-02-28T09:35Z,"This is from CIII, Global Toronto - a REAL capture from the channel, not one of the LOL graphic overlay mock-ups. Notice the coloured, animated bug that LOL can't fake. 

If any of you are wondering, the preemption on FOX did affect broadcast of Alcatraz in Canada. Citytv had sufficient notice of the change and so they put up a repeat of an earlier episode and will have 2 hours of new Alcatraz next Monday. At least according to the schedule they have posted at the time of my writing this. "
,trombinho,2012-02-28T09:53Z,thnx!
,alemeyo,2012-02-28T10:04Z,"good quality download
thanks a lot
i'm seedind back"
,RDawgg,2012-02-28T10:41Z,"Idunno what iamgreat is talking about, but the quality is as usual, the sound is a bit better maybe"
[T],iamgreat,2012-02-28T11:51Z,"RDawgg, of course this quality is as usual for a 2HD release. If you live in Canada and can watch on real tv the shows LOL releases you would know that LOL overlays Canadian broadcasters' logos on clean feeds of the shows. LOL hasn't released a show from an actual broadcast from Canada in over 6 years, possibly as far back as the days when analogue rips were standard practice.  House was actually on Global last night despite the preemption on FOX. LOL's mp4 release claims to be from the same broadcast on the Toronto station of Global (that is the only station which doesn't have the city name in the bug)  that 2HD's comes from. They should have exactly the same programme rating and broadcaster's bug on a frame by frame comparison. They don't. 2HD's is from broadcast and LOL's is mocked up to appear from a broadcast. With the avi/mp4 split among scene groups there are competing releases claiming to be from the same channel from LOL and 2HD. See also last night's 2HD and LOL releases of Hart Of Dixie. There are 3 stations in all of Canada which carry Hart Of Dixie but only 1 of them broadcasts the show at a time that would allow for the releases to come available when they do - CHCH in Hamilton, Ontario. LOL's and 2HD's releases for that show should match frame by frame as they claim to be from the same channel but they don't.  CHCH didn't have a programme rating at the start of the show in the upper left corner but LOL's release does. LOL's lacks the CHCH bug whereas 2HD's release has it. LOL doesn't have a logo for the Canadian broadcaster of Criminal Minds so they blur it to hide the fact that there is no bug in the video. If you don't live where you can watch House or Hawaii Five-0 on Global or Criminal Minds on CTV Two or Body Of Proof on Citytv then you might never know LOL's releases aren't from actual broadcasts on those networks or that 2HD's are. Most people don't care. Now the proof is out there for anyone who wants to download both formats and compare them. That, RDawgg, is what i am talking about. "

Thanks for the info on LOL/2HD. Can you tell us what is the PB user that posts 2HD releases, so we can dl them instead of LOL mock-ups?"
,shadowpdf,2012-02-28T17:46Z,"I'm confused ... The link for the standard torrent download is missing.  Only the magnet torrent is available, and I can't figure out how to use that.  For some reason I can't get to any website right now other than Pirate Bay.  I've got uTorrent, which I'm assuming should be able to handle a magnet torrent, but I'm stuck.  Any help would be appreciated."
,Citizen8,2012-02-28T19:56Z,"Magnet link is not working (4 me).. anybody know why?
I'm using u-torrent."
,Citizen8,2012-02-28T20:04Z,Magnet link is not working for me.. anybody?
,aapnootmies1414,2012-02-28T20:18Z,also me I cannot download this torrent the button is missing
,gigahertz21,2012-02-28T23:13Z,"Nice, have to download this episode since my DVR recorded the Daytona crap instead.  "
,gigahertz21,2012-02-28T23:20Z,"Magnet link works fine, just use utorrent and make sure utorrent is associated with magnet links, you can do that in the options for utorrent.

Piratebay is switching to nothing but magnet links, guess you guys haven't seen the news?

,shadowpdf,2012-02-29T00:40Z,"gigahertz ... Just found out that Pirate is all magnet.  Still not sure how to work it.  I've clicked; I have associated with uTorrent, but when I add it to my download list nothing seems to happen and uTorrent reports that the chosen download is 0 megabytes.  That's not how much has been downloaded, but how much is supposed to be downloaded.  Read on one site that it could take a while for the torrent to kick in and get the info it needs to download. Does that sound right????"
,highlander_net,2012-02-29T05:21Z,thanks!
,aapnootmies1414,2012-02-29T14:33Z,"I found the problem in Utorrent. When the srceen opens and you found it empty. You see there""Torrent options"". Fill in there ""place the torrent on top"". In dutch ""bovenaan wachtrij plaatsen: Then the download start."
,azngung,2012-02-29T21:45Z,great upload eztv
,PostTenebras,2012-03-02T01:19Z,"I've found that Bittorrent has always worked the best and has the most stable versions. uTorrent is simply a smaller model based on Bittorrent (Bittorrent was a pioneer in its time). 


So when TPB switched over to all magnet links, I found that my updated version of Bittorrent handled them fine and there is no time difference between the magnet links and the classic hosted .torrent files. 


If you are having any problems with uTorrent or magnet links, I'd say the easiest fix is to switch over to Bittorrent!

~Cheers!"
,spoonman0306,2012-03-15T23:50Z,Are you going to put up the latest episode? Please do if you can I've been waiting all week for it...
,DaBoogieman3317,2012-03-18T00:04Z,my lady eternally loves you. thanx
,viperious,2012-03-20T08:43Z,"Utorrent works fine with the magnet links...been using utorrent for years and it has always worked perfectly for me....so I am guessing if it doesnt work, you have done something wrong to it..."
,fallisg97,2012-03-28T16:18Z,were is episode 15!??
