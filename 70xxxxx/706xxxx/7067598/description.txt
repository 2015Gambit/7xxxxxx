"One of the very first progressive bands in France, Eden Rose, has formally released only one album. However, Eden Rose and Sandrose, whose eponymous album of 1972 features the same line-up plus a female vocalist Rose Podwojny, can in many ways be regarded as the same outfit. On the other hand, "On the Way to Eden" is the brainchild of Henri Garella, while the main mastermind of "Sandrose" was Jean-Pierre Alarcen. But well, my main object is to review this obscure musical object, and not to be occupied with conjectures and deductions".
