,Ashle3,2012-02-28T03:51Z,Since when are eztv torrents mp4?? 
,dukeford57,2012-02-28T04:23Z,THE MP4 FILES ARE SOME BS CRAP UPS PUT OUT BY LOL AND SOME OF THE OTHER GROUPS. WAIT FOR THE FQM  OR 2HD RELEASE. THEY'RE STILL AVI AND BEST QUALITY. NOT LOW RES LIKE MP4.
,naboom,2012-02-28T06:22Z,"@dukeford57, are you serious?  This file uses the h.264 codec, which results in BETTER quality files than divx/xvid at a SMALLER size.

The main reason most people download avi files is because most divx players can't play mp4/mkv files."
