,srujan90,2012-02-29T08:17Z,Hey.....why is that i cant download the torrent??...there's only an option to get the torrent....no option to download the torrent file...
,drantal,2012-02-29T09:27Z,"@srujan90 i think the pirate bay got rid of its standard torrent files because it doesn't want to host torrents on its own servers anymore (probably due to all the government crackdowns). A magnet link is essentially the same thing, except it directs ur torrent client to the person who uploaded the torrent rather than the the pirate bay. I'm using the magnet link for this torrent and it's working fine. "
