"Unfortunately we are sad to announce that the official release of our album 'Grind the Ocean' has been delayed until April 2012 in the UK and US. Our team and label have been doing some amazing work over the past few months, and feel that delaying the official release, will give us some great opportunities- There will be new content released over the coming months, so keep your eyes open...Please note the release in other (territories) are unaffected and will be available online and in shops.
