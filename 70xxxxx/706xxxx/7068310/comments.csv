,Satiriz,2012-03-01T23:03Z,Can anyone check if it's working?
,JoeyJoeJoeJrShabadoo,2012-03-02T03:05Z,"For the record, this is a crack for the demo (they're calling it a beta, but it's not) for those that don't have access to it. It is NOT a crack to get past the invisible line that makes the ""End"" info box come up. You can still only venture through half the island, and you'll still have to reload a save without getting a new chance to save. Thought I believe it auto-saves right around there."
,Froio,2012-03-04T22:06Z,"Is not working for me. Avast will find the exe strange and open it in quarantine while ad-aware finds a trojan.
Opening the main exe in quarantine will just display the risen logo in the middle of the screen for 2-3 seconds then nothing happens.
So if someone can upload a better version."
