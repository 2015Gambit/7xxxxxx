Description:
Risen 2: Dark Waters is built around a pirate theme. So, get ready for a salty breeze, a parrot on his shoulder and crutch instead of feet. Risen from the island of Farang left in the distant past - it replaces a whole string of new islands, which we can easily go on the ship. Every piece of land is endowed with its unique climate, relief pattern so the flora and fauna, which should spur the players\' interest in the study of all the islands. However, even during the voyages will be something to look at - say, on the strange monsters that can attack the peaceful sailing ship.

Game mechanics in general, copies Risen. Before us stretches back much more \"realistic\" open world, surpassing the size of the original game - we are free to go and explore every corner of it where we please. The side quests, which gush local NPC, will be more difficult in terms of structure and will offer more opportunities for forks and making decisions that affect the job. The system of fast travel around the world will not worry.
