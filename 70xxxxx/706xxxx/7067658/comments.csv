,whmxtra,2012-03-01T20:14Z,"Not yet, but usually takes 2 days before it gets rebroadcast on the net so I can rip it."
,montmarte,2012-03-01T23:09Z,THANKYOU!!! You rock!
,mrstr,2012-03-02T09:01Z,"Thank you for uploading this. I'm so grateful because I know from your other torrents that I can count on the quality being great and the uploads being timely! 
(Not to add to your plate, but one other Bravo show high in demand by Bravo fans but rarely uploaded (or when it is uploaded, the quality is terrible) is the new season Bethenny Ever After.)"
,montmarte,2012-03-03T09:29Z,hi again have you got epsisode 4 yet? thanks!
,whmxtra,2012-03-04T00:44Z,"Will see what I can do about Bethenny Ever After, think that just started season 3 and don't see it up here, maybe later today I can do that, and real housewives of OC."
,whmxtra,2012-03-05T01:20Z,"Bethanny Ever After s03e01 uploaded: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7077696/Bethenny.Ever.After.S03E01.flv

No luck on real housewives of OC as I can't seem to find a source for ep4, but someone else did upload it here I believe."
