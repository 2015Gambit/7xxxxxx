,RogueTrooper7,2012-03-04T13:07Z,"This CAN be written to a pen/flash drive and it WILL run.....BETTER STILL....dowlnload 'Magicdisk' and run on a virtual drive it works just fine.
BUT REMEMBER THIS.....once you have installed Windows 8 you will have to do a re-install of your OS if you don't like it!! SO BACK UP YOUR FILES."

,FatBastard420,2012-04-04T21:11Z,"To those of you that seem to think you have to remove your old OS to install this, you don't.  Just do a Dual-Boot setup so you can keep Win7 and give 8 a try.  
All you have to do is click on the Windows icon in the bottom left corner of your screen.  Next RIGHT click on Computer and select Manage.  Then click on Disk Management along the left side of the pop-up screen.  Assuming you have only 2 partitions (System Reserved and C), RIGHT click on C and choose Shrink Volume then setup how large you want the new partition to be.  Once the new partition is created, RIGHT click the new, blank partition and choose New Simple Volume and follow the steps to name and format it in NTFS.  Once that's done you just boot your PC from the DVD drive and choose to install Win8 on your newly created partition.  After that, whenever you reboot your PC you'll have the option of booting into 7 or 8.  Very simple.  "

,brodie127,2012-04-09T15:25Z,"Works good. Clean install, BUT....... I did a dual-boot and played around with it for a bit. (was NOT connected to internet) then when I restarted my windows 7 I got hit with the ""Windows build 7601 - this copy of windows is not genuine.. This was easily fixed, thanks to TPB but just a heads up. I'm pretty sure in the next few weeks someone will create a patch for it. cheers for the upload btw :)"

,kiwibrandon,2012-04-20T09:31Z,"I got this from the microsoft site, less gigs used and a relativley fast d/l. I like the win8 system, especially the tiles. love pirate bay, but this preview i would get from ms as it ascertains what you need and does all the work for you.

lovely program, cant wait for the release."
,ombut,2012-04-23T16:22Z,This is FREWARE!!!
,Psythik,2012-05-02T04:08Z,"Had to download the torrent because the stupid downloader from the Microsoft site won't let me download it because there's not enough room on C:, despite having terabytes of space on my other drives!  So stupid.

Why does this have to be too big to fit on a DVD-5, though?  I have to use one of my precious Verbatim dual-layer discs just to install this!"
,kiwibrandon,2012-05-08T02:48Z,I went to the Microsoft website and d/l'ed their copy of the consumer preview. it is half the gig size and appears to be working really well. I like it.
