Doesn't matter. Downloading is not illegal, uploading is. xCrazy0328x makes legit torrents, never had any troubles, so don't spread any unneeded panic.

,Jabnit,2012-03-04T12:32Z,"Thanks again. I download off you every week. Do just want to say though, these aren't HD. They look great on my laptop screen. But because they're AVI files you lose quality if you're watching on a big tv. Still watchable though"
,bigwigg,2012-04-12T13:36Z,Thx a lot.
