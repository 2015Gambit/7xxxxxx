,EinDeutschMan,2012-03-18T04:06Z,"@muumtaz1

You should have gotten 5 ISO's, 1 JPG, 
The L1 companion folder should have 81 files.
The L2 thru L4 companion folders should have 84 files each.

Total count should be 423 files, 25 folders.

DL this ISO, and READ the Read Important.txt file

Run the patch in the patch folder.
The patch will MORE THAN LIKELY set off your AV software -->> IGNORE IT!

(you should not have to install this version of RS)

This will allow you to activate the language packs

Instead of bashing the torrent as not working, why don't you simply ask for help?

If you read the posts to ANY of the files IUL'd, I give anyone who asks what ever help advice they need.

And since I use these SAME ISO myself, I know that they work.

Now having said that, are you ""Mounting"" the ISO's with a program similar to PowerISO?
If not, you will NEVER get this to work, not in four hours, not in four YEARS!

Try that, then if you still can't get it to work, then let me know, and I'll gladly help...

It sound like you're running a version of Rosetta Stone PRIOR to v3.3.7, that will cause the error you're getting.

I am having some trouble. I downloaded the torrent and when I go to folder (where it has been downloaded) I see only ImgBurn files! There are no setup files. Do I have to burn them onto a CD/DVD? But when I open one of the levels, so that I can burn it, my whole computer restarts!!!!! Is this harmful to my computer? What is the problem? 
Thank you in advance"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-09T02:12Z,"@Doppelgang,

You do NOT have to burn them, but you DO need to ""mount"" them with a program like Power ISO (search for PowerISO4.7) I use this, but only as a matter of preference.

As far as why your computer wants to restart when you open the files to burn it to cd/dvd, I have no idea why, I have used these iso's personally, and they are clean.

Follow these instructions:
Both of the ISO's have readme files and/or PDF's

1. Block internet
2. Install program (V3), DO NOT run program.
(http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso)
3. Copy files (crack program and Licencingdll.DLL) from Crack folder to program folder where Rosetta Stone is installed and run it.
(if the crack sets off your AV software, IGNORE IT! I've used this same program for over a year without any problems)
4. Block Rosetta Stone program from internet access.
5. Set your firewall to ""allow trusted outbound"" ONLY! (or the equivalent.)
(if you block ALL internet access, you may get a 1117 error, speech component for voice recognition.)
6. Do NOT update the program!
7. Install language levels 1, 2 & 3.
8. Install v3.4.7 in the same folder as v3
(overwrite the contents).
(http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso)
9. Install language levels 4 & 5.

You SHOULD be set.

I think I followed your instructions for the patch properly, but apparently I didn't because when I went to apply the patch it said ""Can't find pattern""

,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-01T02:37Z,"@XENGINE,

When you talk about ""speech problem"", do you get an error, specifically #1117?
If this is the case, then it is due to your firewall setting(s);

You must set your firewall to ""allow trusted outbound"" or the equivalent.
Rosetta Stone must be able to ""talk"" to itself for the speech component to work (?)

Don't ask me why, but that's what Ive found.

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar""

Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file

Click ""Never register""
At the activation screen, click ""Continue"" 
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean.
