,mooface10,2012-03-05T11:28Z,"Hi there. thank you for all you uploads of this show. I just had a question on this one tho, I can seem to DL it there is no option to can you advise. Thank you Moo"
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-03-05T11:56Z,"Ok. The Pirate Bay has now gone to the ""Magnet Torrent"" system for 99% of the uploads. So, if you are using uTorrent or Vuze and you have clicked on the ""Get This Torrent"" link next to the magnet and it does not start downloading, you may need to update your bit torrent protocol, so that it opens it for you. Hope this helps :)"

,medicineboy,2012-04-08T01:58Z,Hi gary.. thanx so much for providing the episodes for all of us.. just wondering if it was possible could you do a file with all seasons? someone broke into my hotel and stole my hard drive.. absolutely devastated.. if you could help out it would be amazing.. thanx again!! :))
,medicineboy,2012-04-08T02:01Z,Hi gary.. any chance you could do a file with all seasons... please please please!!!
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-04-09T09:39Z,"I can do an upload of all TOWIE Seasons, but (no one likes a ""but""!), For me to seed it, that will be slowed down due to all the current stuff I am uploading like MIC which I get over 200 peers at a time on. And that will give you 3kb/s. There should still be seeds on all the ones I have uploaded in the past under my original username ""GaryBradbury"". It may be a pain to pool all them all together, but it will be a lot faster for you! My max upload speed is 80kb/s. Too slow!!!"
