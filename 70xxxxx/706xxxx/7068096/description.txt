Survivor.S24E03.PROPER.HDTV.x264-BAJSKORV

The TRANSiENCE release suffers from jerky
playback throughout. We are not sure if
this is from either bad deinterlace, or
an improper VFR encoding/muxing. This
show is not hybrid and therefore VFR
should not be used.

We also went with crf 22 as the rules
still have no clear definition as to
what qualifies as plain reality versus
competitive reality.
