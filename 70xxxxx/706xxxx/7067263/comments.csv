,chrisjahn123,2012-07-06T01:50Z,"Great torrent, amazing quality, better than most copies I've seen on YouTube and other anime sights. Will never stop seeding this. Thx"
,dwraith0877,2012-07-16T09:06Z,"incl'd txt file says it is complete, but torrent is 5 eps short... (Cardfight!! Vanguard goes to 65 eps before switching to season 2 (Cardfight!! Vanguard Asia Circuit Hen)
Otherwise awesome and thanks"
,chrisjahn123,2012-07-19T03:22Z,"@dwraith0877 The torrent isn't incomplete. Yes, Season 1 is 65 episodes long, but the torrent doesn't claim to be all of season 1. The torrent claims to be episodes 1-60, and that is exactly what is inside. I wish it was all 65, but sadly, it isn't. However, this torrent still provides what it claims and in excellent viewing quality. 10/10."
,Presk,2012-08-04T11:40Z,"There were about 59 episodes out there when i started to watch this anime. But when i searched over the net, there wasnt any bundle to download, and believe me, i searched. So,  the only place i found was the horriblesubs, and there were only 1 or 2 seeders (20 first episodes, more or less) so i bared the pain to download em, took soem time, in meanwhile, ep 60 were out so i downloaded that too. And i figured that there wasnt any decent collection still out there i decided to make other's search a bit simpler and made this bundle for you so u wont have to go thru all the trouble to download each episode with low download rate. By the time i made this, there wasnt the last 5 episodes out yet. So enjoy this one, and am sure you can find the rest of the 5 episodes without trouble now that the whole season is out. And i thought i make a 720p to a bunlde rather than 480p. So decent speed with decent quality brought to you guys, enjoy!"
,zeikai,2012-08-24T18:45Z,"Thanks a ton for doing this, was just trying to download the individual episodes and they're pretty much dead, so thanks. I'm only getting about 120 kps max on this atm though, but better then nothing. If you could seed more that'd be great, thanks!"
,SlashBlack,2012-09-01T17:28Z,SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
,Presk,2012-09-08T13:36Z,"Alrighty, gonna seed this again for few days to give it a boost"
,klkser3,2012-09-14T05:26Z,Can someone please help seed this? I just found out about Vanguard and I'll love to watch the rest of the ep. in 720p
