All Cher albums in LOSSLESS wave format are included, except Black Rose because I do not own the CD. All Warner releases 1975-1977 were ripped from my own mint/sealed vinyl. Nothing has been altered or compressed. When you burn these wavs to cd, the quality of the original Store Bought quality should be exact.
