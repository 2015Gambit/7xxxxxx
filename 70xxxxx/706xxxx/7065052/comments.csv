,grammyteem,2012-03-08T10:49Z,"Hebrew subs are hardcoded into video.  You can search for English subs but using VLC will have to adjust the subs to the top of the screen.  
On my VLC-Tools/Preferences/Subtitles and OSD/Force Subtitle Position-Increase to 150px and Save. Hebrew subs will be on the bottom and English subs on top."
