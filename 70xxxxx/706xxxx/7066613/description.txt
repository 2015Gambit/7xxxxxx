 Once again youâ€™ll have a chance to experience the magnificent dark gothic atmosphere of the good(or evil?) old Painkiller, the only true oldschool FPS tough as nails, without a trace of remorse, without a glimpse of motion blur or other technological makeup. Just Painkiller and nothing else matters!
This time youâ€™re fighting for the freedom of your soul, and youâ€™re going to need all your strength and courage in order to break free from a prison located in the darkest corner of the Purgatory.
Action takes place in some completely unknown areas of the underworld. These areas donâ€™t look ordinary at all. Each level is a brand new world, a universe with its own unique atmosphere, history and mysteries.
Youâ€™ll have to fight with the undead in an old gloomy abbey, on a ruined as if by an earthquakespeedway with roads and turns twisting like circles of Hell. Youâ€™ll be hunting demons amongst numerous crypts and tombs of an old London cemetery. Youâ€™ll be cleansing the old warehouse, decaying and shrouded in darkness and terror. Youâ€™ll have to stop occult rituals in an old temple complex lost somewhere in the jungle.
Med-Art about the game:
We make the new Painkiller with all our heart and soul because we love what weâ€™re doing. Once you play Painkiller you get hooked up on it. We were so deeply amazed by its astonishing atmosphere that we still highly admire it. Sometimes you think that itâ€™s not you who chooses Painkiller but itâ€™s Painkiller that chooses you.


Enjoy
