Is there a persistent activation"
,supanut2000,2012-03-01T15:59Z,"This can be downloaded from Microsoft, so I don't see the point of downloading any of these. I've got it to installed on my VMware 8 and it's great, and it's way better than the build 8102 developer preview. I think this is pretty much what we'll see when Windows 8 goes on sale later this year."
,kunev,2012-03-24T21:24Z,"There is a pretty good reason for this to be here actually.
Downloading it from Microsoft is useless for me, because they let you download an exe file that downloads the iso afterwards. And I don't have Windows, but I'm curious to try stuff.

Thanks for the upload!"
