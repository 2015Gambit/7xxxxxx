This torrent contains the soundtracks from Doctor Who, Seasons 4-6.
The files contained in this torrent total up to 1.81GB. (Yes that's a lot, but it's worth it right?) I did quite a lot of work to these files, and hopefully you will be satisfied with the file system. Both Season 5, and Season 6 contain the original .rar, and .7z files. 
All music files are .mp3s. All files are good, if not very good quality.
All the seasons contain album art at least 200x200. (Mostly more.) 

Have fun people, I hope this works for you! 

BTW, I didn't have the time to create .txt files with this torrent, so there really isn't all that much info with them, but I figured that since they were simply .mp3 files, and I had done most of the reformatting, that you didn't need it. 

P.S. I have a rather low band width, so until this gets off the ground, initial downloads will be pretty slow. Thank you all SO much for doing your best to seed!
