,martinalex,2012-02-28T01:58Z,Exactly... Why did you post it? Is it your first upload  on pirate bay mate? Do not upload stuff that is cleanly available for download from their makers' web services.

It doesn't look like it's his first (his profile shows 24) so I don't think that's it... either he has a good reason or it's fake. "
,FatFreddy462,2012-02-28T11:41Z,"It is the official post by apple but there don't are any torrent link on thepiratebay so I have post it.
Some people doesn't know message beta exist so it is a way to enhance this fantastic mac app."

,martinalex,2012-02-28T23:37Z,"That is right 7117!. All Mac users who love their Macs, are addicted to them and to the software are undoubtedly following all the news and blogs, so I think there is no need to post this things here. But anyway, thanks for your good will and honesty (I hope you are) Cheers buddy."

,Thin101,2012-07-13T10:49Z,"I made account on TPB just to thank thelegalbay. When he uploaded the torrent, other commentators bashed him, saying Message Beta is already available for free from Apple's website. But now that Apple has removed the app from their site. The download link takes to their Mountain Lion page. I needed this app on my new MacBook. This torrent came in handy. Thanks thelegalbay."
