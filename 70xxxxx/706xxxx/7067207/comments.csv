i use cdisplay but i cant seem to read the new upploads. does somebody know why?"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-03-01T18:30Z,"This may sound dumb but are you sure youare downloading them to 100% - I did that a few times, removed the torrent before it was complete and file was useless.

I would recommend you use ComicRack, its free and the best thing out there, can even put it on your  tablet or phone. Free and amazing"

,new_wave_prom_81,2012-03-04T01:54Z,"I see several version of Comic Rack.
Which do you prefer? A link?

Does this help with the download?"
,comicrazy,2012-03-04T03:56Z,"Yes i se that to! I have actually downloaded ComicRack, But it dosent make the files readeble. I was starting to think that there was something wrong with my computer. 

If there is a solution to the ""file"" problem please shear! Or if it's the download program, i'm using BitComet.

Many thanks to everyone!!!!!!"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-03-05T06:32Z,"I would recommend VUZE, whatever the most recent version of ComicRack is and, starting to sound like a computer issue."
