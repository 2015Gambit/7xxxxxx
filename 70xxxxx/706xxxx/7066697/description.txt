::Plot::
Lucy (Browning) is introduced as a university student who holds a number of odd jobs; she volunteers as a test subject at the university lab and works as a cleaner/server at a small diner and a copy girl at an unnamed office. She also is seen at a high-class bar offering herself as a sex partner (it is never shown for certain whether she is paid or not). She has a room where her landlord obviously doesn't like her, and she spends her time visiting an aloof man known only as Birdman (Leslie). He is attracted to her, but she doesn't return the affection, though she does appear happier with him than at any other time.
