,beauflex1,2012-03-24T19:36Z,"Need some help guys.  I am not getting any audio with any of these files.  Audio on PC is working completely fine and has been verified/other movies/songs work fine.  None of the video files here in this torrent are playing audio though (video works fine).  Have tried windows media player, quick time, and itunes.  Is there a specific program these need to be opened with?  Thanks"
,beauflex1,2012-03-24T19:39Z,"actually i take that back.  Some of the later days audio are working.  It seems that the lack of audio is showing up on random days.  For example, day 1, part 1 2 and 3 all lack audio for me.  Can these lack of audio days be re-upped?  Thanks so much (am currently studying for the boards...april 24th is the big day for me)."
,ggteaca,2012-04-05T08:06Z,"I also have no audio for the days lectures. the remaining days seem to be working fine. Whats up with day 1?
