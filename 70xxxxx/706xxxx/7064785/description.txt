   something or someone who will complete     
   them. Jai feels that magic and serendipity

   is enough for her. But is it? Govind has   
   a colourful past and is on his way to      
   another major, seemingly all wrong

   long time waiting for Mr. Perfect. When    
   he does appear, will she take her chance
