A collection of knit patterns for bags, purses, clutches, iPod and mobile  cases, market totes etc.... 

There's four books, many individual patterns and a Word document compilation. 
Everything was carefully renamed for consistency, so that the file name reflects the real title, and you can see whether you have it or not. 
They are not rar-ed, so you can pick and choose which files you need. If you happen to have some of these, and you're not happy with the scan quality, do check the file sizes, if mine are bigger, chances are that they  have gone through Photoshop and are better.

To choose the files you want to download when downloading a .torrent file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're using Firefox it will ask you "save or open". Choose Open with  uTorrent or your other client. And you'll get a window with all the files  checked. Uncheck the ones you don't want, click OK and you're done. 


To choose the files you want to download when downloading a magnet link
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In uTorrent) go to the lower half of the window, click the "Files" tab, wait a  bit until the list of files appears; select those you don't want, right click and  check "Don't download". Other clients also have this capability. 
However, if you download the whole thing and seed it, you will do a service  to other downloaders. 

IMPORTANT NOTE:
--------------- 
Site statistics are not always accurate - actually, they  seldom are! For instance, you may see 0 seeders and just a few leechers,  but if you download and open in your torrent client, you may see that in fact  there are many. So don't trust the numbers you see and despair, check for  yourself before giving up.
