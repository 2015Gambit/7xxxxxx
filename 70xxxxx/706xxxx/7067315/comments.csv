I tried to make the page backgrounds white instead of ""scanner blueish grey"" or ""scanner pinkish grey"" and lighten up the pictures as well, giving some contrast etc... It took me quite a lot, because you cannot do batch work of this kind. You can see a couple of pages I left as they were, for comparison."
