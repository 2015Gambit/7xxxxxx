Details:

Born to Die is the second studio album and major label debut by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. The album was released on January 27, 2012 on iTunes and on January 31, 2012 by Interscope Records, Polydor Records, and Stranger Records. After signing a record contract with Stranger in June 2011, the singer released her debut single, "Video Games", which is considered as the one that propelled the singer's online popularity. Del Rey then started to give interviews to several newspapers and online magazines, as well as making live appearances to promote her work. The album's second single, "Born to Die", was released on December 30, 2011.

Del Rey sings in a soprano vocal style in the album, and evokes elements of music artists as Elvis Presley, Britney Spears, and Antony and the Johnsons. Musically, Born to Die is a pop album but derives characteristics from such musical genres as alternative hip hop, sadcore, and alternative pop.

Born to Die received generally mixed reviews from contemporary critics, with some giving praise to the album's distinctive sound, whilst others criticized the songs' repetitiveness and the melodramatic production, which they thought was too overwhelming over the course of 12-15 tracks. Despite attracting polarization from music commentators, the album was a commercial success. It topped the charts in seven countries including Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Born to Die debuted in the top five of charts in several countries, including the United States, where it entered at number two on the Billboard 200.
