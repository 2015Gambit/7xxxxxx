In this humorous paean to the joys of food, the main story is about trucker Goro who rides into town like a modern Shane to help Tampopo set up the perfect fast-food noodle restaurant. Woven into this main story are a number of smaller stories about the importance of food, ranging from a gangster who mixes hot sex with food to an old lady terrorizing a shopkeeper by compulsive squeezing of his wares.  Tampopo, a widowed noodle chef, is helped to become a first class chef by truck driver Goro and friends. Food is the theme throughout this movie and it includes novel uses of food as erotic toy.

"Tampopo" is a movie that most anyone will find quite funny, but it will be even more funny to those familiar with the Japanese people. It is an excellent example of the ability of the Japanese to laugh at themselves, at those things that are peculiarly Japanese, and at their love affair with western culture.
