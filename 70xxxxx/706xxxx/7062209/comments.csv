are you taking request??
if so Pamela Clare's I-TEAM series- pretty please!"
,lynfree,2012-02-28T12:47Z,"Thanks- never read any of these. I don't suppose you can get the new jd robb, celebrity in death? Or the Patterson, Private games? I'd be grateful if you could. Oh and thanks for the Sandra Brown books. They're great."
,komadori7,2012-02-28T14:23Z,"Hi KK,

Do you have 'Bad Science' by Ben Goldacre (2008 I think) or '50 Mathematical Ideas you need to know' by Tony Crilly: they're both popular science books.

Regards
Komadori"
