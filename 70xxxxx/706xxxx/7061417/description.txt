Description
â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Imagine a GPS app designed for all outdoor activities â€“ the perfect companion for skiing, biking, hiking and riding. With geocaching built in and the option to plan, record and share your rides or routes.

And imagine that this app doesn't depict mountains and valleys as flat spots on a map, but in THREE DIMENSIONS â€“ including the path you are traveling on. A precise (!) altimeter displays your current elevation at any time. That is Maps 3D.

How is this possible? We're the first company to combine NASA scans of the Earth's topography with THE outdoor map OSM.

You'll receive maps of the entire world at no extra cost. With every street, path, rise, track and trail on OSM. Follow or record routes, search functionality, altimeter and numerous features included. You can load free routes from Everytrail and other sources.

And the best part: Maps 3D is fun! Have a look at the images below and give it a try!

âœ” iTunes track exchange
If your device is connected to iTunes drag and drop .gpx files easily.

âœ” Change camera angle
By stroking with two fingers in parallel up and down the camera angle changes from 2D to 3D seamlessly.

âœ” The map view can be zoomed into by a double-click, zoom out by clicking once with two fingers.

âœ” Gradient and gradient speed (m/min or ft/min) is precisely calculated based on the terrain data

âœ” Direction to destination is displayed in degree and orientation
To find your destination more easily a black and white line connects your position and the flag icon.


IMPROVEMENTS:

âœ” Strongly improved terrain display

âœ” New, better readable data display

âœ” Scalebar in 2D map

âœ” Dynamic, soft zooming behavior

âœ” Pressing 'pause' interrupts the speed calculations, not only the recording

âœ” Real duration and speed saved as extensions in .gpx files

âœ” Tracklist ordered by date
