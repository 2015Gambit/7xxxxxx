The ATA Hi-Cap Support Driver software was created to allow the use of extended capacity ATA drives (drives greater than 128 Gigabytes in size) on older (Pre-Mirrored Door) G4 and G3 Macintoshes -- including Cubes, PowerMacs, PowerBooks, iBooks eMacs and iMacs running MacOS X versions 10.2 and later.
