,bseymour,2012-03-01T03:26Z,"@pdxwill That game wasn't available yesterday when I created the torrent, I haven't watched it yet so I assumed it was a 2 game match.  It's available on the vods page now so I'll upload it separately.  Thanks for the notice!"
,pdxwill,2012-03-01T04:47Z,"No problem man, glad to help, just so happy someone decided to upload these... really itching for the finals! ;P"
