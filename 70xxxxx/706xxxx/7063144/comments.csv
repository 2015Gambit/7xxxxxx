,Skivs,2012-03-07T05:05Z,"Each torrent has a unique fingerprint called a ""hash"" or ""info hash"". 

This info hash is used to ensure that the completed download of the content associated with a torrent will be uncorrupted. 

The content in a torrent is broken down into pieces, or ""bits"", for transfer. 
Each piece has its own hash and its hash is compared to the info hash of the torrent. 
If the hashes match, then the piece is accepted as part of the download. 
If the hashes do not match, then the piece is rejected. 

The info hash ensures that the completed download will be uncorrupted and also ensures that malware can not be injected into an otherwise clean torrent."
,kreem,2012-03-10T19:08Z,Got a few corrupt tracks on it - an example is the we are alive track - corrupts at 4:12. I know it does it on at least another track too.

Corrupted files . "
,f1471in3,2012-07-18T12:21Z,"Thanks for this awesome album.

There's an issue with the 11th track ""We Are Alive"" (a glitch towards the end of the song). A minor issue but an issue after all :)

Best."
,f1471in3,2012-07-18T12:27Z,Found the same issue in #12 track and #13
