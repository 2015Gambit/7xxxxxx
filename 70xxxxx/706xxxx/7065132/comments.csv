,lenaballerina,2012-02-29T05:29Z,Just wondering why the file size is about 250mb instead of about 350mb? Thanks in any case =)
,pxpierre,2012-02-29T06:02Z,Thanks to VTV & seeders!
,blnc9949,2012-02-29T06:46Z,"Omg, it's real, and the download was so damn fast, nice..  But only 1 bad thing, it's in a mp4 format :("
,visionofpain,2012-02-29T07:02Z,nothing shows up when i go to d/l why?
,Psynaut00,2012-02-29T08:32Z,"These new 250 MB mp4 torrents going up have horrible sound.  It sounds like a McDonalds drive thru, this weeks episode of Justified is unintelligible, and this one is just painful to listen to."
,spgonzales,2012-02-29T08:45Z,thank you

nothing shows up when i go to d/l why?

I agree... what's up?"
,DiabloTheCritic,2012-02-29T13:06Z,FFS you muppets get up to date gear instead of complaining about the format. V 10 A 10 on new stuff. Buy new gear you tight bastards.
,handel1,2012-02-29T13:28Z,Use KMPlayer to play it. Besides being completely free (not shareware and no strings attached) it contains all the codex so no need to install anything else.
,F6paX,2012-02-29T15:17Z,"Thx first
but nothing shows when i go to down !!?? :p"
,synnr2012,2012-02-29T17:05Z,where is the download link?! this sux lol
,TGMurdoc,2012-02-29T20:22Z,"Everyone complaining of files not shown when you download, just set your downloads (magnet links) to open with your torrent program like uTorrent. uTorrent handles magnet files just fine. You might not see specific files at first, but once the download starts you'll see the files. Hope this helps."
,synnr2012,2012-02-29T20:38Z,"i click on teh get this torrent link and absolutely nothing happens, idk wat to do lol"
,wenex,2012-03-01T15:19Z,"@lenaballerina it's an mp4 file. the format has comparable video and audio to most avi's, maybe a bit better, and a much tighter compression, hence the smaller video size."
,ouemaru,2012-03-06T13:20Z,"People with magnet links problem: Use uTorrent, it supports magnet links. If you already have one then maybe it needs updating."
,ouemaru,2012-03-06T13:28Z,"Once you get the torrent via magnet link it will automatically load and d/l. If you only want to download a specific file, all you have to do is wait for it to d/l until the d/l bar shows 0.1%, click the torrent and go to files where you simply right-click the files you DO NOT WANT to d/l and choose ""don't download"" or something to that effect, leaving only the file you want."
