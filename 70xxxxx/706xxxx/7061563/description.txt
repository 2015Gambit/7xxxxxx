Surfing charters are meant to be a trip to Paradise. With six
male surfers stuck on a boat, there's bound to be some
friction. When two of the surf crew are replaced at the last
minute with girls - the heat is turned way up. The one single
girl on board - SAM - enjoys the attention. She has Bull and
Rob wrapped around her finger. The frustrated, psychotic, Bull
soon decides, "she'll get what she's asking for" and molests
her. Outraged, the others abandon him on an island, but the
ever-determined Bull returns, and takes control of the boat
He attacks the crew and holds them hostage. He harasses Sam
and tortures the others. It's a nightmare battle of wits, on
board the yacht, as the five imprisoned friends must survive
the fury of the psycho at the helm
