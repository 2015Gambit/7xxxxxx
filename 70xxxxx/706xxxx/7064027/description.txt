Cheyenne, a wealthy former rock star (Penn), now bored and jaded in his retirement embarks on a quest 
to find his father's persecutor, an ex-Nazi war criminal now hiding out in the U.S. Learning his father 
is close to death, he travels to New York in the hope of being reconciled with him during his final hours, 
only to arrive too late. Having been estranged for over 30 years, it is only now in death that he learns 
the true extent of his father's humiliation in Auschwitz at the hands of former SS Officer Aloise Muller - 
an event he is determined to avenge. So begins a life-altering journey across the heartland of America to 
track down and confront his father's nemesis. As his quest unfolds, Cheyenne is reawakened by the people he 
encounters and his journey is transformed into one of reconciliation and self discovery. As his date with 
destiny arrives and he tracks down Muller, Cheyenne must finally decide if it is redemption he seeks ...
