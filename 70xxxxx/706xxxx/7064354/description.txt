Plot..........: Child murderer. Dream demon. The bastard son of a hundred 
                maniacs. Any way you slice it, there can only be one man, 
                one monster, who epitomizes those words:

                Freddy Krueger.

                For decades, Freddy has slashed his way through the dreams 
                of countless youngsters, scaring up over half a billion 
                dollars at the box office across eight terrifying, 
                spectacular films. What's more, it has become evident that
                Freddy may never rest in peace.

                In this thrilling retrospective, fans will enter the world 
                of Freddy Krueger and A Nightmare On Elm Street like never
                before: exploring what spurred mastermind Wes Craven to
                craft the first groundbreaking film; delving deep behind
                the scenes of the original and all of its sequels; learning
                how the cast and crew brought their worst nightmares to 
                life; and finally, understanding the impact the series and 
                its mythos have had on modern pop culture and the horror genre.

                Narrated by and starring Heather Langenkamp, featuring 
                interviews with the cast and crew spanning every film, and 
                loaded with clips, photographs, storyboards, conceptual
                art, publicity materials, archival documents and 
                behind-the-scenes footage, Never Sleep Again: The Elm 
                Street Legacy is the definitive account of what many have
                called the best, most frightening and imaginative horror
                franchise in motion picture history.
