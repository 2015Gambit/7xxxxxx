Two questions:
1. Did you try to install Rosetta Stone once before and it failed?
2. Do you have the internet BLOCKED - if not, do so.

If you had an install fail, you'll have to do a little ""housecleaning"". 
Go to the ""ProgramDataRosetta Stone"" folder and if there is a tracking.db3 file in that folder, delete it.

Then go to the Rosetta Stone PROGRAM folder, (NOT the folder where the languages are installed) and see if there is the tracking.db3 file in that folder too, if so delete it as well.

The tracking.db3 file tracks your progress through Rosetta Stone, and can sometime get corrupted which can cause the error you have.

If this does NOT solve the problem, then you may have to re-install Rosetta Stone.
Let me know...

If you are using the ISO's you must ""mount"" them first, I use PowerISO4.7, just because I'm accustomed to it.

Have you DL'd and installed PowerISO?
if so, open it, go to ""options"", ""configuration..."",""Virtual drive"", set ""number of virtual drives"" to 1, ""OK""
(I set the number of drives to 3, so I can mount all 3 language levels at the same time)
Reboot,
PowerISO icon should be in the taskbar.
right click the icon,
click on ""Mount image to Drive[whatever it says]""
navigate to where ever you have the language ISO's,
select language level
right click on PowerISO icon again,
you should see something like
""Mount Image to Drive[E:] D:Downloads Rosetta stone Japanese - Level 1.iso""

(remember, your drive letters & paths are probably different from what I have here, these are just for demonstration.)

Which ones won't mount?
What version of Rosetta Stone are you using?
What version of PowerISO are you using?

The first thing you need to do is reboot. 
Remount them
After you remount the language packs, browse them, and make sure that they are intact.

Level 1 - 259 files, 4 folders, 407mb
Level 2 - 259 files, 4 folders, 394mb
Level 3 - 259 files, 4 folders, 410mb
Level 4 - 259 files, 4 folders, 402mb

I going to tell you exactly what I did. After reading your post I Uninstalled v3 reinstalled it and added Lang. Ran the patch. I put I. The xxxxx activation code it asked for a phone activation I put in 11111 response number and it still didn't work. Could it be that I already had v4 rossetta stone? Still lost and confused?

Yes, I think that v4 might be the problem. I have not tested any of my Rosetta Stone UL's with v4.

I know it sounds like a pain the A$$, but the only recommendation I can give you is to uninstall all versions of RS, and start from scratch.

Even then, I can't promise that the patch will work with v4.

If you want to wait a day or so, let me know what version you have and where you got it (i.e. TPB or bought @ a store), and I'll test it for you. That's the best I can do right now.

I have a few questions:
1. Are you willing to be a ""guinea pig""?
2. Can you wait a day or so?
3. What version of Windows are you running, and is it 32 or 64 bit?
4. What is your native language (I presume English)?

Now, here's why I ask:

1. I am working on a ""pre-installed"" version of Rosetta Stone.
    (No setup required, just copy the files to the proper folders and you're done).
2. I'm not done yet, still ""debugging"".
3. I need to know so that I include the correct files, folders etc.
4. To streamline the process, I will delete all unnecessary files.
    (Who needs the files for languages you don't speak)

This is how it will work:

1. DL the Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 ISO 
    (The updated one I will UL, and identify as ""Preinstalled"")
2. DL WHATEVER language you want to learn.
    (Again, the updated one I will UL, and identify as ""Preinstalled"")
3. Mount both the ISO's, and copy them to the proper folders.
   (You will have Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 installed, and you will NOT have to ""install"" ANY languages.)
You can DL as many languages as you want, and they will ALL be ACTIVATED! 
But they MUST be the ones I UL.

If this works, I plan to create pre-installed versions of all the language packs I have.

,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-15T23:46Z,"@mizike89,

Disregard any ISO's you already have.
The ""Preinstalled version"" will be the one you want to use.
i.e. ""Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled""

The language pack(s) will also be named ""Preinstalled""
i.e. ""Spanish (Latin America) levels 1-5 Preinstalled""

You will have detailed instructions, but the bottom line is that you will have
1 ISO for the program, and 1 ISO for EACH language, all levels in 1 ISO ( I hope!)

The ""Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled"" ISO will have two folders in it.
The 1st folder will be named ""Rosetta Stone"", and gets copied to the C:/ProgramData folder
The 2nd folder will be named ""Rosetta Stone v3"", and gets copied to the C:/Program Files (x86) folder

The ""Spanish (Latin America) Levels 1-5"" ISO will have one folder in it
The folder will be named ""Contents"" and will be copied into C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone v3 folder you just created.

That's IT! 
The first time you run the program, you will create your user profile, and set up the program as you want. (Speech recognition, user name, etc.)
The Language pack(s) will show up as activated, with all X's

Now, suppose you want to learn German as well...
You simply DL the ""German Levels 1-5 Preinstalled"" ISO
It will have 1 folder named ""Contents""
You simply copy it to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone v3 folder just like you did the Spanish, and now you have German installed AND activated as well!

Now, lets just hope I can get it to work the way I want it to...

,jwhufc,2012-04-27T16:06Z,"everything works real well. no complaints.


however, I can't get disc's 4 and 5 to work. I also couldnt get them to work on the German and French ISO's that you uploaded... so I'm assuming it's just me.

any way to get them to work?"

-I'm new to this whole entire torrent thing and want to download this program to my mac desktop, is that possible and if so how do I do that?
-thanks"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-30T03:27Z,"@thtguy,

I'm not gonna lie to you, I have NO idea if this will work on a Mac, and if so how to DL it.

Sorry...

Maybe someelse (more knowledgeable) can answer your question.

Is there any way you could get Czech and/or Icelandic and UL them?"
,SeattleSeed,2012-05-19T04:58Z,"Make sure to download the actual Rosetta Stone Program first, as these are just the language packets. 

I downloaded the program from here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia) The instructions are in the comments.

It's best to have Daemon Tools to mount the iso files (which tricks your computer into thinking it has the CD in it) then download each mounted iso into R.S. so you can later access it all from the program itself.

Good luck and happy Swashbuckling!

,fscii,2012-05-25T08:54Z,"Is it possible to install these language packs when using the preinstalled 3.4.7 software?  I ask because there's no Spanish (Latin America) version of this 5 pack in the pre-installed flavor.  I manually installed the first 3 but kept getting an error over voice recognition files missing.

The 3.4.7 preinstalled also gives me a 'minor error' every time I start the program - in case that has anything to do with it."
,doc_penguin,2012-06-05T23:50Z,"Dear @EinDeutschman I did everything that I had to do to get the program and the languages running but something is going on with the speech component. Although I undergo a check of my mic before starting each lesson and it shows that I am speaking, whenever an exercise requires me to repeat a word it never works! Also every single time I start an exercise the program shows me an error message saying "" Rosetta Stone Ltd. executable has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvencience"" most times followed by another message saying ""1211 There was an error in the application. ListInputDevicesSpeechMessage"" and asks me to exit the application. I would very much appreciate it if you could help me."

I haven't finished downloading this, but what did you do to try and get the iso's to run?

Normally, you would use a program like Daemon Tools Lite or VirtualCloneDrive to mount them as virtual disks, not actually burn them to DVDs. Then once they're mounted as virtual disks, you then run the autorun.exe on them.

Special instructions for installing cracks or doing what EinDeutschMan said then come after install."
[T],fuckthesystem1,2012-07-28T12:16Z,"First off, I just wanna give a huge thank you to EinDeutschMan. You've clearly put a lot of time into not only helping others obtain Rosetta Stone, but also talking them through their technical troubles with installing and it is very much appreciated. I successfully installed both the French and Spanish Levels 1-5 on Mac OSX Lion, using this (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7337333/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.5_%5BK_ed%5D_for_Mac) as a base, and everything's working perfectly.

Again, thank you Ein. You're awesome. "
,53R4,2012-08-11T07:04Z,Thanks~
,clifperrin,2012-09-01T18:02Z,"Works perfectly.  Downloaded iso files, burned individual discs using UltraISO (IMO the best ISO burning program), ran RS v3 and installed each level, and runs like a charm.  Thanks."
,cuntrol,2012-09-23T11:20Z,Is there a way to extract and save the photos from this? I can't figure out where they're stored. :/
,cyaoutthere,2012-09-27T23:57Z,"thank you! Works perfectly except for it disables speech recognition and does not allow me to speak. I am sure i probably forgot to do something. using... win 7 home premium, rs 3.4.7 preinstalled, spanish la 12345 installed with power iso (by the way thanks for that too!) everything else except speech recognition works. i want to make sure of my pronunciation. any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks again for all your hard work."
