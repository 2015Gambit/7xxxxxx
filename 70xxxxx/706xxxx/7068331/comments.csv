,Dolmord,2012-04-05T01:40Z,"Lol @ comment above me. Please keep in mind that not all people are native English. Plus they're embedded into the matroska file, so you can keep em off >.< Complaining about nothing.
A better comment would have been:
""Thanks, I enjoyed the movie and I'll make sure to buy my copy"""
