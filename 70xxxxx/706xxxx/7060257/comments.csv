,pebjerq71,2012-02-27T20:45Z,"How is one supposed to get this torrent? It lists tons of trackers, and every one of them says ""Error: Offline - Network not enabled for url ..."".
I've never seen anything like that. Any other randomly chosen torrent from TPB downloads fine, except the ones created by footballmal. Is there some trick here? How do you all download it?"
,pebjerq71,2012-02-27T20:55Z,"Who the fuck removed my comment?
I was asking how do you guys get this torrent? It is unlike any other here on TPB. I'll write more if this comment doesn't get removed too. :("
,pebjerq71,2012-02-27T20:56Z,Argh! Now it's visible. Sorry about the outburst. Can someone please answer my question?
,lucabara,2012-02-28T04:01Z,"pebjerq71 sometimes comments are posted after a while (sometimes 10-30 mins) sometimes more...

you saying you downloaded torrents before, therefore you must have a torrent download software program

dont know what your issue is, i download everything from piratebay just fine (im using BiTTorrent)"
,pebjerq71,2012-02-28T06:30Z,"lucabara, thanx for the answer!  I was finally able to download footballmal's torrents - I'll explain how.  Maybe the problem is I'm using Azureus/Vuze, unlike most who use a version of uTorrent.
I was only able to do it by copying the magnet link, opening a new torrent, and pasting the magnet link. Then, I manually deleted all trackers except tracker.openbittorrent.com; only then did it work. Apparently, Azureus/Vuze is ""poisoned"" if the first/main tracker is invalid - which it normally is, being the piratebay one.
I would advise footballmal, if he wants his torrents to be more usable, to *not* use a non-working tracker as the first/main tracker of the torrent. Azureus gets poisoned in cases like that and can't work. At least that's how I diagnosed it. :)"
,lucabara,2012-02-28T12:04Z,"oh ok dude.. glad you got it to work, im happy with my BitTorrent, all i do now is click get this torrent and it opens automatically in bitTorrent . click OK and wait :)"
