Planet Roll Call (ç‚¹å‘¼ã™ã‚‹æƒ‘æ˜Ÿ) is a 2009 album composed by Susumu Hirasawa. This is his 11th solo album and is his first solo album in three years. The album shares many features with his previous albums, using both electronic sounds as well as heavy epic drums. A few of the songs are low tempo just like his last album White Tiger Field. Songs that stand out from this are \"Mirrors Gate\", \"Great Deceiver of Saint Horseshoe Planet\" and \"Initial value of Midair\" which are high beat intense songs with background chorus for certain parts. There are also \"Planet Roll Call\" and \"Astro-Ho! Homing\" which could be classified as circus, a theme Hirasawa has experimented with in earlier albums.
