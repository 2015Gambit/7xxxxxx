,brooksyboy1,2012-02-29T19:57Z,If you're using VLC just sync it up yourself! I found that -200ms did it perfect.

,Zhelkus,2012-03-01T23:19Z,"So the difference between this torrent and this one:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7063452/Goon_2011_720p_HDRiP_AC3-5.1_x264-SiC

Is that the former is SIC-untampered MKV while this one is re-re-re-encoded MP4. Hence the 1GB size difference. Amirite?"
