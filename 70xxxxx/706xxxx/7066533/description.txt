This rip was created not by me, but (ostensibly) by the folks at holyfuckingshit40000-dot-blogspot-dot-com, who distributed it through the now-defunct M3gaUplo@d. Files were created with EAC and are encoded with FLAC 1.2.1. With the death of MU, this and other interesting rips created by these people will likely disappear from the interwebs without some help from the P2P community. Help keep these rare albums available by downloading, seeding, and sharing them with anyone interested.
