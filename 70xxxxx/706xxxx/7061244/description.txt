"Elder Stew" is a dark short story about a Victorian gentleman called Lord Henry, who's main objective is to be "the talk of the town" after his lavish dinner party. After a couple of hiccups along the way it's up to Grayson, Lord Henry's loyal butler, to make sure his employer is still "the talk of the town".
