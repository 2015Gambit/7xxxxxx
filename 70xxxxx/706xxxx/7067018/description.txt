BigK Magazine Issues 01-12 (Summer 1992 - May 1987)

** Note: This is a rework of a collection previously available. 
** Content should be much the same, but the image quality is much better

Big K was a short-lived attempted by the giant International
Publishing Corporation (IPC) to get into the booming UK computing scene.
It only lasted 12 issues, and covered most UK 8-bit micros of the day
with articles covering gaming, industry news, lots of type-ins and the
odd technical article. It also had the "world's first" computer-drawn
cartoon strip, "Shatter".

These PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on
www.worldofspectrum.org . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used and by the relatively low DPI of the
source images. 

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check(or Google RetroPDFs) for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to RetroPDFs
for their support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
