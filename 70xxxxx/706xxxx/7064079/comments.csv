Just make sure if you don't want to deal with the hassle of dealing with the discs for Soundtrack Pro, DVD Studio pro and Motion that you are prepared to uncheck those options (the installation doesn't give you much choice). The serial number listed here is valid and I can do what I need to do and what I want to do with just Final Cut Pro by itself. "

Shut down the dmg then started over. Everything went well. 
2. This is Final Cut Studio installer. I did de-select the Soundtrack Pro, DVD Studio Pro, and Motion per @georgiaguy. FCP took about 5 minutes. I ran install again to check on these apps and it called for additional discs that were not part of torrent."
