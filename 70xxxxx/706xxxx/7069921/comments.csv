,Ivcoe,2012-03-02T02:13Z,"in my country we all begin to wonder who the Inspiron is. In the end you're the man who supplies half of the world in the latest trance albums, sometimes even a few days before their release. I wish I wrote an article about you :D Tell us something about You ;D"

As always I can count on you for my trance and progressive needs.

Specifically, Armada House 2012 Vol. 1"
,futureshock999,2012-03-03T09:52Z,"Thank you inspiron!

@green1985, et al - magnet links are harder to trace than torrents if the law is watching, which is why PB went full magnet.  Not impossible, just harder, you understand."
,blue775,2012-03-03T15:44Z,awesome share!! thank you

,danbaz,2012-03-06T12:08Z,"Thanks for the up! Why are the split tracks@320 and the continuous mixes@128?? Would have been better at 320, considering I only wanted the two mixes. It's funny you say there is no difference when listening. True, which is why I've never understood what the point of split tracks is on a mixed disc??"
,NAHOM1974,2012-03-06T17:52Z,Well done you're best
,DJFlyer,2012-03-07T00:42Z,"I LUV ""INDAMIX""!!! It should be countinued mixes with a twist of chillout slowdowns More, more, Amore!!!"
,djtaban,2012-03-09T19:15Z,"but when burning the tracks on a CD, the mixture is completely lost, but I see here are the tracks separately and also together in a single track I hope to do that same with all of your albums thanks!!! !!!!"
,jesusens,2012-03-11T04:57Z,Thanks men its fantastic music !!!
