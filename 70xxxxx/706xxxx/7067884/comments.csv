,Ozdl,2012-03-01T06:42Z,Thanks ettv - been looking forward to this one!
,rgjjgr,2012-03-01T06:55Z,why are you putting the files in mp4? avi is obviously the best way to go.
,carblueberry,2012-03-01T07:48Z,"@rgjjgr

mp4 normally uses x264 encoding, which provides high quality at a very low file size.

Since more than an year back I had moved from 350mb avi to 150mb files. They are normally called as mini 480p. It has almost the same quality as the 350mb avi. If I go for 400-500mb 720p videos, they totally blow 350mb avi away.

Download a few files and check it out yourself.

Plus nowadays you can't say that mp4 is not supported by your dvd player/mobile phone etc, since a few years now, its now fully supported. Ofcourse if you have some very very old equipment you will have to download avi, for which there are so many sources out there. So kindly don't scold ettv, he is doing us a big service. :-).........."

That may all be true but my TV only plays avi and many others are in the same boat. MP4 is useless for me. "

Don't get me wrong I love the access to these dl, but like others my tv won't play it, whether its on disc or usb its not playing. 
Thanks for the explanation."
