Adi Ulmansky - Adi Ulmansky EP (2011)

I couldn't find this album anywhere in torrent form or direct download form - it's not even available for purchase on iTunes. It's short and sweet but it's some supremely excellent music that needs to be heard. Adi Ulmansky is an Israeli singer-songwriter and producer that can be heard on tracks from Borgore as well as her band, Lorena B. The files in this torrent were ripped from her Soundcloud profile at the highest quality it would muster.

3. Deer You Make Me Feel Like Dust on Your Fur (2:40)
4. Forest (4:16)
