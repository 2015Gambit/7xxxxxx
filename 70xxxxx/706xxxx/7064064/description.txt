Release Description

While attempting to save the life of a fatally-stabbed young woman, ER nurse Kaitlyn is accidentally electrocuted by a backfiring defibrillator. Upon awakening, she begins to experience memories that are not hers, but rather those of the now-deceased victim. With her sanity in question and nowhere to turn, Kaitlyn must weave through the womans past and piece together her memories before the killer strikes again.
