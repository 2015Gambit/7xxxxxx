Subtitles: None
Date: 2012.02

Director: Alfonso Arau

Genres: Comedy | Fantasy

Plot:
Woody Allen plays Tex, a kosher butcher. Sharon Stone plays his unfaithful wife Candy. Tex
catches Candy in the act and in a fit of rage he kills her. To conceal his crime he cuts up her
body and buries it in the desert in New Mexico. However, when her hand surfaces, a blind woman
trips over it and it restores her sight. The hand is then considered to be the "hand of the
Virgin." Despite the church's fallen priest objecting, the ambitious mayor of the town creates an
international three-ring circus of miracle-seekers, TV crews, and born-again local prostitutes
all interested in the hand. All of this goes on while Tex is desperately trying to recover the
hand before the sheriff finds it and uses it as evidence against him.
