Now that we have to get a magnet link we can't rename directly - so gotta wait for the file to be created and then rename it :(

Is it perhaps when you encode the file from your recording that you have to make a secondary name that causes you to upload .avi.avi ?"
,SoWErA3,2012-02-29T17:32Z,Ops forgot to say Thanks a lot for another great upload which is high quality as well :)
