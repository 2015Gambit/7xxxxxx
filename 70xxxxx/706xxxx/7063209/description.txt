:: PLOT :: In 1931, Hugo Cabret, a 12-year-old boy, lives with his widowed father, a kind and devoted master clockmaker in Paris. Hugo's father takes him to see films and loves the films of Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s best of all. Hugo's father is burned alive in a museum fire, and Hugo is taken away by his uncle, an alcoholic watchmaker who is responsible for maintaining the clocks in the railway station Gare Montparnasse. His uncle teaches him to take care of the clocks, then disappears.Hugo lives between the walls of the station, maintaining the clocks, stealing food and working on his father's most ambitious project: repairing a broken automaton â€“ a mechanical man who is supposed to write with a pen. Convinced that the automaton contains a message from his father, Hugo goes to desperate lengths to fix it. Hugo steals mechanical parts in the station to repair the automaton, but he is caught by a toy store owner named Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s who takes Hugo's notebook from him, with notes and drawings for fixing the automaton.
