Canadian alt-country rockers The Wooden Sky started as a school project, but over the years the group has morphed into a band that deserves your attention. Their niche may be folk and country melodies, but throughout their upcoming Every Child a Daughter, Every Moon a Sun you can hear subtle nods to other genres hidden underneath the twangy guitars.

The album is a journey through the bandâ€™s search for different ways to express their music and the outcome is a solid effort that the Toronto-based band recorded in the same Montreal studio that the Arcade Fire recorded Funeral.

Throughout the 13 songs The Wooden Skyâ€™s energy is stretched over a wide array of emotions, but their talents are never thin. You can stream Every Child a Daughter, Every Moon a Sun below.
