The Games Machine Issues 01-34 (complete) Oct/Nov '87 - Sep '90

** This collection is a rework of a previosly release. The content
** should be much the same, but the image quality is much improved.

The Games Machine was Newsfield's multi-format magazine, launched as a
sister publication to Crash, Zzap! 64 and Amtix. It covered most formats
of the day, with emphasis on the emerging 16-bit consoles and computers.
Apart from reviews, there was a fair amount of industry news and
comment, along with plenty of articles from the gobsh!te of the era Mel
Croucher.

These PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on
www.worldofspectrum.org . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used , and by the relatively low DPI of
the source images.

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check(or Google 'RetroPDFs') for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their
help, support and donations.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
