Knit afghans (throws), bedspreads pattern collection
===============================
Most afghans (throws) are made in crochet, but here is a collection of knit 

patterns for afghans (throws) and bedspreads. Many of these are just a 

square with a pattern, which can be also used in other projects. 

They are not rar-ed, so you can pick and choose which files you need. 
Everything was carefully renamed for consistency, so that the file name 

reflects the real title, and you can see whether you have it or not. 

To choose the files you want to download when downloading a .torrent file, 

if you're using Firefox it will ask you "save or open". Choose Open with 

uTorrent or your other client. And you'll get a window with all the files 

checked. Uncheck the ones you don't want, click OK and you're done. 

To choose the files you want to download when downloading a magnet link, 

in uTorrent) go to the lower half of the window, click the "Files" tab, wait a 

bit until the list of files appears; select those you don't want, right click and 

check "Don't download". Other clients also have this capability. 

However, if you download the whole thing and seed it, you will do a service 

to other downloaders. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Site statistics are not always accurate - actually, they 

seldom are! For instance, you may see 0 seeders and just a few leechers, 

but if you download and open in your torrent client, you may see that in fact 

there are many. So don't trust the numbers you see and despair, check for 

yourself before giving up.
