,twijjit,2012-03-01T17:31Z,"Seems to have an encoding error - gets a little pixelated every few seconds, but looks like it's still watchable. Checked it out on two computers, before and after reinstalling K-Lite, same problem, and only hapens with this file, so I know its not on my end. Both popular copies, this one and from ettv have the exact same problem. "
,Mister22,2012-03-05T19:07Z,"Why is it that all the ""x264"" torrents have weird picture quality with pixels flying all over the place and often the sound doesn't fit the screen. 

Im using Windows media player classic with updated codec packs. "
