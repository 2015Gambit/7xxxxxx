
The much loved and highly popular adventure game from 1993 returns in this special remastered edition for the iPhone and iPod touch.

Simon the Sorcerer is a graphical point-and-click adventure game. 
It received very high ratings and became one of the most popular and loved games of the genre.
It is very similar in style to LucasArts' many popular point-and-click adventures of the 1990s, like Monkey Island.


There are some things that kids just shouldn't have to put up with. Being transported to some weird dimension full of goblins, dwarves, swamplings, stupid wizards and sleeping giants is definitely one of them. 
Simon is a teenager transported into a fantasy world as a sorcerer dressed in a cloak and pointy hat. He must use his logic and magical skills to solve puzzles as he progresses through the game.

The story begins with the protagonist, Simon, as an ordinary teenager. His dog, "Chippy", discovers a chest in the loft of his house containing a spellbook titled "Ye Olde Spellbooke". Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, but a portal opens above it. Chippy goes through the portal and Simon follows.
After entering the portal, Simon finds himself in another world. He escapes from some goblins who intended to eat him and discovers that he has been brought on a quest to rescue the wizard Calypso from the evil sorcerer Sordid.

When Simon discovers the tuneless bard, the repulsive Rapunzel and a pair of demons with a serious attitude problem, it could prove to be one clichÃ© too far. 
With a Nobel Prize for attempted humour and puzzles so fiendish you'll certainly need help from the wise owl, Simon the Sorcerer is guaranteed to provide a distraction from the drudgery of modern life.
