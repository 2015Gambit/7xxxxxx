Prager 20120228 â€“ 2 Robo-Rick

Prager H2: Mark Taylor fills in for Dennis. In Michigan Rick Santorum has a â€œrobo-callâ€ circulating that asks democrats 
to vote for him in todayâ€™s GOP primaryâ€¦ one caller in Arizona says that after hearing it, heâ€™s changing his vote from
 Santorum to Romney. Mark is opposed to encouraging this type of mischief in a primary election.
