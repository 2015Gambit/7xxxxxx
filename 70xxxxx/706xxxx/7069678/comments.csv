,rojov123,2012-03-03T19:49Z,can you upload something like this for the samsung galaxy s2 lte?
,GeckoGold,2012-03-07T01:14Z,"For the Galaxy S2, unlocking is simpler as there is an Android app in the Android Market by Chainfire which will unlock your phone. But that requires root so you will have to root your phone first with the PC software 'SuperOneClick' from http://shortfuse.org/. Connect phone to PC with 'debug mode on' on the phone. Then use the Chainfire app to unlock network operator lock. Then it is a matter of flashing a official Samsung firmware (found as www.sammobile.com) using the Odin3 v1.85 Software found anywhere on the net. You may have to then do a full system reset."
