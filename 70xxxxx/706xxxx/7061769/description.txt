A new version of Rogero's CFW has been released to the public bringing it to version 3.0.
As most of you know Rogero is the developer of Rogero's backup manager that is used on
the PS3. Rogero has now come up with his new CFW for the new year, yes it has been a
while, but this addition is always welcome to a plethora of CFW's that we have. This CFW
is mainly aimed at those who downgrade using hardware flashers and can also be used on
non downgraded consoles.
