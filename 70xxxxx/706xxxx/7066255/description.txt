Any Which Way You Can [1980]

Philo takes part in a bare knuckle fight - as he does - to make some more money
than he can earn from his car repair business. He decides to retire from
fighting, but when the Mafia come along and arrange another fight, he is pushed
into it. A motorcycle gang and an orangutan called Clyde all add to the 'fun'.
