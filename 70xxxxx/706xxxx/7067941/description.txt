"Child's Welfare" 

Detective Bensons half-brother Simon Marsden 
turns up in New York after a five year absence, 
and asks for help - Child Services is threatening 
to take his children away from him. She asks 
defense attorney Bayard Ellis to represent her 
brother, but the seemingly simple case turns into 
a disaster for Ellis and his client. Meanwhile, a 
homeless couple finds a newborn baby abandoned 
near a hospital, and Detectives Fin and Rollins 
follow the evidence to a shocking discovery.
