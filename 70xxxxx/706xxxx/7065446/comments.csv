,noobd,2012-02-29T20:05Z,"Solution:

1) Right click ""Get this torrent"" & click ""copy link address""
2) Open BitTorrent
3) File -> Add Torrent from URL
4) Paste
5) Done

Might be slightly different if you're not using BitTorrent but this worked for me. Downloaded White Collar in a little over the time it took to type this."

@Ric_Santorum, have you ever heard the saying that every action has an equal and or opposite reaction? Well, pretty soon the moderators will be banning people like you that do nothing but leave ignorant and discriminatory comments, that's called KARMA, so keep it up."
