[T],promodsharma,2012-03-02T03:27Z,"It seems that I have all Hit-and-Runs, (Download & Run) and No Seeders (Except myself). Please help me seed. I have been seeding for the last 24 hours contentiously. At one time I had 12 Seeders for about 15 minutes, but they all fell off. Please help me seed."
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-03T06:01Z,"Thanks mates, I am overwhelemed ! I thank you from the bottom of my heart to help me seed. You all heard my plea and within a couple of hours there were 50 seeders ! This is awesome !   This is what the spirit of TPB is and this is what sharing is all about !"
