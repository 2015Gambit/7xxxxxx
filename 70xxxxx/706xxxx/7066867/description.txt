The Here and Now is the fourth full-length studio album by British metalcore band Architects, and was released on 24 January 2011 in the United Kingdom and majority of Europe, and 25 January 2011 in the United States. The album's title is derived from a lyric in the first song, "Day in Day Out", which reads "To all those not living in the here and now".[citation needed] The mentioned song was also released digitally as the album's first single on 27 September 2010 in the United Kingdom and majority of Europe, and 28 September 2010 in the United States. It was later accompanied by a music video, which premiered online on 30 November 2010, through Alternative Press' website. As with the previous album, Hollow Crown, all tracks are tuned to C# standard apart from two tracks; Stay Young Forever and Year In Year Out/Up and Away, which are tuned C# standard, but with the low C# dropped to G#. On this album the band continued to move further away from their technical metal roots, incorporating more nuanced, melodic songwriting, their influences changing dramatically; on earlier releases a sound influenced by bands such as Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die, Meshuggah and other technical bands, while here Architects state their influences to be bands such as This Is Hell, Comeback Kid, Have Heart, Pink Floyd, Kings of Leon, Thrice and Underoath.
