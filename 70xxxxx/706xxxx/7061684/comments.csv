,aarque,2012-02-28T08:18Z,"I absolutely guarantee you can unban, write here or to my thread in Suprbay if you want instructions. They can probably even let you edit these torrents so you can credit your original name.

I haven't gone anywhere, been working hard at a new job and it wasn't until this past weekend that I bridged my lame new modem so I could open ports and resume uploading, just been trying to find something decent to share...

Glad to see somebody giving at least an uninhibited review."
,pumpernickel,2012-02-28T10:54Z,"It also happened to me that I got banned after I uploaded a new scenery (which I actually bought before) that was not yet on TPB.
Nobody told me that I was banned and of course I still do not know the reason for it.
A few days later my exact upload was re-uploaded by a ""regular"" and nothing happened.
Since then I did not dare to upload again :-("
,FS_Junkie,2012-02-28T11:49Z,"Haven't installed/tried it yet, but the torrent d/l looked good (and fast). Many thanks ... whatever your name is LOL ;-)"

,aarque,2012-02-28T14:48Z,"Accounts are only EVER banned for commercial spam or repeated anti-social comments, as an example, catshit1. His account was banned because I went to the forums and requested it. An investigation was made and it was determined that he never contributed a thing, in either torrent or comment, yet he caused much distress as evidenced by other comments directed at him. For catshit1, it was an easy decision.
Anyone else that is blocked is due to an error in the site software. My own account was once blocked and a simple request restored it.
Think about it for one second: TPB supports open communication, they do not want to block or ban anyone unless they inhibit open communication."
,repulos,2012-02-29T12:13Z,"Does it work this Sukhoi, guys?"
,Rapterman_123,2012-02-29T16:53Z,yes it works fine for me
,aarque,2012-03-01T03:19Z,"and ya, mickey, we may be active, but we're not paying, apparently. Seems boerse.bz has gone the route of wicked friends and extorts paid memberships to get the best shares, lame. Wicked friends is way better and probably more reasonable, I think $5 will get you three months."
,klyd971,2012-03-02T09:59Z,"thks,

,FAA1,2012-03-08T18:21Z,"Anonymous, sorry to bother you, but, I d/l and installed the sukhoi twice and it doesn't work for me. It installs fine and I can select it in FSX but after 15 or 20 seconds, it crashes. Any suggestions?"
,repulos,2012-03-09T08:44Z,FAA': Try reinstall your sceneries where you fly. Lot of guys use this ripped Sukhoi and works without any crash including me.
