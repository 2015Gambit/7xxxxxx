This is an excellent and well-written book which tells the story of the Rhodesian Special Air Service - one of the best fighting forces in the world. The author documents the history of the Rhodesian SAS, from the early days in the Western Desert during WWII to the foundation of the Rhodesian SAS in Malaya, then back to Africa, where the SAS saw action through Federation and the UDI (Unilateral Decalaration of Independance).
