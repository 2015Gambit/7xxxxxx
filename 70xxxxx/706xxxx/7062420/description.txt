Storyline:
Sally and Conrad, different as black and white, have pushed their single mom, Joan Walden, to the limit.
Conrad endlessly breaks the rules rule and Sally, though well-behaved, has bossed away every friend she has.
And on the Saturday that Joan is to host her company's party, her preparations have fallen prey to Conrad\'s shenanigans.
Thus, she lays down a mom-sized decree: Sally and Conrad are not to leave the house while she is at work; furthermore, they are forbidden from making a mess or misbehaving in any way.
While she\'s away, suddenly an unexpected guest--a six-foot-tall talking feline, sporting a red-and-white-striped stovepipe hat--appears.
The original party animal himself arrives to turn their world upside down by showing Sally and Conrad that "it's good to have fun--but you have to know how!"
