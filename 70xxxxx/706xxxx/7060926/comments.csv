Here you are : 
1st : Plug-In Your Iphone4S/Ipad 2to your computer.
2nd : Open Absinthe
3rd : Press the jailbreak button on absinthe.
Since you pressed it, don't touch nothing ! 
4th  : Wait until your iphone restart.
5th : When it's on, slide to unlock & search the absinthe icon on your iphone. Press it. It's gonna be directing you to Greenpois0n.com
6th :  Your iphone/ipad will automatically restart & when it's on, you'll have cydia icon instead of absinthe icon. =)
I'm french so sorry for all the mistakes in English. :)"
