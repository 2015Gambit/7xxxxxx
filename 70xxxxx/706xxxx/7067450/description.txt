NAVIGON Europe - GPS navigation


With NAVIGON you can transform your Android smartphone into a fully functional 
mobile navigation system that is every bit as good as the multi-award-winning 
personal navigation devices from NAVIGON in terms of its user-friendliness and 
features. Thanks to a faithful adaptation of the menu functions, NAVIGON fits in 
seamlessly with the Android operating concept.

On-board navigation entails no data transfer or roaming charges, for example, 
for route calculation or map displays. Regular updates ensure your NAVIGON is 
always up to date.

Note:
- Important: !Not yet working on Samsung Galaxy Nexus!
- Positioning your smartphone correctly in the vehicle is very important to 
ensure optimal GPS reception and for your own safety! We recommend attaching 
your telephone to the windscreen with a suitable suction pad holder. Ensure that 
this is always positioned outside of the range of the airbags!
- NAVIGON is an on-board solution. This means that all map material, voice 
announcements and system files are saved on the telephone. Therefore no charges 
or waiting time for data transfer are incurred.
- The Europe version requires approx. 2GB of free memory. Please ensure you have 
sufficient available mass-storage space (SD card).
- The map material must be downloaded after installing the app via NAVIGON Fresh 
on a PC or via wireless Internet on the smartphone. Please ensure a reliable and 
safe connection is available.
- Samsung users: please only download using wireless Internet!
- on first startup a short data connection (ca. 25kB) is required to register 
your product

Whether in the car, by bike or on foot, NAVIGON hopes you have fun navigating.
