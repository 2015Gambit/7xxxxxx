,slevinlol,2012-03-23T22:31Z,"For the ones who wish to install patches using this Release, follow this guide:

1- Install the game

2- Copy original Paul.dll and Witcher2.exe to game folder (replacing the cracked ones)

3- Download and Install patches as needed, following the sequence is mandatory!

 1- Patcher_EFIGS
 2- Patcher_1.1_International
 3- Patcher_1.2
 4- Patch_1_3
 5- Patcher_1_3_5
 6- patch2_0_INT
 7- patch2_1

4- Play the game (no need to crack, since after patch 1.1, the game became DRM free)

PS: DLCs are included on patch 2.0

Hope this helps."

,Ahall88,2012-04-14T23:10Z,When running the EFIGS patch should it be doing more than just having the patch window say shutting down and never progressing?
,lisapower,2012-04-22T19:29Z,"Patches, Patches Patches Patches,

Why is not one able to make just a working version with all Updates already installed? It would be so much easy for the Users. "
,lisapower,2012-04-23T05:58Z,"OK, Full respect to the Uploader & those who made this nice Black Box Pack, it works on my Hackintosh. Installed, and ready to play, but only in windowed mode. but it works. thanks"
