It's an after-the-bomb story, where all the men have been killed off by radiation or what-not, and world leaders Rebecca Wild, Lynn
LeMay and Kira bemoan the fact that the world's supply of silicone is depleted and a substitute is needed fast. But first, the three of them get to know each other a little better, pussy-to-pussy-wise. Then it's on to the scientists.
Each of the leaders consults with a member of the research team that's trying to come up with the new chest-inflation material. Rebecca plots with Montana, promising her the world if she'll come through first. But before coining through, Montana conies across (with the nookie) and cums ... and cums. LeMay's co-conspirator is Kim Chambers, who isn't sure it yogurt would be a good silicone substitute. Maybe she just isn't "cultured". The last segment has Kira with Traci Prince, who shows her usual grinning enthusiasm that is missing in too many other lesbo features.
