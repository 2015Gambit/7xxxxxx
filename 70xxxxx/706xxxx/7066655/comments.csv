windows doesn't recognize??
what player can i open this with???"
,chiggs,2012-03-08T22:11Z,"If you are having problems downloading this or issue 93, with the magnet not working, open up your Utorrent or torrent client, click on Get This Torrent and select, copy link, than go back to your client and paste it in the option Download from Url. Works perfect with Utorrent and the only way I could get either downloads to work, hope helps others as it took me a while to figure this out, as easy of a fix as it is lol."
