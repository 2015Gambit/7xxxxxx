Note: This is a update of a comic I already translated before. The filesize is about 3/8 of the previous filesize with little loss in quality. That's why the previous one was deleted.

This is the first part of the Billy the Cat series, originally made by Colman and Desberg. It's quite a nice series, and it's a shame that it was never translated to another language than Dutch or French. The original title was â€œdans la peau dâ€™un chatâ€.

There's also a television series loosely based on this comic, but more light and for a younger audience.

I hope fans of that television series (which was translated into English) enjoy this fan translation of the first part: In the skin of a Cat, and ask for more, or that a new audience is intrigued by this comic.

I would also like corrections on my grammar and spelling, and general word usage.
If my sentences are weird, please correct me, then I'll upload a new version with the corrections included.

When an official release is released, this torrent will probably be deleted. You have been warned.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use *.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
