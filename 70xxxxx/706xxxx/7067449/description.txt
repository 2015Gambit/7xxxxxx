A farmerâ€™s life may not be the most exciting one, but when a bolt of lightning strikes one farmer, youâ€™ll (as that farmer) find yourself thrown back in time to the days of King Arthur, tossing aside your farmerâ€™s hat for a complete suit of armor as the King asks you to find the Fountain of Youth and bring some water back for him.
New Yankee in King Arthurâ€™s Court is Alawarâ€™s upcoming tower defense game, thatâ€™s set to combine the in-depth micro-management of the genre with an intuitive interface allowing even the most casual of gamers to jump in. Throughout the gameâ€™s 40 levels, youâ€™ll construct various buildings for your settlements, like lighthouses for your workers or towers that can be used to defend your path.

The gameâ€™s enemies come in the form of skeletons and goblins that will try to steal your treasure or capture your workers on each level. Youâ€™ll need to click on resources to collect them, and can build up a level of mana, allowing you to cast various spells on the battlefield. These spells might allow you to speed up your workersâ€™ actions, or even freeze your enemies so that youâ€™ll have more time to attack them before they make off with your loot!
New Yankee in King Arthurâ€™s Court will allow you to build eight different buildings across four locations. There are six spells to learn and master overall, and as you go along, youâ€™ll make your way ever closer to one heck of a twist!
