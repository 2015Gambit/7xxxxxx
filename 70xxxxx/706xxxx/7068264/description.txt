My thanks to the original seed of the full DVD from which these tracks were edited and split into a format (keeping the original quality) where each music track may be entered into a Music Video collection for Video Discotheque playback using the VJ software of your choice.

16:9 Ratio original Dolby 5.1 sound.   Original video quality, split into music tracks using DVD Decrypter and correctly file names and tagged using industry standard notation.

For Track listing please look at the torrent files.   Enjoy.

Rigmar Radio, Rockin' the Free World since 1967
