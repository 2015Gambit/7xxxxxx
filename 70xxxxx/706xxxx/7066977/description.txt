The one and only season of the conspiracy drama Rubicon. This American series was created by Jason Horwitch and was produced by Henry Bromell and was broadcast on the AMC Television network in mid to late 2010. The series centers on an intelligence analyst at a national think tank in New York City called the American Policy Institute (API) who discovers that he may be working with members of a secret society that manipulates world events on a grand scale. The main stars include James Badge Dale, Arliss Howard, Miranda Richardson and Michael Cristofer. The cast is superb given the slow character development that demands close viewer attention. The series starts a little slow but hits it's stride by the middle episodes and closes strong. It is a shame the series was not renewed, but given AMC's hits like Breaking Bad, Mad Men and The Walking Dead it was not that surprising the series was cancelled due to disappointing ratings and AMC's impatience. These episodes are all high definition video (1280x720) and high quality audio (AC3 5.1) and are in MKV format. These are best viewed using the VLC player.
