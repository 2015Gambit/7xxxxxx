,itworks22,2012-04-05T17:36Z,"Works great - thank you.

My Avast antivirus wanted to put it in its 'sandbox' but I ran it as Normal and gets installed without a hitch. Within the ChattChitto setup are included working serial keys. When you run if for the 1st time, it tries to register with Techsmith so you do need to unplug temporarily your router. It will then run - say you'll register later - and when in the program, under preferences, turn off automatic updates so there's no danger of getting the program blocked.

v11 is more complex than my previous v8 which is a pity but I was having trouble autoscrolling a web page in v8 & 10 but that feature is fixed in v11. 

Very pleased all in all - thank you uploader."
