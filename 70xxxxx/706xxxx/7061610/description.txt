Probing the 1965 assassination of Malcolm X, this provocative documentary lays emphasis on the political climate that preceded his murder, including the controversial black leader's planned collaboration with Martin Luther King Jr. The alliance was simple: King would lead efforts in the South while Malcolm X took the North. But the film puts forth a shocking conspiracy theory speculating that the U.S. government deliberately kept the two apart.
