,Mooboog,2012-02-29T07:10Z,"Any chance of a smaller file in a separate torrent? 24Gbs is a bit rich for me to download, and I don't get NASCAR on TV :("
,Hard2Find2,2012-02-29T14:41Z,"It's wednesday the 29th and the peer count is 417. If you do not like the commercials or file size, #1 Don't use it. #2 Download the file and cut the commercials, then re-encode it yourself and dump it. (just make sure you use your bandwith to share it with everyone else) #3 Buy you an external? #4 Wait for a ""proper rip"" LMAO good luck with that!"
,Ponty23,2012-02-29T15:37Z,Never mind the haters! Huge thx for the upload. Too bad i am still dl-ing it. Waiting for it to finish so i can watch it finally. I still dont know the results of the race!
,whocaresjustseed,2012-02-29T18:32Z,nice work hard2find2
,talisbriedis,2012-03-01T04:13Z,"Thx and all, but I show around 90 seeders, but I am only connecting to leechers. Downloading is soooooo slow. Any idea why I am not getting any connections to a seeder? I have no problems with any other torrents, I have excellent bandwidth....etc etc...Living in Latvia, we have no chance to see Sprint cup. Torrents is my only way. Heck, I dont care if the file is so big (shame about commercials), I just want faster downloads!"
,Hard2Find2,2012-03-01T05:22Z,The download speed is slow right now cause no one else has the full files but myself reguardless of current seed count says with 540 leachers and I have run this full blast since upload. It is 11:15pm est and I am showing many at around 75%. The speeds should increase by tomorrow Thursday March 1st around 11am est provided those that break through do not hit and run. Thanks
,talisbriedis,2012-03-01T17:13Z,"From my end I have been seeing 80+ seeds!!! OK, we FINALLY have 100% and all speeds should be good! I am gonna seed for as long as I can! "
,talisbriedis,2012-03-01T17:46Z,"ooooohhhhhh, nice quality vid!"
[T],V100,2012-03-02T20:34Z,Thank You
,Eefrune,2012-03-03T20:12Z,"Thanks for the race upload, Hard2Find2.

I noticed that the torrent file contains 12 duplicate tracker announce names, which may cause hammering on the tracker or cause clients to hammer on other clients (see x'd out list below).
