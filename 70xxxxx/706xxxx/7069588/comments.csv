,Charlie1983,2012-03-03T16:43Z,It's in WBFS format... :(
,bobbourgh,2012-03-04T01:23Z,why doesn't the magnet torrent link work?
[V],totomas1,2012-03-04T06:52Z,"Many thanks, GeronimoX. Great upload, works perfect!"
,guyyoung29,2012-03-04T12:47Z,@charlie 1983 use wii game manager and convert from wbfs to iso 
,Charlie1983,2012-03-04T13:20Z,"@guyyoung29 Thanks for the tip. buf you can see that I upload a ISO file yet for everybody how I that don't use Window$ :). Moreover, think that WBFS files are trucha signed, thats a problem for people that don't load the games with software (only with chip) and if you put this PAL version in a NTSC without software modding you can brick the Wii."
,abc123mc,2012-03-10T02:55Z,Mine turns out black and white :S does anyone else have the same issue? Thanks!
,MrKira444,2012-03-10T23:31Z,"@abc123mc

Force NTSC.

Thanks for the upload!"
,bryanmoses,2012-03-21T13:29Z,So it does work/Does it work with or without homebrew?
