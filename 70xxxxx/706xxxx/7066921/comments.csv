,Stonecold1995,2012-07-15T23:53Z,"Downloading right now.  HUGE file, so I'll seed for as long as possible.  Honestly I think it would be a much better idea to make this and encrypted RAR file and have the password be something like ""VX Heavens"" and tell it in the description or title.  That would take an extra five seconds for each downloader to input, but would save days of time for people who download this, and suddenly ""WARNING, a virus has been protected!  For your protection the file has been deleted!"".  And then having to redownload the whole damn thing...  This hasn't happened to me (I actually use Linux so I haven't needed a virus warning in ages), but I'm sure it'll happen to some unlucky Windows users."
,skulldragon,2012-07-30T22:46Z,"The thing is, if you deal with viruses, learn, how they work etc, and if you are already experienced, you won't even have your AV on - your PC is already secure enough to prevent attacks from outside and you know, how your PC works from inside, so you can kill, even the worst virus, manually, in about 2 minutes max.
Whatever your AV tells you, you will know it, that it's just pathetic propaganda or poor research. 95% of viruses you encounter are all amateur level for you.
With this knowledge we could already have an universal AV that doesn't need a signature database update at all - it uses program build logic and your input, if needed - but nobody cares to read the CPU manual..."

All these files are not in source code format so how do I use them?"
,M-theory,2012-09-15T23:17Z,"Steady 10 MB/s throughout the whole download, done within a couple of hours. Thanks dsr8803 and all the seeders! Will seed this indefinitely."
