Classic Albums: Simply Red: Stars 
"Stars" was released in 1991 and is regarded as the classic Simply Red album, with outstanding hit tracks including "Something Got Me Started", "Your Mirror", "For Your Babies" and the title track "Stars". This album was very much the dominating force of 1991 with record sales reaching dizzying heights and beating the likes of Michael Jackson, U2 and Dire Straits. This programme takes a look at the classic songs from the album and also includes specially recorded tracks, archive footage and promotional clips. We learn of Mick Hucknall's musical vision and his inspirational forces both past and present, and how these influenced the songs he wrote and recorded. Also featured in the programme are exclusive interviews with the producer Stewart Levine, Motown legend Lamont Dozier and members of the band, giving an insight into why the albums, and Simply Red, have been such phenomenal successes. A true Classic Album.
