,scarlette,2012-02-29T08:27Z,Thanks very much :).
,BlueTak,2012-02-29T15:30Z,"Thanks tr108. I've downloaded a few of yours today, and the sound/picture quality is brilliant at home.

I hope you're planning to stick around, as you'll be my first stop from now."
[T],tr108,2012-02-29T22:23Z,"Wow, thanks everyone. I'm really glad you like my encodes!"
[T],tr108,2012-03-01T05:33Z,"BlueTak, I'm honored to be first on the list. :)

I hope to be around for a while here, tho I won't be able to upload quite as many flicks as I have these last few weeks."
,BlueTak,2012-03-01T10:24Z,"No worries TR, I appreciate your uploads, quality > quantity."
,fabu09,2012-03-19T12:57Z,"OK I created an account just to thank you for this torrent, it completely works with iTunes and my iPod and its really clear with subtitles just like I like it. it has an alternative audio track which is the same as the first one but it slows the picture down a little when I select it.

But anyway I also would like to request 2 movies iTunes 720p version

Easy A

Confessions of a Shopaholic

I know holy-roses has uploaded both this movies but I'm looking for 720p version and Easy A though in 720p it doesn't have enough seeders and leechers

Once again thanks for the movie and keep up the great work"
[T],tr108,2012-03-20T12:25Z,"fabu09, glad you like my ups. I won't be able to do either film right now, but remind me in a few weeks. 

Btw, the 2nd audio track is Dolby Digital 5.1, meant for AppleTV playback (or, less commonly, for people who connect their Macs/PCs to a surround sound system). Just to clear up any possible confusion. :)

Thanks again for the kind words!"
,TF746,2012-05-20T18:28Z,"I'm also with BlueTak on this one. Your encodes are simply the best, and you're my first stop for movies. Kudos to you... Hey, could you get Inception up on here? Thanks."
