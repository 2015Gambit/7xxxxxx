,CaptainBF,2012-02-28T12:20Z,I just signed up to this site to say Thank you to you wushdishmeen for the Howard Stern shows. We get nothing like him in Australia. 
[V],wushdishmeen,2012-02-28T18:19Z,Nope just Monday off because of AGT tapings last night.  Even though Howard was home Sunday night and in bed by 8PM EST.   The king just is too lazy to wake up early the next day after a long day of taping.
