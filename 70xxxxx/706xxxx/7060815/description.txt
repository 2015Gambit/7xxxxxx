RELEASE  NOTES

Total Commander (former Wincmd) is a file manager
for Windows (TM) similar to the Windows Explorer.
But Total Commander uses a different approach: it
has two fixed windows side by side like a well-known
file manager for DOS.

Here are some key features of Total Commander:

* Keyboard functions similar to the DOS original.
* Supports Drag & Drop with the mouse, including to
the print manager.
* Extended copying, moving, renaming and deleting of
entire trees (Enables deleting "full"
directories).
* Archives are handled like subdirectories. You can
easily copy files to and from archives. The
appropriate archiving program is automatically
called. pkzip, arj, lha, rar, uc2 and ace are all
supported.
* Start-menu (User-defined commands) to place your
frequently used DOS or Windows programs into a
drop-down menu. The actual directory and/or the
file under the cursor can be delivered to the
application.
* Command line for the simple starting of programs
with parameters, simply by typing the program name
or by pressing CTRL+ENTER or CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.
* Enhanced  search function with full text search in
any files across multiple drives.
* Built in file viewer (F3) to view files of ANY
SIZE in hex, binary or text format, using either
the ASCII- (DOS) or the ANSI- (Windows) character
set. The line width and font size can now be
changed.
* Internal Unzip by Info-Zip, which allows unzipping
without calling an external program! The source
code in Turbo-Pascal is free and can be obtained
directly from the author.
* Configurable button bar to start external programs
or internal menu commands.
* Configurable main menu.
* Internal unpackers for ZIP, ARJ, LZH, GZ, TAR, RAR
and ACE formats.
* Internal ZIP packer, based on ZLib by Jean-loup
Gailly.

What's new in Total Commander 7.55+

* Use MLSD command for file listings in FTP function
(better time resolution, time in UTC)
* Transfer files between two computers over a
special USB cable
* Improvements to synchronize dirs function: Compare
via plugins and FTP, options to skip hidden files
and junctions (SyncIgnoreJunctions in wincmd.ini),
SITE UTIME in ftp sync
* Compare by content now shows different and changed
lines with a slightly different background color
(configurable via wincmd.ini)
* FTP connection details dialog split into two tabs
* "cd" command in button bar and start menu now
accepts parameter /user: (user name for network
connection)
* Open archives also in virtual folders like the Desktop
* New internal commands with parameters SELECTFILES,
OPENTABSL and OPENTABSR, e.g. for the button bar
* Let the user set the user agent for HTTP connections
* Unpack directory time stamps from archives
* Lister: Increased maximum line length to 1024
characters (Unicode: 512)
* Verify CRC checksums: Also support CRC files in
UTF16 Unicode format, and SHA256
* Show Terminal Server and Win7 XP mode drives in
drive dropdown list and drive buttonbar
* Ctrl+Shift+B and cm_DirBranchSel shows branch view
of only the selected dirs+files
* Colors by file type: Get plugin data in background
thread for slow plugins
* F5 copy dialog: "Options" dialog extension can be
pinned now to remain open
* RAR with encrypted file names: Show pseudo file
<Encrypted -> F5> and let user unpack the archive
with F5
* Command line: Command "cd filename" places cursor
directly on file with name "filename"
* Search in "feed to listbox" results: Respect
option "Search subdirectories", e.g. to search 3
levels deep in all selected dirs
* Show progress dialog box when reading a directory
takes longer than 5 seconds
* Create CRC checksums: support subdirectories
(recursively), background button
* Multi-rename tool: Allow to create fields with
leading zeroes or spaces
* Create shortcuts (LNK files) also in protected
system directories
* Handle dir space calculation in background (when
user presses SPACE or Alt+Shift+Enter)
* Internal UnRAR via unrar.dll: Support target names
longer than 259 characters
* File system plugins: Support background downloads
and uploads (requires changes to plugin)
* Various new background operations: Unpack: RAR,
TAR, packer plugins (needs modification), Pack:
TAR, packer plugins
* Parallel port connection now also possible on
Windows XP/Vista/7, 64 bit
* See history.txt for all additions and fixes

COMMENTS

Do NOT distribute this release outside of the scene
Keep the scene alive and secure!

All good progs start as freeware,
then things get worse ... ;-)

INSTALLATION NOTES

`TLB'
Try it, Like it, Buy it!

1. Unpack and install.
2. Copy included files to the installed folder.
Note: The keyfile is optional and replaceable.

That's all. Have fun using it! ;-)

Always remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling
home 'during install'. Once installed, disable 'check for automatic
updates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.
