This is Victor Thorn's and Lisa Guliani's amazing book The Michael Collins Piper Reader (2005) which is "the best of" compilation of Piper's writings all gathered together in one place. This collection includes essays not found on the Internet, previously unpublished writings, interviews (including the long-lost Final Judgment tapes), reviews, plus insights into JFKâ€™s assassination, the OKC Bombing, FDR & Pearl Harbor, Israelâ€™s deliberate attack on the USS Liberty, Martin Luther King, the Federal Reserve, and much more. Michael Collins Piper, a fearless researcher who uncovers the whole truth, is undoubtedly among the best writers of the 21st century. His previous books have sent shockwaves through the plutocrats, whose activities were exposed for everyone to see. 280 pages. A must read for everyone.
