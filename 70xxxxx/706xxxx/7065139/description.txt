Here is the video that is up on youtube, but the HD reedited version that the person who posted it on youtube had for download through some garbage website.  After waiting a day for that download to finish I figured that I\\\'d post it up on here to liberate the file and make it easier to obtain.  This kind of performance should not be hard to acquire for viewing, it is simply amazing.
