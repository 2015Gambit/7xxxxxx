,Mutegrill,2012-03-03T08:38Z,"You're a fungus PXGamer. A fungus, but not stupid fungus (as it seems), considering your upload list and how you're answering (not) in avoidandce to the important questions of quality/cam. Your'e about 13-15 years old I would guess, and IF I'm right about your age, you'll grow up being a very smart and successful man. If I'm wrong, you're already wasted on crack or some similar drug."
,awinahe,2012-03-06T10:46Z,feedback on quality please... Thanks!
,PXGamer,2012-03-08T09:41Z,"Plz don't be angry with me, cause if my friend did copy it then it's not my fault."
