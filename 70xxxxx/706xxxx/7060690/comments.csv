,ryzy,2012-02-28T10:08Z,"If mean Episode 1 mission 1 (first mission in original campain) warehouse appears after you received rice seeds from Thorne and built casino.
Then appears second demographic group and warehouse in the construction menu. So it isn't bug. You must be patient next time :)"
,jpweb72,2012-02-29T00:25Z,"Thanks

Thanks a lot"
,freddyshark123,2012-02-29T00:25Z,"It is a fake.

1. Why is it in .rar while the patch 1.01 and the game is not?
2. Pictures can be taken from an original copy
3. It is not an offline patcher (so it won't work, since u need internet)
4. It is not announced on ""official"" ways that reloaded brought out a second patch for Anno 2070.

I did as i wrote in instruction. Just look around and do what EVE said. Now  i am in Episode 3 mission 3 and i haven't any problems to come through previous missions.

@freddyshark123

man first download and try then comment but i answer your points.

@1 Because i packed ot
@ 2 Pictures are from RELOADED Multi 6 copy from TPB
@3 It works without internet
@4 official Reloaded site... there are a lot of similar sites so do you think you know ""official""? not fake?

Just download and try it take 10 min. i dont force anyone to try but stupid comments from people who even not try it really tick me off.

Of course problem is that i havent skull? That i have some shitty torrents, nothing important? If you mean this so fuck you sincerely"
,ryzy,2012-02-29T01:45Z,"ps
@jpweb72 

i am using avast and there is no threat

@freddyshark123
i have few torrents but every torrent i test before i upload

"
,ghststkr,2012-02-29T16:34Z,"It really works, i had doubts at first (cuz its smaller than than the earlier patches). just copy everything game folder(read INFO).

@ryzy, is it possible to copy save files, cuz i would like to build Guardian 1.0,it unlocks after completing the bonus mission ""The Formers"" (its a big,difficult one);
http://anno2070.wikia.com/wiki/Guardian_1.0

Thanks anyway,i was waiting for this patch. "
,ryzy,2012-02-29T17:32Z,"If you mean free game. Yes. And you dont have to copy save files. just load it from game. It works in that way, i try it"
,ghststkr,2012-02-29T19:07Z,"i meant if you completed the bonus mission i could use that save files to unlock the special building,anyway i alredy started the mission.
thnx dude...
keep it up the good work!"
,Darkeaver,2012-03-01T10:37Z,"Doesn't work, tried all 3 suggested methods and it keeps asking for a serial."
,Darkeaver,2012-03-01T10:40Z,"Ignore my last, my bad, works fine!"
,ryzy,2012-03-04T02:51Z,No ark uprages avaible. But if you want this buy game or write crack by yourself :)
,iMars666,2012-03-08T04:39Z,"Should the game be updated to v1.02 before ""applying"" this v1.03 patch?

Thnx for the upload by the way.
Scanned all files with virustotal and all seems safe."
,ryzy,2012-03-08T18:30Z,"@iMars666

To be honest - i don,t know i applied it to 1.02 version but i guess  1,02 is not necessary"
,iMars666,2012-03-09T05:05Z,@ryzy Where did you get the 1.02 patch. TPB only has 1.01 and ur copy of 1.03
,ryzy,2012-03-09T09:14Z,@iMars666 sorry my mistake. I applied itdirectlyto 1.01 version of reloaded
,Green.Lantern,2012-03-10T19:31Z,"other updates never gave me a problem but this one got a trojan as soon as I was extracting

file:C:Users****AppDataLocalTempRar$DR04.576solidcore32.dll"
,ryzy,2012-03-12T23:09Z,"@Green.Lantern

Probably false positive or you got trojan somewhere else. I play anno with this patch and my pc is still working fine :) So this isnt trojan or very useless  one :)"
,Limogi,2012-03-21T06:25Z,"Hi.
I get the message ""Username or password invalid"".
I used capitals for the name. I unistalled and reinstalled 3 times, 
What else can I do?"
,ryzy,2012-03-21T08:48Z,"RELOADED and 1
If doesnt works you probably let the game patched. Reinstall again and forbid game to access to internet - firewall,windows settings,peerblock or other stuff you know. "
,Resurrection2pac,2012-04-19T02:42Z,"I saw the 1.4 patch for this game. I instaled it and it says ""update was secsessfull... BUT,when I run the game I need the fuckin serial.. I know that I need the crack but I google it and there isn't anywhere an crack..if someone know where to find it,please tell me. thank you very much ;)
P.S. game works fuckin great,patch 1.01 too but 1.03 not sure cause i didn't install it yet."
,ryzy,2012-04-19T16:07Z,"You probably got original patch.
This patch works but you can't let the game patch because if so it stop works"
,Bmuzammil,2012-05-08T07:28Z,"********************Alert********************
hi, I was having the same problem like every body else, ""(no ships for trading)"", and so I started war lol!~ yeah, the girl in the map? one that holds the entire island, attack her ship yard and you'll get your mission completed and get the trading routes too. so build battle ships and attack her island and her ships and best of all, destroy her sea port!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and check for the error if and you'll find it fixed =) and remember after you destroyed her sea port/ship yard, build one of your own on that island!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~ 
that's all
************************************************"
,Bmuzammil,2012-05-08T08:17Z,"hi, I also updated Anno 2070 to Anno.2070.Update.1.01-RELOADED that might also be the cause of me getting error fixed if you just attacked her and didn't find your self fixing the problem just update the game and then attack lol that's how it worked for me, I loaded my previous game in which I had that problem and I do have ships in trading now. build war ships, build one of all types and you'll understand  which ones are doing trade. simple and easy. 500 MB update, download and update now."
,Undome69,2012-05-11T19:08Z,"Can someone please help me? I can't get the game to start, I've followed all of the steps but for some reason when I try to start the Anno2070.exe it doesn't start.. at all. Can anyone give me an explination on maybe why?"
