It probably was on TPB(?) but it was deleted. But i tested it by myself and it works for me. Read text below

This update include 2 addidional missions
And environment decorations

1. Copy All content to game folder
2. Don't let the game patch. Best way - block in firewall or disable internet while starting the game
3. While in game use RELOADED (necessarily big letters) as login and 1 as password

If works skip next steps

4. If this doesnt work or something miss let game patch and copy Anno5.exe again
5. If still doesn't work run install.bat BUT IT PROBABLY DELETE YOUR CAMPAIN PROGRESS 
(not saves but it will be like you not even start campain)


Sorry for my english
