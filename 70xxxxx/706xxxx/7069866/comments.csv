,PurpleFairy,2012-03-23T09:04Z,How do you exactly apply a patch to this program. I extracted the file and got the serail but I have no idea how to apply a patch help please
,blin123,2012-04-17T22:25Z,"thanks worked for me!
You apply the patch by going to the installation folder and finding the file there.

Also quick note, after the patch, you should disconnect from the internet before putting in the serial, otherwise it tells you the key was overused!"

,ultralazr,2012-06-29T11:14Z,"*Make sure your Anti Virus is TURNED OFF or temporarily disabled. Otherwise it will block this patch and label it as a trojan and you will not be able to complete all of the necessary steps!!!*

From a 'noob' to another noob, here's what you need to do to get this file to work. First, make sure you have installed a RAR extractor, do an internet search for a download of a free evaluation copy of WinRAR and install it if you don't already have one. Now, after you have downloaded the torrent, open the torrent file and install the file aimer-dvd-creator-full242.exe (make sure to leave the original torrent file open as you will need to use it again). Upon completing the installation of Aimersoft Dvd Creator the program will ask you if you would like to launch it, decline the option. Go back to the original torrent file and open the Reg file and use WinRAR to extract the file inside. Once the file is extracted double click it (it should be labeled as patch.rar now and look like a stack of bundled books if you have used WinRAR) and WinRar will open. Find the file that says aimersoft.dvd.creator.v2.5.2.15-patch.exe in the list and double click it. A pop up will appear, at the bottom click the 'patch' button and it will install the patch over the existing Aimersoft Dvd Creator file (if a popup does NOT appear, it means you still have your antivirus on, this is the crucial step for having your antivirus turned off!!!) The last thing to do is open the Aimersoft program and enter the serial information. Voila! You should now have a cracked copy of Aimersoft DVD Creator! Have fun!

*Make sure your Anti Virus is turned off! I can not stress this enough!*"

,markob50,2012-08-22T05:58Z,"I was having the same problem as srwilson.
It appears the .rar file when converted doesn't work anymore."
,incithx,2012-09-08T19:51Z,The easiest thing to do for this is to block C:Program Files (x86)Common FilesAimersoftAimersoft Helper CompactASHelper.exe in your firewall settings.  This will allow you to register without any problems.
,REBELPATRIOT,2012-09-10T07:05Z,"Hello,

When I try to apply the patch it says "" Cannot find the file, search the file?""

So I tried looking for it but at the end still says nothing was patched! 
Help me please! "
,drummerboy_73,2012-09-17T05:41Z,"REBELPATRIOT: When you get the ""Cannot find the file, search the file?"" message, search for it by going to your program folder that you installed it in (mine by default was Program Files (x86) on a Windows 7 OS), then select the .exe. file that launches the program. That should install the patch, then all you have to do is enter the registered e-mail and ser. # the first time you launch it. (Make sure to disable your internet connection, otherwise you'll get the ""this serial number has already been registered"" message.) GOOD LUCK!"
,REBELPATRIOT,2012-09-17T21:27Z,THANX it worked!!! :D
