,biglebowski215,2012-03-01T09:58Z,"ok so, what program do i use now? i have bitlord, myfreedownloader and limewire...none of which seem to be good enough all of a sudden"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-01T13:53Z,"^Why don't you use uTorrent then like 95 % of us do ? It's so simple with uTorrent. Only 1st time your Chrome/Firefox/Opera might ask what program to use - then after installing uTorrent of course, you just tell your browser (if it asks) that you will use uTorrent for magnet links. Ok ? Try now and please tell here if this helped you (to help others with problems) ?"
