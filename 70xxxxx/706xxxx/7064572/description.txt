This show is pretty much typical of early TV, usually a show had a main sponsor, in this case Plymouth, tobacco companies all sponsored TV shows with their logo prominent & hosts smoking all the time on the air & telling everyone how cool & refreshing the cigs made them feel! ;)
Commercials included with this show, complete. Tony lights up just as he is about to sing in this episode.
