Hugo is an orphan who lives in a Paris railway station, tending to the station clocks during his uncleâ€™s mysterious absence. He scrounges food from the vendors and steals mechanical parts from the owner of a toy shop, Georges Melies. In fact, Hugoâ€™s father was a watchmaker and he has inherited his fatherâ€™s talents for all things mechanical. Years before, Hugoâ€™s father found an intricate mechanical man, but they could never figure out how it worked. Hugo befriends Meliesâ€™s ward, Isabelle, and together they have an adventure, one that centers around Melies himself.
