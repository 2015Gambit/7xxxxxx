,optimum106013,2012-03-01T09:32Z,Why are you doing mp4 now? How come I can't seem to download it? Nothing is happening.
,wenex,2012-03-01T14:59Z,"@optimum106013 - mp4's are smaller and better quality and more and more players are using them, as well as being the format of choice for apple products like the ipad. The Pirate Bay is now doing magnet links exclusively. They are similar to torrents. I user uTorrent 3.1.2, and have associated magnet links with that torrent client and it works just fine. Maybe try that? Good luck."

,club1820test,2012-03-01T22:18Z,"Did not realize MP4 was considered better quality than divx (avi)??  Plus, the size saving on this file is really only about 60mbs (290 vs 350).  

Still prefer avi as my blueray player does NOT play mp4 and I dont know of any that does.  Hope this isnt the trend, - mp4 over avi."
