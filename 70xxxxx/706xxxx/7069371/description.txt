This is an .iso of the old-school pc game (year 2000) Purina Incredible Dog Challenge, I believe it only came in cereal boxes at the time. 

Just simply mount with program such as Virtual CloneDrive or Daemon etc... or burn to a physical CD, then install and play. 

Please seed and enjoy one of the old classics!
