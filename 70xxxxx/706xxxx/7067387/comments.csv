I wpould just to set the record straight on download/capturing GBTV broadcast programs.

So lets try this again.

1. The Adobe format .FLV that I am capturing the GBTV show is what is broadcast.  I am doing NO conversions.

2. It seems that GBTV is sending out multiple formats (quality) at the same time or sometimes delayed from each other.  The BEST quality format is the 1 GB size that I capture most of the time.  The second best is 700 MB size.

3. I have NO choice over which format that I capture that I can tell.

4. As I said before, many times the broadcast will be lost before it is completed in the BEST quality format.  Sometimes when this happens I start recording the second best format automatically and that is what I end up with.

5. Sometimes ALL formats are bad and I must start at the beginning to record the 2 hour program.

If you have software to view the format size of the 1 GB it is 640 x 368 while the 700 MB is 512 x 288.

From an amateurs point of view, shit happens, I get lucky and the show goes on the torrent sites!"
