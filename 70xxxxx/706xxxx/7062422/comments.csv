,Sprocket3K,2012-02-28T05:54Z,I see that we have all forgotten something important with this great upload ... and I am guilty of it far to often ... Thank You Micron66.  Thank you very much!!
,micron66,2012-02-28T06:20Z,"Sprocket3K,you are most welcome.Honestly speaking,these ebook torrents are a real pain,compared to uploading music,movies etc.

First,one has to search all over for the books,then sort out the rubbish versions from the readable/good quality versions,for this i have to skim through various versions of the same book ,this takes time,then i have to correct the author/title/series name as most people do not bother to name books in an organized fashion,all this takes time .

But i will continue to upload ebooks ,i love to read,hopefully other people do too.

oh..and lastly,don't forget to seed guys,the longer u seed ,more people will be able to download."
