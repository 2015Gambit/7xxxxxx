Notes:   This is a VERY hard cd to locate ! It was one of the first compact disc releases from a country that doesn't produce many bootleg releases to begin with !

Tracks 1 - 12 are from the 6PM show , remainder is the 8PM show !

This is a duplicate of the import cd "Hot And Tight" from Flashback  

With covers! Enjoy!
