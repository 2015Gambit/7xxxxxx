11.   2000s IN MUSIC  (the decade of 2000-2009)

         In North America and  Europe  pop and dance music subgenres, such as dance-pop, teen pop and bubblegum pop, have remained popular throughout or in parts of the decade. Similarly to the 1990s, hip hop and contemporary R&B also remained highly popular genres throughout the decade. Despite the hip hop dominance which lasted for the decade, rock music was still popular, notably alternative rock, and especially genres such as Post-grunge, Nu metal, pop punk, emo, 
       Despite a slight slip of popularity in the early part of the decade, adult contemporary and country music were still able to find success throughout the 2000s. Electronic music was also highly popular throughout the decade; at the beginning of the 2000s, genres such as trance, chillout, house, indietronica and Eurodance (in Europe) were popular, yet, by the latter end of the decade, dance-oriented forms of electronic music, such as synthpop, electropop, Nu-disco and electro house had become popular. By the end of the decade, a fusion between hip hop and electronic dance which had originated in the 80s, known as electro hop, also became highly popular.
      In Latin America, Latin pop music remained popular throughout the decade. Reggaeton became a definitive genre in 2000s Latin music, as well as salsa and merengue. Subgenres fusing Latin music such as merengue and reggaeton with hip hop and rap music became popular from the mid-part of the decade onwards.
     Unlike many past decades, the 2000s did not see the creation of as many new genres, with the exception of a few indie-related genres such as emo rock and post-indie

12.05.	CONTEMPORARY R&B (2000 â€“ 2009)

          By the 2000s, the cross-pollination between R&B and hip hop had increased to the point where, in most cases, the only prominent difference between a record being a hip hop record or an R&B record is whether its vocals are rapped or sung. Mainstream modern R&B has a sound more based on rhythm than hip hop soul had, and lacks the hardcore and soulful urban â€œgrindingâ€ feel on which hip-hop soul relied. That rhythmic element descends from new jack swing. R&B began to focus more on solo artists rather than groups as the 2000s progressed. As of 2005, the most prominent R&B artists include Usher, BeyoncÃ©  and Mariah Carey whose music often blurs the line between contemporary R&B and pop.

12.06.	SOUL, NEO-SOUL &  HIP-HOP SOUL    

        Most people like and appreciate at least a little classic Soul: artists like James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye and Ray Charles all have enduring legacies that have lasted for decades. Even today, all around the world, classic Soul is as popular now as it was during its early days back in the 1960s. But although there are plenty of Soul legends, there are also plenty of contemporary artists keeping the legacy of the art form alive. Anthony Hamilton, Mary J. Blige and others are among the deep, gritty soul artists who are among today's best.

           Neo soul is a term coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s.  According to music journalist Greg Kot, musical collective Soulquarians with members from Philadelphia, New York, Detroit, Richmond, Brooklyn, Chicago, Dallas, and Oakland., contributed significantly to the neo soul movement during the late 1990s to the early 2000s. The founding members of the collective are Ahmir Thompson a.k.a. Questlove from The Roots, D'Angelo, James Poyser, and J Dilla. Being a collective, they included a rotating list of members, including Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Q-Tip, Erykah Badu, Bilal  and Raphael Saadiq.
         During the early to mid 1990s, the neo soul movement continued to grow with releases by ZhanÃ©, Groove Theory, Joi, Tony Rich, and Me'Shell NdegÃ©Ocello.  Other  neo soul artists broke through with their debut albums, including Macy Gray, Angie Stone, Lauryn Hill and Jill Scott.  The 1997 film Love Jones capitalized on neo soul's success at the time with its soundtrack album, which impacted the Billboard charts and featured artists such as Hill, Maxwell, The Brand New Heavies, Me'Shell NdegÃ©Ocello, Groove Theory, and Dionne Farris.

           Hip hop soul is sub-genre of contemporary R&B which fuses R&B, neo soul and dance elements with hip hop. The term did not originate until the promotion for Mary J. Blige's debut album â€œWhat's the 411?â€  in 1992 when Uptown Records proclaimed her to be the "Queen of Hip Hop Soul" and generally describes a style of music that blends soulful R&B singing and raw hip hop production. The genre served as a middle point between two other hip hop/R&B blends, new jack swing and neo soul, and while it was most popular during the mid-1990s with the "Queen of Hip Hop Soul" Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, and Aaliyah, it still finds popularity with newcomers such as Ashanti, BeyoncÃ©, Aaliyah, Alicia Keys, Keyshia Cole and Amerie.

          Smooth jazz is a genre of music that grew out of jazz fusion and is influenced by R&B, funk, rock, and pop music styles (separately, or, in any combination). In general, a smooth jazz track is downtempo, layering a lead, melody-playing instrument (saxophones â€“ especially soprano and tenor â€“ are the most popular, with guitars a close second) over a backdrop that typically consists of programmed rhythms and various pads and/or samples 
      .  Smooth jazz groups or recording artists tend to play their instruments in a melodic fashion such that they are recognizable within just a few measures; this category includes names such as saxophonists Kenny G, David Sanborn, the late George Howard, Najee and Art Porter, Jr.; guitarists George Benson, Marc Antoine, Peter White, Johnathan Butler, Ray Parker, Jr, Norman Brown, Ronny Jordan, and Yves Vincent; pianists Joe Sample, David Benoit, and Bradley Joseph. Some performers, such as Dave Koz, Bob James, and Nathan East are notable for their numerous collaborations with many of the genre's big names. Groups include Fourplay, Pieces of a Dream, Acoustic Alchemy, Airborne and The Rippingtons. Female performers include Keiko Matsui, Joyce Cooling, Mindi Abair, Candy Dulfer, Sade, Brenda Russell, Pamela Williams, Regina Belle, and Anita Baker.

12.10.   REGGAETON ,ROMANTIQUEO, KUDURO & ETHNIC MUSIC  

            Reggaeton is a form of urban music that became popular with Latin American youth in the early 1990s. After its mainstream exposure in 2004, it spread to North American, European and Asian audiences. Originating in Panama, reggaeton blends West-Indian music influences of reggae and dancehall with those of Latin America, such as bomba, plena, salsa, merengue, latin pop, cumbia and bachata as well as that of hip hop, contemporary R&B, and electronica.
           Ethnic music, especially in near tropical locations is mainstream for most of the mid to late '00s, especially with hits by Shakira and M.I.A. and the rise of  Reggae/Pop/Dance artists like Sean Paul, Sean Kingston and Rihanna early in the mid to late 2000s.
          Romantiqueo is a sub-genre of Reggaeton. It is a fusion of Pop, R&B, and Reggaeton. The name Romantiqueo comes from the words "romantic" and "mixeo" (Puerto Rican slang for mix).  Zion y Lennox are considered to be the pioneers of Romantiqueo. Magnate y Valentino, Tito "El Bambino", De La Ghetto, Randy, Don Omar, Divino, RKM & Ken-Y, Cruzito and Baby Rasta are among those who have made a name in the genre.
         Kuduro (or kuduru) is a type of music originally born in Angola in the 1980s. Reinvented in Portugal, the genre gained international popularity. It is characterized as uptempo, energetic, and danceable.

11.11.	 AMERICANA  -  ALTERNATIVE COUNTRY MUSIC 
       
            In the 1990s the term alternative country ( or americana)  paralleling alternative rock, began to be used to describe a diverse group of musicians and singers operating outside the traditions and industry of mainstream country music. It has been used to describe country music bands and artists that have incorporated influences ranging from roots rock, bluegrass, rockabilly, honky-tonk, alternative rock, folk rock, and particularly punk. It is generally agreed that alternative country drew on traditional American country music, the music of working people, preserved and celebrated by practitioners such as Woody Guthrie, Hank Williams, and The Carter Family, often cited as major influences.   Another major influence was country rock, the result of fusing country music with a rock & roll sound. Some of the significant artists in the genre are: Dave Alvin, Neko Case,  Justin Townes Earle, Alison Krauss amd  Gillian Welch .
