The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, 
released in March 1973. It built on ideas explored in the band's earlier recordings and live shows, 
but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their work following the departure 
in 1968 of founding member, principal composer and lyricist, Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moons 
themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by 
Barrett's deteriorating mental state.

The suite was developed during live performances and was premiered several months before studio 
recording began. The new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios 
in London. The group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack 
recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesisers were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of 
recorded interviews with the band's road crew and others provided the philosophical quotations used throughout 
Engineer Alan Parsons was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, and 
the recruitment of non-lexical performer Clare Torry. The album's iconic sleeve features a prism that 
represents the band's stage lighting, the record's lyrical themes, and keyboardist Richard Wright's request 
for a "simple and bold" design.

The Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for one week. 
It subsequently remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988, longer than any other album in history
With an estimated 50 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the 
best-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered in its 
entirety by several other acts. It spawned two singles, "Money" and "Time". In addition to its commercial success
The Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently 
ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.
