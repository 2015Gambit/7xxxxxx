,doslucky,2012-03-01T04:33Z,"Is it just me or does the sound appear to be off by a few seconds on this one?

Also, to those confused about the change in downloading torrents, it's because TPB changed to using magnet links exclusively. Clicking a link should generally start up your torrent client and begin downloading right away, however your internet browser may have a security feature where you'll need to allow it to use the magnet protocol. You can google more info on this if you're still weary."
,gamert1,2012-03-01T08:13Z,"@Speedyblonde69, piratebay doesnt have the DOWNLOAD torrent function at the moment, when you click GET THIS TORRENT it opens up a magnet link, what that is, is a direct link to your torrenting program which just opens it right away as if you had downloaded the actual torrent.

@Everyone having problems with external protocol, you need to upgrade your torrenting program to enable the newer magnet links."
