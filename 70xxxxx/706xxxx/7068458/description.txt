  Concert:   Again a very entertaining show with interesting song line up. Elvis was in a good mood and enjoyed his time on stage. The audience was thankful for fine renditions of That`s All Right, Hurt, My Way or the incredible Release Me. Well done, Elvis !! (Ciscoking)   
   
With covers! Enjoy!
