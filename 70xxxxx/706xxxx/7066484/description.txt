What's new in Version 1.1
New game update â€” Bejeweled now has Butterflies!

No, the game isnâ€™t nervous. It has a fascinating new game mode! Butterfly gems appear at the bottom of the board and move up a space every turn. The hungry spider at the top of the board is waiting to catch any butterfly it can â€” so youâ€™ll need to match butterflies or use special gems to free them. How many butterflies can you save?

Butterflies mode tips:
Â· Don't waste moves matching butterflies that are already aligned to match up.
Â· Try to match as many butterflies as possible in one match for a super score combo!
Â· Take your time and think it through, Butterflies will test your powers of forethought to the maximum of your ability.
