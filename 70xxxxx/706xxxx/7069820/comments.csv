,anonist,2012-03-04T15:45Z,"This app made me shit my pants. Installed and checked i got warnings that my fan was overheated critically - 67 degrees. I had critical failure on the logic board. Critical failure on Hd - no space for OS left. The imac 27 is 2 months old....

Well - I checked with Apple hardware test and the temperature was only 40 degree Celcius. No failure what so ever on any hardware. Checked with apple disc repair utility - nothing wrong. Checked with Cocktail - nothing wrong. Checked wit a lot of other relevant software - no failure detected.

On the other hand - a windows virus in called xScan312. A coincidence??????

Thx polisdavid for your sharing. This app was fast deleted and I will not recommand anyone to install it...."
