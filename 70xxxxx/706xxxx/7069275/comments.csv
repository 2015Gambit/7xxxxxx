[V],spastik64,2012-03-01T20:10Z,"@ c3copd

waste of time... ? for you"
,c3copd,2012-03-02T10:20Z,@spastik64 fair point sorry
,zahur,2012-03-06T12:41Z,"Thanks Spas, for wasting YOUR time providing this for us - much appreciated!"
,zandbak,2012-03-22T18:08Z,why to drown us in technicals terms and forget if its an AVI or an MP4 ? Its not wise to do not indicate that...
,urje69,2012-04-12T05:02Z,"why cant people learn to click on the ""Files"" to see what file type a video is, rather than take the time to complain?  It took more time to type that complaint about it being an mp4 file than it would take to click once on ""Files"" and see its mp4. lol."
[V],spastik64,2012-04-13T14:28Z,"Ppl, only with see the name of the release you can know what format is: 

XviD: AVI

x264: .mp4 and 720p

would be redundant"
