I just grabbed the torrent from this page on my other computer but when I bring it up here, less than a minute later, no more torrent link. It's gone on the other computer now, too. They all disappeared from the site after the first time I clicked to download one tonight. The ""download torrent"" link appears with new posts but vanishes almost immediately."
