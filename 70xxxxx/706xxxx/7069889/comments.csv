1. If I'm using a different client there's a lower compabillity.
2. Main reason - If I'm in a different country there's a super low chance for the magnet download to work.
And of course it's a blank torrent for me. With nothing inside a.k.a it's NOT WORKING!"

They might not be as good as torrent files when you need to connect; but other than one taking about 20 minutes to connect, i've had no real issue. Though i'd like to be able to select what i want to download before i start downloading..."
