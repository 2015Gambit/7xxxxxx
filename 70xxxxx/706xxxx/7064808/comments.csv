,hassemac,2012-06-14T12:42Z,I made a mistake and tested just to install InDesign to find out if it worked. It worked out fine but now I cannot install the other programs in the collection. During the first installation process it stops after running on a problem (contact Adobe...). I have a feeling that the activator blocking has something to do with it. Is there anyone having any idea what to do?
