From the team that brought you Thumpies â€“â€˜game that reinvented the rhythm genreâ€™; here comes one of the most original games this year. Burn the Rope is a unique game for the pyro in all of us. All you have to do is feed the fire! 

Burn the Rope is a challenging game where you try to burn as much rope as you can in each level. Thereâ€™s a catch! The fire only burns upwards, leaving you to rotate the puzzle to keep your flame alive! 

As you progress through the levels, youâ€™ll encounter bugs crawling along the rope. Different bugs have different reactions to the flame. For example, the ant changes the color of the flame so you can burn different colored ropes, and the spider shoots out a web bridge so you can access parts of the level that you could not before. 

Burn the Rope is incredibly fun and addictive. You will actually feel like youâ€™re burning a rope, yet thereâ€™s no need for a fire extinguisher!
