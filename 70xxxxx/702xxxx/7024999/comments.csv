,Khagrazim,2012-02-11T16:30Z,Apparently this doesn't work with Windows 7 32 bit. 0xc0000005 error. Anyone found a solution? Compatibility mode(s) doesn't seem to work.
,Tilaisuus,2012-02-11T16:31Z,Same error here. Says the fault is in skidrow.dll.

,klord2010,2012-02-12T09:51Z,"whatever you say, it's not working for many people including me. we want to play this stupid game. nao. skidrow help us!"
,Keibunko,2012-02-13T10:10Z,"I haven't downloaded this or installed it, but most errors involving Windows 7 (I'm using a 64bit version) that can't be resolved through granting normal program permissions (ie run in Admin mode or with compatibility) can be solved by disabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on that specific exe.

My posts never work when I include links, so google disabling dep + windows 7. You *never* want to do a full-on disabling of DEP. It's there for a reason.

Failing that, I find that sometimes copying troublesome .dll files into the same folder as the executable sometimes solves problems as well."
,klord2010,2012-02-13T11:34Z,"@Keibunko
I got full admin rights and DEP is disabled entirely. nope, not in this case. skidrow's securom bypass or emulation thing doesn't work correctly for many of us. for further information, google bonecraft + skidrow.dll.

and btw I think DEP sucks. use 3rd party security solution instead."
[V],alexisthebest,2012-02-13T22:56Z,"try the new crack

https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7029197/BoneCraft.PROPER.CRACK-RELOADED_%5BALEX%5D"
,Keibunko,2012-02-13T23:08Z,"Well, I installed the game straight up and used the crack. Works fine for me, aside from the issues associated with the game because the coding seems to be terrible in general.

Sometimes a registry cleaning helps with errors such at the one being reported.

I'm running it with full admin privs and compat for XP SP3."
,Seancpconn,2012-02-15T03:02Z,"Anyone having problems with the crack, try the one posted above. I was having problems with windows 7 32 bit and couldn't get it to work, his crack did it.  "
,dm619,2012-02-15T23:04Z,it ask for serial number does anyone have it? or is that what the crack is for
,PoppaChubbie,2012-02-16T18:59Z,"Works perfectly on Win7 x64 using the supplied crack. Game itself blows. Thanks anyway for this one uploader and fellow seeders, I appreciate the chance to check it out."
,Sinister.,2012-03-24T02:38Z,Works alright for me. No crashes thus far. Will come back if there are any problems. I'm using Wind7 Prof. x64.
,Sinister.,2012-03-24T03:51Z,Game has no problems other than it makes me wanna hurl. The game play makes me dizzy.
,salesman91,2012-03-25T21:02Z,"works great...
but u have to download other crack given but that crack has trojan in it..(kaspersky)
I paused protection then run the program..it worked.
But when u enable the antivirus.it deletes the rld.dll..
And u cannot run the prog without it.

Also game automaticall exit some times in the middle of the game..
I m usin win 7 32bit ultimate."
