,Toadem,2012-02-11T15:03Z,"Why do you upload the torrent as episode 14 but your post clearly states this is episode 16 ? Most of your previous torrents from this show have been like this also.

As much as the upload is appreciated what I dont appreciate is the mis labeled torrents."
,BIGCountry77,2012-02-11T15:58Z,"Toad, if you don't like the way that this guy does his torrents, then I'm sure that he won't be offended in any way if you pack your shit and move on.
All you have to do is download the way that its named, then rename it the way you want.
'don't appreciate it'..show some respect and gratitude for what you get..FOR FREE!!"
,cmlegend,2012-02-11T18:12Z,Another fkn complainer... just download/seed and move the fck on !
[V],psspss,2012-02-11T23:09Z,"tnx

he obivously dont read. cos some scenereleaser
renamed theres wrong dont mean I have to

a special is not part of the main series and should
of been called S02SP00 and so one

E9/E10 were specials.. hence why its pushed 2 episodes forward in the naming"
,eskebe,2012-02-12T02:15Z,"Beggers can't be choosers, but common sense dictates to keep with the correct episode number.  We are all at the mercy of the seeders and posters.

What would suck is if the whole title was incorrect, but ""In the Black"" is the correct episode name."
[V],psspss,2012-02-12T03:31Z,"have a look at the offical site
http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/gold-rush-2011-after-show-videos/

your see the aftershows says to my naming
there is no e16 .... its e14

so perhaps you just need to follow me and have the correct names then"
