Doomsday.Preppers.S01E03.LQWebrip-AnalogueSrc-][ I Hope I Am Crazy - First Segment Only - David Sarti ][ 07-Feb-2012 ] xvid avi

Ok this is all I could find of the 3rd episode (aka S02E02 or S01E02
depending how people are calling it out there)
Im calling it S01E03 to include the preview pilot episode in the season
since it was a lead up and also tvrage has listed it that way.

The quality is watchable but bit better then VHSrip

TV analogue source and over compressed sound
and the top of video was slightly clipped so maybe it
was dubbed of to vhs and the vertical sync was out?? dont know

converted to 640x340 xvid with mp3 audio 1100 bps

this is until or ever a HD episode 3 comes to light maybe when
theres a repeat?

again TAKE it or LEAVE it.. dont want to hear moaners


enjoy and HELP TO SEED!
