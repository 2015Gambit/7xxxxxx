I for one wouldn't buy it, because I am too poor, but I recommend anyone who likes it to support the developer. Realistically we do have to give them incentive to make more releases. Seems like a man of his stature isn't doing too bad thus far. Mr Kok on SOPA: ""This is how stupid this law is. Every cent I own is paid for by copyrights but this is NOT the way to protect them."" Hear, hear.

keep it up.

BTW - most of my FSX addons I use, I purchase, even though I could D/L in PB or other sites like it - just an FYI."
,tornade25,2012-02-10T21:51Z,"When I like a product : say I fly it over 10 hours, I purchase it. I support A2A for their accusim line of products, I bought the Diamond DA20-100 Katana 4X from Aerosoft. Those planes are wonderful. If A2A would try to develop an accusim helicopter it would be a revolution."
,aarque,2012-02-10T21:53Z,"agreed, the plane seems very skittish on the ground, spinning out and darting off the runway. Perhaps an implementation of the advanced flight model I am not skilled enough to operate. Nonetheless, I really wanted a CDF liveried plane, so.."

,bazzelbrush,2012-02-11T05:15Z,162 Leechers?? come on guys... Seed Please. Sucks I'm only at 70% and still sitting. I've tones of seeds for other flightsim stuff. Why so greedy with this one?? give me a fucking brake. Jesus. 
,HarryOne90,2012-02-11T07:14Z,"Stuck at 70.5% seed please, and thanks for all your hard work with the FSX torrents it's much appreciated."

,marick626,2012-02-11T14:12Z,Am I the only one that is getting severe a frame rate drop when I switch to external view for a second time? My fps goes from 50 to 0.2 or something which has never happened before with any other download. Please help.

,aarque,2012-02-14T08:52Z,"jpbaker: read torrent description again, paying particular attention to the first paragraph."
,jpbaker,2012-02-14T16:51Z,"This is a rip, people, copy the relevant folders into your FSX directory and enjoy.
What folders? There are no folders just the files that are suposed to go in the folders, like texure1... texture2 and so fourth, But there just all thrown in the same ZIP. Is there a chance someone can upload it with everything where it should be:) Thanks for your time and help:)"
,marick626,2012-02-15T21:43Z,"@alef1995
