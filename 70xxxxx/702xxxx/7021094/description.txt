With the release of Pierre Gilhodes' Gobliiins 4, I noticed what a small game he wrote even though it has (slightly) more current 3D graphics and thought I would take the opportunity to compile all four of these classic problem solving/adventure games into a single CD bundle for any interested.

Included are all 3 classic Gobliiins games (Gobliiins, Gobliins 2 - The Prince Buffoon, Goblins 3) and the latest (1.4.0) ScummVM emulator on which they run, as well as the new Gobliiins 4 game. Once burned, the CD autoruns as the Gobliiins 4 installer but the right-click menu in Computer or Browsing to the "Classics" folder you can install the old games from the WinRAR SFX archive, complete with icon sets, scanned manuals, and Start Menu entries. The SFX installs to %ProgramFiles% so if you have a 64-bit system you'll have to move them and update your shortcuts accordingly.

Enjoy!
