Scene developer cotojestwtf aka cotojwtf has released a upadate to his YAB (Yet Another
Bypass) tool, bringing it to version 1.4. This tool allows EU, US and AU PS3 consoles on
OFW 4.00 to bypass the 4.10 requirement, and allow access to their network for
downloading, gaming, videos, etc. You can find the current README.
