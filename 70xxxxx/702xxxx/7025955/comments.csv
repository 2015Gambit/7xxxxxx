,NakanoSan,2012-02-12T03:51Z,"If you are wondering where your save files went, it should be in ""C:\Users\\AppData\Local\SKIDROW\102500\Storage"" Just copy the entire contents of My Games\Reckoning to that folder

You will need to create the profile/s ingame again, but your saves will be there after you create it as long as you have the exact profile name."

,pirata_ako_tae,2012-02-12T04:26Z,?
,premiado,2012-02-12T05:21Z,@pirate yes it will work with theta
,NakanoSan,2012-02-12T06:42Z,"@Pirate/Premiado

No, it doesn't. It'll let you launch the game, but if you use this on Theta's version, the game will always nag you to make a profile everytime you launch the game.

Use the Theta update for the Theta version."

,NakanoSan,2012-02-12T18:27Z,"@Premiado
Uhhh, no.

The Theta version lets you play the update smoother, but it doesn't have the DLC.

The Skidrow version has the DLC, but if you install it over Theta it will ALWAYS prompt you to make a new profile everytime you launch it."
,NakanoSan,2012-02-12T18:44Z,"@matel4n this is a hidden folder, so you will need to type it in the bar. Just go to your C:\Users\username then add \Appdata"

no it doesn't bro, it works just fine, never ask me for a new profile, maybe your're doing something wrong dude. This is an awesome game, I'm playing rogue and currently lvl 10 now."
,matel4n,2012-02-12T21:53Z,"@NakanoSan 
thanks mate, works fine. i didnt need to copy my savefiles even. one more question, what this dlc brings to the game?"
,premiado,2012-02-13T00:16Z,"@Nakano,

I can see why your having problem with the profile, as you copied over the whole my games\reckoning folder into 102500\storage.

,leetality,2012-02-15T19:51Z,"I don't get it. I installed the skidrow version of this game, cracked it, played fine. Then I apply the skidrow update, copy crack, save seems to be there but it asks me to make a new profile with each launch. Videos settings are saved but things like camera and sound settings are all reset on each launch too. I tried copying over the contents of my games\reckoning to the skidrow\102500\storage and it didn't seem to change anything.

This is kind of annoying and I'm just wondering if anyone knows what I did wrong. Thanks either way skidrow."

,hybridlord,2012-02-19T06:59Z,Im level 18 in the game did the update and got my saved game back but honestly the dlc sucks my items every single one of them is better than all of the dlc content. If you over level 10 i advice you not to even bother with this update its stupid and dlc sucks
,kapet,2012-02-21T01:44Z,"I Think i found a way to fix the allways asking of Profile name when you put this patch on the Theta version. This will also work to transfer saves, so people that think your saves have been erased, STOP, its realy annoying.

its simple realy

1 - Install the Patch

2 - Play the game and create profile with the same name as the one before, then exit the game.

3 - Go to ""C:\Users\\AppData\Local\SKIDROW\102500\Storage""

4 - If you havent transfered the save games here yet, go to ""D:\Users\\Documents\My Games\Reckoning"", the saves are the ones that have a number and Save after, for example ""964408save0.sav""

5 - Transfer the saves ONLY, dont transfer ""0.profile"" or ""xxxxxx.profile"" to the directory i mentioned in step 3

6 - Play the game"

,VegitoDBZ,2012-02-26T15:17Z,"For thsoe who still can't convince this update to work.

,chuckdm,2012-04-02T05:06Z,"Not to sound like an idiot but...WHY do you guys CARE about the achievements?  Or to rephrase that, you're playing a cracked, single player game.  Achievements in a cracked game shouldn't be reported (if they are you're doing it wrong) and in a single player game NOBODY CARES because ANY IDIOT can earn them.  If the game is BOTH single player AND cracked, then you should NEITHER earn them NOR report them.

So...what am I missing here?"
,neto1977,2012-04-02T19:27Z,"chuckdm: i like to unlock the achievements, its a special pleasure when you can do it in a particular tuff one. I dont care if people see it or not, its for me only.
Dragon Age its a great example of this feeling, i unlock everyone and its nice! If someone know how i can reset the achievements, i will be very thankfull.
Sorry for my bad english. Cheers!!!"
,wymm666,2012-04-03T13:42Z,"@chuckdm because that's what achievements do, they give you pleasure in having accomplished something. Also my particular problem is not the achievement themselves, rather... I'd like to connect to my EA account so I can access the special items from playing the ME3 and KoA demos.

again, I'd just like to get the demo items.

I complained about the achievements earlier because the two problem are connected in that there's already an EA account associated with this download."

,chuckdm,2012-04-10T07:13Z,"@wymm666 well I suppose I understand...still seems strange to me.  If you beat the game, you beat the game.  If you beat it with a bit of flair and go out of your way to make every kill extravagant, again, sounds great.  But frankly some of the achievements in these games are pretty damn ridiculous.  I think there's one for reading every last word in every book in Skyrim.  Why ANYONE would do that I cannot fathom, but eh, your call.

As to your DLC issues, since you're here on the bay, why not grab one of the many DLC unlocking cracks?  If I understand it correctly, the Chakra Launcher isn't usable in ME3 multiplayer anyway, so since you can only use it offline, might as well just grab one of the ME3 DLC unlockers.  Problem solved.  I'd point you to it but honestly I had to try 3 of them before I found one that unlocked everything and after the ME3 ending I've uninstalled the whole game.  That said, the Raptor Sniper Rifle + Chakra Launcher can take down pretty much anything in ME3, so it is worth your time to get it.  Good luck."
