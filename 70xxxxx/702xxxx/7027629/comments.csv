,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-14T09:49Z,"Hi wmi ! Not true, nothing is the same when legends like you are gone. You are fondly remembered and missed. Like all good old time legends: T-W-O, Ratt101, Sanfandaman, Gothica79, Tikibob (just to name a few) and also lately fault3 - he had good humor. Remember lines like: ""Seed or Putin will visit you at night!"". Memories, memories... the older you get, just more memories."
