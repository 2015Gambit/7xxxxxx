Plot:

While Jo (Roberts) is chained down in a dead end supermarket job, her friends are 

all out on their own separate adventures: Cassandra (Egerton) is jetting off to 

New York to meet her Internet boyfriend; Kerrys (Warren-Markland) is on a one 

woman crusade fighting for female liberation and Shannon (Lovibond) is on a one 

way trip to meet her maker. But a chance encounter with some diamond thieves sends 

their separate worlds on a collision course with not only each other, but fate 

itself. These 4 girls are about to have 3 days they will never forget, spanning to 

2 cities. That is ... if they survive.
