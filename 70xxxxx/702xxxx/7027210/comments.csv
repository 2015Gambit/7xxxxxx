,expometty,2012-02-14T09:08Z,"Nope, it is season 7."
,dlarrym1111,2012-02-14T22:24Z,"No, @Hitech411, it IS NOT season 8!!!!!  

IT IS SEASON 7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Not sure what is throwing your count off?

Goto the ""Family Guy/American Dad"" fan site (the official site) and ALL will be reveled.  You can order the Retail DVD's of each season and you will see that Seasons (1 to 6) are available now.  The site even states in simple terms that season 7 will be available after the season is over. The last episode of season 7 is due to air sometime around April of this year (2012).

If there are episodes for season 7 that haven't aired, ask yourself, how is it possible to be season 8 (as you claim)?

LASTLY, Do you think you are more knowledgeable of what is happening with the production of this show (AMERICAN DAD) then Seth MacFarlane???

ALL these FACTS are available from several web sites if you take a few minutes and look."
