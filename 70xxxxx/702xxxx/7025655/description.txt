Amazon: Singer/songwriter Tom Russell returns with a powerful follow-up to his acclaimed 2009 album Blood and Candle Smoke. Co-produced by Russell and keyboardist Barry Walsh, and recorded in Tucson, Texas, Nashville and Los Angeles, Mesabi features contributions from Calexico, Van Dyke Parks and Lucinda Williams, the last of whom guest on a cover of Bob Dylan's "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall".

A consummate storyteller, Russell has amassed a devoted following that cherishes his vivid, novelistic tales evoking the spirit of the American experience in tighly constructed, panoramic vignettes. Among his most ardent fans are fellow artists; Johnny Cash, Doug Sahm, k.d. lang, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Iris Dement, Dave Alvin, Joe Ely, Ian Tyson, Nanchi Griffith, and Guy Clark have all recorded Tom's songs.
