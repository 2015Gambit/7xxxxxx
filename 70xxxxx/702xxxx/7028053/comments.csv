,volvogangster,2012-05-12T11:30Z,"Library seems to work pretty well, although i get an error with CD 4, maybe i have to reinstall but for now it works very well. Thank you very much."

,adamalbo,2012-06-02T16:31Z,hey is there any serial ? help
,eggsalad,2012-07-11T03:33Z,"Yeah, I'm having trouble with the seriel too.

Can anybody here help us out? I didn't waste fucking 45gb of internet cap downloading something I cant use."
,eggsalad,2012-07-11T03:41Z,"Ok, I'm seriously not happy. I just downloaded 45GB using my limited data cap and what do I get? I get a DEMO. No keygen or serial included. Very unhappy, unless there is a FAX posted here I would NOT download this torrent.

Just because it's on the pirate bay it doesn't mean it works, apparently. "
,eselet,2012-07-24T09:22Z,Don't download!  it does not work
,jimmay,2012-08-05T05:53Z,"Everyone complaining that this is in demo mode needs to delete this ASAP because you clearly have no idea what you're doing here and you're handling some expensive software.

You need a properly cracked Kontakt 5 for this to work. If you don't know what I mean, start saving up and just buy it."
,whiterhino7,2012-08-27T22:10Z,Maan these 5 discs have just been crawling at between 2-12 kb/s for days now...
,whiterhino7,2012-08-29T06:28Z,"Alright they're starting to quicken up the pace, seeding so things should speed up now..."
,dordz,2012-09-04T07:48Z,pls seed!!thnx to the uploader. 
,whiterhino7,2012-09-07T20:05Z,"Hey I'm on a Mac OS X 10.6.8, and DVD 4 right now is rather useless; Can't open the packages and it also stops the download from continuing once it reaches DVD 4, leaving us with 33gb of samples.  Can anyone help?"
,whiterhino7,2012-09-07T21:39Z,"I believe all we're missing is half of the 16 bit library, which isn't a big deal if we have the whole 24 bit library, however if anyone figures out how to extract 41 gigs from these 5 iso's on a Mac, post how you did it please!"
