NOTES:

Sources:

Video - thanks to our p76 friends for sending us the video :) ....the new video is alot better than the old one,but they also 
had the intro missing so they used that video with the logo in the middle of the screen....only last for 2mins 10 secs then all new video :)
The new video was washed out,colours off,chroma wrong and does contain loads of subs.
Audio - i used the one we had on our old release ....which still had issues with noise and EQ levels.

workdone:

well first off i matched the start and end of the audio off our first release too the video on this one and saved that....was 13sec shorter in 
runtime.
Then i took the new video and encoded it,took 10hrs due to using HQ smoothers to remove alots of noise,also had to increase the contrast alot as
it was washed out.Balance the rgb colours and lower the chroma aot aswell.
Once done i had to sync the audio i saved....was pretty plain sailing except the last 30mins or so where i needed to make 5 cuts alone in that space.
Got there in the end anways so ;-)
Once synced i gave the audio alot more lovin and used noise and hiss removal filters aswell as changing all the EQ bands.

Readnfo:

Well basically to make sure you aware there is subs now and again,non english and when i checked the old release there wasn't any for them...and fack if
i was using a google translate to make some :lol: ...honestly their not needed.
Also there is roughly 13 secs missing ....these are mainly on the joins ( old release,which audio we used ) so tried to hide them the best i could,and also
the last 30mins where i had to make them cuts there was like 1-2 secs missing if that,but enough to make it oos....which we fixed.


Overall alot better than before,but still not the best cam .....v7 a6.5 m8 IMHO
