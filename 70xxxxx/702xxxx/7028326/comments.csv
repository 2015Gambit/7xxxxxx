It has some background static to the beat and when compared to other torrents like this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7028295/Katy_Perry_-_Part_Of_Me__2012-Single__%5BNL%5D you can tell that it's lacking.

I suggest you don't waste your time, or download both and see for yourself."

Let me get this straight... You're not only downloading Katy Perry albums, but you went to the effort of creating an account just so you could give a negative review of an actual contributing member's upload...?

The word ""loser"" doesn't even begin to describe you."

His comment was actually pretty useful as it not only informed us of the sound problem but it provided link to a much cleaner version. (Criticism with solution is constructive.)
