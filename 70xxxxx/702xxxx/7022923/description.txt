Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics 3rd Edition
Perfect as a textbook yet excellent for lay readers, this updated edition 
builds a positive case for Christianity by applying the latest thought 
to core theological themes. Wanting to engage not just academics and pastors
but Christian laypeople and seekers, Dr. Craig has revised and updated 
key sections in this third edition of his classic text to reflect the latest
work in astrophysics, philosophy, probability calculus, the arguments 
for the existence of God, and Reformed epistemology. His approach-that 
of positive apologetics-gives careful attention to crucial questions 
and concerns, including: the relationship of faith and reason, the 
existence of God, the problems of historical knowledge and miracles, 
the personal claims of Christ, and the historicity of the resurrection 
of Jesus. He shows that there is good reason to think Christianity is true.
