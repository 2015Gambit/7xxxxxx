â€œSexual Intelligence will help you fire the sex cops who have set up roadblocks in your head, and replace them with some good ideas to ponder and put into action. Dr.Klein has truly given us a helpful guide to authentic sexual satisfaction.â€
Product Description
Enjoyable sex: itâ€™s not about technique or a perfect body or being hopelessly, passionately in love. Itâ€™s about Sexual Intelligence.

In his three decades of working with couples and individuals as a sex therapist and marriage counselor, Dr. Marty Klein has continually seen that although most people say what they want from sex is pleasure and closeness, thatâ€™s not what they focus on during sex. Instead, weâ€™re preoccupied with how we look, what our partner is thinking, how weâ€™re performing, and whether weâ€™re â€œnormal.â€ We do more thinking, worrying, and judging than experiencing. Sex like that canâ€™t thrill us, canâ€™t create intimacy, and canâ€™t, well, feel sexy.

In Sexual Intelligence, Klein shows how to stop observing ourselves during sex, ending our obsession with sexual performance and sexual normality. â€œI donâ€™t help people â€˜functionâ€™ better during sex,â€ he says. â€œI teach people how to relax and enjoy sex with the body they have, the partner they have, in the situation they have.â€ Now thatâ€™s something we all want: fulfilling, exciting sex at every stage of our lives.

In Sexual Intelligence, Klein challenges our understanding of sex, love, intimacy, romance, and satisfaction. After all, sex isnâ€™t just an activity. Change the way you think about sex, and you can change your sex lifeâ€”forever.
