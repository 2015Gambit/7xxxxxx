We're just a five piece band from Tyrol, Austria. We make music we like, whether its metal, hardcore, metalcore or wathever you want to call it. we started the whole shit on the 25th december 06. after some member changes, we now (hopefully) have a constant lineup, so that we can start devastating citys all over the world ;) .. your favourite band . wptfif ... keep it up! .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .... ..
