,darkmoves,2012-02-11T08:51Z,"I have the same problem as LadyEmerald, I get audio only but no video. I am using VLC."
[V],verovenlo,2012-02-11T11:49Z,download the kazaa codec pack works fine on me
,ladyemerald,2012-02-12T15:27Z,"Thank you, I will try that, I have VLC and media player classic, I hope it will work, looking forward to watch the poker league. Thank you for sharing and caring! Have a nice day!"
,ladyemerald,2012-02-13T18:52Z,"Never had that problem before, Vlc usually works when other donÂ´t, I finally got to see the poker league, I downloaded a converter, made the FLV-files into other, but then I found out that ""Real Player"" works as well, only problem the screen is very small. Anyway thank you for uploading poker and hope you upload the rest of the league. Take care, all the best Emerald"
