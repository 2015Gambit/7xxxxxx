,serpentpan,2012-02-14T00:19Z,Thanks man.
,stabbie2,2012-02-15T01:41Z,ChatChitto. Unlike the rest of the posers you come through again. Was dissapointed the other day when I didn't see a version from you. Tried others. THEY DIDN'T WORK! As usual. Disease free and perfect crack. You're the bomb!
,b2driver,2012-02-18T00:09Z,"Excellent! 
Thank you!"
,mikeos2,2012-02-25T12:56Z,What a hero you are!

,tesoterix,2012-03-12T04:52Z,"After I installed the program, I copied & pasted the Crack on C:Program Files (x86)DVDFab 8 Qt. Ran the crack & clicked on ""Automated Cracking 1 (x64)"" then closed it then reopened the DVDFab.  But I still see that pop up that tells me that I have a trial version.  Is that normal?  Sorry to be such a newb..."
