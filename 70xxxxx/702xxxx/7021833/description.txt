Ice Pilots: Season Two
Ice Pilots is back. The hit docu-series following the adventures of renegade Buffalo Airways returns for a second season of nail-biting challenges and compelling stories, featuring the pilots and crew who put it all on the line flying vintage warplanes across the Arctic. Our favourite faces and some new rookies show up for another season of thrills, chills, laughter and their most personal stories yet.

Part 8: Ski Plane
Young pilots AJ and Andrew get the chance of a lifetime to fly the magnificent DC-3 specially equipped with skis to land on frozen strips. Itâ€™s up to Chief Pilot Arnie to guide them in the lost art of taking off and landing on skis as they fly to a remote lake and land on the thinning ice. Meanwhile, tension mounts as Buffaloâ€™s contract for the Mackenzie Valley food mail service is up for renewal, and Rod balances tricky personnel issues with preparing for the arrival of his first child.
