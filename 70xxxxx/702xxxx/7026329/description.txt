Live at the Fillmore â€” February 1969 is a live album released by the American rock band The Byrds in 2000 on Columbia Records. This release was compiled from two performances at the famed Fillmore West on February 7 & 8, 1969. The album includes several songs not found on the group's studio albums.

Recorded less than a week after the release of The Byrds' album, Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, the band line-up on these recordings includes lead singer and guitarist, Roger McGuinn, lead guitarist Clarence White, bassist John York, and drummer Gene Parsons. The album features White's use of the Stringbender device, which he co-invented with drummer (and banjo player) Gene Parsons. The Stringbender allowed White to make his Telecaster guitar sound like a pedal steel guitar.
