,r.trifun,2012-02-15T12:14Z,"Thanks 80z for fulfilling my request. The ballad from R.A.F. that I was trying to find is called Faces in the Windshield, exquisite ethereal keyboards there. The other songs are also fantastic. The other three albums are wonderful early 80s gems, thanks for sharing that as well. Cheers."
,white_arcades,2012-02-16T11:10Z,"Luba, tremendous stuff, one of the most memorable contributors to the 9&1/2 Weeks soundtrack. I keep hoping one day they'll release Jack Nitzsche's wonderful score to that film. That's one 80s rarity no one has. Thanks for these anyhow Dan, you've produced the goods yet again "
,robssbmw,2012-03-05T08:03Z,"Thanks 80zforever, for Spot. After a couple of listens, it is still a mediocre album. Not a patch on Goonhillydown.
RAF was good though.
As a request, Do you have Jo Jo Zep - Cha from 1982. 
I bought the 12'' of the lead single, Walk On By, at the time, but have never heard the entire album.
Thanks again for your hard work, Rob"
