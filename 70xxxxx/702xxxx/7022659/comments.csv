,Phatfish,2012-02-11T08:52Z,"Spoiler alert!

His foot was infected the whole time..."
,okungnyo,2012-02-12T01:26Z,"To any lucky soul who is reading this:

Do not download this torrent. It claims to be a BRRip yet its resolution is only 640x272 and its size is 698 MB.

Download this torrent instead: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7025912/Puss_in_Boots_(2011)_720p_x264_-_550MB_-_YIFY

Its resolution is twice this one, at 1280x544, and its file size is smaller 550 MB.

I know some of you are thinking, how does that work? How is that possible? Surely some quality is sacrificed?

And I swear to you, that it is 100% legit. YIFY is the best."
,nhughes5,2012-02-12T04:28Z,Nice Rip. A10/V10. Not HD but very nice anyway. Thanks.

,Zetta2r,2012-02-15T18:47Z,"Torrent is great, UT DONT READ THE COMMENTS.

One of them spoil the movie. I just read ""spoiler alert"" and saw the comments."
,tails04,2012-02-25T06:36Z,What kind of an asshole writes a spoiler like that.. For fuck sakes.. people like you should be stripped naked.. burned with cigarettes but a 500 pound man smelling of B.O.. then dragged through town but their big toe... Have both of thier ears chopped off.. then tied to a peice of rope.. Then they should slowly get whipped with the ear rope until they die of stravation.. or bleed out.. whatever comes first.

,makka1811,2012-03-04T02:22Z,"Just Started To Download This, Will Seed For A Bit Afterwards =]"
,EF_YOU,2012-03-04T20:48Z,There is nothing I hate more than spoilers...If Phatfish would have said that in front of me I would have punched him so hard in the mouth I would have broken all his teeth and popped his lips...F>A>G!
,KatieBaer,2012-03-04T22:45Z,"Okay.. that was a stupid move from phatty, but the movie has nothing to do with an infected foot.. Just thought I'd let everyone know. It's worth the download, cute. I downloaded from someone else though because I was pissed and thought that guy ruined it for everyone"
