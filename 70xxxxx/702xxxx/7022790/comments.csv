,joshea,2012-03-10T02:06Z,"mdev,

if ur using Îźtorrent or bit torrent, right click on the torrent and click on ""Properties"". And in the new window check the box for Initial Seeding and click OK to close. Now click on file on top and exit. Then open bit torrent again and u'll see that it shows initial seeding again the torrent. This is how you superseed. 

Thx,

,joshea,2012-03-10T10:10Z,"@ mdev,

Hope u've started super seeding now..have reached 71.1%...will not stop the download..I really want to see this movie so will wait till 100% and also seed it  till I reach a ratio of 1:1...

Cheers,
J"

Another thing I noticed is no peers seem to have 100%. If ur seeding then atleast u should have showwn 100%. Therefore. Pls do this to check if the torrent u created compiled the movie completely. Right click on the torrent and click stop. Then right click and select Force recheck. If it checks and shows 100%, then right click and click Force Start. If it shows less than 100% then it means the torrent was not created properly. You'll need to delete the torrent and recreate a new one and publish it on this website. Any doubts, mail me @ jalcanther@gmail.com

Cheers,
