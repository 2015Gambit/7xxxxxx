Crime And Punishment Cover-Trouble.!
______________________________________________

Iâ€™m Sharing this ebook With You , guys.

This may be hard for me to Tell Why ? (I don't know Why) But I strongly believe 

Theresâ€™ Something Pointing Stuff in my mind Or In Other Words I have a Question 

That May Arise In Your Mind too.

As Others I love this Novel too much but My Question is not Abut The Novel Instead 

Its' Abut The Cover Of the Novel.

Well I know I'm Busted here, :)

* WHICH IS THE TRULY CLASSICAL â€˜COVER PAGEâ€™ OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, THAT REALLY 

JUSTIFY THE STORY ??? *

ITâ€™S ALL KIND OF â€˜genreâ€™ AS, DRAMA, PHYSIOLOGICAL THRILLER, MYSTERY, SUSPENCE etc.

P.S. â€”-> well, Thereâ€™s no need to share it with me (If You Don't Want To), just    
                                        heed on it.
