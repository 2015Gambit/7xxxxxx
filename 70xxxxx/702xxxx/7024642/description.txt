          The PRO-53 carries on the tradition from the legendary days  
            of vintage cult synthesizers. This virtual instrument,     
             fashioned after the Sequential Circuitsâ„¢ Prophetâ„¢-5,      
          provides the sonic properties of the unique originals while  
            meeting the practical requirements of the present day.     
                                                                       
          Inspired by the immortal sound of the synthesizer giants of  
          the eighties, Native Instruments created the PRO-53 to cast  
            in software those qualities that have been such a major    
             influence on popular music in the past twenty years:      
             brilliance, power, warmth and beauty. Through Native      
              Instruments' creative development philosophy, these      
          timeless aesthetics have now reached the next step in their  
           evolution. The result is the manifest re-definition of an   
              original that was regarded as unrivalled until now.      
                                                                       
                           PRO-53 â€“ The New Version                    
          With the PRO-53, the third generation of the virtual analog  
            classic is now available. The synthesizer emulation has    
           been vastly improved by a new oscillator technology that    
          offers an even warmer and more brilliant sound. In addition  
            the sonic possibilities have been expanded even further    
             with new features like a high-pass filter mode and an     
           invertible filter envelope. The control surface was also    
                reworked and now shines in a whole new light.          
                                                                       
           Using Native Instruments' highly advanced NSP-Technology    
            (Native Signal Processing) it is possible to generate a    
            software synthesizer that rivals its legendary hardware    
             predecessors. The Native Instruments PRO-53 sets new      
                    standards without denying its origins.             
           What's new: no fixed limit to the number of voices, many    
             more savable preset slots, velocity sensitivity, MIDI     
             automation of all available parameters, an additional     
          effects section, a high-pass filter mode, invertible filter  
            envelope, audio input, LFO-envelope retrigger, and the     
                  option to run several PRO-53s in parallel.           
                                                                       
           The PRO-53 is able to import Prophet-5â„¢ SysEx sound data,   
           which means it can read and accurately reproduce all the    
          existing sound libraries made for the original. The subtle   
            deviations from perfect behaviour, which are typical of    
             analog circuits and crucial to the sound, can now be      
                                  fine-tuned.                          
                                                                       
          The huge sound library gives the PRO-53 plenty of material   
           for all kinds of musical styles: 512 selected classic and   
                  modern analog sounds cover any possibility.          
            64 of these sounds have already been programmed for the    
           previous version by synthesizer legend John Bowen, one of   
           the creators of the Prophetâ„¢-5 synthesizer. In addition,    
              PRO-53 comes with 64 new sound presets, which were       
        specially designed to take advantage of PRO-53's new features. 
                                                                       
           512 preset memory slots are available where you can store   
           your own sound creations. The PRO-53 displays a name for    
              each of the presets, unlike the original which only      
                         displayed the preset number.                  
                                                                       
                                    Effects                            
                                                                       
             A built-in effects unit adds multi-echo and ultra-fat     
           chorus and flanging effects. This makes the sound of the    
            PRO-53 'complete' for both live performance and studio     
           production. The included preset sounds make extensive use   
            of the effects. The PRO-53 also has an audio input for     
           processing external audio signals through its filters and   
                                   effects.                            
                                                                       
                                  Integration                          
          The Native Instruments PRO-53 integrates perfectly into any  
          computer based virtual studio by supporting the interfaces   
            VSTÂ®, Audio Unitsâ„¢, DXiâ„¢ and RTASâ„¢. It can be used as a    
           sequencer plug-in or as a stand-alone synthesizer. It is    
         possible to run several PRO-53 plug-in instances in parallel.
