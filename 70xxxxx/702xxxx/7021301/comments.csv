,ausRoses,2012-02-11T06:13Z,"any 1 know when ther will be a psp quality version for underworld awakening , chronicle & the darkest hour."
,nevier,2012-02-11T21:42Z,"HTC EVO 4g, regular video player, this and chronicles don't work cause there not mp4 format..... Most (99.9%). Handheld devices (psp, itouch, iPhone, Android) play mp4 if your using the stoch video player..... Pls take down these torrents cause there not handheld compatible. "
,StoneBoyTony,2012-02-11T22:51Z,nevier are you blind or that's your name...who you will take down? You have the links for the video players in the description copy and paste it in you browser and you will find your answers so you can watch it like everybody else. First visit my profile and my work that I have posted and then complain. And about mp4 I'm not a big fan of Apple so get your self together and open your eyes.
,nevier,2012-02-12T06:09Z,"Oh wow, still isn't q handheld movie tho noob, you have to d.l. yet another program for your phone just to play your movies.... So inconvenient!!! Do it right or don't do it at all stoneboytony!!!!"
,StoneBoyTony,2012-02-12T21:14Z,"navier I will help you becouse I see your mind is very restricted in expansion of learning. Answer your self question. If you download movie in mp4 or mkv on your PC can you play it in media player? Nope you need a third party program to installl like VLC Media Player.
There you go...now go and suck some
Lollipops!!! "
