The film is the story of three friends - Guri,  
Deep and Sher Singh - who are studying in a     
university and are staying together in the      
hostel of the same university. They do          
everything together - bunking classes, getting  
into fights with a rival group, talking and     
laughing over numerous cups of tea - and they   
even fall in love together. However, the love   
stories of all the three friends turn out to    
be complicated. Sher Singh, who is a typical    
village boy with hardly any knowledge of English
falls in love with a girl who was born and      
brought up in Canada and who talks in English.  
Guri, who has been failing in the same class    
for the last two years, falls in love with a    
girl who has always been a class topper and     
is the most intelligent girl in class and Deep, 
a shy Hindu boy, falls in love with a girl who  
belongs to a family of hardcore desi Jatts. So  
the three boys go through the trials and        
tribulations of love and of college life and    
in the process form an everlasting friendship.
