Piavoli â€™s lyric ode to the cycles of life charts the passages of infancy, youth, maturity and old age against the seasons of the year in the bucolic Lombardy village of Castellaro. The chimes of the clock in the town square punctuate the rhythm of life: birth, the amazements of childhood, the emotional upheavals of adolescence, the first attempts and failures in romance, the dancing, the loving, and the hallmark event of marriage. On that occasion the nostalgia for faded youth unfolds with poetic grace. Inspired by an old Italian folk saying, â€œLove makes time pass, and time makes love pass,â€ Piavoli observes the rituals of human life in much the same way MICROCOSMOS observed the insect world â€™s delicate social universe. Rich in sound and glorious images, VOICES THROUGH TIME evocatively shows "the course of life like a river flowing, without whirlpools, without waterfalls, to let people consider the incessant flowing of things, the unstoppable course of time.
