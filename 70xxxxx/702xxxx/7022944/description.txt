This is William P. Hoar's shocking book Handouts and Pickpockets - Our Government Gone Berserk (1996) which goes to great lengths in explaining the extent of "Big Brother's" power within the American political system. Each day in America, people are conned and victimized by their own government - the very government created to serve them. Handouts and Pickpockets chronicles the shameful, un-American policies and practices of the once-glorious republic, now reduced to an overgrown, autocratic Nanny state. But, even more appalling is Hoar's finding that this decline was not accidental, but planned. 200 pages. A must read for everyone.
