During installation a window pops up and says ' set up cannot findProofing.en-us\Proof.fr\proof.cab. Browse to a valid installation source and then click ok.' and it points to x86 folder. If i click on that nothing happens. Pls guide me... thanx

I think your file got corrupted somehow.
I suggest you redownload it and try again, I don't seem to have any trouble with installing it."
