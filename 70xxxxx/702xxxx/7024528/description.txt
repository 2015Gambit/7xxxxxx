Confessions of an Economic Hit Man: "How the U.S. Uses Globalization to Cheat Poor Countries Out of Trillions"

*This torrent is for a DemocracyNow!(with Amy Goodman) segment featuring interview with John Perkins about his involvement in cheating underdeveloped countries out of resources and political influence.

"Economic hit men (EHMs) are highly-paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. They funnel money from the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign "aid" organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet's natural resources. Their tools included fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder. They play a game as old as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization."
