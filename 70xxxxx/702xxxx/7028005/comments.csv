You introduced me to Conan comics with your uploads and one of the first i read is in my opinion the best....The Island of no return, an incredibly violent comic, i really loved the artwork. I have dlled all ur conan uploads, please which other one do you think is similar to Island of no return?. It is still one of my alltime favs.....thanks"

Soletar:To tell you the truth,I can't even remember Island of no return.There is much of Conan here on TPB,just type Conan in others category and have your fun discovering various Conan titles..."
