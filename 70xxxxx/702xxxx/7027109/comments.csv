,sahilrox,2012-02-13T14:35Z,"TS is not a DVD Version. They just record the cinematic video with little better sound sources. Not all the time, TS Version are better. Sometimes, they can be even worse than CAMs. But atleast this is somewhat better than a CAM"
,sahilrox,2012-02-14T04:46Z,Right
,ItsPete,2012-02-16T22:57Z,Terrible quality for a TS. Not worth the download.

,bryonyg,2012-03-29T02:35Z,"When, in the name of Pete, will people learn to turn OFF autofocus?  Once you've got it focused, turn it OFF.  This will prevent it from trying to refocus every time the screen gets dark or bright.  
Portions are very blurry, camera is too zoomed in, but otherwise is watchable.  If you want something better, go to the theater or wait for it to come out on DVD.

a/v = 8/4"
,Elite84,2012-03-31T23:30Z,"A/5 V/3 Very shakey, out of focus and sound is muffled..... like its been recorded on a cam and then recorded again on another cam..... Poor"
