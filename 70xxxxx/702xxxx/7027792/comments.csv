,BlueTak,2012-02-13T13:52Z,"Neon, can you tell me if these are iTunes/ATV compatible? I've been struggling to find decent sources since HolyRoses stopped."
[V],neon,2012-02-13T14:44Z,sorry i dont know....best thing to do is download the sample and try it out 
,thefan23,2012-02-13T17:52Z,@BlueTak I downloaded both of neon's in time video and they were not capable of playing on Atv but worked on itunes fine.
,BlueTak,2012-02-13T18:59Z,"Thanks. I downloaded this torrent, and both the sample and full MP4 file worked on ATV2.

Also, 7 other samples worked (including In Time), so I will begin getting those full files too.

I'm only getting 'Release Lounge' sources."
,24carmen,2012-02-13T19:01Z,when did Holyroses stop posting new movies ?
[V],neon,2012-02-13T19:33Z,HR is only taking a break...he will be back when he's ready :)
,thefan23,2012-02-14T04:10Z,"No problem. I wasnt to sure if the Release Lounge would work but thanks for letting us know.

A good idea to try out the samples instead of downloading the full movie and it not working."
,thefan23,2012-02-14T04:21Z,I just tried a sample and it would not work on the 1st ATV.. not to sure why.
,BlueTak,2012-02-14T21:01Z,"I've tried several of these on ATV2, they work, but aren't smooth (assume something to do with frame rate?). 

Shame, as they look great quality, and sound good. "
,thefan23,2012-02-14T22:26Z,I believe your right about the frame rate. Still trying  other mp4 releases to test that may work
,BlueTak,2012-02-14T23:59Z,"YIFY seems to be the next best to HR at the moment, although not quite as good, they play flawlessly. (720, not 1080). "
,thefan23,2012-02-15T05:33Z,"Btw thanks for the videos neon. 

I will see if YIFY's 720 videos work."
,thefan23,2012-02-16T19:35Z,"His are smaller files and they do convert to my ATV.
Thanks BlueTak."
,thefan23,2012-02-17T18:25Z,I guess the ATV2 is compatible with the these files. YIFY's movies sync but i dont get and video out on sound..
