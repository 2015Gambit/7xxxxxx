2007 UK single-disc collection from the R&B and Pop vocalist, one of the biggest, and best-selling, female artists of all time. She's broken countless records throughout her career, has had consistent success in music and in film, since her debut single "Saving All My Love For You" in 1985. Her music combined big adult ballads with stylish pop and slick contemporary urban soul and her voice is a benchmark that has not since been equaled. This 18 track compilation features her absolute best hits including 'I Will Always Love You', 'Greatest Love Of All', 'Exhale (Shoop Shoop)', 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody', 'Saving All My Love For You' and many more. The previous Greatest Hits collection was a two CD set that featured remixes and more, but this single-disc collection offers the cream of the crop! Sony/BMG.
