There is more to Uri Geller than his countless "miracles" - and James (The Amazing) Randi tells all in this fascinating examination of the Geller myth.

The Truth About Uri Geller, formerly known as The Magic of Uri Geller, is a 1982 book by magician and skeptic James Randi about alleged psychic Uri Geller. In this comprehensive biography Randi challenges Uri Geller's assertion that he performs paranormal feats. Randi explores Geller's background as a stage magician, and explains how Geller's spoon bending can be easily reproduced by any magician using sleight of hand.

This is the official Kindle Edition MOBI, which I converted to EPUB using Calibre. I tested the EPUB in iBooks on my iPad to make sure the conversion settings I used made it appear the same as the MOBI in the Kindle app. Sometimes Calibre conversions can mess up a book's formatting, but you can be confident that this EPUB conversion is just like the original.
