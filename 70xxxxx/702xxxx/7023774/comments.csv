,phantompilot2012,2012-02-11T11:00Z,"the anime only covers the events in the first 7 or so volumes, so there's a lot more story to the manga. i personally liked it better than the anime but i wont post any spoilers ;)"

The manga is just as amazing as the anime.  The end of the anime deviates a bit from the relative point in the manga, but the anime needed to conclude, so that's to be expected.  The manga still leaves you wanting more, but it also has a good ending that wraps up a few things.  

By the end of the manga I was literally speechless.  I still don't know which ending is better: the anime or the manga.  Both are flawless."
