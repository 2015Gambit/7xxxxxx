Experimental film director Franco Piavoli's Al Primo Soffio Di Vento (At the First Breath of Wind) is nearly a wordless, non-narrative account of a summer's day as appreciated by the residents of an estate in Lombardy, Italy.

The family, despite living in a idyllic mansion, live their lives very much apart from one another. The father (Primo Gaburri) is usually holed up in his study, while his wife aimlessly paces the grounds pining away after a former lover. Of the two daughters, the eldest plays sad tunes on the piano, while the younger explores the woods and struggles to understand her recent inklings of sexual attraction.

The house also provides home to a sickly grandfather, as well as an unknown, mentally unbalanced female relative. Neither the film nor its director suggest any type of concrete interpretation, preferring that the audience filter the film's meaning through their own personal experiences.
