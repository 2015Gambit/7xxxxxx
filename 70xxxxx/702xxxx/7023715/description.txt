Book Description
This book introduces programmers to objects at a gradual pace. The syntax boxes are revised to show typical code examples rather than abstract notation. This includes optional example modules using Alice and Greenfoot. The examples feature annotations with dos and donâ€™ts along with cross references to more detailed explanations in the text. New tables show a large number of typical and cautionary examples. New programming and review problems are also presented that ensure a broad coverage of topics. In addition, Java 7 features are included to provide programmers with the most up-to-date information.

From the Back Cover
No one brews up a better Java guide than Cay Horstmann, and in this Fourth Edition of Big Java heâ€™s created his best one yet. Thoroughly updated to include Java 7, this edition of Horstmannâ€™s best-selling text helps students absorb computing concepts and programming principles, develop strong problem-solving skills, and become better programmers, all while exploring the elements of Java that are needed to write real-life programs.In preparing the new edition, special attention was given to the quality and variety of exercise material- from skill-oriented multiple-choice questions to short code-completion exercises to multi-step lab exercises-offering instructors more ways to engage students at different levels, and providing more practice to students who need it.

A top-notch introductory text for beginners, Big Java, Fourth Edition is also a thorough reference guide for students and professionals alike to Java technologies, Internet programming, database access, and many other areas of computer science.
