I am the original seeder and I have only uploaded 218MB of this 4.13GB file, yet both Pirate Bay and my Bit Torrent software is saying that there are two seeders in the cloud.

Assuming I am one of them how can there be another if I have not uploaded the entire file?

Am I reading this wrong or are these things just inaccurate?"
,jfhjr,2012-02-12T07:00Z,I'd say it's just a glitch in the trackers - hopefully after a few of us grab this they will be seeded better - I will seed them for at least 60 days. Thanks and yes these will be a welcome addition!
,garycarradine,2012-02-12T07:29Z,tnx 4 uploading this. the film that made him a star :))

I have more, but I think it would be better for everyone if I introduced these more slowly.
My bandwidth is taking a huge hit . . . :)
I think I will add a movie a day and only seed what does not have 3 or 4 seeders at least.
I hope other folks can keep these seeding so that I can make a lot more available, I have more than 2700 DVDs . . . I would love to be the guy that makes hard to find classics findable in a great quality as well as quantity . . . but  I will need help. "
,garycarradine,2012-02-12T10:42Z,"oh, no problem about that. :))"
,mysticmerlin666,2012-02-12T11:56Z,These are great classics!Thank you
,jfhjr,2012-02-12T15:48Z,"Auge - Thanks a bunch for these! I love getting the full DVD in your releases and will seed at least 60 days on anything I download. Hopefully others will SEED please, as well!"
,k_p9,2012-02-13T07:25Z,Thank you for this and all the great classics you post!
,jfhjr,2012-02-13T13:17Z,"Hmmm...the largest percentage I am seeing is 98.6% as far as the seeds and leeches go, so where are the 100%ers?? Grab and go? C'mon people it doesn't cost a thing to leave the torrent program open and let others get this too! Torrenters are getting way stingy with the SHARING aspect IMO."

[T],Auge,2012-02-14T05:15Z,"*** PLEASE SEED FOR AT LEAST FIVE DAYS, THATS NOT ASKING TO MUCH AND IT WILL HELP TO INSURE THAT I CAN KEEP PROVIDING THESE DVDS. ***"
