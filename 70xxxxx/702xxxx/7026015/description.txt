Ladies and gentlemen! 
May I present to you, for your reading and listening pleasure, 
the latest and the greatest work, 
from none other than the great philosipher, researcher, 
and most importantly, the greatest plagiarist of all time,
the man; the enigma... Da-avi-id Wilcock!!! 
[Applause]

Wow, what an introduction!
Now of course I'm not David Wilcock, 
but I do have his latest stuff! [applause]

There are two reasons I'm sharing this with you today. 
First, as you all know I believe information should be free. 
Second, most of this latest release is just research 
that has been stolen from various scientists and researchers, 
and presented as the work of Mr. Wilcock. 
Now I don't see why he should make money off other 
people's work, so that's why I'm sharing this 
with everybody.

That doesn't mean it's not good research; it's actually not bad. 
I was listening to William Henry's show Revelations 
(Hypesters, Lies and Mind Control 1-11-12) 
a few weeks ago, and he was pissed!! He said, 
not only did Wilcock steal his material and present it as his own, 
but he deliberately distorted many facts. Henry said, 
...it was so bad, that HE HAD TO KNOW! [that he was distorting it!] 
Henry's guest, Randy Maugans discussed Wilcocks 
"nervous breakdown" about a "meaningless, 
trillion-dollar lawsuit" in Dec. He went on to say that 
radio host James Martinez calls Wilcock a "publicity 
seeker and a hoaxer".  Maugans explicitly stated about 
Wilcocks latest work "THERE IS NOTHING NEW 
in this book!" So save your money, and decide for yourself 
about the validity of this book, and what all this fuss is about.
