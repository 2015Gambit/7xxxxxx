,IamSkyrim,2012-02-09T23:47Z,1280x536 = 720p ?
,Alesum,2012-02-10T00:09Z,"@ IamSkyrim

A 16x9 HDTV is a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, but some movies are shot with a wider aspect ratio (such as 2.39:1, 1.92:1, and numerous others). The black bars on the top and bottom fill up the rest and the resolution spec provided doesn't include the black bars. Hence 536 lines rather than 720. This today is standard and for all intensive purposes would still be considered 720p, just as a 1920 X 800 file would be 1080p. It sucks but just how it is, not the uploaders fault.

Thanks for the up BOZX.

Will post A/V once downloaded."
,jsc0420,2012-02-10T00:19Z,"IamSkyrim
YES it is!, including the black letterbox on top and bottom it would be 1280x720. Actual picture size is 1280x536. Why does nobody understand this? I see this question all the time. Vertical dimensions will change depending on aspect ratio the film was shot in, but horizontal will always be 1280 in a 720p video. hope this clears up some of the confusion."
,spifkitten99,2012-02-10T02:09Z,"This movie IS 720p.

It's the biggest resolution the movie can be, and still fit withing 1280x720p.

Therefor, it's 720p.


It's the television industry that have made people not able to understand anything, but exact 16:9. They have sold the idea of 16:9 to people, so now people think that everything must be 16:9, and that 16:9 means good.

They are so obsessed with it, that they would rather watch 4:3 programs stretched to fill the entire 16:9 TV, instead of having black borders, despite that they then will be looking at a distorted picture.

The majority of people can't even tell the difference anymore.

Even computer monitors are almost only sold in 16:9 now, even though it's a shit aspect ratio for a computer screen (if you use it for other stuff than gaming and watching movies).

Now they think that something is wrong with the movie, if it doesn't fit the EXACT resolution of 16:9 1080p or 720p.

,IamSkyrim,2012-02-10T02:11Z,"I see, I'm off to go get a 21:9 tv.

Thank You BOZX."
,IamSkyrim,2012-02-10T02:18Z,"@spifkitten99

It's the fact that we have a hi res picture that is lost on a 16:9 tv, which is the most common hdtv type. I'd rather lose part of the picture on the left and right as opposed to having a 12"" high picture on a 24"" high screen. It's a waste of a big screen on a 16:9.

Cheers."

Sharing is caring!"
,Alesum,2012-02-10T03:42Z,Why do people feel the need to explain the same thing three different ways when it has already been covered? Now how about some useful comments and seeding people.
,jsc0420,2012-02-10T04:09Z,"@Alesum
The first explanation had not been posted yet when I was responding. Didn't know that someone else was already answering the question. Sorry for the redundancy. Thanks to the uploader and everyone who is ACTUALLY seeding. Will comment on quality when download completes."

Thank you!"
,BZRD,2012-02-10T07:13Z,"BOZX always has good movies, but every time I download from him, it takes for ever to download. I can normally download a 4.5GB movie in about 25-35 minutes. With BOZX, it takes me 7 hours. I'm currently downloading at 90 kb/s with a 70 MB/s internet connection. 

If you downloaded this movie already, stop being d*icks and seed. Every movie I download I seed for at least a week, if not more. Help people out as they help you."
,gigahertz21,2012-02-10T09:21Z,"@BZRD

If your internet connection is that fast why don't you get usenet?  You would be able to download everything super fast.  I'm actually downloading this right now off usenet at 6MB/sec, just came here to read some more comments on the quality.

Usenet of course is not free but you only have to pay $10 a month for an unlimited provider like Astraweb or buy a 1TB block from newsgroupdirect for $50.

Anybody that is interested, really good post with lots of info:
