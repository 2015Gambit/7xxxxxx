,sodasirap,2012-05-13T05:14Z,"@adlab979 Noob. For the size 750MB which are meant to be watched on your computer, the quality is awesome. Don't watch it on an 40""  LED screen and throw tantrum about the quality, idiot!

Anyway, A:10, V:10. Thanx! "

,Shtefu,2012-08-25T14:17Z,"@mandarp - Don't download this version of 720p. Download 1080.
For High Definition (which I assume your screen supports) search for torrents with 'full HD'. You will noticed the difference in size."
