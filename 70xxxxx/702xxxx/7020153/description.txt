Survivors: Nature's Indestructible Creatures
Modern humans have been around for some 200,000 years, which is peanuts compared to some of the species alive today: there are creatures that have been with us since the Cambrian age and trees that have barely changed in the last 300,000 years. Natural history palaeontologist Richard Fortey investigates why certain life forms endure..

Part 3: Frozen in Time
In episode three, Fortey looks at the Ice Age. 2.8 million years ago - triggered by slight changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun and shifts in its ocean currents - the world began to cool. Within a few thousand years much of the planet was shrouded in a dense cloak of ice that would come and go until only 10,000 years ago. We call this age of ice - the Pleistocene Age - and it transformed the hierarchy of nature. This is the story of how a few specialist species that evolved to live in the biting cold survived into the present day.
