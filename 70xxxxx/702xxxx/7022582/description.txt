MarcusOrlyius from reddit created complete list of BitSnoop's torrents from the 8th February 2012. The list has been split up by category into seperate files, the URLs removed to save space and then 7zipped.

There are 34 lists, one for each category and each entry in the list contains the info hash and the title of the torrent. If you want more details about the torrent, just go to BitSnoop and do a search for the info hash. Alternatively, you can go to the torrent page directly with the following URL:


And if you don't like BitSnoop, you can just google the info hash and find loads of sites with that specific torrent.

He'll be updating the list on a weekly or monthly basis at /r/BSLists.
