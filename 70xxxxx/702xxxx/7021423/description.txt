Automotive Technology: Principles, Diagnosis, and Service, Fourth Edition, meets the needs for a comprehensive book that covers all eight areas of automotive service, plus the soft skills and tool knowledge that must also be taught. Because many automotive systems are intertwined, presenting all systems together in one text makes it easier for the student to see how they are all connected. Topics are divided into 133 short chapters, which makes it easier for instructors and students to learn and master the content.

Covering each area of automotive service, this book will help readers learn how all of the systems within automotive are connected. Our revised format with smaller sections will make it easier for readers to learn and master the content. Sidebar content provides real world examples of how the content is applied in the automotive service industry. There are also revised photos throughout the text as opposed to line art to help trainees better understand the system and the components involved. In addition, the diagnostic approach to this book helps readers enhance their troubleshooting skills. Perfect for someone just starting out in the industry, this book has a brand new section on Careers in the Automotive Service Area as well as updated information in the section on Tools, Shop Equipment and Measuring.
