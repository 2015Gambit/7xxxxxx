SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Originally planned as direct to DVD. 

The main character, Puss (voice by Antonio Banderas), makes a "P" as his signature; a signature very similar to the "Z" El Zorro makes. Antonio Banderas played El Zorro in The Mask of Zorro and The Legend of Zorro.

Though it broke the box office record of the highest-grossing Halloween weekend gross of all time (previously held by Saw III), its debut was the worst for a Dreamworks Animation film since Flushed Away. However, its second weekend gross gave it the record for the smallest non-holiday second weekend drop for a film in a saturated release of 2500 theaters or more. 

The guard going through Puss in Boots personal things notices he has a small vial of Catnip. Puss in Boots sheepishly explains it is for glaucoma. This is a marijuana reference as many early medical marijuana patients used it to treat glaucoma. 

Puss's catchphrase 'Holy Frijoles' actually means, 'Holy Beans' in Spanish.
