Normally i think Ben Stiller can pull of some kind of funny moments, but in this movie he proved me wrong. This is one of the worst later movies next to ''A Few Best Men''

Thanks for the Upload, Much appriciated!

Are you cereal?  A box of frosted flakes is funnier than any of the false knee-slappers they came up with.  If you found this movie funny, you've lost your sense of humor.  You shouldn't be laughing with the movie but at it.  With the cast involved, the movie should be better.  On the bright side I got a new frisbee.  It says Tower Heist on it"
