Plot:
The film portrays a young jail warden, Adinath, who rehabilitates six deadly prisoners released on parole into persons of virtue.

He takes these notorious, often surly, murderers and makes them work hard with him on a dilapidated country farm, rehabilitating them through hard work and kindly guidance as they eventually produce a great harvest.

The film ends with the death of the warden at the hands of the minions of a corrupt enemy who wants no competition, in the profitable market he controls.

This film takes the viewers through several scenes that set a strong moral lesson that through hard work, dedication and concentration a person can accomplish anything. Also this film explains that if a person focuses all of their energy, day and night, on a worthy cause, of truth and purity, success is guaranteed.
