Rip not made by me. Just spreading the joy, downloaded from UseNext. 1:1 copy.
This movie is almost impossible to find on internet with good quality, i don't think it's fair to restrict this classic to people that can afford UseNext.

Description
----------------
Fritz the Cat and Heavy Traffic helmer Ralph Bakshi subsequently directed the uber-controversial animated feature Coonskin (aka Streetfight, 1975). It recounts the adventures of three African-American men who escape from prison and are later gathered up. In between, an animated tale has animal characters with stereotypically black traits -- Brother Rabbit (voiced by Thomas), Brother Fox (voiced by Gordone), and Brother Bear (voiced by White) -- entering a white-dominated ghetto environment and diverging into different paths; one becomes a crime overlord, the second sells the first out to La Cosa Nostra, and the third establishes himself as a media-exploited sports icon. Completely misread as a racist work upon release, the film actually entails Bakshi's satirical excoriation of bigotry via the tongue-in-cheek use of black urban stereotypes. The director laces the film with profane ghetto dialogue and street slang; though animated, this is not a picture for children.
