Information
At Home with the Georgians
Prize winning author Professor Amanda Vickery sets her sights on the golden age of homemaking - the Georgian era. Through dramatic reconstruction she traces the story of the unique relationship Britons enjoy with their homes, arguing that the Georgians' preoccupation with decor helped to redefine the part played by men and women in British society. Characters from all walks of life including gentlewomen in their stately mansions and servants with only a locking box to call their own, are brought to life as Amanda reveals the artefacts, letters and diaries of the age where the modern notion of a 'home' was born.

Part 1: A Mans Place
In this three-part series, historian Amanda Vickery explores how the great British obsession with our homes began 300 years ago. Using the intimate diaries and letters of Georgian men and women, previously lost to history, she explores how the desire for a home revolutionised relationships between men and women. She uncovers some surprising truths: about the lives of spinsters and bachelors; about how the home became crucial to the success or otherwise of a marriage; and, perhaps the biggest surprise of all, that setting up home in the 18th century was not driven by women (as you might expect) but by men.
