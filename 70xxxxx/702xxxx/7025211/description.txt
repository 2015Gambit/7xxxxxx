Truth to be told Niagara Falls/Buffalo is not a US City only as it also covers quite a bit of Canada, but anyway: Being one of the world`s greatest tourist attractions on the borderline between Canada and the United States, Niagara Falls will amaze you! The scenery comes with unprecedented detail in effects , animations and awe inspiring views.
There are three main helipads in the scenery, the major one for sightseeing flights on the Canadian side, a smaller one very close to the Falls on the US side of the river and a medical rooftop pad on the Women and Childrenâ€™s Hospital in Buffalo. Furthermore the package includes a bunch of International Airports and small airfields in the area in nice detail.
US Cities X is a series of city scenery for FSX that covers US cities created by LimeSim. Based on an extensive aerial image it will have all the major buildings and landmarks plus all the airports and heliports that are inside the covered areas.
It is clearly intended to fill the gap between the default scenery and very high dense city scenery such as Manhattan X, London VFR or Venice X. Because the file size is rather large due to the ground image it only includes one season (in most cases this is not a real issue) and no night textures. The VFR flights over these cities are mostly a day time affair anyway.
