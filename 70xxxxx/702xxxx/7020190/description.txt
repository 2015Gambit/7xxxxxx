You wake up on a rainy night to a bang on the door and thunder. You get up to see a letter in a puddle of water next to the door it`s from your brother telling you that you need to come home that dad has found something of much power and he has gone mad in science he goes on saying that he read some of dads notes saying he has found a way to live for ever and to bring the dead back to life for his bidding I fear for my life and mothers. The rest of the letter is to wet to read. you must travel to the village of Chupa and get in your dads castle there and find out whats going on.
