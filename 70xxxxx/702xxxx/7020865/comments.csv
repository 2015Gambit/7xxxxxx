,tranceaddict9,2012-02-10T02:24Z,UNsplit torrents are much better. Who wants a break in the music?? I avoid downloading your torrents at all cost. Thankfully there's other State of Trance uploaders here.
[T],-inspiron-,2012-02-10T03:06Z,"noooo, please download it, plz plz plz , i can't live if you don't download it, DON'T FUCKING DOWNLOAD THEM, so what !!!! keep your opinion to yourself, no one asked you !!! ppl like it, every week i get some pain in the ass to tell me what not to do !!! come on ppl what the hell is that !!!!!!"
,tranceaddict9,2012-02-10T03:38Z,"Sorry, this is the internet. I believe I'm entitled to my opinion."
,tranceaddict9,2012-02-10T03:40Z,"I still don't understand why someone wants a break in the tracks. Armin didn't spin them this way. When you go to raves, do you request the DJ to stop spinning after each track so he could announce the name of it? Or does he just continue to fucking spin?"
,tranceaddict9,2012-02-10T03:44Z,"I still don't understand why someone would want a break in the tracks. Did Armin spin them this way? Of course not. When you go to raves, do you request that the DJ stop spinning after each track and announce the name of it? No... He just continues to fucking spin like he's supposed too."
,jammuu,2012-02-10T05:45Z,Thank you for doing this every week inspiron. I look forward to your uploads every week. I like the tracks like this because sometimes I don't always want to have to search for a section of a 2 hour mix just to hear one song. Just because he splits the tracks doesn't mean there aren't complete versions available. This is a service. Don't come here and complain about someones hard work each week. Keep it up inspiron. Ignore those ignorant trolls.
,Diddlesq,2012-02-10T09:23Z,"Love your work inspiron, made an account just to say that!

Also I was just wondering whether it would be possible to improve the quality from 256kb/s to say 320kb/s? No worries if not possible, I'm not complaining!

Keep up the great work mate."
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2012-02-10T09:48Z,"Hi Inspiron,

Your ASOT ULs are great & I love them just as you have uploaded for the past many years & also thank you for the covers !!!!

Your work is of great quality & I look forward to many more UL's to come , especially ASOT 550 !!

You can't please everyone so please yourself & let others decide if they want to UL the music, movie or whatever.....

Thanks again !!!

,dravasp,2012-02-10T11:07Z,"It would just be perfect if you upload any psy full on morning albums or split tracks in 320 kbps... Here in Dubai, the psy scene is pretty messed up ! I have been following your page on piratebay since a v longtime... Cheers..."

,l3v,2012-02-10T15:34Z,"I've never noticed any break or pause in the music, that is inspiron's uploads. Always top quality.
So what is that nobody talking about.

inspiron: there will always be some negative comment; just mind your own business, do what you like and provide for this great community (may I name them followers of yours)

Thank you, keep up the good work
Cheers"

,chucky_786,2012-02-15T11:42Z,"Hey inspiron..... thanks alot for the ASOT every week, it really is gud quality and dont listen to what other people say about not splitting it. I love it da way its split. If they dont like it they must download from somebody else...... Thanks again"
,mountainlion2012,2012-02-23T23:38Z,"hey @inspiron i do kinda agree with him i have to merge the tracks to make a podcast for my iPhone.
but i have a fix what about uploading a the split files and the last file being a un-split one. if someone wants only the un-split one they can uncheck all others and vise versa."
,rdb90,2012-02-27T18:46Z,"THANK YOU inspiron!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i wrote this to thank inspiron and his efforts to split tracks . a painful task really..its a breeze to listen and keep tracks that are splitted as also to find them already splitted  by the uploader - A HUGE RELIEF!
Also to people who have commented here about having a whole session together---- GO DOWNLOAD THE PODCASTS MOFOS y come here? "
