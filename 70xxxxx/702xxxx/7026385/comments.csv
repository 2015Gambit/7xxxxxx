,joegreg13,2012-03-01T23:36Z,This was great until the software upgrade. You have to do it Manuel but if you do . It will be messed up . It just sits there and loads over and over again. I take it they know these keys are hot now.

Click the popup and it takes u to the avast site offering it for $19 to redeem yourself and they will overlook u had a pirate version! lmao

cunts!"
