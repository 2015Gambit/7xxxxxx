Information
------------------------------

A definitive landmark series charting the emergence and re-emergence of rock music as a global force, told through the musicians who have shaped this most enduring of genres. BBC 2 takes you on a journey through the Seven Ages of Rock and explores the music that has been the soundtrack to our popular culture and defined each generation since the 1960's. From the producers of award winning series Dancing in the Street, Walk on By, Lost Highway and, most recently, Soul Deep, comes another landmark television history that will chart the story of rock music from the suburb to the stadium, from the crackly '45 to the MP3 download. Along the way, rock's greatest performers, singers, writers and producers tell us how rock emerged, grew, strengthened and gave voice to each new generation. 

2007 sees rock music at its healthiest state since the 1970's. Despite numerous predictions that 'rock is dead', it has survived. Fans are attending more gigs and more festivals than ever before and the guitar is definitely back as the weapon of choice. The UK alone has nurtured a rich new crop of rock bands over the last 5 years, each one building on the solid foundation and heritage of the past, creating a vibrant and promising legacy for the future. 

Seven Ages of Rock will, though the prism of a central wrap-around artist or group, explore a key era in rock. From the UK electric blues boom, via the psychedelic rock of the late 60's; from the 70's punk explosion and on to the rise of grunge and indie rock in the 1980's and beyond, this series tells story of each age through the music itself: breaking down key tracks, getting behind the songs and ideas and providing a social context for the progression of the music. With contributions from some of the biggest names in rock, the series will set a new standard in heritage music television.

Features artists and bands like The Rolling Stones, The Who, Bob Dylan, The Kinks, The Yardbirds, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Police, U2, Nirvana, Oasis and R.E.M.

1)  The Birth of Rock 
The Road to Woodstock - The rock revolution of the 1960s seen through the life and music of Jimi Hendrix. We see how he became the first, ultimately doomed, icon of rock; from delta blues man, Dylan-esque poet and the technological prophet, Hendrix was the synthesis of everything that had gone before him and all that was to come. The Birth Of Rock also explores the influence of rhythm & blues on a generation of British musicians such as The Rolling Stones, Cream and The Who, and how the song-writing of Bob Dylan and studio developments of The Beatles transformed the possibilities and ambitions of rock.

2)  White Light , White Heat - Art Rock 
Between Rock and an Art Place - How rock became a vehicle for artistic ideas and theatrical performance. From the pop-art multi-media experiments of Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground to the sinister gentility of Peter Gabriel's Genesis, White Light, White Heat traces how rock became a vehicle for artistic ideas and theatrical performance. We follow Pink Floyd from the fated art school genius of Syd Barrett through the global success of Dark Side of the Moon to the ultimate rock theatre show, The Wall. Along the way, the film explores the retro-futurism of Roxy Music and the protean world of David Bowie.

3)  Blank Generation - Punk Rock 
A tale of two cities, London and New York and the birth of punk. Each city created a bastard child that marked the biggest and fundamental shift in popular music since Elvis walked into Sun Studios. Blank Generation unpicks the relationship between the bankrupt New York and the class and race-riven London of the mid- s and explores the music of The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Ramones, Television, Patti Smith, The Damned and Buzzcocks.

4)  Never Say Die - Heavy Metal 
The story of the longest surviving and certainly the loudest genre of rock, heavy metal. With no sign of disappearing, metal has been the most controversial and misunderstood of all rock genres. Emerging at the tail end of the hippy dream from the rust belt of industrial England, heavy metal would go on to secure the most loyal fan base of all. With Black Sabbath as the undisputed Godfathers, we follow their highs and lows, and, along the journey, meet Deep Purple, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Metallica.

5)  We are the Champions - Stadium Rock 
Global Jukebox - We Are The Champions follows the development of some the biggest names in Rock in the 70s and 80s, among them Queen, Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, The Police and Dire Straits and shows how, through events such as Live Aid and the rise of MTV, rock achieved a global influence on culture and politics. The film concludes in the early 90s, as U2 effectively brought the era to a close by reinventing the big rock show so completely, that fifteen years later most major rock tours are still pale facsimiles of Zoo TV and Popmart.

6)  Left of the Dial - American Alternative Rock 
The Last Rock Star - The rise of alternative rock in the USA. From its early underground days where bands like Black Flag drew inspiration from the DIY ethos of punk, Left Of The Dial traces the history of the network of fans, clubs and fanzines that sustained the scene and launched the careers of bands like R.E.M., The Pixies and Husker Du. We explore why the bands that emerged from the underground offered an alternative both to the established music industry and the prevailing politics of the Reagan era and why their music resonated with the Generation X audience in search of songs that reflected their lives and articulated their hopes and fears. We'll see how alternative bands began to enjoy greater popularity in the early 90s, with REM breaking into the mainstream charts with 'Losing My Religion', and we'll take a fresh look at the explosion of the Seattle 'grunge' scene, culminating in the success of Nirvana's 'Nevermind' and the tragic loss of Kurt Cobain, an artist whose triumph and tragedy continues to cast an inescapable shadow.

7)  What the World is Waiting for - British Indie 
What the World is Waiting For - British Indie music was once seen as the bastion of the over earnest 'High Fidelity' snob who would sneer at chart success. Often political in its stance, indie was a way of defining oneself in a sea of ersatz pop and vapid chart fodder. Not tied to the corporate dollar of the majors, the indie label was the redoubt against the forces of mediocrity and was a precious source of integrity and honesty. A generation would find meaning in the music of The Smiths, the archetypal indie group of the 1980's. Lyrically adroit and melodically commanding, they would foment a dedicated following around the world. However, they split on the brink of huge success and the identity of indie rock would undergo a profound transformation. From the Stone Roses, the heir manque of the indie music crown, via Suede's dark sexuality and the media saturation of Brit-pop's Blur v Oasis, indie was now a marketing device, ultimately losing any of it's once cherished intimacy and integrity in front of 250,000 fans at Oasis's Knebworth spectacle in 1996. Indie was mainstream. Indie was dead.
But was it? As the millennium dawned, a new cohort of bands emerged to redefine British indie. By returning to its roots in clubs and bars, even front rooms, indie became respectable again. Once again, it meant something beyond a marketing cliche. From The Libertines to Franz Ferdinand and The Arctic Monkeys, indie labels reconnected to their fans, using both new technology and good old rock n roll to inspire and motivate a new generation to ditch the decks pick up a guitar. Rock is back. But for some, it never went away.
