SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Al Pacino was originally offered the role played by Gene Hackman. Warren Beatty was also interested in the movie and producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer went through a long period trying to convince him to sign on, before all parties moved on. 

Quentin Tarantino was brought in to do uncredited "punch-ups" of the dialogue. His major contribution was the comic book bickering. The character name "Russell Vossler" is a reference to Rand Vossler, with whom Tarantino used to work at a video store. See also Pulp Fiction. 

Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer originally offered Val Kilmer one of the headlining roles but he declined. Years later Kilmer noted it was one of the few films that he wished he had agreed to be in. The role offered to Kilmer by Simpson and Bruckheimer was never formally specified. 

Reportedly Tony Scott used four cameras simultaneously for at least a few scenes. 

According to a Don Simpson interview, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise were also considered for the role that went to Denzel Washington.
