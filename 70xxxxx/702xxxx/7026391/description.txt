Take the nephew of Ronny Wood, the seventh son of Keith Richards, 

the neighbor of Jagger and the psychiatrist of Pete Townsend 

and you have a family that the Deadstring Brothers hot. 

The band from Detroit, retro rock\/blues brings change 

in as charismatic frontman with Kurt Marschke. 

To appear on their 6th cd this month is the acoustic instruments, 

pedal steel, piano and Hammond organ swapped by more straightforward-to rocking guitars. 

Very Stones-like!! To avoid confusion: the Deadstring Brothers are certainly not copycats, 

to expertly put together and therefor sticking their songs they are sincere. 

Kurt Marschke sounds then sometimes called as Mick Jagger,
 
the plates of his band are a lot geinspireerder than what the Stones currently do.
