Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, February 9 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with "Sam," an anonymous source in Missouri who worked as a contractor at a FEMA training camp. 

Alex also talks with libertarian political commentator and activist Lew Rockwell, who served as Ron Paul's congressional chief of staff from 1978 to 1982. Rockwell founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama and was its president until the summer of 2009, when he transitioned to the position of Chairman of the Board.

Gary Franchi of Revolution PAC also visits in hour 3.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
