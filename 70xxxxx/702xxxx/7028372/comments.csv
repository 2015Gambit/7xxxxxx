hmm.. It may be that since this GTA SA is modded
u might need to either take out the mods that may be causing the error or u might want to find another torrent.But if u want to take a look at ur mods then rite click GTA SA app, and show package contents/Contents/resources/transgaming/c_drive/rockstar games/GTA SA/and there might be a CLEO file there"
