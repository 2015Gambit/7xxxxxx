and trying to work out how to activate it via the
advance audit controls.. but the others
should be a goer without messing about

i post how to fix sweet hearts if I find out in the comments
later"
[V],psspss,2012-02-13T12:48Z,"ok I got sweet hearts going this is what you need to
do once.

1) once it loads press K once it should
show a audit window
2) press all at same time ZXC and it will add 200
to amt column
3) press K to exit audit
4) press 5 and insert coins
now the buttons will wake up for Y and H keys
to play it

sorry i missed configuring that one in this preinstall
setup

hopefully can get more pokies working and
added to the menu in future release"
[V],psspss,2012-02-13T13:06Z,"actually it doesnt seem that striaght forward.

looks like you have to press K to enter audit
then also press L once to turn on the other light
under neath it.. called jackpot then pres ZXC
at the same time.. if your not on the right
audit set screen.. you can press A to rotate through them.. 

if they not rotating try press M key for door open
and then once set press to close door again

then if you got amt=200 on right and says insert
coin press 5 key and it shpould make insert coin
noise.."
[V],psspss,2012-02-13T14:55Z,"looks like i spotted a problem with enchanted setup
iits set to auto pay out to tray if the win is over 200 credits rather then add to the credit total
no biggy but it can be change in the audit settings

although those tricky controls..
basically Press K and then M then A to rotate
until find max jackpot payout = 200
and use S to select it and D to increade value
to 3000 then exit by rotating back with A
then press K to turn of auditing and M to
close the door and shpould be able to play it again

I will fix this if I every upload a version 2 of this torrent in future."
[V],psspss,2012-02-14T00:25Z,"I found it nicer to also custom the max spin button to also include SPACE BAR.. again you would of thought the emulator/rom developer has done this

Do the following for each game
1) press tab Key
2) cursor down once to controls (this game)
and press enter key
3) cursor down to where it says H or bet 5
4) press enter 
5) press spacebar
6) press H

it should now say space or H

7) press ESC key twice to exit out

8) Test Space bar works

if you stuff up looks like you press enter
then press ESC and it sets it to none

then can repeat

I also see somehow insert cion for enchanted got stuffed up

you will first need to clear inputs for that one
with enter, ESC and then press Enter and key 5
to reset it to default.

then repeat above to see Spacebar

Hope that helps

again will fix this in next update if there is one"
[V],psspss,2012-02-14T03:09Z,"theres a update 2 of this torrent

better!!"
