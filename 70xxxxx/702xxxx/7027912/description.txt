Keys

Spin Size => 1=S 2=D 3=F 4=G 5=H
Bet   Size =>  W, E, R, T , Y

ideal you just press H to spin :)

and press Y once to set to max bet :)

insert coins = 5
Insert Notes = 6

only enchanted forest has insert notes but insert coins dont work on it
rest all use 5

Best to avoid the other keys as they can lock or enter advnace menus

Install

1) install winrar and unzip/unrar the 200mb file to C:\
it will create a folder like Real Aussie Pokies - Mame 32
2) enter the folder mameui32 and make a shortcut of the .exe file
called mameui32.exe to the desktop
3) double click the shortcut.. (note you may need run as admin)

it should start and auto show the pokies games with green icons
(if not enter the favorites folder to find them)

this is made to make it easier for noobs

but you can find more of the games that arent working in
available etc. 

ENJOY AND HELP TO SEED!
