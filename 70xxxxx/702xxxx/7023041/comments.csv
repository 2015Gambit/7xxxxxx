,erroneus,2012-02-12T02:56Z,Pardon my scepticism but a patch that takes 20 minutes???  Sounds like it's doing something other than patching to me.  Let's see the source code of this patch before anyone runs this.  Seriously sounds like something to scour a machine for personal data collection.

[V],polisdavid,2012-02-12T22:27Z,You can try to get the patch (open source) - but I always got an error when I tried it.

If downloading and installing first NeoOffice 3.1.2 from the site (free app.), then installing NeoOffice 3.2.1 from your torrent (the app. being no longer free to download on the site), the app. replaces the previous one in the Applications folder with free patch 0 already in place working to enable launching the app. without other action needed.
