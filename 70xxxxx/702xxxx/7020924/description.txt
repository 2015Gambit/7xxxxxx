German Landmarks is now available for FSX and the new version is extensivly enhanced! CR-Software has added a large amount of objects so there are now over 10.000 objects to enhance your VFR flights over Germany.
Also more than 1.000 different objects like power stations , industrial plants, high-rise buildings, TV towers, transmitting towers, wind farms, castles, locks, churches, harbor facilities and much more. 260 Glider airfields, 80 ultra lights fields and 320 heliports are also added as landmarks and are visible on the GPS. As the runways are adapted to the mesh they will follow the terrain so sloped runways are included.
Features:
 About 2.200 objects added precisely according to the official AIPO from DFS.
 Using glider databases and satellite images another 8.000 objects have been added.
 More then 340 glider / ultra light fields and 320 heliports are available.
 Around 1.000 individual objects were created and other objects taken from the FSX library are used, so a large variety of objects is guaranteed.
 The location of the objects are shown on a digitized maps that can be zoomed in and out.
 The objects are optimized for FSX mesh, other higher density mesh projects have no yet shown problems.
 For slower systems it is possible to reduce the number of objects to ensure a smooth frame rate.

 As a bonus the full FS2004 version is included (but note it is not as elaborate as the FSX version!)
