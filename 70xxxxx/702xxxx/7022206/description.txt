Pink Floyd were an English rock band that achieved worldwide success with their progressive and 
psychedelic rock music. Their work is marked by the use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, 
innovative album art, and elaborate live shows. Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful 
and influential rock music groups of all time. They have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, 
including 74.5 million certified units in the United States. The band were inducted into the Rock and 
Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Since then they have continued to enjoy worldwide success.

Meddle is the sixth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. It was released in October 1971.

The album was recorded at a series of locations around London, including Abbey Road Studios. With no material 
to work with and no clear idea of the album's direction, the band devised a series of novel experiments which 
eventually inspired the album's signature track, "Echoes". Although many of the group's later albums would be 
unified by a central theme with lyrics written mainly by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical 
contributions from each member.

Meddle was produced between the band's touring commitments, from January to August 1971. It was well-received 
by music critics upon its release, but despite being commercially successful in the United Kingdom, lacklustre 
publicity on the part of their US label led to poor sales there.
