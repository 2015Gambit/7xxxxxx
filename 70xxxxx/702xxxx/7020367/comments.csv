Please release this in HD 720 or 1080p.

Thanks for sharing.

Currently Seeding!"
,k3nd00d,2012-02-16T09:24Z,"Since the source is DVD, the best would be 400p or maybe upscaled to 480p. I may try to see how it turns out."
,groove420,2012-02-16T22:08Z,"I'm not sure how much work is involved in doing a 400 or 480 upscaled, but I can say that it would certainly be enjoyed here.
I saw Blade Runner in the theater in 1982, and because of that I suppose I'm biased towards the voice-over, etc. The added scenes in this version are great and help give the movie more ""story"".

I hope that you decide to release a higher quality cut.

I also tried an upscaled 720p encode and it looked nearly identical. so not worth uploading."
