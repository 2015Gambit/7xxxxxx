What is this exactly?   

And what is in your eye's...wink wink 

What does it do as a network testing tool ?
what are you boosting... 'boosters'?  

PoE add on hardware kits have boost connectivity which allows distances up to 3,200 feet or 1km without degrading the signal.  But I'm sure your not referring to that."

,ioncannon,2012-02-13T02:19Z,use utorrent. It works better.
,bo0tzz,2012-04-08T21:07Z,Seeding :) Btw where do I get some boosters (or make them)? I want to test on my own server *wink*
