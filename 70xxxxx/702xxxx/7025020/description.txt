The 2nd set of this King Biscuit Flour Hour FM broadcast was originally all I had recorded on reel to reel and uploaded it in flac format but after some research and digging on Beehive and Wolfgang\\\\\\\'s vault I discovered where to find the 1 set (crucial tracks 1 & 2)as well-even if there are only in 320kb/s! I included them in this torrent of an otherwise lossless complete show radio FM broadcast. Enjoy and SEED!
