The Irving Klaw Classics, Volumes 1-4

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Notorious beauty Bettie Page and other sexy pinups star in this
collection of 8mm shorts produced by photographer Irving Klaw
(aka \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the King of Pinups\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") between 1951 and 1956.  Highlights
include a pair of rare catfight films featuring glamorous women
wrestling in lingerie; a series of fetish films involving high
heels, black stockings and black gloves; and a collection of
provocative burlesque-style dances.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"

Four DVDs of untouched video.  A lot of Bettie Page, a little
Lili St. Cyr, and a bunch of other dames.  Bear in mind that
these are taken from grainy, skippy, ancient 8mm and 16mm films! 
They\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'re mostly black and white but there is a tiny bit of color.

No rar bullshit here.  I wish the knuckleheads that rar stuff
that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s already max compressed would wake up.  They don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t save
any space or bandwidth at all, and who wants to download sixteen
gigs of rar files, then unrar them to watch the movies, but
still keep the now useless rars eating up 16 gigs of drive space
so they can help seed?  Nobody.  That\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s why their torrents die.
No seeders.  The other day I unrarred one and found an .img
inside and had to unpack THAT!  FUCK!  (Please don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t tell me
that VLC will play .img files... I already know.  I just don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t
like it for DVDs.)  It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s much better for everyone concerned to
share the VIDEO_TS folder and that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s what I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ve done here.
