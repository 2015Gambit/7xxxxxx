SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Vera Farmiga who plays the boy's mother is shown wearing her wedding band on her right hand. For Germany, this is correct and an excellent accurate detail. 

Bruno's parents are called Ralf and Elsa, but are only credited as "Father" and "Mother" because that is how Bruno would have known them, and everything in the film is seen from his point of view. 

The character name "Meinberg" translates into English as "My Hill" or "My Mountain". Director Mark Herman is a Hull City supporter and at the time the Hull goalkeeper was Boaz Myhill. 

Although the concentration camp where the movie is set is never actually mentioned by name throughout the movie, we know it is Auschwitz because it was the only Nazi death camp with 4 crematoria. The SS officers are discussing the building's construction in the Commandant's office when Bruno's mother interrupts the meeting. In the book it is referred to as "Out-With" (coming from the P.O.V. of Bruno, who is only nine years old and can't pronounce some words properly).
