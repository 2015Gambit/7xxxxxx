Great uploads, some real good match-ups yesterday... LOL well not Pistons/Nets but the others ;) Thanks a bunch.

,Dr_Maxwell,2012-02-12T06:18Z,"I downloaded this to see what the hype was around this Lin kid. I was thinking it was just because he was the first Asian American to play in the NBA or something but even if race had nothing to do with the hype this guy has a great basketball IQ. I haven't watched a game since Jordan play the knicks, makes me want to hit the blacktop :D

Nepotu thanks for the trouble of uploading this man; the quality was crystal clear so don't fret about people calling you out on 720p. Looking forward to today's Knicks game when you get a hold of it too."
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-14T02:32Z,You're welcome and thank you Dr_Maxwell!
,Sullyvillain,2012-02-17T03:04Z,Thank you for this! I have never watched basketball before but the hype around Jeremy Lin is causing me to.
,jmbsc,2012-02-21T00:48Z,@ Nepotu - Indeed - Lin is a good point guard - he is at the right place and at the right time... The force is definitely with him ;-)... May the Knicks do well and qualify for the post season... You keep well Nepotu!
