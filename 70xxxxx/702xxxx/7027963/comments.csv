,bhutan_6,2012-02-19T14:12Z,I have a 3.2j Wii. I tried the US-NTSC (Wii-GM) and PAL (uploaded by you) version. Both are good copy but unfortunately doesn't work on my system. I would like to try this version. I would really appreciate you or anyone uploading this game scrubbed and in wbfs format. Thanks again.
