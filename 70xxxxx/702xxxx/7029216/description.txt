Determined to avoid another night of driving aimlessly
around Torrance in the Blue Torpedo, Joe and Hubbs set
out on a quest for fine chicks. Their paths soon cross
with Tack, from whom they learn about a pair of foreign
radical chicks hanging out near the Frankie Avalon place.
Over Joe's objections, Hubbs worms Tack out of the deal,
and the pair take a slow ride toward their destiny.
