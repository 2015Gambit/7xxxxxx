,kipenz,2012-02-12T20:41Z,Could we get it in the oh not so mysterious exe file and just the plain ripped Creation Kit files w/ crack instead?
,kipenz,2012-02-12T20:48Z,"Also, does this include the latest mini update to the Kit?"
,rebviruyuy,2012-02-12T21:54Z,"1.sure friend, i will do it as soon as TPB uploading will be fixed.

2. No"
,TheNonPiratePirate,2012-02-29T01:13Z,"Don't download, AVG found trojan horse dropper."
,noobie556,2012-03-03T03:16Z,"i downloaded this. it seems to work. no trojan or anything..but when i downloaded it and i put it in the skyrim files thing.. what happens is that it basicly crashes . i click on it and it says "" MODELS:could not find model Meshes/sky/Atmosphere.nif

""yes to all"""" will disable all warnings for this context"" and i click on yes to all..but then it just keep popping up the same message . and if i click on  no i get asked if i really want to quit the program. what do i do wrong? or what should i do to fix this??"
,Blackninja420,2012-03-05T06:24Z,"I agree with Noobie, program is insanely small, only has an setup.exe file, then when you install and try to load you get errors about missing sky, cloud, and a couple other models.  Then the whole program just goes non-responsive. I sat at my computer not even able to CTRL+ALT+DELELTE it because it nearly crashed my computer with excessive CPU usage trying to shut itself down."
,jamesensor,2012-03-11T06:16Z,Damm virus. Keep away from this even if it shows many seeds. Download another one.
,Kuraj,2012-04-21T17:22Z,"I was a victim of spyware attack at the time that was highly correlated with installing this piece of software. Not 100% sure, but anyone who has been using this, PLEASE check for the following locations:

C:Users%username%AppDataLocalTempdclogs

There's a chance this folder will contain the saved keystrokes.

Malwarebytes got rid of the threat properly: http://i.imgur.com/IYSRe.jpg"
,Specktre5,2012-04-25T12:19Z,"Kuraj, thanks very much for the warning mate! This file IS a keylogger, after installing, go to the location Kuraj mentioned below after typing something into notepad and you will see files there from a keylogger."
,Specktre5,2012-04-25T12:21Z,"Yep, edit the .dc files in that folder with notepad and you will see all text you have typed since installing. Rebviruyuy, you're an asshole."
,kwantome,2012-09-29T23:21Z,"Hey, piratebay moderaters, stop being so damn useless. rebviruyuy is clearly boosting his positives with like 20 accounts that need to be IP banned- like nowish"
