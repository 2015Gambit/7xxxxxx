Twitter Censorship

In the first hour, investigative reporter Russ Baker commented on Twitter\'s announcement ( http://whowhatwhy.com/2012/02/02/close-reading-the-saudis-a-twitter-investment-and-the-end-of-arab-spring/ ) about restricting tweets in countries where the government declares the tweets illegal. Essentially, their decision means that in some nations people will not be allowed free expression via Twitter, he explained. Baker suggested that the new censorship ruling may be due in part to Twitter\'s relationship with a wealthy Saudi prince, who recently bought a large stake in the company and has a clear agenda in restricting tweets. Baker also explained about how Israel may act as America\'s fall guy in a possible forthcoming conflict with Iran.
