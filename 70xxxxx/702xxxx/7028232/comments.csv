,joulius,2012-03-31T23:38Z,thanks mate!!!!
,CrazyChef1,2012-04-21T03:16Z,"No Logs - No cue!

Download the tracks, create your own log and cue them up as you like, lazy bastard.

Thanks, Fre0n and all uploaders."
,btrfngrz,2012-08-28T05:45Z,"@disimagery2 - Is that all you can say? Every comment I've noticed you post is always exactly the same. 

Perhaps once every now and then you could actually say thanks to the uploaders that take the time to produce these torrents. Also, if not having logs and .cue files is such a massive problem for you (and clearly it is) like CrazyChef1 said, stop being so lazy and do it yourself.

@Fre0n - Thanks for the up boss :)"
