Plot: In 1979 the Monty Python comedy team return from making their film â€˜Monty Pythonâ€™s Life of Brianâ€™ in Tunisia. Premiered in America the film is pilloried by ultra-right religious groups for its depiction of Christ. In England the Popular Peoplesâ€™ Church of St Sophia (whose members include a Tourettes sufferer who shouts out swear words) find a copy of the script in a dustbin and lobby the British censor for its suppression,leading to many local councils banning its screening. Death threats follow and Michael Palin â€“ â€œthe nicest man in Britainâ€ â€“ has his effigy burned on his front lawn. Finally crazed TV programmer Alan Dick persuades Palin and co-star John Cleese to defend the picture on a late night chat show against the Bishop of Southwark and religious commentator Malcolm Muggeridge. Thanks to Cleeseâ€™s reasoning the Pythons are seen to triumph,winning over the Popular Peoplesâ€™ Churchâ€¦
