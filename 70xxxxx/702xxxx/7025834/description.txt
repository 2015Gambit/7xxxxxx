
In this book, Randi explores and exposes what he believes to be the outrageous deception that has been promoted widely in the media. Unafraid to call researchers to account for their failures and impostures, Randi tells us that we have been badly served by scientists who have failed to follow the procedures required by their training and traditions. Here, he shows us how what he views as sloppy research has been followed by rationalizations of evident failures, and we see these errors and misrepresentations clearly pointed out. Mr. Randi provides us with a compelling and convincing document that will certainly startle and enlighten all who read it.

This is the official Kindle Edition MOBI, which I converted to EPUB using Calibre. I tested the EPUB in iBooks on my iPad to make sure the conversion settings I used made it appear the same as the MOBI in the Kindle app. Sometimes Calibre conversions can mess up a book's formatting, but you can be confident that this EPUB conversion is just like the original.
