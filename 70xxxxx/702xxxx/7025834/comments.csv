,privateer2day,2012-02-12T01:54Z,Psychic phenomenon has been well proven in hundreds of well designed scientific studies at major institutions. For some of the proof visit www.scientificexploration.org. Don't bother downloading anything by James Randi unless you are as closed-minded and stupid as he is. 
[V],joshua13,2012-02-12T15:26Z,"not have have not been well proven. There are fringe scientists who believe in them just as there are those who will believe in ancient aliens, big foot and mass sponge migrations. Show me studies that have actually passed muster with scientists in general and become accepted science, not things only believed by those already convinced and published in journals no one takes seriously."
,sv504,2012-02-12T17:17Z,@privateer2day - not proven at all. Why else has the 1 million dollar Randi Prize never been claimed for anyone who can prove psychic phenomena under laboratory conditions? Talking about closed-minded.
,qupear,2012-02-13T20:21Z,"actually, all prizes for evidence of the paranormal are unclaimed yet (you can find list on wikipedia)"
,guitarslinger,2012-07-19T07:43Z,Okay I'm a noob. I downloaded it. How do I get it to work?
