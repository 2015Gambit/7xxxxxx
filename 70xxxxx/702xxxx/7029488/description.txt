[JimSlip.] Amica (Penny for a Pooch, Sir)



Is there no depth that charity workers will not plumb, to turn a coin? I saw Amica collecting money for a so called `hotel for dogs`. My suspicions were aroused by her claims that each kennel would be equipped with, `Satellite TV` and all dogs would be given a, `Full English breakfast every day!` Also she said that a dog, `Would phone you every week!` Do I look stupid? I know a dog`s paw is far too big to operate a keypad on any phone let alone an IPhone! Anyway, after some close questioning, it transpired that Amica was actually working for a stinking scumbag, who was in fact pocketing all the money that poverty stricken pensioners thought, was going abandoned dogs! Amica broke down in tears when I pointed out the error of her ways and managed to convince her that she should take the path of righteousness and perhaps do a hard days work ...
