"TuneUp was created for music lovers, by music lovers. All of us here 
are entrenched in music. We're cranking tunes all day. We constantly 
argue about things like which Radiohead album is best, whether Michael 
Jackson or Prince would win in a fight, the only five albums we would 
have on a deserted island and who in the office does the best Running Man. 

One thing we all agree on, however, is that our digital music collections 
were a mess as were our friends'. When we did some testing, we learned 
that almost everyone had the same problem we did. 
That's why we created TuneUp. 
  
We'll take care of all of this for you automatically. We're also the type 
of people who want all of our cover-art, don't like missing concerts and 
spend hours online looking for YouTube videos, news, and merch from our 
favorite artists. We've taken care of that too. And there's more to come... 

TuneUp is your music collection's new best friend.
