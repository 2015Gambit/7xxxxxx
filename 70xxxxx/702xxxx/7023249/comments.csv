,mrq701,2012-02-11T07:25Z,"i used itunes instead of wmp and it worked, ignore my previous post, thumbs up to uploader!! Great program!!!"
,boowat2,2012-02-13T20:30Z,"thankx mate, plz help me out how do u register an account. thanx again"
,iiSinX,2012-02-14T04:18Z,"@boowat2: Once you install and start the program, it asks you to enter an Email and Password. This is how you register an account."
,zercme,2012-02-14T21:40Z,Would love to get this to work but I keep getting the server down error.  Is there a work around.  Thanks appreciate all the work.  
,M.M0504,2012-02-15T13:29Z,the crack seems to work for about a day and then it asks me for a activation code ? any ideas ?
,Danndann666,2012-02-24T07:32Z,"Working good so far thanks [= 
(I had Both Problems But Easy Fix with instructions)"
,groo_v29,2012-02-27T11:25Z,"doesn't work for me. either i'm letting the program update and the app doesn't start or i'm preventing the update and i get ""unable to connect"" and the app doesn't sync with itunes"
,iiSinX,2012-02-28T06:36Z,"DO NOT UPDATE TO VERSION 2.4.2!

Check for my torrent for 2.4.2 in the next couple days.

As for everyone having problems with the server being down, Read the instructions the rest of the way though."
,GeneralNoobzor,2012-02-28T21:45Z,"Do you have a facebook/twitter I could follow? Been looking for a TuneUp crack forever, and when I find it, I am 4 days off and it is outdated.. Lol. Waiting for the 2.4.2 version!"
,danyaalkhan,2012-02-28T22:30Z,"It asks to update and i press cancel, then TuneUp closes. Shall I just update now and use when you released a new crack, or shall I wait and re-install when a new crack is released?"
,danyaalkhan,2012-02-28T22:32Z,"Sorry ignore the comment above, but as GeneralNoobzor said is there a twitter account I could follow for frequent updates?"
,Factorback07,2012-02-29T23:32Z,"Thanks for the upload iiSinX, can't wait until 2.4.2!"
,4Rebel4,2012-03-10T16:42Z,Any news on the newest version hacked? Update is forced right now :(
,MegaLou,2012-03-11T12:37Z,"Does anyone know when the crack for version 2.4.2 will be available?  I would love to use this plug-in.  Because of the forced update process to ver. 2.4.2, version 2.2.7 with the crack just won't work."
,anonoy,2012-03-11T12:50Z,"""Check for my torrent for 2.4.2 in the next couple days."" it becomes long .you work on it or you abandoned ?"
,TheSH3RIFF,2012-03-19T22:29Z,"Once I installed and followed the crack steps, I tried to run it, but it keeps on asking me for an update. Problem is, when I click no or cancel to the update, the program won't start. So now I have this stupid icon on my desktop which won't open unless updated.

For iiSinX, please hurry and crack the latest version! Other wise, this torrent is now useless."
,Danndann666,2012-03-22T04:16Z,Any News On The Update Yet?!?
,Keruser101,2012-03-25T17:34Z,I've managed to get past the auto-update.  Copy the settings.ini file (found in the updater folder) to your desktop.  Edit it and change version to 2.4.2.1 and then save.  Copy the desktop file back in the updater folder.
,prender,2012-03-26T15:49Z,@Keruser: Thank you!!!!
,Danndann666,2012-03-28T08:43Z,autoupdaters gone but servers down so not sure if working yet

,cclloyd,2012-04-11T04:03Z,"ATTENTION:  TO BLOCK FROM UPDATING

Open C:Program FilesTuneUp Mediaupdatersettings.ini

Change the version under the [APPLICATION] header to 2.4.2.2, save, and it will work."
,cclloyd,2012-04-11T04:29Z,"Even with that hack though, I still get server errors, so would very much appreciate the 2.4 update."
,Fomalimited,2012-04-12T00:52Z,2.4.2 and mac version please!
,Danndann666,2012-04-16T07:45Z,"its upto 2.4.4.3 now =
need an updated crack for this program? please"
,tommyboy123x,2012-04-17T09:08Z,"To get by the auto-updater, go to the the program's install location (usually C:program filestuneupmedia), then go in the updater folder and edit the settings.ini file.

Change the version to the latest and it won't attempt to update.

fixed."
,tommyboy123x,2012-04-17T09:09Z,"so in settings.ini:

version=2.4.4.3"
,Godlier,2012-04-18T00:09Z,I also get the server errors using that workaround.
,-3dw4rd,2012-04-20T02:25Z,"I get problems even though it doesn't try to update. ""Error trying to obtain a proper serial number"" & I registered first then installed the crack.."
,-3dw4rd,2012-04-20T02:26Z,Not working
,stuffmanca,2012-04-28T20:34Z,"fixed bug problems but program doesn't work.

the .exe runs, then demands to update and then either closes when you cancel the update or installs the update and doesn't work. Either way, it's a no go."
,anonoy,2012-04-28T22:33Z,Merci tommyboy123x  ton astuce a marchĂŠ la deuxiĂŠme fois :)
,gabdevil,2012-05-03T21:45Z,"could someone re-upload the clean crack pls? there is a trojan virus inside the crack -,-"
,Danndann666,2012-05-10T08:04Z,i think this torrents dead? no word on another crack and the updater version fix only seems to work for some people? (not me though)constant server error or cant create account/login)
,Slinger05,2012-06-01T23:46Z,Man. I was really hoping this would work. Too bad they patched it. 
,chrisla,2012-06-11T21:44Z,TROJAN
,capth4u,2012-07-21T05:34Z,The change to the settings.ini got it to launch but its stuck trying to connect to the server.... Any updated help? Thank you
