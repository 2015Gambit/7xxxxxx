This very-high resolution image is represented as a collection of
512x512 JPEG tile images, retrieved directly from the Google Art Project
at the highest available zoom level. The file info.xml gives the number
of tile rows and columns and the number of empty pixels at the right and
bottom edges (these should be discarded/ignored during viewing or machine
processing).

Viewing or processing an image represented in this format requires special
software. Even if the tiles were assembled into a single TIFF image, merely
loading it in a standard image editor like Photoshop would require far more
RAM than most PCs have. Moreover, the JPEG file format does not support
images of such high resolution due to limitations on width and height.

A complete tile pyramid can be constructed by combining and downscaling each
set of four adjacent tiles to form the next pyramid level down, then
repeating this until a single tile is reached. Such tile pyramids are
routinely used by viewing software for very large images, which load the
tiles in view on-demand, and use the different levels to support zoom
functionality. It is also possible to create software which crops
out a portion of the image (a detail) and saves it as a JPEG at maximum
resolution. If you create software like this, please consider publishing
it under an open source license so that others can benefit from it. There
may also be other unanticipated uses for this data.
