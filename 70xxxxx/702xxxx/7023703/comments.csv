sceneline is a trusted member here, their releases have always been good.  For me I have a solid state drive and space is at a premium so it's annoying that they release in rar form (someone else will later extract the file and upload it on its own, and I just help seed that instead of keeping almost 1GB of useless files) but they've never uploaded fakes or password protected files."
,xotoxpv,2012-02-11T11:06Z,why 24 files?

,Hancock79,2012-02-11T21:21Z,don't listen to that idiot fech.  it's real
,PauloFran,2012-02-12T00:06Z,"Video quality is good.

I don't like RAR files, though, 'cause it causes me to delete them once the download is complete, so I end up not seeding."
,Digee,2012-02-12T02:38Z,"To watch this episode, you'll first want to seperate CRAP from CONTENT which is at a ratio of 5:19. then process some of the excessive downloaded files with some software for unpackaging (its not really compressed, is it?), which will mean that you need at least double the filesize in storage space. If you want to seed *and* keep a watchable copy of this on your computer then ~2gb is needed for this episode, which is HD but not a WEB-DL quality release.

1. Download
2. Delete crap
3. Decompress
4. Do not seed

,Digee,2012-02-12T02:48Z,"Dear sceneline,

The only reason you continue to get high numbers of seeders/leechers is that you release the episode in HD the earliest. If we were given a choice between this torrent and a good quality torrent released at the same time, then your name would be unheard of.

Its not 1999.
We're not using Kazaa
And we're not connecting over 56k.
So consider following the advice written in this torrents description, and ""Evolve... or die"".

Stop wasting our time. Stop wasting our filespace. Stop wasting our bandwidth. Most importantly, stop discouraging seeding."
[V],sceneline,2012-02-12T12:17Z,"Digee mate you are not in 1999 but you are in 1919 as you don't know how to play rarfile without unrared
use VLC and you can play direct from rar file no need to delete what you download play direct,
people cracking the new planeds and you are still can't unrar a file :) Enjoy the torrents "
,Digee,2012-02-12T16:20Z,"I only learned about that a few months ago and I was impressed that it can do that, but I don't get why you think its a good idea?! It would be less effort for you and us if you just gave us the file we wanted without processing it!
I'm not complaining that I cant manage it, just why over-complicate things? I cant imagine you do it without any reasoning, but it seems so irrational, and when I've tried to ask why its like this, the only responses I've read that made sense were that its done for the sake of paying homage to old school p2p systems, or that you just carry on doing it because you didnt learn the reasoning behind those old techniques.
If we get disconnected mid-download we wont be losing the pieces that are incomplete, so if you prefer to stuff it in a .rar then why not use a single .rar file? 50mb lumps are for CD-RW's? Are there external devices (consoles or media players) that play from .rar but not .mkv?

Just put it to the test and see which people prefer when given a choice. When you get s04e13 to upload, do your normal upload, and then another with just the clean .mkv (preferably no quality sample, .NFO, .txt advertising ...but whatever) and keep an eye on the popularity. In the torrent description for both, make an obvious link to the other so people are aware of 2 versions and arent biased.

Its not much effort, and if you don't do it, someone else will. Theres nothing to lose for you, youd be stealing seeders from yourself."
