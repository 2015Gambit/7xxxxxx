THE ONLY PROBLEM I SEE WITH THE FIRST FAMILIES
FOOD STORAGE

they obviously havent lived through a size 7 or higher quake
for 20 seconds before

as none of the selves have edges of 2 inches of more

and smash on the FLOOR I suspect many are glass
jars not plastic as well since its cleaner and seals better"

so matches the other cappers and natgeo
listing and ignore tvrage

it will save the confusion on new episodes to come

so -1 in Episode name when get this"
