Doomsday.Preppers.S01E02.Webrip-AnalogueSrc-][ Bullets, Lots of Bullets ][ 07-Feb-2012 ]

ok I finally hunted down a web source of this episode

much work done on it to try to improve it.. the source is almost as bad
as someone filming a TV set with rabbit ears however with some tweaking
and removal of the ads and some sound tweaking its
reasonable and watchable medium quality xvid

take it or leave it.. I dont wish to get more abuse for trying to source
for people this will have to do if ever a HD comes out.. normally it
does once i release a version.. its like competition for scenereleases right :)

i also have the first item only for E03 yet to edit and share

some may called this a new season.. but frankly one episode season is
silly and really its a pilot preview that should be part of the new series

so maybe be called anything like S01E01 or S02E01 but Im calling it
like tvrage S01E02

enjoy and HELP ME SEED IT!.. your lucky I spend a few hours today
finding and editing it!
