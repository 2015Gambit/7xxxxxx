,ChristmasCoke123,2012-04-14T23:48Z,"@Chef_Dan It doesn't show the files in magnet link, it shows blank because you dont have the torrent on your computer. Just choose the folder you wish to download it to and then just press download and you will see that the download will start. I just got the same as you and i am now half way through the download :). Cheers!"
