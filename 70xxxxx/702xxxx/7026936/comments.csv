,androidmasterkkr,2012-02-13T13:11Z,"Installation Instructions:-

1) Android does not natively come with any method of browsing the data on your SD card, so you will need to install a file manager from a market. There are a large variety of file managers available on Android, but my personal favourite is ASTRO File Manager.

2) Copy .apk file to SD card

Once you have ASTRO File Manager installed, connect your Android device to your PC using your USB cable. Mount the SD card and copy over the .apk file you would like to install.

3) Install .apk

On your Android device, navigate to the .apk file using ASTRO File Manager and select it.

This will open a dialog box allowing you to install the app. Select â€œOpen App Managerâ€œ.

On the next two pages, select â€œInstallâ€ and â€œInstallâ€ again to install the .apk.

Likewise install all apps."
