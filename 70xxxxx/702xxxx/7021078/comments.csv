renamed and reseeded. I waited for days for the original (above) torrent to fire up. In the end I got a lucky download from demonoid. It's the same content. Cheers"

,polarbearable,2012-02-17T01:14Z,This took me 9 days to upload. There were about 28 peers. I waited until at least 20 had completed their download thinking at least a few will hang around and continue to seed. WRONG. 3 days later I check things and find 0 seeds. That's the sort of behavior I'd expect from Rimmer. Are you too going to be just another Rimmer?
