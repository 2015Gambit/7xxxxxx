"After many, many years waiting I was nearly fit to burst with excitement when I heard there where going to be three new episodes of one of my favourite comedies of all time, RED DWARF. They were eventually broadcast first on British TV channel Dave over the Easter weekend of 2009.

I must admit though, as a 'Dwarf fan and, as good as they were, I found the whole new 'Dwarf experience somewhat different. What was it? Was it the fact that the three episodes felt like they should've been one feature length episode? Was it the lack of a laughter track?

IT WAS BOTH OF THESE.

So, I took it upon myself last night to fix what I thought needed fixing. I've edited all three episodes and stitched them back to back seamlessly - for the first time, you have a FEATURE LENGTH EPISODE OF RED DWARF!

Now, the laughter. I've added a laughter track. As much as I enjoyed the new episodes, to me they just didn't seem the same without a laughter track. I've added one.

Even if I do say so myself, I really am quite proud of what I've done in the five hours it took and I hope you, fellow Red Dwarf fans, equally enjoy this!"

Cheers,

Shaun Garrod.
