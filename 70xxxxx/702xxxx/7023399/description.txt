         Shoes have come a long way from their humble beginnings       
         as simple leather moccasins. Today footwear is built to       
         withstand any extreme environment where a foot can tread      
         -- from the heart of a burning building to the track of       
         an Olympic stadium. From high-tech soles to shoelaces,        
         cowboy boots to sneaker design -- step behind the scenes      
          with the products that keep your feet covered.
