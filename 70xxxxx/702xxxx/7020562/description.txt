Description: Continuation of violent shooter hitman Jackie Estacado, which creates its own affairs under the protection (or rather, cursing) otherworldly darkness. Since that time, Jackie has grown to a mafia boss's office and got into a full-scale war between gangsters - so that his "dark" abilities will be where carousing. Studio Digital Extremes is going to give up a realistic picture of the game and apply the technology sat-shading that simulates two-dimensional drawing.
