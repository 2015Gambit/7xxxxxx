Long time, no see everyone! This is an "iPod H.264" video file of the astonishing, hilarious television show from Nickelodeon called, "iCarly". 
This video file is the very first episode of iCarly, which is why the episode is called "iPilot".
This first episode is eventually made in Season 1 and you can directly sync this to your portable device, "iPod Nano", but I'm not sure for other devices, so I prefer you to try syncing this video file to your other devices other than iPod Nano to see if it really works. 
This is my first time uploading a video to "ThePirateBay". I created this torrent from uTorrent and started to seed it. 
If you are having some critical issues with this file, please tell me them so I can fix it. Please seed this video file and I would be uploading more files soon!
