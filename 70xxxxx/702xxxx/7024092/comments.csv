,SilenceMurderer,2012-02-12T15:27Z,"And also with this torrent the same problem occurs, just like your 'we need to talk about kevin' and 'j. edgar' upload i cannot download anything.

- time elapsed 30 min.
- connected to a swarm of 50
- 40 Mb/s internet connection
- No other internet activities in my house
- Other torrents do fine

How is this possible?"

the seeders/leechers ratio is currently somewhere around 0.2
So it is normal the speed is very low. Just wait a couple days if you want full broadband speed, till the ratio is around 1."

I meant, not even downloaded a kb, just 0."
