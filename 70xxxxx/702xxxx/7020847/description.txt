Planning a shower can be a daunting task--especially since contemporary showers are no longer reserved strictly for female guests to honor brides and expectant mothers. Spectacular Showers for Brides, Babies, and Beyond takes the guesswork and anxiety out of planning and hosting a shower. It covers every type of shower party, from traditional bridal, couple, and baby showers to specialty showers for retirements, going-away-to-college, grandparents, and more. The author serves up a generous helping of recipes, practical checklists, and economical suggestions for decorating and catering.
