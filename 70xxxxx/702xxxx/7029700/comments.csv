to happen every 5 coin inserts regardless 3 bags full and 
one other pokie I notice this one.. rest of them seem fine
or have that setting thats missed in those 2 machine roms

Press M twice will clear the error and can insert
another 5 coins before error happens

i guess once won heaps of cash wont be a issue as you
have 1000s o credits to play with

Just reminder.. theres seems no setting to disable that
from my searchings..

a MINOR ANNOYANCE"
