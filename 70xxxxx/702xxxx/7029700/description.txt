12 Real Working Aussie Pokies using mame32 - Preset Up-Configured - just unrar to any location-drive

This is version 2.0 update (to last nights upload)

Ok I spent a few hours today tweaking more settings to make the
game play better and I managed to find new ROM sets for 6 more
working Aussie Pokie Games 

You now have
Fantasy Fortune
3 Bags Full
KG Bird
White Tiger
enchanted forest


to name a few extra to play with.

====

Just unzip to Root of C and make a shortcut to the mameui32.exe
to your desktop and double click to start then
should display a list of 12 (favourites) you can select from

Keys that you just need to Know (see other torrent for
other info or read the enclosed textfiles)

Spacebar = Spins (max bet) or H
5 or 6 key Inserts coins or notes if you run out of credits
M key = opens and closes the door.. if you get error
call attendant.. happens on some games if try to
insert coins too fast!! LOL

ESC = quits the game

follow the instructions and press OK to start the game/pokie

and TAB can find this game controls if you want 
to custom keys or see what keys do what.
but best to leave it alone as the cursor and controls
can be confusing and you can stuff up the working Pokie :)

enjoy and HELP ME SEED THIS NEW COLLECTION
