â˜… What won't my children learn?

The game does not overload children and parents with too many audio and visual stimuli. Coping with stress and over-stimulation is therefore one skill that your kids won't be practicing during this game. Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.

Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time â€“ and learning!

â˜… Hey, how did you take the top four spots in the Education section?

âœ” Kids love our games. Parents love to see their preschool-aged children being both educated and quietly happy. Google noticed our great reviews and then featured and promoted our apps.

âœ” Our games are laser focused. For example, the numbers game doesn't teach letters, and the letters game doesn't teach math. We keep the games simple but magically inviting and nourishing.

âœ” We strive to give children just the right balance between education and fun. So our games don't feature fun at the expense of education â€“ or education at the expense of fun. We also know games that are too complicated donâ€™t involve and delight kids.

We hope your children enjoy all the fun and education we've built into our game of Kids Numbers and Math â€“ and that you'll enjoy our other kid-friendly games, too.
