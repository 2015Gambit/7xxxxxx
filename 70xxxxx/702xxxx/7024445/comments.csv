Thanks for the upload. But I get choppy sound on this one, can I be missing a codec?"
[T],TeukkaS,2012-02-16T10:12Z,"Hello!
choppy???
You mean unbalanced or bumpy or what?
I do not hear anything wrong with it, but I am almost deaf!
Did you use a computer or DVD player?
How was it with the other parts of the film?"

Its mostly in the beginning of the movie!

Its a good upload! :)"
