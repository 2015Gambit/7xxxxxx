Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond are on location with the forthcoming Sweeney movie as they take charge 
of shooting the film's climactic car chase. Clarkson uses his expertise to choreograph the stunt driving 
whilst Hammond directs the movie's lead actors, Ray Winstone and Plan B, and organises an explosive finale.

Meanwhile, back at the test track James May casts a suspicious eye over the new Vauxhall Corsa VXR 
Nurburgring and gives his verdict on the brand new Fiat Panda. Plus, Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds 
is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.
