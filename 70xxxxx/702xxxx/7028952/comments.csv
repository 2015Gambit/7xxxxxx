,mr.booza,2012-02-13T22:31Z,"cheers, and thanks for the magnet post link"
,nightprowler.,2012-02-13T22:49Z,"Thanks for the link, kinda in the same line as:
https://torrentfreak.com/tribler-makes-bittorrent-impossible-to-shut-down-120208/

Basically this will be better once people are using it because then the torrent will live as long as there are seeders, they can't be taken down simply by taking down a tracker."
,boyprime2002,2012-02-14T22:20Z,So would you need BTGuard if you're running Tribler then?  And is this a return to the old peer-to-peer?
,nightprowler.,2012-02-15T00:31Z,"I don't know much about Tribler TBH, I just happened to read that article the other day and it was along the same lines as the one Merzedes posted.

The main point is decentralization of torrents. "
