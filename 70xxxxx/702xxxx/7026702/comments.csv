You have to install update in exactly the same folder where you install whole program, so you'll see an ""already exists"" message.

It works for me.

The trick is (as i suppose) that ""Factory Sound Data"" library must be placed in ""Sound Data"" folder in main AD folder (after update you have there such folders as ""AD 1_5_1"" and so)."
