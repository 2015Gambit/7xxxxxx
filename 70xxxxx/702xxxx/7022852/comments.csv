,Jakeler,2012-02-10T19:54Z,is this real?
,Tilaisuus,2012-02-10T19:58Z,"Rlslog says Skidrow version is out, so it probably is. Preordered the game, but as the official release is days away I think I'll give this a try."
,parazun1,2012-02-10T20:08Z,"Dunno , but hes other torrents seem legit so why bother putting up a fake?
suspicous wiht the lack of seeders /leechers though "
,Itchiga,2012-02-10T20:12Z,http://www.orlydb.com/s/games looks valid
,Afatguywithglasses,2012-02-10T20:21Z,"Looks legit. The guy has also uploaded things in the past, looks like they've all been legit. 

I'm trusting this."
,Tilaisuus,2012-02-10T20:28Z,"Just downloaded it and fired it up, it is legit and completely clean.

Thank you MsB1982! 

I hope a lot of you guys end up buying this game though as I did. We need to support this kind of games."
,parazun1,2012-02-10T20:43Z,"just installed it , its real and it works

,BrokeRobot,2012-02-11T02:56Z,Its real.
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T05:43Z,"Re-pack usually means they leave out certain files like microsoft visuals, directx, sometimes in game movies too.. which totally ruins the games..."
,Jakeler,2012-02-11T10:55Z,wicked fast download and 100% legit thanks a ton MsB1982!
,Jakeler,2012-02-11T11:33Z,Except I crash alot. Even disableing the tips crashes my game? anyone else have this issue?
,Fiskkorv,2012-02-11T12:20Z,Going to test it out and if it is as good as eu3 i will buy it
,BrontoSion,2012-02-11T13:11Z,"Perfect release!
Works great and I will seed as long as there is a need for it. What a great game!"
,kNizSP,2012-02-11T13:11Z,The game crash a lot for me. Dunno if it's because I'm using Spanish translation or what. Didn't try in Eng.
,Quel1991,2012-02-11T13:20Z,"Great, works perfect...But now the question is, how can I play as a Pagan or Muslin state?"
,alvertis4,2012-02-11T19:47Z,"@Quel1991: There was a trick in the demo where you could choose any character, click play, and quickly click again on someone else(e.g a muslim or a pagan) and you would start as on of those. There should also be some mods for this soon too ;p But still you'll miss out a lot since there aren't any events or stuff for muslims and pagans ;p"
,_Necross_,2012-02-12T23:31Z,This game is awesome!
,loveeee,2012-02-13T01:04Z,"I got a c++ runtime error when I try to launch it. Is there any fix? My computer isn't the best but it should be able to run this.. Tried to restart and everything.

,dudedude535,2012-02-13T04:33Z,"Hey guys, i just downloaded the game and after 10 min of gameplay it freeze. 

I can still hear the music in the background but its frozen. Anyone with the same problem? Any idea what i could do to fix it?"
,alvertis4,2012-02-13T22:31Z,"I should note that this is actually NOT the final game, I believe its a demo with a cracked/modified .exe to allow saves.
Although I get a different checksum from the demo+beta exe I had, I found some things missing and also some modifiers are the ""demo version""(e.g the mercenary costs, they are much higher in the final game).

Not meaning to be an asshole, thanks for the release anyway ;)"
,ss4rafi,2012-02-14T06:24Z,does this have 'check for update' option on the launcher? normally paradox games have this option but the KaOs version doesn't  have it.
,Valamyr82,2012-02-14T10:17Z,"Okay, instead of releasing a Day-One patch Paradox have built-in their patch into the version theyre releasing on Steam and GG. We need someone who brought it and has access to their ""1.02b"" files to upload it again I guess, because they have no reason now to release a proper patch obviously."
,BrokeRobot,2012-02-14T10:45Z,"So now we needed a version put up with the release day patch, this one doesn't have it.  Newest is 1.02b"
,BrokeRobot,2012-02-14T11:24Z,"Alvertis this is not a cracked demo, this is the full game.  The merc cost was supposed to be higher in the released version, but it isnt.  

This is a great torrent, all thats missing is the release day patch."
,alvertis4,2012-02-14T14:21Z,"@BrokeRoot: Apologies, it seems that youre right afterall ;)
Theres also a bug with the Holy War casus belli where you gain extra lands and rulers which was supposed to only be in the demo, but I guess it was actually in the game too and fixed in the 1.02 patch ;)"
,4331a,2012-02-14T14:53Z,Old version and no dlcs. Otherwise good.

,Awwal12,2012-02-19T21:19Z,"Guys, I have a problem, and apparently it's about all the versions of CK2, not only this one. Even after I downloaded the dlls from C++ pack, the game refuses to lauch. An error during launching (0xc000007b) with no much other comments. What could that be and, well, how to fix it after all? My OS is Windows 7 home base. I would be grateful for any tips."

,Awwal12,2012-02-24T13:40Z,"baidwan,
it means that you lack the up-to-date Microsoft Visual C++ library pack, which includes that file. You can download it for free at the microsoft.com, there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions.

(It will be wonderful is smb will help ME, heh.)"

,Protoz,2012-02-27T06:43Z,This game could of been made 15 years ago and no one would be able to tell a difference.

,tourmin,2012-04-12T04:35Z,i've already downloaded this file twice. the  .bin file is not opening nor can i find the image to burn it. the .bin file appears to be VLC file. Can anyone help?
,halfchaos,2012-04-28T05:07Z,Check 3rd party websites like moddb and strategyinformer for mods if the forum is restricted. Sometimes the mod authors host them there too. http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/mods/crusaderkingsii/mod.html
,dothackjhe,2012-05-10T10:51Z,@tourmin You need to mount the .cue file that accompanies the .bin file on a virtual drive. Install daemon tools lite and mount the file on one of its drive.

,Selvec,2012-06-29T11:37Z,"If you are having trouble copying the steam files. mount the .cue file, not the .bin

,Levy_NR,2012-08-10T22:24Z,Error 0xc0000135. Cant play this game... :C Does anyone can help me with this?
,Elenbor,2012-08-24T16:05Z,"I am happy to report that I have finally figured out the flag issue. I have spent over a day on this and could not find an answer anywhere.

The flag .tga image files in Install-location/gfx/flags for the Timurids, Il-Khanate and Golden Horde are wrongly labelled as kingdoms instead of empires (change the k at the start of the image file name into an e).

After you have done this delete the UserNameDocumentsParadox InteractiveCrusader Kings IIgfx   folder so the flag files are loaded again.

With the .tga files wrongly labelled they weren't a part of the flag cache meaning the 3 empires took flags that weren't theirs and all the flags moved 3 places forward messing it all up.

I am not sure if this is in the original version or caused by any of the updates but I experimented and the error always happened to me."
