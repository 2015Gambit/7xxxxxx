[T],iamgreat,2012-02-18T01:55Z,"Thanks for creating a dupe torrent of my own release. :(  If you want to upload my releases to TPB how about you also do the capping, cropping, ripping, and encoding for my releases. O wait, you can't. So please don't dupe me in my own releases or i just won't release whatever obscure thing it is you might otherwise have gotten from me. 

Please DO NOT modify my nfo. 

My real release can be had at
