SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock were both considered for starring roles in this film at one point, with the film being developed as an "African American Ocean's Eleven". Murphy was eventually cast for a supporting role after Ben Stiller signed on as the lead. 

Trump Tower in Manhattan was the stand-in for the "The Tower" in the film. 

Greg Grunberg, who has a son suffering from epilepsy, demanded an apology from Brett Ratner after hearing a joke about seizures from the trailer. Ratner later apologized. 

Robert Redford was offered the role of Arthur Shaw, but turned it down. 

Ben Stiller and Matthew Broderick previously collaborated in the 1996 movie The Cable Guy. In this movie, directed by Stiller, Broderick plays the main character, named Steven Kovacs. In Tower Heist, Broderick costars with Stiller, with Stiller playing as main character Josh Kovacs. 

The original idea for the movie came from Eddie Murphy who first pitched it to both director and producer Brett Ratner and Brian Grazer years before the project was finally launched. 

Casey Affleck also stars in Ocean's Eleven, the film that partially inspired Tower Heist.

PLOT: Josh Kovacs is the manager of a residential apartment in New York. He is close to all the tenants, especially Arthur Shaw, a financier. One day Shaw is arrested by the FBI for fraud. Josh thinks it's a misunderstanding that can be resolved. But later he learns that the employees' pension which he asked Shaw to handle is gone. When one of the employees tries to kill himself, Josh's views of Shaw change. He goes to see him and loses his temper. He loses his job. The FBI agent in charge of Shaw tells him that Shaw might walk and recovering the pension fund is unlikely. She tells him that it's been rumored that Shaw has 20 million laying around if he needs. Josh thinks he knows where it is. So with two other employees who also lost their jobs and an evicted tenant, they set out to get into Shaw's penthouse to get the money. But they realise they need the assistance of someone who knows what they are doing...
