,pxpierre,2012-02-14T06:16Z,"From the huffingtonpost review:
""AMC's new reality show chronicles the life and times of five people working at the New Jersey comic book store ""Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash."" Cutting between shenanigans at the store, a roundtable podcast, and the pursuit of rare collectibles, Comic Book Men promised on the surface to provide a unique look into the often-misunderstood world of pop culture collectibles.
