Make sure you read the system requirements for AVG Internet Security 2012 from their homepage. Do you have a linux operating system, mac, or just an ordinary windows system? The best way to solve your solution is to check AVG's website and see the system requirements in able to access the setup. Thanks for asking me that question. "

,windows10,2012-04-14T00:00Z,"Mickocool reply,
I'm very sorry for your critical situation about having a long installation. Maybe this program is not compatible with your computer or you have not meet the system requirements. Please check AVG's website to see the required things you need to have before installing. At least you have installed the program. Thanks for telling me your problem.  "
,Rocketwez,2012-04-17T08:30Z,"Will this work with win 7 ultimate, i tried another one and it did not work because it said the program AVG needs a digital signiture to be used correctly..."
,windows10,2012-04-21T18:19Z,"Rocketwez reply,
Yes, it will work on Windows 7 Ultimate depending on your computer system, but I'm sorry to hear your critical situation about this program. I have never heard of this problem before from some of the users who commented on this torrent. I'm not sure what happened, but try runnning the setup in Administrative Mode. I'm very sorry to hear your problem. "

,lif3isfr33,2012-08-11T02:44Z,"Guys I tried this and some other torrent on AVG 2012 Internet Security. All licenses that are being put out are getting blacklisted left and right and dropping like flies!!! I had a working serial that expired in 2018 and got blacklisted and it went to trial mode. I downloaded this, took a few seconds and got blacklisted too! 

""You may be a victim of software counterfeiting. You are using an illegal copy of AVG internet security. For continued protection, please obtain a valid license."" 

HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!! :'("
,rugburn11,2012-08-15T19:11Z,"Start up AVG Internet Security
go to TOOLS
FIREWALL SETTINGS ...scroll down for AVG

Not sure which one to block

AVG Identity Protection Service...?
AVG Installer Application...?
AVG Tray Monitor...?
AVG Watchdog Service...?

Can someone Please let us know thank you!!!!"
,lif3isfr33,2012-08-18T00:36Z,OK I blocked all the services from AVG. Entered a new serial and it worked. No more annoying messages regarding 30day trial. It went back to 2012. Just block everything from AVG using your firewall. :)
,lif3isfr33,2012-08-18T00:36Z,whoops I meant it *went back to 2018 for the expiration date. -__-
,spectating,2012-08-18T18:49Z,"@lif3isfr33: Under which menu? There's General, Security, Areas and Adapters, etc.. I do see applications under ""Directly Connected to the internet"", however are those the actual protection apps?"
,lif3isfr33,2012-08-20T05:38Z,@spectating I said use your firewall to block AVG services. I'm not using this torrent. Just go to AVG IS and go to tools then firewall.
,VV1LLC,2012-08-20T06:24Z,"But wont blocking everything with the firewall beat the purpose of having an Anti-virus in the first place? For example, how will you be able to update the virus definitions if you're blocking all outgoing connections?"
,lif3isfr33,2012-08-21T07:13Z,Just double checked I don't have everything blocked. I only have firewall unblocked so yeah.
,VV1LLC,2012-08-21T20:53Z,"Like I said... Block Everything Except for the FireWall, and you render the AVG Basically Useless... It won't update... "
,lif3isfr33,2012-08-21T21:29Z,I updated yesterday without hardly any problems. Am I missing something? Everything is active and updates work without it snitching on me. I guess the other services report the serials or something.
,rokridge,2012-08-31T03:54Z,seems fine so far thanx
