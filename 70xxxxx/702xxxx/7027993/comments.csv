,Umpie,2012-05-03T11:23Z,"Nice program, can do many different kinds of bar-codes. 

I was only interested in the QR-code, but in this program I can not choose what error correction level is used, so I assume it just uses the simplest level L.
I prefer level H some times (when size does not matter).

Level L 	7% of codewords can be restored.
Level M 	15% of codewords can be restored.
Level Q 	25% of codewords can be restored.
Level H 	30% of codewords can be restored. 

It is nice the you can use your own imported list of codes to generate multiple bar-codes, or generate a numeric sequence or random list of bar-codes.
Install and registration is simple (read Linezer0.nfo)."
