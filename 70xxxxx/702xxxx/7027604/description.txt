How the Brits Rocked America: Go West
A three-parter about British pop acts that have flourished Stateside. In recent decades, UK bands' trips across the Atlantic have been dogged by indifference - not so in the 1960s, which is where this series begins. Graham Nash of the Hollies, Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits, Eric Burdon of the Animals and, if you please, Paul McCartney are all interviewed, recalling the British Invasion.


1)  How the West Was Won 
British bands' attempts to find success in the USA, beginning in the 1960s, the decade in which acts including the Beatles, the Hollies, Herman's Hermits and the Animals found fame on both sides of the Atlantic. The documentary examines how British musicians and American audiences became fascinated by each other's cultures, and features contributions by Paul McCartney, Graham Nash, Peter Noone, Eric Burdon, Donovan and Mickey Dolenz.

2)  Stairway to Heaven 
How British bands thrived amid the culture of excess that began to dominate rock music in the 1970s. The programme examines how Cream broke into the American market during the late 1960s, before Led Zeppelin achieved even greater success at the start of the 1970s, fundamentally altering the sound of rock as a result. The programme also recalls the 1974 California Jam, where acts including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Emerson, Lake & Palmer played to an estimated crowd of one million people, and charts the rise of arena rock concerts during the decade. With contributions by Jimmy Page, Jack Bruce, Paul McCartney, Tony Iommi, John Lord, Bill Bruford, Rick Wakeman and Jeff Lynne.

3)  We re the Kids in America 
The Sex Pistols' American tour of 1978 might not have been a commercial success but it would set the tone and attitude for a new wave of British rock in the USA, while Duran Duran would lead a new pop invasion in the 80s. With contributions from John Lydon and Robert Smith.
