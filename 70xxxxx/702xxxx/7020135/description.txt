Scene developer cotojestwtf aka cotojwtf has released a upadate to his YAB (Yet Another
Bypass) tool, bringing it to version 1.3. This tool allows EU PS3 consoles (US too) on
OFW 4.00 to bypass the 4.10 requirement, and allow access to their network for
downloading, gaming, videos, etc. There has also been important information released by
bcklzz that will guide you making in this tool compatible with your US PS3 consoles. THIS
DOES NOT WORK FOR JB or CFW PS3s!!!
