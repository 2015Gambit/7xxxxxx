I made this video movie documentary.  The goal of the film is to make you realize that movies are made to program the viewer to accept certain ideas that are designed to change behavior.  This is done because certain agendas and ideas are easier accepted if someone is familiar with them.  An example, future technology is put into movies ahead of time.  When the technology is released, people are already familiar with it.  An example I used in my movie was from Back to the Future II where flat screen TVs are present.  Another example, from that movie, that I didn't use is where Marty's Asian boss is shown.  The programming here is America's job's moving overseas to China.  

If you still don't believe that such programming takes place, why don't you think about all the movies that have a character merging with technology?   There are a lot of movies showing someone having a computer chip implanted underneath their skin. This is how the programming works.  Present an idea that might be first opposed and put it in a movie, television or print media.  Have that idea look cool and sexy.  Use comedy to bypass people's critical thinking.  Use subliminal imagery and metaphors.  Have the desired programming reach a young audience because children don't have the same critical thinking as adults.  Once the children are grown up, they will be the ones given the culture and the things that you programmed them with.  A lot of times you want to put the desired programming into their subconscious before the event happens.  And it is important to destroy the family because such ideas will be more acceptable to the target without parents as role models that give their child a strong moral code and knowledge.

Another example I used was from the movie Conspiracy Theory where you have Mel Gibson's character talk about the New World Order and the Illuminati.  He is presented as paranoid and crazy.  If someone watched this movie and later hears the word conspiracy, he or she has the image of Mel Gibson in Conspiracy Theory.  An association is made between the topic of conspiracy theory with crazy and paranoid.  This can prevent that person from listening to such ideas because they have been already programmed to have a perceived belief.

My documentary also covers movies with satanic themes.  Jesus the Christ is my savior.  I see the top of the New World Order being satanic with their influence being present in media, literature, and music.  My job then is to expose what I feel is wrong and show what I believe is truth.  That truth is Jesus Christ the Savior.
