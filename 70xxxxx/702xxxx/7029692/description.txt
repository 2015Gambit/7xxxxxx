SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

When President Skroob meets the Gallup twins, he tells them to "chew their gum." This is a reference to "Doublemint" commercials featuring twins. 

Colonel Harland Sanders is the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Dark Helmet says "What's the matter, Colonel Sandurz? Chicken?" 

President Skroob's name is an anagram of Mel Brooks, the man who plays him. 

Mel Brooks sent the script to George Lucas and was concerned that he would be offended, but Lucas called Brooks and gave him his trust after seeing Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. 

George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic constructed the the puppet of the chest-burster for the film. The main effects unit for the film was Apogee, Inc. This was the company headed by John Dykstra that split off from ILM in 1978 when Lucasfilm moved to Marin County. Thus, Spaceballs marked the first time since Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope that the two units shared work on a single project. 

Mel Brooks came up with the idea for this film when he discovered he had yet to spoof space movies, since he already destroyed the western films with Blazing Saddles, made fun of the horror genre with Young Frankenstein, and gave silent movies the ax with Silent Movie.

PLOT: King Roland of the planet Druidia is trying to marry his daughter Princess Vespa to Prince Valium, but Vespa is kidnapped by the evil race of the Spaceballs. The Spaceballs ask Roland a tremendous ransom: all the air of Druidia (you see, the air of Spaceball had serious pollution problems...). The King decides to offer a generous amount of money to a space rogue, Lone Starr, to persuade him to save Vespa. What follows is the parody of a _LOT_ of famous SF movies.
