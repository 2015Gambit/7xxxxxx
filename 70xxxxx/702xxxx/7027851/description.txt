    \"Name\" is the title of a song recorded by the Goo Goo Dolls. It was released in September 1995 as the third single from the album,\" A Boy Named Goo\". The song, the band\'s first hit, topped both the US Modern Rock chart and the US Album Rock chart, and reached as high as number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.[1] Until the release of the Dizzy Up the Girl album three years later, \"Name\" was by far the band\'s most popular and well known song.The band re-recorded this song for their compilation album, Greatest Hits Volume One: The Singles. The new version is much more raw with a very stripped down production compared to the original 1995 recording.

    A Long December\" is a song by American alternative rock band Counting Crows. It is the second single and thirteenth track from their second album, Recovering The Satellites (1996).

It was the most successful single from the album, and is also the most internationally successful single ever released by Our Lady Peace. The music video was filmed between April 25 and 26, 2002 in Montreal. It shows the band performing for fans on a rounded stage lit up in a very dark studio. Most of the video focuses on a woman who climbs to the top of a speaker tower and then throws herself off, being caught by the crowd. The video was officially released on May 22, 2002. This is also Steve Mazur\'s first appearance in the band since former lead guitarist Mike Turner left to form Fair Ground.
