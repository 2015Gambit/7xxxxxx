                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Dispatches is a British television current affairs documentary series on      
 Channel 4, first transmitted in 1987. The programme covers issues about       
 British society, politics, health, religion, international current affairs and
 the environment.                                                              
                                                                               
 Antony Barnett investigates the scramble for London 2012 tickets, after 1.8   
 million people applied to book their seat at the sporting showpiece. With the 
 majority of applicants left disappointed, Barnett explores whether the Games 
 will be as accessible and affordable as the organisers had claimed.
                                                          
                                 Enjoy!
