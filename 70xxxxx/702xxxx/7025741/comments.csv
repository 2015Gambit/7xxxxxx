This is the real deal, so please just stay calm until everything is finished and then start seeding as well. I'm sure you guys will love this O.S and trust me...  even without making some tweaks and tunes you will find that its fast."
,RavingRabbits,2012-02-12T10:52Z,"hey there, does this contains all the alienware stuff? wanna do a restore on my m11x.

btw, theres no seeder. seed pleaseeeee. i will seed for as long as possible when done, now everyone just stucked at 1.6% :("
,DuvanS,2012-02-12T18:01Z,"it contains everything you will need to restore... plus the w7l extreme edition if you want to crack it... you would also be able to download all the windows updates without any problems even with the cracked edition. Like I said before, did knot know things was going to kick of with such a boom, I'm currently the only seeder at 100% and running a really, really slow 386 line in South Africa... but not to worry, going to move torrent over on a 1gps line hopefully by Thursday the 16 February 2012, until then I want to say sorry again for the speed."
