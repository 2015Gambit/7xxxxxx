The Wall is the eleventh studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. Released as a 
double album on 30 November 1979, it was subsequently performed live with elaborate theatrical 
effects, and adapted into a feature film, Pink Floydâ€”The Wall.

As with the band's previous three studio albums The Wall is a concept album, and deals largely with 
themes of abandonment and personal isolation. It was first conceived during the band's 1977 In the 
Flesh Tour, when bassist and lyricist Roger Waters's frustration with the spectators' perceived 
boorishness became so acute that he imagined building a wall between the performers and audience. 
The album is a rock opera that centres on Pink, a character based on Waters or maybe Syd Barrett. 
Pink's life experiences begin with the loss of his father during the Second World War, and continue 
with ridicule and abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother and finally, the breakdown 
of his marriage. All contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by 
a metaphorical wall.
