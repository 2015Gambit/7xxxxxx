,alllvalio,2012-02-19T11:02Z,"what is DRM-free? I'm downloading the game from it right now. but I have to ask, why I can't find this game with the original installer, like Recettear =/ ? I'm looking badly for the full original installer, would seed it for months."
,KariChan,2012-02-20T02:00Z,"No DRM means that you can install and play the game without any sort of Serial, Crack, etc.
Most games that you buy and download from Steam and such, require you to run it THROUGH Steam, meaning it would be difficult to pirate.

I'm not sure what you mean by the original installer. This is the best you're going to get unless you buy it on Steam."

,alllvalio,2012-02-21T08:20Z,"@KariChan I mean, this torrent isn't the installer, its just the game already installed files, but packed into a folder. What I mean with ""I'm looking for a full instaler"", well... I want the installer of the game or ISO, like the torrent for a ISO of the Recettear (english version game released by Carpe Fulgur too) they have to download (I've downloaded it, ISO). So, still, I'm looking for the Full Installer or ISO of Fortune Summoners. I hope a good soul to share with us, I'll seed for months. Someone have, so please, someone share =/"
