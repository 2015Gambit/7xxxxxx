Nils Lofgren's new solo album release is a classic Nils, rock album featuring a collection of 12 songs. 11 are new originals by Nils and 'Irish Angel' is beautiful ballad written by Bruce McCabe that Nils has been performing in his shows recently. 'Let Her Get Away' is a haunting acoustic gem co-written with Root Boy Slim. Featuring rough, raw blues dobros and searing electric guitars to beautiful acoustic tracks, 'Old School' is classic Nils at his diverse best. Featuring the legendary Paul Rodgers, Lou Gramm and Sam Moore as guest vocalists, this album has it all and promises to rank among his best. (amazon.com)
