,Poggiali,2012-02-11T07:04Z,"Video is not smooth, it's breaking, like it is low FPS.

I have tried to play it in Gom Player, Media Player Classic, KM Player and VLC Player, and it's the same :/"
,limlayhar,2012-02-11T15:37Z,@Poggiali that's because your bloody wanker of a computer is too slow to play this HD video you fucking wanker.. 
,wellingbb,2012-02-13T10:05Z,Bad copy.  Not smooth.  Missing Frames. HD films are a walk in the park on my Gaming Rig so it must be a problem with this copy. Thanks
