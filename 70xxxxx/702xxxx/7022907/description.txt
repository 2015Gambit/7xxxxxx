In a news posting to the Evanescence website during June 2009, Amy Lee wrote that the band was in the process of writing new material for a new album proposed for release in 2010. She stated that the music would be an evolution of previous works and be "better, stronger, and more interesting".[5] The band played a "secret show" at the Manhattan Center Grand Ballroom in New York City on November 4, 2009, with label mates Civil Twilight. Tickets for the show sold out in five minutes. This performance acted as a warm-up for their headline appearance at the MaquinÃ¡ria Festival in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, which took place on November 8.[42][43][44]
Evanescence entered the studio on February 22 to begin recording.[45] Will Hunt returned as drummer while a second drummer and programmer, Will "Science" Hunt, was brought in to assist in writing but ultimately did not join the band.[46][47] David Campbell, who previously worked on The Open Door, was brought back to handle string arrangements,[48] and the album was scheduled for release by the producer Steve Lillywhite.[49] Lee later said that "Steve wasn't the right fit" and has since been replaced by producer Nick Raskulinecz.[50]
At the time the band began recording, the album was intended for an August or September 2010 release.[51] However, on June 21, 2010, Lee announced on EvThreads.com that Evanescence had temporarily left the studio to work further on the album and "get our heads into the right creative space". Lee also indicated that record label Wind-up Records was going through "uncertain times", which will further delay the release of the album.[52][53] The band reentered the studio in early April with producer Nick Raskulinecz, who has produced music for Alice in Chains and Foo Fighters, to continue work on their third album.[54][55] It was reported that the album will be released in fall, 2011.[54] Troy McLawhorn was reported to have rejoined the band as a primary guitarist after leaving post-grunge band Seether, but Evanescence's management later stated that he had not rejoined the band.[56]
On June 12, 2011, Amy Lee announced through her Twitter account that Troy McLawhorn was officially back with Evanescence and that the release date for the new album would be October 4, 2011.[57] Later, on July 11, 2011 it was reported by MTV News that the release date for the album had been pushed back to October 11, and that the first single from the album will be "What You Want".[58] The band recorded the album at Blackbird Studio, Nashville.[59] During an interview with Kerrang!, Lee revealed that the new album's title will be Evanescence.[60][61] Lee said that the decision for the title of the album was her love towards Evanescence.[61] Other themes are the ocean,[50] quest for freedom and falling in love.[62]
Evanescence performed at Rock on the Range in Winnipeg on August 20, 2011.[63] They also performed at Rock in Rio on October 2 alongside with Guns N' Roses and System of a Down as well as Brazilian attractions Pitty and Detonautas Roque Clube.[64] The band traveled to Europe in November to play a sold-out tour in the UK, Germany and France, with support from The Pretty Reckless and Australian band ME.
Evanescence performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert on December 11, 2011, where they played "Lost in Paradise" and "Bring Me to Life".[65]
The group was announced as performers for the 2012 Rock In Rio that will take place in Lisbon, that night will also be performing Metallica.
