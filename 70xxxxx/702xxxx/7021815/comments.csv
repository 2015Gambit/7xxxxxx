I hope you will reconsider.

It's sad that one person, a person being anonymous, is allowed to ruin everything for everyone else...

I can understand your disappointment about the torrent being uploaded. Unfortunately it does not seem like Anonymous is going to take the torrent down...

Also there is little I, and all others who wait for 1203 and onwards can do... Everything seems to be in the hands of Anonymous at this point? Is there something I can do?

I believe the best you guys can do is to continue with your superb uploads so that his torrent is of basically no use...

Once again, I'm sure I'm supported by all other downloaders of your previous torrents (except Anonymous perhaps?) when I once again ask you to please reconsider and continue to upload your excellent Jeppesen Cycles for iPad and PC.

Thank you in advance!"
