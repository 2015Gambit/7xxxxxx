MasterExam

MasterExam provides you with a simulation of the actual exams. The number of ques-
tions, the type of questions, and the time allowed are intended to be an accurate representation of the exam environment. You have the option to take an open-book exam, including hints, references, and answers, a closed-book exam, or the timed MasterExam simulation.

right-hand corner of your screen. The clock will continue to count down to zero unless you choose to end the exam before the time expires.
