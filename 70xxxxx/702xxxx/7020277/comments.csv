,zakimar,2012-02-12T11:35Z,"Murphy is hilarious, Stiller is unwatchable. And Broderick is pathetic and should stick to his day job of being Mr. Jessica Parker."

,ReVaQ,2012-02-14T23:23Z,"Fast download and the video uses .avi format.

V: 8/10 - Beacuse it's a DVDRip
A: 8/10 - Normal stereo sound
M: 6/10 - Totally ok film, not something to watch if you're looking for quality. But enjoying it won't be a trouble procedure.

Thanks extremezone for another good upload :)."

,Squanchy26,2012-04-01T23:35Z,"@Heyz00s Chances are no. I get emails all the time for copyright infringement on the downloads. Basically i do not care. They are illegally watching what we download, IMO they can suck it."

The people in the comments have no idea what the fuck they are talking about."
,Infinyte,2012-06-15T15:16Z,"Dont listen to these fools.  This is the first funny film from Eddie Murphy in YEARS!  Yes Ben Stiller can be corny but it was funny.  Definitely worth a view, plus it is a good rip,

 A:10 V:10 for a DVD rip."
,YourMomma59,2012-06-16T19:40Z,"I LOVED this movie.  Eddie Murphy was funny, but he wasn't the star of the movie so people who are expecting it to be all about him...that ain't it.  He was funny however.  The rip is 10/10."
,exosor,2012-09-06T05:37Z,I think this torrent is being tracked.......
,SilentMajority,2012-09-16T12:50Z,"V=10?  Where exactly? Video quality is SHIT, like an 700mb old dvdrip.  At 1.3GB YIFY is much better."
