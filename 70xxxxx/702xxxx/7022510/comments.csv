,danwat1234,2012-02-11T19:07Z,"I thought the blurays were 7.1 audio not 5.1?

Quality; I see that sins of the father is actually a smaller file size than the other torrent (1.97GB vs 2.4GB), why?

Encounter at farpoint is twice the length as the other two videos because it is a 2-part episode. But why is it only equivalent to 2.5GB per episode? Maybe it looks identical to you at that quality compared to the original bluray. It very well might be because h.264 is a good format.
Thanks"

,nelwyn,2012-02-12T02:58Z,"The audio stream says 5.1. They probably didn't record the show in 7.1.

As far as the sizes go, as I said in the description these are encoded for quality, not filesize. I didn't force it to a certain size like most people do. I set the quality as a constant rate factor and let the encoder determine the size. The size is based on how much action there is where a higher bitrate would be needed to maintain the set quality."

,danwat1234,2012-02-12T08:10Z,"Oh OK thanks for the clarification.

So when you see an episode from this torrent, then you see that episode on the bluray disk, is the quality on the disk noticeably better?

If so, I would happily seed a raw bluray disk torrent if you start it up."
,danwat1234,2012-02-12T08:13Z,"Oh OK thanks for the clarification.
So when you watch an episode in this torrent, and then you watch that episode from the bluray disk itself (both being viewed on a big screen like a TV), is the bluray disk noticeably higher quality.
I mean I'm sure your re-encode was lossy compression but I don't know if it cuts into the quality much.

If there's a noticable difference, I'd happily seed a torrent of the raw bluray that you start!"
,schmolch,2012-02-12T13:57Z,"Thank you for the rip, thank you for the great seeding. Im so happy right now. After only half an hour i can already watch the first episode. This is so great!! OMG the enterprise in HD. Im so excited. I feel like a kid again. :-)"
,schmolch,2012-02-12T14:41Z,"You guys rock, the seeding is awesome.
I get 2,5-3MB/s and am already at 75% after about an hour. I do not have this kind of upload-bandwith, but i will use my laptop for some energy-efficient 24/7 seeding.
Thanks again!"
,nelwyn,2012-02-12T16:03Z,"The blu-ray looks noticeably grainier. I prefer the rip myself because it looks cleaner with the same level of detail. The darker scenes have a lot of film grain. I've tried encoding without the denoise filter to maintain the grain and all it does is increase the file size about 2-3 times while looking more like the disc. 

I may do the whole disc if I get time and let everyone decide what they think looks better.  "
,nelwyn,2012-02-17T07:58Z,At least you guys appreciate this. I just deleted it from Demonoid because people are bitching about me using a denoiser on it and insisting that it killed the quality when it doesn't look a damn bit different at all. 
,RegPulp,2012-02-27T07:09Z,"this will not be a very good copy, (perception is relative, but when considering a good vs good quality decision, one should always look at encoder settings used for the encode.... and NOT what it looks like on screen)

me=hex / subme=7 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / ref=3 / me_range=16 / crf=16.0

a far better setting would be

me=umh / subme=8-9 / psy_rd=1.00:0.15 / ref=5 / me_range=24 / crf=18.0 - 20.0

and no Deblock!

NOTES, crf 18 would be just the same as crf 16 because of the other settings
(when using the more advance quality settings in x264 you can push the compression a little further without any lost in quality)

Deblock settings are too much

also if you use psy_rd=1.00:0.15 then this will attempt to hold the sharp detail that usually would be lost by the re-compression, yet this method is a better choice because x264 will attempt to compensate for the lost in sharpness due to re-compression, Deblock on the other hand actually sharpens the image instead, however if the numbers are not carefully calibrated to the material in question (this can take a lot of tests to do), then the image could become to sharp or not sharp enough.

although psy_rd use to be experimental some years back, it has come a long way since then, and many do recommend this method over deblocking. (deblocking is only superior to psy_rd if the numbers have been carefully set for the material in question..... but this would require quite a few runs to get right....and very good attention to DETAIL)

the deblock settings on this encode are quite HIGH THOUGH!!!

-3:-3.... that would definitely sharpen quite a lot (too much I would suspect)

to answer the question, the quality of this encode is far inferior to the bluray disk itself (fact), due to the inferior quality settings used in the encode compared to the bluray source, however the more advance options that get  used in x264, the lower the compatibility the files become! it's a tradeoff.
"
,RegPulp,2012-02-27T17:56Z,"forgot to take into account ""Animation"",

although the consensus is a bit hazy.... psy_rd for animation is not a good idea, 

I think it's only right to also post a quick tip regarding Deblock (so many use it badly)

-1:-1 for ""film"", 1:1 for ""animation"" and -2:-2 for ""grain""

this is a good starting point, but is reference only!!!, these numbers should always be checked first on the material being encoded (this is what most do not do)

one last thing to keep in mind about H.264 and it's deblocking filter, and that is H.264 is adaptive. If you give enough bitrate, there is less work for the deblocking filter to do...in other words, high bitrate encodes don't need Deblocking as much.

in my opinion Deblock in the right hands is powerful, but used wrongly....can have detrimental effects on the final output.....

i know i have gone on a bit about this, but when i saw the Deblock settings in this encode -3:-3!!!! i just had to post this...... far too many people use numbers in x264 without doing the proper research..

it's all here people, and really well explained.

,avetha10,2012-06-11T13:02Z,"Thanks for the torrent nelwyn, this is far better quality than the already available 350 MB dvdrips.

But i think the video bitrate is not enough. 6 111 Kbps (Encounter at Farpoint) and 4 531 Kbps (Sins of the Father)? The ideal would be 10 000- 15 000 Kbps for a 1080p video. That means a 4 GB/episode filesize (so 8 GB for the 2-part Encounter at Farpoint), but most people prefer quality over filesize at Blu-Ray rips."
