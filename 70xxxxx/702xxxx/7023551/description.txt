"Rogue"

Percy (Xander Berkeley) continues his 
plan to take back Division by 
threatening to kill Nikita's (Maggie 
Q) mentor Carla (guest star Erica 
Gimpel, "Fame"), the woman who took 
Nikita off the streets when she was a 
junkie. Determined to get to Carla 
before Percy, Nikita uses Madeline 
(guest star Alberta Watson) to send 
her a message. Percy intercepts the 
message and it's a race to see who 
can get to Carla first. Meanwhile, 
Amanda (Melinda Clarke) tells Alex 
(Lyndsy Fonseca) it's time for her to 
take back Zetrov and reveal to the 
world that Alexandra Udinov is alive. 
Shane West and Aaron Stanford also 
star.
