Used an unknown russian video source ( Hronika.2012.D.CAMRip.avi ) and MiSTERE[rbg] for the audio source.
Most of the work went into brightening the video while maintaining contrast. This was the best I could do with all the different copies I had available.
Audio was fine though I did do some normalization. 
Enjoy.
