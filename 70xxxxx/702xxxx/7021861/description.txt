A man with no eyes. No eyes at all. Two tunnels in his head ...Somewhere - some time - there\\\'s a tangled ball of evil and spite, of hatred and malice, that has woken up. And it\\\'s waking up all the old stories too - stories about evil old witches ...I Shall Wear Midnight is the fourth Discworld title to feature witch Tiffany Aching and her tiny, fightin\\\', boozin\\\' pictsie friends, the Nac Mac Feegle (aka The Wee Free Men).
