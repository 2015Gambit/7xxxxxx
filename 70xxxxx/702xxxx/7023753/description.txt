This is ONLY Volume 1! I don't have the other volume (I wish I did...)

It was designed for old Windows, but it actually kind of works in Windows 7 if you install the included old Quicktime. Really, the only things worth looking at are the videos and the text. I've dumped and converted the videos, but I can't do that for the text as it's a Shockwave Director file (I believe) and I don't have that program right now. I believe it's BOOK1.DIR or a similarly named file.

Note that the whole ISO (software and all) *is* included. You need 7zip to open the archive.
