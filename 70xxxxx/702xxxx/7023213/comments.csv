,5942B,2012-02-12T01:15Z," Man, 720x576 is DVD source. What 720p means for this movie should be 1280x544."

,phoenixx1218,2012-02-15T02:13Z,"at 87.5% going at ~3kB/s

been this slow since 85%"
,daqck,2012-02-15T18:01Z,"has anybody got any of your 2 uploads, are you going for the guinness world record for longest running uploads. 
if we get 3% in two days how long will it take to get this.
a week if we are lucky."
,starname,2012-02-15T20:41Z,"sorry for slow speed,i,m upload from a personal computer,but worth"
,starname,2012-02-15T20:46Z,"for you, all who understand:
sorry for slow speed,i,m upload from a personal computer,but worth
I hope to keep the torrent and pass it on after I'm done, thanks"
,daqck,2012-02-15T23:58Z,"thanks for letting us know about your speed, if you mentioned that in your post it would of let us know that we would get it, slowly but we would get it eventually.
any way thanks for this upload.
at 98.8% so shouldn't take much longer "
,daqck,2012-02-19T02:03Z,"there slow speed and none existing speed. we are at 98.9% a whole 0.1% b4etter off than we were 4 (four) days ago (i wish i could underscore and bold 4).
by the way we all have personal computers, none of us have super computers, a lot of us have cable or broadband, you must have a 56kb modem with a pause button.

this is whats known where i live as taking this piss, i will look out for your name and make sure i never get any thing from you ever again.

i also can't believe how tolerant people are as usually they are on your ass for not uploading for an hour.

we get 85% no bother, then a couple of us complain, then get 10% and are waiting for 1.1%, i don't know if you are, but you sure have the guinness world record for longest running uploads.

all i can do is shake my head and wish you good luck."
