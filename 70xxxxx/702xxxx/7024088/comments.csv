Can you do something with audio ... its generaly (also previous episode) low, but in action scenes its twice as loud. I have to keep my finger on volume control all the time!"

,cat_spoon,2012-02-12T01:08Z,"Thanks ettv! Yeah, he's no Andy Whitfield, but thankfully the plot started thickening nicely by the end of episode 2 to make me forget."
,KTorrents,2012-02-12T05:39Z,"Thanks for this! Hooked on this show since Season 1... To bad the original actor for Spartacus in season 1 died... in my opinion he was better for the role.
