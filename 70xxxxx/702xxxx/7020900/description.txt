Based on the legendary true story of the Red Dog who united a disparate local community while roaming the Australian outback in search of his long lost master. 
A beautiful film shot in one of Australia's most iconic locations that reconstructs a true tale of an Australian larrikan in the manner that these stories are meant to be told, serious, but with a nudge & a wink. It was refreshing that the Director (Kriv Stenders) & the human actors never tried to upstage the true star of the movie Red Dog (Koko), letting him become the focus of the story. 

Stars: Josh Lucas, Rachael Taylor and Keisha Castle-Hughes

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
