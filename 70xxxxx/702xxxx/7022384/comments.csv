,heffeque,2012-02-10T20:34Z,"@Brat001 ""Unnecessarily large""? I'd say 4 GB for a 720p movie is the minimum!"
,shinobiung,2012-02-10T20:50Z,"dont believe the noobs, any 720p video requires OVER 2.5 gig for a 1.5 hour duration. For it to be ANYWHERE NEAR 720p quality. What some encoders do, is use software to strip the film where there are scenes of low intesity to reduce it down to extremely low res, I seen a Lawrence of Arabia (720p) come down to 500 x 200p during the sunset scenes."

,Alesum,2012-02-16T00:34Z,"As others have said, NOT unnecessarily large. Learn your shit and don't complain.

NO error with the file. If your streaming to your PS3 it's most likely your network.

Didn't see The Three Diablos.

Will seed for a week min. Hope that helps guys.

Top quality and thanks for the up BOZX.

,foxra620,2012-02-23T04:03Z,"Careful with this one. . Its legit and all. . . but once you get halfway through the movie, it starts sending out connection requests to your service provider every 5 to 10 seconds. I know its the movie, cause when i close the movie out, the connection requests stop, and when you start to play the movie again the requests start back up. . ."

,b76aa1,2012-06-30T06:51Z,"@fisher8 and @foxra620 - Yeah, too bad that's not how tracking a file works.  The MKV container doesn't have the capability to ""send out connection attempts to your ISP"", nor is it possible to send a cease and desist letter to your ISP to get you cut off the net ""the moment you begin downloading"".

For everyone else - ignore foxra and fisher, they are the MPAA's stooges trying to scare you away from a torrent.  When they try to scare you away from a torrent instead of prosecute you for getting it, it's because they are unable to track the torrent and you should download with impunity.

This file is fantastic, great quality, and my hats off to the uploader and all the seeders."
