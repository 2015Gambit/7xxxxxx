THIS IS THE ONLY WORKING VERSION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.


Video Copilot Optical Flares v1.2.132 with Pro Presets 2 for After Effects CS4, CS5, CS5.5 (probably works in all AE versions).

Tested with Windows 7 x64, After Effects CS5.5 x64

CRACK by DC.


I did NOT buy this myself. I just found it from forums.cgpersia.com and since it\'s the only working version out there I wanted to upload it to TPB.

Please use this for only educational purposes. If you plan to use it commercially then buy it from www.videocopilot.net and support Andrew Kramer who worked hard to give this cool plug-in into our hands.
