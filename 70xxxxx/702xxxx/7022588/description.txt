DO YOU WANT TO MASTER KUNG FU?!  

It takes training, dedication, many bandagesâ€¦ and a few snacks!  

Po is finally a real Kung Fu warrior, but to become a true Master, he must dedicate himself to training.  Shifu has revealed to him the Secret of the Thousand Scrolls, and Poâ€™s awesome journey begins here:
 
(**NEW**) PATH OF PATIENCE â€“ Maintain your balance (and your composure) as Po gets some training help from his little mischievous friends. Be prepared, things will get pretty hare-y!

PAWS OF POWER - Train with Shifu in the Dojo, swiping & clawing your way through flying training dummies based on all of Poâ€™s greatest foes.  But watch out for the bee hives!  Theyâ€™re a major buzz kill. 

FEET OF FURY â€“ Scale the towering Waterfall of Agony, jumping higher and higher with the help of firework-powered chairs, bouncy bamboo stilts, and other special items.  Leap to new heightsâ€¦ or else itâ€™ll be one big belly flop below!

DASH OF DESTINY â€“ Run, jump & slide through the beautiful, but treacherous mountains above the Valley of Peace. This marathon of endurance training will help Po run like the windâ€¦ or just run out of gas.


KUNG FU TRAINING IS ITS OWN BEST REWARD!
(But there are plenty of other perks, too!)
- Unlock collectible action figures of the Furious Five!
- Earn special Achievement Badges to guide you through your training.
- Track your progress against other warriors on the Top Trainers leader boards.
