RELEASE NOTES

Inspired by the popular comic book series produced by Top Cow
Productions, Inc., The Darkness II is an intense first person shooter
that delivers a twisted and gripping narrative of tragedy, modern crime
drama, and supernatural horror.

Players will be taken down the brutal and personal path of Jackie
Estacado, head of a New York crime family and wielder of an ancient and
ruthless force of chaos and destruction known as The Darkness.

It\\\\\\\'s been two years since Jackie Estacado used The Darkness to kill the
men responsible for his girlfriendâ€™s murder. Heâ€™s been unable to shake
the memory of Jenny\\\\\\\'s death since bottling up his supernatural power
and now The Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack by a
mysterious organization known as the Brotherhood heralds the start of a
full-scale war and opens the door for The Darkness to reemerge, setting
Jackie on a journey to hell and worse.
