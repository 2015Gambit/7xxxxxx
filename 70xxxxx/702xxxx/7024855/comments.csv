[T],-Gabe-,2012-02-26T23:34Z,"@sgleder 

I'm sorry for you but the 5h version is pretty huge to encode...it will take tons of time for me plus the only subtitle would be Enlgish and Russian.
Probably I'll encode it but I think it won't be soon. Just remember me (if you'll remember) on Easter time.

Have a good time"
