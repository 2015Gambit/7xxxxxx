That's something plastic, that's printable, that will revolutionize the world by being made available cheap and to the masses.  Forget about those crappy 3D movie glasses all the kids are wearing.  Till I see those, I'm not sold on this 3D thing."
,.235.,2012-06-07T18:35Z,"Whats awesome is that you need a 3d printer to print these parts to make a 3d printer.
Anyone feeling generous?"

,NizzeH,2012-09-21T18:23Z,"Xerox officials held an emergency press conference Wedensday to announce a 
total recall of all Reprotron 5000 Three-Dimensional Copy Machines. 

Xerox stock has plummeted to a new all-time low since the release of the 
innovative device. Xerox hailed the Reprotron 5000 as a ""new revolution in 
copying"" when it introduced the machine just two weeks ago, and market 
insiders were certain that the copier would send Xerox stock through the 
roof. 

At a demonstration of the Reprotron in August, Xerox staffers made full 
three-dimensional copies of an Oriental vase, a bowl of fruit, and a perfect 
red rose. Reporters were invited to sample apples and oranges copied from 
the original fruit, though Xerox technicians did warn that the copied fruit 
might taste slightly of toner. John Thompson (inventor of the Reprotron) 
stepped forward to make a copy of a Manhattan phone book, but accidentally 
copied his hand and forearm. He quickly disposed of the highly detailed, 
frantically wiggling half-limb as it slid out of the copier's delivery slot. 

But Xerox wasn't ready for what happened next. ""We assumed that people would 
behave as responsible, thinking human beings with this copier, and obviously 
we were wrong,"" Thompson states. From all across the USA, reports have been 
filing in of the copier being used in what Thompson calls ""sick, greedy 
ways."" 

At a Copy Center in Austin, Texas, a couple was arrested for making 15 
copies of their three-year-old son, Jeremy, and then refusing to pay for the 
copies, claiming that some of the new children were ""smudged."" Local 
authorities were uncertain as to which charges should be pressed. 

In Union City, Arizona, Treasury Department officials are investigating 
reports of a secretary who allegedly copied a single bar of gold bullion 150 
times. A task force investigator stated, ""Granted, it takes money to make 
money, but we're almost certain that this action is in violation of some 
laws."" "
,NizzeH,2012-09-21T18:25Z,"
Xerox officials are also under fire from consumers, due to rumors that the 
three-dimensional copying technology is imperfect. Harold Butz of Peoria, 
Pennsylvania, made a copy of a common cement brick spray-painted gold. Butz 
claims he was ""shocked and dismayed"" when he discovered that the 
machine-made copy was 22-karat solid gold. ""All I wanted was a really good 
copy of a cement brick spray-painted gold'"" Butz stated. ""What the hell am I 
going to do with this thing?"" 

Xerox plans to scrap all the machines they are able to recall, but Thompson 
expressed concern over the so-called ""black market Reprotrons."" 

""Apparently some sick and greedy people discovered that if they had two 
machines, they could use one to make a working copy of the other,"" Thompson 
revealed. ""To tell the truth, we only sold two machines in all - to the 
Cappelli family, a New Jersey based Meat packing firm. These copy pirates 
should be aware that as with anything that is copied from a copy and so on, 
there are bound to be defects in the copies produced. We have no idea what 
kind of stuff will pop out of the slot when a person copies something on a 
fourth- or fifth-generation machine."" Thompson declined to comment on 
reports that hundreds of the pirated machines have a human thumb attached to 
the coin slot which constantly wiggles - the result of a person's thumb 
getting in the way during one of the original copier-to-copier copies. 

""Ultimately, we're not too worried,"" Thompson stated. ""People owning the 
copiers will eventually run out of the fluid that make the machine work, and 
we've taken all the fluid off the market. A machine can only last two weeks 
or so without a fluid refill, and there won't be any fluid refills."" When 
asked why people with copiers couldn't simply make copies of the fluid 
cannisters they already have, Xerox officials hastily ended the press 
conference, stating that they ""need to reconsider a few things."""

Funny history abt a 3D-copier !"
,Dracomial,2012-09-28T00:19Z,"The coppers smashed my father's printer when I was eight. I remember the hot, cling-film-in-a-microwave smell of it, and Da's look of ferocious concentration as he filled it with fresh goop, and the warm, fresh-baked feel of the objects that came out of it.

The coppers came through the door with truncheons swinging, one of them reciting the terms of the warrant through a bullhorn. One of Da's customers had shopped him. The ipolice paid in high-grade pharmaceuticals -- performance enhancers, memory supplements, metabolic boosters. The kind of things that cost a fortune over the counter; the kind of things you could print at home, if you didn't mind the risk of having your kitchen filled with a sudden crush of big, beefy bodies, hard truncheons whistling through the air, smashing anyone and anything that got in the way.

They destroyed grandma's trunk, the one she'd brought from the old country. They smashed our little refrigerator and the purifier unit over the window. My tweetybird escaped death by hiding in a corner of his cage as a big, booted foot crushed most of it into a sad tangle of printer-wire.

Da. What they did to him. When he was done, he looked like he'd been brawling with an entire rugby side. They brought him out the door and let the newsies get a good look at him as they tossed him in the car. All the while a spokesman told the world that my Da's organized-crime bootlegging operation had been responsible for at least 20 million in contraband, and that my Da, the desperate villain, had resisted arrest.

I saw it all from my phone, in the remains of the sitting room, watching it on the screen and wondering how, just how anyone could look at our little flat and our terrible, manky estate and mistake it for the home of an organized crime kingpin. They took the printer away, of course, and displayed it like a trophy for the newsies. Its little shrine in the kitchenette seemed horribly empty. When I roused myself and picked up the flat and rescued my poor peeping tweetybird, I put a blender there. It was made out of printed parts, so it would only last a month before I'd need to print new bearings and other moving parts. Back then, I could take apart and reassemble anything that could be printed.

By the time I turned 18, they were ready to let Da out of prison. I'd visited him three times -- on my tenth birthday, on his fiftieth, and when Ma died. It had been two years since I'd last seen him and he was in bad shape. A prison fight had left him with a limp, and he looked over his shoulder so often it was like he had a tic. I was embarrassed when the minicab dropped us off in front of the estate, and tried to keep my distance from this ruined, limping skeleton as we went inside and up the stairs.

""Lanie,"" he said, as he sat me down. ""You're a smart girl, I know that. You wouldn't know where your old Da could get a printer and some goop?""

I squeezed my hands into fists so tight my fingernails cut into my palms. I closed my eyes. ""You've been in prison for ten years, Da. Ten. Years. You're going to risk another ten years to print out more blenders and pharma, more laptops and designer hats?""

He grinned. ""I'm not stupid, Lanie. I've learned my lesson. There's no hat or laptop that's worth going to jail for. I'm not going to print none of that rubbish, never again."" He had a cup of tea, and he drank it now like it was whisky, a sip and then a long, satisfied exhalation. He closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair.

""Come here, Lanie, let me whisper in your ear. Let me tell you the thing that I decided while I spent ten years in lockup. Come here and listen to your stupid Da.""

I felt a guilty pang about ticking him off. He was off his rocker, that much was clear. God knew what he went through in prison. ""What, Da?"" I said, leaning in close.

""Lanie, I'm going to print more printers. Lots more printers. One for everyone. That's worth going to jail for. That's worth anything."""
