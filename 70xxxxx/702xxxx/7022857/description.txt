I take no credit for any of these files. I did not create andy of these files. I believe that the keygen was created by tsrh. These files were all found  from various internet sources and personally tested by me. I give credit to whoever created these files, wherever they may be. These files have worked for me so they may hopefully work for you. Your mileage may vary.


The is a very good program and if you have the money you should buy it. I know if I had the money I would have bought it.

Unfortunately for some of us that is not an option. This is for those people.

This is a very straight forward keygen but I have created instructions so that there is hopefully no confusion.

Instructions

1. Run and Install ROBOTCforMINDSTORMS_305.exe

2. Disconnect from the internet

2. Run RobotC

3. Click the \"Help\" tab and click \"Manage Licenses\"

4. Click \"Add License\"

5. It will ask you if you would like to do an offline activation. Click \"Yes\"

6. Run keygen.exe

7. Copy and paste \"User Code 1\" and \"User Code 2\" into their respective boxes in the keygen

8. Select the product in both the Keygen and RobotC

9. Click \"Generate\" in the Keygen window

10. Copy and past the generated \"Activation key 1\" and \"License ID\" from the Keygen into RobotC

11. Click \":Activate Offline\" in RobotC

12. RobotC should accept the license without any question

13. Restart RobotC

14. Click the \"Help\" tab and click \"Manage Licenses\"

15. If RobotC started without an activation message and you see a license listed as a \"Non-Expiring License\" you have succeeded

16. You can now reconnect your internet.

Once again, if you have the means please buy the software. The people that make this are only trying to make a living and have been giving it away for free to many people until recently.

I hope this works for those of you who need it.
