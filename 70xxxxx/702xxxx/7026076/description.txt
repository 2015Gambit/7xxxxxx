Doomsday.Preppers.S01E03.full.MQWebrip-AnalogueSrc-][ I Hope I Am Crazy ][ 07-Feb-2012 ] xvid avi

Ok this is the full episode however its still a analogue rip which
is only better then vhsrip/camrip and the sound got clipped
by a few seconds when stating stats its highly unlikely BS
at the end. which I think most can live without hearing..
they add that for liability and to prevent panic.
its like saying theres 1 - 1000 odds a quake wont hit
California.. while your watching this episode and the
ground swallows you up. still better odds then winning lotto LOL
so go and get your surviving kits and tin goods and water bottles
ready just in case.

anyhow
For some strange reason the guy is using a cam to video tape
it playing on his HD tv... instead of connecting the recorder
to AVI or HDMI or using the avi outputs of the tv ,, Im sure theres
a better way to do it.

maybe the reason for the lower quality and poorer sound is
so the streaming site wont delete his work under copyright (wont say the name so he can keep uploading
stuff if other cappers dont come aboard!)

its funny how some programs they leave alone of some sites
I believe they use copyright breakers for free promotions and advertising
right? double standards.

but thanks for him to get something up at least where other usa
rippers/cappers have failed

ANYHOW

work done.. sharpened it, and filtered the sound to improve it a little
and encoded it to standard xvid mp3 audio 640x360 1000 bitrate

enjoy and SEED!!! take it or leave but leave the moans at the door
