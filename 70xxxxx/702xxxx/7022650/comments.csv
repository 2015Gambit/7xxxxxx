,wallmartysec,2012-02-10T18:47Z,Come on ! Nobody is going to download one compressed file without knowing what books (if any) it contains... What waste of time...
,delendaest42,2012-02-10T22:47Z,"Is impossible for me to list the name of all books. I sorry, but I dont have time."
,UncleO,2012-02-10T23:06Z,"Thanks for the upload!

But on my system I can't handle one that big except piece by piece.

So, maybe 3-6 pieces?

But I'd stop everything else on my system for a big A A Fair (Earle Stanley Gardner) UL!

Thanks again."
,mantikor777,2012-02-11T00:20Z,Why even bother if you can't provide details on what is in this massive file?  You are doing a disservice with this.  I refuse to waste the bandwidth on this.
,delendaest42,2012-02-11T01:06Z,"As many people are asking, I will change the arquive. I will stop send now. I will separate the books in pastes and describe the books here. After, I will start send again."
,wallmartysec,2012-02-11T03:55Z,"If you are not doing anything bad, like viruses or so, you should upload them individually in a big torrent, no rars, so we can choose which to download and which not, like everybody does, few would go for the 7 gigs to really read 10 or 15..."
,burt007,2012-02-11T07:56Z,Don't compress them either rar or zip or anything. so people can choose the books they want even one or two or all.
,delendaest42,2012-02-11T15:23Z," I uploaded another torrent with those books. The torrent is ""books 2"". I didnt compress the books, they are organized in some pastes. You can look and chose the books.  i added more books in this torrent. I apologize for any problem."
,delendaest42,2012-02-11T18:25Z,"i will upload a new torrente later. Now, it looks that pirate bay is with problem, because I am trying to upload but it does not work."
