,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-02-12T02:39Z,"Sorry, I meant not enough *install* details...

Copy content from crack folder to install directory, and it's all done? Nothing more? To say ""Thanks"" we must have run something. What?"
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-02-12T03:01Z,"Like described:

1. RUN SETUP'
2. Copy content from crack folder to installation directory, overwrite the existing file.

It's also recommended, you always read the install.txt file included in the torrent!!"

,Td2j,2012-02-12T23:17Z,Thanks a lot Tom-da-man. Does work perfect
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2012-02-14T11:39Z,"It installed OK, but it would not work with the Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn DVD which fix was supposed to be included with 8163, said it could not read the disc because of an error. So I tried a 8163 version cracked by BBB but it would not install, because it requires .NET 2.0 which I do not have on this legacy XP computer. Finally I achieved success with CC's 8163 version, which installed OK and works fine with the Breaking Dawn DVD. So I gave it a good try man, sorry it didn't work out. Appreciate your effort nevertheless..."
,audioman86,2012-03-01T07:17Z,"Thanks, I appreciate the upload."
,timhart99,2012-03-10T07:05Z,Excellent. Works perfectly when all the other DVDFab 8.1.6.3 torrents failed. Thanks.
