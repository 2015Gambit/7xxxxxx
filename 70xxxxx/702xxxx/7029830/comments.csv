Since Obama was first elected there are now 3 million more Americans out of work. 6.4 million Americans can't afford food at some point in the year. 50 million Americans don't have health insurance. That's 4 million more since Obama was elected. The homeless shelters are full and tent cities are springing up all over America. Obama has failed and it's time for him to go. Ron Paul is the only hope for America."
