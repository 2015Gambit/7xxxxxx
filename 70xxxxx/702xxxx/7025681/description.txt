I was disappointed in this series.  It was a reboot of the original from the 70s, but the storyline had 

no real continuity to it.  Biggest disappointment was that there was no Tim!  The only thing the alien 

ship's computer would do was play music.

The Pilot of this series was never broadcast, and was similar to the first two broadcast episodes!

Enjoy...  

Thanks to all those who originally created these vids, whomever you are!
