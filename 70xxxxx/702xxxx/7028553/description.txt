Cool indie/pop band outa pittsburgh. If u like it support the band and buy it.


A strong writing dynamic and sense of humor are evident between the bandmates whose
lyrics indulge a ravenous pack of zombies, a fantastical Japanese dreamland
and other outlandish lyrical themes, all sung over catchy melodic hooks. For fans of
death cab, mgmt, wolf parade, bloc party, two door cinema club etc.
