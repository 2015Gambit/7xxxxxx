,bjmassni,2012-02-20T15:09Z,"Awesome!! Could you get some Gregg Hurwitz? (CrimeWriter, Kill Clause, Program, Do No Harm)? Or Some Douglas Preston and/or Lincoln Child stand-alones? (Tyrannosaurus Canyon, Blasphemy, Utopia, Codex)? Or some old Michael Koryta (Tonight I Said Goodbye, A Welcome Grave, Sorrows Anthem)? or old Linwood Barclay (Bad Move, Bad Guys, Stone Rain, Lone Wolf)? or Daniel Palmer-Delirious. Or old Joseph Finder (Mowcow Club, Zero Hour, Extraordinary Powers.)? 

Thank you!!!!"
