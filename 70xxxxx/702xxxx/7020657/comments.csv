,kraut58,2012-02-10T19:32Z,Just change the extension .cbz to .zip and decompress the file. You can do this on Volume 2 as well. I then use Nitro PDF Professional to combine all the jpg's into one pdf ...

How about you dont advise people to convert a quality Hi-Res reproduction collection into a crappy PDF.

If you wish to view it, use GonVisor.
Possibly the best viewer / tool there is.
