Requirements: Android 2.1+
Overview: C4droid is a C compiler for Android.



Root is not required, but if you have rooted your device or have enough internal memory, you can get C++ support, read further. (some comments about "iostream not found" are fake, their authors just didn't follow installation instructions).

Updating from lower than 3.0 versions:
WARNING! Uninstall this app before update! Else app will crash. It's well known Android bug (details: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1227).
You have been warned!

Result of compilation (binary) is placed in "/data/data/com.n0n3m4.droidc/files/temp", because sdcard doesn't have permission for execution by default.

If you have "Illegal instruction" error, using internal compiler (TCC), install GCC plugin, GCC supports softfloat (by default). Also there are some casting errors in TCC, if you notice them, use GCC.

Long click save button to "save as", long click run to run with arguments.
C4droid already has almost full C language support, so you don't need to wait when it will be added.
You can to write your own applications on the Android phone, and run them. This app uses TCC and uClibc, so it has full support of ANSI C and some support of ISO C99. C4droid can be used for educational purposes or to practice in C language.
