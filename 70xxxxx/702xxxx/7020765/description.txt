NOTES:

sources: 
26k video was ok for cam,but colours were off,touch wasted out,repeated scenes due to syncing method.audio was nice but OVER filtered or
should i say filtered wrong...but otherwise good,but just with ya normal cam issues.
NoGRP video was a small vob file with a small res of 352 x 288 and had 3 major camera movements and other issues.....no audio ( english )

Both releaases are badly cropped ....26k was cropped on left,top and bottom ....and NoGRP was cropped just on the right ..hence my reasoning 
for using this release for the main body of the video,that and its better Q :)

Workdone:
WOW ....where to start.First i encoded the small vob release we had,we took 10hrs +.Had to use heavy nosie filters and HQ smoothers to blend the pixels
as it looked like it was going to break up...also tweaked all the contrast,brightness,rgb eq colours,sharpness and finally i upscaled it,yes upscaled lol.
When we tried to sync it i noticed there was 4mins missing off the intro and just over 2mins later on around 45mins in....so for these parts i had to cut then 
out of 26k's release and save them parts only....also opted to use the first 14mins off 26ks release due to camera movement on the other release ...so in total
there is just under 17mins taken from the 26k release,the rest is all new video :)
I decided to filter 26ks video aswell as i thought the contrast levels were off aswell as the colouring.....
The audio has been given alot of TLC and then resynced to the video with have made ...downside there is that repeat scenes in those 17mins of 26ks release,but not 
too many due the amount of video i used.

Yet again i what to say it is badly cropped,but less than the 26ks release....now if someone as some glue i will happily clue both releases together to get a full picture :P
Oh also due to appending the files the AR on the 26k parts is off,so i could append it to the main body of our encode and thought adding black borders to keep the AR looked
shite IMHO.
Either way still not the greatest cam but better than whats out ...enjoy folks :)
