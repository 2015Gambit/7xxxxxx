Note: first 2mins is old cam but the rest
is new cam and a nice one here nd there
for a couple of seconds it will fall outta sync
but falls stright bk in soo you dont miss nothin
one or two repeated scenes only 1second each
no major thing but the rest is really nice and wid the
vid i jus did the normal saturation, contrast, sharpen
