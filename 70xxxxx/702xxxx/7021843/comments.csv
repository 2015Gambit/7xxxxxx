,dk4581,2012-02-11T13:25Z,"S03E04 ""Drift Problem"" A9V9  If you count the three part ""Heart of Archness"" episodes then this would be episode 7.  Either way great show, new season is awesome!"

,soupygbs,2012-02-17T22:39Z,"lol guys the ""Heart of Archness"" is a ""mini-arc concluding season two's cliffhanger"" and not part of season 2 or 3"
,TaiTheGuy,2012-03-17T19:24Z,"If you think you ALREADY have the 1st 3 episodes of this, or have already seen them, from BEFORE January, then you have what I have- 3 ep's that are mislabeled as S3E1, S3E2, & S3E3.

Go back & start at Season 3 Episode 1, because you might not have/have seen them"
