NOTES
============
iTunes dun goofed and released the episode early?  Oh hell yes.

Thanks ad infinitum to ZR for keeping tabs on iTunes, and for continuing to to churn out these high-quality MKVs.


Regarding web seeds:  I only have space for about 3 of these videos.  Older ones will be deleted to make room.  Don't forget to keep seeding!

PLEASE SEED LIKE CRAZY (That is, um, if you don't mind...)  Expect moar torrents from yours truly of single episodes, and another for the 2nd half of the season as the episodes come out; until then, I will continue to seed this and other single-video torrents that need it.

Enjoy your ponies, and don't forget to support the show and its community!  :D
