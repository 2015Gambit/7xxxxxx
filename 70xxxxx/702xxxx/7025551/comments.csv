,pansops,2012-02-12T10:44Z,"Fantastic upload 737pilot!

The iPad instructions are easy to understand. Thank you!

I use both terminal charts, enroute charts and Airway Manual and everything works perfectly!

I hope you and your team will continue your superb job!"
,imr147,2012-02-12T11:09Z,A huge thank you 737pilot!

,dementie,2012-02-12T14:53Z,Thanks dementie
,IFRpilot,2012-02-14T09:31Z,"Thank you 737pilot.

Does own-ship location on airport charts work for you guys? Enroute location is displayed on the enroute charts, but not on airport charts. Could have been a GPS accuracy issue, but the updates screen is not reachable due to demo mode.."
,IFRpilot,2012-02-14T12:16Z,Just noticed the 'show present position' for terminal charts in settings.
,imagamer2k,2012-02-14T20:24Z,"First, thanks again to 737pilot (and team?) for another great update for us...everything installed perfectly iaw the provided instructions. Great job!!


I have a question, for clarity...

This torrent is a Terminal Chart update and not a NavData update...correct?

If so, with the torrent labelled '1203' instead of '03-2012,' it could be a bit confusing because it conflicts with Jepp's numbering method. Jepp NavData cycle 1203 won't be available to the public until Feb-28, with an Eff. Date of Mar-08, while Terminal Chart cycle 03-2012 was issued Feb-03 and is valid through Feb-16.

http://ww1.jeppesen.com/support/final/update-schedule.jsp


Just want maximum clarity for the end-user, I suppose, since there's no way, in-app, to verify what's actually installed, without checking for the presence (or absence) of specific procedures that are known to have been changed, using the Chart Change Notice.

,737pilot,2012-02-15T00:38Z,"The team releases the torrent based on the availability of the terminal chart update, but it includes the most recently released enroute data and manuals.  This isn't really Navdata, so I'm not sure that the Navdata cycle numbering would be appropriate. Jepp updates the iPad enroute data on a two-week cycle, and sometimes more often (maybe to correct an error?)."
,V1RotateV2,2012-02-15T15:38Z,"It works perfectly, both PC and iPad.

Thanks a lot!!"
,V1RotateV2,2012-02-15T15:41Z,"It works perfectly, both PC and iPad.

Will seed as much as I can.

Thanks a lot."
,olympica,2012-02-16T16:35Z,"Every time I load cd1-2 I have and different fault code mostly I have (missing variation reinstall cd) when I load the flightedeck or jeppview .I donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t burn cd I mount it via magic iso and I wander if this is a problem. Please notify if you know
Thank you guys you are make great job because this is a great tool for the Aviators "
,KateBBP,2012-02-17T15:20Z,Thank you so much 737pilot.
,icepilots,2012-02-21T14:36Z,"Hmmm - after updating JeppFD, the little (1) still appears on the icon and options button. In the past, when both nav data and charts are up to date, this doesn't appear.

Are both the charts and nav data up to date for this or is one or the other an old release?"
,imagamer2k,2012-02-21T20:33Z,"@ icepilots - the reason the '1' appears is because there is an update available...

While this torrent is the most up-to-date available on tpb (as of the time of this post), terminal chart  cycle 04-2012 is now current, effective Feb 17.
I'm sure 737pilot (and crew) are working feverishly and will get us the latest asap.

Check the link below to remain aware of the current cycle:

,profodes,2012-02-22T16:29Z,"Hi all!,

First of all... Thanks for the cycle again.
Now my question: Does anybody have a working Flitestar?

I do have one but it has to work with a special player, that program makes a look a like windows XP. So I have to start that program first :-S

I hope anyone can give me a torrent link.

Thanks.
Profodes"
,goonre,2012-02-26T05:24Z,Any word on when we can expect 1204?
,zmaster007,2012-02-26T17:45Z,"I have the 1204 and the version is different. Now it's jeppview 4.
In place of one DVD and one CD, we have only one DVD.

I don't find every files to make the Ipad update. Maybe someone can explain me where to find it..."

,JWRBlack,2012-02-27T01:07Z,"1204 is on the Russian site. 
One DVD, installs fine on windows adds Jeppview version 4. Now I have Flitestar, JV3 and JV4."
,JWRBlack,2012-02-27T01:10Z,"Try to post a comment with a link to 1204, but just get a TPB 'database error'"
,icepilots,2012-02-27T08:02Z,"Hmmm - I have a Jeppview DVD for 1204 that is 3.9Gb and has the Charts in there - but no nav data that I can see.

Are the people that source the navdata for iPad just extracting those files from an iPad they get access to or is it extracted from the JeppView DVD somewhere?"
,precursor1188,2012-02-27T09:27Z,"To get the 1024 DVD link just google:

jeppview data cycle 1204"
,guymer,2012-02-27T10:00Z,"Hi
Does anybody have worldwide and VFR code
for cycle 1204
 Tanks"
,icepilots,2012-02-27T10:56Z,"1204 Codes:
Worldwide: 006OP25866
VFR Europe: 006OO25864
"
,icepilots,2012-02-27T11:27Z,"I hope someone who has better internet access than me can upload 1204 DVD. I'm stuck with 256Kbit upload so it'd take until 1205 release to seed anything :(

In other news, how does one get the updates to FlightMap? I've just installed JeppView from the 1204 DVD... Renaming the label to 1204FSFM but no joy."
,zmaster007,2012-02-27T11:29Z,What is the russian site?
,imagamer2k,2012-02-28T07:28Z,"@ snakekiller1x95

How about you read the 'ipad-instructions.txt' file included in the torrent? It's all in there. :)"
,JWRBlack,2012-03-01T10:07Z,Russian site is forumavia dot ru
,JWRBlack,2012-03-01T10:12Z,"dl X rutracker X org ! forum ! dl.php?t=3956009

,DAviator,2012-03-04T15:02Z,Does anyone has 1203 full worldwide code??
,IPilot,2012-03-15T12:55Z,"Hello 737pilot, you could send a new update of the data cycle 1205 with ENR for the iPad, which was not updated correctly and posted here in Rio de Janeiro has changed many waypoints and airways. thank you"
,777driver,2012-03-27T16:31Z,For those who can't view enroute charts on Jepp FD. Simply rename /Enr to /Enroute on your iPad. IMO it will be more useful if this includes enroute frequencies. Nonetheless thanks 737pilot for the work! Kudos
,jenks975,2012-03-30T15:24Z,"This must be a simple question as nobody else seems to have asked it.
After I have mounted the file and run it, i get the following message:  Invalid JeppView serial number. Please re-enter your JeppView serial numer.
Where can we get the serial number from, or should I not be getting this error message at all??

Thanks in advance."
