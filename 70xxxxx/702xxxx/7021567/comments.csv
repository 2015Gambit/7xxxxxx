If u want us to download ur movies and comment on them..u'll need to superseed it so that it downloads faster...Infact I've put all ur 3 torrents for download and only the 3rd episode is downloading at a speed of 0.2kbps..the other two have not even started the download though its a good 10 minutes since I started them..Am sure interested in viewing ur episodes..so pls open the  upload bandwidth if u want others to appreciate ur efforts..

Thx,
J"

Thx,
J"
