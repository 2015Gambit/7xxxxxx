Metal Gear Solid for PSP.

Official release of MGS from PSN store for PSP and PS3.

Tactical espionage action with Solid Snake. 
You take the role of an US government agent to prevent nuclear war as main objective.
My personal favorite MGS originally released on Playstation in September 3. 1998.
