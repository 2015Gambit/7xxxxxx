It suck when you have to use a converter ( stuck to do this with . mkv file ) but it allow you to transform the file the way you need it .

Don t if there are better one out there but i use winaviconverter ..check that"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-04-17T03:52Z,480p Blu ray version will be out in a few hours.
