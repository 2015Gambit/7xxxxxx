,BODUS.BMX,2012-02-13T17:03Z,"Hey, you must copy the content from the ""Crack"" folder to where you installed the game."
,xClearestghostx,2012-02-15T00:20Z,Hi can i have an explanation of how to install this game. Just for your future trrent uploads try put it in the description thanks.
,BODUS.BMX,2012-02-15T01:13Z,"Sorry Guys, will post in the description next time

1. Unrar.
  2. Burn or mount the image.
  3. Install the game using our installer.
  4. Copy over the cracked content from the Crack dir on the disc to the
      dir of the game. Install the redists from the \REDIST
	 dir as needed.
  5. Play the game.
  6. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT!"
,SaharanSpyTF2,2012-02-17T12:39Z,Hey BODUS.BMX please help me with installing the game because i'm just 12 years old and wants to play the game. Thank you!
,BODUS.BMX,2012-02-18T02:03Z,"@SaharanSpyTF2

You must download and install poweriso or daemon tools then restart you pc.

then you must right click the .iso file and mount it to a virtual drive
from there go to my computer and double click click on the virtual drive and install the game.
then you must go to the crack folder in the .iso and copy the content and paste it to where you installed the game probably (C:\program files\Dead Island) "
,Bictorb,2012-02-19T04:12Z,"Followed unclear instructions and game does not work. Nothing in the files is labeled (what is ""our installer""). Finally got the game to attempt to load after copying and pasting everything in the ""crack"" folder everywhere but all I get is error message ""cannot write in game folder, you do not have permission"". WTF?  Did anyone get this thing to work? If you did, can you post some real instructions that actually make sense? "
,BODUS.BMX,2012-02-21T02:04Z,"After You Mount to a virtual drive open the virtual drive and double click ""steambackup2"" (That is the installer)

Then you must copy the contents from the ""Crack"" Folder to wherever you installed the game

Sorry For Your Troubles!"
,stitchtheshredder,2012-02-28T05:42Z,after i copy the crack to the install dir and open the game i just get a black screen that never goes away
,xClearestghostx,2012-02-28T06:04Z,"Hi again, what I did was mounted with daemon tools to a virtual drive/disc then I went to that virtual drive and clicked that and installed it to program files in C drive after that I installed with the steambackup2 then i copied the crack into the installed file. Now how do i start the game and have I done this properly"
,pixelsmuggler,2012-02-28T19:47Z,"Hello all

I've almost managed to get the game to run with a bit of troubleshooting, but keep getting an error message every time I attempt to run it, saying: ""Cannot find script dll (folder name)\Crack\_x86_rwdi.exe"". I'm so close dammit :D! Anyone got any input? Would be much appreciated!

Oh, and thanks to BODUS for doing this, and for adding instructions."
,BODUS.BMX,2012-02-29T01:03Z,"@xClearestghostx

Yes you have done it correctly! to start the game you must go to where you installed it and double click ""deadislandgame"""
,BODUS.BMX,2012-02-29T01:06Z,"@pixelsmuggler 

I think you put the crack folder in the game directory? you must copy the contents from the folder and paste to where you installed the game!

Sorry everyone for all the problems! 

Let me know your progress and I will try to help!
You may also post some requests in the comments if you like. next uploads will be explained much better and not so complicated"
,pixelsmuggler,2012-02-29T13:43Z,"Alright, got it to work after copy and pasting the Crack folder to every folder of the game directory! Here's some instructions for those who are still struggling (it's what I did, but it may not work for others):

1)Download the torrent, and use WinZip (free) to extract/unrar the files.

2)Use Demontools (again, it's free) to mount the rld-deis.iso file to a virtual drive (this can be done by finding the rld-deis file in Demontools and clicking the mount option on a virtual drive created in Demontools).

3) You should now be able to find the virtual drive with the mounted image in My Computer. It should resemble the Dead Island icon. Double click it to install the game to a location of your choice. You will be treated to some funky ass music during installation.

4)After it's been installed, find the Redist folder inside the new Dead Island folder and install the DXSetup, vcredist_x86 and WMFDist11 files.

5)Copy and paste all the contents of the Crack folder to the new folder/directory (the one you created after installation), the Dead Island folder inside it, the DI folder inside that and the Data folder inside that as well. This means you should now have the contents of the Crack folder in 4 more folders (Newly installed folder, Dead Island, DI, Data).

6)Double click the DeadIslandGame file in the Dead Island folder you were just looking at in the previous step. That should hopefully work! If not, leave a comment."

I have a strange problem. I installed the game, but it does not make a folder of the game on my computer. It took the memory but I cannot find it anywhere. I installed it in my program files.
I cant delete it because it isnt there. It took about 6gb of my memory.

Help please?!

,mcrok0rg,2012-03-12T04:13Z,"hey if you run into ""you do not have permission to write in game folder"" or some shit like that, right click on the game and run it as an administrator, and make sure you paste the crack all over the place"

,mrpun,2012-03-13T02:54Z,"@Entertainment4Teens

If I understand your post correctly....the crack folder is in the directory you created on your hard drive.  To work correctly, all the FILES in the crack folder need to be in the directory you created, not the FOLDER itself. Cut and paste all the FILES from the crack folder to the directory you created on your hard drive and it should work."

,Witjes,2012-03-13T18:51Z,"Me again.
Please look at the picture. Does anyone know what the problem is. 

After I installed the game there was no folder created in program files (it did took the memory).

If I try to install it again, the program can see the map that is already installed. But on my computer it is nowhere to be found. It sucks, please help!

Game works perfectly, except one MAJOR problem - whenever I try to enter an abandoned building, the game refuses to load and when I close it, I see the error message '1 missing object found: Ryan_Q1_InteriorSpawnPoint [SpawnPoint1]'.

Happy Gaming"
,xStephen993,2012-05-26T05:29Z,Works Great thanks man
,trollowner,2012-05-28T10:54Z,"Do not download this unless you basically just want a demo, after a certain level (level 47 or 48) your game will not load anymore and dead island will stop running causing it to minimize and tell you so."
,LordoMilordo,2012-06-20T15:29Z,"Its work great. Unpack .sim / .sid files with ""Phoenix"" then copy crack-folder and play. All without Steam installation.  "
,lvlsswsl,2012-06-24T23:53Z,"to anyone still having problems:
1. Mount the rld-deis.iso (i personally use virtual clone drive

2. double click the drive that you mounted the iso to (alternately, run the steambackup2.exe file from inside the disk

3. this will prompt you to select where to install the game to, find a place of your liking and commit it to memory

4. Once it is done it will tell you to buy the game if you like it. At this point, go to my computer/computer, open the folder containing dead island (the virtual dvd drive), open the ""crack"" folder and copy the contents

5. go to where you told the installer to put dead island, and in the ""Dead Island"" folder paste everything you just copied.

6. Copy the contents of Resourcesredist to the folder dead islandredist

7. double click dead  islanddeadislandgame.exe, enjoy


====================
If you get errors about missing _x86_rwdi.dll

1. Make sure you copied the contents of the ""crack"" folder into the ""dead island folder, it needs to be there

2. Alternately, copy the contents of the ""crack"" folder to  the four main dead island folders (""dead island"", ""dead islandDI,"" ""dead islandout"" and ""dead islandRedist"")

====================
If when you try to run the game it says you don't have the proper permission/access denied/can't right to game folder;

1. Right click ""deadislandgame.exe"" and click ""run as administrator"" (windows vista/7 ONLY)

====================
If the game will start up but will only display a black screen (nothing else)

1. make sure your video drivers are up to date 

2. right click dead islanddeadislandgame.exe> properties> compatibility> disable desktop composition, then run the game

3. if number 2 did notwork, go to dead island  DI out Settings and delete ""video.scr"", then try to run the game

That's all I got, hopefully that solves you guys' problems. Happy pirating!"
