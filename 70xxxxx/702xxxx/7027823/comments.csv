Will not play back on any device I own.
Windows media would work, but no sound.
Quick time wouldn't play it, neither would iTunes. 
The several video player softwares that I have wouldn't play it either.
Finally got it to work on a flash to my x-box, but the ""unsupported file type"" error pops up and won't let me finish the last fucking seven minutes of the movie. You sir, are an idiot. 
DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

Seven minutes left after all of that unneccesary bullshit. Genuinely pissed off."
