 Dressed in Persian clothes, chased by hooligans,
 famous Indian-born Rockstar, Jordan, barely     
 makes it to a Czech stadium to perform before   
 a huge crowd. It was not too long ago that he   
 was just an awkward uninhibited collegian       
 wanna-be musician with a name of Janardhan      
 Jakhar, who was ridiculed everywhere. His       
 family wanted him to be inducted in their       
 business but he refuses. He is counseled that   
 music comes after experiencing pain, so he      
 decides to woo Heer Kaul, the hottest girl      
 on the college's 'Chicklist' in order to be     
 rejected by her and thus experience pain.       
 Initially he does face rejection from the       
 sophisticated and cultured Heer, but quite      
 surprisingly they subsequently become close     
 friends, and he finds that underneath the stiff 
 upper lip, there is a woman who is full of life
