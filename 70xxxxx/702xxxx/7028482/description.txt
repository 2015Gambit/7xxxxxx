   Raj is an extremely successful and highly  
   driven architect living in New York City   
   with his wife Juhi (a head hunter) and     
   his son Neal, 6. Raj has sacrificed many   
   things to fulfill his career ambitions in  
   New York City. But he is haunted by a      
   lingering feeling that he must return to   
   his small village in Punjab to make peace  
   with his aging father whom he greatly      
   admires. Will he make peace? What journey  
   he will go through? What will he, or the   
   whole family will discover?
