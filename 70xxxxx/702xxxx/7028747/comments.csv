,eleusis,2012-02-13T19:01Z,Sorry for the audio quality.  It seems that 2-channel 256kbps AC3 is the best Amazon provides.
,Centurion13337,2012-02-13T21:38Z,Thanks for sharing :) Strange file size though?
,eleusis,2012-02-13T22:39Z,"Yeah, everything is more or less how it came from Amazon.  I just stripped out the DRM and converted from WMV to MKV.  The bitrates are exactly as I found them."
,Man.vs.Wild-HD-720p-PLZ,2012-02-13T23:08Z,"At last, finally a Web-Dl 720p version tyvm for sharing"
,eleusis,2012-02-14T00:04Z,At last?!  It premiered yesterday!!  :P
,Man.vs.Wild-HD-720p-PLZ,2012-02-14T00:07Z,oh sorry i didn't mean it in a bad way i meant it in a good way that there's finally a good release of this episode
,eleusis,2012-02-14T00:56Z,"Haha no worries m8, glad to share this amazing show."
,Man.vs.Wild-HD-720p-PLZ,2012-02-14T22:39Z,i hope that you will be uploading the next episodes too :)
,herpaderpamerpa,2012-02-14T23:18Z,"I get this weird sound lag when I try to play it in VLC. Like the audio cuts out completely for a fraction of a second and then returns, and this continues throughout the episode... Anyone got any ideas? :S"
,Hakuei,2012-02-15T00:45Z,"@herpaderpamerpa : It's not on your end, and it's definitely annoying. I'm currently d/ling the CtlrHD web-dl version to see if it's the same."
,fcrulezz,2012-02-17T08:20Z,"Sorry but ""just converted from WMV to MKV with the same bitrate"" means that you degraded the quality (Web-DLRip) with no gain."
