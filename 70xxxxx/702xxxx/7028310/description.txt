Death threats follow and Michael Palin â€“ â€œthe nicest man in Britainâ€ â€“ has his effigy burned on his front lawn. Finally crazed TV programmer Alan Dick persuades Palin and co-star John Cleese to defend the picture on a late night chat show against the Bishop of Southwark and religious commentator Malcolm Muggeridge. Thanks to Cleeseâ€™s reasoning the Pythons are seen to triumph,winning over the Popular Peoplesâ€™ Churchâ€¦
