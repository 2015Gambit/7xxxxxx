There is now way that I have found in order to get in the game without actually buying it from the company who makes it."

,Alpharion23,2012-05-12T15:37Z,"Is it available to play private servers when you have this client? (I don't mean with this client ONLY, but with some other files from the private server itself)"
,Bnutface,2012-06-01T02:34Z,"If you've downloaded this client, you can play on one of the private servers. The two that I will be trying are: 

NewTeraOnline (mentioned on this forum: http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/405176-TERA-online-Private-Server-NewTeraOnline) 

and 

Anarchy Tera (http://anrtera.com/index.htm)

There are others apparently but these seem to be the most ""complete"" with the latter being an English private server, unlike the first which is in Japanese made by Russians. But I'm under the impression that NewTeraOnline is more like the retail than the others, though I could be mistaken. If your browser can translate pages, such as Google Chrome, then visit http://newteraonline.com/ and translate it to English. I hope this helps. 

PS: After my download finishes and I begin playing on either of the private servers, I'll return and post what I've found here."
,pkerking334,2012-06-22T04:58Z,is this the full game? n do i hv to pay monthly prescribtion?
,angbblue,2012-07-14T13:04Z,There are tons of private servers where you can play this game now.
,CawawaC,2012-07-25T15:06Z,"Did someone manage to connect to a private server ? Anarchy Tera haven't uploaded any files to connect to their server, and playing in corean is a frightening perspective to me..."
