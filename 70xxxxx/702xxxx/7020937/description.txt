The core GAMEPLAY resembles the classical single player side-scrolling genre, but it puts in place significant variations. All aspects of the game are actually designed to have a very flat learning curve, since it relies on core mechanics that are well known by players.

It then gradually expands to become richer as the game proceeds and characters collect new objects, equipments and weapons.
