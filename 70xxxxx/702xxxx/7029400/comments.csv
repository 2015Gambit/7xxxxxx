,rigmar_radio,2012-02-14T09:58Z,Thanks for the Video.   Size (ask any Girl) is not important...  But large is good.   Most people now have the bandwidth and the hard drive space and would rather have the quality than save on disc space and bandwidth...
[T],dylanlutchman,2012-02-16T22:49Z,"thanks 4 the advice but the reason i do this is for like people who intend to put in it their tablets, iPads etc. an not for those who wana look at it in a huge screen. after all the quality is not that bad and it will show perfect on small screens"
