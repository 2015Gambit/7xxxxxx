,f.kruger,2012-03-03T13:46Z,Thanks will try to get english subs for this
,anonomo,2012-04-21T11:05Z,"the english subtitles that are hosted by opensubtitles and podnapisi are google translated gibberish, also you'll need to change the subtitles format to be able to read them because the swedish subtitles are hardcoded. 

would love to understand this movie, anyone knows where to find decent subs?"
