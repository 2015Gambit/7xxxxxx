[T],[D],2012-02-16T12:23Z,The french audio is a DUB. Original lipsync of this movie is for english audio.
,dandeak,2012-02-17T20:06Z,"[D], if you have a look at the imdb page for the movie you will see that the actors are all French, therefore, the original language is French. English should be the dubbed language."
,CAPITALISTPIG,2012-02-18T00:29Z,Parfaite copie. Merรงi beaucoup.!!!
,slybunda,2012-02-18T16:05Z,"warning this in in some gay language, not in english."
,dandeak,2012-02-18T17:03Z,[D] you're right. I am sorry.  Lipsync is for English.
,Phov,2012-03-04T17:06Z,"Dubbed movies are stupid, just like anyone who thinks any other language than english is or uses ""gay"" as an insult...

Thanks a lot BOZX. Will seed."

,Indollia,2012-05-19T11:57Z,"As SP3FFC pointed out, this movie was originally french, even if it was originally meant for English Sync. It first came out in France and the very first clips leaked onto the internet were in French. When I first found out about the movie even the Wiki page on it was only in French.

I was first familiar with this about a year ago thanks to a clip on YouTube, which was the La Siene song, and it was the only clip of the movie I could find anywhere at the time.

Maybe I just grew fond of that one clip because it was the first I heard of it but I honestly prefer the French Audio, especially for the voice of the monster. The french voice goes from a lovely sound that's produced by Matthieu Chedid to a really creepy female voice of Sean Lennon. No offense to Mr. Lennon. Just found the voice coming from that particular character creepy.

For those wondering the original clip can be found on youtube. If you put in la seine vanessa paradis et m, it should be among the first videos to pop up."
