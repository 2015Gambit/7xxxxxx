
IconBox v2.5.7 MacOSX Incl Keygen-NOY

An update version of Iconbox, What's New in Version 2.5.5:

- Fixed an issue where the Helper Tool status remained "Needs Update", causing icon changes to fail.
- It is now possible to also drag icons to Boxes and Icon Wells when in list view.
- The list view displayed all icons in a grayish color, fixed that.
