How to Install:
Run Office.exe
Install (or upgrade if you have an old version of office installed)
Run MiniKMS as an ADMINISTRATOR (XP+Older: Right click, Run as, and select admin account) (Vista,7,+Newer: Right click, run as Administrator)
Select "Activation Office 2010 VL"
Choose 1 when prompted
It will now install the KMS service and activate Office. You will need to re run the activation every 180 days, but other than that, it should
work with no issues, and will update from windows update (if you choose to use windows update) without issue.
