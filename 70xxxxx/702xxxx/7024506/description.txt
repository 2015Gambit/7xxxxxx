Morbid is one of my personal favorite Black Metal bands. They split soon after their first Demo, December moon. It really was good too, I'm mad that Dead decided to join Mayhem ! Morbid was much better! Only 4 songs were released unless you count those same songs released as rehearsals. To anyone who is truly a Black Metal fan, you need to listen to these guys. Otherwise, run your ass back to youtube and listen to your Dimmu Borgir and Cradle Of Filth.
