If people are interested, I've got a rather large collection of furry comics that I have gathered from various threads or other collections.  If a comic is hard to find online, send me a message (if possible) or comment and I will check my archives to see if I have it.  However, due to the fact that I do not know if I get notified from comments, I may not notice for a while.  Thanks again for reading, enjoy the comic."
,SomeGuy2005,2012-02-13T15:37Z,What is a furry comic???
,Asalvus,2012-02-15T07:29Z,"I guess it's a coined term, then.  I consider a furry comic a comic that is sexual, mainly focusing on anthropomorphic creatures (AKA Furries).  "
,Sheepfancier,2012-02-16T23:47Z,"furry is male on female animal. bestiality is male animal on female human.

Other combinations doubtless exist. Animal on animal is Discovery Channel, as we all know."
