Still can't find the entire set list but I'm pretty sure this fm broadcast to reel to reel is lacking "Nu'Orleans" and Still Alive and Well which I'd seen listed on You Tube video's and Wolfgang's Vault but this recording still is higher quality and contains more tracks than either of those sites. Anyone that could provide any further info about the set list or could provide the missing tracks to add to this torrent would be much appreciated, Please SEED!
