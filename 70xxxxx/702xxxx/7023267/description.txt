BIO FROM PAGE:
THE NATURALS are a rock and roll outfit founded in Newcastle by the brothers Jolly. Picking up influences from all Ed Sullivan guests circa '63, they've formed their own sound amongst the beat-driven haze of the 21st C's laptop-induced, auto-tuned, preset-sounding music. Although The Naturals have cut their own path, their style is directly reminiscent of early Beatles, Kinks and The Who, consequently earning fans who dig this style of rhythm and blues. (We mean the REAL rhythm and blues)
