Chico and Rita is an animated feature-length film directed by Fernando Trueba and Javier Mariscal. The story of Chico and Rita is set against backdrops of Havana, New York City, Las Vegas, Hollywood and Paris in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

The Golden Years

All the directors were excited by the chance to capture a definitive moment in the evolution of jazz music. Says Errando, "It was the moment when new musicians came along like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie with a new kind of music, that is not for dancing, full of notes, played really fast, a music that now we call jazz. Then the Cuban musicians arrived.

Dizzy Gillespie has said many times in interviews, there was a moment for him that was very important, it was the moment he first played with Chano Pozo. Chano Pozo was the first percussionist that played in a jazz band. Itâ€™s a new instrument. He brings all these Latin and African rhythms that are very new for these musicians, and this new instrument also changes the way you have rhythms. The drummer has to play in a different way."

Adds Trueba: "You donâ€™t have to be a specialist in Cuban history and American jazz to really enjoy the movie. But maybe if you know that period and that time, then you can find some small extra gifts."

The art of Bebo

Cuban pianist, bandleader, composer and arranger Bebo ValdÃ©s was living in obscurity in Stockholm, when Trueba reintroduced his playing to an international audience with his film Calle 54, and went on to produce the Grammy-winning Lagrimas Negras album, teaming Valdes with flamenco singer Diego "El Cigala". Trueba agrees that photos of the handsome young ValdÃ©s gave Mariscal inspiration for his physical conception of Chico, but the character is not wholly based on the musician.
    
Homage to Bebo ValdÃ©s

"I think Chico is not Bebo," he says. "Chico is a tribute to all the Cuban musicians of that era. You can find things from Bebo, you can find things from Ruben Gonzalez, or this generation of guys, some of them stayed in Cuba, some of them left. Chico is both of these things: he goes to America, but then in the end he has to go back to Cuba, so he participates in both these kind of lives. But if Bebo had not been such an important part of my life all these years, then maybe this movie would not exist. I wrote parts of the script with Beboâ€™s music in my head. He has been a strong inspiration, and then our score is by him, and weâ€™re going to dedicate the movie to him. So the spirit of Bebo is all over Chico & Rita."

Towards the end of the film, Chico gets a new lease of life when flamenco singer Estrella Morente arrives in Havana, looking to discover authentic original talent for a musical collaboration. Trueba was able to persuade the real-life flamenco star, who has been performing since the age of seven, to participate in the film.

He says, "Iâ€™ve loved Estrella since she was very young. She has one foot in the 19th century and one in the 21st century; she doesnâ€™t belong to the 20th century. Sheâ€™s so profound and so ancestral and at the same time so modern. It was beautiful to have her as a real character and a real person in the film."

Recording the music

Fernando Trueba on his approach to the score: "That was a very important decision. The first temptation was to pick up some Dizzy Gillespie or Charlie Parker and put it in the movie. But I had this idea of using contemporary musicians playing the original musiciansâ€™ style.

Then I have to do like a cast for a movie. You have to find a sax tenor player who can play as Ben Webster used to play, or an alto saxophone player who can play as Charlie Parker used to play, or a trumpet player who can play in the Dizzy Gillespie style, and that
was very interesting from a musicianâ€™s point of view. To have Freddie Cole who is the real brother of Nat King Cole singing for his brother, that was really fun to do. But the recording was really complicated. We had sessions in Spain, New York, Cuba, it was a lot of work. We had duets and combos and big bands, we had string sections."
