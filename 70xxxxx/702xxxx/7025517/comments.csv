[V],phatwarez,2012-02-11T23:14Z,"Pregame here was basically the entire day Sunday. When I turned on the tele at 10am, it was already football. This release is already nearly 4 hours long anyways, I don't think much is gained by including pregame, the best ads are during."
,ElChristo,2012-02-13T22:42Z,"Great quality, But with mine, the audio and video went out of sync at about the 1 hour mark. Still watched it, kinda ruined the commercials and the half time show though.

Watched it on VLC player"
,Vulk098,2012-02-15T23:44Z,"Awesome! As far as I can tell, you are literally the only person on the entire internet who uploaded the complete Superbowl experience with commercials + halftime show. Thank you so much for this!"
,archangelsolrac,2012-02-16T06:46Z,Audio and video go out of sync in the commercials after the 4:03 mark of the second quarter (1:01:43 of the video) all the way to the end of the video. Downloaded it again and went out of sync in the exact same lapse so i don't think it's my computer plaing me tricks

Love the Patriots!!!!"
,mnamna,2012-03-14T06:54Z,Thanks but things get out of sync. Deleted it.
[S],randompirate,2012-07-09T19:14Z,"phatwarez please stop asking people to donate. if you want people to support you then you must find other means because it is against the rules and you will end up demoted and eventually banned.
I hope you understand

[V],phatwarez,2012-08-12T19:29Z,"To answer many of the emails I have received recently:

No I will not be uploading any more football games. I am very busy these days and I am unable to commit to a rigorous encoding schedule.

If you are interested in uploading your own football torrents or know someone who is, i'd be happy to share any insights and experience.
