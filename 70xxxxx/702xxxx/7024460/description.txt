Great DSBM! Trist means sad. There are currently 2 bands with the name Trist and another with the name Triste but this is NOT the atmospheric black metal from Germany. This is the Depressive Suicidal Black Metal band from Czech! Not a hundred percent sure if these are all of the albums.. There were a lot and many different discographies.. Also, Decided to use .rar for this one so if you havent already, download and install your favorite archive software (I Recommend WinRAR or 7zip) and just extract the files by right clicking on the .rar and clicking exract. Done!
