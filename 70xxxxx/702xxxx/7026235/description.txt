Deep Purple in Rock (also known as In Rock) is an album by English rock band Deep Purple, released in June 1970. 
It was their fourth studio album and the first with the classic Mk II lineup. Rod Evans (vocals) and Nick Simper 
(bass) had been fired in June 1969 and were replaced by Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, respectively.

Deep Purple in Rock was their breakthrough album in Europe and would peak at #4 in the UK, remaining in the 
charts for months. (The band's prior MK I albums had been much better received in North America than in their 
homeland.) The album was supported by the hugely successful In Rock World Tour which lasted 15 months.

Although this was the first studio album to feature the MK II lineup of the band, it was this lineup that had 
earlier recorded the live Concerto for Group and Orchestra. The album was also preceded by two singles, the 
first studio recordings that Gillan made with Deep Purple. The first single, released in 1969, was a Greenaway-Cook 
composition called "Hallelujah", which flopped. The second single, "Black Night", fared much better as it rose all 
the way to #2 on the UK charts.

In 2005 the album won the Classic Rock Roll Of Honour Award (given by the British monthly magazine Classic Rock) 
in the category Classic Album. The award was presented to Ian Gillan, Ian Paice and Jon Lord.
