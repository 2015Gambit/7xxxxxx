7and5 is a splicing of genres where New Age beauty, meets Smooth Electro style, with memorable melodies and hooks like that of a great pop song.
Building a new direction in instrumental music, based on the groundwork laid by artists such as Ryan Farish, Blue Stone, William Orbit, Jon Hopkins, and others, 7and5 is achieving new heights in song structure and production value rarely heard in New Age music.
While not necessarily interested in creating "spa" music ; which by design is meant not to evoke any emotion other than relaxation, 7and5 reaches the listener with a soothing ease, but uniquely applies emotion to the mix; both enigmatic and uplifting... making 7and5 unlike any other contemporary New Age artist today.
