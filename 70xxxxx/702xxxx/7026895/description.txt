Supertramp are a British rock band formed in 1969 under the name Daddy before renaming themselves in 
early 1970. Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they have since 
incorporated a combination of traditional rock and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked 
by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson and the distinctive voice of Hodgson.
 Supertramp were also well known for their prominent use of the Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone.

Crime of the Century is the third album by the progressive rock band Supertramp, released in 1974. 
Crime of the Century was their commercial breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, aided by the UK hit 
"Dreamer" and the U.S. hit "Bloody Well Right". It was a UK Top 10 album and a U.S. Top 40 album, 
eventually being certified Gold in the U.S. in 1977 after the release of Even in the Quietest Moments.... 
The album was Supertramp's first to feature drummer Bob C. Benberg, woodwinds player John Anthony Helliwell, 
bassist Dougie Thomson, and co-producer Ken Scott.
