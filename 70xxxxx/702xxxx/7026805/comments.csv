,clamo2,2012-07-03T18:54Z,"thanks, but it seams that this is not the official PDF version. its just a scan of the soft back. and you can't read some parts of this as the quality is reduced by at least 50% over the actual guide if not more. ppl when scanning paper back guides you must set the resolution to max and you also must use a full size flatbed scanner."
