[b]### NOTES ###[/b]

[color=yellow]Russian source had both audio line russian and english so we just remove first stream witch was russian audio. Source is not very good but this is what we got, added a few filters to look more better, smoother, brightness & contrast, sharpness, as usual. Look around sample for Q and thanks to all who appreciate my work....oooh i forgot...against SOPA :P[/color]
