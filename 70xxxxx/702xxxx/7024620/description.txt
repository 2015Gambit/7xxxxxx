The MalÃ¨ Atolls, part of the Maldives islands is one of those places you really should visit. It's stunningly beautiful and an ideal location to relax.
Covering more than 4,000 sqkm the North- and South-MalÃ¨-Atolls are huge but the actual area of usable land is minute, and most holiday infrastructure is actually build on the water. It was also sadly missing in FSX, something one of our best designers solved with Maldives X, The MalÃ¨ Atolls.
Even when the weather outside is dark and grim these islands will bask in glorious sunshine on your screen. As you explore the many islands in a sea plane (or even better, an amphibian like our Twin Otter or Catalina) you will see why this has been such a popular holiday destination for many who could afford it. But do take care, when the weather turns for the worst the lack of navigation stations means you could easily miss an island you were heading for and find yourself lost over the Indian Ocean. Of course you first need to get to the islands and that means serious long distance flight from any of the many airports worldwide that got direct connections to this very strange airport that's got an island of its own!
