Twelve Foot Ninja are a rock band from Melbourne, Victoria. They formed in 2007.

Melbourne Australia based Twelve Foot Ninja are independent and self-funded. Their music and lyrics are inspired by a story (written by guitarist Stevic) of a ninjaâ€™s mission to restore balance in a world headed toward self-inflicted catastrophe. Sound familiar?

Twelve Foot Ninja describe themselves as a hybrid of genres - metal, dub, yacht rock, funk and world music. The band has embraced the iPod Shuffle mentality and expressed themselves across genres - in the process they push hard on the boundaries of musical styles and credit their audience with the ability to embrace seemingly diverse influences.
