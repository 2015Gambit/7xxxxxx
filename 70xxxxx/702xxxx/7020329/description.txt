2004 Film out of Hungary, seems to be sort of a dark comedy, but based on a true story. Please see IMDB link for few more details. Also note there appears to be a Hollywood remake of this coming out in 2012 - but I figure that this original version is better.

The 2012 remake IMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/


Specs: 560x288, XVID MPEG-4, 25fps, AC-3 5.1 @ 384Kbps.


Looks like a good movie, I've only previewed it while fixing up subtitles and converting it for DVD (yes, it's burn tested) but I look forward to watching it. Video and audio are both very good - it's a nice rip. It was RAR'ed when I found it; now it's 2 CD's (unRARed) in AVI format, and a subtitle.srt file for each AVI.

Note that there were/are VERY few peers/seeders for this movie when it found me, so please share it.
