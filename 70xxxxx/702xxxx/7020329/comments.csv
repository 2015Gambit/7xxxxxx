The 2012 American ""Argo"" is not a remake. It's about the 1979 Iran hostage crisis. Ben Affleck directs.
This Hungarian 2004 ""Argo"" looks what might result if Guy Ritchie directed"" National Treasure"" on a shoestring budget. Still it's entertaining enough, I suppose, if you make those allowances.

Anybody know how to sew the two parts together without putting the subtitles out of sync. I already tried Mkvmerge, no go."
