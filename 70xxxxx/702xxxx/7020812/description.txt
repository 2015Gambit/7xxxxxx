-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fresh out of prison, Git rescues a former best friend (now living with Git's 
girlfriend) from a beating at the hands of loan sharks. He's now in trouble with 
the mob boss, Tom French, who sends Git to Cork with another debtor, Bunny 
Kelly, to find a guy named Frank Grogan, and take him to a man with a friendly 
face at a shack across a bog. It's a tougher assignment than it seems: Git's a 
novice, Bunny's prone to rash acts, Frank doesn't want to be found (and once 
he's found, he has no money), and maybe Tom's planning to murder Frank, which 
puts Git in a moral dilemma. Then, there's the long-ago disappearance of Sonny 
Mulligan. What's a decent and stand-up lad to do?
