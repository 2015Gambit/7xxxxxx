We bring you (for now) the full third season of Kavanagh QC
having just launched the complete seasons four and five. 

Kavanagh QC stars the great Mr. John Thaw of Inspector Morse fame equally
He s a man of real Irish spirit - French natured even - with the best Germanic
intellect to boot. Probably most at home in Australia I would venture to add

This is a look at the workings of the British legal system of justice
in criminal cases - even with an opportunity to see black staff at work
amidst such high standards as these, as a look into multicultural policy.
