I see only 64 bit related folders in the file list"
,Inc0nu,2012-02-15T14:11Z,"The package provides both versions, but you should use a 64-Bit Win7 anyways since some of the programs would not even install on 32-Bit, like Premiere. Reason: It needs A LOT of memory to operate and a 32-Bit Windows can only address 3 GB of RAM."

,smashn,2012-02-18T07:42Z,"HELP!!! i didnt do the host file right now, im getting a msg everytime i open an of the application . the product key is wrong how can i fix this"
,steven01463,2012-02-18T17:46Z,"To answer my own question.... it does seem that InDesign and Illustrator work!! Cant believe it, Iv been trying to get these for ages, but illustrator just shut down as soon as it started (loads of people had this problem). 

Adding the host file before install seems to have down the trick. 

Not sure if it made any difference, but this was installed after a fresh Windows re-install"
,sazzefraz,2012-02-22T16:11Z,"Works great, thank you SO much! \o/"
,x86,2012-03-01T13:55Z,Thanks man :-)
,ty_uppers,2012-03-03T20:56Z,Works great! Thanks a ton!
,subuthu56,2012-03-06T11:49Z,is it necessary to also replace the amitlib.dll files in order to keep this working? What happens if you are sitting behind a proxy? Any opinions or input on this? IF so who has a dll file and where does it go - in every directory?
,ob1amy,2012-03-17T22:40Z,"The instructions say ""Just make sure you dont have anything on your original Host file that needs to be transferred to the new one.""  How is this done?  Not too savvy, thanks for any help!"
,ob1amy,2012-03-19T18:04Z,"Disregard the previous message, I replaced the hosts file, followed the simple instructions and all programs work! The updates went smoothly as well (took a while, may be my computer). Many many thanks!!"
