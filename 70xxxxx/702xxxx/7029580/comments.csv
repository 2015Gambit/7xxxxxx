Can't believe how many people bashes low/no-budget movies on the web simply 'cause you can see that it's filmed on a hand-held or the CGI isn't Hollywood-shiny...
When you download a film like ""Dorm of the Dead"" or ""Death Racers"" you KNOW what you're going to get, and no matter how good the screenplay or the acting is, it WILL look cheap and tacky.
""Satanic Panic"" is a great example of a movie, with a (though relatively tiny) budget that is crap... no... not crap... CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP... ""Braindead"" is NOT...
Go eat your Hollywood-sprinkled, milked-dry, concept-ruining, pentology-crap and stop hating on people who make a movie for the lols and use tha intarrwebz as a great tool to let other people see their work, you pussies should see the made-with-friends ""crap"" Peter Jackson and Quentin Tarantino made before they made it."
