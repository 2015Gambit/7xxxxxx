,kwg1234,2012-02-13T08:01Z,maybe include DLC?
,ChiliNoMoreX,2012-02-13T08:20Z,"no dlc.. for what i've read only skidrow update brings the dlc, but the save path is different so you have to back up your profile before to use skidrow patch and continue with your saved games.. "
,ironballs69,2012-02-13T14:21Z,"Actually the ""no DLC"" issue of the Theta release was refered to the 30Mb version of the update....

I see THIS torrent is ~90Mb and it's newer - so it's stands a good chance that it does include the DLC.

can anyone confirm ?"
,KSking,2012-02-13T21:07Z,"Sadly this update does NOT include the DLC. Saddening as it is, we're better off looking at Skidrow's update, although from what I heard, it will mess up the game for those with THETA's version."
,ironballs69,2012-02-13T22:13Z,bummer :)
,spelonkar,2012-02-15T03:23Z,"I downloaded the Theta version of reckoning, used the skidrow update and is working fine, the saved game locations are different so after you update and recrack, run the game and create your profile again (use your same name), exit out, find your theta saves (i cant recall now but i believe it was User/public/games or some such thing), copy ONLY your saves (not the profile or manifest) paste them into your new skidrow folder, user/appdata/local/skidrow/102550 and has been working fine so far "
,spelonkar,2012-02-15T03:30Z,"Ah it was user/documents/mygames/reckoning for the theta save location, remember do not copy .profile or profile.manifest and the skidrow saved game location requires hidden folders to be shown to find ""AppData"" if your search doesnt bring it up"
