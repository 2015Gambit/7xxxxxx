The Dark Ages might be drawing to a close, but Europe is still in
 turmoil. Petty lords vie against beleaguered kings who struggle to
 assert control over their fragmented realms. The Pope calls for a
 Crusade to protect the Christians in the Holy Land even as he refuses
 to relinquish control over the investiture of bishops - and their
 riches. Now is the time for greatness. Expand your demesne and secure
 the future of your dynasty. Fill your coffers, appoint vassals, root
 out traitors and heretics, introduce laws and interact with hundreds
 of nobles, each with their own agenda
