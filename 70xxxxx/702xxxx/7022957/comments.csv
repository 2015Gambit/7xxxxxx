,BrokeRobot,2012-02-11T03:17Z,"icetgamer, I would use the other one, this one is the size of the demo, not the full game.  "
,nota369,2012-02-11T04:43Z,"idiot can't you see the word ""RePack"""
,BrokeRobot,2012-02-11T07:12Z,"Then you go ahead and use this one, and I'll keep using the one that works."
[T],azaq318,2012-02-11T08:58Z,"BrokeRobot
It's just compresed. So it's smaller in size. It works fine though."
,BrokeRobot,2012-02-11T09:13Z,"I'll take your word for it, it through me off because its almost the exact same size as the demo.  I also don't really understand what a repack would have taken out, other than maybe directx, seeing as how the game has no movies.  "
,GjustG,2012-02-12T15:01Z,the game is based on text files which compress extremely well.
