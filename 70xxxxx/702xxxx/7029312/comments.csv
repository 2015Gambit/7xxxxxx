,williamballs,2012-04-14T23:54Z,"beautiful torrent, video looks amazing

if anyones interested, the video codec is mpeg-4 AVC/H264, level 4.1

also i grabbed the English Dub (disney version) from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5446565/My_Neighbor_Totoro_Tonari_no_Totoro_%28RUS_ENG_JAP_FRE_audio%29__SUB

just used mkvmerge to add the english track to this video with a delay on the audio of 1550 milliseconds. works perfectly on ps3 when you use xmedia recode to put it in the mp4 and ac3 containers

would love to see porco rosso with this great quality!"
,mick_n11,2012-04-30T12:56Z,"Video quality is 10/10, as for the audio it is very poor quality and skips every 3 seconds. Audio rating 1/10. You would need to download a new audio track and replace the original one that is currently used on this version."
,telecandy,2012-05-01T22:39Z,"VIDEO 9/10
AUDIO 1/10
only download if you're in the mood to go through the hassle of replacing the audio track. audio is completely f'd up in this version."
,DarkLamer,2012-09-16T19:21Z,Audio quality might be player dependent: It plays absolutely perfectly fine for me with MPlayer. What players have you used when the audio isn't OK?
