This is my first little episode in a series of short homemade films about the reality of this world. 

Secret societies, war, poverty, oppression and many other topics are covered in my films.

I have used clips from other films and consolidated what i believe to be a concentrated version of many subjects. I do not sell or use my films for any personal gain.
