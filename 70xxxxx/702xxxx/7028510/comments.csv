,hp400,2012-03-29T05:25Z,"goto abgx.net and type in the name. it will show you what you need to do to fix it...

it says single bit error to byte 0xBA231B87 change 0xE4 to 0xEC to fix it...

no idea how to do that or what that means... anyone?"
,Tuetenpenner,2012-07-06T13:49Z,"Open the Iso in a Hex-Editor (I use HxD). Go to Adress 0xBA231B87 (remove the x, in HxD: press Ctrl+G, and type in 0BA231B87). Now you see E4. Change it to EC and save.
Have fun without errors!"
