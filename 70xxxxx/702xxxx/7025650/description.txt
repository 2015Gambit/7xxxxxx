This set includes all three Oh, God! movies.  The first one stars John Denver as a grocery store clerk that is contacted by the Almighty.  Of course, everyone thinks he's insane and hilarity ensues.    

I hope you enjoy these three classic movies, and PLEASE help each other to share by SEEDING after downloading!
