[T],solstars,2012-02-15T00:25Z,Nice try.  Can't have a virus in an MKV file you idiot.  Damn people are stupid.
,bryentheartist,2012-02-20T05:38Z,"then how come file would NOT delete I had to use unlocker program to get rid of it plus it would not play on 4 different players.
NICE TRY ASSHOLE"
,Zebady80,2012-02-21T12:44Z,"bryentheartist - you don't know what you are talking about. If you have a virus then you have it from something else.

MKV files can't execute code against a computer therefore its impossible to do any damage.

Jog on."
