ASAP's release has a total of approximately 3 minutes of
weatherspam. While we appreciate the snow report for KC,
the 720 rule is 30seconds and this is well over that. Obviously
they didn't pre the 720 for that reason, so why make XviD viewers suffer

Weather spam from 00:29-01:54 and 18:28-19:40
