NOTES:

sources: 

video is thanks to lum1x....video like his others have that rainbow effect,badly cropped,alot of camera movement,4mins
of total black screen around 24mins in,issues with brightness,contrast etc....
Audio ....some really nice line,just needed some more TLC.

Workdone:

Took the sors of lum1x and gave it some TLC,changing the brightness,contrast,chroma,rgb colours...also used a HQ smoother and
finally changes the AR.
Audio we took off sic's release and dropped in AA and ran a hiss removal and then changed the EQ settings and then remuxed to our rip.
From there i opted to remove that 4mins of just a black screen as IMHO thought it was pointless....but each to their own on that one.

Overall v 6 a 7.5 IMHO
