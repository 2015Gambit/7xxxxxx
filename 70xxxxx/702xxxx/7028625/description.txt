If you don\\\'t know what this book is about, you probably aren\\\'t looking for it.  I had a terrible time finding it anywhere on the net, but Demonoid did have a copy with very few seeders, so I felt it needed exposure on Pirate Bay and here it is, courtesy of lyrumusx (his Demonoid user name, that\\\'s all I know!).  He deserves some serious credit, he spent a lot of time and thrashed his original copy to scan it in so that we could all benefit the read.  So many thanks to lyrumusx and enjoy.
