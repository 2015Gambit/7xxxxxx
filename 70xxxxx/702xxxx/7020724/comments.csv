,Bz95,2012-02-09T23:12Z,Is there gore? 
,Bz95,2012-02-09T23:15Z,Cant wait for this game :D I was so gutted without the gore if i had the money i would buy it just to support the companies  
,shauwy,2012-02-09T23:18Z,"Thanx man ;)

,shauwy,2012-02-10T00:22Z,no gore too bad :(
,champi128,2012-02-10T01:17Z,It was already goddamn time Skidrow! Nah I'm just kidding. Thx for the release and cheers from Mexico :-)
,champi128,2012-02-10T01:20Z,Hey what happened to my other comment? I was kidding guys! I'm downloading and I'm going to comment as soon as a play the game.
,MidnightRob,2012-02-10T01:54Z,This is just utterly fucking ridiculous. It seems I will have to wait... wanted to see if my system could run this first but after downloading the precious steam unlocked version (just to find out it didn't run) I know am in the process of downloading this at 54kbs!!! I wanted to see how the crack was compiled to see if the no gore issue could be fixed but now i'm just pissed and will wait a couple weeks until this is worked out.  
,BrianFantana1234,2012-02-10T02:12Z,No gore again. Why is this not commented on in the details. 6gb for no real reason. Thanks anyway.
,champi128,2012-02-10T02:53Z,No gore for real? Well that sucks... I'm still downloading it but what I'm going to do is wait for an update from Skidrow or maybe some other team and see if they can figure out how to enable the gore stuff!
,r083r73h,2012-02-10T03:25Z,"There's plenty of gore and violence, release works like a charm. Relax guys. "

,jagblade,2012-02-10T07:10Z,"So before I waste anymore hours downloading this, I want a STRAIGHT yes or no answer. Is this just a lazy republish of a previous iso and crack without gore or is it an actual Skidrow release from scratch with a working full crack and actual gore?"
,MrMustachio,2012-02-10T07:55Z,"jagblade, this is the censored version. while there's still some amount of blood splatter there's no tearing of limbs, crushing of heads or any other nasty stuff  "

,Matak12,2012-02-10T11:45Z,"man why dont you guys go and buy the game and support the company? stop being fucking scum, you guys complain when pple leech after downloading, but you hypocrites are the real leeches, leeching of 2k Games By Illegally downloading there games without paying a dime, and dont bs you cant afford it, you can afford a computer and a monthly internet connection to download these things shit man."
,Sulifer,2012-02-10T12:11Z,@Matak12 I torrent the games because I dont agree with how much they charge for them. £30-£40 each is a ripoff especially as they usually only last 6-8 hours before ur finished with the campaign. Fact is if torrents did not exist I (like most others here) just would not bother playing the games at all.
,Homeoplasmine,2012-02-10T12:12Z,"Well, no gore is actually desirable I find; I won't buy the game then because I dont want the useless gore used to attract bored teenagers.
these sort of games are what is wrong with the industry in general; i'll probably play this 1 hour or so before getting bored and no amount of gore would fix that. in fact it may actually make me want to play it less.
Gore is a cheap card to play to get more sales...
I support companies that actually produce new things and dont just do what sells ad-nauseum. "
,slaneesh,2012-02-10T13:36Z,"@Sulifer

,boogeyman112,2012-02-11T02:02Z,Hey thanks for the game i never used to download games because i didnt understand the install with the crack folder and all that but i'm in love with it BTW its not gore you have to download the 4.4 mb gore fix and why so many leechers jesus 
,Zo0onk,2012-02-11T02:14Z,"heey guys, if i try to install the game it asks me for an activation key. Then i try to unrar the keygen.rar but i need a password. What to do now ?"
,jackofblads,2012-02-11T02:54Z,"yeah im having the same problem. i downloaded it, mounted it, and did the setup but now it asks for an activation key and the keygen is password protected. I even went to both the links and filled out these very annoying long surveys that gave me a password that didnt work when i entered it to unlock the keygen. What am i doing wrong here? thx for replies "
,jgato88,2012-02-11T03:47Z,Is this the real skidrow release? I have found here a skidrow release with 7.23 GB. Can someone confirm this???
,jackofblads,2012-02-11T03:57Z,so do i need a keygen for my keygen? XD can't wait to play this game but can't get past the activation key
,jgato88,2012-02-11T04:07Z,Is this the real skidrow release? I have found here a skidrow release with 7.23 GB. Can someone confirm this??? 
,jackofblads,2012-02-11T04:15Z,well it is extremezone that uploaded it and it has people saying it works and +23 rating so i would imagine it is the real deal. ill confirm once i get it working too. Be careful with those 'surveys' that want you to download stuff like realplayer. virus protection didnt like it lol might be a false positive but still not worth the risk. and passwords you get from links dont actually unlock the keygen either
,chase6342,2012-02-11T04:20Z,"looks fucking bad ass, will seed if its good"
,champi128,2012-02-11T05:02Z,Damn it! My download speed is 5 kB/s... C'mon!
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T05:51Z,DO NOT LISTEN TO - JJames187.  if it asks for a password or to do the survey you haven't read the instructions for whatever reason...most ppl here are sooooo stupid..
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T05:52Z,don't listen to JJames187- he hasn't followed the instructions.. why are ppl so stupid here...THANKS EXTREMEZONE.  your the best..
,jackofblads,2012-02-11T06:09Z,"im in no way agreeing with james. but it does ask me for a key. i downloaded and mounted like it said and started the setup.exe like it said but it asks for an activation key and there is a keygen in the SKIDROW folder but it cannot be used with out another password. just stating what it is telling me. i will try to download again but just because some people got different results does not mean they are ""stupid"" obviously multiple people got the same issue. I watched videos on the installation to make sure i wasnt doing anything they were'nt and when they installed it did not ask for an activation key so i believe that it is working and you dont need a key, but for some reason it asks some of us for one. maybe files got re-uploaded and new version works? "
,dubai1991,2012-02-11T07:12Z,to all the stupid morons out here....it is the real version...and works flawlessly..and thrs no such bullshit keygens and stupid stuffs...EXTREMEZONE is the best trusted uploader in TPB...!!!
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T07:15Z,"The MOST IMPORTANT THING is to copy whats in the skidrow folder into the installation directory..In your process you didn't write that you did that even?? I said most ppl are stupid yeah, because it says in the instructions to copyu over the files in the skidrow folder to the main installation folder..Hey you might be the minority of smart ppl but did you copy what was in the skidrow folder within the main image??"
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T07:17Z,YOu must copy the files in skidrow over to the main directory before you start the .exe.files..if it asks for a serial just cancell it.. and copy (not install again) the files in that.. sorry to repeat myself but wanna be clear for ya..trying to help..
,khaosdvorak,2012-02-11T07:34Z,"I can confirm I cannot install the game as well. It asks for a product key. I am guessing this has something to do with steam being installed on my computer. Until a fix is available, I can't even install!"
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T07:47Z,"I'll try and dumb it down again for ya's.. Mount and install..(DO NOT START ANYTHING YET!!) then go into the main image (using daemon tools, e.t.c.) and look for the skidrow folder. Then, Copy (Ctrl c) all the files in there ((DO NOT START THE KEY GEN) the files will activate it automatically when the game starts)) then open you main folder where it was installed to. Then Paste it (Ctrl v) in that folder.. then select Copy and replace if/when it asks. then open properties of the main .exe file, and select always run as administrator.. it runs perfectly with no keygen or passwordd.. not one of you that are having problems have written that you've copied whats in the skidrow folder to the main directory so yes, you guys are ignorant, really young or 'stupid""...sorry, read the instructions.."
,xxela,2012-02-11T08:05Z,"@jackofblads maybe you downloaded another torrent because in this is no such tights like KEYGEN file, is just a SKIDROW folder and another 6 files.
NO KEYGEN FILE"

,kar269,2012-02-11T10:08Z,"Timbo6669....I'm not sure why you and the other person have to get so angry with members who are merely trying to find a fix to their problem. I've been coming on this site for years and this is the first comment I've ever made while using torrents. The game did indeed ask me for an activation code as well. The last thing jackofblads said is exactly what I believe is the case as well. What you seem to fail to grasp however, is that we cannot complete the installation due to the fact that it asked us for an activation code, should you not enter a correct one, the installation cancels. Someone please help me with this problem."
,scyris99,2012-02-11T10:08Z,"I am having an issue and its most likely something on my end and not with the release itself, for some reason in game all I can see is the menu when you hit escape, and when I hit escape it flashes the ingame graphics for a second them goes back to the menu. ANy idea what I may do to fix this? Again I assume this is probally something on my pc, because I have never, ever had an issue with a extremezone release till now. I did notice the dx drivers for this release aren't on the disc, so I assume I might need those. Gonna try the dx web update and see if that fixes it."

Would appreciate an answer!"
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T10:46Z,Kar269- sorry if appeared 'angry' to you..I did get annoyed at james's comments because i've also been downloading/uploading for years and extremezone always puts the best working torrents and cracks.. I always come here and see ppl having trouble but no-one explains the process of what they're doing. I used to have trouble at the begining with cracked games but i learnt and really get pissed off when ppl try and blame the Hackers.. Tell me if you copied the skidrow folder files into your main directory after you installed then i might be able to help..everyone saysthey're having trouble and blames everyone else when it's ignorance simply..and i really want to help.. this torrent rocks and i can't sit by and let ppl defame extremezone.. 
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T10:50Z,"sorry if i appear angry but it's really simple once you know what your doing.. Try and look at youtube for instructions if your stuck.. Unpack, Mount, install, copy cracked folder, replace files, launch.. i installed it twice now with no probs so i need more info on what you guys are doin? i just don't understand.. maybe some cpu won't run it ??i dunno but this torrent is aweome"
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T10:53Z,"Scyris - have you opened up the properties of the .exe file (after you copied the skidrow folder over and replaced the original .exe file), go to the compatability tab and check the 'run as administrator' is ticked..maybe that'll help you.. i used to get that problem couple years back and that was the fix..maybe for you too?"
,Timbo6669,2012-02-11T10:57Z,try password - skidrow.com found someone who thinks he knows it on another site and also try upper case as well for the 'S'....not sure how reliable that is but...

,jackofblads,2012-02-11T14:39Z,nah i think it was an issue with an earlier version of the game. i downloaded it when it first got uploaded to the site but they have released several things since then so i might just have the wrong version. im almost finished downloading this torrent again tho so hopefully there is no keys or passwords. And as for termic i completed offers on both included links and got the passwords but they did not unlock the keygen. if i were you i would try downloading again possibly? ill let you guys know if it works. at 65% now

,jackofblads,2012-02-11T16:48Z,"ok people, since no one has answered this common question i have spent the last day downloading this torrent again and it seems that either the earlier download was from someone else or the files have been updated.

The version that asks for the key doesnt work because even if you complete the online surveys it either makes you fill out more or gives you a password that does not unlock the rar keygen. To fix this just download the torrent again and get rid of the old iso. MAKE SURE IT IS THIS TORRENT. idk if other torrents will work the same. the 6.06-6.07 GB versions seem to work while the versions over 7 GB seem to ask for a key that is unobtainable. "

Maybe..it's that or what Jackofblads said.."
,Timbo6669,2012-02-12T00:19Z,"To be a bit clearer, (sorry my grammer aint that good)..SOmetimes i select numerous torrents of the same program and see which one downloads fastest and has more seeds.. but bitcomet or emule for excample will mix files and downlpad the easiest file..if files have the same name it will mix files between torrents and end product?  a mix of different torrents into one final..I'd even delete your torrent history to make sure there is no 'darklness 2' files savedand hidden..make sense?? sorry i aint that smart either jackofblods..i admit that.."
,Emo_Enthusiast,2012-02-12T00:43Z,"Hey guys, I don't think I explained my problem very well so here goes. Just got it installed and hit start new game,( I picked Hitman difficulty) and watched the ""before the Darkness 2"" cinematic with the skinny mob guy. That runs fine but after that's all done it it tries to bring me to the actual game it does that purple swirly thing which I guess means it's loading. So I sit there and let it do its thing and after about 5-10 minutes of just doing the swirly thing the game abruptly ends and I'm back at the desktop. I would greatly appreciate any help :)"
,artw0rk,2012-02-12T01:18Z,"Game works fine.

people having problem with the game are just not following the install instructions...

Ignore the stupid keygen shit you don't need it, just follow the directions. Mount the game, install, then dl the crack or the gore patch and copy everything in the skidrow folder in the crack or gore patch folder and put them in the root folder of the darkness 2.

Thanks a lot extremezone, great upload, cept for the dl speeds...other then that game works great gore and all :)

,jgato88,2012-02-12T01:37Z,"Everything is fine with this torrent, just followed the instructions and game works!!! There is no keygen in this too! I had problems with a keygen but that was another torrent i downloaded from here. A release apparently from skidrow with 7.23 GB of size with a different installer that asked me for a product key and since the keygen was in a password protected rar file, i just couldn't install it. So people use this one! Cheers!"
,simolino,2012-02-12T01:54Z,"Why is this game censored, its because its a european version ins't it.Well at least we know where skidrow is from...they are somewhere in europe. I noticed that since I got The Witcher 2, the Namco Bandai Shit is Europe only. Atari is North America.My other guess is they took the gore out on purpose to deter piracy..."
,simolino,2012-02-12T01:57Z,Fucken dupes dude you don't need no fucken Daemon tools or alchohol 120. All you do is extract the ISO file with Winrar to a folder and install from there. You don't need to burn it or none of that dumb shit.
,jackofblads,2012-02-12T05:18Z,@jgato and artwork. people are following the install instructions and they arent stupid. people that downloaded an earlier version do have a keygen that wont work and do require an activation key. if you download this now there is no problems but there were problems when the game was first uploaded to TPB. People keep saying these people are stupid or not reading instructions but the truth is they are doing everything right but just have a different version like i stated before. If you have the 7GB version that was released before all the fixes and changes it needs an activation key but now this torrent does not. they arent doing anything wrong they just need to download again
,champi128,2012-02-12T05:53Z,"Ok... So I already finished the download(which was a pain in the ass). Installation went great. Now when I try to play the game I have no sound. When I go to options > audio, I see that I have an undefined device. What can I do?"
,Nocomment555,2012-02-12T08:11Z,"To those of you have problem installing this game heres how:

1. download this torrent, and then mount or burn the ISO file using any burning apps (me im using power iso)
2. after you mount or burn, look for the set-up exe file and run it to install the game.
3. Once install, dont run the game, go to your directory ( c:program files(x86)/2k games/darkness 2.
4. open again the iso file that you burn or mounted, and look for the skidrow folder and click it to see the files.
5. highlights all the files, copy and paste it to your directory ( c:program files(x86)/2k games/darkness 2 ) or simply drag all file to that directory.
6. you re now ask if you copy and replace the files just click copy and replace.
7. close all open windows and look for the desktop icon for darkness 2 and play the game.
8. enjoy the game.

2.Open the Iso File with Deamon Tools and mount it with it.
3.Now Install the game with the Setup.exe on the DVD.
4.When the Game is full Installed go to the Direction where u have intsalled the game.(Normally in C: direction in Programm files (86). and 2K Games.)
5.There u find a map with the Name Drivers. Install Direct x now (u mus search a little bit in the map for it). Now u must install VCRedist2008. u must mark Â´Â´repairÂ´Â´ and let it install.

And stop bitching at extremezone!He was nice enough so that your ass could play this game for FREE , yes for FREE !!!
So if you're a complete MORON that has no idea what even MOUNTING a disc means , get lost , stop bitching and if it's this hard for you then go and BUY the damn game!!!
To all others : the game INSTALLED fine and WORKS! Thanks extremezone once again !!!"

The previous version DID NOT work even if installation instructions were followed perfectly. NOW this torrent works if you just mount and install, but there were issues before that were no ones fault. People that complained about keygens and activation keys didnt have these problems because they were ""morons"" they had these problems because they existed. So please dont comment about how stupid people are if you have no clue why people are saying these things. I had the same problems and downloaded this a few days later and the problem was fixed. These are legitimate questions and issues. Be respectful. Thank you extremezone for the upload, all of your stuff is awesome"

,DereckS,2012-02-24T02:50Z,"If you haven't played the first, the game isn't worth it. Without spoilers, if you please:
-> you spend the entire eight hours of the campaign remembering Jenny, the char's gf, even though she died 2 years ago. That's the whole story. If you haven't played the first, then you have no idea why Jenny is so important for the char to keep hallucinating about her. Let me add that if you want a story and reading material, TPB has the complete comic books collection somewhere, which follows the two games to the letter.
If you know a little about the previous installment, know that this one doesn't have anything in common. You're running and shooting through corridors; I heard the first one had you travel through a whole city and whatnot. Well, this isn't it.

Even the hardest difficulty setting is still pretty easy provided you use your tentacles/snakes correctly.
I'm not joking about the 8 hours, but to 2K's credit a campaign any longer would have been a flaw. However the last 10 minutes should have played in 1 hour so the ending is instantly ruined. Everything is solved in those 10 minutes, it's not even thrilling. It's just what we call ""WELL ISNT THIS CONVENIENT???"".
Some will tell me you can collect Relics, except there's a skill you can learn that lets you know if there are any near you, so collecting these is ruined too; since you're running through corridors there's always one in range for your scanner.

The dev tried to make the game 50% interactive novel, 50% shooter and it failed in both cases.

There's always the Vendetta mode for some more mission, where you're supposed to play with four friends. Don't know if the cracked version allows online playing though, otherwise you can just replace the three other guys by NPC so not all is lost.

Lastly you can take the campaign train again when you're done but this time you keep all your skills and can acquire the few you did not consider acquiring before (I'm not kidding you, there are so few skills to buy you can get them all in one playthrough) so basically for the first five hours or so you're a god in a world of mortal and then you're pretty much back to where you started (the enemies gradually become stronger) - or ended, rather."

,DereckS,2012-02-29T09:34Z,"MashUp2011: if I were to point at a dog's excrement and yell ""this is shit"", people would agree with me. A single percent would be telling me that, no, this isn't shit because we'd need to run some tests beforehand to get the proof this is indeed shit I'm pointing at.

The Darkness II isn't literally shit, so the comparison doesn't fully apply. However, between you and me, I think we can agree the human mind is impressive when it comes to analyzing and finding general rules that *most* humans would find true. By sharing my opinion, this is what I'm doing. And by sharing yours, we're both doing the same thing.
Except, well... as much as I'm forced to like you, you just lost some points in my book. I spent some time writing a summarized test of the game, and you spent two minutes telling me you that according to you nobody gives a crap about it.
Tell me then, when was the last time you read a review on IGN? Gamespot perhaps? I'm giving you guys an unbiased review so that the many, many people who seed this will stop it and focus their bandwidth on something more worthwhile. Perhaps I'm wrong, and my review too. Or perhaps we just need to admit that, sometimes, shit is shit."

Your comparison doesn't apply at all.  Pointing at dog shit and calling it dog shit is a FACT.  Playing this game and not liking in is an OPINION.  Video games are a form of art, just like paintings, music and movies.  They are open to interpretation.  The audience gets to decide for themselves wether or not they like that particular piece of art.  Reviews by critics are hardly proof of a piece of art being good or not.  I have never and will never base my opinions on a critic or any other persons OPINION.  Now, I do agree with you that this game isn't all that great, but that doesn't mean it should automatically apply to every gamer out there.  Take Skyrim and all of the prequels for example.  Very popular and good game, but I don't like it.  It has very good graphics, but I've never been into RPGs.  That is my personaly opinion, and just because I think that, doesn't mean I am wrong because I don't agree with the vast majority of the gaming population.  All it means is that I have a mind of my own and can make my own decisions.  I am not a robot and do not follow in the footsteps of a person who tries to tell me what I should think or do."

THANK YOU for your review! 

BTW

You shouldn't feed the trolls. Nothing sounds worse than a reviewer trying to defend their work to a troll. It brings you straight down to the level they are as reviewers. Which is just a hair above ""Uh it sucks lols balls!""

  With that said; As soon as I saw it was nothing but 8 hours of listening to him WHINE about Jenny I decided to do something else.  I mean really, I thought we were over her? Didn't we already slaughter just about everyone who had anything to even partially do with her death; in multiple dimensions no less, just to end up going on a backflash killing spree of self pity? 
  Jonny may go down in video game history as the the most trite, psychotic, emo, freak to ever lament the death of his girlfriend ever!!

 It was barely tolerable in the first game and to think of dragging myself through 8 hours of the worst content from the first one truly has me wanting to crawl away from ""The Darkness."""
