BUT, sound quality can be much improved; for example in the opening scene with the rain and shower scene...background music gets distorted and have weird artifact/glitchy sound.  In the shower scene, the water from the shower head does not sound natural.  Dialogue sounds find...but when the sound gets more complicated like with rain..it gets subpar.

For ripper, you should totally increase the audio bitrate.  I don't think people would mind  file size slightly bigger than 1gb."
