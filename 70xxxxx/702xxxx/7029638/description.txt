Workdone:
The 720p source files are my own, very nice, no cam movements or people walking in front of the cam. I cropped out all the black borders and resized the resolution to 852x368. I adjust the brightness,contrast,levels and then ran a smoother to make it look nice. Definitely the best out

Audio:
Well, for the audio it was hell. My video wasnt the same as the others, mine had footage the the others didnt have, so I had to add 6 sec of CAM audio. Its not the best cam audio but it will have to work. I also had to do alot of cuts and a few pasts with the line audio because it had a few places at the end that repeated. Did my best to fix it.

My rating: v8.5 a8
