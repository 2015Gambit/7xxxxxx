,lostflguy,2012-02-15T01:25Z,torrent is dead for all intents and purposed at 99.4% why upload if you cant get things started?
,daqck,2012-02-15T02:21Z,"sceneline, must be having a problem as he always finishes what he starts."
,daqck,2012-02-15T02:31Z,"anyway it's just the sample thats no 100% all the rars are there, so you should have no bother watching this episode of NCIS."
,fredfl11,2012-02-15T06:22Z,"Thanks, but! The quality is the same as the 350meg version. I think it's been OVERcompressed."
,zapor1,2012-02-16T21:39Z,"How is this logistically possible? The episode was uploaded before it even aired and it says it aired on 2/13/12. NCIS is aired on Tuesdays right... which mean it aired on the 14th. I even have this partially downloaded, but I don't remember downloading anything yesterday. I'm seriously freaked out."
