The Folk Survival Club has taken, after the everywhere praised debut album Break of Dawn, the bold next step and recorded a second CD in Nashville, in the studio of the legendary Cowboy Jack Clement (Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Townes Van Zandt, U2 and many more).
Accompanied by guitarist Gene Williams, violinist Carrie Rodriguez (Chip Taylor) and mandolinist/violinist Glen Duncan (Paul McCartney, Mark Knoppfler and the rest of the world), the singers Ankie Keultjes and Marjan Cornille have recorded a dozen songs by Ad van Meurs and a few traditionals that stand as a rock and sound like it should: genuine, pedigree american folk.
Of course there regular companions Wijdeven Theo and Eric van der Lest were also present.
Moving and touching harmonies against a backdrop of acoustic string instruments with percussion and bass. The Folk Survival Club is not afraid of soft or sentiment: Soft is Heavy. Ankie and Marjan touch the listener where it should: in the heart! ... and of course the songs, as we know them by Ad van Meurs (The Watchman/No Blues) are indestructible.

A remarkable detail: The Cowboy Arms Hotel & Recording Spa studio burned down in May but is rebuilt by the plucky 80-year-old Cowboy Jack Clement!
