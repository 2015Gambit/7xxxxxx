thanks for another one
Just a question though, there is the installer and a folder with the scenery corfu x, with all the BGL's and stuff.
Whats the deal with it? Can it be just dragged to the Aerosoft/scenery folder, instead of running the .exe?????"
,_SnakEye,2012-02-12T19:58Z,"It's all stated in teh readme file.
but anyway, the BGL files are to be placed in the corfu Scenery folder after you Install the product, it's kind of the Crack for the product.
if you notice , there are few *.blob files in the scenery folder, those files are Encrypted and get decrypt after you Activate the Product online.
what those files essentially do are placing the Decrypted files as like you registered the product Online.
in other words, that is the Crack....

Got it. I thought it would be something like that, but since i couldn't find anything related in the readme file (trust me, i've red it a few dozen times XD), i decided to ask anyway.
And since you're a nice guy, like all the FS community around here, i got my swift reply.
Thank you sir

,flightsimmer99,2012-05-06T21:47Z,good addon
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-06-03T03:25Z,It actually does not work by replacing the files. Still shows not activated
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-06-03T03:35Z,Uninstalled it and again a few times. This is not the right files or they are corrupted! Bad torrent! 
,CyrusTheVirus07,2012-06-03T08:53Z,"How you install this: Install using email and serial. When it comes to the launcher, un-check that and do not install the launcer. Copy the scenery into FSX scenery/world folder and you good to go."
,SwissPat,2012-07-21T22:47Z,Thanks Mate! :-) 
,SwissPat,2012-07-22T02:06Z,Hey cool torrent and so on but the Scenery has a few glitches and smaller fails like the old tower still exists and the RWY and so on and theres no more in the ReadMe than the Serial and the Mail so what to do exactly with the spare Corfu Scenery Folder? :-)
