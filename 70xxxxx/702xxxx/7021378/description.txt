        Welcome to UrDJUret's final album: "UrDJUret's Music Heritage v1.0"!
        You have found your way to a special collection of unusual tunes.
        This is my life's work, my musical heritage to this bizarre world.
        I started making music around 1993 and made over 450 tunes until the
        end of 2011. These are original compositions, created from ground
        with notes by me. Most of the tracks are instrumental, in a wide
        range of styles and genres. Now I have selected 64 of the best and
        release them here as MP3s. The package also includes images, a few
        music videos and some other extras. Free for Your pleasure.
        Please visit the website @ www.urdjuret.com for more fun. Enjoy!
        /John "UrDJUret" Ernstsson
