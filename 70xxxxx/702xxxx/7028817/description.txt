Joshua Panda, a twenty-six year-old singer/songwriter from Charlotte, 

North Carolina, is an exceptional combination of country and soul, 

George Jones and Otis Redding, 

and has traveled with this unique sound to a unique place: Vermont.
 
Joshua grew up in Huntersville, 

NC where at age three he started singing gospel music at Rockwell Baptist Church. 

From the church, he adopted the gospel hand wave, the rhythm, 

the wailing, and most importantly the embodiment of spirit. 

Ever since those early days in the choir, Joshua has oozed with uncontainable emotion and passion.
 
Integrating such soulful energy into his original pieces, 

Joshua has captured a spirit in his performance, 

which encompasses both the flailing of a fervent preacher and the intimacy of your best friend telling you a story.
