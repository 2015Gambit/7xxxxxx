Random Album Title is a progressive trance album by deadmau5, released on the labels mau5trap recordings, Ministry of Sound and Ultra Records. It is, in all, his third and breakthrough studio album. The album contains the singles \"Faxing Berlin,\" \"Not Exactly,\" and deadmau5\'s collaboration with Kaskade \"I Remember\". It was released physically in Ireland on October 3, 2008 and in the UK on October 6, 2008. In the United States, and Canada, there are two versions of the album, Unmixed (UL1905) and Mixed (UL1868). It was released September 2, 2008 digitally (beatport.com, iTunes, etc.), and was released physically worldwide on November 4. The album represented a departure from the normal style of deadmau5, focusing on a more downtempo and trance based sound, instead of the more dance-driven sound of his other albums.
