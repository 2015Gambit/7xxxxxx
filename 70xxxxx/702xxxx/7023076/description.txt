FAQ:  "Why isn't episode 13 from this ZR dude?"

Whatever Google finds first that's an MKV of about 450 MB, H.264 video + AC3 audio, gets made into torrent by yours truly.  In the case of "Baby Cakes", someone posted an identical-quality file shortly before ZR.  That file also happens to be 8 MB less than ZR's, so I'm keeping it.


Regarding web seeds:  I only have space for about 3 of these videos.  Older ones will be deleted to make room.  Don't forget to keep seeding!

Screenshots from this and other 450MB-MKV torrents can be viewed here:

**MKV files are compatible with media players such as Media Player Classic, VLC, ALLPlayer, foobar2000 and PowerDVD.  For other compatibility, try installing The Combined Community Codec Pack, or consult the website of your preferred media player.

Don't like MKVs?  Losslessly convert to another container, such as M2TS, with these tools:

PLEASE SEED LIKE CRAZY (That is, um, if you don't mind...)  Expect moar torrents from yours truly of single episodes, and another for the 2nd half of the season as the episodes come out; until then, I will continue to seed this and other single-video torrents that need it.

Enjoy your ponies, and don't forget to support the show and its community!  :D
