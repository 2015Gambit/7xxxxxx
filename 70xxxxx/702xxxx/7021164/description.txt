Geoffrey Arnold "Jeff" Beck (born 24 June 1944) is an English rock guitarist. He is one of 
three noted guitarists to have played with The Yardbirds; (Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page are 
the other two). Beck also formed The Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice.

Much of Becks recorded output has been instrumental, with a focus on innovative sound and 
his releases have spanned genres ranging from blues-rock, heavy metal, jazz fusion and an 
additional blend of guitar-rock and electronica. Although he recorded two hit albums 
(in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act, Beck has not established or maintained the sustained 
commercial success of many of his contemporaries and bandmates. Beck appears on albums 
by Mick Jagger, Kate Bush, Roger Waters, Donovan, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Zucchero, 
Cyndi Lauper, Brian May and ZZ Top. In 1988, he made a cameo appearance in the movie Twins..
