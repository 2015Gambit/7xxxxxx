come on Gopher :P after claiming you are ""very experienced with the Wii games"" surely you can figure out how to get this one to run properly (i never had a problem with it). maybe it is time to update your loader or ios version?"

Hobbit's games always work flawlessly and this one is no exception. Try Vidtv patch, Country string patch and 002 fix on with ios 248. Don't force NTSC, instead try system default. Mine worked perfectly with these settings. "
