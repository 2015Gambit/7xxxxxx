I need some of your expert help.

I have a Sony 32CX320 LCD which supports mkv via USB.
Most of your HD uploads (Veer Zaara, Dostana) play perfectly fine on it.

But some of the files (Kaminey, Dil Chahta Hai) have lines and blocks of distortion.
These files are 1080p, but some of the 720p files also have this problem.

What do I do to correct this?

Thanks a lot in advance.

And great rips with AMAZING quality! :D
Keep it up!!! :)"
