The Classics Chronological Series released a fourth volume containing material dating from between 1946 and 1954., in a continuous effort to reissue the complete recordings of boogie-woogie piano ace Meade "Lux" Lewis, Opening with a solo Lewis set recorded by Norman Granz for the Mercury label at a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert inside of the Embassy Auditorium in Los Angeles on April 22, 1946, this delightful album also features the work of bassist Israel Crosby and drummer Louie Bellson.
