We have more of Kavanagh QC ready to post for you soon - we begin
with the full seasons four and five in nicer quality of

720 X 480 video, fully 1350k bitrate 192k audio

Converted from DVD using DivX author 1.5

The previous seasons will follow - a previous poster has asked for
season five as he had uploaded the others in separate folders by season 
as I recall.

Kavanagh QC stars the great Mr. John Thaw of Inspector Morse fame equally
He s a man of real Irish spirit - French natured even - with the best Germanic
intellect to boot. Probably most a home in Australia I would venture to add


This is a look at the workings of the British legal system of justice
in criminal cases - even with an opportunity to see black judges at work
amidst such high standards as these.
