,ty_uppers,2012-02-12T12:53Z,"Just in case you ever wonder why VTV and  EZTV get way more downloads, consider that the downloader can just click and not think about unclicking 4 or 5 unnecessary files and then having to delete the crap at the start of the file name that makes the file impossible to find on Xbox or PS. I don't mean to complain, because I appreciate the rare downloads not uploaded by better sources in better formats. But why the need to put your glory name in place of the title so the downloader frets in finding the file, and simultaneously curses your name? Good advertising? "
,ty_uppers,2012-02-12T12:58Z,"Gig...I had the same prob, I ended up just watching the episode out of frustration to see what happened, and it played perfectly until the very end, then cut off quickly. Go ahead and just watch it."
