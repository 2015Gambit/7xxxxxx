My Kitchen Rules Australia is back for another season!
There are plenty of surprises in store as Australia's favourite home- cooking show My Kitchen Rules returns for a brand new series. Our twelve new cooking teams each take turns to transform an ordinary home into an instant restaurant, serving up a three- course menu designed to impress not only their fellow contestants but MKR judges, Pete Evans and Manu Feildel. Tonight, it is NSW's turn as Greek siblings Steve and Helen battle to produce the first dinner of the series. How will they fare?

Enjoy!
