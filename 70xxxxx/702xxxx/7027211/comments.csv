,Merkarov91,2012-02-13T10:24Z,"I'm very greatful for the upload, I love this show and appreciate the effort you guys go to! However, there's one issue which the previous episodes had that hasn't been addressed, the awful background noise of crickets or something, it overpowers everything else, anyway everything else is perfect just the 'hissing' sound is a bit distracting"
,sahilrox,2012-02-13T10:56Z,Reading Sad Sam's Comment was a big mistake. You should be hanged till death for that.
,Kazehaya,2012-02-13T11:24Z,"People should stop spoiling. :/
Thanks. "
,Kole97,2012-02-13T12:09Z,"Agree with the guy above, stop discolsing about the show..........been waiting for season 3"

i knew the old farmer would become a zombie!

What?! 
That should not happen in a long time! In the the comic , he dies not until some years later when their prison they live in is attacked by idiots. They have changed to much important stuff in the TV series :("
,TLegenden,2012-02-13T12:56Z,The old farmer is way to important to die now..
,hz66,2012-02-13T13:00Z,I just soiled myself... =/

,cvolcano,2012-02-18T07:33Z,Stopped watching this show when it started sucking. Remember the episode where the kid gets shot? In that episode is like a TEN MINUTE scene with those two cops crying all over each other. Crap.
