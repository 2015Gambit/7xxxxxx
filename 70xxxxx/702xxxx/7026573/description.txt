This German electronic dance music production duo (Michael MÃ¼nzing and Luca Anzilotti), who were fronted by a rotating cast of singers and rappers, had a huge international smash in 1990 with "The Power." London-based rapper Turbo B. and his cousin Jackie Harris teamed up to vocalize on "The Power," with Harris' curdling vocal elevating Turbo B.'s pedestrian rap. But by the time things got rolling, Harris was already gone, replaced by Penny Ford, a former Gap Band background vocalist. Turbo B. himself was gone by 1992, shortly after Snap!'s second Arista LP, The Madman's Return, hit the streets. He was replaced by Nikki Harris, a former Madonna background vocalist. Snap! had a second big hit in 1990 with the number five pop single "Rhythm Is a Dancer."
