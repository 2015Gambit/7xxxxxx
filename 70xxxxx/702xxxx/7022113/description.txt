This reissue from the folks at Auralux is a gem of a recording. The original album was released in 1980 by Greensleves entitled â€˜The Big Showdownâ€™ featuring Jah Thomas and displaying a cartoon drawing of a boxing match between the two dub masters as itâ€™s album cover. Both of whom each mixed five tracks on the album. The album is rightly regarded as a classic and is seen by many as one of the last great dub albums.

 

What many people didnâ€™t realize is that Junjo Lawes productions issued an entirely different version simultaneously in Jamaica on the Jah Guidance label. This album used the same sleeve and track listing as the original Greensleves version, but contained ten different Barrington Levy dubs, again mixed at King Tubbyâ€™s studio. Both recordings featured dubs of â€˜Reggae Musicâ€™, â€˜Looking My Loveâ€™, and â€˜Black Heart Manâ€™ the other seven were never issued on an album and each mix on the Jah Guidance album is different from any other release ever issued in any format! These tunes have remained obscure and not available for 25 years, until nowâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦

 

The Lost Mixes opens with â€˜Shaolin Temple Dubâ€™ and takes the listener on a tough, raw and to the point ride through Jamaicaâ€™s golden age of dub wise. Each track is dubbed to perfection, with tunes like â€˜Trod with Jahâ€™ being turned into a stomping drum and bass workout. All the Levy killers are present from â€˜Shine Eye Galâ€™ to â€˜A Yah We Dehâ€™.

 

No one really knows who exactly mixed down these tracks, the album notes say Scientist or Jammy are likely culprits! But whatever the case this is Barrington Levy and The Roots Radics with a new twist of timeless dub!
