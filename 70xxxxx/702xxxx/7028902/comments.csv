I tried those programs they are all the same. Google m4v converter and you get like 20 of that same website/program with a different name. Seems like a hoax to me. Did you actually manage to get it to work? I'ma check out your torrent to see how it turned out :)

Regardless the screen cap I did is just as good as the original IMO. I ran the two videos side by side and could barely notice any loss in quality."
,jocamero,2012-02-14T01:52Z,NoteBurner seemed to work just fine.  It was the first time I ever used the program.
,plum5auce,2012-02-14T02:13Z,Yea just looked into it it looks legit.. the website just looked similar to the lemon programs I used. I must have tried like 5 diff programs which all failed to work get the job done. I'll give noteburner a go next time!
