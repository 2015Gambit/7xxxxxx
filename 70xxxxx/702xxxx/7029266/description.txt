ReleaseNotes:

This album was the band\'s introduction to the big time and they did not disappoint with their tracks of Pusher, Where? and Sea Groove becoming popular listening songs on radio station and most requested songs in early 2002 when this CD was in fact released. \'Curb\' is a unique beginning for Nickelback where the fan/listener first met the integral sound and rythmns of this group. This cd was originally released way back in 1996...
