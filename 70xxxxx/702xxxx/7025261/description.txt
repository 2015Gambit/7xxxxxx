Commodore User Magazine complete June 1983 - February 1990

Commodore User (usually known as just 'CU') was a long-running UK
magazine that focussed mainly on the Commodore 64 and latterly the
Amiga. Initially covering the more serious aspects of the C64 platform,
CU introduced games coverage after the first year, and this became the
predominant feature for the rest of the magazine's run. CU quietly
dropped it's C64 coverage to become CU Amiga in 1990 (the complete CU
Amiga archive is also available as a separate download - please see
RetroPDFs for more information).

These PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on
public Torrent trackers. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad. The OCR software has increased the file
size slightly, and some issues haven't OCR'd as well as others, due to the
layout and fonts used.

More OCR'd mags will be periodically available - please check(or just Google "RetroPDFs") for more
information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their
continued support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
