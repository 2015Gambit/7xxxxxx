,logichall,2012-02-12T22:25Z,good quality but if you stream through PS3 it keeps fucking up. No idea why people continue to put out vids that are choppy on the PS3. SUCK!

,Tinny_pb,2012-06-16T06:08Z,"^ Fair enough, but the description clearly states it's 608x256.

As for why people create videos that aren't 100% compatible with PS3, it's because this is the Pirate Bay, not the PS3 Bay."
