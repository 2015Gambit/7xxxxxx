A 10

Image is sharp, audio is flawless and has no ""old movie"" noise.  It's a straight up BDRip upload with everything that entails.

I love 3li and Kingdom releases for their quality but most importantly, their inclusion of subtitle folder in the torrent.  Just a tip, if you feel like it.  Either way...  

Kudos, Bubanee.  Great upload."
[V],bubanee,2012-02-13T01:15Z,"Thanks for that Grimm... 
I notice Blu-ray uses a different naming for .srt (after reading about it) one that i can convert but that involves more programs but i kinda got used to the two i use now but the first part doesn't seem to provide the subs.. I may or may not look into it... and i guess if people are that worried (non english folk and the thieves who sell stuff when it's free) they can source elsewhere.. thanks for the score as well.. just like my music rips i'm trying to be the best i can be for the size and way i do things... Cheers :)"
,GrimmCro,2012-02-13T03:14Z,"No worries on the subs, mate.  There are plenty floating out there and KMP player is nifty when it comes to aligning them to any release.

Regarding your quality and size ratio, it's perfect.  As I've stated, quality in both video and audio is there, download was quick, simply great.

You've been my go-to guy with music torrents, now I can safely say I'm adding you to the movie list as well.

Godspeed with future releases."
