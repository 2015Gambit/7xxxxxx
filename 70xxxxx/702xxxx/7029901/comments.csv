Stop ""tagging"" your uploads with site links.All thoose that were found with such tags are removed.
Same goes for comments.Thoose rules goes for all and it's a precaution to prevent TPB being flooded with/from spammers on all aspects.

You can always reupload them with proper Torrent name --""without"" the www -.com... - etc..
The seeders/leechers will be the same as you had.Just don't change anything on your original files.
Go here and make a post, so you can get the ""hashes"" cleared. -->>   https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=63547   In order to be able for reuploading.

Thank you for understanding!"
