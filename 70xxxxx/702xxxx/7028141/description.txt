These are great videos from AMAZING instructors. Please! Buy the videos and support their awesome hard work and outright B.A.M.F.-ery (yes, that's right) if possible. Otherwise, share and care.

Swing is probably one of the coolest forms of partner dancing around - at least if you like fast paced stuff. A real blast:) Give it a shot!
