A version update shouldn't make your unfinished downloads un-recognizable, but it could make you lose record of loaded torrents and the file locations. Maybe you can get that 85% back? It should be able to find the files and check them (hash check, or something like that). Either way, good luck. From the looks of the peers and seeds, you shouldn't have a problem."
