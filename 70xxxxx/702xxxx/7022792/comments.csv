The installer doesn't work on x64 bits windows."
,brower,2012-03-11T16:35Z,"Iven00, when i apply this patch fix the UI appears, but all game change from english to russian. There is a way to fix it but keep english??"
,Nanao-kun,2012-03-24T05:15Z,"I got the fix to work without losing the English. When copying the files over, only copy over the files that say ""mainmenu"" in them."
,MeSaber,2012-04-09T10:00Z,can anyone upload the patch fix somewhere else
,Spinfx,2012-04-11T20:23Z,"Running win7 x64. I can vouch for the 1st commentor, Diplomacy works - but I haven't tested the other executables.

Game seemed to crash at launch when I used the shortcut but ""run as admin"" on the executable works."
,thcfreak666,2012-04-24T02:14Z,Don´t work. No GUI.
,thcfreak666,2012-04-24T16:52Z,"Please update the whole Game, not only Diplomacy!"
,thcfreak666,2012-04-24T17:47Z,"@Iven00
