                           DESCRiPTiON 

 An insight into the lives of female lorry drivers in the UK, who have taken on
 the challenge of working in such a male-dominated industry. The programme     
 follows a former ballerina who is still unsure about her new career, a trainee
 trying to pass her HGV2 test, a former soldier and transsexual struggling for 
 acceptance, and a woman dedicated to mentoring new drivers.
                    
                                 Enjoy!
