Jeffrey "Jeff" Lynne (born 30 December 1947) is an English songwriter, composer, arranger, singer, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer who gained fame as the leader and sole constant member of Electric Light Orchestra and was a co-founder and member of The Traveling Wilburys together with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. Lynne has produced recordings for artists such as The Beatles, Brian Wilson, Roy Orbison, Dave Edmunds, Del Shannon and Tom Petty. He has co-written songs with Petty and also with George Harrison, whose 1987 album Cloud Nine was co-produced by Lynne and Harrison. Among the many compositions to his credit are such well-known hits as "Livin' Thing", "Evil Woman", "Turn to Stone", "Do Ya", "Xanadu", "Strange Magic", "Sweet Talkin' Woman", "Telephone Line", "Shine a Little Love", "Mr. Blue Sky", "Hold On Tight", "All Over the World", and "Don't Bring Me Down".

This 12" disco single was released by Jeff Lynne right before ELO's "Out Of The Blue" LP. It's quite a snappy little disco number, with classic Jeff Lynne vocals. I suppose it's safe to assume that Jeff plays all the instruments. The single was a complete bomb and it is now hard to find. I found a sealed copy in the cutout bin many years ago. Here is a fresh transfer for your enjoyment.
The vinyl was transferred on a Sony PS-LX350H turntable with an AT-440MLa stylus into a Philips standalone CD Recorder and ripped to WAV with EAC. CoolEditPro was used for editing and mastering. EQ was adjusted and the volume was normalized to 98%. Pops and clicks were removed by hand. There was no noise reduction processing of any kind.

Every Little Thing

Taken from his first solo album, Armchair Theatre, released in June 1990, the single became a minor hit (#59) in the UK and at #9 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the US. It charted at #24 in Australia. Fellow Traveling Wilburys George Harrison and Tom Petty made cameo appearances in the music video, directed by Meiert Avis that received rotation on VH1 at the time.

02. Sirens (Lynne) (3:47)
03. Borderline (Lynne) (2:21)



"Every Little Thing" and "Lift Me Up" were released as singles. The album also features two classic cover versions "September Song" and "Stormy Weather" the latter recorded as a tribute to his late mother. The album re-united Lynne with Electric Light Orchestra's keyboard player Richard Tandy and fellow Traveling Wilburys member George Harrison (both Harrison and the Wilburys were signed to Warner Bros. Records, parent of Reprise Records which released this album). Despite positive reviews the album became only a minor hit. It has been rumored that a re-release of Armchair Theatre is set along with his new, long awaited 2012 solo album.
