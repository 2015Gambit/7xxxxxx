This is great! A jazzed up version of the patty Labell clasic. There\'s one small noise in it but if you like Stevie Nicks you will LOVE THIS! I\'ve Searched for this on here for years and it has never been on here. I finally found the copy I had from the days of Napster. (I miss those days) Alot of rare music has never been on here. If I can ever recover the data from my old hard drive I\'ll put some unbeleivable stuff on here, like an acoustic version of Black Dog, If any one has it let me know.
