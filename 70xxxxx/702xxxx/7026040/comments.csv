,Brandonx187,2012-04-13T06:58Z,Setup.bat rather..
,eru_iluvatar,2012-04-22T21:02Z,Does multiplayer work?
,mrsteroids,2012-04-30T03:19Z,does not contain setup.bat
,SockandShoe,2012-05-08T12:12Z,Don't bother downloading this. The required setup file is missing and there's nothing to unrar or unzip. 
,SnipedYooDude,2012-06-07T15:08Z,It works for me so you need to download the dotNetFx40_Full_setup and the xnafx40_redist and it will work the thing you need to do after that is there is a file called terraria double click it.
