,yummyroadkill,2012-02-12T21:23Z,"There are no seeders online. My torrent client shows 25 got this and ran without seeding.

When you start a torrent, you need to stay online for at least 24 hours (I usually do 48 + hours) so others with better speed can get the whole thing and seed.

No peer (37 on and 174 total) has more than 15% and it's been that way for 2 days."
,yummyroadkill,2012-02-12T23:41Z,"Actually, the problem might be that no one downloaded the whole thing and only 15% is available because no one is seeding the whole torrent. Which means, you need to get online and stay until some of us can get it all and you won't be the only seeder. :)"
,whitecat2010,2012-02-13T14:40Z,"I seed the whole night and all mornings, when my son is at school. The moment he comes from school, until the time he goes to bed, he grabs the connection (he's an Internet addict). But still I'm seeding for 3/4 of the time. My speed is lamentable at this time, and I've done to uTorrent everything that I can, and followed all advice I could find on the web. Ports are open, green checkmark, upload bandwidth set to high and unlimited speed, my connection is 1 Mb/sec, I'm not downloading anything much, I even paused all downloads. Still it never got better than 9, at good times. At other times, it's about 2. No wonder they take a lot to complete it. Now most people have 18.6%. It's getting really frustrating. But uTorrent shows 22 seeds right now (almost never online, whenever I checked, maybe they are in the US so they come at night). 
It's the first time I have such problems..."
,yummyroadkill,2012-02-13T20:31Z,"Ah, no worries. It'll just take as long as it take. :) Too bad those seeders just hit and ran, though...or only got a couple things (which means they only seeded the little they had).

It'll all get worked out, eventually. Great share, by the way. I'm sure I'll love it once I get it all. LOL"
,whitecat2010,2012-02-14T07:32Z,"yummyroadkill thanks for the kind and understanding words. So many leechers get nasty if they cannot get everything immediately and if you cannot seed 24/7 at top speed. 
Now everybody is at more than 27% and still going.
By the way, I wanted to say to everybody: if you already have one of these files, and it's crappy quality, try redownloading it from me, chances are I've fixed it. The value of this torrent is not only the content, which was not my own scan, but more the long careful work that has been done to it to make it presentable and usable without ruining one's eyes. Sometimes I had to recreate whole portions of charts square by square, or by mirroring a section which was completely black but fortunately was the same/opposite to another one which was good.
I wish people put a little more care when they scan! Especially Japanese patterns are almost hopeless - strange, one would think they have such good hardware... 
But oh well, we cannot complain too much, because without these first scanners/uploaders there wouldn't be any content to begin with. "
,whitecat2010,2012-02-25T02:55Z,"Finally I found out that there was a problem with the ISP, that's why upload speed was so slow. Now they fixed it. In just a few hours the peers went from 42% to 53.5 % and going strong. There are many of them, so the moment they complete, there will be plenty of seeds (I hope they don't just run away!!!)"
,netters,2012-02-26T07:48Z,Thanks WhiteCat2010 for sticking with it!  I'll be here to seed for a while.  The files look great.  Thanks for the upload!
,namshub,2012-02-29T00:32Z,"Wow, this is huge. I'm not big into afghans & throws, but I'll d/l & seed it for a while just because it's awesome.

Thanks!"
,FireGoddess1969,2012-03-11T00:09Z,thanks
,whitecat2010,2012-03-11T07:36Z,"@ namshub
You don't have to make them into afghans (throws). You can pick a nice design and, depending on the design but also changing the thickness and texture of the yarn, make a cushion, a tote bag, a sweater or jacket (or front-crossing boleros (choose small squares, and figure out how to do half ones), a tablecloth or even potholders (you'll have to make a double square and maybe stick some felt inside for extra protection) "
,HeartsQuilt,2012-05-08T02:43Z,"This was a fabulous collection.  Your scans were very clear!  Thanks so much for uploading this! I will likely be seeding for months since I have a new, giant, hard drive and there's no hurry to get it off."
,AnahnNYmous,2012-05-09T00:08Z,Thanks White Cat...this is awesome!!!
,whitecat2010,2012-08-10T21:54Z,@HeartsQuilt They are not my scans. I just optimized other people's scans when they had problems. Thanks for the comment and happy crocheting!
