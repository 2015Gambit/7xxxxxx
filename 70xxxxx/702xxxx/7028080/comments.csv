Belive what you want, our releases are Always our rip (why it sometimes took a long, we haven't unlimited hardware)"

,defecator,2012-02-14T00:04Z,"spastik64, please tell me - why is this file a bit-for-bit copy of the Orenji release? If anyone doesn't believe me, they can check it theirselves using any simple MD5 verifier - both this and the Orenji release share a common checksum of e710fb0953b9e1089b1ca2289b701fa5, and since the Orenji release was uploaded 2012-02-13 08:26:00 GMT, one could only assume you had plenty of time until 2012-02-13 12:31:49 GMT to download it, rename it and release it as your own. I now feel cheated and 1.24GB of my bandwidth have been wasted."
,lindsay1090,2012-02-14T00:37Z,Hmmm this torrent did something crazy...it work on my laptop...put it on my hard drive to watch on xbox but nothing shows up...not to mention that this ONE episode is 1.24 GB? it's weird...good try though =]

I'm not here to complain, even tho it sounded like that .. My bad .. 

Anyway, but you can't mean that you use the exact same encoding settings as the release groups and get the exactly same filesizes .. That's impossible .. So that's was what my comment was for .. 

So if you instead use proper release-group it will be easier for people to find subtitles etc .. 

Just pointing it out there .. "
