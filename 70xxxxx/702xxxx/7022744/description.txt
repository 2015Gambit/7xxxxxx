Las Vegas has to be one of the strangest cities in the USA. Located in the middle of a desert it is one huge sea of low houses with a wild collection of strange high rise in one strip of land in the center. Thatâ€™s where the money is made in Las Vegas, thatâ€™s where the hotels and casinos are.
US Cities - Las Vegas is more than just this city. Some of the famous areas around the city are included, such as the Grand Canyon and Area 51 where the US government parked its collection of alien space craft. There is a lot to explore in this superb VFR scenery that has perhaps the best value for money for any FSX add-on. Check out the screenshots and you will see.
US Cities X is a series of city scenery for FSX that covers US cities created by LimeSim. Based on an extensive aerial image it will have all the major buildings and landmarks plus all the airports and heliports that are inside the covered areas. It is clearly intended to fill the gap between the default scenery and very high dense city scenery such as Manhattan X, London VFR or Venice X.
