,snusbagaren,2012-08-12T10:52Z,"No episodes has been problematic on my PC, check you're codec or Media player.
Yeah, 3 episodes on season 5 is in French(I wrote Spanish and can't change torrent anymore), IMPOSSIBLE to get em without, I searched for days. Different releases, so compression and quality differs."
