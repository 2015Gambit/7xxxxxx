,PirateRiot321,2012-02-13T08:04Z,"@YIFY hey man you have given me a lot of things to watch and I appreciate that, I was just wondering whether you could release supernatural season 7 or the episodes it has and encrypt it into 720p or 1080 if you cant, don't worry than, anyway thanks if you can "

,Xorakka,2012-02-14T09:03Z,"Not exactly sure why you made THIS movie 1080p. I mean it was fairly funny, but it isn't an epic movie by any stretch of the imagination.

However, it is a very nice quality rip and I am not complaining, just confused :)"
,BlueTak,2012-02-14T19:59Z,"What audio is it? Stereo, like the 720p file?"

,dzver666,2012-02-22T02:54Z,why isn't saying v/a bitrate? Anyone knows?
,eightyth_attempt2register,2012-03-16T06:29Z,I got a letter to my ISP for downloading this torrent.  Really sucks they target YIFY's torrents which are the best compression versions of films.  I told the MPAA to release torrents of movies with ads in them because downloading low quality streaming movies from hulu is a pain and renting blu ray discs 90% of the time the disc is scratched (blu ray have this problem) and I miss several minutes of the movie.
