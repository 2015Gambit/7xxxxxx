,Epicfrozen,2012-02-19T04:29Z,"Bruss, can you please bring back TF2? Even though it went F2P, i still want it, steam is buggy and all, can you please bring it back? I'm just asking a favor and all and i would love it if you bring'd back the old TF2 Torrents by you, another reason why i want it is because it has ALL of the items, which i love, you know, so i can annoy bots! But please, bring back the TF2 torrents, please?"
