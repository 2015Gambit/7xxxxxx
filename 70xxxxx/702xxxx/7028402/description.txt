Quite a bit has changed in the sport of golf over the last few years, including how it has been viewed in the public eye. There is no better example of this culture shift than Golf Battle 3D.

Golf Battle 3D appears to be right up my street. It looks good, too, from the over-exaggerated caricatures of the golfer to the rolling fairways fading into the distance.

Golf Battle 3D is a gorgeous universal app that puts a little more testosterone into golf.
There are 4 different levels to play on, and they all look great! These are full 3D maps with sky, lighting, and water effects as well as sand traps, water hazards. The attention to detail is excellent â€“ the bleachers even make a metallic â€œdingâ€ sound when you hit them with the golf ball.

There is nothing that can beat the feeling of a perfect hit with the driver!
This game is all about the two best features of golf: Hitting furiously long drives and kicking your friendsâ€™ butts! That is why we have produced this network based action golf game - with the driver as your only weapon. 

Use your phoneÂ´s advanced features such as touchscreen (to swing) and the gyroscope (to steer the ball). As you hear from the title it is a 3D game. Thanks to the network setup you can play against your friends if they are on iPhone, Android, Symbian, Windows7 or Samsung Bada.

In the game you will be able to battle on four different courses, from four different continents. When you play the game for the first time, two of the courses will be available to play. The other two you will have to earn your right to playâ€¦

Angus is the ginger Scotsman that is leading the pack. If you for some reason do not like his looks or attitude you can replace him with any of the 26 full characters in the game. Every time you play the game you earn gold coins, these coins can be used to upgrade your avatar, or his equipment.
