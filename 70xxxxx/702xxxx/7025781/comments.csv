,deafless,2012-03-18T20:37Z,"@XspicyX you need to have a active 3d glasses for the nvidia laptop, cant use the cheap passive ones. the active 3d glasses are costy and shit! cos once you watch 3d with active you could see the glasses flickering really bad. but if you have one and you must play with xbmc or windows media center. im not sure about the other players like vlc, mkv?? but let me know if it works with them if you try it. cheers"

,SecretAgentA,2012-05-11T10:36Z,"@totaltyke Get an AppleTV, I had the same problem, spent ages trying to transcode and change the aspect ratio but no luck, found that if the film is played from my mac to appletv then the 3D option is available no matter what the film dimensions are. Worked great for me! Good luck!"
