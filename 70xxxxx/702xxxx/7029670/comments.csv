,inteLzzz,2012-02-14T16:33Z,"It's the nightly spam brigade. Apparently the RIAA and MPAA have hired a company to poison torrent listings and every night a few brand new accounts spam the listings with a bunch of junk files with the names of the most popular torrents. Within a few minutes they have between 15k and 20k seeds and several thousand leechers. They do this every night and I would imagine the only people that fall for them are dumb as a box of rocks.
EDIT: Rather than answer the same questions several times to the replies this post has, I'll answer a few here:
Remember, it's not the act of downloading that is technically illegal, it's the uploading, i.e. sharing of said torrents. This works because when you download one of these, their honeypot will see the hash and your IP show up on their end.
The downloads aren't 100% static. I've never actually downloaded one of these (that would be stupid without a few good layers of protection), I would think it's safe to say it's a copy of something they hold copyright on, possibly of horrible quality or a huge water mark making it unviewable but still enough of the movie to prove intent in court.
The easiest way to spot and avoid is to read the comments. Download only from trusted users. Never trust a torrent that has a shitload of seeds and leeches within the first 30 min of uploading. Also, most of the time, the description is a copypasta across all of the uploads so if you read it carefully, you will see a number of incorrect issues including wrong titles and times.
Fortunately the Bay is rather proactive when these asshats show up and do a wholesale delete of all uploads buy the bogus user.
