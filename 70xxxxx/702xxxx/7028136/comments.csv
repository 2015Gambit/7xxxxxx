Plz Upload This In Small Size AC3"
,DrKey,2012-02-26T12:06Z,"@kireirish: the SBS 3d can't be played on tv through your DVD blue ray 3D LG if you have an 3D LG Tv just copy the movie on a usb flash and plug it into your tv, and choose the option 3d and then press the picture which shows 2 divided screens (sbs...i.e: side by sibe ) no codecs needed 

@nexuswolf : am downloading it and will reupload it in AC3 once finished "
,nexuswolf,2012-02-27T06:34Z,"@DrKey
