yogibee and unnim2:

I hope you enjoy the books!

,retheldirood,2012-06-05T16:57Z,"Like jmadams85, I also am not seeing The Truth or The Last Hero present in this collection.  Hey, Bookeek, you want to check on that?"
,ratmnerd,2012-07-11T11:35Z,I'm also missing The Last Hero and The Truth. Could the ULer please check his torrent and add these two books if they're not there already?
,jh31415,2012-08-06T20:50Z,Checked a random selection and quality seems pretty good; most at least seem to be genuine ebook editions rather than ocr copies. I spotted a single ocr error in about 50 pages or so read (an 'n' swapped to an 'h').
