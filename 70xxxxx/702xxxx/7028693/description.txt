He must keep his loved ones safe and balance the relationships he shares with each person around him. Scott is also having trouble with keeping his secret from the girl he loves, and later finds out she is part of a family that hunts werewolves.The theme of \\\"finding your place\\\" is a prevalent undertone in the series that is mirrored by the pack mentality of werewolves.

He must figure out ways to keep his loved ones safe, balance the relationships he already shares with new relationships he makes, and deal with himself as a werewolf under the full moon.
