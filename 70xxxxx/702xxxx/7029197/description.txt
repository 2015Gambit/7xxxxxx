      BoneCraft: Somewhere in Some Galaxy is the second game created by D-Dub
      Software. It is a follow-up to 2008's Action Adventure Porno Video Game,
      BoneTown.
     
      A parody of everything science fiction and fantasy, BoneCraft brings
      together many popular stories into one hilarious sexy romp. BoneCraft is
      a world where anything can happen and does, says Hod, D-Dub's Lead
      Developer.
     
      BoneCraft is a third-person action-adventure game with a unique sex
      dynamic merged seamlessly into the gameplay. The game follows the
      exploits of Captain Fort Worth, the leader of the Space Wranglers, and
      his sidekick, Lubbock.
