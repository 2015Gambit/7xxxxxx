SYNOPSIS:  
Considered by some to be Akira Kurosawas greatest achievement, Ikiru presents the director at his most compassionate - affirming life through an exploration of a mans death. Takashi Shimura portrays Kanji Watanabe, an aging bureaucrat with stomach cancer forced to strip the veneer off his existence and find meaning in his final days. Told in two parts, Ikiru offers Watanabes quest in the present, and then through a series of flashbacks. The result is a multifaceted look at a life through a prism of perspectives, resulting in a full portrait of a man who lacked understanding from others in life.
