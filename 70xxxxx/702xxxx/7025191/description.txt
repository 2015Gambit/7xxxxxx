insine is a concept album, exploring formal limitations in pursuit of a new creative approach. 

every sound on this album was developed from a basic sine-wave. the whole album is purely, 100% digital. 

sine is the purest waveform, representing a single clear tone, and therefore has a unique aesthetic. still, through the use of modulation, harmonics and effects, an infinite array of sounds may be developed from the sine-wave, at the same time retaining that crystal quality of the original source. 

the aim of this project was to create music as complex as possible from the most simple source material, and to explore a whole sound-world of sine in the process.
