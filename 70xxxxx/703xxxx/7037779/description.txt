Almost everyone loves a good mystery, and mysteries are the meat of forensic science. The study
 of forensic science involves the analysis and interpretation of evidence for use in a court of
 law. Unlike "pure" disciplines, forensics is an applied science that uses scientific principles
 to meet specific goals. 

Many of the principles and techniques used by experts are incorporated into Forensic Science
 Experiments. Ideal for middle and high school students, this new full-color volume features
 20 experiments that will help students get a firm grasp on concepts in the field of forensic
 science. Each experiment is a self-contained unit with its own further resources, tips for the
 teacher, and links to the National Science Education Standards. This resource allows students 
to think independently and build on their own base of science knowledge.
