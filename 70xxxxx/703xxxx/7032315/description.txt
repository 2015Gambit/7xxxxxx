In the second of five programmes, Johnnie Walker looks at favourite classic albums. This week it's Elton John's 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' from 1973.

Elton's seventh studio album was produced by Gus Dudgeon at the Honky Chateau in France, with some preparation and recording in Kingston, Jamaica.

It features the famous Marilyn Monroe tribute, 'Candle in the Wind', as well as three successful singles: 'Bennie and the Jets', 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road', and 'Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting' alongside cult favourites like 'Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding'.

The programme will feature highlights from the double album with comment and cultural history from Johnnie and broadcaster and critic David Hepworth alongside archive interviews with many of the key players.
