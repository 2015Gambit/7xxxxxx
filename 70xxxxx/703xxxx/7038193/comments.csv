,garycarradine,2012-02-18T06:07Z,"Auge, 

thnx again for this. i've been looking for this rare film  besides nosferatu. i only saw this on youtube. 
um, can you upload the movie ""The Ghost Camera"" - 1933? its a rare british film but its a good suspense film. :))"
[T],Auge,2012-02-18T06:21Z,"garycarradine,
I dont know if Ghost Camera is even available on DVD.
Are you looking for Nosferatu? If so which version 1922 or the one with Klaus Kinski from 1979?"
,garycarradine,2012-02-18T08:02Z,"i like the 1922 version black and white. there are two versions of the 1922, the one with tinted, and the other is just black & white which was released by alpha. :))"
[T],Auge,2012-02-18T15:17Z,"I have the one with the tints, that's used to tell us the difference between night and day."
,garycarradine,2012-02-18T17:09Z,"oh, i see. i also have that version too. anyway, do you have ""He Walked By Night"" - 1948 film noir?
:))"
[T],Auge,2012-02-18T19:55Z,"garycarradine,
I have it on AVI, before ripping to ISO's I was ripping to AVI.
I only started ISOs recently."

,narnicles,2012-05-07T14:37Z,Excellent! Can someone please seed this a little bit?
