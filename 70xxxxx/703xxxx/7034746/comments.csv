,stijr,2012-02-16T06:11Z,"please edit the title asap.

Thanks a ton for this one!"
,Xpatriated,2012-02-16T08:17Z,"I would, but editing has been ""temporarily disabled"" for quite some time now.  Don't worry, links will reflect the actual issue rather than the title number.  At least, if I upload.  MM doesn't usually link, so if he gets #7, I'll slip a link into his torrent page in a comment."
