For his 19th â€“ yeah, thatâ€™s right 19 â€“ album, roots ruler Eaglesmith recorded his septet live off of the floor using one microphone live off the floor on a one track 1/4 inch tape reel-to-reel tape recorder. And you know what? It sounds fantastic. Proving that, in this age of digital wonders, a song as instantly appealling as â€œKatieâ€ will cut through all the studio trickery. Because good songwriting is something that no amount of computer aids can create and Eaglesmith is the real thing. Moaning the words to â€œJohnny Cashâ€ over Matty Simpsonâ€™s ragged Neil Young-ish guitar about â€œhis songs give you a real good feelingâ€ and so on to all of those latecomers to the late singerâ€™s art once the American Recordings series arrived. Sadly, Eaglesmith noting that the radio stationâ€™s playing his hero now when they never did when he was alive could be being prophetic. He is one of Canadaâ€™s finest and isnâ€™t getting the respect he deserves.
