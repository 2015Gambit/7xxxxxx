- Ultra Fast Defragmentation Engine
- Thorough Free Space Consolidation
- Boot Time System File Defragmentation Technology
- 4 Different Algorithms for Intelligent File Placement

Why Use Disk Defrag
* File System Optimization
Places system files to the faster part of the disk, minimizing the time needed for the hard drive to access them.

* Free Space Consolidation
Merges scattered pieces of free space into a contiguous block, preventing fragmentation of newly created files.

* Single File Defragmentation
Can save your time by defragmenting only the files you want instead of defragmenting the entire hard drive.

* Auto-Defragmentation
Can be set to start defragmentation automatically when computer has been idle for 15 minutes.

* File Clusters Viewer
Shows you the list of all fragmented files and their clusters location on the disk after performing disk analysis.

* VSS Compatible Mode
Minimizes growth of the VSS storage area and reduces the chance of overwriting previous VSS snapshots.

Advanced Features
* Defragment & Optimize
Disk Defrag doesn't only defragment files - it can also optimize your hard drives' file system to gain even higher performance. The program's optimization algorithms allow you to defragment free space, move system files to the fastest part of the disk and clear the MFT Reserved Zone from regular files. In addition to that, Disk Defrag is supplied with a powerful engine that can easily defragment large multi-terabyte volumes.

* Free Space Consolidation
Simple defragmentation of data files leaves fragmented free space. This means that there are many free space "holes" all over the disk. Windows fills those "holes" with newly created or extended files. The more fragmented the free space is, the more fragmented new files will be. Disk Defrag merges free space into a large contiguous block during the optimization process. This technology effectively prevents file fragmentation.

* System Files Smart Placement
System files are necessary for the operating system to perform its numerous functions. Commonly used by Windows, system files may be scattered all over the disk and intermixed with regular files. Disk Defrag defragments them and moves them to the fastest part of the disk. Such intelligent way of defragmentation minimizes the time needed to access system files and improves overall computer performance.

* Keeping the MFT Reserved Zone Clear
Normally, NTFS file system reserves about 12,5% of the disk space for the MFT records. However, when the rest of the disk space is getting low, the MFT Reserved Zone is used for storing regular files. This may lead to MFT fragmentation. To prevent MFT fragmentation, Disk Defrag moves regular data files from the MFT Reserved Zone, allowing NTFS to allocate contiguous space for the MFT records.

* Single File or Folder Defragmentation
Sometimes it makes more sense to defragment frequently used files only, instead of defragmenting the entire drive. Disk Defrag can save your time by defragmenting only the files you want. It allows you to defragment a single file, several files or an entire folder. This option is useful when certain files need to be defragmented to speed up an application and there is no need to defragment the entire hard drive.

* List of Fragmented Files
Disk Defrag lists all fragmented files after performing disk analysis. Selecting a file from the list will highlight its fragments' location on the cluster map. You can find the most fragmented files and their paths by sorting through the list. The list also lets you choose files to defragment and files to add to the ignore list. All you need to do is right-click on a file in the list and select the operation you want to perform.

* Auto-Defragmentation
With its auto-defragmentation feature enabled, Disk Defrag acts in real time while your system is idle. Since the program is very compact and requires few system resources, it can easily defragment your hard drives in the background and you will not even notice its activity. Use a handy icon (in the bottom-left corner) to easily customize and control the auto-defrag mode. Just set Disk Defrag to run automatically and you'll forget about file fragmentation!

* Customizing Disk Defrag
Use many handy settings to customize your Disk Defrag. It can be integrated into the Windows Explorer context menu and minimized to system tray on close. The last option is especially convenient when using the auto-defragmentation mode. You can also set the program to shut down your computer after defragmentation is complete. And with its several fragmentation map colour themes you can change the way your Disk Defrag looks.
