YOU ARE A STAR!"
,jmbsc,2012-02-15T21:33Z,thank you again for this one! (Thanks hammerac!) - do you also have some old games by any chance? 
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-15T23:38Z,"You're welcome, jmbsc! What games do you need?"
,Blupo,2012-02-16T00:26Z,"Much appreciation!  Couldn't find an upload here last night and decided to pop one off a torrent site in Spain (Calderon fans I suppose...). Anyway, watched all 4 qtrs, game clock reads 1:01 left to play, and the video just ends... SOoooo pissed. Thx again!"
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-16T00:52Z,"Tell what game is. If I can help, I'll do it."
,Blupo,2012-02-16T04:21Z,"I've been trying, unsuccessfully, to find a copy of the Knicks v. Nets 2.4.2012 game if you could be of any help :) Or anyone point me in a right direction?"
,086A,2012-02-16T04:26Z,thanks for the upload!
,Sullyvillain,2012-02-16T19:31Z,Thanks for this. This is the first basketball game I've ever watched. All this Jeremy Lin talk intrigues me.
,jmbsc,2012-02-16T21:01Z,"Bonsoir Nepotu, I am looking for NBA finals 1993 between Chicago and Phoenix for now - used to have it on VHS but it's all gone now. Thanks for asking..."
[V],Nepotu,2012-02-16T23:23Z,"@all: You are all welcome!

,Blupo,2012-02-20T00:11Z,"Nepotu, You're awesome! Thanks, DL'ing the link now but I'm sure it'll be great.  Much appreciation, I gave up my own search for this one when the overseas sites came up dry.  Way to look out for the minor desires/needs of a complete stranger! :) If only more of the world understood the concept... :)"
,Terry.Jran,2012-02-20T04:04Z,"Wow Nepotu, I'm a big fan. Can you please upload (knicks/jazz 2.6.12) and (knicks/mavs 2.19.12) games? #linsanity. Thanks a million"

@Blupo: I'm happy when a complete stranger (and also a friend) is happy! And, yes, this is the concept..."
