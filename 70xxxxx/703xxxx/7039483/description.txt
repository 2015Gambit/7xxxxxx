This is just something I did for my own listening pleasure - a collection of songs they performed live on CCH. I haven't included anything they did solo, cause together both I want they should sing...

Not every track is particularly listenable, but quite a few are surprisingly(?) good, and also I'm a completist, so... ENJOY, if you like...

I hope to do another volume in the future of songs from their movies.
