From BBC Radio 4. Written by Agatha Christie; Full-cast dramatisation; Adapted by Joy Wilkinson.

Twenty-one year old Rosemary dies at her birthday party after drinking from a glass of cyanide-laced champagne. The small group of friends and family who were present struggle to understand - was it suicide, or could one of them possibly have murdered her? An ex-lover, a younger sister who stood to inherit, a jealous husband? It seems almost all the guests had a motive.
