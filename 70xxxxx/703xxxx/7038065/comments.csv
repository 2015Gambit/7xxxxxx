I won't be seeding at high speed much longer.. I've uploaded 5 terabyte."
,Twilit121,2012-03-20T03:56Z,"Please DONT STOP SEEDING, YOUR WORK IS MUCH APPRECIATED AtotehZ!!! I will seed if given the chance and seeded to!"
,AtotehZ,2012-04-01T19:04Z,"I'm raising the upload to 5MB/s till the 15th of Apr. If you are missing any parts get them in that period of time. After that the speed will be lowered to 1MB/s again.

This should have at least 100 seeders by now I've uploaded it to a ratio of 225."
,AtotehZ,2012-09-19T23:25Z,The speed has been raised to 40Mbit indefinitely.
