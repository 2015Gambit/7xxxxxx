                          =================================





In a feature-length survey of Nazism in the U.S., we trace the history from the fairly benign organization that gave structure to newly arrived German immigrants to today's neo-Nazis who breech the borderline of free speech by using radical action to force their agenda of Aryan purity. It's also a history of the imperfection of American freedom. 


The filmmakers at The History Channel reveal the history of the American Nazi Party and the numerous neo-Nazi parties that still exist to this very day in a revelatory documentary offering extraordinary insight into a chilling subculture of hate. It was during the 1930s that Nazi sentiment first began to appear in the United States. During that time, it helped provide some German immigrants with a feeling of kinship after leaving their home country behind. In the wake of World War II, however, and the atrocities committed against the Jews by the Nazi regime, it became apparent to most Americans that Nazism was indeed a very real threat that needed to be extinguished before it reached epidemic proportions. In this film, American Nazi Party members and various neo-Nazis discuss their reasons for embracing such a universally reviled political doctrine, and law informant officials weigh in on the challenges of battling racially motivated hate crimes across the country.
