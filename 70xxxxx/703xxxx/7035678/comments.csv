If you are using a language ISO, you must ""mount"" it first. DL a program called PowerISO (version 4.7), install it, go through Options, and set number of drives to 1, and then use it to mount the ISO. PowerISO emulates a CD drive so Rosetta Stone looks to that ""Drive"" for the language files.

,ibtc972,2012-03-04T12:10Z,"For anyone curious, you CAN update the language packs without invalidating the patch. 

To do this, uninstall and reinstall the latest language disc [ex. Latin 3] When you reinstall, select ""continue"" and if you are connected to the internet, it will find language pack updates. They take a deceptively long time for their size but I assume they're worth it.

You may have to uninstall and reinstall the latest language disc several times to get fully up to date. Latin is a good language to install and uninstall because it doesn't have any updates for itself."

Have you installed PowerISO?
if so, open it, go to ""options"", ""configuration..."",""Virtual drive"", set ""number of virtual drives"" to 1, ""OK""
(I set the number of drives to 3, so I can mount all 3 language levels at the same time)
Reboot, 
PowerISO icon should be in the taskbar.
right click the icon, 
click on ""Mount image to Drive[whatever it says]""
navigate to where ever you have the language ISO's,
select language level
right click on PowerISO icon again,
you should see something like
""Mount Image to Drive[E:] D:DownloadsRosetta stoneJapanese - Level 1.iso""

(remember, your drive letters & paths are probably different from what I have here, these are just for demonstration.)

If every thing has gone right, go back into Rosetta stone and add the language(s)

,EinDeutschMan,2012-03-08T03:31Z,"@ninesevenfive

When I got this error, it was because I was using the wrong version of Rosetta Stone.
If you have any version of Rosetta Stone EARLIER than v3.3.7, this Japanese language pack (and a few others) won't install.

If you DO have an earlier version, DL this one, and UNINSTALL the version you have, and install this one.

I have used this version of RS with this Japanese language pack, so I know it works.
(I didn't test EVERY language pack, but I DID test any that were requested before ULing them.)

Also, I searched the Rosetta Stone website for this error, and this is what I found, I don't know if it will help with this version.

""I receive error 9114 while installing a Language Level

Error 9114 occurs when TOTALe is unable to transfer files from a Language Level CD to your computer. This error can be caused by a dirty CD or a security program blocking the installation.

Here's how to fix it:

Ensure the CD is free of debris, fingerprints, and scratches.

If you have antivirus software, ensure files from the language installation aren’t being quarantined as false positives. Add exceptions to the antivirus auto-protect feature for the following locations and try language installation again:

Windows XP

    C:Program Files*Rosetta Stone Rosetta Stone TOTALe
    C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersApplication DataRosetta Stone

Windows Vista/7

    C:Program Files*Rosetta StoneRosetta Stone TOTALe
    C:ProgramDataRosetta Stone

,EinDeutschMan,2012-03-09T13:57Z,"@waltiti

I just loaded the English level 1 on my machine, so I don't think there's any problem with the ISO.

I've heard of Daemon tools, but I've never used it, so my question would be is the language showing up in My Computer as a drive? If not that's the problem.

I use PowerISO (just because I'm most familiar with it), and don't have any problems with it.

Try this, use a different ISO software, and if that doesn't work, DL the Language pack again, just to make sure it didn't get scrambled during the DL.

If you still can't get it to work, let me know. I'll be back on later today.

As for your second question, I have tried to manually install the languages, but I haven't found a way to extract the data files correctly. 

I DO know how to RE-INSTALL the languages into RS if you have to re-install the RS program, providing the language files are intact. This saves you the time and hassle of having to reinstall each language and level again.

As a suggestion, when you install the language files, be sure to install them in a separate folder from the Rosetta Stone program. 

I create a folder named Education, and then I create a sub-folder named Rosetta Stone, and install Rosetta Stone there, then I create another sub-folder of Education named Languages, and install ALL the languages to that folder.

Then I back up each folder separately, I've had to reinstall RS, but then I just edit the XML file that's in the The Rosetta Stone sub-folder of ProgramData and I don't have to re-install the languages, but it's tedious.

Then run the patch in the patch folder.

Sorry I haven't replied sooner. 

I did not test EVERY language pack I UL'd, but if someone has a problem, then I check it out.

The error 9114 more than likely has to do with your AV & firewall software.

Try this, ( I did and it worked for me on v3.4.7)

COMPLETELY disable your av software.
UNPLUG your internet connection (yes, I mean physically disconnect it).
Mount the ISO's with whatever you like (I use PowerISO 4.7, but that's just a matter of preference).
Install the language packs.
Enable you AV software
Reconnect your internet connection.

I tested this on the Chinese levels 1 & 2

I'm not sure, but if you did the installation in the order you described, you might have done things out of sequence. If you are in doubt, UN-install your current version, and start over. :-(

1. Block internet
2. Install program (V3), DO NOT run program.
3. Copy files (crack program and Licencingdll.DLL) from Crack folder to program folder where Rosetta Stone is installed and run it. 
(if the crack sets off your AV software, IGNORE IT! I've used this same program for over a year without any problems)
4. Block Rosetta Stone program from internet access.
5. Set your firewall to ""allow trusted outbound"" ONLY!  (or the equivalent.)
 (if you block ALL  internet access, you may get a 1117 error, speech component for voice recognition.)
6. Do NOT update the program!
7. Install language levels 1, 2 & 3.
8. Install v3.4.7 in the same folder as v3 (overwrite the contents).
9. Install language levels 4 & 5.

,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-09T02:36Z,"@morgulwar,

In order for the program to run correctly, you need to DL and install both of these ISO's and follow the directions. That may be why the program crashes, but I'm not sure. 

Are there any error numbers displayed when it crashes?

The v3 of the program is needed to install and activate the language pack(s)
The v3.4.7 of the program is needed to install and run (correctly) language pack(s) levels 4 and 5.

Most of the level 4 and 5 language packs require v3.3.7 or HIGHER (v3.4.7) to install and run (correctly).

1. Block internet
2. Install program (V3), DO NOT run program.
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso
3. Copy files (crack program and Licencingdll.DLL) from Crack folder to program folder where Rosetta Stone is installed and run it.
(if the crack sets off your AV software, IGNORE IT! I've used this same program for over a year without any problems)
4. Block Rosetta Stone program from internet access.
5. Set your firewall to ""allow trusted outbound"" ONLY! (or the equivalent.)
(if you block ALL internet access, you may get a 1117 error, speech component for voice recognition.)
6. Do NOT update the program!
7. Install language levels 1, 2 & 3.
8. Install v3.4.7 in the same folder as v3
(overwrite the contents).
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso
9. Install language levels 4 & 5.

You SHOULD be set.

,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-09T02:39Z,"@chaos986,

The MAIN benefit to upgrading from v3 to v3.4.7 is that some of the language packs require v3.3.7 or HIGHER to install/run correctly.

The v3.4.7 also has the ""homeschool"" curriculum as part of the program.

,EinDeutschMan,2012-04-09T02:44Z,"@chaos986,

The Tracking.db3 file which should be in the C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone  folder, and MAY be hidden, is the file that keeps track of your progress. 

Copy it somewhere else, and after you upgrade, simply copy it back, and you should be set.

This is what pops up when I try to install the Rosetta Stone Program.exe. I've installed v3, patched it, turned off my internet, and wasn't sure if I was meant to move the cracked exe to replace the v3 one until you installed 3.4.7, so I did it both ways and still got the same problem.

First off, thank you for all your hard work into these torrents! 

My problem is that I am trying to install the Latin pack you have uploaded (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7062619/Rosetta_Stone_-_Latin_-_Level_1__2__3). If I try to install it with the v3 I get the error 9114 no matter what I do (I unplugged internet, made sure no antivirus or anything was interfering with it). Then (just to see what would happen) I upgraded to 3.4.7 (this torrent) and the Latin pack installs flawlessly (no errors) but then it shows up as unregistered (which limits available courses). And If I attempt to activate with XXXX's I get error 8118 'There was a minor error click ok to continue'.

I am at a loss any help would be greatly appreciated."

It isn't working for me. I've tried the app with patch and moving the .dll file, just moving the file and no patch, just patching and not moving the file, and with no patch or file exchange. The result is always the same: it installs fine but when I try to launch it, I get a quick flash of the grey RS box with nothing in it and then nothing. Task manager says the program is running and the icon is active in the task bar. 
When I click on the patch button, a window pops up saying that the file cannot be accessed bc it's busy or open. I checked that and it was not active in any way.
Btw, I cut off internet access and anti-spyware/virus for the installation.
Could you look into that?

As long as your Rosetta Stone is in C:/Program Files and NOT C:/Program Files (x86)
Rosetta Stone is a 32 bit program, so it does NOT have to go C:/Program Files (x86)
I did this for people using 32 bit OS's

BUT, what you CAN do is go to C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone and rename the files there to anything you want, then copy the preinstalled version as directed.

That way if you have problems, all you have to do is change the original files back to their original names.

I Installed Rosetta Stone v3.4.7, tested it on 3 machines, 
I then installed Spanish (Latin America) and created an ISO of JUST that language.
I then did the same thing with Latin.
If you use the Rosetta Stone v3 Preinstalled, you will see that both the Spanish and the Latin are already activated.
So, all you have to do (in theory) is copy the Latin language pack to the C:/Program Files/Rosetta Stone/Content folder, and allow it to merge with any other languages you may have.

ALL of the language packs go in the same folder (C:/Program Files/Rosetta Stone/Content)

Are you game...?

Apparently I created some confusion about the two different versions I have UL'd

(http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7198939/Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar and http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035678)/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_w_Patch.iso

What I attempted to do was to eliminate some of the activation issues, and make it easier to install by just having to mount the ISO, and copy the contents to the root of C:

The these two ISO are NOT interchangeable!

I'm sorry for the confusion created

BTW, this is EXACTLY what I did to create the RS Program:
COMPLETELY removed the RS PROGRAM from my machine, including doing a RegEdit.
(I did NOT remove the language packs I had installed)
REinstalled it.
MOVED it FROM C:/Program Files (x86) TO C:/Program Files.
(I did this because I know that it will not work correctly on the older versions of Windows i.e. XP.)
Edit the C:/ProgramData/DynamicStoredPaths.xml file to point to the correct folder - C:/Program Files.
Tested it on 3 different machines 1 - XP 32 bit, 1 - Vista 64 bit, and 1 - Win 7 64 bit
Ran fine
Created the Products.xml file, included the most sought after languages.
Tested it again - ran through all levels of all languages, made sure all components were available.
Created the RS_Preinstalled.ISO
Created the README!!.txt
Created the RSv3PreInstalled.PDF
Combined them into Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar
UL'd it

To create the Language packs:
Installed 1 language, all levels (that I have) to C:/Program Files/Content
Tested it - to make sure that it was activated, and all components were working
(Since it was already activated in the Products.xml file, I did NOT have to do anything more.)
Created the language ISO
I'm sorry if the name doesn't please everybody, but I thought it was short and concise
Created the README!!.txt file
Combined them into the rar file of the same name...
UL'd it.

===========================================================
What files have you DL'd?

Have you installed this ISO FIRST:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035540/Rosetta_Stone_v3__amp_amp__Patch.iso
(It has the activation crack that you will need, 
otherwise you will NOT be able to activate the languages.)
===========================================================

Then you install the v3.4.7 w/patch, 
(That will give you the version you need for the languages that have levels 4 & 5)
===========================================================

Are you familiar with working with ISO's?
Sounds to me like you don't have the language ISO ""mounted"".
===========================================================

Here's what you need to do;
Search for, DL, and install PowerISO4.7

Left click the icon, click ""Open PowerISO"", go to ""options"", ""configuration..."",""Virtual drive"", set ""number of virtual drives"" to 3, ""OK""
(I set the number of drives to 3, so I can mount 3 language levels at the same time, 
 if there are 5 language levels, set the number to 5)

Reboot,
PowerISO icon should be in the taskbar.

Right click the icon,
It will say ""Drive [your drive letter] ""

Click on ""Mount image""
Navigate to where ever you have the language ISO's,

Select language level
Click ""Open""
The dialog box will disappear

Right click on PowerISO icon again,
You should see something like
""Drive[E:] D:/Downloads/Rosetta stone/Japanese - Level 1.iso""

(remember, your drive letters & paths are probably different from what I have here, these are just for demonstration.)

If every thing has gone right, go back into Rosetta stone and add the language(s)

And replace the entries so they look like THIS:

""    activationID XXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXXX activationID""
""     deactivationID/""
""      titleKey PE_FRA_S5_product_set_title /titleKey

""        courses""
(And there would be only 3 lines here: ARA-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3 thru ARA-L3-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3)

""       course SK-FRA-L5-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3 course""
""     /courses""
""   /activation""
""  /activations""

==================================================================
NOTE: I've had problems with certain characters displaying properly in my comments,
So...
Each of the words:
/activations, /activation, /productID, /activationID, /deactivaionID, /titleKey/, /course, /courses
are enclosed in the greater than and lesser than arrows  
==================================================================

After having done this, save and close the Products.xml file.
Restart Rosetta Stone,
and your language(s) SHOULD be activated.

BTW-> you can repeat this process as many times as you want,
substituting the 3 letter code with the one you want to activate.

Are you THOROUGHLY CONFUSED?

,mguichardo,2012-05-08T03:00Z,"Hi thanks for the response.I activated levels 1-3 on all the languages installed, then I upgraded to Version 3.4.7. All the languages were activated from level 1-3.  I attempted to do what you showed here, but now when i open up to rosetta stone's unactivated tab only Level 1 on all the languages I installed show that they need to be activated all the other levels are missing and when I click on the activated tab there is nothing there, it is blank. How will I be able to tell whether or not all the languages are activated or not. What is the limited use on the languages if they are not activated?"

Hi,

I really appreciate the files that u have uploaded but I am really having a hard time installing it to my computer properly.

Can you provide me the file that I need to install first and the process of how I should do the installation.

Than also the file and instruction of what I need to do next. 

I also notice that what you instruct is not exactly what is showing on the file once I try to install it. Kindly be concise.

Thank you."
,PinkArmadillo,2012-05-11T04:48Z,"Thanks so much for all your torrents! I am having trouble so I hope I can ask you a few questions.

 Is it correct that I should install the version 3 that you uploaded before installing this one? Because when I try to install that one, it works fine at first but then when trying to apply your French Level 1 I cannot activate it. When I get to the phone activation stage the 1111 etc. code will not work. Maybe it's because of the patch... when I clicked to install the patch it says ""Cannot access the file. Maybe it's in use... please close the file before patching!"" but I do copy the dll file to the Rosetta Stone app folder. Also, is there a crack folder that I need to copy to the application folder? The only other folder I see is V3 Program Folder and I am not sure whether to copy/paste that and if so where. I am sorry about all of these questions. You have an amazing amount of patience with us - thanks! "
,Wistian,2012-05-13T12:31Z,"I am so absolutely lost on the installation. So I have these files on my computer, untouched:

But now I don't know what to do, I thought I was supposed to install V3, then put in the crack, put languages lessons 1-3 only, but after that I'm stuck. I cant activate them, so I just went along and installed 3.4.7, and put lessons 4 and 5, but then there was an error that completely crashed Rosetta Stone, I have tried installing 3 times, and failed all times. When I installed 3.4.7, I launched the ""Rosetta Stone Updater"" program and then the ""Rosetta Stone Program Installer"", then I put the crack and that's where it all went crumbling down. The instructions didn't really help, so I'm asking you to please tell me what I did wrong. As a note, I want Spanish AND German, I wont be using just one language."

1st off, you are The Man! 2nd, any insight to a setback I've encountered would be appreciated.

I successfully installed the v.3.4.7 Install Program & as well as a few various language levels by burning the ISOs to DVDs using MagicISO Maker & ImgBurn.

THE PROBLEM is that for some reason some of the Levels of the language discs are NOT being recognized by Rosetta Stone.

From what I gleaned, there only needs to be the 4 folders (Data, Documentatin, languages & Speech).

WHAT folders &/or files are needed so that Rosetta Stone can 'see' the Language Level disc?!?

Thanks~"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-15T15:34Z,"TO ALL:

I don't know why I didn't do this earlier,
I have created a SELF EXTRACTING version of the ""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Preinstalled.rar""

Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled.exe

It takes out all of the guess work.

DL this file, extract it, allow it to extract to the default location (C:/)

It will create a ""Rosetta Stone"" folder in Program Files (x86) AND C:/ProgramData.

It will then copy all the files needed to run Rosetta Stone.

You will see that ALL language packs that I have are already activated.

DL whichever language pack(s) you want, as many as you want.
(assuming you have that much free space on your drive)

Extract them, they will copy all of the files needed for that particular language to:
C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/content

Go to the C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 folder.

run the ""RosettaSoneVersion3"" file

Click ""Never register""
At the activation screen, click ""Continue"" 
(you can scroll through the list of languages that are activated if you wish)
Create User

DONE!

NOTE:
I have tested this on 3 machines, 2 Vista's, and 1 Win7.
ALL of the files have been scanned with Vipre 2012, and are clean.

Try this:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe
The instructions are in the comment I posted for that torrent

I created these myself, so you don't have to worry about them being ""clean"".
I ALWAYS scan (with Vipre 2012) the source file before I create the disk

Because TPB has been down for a few days, I haven't been able to UL the rest of the language packs.

The language packs will have this type of name format:
""Rosetta_Stone_v3_Spanish_(LA).exe""

I plan to resume UL'ing language packs later today, 

I'll  put Japanese at the top of the list for you.

I did all you said and received the same quick flash of RS screen and then nothing. Recently, however, my computer caught a bad cold and I wiped it down to a brand new state. I tried installing RS again as per your prescription and it works great.
It seems that one of the RS installations I've tried has left me some kind of a tracking device. I suspected as much and tried to find it but it must have been really well hidden. I even checked the registry. Apparently, a complete wipeout gets rid of it, though :D

Thanks so much for all your help (and the software, of course)!"

Hey, I appreciate everything you upload and it seems you put a lot of work into it, but I have a question. Whenever I download and install this and then put the languages on, it still limits me to the first 2 lessons of unit 1, and I dont have access to the entire program (This is Spanish 1-5 (Latin America)). I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the internet part?  Could you tell me in  a little more detail how exactly you block it from internet access? It always asks me for serial codes, and to my understanding that process shoudln't occur. Thanks in advance."

I have used Rosetta Stone for two weeks and haven't had any problems until today, I encountered the same error 2125

Here's the solution:
1. Find the tracking.db3 file in your appdata folder (for windows 7 its C:programDataRosetta Stonetracking.db3 (hidden folder) and rename it to tracking.db3.bak
2. Restart your computer
3. Launch Rosetta Stone (all your progress has been lost now)
4. Close Rosetta Stone
6. Delete the new tracking.db3
5. Rename tracking.db3.bak to tracking.db3
6. Launch the application again and you can use it again without erasing your progress"
