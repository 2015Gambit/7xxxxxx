Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On this Monday, February 13 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with film, television, stage, and voice actor and former president of the Screen Actors Guild, Ed Asner. Mr. Asner will play the chairman of a new investigation of the September 11th attacks in the film \"A Violation of Trust,\" formerly \"Confessions of a 9/11 Conspirator.\" The film will pit the 9/11 Commission Report and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reports against the work of 9/11 researcher Dr. David Ray Griffin and the scientific research highlighted by leading 9/11 truth organizations, including Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth. 

Alex also runs down the latest news, including the brewing wars against Syria and Iran, Agenda 21, the crumbling economy and influence pedaling be the establishment media.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the \"big 
 picture.\" A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you\'ve researched it yourself.
