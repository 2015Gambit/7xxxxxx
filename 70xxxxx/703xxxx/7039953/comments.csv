,cannedskittles,2012-02-20T06:53Z,"I'm having some issues installing this as a .Sims3Pack. Every time I try to install it through the launcher, the launcher crashes and doesn't install. (""Sims 3 Launcher has encountered an error and is searching for a solution..."") Is there any way this could be uploaded as a .package file? Or if there was a way to convert it from .Sims3Pack to .package? It would be greatly appreciated. :)"
,admz0r,2012-02-20T20:15Z,"@cannedskittles have u updated your game to latest patch? if yes, the problem in your machine :) i don't know about how to convert them, just google it for more information :) "

,admz0r,2012-02-22T15:23Z,"@rayvenyor if it's want to update, then just click on it. (if you're having pirated version, replace the .exe and the tslhost.dll file with your original! Then update. After the update, you should backup your original 2 files, then patch with no-dvd patch. It will work, and allow you to install the store items via the launcher!) Hope this helps."

,PoisonMookie,2012-05-27T18:03Z,"Might sound stupid but to everyone who it isn't showing up in the game for double check that 'run without custom content' in the launcher isn't ticked.
Quite a few people seem to forget about that."
