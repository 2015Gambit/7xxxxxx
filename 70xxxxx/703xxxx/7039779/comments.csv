,voodooi,2012-05-06T16:19Z,"This is by far the worst resume software I have ever encountered. It's not worth your time, guys - look elsewhere. It'll make your resume's look cheap/cheesy ...they will not stand out of a crowd. 

If we were back in the 1990's, then sure this would be good software, but resume's have evolved."
,voodooi,2012-05-06T16:29Z,"Guys - 

Just tried WinWay:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4464388/WinWay_Resume_Deluxe_v.12-cracked.rar

It's x100 better. Get this instead."
