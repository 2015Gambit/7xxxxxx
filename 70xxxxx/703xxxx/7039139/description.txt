[color=red]Plot:[/color]

Photographer Andrew Lindy travelled to Cuba and made a film about prostitution in Cuba. You may like or 
dislike his approach to this hands on film project."I certainly tried to explain that I was not looking 
for prostitutes, although I did explain that many people use prostitution as a means of income subsidy. 
Cuban people are lovely and honorable. If I have a particular point or criticism, it is that people are 
struggling to make ends meet. 80% of the economy is black market, and there is a general sadness in people 
because they lack opportunity. However it is not a restlessness. My sense is that opportunity is so scarce 
that creative drive is quite rare, which means that restlessness is not likely to occur."
