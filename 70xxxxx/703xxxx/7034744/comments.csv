However there us nothing written in the changelog. Could you write what is new in this update? Thanks"
,Wozzle90,2012-02-17T02:02Z,"So, I copied the contents of the Skidrow folder to the install location of CK2 (Program Files x86/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II) and yet when I try to launch CK2 I get the error ""The program can't start because lua51.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem"". 

What'd I do wrong? I'm new to this -_-"
,khardankov,2012-02-17T06:00Z,So does this update to 1.02b? Is this the release-day patch?
,Afatguywithglasses,2012-02-18T10:40Z,"It is the 1.02b version, yes. 

I could use the ""check for update"" button to update to 1.03b after installing this tho, while I couldn't before, nice!"

,Elenbor,2012-08-24T16:07Z,"I am happy to report that I have finally figured out the flag issue. I have spent over a day on this and could not find an answer anywhere.

The flag .tga image files in Install-location/gfx/flags for the Timurids, Il-Khanate and Golden Horde are wrongly labelled as kingdoms instead of empires (change the k at the start of the image file name into an e).

After you have done this delete the UserName/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/gfx   folder so the flag files are loaded again.

With the .tga files wrongly labelled they weren't a part of the flag cache meaning the 3 empires took flags that weren't theirs and all the flags moved 3 places forward messing it all up.

I am not sure if this is in the original version or caused by any of the updates but I experimented and the error always happened to me."
