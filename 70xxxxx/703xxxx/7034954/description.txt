                           DESCRiPTiON 

 n 1998, cinema-goers flocked to see Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan,   
 which featured arguably the most realistic and harrowing depiction of the D-  
 Day landings ever captured on celluloid - then went on to tell the tale of a  
 small unit on a mission to rescue a single soldier whose brothers had all been
 killed in action. This documentary tests the historical accuracy of the       
 opening battle scene, talking to one of the first men to make it off Omaha    
 Beach on D-Day and testing the science behind some of the bullet and mortar   
 shots. It also reveals the background to the US military's 1944 sole survivor 
 policy, which inspired the movie.
                                             
                                 Enjoy!
