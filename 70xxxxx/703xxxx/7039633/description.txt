    A finnish indie horror;                                                  
                                                                             
    A really pessimistic and bloody movie of vampirism whose events take     
    place in 18th century Rumania and in grim and light-snowed modern day    
    Helsinki.                                                                
                                                                             
    It's the middle of 18th century and the Europe's witchcraft trials       
    are coming slowly to their end.There are still a few people that         
    can't recognise the finality of the witchhunts but still continue        
    their path paved with pain, agony and death to rid the world of          
    witchery.                                                                
                                                                             
    One of those in grim and cruel cardinal De Ceville, who wanders the      
    eastern Europe with reverend mother Catharine in religious zeal on       
    their quest to rid the world of witchcraft...Marie, a young and          
    innocent country girl has been seduced by a Satan-worshipping            
    witch-ring and is to take part in a sacrifice that can give an           
    eternal life.                                                            
                                                                             
    A life eternal comes with a price tag, however, and the price is         
    higher than Marie could ever imagine!!! In addition the cardinal and     
    his men are right on the witch-ring's trail...
