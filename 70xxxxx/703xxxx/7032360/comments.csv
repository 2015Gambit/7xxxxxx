,Gkkiux,2012-02-14T22:38Z,When I saw the mod I didn't expect it to be developed into a full game. But it was awesome
[H],HeroMaster,2012-02-14T22:46Z,Good rating for this game don't know how the it got it.
,swatsqad,2012-02-14T23:09Z,anyone got any news about alan wake? can we expect a release before the weekend?
,soncop129,2012-02-15T00:29Z,My game will start up and then a error will pop up plaz help. Thanks in advance
[V],Maverick2587,2012-02-15T01:13Z,The Game not Works.
,ileumfour,2012-02-15T01:32Z,"i love how there are 10 unnecessary text files included lol, but thanks !"
,axel6561,2012-02-15T02:23Z,"Hi I'm not new to torrenting, but after copying the skidrow folder content into the dear esther folder replacing the old files it still fails after starting up the game. It gets as far as the first two screens with the company logos then shuts down saying it's not authentic. What am I doing wrong?"
,CommunistPrime,2012-02-15T02:23Z,"It worked fine for me, just beat the game. Had no errors except for a minor graphical error with water, but it was most likely my computer."
,axel6561,2012-02-15T02:36Z,Did my other comment not post?
,ivanhoe68,2012-02-15T02:52Z,"Remember that the crack is in the iso file, not the downloaded map. Not the ""Thanks"" map, skidrow map. You need to copy the ""bin"" map in the skidrow mao, and paste it in the installation directory.

Made the same misstake myself =) "
,Trenkos,2012-02-15T03:08Z,There is no skidrow folder in your download
,CommunistPrime,2012-02-15T03:12Z,"You placed the files inside the bin folder inside the skidrow folder in the bin folder, that might be your problem."
[V],boobsman,2012-02-15T09:58Z,"@ ileumfour, the 10 txt files are unnecessary for TPB however needed for other sites to get upload credit / site friend status. If you don't want them then delete however you may need them one day if TPB closes :("
,LaNPaRtY1987,2012-02-15T11:49Z,good game!
,gimotan12,2012-02-15T15:53Z,"WOW!!!!
the graphic texture is soo good. but the game is creepy, i was wondering around on the shore beside a shipwreck, then looking around, then a sudden, a person.. i think appeared on the clift, i was looking in to it, and its moving too fast and suddenly stop at the edge of the clift, i rush in to it and when i reach where it stands theres no one there, ngek, it gives me a goosebumps, the maker of this game is brilliant. im just starting the game but its full of mystery, can anyone tell me if what mod is this before, i mean a mod of what game? thanks for the uploader by the way... and for the maker of this kind of game...."
,gimotan12,2012-02-15T15:55Z,oh now i found it that this is a mod for half-life 2 hehehe
,mrnexus,2012-02-15T17:43Z,"@boobsman can you tell me when you will get binary domain and The syndicate please thks for all ur uploads as well,please reply m8."
,heretic_1808,2012-02-15T18:11Z,"Can't even find the words to describe this fantastic game, played the original mod for hl2 and i can't believe this is how far the source engine has come. Definitely going to go buy this one to support Thechineseroom, can't wait for their next game (everybody's gone to the rapture)!"
[V],boobsman,2012-02-15T19:38Z,"@ gimotan12 this was a HL2 mod but its been developed into a standalone game.

@ mrnexus as soon as there release i'll upload :)"
,mrnexus,2012-02-15T20:00Z,"Thanks boobsman m8 for the reply,i hope they come soon :).ps 20 days to mass effect 3 or 23 if ur in uk hopefully less boobsman ;):)"
,tpb3571,2012-02-16T05:39Z,"this game... no wait, story is awesome!!!!!"
,soncop129,2012-02-16T05:57Z,figured it out. The game looks good but its super boring! I dont know why everyone likes this game. Its only like an hour long too. Like wtf?
,onett_home,2012-02-16T06:09Z,"Take that, indie gaming!"
,gimotan12,2012-02-16T09:15Z,"@ soncop129 

---but its a good game, imagine if its put in any mystery game its a good hit, the graphics is fantastic, i hope that in the future the developer will put a story in it (a good story somehow),"
,PoppaChubbie,2012-02-16T19:08Z,"Works perfectly on win7 x64. Yes this has beautiful, realistic graphics but I'm not sure it qualifies as a game: I ""played"" it for about 45 mins or so and I couldn't find anything to interact with; just slowly walking around, reading the depressing letter excerpts. I only stayed with it that long cos I thought something MUST happen eventually but nope, not for me; finger got tired constantly holding down the w key. Anyway, thanks for this one uploader and cheers to fellow seeders as well; I appreciate the chance to check it out."
,rich10514,2012-02-17T03:20Z,"@swatsqad I wouldn't worry about it. Alan Wake should be called Alan Sleep. Many other psychological thrillers were much more than that game. Give it a play if you want, but don't lose sleep over it..."
,h7zn,2012-02-19T07:20Z,"Steam authentication failed.
I copied everything from the SKIDROW folder to both 'bin' installation folders (separately)."
,PoWaShifteR,2012-02-21T15:15Z,didnt heard about this game.However it has good rting.I m gonna give it a try
,jonpavlic,2012-02-27T20:31Z,"For confused ones (like me): You must open the disk image with WinRAR, and then you will get the SKIDROW file. :)"
,SpoonyOne,2012-03-02T15:35Z,"@ jonpavlic

What are you talking about? Just follow the instructions:

Mount
Install
Crack
Play

No fuss.

@ h7zn

This is not connected to steam, what are you talking about? If you follow the instructions it will work 100% perfect.

@ rich10514

Well, if people don't like Alan Wake I guess they won't like this either. Both games are not to be seen as games - AW's gameplay is infact not that good - they are to be seen as stories that you become a part of.

Some people find that boring, others like it - I can understand both opinions.

So... if you (all) want to try out a new experience, give it a go! You can always go back to CoD afterwards..."
,clorf01,2012-03-11T02:28Z,"Very lovely game and excellent torrent

There isn't much interaction you can do with the environment in this game other than walk, zoom and take screenshots, but that doesn't mean that the game is any less entertaining or meaningful as any other.

I think the best way to experience this game is like this: 

For the the first playthrough you should simply focus on the story and exploration, try to unravel this complex story as best you can for the first time around. 

For the second playthrough utilize the screenshot feature. Focus on the nature and beauty of the island and capture what every you feel is significant to you (just push the screenshot button and the shots should be in the game directory C:/Program file/thechineseroom and so on)

For the Third playthrough the focus should be on the screenshot taking feature again but instead of the landscape try to capture important story elements and try to piece them together.  This story has multiple interpretations.

Enjoy this beautiful game and support the company if you can, creativity like this just doesn't come from the big name companies"
,zanrivers,2012-03-24T01:30Z,"i swear i don't know how to play this game,i just walking around the bay untill im bored n the path is get me nowhere. still don't know what to do"
,KayBayAllDay,2012-03-25T23:55Z,Works perfectly thanks!
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-04-30T12:57Z,"Dear Ester,
You took longer to download than you did to finish.

This was a good game. Not sure why... 

Would have benefited from a couple things.
1. Footsteps - boh in the sand, and sound.
2. Ripples in the water from water drops.
3. View bobbing
4. Charcacter reflection in water.

Other than that, the only thing this needed to look absolutely amazing would be to have it in 3d. If i could play the cave section in 3d i would possibly have spent hours playing this game.

The story didn't live up to expectations...

Not sure how i would have felt about purchasing this game.. Like i said, its a good game, but it looks more like a demo showcasing a game engine.

Works perfectly if you follow the instructions - win7 x64 "
,markyyy999,2012-05-01T01:15Z,thanks
,bluevsred,2012-05-03T00:49Z,Seed?
,gnrlchf,2012-05-19T22:03Z,sorry im a bit new to the whole pirating thing but how do i crack the game? do i have to move the skidrow.nfo file? or also the .iso? and where do i place the crack?
,Hazode,2012-05-28T15:59Z,"Thank you for this upload, downloaded in around 10 minutes as well! Dear Esther is an amazing game... if you can call it a game, it's more of an interactive story IMO. But it has stunning graphics and a top-notch poetic storyline, although I've only played it once and apparently every playthrough is unique. Either way, incredibly short game, but also incredibly amazing and beautiful. Found it very immersive and atmospheric. And even though all you do is walk and explore, I still found it a breathtaking game. Will seed, and once pay-day comes around, I'll buy this mother. It only costs about ÂŁ5, which is definitely worth it."
,guitboxdude25,2012-06-28T00:59Z,"Thanks for the download first of all but I could use some assistance you see when I open the game the screen is black, but I can hear the game running. I do not have steam and I'm 99 percent sure I downloaded everything correctly including moving the skidrow file "
,ConcernedEnt,2012-07-17T18:52Z,"Okay so, I got the Steam activation failed message. I tried to follow the instructions, but I don't have the Skidrow folder. I only have the ""Thanks' folder, the Skidrow system information file, the .iso, and a text document. Any help?"
,ConcernedEnt,2012-07-17T18:55Z,"Nevermind, got it.

To those of you who don't have the Skidrow folder, it's not in the download folder, but in the .iso. Right click the drive that the .iso is mounted on and hit ""Explore"". 

It should be there."
,Nionb,2012-07-20T01:12Z,@boobsman do you know where the photos are saved cause i have no idea ^
,Nionb,2012-07-20T13:56Z,Come on guys i really want those screenshots tell me where they are saved .-.
,andresec,2012-07-26T05:28Z,"After some tries i got it, just copy the 3 files inside the SKIDROW folder:
SKIDROW
steam_api.dll
Steamclient.dll
then go to your game installation and paste them in the bin folder, thats all. Awesome game."
,Viciously,2012-09-17T03:37Z,Thanks.
