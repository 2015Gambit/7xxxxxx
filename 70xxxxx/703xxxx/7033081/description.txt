"Jimmy's Fake Girlfriend"

Jimmy's spirits are low when Sabrina's 
relationship with Wyatt becomes serious, so 
Virginia and Burt convince him to create a 
make-believe girlfriend to make her jealous. 
Barney invites Jimmy to his improv class, 
where he meets Mary-Louise who agrees to 
play along with his plan to win over 
Sabrina. But when their acting becomes too 
convincing and Sabrina falls for their fake 
relationship, all plans might backfire on 
Jimmy.
