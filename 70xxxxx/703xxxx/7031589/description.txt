Fallen Angels hailed from Washington DC, an area that in the mid 60's, was a breeding ground for rock bands and where such artists as Jim Morrison (Doors), Roy Buchanan, Mama Cass Elliot, EmmyLou Harris and many more got their start. The Fallen Angels were formed in 1966 and recorded two LPs for the Roulette label. Both of the albums have been re-released on separate CD's as The Roulette Masters Parts 1 & 2. The music of the Fallen Angels was aimed for a pop audience as the label was trying to repeat the success of it's major act, Tommy James and The Shondells. It proved that The Fallen Angels were much too "far out" for the commercial radio audience and despite good sales of the first album, the band was dropped by their label after recording a second album entitled Its A Long Way Down. Both album remain prime examples of psychedelic pop music which many band's in the late 90's are trying to copy. ~ Keith Pettipas
