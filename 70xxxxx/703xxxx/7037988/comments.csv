    Hour 1:
    The attempt to smear Rick Santorum
    The attempt to smear Rick Santorum

    The contraception cloud around Rick Santorum has yet to lift in the media despite Santorum's clear views on the issue. Since when did having your own personal beliefs that you are not forcing on others become a bad thing? It's not, unless your own beliefs are at odds with the media elites and those on the left who want to drive religion out of the public sphere.

    Kathryn Jean Lopez, editor-at-large of National Review Online, talks with Raymond about why Mitt Romney is failing to connect with conservatives and why Rick Santorum's stance on contraception shouldn't hurt him with women.

    Hour 2:
    A devil in the details of ObamaCare
    A devil in the details of ObamaCare

    President Obama was in Wisconsin yesterday whipping up a crowd of blue-collar voters. The GOP candidates are trying to do the same, but the passion displayed by Obama should give Republicans concern when it comes to our eventual nominee's ability to connect with working class voters. Which one of the GOP candidates is best equipped to connect with and energize working class Americans in the all important swings states of the rust belt?

    Dorlinda Bordlee, senior counsel for the Bioethics Defense Fund, talks with Raymond about how Americans are unknowingly paying for abortion procedures because of ObamaCare and why this violates the Free Exercise Clause in the Constitution.

    Hour 3:
    Your not-so-private life on Facebook
    Your not-so-private life on Facebook

    While the left tries to confuse the issues of contraception and religious freedom Republicans are standing strong for religious liberty as the battle over the HHS mandate continues to drive the national conversation. The GOP must not back down in this fight.

    Lori Andrews, distinguished professor law at the University of Chicago Kent College of Law and author of ""I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did: Social Networks and the Death of Privacy,"" talks with Raymond about how Facebook and other websites track every move you make online and why you should never assume that what you are doing online will stay private."
