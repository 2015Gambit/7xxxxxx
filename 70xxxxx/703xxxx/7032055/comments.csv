,kidcali217,2012-06-30T03:21Z,@Skyward15 the screen turned black for me too but just restart it and it will work again
,mattchoi365,2012-06-30T14:38Z,"great! no lag! no multiplayer though, but you can play on CRACKED servers. however good graphics cool single player missions and greatly it works. i recommend this app. just download and launch it about two times. the first try it may be a black screen but just press ""esc"" then ""enter"" and you will be redirected to finder. then launch the game for the second time and it will work. great game. however i am having trouble with the name. i need to know how to change the name of the player. but it really doesn't matter."
,mattchoi365,2012-06-30T14:45Z,"i have read the comments and heard that people are having trouble to launch this game. well what you do is double click ""left for dead"" icon and the game will start. it will be a black screen and then you press ""esc"" on your keyboard. then the screen will turn white with thin black bars at each side of the screen. press ""esc"" again and the screen will turn black. now the screen is black but you can hear the music and sounds. now press ""enter"" on your keyboard and you will be redirected to finder on your macbook. now launch the game again for the second time but this time it will work. instead of a black screen, it will say ""left for dead"" and the story mode will begin. have fun and enjoy. if you still need help, put it in the comments. :)"
,M-ish,2012-07-01T22:12Z,does not work on 10.6.8 snow leopard
,sugih19,2012-08-07T17:41Z,"if the screen turns black, turn off your internet connection first"
