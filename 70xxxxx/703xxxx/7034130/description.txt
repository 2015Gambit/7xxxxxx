Notes: 
Sorry for my english.
I made this for play LAN with friends, but I'm glad if someone need this too! 
In the patch 1.98 two defensive skirmish missions (jap and ger) don't work, but I fix it. Game was patched to v. 2.00.11 - the latest one.
GSM (German Soldiers Mod) is a best, freeware german mod, for original MoW and AS. It totaly changes mechanics of play,add 3 new factions, add LOTS of new units... Well, loook to modder's wibsite. Last version - 6.5
By the way, the mod may be plugged optionally, you also can play in original game.

Cheers!
