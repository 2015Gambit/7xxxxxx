[T],theburningbush,2012-02-14T22:38Z,"1. WHERE OH WHERE are sceneline, TvTeam, etc. on this week's Skins?

2. Maybe, like http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7031658/Skins.S06.E04.PDTV.XviD , this torrent will finally, after several hours, have availability greater than 0.000.

3. If this torrent ever does work, then I can vouch for it being good, since I DL'd this file from a different source, and it has the exact byte-count as this one.

4. If this torrent ever does come through, perfect English subtitles are available for it at http://www.addic7ed.com/serie/Skins/6/4/1 ."
