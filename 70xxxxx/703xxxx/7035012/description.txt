Bugs signs him up as a muffin man for EnormoCorp. Daffy comes across Foghorn Leghorn's meeting and makes fun of his personality behind the window. What 
sounds like direct insults to Foghorn actually inspires Foghorn to make Daffy his advisor, and eventual successor as CEO. However, Daffy's reliance of 
Foghorn's advice on asking the muffin man for help ends up sinking the company when he mistakes Pete Puma for the new muffin man who gives Daffy terrible 
advice which was the opposite of the "Delay the Merger" choice. Elmer Fudd later reports that EnormoCorp has gone bankrupt following a bad business deal 
and many of its workers are now out of a job which may have a serious effect on the economy. He also states that CEO Daffy has yet to comment on this.
