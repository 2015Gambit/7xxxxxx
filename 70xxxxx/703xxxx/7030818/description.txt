Special note:

On some antivirus scans, FFF releases packages can reveal
"Type_Win32" or "Trojan_Type" virus...
Don't be stupid! It is not a virus nor anything else like
that. It is just some packers/cryptors which have the
same binary signature.

However, some crackhosts can modify or add malicious
things on FFF releases (like "crack.exe"), so please,
TAKE CARE.

Remember:
You've downloaded this software and you're using a crack.
It's your choice... Not mine. So, don't blame me.
