    notes: Please notice that the burned subtitles (in the dvd) overlay      
    both active video and matting (black bars), therefore cropping to the    
    bottom of the subtitles is permissible, and an equal amount of           
    matting shall be left at the top. See tdx. This means that AR is 1.6.    
    Enjoy!

    Nine-year old Andreas carries the heaviest burden. At his mothers        
    birthday party he and his beloved brother Mikkel performed and           
    Andreas got drunk on Martini. The following morning their father         
    drove Mikkel to school on his motorbike, but they crashed and Mikkel     
    is dead and their father is tormented. The family moves to begin         
    again, but not even the new school and the new friends he makes can      
    ease his enormous pain.
