They've ""mentioned"" this? That's like saying ""buddy we're stealing your TV, just so you know, but if we like it maybe we buy one legit.""

Most people are not gonna do that.

I bought my copy on steam and geesh it's awesome, storytelling in games at its best. Alan Wake is very unique and these specific developers should be encouraged to make new games.

A lot of the - dare I say it? - 12-year-olds on this site don't understand this. I'd just hate to see Alan Wake 2, if it was to be made, suffer the same close call fate as Alan Wake 1."

,Made1985,2012-02-17T11:03Z,with it off you have nothing displayed like health etc. 
,xxela,2012-02-17T12:00Z,"@SpoonyOne 
First of all there are people who buy the game from the first time,people which will not buy it anyway 
and people who try the game before they buy it. 
Anyway the producers dont lose nothing because of piracy on the contrary they win the people who try, like it and then buy the game. 
This people (maybe not many but some) would not buy it if they would not have the chance to try it.
As for the ones who dont buy it they would not purchase the game in no case, even if they dont have piracy as a source. 
On the other hand who wats to play this games have to invest in serious hardware and give money to Amd or Nvidia who 
in their turn sponsor the major manufacturers of games.
So bottom line is that piracy more helps than hurts.
And for your stupid tv analogy I dont think you buy a black box only because some guy tells you is a awesome tv inside.
I and I speak only for myself dont want to buy a game like Battlefield 3 (no ofense for Battlefield fans just seems boring to me)
and end up with some benchmarking tool for my GPU. "

,jaxx1rr,2012-02-19T12:34Z,"@SpoonyOne
the only reason this charade of TRADING INFORMATION FOR ENERGY continues is because we THE PEOPLE allow it..
Selling something that exists only in informational form is absurd, because the generated revenue far outweights the financial merit of the product, this is why artists go bad, and why 5% of the profits go to the actual developing team, the rest go to ceo's and fat maggot shareholders.. And we all know who controls the banks, governments and (film,music,game) media of this planet so I guess I don't have to mention that.. But one day this whole charade will end..."

This game is a psychological thriller, mean it takes a few braincells the process the story and type of story this game holds.

If you know the works of Stephen King and watched Twilight Zone growing up, you'll know that this story line is genius. As L.A. Noire is to CSI and NCIS, Alan Wake is a work of art and just perfect as a game."

Just wish the game didn't require Anti-Aliasing, I prefer smooth gameplay over lagging any day. Also, if you want to disable the motion blur, go to the game's desktop icon and click on Properties. In the target box, make a space and type '-noblur' at the end of the command line. However, it messes with the grass effects though."

There's a large truck blocking the way, according to the walkthroughs I've seen on youtube, you're supposed to be attacked by a excavator and there's not supposed to be any holes in the bridge at all, but since it is, it's impossible to pass. This is the first bug I've experienced so far, great game otherwise. "
,GooseTav,2012-03-29T12:06Z,"Since I really want to finish the game, I would love some help D: I play on normal difficulty, don't know if it makes any difference....:O"
,badger420,2012-03-31T10:16Z,Works great ran the whole first episode with out any problems. Crossfire works with Cats 12.3 and caps 12.3 v1. Excellent frame rates very smooth game with every setting maxed in custom never below 60FPS. Game has a very good story line honestly that is what makes the game because the game play is a little slow but a great fresh idea for a game!!

,piizda,2012-04-30T00:49Z,"This game realy sucks
1. Cand disable blur effect and glow effect.
2. 3rd person wiev characters position is on the right far side what makes hardly stupid to walk.
3 No hud"
,boyznacne,2012-04-30T22:33Z,"@piizda WTF are you complaining about?

The HUD is in the upper left and right side of the screen. It can be disable/enabled in Options.

To change the view of the 3rd person camera, press the Tab key. It will switch between the left and right side view.

Go here to disable motion blur: http://benchmark3d.com/alan-wake-motion-blur-disabler
