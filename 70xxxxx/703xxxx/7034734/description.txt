RELEASE NOTES

When the wife of the best-selling writer Alan Wake disappears on their
vacation, his search turns up pages from a thriller he doesn't even
remember writing. A Dark Presence stalks the small town of Bright
Falls, pushing Wake to the brink of sanity in his fight to unravel the
mystery and save his love.

Presented in the style of a TV series, Alan Wake features the trademark
Remedy storytelling and pulse-pounding action sequences. As players
dive deeper and deeper into the mystery, theyll face overwhelming
odds, plot twists, and cliffhangers. Its only by mastering the Fight
With Light combat mechanic that they can stay one step ahead of the
darkness that spreads across Bright Falls.

With the body of an action game and the mind of a psychological
thriller, Alan Wake's intense atmosphere, deep and multilayered story,
and exceptionally tense combat sequences provide players with an
entertaining and original gaming experience.

Includes Alan Wake Special Episodes "The Signal" and "The Writer"
