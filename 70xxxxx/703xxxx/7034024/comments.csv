Is a .reg file to apply, nothing and work fine."
,Td2j,2012-02-16T00:44Z,"Thanks for your reply nikita200. I used it as a .reg file and I got a prompt to confirm the registry entry... but when starting the program, it still says it's a trial version and asks for a license key (mail + serial).
I don't know what's going wrong as I just replaced the previous version by the new one.
Any idea to help me make it work ?
Thanks"

I think .reg file work fine in 32 bit SO.

In 64 bit SO should be modified the .reg file (Wow6432Node).

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Licenses]

I can't test."

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Licenses] must be edited"
