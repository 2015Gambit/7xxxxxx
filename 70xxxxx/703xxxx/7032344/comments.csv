,Releece,2012-02-15T00:14Z,"No problem!
It's getting really busy on this one right now, so hang in there. It went from 250 to 1100 peers in the last 2 hours..."
[T],theburningbush,2012-02-15T11:36Z,"Well, here we go again, this time with Shameless, UK version. Specifically, Shameless.UK.S09E07. sceneline, TvTeam, etc., who are normally pretty zippy about getting these UK programs out, are asleep at the wheel this week. Even demonoid has nothing for this episode.

?????????, i.e., WTF?"
,Releece,2012-02-15T23:54Z,I have absoluteley no idea what's going on... Doesn't make sense
