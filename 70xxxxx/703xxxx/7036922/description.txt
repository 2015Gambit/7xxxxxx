Federal Agent Jack Bauer can't afford to always play by the rules. 
As a member of the L.A. Counter Terrorist Unit, Jack must stop bombs, 
viruses, assassination attempts, and usually save someone he cares 
about at the same time. Every season of this series has 24 episodes, 
each unfolding in real time following a consecutive hour in 
one very bad day.
