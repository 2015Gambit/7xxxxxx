Sam helped put the beat behind the blues, drumming for Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Jimmy Reed and more (not to mention Bob Dylan on Highway 61 Revisited ). His own band shines on this LP, which has been out of print for many years: 
When you talk about Blues drumming you have to talk about Sam Lay the man who put the beat behind the Blues, truly a living legend. He worked with Howlin' Wolf, with whom he played both live and on countless hit records. He was with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and while with Butterfield backed Bob Dylan on his first electric gigs, including the infamous 1965 Newport Folk Festival.
