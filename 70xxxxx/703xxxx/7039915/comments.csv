,patrickl96,2012-03-17T23:52Z,"**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

Ok the program works but im now facing problems after having it after a month or so, my laptop will keep blue-screening every 10 mins or so, so i'm not sure if it's something wrong with my laptop or this software is dodgy as it may contain a backdoor and install unwanted maware and viruses so i would use this with caution.

,Lunacurd,2012-08-13T22:54Z,"hi,i got the soft working and all :) but now for some reason it wont let me update virusdatabase or let me even use the software :/ its giving me 0x80004002 error code and stops working"
,RafVne2,2012-08-22T20:33Z,"@patrickl96 I don't know if it has back door or not, but I am sure that this software doesn't play well with win 7 and with win 8 won't boot error page fault in non paged something something... I've been working on that damn thing for the last... a week or so, trying to make it work, but at least i did figure out, that it is in fact comodo, that stops win8 from booting, and that's most important... to find the cause, and your issue is in 88% solved... problem is software registers as desktop interactive service, except win7 and win 8 don't allow those by default...

hey here you go direct links to their website (i'll copy them from freedownloadmanagers history, (I always keep long history), if someone doesn't trust this source...
C:DownloadsSoftwarecfw_installer_x64.exe
C:DownloadsSoftwarecfw_installer.exe


now here is the most important one for windows 8
they fixed it , but do not update this one, because it will update to a regular one and you won't boot again... DONE IT, trust me...
C:DownloadsSoftwareCIS_Setup_x64.msi

I could've mixed them up cause they don't have descriptions. you'll figure it out...

NOW... who's gonna hook me up with nice fresh (juicy? naaahhh)_ 12mo's free lic number hu?... 
he he he... come on guys don't be like that...... the last one here is good for three mo's? ah well, good enough for now... take care"
,RafVne2,2012-08-23T05:39Z,it won't let me post links
,gazmakka,2012-09-11T12:08Z,"Neither license keys given work now. I just downloaded this and tried both. Have to be connected to the Internet to activate so cannot do the key validation off line or on safe mode. Get message saying "" A slight problem. (Invalid License Key-Error # 12)
Bummer really. I will just have to try find another key.
Thanks anyway shailindramaxx, I'm sure that the keys were good back in March when you put the new one here, but it would seem that Comodo might have their game in the bag.
I noticed that the keys you gave contain lower case letters and I cannot get them to enter as lower case. They all type in as uppercase letters.
And cutting/pasting just does not work. It cannot be done. So, I don't know what the problem is.
Oh well, that's life. Cheers."
,gazmakka,2012-09-11T12:41Z,"Yay, I got one t only licensed me for 53 days. Here it is.

Notice the capital letters.......that is what the key was given as and it worked. So maybe your keys didn't work for me because they should have been as you gave them, lowercase letters. But I couldn't enter them as lowercase and I did not have caps lock on.
Strange indeed.
All good for 53 days anyway."
