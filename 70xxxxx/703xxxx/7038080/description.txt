Chronicle.2012.720p.V2.ENCode001.DivX.avi

Basically ALL I did was take inferno\'s 720p CamRip (a/v) and run it through alot of filters. Encoded it once trying to brighten and sharpen then a second time to darken and work on contrast. Result looks pretty good imho. Hope you guys like it. if not, oh well it was free. :)
