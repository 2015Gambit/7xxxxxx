,minkaihsu,2012-02-17T02:50Z,77.79.9.35???
,minkaihsu,2012-02-17T02:59Z,very very slow......
,stacheman,2012-02-17T03:07Z,"Uploading at 500K, please return the favor"
,Corininha,2012-02-17T03:11Z,"There's another torrent elsewhere but has 3.8 GiB instead. 

BTW... It works really slow. I am taking both and hope one will be ready by morning. :D"
,alkwef,2012-02-17T03:21Z,DLing at a decent speed but I can't seem to upload and I feel terrible... I have tried Unlimited and Automatic for the Upload section (using the BT app) and I also tried setting 500 kb/s upload and seeding speeds but it still stays at 10kb/s max and sometimes hovers at less than 1.0!. Anyone have tips? This happens with a lot of torrents although for one of them I spontaneously was able to get 1 MB/s upload sometimes. Also I'm going through a VPN to avoid throttling (but still get 5.72Mb/s DL and 1.76 Mb/s UL in speediest so can't be that)
,alkwef,2012-02-17T03:24Z,alright uploading at 150 kb/s
,fuhqued,2012-02-17T03:26Z,"If people would quit dicking off downloading the broken torrent, this one may seed faster!  Unfortunately I can't use my seedbox on this one since it's a public torrent site.  >"
,fuhqued,2012-02-17T03:29Z,"@alkwef- My seedbox doesn't allow public torrents, but if you are really serious about seeding to different places, you could rent a seedbox that does allow public torrents.  There are a few out there that do.  :)

I appreciate your effort either way.  "
,MunkySoup,2012-02-17T03:35Z,"@ go6ovei: You're a dumb ass.

@ everyone else: I'll let you guys know how the install goes.

@ iMZDL: Thanks for the up, dude."
,MunkySoup,2012-02-17T03:39Z,"By the way, fellas... the best way to try this out would be to create a partition with the Boot Camp Assistant and then install this onto the newly made partition. That way you don't have to completely redo everything on your Mac or whatever ailments may befall you for trying out a Developer Preview release. Once you're done you can just restore your Mac back to normal via Boot Camp Assistant."
,fuhqued,2012-02-17T03:54Z,"@MunkySoup- I know, right?  Some people always yell about things getting screwed up because they use it incorrectly or on Windows people are always screaming about virus false positive.  :P"
,fuhqued,2012-02-17T03:56Z,Could a TPB mod delete that broken torrent that iMZDL uploaded before this one?  So many resources are being wasted on that one.  -sad face-
,fuhqued,2012-02-17T04:01Z,"@MunkySoup- Meh, I'm just running my SSD right now, which is 60gb.  Your advice is great for anyone with a bigger hdd though.  ;)

If things get screwed up, I'll just use my time machine backup on my external drive to restore back to what I have now.  I have a 500gb Passport for that sort of thing.  I don't want to install this to that drive or to another regular hdd if I could dig one up, since I want to see how it runs on my ssd.

I don't anticipate any problems though, I have ran so many devel previews of so many different things over the years and haven't ever totally borked anything up.

But I agree, if anyone has anything of value on their hdd, so as MunkySoup said, or back your crap up like I do.  Never know when there could be a major malfunction."
,cuperty,2012-02-17T04:04Z,What is the MD5 Checksum code?
,Dirty50ck5,2012-02-17T04:05Z,"Alternatively to MunkySoup's suggestion, if you don't have a lot of extra internal HDD space to spare (for example my MBP is already pretty full up from my Lion and Win 7 partitions as is), you should be able to install it on an external HDD. I did this with the Lion preview when I was testing it out."

,Corininha,2012-02-17T11:26Z,go6ovei LOL Nice job bro! Too bad people didn't got the joke that was a continuity from the other torrent. Keep it up! I enjoyed the rage after your comment. 
,e4p-tpb,2012-02-17T12:36Z,Downloaded @ 800+ I am exploring it. Great upload ever!
,ramvi,2012-02-17T13:04Z,Please note that Xcode doesn't work when you install this. You will need Xcode 4.4. Anyone know where to get this without buying an OS X Developers key?

,BoMcM,2012-02-17T16:33Z,checked and working nice update but should be free in my eyes just a few apps from iOS and deeper iCloud integration which should be free for all at-least seems pretty solid on my late 2009 macbook 4gb ram which just made the grade so anyone who can update should runs smoother than lion did when it was released in my eyes so download now its worth it.

,capoeira4u,2012-02-18T03:37Z,Mountain Lion freed up 20GB of space from my MacBook Air.  Awesome!  Did anybody else notice this?
,IAmXerXes,2012-02-18T03:52Z,"To all of the dummies out there complaining that this doesn't work, just take a second, read your comment before you post, make sure you REALLY want to write it...then delete it.

1) If you don't know what you're doing on a hackintosh, then wait for someone smarter than you to figure it out. 

2) If you are trying this on an older mac, it probably won't work. Unless you have a 2009 macbook, a 2008 macbook aluminum, an aluminum macbook pro, a macbook air, a newer iMac or a newer Mac Pro, this probably will not run.

3) If you don't even have a backup of your boot drive and files, then I almost think you deserve to have your files wiped.


That's all, don't forget to seed :)"
,alkwef,2012-02-18T04:02Z,"@everyone who's asking if you need to be a developer
Apple is already giving developers the download. WHy do you think this was uploaded? Common sense guys!
Little Snitch does NOT work; BetterTouchTool seems to be fine. Parallels 7 didn't work for me.
Just remember to use Time Machine BEFORE you do this, even if you're just copying it to another partition on the same drive. "

Disable their Firewall (Both in the router and the computer they're using). After downloading, the torrents should be work great for them without missing files."

Just make sure you clear your NVRAM to fix the issues, it seems to be stuck with the Lion NVRAM settings after upgrading. To clear, just hold Command, Option, P, and R and turn it on and make sure to press before the screen turns on, hold it until the machine restarts two times"
