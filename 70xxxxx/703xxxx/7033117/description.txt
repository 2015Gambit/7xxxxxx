Whereas mathematics proper makes little appeal and seems even less pointed to most of these students, the subject becomes highly significant to them when it is presented in a cultural context. In fact, the branches of elementary mathematics were created primarily to serve extra-mathematical needs and interests. In the very act of meeting such needs each of these creations has proved to have inestimable importance for man's understanding of the nature of his world and himself.
