- ARTIST
Genesis are an English rock band that formed in 1967.
Starting with their second album they became a progressive rock band with the incorporation of complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation. Their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, extravagant costumes and on-stage stories. This phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23 minute "Supper's Ready" and the 1974 concept album "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway".
In the late 70's and early 80's the band's musical direction changed, becoming more pop oriented and commercially accessible. 
Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.
