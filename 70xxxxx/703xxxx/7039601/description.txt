When Evil comes for the people you love, what will you do? That moment of reckoning has arrived for Ethan Black, a young man whose bride-to-be was snatched up in the blink of an eye by a terrifying menace known as the Faceless Ones. Guide Ethan as he explores a decimated city, interacts with its remaining inhabitants, searches for clues that will lead him to his beloved Clair, and peels back the layers of a chilling supernatural mystery that began with the stroke of a paint brush and will end in a dramatic confrontation near a fiery abyss.
