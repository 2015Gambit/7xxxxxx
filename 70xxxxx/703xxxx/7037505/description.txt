K so we were given a avi file on this one
which was not the greatest quality at all
but gave it some TLC and got the COMPLETE
LiNE audio as well so big thanx to Littlebird 
for the audio. Now it's still pretty dark in some
scene's but atleast here is a complete
TS version for you to watch with no
camera movement. Sorry bout the wait but
we were busy with some other stuff along
chopping up the line from the original release
and filling in the spots with cam audio before 
the complete line was available. And we rushed this 
as it is so the first 3 minutes is very slightly oos.

Audio source : Littlebird big thanx

Sidenote: Gotta give a thanx to ZOMBiES
on this one too for giving us the full cam audio
to fill in the pieces before we got our hands on the LiNE
