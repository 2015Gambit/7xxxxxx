Art Tatum - 1932-1934 {The Chronological Classics}



Most of Tatumâ€™s recordings are solo, no wonder since there were few players out there who could keep up with him. The genius of all this is that Tatum wasnâ€™t all cold and mathematical: this digitized singles collection is a Depression-era party album. The number that raises the bar for every historically aware hotshot keyboardist is Tiger Rag; the purist favourites here are St. Louis Blues, Bessie Smithâ€™s After Youâ€™ve Gone and Hoagy Carmichaelâ€™s Stardust. But Tatum also ratchets up the adrenaline with ballads like Strange As It Seems, Iâ€™ll Never Be the Same, a surprisingly visceral Tea for Two, Emaline and I Would Do Anything for You among the 25 brief, barely three-minute tracks here.

Art Tatum - 1944 {The Chronological Classics

This superb segment of the Art Tatum story, begins with ten trio sides featuring guitarist Tiny Grimes and bowing, singing bassist Slam Stewart. Six  selections recorded May 1, 1944, were subsequently issued on the Comet label. Each of these performances appeared on 12\\\\\\\" 78-rpm records, allowing for well over four minutes of playing time. Weeks later -- on the summer solstice -- this inventive little group waxed four additional 12\\\\\\\" sides for an independent recording company owned and operated by Moses Asch. As if obeying some cosmic rule of thumb, Tatum returned by himself to the Asch studios on the winter solstice to record six dazzling solos of incredible substance and depth. Vintage Tatum, beautifully played and intelligently presented.

Art Tatum â€“ 1945-1947 {The Chronological Classics

This portion of the Art Tatum chronology consists entirely of piano solos. Eight sides recorded for the ARA label in May of 1945 demonstrate Tatum\\\\\\\'s amazing technique and ever-expanding repertoire. From 1945 until his early passing in 1956, the pianist would gradually expand his use of wild runs, glissandos, and arpeggios. Those tendencies are clearly audible in the recordings included on this compilation. Most of the V-Disc performances heard here are between three and a half and four minutes\\\\\\\' duration -- the \\\\\\\"Gershwin Medley\\\\\\\" runs nearly four and a half minutes. This allowed the pianist to stretch out and improvise more freely than he had been able to when operating within the confines of the three-minute record. Four Victor recordings from January 1947 conclude this fascinating chapter in the life and works of Art Tatum.

Art Tatum - 1949-1953 {The Chronological Classics

The seventh in Classics\\\\\\\' chronological survey of pianist Art Tatum\\\\\\\'s complete recorded work, this one covers the end of 1949 through 1953 and features mostly solo pieces from Tatum, who was simply the most amazing piano player in the whole history of jazz. His explosiveness, speed, and endlessly inventive arrangements make his recordings a thing apart, and this set is no exception. Try the familiar standards here like \\\\\\\"Blue Skies\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Tea for Two\\\\\\\" to hear what Tatum brings to the table. Amazing. ~ Steve Leggett

This CD contains the remaining tracks Tatum made for Capitol.
