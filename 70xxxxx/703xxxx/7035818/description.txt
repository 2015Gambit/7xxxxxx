               Zen of Screaming instructional videos by Melissa Cross



Instructional DVD by Melissa Cross, a vocal coach whose speciality is unclean vocal techniques used in extreme metal music styles among others. It helps vocalists learn how to strengthen their bodies so they can perform growled or screamed vocals.

Helped me out A LOT, helps with breathing techniques so you can hold more air and scream/sing longer and teaches you how to scream correctly, as to not harm your vocal chords (your throat will never be sore to the point of not being able to talk.  This video set is not JUST for screaming, it helps with CLEAN VOCALS also.
