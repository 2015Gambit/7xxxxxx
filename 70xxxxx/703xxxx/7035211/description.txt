Frank Edwards: Done Some Travelin'
Label: Trix
Recorded: 1972
Cd Released : 1993
Format: Mp3@320

Edwards only album was recorded for Trix in 1972, and it was a masterpiece of bemused originals, odd covers, spiritual cries, and hedonistic shouts. If you have never heard of Frank Edwards, and few have, don't miss this one. It won't make him a legend, but it might make people realize that there are still great musicians around whom they've never heard. â€” Ron Wynn
