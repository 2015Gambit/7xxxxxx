Premiering February 13, 2012, at 9 p.m. ET, SLAVERY BY ANOTHER NAME is a 90-minute documentary that challenges one of Americans\\\' most cherished assumptions: the belief that slavery in this country ended with the Emancipation Proclamation. The film tells how even as chattel slavery came to an end in 1865, thousands of African Americans were pulled back into forced labor with shocking force and brutality.
