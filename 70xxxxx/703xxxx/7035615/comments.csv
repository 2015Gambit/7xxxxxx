August Wilson's ""Joe Turner's Come and Gone"" and Earnest Gains' ""Of Love and Dust"" make some allusions to this injustice, but never have I seen its breadth and magnitude so poignantly illustrated as in this well produced documentary.

I am purchasing a copy from PBS so I cannot comment on this particular file however.

My thanks to the initial and future seeders."
