PRO REVIEWS 	----------------------------------------
\"A surprising collaboration that tackles its trickiest challenges with plausibility and good sense, while serving up a simmeringly caustic view of its controversial subject\'s behavior, public and private.\" (Todd McCarthy: The Hollywood Reporter)
----------------------------------------
\"True to Eastwood\'s understated nature, J. Edgar offers the \"tasteful\" treatment of such potentially salacious subject matter, though a more outre Oliver Stone-like approach might have made for a livelier film.\" (Peter Debruge: Variety)
----------------------------------------
\"A murky muddle of selective historical moments which comes alive when its compelling human story (...) is at the forefront. (...) when Eastwood turns his compassionate eye onto the frailties and emotions of his characters, the film flies\" (Mike Goodridge: Screendaily)
