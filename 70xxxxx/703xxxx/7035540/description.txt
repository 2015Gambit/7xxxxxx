Rosetta Stone v.3 with patch.

READ the text files...

This has been installed and run on Vista x64 and Win 7 x64 machines

It has been scanned and will MORE THAN LIKELY come up as infected.
This is due to the heuristics used in the patch program...

Otherwise it runs flawlessly.

If you get a error 1117, concerning speech recognition, 
set your firewall to allow "trusted outbound"


BTW -- Still trying to get this "torrent" thing right!
