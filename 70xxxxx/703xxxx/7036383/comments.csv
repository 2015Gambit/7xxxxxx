check the torrent description. is says clearly enough that the source is TS. also, you might want to check the name."
,cepher169,2012-02-17T02:20Z,"Now this torrent can't be a TS copy and a DVDRip, so which is it???"
,opensociety,2012-02-17T16:05Z,"Flyboy!

YOU are not uploading anything, the heading clearly states TS.

,MonstaUK,2012-03-10T05:31Z,Whats TS?
,zickboi,2012-03-10T15:33Z,"TS = ""Telesync means a copy which was shot in a cinema like a cam (often with a professional camera from the projection booth), and directly connected to the sound source (often FM audio provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theatre). The audio is potentially better, having none of a cam's usual audience noise. Also if the telesync is shot from within the projection booth, there will be no distortion like there may be on a cam version.""

you could have just Googled it, that's what i did."
,gazza2009,2012-03-11T22:37Z,thx zickboi i wasnt sure what ts was either just knew its better than cam and not a dvd
