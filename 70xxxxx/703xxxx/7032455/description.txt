- ARTISTS
Huey Lewis and the News is an American rock band based in San Francisco, California. They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually scoring a total of 19 top-ten singles across the Billboard charts. Their greatest success was in the 1980s with the number-one album,  Sports, coupled with a series of highly successful MTV videos. Their worldwide fame expanded when the song The Power Of Love was featured as a key track in the film Back To The Future,  became a number-one hit, and nominated for an Academy Award. The News combined a rock (and sometimes, a "blues-rock") backing with soul and doo-wop-influenced harmony vocals and Lewis' voice.
