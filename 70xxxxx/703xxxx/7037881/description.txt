Coheed and Cambria is an American progressive rock band from 
Nyack, New York. Formed in 1995, the group incorporates aspects 
of progressive rock, punk rock, metal and post-hardcore. All of 
Coheed and Cambria's albums are concept albums that tell a science 
fiction storyline called The Amory Wars, a story written by lead 
singer Claudio Sanchez, which has been transcribed into a series of
comic books, as well as a full length novel. The band has released 
five studio albums, three live albums, and several special-edition 
releases.
