,Hockeyboy946,2012-02-29T23:34Z,"naveedlakho: A widget is basically a program that runs off your main screen. For example I use a Youtube widget and it allows me to see most recently uploaded videos in my subscription box and a quick link to the Youtube app. A weather widget will show the current weather, 7-day forcast (mine does at least), and if I tap on it it will open that weather app. Those are a couple of examples if you still don't completely understand it just do a quick Google search."
