    The end of the 80s, a village in the middle of Finland. 15-year-old      
    Hevari, the only long-haired boy in town, is the coolest guy in the      
    world - at least according to Kake from next door. No-one else seems     
    to agree. Short-tempered Hevari is used to being the laughing stock      
    among the gang and the girls. But when the Friday night comes and        
    there's a disco at the community hall, it's time to go again. Maybe      
    tonight everything will be different.
