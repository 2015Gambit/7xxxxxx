22 1 "Rampage" Rick Morales Rob Hoegee February 4, 2011 693-022 

While Providence HQ is being rebuilt since Payback, Rex and Bobo are living with (and annoying) Noah, while Six is a "ninja-hobo" in his jump jet. Rex gets a call that Providence is trying to transport a power core, when an E.V.O. goes on the loose, and conveniently, is near the power core. Rex later finds 
out that Van Kleiss used him as a decoy to detract attention from the power core. After a battle between Rex and Van Kleiss, the latter turns Noah into an E.V.O. (a giant blond E.V.O. dog), forcing Rex to try and cure him before Providence hurts his friend while chasing all over the city and into a sewer. 
Dr. Holiday did research on a sample she took from the earlier E.V.O and reveals that the E.V.O.s created by Van Kleiss may become permanent, if not cured within a certain amount of time (she assumes, at this point, that the time period is different for each E.V.O.). Rex's biometrics drops, causing him to take a breather before curing Noah. Van Kleiss scares Noah away before Rex can cure him. After a chase in a labyrinth of train tracks, Rex's biometrics spike back up, and a new build of his allows him to defeat Van Kleiss, with a little help from Noah. After Rex finally cures his friend, it is revealed that turning Noah into an E.V.O. was actually a distraction as pulling out Rex, Six, and Bobo crippled the defenses of the power core, allowing Breach to steal it and recover Van Kleiss. Back at HQ, Rex is training, trying to create more builds (including a Water-Jet), after deciding that he wants to stay back "home" in Providence, with Six and Holiday feeling the same way. 
 
23 2 "Waste Land" Chris Graham Tad Stones February 11, 2011 693-023 

Following an E.V.O. attack on a research ship, Rex and Six are called upon to retrieve the reactor core's rods of the ship. If not rescued, the rods would destroy the surrounding areas. During their underwater mission in the middle of the Pacific, both of them are attacked by E.V.O. fish, and discover a hidden underwater city carved out of the waste lands, an island twice the size of Texas made out of trash, called Aquania. It is a city of hundreds of E.V.O. fish species and is led by an E.V.O. named Surge (short for Sergio). Rex and Six find out that the research ship is in a sea trench, where the pressure will cause the reactor cores to explode and destroy Aquania. However, before they can inspect it, the lines holding the ship suddenly snap, sinking the ship down into the trench. Rex dives deep into the trench to retrieve the core and save Aquania and 
all its inhabitants. As he enters the ship, Rex finds the core reactors, but before he can grab them, his air supply runs out (his oxygen mask was damaged as he tried to enter the ship). Luckily, Surge rescues him and retrieves the core reactors. As they're about to leave, Six promises Surge that he nor Rex will reveal Aquania's existence and deletes all the pictures he had taken of Aquania. Rex brings with them a baby E.V.O. crab, as a "souvenir" for Holiday.  

24 3 "Lost Weekend" Seung-Hyun Oh Scott Sonneborn February 18, 2011 693-024 

While fighting an E.V.O., Rex and Bobo hear of a party in the middle of a desert. Later, White Knight assigns them a mission at an underground event in the Sonoran Desert, with entertainment being provided by E.V.O.s. With civilians present, White Knight sends Rex, Bobo, and Kenwyn Jones, who has just graduated from Providence Academy as a lieutenant, undercover to observe the situation. Rex is annoyed by Kenwyn's by-the-book methods, while she dislikes his improvisational approach. During the party, Rex and Kenwyn run into Skwydd, who informs Rex of threats towards the performers. Later, Skwydd starts uncontrollably generating pure solid ink, entrapping both Rex and Kenwyn, then passes out. To keep the panicking partygoers from fleeing, Rex entertains them with his machine builds. Rex seeks leads from Thumb, a ball-shaped, three-headed, four-legged E.V.O., but both are shocked unconscious by Mouse, a humanoid-mouse-like E.V.O. Kenwyn evades the attack and knocks Mouse down. In the process, they find out that Mouse is not an E.V.O., but an older human woman. Mouse reveals that she despises the thought of humans and E.V.O.s working together, so she and her partner - ironically an anti-human E.V.O. - have been amplifying other E.V.O.s' capabilities to show how dangerous E.V.O.s can be. Her 
power-manipulating E.V.O. partner attempts to destroy the cave and kill everyone in attendance. Just as he's about to blow himself up, Skwydd uses his solid ink to encapsulate the E.V.O., protecting everyone from the blast. Back at Providence, Kenwyn reports to White Knight that the situation was brought under control by Rex, who did everything by the rules. White Knight assures them that he will team them up again, with Rex, Kenwyn and Bobo endorsing the idea.  

25 4 "Alliance" Chris Graham Paul Giacoppo March 4, 2011 693-025 

Rex is sent on a mission to fix the Bug Jar shield. Van Kleiss comes to recruit the vengeful E.V.O, No-Face in the Bug Jar. When Rex finds out that the Pack is there along with Circe, he follows them wearing a stealth suit. He is discovered by Biowulf and Rex is saying how Biowulf is now becoming a henchman (as opposed to his previously right-hand man... wolf). Rex is knocked out by Circe after they have an argument. Rex is now taken into a stadium where he has to fight No-Face, very much to Circe's shock and horror. While fighting No-Face, Van Kleiss is saying, to a very shocked and horrified Circe, how they need Rex alive, but do not need him to have his brain working, although this angers No-Face who commands the E.V.O.s to attack the Pack. When Rex escapes and goes to the control shield room to find Bobo still holding on a lever (cause Rex said if he let go the machine would "go boom"), which he didn't need to anymore. The shield goes down and they both leave the room in the sewer and find Circe waiting for them and help them round up the E.V.O.s.When Circe, who finally sees Van Kleiss for what he truly is, uses her ultrasonic sound abilities to summon and lure all the E.V.O.s with her hypnotic siren-like melody. She soon becomes tired and has to rest for a bit while the spellbound E.V.O.s come toward them. When it seemed that they could not keep on going Biowulf comes and saves them and orders Rex to fix the shield generator. Rex fixes it and only has a minute to get out of reach of the shield. He transforms into his Rex Ride and tells Bobo to get on board with Circe, and asked if Biowulf was coming which he rejects with saying they tell no one he helped them. They barely made it out with the back of the bike broken off barely missing Bobo. Rex tells Circe that now she can make her own choices now that she doesn't need Van Kleiss any more. Bobo gives her a Providence bike to use, and Rex tells her that "Hong Kong is nice this time of year" (reference to Rabble). She still neglects to join Providence and goes off on her own, while Rex drives back to base, Bobo rubs it in that he still didn't get a date with Circe.  

26 5 "Robo Bobo " Seung-Hyun Oh Man of Action March 11, 2011 693-026 

After stopping another Rabbit E.V.O., Rex begins to suspect something is wrong with Bobo when he begins acting nice and even helping out around Providence. But when Rex tries to convince Six and Holiday, both tell him that he shouldn't worry, and Holiday even explains that Bobo had a troubled past involving a children's hospital and a man in a purple suit. Rex takes things into his own hands and throws a party, but when Bobo declines (and even escorts a showgirl called in by Rex), Rex attacks Bobo, knocking his head off in the process and discovering that "Bobo" is really a robot. The robot reveals a screen in its rear, displaying the real Bobo who explains to Rex that he needed some "Bobo Time", and then requests that Rex not do anything to draw further suspicion on him or the robot. Rex however decides that the robot Bobo needs to be more like the real Bobo and uses his powers to change him. The noted aspect of Rex's changes is his saying 'good is bad, and bad is good', which the Robot Bobo begins to take quite literally. While studying the pink rabbit E.V.O. from earlier in the petting zoo, Holiday discovers it is pregnant and about to have babies. Unfortunately the mother rabbit spawns a lot of offspring, which begin to wreak havoc in the petting zoo. Rex, Holiday, and Six race to capture them but Robot Bobo, remembering Rex's saying, goes wild and attempts to release the native E.V.O.s, proclaiming it the "ultimate prank". The real Bobo shows up in time before the E.V.O.s can escape and attacks Robo Bobo.Six and Holiday succeed in capturing the bunnies, while Rex battles the mother bunny which is acting very defensive around him. Six and Holiday get it to calm down and Bobo finishes off his robot double. When questioned by Six, Bobo quickly create an alibi about being kidnapped and replaced by the robot by the same man in a purple suit, and Six appears to buy it. Later on in Rex's room, Rex attempts to find out more about Bobo's past, who spins a similar tale like the one Holiday told him, about 
the man in the suit and the hospital, and claims that he was visiting his family. But Rex is doubtful and begins to chase Bobo as the episode ends. 
 
27 6 "Divided By Six" Rick Morales David Slack March 18, 2011 693-027 

On his way home from fun and with a burger, Rex is ambushed by four humans, who are the 2nd-5th most dangerous men and women in the world. Six is revealed to actually be the sixth most dangerous mercenary, with Five, IV (Roman Numeral Four), Trey (a play on Trois, the French word for Three), and Dos (the Spanish word for Two) outranking him. They then reveal that they need Rex's help to heal their teacher - One. One turned E.V.O. five years ago, but had managed to remain somewhat aware through meditation and sheer willpower. On the deserted island where One resides, they enter a special containment vessel held over an active volcano, which is a fail-safe set to drop if One ever fails to enter a numerical password every forty one minutes. However, when it appears that One is too far gone and has become uncurable, Dos and the others decide to destroy him against Six's wishes. Rex tries to escape with One, but are cornered by the Four most dangerous. Rex attempts to fight back, but is nearly overwhelmed until Six arrives and helps out. Together, Six and Rex defeat the other mercenaries (with help from a new build). Afterward, Rex tries to heal One again, but is suddenly overcome with pain. When Six tries to stop Rex, fearing for his safety over his Master's, it turns out One has temporarily possessed Rex's mind and body, using him to speak to Six one last time. One expresses his admiration for Six choosing to help the world fight the E.V.O. threat, and then dies peacefully, his body dissolving and covering the island in lush green growth as a sign of his truly becoming "one with everything". After being picked up by Providence, Six explains that he once wanted nothing more than to be the new One, but gave up on 
that goal when he found Rex. Deciding he owes Rex a new hamburger, the two set out to get some food as they depart.  

28 7 "Mixed Signals" Chris Graham Alexx Van Dyne March 25, 2011 693-028 

While battling a starfish like E.V.O., Rex begins to have trance-like moments during the fight, with strange machines building from his body each time. Eventually he is dismissed from the fight on Six's orders, returning to one of the Providence outposts for a check up by Holiday. Deciding to let the trances go through, Rex builds a strange device that ensnares him, Holiday, and Bobo. Outside the outpost, a strange figure in a power suit appears and takes out the Providence soldiers with a strange frequency device and smoke grenades. The stranger releases Rex, and then removes his helmet, revealing himself to be CÃ©sar, Rex's long lost older brother. Rex agrees to leave with CÃ©sar, taking off in a mobile laboratory that takes them to the Artic in mere seconds.There, CÃ©sar explains that during the Event five years ago, his pod lab's transportation system malfunctioned due to the force of explosion and caused him to leap forward five years into the future (though he claims in his time, it was fifteen minutes). However, both of their parents, Rafael and Violeta, were sadly killed in the explosion, very much to Rex's grief and sorrow. They then flee to Abysus after Providence tries to intercept them, where they are attacked by Van Kleiss and his E.V.O. followers. However, Six arrives in the Keep and they manage to escape, while Van Kleiss shows great concern at CÃ©sar's return. Back in the city with the Starfish E.V.O., Providence is having trouble containing the creature which has splintered into multiple, smaller copies (it was accidentally split in half by Rex during his earlier trances). However, CÃ©sar injects the creature with a serum and causes it to reassemble into its complete form, which is then subdued by Providence. Back at Providence HQ, White Knight informs Six and Holiday that he wants CÃ©sar to remain, as his knowledge may prove useful. As CÃ©sar settles in, Rex confirms to Bobo and the others that while he is relieved to have found family again, he is still glad to have the others with him as well. 
 
29 8 "Outpost" Seung-Hyun Oh James Felder April 1, 2011 693-029 

White Knight is alerted and assumes that the Green Fist organization are selling E.V.O.s to Van Kleiss, dispatching Rex and Bobo (who convinced White Knight to let him come along although Rex was intentionally meant as a "solo" run) to South America. Upon getting there Rex can immediately tell that the locals don't like them very much, he meets the head of the locale chapter of Providence named Agent Oso Martillo. Oso shows Rex around the base and introduces him to the E.V.O.s kept in the Kennel. Oso states that the smaller E.V.O.s are harmless and actually quite friendly, he'd let them go if it weren't bad for diplomatics, 
the larger ones on the other hand, taking one that resembles a sabertooth cat as a example, are incredibly dangerous and are shipped to the Petting Zoo to be contained. After saving Oso from one the attacking E.V.O., he had just described he offers to buy Rex and Bobo a drink at the locale bar. When Rex discovers the nasty truth about the milk he spits out out on the local woman triggering a bar fight and resulting in Rex, Bobo, and Martillo getting thrown out. That night Rex sets up a trap for the Green Fist, using Bobo as bait they plan to lure them into the Kennel and capture them. They succeed but the E.V.O.s are turned loose in the process. Rex discovers that Valentina (who Rex accidentally spit milk on earlier) is the leader of the Green Fist, worst yet the E.V.O. Rex saved Oso from earlier is loose and infects two members of the Green Fist and Rex with a powerful poison.During interrogation, the Green Fist explains that they aren't working for anyone and are giving E.V.O.s freedom. Rex then talks to Dr. Holiday and learns that his nanites are slowing the effect of the E.V.O.s toxin, but it will eventually kill him and the other infected people. Dr. Holiday can synthesize an antidote if Rex can collect a sample of the E.V.O.'s DNA. alentina offers her services in capturing the E.V.O. she set free, since it's poison is also killing her men. Rex, Bobo and Valentina goes solo into the jungle to capture the E.V.O. after a long chase Rex lures the E.V.O. over a net trap and Valentina triggers it thus capturing the E.V.O. after Rex gets a DNA sample he attempts to cure the E.V.O. only to discover it's not a E.V.O. at all. Valentina suddenly realizes that it is the legendary El Chupacabra. Realizing this, Rex cuts it loose since it has been a part of the natural order longer then man, and lets Valentina "get away".

cured of the Chupacabra's poison and are also set free. The next morning, Rex and Bobo leave South America and head home.

The group realizes that there is a ghost E.V.O. in the hotel and decides to use the magnet that CÃ©sar made to pull the E.V.O. together.

(with the right head being Gabriel and the and the left head being Michael). At the school, Rex is actually enjoying being around other kids who virtually worship Rex and Noah since they are on the Ping Pong team which they take way too seriously. Noah lies about Rex being a foreign exchange student from a school run by "Principal Haha".Rex does surprisingly well on a Trigonometry Pop Quiz given by Mr. Buchiner which has a reputation to give even the Principal nightmares. During the tournament, the Twins father and Coach pushes them way too far, going so far as to use the same technology Mouse used in "Lost Weekend" on the twins causing them to grow four extra arms and go on a rampage. Rex deciding the well being of the audience and twins takes precedence over the tournament goes to fight and calm down the twins. During the fight, Rex and the twins smash into Mr. Buchiner's classroom, where he helps Rex by pointing out he can use the floorboards as a catapult, 
launching the twins back to the stadium. When Rex leaves Mr. Buchiner goes back to grading papers and talking about wanting a pony. Using their father as a distraction Rex is able to short out the amplifying patches returning the twins to their previously mutated state, unfortunately Rex informs the Twins that they're incurable.Rex chews out the coach for his reckless endangerment of his sons and both boys informs their father that they don't even like Ping Pong and would rather take piano lessons instead. With that the Coach decides to get them a piano teacher, enter them into a piano tournament, and make the lot of them proud. The principal however informs Rex for the destruction that Rex caused he's expelled. At Providence, Rex informs Dr. Holiday that he actually enjoyed his one week at school, which Dr. Holiday decides is a good thing since she believes she has been lenient in her tutoring of Rex making him also take History, Spanish, Trigonometry, and Science from her as well.

It is soon discovered that the hieroglyphics and valley are part of a system used by ZAG-RS in another plot to eliminate nanites. Van Kleiss stated that ZAG-RS was originally built as a Nanite Decontamination Unit to eliminate stray nanites by CÃ©sar. Van Kleiss states to Rex that the Omega-One Nanite in him can replicate his own nanites exponentially. As ZAG-RS transforms 
her programming into a giant robot, Rex ends up fighting ZAG-RS while Van Kleiss weakens ZAG-RS as the sandstorm dies down. Later on, CÃ©sar admits that ZAG-RS was his creation as they interrogate ZAG-RS. CÃ©sar reboots ZAG-RS, but Dr. Holiday notices that its memory has been wiped clean. CÃ©sar states that Van Kleiss must have initiated a program dump when he weakened ZAG-RS, while Rex wonders if what Van Kleiss said about his older brother was true.
