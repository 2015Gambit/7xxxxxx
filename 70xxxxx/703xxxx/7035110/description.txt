Workdone:
We first converted the VOB to avi. After doing so the AR was wrong so we had to fix that first. The CAM was pretty nice but it had motion issues. We tried a few filters but no luck. The CAM also had HC yellow sub on the bottom, so we cropped them off. We also adjusted the levels, saturation, and lightly ran a smoother. Turn out pretty nice for a CAM besides the motion issue.

Audio:
For the audio it was better then average, We put it threw a denoiser and did some audio enhancement
