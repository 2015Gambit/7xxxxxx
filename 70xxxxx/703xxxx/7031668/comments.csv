[T],immagical,2012-02-21T16:48Z,"@hydro53..   The subtitles probably are diferent than the word because this movie is english ""dubbed"" where as the subtitles are the english word of the original play..  I think the dubbed words are cut and shortened to make the audio fit the movie otherwise wee end up with the old bruce lee film audio where the words come 1 minute later than the mouths moving!! lol :)"

If I don't comment again then the quality is good. "
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-05-05T20:10Z,"Why dubbed? 

What hapenned with the real cinema ?

Everybody has forgotten  to read  a good subtitle ?

Or is something else in the middle ?

The internet is the land of all possibilities but ...not like this. Tomorrow we'll become some vegetables fed by spoons ...  with  instant -meal even for the minds and for the souls.

Horrible thought and close to a dystopic perspective...


Nothing with  the uploader but ...maybe...next ...time...something real...


Good rip..Good movie..shame it's dubbed...


Cheers
