French ambient pop outfit Air are set to release an album on February 7 through Astralwerks, their first since 2009's Love 2. Titled Le Voyage Dans La Lune after Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s' 1902 silent short French film by the same name, it's an expansion of a project they worked on earlier this year. (The duo provided music for an updated version of MÃ©liÃ¨s' film for its debut at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.)
The record features lyrics and vocals from Beach House's Victoria Legrand on a song called "Seven Stars" and lyrics written by Au Revoir Simone on the track "Who Am I Know? The release will include a limited-edition version of the short film and Air's original score.
