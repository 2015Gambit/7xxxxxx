The Secret of Chateau de Moreau v2.1.4
Requirements: Android 2.0+
Overview: Most people will make the natural association between The Secret Chateau de Moreau and the Phoenix Wright series, with its hunt for evidence and questioning scenarios. But in all honesty, the game is far more similar to the Professor Layton franchise, as well as a much lesser known Nintendo DS title called Hotel Dusk: Room 215. The presentation and style of the game, the pencil drawn look for the characters and the much slower pace, feel very inspired by this hidden gem â€“ and believe me, thatâ€™s a good thing.
