POtHS Comments on This one:    
This is an excellent presentation.

Description:
   
Christianity, the first 1000 years:

A complete history of the Christian church for the first 1000 yrs. With a thorough prospective of the Roman Empire, and the Papacy, Rome never died. And the Papacy is not the True Church of God. Know your enemy. It\'s your individual Salvation, that is at stake.

It is an epic beyond anything Hollywood could imagine, embracing emperors and itinerant preachers, the teachings of a man accepted by millions as the Savior and the battles fought in His name.

From the Crucifixion to the coming of the Crusades, Rise of Christianity: The First 1000 Years traces the evolution of one of the world\'s great religions. Scholars explore the intertwined fates of the Roman Empire and the faith it first persecuted, then adopted. Theologians reveal how the New Testament was shaped, and how pagan festivals were transformed into Christian holidays. And examine modern discoveries that shed new light on the dawn of Christianity.

Drawing on ancient texts, the Scriptures and visits to sites like Istanbul\'s magnificent Hagia Sophia, this is a spellbinding journey through The Rise of Christianity: The First 1000 Years.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn\'t PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

\"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

\"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.

Ephesians 5:11

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
