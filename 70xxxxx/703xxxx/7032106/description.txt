IMDB.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087928/

Police Academy- This is the best of the series and had me laughing all the way through. Tackleberry made me laugh like crazy. "DROP THE STERIO, OR I'LL BLOW YOUR DAMN NUTS OFF." This is a good deal in this box set, and is still a believable movie. 10/10 Rated R for language, adult humor, and nudity.

SUBS.............: English | French | Spanish | Romanian
IMDB.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089822/

Police Academy 2: Their First Assinment- This is almost as funny as the first and had most of the characters from the first one. I wonder why George Martini wasn't in anymore of the Police Academy films. "You have the right to sing the blues". 9/10 Rated PG-13 for language, adult humor, mild violence and brief nudity.

SUBS.............: English | French | Spanish | Romanian
IMDB.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091777/

Police Academy 3: Back In Training- This is a great, funny and strong entry in the series. Zed and Sweetchuck are a team in this (but Sweetchuck hates Zed.) The only part I didn't like was the boring boat chase at the end. "People used to say I was a real jerk, but now I'm a people guy." This was a funny movie. 9/10 Rated PG for mild language, violence, and some crude humor.

SUBS.............: English | French | Spanish | Romanian
IMDB.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093756/

Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol- This is a funny movie. In this one, Harris returns and Proctor is his partner. Althou this filmisn't the best in the series, it is still funny. Why wasn't Fackler in this one. "Gene, Gene made a machine, Joe Joe made it go, Art Art blew a fart and blew the damn thing apart". Get ready to laugh. 8/10
Rated PG for language, crude humor, and some mild violence.

[b]Police.Academy.5.Assignment.Miami.Beach.1988.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-eXceSs[/b]

SUBS.............: English | French | Spanish | Romanian
IMDB.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095882/

Police Academy 5: Assinment Miami Beach- This is another strong entry in the series and is a bit better than number 4. Harris and Procter steal the show in this one big time. Too bad Steve Guttenberg didn't make any more. "Now I have to kill you, nothing personal". 8/10
Rated PG for mild language, humor, and some violence.

[b]Police.Academy.6.City.Under.Siege.1989.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-eXceSs[/b]

SUBS.............: English | French | Spanish | Romanian
IMDB.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098105/

Police Academy 6: City Under Seige- This is the second best in the series. Fackler returns, but House is gone. This has a cool car chase at the end of the film. It's cool when Jones does Terminator. "Target, HUMAN". So get ready to laugh in this slapstick. 10/10
Rated PG for crude humor, language, and violence.

[b]Police.Academy.7.Mission.to.Moscow.1994.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-eXceSs[/b]

SUBS.............: English | French | Spanish | Romanian
IMDB.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110857/

Police Academy 7: Mission To Moscow- This is an ok movie but is a bit too slow and not funny. I guess it's not a terrible movie and is good for a chuckle on a boring Sunday afternoon. "We're in deep borse." 4/10
Rated PG for mild sensuality.
