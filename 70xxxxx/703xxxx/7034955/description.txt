Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, February 14 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with activist and talk radio host Adam Kokesh. He was a Corporal in the Marine Corps Reserve and is a veteran of the Iraq War. Kokesh is known for his participation in a silent dance at the Thomas Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. in protest of a recent ruling against dancing at federal monuments. 

Alex also talks with former Wall Street stock broker and broadcaster and film-maker Max Keiser about the state of the global economy and other related topics.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
