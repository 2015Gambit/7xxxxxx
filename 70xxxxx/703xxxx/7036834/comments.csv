,monshoz,2012-02-16T21:36Z,"When I set  the language to english and launch the game, it switches to russian. Help?"
,monshoz,2012-02-16T21:37Z,"Nevermind, I got it. Just have to run as administrator."
,baronxs,2012-02-16T23:04Z,"Fantastic! Works great Windows 7 64 bit, GTX550Ti, i7-2600, 8gb, maxed out graphics"

,kerebero,2012-02-17T00:17Z,Just install and run the launcher located in the directory as administrator then select the language you want and start the game.......
,deepfox,2012-02-17T04:24Z,How come this version is 2GB less than SKIDROW's?
,Rex0n,2012-02-17T10:42Z,"I get a bunch of .dll error when im trying to install the game, anyone have the same problem?"

,Pessa666,2012-02-18T04:59Z,so should i get this one or the 7gb other one?
,requiescatenpace,2012-02-18T05:48Z,"For people having trouble with language, once the game is intalled, there should be a file called skidrow, open that up and change the part where it says russian to english. Worked for me. Did the install in russian though"
,PoppaChubbie,2012-02-18T11:38Z,"This installs and runs perfectly on Win7 x64; install puts 2 icons on desktop: 1st one is launcher, run that & select English. Afterwards u can delete that icon and just run the game using the 2nd icon. As far as the game goes I agree with the guy who said it should be called Alan Sleep cos it's boring crap. Thanks for this one uploader and fellow seeders, I got to check it out and now I know not to waste money buying it; much appreciated. From now on I only dl shooters which give u a weapon at the start; no stupid running and dodging enemies for an hour .. so lame."

Hate stupid games that don't give u a weapon straight away & u have to run from and dodge enemies for an hour; this one u can't even jump over small fences to get clear .. so lame. Anyway, others might like this but for me it's going in the bitbucket. Thanks for this one uploader and fellow seeders, now I know not to waste money buying it; much appreciated."

By the way thanks for uploading clean and flawless game HeroMaster you really deserve a big hug from everyone of us who are happily playing this game. Thanks to you and to people who developed this game...real awesome and sure will buy a legit copy of this.

,Makobigsauce,2012-03-19T18:38Z,"would someone please tell me if the game AND the DLCs are in this torrent, or just the DLCs. I have played this game and clocked it (amazing game) so i dont want to clock it again, i just want to play the DLCs, so if they are both here can someone tell me how to install just the DLC?"
,majorpwnd,2012-04-04T04:24Z,how do u change that wierd ass language
,Arbiter89,2012-04-30T22:56Z,"@Makobigsauce It's the game PLUS the DLC.
@majorpwnd That ""weird ass language"" is Russian. More people on the planet speak Russian than English."
,{me},2012-05-07T05:13Z,"@Arbiter89 please don't just say things without any evidence or research. This leads to the rampant spread of ignorance. In reality, English is far more prolific than Russian. I am certainly not trying to bash Russian but your comment is horrendously incorrect.

Thanks Hero

Happy Pirating"
,0rochimaru,2012-05-09T11:18Z,"@Arbiter89

Cyrillic is indeed very""weird ass"" writing script (compared to the Roman letters we use) and Russian is a FIFTH (5th) most spoken language, and almost exclusive to its country of origin.

1. Mandarin (1.1bil)
2. ENGLISH (1bil)
3. Spanish (500mil)
4. Hindi (490mil)
5. RUSSIAN (277mil)
6. Arabic (255mil)
7. Portuguese (240mil)...

(http://www.krysstal.com/spoken.html)

So, please, tuck your ill-informed retard back in  ^_-"
,Citzen92,2012-07-25T23:05Z,"@{me} English is more popular, but Russian is even more spoken. Get the facts you asshead"
