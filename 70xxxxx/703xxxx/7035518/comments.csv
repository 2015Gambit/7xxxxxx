Compared the first 2min of BLOW's to CHD's and haven't noted a lick of difference. Maybe further in the movie but they didn't specify where.

CHD's rip does have a higher bit rate and is about 1gb more but not as well seeded. Everything else is nearly identical. Going to watch CHD's now, I'll report back if it's bad."
