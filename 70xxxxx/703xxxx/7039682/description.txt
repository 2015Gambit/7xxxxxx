Here is an old version of my browser that never got released. It was built on the 11/12/09. Just ealier that year i started learning how to do software building and programming. This was the 4th version that i built. You will see the browser is quite simple and the colour and look was not great but hay, i was learning and it works. You will see i have come a long way building my web browsers and now im upto the version 3.5 (working on 3.6 and the momment). My browsers are getting much more advanced now and is the one of the most powerful homemade browsers you will find on the internet!

Benz Web Browser 1.4 is very simple, safe and fast to use.

Space required: 4.28Mb

Designed for Windows Vista. Should work with windows 7 and some XP systems.

Download and have try, see what you think to my 4th version built in 2009.
