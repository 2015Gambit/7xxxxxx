 Mississippi Records is venue/record label in the mean streets of North Portland, Oregon, and unbeknown to me purveyors of absolutely brilliant mix-tapes stuffed to the scaly gills with unknown finds from across the great, starry expanse of musical history.  - 

Great set of Mixtapes of hard to find, rare to earth, deep cut tracks.  Very Very hard to find and only mix and matched on blogs so far.  This was the best I could do.  

Always on the look out for more.
