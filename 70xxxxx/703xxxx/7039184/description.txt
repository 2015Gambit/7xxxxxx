The lavishly produced and stylish crime thriller Boca - directed by Brazilian filmmaker Flavio Frederico and based on the autobiography of Hiroito, 'The King of Boca do Lixo' - makes for enjoyable viewing. Set amidst the brothels and nightclubs of 1950's SÃ£o Paulo, Hiroito (Daniel de Oliveira) rises to become one the region's most notorious crime lords, trading in women, drugs and guns. After the death of his father - a crime Hiroito was arrested for but never charged - the self-styled kingpin begins to establish his empire, but soon comes unstuck to drugs and women.

There is a clearly a strong level of brutal honesty by the real Hiroito in what he reveals in his autobiography, and consequently Frederico's film. Boca follows the traditional pattern of crime films, in that those who do wrong must have their comeuppance - shown most expertly in Coppola's Godfather Trilogy. This generic formula is handled well throughout, with the opening scenes showing the lead character at the time of his fall from power.
