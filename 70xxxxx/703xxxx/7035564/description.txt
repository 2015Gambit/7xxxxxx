A smaller version of the HD video found here:

2001:  A Space Odyssey sync\'d to Pink Floyd\'s Wish You Were Here, including the Echoes sync to \"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.\"


I have seen a lot of Floyd syncs, especially with Kubrick\'s 2001:  A Space Odyssey, but I\'ve never seen it with Wish You Were Here.  I think this is hands down the best out there.  Just discovered it one night with a friend of mine, and it is spectacular.

Although the tone of the songs on the album seem to match the mood of the movie throughout, there are a bunch of instances that really exhibit the sync.  Here is a list of many of them:


Shine On You Crazy Diamond I - V

Multiple scene transitions sync with music.
Song slowly fades in as the sun rises over the moon and Earth.
Movie title syncs to synthesizer.
Gilmour\'s guitar emphasizes landscape shots.
Guitar riffs as the leopard jumps down and attacks the monkey.
Monkey\'s eyes match the high hat right before the lyrics begin.
\"Remember when you were young.\"  When man had not evolved.
\"You shone like the sun.\"  Scene transition to daylight.
\"You reached for the secret too soon.\"  Monkeys reach out and touch the monolith.
\"You cried for the moon.\"  Monolith is aligned with the moon above.
Many more lyrical syncs.


Welcome to the Machine

Transition from SOYCD, dark hum as monkey realizes knowledge of tool use.
Mechanical \"thump\" as the monkey crunches the pig skull with the bone.
\"Welcome to the machine.\"  Eating meat now, using tools; becoming human.  \"Dawn of Man\".
Bone is thrown into the air to the synth whistle.
Transition to space age:
\"Welcome to the machine.\"  Space station appears to reverb sound effect.
\"Dreamed of a big star.\"  Space travel.
End of song:
Thump 1 - Space station enters from upper right.
Synth hums while station floats through frame.
Thump 2 - Shuttle appears in lower right.
People laugh while riding the shuttle.


Have a Cigar

Kick ass transition to landing bay.
Right as guitar starts, the shuttle appears from the bottom right of the bay.
\"Come in here dear boy...\"  Shuttle is flying into space station.
\"You\'re gonna go far.  You\'re gonna fly high.\" 

Oh by the way, which one\'s pink?*  Sick.

\"Everybody else is just green.\"  Woman on the screen is dressed in green.



Wish You Were Here

Song begins when Dr. Heywood R FLOYD gets of the phone with his daughter.
Great song, not much of a sync except as time filler.


Shine On You Crazy Diamond VI - IX

Transition - Guitar riff syncs to woman walking around and upside-down in hallway.
Again, music mood syncs with space-scapes and shuttle travel.
As shuttle lowers into dock, music goes down the scale with it.
\"And I\'ll be joining you there.\"  As shuttle lands.
\"Come on you miner for truth and delusion.\"  Monolith was dug up on the moon.
Funky organ and guitar fill time during meeting.
Spacey synth follows shuttle flight.
Song ends as shuttle flies away.


Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite & Echoes

No explanation needed.  If you don\'t know already...enjoy.


I am constantly amazed every time I watch this sync, and I have a little pride knowing that one night we put this together without any previous knowledge of it.  I haven\'t seen this anywhere else, which really surprises me since it seems to sync up perfectly.  You can restart the cd to sync with the rest of the movie, but the effect is lost due to the large amount of dialogue. 

Please feel free to comment on the video.  I am interested in what other people think of this because, except for a close group of my friends and family, I haven\'t met anyone who has ever seen this.  It\'s just my opinion, but I\'ll take this over The Wizard of Oz/DSTOM sync any day.
