Stars Mr. David Suchet in Dame Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express"
also with Ms. Barbara Hershey

This is a great exposÃ©e of Multicultural defects when we find that being a "Klutz"
at the art of cultural finesse can actually cause the loss of life of a good man
(to his own comrade's view that is) in a situation where someone does not know
the degree to which impugning a man's sense of honour can be "just too much of
an attack in style and rhetoric" to be seen as bearable - to the extent of 
bringing on suicide - would you believe! David Suchet does not seem "westerly"
literate as scripted at the very start of the program I have to say! A British
soldier is thereby lost in what is a death intended to restore Regimental and 
familial honour perhaps.
