,yy4u2rel82,2012-07-11T08:49Z,"you are a piece of fucking shit, polisdavid.  nice trojan there.  grabbed my ftp and fucked up all my websites.  luckily hostgator fixed all your shit with a scan but i did have to manually fix all the htaccess files.  

to anyone else.. don't run patch.exe.  It will patch the program, but it will steal all kinds of pw shit on your computer.  

No wonder you're commenting on your own thread so much and trying to get people interested when nobody else has said a damn thing.  hope you fucking die.  "
