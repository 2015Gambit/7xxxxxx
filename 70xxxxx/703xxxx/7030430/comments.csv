,rekabis,2012-03-03T08:21Z,"Since the OP doesn’t seem to be interested in seeding this, I will do my best to take up the slack.

Since I did not download this originally, I am adding videos slowly directly from the source. I have already gotten the “Introduction” chapter done, and hope to have the others done in a few days to a week or so. Please be patient."
,rekabis,2012-03-03T09:25Z,"Whelp, did the first five chapters tonight; 44.7% of the torrent available for you to leech. You’re welcome."
,nigwoko,2012-03-05T18:57Z,Thanks rekabis! Keep 'em coming.
,rekabis,2012-03-07T08:14Z,"Finished the last five last night.

I also noticed that the original torrent is missing the introduction video for the last chapter. If the consensus is there, I can always re-roll this torrent to include it, and re-post it.

It is only an intro, however, and doesn’t really include critical information, so a second torrent with these same videos might just negatively increase the signal-to-noise for this category of torrent.

If enough people ask over the next few weeks, I’ll consider re-rolling the torrent."
