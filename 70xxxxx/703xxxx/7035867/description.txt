        Marielle Delauney and her adoring husband Charles are enjoying
        the romance of Paris, 1929, until a tragic accident claims the
        life  of their  young son.  Their marriage  can't survive  the
        misery,  and  Marielle,  plagued  by  guilt  and  despair,  is
        hospitalised. Eighteen  months later,  she moves  back to  New
        York to start  her life over  and to forget  the past. Wealthy
        steel magnate Malcolm Patterson  hires Marielle as curator  of
        his art collection, and eventually business turns to pleasure.
        Marielle marries Malcolm and  soon after, she is  blessed with
        another son.  Marielle is  sure her  future is  finally coming
        together. But suddenly one  day, her son disappears,  bringing
        the memories of her past back with a vengeance. To her horror,
        Marielle's ex-husband  is arrested  on kidnapping  charges. In
        disbelief, she searches for  another possible answer with  the
        help of  FBI agent  John Taylor.  In this  intriguing mystery,
        based on the best selling novel, she discovers the  surprising
        fate of her son.
