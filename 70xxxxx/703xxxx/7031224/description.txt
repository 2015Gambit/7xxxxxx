 TWG's release has had it's headers stripped which is prohibited by the 720
 rule set. While we appreciate you finally adhearing to the LocalNet's source proof
 request there are still questions as to why your releases are consistantly smaller
 and fuzzier then ours using the same CRF value and settings. 

 Included in the sample folder are cuts that show just how fuzzy and lacking in detail
 TWG's encodes are. Notice the differences in the texture of the background and the details
 in the faces of the actors. The colors also look to be off.

 We tried encoding this episode multiple times with multiple settings and none of them 
 hit anywhere near the size of the TWG pre. While there may be some differences due to
 source providers and different affiliates there shouldn't be such a vast difference. Take
 that for what's it worth. We hate to see Canadian TV suffer encode wise like it's American
 big brother. We'll continue to pursue this until a time when it's fixed. Happy Valetines Day 
 you potheads.
