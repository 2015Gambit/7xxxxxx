    The film takes place in about a day and a half in Harry        
    Stoner's life. Harry is down on his luck, and trapped in his   
    own indulgences. He daydreams about his youth, trying to       
    escape from the fact that business is rotten and his company   
    owes bundles of money. His day is filled with unusual episodes 
    as he picks up a hitchhiker/prostitute, arranges for his       
    company's warehouse to burn down so he can collect the         
    insurance-money, he hires strippers for his buddies and gets   
    engaged in an animal rights campaign, a fashion show and       
    experiences a rather uncomfortable flashback to the war.
