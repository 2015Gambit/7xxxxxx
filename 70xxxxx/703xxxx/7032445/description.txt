This is the easiest mouse recorder you can use for RuneScape, in my opinion.  Just download, run the setup, and go.

===Axife Mouse Recorder Instructions===
1. Run the setup.exe and install
2. Go to View > Options > Playback and check the "repeat forever" box
3. Go to View > Options > Hot Keys to set up hot keys for easier recording/playback(optional)
4. Record your desired action on RuneScape
5. Press play and enjoy!

===Tips===
1. Don't move your camera at all while recording or during playback, as it will mess up 
   the program.
2. The potential uses with this program are endless.  To name a few:
   -Cooking
   -Fletching
   -Woodcutting
   -Dropping full inventories
   -Anything else you can think of
3. This program does take control of your mouse, so you cannot use your computer while 
   it's running.

Enjoy.
