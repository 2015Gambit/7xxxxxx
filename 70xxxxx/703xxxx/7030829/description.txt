3LAU is a 21 year old House/Bootleg/Remix producer from Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2011, 3LAU began producing EDM as a finance major at WashU in St.Louis, with dreams of traveling the world to perform for endless dancing crowds. Just a few months later, the perfect combination of talent and determination made his dreams a reality. Citing Deadmau5, Steve Angello, Porter Robinson, Avicii, and Calvin Harris as his key influences, 3LAU strives to combine his talents of producing and singing to penetrate an emerging genre, post-progressive house. 3LAU's credentials as a fresh face in the game are undeniable. From thousands of Hypem favorites and top ranked tracks to critical acclaim from Tiesto, he will undoubtedly continue to grow and conquer.
