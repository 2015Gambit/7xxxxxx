After spending two years in the slammer for grand theft auto, Don Keys is back on the street with only two things on his mind: love and revenge. With the help of his buddies, spastic Ricky and Stevie the drug dealer, Don sets out to track down Tommy, the slimy thief who bolted from the cops and left him to take the heat, and find happiness with Bella, the girl heâ€™s loved since childhood. But fate has other plans for the two-bit thug. Three men kidnap Bella in hopes of extorting five million dollars from her father, mobster Joseph Riccoli. But Riccoli doesnâ€™t have the money and the feds are watching his every move. The only way to get Bella back is to follow the trail of blood and deceit to where sheâ€™s being held. With the bravado and tenacity that earned him his nickname, Don Keys sets out to rescue Bella and attain the one thing in life heâ€™s never had â€“ a purpose.
