,WisdomValleser,2012-02-16T10:36Z,Is there a smaller version?
,s8n,2012-02-18T04:18Z,"Thnx for this, but jeebzus why rar up 1.5 gig? Takes an hr just to unrar it."
,setotitan,2012-02-18T19:04Z,"Yeah at the risk of sounding ungrateful, I have to say I hate these freaking multi-part RAR's just a pain in the ass!"
,flg8rfan,2012-02-23T02:25Z,"Yeah, I don't even download sceneline's files anymore.  If I want to watch the show, and keep a copy to reseed (like you're supposed to), I'd have to give up 3GB of space instead of just 1.5GB.  Makes no sense whatsoever."
