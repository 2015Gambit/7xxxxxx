[b] k so we made a nice 5.1 audio track
 for this with the audio from the DVDR and the BiDA
release, movie is much better now with full AC3
action flicks always are so we cleaned and filtered the audio, 
synced it to our release and made the 5.1 mix which
came out nice after the 4:15 mark where
the cam audio ended, did the usual to the video
so enjoy :)
