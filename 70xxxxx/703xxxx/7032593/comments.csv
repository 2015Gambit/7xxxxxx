Saved games worked for 4-5 days and suddenly today the game started to crash for every save every time.
This patch solved the problem for me."
,GoggaIor,2012-02-19T20:18Z,"I can't seem to change my resolution/windowed mode anymore. Originally I think I did so ingame, but now the video options say to use a configure window in the launcher. Game.exe and JaggedAllianceBIA.exe don't work (Steam Error Application Load Error P:0000065432) GameJABiA.exe launches straight into the game, and of course the skidrow launcher.exe is only for selecting language. Also the options files under public documents are encrypted."
