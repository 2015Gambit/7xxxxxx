,scotty35,2012-02-16T21:07Z,"silverkid, if your processor is only 2.3 mhz, that would be your problem, surely you mean 2.3 ghz, lol."

,proffsim,2012-02-17T06:45Z,"@RMJ113
Most overclockers have a really good system, if your computer sucks overclocking will not help that much.
Do me a favor and keep your retard comments of my internet you fucking faggot."

thanks for this upload"
,Pirat47,2012-02-17T18:23Z,"The patch improved 3D a little - but it's still unplayable in 3D IMO.
Apart from it, the only thing I've noticed is a tiny bug fix - while pressing keys W & D at the same time Alan no longer runs but walks like he should.

As to the stability, my game hasn't crashed even once (even before the patch): Q6600, GTX560, win7 x64"
,jetblast2,2012-02-18T04:39Z,"This update fixed crashing problem I was having with the original game.  (AMD Phenom 965 quad core, 8GB DDR3 RAM, dual ATI Radeon HD4870 graphics cards)  Much more fun when it runs without crashing."
