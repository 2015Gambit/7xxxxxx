Updated with new video\'s

Our YouTube videos have been taken down and our account dumped. We had
over 3,000 subscribers, 70 videos and over 7 million views. No nudity,
nothing salacious or pornographic, just hand ties and knots set to
music and overdubbed voice --- to much for YouTube to handle, I guess?

In truth all it takes is a handful of people flagging to kick off a
video, three videos down and your out. We stopped posting videos a
month ago to avoid losing the account and still we were taken down.

Our call to you all...

If you have any of our videos, start an account and POST THEM! If you
have bandwidth stick them up on your site (use them to get more
traffic - we don\'t care). Give them away, make DVDs, just don\'t charge
for them (no paysites).

We want them to stay free, now and years to come!

I\'m seriously bummedÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Âª
