Scottish Prisoner  - Diana Gabaldon,Epub,Mobi


London, 1760. For Jamie Fraser, paroled prisoner-of-war in the remote Lake District, life could be worse: Heâ€™s not cutting sugar cane in the West Indies, and heâ€™s close enough to the son he cannot claim as his own. But Jamie Fraserâ€™s quiet existence is coming apart at the seams, interrupted first by dreams of his lost wife, then by the appearance of Tobias Quinn, an erstwhile comrade from the Rising. 
 
Like many of the Jacobites who arenâ€™t dead or in prison, Quinn still lives and breathes for the Cause. His latest plan involves an ancient relic that will rally the Irish. Jamie is having none of itâ€”heâ€™s sworn off politics, fighting, and war. Until Lord John Grey shows up with a summons that will take him away from everything he lovesâ€”again.
 
Lord John Greyâ€”aristocrat, soldier, and occasional spyâ€”finds himself in possession of a packet of explosive documents that exposes a damning case of corruption against a British officer. But they also hint at a more insidious danger. Time is of the essence as the investigation leads to Ireland, with a baffling message left in â€œErse,â€ the tongue favored by Scottish Highlanders. Lord John, who oversaw Jacobite prisoners when he was governor of Ardsmiur prison, thinks Jamie may be able to translateâ€”but will he agree to do it?
 
Soon Lord John and Jamie are unwilling companions on the road to Ireland, a country whose dark castles hold dreadful secrets, and whose bogs hide the bones of the dead. A captivating return to the world Diana Gabaldon created in her Outlander and Lord John series, The Scottish Prisoner is another masterpiece of epic history, wicked deceit, and scores that can only be settled in blood.
