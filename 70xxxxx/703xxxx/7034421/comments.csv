Looking for some Michael Chabon books I've not seen elsewhere - 

1) Mysteries of Pittsburgh
2) Wonder Boys
3) The Yiddish Police something or other whose name I forget. (I am an idiot, I know)

Thanks, in advance, if you are able to do these (mobi format) - And double thanks for everything you've done in the past and in the future for others (in which I benefitted)"
