[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-17T16:32Z,i was going to upload to Demonoid but there is a lot of files of Dad's Army already on there so i have only uploaded here to The Pirate bay after reading some comments from people wanting it uploaded so please enjoy a very funny british Comedy series of years gone by
,SectorVector,2012-02-17T17:59Z,Season 2 doesn't seem to be complete. Only 3 episodes present. Could you have a look pl.
[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-17T18:10Z,@SectorVector there is only three episodes of season 2 left the others were either lost or erased by the BBC so unless anyone has any old tapes hidden away anywhere we are never ever going to see them
,SectorVector,2012-02-17T18:52Z,I think i remember having heard about missing episodes. Thanks for clarifying. Such a pity. I hope you will you be uploading more seasons.
[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-17T20:06Z,@SectorVector i will be uploading all series and Xmas Specials as i convert them and as each is seeded
,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2012-02-18T04:43Z,"Thanks so much,this is fantastic."
,BKKJack,2012-02-21T05:09Z,"Thank You.

There was a rumour last year that 2 more episodes of Season 2 had been found in Aus but alas it proved not to be....

...still, one hopes that in someone's dusty old loft someone will find these and all the Doctor Who eps too..."
[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-21T13:22Z,@BKKJack yes we can only hope funnier things have happened
