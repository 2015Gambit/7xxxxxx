Someone please comment 'bout the A/V quality."
,XKillerBoy,2012-03-02T20:21Z,Quality doesn't look much better than the 700MB torrents. But it's okay for 10 minutes download.
,jitu757,2012-04-01T00:55Z,What is so difficult to understand that cams are not considered high resolution.  When I search for high res movies and a cam shows up because uploaders not labeling their shit correctly then it's a waste of our time.  720p and higher is HIGH RESOLUTION!!
,Ecclesiast,2012-04-21T10:24Z,"Um... it IS 720p. But since it's a cam, the quality is still pretty mediocre."
