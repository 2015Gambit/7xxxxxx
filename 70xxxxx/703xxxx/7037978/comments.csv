,fire3k,2012-02-17T16:51Z,if you look in update folder the L.A.Noire.v1.2.2610.Update.exe is 84.7MB. In the SKIDROW\final\pc\ you will see that there are dlc files. and in every update these same dlc files included.

The DLC files are not the same, they changed from the last release and grew in size."

,lal_rice,2012-02-25T14:49Z,is it necesaary to download the DLC
,shank3d,2012-03-09T22:48Z,um.. if you installed the game via downloads alrdy and it's a cracked version and you played on it; the game saved a couple of cases already. Then you download and install this would it overwrite your saved cases and make you start over again? Would this update also say crash the game? just wondering..
