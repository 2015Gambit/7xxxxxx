	The complete episodes of the Smurfs.
In addition some special episodes,
And The Magic Flute Movie.
Please seed once you finish downloading..

Here are A few Screenshots from some of the shows... When I got these files it didn't say what the quality was but by

looking at a few of them they look like TV-Rips... I have added 2 samples of season 1 with the quality of the smaller show

size and one of the lager show size to compare the quality.

Info I got from one of the episodes...
