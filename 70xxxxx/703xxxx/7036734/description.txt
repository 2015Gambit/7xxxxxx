CrashSerious releases an update to his FSM tool, FactoryServiceMode Tool v0.2 (current
changelog below). With this application, Jailbroken PS3 Consoles no longer need the
assistance of a JIG device in order to get into Factory/Service Mode. This means that one
will be able to downgrade their consoles with ease, simply by running a PKG installed to
their XMB. Also, this is another way to access and play around with Factory/Service mode.
