,keeganzo,2012-02-17T12:02Z,Love the small files...charlessfire22 used to upload quite a few but dropped off the radar and I miss him dearly...glad to see someone taking the helm on good quality small files for those of us with slow speeds. Would love to see The Mentalist / Southland / The Finder / Fringe / Luck / Shameless / The Good Wife. Whatever you can do...it's great! Thanx a lot.
