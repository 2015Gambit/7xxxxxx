Harnessing energy from the elements, and inspiration from their adventures across wild British Landscape, the much anticipated colourful release from the fast rising folk septet offers evocative images, blistering tunes and vivid songs with a virtuosity and vitality which draws from their classical and jazz informed backgrounds.

Landing five-star reviews, Songlines Magazine's Top Of The World 2010, and nominations for Best Original Song from Spiral Earth, 2010's Forecast was recorded in the Mountains of Snowdonia and features tracks such as The Enlli Light, John Ball, Spaghetti Panic and Strange Highway.
