,mantasuk,2012-02-27T22:26Z,"Great quality. I'm afraid I can't say the same about the film. Rubbish acting and tons of inaccurate information. I mean, virgin oracle played by an indian girl who has sex with a dude. Come on...really? 10/2"
,osriccc,2012-03-01T04:20Z,Image is really good despite some artifaction that you won't even notice if you don't have my eyes... but I'm afraid this wasn't ripped straight from a 1080p Blu-ray disc (has some of the Chinese rip defects so I guess it was re-encoded from the infamous HD China rip). The movie would be totally perfect if it wasn't for the sound. It's broken in some of the parts of the movie and the levels are pretty fucked up. I suggest (if you're as OCD as me) waiting for the US Blu-ray to come out and for someone to make a proper brand new rip from it.
