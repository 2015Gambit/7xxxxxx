Circus 2010, six episodes, pbs

In a world that offers a dizzying array of amusements and entertainments, there is none quite so enduring or so universal as the circus. Now, over the course of six dramatic and mesmerizing hours, Show of Force will take us away to the circus - not just under the big top, but far beyond it: into what circus folk call "the backyard," the place where the trailers are parked and the real heart of the circus beats. With unprecedented access granted by the Big Apple Circus, the filmmaking team followed this traveling company over the course of an entire season. The series will immerse viewers in a rich collection of human stories, simultaneously compelling our fascination, and appealing to our shared humanity. 

I was seeding these individually but it makes more sense to merge them into one torrent.
