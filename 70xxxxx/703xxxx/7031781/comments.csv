,bida_anti_dvd,2012-02-15T02:54Z,"BiDA you have done it again.
Just like the Puss and Boots torrent.

This one does not work on dvd players or the xbox.

I have even changed around the options on convertxtodvd and still nothing.

I have tried it on various dvd players and in a few you get no audio at all, and in the others you get no video or audio just like the xbox 360

I have never experienced this with any other avi or movies I have downloaded

BiDA is doing something tottally different and terribly wrong

I have no clue what it is, but the file comes as an AVI, so everyone please avoid this.

It does work properly with VLC, but once burned, it has many problems

V8  A6
COPY NEGATIVE TEN because of compatibility issues, I am not the only one having this problem
Search for his Puss and Boots torrent

Please stop uploading BiDA's torrents, or please specify that they may have hidden problems "
