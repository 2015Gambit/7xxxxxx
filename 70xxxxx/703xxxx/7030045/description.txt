NOTES:

sources: 
Video is same as our cam but audio is from TAPE ...thanks.Audio was nice and synced but contained some noise and also there
was several parts of repeated video without audio and audio repeats.

Workdone:
Took the audio cleaned it good and proper by using a hiss and noise removal and changed all the EQ bands and then remuxed to our 
cam encode.....
Now considering we spent so much time doing this we decided to cut all the unwanted repeated scenes and audio overlaps from the first
14mins ....in total 9 cuts were needed and had too remove 29 secs of crap.
But now you have a complete version,without all them fack ups.......enjoy folks.

Frame 128965 (1:25:58.600) [ ]  TAPES
Frame 128230 (1:25:29.200) [ ]  INSPiRAL

Oh and this is not knocking TAPE as it was 26k that did all them errors in the first place and made it a PITA to sync for anyone.
But thought it was worth the extra time to correct it all.
