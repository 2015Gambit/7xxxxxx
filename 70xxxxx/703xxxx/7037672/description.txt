Information
------------------------------

Drama-documentary recreating the life and loves of three French Kings: Louis XIV, XV and XVI and the Palace of Versailles.


1)  The Dream of a King 
Drama-documentary recreating the life and loves of France's most famous king, Louis XIV. Dubbed the Sun King by his admiring court, Louis conquered half of Europe, conducted dozens of love affairs and dazzled his contemporaries with his lavish entertainments. But perhaps his greatest achievement - and certainly his longest lasting love - was the incredible palace he built at Versailles, one of the wonders of the world. Produced in 2008.

2)  The Palace of Pleasure 
A glorious costumed romp through the most scandalous years of the Palace of Versailles, telling the story of Louis XV, one of history's greatest libertines. Louis ruled for almost 60 years, when the salons of Versailles were filled with the glories of the Age of the Enlightenment, and a society freeing itself of the constraints of the previous century. As a military leader he was popular and successful, but he then led France into the disastrous Seven Year War with Britain. As his Empire dwindled and his treasury emptied, Louis amused himself with a series of scandalous love affairs, set up his own private brothel in the gardens of his palace and bedded five sisters from the same aristocratic family. He fathered at least 30 illegitimate children, survived an assassination attempt and for many years effectively shared power with his favourite mistress - the glamorous and brilliant Madame Pompadour. Produced in 2011.

3)  Countdown to Revolution 
Lavish drama-documentary chronicling the final days of the Bourbon dynasty under the ill-fated Louis XVI and his Queen, Marie Antoinette. Unlike his highly-sexed forebears, it takes Louis seven years to consummate his marriage - and his performance as ruler of France is no more distinguished than his efforts in the royal bed chamber. The French people are starving, but the aristocracy is too busy partying inside the gilded palace of Versailles to take much notice. Louis tries to make a difference, but his every attempt at reform is blocked by his greedy relatives. Marie Antoinette gets much of the blame for the excesses of the rich, even if she never uttered the famous words "let them eat cake". As he drifts into depression and madness, Louis and his Queen attempt to stave off a revolution, pleading with the nobility to accept reform. But it is too late - the extravagance of Versailles, which once served the glory of France so well, backfires into the ending of the monarchy itself. Produced in 2011.
