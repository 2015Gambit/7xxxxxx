Despite taking most of their cues from emotional hardcore, these kids arent set on being depressed; this is rowdy, fist-raising material, at once both urgent and uplifting. The most obvious link is Cap'n Jazz and their brand of youthful emo, but they stretch their songs beyond the brief, energetic punches of the aforementioned legends and make them into structured epics infused with dynamic chords, ornate drumming and gang vocal releases. There is always a palpable energy that drives the tracks forward, and even when they exceed the 6-minute mark this momentum isnt lost, making the inevitable cymbal crashes all the more powerful. They also know just the right time to drop into gorgeous American Football style interludes; youd think they were pros in the scene with such masterful songwriting. For all their ambition though, they never lose the image of a bunch of kids messing around in a garage, creating sporadic, spirited music that acts as a call to arms for feeling good.
