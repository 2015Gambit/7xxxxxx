However...I was wondering, If I wanted to install custom content/mods/hacks etc...how would I go about doing this?"
,JohnHolmesII,2012-02-17T18:33Z,"@labellavienna
That depends on which method you chose to use. Using the recommended install, the best thing to do would be to go to http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/.
This site has thousand of free mods. They also offer a modding tool called the Nexus Mod Manager, found at http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/content/modmanager/."
,JohnHolmesII,2012-02-17T18:39Z,"This site allows you to download their mods directly through the mod manager, and install them into Skyrim in a managed way. Not much thought is necessary, and the manager handles all file transactions.

If you want to install mods manually, most mods go in ""[Install drive]: [Skyrim install folder] /Data/"" .
However most mods will simply tell you how they should be installed.

If you were just wondering if mods are okay to use on a cracked copy, the answer is yes, and rest assured no extra steps are necessary compared to a purchased copy of the game.

And really, it was de rien."

,labellavienna,2012-02-17T18:53Z,Another quick question....(sorry) has this been updated to the newest patch...1.04? And would i be able to download future patches from Bethesda as well as any DLCs purchased?
,labellavienna,2012-02-17T23:23Z,BTW..I tried to install mods using Nexus mod manager...however mods do not show up in the game.  Is there a specific place where the game must be installed?
,JohnHolmesII,2012-02-18T20:47Z,"@labellavienna
You will not be able to get updates from Bethesda directly, as the only way to do this is through Steam. However, cracked updates are available through the pirate bay, and you can use those updates using what I have here. 

Yes, this is version 1.4 (read the file description)

Open Mod Manager, go to Settings -> Skyrim and make sure the install directory listed is the proper Skyrim game directory.

While still in Mod Manager, go to the Plugins tab and make sure you check all the check boxes and push ""Launch Skyrim"" from the mod manager. This will bring up the Skyrim Launch screen, whereupon you will see an option labelled ""Data Files"". Make sure all are checked here as well.

You will not need to always go through the Mod Manager first, but you should do so after installing a new mod.

If problems persist, please give a more detailed account thereof."

,JohnHolmesII,2012-02-19T04:18Z,"@skyrimplayer
I believe what you are describing is a bug, and I've heard of it before. You may want to try starting a new game.

As to the lack of audio, make sure nothing is muted,   never alt+tab out of the game, and check the ingame audio settings.

If all else fails, try simply reinstalling the game.
Always recheck the steps listed in the README.

if your problems persist, please give a more detailed account of your problem."

,JohnHolmesII,2012-02-20T03:01Z,"@Jayzamine

That file is responsible for decoding Bink! Video files.

binkw32.dll is included in the .iso file I uploaded.

You either:

a) Deleted the file accidentally

b) Didn't extract the file correctly

c) Had a download error


Option 1: Download the file directly
http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?binkw32

And put it in the Skyrim game directory.

Option 2: Remove the torrent from your downloader and re-add it, set the download location to the same spot (don't override) and do a re-check (Usually a right click menu will have this option).
If the torrent finishes the re-check and is incomplete, just finish downloading.

If it finishes the re-check and is still at 100%, then simply re-install the game via the README."

Try modifying the shortcut on your desktop to run the launcher as an administrator.

You may want to have task manager open when you click TESV.exe and watch what happens. Might be interesting.
Well, at this point, seeing as I do not have your computer in front of mine, it would be very difficult to proceed. I must recommend, therefore, that you try Option 1 instead.

If you should thus choose, keep in mind Windows   Â can get very upset if you install into Program Files, so try installing into, say, C:/Games in order to avoid further issues.

Everything went well and I've been able to get everything working just fine, I do however have  a problem that popped up and hope you can help!


I've come to the Esbern problem where he has no dialogue/won't interact  properly. I have looked up the various ways to fix this bug but can't implement any of them because for some reason there is no Skyrim directory installed for your version. All the stuff that normally would be in one are held in the mounted .iso, the only files I do have on my computer are my saves and a few .pref files located in the same place.




If you know of a way to fix Esbern with your file, or why in the world there is no program directory, please help! It will mean a ton and be absolutely amazing if anyone can help me fix this!"
,JohnHolmesII,2012-05-15T16:01Z,"@DirEnGrey
Ahhh....
Well, I don't know of a specific fix for that.
But there is no directory because the ""directory"" is in the iso.
If you want to take that stuff out, using winrar, then you may, as this would enable you to update."
,DirEnGrey,2012-05-18T01:36Z,"Yeah, that's what I figured, thank you for responding though! 

How can I modify/update with winrar..? I can't change the .iso unless in any way I know of, so I can't use the various Esbern fixes.


Also I noticed you uploaded a different torrent that had the addition of the creation kit and patch number 7, do you know by chance if that patch fixed the Esbern bug? I'm either too tired or too retarded to find out much using google/info/links included. "
,Cuno99,2012-05-18T10:06Z,What to do after download?
,JohnHolmesII,2012-05-18T15:50Z,"@DirEnGrey
It doesn't have any esbern fixes listed...
it wouldn't hurt to extract the game and update to patch 8.

I think if you open the iso in winrar, then drag and drop files into the window, it will update them.

@Cuno99 
Follow the README instructions."

If you use utorrent, just right click the file and hit Force Recheck.

If it's still at 100%, and still doesn't extract, you are a wizard. Try updating winrar.



@TheBSage 
use SkyrimLauncher.exe, not TESV.exe

Change the resolution in Options."
