Awaiting your release of Warrior (2011) in full glory; 1920 x 1080. Also ""Taking Shelter"".

Naive Qn: Why are some of your encodes in 1920 x 1080 while some are 1920 x 800 ? Isn't the former better ? There is a 1920 x 800 (1080p) Kingdom release on tpb, but its somewhat ""noisy"". Hence my request.

Check out Warrior (2011) on IMDB.  Notice that the Aspect Ratio is 2.35 : 1 .  So you shouldn't see a copy in 1920 x 1080. Otherwise the aspect ratio would be off."
,SectorVector,2012-02-18T16:19Z,Thanks for clarifying thecooldk. I'll spend some time on wikipedia :)
