The ""big-boys"" -- eztv, sceneline, TvTeam, etc. -- have really been MIA this week on a great many of the programs they normally UL, not the least of which are programs from the UK. It's enough to make conspiracy ""theorists"" like me go ""hmmmmmm."""

Colbert was reportedly fired, and eztv does not have this on their web site"

Unlike you, who evidently like to make FoxNews-like ""people say"" statements, here are some FACTS, from the WSJ:

Stephen Colbert has suspended production of his satirical comedy show temporarily because of an emergency in Mr. Colbert's family, according to people familiar with the show.

""The Colbert Report"" is expected to resume production soon, perhaps as early as next week, the people added.

Comedy Central, the Viacom Inc. network that airs the show, had stoked speculation about the fate of ""The Colbert Report"" when it issued a cryptic statement canceling the tapings of the show scheduled for the remainder of this week.

""Due to unforeseen circumstances, the show will air repeat episodes on Wednesday, February 15 and Thursday, February 16,"" network spokesman Steve Albani said in an emailed statement.
