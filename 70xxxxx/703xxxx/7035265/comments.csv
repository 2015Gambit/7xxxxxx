This installs a Full W7 to a Key or HD (not installs an installer of W7) . This is not a cut down version, PE or Live version it's Full BLOWN Windows 7 on a USB stick :)"
,Darkdragontc,2012-02-16T07:26Z,Thanks!! Can't wait to use it hehe.

[T],FightingBigBrother,2012-02-16T19:26Z,"Darkdragontc & kankur thxs 

marc93 a question if I'm not seeding how are peers at 80% ? Please use a bit of thought before posting pointless comments thxs . "
[T],faren73,2012-02-16T21:44Z,"hey great upload, thanks for sharing. Maybe marc93 simply means that if i download this, but limit my upload to 1 kb while doing so and everyone does the same thing, then it will slow things down alot and you will have to use alot more of YOUR bandwidth to get this seeded. So I will say it also, please share the way you expect people to share, everyone!"
[T],FightingBigBrother,2012-02-20T07:06Z,"@all thxs for the seeding support it was a long haul to get it upped but you stuck with it :)
@faren73 NP ;) 
@Hiroshimarr read my first post then read this :

The Windows 7 USB/DVD Download tool.... bla blah blah .....This tool allows you to create a copy of the ISO file to a USB flash drive or a DVD. To install Windows 7 from your USB flash drive or DVD

Big Difference between W7 on a stick and an installer for W7 on a stick. Hope you see the difference. "
,l0vey,2012-02-22T14:35Z,heyy i was jst thinkin if i could use an ip0d instead 0f a usb key..
,gunnar187033,2012-02-28T11:40Z,"i just install this and everything works fine for maybe 2 hours i had installed avg antivirus en scan the computer there where 4 viruses inside with avg i had deleted the viruses. Then i went to windows and download the dutch language package becouse this one was in englisch then try to restart the computer but my computer doest work anymore the only thing what it says is windows failed to start a recent hardware or software change might be the cause to fix the problem: 

1:insert the windows installation disc and restart the computer.

2 choose your language settings and then click next.

3 repair your computer

this wont work with the windows 7 ultimate usb drive edition or either with other windows versions on the pirate bay i dont know what to do now.. 

On the bottem of the field stands:

file/ windows/system32/drivers/partmgr.sys

status: 0x0000221

info: windows failed to load becouse a crytical system driver is missing or corrupt...

Can somebody giv me advice for what to do now becouse something fucked up my netbook.."
,ian1997,2012-03-01T20:38Z,"the win7 usb edition v4 is build 7600.. anyone who uses sfc with it will make its copy build 7601..and thats a big problem to anyone coz its kinda hard to make it real genuine.. there is but 1 solution with it............i'll post a video on it soon on youtube..
and also windows aero is disabled...there is an alternative way to make pocket windows cool!!"
,ian1997,2012-03-09T23:33Z,ill post the link later..
[T],FightingBigBrother,2012-03-10T14:21Z,"i had installed avg antivirus en scan the computer there where 4 viruses inside with avg i had deleted the viruses ..... DOUH 
There are no viruses, there never will be on anything I have or will upload. 
Avg lmao get a security layer system to protect your PC not a toy wannabe free useless AV . You don't know what to do now because you FAIL to read ."
[T],FightingBigBrother,2012-03-10T14:26Z,the win7 usb edition v4 is build 7600.. anyone who uses sfc with it will make its copy build 7601..and thats a big problem to anyone coz its kinda hard to make it real genuine..   VERY STRANGE as there are current a few hundred people running this including myself without issue .Mines 100% updated and drivers integrated showing as genuine .  Mis-information TROLL elsewhere .
,ian1997,2012-03-10T21:14Z,"@FightingBigBrother
why dont you drop some piece of advice to those who needs help instead of saying non sensible things?youre just to happy only when someone appreciates you for your uploads trusted uploader boy.."
,ian1997,2012-03-10T21:23Z,"well anyway...
what i meant to my previous msg is that.. after you run sfc, instead of having a genuine copy youll end up having a trial copy of windows..
sorry about that msg..im not really good at explaining things...and besides, i cant edit the msg i submitted already..

so heres the link on youtube:"
[T],FightingBigBrother,2012-03-11T04:18Z,ian1997 go to any upload of W7 that's pirated and its the same crap ..... if you remove the 'VIRUS' .... then your W7 activation is gone ! Uninstall first and delete HAL from the folder . Then go get an activation method that no virus picks up as a false positive.  If you want help you don't troll peoples torrents with incorrect info. This has nothing to do with sfc . I look forward to your You Tube video .
,ian1997,2012-03-11T09:40Z,"fightingB...im no good at explainations...the things i want to tell seemed not what people think..and i am very sorry for that..i cant erase the msg nor i cant edit it..trolling?u misunderstood me.. it was my mistake for not having a good english....sorry for that again

its all about the sfc though, after applying that blah blah blah...and when trying to use win loader it cant be activated even using other activators,well perhaps for awhile itll make your windows genuine but on the next reboot back to trial copy again....
...well, i have nothing to say...
i cant post any links here..dont know why..
and..i deleted my vid this morning right after i watched it..seemed ok on my computer but on youtube the texts are urgh..i couldnt take it..my vid editor must be that freak..have to edit again..


well,sory pal and for the people whos thoughts are diff after reading my previous msgs......"
[T],FightingBigBrother,2012-03-11T15:00Z,"Most people make the classic mistake of letting their  Anti-Virus delete the Activation . If this happens then HAL7600 (activation) will still be installed but not functioning correctly . You have to find it , run it again to uninstall properly, reboot and run a second time to install activation. Turn your av off until this is done , when your av goes back on it detects 2 files these are HAL's and meant to be, use an exception rule in your AV . Also don't install : KB971033 to be on the safe side. I have tested this with 4 different activators (and over 20 builds of W7) and have had no issues . Believe me if it didn't work or had crap in it I won't waste time uploading and sharing. If you look in the Read Me you can go to the site where lots of others have successfully ran it. Its not Windows protecting files that's the problem, all that work has been done and checked , it's AVs messing with activation. You need to clean out your previous activation in order to reactivate. Hope this sorts you out.  "
,SirLeon12,2012-04-18T05:09Z,seeding plz.... :)
