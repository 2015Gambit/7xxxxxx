njoy the beauty of the French Polynesian Islands in Flight Simulator X. Tahiti X includes almost the complete archipelago covering 14 islands and 9 airports with a detailed mesh and many animations.
Of course this product should have been named French Polynesia X, but Tahiti X just sounds a lot better. But almost the complete archipelago is included covering a massive two and a half million kilometers. Distances between the islands are massive so you need an aircraft that has a reasonable cruise speed and twins are highly recommended. Of course a twin that can land on water is ideal. For example the Twin Otter we done (it even comes with a correct livery) or the default Grumman Goose. An ideal destination for a dark evening!
