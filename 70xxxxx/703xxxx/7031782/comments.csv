,max216,2012-03-17T00:14Z,Is this software work? Thanks!
,LegolasDRoger,2012-03-18T15:41Z,"barrobas: Some times the calculator does some mistakes. But open the cmd.exe and write ipconfig /all and see the hostname and replace in the license.txt. 

Works for me. 

cifuentesemilio2010: it happens because the license file is not running. Just install the license file on License Manager and, probably, everything will be okay.

max216: yeah, it works! o/"
,LegolasDRoger,2012-03-18T15:46Z,"jpir: I couldn't find any library YET ;)

,max216,2012-03-21T17:57Z,"Hello,

I have problem following these two steps :

4. Open MAGNITUDE paste in your desktop and run the calculator;
5. Copy the license file to C:Program FilesANSYS IncShared FilesLicensing;

I do not find the calculator and the license file. What are their names? and where can I find them?
Many thanks!
Max"
,LegolasDRoger,2012-03-27T16:25Z,The calculator is inside the MAGNITUDE file. You can find it when you mount the image. 
,cifuentesemilio2010,2012-03-27T17:05Z,"@LegolasDRoger: thanks, now it is working great"
,max216,2012-03-31T19:46Z,ok thanks and where is the license file?
,ricki1,2012-04-08T19:28Z,"Ok, so I installed by following the instructions (which are terrible, BTW) and Fluent seems to work fine as long as I am not connected to the internet. 

As soon as I dial up to my ISP, I get the error ""Failover feature 'ANSYS ICEM CFD' specified in license preferences is not available. Request name aienv does not exist in the licensing pool."" and Fluent does not work. 

When I disconnect my dial up connection to the internet and restart Workbench and Fluent, everything works again. How do I fix this so that I can use both Ansys and be connected to the internet at the same time?

Has anyone gotten a simulation to run in parallels?"
