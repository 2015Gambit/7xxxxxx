                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy is a utter shit show with psychedelic character 
 based comedy show half filmed and half animated, with music provided by       
 Kasabian's Sergio Pizzorno.                                                   
                                                                               
 Along with animator/director Nigel Coan (The Mighty Boosh, Bunny and the      
 Bull), Fielding has created a joyful, charming explosion of a TV show that is 
 in the tradition of Spike Milligan and Kenny Everett but completely modern at 
 the same time.                                                                
                                                                               
 The show is like biting into an aurora borealis sandwich...like Salvador Dali 
 and Mick Jagger recreating The Jungle Book using toast... Warm and strange and
 packed with jokes, Luxury Comedy will change the way you feel about television
 and your own hands forever.                                                   
                                 Enjoy!
