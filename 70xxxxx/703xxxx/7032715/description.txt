The Android platform continues to aggressively grow in market share against competing mobile platforms, such as Apple iOS and BlackBerry. Androidâ€™s latest major platform update, Android 4.0, frequently called by its code-name, Ice Cream Sandwich or just ICS merges the smartphone-centric Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread) and the tablet-centric Android 3.x (Honeycomb) platform editions into a single SDK for all smart-devices, be they phones, tablets, televisions, or toasters.
