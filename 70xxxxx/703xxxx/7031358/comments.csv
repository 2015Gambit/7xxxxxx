The passwords are automatically generated.
And that's the beauty of this community: if you don't like it you can get it from someone else. :)"
,roger21,2012-02-14T21:46Z,"well, can't you post a rar/zip instead ?"

I never had any security problems with ChattChitto's torrents. 
As he said: ""if you don't like it you can get it from someone else"""
,roger21,2012-02-15T03:10Z,"oh i know don't worry, i'm just saying, i prefer open clear thing, you know like when you eat you prefer knowing there is shitty preservatives or corn syrup and stuff instead of not knowing... or like you prefer knowing that the government is going to screw you with new law instead of not knowing... that's the same with my computer, i prefer installing simple virus-checkable stuff instead of a password protected big black box that do who know what, that is all, i'm using EAT stuff and i'll continue"

I see that you really care about that, and still maintain constructive comments so you deserve a decent reply.. :)
I'll start explaining from the beginning:
It gives you the option to extract because its actually a zip file compiled in a .exe file, however when you run it, all the .exe file is extract the contents of that zip file so you use it as you wish (hence the music, background, nfo, etc...) anyway once it has been extracted it will be doing so on your PC.
That's where everything will be out of the zip and where your anti-virus will actually scan the whole release in its extracted state.

I hope I replied and clarified it to you, your anti-virus do have the ability and does scan the release.
I release for fun and I enjoy doing it this way. That's why i haven't change the way i do it, and i thank users for trusting me after years of releasing :)"
