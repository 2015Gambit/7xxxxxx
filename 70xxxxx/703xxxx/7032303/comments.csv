,southernchick,2012-02-16T10:40Z,"Downloaded another torrent from Mystic yesterday (feb 15); Safe.House.2012.720p.AC3-MYSTiC. Seems to have been taken off tpb today. That torrent only makes my vlc-player crash! Attached txt-file says to download another file if one can't see the movie... that file is a mp3-file which doesn't help at all, off course.

I will never again download anything from this Mystic-guy!"
