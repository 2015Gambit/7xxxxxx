New Snapshot for Mame32 Aussie Pokies (feb2012)

for use with 12 aussie pokies rar file recently uploaded

===

Just Unzip-Unrar using winrar to the Mameui32 SNAP folder

eg C:\Real Aussie Pokies - Mame32\MameUI32\snap

then the screen snaps should show up dates as you scroll
up and down on the pokie machine icon in the mame menu

make sure the Snaps tab is select not flyer or cabinet
though :) those I havent got yet

make sure to say copy and replace if using vista or windows 7

if they dont show then you did something wrong in copying

you should be able to extract using winrar to that location directly
even.

ENJOY AND HELP SEED THIS SMALL 8mb ADD-ON

hope you like the improvements
