Note
Okay, so:
First 2 minutes are in russian [no english for that i suppose, at least TS didn`t have it]. Then like 2 minutes of LiNE, 2 minutes of CAM audio, and thee rest is LiNE.
Some scenes missing, added russian audio in those places [in one scene there`s some dialogue but fortunately there are english subs hardcoded].
Rest is fine, synced pretty well.

What do they say in those first 2 minutes: it`s like story about previous movies. Friends became enemies etc, nothing important.
