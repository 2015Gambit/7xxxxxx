In order to get this game to pass Stealth, download ABGX and run the fix. It will ask you to download a L1 moviefile that you can find if you visit the ABGX site (about 80MBs). This is a security check, and it is important that you have it simply to play the game! Your backup won't work without it.

Now, the caveat is that while it will work, there's no guarantee that this release was ripped properly. I've never come across this issue before, so your mileage may vary! There's a lot that goes into making and dumping a backup, including the angle of a burn (crazy right?!), so I don't know what it means when a release is missing an important security check. Also, an XGD2 release in 2012? I'm not sure why that is or if this was maybe downgraded from 3 to 2.

Any new info would be great. See you on the wheel of fate!"

Catherine PAL would be another example here. Small studio. XGD2 doesn't mean it must be a bad game. You cannot scale down XGD3 to XGD2."

There are certain games (FFXIII-2 comes to mind) that have XGD3 to 2 patches. There are a few other items of note, such as the missing video file, that gave me an unsure impression. I thought I'd bring it up at the very least to provide additional information.

I'm enjoying my backup, and so far no problems have arisen."
