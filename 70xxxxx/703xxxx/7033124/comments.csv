It is not region free, it is NTSC-U North American (but that doesn't mean it can't be played on European PAL or japanese/korean NTSC-J console). It is the full game, the other 2.8 GB that would make it a 4.38 GB ISO file is just empty, useless data. Consider a WBFS file to be similar to a scrubbed ISO.

Most new Xbox 360 games are dual-layer DVD-9 (if not all) and that is why they are larger in size even when empty data is removed (not to mention those games are HD and the Wii is not)."
