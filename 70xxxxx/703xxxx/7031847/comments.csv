,msmmpts,2012-02-20T15:40Z,trail reset is not working.
,bedessy1,2012-02-22T03:44Z,you need the old version 5.0 for this ntr3.3.1 or 3.3.0 reset the old version 5.0 and get 150 days think check for new version and upgrade to 6.0 version and still have 150 days which the last I checked is better than 30 days.
,bhutu,2012-03-14T06:33Z,@bedessy1: It didn't worked for me !!! I had installed Norton 360 ver 5 and made it work for 180 days by installing NTR 3.3.1 then updated it and then applied  Norton 360 v6.0.0.145 in hope that it will remain 180 days. But found that it has turned into a 30days trial .
