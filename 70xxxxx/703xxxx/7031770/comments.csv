,TheBanner,2012-02-16T10:54Z,"This torrent doesn't have a .cue file to run the image on Nero or any other program, so u have to create one after downloading this torrent ...
I found this helpful article on how to do so (written by some1 called David Kirk form Tech-Recipes com):

''For example, weâ€™ll start with an example file called gameiso.bin.

1. Right click on a blank space in the same folder
2. Select new text document
3. Double click to open your New Text Document.txt
4. Paste this into the file:

FILE ""gameiso.bin"" BINARY
TRACK 01 MODE1/2352
INDEX 01 00:00:00

Make sure you edit the text gameiso.bin to the exact name of your bin file.

5. Click File menu
6. Click Save
7. Click the Red X to close it
8. Right click the New Text Document.txt and select Rename
9. Rename it like your bin file except with a cue extension:
gameiso.cue
10. Now any program that can read CD-rom ISOs (nero, alcohol, etc) should be ready to read the file.''

Hope that helps and Thank u uploader ... :-)"
