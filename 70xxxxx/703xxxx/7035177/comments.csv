,dumbson,2012-02-16T01:21Z,is this for real?  anyone?
,ih8fakez,2012-02-16T17:23Z,its real dumbson but the audio is bad i give a rating of A6 V 9 mostly because the vidoe is cropped off to remove the subtitles and the audio is straight bootleg theater style which is the main reason SONYs systems have Cinevia which is a digital watermark that wont allow you to stream to PS3 or play burned DVDs off it. Its just like IMMORTALS its great video but the sound is terrible VIVA LE PIRATES!
