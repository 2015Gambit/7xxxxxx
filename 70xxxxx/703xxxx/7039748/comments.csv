It would be nice if someone could get a slot for this, though... it's been stuck at less than 1% all day."
,MStryderNorth,2012-02-20T16:17Z,Like everyone else I have my real doubts about this being a real active torrent.  Two days and stuck at less than 1%.  I know it says 2 seeders but its dead.
,hubris4242,2012-04-04T19:45Z,"OK, Finally downloaded this. 

Video quality is quite good. 

Audio is not original language; lips don't match words. My guess is that this was originally Mandarin, but we have the Cantonese audio here with Chinese subtitles for Mandarin speakers. 

There are NO English subtitles in the torrent, and the Chinese subs are hard-coded. You can get .srt English subs in other torrents, but have to display them over the Chinese, which is a little annoying."
