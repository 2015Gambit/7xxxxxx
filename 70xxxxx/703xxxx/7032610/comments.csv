,replaysMike,2012-04-06T09:40Z,"I had the same problem couldnt convert it to .iso...did some research and here is what to do:

1) Open your downloaded .dmg file using 7-zip file manager (winrar doesn't support Xars)

2) Go into the InstallMacOSX.pkg folder

3) Extract the ""InstallESD.dmg"" :)

4) Now you have a valid dmg file

5) Convert this new .dmg with your prefered method to .iso...and enjoy!!

hope this helps you guys, this worked for me!!"
