    Total Commander (former Wincmd) is a file manager for Windows      
    (TM) similar to the Windows Explorer. But Total Commander uses a   
    different approach: it has two fixed windows side by side like a   
    well-known file manager for DOS.                                   
                                                                       
    Here are some features of Total Commander...
