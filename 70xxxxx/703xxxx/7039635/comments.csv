Not the best Adam Sandler film, a good few laughs in it. Give it watch for yourself."
,kris_tof,2012-02-18T18:10Z,I had to check this one out since it had a 3.0 rating at imdb. I was not disappointed.
,BBfan,2012-02-19T06:42Z,"I watched ten minutes of this movie and as soon as I heard Jill speak in her 
obnoxious voice, I was like, '' you gotta be kiddin' me ''. Within two minutes there is so much advertising it's like they went to commercial break. Best thing was, ten minutes in my ps3 had that protection on and it muted the sound. The PS3 couldn't even stand Jill's voice."
,paulliverpool8,2012-02-19T11:36Z,"it only seems like adam sandler was  bored one night and wanted to make a few more million.


i love every adam sandler, but this one i laugh the least, give it a watch, you
ll prababloy laugh more after the film moe during the film because in disbelif he made this"
,zakimar,2012-02-19T14:05Z,Sandler isn't capable of making a funny movie.
,derrrface,2012-02-19T19:46Z,WTF was Al Pacino thinking when he agreed to be in this pile o shit? 
,derrrface,2012-02-19T19:54Z,I lost whatever respect I had or Al Pacino.

,leftdeffer,2012-02-28T22:21Z,"Hollywood needs to produce a certain amount of movies to meet a quota for the theaters. No movies means nobody goes to the theaters. So to fill seats, they pump out 'formulaic' movies every year. You get your 'romantic comedies', your 'war movies', etc.. 
And then you get shit like this. Adam Sandler will continue to make movies unless someone stops him. *NOTICE*: He must be stopped! Please, someone tell him that his movies are truly horrible. Anyone!"
,leftdeffer,2012-02-28T22:26Z,Adam Sandler in drag...enjoy your movie.
,Rush,2012-03-01T00:15Z,"@derrrface... X2... Pacino has made a few of these pieces of shit in the past decade or so... Someone of his stature in hollywood and his brilliant past films Heat, Godfather I,II, Scarface, Dog Day Aftenoon etc. 

And we get this  ? ... Pacino should either retire or fire his agent... cause he ain't going to go out on top like this..."
,Rush,2012-03-01T00:25Z,"@cryskonig ... LMAO... The British can have a weird sense of humor not to mention their fucked up laws on freedom of speech etc. 
I was arguing with some Brit on a blog that talked about how you could get locked up there for saying shit which is perfectly fine here !!! Really? than Britain sucks... period

,Rush,2012-03-01T00:28Z,I wasted bandwidth on this POS? should have known... Sandler sucks... At least I didn't burn 29cent coaster.

,tiz2,2012-03-04T20:54Z,"Making a ""playing-a-dude-and-a chick-in-the-same-movie""- movie is the saddest thing a comedian can do. The only person in history to star in one of those with some credibility was Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie in 1982. I guess it takes a classically trained actor to pull it off, because every time a comedian does it it's just oh... so sad. "

,koltbolt,2012-03-20T13:23Z,"leftdeffer - yes he does make really bad movies. But ""punch drunk love"" shows he can be used with skill and brilliance. It's a shame there just isn't enough money to support good writers and directors. If HOLLYWOOD could just pay thes ""actors a few million dollars less per movie' they could put the money into funding more writers to put these overpaid actors to work. Perhaps we would go back to seing the movies at the cinema.     "
,tiz2,2012-03-22T01:13Z,"@[deleted]: ... Martin Lawrence, The Wayans Brothers, Arsenio Hall... The list is way too long for a concept that should never have been. Mrs. Doubtfire was (awful) the same concept, dude pretending to be a chick, not a dude playing a chick. Eddie Murphy hasn't actually made a movie like this, but has played a male and female character in at least 3 movies, and is the only one mentioned to appear as both in the same scene :P"
