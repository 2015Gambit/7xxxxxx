World Soccer is an English language football magazine published by IPC Media. It specialises in the international football scene. Its regular contributing writers include Brian Glanville, Sid Lowe and Tim Vickery. World Soccer is a member of the European Sports Magazines (ESM), an umbrella group of similar magazines printed in other languages. Other members include A Bola, Don BalÃ³n, Kicker, La Gazzetta dello Sport and Sport Express. The members of this group elect a European "Team of the Month", and a European "Team of the Year".
Since 1982 World Soccer has also organised "Player of the Year", "Manager of the Year", and "Team of the Year" awards. In 2005 awards for the best "Young Player of the Year" and "Referee of the Year" were also introduced. In the December 1999 issue of World Soccer, a readers' poll listing the 100 greatest football players of the 20th century was published.
The magazine marked its 50th anniversary in 2010 with a series of articles looking back on the past 50 years in international soccer.
