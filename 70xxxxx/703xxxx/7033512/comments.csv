,popeye013,2012-02-16T12:20Z,I thought it would be up by now yes... S4A? 
,tattood_downloader,2012-02-16T13:09Z,anyone know when the fights and the prelims will be uploaded? thanks
,popeye013,2012-02-16T13:31Z,"We all want to know, and are waiting for them, but its not up on any torrent site, not the ones ive searched for anyway.. "
,friendly_donkey,2012-02-16T14:35Z,"What's going on?? I can't check the web to find out, because I'll end up knowing who won. I want to see Peewee Herman fight!

It's absolutely nowhere. I wonder if something happened?

Very unusual."
,The2nduck,2012-02-16T14:38Z,yea sup guys  same here getting reastless
,friendly_donkey,2012-02-16T14:46Z,"I find it strange that no individual has uploaded it either. Demonoid uploaders usually on top of it. I mean, someone must have recorded it."
,popeye013,2012-02-16T15:53Z,"PeeWee Herman?!! He fought? Against who.. A blow up doll? 

The prelims are up, but its so odd that the actual event isnt up, and not anywhere on the net, ive looked at so many sites for it and not one of them have it.
I'll just keep checking back in hope.."
