,garycarradine,2012-02-15T15:47Z,c'mon people seed please
,squirp,2012-02-15T15:56Z,"I was wondering if Suspicion could be reseeded? There are about 16 of us stuck at 88.4% for the last 4 days.

These are fantastic films. Fills and important gap in downloadables. Thanks!"
,famemon78,2012-02-15T16:10Z,just wanted to say a big thank you for making these otherwise impossible flicks available to us!.. and also to request if you re not sticking to any particular order would you mind uploading as many 'Criterion' dvd-r's as possible.. im an avid collector and u seem to have a lot of them in your collection :) .. other than Kurosawa which most people already have.. thanks a million once again!

Suspicion is seeding right nowâ&#x20AC;Ś thanks for the update."
[T],Auge,2012-02-15T16:36Z,"famemon78,
Yes, Criterion is one of four lists I go off to fill my collection . . . so I have a few . . . LOL.
I do not have an order that I am following, what I am trying to do is keep a good mix going, not to many foreign films or to many silent films . . . tc.
I do respond well to request, just ask garycarradine, this torrent is his second one I posted for him."
[T],Auge,2012-02-15T16:37Z,"garycarradine,
