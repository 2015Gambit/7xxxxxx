thx guys

Video Encode:
DVD had great quality so i could make a very nice video. Added brightness, sharpness, rgb and denoise.
Also slightly adjusted contrast to let you see more in the darkness.

Audio Encode:
Took sicÂ´s full line, cleaned all kind of noise issues till it got very clear. Fixed around 10 oos spots.
Noticed that the first 2 mins is a different line than the rest of the movie, also loudness wasnt constant
for both lines, fixed levels. Both lines sounded totally different, fixed that as good as possible.
Took the russian audiotrack and cleaned out all kind of russian voices - were a lot in this movie.
Entered the line back into the russian track and "bang" sounds retailish now.
And all the nice sourround effects are now inside, which gives the movie the extra kick.
Also added full subs in /subs dir for the ones who need it.

got very very nice, check sample
will do perfectly till the bluray comes around.
enjoy
