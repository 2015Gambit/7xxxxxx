Release Notes
==========================================================================

"The glow of Armin van Buuren's 'Mirage' album is bright as ever. With
new single 'Orbion', he shines a new light on the power and impact of
instrumental tracks. A real future classic.

Earning the golden status in several countries saw Armin van Buuren's
fourth artist album setting forth much more than just hits. Each of its
singles have moved the masses, from the emotional 'Not Giving Up On
Love' and energetic 'Drowning' to the hard-rocking 'Full Focus' and
seductive 'Feels So Good'. 'Orbion' is one of the jewels of this
masterpiece . Once it's captured you, you'll find yourself taken on a
trip, deep into captivating trance sounds. Uplifting with a dark sense.
'Orbion' is a great example of the traditional, characteristic Armin
sound, combined with today's influences.

On remix duties, New York producer Eco brings us an all-shattering,
uplifting mix that combines an electrifying melody with a solid, deep
beat. Shining an extra light on the angelic backing-vocals of 'Orbion',
makes the break of his remix a real highlight moment. If you're looking
for a more prog-trancy translation, get lost into the melodic maze of
the Max Graham vs Protoculture remix. A powerful addition to the
original!"
