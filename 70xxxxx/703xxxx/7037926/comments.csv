[T],theburningbush,2012-02-18T07:44Z,"Re: CWKO for 2012-02-17:

Because of other commitments, I missed the original, live airing of this program at 5PM my time, as well as the 8PM repeat. I was going to snarf the 11PM repeat, but according to http://current.com/schedule/ , the 02-17 program was / will be shown no more than two times (the two times I already missed).

So, until such time as my alternate source makes this program available, I will not be posting the 02-17 program. Don't hold your breath; that alternate source has not yet posted the 02-16 program, much less the 02-17 program.

Sorry, everyone. If I'd known in advance that Current was going to broadcast the 02-17 program only twice, I would have made more of an effort to capture it."
