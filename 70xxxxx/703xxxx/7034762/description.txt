PLOT: When Cora is savagely murdered with a hatchet, the extraordinary remark she made the previous day at her brother Richardâ€™s funeral suddenly takes on a chilling significance.

At the reading of Richardâ€™s will, Cora was clearly heard to say: â€˜Itâ€™s been hushed up very nicely, hasnâ€™t itâ€¦But he was murdered, wasnâ€™t he?â€™

In desperation, the family solicitor turns to Hercule Poirot to unravel the mystery.
