  Sydney, 2009. At the end of an unusually hot summer three terrifying  
  shark attacks in as many weeks caused a wave of panic to sweep        
  through Australia's biggest city. Not since the summer of 1963, when  
  a thirty-two-year-old actress lost her life to a vicious shark        
  attack in knee-deep water, had Sydney been gripped by such            
  collective fear.                                                      
                                                                        
  Shark Harbour follows a specialist 'Shark Research Team' -            
  commissioned by the NSW government in response to the surge in        
  attacks - as they conduct the most comprehensive and technologically  
  advanced study of sharks that's ever been undertaken in Australia.    
  Led by marine biologists and shark experts, Dr Amy Smoothey and       
  Professor Vic Peddemors, they want to know if - in a city of nearly   
  four and a half million people, surrounded by much loved and used     
  waterways - sharks and humans can safely co-exist.                    
                                                                        
  To find out if the public face an increasing threat the research      
  team target the three most dangerous shark species known to humans -  
  Great White Sharks, Tiger Sharks and Bull Sharks. They want to        
  discover how sharks use the harbour and if there are any danger       
  'hot-spots' of shark activity.                                        
                                                                        
  Fishing for these predators in Sydney Harbour the team capture, tag   
  and release twenty-five bull sharks, on each occasion lifting them    
  out of the deep with their bare hands. Fitting the sharks with        
  internal tags, they release then follow the predator's movements      
  through the city's waterways by use of an extensive underwater        
  surveillance system.
