Like many of MÃ©liÃ¨s's films, A Trip to the Moon was sold in both black-and-white and hand-colored versions. A hand-colored print, the only one known to survive, was rediscovered in 1993 by the Filmoteca de Catalunya. It was in a state of almost total decomposition, but a frame-by-frame restoration was launched in 1999 and completed in 2010 at the Technicolor Lab of Los Angeles. The restored version finally premiered on May 11, 2011, eighteen years after its discovery and 109 years its original release, at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, with a new soundtrack by the French band Air.
