,reviv3r,2012-02-19T20:43Z,"For those of you with save issues (everyone) 

1) Open Finder, go to the Applications folder, right click on ""GTA Vice City"" and select ""Show Package Contents"".

2) Inside the package, navigate to Contents and then Resources.

3) DELETE user.reg and userdef.reg

4) Run the game and you'll be able to save with no issue"

,clo39,2012-09-30T03:39Z,"Doesn't seem to be working on macbook pro mid 2009 10.8.2. I went into Security and Privacy Settings and changed it Allow applications from anywhere, and no luck. When I launch the game a window dosen't even show up, I just get the menu at the top. Anyone else using this successfully on 10.8.2?"
