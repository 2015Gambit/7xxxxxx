RELEASE iNFOS

Registry Workshop is an advanced registry editor. It is a perfect
replacement for RegEdit and RegEdt32 which shipped with
Windows.

In addition to all the standard features, Registry Workshop adds
a variety of powerful features that allow you to work faster and
more efficiently with registry related tasks.

With Registry Workshop, registry editing becomes more safe than
ever before. All changes except changing key permissions can be
safely reversed (even registry replacing and importing), using
multiple levels of Undo. You don't need to worry about making
mistakes when editing registry.

Whether you are an advanced user who needs to edit and modify
your registry to remove trojan, virus, and spyware entries, a
system administrator who needs a safer, more efficient tool to
maintain your company's PCs, or a software developer who needs
to quickly manipulate registry keys and values during system
development, Registry Workshop has the tools that you need.

iNSTALL NOTES

1. Install Registry Workshop 4.5.0.
2. Use this keygen to make a valid serial for your name.
3. Have fun ;)

ABOUT GROUP

The FiGHTiNG FOR FUN team is proud to announce that we are
the first French web group still alive with more than 11.000
releases now.
Born in april 2002, we are the coolest team of the Scene and
we always fight for more knowledge and fun. Thanks for using
our products, and see you for our 15.000th release :)

Our greetings go to all people we know and who support us.

FFF is proud to be a web group and to release nice products
for all.

FFF is powered by the B.M.E (Bonobos Monkey Engine).

If you want to join in, find in meditation the way to us and
ask for a trial membership.

FFF will not be responsible for and does NOT support warez
distribution of this release. It is forbidden to include
one of our releases in a warez distribution.
Groups or individuals will be exposed for this!

As decided by FFF council

Special note:

On some antivirus scans, FFF releases packages can reveal
"Type_Win32" or "Trojan_Type" virus...
Don't be stupid! It is not a virus nor anything else like
that. It is just some packers/cryptors which have the
same binary signature.

However, some crackhosts can modify or add malicious
things on FFF releases (like "crack.exe"), so please,
TAKE CARE.

Remember:
We are cool but we don't need newbies or pretentious people.
