,GNelson56,2012-02-16T00:43Z,Please seed this.  This is a great tool and I really need this to fix a PC I have in the shop.
,GNelson56,2012-02-16T00:53Z,"If you have an older copy (MRI 5.5.1 or something close to it), open the .iso with MagicIso and find the MRI.exe from this torrent, then just drag and drop it into MagicIso and it'll replace the old one, then it works freaking great!"
,Poohy12,2012-02-16T02:11Z,@GNelson56 it may work but you wont have some of the new tools i also have 5.5 and 5.6 and it has plenty of new features and tools that wont be able to use if you do as you stated.
,GNelson56,2012-02-16T06:19Z,@Poohy12 What else comes with it?  I saw a new update in the usual six updates it usually does.  I still have 5.5.1.  And has anyone gotten past 94.4 percent yet?

[H],BigNoise,2012-03-25T12:25Z,"here is the original bootable iso disk:
https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7105811/

this torrent won't finish ever, because some files were modified by running the software locally from the created folder, and can't be restored that way.
It was a bad idea to extract the ISO anyway."
,its_late,2012-03-27T21:01Z,I don't understand why so many people are still trying to download this torrent?  Its broken. I uploaded a 100% working copy.  Bignoise posted the correct link.
