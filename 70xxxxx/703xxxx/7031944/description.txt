This is a Blu-Ray disc of my 6-part YouTube series, "How Evolution Is Scientific," on the scientific basis for evolution, refuting lies from creationists.

This disc contains full 720p-resolution versions of all six videos, and includes English subtitles. It also includes other freely-available videos referenced in the series, including three from cdk007, a video I made about Piltdown Man, and the clip of students doing a rather stupid protest of evolution.

This disc is small enough to burn to a standard single-layer DVD-R, and should play fine in any Blu-Ray player.

There is also a DVD version here: thepiratebay.org/torrent/4797482
