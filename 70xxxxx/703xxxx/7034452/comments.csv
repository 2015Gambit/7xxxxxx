Why do all the losers like Rourke, Rivers, Walters... go to the same plastic surgeon that makes people look like a clown?"

,extremeBONE,2012-02-17T22:58Z,"If people bothered 2 leave quality ratings i would have avoided this one. Picture is pixelated (700mb rip oi know) and sound is terrible during action scenes. Its so bad it will probably blow your speakers. This is more akin 2 that bad line audio rip that was doing the rounds. I appreciate the up but what is the story with this. Its supposed 2 be a br rip 
V=7  A=-8"
,swinburne,2012-02-18T16:14Z,"the sound is the same as the previous rips, which means its bad. i dont why its taking soo long for a good rip to be released....no dis-respect for the uploader..but this is a failed attempt."
