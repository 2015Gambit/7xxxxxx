PLOT:
Rocket Power involves the daily situations of a group of best friends named Oswald "Otto" Rocket, Regina "Reggie" Rocket, Maurice "Twister" Rodriguez, and Sam "Squid" Dullard, as they live in the fictional town of Ocean Shores, California.

DESCRIPTION:
I DID NOT RIP THESE MYSELF. This is just an organized, properly labeled and split version of the only torrent I could find for Rocket Power.

Episodes vary in quality and file type: AVI, MOV, MPG, MP4.
Several episodes are missing, and I have no idea where to find them. Sorry.

EPISODE LIST:
When aired on TV, each episode, with the exception of:

.....S03E15 Reggie's Big (Beach) Break
.....S03E16 A Rocket X-Mas
.....S03E21 Twist of Fate

was split into two 11-minute stories. For organizational purposes, these files have been split the same way.

So in the torrent, rather than having one file for each episode, they've been split into the two separate stories. This is because some were missing the first or second story of an episode, and I had to figure out which ones those were.

EXAMPLE:
An episode listed on Wikipedia like this:
Season 1 - Episode 1 - "New Squid on the Block/Down the Drain"

Will instead be separated and labeled like this:
S01E01 A - New Squid on the Block.avi
S01E01 B - Down the Drain.avi

If you have any of the missing episodes, OR any of the included episodes in better quality, feel free to upload them - the only reason why I've uploaded a torrent in such condition is because NO ONE ELSE HAS.
So please, make a contribution - and if you don't have anything to add, at least seed!
Comments are welcome. Re-uploaded because I lost access to my profile - thank you to the SuprBay team for helping me out with the recovery!
