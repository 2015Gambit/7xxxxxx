,mountainlion2012,2012-02-23T23:41Z,"hey @inspiron i do kinda agree with the guy in the last post, i have to merge the tracks to make a podcast for my iPhone.
but i have a fix what about uploading a the split files and the last file being a un-split one. if someone wants only the un-split one they can uncheck all others and vise versa. be great if you did but ok if you didn't as well"
,mountainlion2012,2012-02-23T23:43Z,also is there a way to get Trance World vol. 1-14 in a torrent? none of the ones i have found work except 12 and 11.
