,s0rds,2012-02-17T23:53Z,"wow 3.0 at IMDB, don't remember seeing a rating that low, of course there are lower ones, but randomly looking for ratings and seeing a 3 has to be the lowest in my experience.  Not enough time in the day to watch a garbage movie"

Not only is this the worst Adam Sandler movie ever, this is quite possibly the worst movie period!  I literally only laughed once, and it was only mild amusement.

Don't waste your time watching this crap!"
