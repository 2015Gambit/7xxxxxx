What do mean with?

Use the serial from the serial box and register for free. That's THE crack"
,Jero2000,2012-02-16T14:31Z,"This doesn't need a serial or crack, if it's the real deal (haven't tested it). Apple didn't have any copy protection or serials on the iWork (or iLife, or Mac OS X) DVDs.

There used to be an iWork â€™09 download version before there was the Mac App Store, and THAT version needed a serial. 

But, what I really want to know: why would you want to download something from an ANONYMOUS uploaded, when the same this is already up here DOZENS of times, including from trusted sources like this one here:
