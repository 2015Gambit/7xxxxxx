In this project we, fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewel case. Well, you all know the drill :)

Ripped by Exact Audio Copy V0.99 from 01-23-2008, encoded to FLAC with 1024kb/s

Please feel free to join the TQMP project!
The "rules" are simple: Rip your CD (no 1980's cassette tapes or vinyl rips please!) in lossless format AND include artwork. Include cue- and logfiles for the purists and the TQMP search tag in your title, so it can easily be found. (Yes, on Google as well..)
