Here is a complete rip of the DVD for Season 1 of Mister Ed. All files are in MKV format and include English subtitles.

The first 5 episodes had an alternate audio track which were all a continuous sound bite for an interview on Stu's Show. I have extracted and merged all the files into one mp3 file. Really strange that they did it that way. You would have to start the first 5 episodes and select the 2nd audio track each time to hear the whole thing.

These are different file sizes because they were encoded for quality not bitrate. Grainier episodes tend to have higher file sizes.
