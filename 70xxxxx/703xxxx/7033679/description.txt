11.12.  TRIP HOP & POST TRIP HOP MUSIC

         Trip hop  is a music genre consisting of downtempo electronic music which originated in the early 1990s in the UK, especially Bristol. Deriving from "post"-acid house, the term was first used by the British music media and press as a way to describe the more experimental variant of breakbeat which contained influences of soul, funk and jazz.  Musically, trip hop contains a slow tempo and a hypnotic sound created by an electronic background and prominent string instrumentation. Several trip hop artists and bands, such as Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead and Morcheeba have received attention and/or chart success, both on mainstream national charts and on the more dance and indie-based ones.
        After the success of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky albums in 1994 and 1995, a new generation of trip hop artists emerged with a more standardized sound. Notable "post-trip-hop" artists include Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto. They integrated trip hop with other genres â€“ including ambient, R&B/soul, IDM, experimental industrial, atmospheric drum n bass/jungle, liquid dubstep, breakbeat, drum 'n' bass, acid jazz, and new age.
