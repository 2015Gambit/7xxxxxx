Synchronicity is the fifth and final studio album by The Police, released in 1983. The bands most popular 
release, Synchronicity includes the hit songs "Every Breath You Take" "King of Pain" 
"Wrapped Around Your Finger" and "Synchronicity II".

The album's title was inspired by Arthur Koestler's The Roots of Coincidence, which mentions Carl Jungs 
theory of synchronicity. Sting was an avid reader of Koestler, and also named Ghost in the Machine after 
one of his works.

The album marked a significant reduction in the reggae influences that were a part of the band's first 
four records, instead featuring production-heavy textures and liberal use of synthesizers that, at times, 
drove entire songs ("Synchronicity I" "Wrapped Around Your Finger") The influence of World music can also 
be heard in songs such as "Tea in the Sahara" and "Walking in Your Footsteps".

As with their prior album, the basic tracks for Synchronicity were recorded at AIR Studios, Montserrat. For 
sound engineering reasons, the three band members recorded their parts in separate rooms: Copeland with his 
drums in the dining room, Sting in the control room, and Summers in the actual studio. According to 
co-producer Hugh Padgham, subsequent overdubs were done with only one member in the studio at a time.
