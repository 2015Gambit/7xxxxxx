Details:

The fourth album from song craftsmen Olin and the Moon shows their maturity across many fronts. David LaBrel's production has certainly matured, with bright tones and massive orchestrations that have not been previously seen on Olin and the Moon records. The songs are brooding melodies about love and life, good times and bad, and the consistent drive to move on to the next town that all troubadours share.
