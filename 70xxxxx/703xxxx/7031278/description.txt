A Monster in Paris (French: Un monstre Ã  Paris) is a French CGI and 3D animated feature directed by Bibo 

Bergeron. The film became a critical and commercial success in its native France and internationally as well.


* Plot :

The story begins by documenting the Seine flood of 1910.

Set in Paris. Emile, a shy projectionist, has a passion for film and romantic interests for his collaborator of the cinema, Maud, but has trouble admitting his true feelings. His friend, an exuberant inventor and delivery driver, Raoul, is picking him up from work to transport him in his crafted vehicle, named Catherine, to assist in retrieving a new belt for his projector, due to a mishap with him daydreaming. In the process of purchasing a new belt, he also gets himself a new camera. The story also introduces Lucille (Vanessa Paradis), a childhood friend of Raoul, and cabaret singer at the club L'Oiseau Rare (The Rare Bird). As Paris is diverse in the category of the rich and the poor, though she is a successful singer, her Aunt does everything to push her into the arms of Chief of Police, Maynott, a man devoured by pride and ambition of himself.

On a particular evening, Raoul, accompanied by Emile, are making a delivery to the Botanical Gardens. In absence of the Professor who works there, the place is guarded by his assistant, a proboscis monkey named Charles. 
Appreciating the opportunity to browse through the laboratory, Raoul accidentally triggers a mixture which gives Charles a voice of opera singer and a unstable fertilizer which grows a sunflower in the blink of an eye. Due to the enormity of the plant in small water, it starts to topple towards Raoul and Emile. In the ensuing chaos, a explosion occurs due to the breaking of the chemicals. Everyone comes out unscathed, but 
Emile is convinced he has glimpsed a monstrous creature which is recorded on camera. A few days later, the creature is featured in the newspapers.
