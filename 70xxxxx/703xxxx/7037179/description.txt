What better way to celebrate The BRIT Awards 2012 with MasterCard than with the official BRIT Awards 2012 compilation album? This year's enormous collection includes 42 tracks from all the nominees - plus a few of last year's greatest pop talents who didn't quite make the nominations shortlist - as well as a very special bonus disc.

The album will hit shelves on 13 February, so you'll be familiar with all the tracks ahead of the 2012 BRIT Awards on the 21 February.

From Adele's live performance of 'Someone Like You' at the 2011 BRIT Awards to the club beats of Chase & Status' 'Blind Faith' and the moody pop soul of Lana Del Rey's 'Video Games', the album brings together the best tracks of the past 12 months across two amazing discs.

But that's not all - the third disc in the collection contains 19 tracks from winners of the Outstanding Contribution to Music award, including this year's winners, Blur. Other legendary artists on the tracklist include David Bowie, Queen, U2, Elton John, Spice Girls and Pet Shop Boys.
