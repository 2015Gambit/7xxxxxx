From Wikipedia:

Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files is a paranormal investigation television series
produced by Base Productions that began airing July 15, 2010, on SyFy. The show
follows a team of investigators, led by former FBI agent Ben Hansen, who review
various photographs and viral videos (mainly from the internet) of alleged 
paranormal activity. If a particular piece of evidence is deemed intriguing 
enough to warrant further investigation, they set out to recreate and explain 
the sighting.

Beginning in the second-half of season two, the show features a "You Decide" 
segment in the middle of the program where a video is shown of something 
strange and then asks the viewing audience if they think the footage is fact 
or faked. After a commercial break the truth behind the video is revealed.
