,bida_anti_dvd,2012-02-15T01:31Z,"BiDA you have done it again.
Just like the Puss and Boots torrent.

This one does not work on dvd players or the xbox.

I have even changed around the options on convertxtodvd and still nothing.

I have tried it on various dvd players and in a few you get no audio at all, and in the others you get no video or audio just like the xbox 360

I have never experienced this with any other avi or movies I have downloaded

BiDA is doing something tottally different and terribly wrong

I have no clue what it is, but the file comes as an AVI, so everyone please avoid this.

It does work properly with VLC, but once burned, it has many problems

COPY NEGATIVE TEN because of compatibility issues, I am not the only one having this problem

,DaYgon76,2012-02-15T10:41Z,"@bida_anti_dvd
I run all my movies through VirtualDubMob, File,Open --> save as AVI, make sure Direct Stream Copy is chosen and this usually fixes issues related to the sound or picture for me. Sometimes the files have issues with sound latency or syncing, not sure why but who cares if it gets fixed. This works for 99.9% of avi files and only takes about 30-40 secs. I copy it to flash drive and plug directly into dvd and works. Try it if it doesn't work just remember ITS FREE!. Cheers for upload."

wow, what a silly comment. lets take a moment to analyze one of your favourite movies: My Sister's Keeper ""We need lots of bald headed cancer kids, and a bunch of people crying, we can make that stretch out 2 hours can't we? oh whatever it doesn't matter, noone is going to give a movie about dying kids a bad rating, we will make hundreds!!!""

Thanks for the advice, I will give it a try.
I tried what someone else said on BiDA's Puss & Boots torrent, to switch the convertxtodvd options to sif resolution, but it didn't fix the problem, it was still not compatible.
I only use VDub to join two avi files, never heard of VDubMob, but I will try that on VDub.

Everyone elses idiotic comments I will ignore.
I am not complaining, I am informing you guys that BiDA's torrents have audio and compatibility problems"
