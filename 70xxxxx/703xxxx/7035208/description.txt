In celebration of the landmark festival's 40th anniversary, Rhino released Woodstock-40 Years On: Back To Yasgurâ€™s Farm Boxed Set, the most comprehensive collection of Woodstock performances ever. Sequenced in the chronological order in which they occurred, the 77-song, six-CD boxed set contains 38 previously unreleased recordings. After a labor-intensive process of reviewing every inch of multi-track tape, co-producer Andy Zax selected the very best from each of the 33 sets and furthered the collection's authenticity by including stage announcements, set banter, the sounds of rain, a cameo appearance by Abbie Hoffman, and the graciousness of Max Yasgur's address to the crowd, heard for the first time in its entirety.

Hippies, yippies and yuppies flocked to Yasgur's Farm in 1969 in search of music and a good time, but as the big name bands rolled in so did the crowds (a half million people!) - and so it was that a relatively small â€œaquarian expositionâ€ transformed into a counterculture movement that changed rock'n'roll history forever.

Mud, mayhem and music defined the summer of '69 at Yasgur's farm.
A counter-culture convergence, Woodstock's "3 Days of Peace and Music" drew in an unexpected half a million people in the field and an unprecedented lineup of artists on the stage, changing rock 'n' roll history forever.

By Wednesday, August 13, some 60,000 people had already arrived and set up camp. On Friday, the roads were so clogged with cars that performing artists had to arrive by helicopter. Though over 100,000 tickets were sold prior to the festival weekend, they became unnecessary as swarms of people descended on the concert grounds to take part in this historic and peaceful happening. Four days of musicâ€¦ half a million peopleâ€¦ rain, and the rest is history.

Joni Mitchell said, "Woodstock was a spark of beauty" where half-a-million kids "saw that they were part of a greater organism." According to Michael Lang, one of four young men who formed Woodstock Ventures to produce the festival, "That's what means the most to me â€“ the connection to one another felt by all of us who worked on the festival, all those who came to it, and the millions who couldn't be there but were touched by it."
