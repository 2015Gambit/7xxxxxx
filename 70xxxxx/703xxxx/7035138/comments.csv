What does

Origin:JPN/NTSC
Region: Region Free

mean,
Is it RF-PAl aswell?
Thanks 4-all Boobsman..."
,omnipotentidiot,2012-02-16T01:17Z,"@bigcalle it means the source of this rip is NTSC-J, which meant its exclusive to japanese consoles only.This has been converted to region free,so everyone can play it."
,mrnexus,2012-02-16T01:18Z,hi boobsman i know binary domain was released today in japan so is this also region free m8 will it work on my pal xbox---- thks very much for the upload good man :)
[V],boobsman,2012-02-16T01:53Z,"@ bigcalle it means that the source disc was a Jap ntsc/j disc but the game is region free and will work on all consoles. All games that are region free will have an original source most are pal or ntsc/u, this one just happens to be ntsc/j because the game was released in the Japanese region first.

@ omnipotentidiot the game has not been ""converted"", region free is just how the rip comes.

@ mrnexus yes the game is RF so will work on your pal console :)"
,bigcalle,2012-02-16T02:16Z,"Thanks 4 da answers.

,guyyoung29,2012-02-16T14:59Z,if you go on live they will no its a copy cause its not released in your region
,mrnexus,2012-02-16T18:47Z,"i put it through ABGX and it installed  the topology it also confirmed a basic stealth had passed and it was region free etc,but it said verification failed as theres no ini file in the database,then it said autfix failed and stealth still unverified,so my question is when it comes to playing the mulitplayer if i burn this now and play offline not connected to the microsoft servers and then when its relesaed over here will i be safe to go online@boobsman iam asking you m8 as you are very knowledgeable in this area will i be ok or should i wait until feb 24 to patch this through Abgx so i will be safe online,just too add i have a liteon Ihas burner and i use Kprobe to check every xgd3 copy thks ."
,mrnexus,2012-02-16T18:58Z,"@guyyoung29,I would'nt risk it pal because i would think they have xboxlive divided into different parts like euorpe and america  togther and japan and that part of that would together i never have anyone from japan online in mulitplayer in my lobby not that can speak japenese lol."
,rethur,2012-02-16T19:09Z,"I've had multiple disc authorization fails after playing the game for five minutes or so without my internet connected. I injected topology and burned with 2.4x so it's quite unlikely it was a bad burn, but I guess it's a possibility."

,torrentinator69,2012-03-06T17:54Z,"Does anyone know whats going on with a NTSC/US version of Binary domain or a way to convert the existing JAP and what I think is  PAL version to match the crc of the ABGX version? The three version have different checksums and it seems a NTSC US version of Binary Domain was never released. I have tried the imars, caravan, and the RF which is a dupe of the jap release with a password on it. Any help, suggestions or insight would be appreciated."

,XLeech,2012-07-27T11:36Z,"Unfortunately this great game did not work for me either. Ran the .iso through ABGX: Corrupted CRC. ABGX fixed it 100 %. 

Loading game. Set up Xk3y & HDD. 
Message: ""Disk"" is unclean. Clean it with a cloth ( It's an .iso I'm running ).

Too bad though. I would really like to know if there is an other upload or fix for this game."
