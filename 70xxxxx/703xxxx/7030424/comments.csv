I would give the video 3/10 reason?

The CAM set to automatic focus, so if anyone walks in front of the camera used, the camera goes out of focus, making the  movie blurry as hell, and too much darkness makes it out of focus too.

I would give the audio 7/10 reason?

you don't hear any movement from the camera, or any shuffling, hicupping, sneezing. The audio IS in proper stereo, but sometimes it is too loud, and sometimes you cannot hear the dialogue."
