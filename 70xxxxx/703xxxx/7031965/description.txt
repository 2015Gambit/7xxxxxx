NOTES:

Sources:
Russian 1.38gig xvid release .....really nice and very good Q for a R5.
Audio Bida/sic/our cam releaase.....needed all to get this synced and completed the best i could.

Workdone:
First thing no work done on the video as we have the vobs and have our rip awaiting FULL line audio ;-)
This is all about the audio ....first off had to use 51 secs of russian in the intro instead of the 2mins bida used,because our
cam release we had more video so had to sync that,then we used bidas sync ( which came from sic ) ...but as many are finding out
your can\'t remux it straight over or encode the audio as it goes baddly oos ....
Found the issue ...check runtimes,10 secs difference so i had to find the spots were the issues were and correct the audio delay and
then resave.
Once saved it was a case of cleaning the audio in AA changing the EQ bands aswell as using a nosie and hiss removal filter.

Got too say this is a buzz/hum in the audio and have toned it down,but still there ....can almost get rid of it but would have to drop
some of the EQ bands right to nothing and does make it sound a bit flat.
So for now i\'ve reduced the buzz and once we have full line i will then go that little further in it

Enjoy folks
