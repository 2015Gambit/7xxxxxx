Bad Company were an English rock supergroup founded in 1973, consisting of two former Free band members
singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke â€” as well as Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and 
King Crimson bassist Boz Burrell. Peter Grant, who, in years prior, was a key component of fellow British 
rock band Led Zeppelin's rise to fame, managed the band. Bad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 
1970s. Many of their singles, such as "Bad Company" "Can't Get Enough" "Good Lovin' Gone Bad" and 
"Feel Like Makin' Love", retain popularity with rockers of both the past and present decades. To this day, 
their songs remain staples of classic rock radio.
Bad Company is the eponymous debut studio album by hard rock band Bad Company.

The album was recorded at Headley Grange with Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio in November 1973.

The album peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200. Since then the album has sold in excess of five million copies
and has become the 46th best selling album of the 70s. The album spent 25 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, 
entering at #10 and reaching its highest position of #3 in the second week.[6] Kerrang! magazine listed 
the album at No. 40 among the "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time".

The singles "Can't Get Enough" and "Movin' On" peaked at #5 and #19 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. 
"Rock Steady", "Bad Company" and "Ready for Love" (the latter originally recorded by guitarist Mick Ralphs 
during his tenure with Mott the Hoople on All the Young Dudes) are also "classic rock" radio staples.

In 2006 a limited edition CD of 24K Gold was released. It had taken over a year to find the original master
tapes, then the analog masters were put through proprietary A/D converter. Another remaster was previously 
released in 1994.
