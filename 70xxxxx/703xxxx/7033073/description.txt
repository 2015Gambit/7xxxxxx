Credit Kevn Kinney with sheer determination. Twelve years after what appeared to be their final swansong, Kinneyâ€™s rebuilt Drivinâ€™ Nâ€™ Cryinâ€™[/size], abandoning his stalled solo career and reclaiming the branding that anticipated a new surge of Southern sensibilities, affirmed by the likes of the Drive By Truckers and Kings of Leon. If Kinney and company questioned how theyâ€™d retrofit themselves with this renewed regimen, they betray no doubt here. Offering up a decidedly determined set of withering, wailing rockers tackling a modern malaise of downsized jobs, failed promises and the disintegration of the American dream, theyâ€™re as brash and defiant as ever, as gloriously insurgent as any band half their age.

In effect, 'Great American Bubble Factory' serves as a road map for weathering the storm, and with anthemic outbursts like â€œDetroit City,â€ the title track, â€œI Stand Tallâ€ â€œPreapproved, Predeniedâ€ and â€œThe Hardest Part,â€ thereâ€™s enough indictment to go around. Still, itâ€™s the good-natured â€œDonâ€™t You Know Thatâ€ and the rousing â€œGet Around Kidâ€ that show Drivinâ€™ Nâ€™ Cryinâ€™ remains both soaring and sublime.
