,jepp98,2012-02-17T11:33Z,Fake! This torrent doesn't work.
,Toadem,2012-02-17T13:50Z,"@jepp98 I dunno what torrent you downloaded dude but this one certainly does work, rather than yelling fake you might want to try a different player or better yet upload something yourself so that some leaching little pissant like you can come along and yell fake just because their too bloody stupid to play a video file."
,jepp98,2012-02-17T20:55Z,"Toadem- My husband is a software engineer. We downloaded this file on two computers. Both downloads showed ""broken file"" errors. This episode of KN hasn't aired in the states so I should have known it was a fake. I find that name-calling along with an obviously poor grasp of the language is a sure sign of low intellect. Grow up! "
,Toadem,2012-02-17T21:17Z,"Im very glad you said a software engineer and not a self employed software engineer as at this rate he wouldnt get much work... I really dont care where the episode has or has not aired the episode is not fake ... apart from about 15 seconds cropped from the end it is the proper episode .... I can save you trouble of downloading it and just tell you what happens at the end if you like because i watched it this afternoon.
As for me growing up, I really don't think so but if I was you I would post a comment asking if anyone else was having any problems with this file before I went shooting my mouth off yelling fake. People like you dont even deserve to get this stuff for free, but then you feel I should grow up. Maybe I was a bit fast to fly off the handle but people like you really do iritate me. As I said already upload something yourself if you dont bloody like it then sit and listen to whiners like you yelling fake because your too stupid to run a movie file.
One final thing you should take notice of is the fact that this torent has a +4 quality and 183 seeders and yet you are the only person on here complaining of any issues and yelling fake, maybe you should tell your hubby its time to change professions lmao."
,dionysiux,2012-02-17T21:32Z,Jep didnt worked :(
,FKNL,2012-02-17T22:06Z,"AVI indeed seems broken (in WMP), but VLC was able to fix and play it. So to watch it, use VLC Player."
,davisandrew44,2012-02-17T22:09Z,"Jepp98 I am afraid you are wrong this torrent does work.  All you are trying to do is intsill fear into people to download, because you have the wrong video player.  I am afraid you and your husband are idiots.  This video does work."
,FKNL,2012-02-17T23:07Z,"Hmm, the video seems to be cut off too early. It does play, but it's cut before the end."
,outseeker1,2012-02-18T00:32Z,"The original file is 349.69MB, not 333.67MB.
Alba's download obviously stopped before it was complete and was then uploaded here. I will re-up in an hour or so if nobody else has."
[V],AlbaGuBrath,2012-02-18T03:23Z,"Ok this video didnt downlload properly, but i checked it on both WMP and VLC and it played on both so i uploaded it, but yeah it cut off just slightly towards the end!!

Thanks for the comments though everyone!!

But i wanna say a big thanks my local friend Toadem for standing up for me so fiercely :)
