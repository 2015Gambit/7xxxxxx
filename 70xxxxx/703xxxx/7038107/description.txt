Chef Ramsay visits Charlieâ€™s in La Verne, CA to help the owners of the Italian bistro refresh its outdated look and update the menuâ€™s bland and unoriginal options. Displeased by the wishy-washy service, unappetizing dishes and old-fashioned ambiance, Chef Ramsay has his work cut out for him to turn the restaurantâ€™s luck around. Find out if Chef Ramsay can infuse the restaurant with authentic Italian elegance or if the restaurantâ€™s woes are too much for even Chef Ramsay to tackle.

Enjoy!!
