Lucidity is a new world of web series that not only takes place in the astral dream world, but encourages the viewers to learn to lucid dream as well. The show begins with two roommates who share each other's dreams, but they have no control over the phenomenon. As the dream world increasingly encroaches on their real lives, they decide to take action and learn to lucid dream! This new skill not only opens their imagination, but a whole new world just waiting to be explored.
