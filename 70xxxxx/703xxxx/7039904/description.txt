Ok guys, it's a re-up, my previous 2012 january update upload was deficient, but now I finally managed to get all the updates!!! It means, this torrent finally got the Killer Classics set! All these files are .Sims3Pack (decrap) files. Just put them into the Download folder and start the launcher then simply install! Enjoy guys, and don't forget to seed!!
