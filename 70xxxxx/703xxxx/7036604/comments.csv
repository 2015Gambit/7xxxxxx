,whateveryou,2012-02-17T03:55Z,"Oh, right.  I had noticed the request for this plain jane version, but it's not for me.  Thanks!"
,Regimus,2012-02-18T13:59Z,"Very nice and it works like a charm, the framework worked perfect, thanks. Keep on doing what you are doing and a lot of people wants XP because it slowly dies out because of the other new windows who is taking over. Keep on working with XP...
10P from me..."
,greylion,2012-02-26T12:15Z,"One odd thing I'm wondering - why include Java?
I don't use windows much, so right now I can't think of anything that needs it."
,greylion,2012-02-26T12:26Z,"eh, include Java in the corporate edition, I mean - probably should've asked on that page instead."
[T],liluser,2012-03-11T17:09Z,"with this standard version..
if you know how to use RyanVM Integrator and Nlite and DriverPacks BASE
you can add extra silent installs and addons and tweaks..
and driverpacks..
then make your own iso image.."
