,twi666788,2012-02-19T22:12Z,WTF? is this?
,twi666788,2012-02-19T22:13Z,Anthony Michael Hall looks terrible! Christ!
,W105N4,2012-02-20T11:03Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2156825/
Title: Stone"
,DLUL,2012-02-20T20:32Z,"That's actually Sergey Svetlakov not Anthony Michael Hall.

They look the same though.

LOL"
,elitecrusher,2012-02-21T22:31Z,"Hows the freaking movie damit?? Or do you all want to just talk about the weather or a freakin cup of coffey, or how many times u took a shit today!! Dam comment on the movie people instead of running your bananna hammocks about meaningless shit!!"
,cryskonig,2012-02-23T20:21Z,"Well, ""coffey"" is not a word. A banana hammock is a slang term for an undergarment, if spelled correctly, and it's the fucking internet you cunt..... we can talk about whatever we want."
,cryskonig,2012-02-23T20:24Z,"I think you could have used any of these terms instead: cock holster, cock warmer, cum dumpster, soup cooler, trap or yap. "
,Polymathj,2012-02-26T17:24Z,"@cryskonig

Hehe.  Still teaching the new kids about proper grammar when bashing/trolling/commenting.

Always refreshing to know that in the age of anonymous shit-talking, some people still put civility and higher learning first.

You can be wrong... just don't fucking misspell it :)"
,1madchef,2012-02-27T14:25Z,did any one find a trailer for this movie or even a A\V rating i dont wana download if its rubbish :)
,y3n007,2012-02-27T18:53Z,Not even the imdb says what this is about......anyone....is this any good....
,nerdhound,2012-02-29T15:11Z,"I Woke up to a rather lovely day today so my morning coffee tasted sweeter than normal, as one would expect i dare say.

I certainly wasn't seeking pleasure from my first 'evacuation' but i was pleasantly surprised at the ease of it's movement, not to mention the added delight i found in not having to 'cut'.

Pleased with how wonderful the day was going at this point i stopped to ponder ""I Say, Dare i pour myself a nice hot cup of Coffey?""

I did.

It's a good thing."
,nerdhound,2012-03-01T01:03Z,"In addition ...

I have no idea what it's about but

V - 10
A - 10

It's a perfect rip .... of what ever this is.

Looks like some sort of Russian Action Film."
,JOStheFOX,2012-03-04T12:00Z,no subs?
,patolya,2012-03-10T10:38Z,"Preview of this Russian movie can be found on YouTube, code: v=E460fOSqobk"
,Deminted4eveR,2012-03-11T14:33Z,wow just when i thought there were not enough idiots online.. i see there are more
,iamhelix,2012-03-24T07:28Z,anyone have a link to ENG subs for this file?
,Herzen63,2012-04-28T22:44Z,"One, the film was not from 2011, its listed as 2012 on IMDB. Two, it seems like there's barely any information there, which is sad enough. Three, there's hardly any information about this video, and since no A/V or comments are made ABOUT this video then it is safe to assume that I will not download this. "
