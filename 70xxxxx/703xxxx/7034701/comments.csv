,BrokeRobot,2012-02-15T21:26Z,"Seems a little strange, I'm getting the wrong checksum and minor but weird errors. "
,halfchaos,2012-02-15T22:20Z,works fine. thanks for the patch skidrow.
,KKKDownlow,2012-02-15T22:58Z,Game still crashes after the first 10 minutes. Leave it to Paradox to once again create a bug ridden game.
,BrokeRobot,2012-02-15T23:18Z,"KKKDownlow the game is fine, I've played hundreds of years with 0 crashes.  The problem is either you or this torrent, it seems to be ok but the checksum is wrong and the tips that are supposed to be at the bottom of the loading screen have disappeared.   The 1.02b Repack works perfectly, though the installer is in Russian"
