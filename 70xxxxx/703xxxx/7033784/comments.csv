1080p version with Director Commentary please!"

,williamguterres,2012-02-18T01:42Z,"Great release!
The movie is in great quality without sound problems. The only problem is that in some scenes there are rendering issues in key scenes of the movie screen is grainy for a few seconds.

About the film, there is an abortion Greek mythology.

Video = 8
Audio = 7
Movie = 6 

Thanks for seeding!"
,dzver666,2012-02-18T03:14Z,tnx again... probabley a repack would be solution...rcoldks ...any other suggestions would be welcomed.. also if I come across something good will post...
,Revisionist,2012-02-18T22:12Z,i got the 1080 version first and it was unplayable.  It was a horrible encode imo.  Ill be avoiding this one. 
,RWDY19D,2012-02-20T04:18Z,How do you use private trackers?
,Kayel,2012-02-27T09:45Z,"Audio skips every 5 seconds, becomes really annoying!"
,H.E.L.I.X,2012-02-28T06:50Z,"Video is OK, Audio cuts out in sometimes and completely loses sync in other parts. Still watchable though."

,cris11,2012-03-10T19:50Z,"@Shadow416
Downloaded and tested that version.i was amazed for just 1gb and a half it have same hd quality of a matroska file with 8 or 19gb. I use DivX Pro player but that version is lower than what it used to be (A : 5).Maybe i need an additional codec(version) and im using only the 2 normal speakers..
The sound of this version is way much louder , almost double.
i would rate this torrents as quality :
V : 10
A : 9
M : 9

Ty boz for your great quality HDChina"
,T3HPWnEr3R,2012-03-12T16:02Z,Considering this movie isn't officially released until April 3rd. Stop bitching and be glad you can get it early.
,TorrentTimUK,2012-03-15T09:08Z,Thanks
,ozc,2012-07-27T01:57Z,"Shadow416, you're an idiot thinking a 1080p video is going to be any good if it's less than 6 gigabytes. You posted a 1.6gb POS! You people are having issues playing these because your PC's, Codecs, or Players are JUNK and can't handle HD! "
