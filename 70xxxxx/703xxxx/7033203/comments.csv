[V],thetorrentlord,2012-02-15T17:48Z,Thanks for another fine upload! If EZTV can do it why can't the rest of the groups get with the times!  Nice to not have to make hundreds or even thousands waste time un-raring files when the seeder (Un-named groups) could save us all a lot of time. Many thanks to all the uploaders who no longer use RAR files.
