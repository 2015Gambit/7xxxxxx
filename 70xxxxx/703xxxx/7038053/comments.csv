Way to go Fuckers!
Thanks for the upload!"
,Toby196,2012-02-17T05:31Z,"Thanks again, eztv.  Another great show, and another great upload."
,Sinsults,2012-02-17T17:08Z,"All these ignorant comments about the Archer episodes being numbered incorrectly make me laugh.
The three part special was a SPECIAL, not part of season three.
Therefore, they don't factor in to the numbering of season three.
If you still can't understand that, go stand in front of a train.  You're not smart enough to contribute to society."

,cappy1987,2012-02-19T05:18Z,"Hey Sinsults,

How the fuck is it possible you can be such a ra-tard?

""It was announced on March 29, 2011 that Archer was renewed for 16 episodes. The first three episodes began on September 15, 2011[9][24] as a ""Special Assignment"" mini-arc concluding season two's cliffhanger.""

And again:

""It was announced on March 29, 2011 that Archer was renewed for 16 episodes. The remaining thirteen episodes of season three to air in early 2012.[27]""

Wikipedia don't lie, bitches.  If I knew how to make those numbers in brackets small, blue, superscripted links, they would be.  Feel free to check where they point to for real.  It checks out.

Seriously, dude, you just suck so much.  I don't know how else to put it.  Ooh, I got it.  Someone as dumb as you, as wrong as you and as unjustly annoyed at other people as you doesn't come around every day.  You're special.

I just got an account on piratebay exclusively for the sake of deriding your obscenely stupid comment.  Hope you feel honored."
,Alucinor,2012-02-19T23:43Z,"Hey Cappy,

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Archer_episodes
""It was announced on March 29, 2011 that Archer was renewed for 16 episodes. The remaining thirteen episodes of season three to air in early 2012.[27]""

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_%28TV_series%29

""On March 29, 2011 it was announced that FX Network had ordered a 16-episode third season of Archer.[7] A three episode special dubbed ""The Heart of Archness"" was aired in September 2011. New episodes from season 3 began airing on January 19, 2012.[7]""

It's almost as if Wikipedia isn't internally consistent, and therefore shouldn't be treated as an authoritative source!

Go to the Archer Official Website at http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/archer/episode.php?season=3 and you'll see that Season 3 episode 1 was ""The Man from Jupiter"".  Strangely, the Heart of Archness arc isn't listed there anywhere.

,whysee2,2012-02-22T18:24Z,"I had to register just to comment. @cappy1987 ""Wikipedia don't lie, bitches."" Seriously?? I think you need to do some research and see where Wikipedia gets there info., and anybody who actually types out ""Ra-tard""... well...probably is one themselves.
@Alucinor thanks for the clarification."
,Foxie10,2012-02-24T23:46Z,"Great show though right?!?!  Too funny, fuck the numbering just enjoy, but no thinking about whore island or becoming a pirate king!!! LOL Thanks for sharing this excellent cartoon  :o)"
,cappy1987,2012-03-10T21:22Z,"whysee2: No, I wasn't serious about Wikipedia always telling the truth.  That was said tongue in cheek.  However, I *did* do some research to see where Wikipedia gets theIR info.  It's not that hard, it's actually cited right on the friggin page in the footnotes.  Also, what's so wrong with typing out ra-tard?  I was just trying to be funny, gosh, calm down.

Alucinor: Just about everywhere I've seen is listing Heart of Archness as part of season 3, although your FX website note is interesting.  Still, I would bet a lot of money that it'll be part of season 3 when the DVDs come out.  Time will tell, but I'm pretty sure I'm right."
