In early 1956, Bing Crosby ended the two long-term company affiliations that had defined his career for more than 20 years 
leaving his exclusive associations with Paramount Pictures and Decca Records. Thereafter, he made movies and records on a 
freelance basis. The immediate results were more felicitous for his film work than his recording, as he went to MGM for 
the successful movie High Society. As a recording artist, in rapid succession he cut the movie soundtrack for Capitol 
(January-February) a new album for Decca, Songs I Wish I Had Sung (The First Time Around) (April) and a new album for 
Verve, Bing Sings Whilst Bregman Swings (June). The third was the least likely. Twenty-five-year-old Buddy Bregman, a 
friend of Crosby's son Gary, had recently been appointed an A&R executive at the fledgling Verve. His idea for Crosby 
was to copy the formula of recent Nelson Riddle-arranged Frank Sinatra successes such as Songs for Swingin' Lovers
take a collection of inter-war standards and give them punchy big-band arrangements. The approach was well-suited to the 
aggressive Sinatra, who wasn't shy about editing the arrangements himself, but singularly inappropriate to the affable 
Crosby, who left everything to his arranger/conductor. The 12 songs, none of which Crosby had released commercially before, 
were great standards from the likes of Kern, Rodgers and Hart, Berlin, and Gershwin, and Crosby turned in typically witty 
interpretations. But Bregman's repetitive, overly busy arrangements, full of loud, sudden horn blats and splats, forced 
the singer to compete for attention and occasionally smothered him completely. Crosby was looking for a way back to 
commercial appeal with this experiment. But the three albums were all released within a period of weeks in August and 
September, and only the film soundtrack got a fair hearing and became a hit.
