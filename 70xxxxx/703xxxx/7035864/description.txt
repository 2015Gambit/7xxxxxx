        Fame and Fortune can never eclipse true love...

        When  Crystal Wyatt  was sixteen,  her beloved  father passed
        away. From that point on her life would never be the same.

        Abused by her mother  and blamed for her  brother's accidental
        death, Crystal is banished from the family ranch she cherishes
        so much.

        Left with no money, the beautiful Crystal starts a new life as
        a singer in a San  Francisco nightclub. There she is  reunited
        with her one true childhood love, Spencer Hill, who is engaged
        to another woman.

        They profess their love for  each other but realise they  must
        go  their  separate  ways.  After  years  of  hard  work   and
        perseverance, Crystal's  incredible talent  wins her  fame and
        fortune, but the  love of millions  of adoring fans  can never
        replace  the  love  from  Spencer  Hill,  for  which  she   so
        desperately yearns.

        Will she  be reunited  with her  one true  love? Will she ever
        return to her cherished childhood home? More than a decade  of
        triumphs and tragedies pass  as Crystal Wyatt learns  the high
        price of fame.
