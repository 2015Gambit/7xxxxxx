files when the seeder (Un-named groups) could save us all a lot of time. Many thanks to all the uploaders 

who no longer use RAR files.   If this group can do it why can't the rest?  Once again thanks!"

Is there a de-facto site for downloading subtitles? i use tvsubtitles.net, but it does not always have DIMENSION subs."
