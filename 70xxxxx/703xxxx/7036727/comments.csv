,elitecrusher,2012-02-18T03:19Z,Seems like my dvd player only plays XVID videos and the manual makes it difficult to see all the readable formats. I wonder if it will play burnt movies that are blue ray rips??? I have one of those dvd players that enhances your movies to hq or whatever! Any help is appreciated???
