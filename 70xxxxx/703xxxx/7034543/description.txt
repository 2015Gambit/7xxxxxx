+++ BOOTLEG - EXTREMELY RARE +++

You will never and nowhere else get this document, except here!
This is a private live recording of a concert performed on March 8, 
1969. 

Unfortunately the technical quality is rather poor in some passages,
and from time to time ambient noises come distractingly to fore, but
that's Live, and that's 1969.

Apart from these inconveniences you are going to experience one of the
best interpretations of Mahler's 3rd ever. The 6th set truely is a
revelation that will leave you in a state of trance, completely 
enthralled by pure feelings. To my opinion no other conductor ever 
reached this level of empathy with this, Mahler's unique declaration of 
heavenly love.
