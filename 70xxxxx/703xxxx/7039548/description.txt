Everything is a Remix is a four-part video series about influence and appropriation in creation. It delves into the ideas of copying and derivative works and shows how everyone in film and music industry copies creative works.

I have taken the time to combine all four parts into a single 34 minute documentary. It's available as a single 720p XVID/MP3 file.

It really is a fantastic documentary that everyone should watch.
