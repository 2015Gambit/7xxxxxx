Here is a complete rip of the DVD for Season 1 of Mister Ed. All files are in MKV format and include English subtitles. The first episode has 2 audio tracks, 1 for commentary.

These episodes were not all transferred to DVD in the same manner. I found some episodes at a film framerate of 23.976 while others were telecined at a variable frame rate. They have all been encoded properly to smooth out combing artifacts and jerkiness. An "F" next to the episode means it is at 23.976 FPS while a "V" means it has a variable frame rate and may have syncing issues if playing it on something other than a computer.

I plan to upload all episodes eventually, one season at a time.
