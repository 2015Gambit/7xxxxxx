        That one nightmare evening threatens a lifetime of dreams.

        The year is  1912. The evening  is a glamorous  one aboard the
        luxurious Titanic. A  close-knit family, the  Winfields, toast
        the engagement  of daughter  Edwina, and  celebrates the sixth
        birthday of her sister Alexis. But as the evening ends, terror
        takes over when  the ship crashes  into an iceberg  and slowly
        sinks.

        The shattered family counts their parents and Edwina's  fiance
        among the dead. Being the oldest,  it is up to Edwina to  take
        charge. She becomes  the sole support  to her sibblings  while
        working day and night to save her family's crumbling newspaper
        empire. For 12  years Edwina puts  her romantic life  on hold,
        expending  all the  energy she  possesses to  keep her  family
        together.

        But  on  a trip  across  the Atlantic,  her  first since  that
        tragicnight, Edwina discovers she  can no longer keep  romance
        at  bay. She  has an  affair with  a handsome  Englishman who
        teaches her  how to  love again.  Finally free  from the past,
        Edwina returns to America,  falling in love with  a theatrical
        producer.
