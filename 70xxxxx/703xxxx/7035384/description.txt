Haunted: Ghost Stories [x40] ( Complete ) DVD Rip

Ghost Stories is an American horror anthology television series that ran from 1997 to 1998 on the cable channel FOX Family.

The show was narrated by Rip Torn and originally two episodes were presented back to back in an hour-long segment. However, towards the end of the series it was broken down into 30 minute episodes with just one story, most featuring a style similar to episodes of The Twilight Zone in which there would be a twist at the end.

The 40-episode set was re-released in a 2-disc keepcase featuring new cover art and bearing the title: Haunted: Ghost Stories; each disc is dual-sided and contains 10 episodes of the series as opposed to 8; presented in a standard DVD case and includes no bonus features.
