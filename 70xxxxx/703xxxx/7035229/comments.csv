Thanks for seeding so good.

,uthacalthing,2012-02-17T11:50Z,"I started downloading six torrents from TPB, including this one, 18 hours ago.

Nearly a whole day has gone by, and in that time, two torrents are already seeding, three more are at 80%, 29% and 31%, which is OK, I don't have the fastest connection on the planet.  But this one has only managed to get to a miserable 1.1 percent!

To all those leeching hit-n-run fuckwits out there, I hope you get collected by a car as you cross the street, and the driver takes off and leaves you for dead, then we'll see how you like hit-n-run ya pricks!

There, I've had my rant, I feel a lot better now.

Thanx for the great upload!"
[V],NLUPPER002,2012-02-17T16:12Z,People must now how the ipfilter works in there client.
,strenght755,2012-02-17T17:00Z,hows the audo on this one???
,chl2is,2012-02-18T04:43Z,"@NLUPPER

how does the ipfilter work??"
,uthacalthing,2012-02-18T11:25Z,"Thanks for the reminder NLUPPER.  I did have ipfilter installed, but forgot to re-enable it when I installed uTorrent as a background service.

You're right of course, I am getting better dl speeds now [takes a bite of humble pie]

Cheers"
,boOya83,2012-02-29T17:29Z,"Superb quality, took a whole week to dl, but I will continue seeding this torrent untill it gets enough seeders, so the most ppl can dl it wit fairly good dl speed. Lets say at least a month :D"
,110RPM,2012-03-19T13:47Z,"Thanks mate!!! Skimmed through, excellent quality and I couldn't hear any sound distortion [which apparently were prevalent on some of the other versions] during the few fight scenes that I watched..."
,jude20,2012-03-24T07:46Z,Thanks!!! V10/A10
,okiringo,2012-03-25T10:30Z,"V:10/A:5?
Any time the audio get's loud and boomy, there is a HUGE amount of distortion.  I'm not necessarily blaming the uploader.  Does anyone have a suggestion as to why this would happen, if it wasn't the video?  I don't have this problem with any other movies/shows/games.  

A specific time that this is very apparent is when Zeus uses the fire whip.  And pretty much any action scene or big bass explosion sound. 

Any clarity is appreciated. "
,General_Mazaki,2012-05-29T09:49Z,"Video: 10/10
Audio: 5/10

Audio clicks during scenes where their is chaos and heavy bass. Otherwise great video. Hoping somebody would upload this with better audio."
