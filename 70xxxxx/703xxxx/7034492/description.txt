      Hoppy and Johnny arrive to take jobs as cow punchers for rancher               
      Trumbull and quickly learn of his fight with rancher Jim Jordan.               
      Taking a dislike to Trumbull for his attack on Jordan's foreman                
      Windy, they join up with Jordan instead and soon find themselves               
      caught up in the conflict.                                                 
                                                                
                                                           
                                                                             
                                                                 
                                                                    
                                                                   
                                                                               
   The source for this release is pretty rough. We decided that it would       
   be best to release this as internal so if at some point in the future       
   a better source comes out then it could be released. With alot of           
   these old westerns the source is so terrible nothing can be done to         
   remove the ghosting and nukers don't seem to understand that there is       
   very little chance that it will ever be able to be released without         
   the ghosting. So here it is as internal. Enjoy!
