,Dr4gOns,2012-02-15T02:31Z,"The audio is definitely not a 9 like ag_orange stated above, that sort of comment misleads people and wasted my time downloading this.

A - 7 sounds like a cam in most parts.
V - 8

Totally out of Sync by a couple of seconds, first 2 minutes of the film is in a foreign language which should be in English.

If you are really desperate go ahead and watch this, I'll wait out for a better copy. "
