i hate to sound picky (as i'm lucky to be able to view the shows at all without subscribing, myself), but as gbtv often relays critical, breaking news, it is somewhat unfortunate to have to wait so long to view your torrents after they originally air.

i understand you have your life and routine, but if it's possible, i'd greatly appreciate it if your contributions could be provided closer to their appearance on glenn's website.

once again, thanks for being so willing to share these with us. keep up the good work and god bless"
