,aneagle,2012-02-17T05:12Z,That thing PSG-211-PEE-CB-1083xxxx with any 4 digits for xxxx is the product key
,aneagle,2012-02-17T06:49Z,"It doesn't work, Desktop won't load."
,classy35,2012-02-18T15:40Z,Doesn't work
,gondrup,2012-02-23T12:30Z,"The keygen does work, you have to follow the guide on the forum properly:
1. Enter PSG-211-PEE-CB-1083xxxx with any 4 digits for xxxx INTO THE ""NAME"" FIELD IN THE KEYGEN
2. Copy that name into the ""product key"" field in paragon settings
3. Double click serial to copy
4. Paste into serial field in paragon settings
5. Good times"
,dhelsdon,2012-02-23T19:48Z,"This works great, followed instructions and it worked. Had to try a few different four digit combos before I found one that worked. 

Thanks a lot!!"
,chicalleje,2012-03-14T18:02Z,"I follow the instructions, but not working for me. It checks for serial on internet and when a disconnect ask me to activate offline contacting Paragon. 
Maybe I should disconnect before instaling, but now it's too late :("
,neocrosby,2012-03-28T00:01Z,"I successfully installed and found a 4 digit number that worked for activation, however upon restarting my computer my NTSF drive was no longer readable, much less writable.  Had to uninstall for me to be able to see my drive again.  What a headache."
,btlMD,2012-05-28T06:10Z,"Keygen most definitel does NOT work. I have been trying it for about a week now, everyday with different combinations but all keep coming up with errors! Shit torrent! "
,Juular,2012-07-13T08:45Z,"Do not use on 10.8 (Mountain Lion). In case you already did, you need to run Terminal from spotlight and do a manual uninstallation."
,LogosB,2012-08-20T17:52Z,You need Paragon NTFS 10 MAC to run it on Mountain Lion.
