This concert by Velvet Revolver was filmed in Houston, Texas in 2005 during
the tour in support of their bestselling and Grammy Award winning debut album
Contraband. The full length live tracks are intercut with snippets of interview
with the various band members talking about how Velvet Revolver came into being.

Rip Notes: Hybrid source, some of the interview scenes are telecined.
They were left so to keep them at the same framerate as the concert.

Hail 2 RHyTM!
