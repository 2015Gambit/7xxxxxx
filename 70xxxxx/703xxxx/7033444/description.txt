Traffic is a two-part (originally three-part) feature on the United States cable channel USA Network in 2004 featuring an ensemble cast portraying the complex world of drugs, their distribution, the associated violence, and the wide variety of people whose lives are touched by it all. The mini-series was partially shot in Kamloops, Ashcroft, and Cache Creek, B.C. standing in for Afghanistan.

It was inspired by the 1989 television miniseries Traffik

The Series offers a look into the world of trafficking, where drugs, weapons, and even people are traded all over the world. Here, the lives of three Seattle-based men become intertwined...until they're all in over their heads.
