,Amerikhans,2012-02-21T03:33Z,Got to the door to enter glaDOS final battle and it was stuck shut. Looking at reviews i was supposed to face a bunch of guys that never spawned. Completely stuck. Shot a random portal now i'm stuck in boss room and it dosn't even register that i'm in there. just glaDOS swinging around like an asshole.

In the portal menu, pick load game then find a level 19 save file. You should be able to fight GLaDOS. I have no idea why it's there though XD"

Hi there. thnx for the upload. Do you know how to set Portal 1 to widescreen? Setup settings don't work.."
,AshlynR,2012-05-15T05:47Z,I cannot seem to fix the Portal2 language problem. I tried following what you said below and deleting a file but I cannot even find a file for Portal2 at all. Just a Un-install and Launch link. It won't even let me un-install my Portal2 for some reason. Any ideas?
