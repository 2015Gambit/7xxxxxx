    Tony and the Team visit Newmarket, the birthplace of       
    horseracing, in search of the earliest archaeological     
    traces of the sport of kings. They dig in the heart of   
    the historic town, in search of the remains of King       
    Charles II's racing stables - arguably the world's         
    first stables dedicated for racing.                       
                                                             
    It's the last chance to work here, as construction is     
    about to begin on a multi-million-pound National           
    Horseracing Museum.                                       
                                                             
    From the start of the dig, the challenge for the Team     
    is to find evidence that will enable them to               
    distinguish a racing stable from an 'ordinary' royal      
    stable block. The pressure's on for team leader Jackie   
    McKinley to deliver the key small find or insight. With   
    a thick layer of concrete lying over the site, it's not    
    an easy task.                                             
                                                             
    And across the road from the stables site, there's a      
    second area to explore: King Charles II's 17th-century     
    Newmarket palace. To add to the excitement, there's the   
    prospect of Tony Robinson attempting to ride a           
    mechanical racehorse, and a team visit to the             
    racecourse on Ladies Day.
