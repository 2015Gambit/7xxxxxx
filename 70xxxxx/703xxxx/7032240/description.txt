[b]Anthony George "Tony" Banks[/b]   (27.03.1950)  is a British composer, and multi-instrumentalist, who performs as a keyboardist and a guitarist. He is one of the founding members of progressive rock group Genesis and one of only two members (the other being bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford) who have been with Genesis throughout its entire history. As a member of the group, Banks has been a pioneer in the use of a variety of keyboards, such the ARP Pro Soloist synthesiser, the Mellotron, the Yamaha CP-70 and the Hammond T-102 organ. Through most of the band's history, Banks was the leading force in Genesis' songwriting; although the group was often responsible as a whole for composing songs, his ideas were often the nucleus of their music, and he would frequently write lyrics as well. Outside of Genesis, Banks has enjoyed a modestly successful career in the world of film scoring, and a limited solo career as well. 

[b]Michael John Cleote Crawford Rutherford[/b]   (02-10-1950)  is an English musician. He is a founding member of Genesis initially as a bassist and backup vocalist.   In later incarnations of Genesis, he assumed the role of lead guitarist. 
 He also fronts Mike & The Mechanics.

[b]Philip David Charles "Phil" Collins[/b]  (30.01.1951)   an English retired singer-songwriter, drummer, pianist and actor best known as a drummer and vocalist for British progressive rock group Genesis and as a solo artist.
Collins sang the lead vocals on several chart hits in the United Kingdom and the United States between 1978 and 1994, either as a solo artist or with Genesis. His singles, often dealing with lost love, ranged from the drum-heavy "In the Air Tonight", dance pop of "Sussudio", piano-driven "Against All Odds", to the political statements of "Another Day in Paradise".
