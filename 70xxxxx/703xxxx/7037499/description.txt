Welcome anyone and everyone!

I don't know who you are but I thank God you are interested enough to seek this material out.

This is a three part seminar that has the intention of bringing a fuller picture in our hearts and minds of the perfect love of the Trinity and tying together the attributes of the three/one.

I found it very reassuring and I hope it has the same effect upon you!

I pray that this strengthens your faith and leads you to a clearer understanding of the wonderful love of our creator.

The speaker is Ty Gibson from lightbearer ministries.
