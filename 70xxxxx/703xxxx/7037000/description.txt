    contains new footage featuring David F. Friedman playing the role of     
    Mr. Alexander Leeds inserted into the film where the intermission        
    would have been.

    Sally and Bob have been married a year. She might be pregnant, so Dr.    
    West picks up a test sample and tells them to come by in a week for      
    the result. They recall problems they had just before marriage when      
    they found out about each other's past (V.D. and pregnancy). Dr. West    
    had helped them with good counsel and two films ("The Story of V.D."     
    and "The Story of Reproduction"). A week later at his office he has      
    good news and shows them another film, "The Story of Life." Dr. West     
    wants them to know about modern medical science and to teach their       
    kids the facts of life. The movie ends with a commercial for a new       
    five-book-in-one, "The Mid-Century Marriage Guide."
