,TeflonMike,2012-04-25T17:16Z,Hmm.. Keeps asking for windows live id..  Having made one it then asks for the games serial number.. Won't let you save with no gamerid ! Any workaround? 
,raver105,2012-05-14T22:02Z,"Step 1 - Download Windows Game Market Place
step 2 - make a New Account 
Step 3 -SIGN IN (LOCAL HOME) NOT LIVE

That should Solve your Save Problems
To get the xlive.dll download ""http://www.dll-files.com/xlive.zip?0WFgOHcIeX"""

where is this LOCAL HOME?
all it says is sign in, no option for local or live."
,NosTraDomus,2012-06-11T03:28Z,"found it, but next time add more detail.
when you start the game, windows live drops down, after you click start,from there choose, NEW PROFILE, then it shows you a paragraph of rules..at the bottom of this, there will be, create a local profile, click THAT, the type a player name. then OK it, then your done.
so its all done from within the game.

------------
any one else getting BAD FPS, im afraid to load a fps counter, but i think its around 15fps, the speech is not in sync either.

in settings it says change the game settings, from windows life market place, choose the game and change settings from there, BUT

the game doesnt show there..."
,coldquin,2012-06-23T02:06Z,i am at the part when the joker kicks you out that window and it always black screens can someone help?
,NosTraDomus,2012-06-26T01:21Z,"not worth it...

creating a local account works, but after a certain amount of NOT playing...your LOCAL PROFILE, gets deleted...

pressing HOME, just shows SIGN IN, but you need a windows live account...which i entered, but it does NOT shot the profile.

even creating ANOTHER local account, then pressing home, youll see buttons, DELETE PROFILES....
that should show ALL the profiles...but it just shows the one you created a few minutes ago.

so..if you have time, drink redbulll 24/7, shoot up crack...you might make it thru the whole game..so fuck it."
