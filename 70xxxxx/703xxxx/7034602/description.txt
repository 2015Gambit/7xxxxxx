Winner of Best Sports App 2010, Sports Business International Magazine. â˜… rated by the Sunday Times (Best 500 Apps review). 

This award winning Application is the only official Formula Oneâ„¢ Live Timing and Track Positioning application for Apple devices and will give fans a greater insight into Formula One than ever before thanks to a wealth of unique features and data. 

Whether youâ€™re at the race track or watching at home, the F1 timing App will get you closer to the action. With the new season comes a new tyre manufacturer and pit stops are likely to be a huge part of the championship, with the possibility of 3 or more pit stops for each F1 driver each race. With that in mind, track positioning on the App will be an invaluable companion throughout the sessions.
