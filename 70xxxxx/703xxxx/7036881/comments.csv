,markdavies3912,2012-03-15T03:48Z,"this shows up as a virus in both avg and malwarebytes, name; crypted.exe and moved it straight to quarantine.  some crypted.exe files are safe but i dont know if this is 1 of them?"
,markdavies3912,2012-03-15T03:58Z,"kimcaine, as far as bdwteam r concerned u r NOT an idiot for reporting a malfunction the poster knows about. by saying that they must be aware of the problems it causes with virus checkers because it is pre-activated and they should say so in their description. but i agree with kimcaine, this is shit. try posting something clean! bdwteam you have stated that the updater is not a virus but u havent stated anything about the crypted.exe that 1 or both the files contain.  please explain yourselves. CLEARLY. i bet it is a back door trojan"
,markdavies3912,2012-03-15T04:00Z,"bdwteam, please explain why u should turn off your anti-virus before install? surely thats not right? u never do that normally now do u? hmm"
