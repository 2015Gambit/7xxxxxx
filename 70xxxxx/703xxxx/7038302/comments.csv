,fsilva79,2012-02-18T13:40Z,"Hi gdbala,
Sorry mate, I just started to share this compilation 2 days ago, I have a lot of leekers and my connection is fast but not enough for 50 leechers at atime.
If someone knows of a torrent server where I can upload and share with a decent speed, please let me know so I improve my shares"
,fsilva79,2012-02-18T17:07Z,"I am working on upgrading my connection speed, soon I will be able to seed much faster (I hope).
Thank you for being patient and understanding"
,djbatesy,2012-02-18T18:49Z,"fsilva79, what connection do you have.. I'm on 100/10 so I can help"
,fsilva79,2012-02-18T19:18Z,"hi djbatesy,
I'm on a 4/1
how can I upload to your server?"
,fsilva79,2012-02-18T19:20Z,In a few hours I will be getting a 100/100 connection. 
,thexvilo,2012-02-19T10:53Z,do you already have your 100/100 connection because i am downloading here with 0.3 KB/S :(
,fsilva79,2012-02-20T05:53Z,"Uploading to a faster server
will be up and running in a few hours"
,crashdiet69,2012-02-23T06:39Z,It appears that I (along with my 23 other friends) are stuck at 42.7%.  Any chance you could seed to at least a select few (say 5 IP addresses).  Then we can redistribute.  Thanks
,fsilva79,2012-02-23T15:00Z,"@crashdiet69
working on it!
sorry for the trouble, I am currently working on uploading the whole package to a seedbox which is very fast, I still have 3.3 GB left to upload.
I hope these last files will be uploaded during the day.
After that I will be able to seed for good, for long and FAST!!! 
Thanks for your patience ;)"
,fsilva79,2012-02-27T15:17Z,"Finally I am up and seeding at decent speed.
Enjoy :)"
