Coast to Coast AM 2012.02.13 Non-Local Consciousness

Host: 	George Noory
Guests: Stephan Schwartz, Marla Martenson

Futurist and researcher in non-local consciousness, Stephan Schwartz, discussed remote viewing, meditation, dreams, and how changes in the Earth's geomagnetic field influence our consciousness and creativity. He credited non-local consciousness as the part of the mind that experiences intuition, facilitates remote viewing, and may even be what survives after death. Marveling at the advancements of science in understanding this non-local consciousness over the last 40 years, Schwartz mused that "we are approaching a view of the world that shamanism arrived at through meticulous observation, where the observer was the instrument."

He stressed meditation as a key tool in learning to access non-local consciousness. Schwartz explained that this is because the practice teaches one to focus their intention. "If you have the ability to focus intention," he said, "you can learn very quickly to open to this part of yourself." Additionally, Schwartz said that there is growing evidence that meditation has a physical effect on the brain. He cited a study which showed that, by meditating for as little as 11 total hours, the practice will result in parts of the brain actually getting larger. For more of Schwartz's insights into meditation, including some recommended techniques, see his paper on the subject:

According to Schwartz, the Earth's geomagnetic field is another element which plays a role in non-local consciousness. He explained that, during periods of weak solar activity when the field is calm, it becomes easier to access this aspect of the mind. In turn, he said, there is an observable increase in creative output from people which is demonstrated by surges in patents, books, and records. Should that calm extend over a lengthier period of time, Schwartz surmised, enormous change can occur. "When you see it played out across millions and millions of people, each of whom is slightly altered as a result of this, you can see how it has an effect at the social level," he said, suggesting that the Renaissance and the Enlightenment may have been fueled by this phenomenon.

During the evening, Schwartz also performed a remote viewing experiment with George and the listeners. The object which he had people try and view can be seen here:


Online Dating & Valentine's Day

In the first hour, Beverly Hills matchmaker, Marla Martenson, talked about online dating, relationships, and Valentine's Day. She noted that the stigma attached to finding romance online has abated considerably and that it now constitutes 53% of the staggering 2.1 billion dollar industry of dating services. Regarding Valentine's Day, Martenson said that while the holiday conjures up dread for many single people, she advised them to appreciate the positive aspects of not being in a relationship since the circumstances will likely change in the future.
