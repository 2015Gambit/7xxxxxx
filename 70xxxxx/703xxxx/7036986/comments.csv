It's also going very slow for me.
Seeding would be great, thanks!"
,YodaBoy44,2012-05-28T15:55Z,Thank you so much for all of you patience with those of us who have little training in software!! Please kindly UL the Rossetta Stone Philippine (Tagalog) that is compatable to Ver 3.4.7 in an exe format. The other language packs have worked wonderfully in that format!!
,minimi66,2012-05-31T08:44Z,"Hi,
Thanks so much for uploading these RS packs!  Can anyone tell me how to load the .iso packs into Rosetta Stone 3.4.7 itself?  I have had no problems at all installing and loading all of the Pre-installed packs but i can't figure out how to install the .iso ones.  All the packs and the programme itself work absolutely perfect on my Windows 7 PC.  Thanks very much if anyone can help."
