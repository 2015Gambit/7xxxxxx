As much as I like Dave Davies, his solo work ( while The Kinks 
were still together but during hiatus periods ) is not 
to my liking because it's very much hard-rock. 
The melodic compositions that his brother Ray is better known for is very different than these albums -- typical of the first half of the 1980s.

But I found these the other day, and wanted to share them with you.
