This hard to find, variation on the Frankenstein story really was shot in the beautiful rugged coastal countryside of Cornwall in the UK. Hazel Court is delightfully gorgeous and the movie is a nice time capsule of the vehicles, clothes, and simpler living of 1961.....except for 'the attempts of a Madman to make the perfect Human Being!'    :(
I made some adjustments using Handbrake and Sony Vegas Movie Studio since my DVD of it really isn't the greatest.
