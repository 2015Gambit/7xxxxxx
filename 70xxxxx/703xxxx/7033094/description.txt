This is an Unofficial LibreOffice 3.4.5 english CD image.

It has:
  * Mac OS X Intel 3.4.5 installer
  * Mac OS X PowerPC 3.4.5 installer
  * Windows (x86 or 32 bit) installer

It also has an icon when the disc is inserted into a Windows computer.

There is a web page, index.html, which is designed to show a user just about everything they would need to know to do an installation.


If there is something wrong with this CD (or if you have any suggestions or ideas), let me know in the comments.
