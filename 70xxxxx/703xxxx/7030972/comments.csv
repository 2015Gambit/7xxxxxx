[T],jmanwf,2012-02-14T10:43Z,hi folks will be uploading in  smaller file size from now on to save my bandwidth the quality wont degrade to much though i hope.  
,petermartyn1,2012-02-14T14:20Z,Thank you for sharing - Very much Appreciated
,crutter2,2012-02-14T20:57Z,is there any chance you can do General Hospital or The Bold and the Beautiful as well?
,SoWErA3,2012-02-14T22:13Z,"Thanks for making them but sucks that you have to make smaller to save your BW :(

Can't you just stop seeding after sharing to first second user and let the rest of us keep them alive?

I wouldn't mind spending a lot of my 100/100Mbit BW which is unlimited."
[T],jmanwf,2012-02-15T05:28Z,Good point will do that i will keep it at the higher quality then but it will just take me longer to upload but no big deal if you are patient
,SoWErA3,2012-02-15T12:07Z,Sounds great Thank you.
,petermartyn1,2012-02-15T20:03Z,You can definately see the difference in the quality so If everybody seeds maybe you might reconsider the 350mb episodes again - either way I am vert grateful for the Days Of Our Lives Episodes
,Dimmis80,2012-02-15T20:13Z,"Hey guys.@jmanwf thanks a lot for all of the uploads of the episodes of Days.Good work mate.I my self prefer quicker daylie,if this is posible uploads than better quality..And the quality of Mondays episode with les MBs was ok very watchable.Thats my humple opinion.Now about Tuesdays episodes are u gonna find time to upload it today or tommorow.!??"
,kitty56,2012-02-16T18:43Z,hey thanks for the upload got a question though when you list them can you list them as  example 2-13-2012 days of our lives cos i got boat loads of stuff downloaded and i usually just burn them to dvd and watch them at work and its crazy when i go through monday then bounce to t's for thurs and tues and w's for wed easier to keep track of them better thanks a bunch makes my night at work go faster
