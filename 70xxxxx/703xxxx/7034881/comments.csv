,Nygaard2k,2012-02-18T00:02Z,"Awesome upload, thanks again HeroMaster! Although, would you mind explaining the difference between this alan wake and the other one you upped two days later? I can see the other one has extra DLC, but, what that means exactly I do not know. The other torrent is 2GB smaller, so I'm confused all the way."

,turrel,2012-03-29T01:13Z,"4. Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder into the game installation

And exactly where do i install them? i've i double click
the desktop icon and get led to AW videos via steam, i click the launcher and get unable to launch executable are you sure you placed the the files in the right directory? which i did in steam main folder and nothing, another wasted download"
,turrel,2012-04-01T03:32Z,"Figured it out. if you are getting steam and the unable to launce executable box error, go to Alan Wake icon on desktop, right click select open file location and you should arrive at install folder copy skidrow contents there."
