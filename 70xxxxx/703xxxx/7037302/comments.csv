I've tried Wondershare Video Ultimate and I'm quite impressed. When I try to re-encode episodes for the wife a 22 min show ends up being 1.5 gigs...
What pre-sets should I be using if you don't mind that I ask. 

Thanks again bud, it is much appreciated. I wish I could help you seed ALOT more than I do but my ISP is giving me warnings about my uploads. And thus, I try to upload 2 to 3x to help out! Hope this is kewl!

Take care"
,AlanaRusso,2012-02-16T23:03Z,Thanks!
,whmxtra,2012-02-16T23:16Z,"Actually I'm a girl :P And I use several programs but my fav atm is bandicam. I generally don't have to recode but trick usually is just to down the settings a bit and stick with the same format (or 264 if you can). That should get you a smaller file size.

Presets generally aren't worth much either, getting the right file size usually requires custom tweaking the settings.

NP about the seeding, as long as ppl seed at least 1:1 I don't worry about it. And I don't have an upload cap per se (well I do but I don't care about paying for extra bandwidth so for me it doesn't matter what limit I have).

I also take requests as long as they are for hard to find things that the Scene aren't already covering."
,Kaybee73,2012-02-17T00:53Z,You rock!  Thanks!
,General1825,2012-02-17T03:47Z,"Hi, Lee here.  General Lee ???  Anyway thanks for your U/L.  Always appreciated.  I was tempted to make a girl joke, but you are above that.  Just go girl.....you are the best."
,mrstr,2012-02-17T06:05Z,Thank you for uploading these in such excellent quality each week. It is appreciated.
,thisispurx,2012-02-17T16:44Z,"TYTYTY!!!!

Not necessarily a request but a suggestion -- Something the scene used to cover and hasn't been that I am constantly looking for days after it airs -- The Real Housewives of ______ -- at the moment it is The Real Housewives of Orange County, e02 still isn't up on any torrent sites but it is On Demand. (Note 1 group covered e01 but that's it, e02 aired on Tues 2/14 and not 1 person, scene or non-scene has covered it.)

(before OC it was Atlanta and Beverly Hills and the same thing with them, it was several days or a week before it went up on here and it was never done by the Scene. Weeks were skipped, then uploaded all at once, etc etc. Atlanta was NOT on Demand, Beverly Hills was. I haven't followed the Scene long enough to know if they cover the other Real Housewives but I'm sure you can do a search and see. Here is a list of them all:
Real Housewives of Orange County, Beverly Hills, New York City, New Jersey, Miami, Atlanta)

Just a suggestion, if you don't pick it up, another PB member MIGHT already be in the process and just post it a week late like maybe member DIONFAN does with the other Real Housewives.(he tends not to seed after uploading:-( )...There were over 1000 peers trying to get the Real Housewives of BH part 3 reunion yest after he UL it (I documented it in a comment I made cause there was an issue with seeding) So if you did do it and could post it faster 1. It would be popular for sure.  2. I know I would 100% DL it every time from you since you ALWAYS seed it"

episode 2 went up today from someone else, but I will keep an eye on that and upload faster if needed, what day does it normally air?"
,nataliegfrom803,2012-02-19T01:02Z,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! PERFECT QUALITY! YOUVE MADE ME A HAPPY CAMPER TODAY :D

,jaymejay,2012-02-21T15:34Z,"Thank you so much! Once again, sincerely appreciate this, especially with such awesome quality! Thanks heaps! "
,blilmot,2012-02-22T14:23Z,"hi there
Do you have any of series 1 atall please? i missed 4 of them,that i cant upload from the crimson uploader on here for some reason,butyours work fine 
hope its ok to ask."
,blilmot,2012-02-22T14:36Z, Is anybody seeding please?
,thisispurx,2012-02-22T18:39Z,"Real Housewives of OC airs on Tues. @ 10. I saw e02 went up last Sun.(4 days after it aired.) The other shows I mentioned were always random days after it aired... a week, 5 days, 6 days..and the some atlanta shows never were uploaded or 3 episodes got uploaded at one time. Bottom line, and my point being is that no one can or could ever count on when they would being uploaded or if they would be UL at all. 

This is a popular series and franchise, it would be a popular download if you decided to do it. But since I've never created a torrent I have no idea the time that goes into it, or how to go about finding the episodes so I just mentioned this cause it is a hard to find DL on all torrent sites. As I said before, IF you uploaded it, I would be DL it from you and would greatly appreciate it. 

Just like you, I would only do it if no one else was doing it too, like you do with Dance Moms.  (or if I knew I was going to be posting it LONG before someone else to benefit the downloaders) "
,thisispurx,2012-02-22T18:41Z,"**NOTE FOR FANS OF DANCE MOMS: Abby Lee Miller was interviewed  on The View yesterday Mon., Feb. 21, 2012 as well as the Dance Moms (briefly). Then the girls danced as the end. It was the last segment of the show. *SPOILER* Kendall and Jill were NOT there at ALL and they made no mention as to why. I'm sure I will find out why when I watch this weeks Dance Moms e07 but at the time of watching The View it was before Dance Moms e07 had aired. "
,whmxtra,2012-02-23T08:56Z,"blilmot I have all of season 1, but would rather not upload the whole season (which would be about 5 gb) so if you can tell me which episodes you are missing I will do those for you.

thisispurx, I'll see what I can do about Real Housewives, but really busy these next few weeks.

Also, about Kendall not being on The View.... 

Spoilers below....



She left and went to Candy Apples, not sure if she quit or got tossed out (my guess is the latter, but haven't watched this weeks ep yet).

Now I think she's actually back now but they might have left her off The View to keep that from viewers till they are ready (or the rest of the moms refused to go on if they were there lol)."

"
,thisispurx,2012-02-24T06:05Z,"All of season 1 eps of Dance Moms are already uploaded here on PB, have you tried to DL them and not gotten any seeds is that the problem? "
,whmxtra,2012-02-24T06:42Z,"thisispurx, real housewives of oc s07e03 uploaded: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7054472/the.real.housewives.of.orange.county.s07e03.avi

blilmot will try and do those dance moms season 1 episodes for you tomorrow.

for those waiting on dance moms s02e07... well.... so am I lol. Lifetime doesn't have it up yet so nobody has it yet. Will check tomorrow and see if they have it up finally."
,blilmot,2012-02-24T11:14Z,"hi thisispurx 
no, seeds dont seem to be the problem they just wont download for me ,whereas the ones on this uploaders are perfect i have no idea why .
 I Could we some of them but the ones i missed flatout refused and wouldnt download."
,blilmot,2012-02-24T11:15Z,"thank-you whmxtra that would be beyond exciting ,i appreciate it so much!"
,mijiraffa,2012-02-25T11:04Z,You are such a life saver!! This is absolutely fabulous â&#x2122;Ľ
,whmxtra,2012-02-25T12:22Z,"blilmot, sorry for the delay, TPB giving me weird loading issues the last 24 hours or so, anyways, I've uploaded a torrent with all of season 1, but it's not a rar or anything so you can just select the eps you need and ignore the rest. Decided since it was only 4 gigs I might as well do a torrent of the complete season rather than just half. Note that non of the season 1 files were ripped by me, I just found them here and a few other places. Credit mostly to Crimson as most of the files are his.

For those waiting on episode 7, I will be checking throughout the day on this but so far lifetime has not upped it on their site so nobody has a source yet to rip from. But rest assured I'm on it."
,whmxtra,2012-02-26T01:50Z,"ok folks, episode 7 is finally up: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7057963/dance.moms.s02e07.avi"
