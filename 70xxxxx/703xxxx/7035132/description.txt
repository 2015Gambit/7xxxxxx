    A biker gang visits a monastery where they encounter black-robed         
    monks engaged in worshipping Satan. When the monks try to persuade       
    one of the female bikers, Helen, to become a satanic sacrifice the       
    bikers smash up the monastery and leave. The monks have the last         
    laugh, though, as Helen, as a result of the satanic rituals, is now      
    possessed and at night changes into a werewolf, with dire results for    
    the biker gang.
