,hisicon,2012-02-21T16:39Z,hey Lucybabe really appreciate!!! How (or where) can I get all the Sibelius 7 sounds onto my Mac? Thank you!!
,ckurz7000,2012-02-21T18:56Z,"I installed as per instructions but don't get any sound. I have Sibelius 6 also installed, which works great. But Sibelius 7 -- nada. All sound files installed on external drive, volume turned up. Anybody else has this problem?"
,Lucybabe,2012-02-25T13:13Z,"If you are running Windows 7 and are having trouble with the Sibelius sounds contained within the contents pack then the following will be of help:

Be very wary about following the above link!"
,Keybakun,2012-03-04T10:33Z,Great job copying my torrent from Demonoid. You even copied the exact description. Without giving credit.
,curchaco,2012-03-13T07:21Z,"Hi,can You help  me, I did step by step all the instalation but when I run the program is asking for the ID product? what I made wrong? what I must to do?
Thanks"
,Keybakun,2012-03-15T02:28Z,"Seeing as Lucybabe wanted to copy my torrent on here, she can help you with the troubleshooting. I have an idea of what you did wrong but I have no motivation to help her."
,kingbob14,2012-04-07T19:58Z,"So, what kind of disc should I burn it to? CD-RWs only go up to 800 MB or so last I checked, I'm just a little confused. "
,marcuslelus,2012-04-17T21:29Z,"Very good torrent! all work as it supposed to! in this version, there are several error in the sound! we can't write a song without starting with an existing previous demo made by sibelius. this error has been fixed in version 7.1.2, so now, we need someone to upload it! when I go see to find the uploader, they ask me a activation ID, so the only way to get this file is (i think) to buy sibelius, and to give the uploader to community!! anyway, thx lucybabe, this is a great torrent and the sound is very incredible :)"
,Jannyboy111,2012-04-18T09:50Z,"Hi
I have a problem with mounting the first image.
mounting just doesn't work.
is there anything I can do?"
,Jannyboy111,2012-04-18T10:24Z,"ooh sorry. download didn't complete =S
but
Couldn't you've made a .rar file of this? caus downloading is taking forever."
,dooja.06,2012-04-20T19:36Z,"Thank you for the upload, the first one I have found where the crack actually works, however, for some reason the sound is not working. I have followed your instructions completely. I am working on Windows 7, I am sure this is relevant info.
Cheers"
,sirpo4life,2012-05-02T01:42Z,pls Lucybabe where can i get the key thanks
,sirpo4life,2012-05-02T01:43Z,anyone please where can i get the key thanks.
,javintham,2012-06-27T19:26Z,"Hi Lucybabe, I extracted all the ISO files but when you said:
""3: Repeat step 1 with Content 1 and install""
I went into the ""Sibelius 7 Content 1INSTALLE"" folder and run SIBELIUS.exe (78kb) but error occurs everytime and it creates an error logfile and the logfile says:
""Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""Sibelius7SoundsInstaller.py"", line 12, in 
  File ""wx__init__.pyc"", line 45, in 
  File ""wx_core.pyc"", line 4, in 
  File ""wx_core_.pyc"", line 12, in 
  File ""wx_core_.pyc"", line 10, in __load
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.""

I don't understand what's happening, and when you say 'install', do you mean running the SIBELIUS.exe file I mentioned?"
,darklink1226,2012-06-28T16:44Z,"Everything seems to be done very well and working great. However, after following instructions, I got the program to start and it asks for an activation ID. Can someone tell me what I did wrong, if I did do something wrong? The last thing I did in the installation was run the generic assign patch on the DLL file. Also, after continuing to try to run the trial, it seems like playback is not happening. Maybe I should try the the thing from the link to the Sibelius website. Thank you."
,tenor93,2012-06-29T06:04Z,Where can I get this same torrent for a mac?
,csulpw,2012-07-05T05:11Z,"Okay, I figured it out for my system. I was having issues installing all of the content after the initial Sibelius install. The Start application in the Install ISO allows you to install a basic sound library (Keyboard sample and some other stuff), but once this process is completed, the installers in the content directories refuse to work. Here is what I did.
1. Before installing Sibelius, mount each content ISO and copy all of files from the InstallerData folder in each one to a made-up directory you can easily access. This will take awhile since there are 7 gigs in each one. 
2. Copy all of the files and folders from the Install ISO (after you mount it) to a separate directory. 
3. Move all of the sample .rar files from the first directory into the InstallerData folder in the new install directory. 
4. Either create a new ISO file from this new directory, mount, and install, or jump straight to installing from the folder using the Start Application.
5. Install Sibelius and NOW install Sibelius & sounds. Instead of the usual 5 to 6 files it installs, there will now be 32 from combining the install and content samples into one folder. 
6. Continue installing whatever options you want and do the updates and license key stuff.
   BTW, when installing the sound library, it will take a LONG time to extract everything.
  Hope this helps."

I thought that the patch was for that kind of problem...
can you help me?"
,-PmsP-,2012-07-23T14:56Z,I already fix it...
