Popular Mechanics Magazine: Let's be honest. You pride yourself on being a jack-of-all-trades, but when it comes to those tough fix-it projects, you aren't quite up to par. Or maybe you are an expert handyman, but need a little refresher on certain aspects. Popular Mechanics is designed for both the master and the novice. The premiere do-it-yourself magazine features how-to articles on electronics, woodworking, home improvement, science and technology and automotive repair. Reviews of new products as well. Simply put, it is the only fix-it resource you need.
