,empireblood,2012-02-20T05:54Z,Finish the download but It needs the crack
,empireblood,2012-02-20T06:14Z,"The game works but Im running with Phenom IIX4 @3.4ghz HD 6870 and 4GB of RAM and I got 4 fps at the village, If I rename d3d8.dll and dinput8.dll the game runs great but It looks like Morrowind in 2002 any advice?"
,checkem,2012-02-20T15:17Z,"-empireblood 

Read the instructions. It says right there, mount the iso and play.
If you want more fps go to MGEXEgui.exe and go to the distand lands tab, and lower the draw sitancedistance to 25.0"
