,zero1zero,2012-02-18T06:45Z,Everytime I finish installing a newer version of IDM it immediately says I'm using a fake serial and the box to enter the name and serial pops up. Whether or not I enter any info and close the box the Registration option in the menu gets greyed out and I can't click on it.  Is this normal?
[T],promodsharma,2012-02-18T09:34Z,"@'zero1zero' - No it's not normal. You are either not patching the program or not  Copy / Paste / Replacing, the crack before entering the serial. If you do not have a firewall, turning off the internet before installation is also helpful."
,zero1zero,2012-02-19T15:12Z,When I installed this the first time I got the fake serial message. I entered the serial in the description. Then I decided to install it again to see if I would get the message. After re-installing but before clicking on the 'Finish' button at the end I copied the patch to the directory and then clicked Finish and it didn't give me the fake serial error anymore. I don't know if it simply worked the first time or if copying the patch over before I clicked Finish helped but either way the message is gone.  I also disconnected my Internet.
