And that's putting it nicely."

,JBCSDL24,2012-04-18T04:56Z,"Nothing wrong with the download, its great quality and downloaded fast!"
,klip1,2012-04-19T23:24Z,"@50nathan,

It all depends on the source though.  You could have a 320kpbs, but is a rip from a shitty 128kpbs source.  Majority of albums come out default 256kbps anyways"
[T],ThingsfromHeaven101,2012-05-09T08:07Z,You must be kidding...shitty source? I ripped it straight from the Itunes+ version. I only forgot to change my settings back to 320 so that's why this is one rank lower. I get you're trying to make assumptions but could you be a bit more realistic please?
