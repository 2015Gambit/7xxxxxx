IMPORTANT: We've noticed that some users (maybe 5%) experience some problems. These are some types of errors that they get:
1. LICENSE ERROR - please check your internet connection and Google account synchronization on the phone or tablet. The internet connection should be required only for the first launch.
If you still encounter this error, please contact us!
2. Operation failed because of Market internal error.
3. "This application cannot be installed on your device" - if you have an Android 2.1 and a touchscreen, Market should let you install the app! We've noticed this isn't related to particular phones or countries. It might be related to particular carriers or SIM card presence. You could also try logging into Market App on the phone using Wi-Fi connection. If it finally works for you, please let us know how you did it so we can update these instructions.
4. Market's stuck on "Downloading..." - some users report that the wallpaper eventually gets installed later automatically (that's listed under the Market's known issues).
We've contacted Market support about problems 2 and 3 but they were unable to resolve them, just gave us some suggestions. You might want to try emailing them directly so we get more attention.

When you install Magic Butt, it is bound to your Google account, so you can use it on as many devices (Android phones and tablets) as you want to.
Copy protection is disabled, so you can install Magic Butt on a device with root access.
However, we use Android Market licensing service, so the internet connection is required during the first launch. Also, license is sometimes re-checked; we're not sure, how often would it be, because the whole process is managed by Google's Android Market licensing server.
