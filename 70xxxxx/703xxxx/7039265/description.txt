Anybody using an airtel connection and later on if decided to switch the connection to some other suscriber say BSNL may need to flash its Beetel adsl2+router using this firmware to unlock the functionality of router locked by airtel's default firmware...............

Note this firmware is meant for Beetel 450TC1 ADSL2+router.

Once you flash your adsl2 modem + router you can use the same for other connections as well..........Cheers........
