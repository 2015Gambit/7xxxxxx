,mikeyMovie,2012-06-19T23:24Z,"for godsake why all ur movies MP4 ?
i dont disrespect u or ur movies
its just AVI better"
,MaxKohler,2012-08-23T17:08Z,"This 1.5 gig rip is significantly better quality than his 800mb rip. I'd give it a 9/9. People who are giving it a 7/7 must be comparing it to watching a blueray disk on their 52"" HDTV.

@mikeyMovie
lol... avi's not better for quality/size, it might be better for wider compatibility..."
