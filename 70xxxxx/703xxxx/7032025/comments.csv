,SHaDoWS_GaMeR,2012-02-14T21:13Z,ur welcome btw it should be 1 seed not 3 i think tpb is counting dht and local peer as well as my demonoid account or maybe since i had multiproblems getting the torrent size right for demonoid its counting my previous attempts but thats doubtful but who knows 
,SHaDoWS_GaMeR,2012-02-17T19:56Z,"everyone please seed the pieces that u recieve from me if i see anyone break beyond the pack (the average user percentage) i will put an ip block on u preventing u from downloading any piece from me this is to ensure the health and prosperity of the torrent 
just so u know i reserve the right to block connections to people that fail to comply im only doing this due to the fact that my upload speed sucks "
