if you have a laptop with hdmi watch if with your laptop if not you will have to wait for another upload."
,ReitenX,2012-02-16T11:17Z,"@brandon92883
Watch it on your computer.  The video is protected so you can't watch it on the PS3.  You'll need a different video file that isn't protected or a way to bypass the protection if you want to watch it on the PS3.  Many movies are protected by Cinavia so you'll just have to deal with it and watch it on your computer.  Not much of a difference is there?

I see A LOT of people here complaining about the audio. F Y I, try updating your audio drivers and codecs, or if that fails  buy some new speakers.

Thanks for the upload."

,butchman2012,2012-05-07T15:58Z,"duguis - Personally I think if the uploader is advertising their content as ""R5 Full Line"" then I would expect no less than DVD quality video and sound. If I wasted my bandwidth downloading content from someone who has advertised it incorrectly then I would also be upset. 

Thankfully I don't have a bandwidth cap so its not a massive issue, plus I get all my movies from Usenet servers anyway so generally they download at a much faster rate than torrents.

Who cares that its free? I wouldn't have an issue if they didn't advertise it as one thing, then when it's downloaded you actually find out its something completely different.

This is what the comments section is for. It's meant for other people to leave comments on the quality of the content they are downloading. Its only personal opinion so you should never criticise someone for that opinion.

,QborT,2012-05-18T08:27Z,Why the fuck are all you idiots downloading this R5 with LiNE audio when the Bluray has been released?
,Phrozenjib,2012-05-27T18:02Z,@QborT because some of us playback on the PS3 and most of the Bluray copies have Cinavia Protection..
,nazgull2k10,2012-06-07T21:23Z,"sounds like 1 more reason to be a proud Xbox 360 owner to me.  ROFL.

Besides that.. this movie was so shitty it wasnt even worth watching to laugh at."

,zardoc54,2012-07-19T01:51Z,What is an R5 video?
,grt666,2012-08-11T02:17Z,"@nazgull2k10 you are about dumb as a rock. I have both a ps3 and xbox360 and i cant even playback any blue ray dvd's or rips do to the cinavia on either system. pc only can i. 

people need to stop whatever program they are using that involves cinavia playback encoding."
