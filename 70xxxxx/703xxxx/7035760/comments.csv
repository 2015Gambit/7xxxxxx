http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7035229/Immortals_%282011%29_1080p_MKV_x264_AC3_DTS_MultiSubs

What's the difference? They both seem to be 11.2Mbps video. This one's just missing AC-3 audio?"
,Malekith,2012-02-16T08:48Z,"DTS 1.5mbit is much better than ac5 if u have a sub.

11.2mbps bitrate
and almost 1080

Really good stats for 10gb imo :)"
,strenght755,2012-02-17T17:00Z,hows the audo on this one???
,Arko_sa,2012-02-18T20:45Z,Seed guys.. Going really slow. Ill write A/V after i download.. 60kbps max atm..
,Revisionist,2012-02-18T22:16Z,"video looked great. audio was OK... HOWEVER... the encode is baaaad IMO.  One player wouldnt open it at all with out hanging.  Next player it was choppy choppy choppy and was nearly like watching still images.  3rd player opened fine and played fine but then had serious sych issues about 5 minutes in.

The audio seems off at parts where it's loud. Like the ocean scene with Poseidon. Not sure. Good but not perfect imo. 
Download was effing slow as well b/c of seeding."
