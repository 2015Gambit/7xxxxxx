"DADA-ACTAâ€ project is the spontaneous response of a community of Slovak and Czech artists to the February 2012 renewed attempts to implement ACTA agreement. It is a response to its vagueness, narrow-mindedness and secrecy camouflaged in the form of an economic treaty meant to fight against trademark counterfeiting. The project initially started as a musical compilation, which was later joined by visual and text artists. To the open call of the organizers responded artists that for one reason or another donâ€™t agree with ACTA, and most of them wrote a statement to explain their own position. The result of the project is: a 4 volumes musical compilation, released under Creative Commons license Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike CC BY-NC-SA [n.b. Slovakia is one of the few European countries that still doesn\'t acknowledge CC]; a website containing all artworks/links to artworks, plus artistsâ€™ statements and bios [when provided].
The same way according to ACTA we are all criminals unless proven otherwise [at the expense of our privacy and knowledge], we challenge ACTA to prove its intentions are honest and civilian oriented, and till not proven we will continue to consider it a threat to freedom of speech and of knowledge. That is why this project will continue to exist and to fight for digital rights and fair approaches to authorship rights till, hopefully, our governments will learn to listen to their citizens and not to their foreign business partners.
