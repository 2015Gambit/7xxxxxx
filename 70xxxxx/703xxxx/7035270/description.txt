The three pocketbooks comprising the English Through Pictures series are the remarkable invention of I.A. Richards and Christine Gibson, who designed them to help the learner speak, read and write English in the quickest and clearest possible way - through pictures. The authors have made a careful selection of the most widely useful English words, choosing those with the power to define other words, and have put them to work in key patterns that offer the learner the ability to communicate successfully in English. Book 1 contains a vocabulary of 250 such words, with an additional 500 developed in Book 2; these 750 words are then used in 

Book 3 to build a command of 1000 words which, by their defining power, hold the possibility of understanding as much as another 20,000 words of English. Throughout English Through Pictures, responsibility for learning is placed directly on the learner, who from the very start enjoys the ability to put essential words to work creating key sentence patterns where meaning is clearly shown in pictures. These simplified drawings allow learners to focus on the sentence and to enjoy growing confidence as they successfully take control of language, with the workbooks in Books 1 and 2 challenging andtheir growing competence as both speakers and readers. Motivated and inspired, learners will soon find to their delight that fluent communication in English - the common language of today's world - lies well within their grasp. English Through Pictures has already been used successfully by millions of learners in more than forty countries.

The three pocketbooks comprising the English Through Pictures series are the remarkable invention of I.A. Richards and Christine Gibson, who designed them to help the learner speak, read and write English in the quickest and clearest possible way - through pictures. 

 Book III keeps in mind that its readers will have many different needs. Some will want more English to help them to find work, some as a step on the way to higher education, some for business, travel or better livingâ€”and some because English opens for them a window with a wider outlook on the world.

 As with English Through Pictures, Books I and II, this book can be used in many ways: as a self-teacher, a schoolbook, a blueprint or design for recordings, filmstrips, sound motion pictures and television. It is the purpose of this book to supply starting points from which people can go out in different directions as their different interests take them.
