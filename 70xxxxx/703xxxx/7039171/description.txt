    This film traces the early career of Bob Dylan in a manner no other      
    has ever attempted telling his tale from his birth in Duluth,            
    Minnesota; through school and college; across his years as New York's    
    bright young starl, through to his electric phase, culminating with      
    the controversial 1966 world tour. Featuring interviews with a host      
    of friends, colleagues and associates from that era, and numerous        
    others, rare and often previously unseen footage, daring and             
    outspoken contributions from the very finest Dylan writers [such as      
    Derek Barker, CP Lee and Clinton Heylin] and a host of other             
    features, this film is among the finest Bob Dylan documentaries yet      
    to emerge.                                                               
                                                                             
    This documentary details music legend Bob Dylan's life from his          
    upbringing in Minnesota, to his explosion on to the New York City        
    folk scene, to his divisive and legendary 1966 tour that found him       
    alienating his previous audience by playing with an electric rock and    
    roll band.
