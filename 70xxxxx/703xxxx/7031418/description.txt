Super Smart Animals
Prepare to be amazed, entertained and even outwitted by the world's Super Smart Animals. For centuries, the idea of intelligent animals struck most people as ridiculous. But not any more - the latest science reveals that animals are a lot smarter than we thought. Liz Bonnin embarks on a worldwide search for the planet's most intelligent animals, devising some ingenious IQ puzzles and even putting herself to the test to find out.


1)  Part 1 
In the first programme, Liz gets creative with dolphins, shares a eureka moment with orangutans and defends the reputation of the human race when she goes head to head with a chimp genius in a test of maths and memory. There is an octopus escapologist, John Humphrys puts a goldfish through its paces on Mastermind, and Tillman the skateboarding dog wows crowds in Los Angeles.

2)  Part 2 
In the second of two programmes, Liz meets grey whales with emotions much like our own, unravels how the Caribbean's cleverest monkeys outwit their human neighbours, and even has a conversation with the world's cleverest chimp - with some surprising consequences. Explore how Seattle's crows can hold grudges for years, discover that the cleverest dogs can learn over 1,000 words, and find out why Asian elephants can spend hours looking at themselves in giant mirrors. Then there is Meerkat School, eye-poking capuchin armies, and even a new version of Einstein's infamous equation written by a sheepdog.
