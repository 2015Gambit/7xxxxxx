files when the seeder (Un-named groups) could save us all a lot of time. Many thanks to all the uploaders 

who no longer use RAR files."

,greenwheel,2012-09-29T06:28Z,Having to unrar everything is annoying that's why people complain about it. RARS are for ftp transfers. With bittorrent they are not required because all the files in the download are hashed so any corrupted bits can easily be replaced. ftp tranfers aren't hashed so the corrupted rar file can be redownloaded instead of having to download the whole file over again.
