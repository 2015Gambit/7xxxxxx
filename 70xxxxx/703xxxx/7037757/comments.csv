,aasfsaf27,2012-02-17T06:44Z,"the files are rar'd with the name:
psych.without.the.comedy.415.720p-dimension

and you 3 fuckers at the top say thanks?

what is with the fucking fakes on this site? why isn't this sceneline cunt banned? he is seeding like 100 other fakes

if it's rar then it's fake, period."

To aasfsaf27 - chill the fuck down and give your brain a chance man! 
Psych is the name of a similar series and naming the rar's like this is sceneline's way of jokingly referencing that - that's all. 
Rar's are not always fake - in fact they are very rare indeed, if you use the trusted seeders  - the one's with green skull after their names, marking them as VIP's.  
Like sceneline, who consistently have provided quality seeds over time - and who you just called a cunt and wanted banned... 
So please - just give your brain a chance and think before your start talking nonsense the next time, ok?"

Are you serious? What kind of fucking moron knowingly rename shits in releases base on their own opinion? Do you know how many fake and virus shits are out there with password'd rars and wrong filename? 

This is sceneline's way of being a fucking idiot.

What kind of fucking moron calls a trusted VIP-seeder a cunt and wants him banned, based on his own misconceptions and inability for rational thought?

Sceneline = a trusted VIP-seeder with 100+ PAGES of listed torrents, literally thousands of individual torrents over the years.

You = a whiny little brat who can't tell the difference between some punk uploading fakes and a trusted seeder, and who himself have contributed totally ZERO uploads...

You're the fucking idiot, ok?"

Good stuff! Thanks!"

Let me guess, you're some dumb cunt with cheap time and no live that's why you give a shit who the fuck is a ""VIP"" on a fucking torrent site. Looking at how quickly you reply me I am pretty sure you're mr ""sceneline"" yourself.

Listen, people in the real world don't give a fuck who is a VIP here, people come here to download shits, they don't come here to study the member pool, and if some fucking dumb cunt renamed real release to some high-school-girl giggle BS then that alone deserves to be flamed. People aren't gonna wait until the 1GB worth of renamed RARs to download and then CHECK, 99% of the time they're fucked up virus fakes.

So if you use rars and then rename them to some stupid shit, then you're a fucking moron, it's that fucking simple. Get it?

Now stop whining and fuck off."

I think you should leave all of scenelines releases alone from now on then - cause you don't want to download something that you don't understand or trust, and you're clearly to stupid to understand a simple rating system based on proven performance over time. 

Instead of using your poor excuse for a brain, it's easier just bitching and moaning about things you don't understand and you're apparently to lazy and fucking stupid to learn or simply accept what grown-ups tell you. 

Grow a brain, use it or at least pretend like you have one. Stop bitching like the spoiled little brat you are and be thankful someone takes the time providing you with torrents, since your apparently not providing shit for anyone, ever. 
You're just the kind of ungrateful little shit who probably doesn't even reseed the stuff you bitch and moan about getting for free, at the same time as your calling trusted VIP-seeders cunt and wanting them banned! 

In short - nobody needs your pathetic excuse of an existence, since you're not providing anything worthwhile anyway.  
So please just fuck of and die will you, so the rest of us can enjoy the quality torrents sceneline and other good seeders provides us in peace - despite stupid fucks like yourself calling them names when your to fucking stupid and ungrateful to understand what they do for you!"
,shpongles,2012-02-18T06:04Z,"Yep it's official, aasfsaf27 is a fucking idiot. 
Since he doesn't care about VIPs, I hope he downloads bad torrent and gets his Internet shut down. Then we won't have to read his stupid shit."
,tuvokk,2012-02-23T03:40Z,"While I hate this packing in hundreds of rar-files, I love what I get after decompressing them.
I guess sceneline has a good reason for rar-ifying the uploads, even if it's beyond me.
In any case, thanks to sceneline for uploading!"
