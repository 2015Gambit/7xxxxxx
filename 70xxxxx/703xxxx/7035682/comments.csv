,gps1976,2012-02-19T02:46Z,Thanks for the avi format version - Tosh.0 doesn't exactly lose much when not in hi-def .mkv
,jccl87,2012-02-21T04:08Z,"agreed with gps1976, it's not one of those shows that you need in hi-def. i have all the episodes dating back to season to 1 and just like having them all the same size and format. thanks a bunch"
