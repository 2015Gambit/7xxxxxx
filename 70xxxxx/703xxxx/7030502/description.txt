Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 â€“ December 6, 1988) was an American singer-songwriter, best known for his distinctive, 
powerful voice, complex compositions, and dark emotional ballads. Orbison grew up in Texas and began singing in a 
rockabilly/country and western band in high school until he was signed by Sun Records in Memphis. His greatest success 
came with Monument Records between 1960 and 1964, when 22 of his songs placed on the Billboard Top Forty, including 
"Only the Lonely" "Crying" and "Oh Pretty Woman" His career stagnated through the 1970s but several covers of his songs 
and the use of "In Dreams" in David Lynch's Blue Velvet revived his career in the 1980s. In 1988, he joined the supergroup 
Traveling Wilburys with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne and also released a new solo album. He died 
of a heart attack in December that year, at the zenith of his resurgence. His life was marred by tragedy, including the 
death of his first wife and his two eldest sons in separate accidents.

Mystery Girl is the last album recorded by Roy Orbison, posthumously released on the Virgin label in 1989. The album 
became a hit worldwide, reaching #5 on the US Billboard 200, and #2 on the UK Albums Chart

All the tracks were recorded in late 1988, and it was finalized for release in the weeks following Orbison's death through 
the collaborative efforts of several artists who were all friends and admirers. The album was named after the chorus from 
the track "She's a Mystery to Me", written for Orbison by U2's Bono and The Edge.

In the documentary In Dreams: The Roy Orbison Story, Bono tells how he woke up for a concerts sound check, following a 
late night listening to the soundtrack to David Lynch's Blue Velvet, and had the tune in his head, figuring it was another 
Orbison song ("In Dreams" was the only Orbison song on that album). During the sound check he performed it for the other 
members of U2, who agreed that the track sounded like an Orbison song. A short while later, Orbison met the band backstage 
at one of their concerts and subsequently asked Bono if he would like to write a song with/for him.

The album was released posthumously in 1989 and would join another Orbison album on the Billboard chart. Traveling Wilburys
Vol. 1 was recorded in mid 1988 as part of the supergroup, Traveling Wilburys. The dual success means that Roy Orbison joins 
Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson as the only singers to simultaneously have two Top 5 albums on the Billboard chart posthumously.
