That would make us all very happy..please if it is not very time consuming do it. we'll be waiting.."

My link extraction program fails with the bonus scenes for some reason... I will try to investigate and fix it at some point but right now I am bedridden with a cold so I need some rest."

oh well, thanks for this."
,christianovers,2012-02-16T15:47Z,"very grateful for the torrent, but why does it have to be so huge? 350MB is more than sufficient"
,OutlanderDownUnder,2012-03-02T14:54Z,"HI, thanks for the show. I seem to have the behind the scenes for S4E03 and 04 but not the actual episodes. Can someone please point me in the right direction for them? thanks Mate"
