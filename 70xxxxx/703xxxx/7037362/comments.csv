Does anyone have the same?"
,ivanhoe68,2012-02-18T11:22Z,"This is the patch all needs, it got updated with DX11 support! The framedrops i totally gone! 

Thx scene4all!"
,Pirat47,2012-02-18T14:45Z,"It should be noted that it includes the DLC - that's why it's so big.

But what about moving trees - does anyone else have this problem or is it just me?"

,shank3d,2012-03-11T06:09Z,um.. if you installed the game via downloads alrdy and it's a cracked version and you played on it; the game saved a couple of cases already. Then you download and install this would it overwrite your saved cases and make you start over again? Would this update also say crash the game? just wondering..
