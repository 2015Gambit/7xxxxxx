,airsonix,2012-07-08T11:47Z,"I LOVE BLACK PEOPLE,
but i think all this ""dog"", ""nigger"", ""drugs"", ""kill"", ""murder"", ""fuck"", ""white trash"" words and culture is totally a BS and is ridiculous. it blows my head with all this garbage BS.

please black people(and white people too), be more appreciated and find some culture.

good country, good deep house, good soul, blues, jazz are good to go and don't blow your head with stupid BS.

GROW UP!!!

sincerely thank you from Israel."
