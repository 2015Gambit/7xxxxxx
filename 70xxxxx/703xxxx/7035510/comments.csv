,wolftatt,2012-02-16T03:36Z,can someone please help me? this is 7.46gb but a dvd disc is only 4.7gb so which disc would you use for burning?
,Cerebral222,2012-02-16T04:15Z,"@wolftatt, use duel layer DVD if you have to, but most people just mount the ISO with Daemon tools, or Alcohol 120%, alot easier that way."
,andrei.92brb,2012-02-16T12:07Z,or make it for 2xdvd5 or visit fileforums section cd2dvd conversion

,Sl4t3,2012-02-16T13:11Z,"Thanks for the upload, now i can test it before deciding if to invest my money. :) I'm curious if it is any better than my xbox360 version. they used to talk about better graphics for pc etc...let's see. hope they bring out some dlc's for this stuff. "
[T],faren73,2012-02-17T00:54Z,What? why would you even burn this in the first place. I'm guessing that would be a waste of your DVD since the crack that in the skidrow folder
,wolftatt,2012-02-17T02:44Z,"Ok so i finally finished downloading, can someone please tell me what to do now? I extracted all the contents to a folder and there was no image... just 5 Setup .bin files titled a-e, a SKIDROW folder, a Setup icon (which i already installed but then nothing happens) and just an autorun information document. I don't know much about this kind of stuff... what do i do?"
