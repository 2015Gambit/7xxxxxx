Adapted from John Philip Sousa's autobiography, this musical dramatized version of the marching band king's life follows Sousa's (Clifton Webb) stint in the Marine Corps, after which he formed his own marching band. A young Robert Wagner stars as Sousa's protÃ©gÃ©, and Ruth Hussey takes on the role of Sousa's wife, Jennie. Directed by Henry Koster, this high-spirited musical earned three Golden Globe nominations for the film and its two male stars.
