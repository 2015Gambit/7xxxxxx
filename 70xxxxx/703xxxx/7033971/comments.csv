I've been patching these things for years. A little assistance would of been nice. I placed patch in directory, went to registration menu (not online) and clicked 'enter reg key' but it doesn't work. does patch have to overlay app file, or just place in directory? Is the online registration or the enter reg key in menu optioins? Thanx in advance."
,lokes2,2012-02-16T20:00Z,"Okay, my bad. It's a msvcr100.dll problem I'm having with Win7. Always somethin."
,lokes2,2012-02-16T20:34Z,Everything works great. I guess you can't use Remote Access without purchasing? Which is really what I wanted to do in the first place.
,anytacoji,2012-02-17T18:27Z,"Hello, can somebody help me to install remote?Because this patch is not work for me,i copy patch in install directory but is not patch file,because ask me serial:(im a girl and im not good in this stuff, please help me,tanks :)"
,marc93,2012-02-18T14:05Z,remote installation asks for an update can anyone help me? thank you
,satriani1,2012-02-21T02:32Z,"@lokes2 how did you solve the msvcr100.dll problem? in my pc there's no prob but in the pc i want to install it, it gives me an error. when i downloaded the dll and i put it at c/windows/system32 (win7) then it gave a different error, sayin something like ""your msvcr100.dll is for a different version of windows""... 

any idea? ??? ???? ????????"
,marc564,2012-03-01T01:51Z,"The msvcr100.dll problem can be fixed by downloading and installing this: 

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555

The patch didnt seem to do anything to change to program, and 083A-E649-5E15 worked as a serial number when i put it in the ""enter regerstration key"" from the start menu, but that didnt seem to change it at all either... is the patch broken?"
,kshithij,2012-03-08T02:32Z,"for remote installation type exactly the following phrase:

ardamax key logger v3.8.9 and search in piratebay.
Then select the torrent by a guy named gtorrento.
It is version 3.8.9 little older than 3.9 but remote installation works. Don't bother too much about version. It doesn't make big differences"
,t3h_pwnage,2012-03-25T05:15Z,This version sucks. It has limited functionality and you cannot send remote installation. Uploader should have specified this in the description.
,t3h_pwnage,2012-03-25T05:16Z,"@kshithij:

There is no such torrent on TPB"
,floryan13,2012-04-01T11:16Z,YKPJVSDPIT try this serial i have solve my problem...good luck
,lipak156,2012-04-14T19:44Z,guys dont waste time in downloading such a  crap software which doesnt work at all...no registration key available simply a trash
,ggaabc,2012-04-25T05:24Z,"The problem is, after successfully installing and patching with admin rights,
it works fine.
But as soon as the file size of log increases more than 145 mb, it says, the log viewer has stopped working. thats the only problem wid this version,
Hope they would be able to find solution for this problem :)  "

go here for v.3.8.9 if you want remote installation"
,jamiereichert,2012-05-26T18:45Z,took me a minute to download. read where to place the patch ahaha i didnt and got lost. but it works perfect for me. now to find out who my gf messages. i know she already cheats :(
,TuAmorCreador,2012-06-06T03:48Z,"So every time I try to download a Keylogger, Norton calls it a Trojan file. TROJAN, people. I know I'm supposed to disable my anti-virus protection or whatever, but it won't disable again because it had to process something so high-risk! DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY OF THESE KEYLOGGER PROGRAMS!!!!!"
,losfreddy,2012-06-28T21:32Z,"i cant seem to find ""program/game directory"" to place the patch in.  What is it under? Its annoying. im using windows 7.  Someone please guide me to the proper folder.  C drive what?"
,arphipps,2012-07-30T22:43Z,i am not good at all with computer things so if someone could explain how to do this it would help. i downloaded and installed the program but i am having a problem with the registration key. it says that mine is invalid each time. what do i type in?
,noia_2,2012-08-09T18:06Z,"Im getting ""Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library

This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information."" Any ideas?"
,lilmissy13,2012-08-10T12:30Z,"Thank you. Works like a charm. For the missing .dll I downloaded mine in http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr100
or I guess you can google one for yourself.

As for the trojan thing, well I had to disable AVG for at least 15 minutes to work on it.
And had to exempt it so it wouldn't be seen."
,lilmissy13,2012-08-10T12:33Z,Well there's a patch on the file that you can use so it can work even without serials.
