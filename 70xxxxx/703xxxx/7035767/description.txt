From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with the New York Times best-selling author, blogger, and survival retreat consultant James Wesley Rawles. His latest book, Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse, is available at the Infowars Store. Rawles is the editor of SurvivalBlog.com, a popular blog on survival and preparedness topics. The blog has been described as "the guiding light of the prepper movement." Rawles also authored the international bestseller How to Survive the End of the World as We Know It: Tactics, Techniques, and Technologies for Uncertain Times, a non-fiction book drawn primarily from posts featured on his blog. 

Alex also talks with British politician and outspoken critic of the European Union, Nigel Farage. He is the leader of the UK Independence Party and is a Member of the European Parliament. Farage also co-chairs the Europe of Freedom and Democracy group.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
