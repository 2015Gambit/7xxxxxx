The latest release from nighttime label 2to6 Records features fresh sounds from Kabayun, the solo project of up-and-coming American electronic musician David Mostoller.
Irresistibly danceable yet eternally nocturnal, Kabayun's first full-length album bridges the gap between psychedelic full-on and night music with funk and ease. Aptly named Journeys, it takes the listener on a series of synaesthesic voyages through soundscapes bound to cause self-induced auditory hallucinations and third-eye dilation. A unique fusion of powerful grooves with twisted sounds, this is a debut album not to be missed.
