         Every aspect of our lives involves pressure. It's what        
         puts the bubbles in soft drinks, propels shaving cream        
         from its can, cools the contents of your refrigerator,        
         and causes volcanoes to erupt. But when pressure suddenly     
         changes, you better look out! Rapid pressure changes can      
         be as violent as explosions. And variable atmospheric         
          pressure? We call that the weather.
