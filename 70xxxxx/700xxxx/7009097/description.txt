                                 Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frankie Dunn has trained and managed some incredible fighters during a lifetime 
spent in the ring. The most important lesson he teaches his boxers is the one 
that rules life: above all, always protect yourself. In the wake of a painful 
estrangement from his daughter, Frankie has been unwilling to let himself get 
close to anyone for a very long time. His only friend, Scrap, an ex-boxer who 
looks after Frankie's gym, knows that beneath his gruff exterior is a man who 
has been seeking, for the past 25 years, the forgiveness that somehow continues 
to elude him. Then Maggie Fitzgerald walks into his gym.

Goofs
Crew or equipment visible: When Frankie introduces Maggie to one of the managers 
at the gym, movie lights can be seen reflected in the sunglasses hanging on his 
shirt.
