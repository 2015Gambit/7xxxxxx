The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in New York City. First active from 1964 to 1973, 
their best-known members were Lou Reed and John Cale, who both went on to find success as solo artists. 
Although experiencing little commercial success while together, the band is often cited by many critics 
as one of the most important and influential groups of the 1960s. An often-repeated statement, usually 
attributed to Brian Eno or Peter Buck, is that "The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies 
but everyone who bought it formed a band.
