,gothbless,2012-02-21T05:09Z,Do i need Update 1 or i can go straight to Update 2?
,b1525680,2012-02-23T18:36Z,This update don't require previous updates installed to function properly.
,Raven_11,2012-03-07T01:16Z,Does it have all the fixes from Patch 1 is what I want to know :)  I run an AMD board with an ATI 6870 2GB?
,generalabuse,2012-03-12T09:34Z,"do i have to roll back the cracked exe from skidrow to the original exe, or just install this straight away?"
,tonivh666,2012-04-01T20:12Z,ThanKs SKIDROW. always a good job.
,Szalayman,2012-04-13T17:41Z,"thanks man, its really amazing,
 I just registered a new account to piratebay to write this comment:D "
,skulldragon,2012-04-13T23:43Z,"Yes, you don't need Update 1.
And yes, you don't need to roll back the EXEs.

I have AMD6950 2GB and latest CCC v12.3 I don't have any graphical problems. But I'm also running on XP x86.
Please leave settings in your CCC or in nVIDIAs cp as Default, because those are for ""power users"" and they will cause lag and anomalies due to GPU overheating if you don't know what you're doing. Just like they say that OCing is for OCers only."
,SteveDaMagicMan,2012-04-20T01:56Z,"Mine starts and goes to a black screen then I get ""Windows has encountered an error"" and it closes. Any solutions?"
,fallout11,2012-04-22T23:35Z,"Steve, that means you need to update your graphics card drivers (and possibly direct x). Had the same problem, new drivers solved it."
,SkallaEnSvan,2012-05-06T13:06Z,"YES!!! I Got it to work, fucking finally! 
Had that black screen coming up then the popup that said Rage has stopped working. I downloaded Skidrows update 1 and installed and copied the files to the folder. I saw this update and thought maybe I need this one too to make it work, but just started Rage now to see if it worked and it did:D:D:D:D::D::D:D You dont even need the update 2, just update 1 apparently. Now Im scared to try and install update 2:P So fuck it, if it crashes or has problems I will try to install update 2."
,VegitoDBZ,2012-06-20T00:13Z,Thanks for finally making this game playable. And guess what? It sucks.
,joise86,2012-07-08T04:30Z,do i need to install update 1 before i instal update 2?
,IzayaOrihara,2012-09-12T05:17Z,"You don't need to install update 1 before update 2, and you don't need to restore the rage exe back to original before patching.

Read above and you will clearly see other people already stated this."
