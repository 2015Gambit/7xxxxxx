From Wikipedia:

"Project 56 is a downloadable (free) demo album from the Canadian progressive house artist deadmau5. He has said on the networking website Myspace that "The idea back then was to do a thing called Project 56 which was 56 tracks for people with short attention spans. Instead of waiting years to finally throw it together, I figured I'd just toss it to everyone."[1] This album includes some tracks (be it or not in variant form) and elements that appear on the album Get Scraped."
