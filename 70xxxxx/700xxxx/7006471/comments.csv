,nob14,2012-02-04T13:07Z,Thanks
,TheNemmy,2012-02-05T09:26Z,"yup I can confirm this too, I've tried 4 scenarios so far, none of them could work, don't matter with class 390 or without, I'm deleting this route, I think scenario's crashes because of missing stuff, like class 118, buffers etc etc.

thanks tpb_4_ever, anyway, I will stick with other woodhead and ohio routes and will not download any new routes like this."

""To get this to work on the WCML North you need the HST Buffers pack installed. "" - posted by nob14

I give it a shot, I waited for download (the link will go to a RapidShare, wait once again for download, bla bla). It's a .rar ~ 74.2 MB. Just decompress and Copy Paste in installed game folder. 
With WCML and Class 390 installed, it should work. I just did (for the first time) some class 390 routes so it works.

Have fun."
,TheNemmy,2012-02-05T19:26Z,"hmmm, thanks will try that and report back . :)"
,TheNemmy,2012-02-05T22:44Z,"@brandiburu
yup man , that works but only for class 390 WCML scenarios no other scenario works"

,mr_ahmad,2012-02-06T18:31Z,can anyone upload the hst buffer pack here?
,monsmeg,2012-02-19T11:30Z,thanks for this download - haven't been able to run WCML North properly since the update - now all sweet!
,CB-man,2012-05-23T15:51Z,"I need help, this crashes when I load scenario, works perfectly in free roam. It just goes black and crashes."
