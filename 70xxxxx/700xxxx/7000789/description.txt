:: PLOT :: Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) is preparing for the holidays by visiting Santa at a shopping mall. Later on, the so-called "Santa" (Patton Oswalt) sells him marijuana in the mall's parking garage. Since being dumped by Vanessa (Danneel Harris), Kumar has let himself go by not pursuing a career as a doctor, poor hygiene and cleaning habits. He still lives in the messy apartment that he once shared with Harold Lee (John Cho), who has gone on to become a successful businessman on Wall Street. Harold's assistant, Kenneth (Bobby Lee), persuades him to buy a 3D television. As Harold and Kenneth leave the building, they are mobbed by angry citizens who throw eggs at them. Kenneth sacrifices himself in order to prevent Harold from being hit. Meanwhile, Vanessa visits Kumar and tells him that she's pregnant with his child, which shocks him. The two get into an argument and Vanessa leaves.
