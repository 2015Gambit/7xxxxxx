,General1825,2012-02-03T03:18Z,No need to be sorry.  I also noticed that Lifetime was slow to place it on their site.  Many thanks for the U/L.  It is downloading as I type.  Thanks !!

,zahur,2012-02-03T10:26Z,Thanks very much!
,thisispurx,2012-02-03T20:00Z,"Thanks for the UL!! I did notice Lifetime & my OnDemand provider have been taking at least 1-2 extra days after it airs for the first time to put it up on those 2 places as the season goes on. The first ep (and the 2nd *I think* were up that very night right after midnight) 

Thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!! I can not believe The Scene has not caught on to the popularity of this show yet!!"
,whmxtra,2012-02-03T22:13Z,"The Scene has caught on, they did most of season one then they just stopped. Not sure why but meantime I figured I'd fill the gap.

Not sure what's up with lifetime either, normally eps go up the next day, but lately it's taking a few days"
,whmxtra,2012-02-09T23:32Z,Episode 5 is now up here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7020788/dance.moms.s02e05.avi
