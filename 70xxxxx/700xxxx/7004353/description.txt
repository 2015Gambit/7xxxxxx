Feed Scrutiny your homepage URL and watch it follow internal links to find all of your pages and carry out checks from the same viewpoint as a search engine robot.

* It will check images, all internal and external links and report the server
  response code for each

* It will highlight problems with color and tell you which page(s) each
  bad link appears on

* It will list all of your pages and export this information as an XML
  sitemap conforming to the standard protocol for submission to search
  engines and optionally ftp it to your server

  software) to check your html validity

  description and keywords

  locally or import a list of links did exist in previous versions and was
  documented, but wasn't very accessible as it relied on a drag and drop
  into the starting url field (which still works and is to be improved in a
  future version)

  time
