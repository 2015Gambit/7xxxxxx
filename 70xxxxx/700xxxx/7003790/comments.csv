if its not too much trouble you should
Thanks !! "
,MacPain_,2012-02-02T20:30Z,"Thx for the upload nexus. I dont really think a summary is necessary. In the end of every episode you get a preview of the next one. And if your about to see it, why do you need a summary before? I'm also afraid of spoilers.. :P"

,Spyxz,2012-02-03T11:32Z,"Thanks for the upload. Awesome quality as always!

I wouldn't mind a summary, but only if you can keep it spoiler free. This way I can skip the spoilers, but still be excited when there are proper episodes."
,nexuswolf,2012-02-08T10:24Z,"Yes : 2
No  : 1

I will keep the Summary 80% Spoiler Free....I wil not reveal the main story of that episode ya know!!"
