,HAAJHA,2012-02-04T00:52Z,"Sorry for the missing picture and information about the torrent. TPB are upgrading their software at the moment, so I guess something went wrong during this upload. Also, because of this, I'm not able to edit and correct the information, since editing has been temporarily disabled. I'll fix it all up when they're fully back up.

A lot of people are trying to download this right now, so I'm asking you to please take a moment to help out and seed this. "
,carcas72,2012-02-04T12:41Z,Thanks again. Hope you will continue to upload these episodes :-)
,HAAJHA,2012-02-04T18:48Z,@carcas72 No problem! I'll upload all eight episodes as NRK airs them. S01E03 will be up Wednesday night/Thursday morning Norwegian time. :)

,HAAJHA,2012-02-07T23:47Z,"@gotti9000 Well, actually no. The title clearly says ""...NorSub"" as in ""Norwegian Subtitles""."
