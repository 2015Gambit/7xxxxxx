         The second part of City Slickers begins after the        
         death of Curly. It is the 40th birthday of Mitch         
         Robbins and the day begins quite good until he           
         returns home and finds his brother Glen,                 
         the black sheep of the family, in his sofa.              
         Nevertheless he is about to have a wonderful             
         birthday-night with his wife when he discovers a         
       treasure map of Curly by chance.                        
      Together with Phil and unfortunately with Glen           
      he tries to find the hidden gold of Curly's               
      father in the desert of Arizona instead of               
      attending a meeting in Las Vegas.
