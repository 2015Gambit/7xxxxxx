When Crusoe is washed up alone on a desert island, he manages to retrieve a quantity of stores and tools from the shipwreck and begins his struggle to survive. In absorbing detail he records how he builds a house, explores the island and first encounters other human beings. Defoe's gripping tale celebrates his hero's energy and inventiveness and leads us to compare a life of simplicity and solitude with the world of civilization and society.
