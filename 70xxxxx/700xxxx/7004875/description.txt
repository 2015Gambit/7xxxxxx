                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 Jonathan Maitland investigates what is being done to crack down on the rise in 
 the theft of metal, which is costing the British economy an estimated 1billion a 
 year. Raids on power substations have doubled in the past 12 months, passengers 
 have had their rail journeys disrupted and hospital generators have been targeted 
 - forcing doctors to cancel operations.
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
