,Dwch,2012-02-04T00:11Z,"Sample checks out in terms of quality...

I haven't seen the movie yet, so I wasn't sure if it's even the right movie (there was no Meryl Streep in the sample)... It looked like the right movie though, the sample featuring some scenes with a younger 'Margaret Roberts' played by someone else.

I'll post again once I've downloaded the whole thing, but I'm optimistic about this one! As far as the sample goes, the quality was great for a screener."

,Dwch,2012-02-04T09:10Z,"Just skimmed through... it's definitely legit. Not only that, but it looks like a really good rip! Definitely sourced from DVD. Good audio level and perfect sync from what I could tell. Considering the file size (700mb), I'd definitely give it A:10 V:10.
The only thing preventing it from being identical to a straight up DVD rip is a small watermark ('property of...') which appears at the top of the screen from time to time.

Thank you HeroMaster and TARGET."
