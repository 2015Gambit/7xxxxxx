Synopsis: St. Vladimirâ€™s Academy isnâ€™t just any boarding schoolâ€”itâ€™s a hidden place where vampires are educated in the ways of magic and half-human teens train to protect them. Rose Hathaway is a Dhampir, a bodyguard for her best friend Lissa, a Moroi Vampire Princess. Theyâ€™ve been on the run, but now theyâ€™re being dragged back to St. Vladimirâ€™sâ€”the very place where theyâ€™re most in danger... Rose and Lissa become enmeshed in forbidden romance, the Academyâ€™s ruthless social scene, and unspeakable nighttime rituals. But they must be careful lest the Strigoiâ€”the worldâ€™s fiercest and most dangerous vampiresâ€”make Lissa one of them forever.
