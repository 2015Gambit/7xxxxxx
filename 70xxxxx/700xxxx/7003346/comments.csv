[V],bubanee,2012-02-02T21:10Z,"Cheers all... 
Yeah zoso i noticed that the vultures flocked onto it and retagged... one of the reasons why i don't do new releases no more.. i even got sick of some release groups doing it as well and plus all the dickheads who host my shit with passwords.. normally i'll wait for scene myself these days... but i had to have this though lol...

,XLC1200,2012-02-03T08:30Z,VAN-TASTIC. THANK YOU!!
,fmj77,2012-02-03T09:25Z,Thanks for the upload. This is the best music VH has put out since their early stuff. Almost sounds like VH I and VH II.
,waxlrose,2012-02-06T05:37Z,"Thanks for the upload! I got it just out of curiosity. I hated the single when I first heard it, but it's grown on me. Then I heard a few samples on the VH Facebook page and they caught my attention. I thought to myself, ""This might just be a decent album..."" I was WRONG. This album is AWESOME! If anyone tries to tell you any different, remind them that there's a lot of nostalgia tied to those classic songs that any new song can't replace. Some of us were careless children when the old DLR/VH albums came out, some of us were just discovering girls and going on our first dates and life was great... that stuff was the soundtrack to some of our greatest memories. Now, with that said, this album could have come out during that era and held it's own with the best of VH. The playing is top-notch, Eddie's on fire... Dave's Dave, and that's all we've ever wanted. Wolfgang is holding his own (even though EVH is probably playing bass a lot on the album) and Alex is doing what he's always done, keeping everything nailed down. This album is a 10. Get it... then go buy it when it's released."
