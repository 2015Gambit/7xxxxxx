,roines1987,2012-03-27T06:43Z,"gameboygamer for other players to play your save game you have to additionally put out your xlive folder
C:Users%username%AppDataLocal Microsoft and copy the XLive folder.

for players to get it working you need 
C:Users%username%DocumentsWB GamesBatman Arkham City and paste just the SaveData folder
and
C:Users%username%AppDataLocal Microsoft and paste the XLive folder here
.
when you start the game you have to logout of your own profile.
you need to use the uploaders profile name (to find the profile name just click delete profiles, there you will see aditional profile name besides yours, remember it and sign in with it)
and you are good to go. worked for me :)"
