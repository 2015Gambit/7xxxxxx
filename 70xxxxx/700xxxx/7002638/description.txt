The method of encoding that i have used is compatible for all android phones as long you have installed Rockplayer,MoboPlayer, MX VideoPlayer or similar application. Movie has been cropped
and resized to achieve maximum full screen Landscape display with overall quality, amazing smooth frame rate with synchronized audio and video 
without any problems. [color=Green]Subtitles[/color] you can download them from here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-236/ or http://subscene.com/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Fellowship-of-the-Ring/subtitles-63136.aspx/, for using them
just create one folder in your SD Card for example "movie" and put the video (*.mkv) and the subtitle (*.srt must be renamed same like the movie) file of your desireble language in the same folder
and play the movie. To display the correct text on the movie in the subtitle folder you will see a text file "RockPlayer Subtitles Region". To 
choose the region on RockPlayer open the application and go to settings -> "Select Encode Mode" and select the code for your country region. The same settings are for all Video players
