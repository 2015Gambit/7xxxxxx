[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-02T12:55Z,"The best media player you can get for Mac or Windows is VLC media player. It is free to download and will play literally any file! 
I am not to happy with this upload of mine. I am very regretful. I have a much better quality one now and it is a few minutes longer too. I will upload it after TOWIE arrives and some seeds are on that."

[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-02T13:49Z,"You're welcome :)
I should be uploading that better quality version in the next 24 hours if you don't want to get VLC, but I really recommend you do get it. It is an awesome player. Just Google it. It is free to download and takes only a couple of minutes to install."
