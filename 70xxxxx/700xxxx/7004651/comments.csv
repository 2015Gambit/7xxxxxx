[V],globeplus,2012-02-02T23:14Z,"Hi gamers ! 

This file is an acumulate of nice work in both left 4 Dead games and everybody knows that they are from the best games of the zombies type and after all the necessary work and check of the full playability of the single player modes i decided that it is a series that deserves a nice autorun interface to launch both games , i hope all of you like it because the work was really the best possible under the circunstances and both games running without any problems , guarantee !!! , i have to say this because specially after the very tough cracking task on the 2nd game the users started answer themselves : is any file ok available out there without russian configurations and crashing to the desktop all the time ? , ok i think many users out there remember this episode about this game but never mind now , everything ok both games no doubt for 2.09 gb ... happy gaming ."
[V],globeplus,2012-02-02T23:22Z,"Hi , this new comment is to make reference to the next detail :

- the file is only 2.09 gb to download but after the games beeing ready to play , the autorun folder with the games get 10.1 gb in total after a close 15 minutes work in total .


enjoy ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-02-03T12:32Z,"To paritdada : yes , it will work just find the correct folder to put them or move the entire folder to the correct place , it will work no doubt !!!"
,Pink_Taco,2012-02-03T13:10Z,when i run the left for dead auto run it says unregistered compiler do  not redistribute and i click on ok nothing happens if i click on a game it starts and crashes with not responding check online for solutions to no avail i have win 7 X64 8gb ram quad 3.0ghz 2gb video card what is wrong? 
[V],globeplus,2012-02-03T15:49Z,"To paritdada : you need to use the freeware FREEARC to extract the arc file and it is needed close 1 gb ram to make the extraction correctly , so donÂ´t use too much aplications at the same time of the arc extraction , the ideal is to restart the computer and start the arc extarction without making anything else and normally the instructions.txt have a reference about the time to the arc exrtraction of the file , the console window need to keep going on the screen with naturality until all the files are extracted ... good luck to you and PLEASE calm down now with the game , you need the necessary patience to have everything correct before playing , follow the instructions and no panic what so ever , go doing the necessary tasks with the instructions help and it will be ok ."
[V],globeplus,2012-02-03T17:51Z,"To paritdada : you need all the available ram no doubt and luck maybe , the console window with the conversion needs to keep going until the work finished message , i am not shore but maybe 30 to 40 minutes but the console window must be going probably never closing until the work done !!! Good luck ."

,xlevelx,2012-02-08T16:47Z,"To Paritdada... I've read your comments, and they reek to being that of an immature child. 

Left 4 Dead is an awesome game, but I strongly suggest you get more education. 

Learn to be respectful to others. Learn how to say please and thank you instead of behaving like a spoiled brat.

I also suggest you learn to be clear, concise, and to the point instead of wasting so much space in your posts. 

As it is, you (also) seem to be somewhat illiterate. You'll get further in life with an education. Learn how to spell please. There's an ""a"" in that word.

Finally, feel free to bombard me with all the profanity you want. It'll just reinforce what I'm saying. 

Enjoy the game, because that's what it is... a game."

,ram789,2012-02-09T04:58Z,@paritdada First go and learn english u Motherfucker 
,crni123,2012-02-09T20:03Z,"@paritdada stop acting like a retarded kid , and go too school and LEARN ENGLISH ok? feel free to kill me with insults."
[V],globeplus,2012-02-10T23:46Z,"To crni123 : i made it a rip at that time of the launching of the game and the best possible was close 4 gb with the 3 first chapters then the users download in their own time chapter by chapter until get the all 12 levels i think of the totality of the game , was the best possible this kind of work because the main archives of the game was heavy archives already with great compression and wasnÂ´t impossible without removing data any work on the levels , at that moment of the uploading the answer of the users was positive but not entirely positive as i expect because the unformal way that the file was presented beside the fact that the users with nice net was happy because in the meantime while downloading the 4 gb main file with the first 3 chapters they getted enough time to get in the sharing services links the other levels and at the time of finish the main file already 7,8 or 9 levels was download and certainly giving time while playing the first chapters to download the remaining ones but this worked to the nice net users , the others with more trouble of course get complications with problems in the middle of the big size heavy archives download with 700 mb to more than a giga for level or something and not easy then , the true is that under the real difficulty in working the heavy compressed archives the best pratical way was that one but of course not really pratical for everyone and it was the only game that i followed this method for experience and this happen after i discovered that all the levels was independent himselfs from each other that means that you can play only level 1 without having any of the other levels on the game folder and so on for all the levels , it was at that moment in time a nice curiosity that i tried to explore more as possible becaise the really difficultys in getting the pratical files because the heavy archives i am sorry now because i donÂ´t have it anymore as i know and that game it was a very tough example of ripping  , so better in that case to download the complete iso of the game , thank you for your comment and i hope that you in some time with patience get your file and in that case happy gaming to you ... see you ..."
,ram789,2012-02-11T11:28Z,hey globe any chance of u ripping L.A.Noire or @paritdada's mom for instance

Lol That was a good comment.....This guy needs to learn to have patience and not spam.....A Decent Guy is one who can get his message through to others without abusing them.....So clearly, he is not one. He should get a life and a decent education."
