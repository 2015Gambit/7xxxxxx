Plot: The movie is about a group of three adult cousins, Marley, Brad and Abby Hoffman that raise their socially challenged cousin Jessicka. She is treated as a dog, including locking her up in a cage, feeding her in a bowl, spraying her down for a bath, walking her around with a collar and leash. Not only that but they also treat her as their sex slave to do with her what they please when they please. Brad uses her to star in a porno, and to perform fellatio on himself, Marley pounds her doggy (pun intended), and Abby even gets in on the action with the help of a jar of peanut butter. One day Jessicka is bitten by their rabid dog and contracts rabies. Eventually she becomes rabid herself and takes it out on her masters.
