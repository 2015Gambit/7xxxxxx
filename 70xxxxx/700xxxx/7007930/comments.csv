,Fraya9,2012-02-15T21:30Z,@end77: No Christian Slater is likely just playing against type in this to prevent himself from getting typecasted (locked into certain roles) in the bigger budget stuff.

 For only being about 1hr30min it sure felt a lot longer lol, it started off ok but steadily goes down hill from there. Nothing scary about it either and they don't even try to toss in any typical jumpy surprises."
