,Revisionist,2012-02-04T23:38Z,thx for the tip lazarov.  i think people who rate things 10/10 must be watching stuff on their phones.

Just skimmed through the movie... it's actually a really good rip! Definitely sourced from DVD. Good audio level and perfect sync from what I could tell. Considering the file size (700mb), I'd definitely give it A:10 V:10.
The only thing preventing it from being identical to a straight up DVD rip is a small watermark ('property of...') which appears at the top of the screen from time to time.

Thank you TvTeam and TARGET. "
