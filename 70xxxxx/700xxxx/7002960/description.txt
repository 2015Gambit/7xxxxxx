As simulation techniques become more prominent within the financial community, a thorough understanding of the theory behind, and implementation of, those techniques is critical for those involved in portfolio management, risk management, pricing, and other essential financial activities.
Created by the expert author team of Keith Allman, Josh Laurito, and Michael Loh, Financial Simulation Modeling in Excel contains valuable theoretical insights as well as practical exercises that will help you transform financial concepts into dynamic, usable models. And because simulation has its place in many different parts of finance, this well-rounded resource takes you step by step through the process of creating multiple, smaller modelsâ€”using MicrosoftÂ® ExcelÂ® and VBAâ€”as opposed to a single unified model.

Each section begins with a discussion of theoryâ€”with enough background and mathematical formulas provided to reinforce the concept coveredâ€”and then moves on to a Model Builder exercise where the theory is transferred to an application in MicrosoftÂ® ExcelÂ®. Along the way, this accessible guide:

Works through random number generation, explains Brownian motion, and explores correlation between variables with specific examples

Takes you through simulating interest rate paths to price bonds

Creates a corporate default simulation based on structural and reduced form models

Provides a thorough look at simulating pools of assets

Addresses data deficiencies and how to manage data as it relates to a simulation

Complete with a companion website that contains information including Model Builder files, this book is an essential guideâ€”for both seasoned professionals and those new to the world of financial simulation modelingâ€”to understanding the intricacies of this discipline and excelling at it.
