CrashSerious releases FactoryServiceMode Tool v0.1. With this application, Jailbroken
PS3 Consoles no longer need the assistance of a JIG device in order to get into
Factory/Service Mode. This means that one will be able to downgrade their consoles with
ease, simply by running a PKG installed to their XMB. Also, this is another way to access
and play around with Factory/Service mode. Again, this tool has been created using the
open source PS1Light and 100% legal code.
