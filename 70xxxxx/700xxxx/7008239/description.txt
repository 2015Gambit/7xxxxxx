Information

They have existed for over 225 million years, and long after we are gone, they will continue to create new forms that will occupy every conceivable ecological niche. Their ability to adapt is one of evolution\'s success stories. Their diversity is phenomenal; their biomass, colossal. By themselves, they represent 80% of all living species; their weight exceeds that of all mammals put together. They are the inventors of paper, sonar, air conditioning, chemical warfare, pharmacology, and specialized workers.
