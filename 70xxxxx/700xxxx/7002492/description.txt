Release Title Caddyshack 1980 BDRip 1080p x264 AAC - KiNGDOM
Directed By: Harold Ramis
Storyline Comical goings on at an exclusive golf club. All the members are wealthy and eccentric, and all the staff are poor and slightly less eccentric. The main character is 'Danny'; he's a caddy who will do almost anything to raise money to go to college.
There are many subplots, including the assistant green keeper's pursuit of a cute (obviously stuffed) gopher.
