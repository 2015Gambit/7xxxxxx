note:

The Tyree track Turn Up The Bass (Super Duper Mix) has a time flaw that existed in the original vinyl pressing. Around the halfway mark there is a drop but the music re-enters out of time. Modern computer software can beat match the two badly joined edits. If anyone is interested in fixing this then go ahead because that timing flaw spoils what is essentially a great dance track and the best version of the various remixes of this track.
