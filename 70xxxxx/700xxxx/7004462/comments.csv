,Bubbers83,2012-02-02T23:53Z,"So here's a thought for everyone...whatever happened to the days when comic books influenced television and movies, and not vice versa?

I read on some website that one of DC's reasons for the whole revamp was to make their comics more easily transferable to the small and silver screens.

Are Comics just basically commercials and advertisements now for their media products? Heck The first our superman movies and the Michael Keaton Batman movies were the best ones so far (except for the Dark Knight). And those were based pretty much off of the comics, as they were."
