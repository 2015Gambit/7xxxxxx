Notes: This was and is one of my favorite movies, maybe because I was the right age when it came out :) 
I have been trying to find a good rip or a DVD-R of this, and failed. Then I started looking for where
I could buy the DVD, but it turns out it\'s out of stock everywhere and probably not being produced anymore. 
So then I tracked down a used copy of the DVD, and here it is :)
I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
