The battle to find the supreme Sekirei continues. Still some of the fighters and their masters refuse to participate in the battle since losing it means to lose the Sekirei forever, and many of them actually care about their partners, while others just use them as tools. A storm is rising on the horizon, a bigger threat approaches the city and it's about to bring pain and suffering to those who love and care for their Sekireis. 

This is the second season in the Sekerei series. Quality isn't quite as good as the first season, but its still pretty damn good. I hope everyone enjoys!

Please Seed!
