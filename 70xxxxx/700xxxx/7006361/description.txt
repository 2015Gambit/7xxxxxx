Loosely based on the rivalry of tobacco tycoons Washington Duke and George McElwee, Bright Leaf follows tenant farmer Brant Royle (Gary Cooper) who returns home after his family is driven from their farm by fellow farmer Major Singleton (Donald Crisp). Royle and Singleton battle each other for their respective empires.

The film, one of many epic melodramas produced by Hollywood at the time, was widely forgotten after its first theatrical release in 1950. Bright Leaf found new life in 2003, when it played prominently in the documentary Bright Leaves, by filmmaker Ross McElwee, a descendant of the man whose life was reflected in both the novel and film.
