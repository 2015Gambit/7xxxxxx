,Assassinprofessor,2012-02-05T12:51Z,"it took me 1 week to download FF III-2...it seems the same shite is repeating with Darkness 2,..dloadind 1.2 kbs and uploading 400kbs..what's fair anyway"
,fallengun04,2012-02-05T15:02Z,"@RolandoMota4U No. All you need to have is LT 3.0 , iHas Burners , DVD+R DL and your choice of burning software (imgburn or CloneCD) but if you have LT 2.0, You should apply this patch: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0_

This patch will also work on Kingdoms of Amalur:Reckoning, FF XIII-2 and Soul Calibur.As for NeverDead, Many people are still having a problem with that game.Best is to wait another scene release of that game. Enjoy!"
,GHFear3,2012-02-05T18:42Z,Hey! =] I just connected my drive to my computer and I was about to upgrade to 3.0.... BUT I have like 20 other XGD3 games... and if I upgrade I won't be able to play them... :(   Is it worth it? or should I get another xbox360 and put the 3.0 FW on that one?
,jaki54321,2012-02-05T19:54Z,"Ok guys, it seems some people are having problems so I will try an sum it up for yall:

Ok, make sure you have LT 3.0+ flashed to your disk drive. If your drive does not yet support LT 3.0+, it may not be possible to play this yet on your drive... You can try tho if you want to. Jus make sure you have the latest for your drive. The description of the torrent says LT+ 2.0 is compatible... It is compatible but I am uncertain if it needs patching or not. I would patch it anyway tho =/ 

Download the latest version of ABGX360 to your computer. Open it and select the Darkness 2 ISO file. Now before starting, check these settings:

Go to the Options tab, and check off ""Check/create dvd file"", ""Check Stealth"", ""Verify if stealth passes"", ""Check for updates"", and ""Check Game Partition CRC if needed"".

Now go to the Autofix tab and select, ""Level 2 - Autofix if stealth is uncertain and fails verification"". This will patch your game with the Topology data tat u need to play it. Make sure ""Trust SS v2 angles"", ""Fix C/R Table if data is invalid"", and ""adjust angles that deviate more than >3< degrees from their CCRT targets"" are all checked off. Dont adjust anything else.

Now hit the pretty blue LAUNCH button on the bottom. Everything should work as planned.. Once its done, read it over an make sure everything worked ok. The colors should indicate a problem(such as yellow or red). After you run it the first time, run it again to see if the problems are still there. If not, your good to go!

To burn the ISO: Get IMGburn and select the DVD file. You shouldnt have to adjust the DVD DL layer break because the DVD file has it specified(dont believe me? Open the DVD file in wordpad xD). Pop in a DVD+DL(preferable Verbatim) and set it to its burn speed. Hit burn. A message may appear sayin that the file is too big for the disk and tat u have 2 options. Select Truncate. Continue burning and have fun =D If anyone has questions feel free to reply."
,RolandoMota4U,2012-02-05T21:25Z,"@Fallengun04 i know i meant other than the dl dvds and common sense stuff, i see a lot of people asking how to play on lt 2 and i dont get why they dont upgrade to lt 3 yes i know you are going to not be able to play some of you older games (xgd3) but most of the newer games are going to be xgd3 so might as well take the leap now and stop adding to the collection of games that are not going to work when you do update eventually....but either way good luck to everyone!"

,fallengun04,2012-02-08T07:18Z,"Using the abgx 1.0.6 is not recommended for those who have LT 2.0 because it will put the topology data for LT 3.0. If you dont have LT 3.0, It is recommended to use abgx 1.0.5 as it doesn't put the topology data.Using the abgx 1.0.6 after putting the patch for games to work on LT 2.0 will only bring it back to normal and will be only playable to LT 3.0 so u need to patch it again.

Here's a tutorial to burn this game or the other new games (XGD3):

1.If you have LT 2.0,Apply these patch 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0
(For LT3.0 users, skip this step. This patch will let you play the new games that has the topology data injected for LT 3.0)

2.Open Imgburn (must be the latest version 2.5.6.0) and go to Tools>Settings>Write. Now select Calculate Optimal if you have the iHas burner and User Specified for those who doesnt have the iHas burner and will use the truncate method.If u select User Specified, write 2086912.
(If the game you have is XGD2, the layerbreak should be 1913760.)

3.Now close the settings and select write image file to disc

4.Load the your .dvd file 

(Be sure to check your dvd file if it has the right layerbreak.If you have the iHas burner and selected the Calculate Optimal, the layerbreak in the dvd file should be 2133520.)

5.Now if you have the iHas burner, select the advanced settings (located on the lower right part). Choose the LITEON tab and enable Force HT,Online HT and SmartBurn.Disable the OverSpeed.(If you dont have the iHas Burner, skip this step)

6. You are ready to burn!"
,wwatra,2012-02-09T15:09Z,playeble on LT 2.0 but cant install game on HDD.. install broke on 20-41%..help??
,jasonismoney,2012-02-09T20:00Z,"@wwatra, you say you got it working on 2.0. I noticed the topology data with the original .dvd file, so I know it needs to be patched. My question is - did you simply burn after patching, or did you re-run the file through abgx and create a new .dvd file before burning?"
,jasonismoney,2012-02-09T20:01Z,"Also, did you get it to run without a title update?"
,wwatra,2012-02-09T21:04Z,"jasonismoney

,galaca,2012-02-12T14:25Z,Funciona em LT+2.0. Basta inserir o patch do FF12-2 e gravar em truncated pelo imgburn. Boa jogatina aos brasileiros

      BUY NEW GEAR.  Get a new router, take your modem back to Comcast, Charter, Verizon, whoever you use, and ask for the newest modem EVERY year.

Get off your lame computer, take the money that you are NOT spending on these games, and upgrade or build a GAMING computer. The newer and faster, the better, and that WILL effect your Downloading speeds.
@boobsman and all who respect this great community,
     thank you so much for what you do. It helps some people weed through the crap that gets released...  devs that create great games get my money, that is the way I work.   PB rules, and we all need to respect the people who put their ass on the line to get us this stuff...  game on."

if you turnicate disc you got messege failed to authorize and disc not suported,my  recomendation,flash your xbox with LT 3.0,and burn games with IHAS burnmax fmw burner with verbatim disc on 2.4x and everthing will be working 100%.when you turnicate disc ,disc is 97% writes,wiht ihas burner is 100% and no messeges.."
