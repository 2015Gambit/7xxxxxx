The Darkness 2 RF XBOX360-XPG 

The Darkness II takes players down a brutal and personal path as Jackie Estacado, wielder of The 
Darkness an ancient and ruthless force of chaos and destruction. Based on the supernatural horror 
comic book series created by Top Cow Productions, Inc., The Darkness II breaks out of the sea of 
conventional first-person shooters with its fervid Quad-Wielding gameplay, which will allow players 
to slash, grab, and throw objects and enemies with their Demon Arms while simultaneously firing two 
weapons. 

The game is layered with the use of dark versus light, steeped in deep and twisted storytelling, 
and engulfed in stylistic violence that is visualized through a hand-paintedgraphic noir technique that 
stays true to its comic book origins. It s been two years since JackieEstacado, now the Don of the 
Franchetti crime family, used The Darkness to kill the men responsible for his girlfriend s murder. 
He s been unable to shake the memory of Jenny s death since bottling up his supernatural power, and 
now The Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack on Jackie s life heralds the start of a full
scale mob war, which has clearly been orchestrated by some outside force. The botched attempt opens 
the door for The Darkness to reemerge, and sets Jackie on a journey to hell and worse, as he unravels 
the mystery behind the attack and the motivations of The Darkness itself.
