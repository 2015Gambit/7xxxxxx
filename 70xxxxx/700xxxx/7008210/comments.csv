,DSDO,2012-02-04T15:07Z,"It's because you should click on ""get torrent file"" and not ""get this torrent"" (I don't know why but for me it's like that for every torrent since a few days)"
,KingRaven,2012-02-04T16:40Z,"@DSDO,
Yes , actually I am downloading it currently. The problem is that it is quite slow, not much seeders :(
Looking forward what is the quality though...."

As for this torrent:

A/V - Great, excellent, no complaints here.

Movie - Very disappointing.  The story felt very familiar, like something I had seen before, with minor alterations.  I wouldn't recommend."
