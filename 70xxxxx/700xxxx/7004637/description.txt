OFFICIAL RELEASE [320k MP3]

This show has a unique opening sequence of "Mountain Jam">"Donâ€™t Want You No More">"Itâ€™s Not My Cross to Bear">"Ainâ€™t Wastinâ€™ Time No More" that is worth the price of admission. The band doesnâ€™t stop there, of course, and Warren really takes off on "Good Morning Little Schoolgirl" and "Hoochie Coochie Man," which may be because he warmed up by playing the entire opening act set with moe. The owners of the Todd Bodine #30 NASCAR truck with the ABB logo were in attendance, and the band showed their gratitude with a classic setlist, featuring plenty of old favorites like "Donâ€™t Keep Me Wonderinâ€™" and "One Way Out." The "Liz Reed>Mountain Jam" set closer is a great finale.
