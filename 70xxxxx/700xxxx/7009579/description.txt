7 Albums in true lossless quality. Downloaded in flac and converted to ALAC. None of them are transcoded from shitty mp3's.
This is my first real torrent so if I'm fucking something up, feel free to tell me how stupid I am and what I should have done instead.
Also, its like 4gb. At least make an effort to seed? My upload isn't bad, but my computer is; it will probably crash. And it will probably take me 15-20 minutes to start seeding again.
