,gymjim,2012-02-04T20:14Z,"Very slow download, please seed."
,Pailun,2012-02-04T20:59Z,Good download Thx
,Lwiramad,2012-02-05T07:36Z,"Beautiful download, thank you! A10 V10 Re: comment about 'Meryl Streep Looks terrible' - ignorant! While this film has no merit as a historical document, it is worthy as a personal story of aging. If you can separate it from anything you know about the real Margaret Thatcher, you can enjoy the performances."
,Dwch,2012-02-05T09:43Z,"Just skimmed through... it's a really good rip! Definitely sourced from DVD. Good audio level and perfect sync from what I could tell. Considering the file size (700mb), I'd definitely give it A:10 V:10.
The only thing preventing it from being identical to a straight up DVD rip is a small watermark ('property of...') which appears at the top of the screen from time to time.

Thank you LegendET and TARGET. "
