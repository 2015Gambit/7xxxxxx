,krobanit,2012-02-02T20:48Z,"Paradox expansions are all self-contained .exe files. They run like large patches, basically. I've just downloaded this myself and it's legit. "
,cgidragon,2012-02-02T20:55Z,"The game works, but i had to change the install folder to where i have already installed the original game.
Thanks for the upload."

,issnerol,2012-02-03T17:37Z,"Jakeler, Icetgamer,

This ocurried with too. So I downloaded the file in dllfiles.com, but then more two dll were missing. I downloaded them and put in Vic 2 folder, however another error appeared: ""MSVCR100.DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or contains an error..."". Please if anyone know how to solve, help."
,_Necross_,2012-02-03T19:39Z,No seeds/peers. How do you download this thing?
,mucgoo,2012-02-03T21:49Z,Elef's compiled vicky 2 2.1 install is only 250MB so its probably easiest to just download that and reinstall.
,montofon,2012-02-03T23:00Z,"The ""lua51.dll is missing"" error happens when you install it in the default location. It has to be installed on top of your victoria 2 installation.
(normally C:\Program Files\Paradox Interactive\Victoria 2)"
,_Necross_,2012-02-03T23:17Z,This version can't be patched with paradox patches.
,Critical,2012-02-06T19:58Z,What Paradox patch? The 2.1 is the lastest for AHD.
,MarniXL,2012-05-10T18:40Z,No one knows how you can get the new patch?
,jjalex,2012-09-06T19:26Z,Anyone can get the patch using the game launcher.
