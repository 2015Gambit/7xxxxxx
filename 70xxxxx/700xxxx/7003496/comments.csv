[T],MsFenmore,2012-02-02T12:26Z,sorry again...itÂ´s a little out of sync...like it always happens when I have to get the show from another source than the one I usually use...! Hope that doesnÂ´t happen to often!!
,panamalynn,2012-02-02T12:43Z,Thank you so much.  Out of sync is better than not getting it at all.
