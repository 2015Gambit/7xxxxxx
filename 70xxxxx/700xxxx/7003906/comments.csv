and i7 4 core.4 threads HP Laptop and a ACER travelmate
dual core dou (although its much slower on that one
when playing games but it still works) ideal 1024x700 graphics
so you wont strain your eyes like watch a phone :)
remember its a phone running on windows so you treat
the mouse as if its a finger for dragging sliding and tapping!
HOME key is for home and ESC is back and cursors
can move pages and selections and space to select i think
or was it Enter. special functions like CTL-F1 and F4 dont work
in this build"

while slept.. utorrent slowed it as it reached my
first data share cap.. should be almost seeded out
now as given it some more data!
geeh only 6 hours sleep :* going back to bed :/



i put some aussie sytle pokers on this image for those australians out there
they are a bit better then the pc ones I think but may be slow if
not got fast lappy or pc to run virtualised!

great for testing apps that arent arm specific or needing
sensors but you can use web based chat soft on it
thats for android only too"

Thnx 4 the up."
[V],psspss,2012-02-04T08:49Z,"some having net issues will not be this iso 
but vmware or pc or firewall etc setup

without the net will make it harder and less fun.. you wont be
able to peer connect to NAS or windows pcs or the host pc or other phones
via the lan/wifi and grab and share apps :)

shared folder arent working.. but im sure someone will come out with a new iso build with it and more fixes in time but for now this is good
as gold.

to trouble shoot vmware network try this link

other useful links

and

try their main site ,.. you can get other older isos 2.3 etc
live cds that work on various old laptops
outside VM
http://www.android-x86.org/

but I like vmware as you can run xp and android in vmware at same time
and use windows 7 for main host like im doing :)

and its still flipping fast as !"
[V],psspss,2012-02-04T08:53Z,"also check your firewall something simple can stuff things up

for bridge to work remember your need to provide it a ip
normally your home lan has a router doing that out of the box

nat shares the ip with host pc so both use the same lan card
that way nat in vmware has its own dhcp setup i normally leave
it on the defaults.. but you can go to the network prefs
and do a restore defaults

i find sometimes installing other problems like Virtualbox
messes it up

and I find virutalbox and vmware arent aware of each other
both can install their filter drive in each others filter driver
so check properties and untick it if its listed in vmwares
bridge driver.

reboot after"

,style89,2012-07-29T13:34Z,works great on core 2 duo .....just increase the setting memory to 2gb and give the  2 cores of processor  
[V],psspss,2012-09-22T14:29Z,"vmware has banned virtual android and refuse to
make a sharedfolder tools..


someone on the forum may of written a addon hack by now since this is old now

if you read what i said,. you use the apps
preinstalled to share windows shares

samba as its called.

works same as vmware tools sharing"
