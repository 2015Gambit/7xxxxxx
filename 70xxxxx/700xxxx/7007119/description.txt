City kid Ren MacCormack moves to a small town where rock â€˜nâ€™ roll and 
dancing have been banned, and his rebellious spirit shakes up the populace. 
A few years prior, the community was rocked by a tragic accident that killed 
five teenagers after a night out and Bomontâ€™s local councilmen and the beloved Reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) responded by implementing ordinances that 
prohibit loud music and dancing.
