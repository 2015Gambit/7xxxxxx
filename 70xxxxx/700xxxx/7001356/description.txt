It's Hood Day on the streets of Los 
Angeles, and Captain Rucker (guest star 
Carl Lumbly) has the department playing 
hall monitors. Sammy lets old grudges die 
hard when he leaves a gang territory 
unattended, only to have a violent gang 
war erupt throughout the city. Ben's 
recent mistake continues to haunt him 
publicly everywhere he goes. Ruben (guest 
star Dorian Missick) practices his speech 
for his daughter's quinceaera in the 
midst of a murder investigation. Cooper 
and Tang investigate a robbery in a 
strict Orthodox Jewish home, leading Tang 
to reveal parts of her past.
