[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-05T16:58Z,in case everyone hasn't found it there is also a movie called Agnes Browne note the e on the end of her name it stars Anjelica Houston and one or two of the stars from the series it is a much younger version of Mrs Browns Boys and might be entertaining i am downloading it at the moment it can be found on Demonoid and Btjunkie if anyone is interested

V-4
Its like watching an old VHS tape, how it is so poor coming from a HDTV BBC One HD rip, idk...
Unwatchable"
[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-07T01:10Z,hey popeye might i suggest a trip to the opticians looks like your really in need of it
,popeye013,2012-02-07T06:39Z,"Nope, not in need of that, however you are in need of lessons on how to encode video content as you can't do it to save your life. 
The comment still stands, its like watching an old VHS tape, so go find TvTeams upload, its far superior quality and you can watch it without the feel of a screen covered in cream."
[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-07T10:58Z,"hey popeye seem to have read a couple of complaints on the other torrent made by you, and what have you done for the filesharing population nothing but take and complain as far as i can see, why don't you do us all a favour and copy Btjunkie and volutarily shut yourself down, the only difference will be they will be missed you won't, and thats my last word on this"
,lemonexit,2012-02-07T21:39Z,"@ popeye013 do everyone a favour and choke on yer fucking spinach and then get ass raped by Bluto, sweet torrent nice and small but also very nice quality, thanks ajaxen94 much appreciated."
,popeye013,2012-02-07T22:29Z,"I was eating my spinach but then i saw your mother and puked my brains out in shock that ugly is somehow still legal!!!

The quality of this is shit, why is pointing that out such a bad thing?!! Or does the uploader have an ego so big that he/she can't take criticism...   "
,bigbandbilly,2012-02-08T01:27Z,Thank you very much .Lets hope and pray they come back soon.
,bigbandbilly,2012-02-08T02:14Z,I have watched Agnes Browne . It is a wonderful funny movie and Agnes is just as mouthy back then. We loved it.
[T],ajaxen94,2012-02-08T11:14Z,"hey bigbandbilly have you managed to get the movies yet i checked and there seems to be a lot of seeders at the moment, and thank you everyone for the vote of confidence"
