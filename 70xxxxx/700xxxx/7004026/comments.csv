when i try to download, the files inside the torrent are labled ""the girl with the dragon tatoo"", not Neverland. :S"
,tommyhawkster,2012-02-02T22:21Z,"Torrent is titled ""Neverland"", IMDB link is for ""Arthur Christmas"", and movie is ""The girl with the dragon tattoo"".............hmmmmm, I'm not sure if I can give you a pass on this one froggie, you do plenty of good work but this is not one of your strong moments.

,Wu_Lord,2012-02-03T13:51Z,"825 seeders - and no word as to whether this is actually TGWTDT or actually Neverland. Anyways, when running the torrent it comes up as TGWTDT and the sample.avi is of TGWTDT. *TGWTDG = The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. To froggie100 - good to know you're human too! Peace all."
