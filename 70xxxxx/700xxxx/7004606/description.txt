This is a VMware ThinApp version of ProxyCap 5.01.6 
pre-cracked by the "Team ZWT" patch + serial,etc..


So this is how to Install ProxyCap and all new versions (when they are released)
with a "lifetime Activation" and no more "this is not a genuine version" crap.


Needs just clean ProxyCap 5.01.6 setup files, 
because the virtual application was created in a clean virtual machine,
and it will give an error stating: 
"this ProxyCap configuration isn't compatible with this machine blah-blah-blah"

________________________________________________________________________________
3 files includes: ProxyCap.exe, Setup.msi, and ReadMe.txt

*Must extract from compressed 7zip file

Instructions:

1) Remove any Existing Installations of ProxyCap
2) Run Setup.msi (which is ProxyCap 5.01.6 for what I used for virtualizing)
3) In Start Menu click "Run" and type "services.msc",
   then hit enter and find & disable "ProxyCap Service" from starting up.
3b) In "Run" type "msconfig" and hit enter, 
    then in the startup tab uncheck "pcapui" and apply changes.

4) Copy "ProxyCap.exe" to Startup folder in Start Menu ---> All Programs
5) Launch "ProxyCap.exe" to generate "ProxyCap" program folder.
6) Apply Hidden attribute to "ProxyCap" folder (right-click, and properties)
_________________________________________________________________________________
NOTE: for any newer ProxyCap releases you would need to re-virtualize 
the program yourself and replace the old one in the startup folder, and follow the
same setup procedures (unless someone else found a better solution).

NOTE#2: Preferences can be saved, I tested it using proxies and saving settings, restarting
still keeps your settings.

Platforms Tested On: Windows XP, but I'm sure it should be compatible with Windows 7 as well 
since the directories in XP are pretty much identical to 7, except for the registry... 
(but since it's a "virtual app" it should work fine)


BTW I made VMware ThinApp say "Licensed to Team ZWT", because they should get most of the credit,
because virtualizing is easy peezy and most of the work is in the crack. The virtualized ProxyCap
simply isolates itself from being detected as a non-genuine version.
