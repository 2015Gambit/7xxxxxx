,SPADE305,2012-02-03T08:15Z,"Virtual Programs always come with flaws. I've tried everyway possible to create ProxyCap as a virtual app and be compatible with sandboxie and other apps, but I still failed. However, for those who want to Install ProxyCap again (the normal way) and use all of it's functionality even after it's been detected as a non-geniune version, you must remove the extra registry entries like this: Boot your computer to ERD Commander or anything that lets you use an offline registry editor, and Find and remove any keys/entries related to ""pcapsvc"", ""proxycap"", ""proxylabs"", ""MMTProvider.Mkey, "".dnpa"", and "".fspl"". Next remove these DLL's ""sbcrreag.dll"" and ""pcapwsp.dll"" in *\WINDOWS\System32\     AND YOUR DONE!!! HAVE PLEASURE IN RE-INSTALLING PROXYCAP WITHOUT ANY ISSUES AGAIN."
