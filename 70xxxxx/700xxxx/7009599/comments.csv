,adamsef,2012-02-10T12:18Z,"this game has been ripped incorrectly
""failed to find video_7b7e2085""

ill wait for another version! this aint goin near my xbox while online..

i made 2 copies before this game appeared on abgx360 and they failed to boot on LT+ 3.0

basic stealth passes but verification fails!
so im gunna wait"
,fankoosh,2012-02-14T14:44Z,"i download neverdead game from other torrent cause here the speed is not ok , so i checked it with abgx 1.0.6 it fix it & topolgy patch applied , then to play it on my LT+2 I had to use Patch LT+3 iso to LT+2 iso (ff 3 patch) , i burn it directly after last patch & it works ok"
