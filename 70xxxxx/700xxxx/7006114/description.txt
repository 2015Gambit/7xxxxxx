Synopsis (Thanks to Joey Markham (montreal@vircom.com))
Joey's a porno movie director and Paul's a producer/writer.  Paul has a script that he wants to film but wouldn't you know it, he seems to have the greatest difficulty finding any male talent.  Of course, all these girls come out of the woodwork all hot and bothered and ready for filming.  But Joey tells them there is no girl/girl in the script.  This gets them upset.
Paul says at one point, "I hate girl/girl.  That's why I didn't write girl/girl.  I think girl/girl is stupid" and at another point, "I don't understand why they have to put a girl/girl in every single video.  It doesn't make sense.  It's stupid, it's boring" (ironic for someone who thinks Janine is the next best thing since sliced bread!).  Anyhow, the girls start rehearsing lines among themselves and get caught up in sexual situations on and off the sets.  In the end, Joey's considering directing an all-girl video but Paul still isn't sold on the idea.
