In Planet Buster you are not restricted to swap only adjacent tiles that make up groups of three. You can strategically arrange tiles to trigger long chain-reactions and earn higher rewards. This allows for deeper strategic playing.

Before you start planning to arrange long rows of tiles, consider that you are playing against the clock and each move comes at a (virtual) price: one coin. You can recollect coins by blowing up tiles they are attached to, but on the other hand the bigger your chain-reactions are, the more coins will appear on the board!

From time to time you will have different power-ups at your disposal that you can use to rack up more points or to save you from imminent failure/get you out of precarious situations.
