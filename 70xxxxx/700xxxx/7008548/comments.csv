computer yesterday I had to get my Mac's OS
re-installed. The only way the Apple Store would do that for free is if I wiped everything out on my hard drive.... so the rest of this season, and the 4th, 5th, and 6th Seasons of THE FBI are gone.

I don't have this series on DVD -- they were from FileServe, which has since disabled downloads. Fortunately I've seen all of those on my hard drive before I had to give those copies up."
