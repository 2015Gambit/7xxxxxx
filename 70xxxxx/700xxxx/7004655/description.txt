Tom Woods is hosting today's show.

Today's first guest is Vikrant Reddy, policy analyst at the Center for Effective Justice at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on why almost everyone can be accused of criminality and the need to make beating back the police state a central 2012 issue. The second guest is Prof. Yuri Maltsev, Soviet defector and former economic adviser to the Soviet regime, on how far away America is from his former homeland.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
