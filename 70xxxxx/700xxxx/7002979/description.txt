An unflinching look at two teen rebels on a path to self-destruction through petty crime and perverse sexual games.  Yoshiko Yatsu, a former model with a "beatnik" persona, is a Suzuki discovery.  Her quirky character overpowers the film.



On a sweltering summer day, a gang of high school delinquents rove through an amusement park. One group member, JirÅ Sugita (Tamio Kawachi), harasses one of the girls which invokes an extended verbal rebuke. JirÅ leaves the group and returns home where he lives with his single mother, Misayo (Tomoko Naraoka). She is the mistress of Keigo Nanbara (Shinsuke Ashida), a business man, both of whom JirÅ is constantly at odds with. JirÅ gets in a fight with Nanbara, tears violently through the house and steals some money. Another girl from the group, Toshimi Tani (Yoshiko Yatsu), has a crush on JirÅ. The two start a physical relationship but JirÅ is decidedly cooler towards the affair. At Misayo's request, Nanbara lectures JirÅ about his disreputable lifestyle and relationship but is met with mockery.



The following day, Nanbara and Misayo, as well as JirÅ and his friends, go to a Zushi beach resort. JirÅ convinces one friend, Etsuko (Shinako Nakagawa), to seduce Nanbara. Toshimi then leads Misayo to the bedroom where Nanbara and Etsuko are having their tryst. JirÅ observes his mother's distress and is wracked with guilt. He and Toshimi steal a convertible and speed away. Nanbara catches up with them at a rest stop and, in a struggle, JirÅ kills Nanbara with a wrench. The two continue their frantic flight only to collide with a truck, dying soon afterward. A crowd has gathered around the wreck when Misayo arrives. An observer mutters, "Everything went wrong."
