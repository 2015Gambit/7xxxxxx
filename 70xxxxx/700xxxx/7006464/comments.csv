but then you hav so many .....

Any chance you have  ""The Cowsills Live in Concert"" ?

There are several great songs on that album that are not on their other albums ... Walk Away Renee,  Postman, etc

I have been looking for a couple years and have only found it available on Amazon for $50+

I'd be glad to buy it .... but not for $50 which I simply can not afford.

Anyhow .... thanks either way .... first request I've ever made from anyone .... but as mentioned, I search pirate bay about once a month for cowsills and finally found this so have to ask.

Take care.  Thanks again."
