,beso140,2012-02-28T13:47Z,"ITS ONLY BATTLEFEILD 3 RELOADED VERSION, NOT MULTIPLAYER"
,zelle24h,2012-02-28T17:53Z,@beso140 Did you downloaded it full?
,wirama,2012-03-04T19:11Z,"you can not...
I repeat, you can NOT play multiplayer or online with this

so before you all bashing with FAKE, DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME, STUPID TORRENT, or any other disrespect words, this is what you only get from this game file: SINGLEPLAYER

so if you want to play with your friends, buy the real thing"
,johnny758,2012-03-15T05:15Z,keeps on telling me to sign into orgin. how do i bypass this.
,aaktipis,2012-03-20T19:54Z,tells me the same
,dundun12,2012-03-21T02:49Z,It's real easy. All you gotta do is download this and then download a keygen for BF3 online passes. Put the online generated pass into the game and you got online!

,elurosgr,2012-04-11T08:42Z,SEEEDDDDD PLSSSS
,elurosgr,2012-04-12T07:54Z,PLS SEED IM ON 90% AND BEEN DWNLDING IT FOR 17 HOURS :((
,elurosgr,2012-04-12T13:12Z,I've downladed this and in the file there are like 159 compressed files...any ideas how i install this?
,Killer-16,2012-04-24T17:18Z,"Yeah, I got 159 weird files, how do I use them to install the game?  Thanks!!"
,dseldown,2012-05-01T21:06Z,"OK can anyone explain how to load/mount/or compile 139 files or technically 278 files into something that will install this game??  I already tried power ISO and compiled it as an ISO and then mounedt that on a virtual drive to install it but = no go!!.  I thought this would've been an easy deal as in the past scenarios, just never seen anything like this in a torrent before, so instead of rude remarks maybe some helpful instructions please!! Then everybody else who's struggling with it will know as well! Thanks!!"
,dseldown,2012-05-02T17:52Z,"OK got it to install by: extract all RAR files together as a batch to a folder, then open that up, you'll see 2 ISO's use Power ISO or whatever program you prefer. create at least 2 virtual disk, and mount the 1st ISO to the 1st virtual disk, and then the 2nd ISO to the other virtual disk, go back to # 1 disk and exe the load, designate where or create an install folder, If Win7 your using, use the x86 32 bit side. It'll go thru # 1 then tell you to load #2 select the pre loaded #2 virtual disk select the game not the crack, and proceed with install. It'll Finnish, and it'll open up the program. but the problem now is the time stamp issue, which prevents it from playing!! :[ I pasted the crack in the install folder, and it wont open the program now or work. Looking for a crack for this now, will advise further progress. Unless anyone has a suggestion to overcome this??"
,dseldown,2012-05-02T18:34Z,"OK problem solved with crack, didn't see the note about making sure there isn't the ""tm"" mark, meaning trade mark on the install folder, remove that by renaming the folder to whatever I used BF3 that's it. And wholla, the crack works, game opens up and starts and plays flawlessly!!  No more time stamp, Great upload by Colombo. Wish I could find a crack for online playing, but hell ya cant have everything in a single torrent"

,Al-Mualim,2012-06-28T03:54Z,"I solve the problem of the sound, but now, when i going to do other misssion, the continuing mission of that im playing the game crashes and doesent work, why?"
