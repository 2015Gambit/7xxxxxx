Any chance you'd be able to upload WHEEL OF TIME #'s 19 and 20 and then UNCHARTED #3? I know I'm probably the only one who reads Wheel of Time, but I'd love to have them here nice and easy.

:) Thanks!"
,ThaddeusM,2012-02-02T22:37Z,"On that note, I'd love the MAGIC THE GATHERING #1 that came out yesterday as well, if possible.

If not, of course, just keep up the good work, my friend. :D"

,ThaddeusM,2012-02-03T18:11Z,"Thanks a lot man, much appreciated.

And yeah, Uncharted doesn't seem to be catching on anywhere...I managed to find the first two in a torrent, but the third one has eluded me. Just a matter of time, I suppose, it did just come out a week ago."
