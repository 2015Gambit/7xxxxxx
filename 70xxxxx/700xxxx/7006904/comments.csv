[T],theburningbush,2012-02-03T20:03Z,"I need your feedback:
I have a choice about how to provide these CWKO torrents. The 1st choice is to provide them the same evening as first broadcast, often within 2 hrs of broadcast. With this option, the quality will sometimes be marginal, with lots of video freezing and sometimes missing audio as well. The 2nd choice would be a complete program, with no such glitches. However, this version of the program is often not available until 12-18 hours after the first broadcast -- sometimes longer.

I need you to tell me which you prefer:
1. Timely but often glitchy, OR
2. No glitches, but very late

Thanks!"
