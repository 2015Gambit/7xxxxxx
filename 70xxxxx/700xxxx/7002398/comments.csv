,haveaquestion,2012-02-05T22:36Z,"Great Game, now i don't even need a gf lmao..."
,ChubZz,2012-02-11T01:05Z,"Thanks, Anyone know if this works with content pack's?
"
,Sagiy20,2012-02-15T23:33Z,Excellent! Much better than the first game! + lots of customizations!
,Wisher_SiD,2012-02-20T00:26Z,"@Remdul: I dont have it anymore, since i find this to be much better; and its really hard to reacquire it, thrixxx are extremely zealous about their content... ;)
But ill try to upload it here when possible."
,yattakun,2012-02-20T01:23Z,"Hello
very nice your job.
Because you are not polluting the title screen as did the tk17.
On screen customization, they put the name behind the scene. horrible.
I would love you to put all the customization options of the breasts and other parts as did the tk17 Team.
But always keep the opening of the original game as you did.

I look forward to a super pack update ok."
,KtijihbA,2012-02-27T03:17Z,"Geat game but where is the content pack?
Pack @ link
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7002510/The_Klub_17_Content_Pack_v11
isn't working.
It keeps asking ""TK17 content installer was unable to find The Club 17 installation on your system. Would u like to locate it manually?"""
,Ceef,2012-03-05T17:26Z,"Hi, when I install the game and clic on the launcher I can't see most of it (see the screenshot) and when I clic the button to login, the app crashes. I tried with the klub17 version ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6747024/The_Klub_17_v630_%283D_SexVilla_2%29 ) but the problem is the same.
Is there any solution ?

,Wisher_SiD,2012-03-05T20:41Z,"@KtijihbA: That content pack is intended for the older, The Klub 17 versions, up to v630.

Try locating the installation manually. Its most likely in ""C:Program Files3D SexVilla 2 - Everlust"".


@Ceef: That's a very odd problem, i havent' seen it before so i cant help you with this. Since you are having the same problem with the other version, it leads me to believe its problem on your PC, incompatibility with something else (a driver or some other installation that uses similar driver files)."
,Ceef,2012-03-05T21:59Z,"Thanks for the answer. I had the oxyn torrent until now and it worked well. I tried with compatibility modes and stuff but there's no improvement. Anyway, if I figure how to fix it, I'll post a comment in case someone else runs into that problem :)

Thanks again for the answer, bye !"

,psychoo14,2012-06-24T17:30Z,"hlw wisher_SID! heartly thanx from my side for uploading this awesome game. btw, is it possible to control the speed of thrusting through keyboard controls?? if not, do u know any games in which it is possible to fuck using keyboard keys?? :) nyway, thanx again..."
,6xSnake6x,2012-06-29T15:01Z,"Does this pack have all the content from klub 17 ? does it at least have all the customization options ? if not, can you add them ? I read that a klub 17 v7 was out."
,GapsD519,2012-06-29T21:05Z,why does this had smaller size than tk17 v630? when this is the new one..? was this a full game too..? i mean not just a demo..?
,LapisPhilosophorum,2012-07-29T00:57Z,"Okay, so I've downloaded this game before, but not this version.. And I have a seriously problem. The download shows up as a black white page icon, and says windows doesnt know what program to use to open it, rather than having the game's icon? Is there something I'm missing here? Please help :/"
,LapisPhilosophorum,2012-07-29T00:58Z,blank white page*
,LapisPhilosophorum,2012-07-29T01:55Z,"Okay, I feel like a dumbass now. I forgot I'm on a newer laptop, and I didn't have Winrar or anything like that yet... -_- yeah.. So once i opened the game, I realized it was way better than the old ""trojaned"" Oxin's Style I once had in the past. Props to you my friend, great job on it. :)"
