Description:
BILLY is a personal story of New Zealands most 
loved entertainer, Billy T James. This feature 
length drama goes beyond the public facade to 
reveal the man behind the chuckle.

Based on the biography Billy T written by Matt 
Elliott, award-winning producer Tony Holden brings 
a fresh vision and understanding to who Billy was. 
BILLY is a love story set in the changing culture 
of New Zealand in the seventies and eighties. 
It also portrays the journey of a shy, loyal and 
musically gifted boy who married his first love 
and went on to achieve extraordinary success. A 
Maori boy who, within a few short years, lost 
everything, including his life.
