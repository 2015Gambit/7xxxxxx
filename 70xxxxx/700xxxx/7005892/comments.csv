,stan1408,2012-02-03T13:09Z,"plz encode audio AAC LC some hardware media players don't like HE-AAC audio like mine does background noise but no noise on PC, so i have to convert all YIFY movies to AAC LC audio, and if selecting same bit-rate it does same size as HE-AAC so i don't understand why use HE-AAC."
,dandalis,2012-02-03T13:28Z,i'll wait for scOrp release.
,KaldeanOCEAN,2012-02-03T13:35Z,"Hey Yify, is it possible if you could upload the movie 'Chronicle' if thats possible??"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-03T14:11Z,"Thx to our Big HERO named YIFY ! You're the One. I  have now 100 YIFY-movies and that makes me very happy indeed. A million thx YIFY !
@Stan. I doubt he can change to AAC LC because that's a part of the YIFY-magic i believe ? His HE-AAC at  64kbs sounds usually much better than any other guys mp3 128kbs. I listen with very good qty headphones (AKG K 420. @140 euros) and it sounds great."

,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-03T18:13Z,"OK, i have now watched&listened to this rip. My Final review:
V: 10  Video quality is amazing, almost like 10+.  
A: 8   I just listened with headphones (that i mentioned above in earlier comment) and the speech comes through as quite natural, good, but the strong orchestral soundtrack and thumping sound effects sounds unfortunately clearly compressed. Maybe YIFY should therefore add a little bit more kbs, 96 or 112kbps in some movies at least (like this one?). My overall verdict is 9,5."
,Teck1,2012-02-03T18:55Z,Thanks. Still waiting for the remaining seasons of Dragon Ball Z Kai.

Please do you mind upload the movie ""Ray"" ? Ray Charles, I just love his musics !

thanks 4 ever!"
,thenoobest1,2012-02-04T06:33Z,"I dont get anyone can give YIFY audio a 5 or more because the bitrate is so low and not even 5.1. Video quality and file size is 10/10, but most of the rips have really bad audio."
,ronnieaka,2012-02-04T12:21Z,"hey, can you upload Goon (2011) *ing Sean William Scott ?"
,nosing_glass,2012-02-04T14:53Z,"thanks yifi :)
sure, there has been some poor audio here and there recently, but this one sounds good to me. 
personally, i would prefer a 128 bit audio standard at an slightly increased file size. no more bitching then i guess.
@thenoobest1: 5.1 but 700mb? u must be nuts ;)

A: 10-  Earlier i gave 8, but then i used MPC HC-player. Now when using VLC-player the sound was much, much better. It's the same with every movie - VLC gives better sound for some reason i don't know ?
Overall qty is then: 10. Awesome YIFY !"
,skeptic4all,2012-02-06T02:43Z,"v10  a10   this torrent is perfect..the audio is great, I do not understand what is going on with the bad audio comments, maybe you should update your viewer or use the proper one.  thx Yify "

Subtitles 3/10 - really really REALLY bad subtitles. No misspellings and such, but they write ""him"" instead of ""you"" and stuff like that all the time, sometimes you get completely lost by reading them."

,kingknight4,2012-02-07T15:35Z,All the movies i download are from yify...thanks yify U rock!!!
,ProphetZarquon,2012-02-08T01:26Z,"NOTICE this release is NOT in 720p, it even says 1280x544 right in the description.

Obiviously if it's less than 800mb for a whole movie it isn't 720p, but I still wish people would quit slapping 720p on files that clearly are not.

That said, this is a very nice Rip and I'm about to download it at a second location, so I figured I should comment. I have no seedbox so it will stay in my list until 2.5:1 or until No Activity reaches 24 hours.

I personally prefer Stereo to 5.1 because of the added file size and also because 5.1 encoding tends to have a very wide dynamic range which makes it impossible to listen to dialog quietly over speakers.  My preference is 192kbps MP3 with a compressed dynamic range.  I know, I'm weird, but I can hear the dialog better that way.  5.1 ch in a "
,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-08T22:42Z,"@ProphetZ. No, no, you're wrong ! THIS IS 720p. A full frame 16/9 widescreen picture is of course 1280x720, yes, but when you have that typical black borders-up-and-down widescreen called 2.35:1, then of course it will be 1280 in width and smaller in height (when stripped of those black borders) it will be like here 1280x544 - but of course it's still a proper 720p rip. Do you understand now ?"
[T],480v,2012-02-09T07:17Z,"Jesus, the downloaders have a serious love affair this uploader. You'd think YIFY was the Dalai Lama by the way yifys_SEEDER commented. lol. But seriously, I couldn't care less. I just thought the unusually excessive praise was amusing."

Although a lot of this film was a bit too anachronistic for my tastes, it had some fine sword play and nice looking, quality actors.
