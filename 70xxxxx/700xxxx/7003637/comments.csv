[V],boobsman,2012-02-02T17:31Z,"@ Rytis89, yes working on LT2.0, please read the description ;)"
,asrocker,2012-02-02T18:20Z,Even though it says LT+2.0 and above im dubious all other sites with the PAL rip are saying LT+3.0 only.

,daniel.lind,2012-02-05T23:45Z,"I have a problem.
When I unpack the files for DVD1, the files are too large for a 8.5GB DVD.
Is there any way around this or do I have to buy a DVD with more storage capacity?"
,MEGodObeyOrDIEeee,2012-02-09T19:14Z,"Daniel, you need liteon IHAS 124 (or higher nr) to burn XGD3 discs properly. It wont work otherwise."
,daniel.lind,2012-02-19T14:29Z,"Thanks for the help. I did try to use the guide before I actually asked the question but I guess I wasnt as thorough as I should have been - or simply put; I was stupid.

Anyway, thanks for pointing out what went wrong - I'm guessing by the information collected that my DVD burner, aka the one already in my laptop when I purchased it, cannot burn at the end of disks.

I'm going to check up on another DVD-burner and see how that works out.

Once again, thanks."

,Luke_Wolf,2012-09-09T20:26Z,"This is one of the least seeded games I've ever seen. I've been scavenging the darkest corners of the internet for Metal Gear Solid HD Collection in PAL-format, and this is the most seeded torrent I've found. I seriously have an average of 11 kB/s, and I've had this torrent on for 3 days straight. If you have this game, and are not seeding, please do. A lot of people are trying to get this and if I ever finish downloading it, I will literally seed this for weeks. Help your fellow gamers out. Peace"
