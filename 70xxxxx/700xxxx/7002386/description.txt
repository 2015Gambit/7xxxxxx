2012 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC (...SO FAR)

Starting off the new year, I'll be once again sharing a wide variety of Christian Music released at some point in time during the current 2012 calendar year.  I don't believe I'll be doing it as long as I did back in 2011, where I was able to put up 964 Christian Albums.  Instead, I think I'd rather spend some of 2012 taking requests to torrent specific albums.  But then again, time will tell.

Yet, as always, if you're downloading any of these torrents today, please find it within you to continue sharing back perhaps a little longer than you otherwise might.  I don't have the hard drive or bandwidth resources to continue to support these torrents once they're fully seeded.  God Bless!
