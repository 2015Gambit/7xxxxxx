,Erik_O,2012-02-03T00:26Z,thanks!
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-03T00:48Z,I didn't know there was a second season and I thought you were asking for the first season! Hopefully I can continue to find these too. They are very popular!!
,mm802,2012-02-03T20:39Z,Did you just rename the scene file?
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-03T22:21Z,"I don't really know. Coz when I got it (not by torrents) it was only labelled (Gss02e01) so I changed it to make more sense to people downloading it off me. I hope not! At the time no one had put it up for nearly a day, so I wanted to share a better version than the one I previously found and uploaded, which was terrible quality!!"
,danielmancapt,2012-02-09T03:33Z,you able to upload episode 2 of season 2 haway!?
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-09T07:12Z,"I think that I will let TvTeam cover Geordie Shore from here. Scene seem to be capping this show, so there is no need for me to post it. Unless they stop, then I will try and find it and upload it for everyone :)"
,kimi86,2012-02-09T13:44Z,"please put episode 2 up noone else is, ive found one but its stuck downloading at 24% please please please :o)"
