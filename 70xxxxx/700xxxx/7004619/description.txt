MOLLY GENE ONE WHOAMAN BAND
FOLK BLUES AND BOOZE
Label: Solid Sound
Released: 29 Oct 2011
Format: Flac

From the depths of the one-man band underground there has emerged an undeniably impressive female singer/songwriter -- a one-woman band, rather -- whose dirty blues and raw country sound is quickly earning her a place among the more notable artists of that particular movement. Molly Dyer, better known as Molly Gene One Whoaman Band, is a down-home young woman, all cowboy boots and t-shirts and flannels, all soul and grit and fire. Her bottleneck slide technique is reminiscent of the old blues greats, though with a rock 'n' roll edge. Her raspy whiskey and cigarettes vocals, which do not come across as androgynous but remain entirely feminine, join together with her big plugged-in guitar sound to form songs that are as wicked as a desert rattlesnake, as sharp a straight razor, as fiery as a sip of backwoods moonshine, as sultry as summer nights in the Deep South, and nearly as sexy as Molly herself.
