[T],Tyr3ll,2012-02-01T02:14Z,"@ vimala :
I don't think so bud !
A)put powerdvd12Sim in your Cyberlink\PowerDVD12 directory
B)use the reg key x32 or x64 for validate the all
It works on 9 different computers as well as on mines without any problems except sometimes a freeze problem when i go on setting options,otherwise
all working fine,so why not for you dude ?
You are the only one who's complaining about...
over more than 500 downloads now...
Retry,it must work anyway !
Trust me and believe me,i am absolutely sure.

,7i7an,2012-02-03T06:18Z,"Installation worked for me but this is the plain version of PowerDVD 12; no Ultra. I tried playing Blu-ray ISO but it says format not recognized, please upgrade to Ultra version for Blu-ray playback. I then went to All Programs in Windows and it says CyberLink Power DVD 12 - no Ultra. I found another version on btjunkie though, hopefully it works."
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-02-04T20:40Z,"Well this the true retail mates,you can trust and believe me ;)
However i dunno more about this SimKey.
Two other patchs are also available on the net
but are exactly the same as both all patch Orginal SimKey and don't give more help anyway.
Btw,Cyberlink have changed their method of
activation for this new version (i checked myself a bit...)
Best way would consisting to get the exact matching serial with this SimKey for sure...
If perhaps i find something's better,i will let you know here,of course.
BD works for me but only 1 time on 5 (lol) :/
sorry again
cheers"
,mankhan67,2012-02-07T09:32Z,"followed exactly you advised, it works but no blu-ray support. remove ultra from title please."
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-02-08T17:47Z,"This is the real retail ultra version as it is an ESD product coming directly through a well known Cyberlink reseller and retailer anyway.
The problem is that we don't have the original matching serial with the SimKey...
Btw,there is a job to start on it to tweak this one on several stuff aswell.
We have to discover and learn how bypassing this new activation also...
Be patient,as nothing is really impossible and this way we hope find a way soon or asap anyway.
Just a question of time as i am currently already working to anyway...
Well on most of Cyberlink products in fact but i can't tell you more...
cheers ;)"
[T],grimreaper420,2012-03-14T23:44Z,"I can confirm with Tyr3ll this is indeed PowerDVD Ultra even though if doesnt say ultra anywhere PowerDVD Remote & PowerDVD Mobile is available therefore im vouching for the uploader.
This torrent works - case closed. "
