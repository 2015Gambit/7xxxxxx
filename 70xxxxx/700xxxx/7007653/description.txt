[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

I'm not happy.

I'm often too anxious to be happy. Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it made me try harder in school and work.

Charles de Gaulle was once asked, "Are you happy?" He answered, "What do you take me for, an idiot?"

I know what he meant. Maybe my unhappiness led me to try harder and that earned me my own TV show.

But as Charles Murray from the American Enterprise Institute argues in one of my favorite books, In Pursuit: Of Happiness and Good Government, there is no higher aspiration than happiness


    <<John Adams calmly asserted that, â€˜Upon this point all speculative politicians will agree that happiness of society is the end of Government ...' The concept of happiness and the word itself appear again and again in Revolutionary sermons, pamphlets and tracts.>>


So tonight, with the help of my guests, we'll try to unlock the mysteries of happiness.

British economist Philip Booth and George Mason University professor Chris Coyne published separate studies for the Institute of Economic Affairs that asks the same question: can government make us happy?

Duke University professor Dan Ariely wrote a book about what influences happiness.

Rick Hanson says religious people are happier, and his book Buddha's Brain tries to answer why.

Stephen Post will talk about how charitable work makes the givers happy.

Psychotherapist Gary Greenberg argues in his book Manufacturing Depression that unhappiness and depression are not a chemical imbalance.

Tonight, we'll try to unravel the secrets to happiness.
