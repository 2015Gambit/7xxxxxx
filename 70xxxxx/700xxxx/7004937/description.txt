    Note, for some reason imdb and some others call this 'Dawna of the       
    Dead', but really there is no 'of' in title. Enjoy some xxx'ish          
    zombie entertainment ;)

    The dead have risen from their graves and they want to do far worse      
    than just eat her flesh.                                                 
                                                                             
    There are 9 Gates to the Kingdom Of Hell... Eveningside Cemetery         
    rests over the 6th Gate. Dawna is obsessed with her Dead Boyfriend       
    who is buried in the Eveningside Cemetery. One night while visiting      
    his grave something strange happens... Through Dawna's obsession, the    
    6th Gate is opened. The ground splits and the dead rise from their       
    graves and walk the Earth, including Dawna's dead boyfriend. The         
    Zombies only drive is to eat, kill, and rape. Before they realize it,    
    it's too late, Dawna and her friends are trapped in the cemetery with    
    the Living Dead.... Who want to do far worse than just eat their
