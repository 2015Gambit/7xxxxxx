NOTES:

Ok for off many thanks for sharing that ISO guys ....thank you :)
Now the source ...lots of camera movement throughout,a tad washed out,lots of glares,lacked a bit of colour...but 
overall for a cam,pretty decent :)
Audio was AC3 and was pretty nice too be honest for cam ...one of the better ones.
Workdone ...shitloads lol.
First due to the camera movement we thought at first fack cutting this up ....but been a little quiet so went back to 
the drawing board and decided to cut this up lol....in total we cut into 12 pieces.
From here we took each part and used a quad filter to allow us to level up the video and then used crop to remove all unwanted
areas without losing too much video at all :)
Also each part we increased the contrast,lowered the brightness...increased the chroma,lowered the intes to dull the glares and
and used a heavu noise filter aswell as balancing out the sharpness.
Was a pita sitting their scrolling through it finding the camera moves but overall think we removed 95% of it and the main part left
is the opening 2mins and thats nothing major ....
Cheack sample for Q ,but too see all the work done you need to view the whole file as you'll see how well the movement as been dealt with.
Enjoy folks :)
