This shit is infected with troyans!
After trying to install (and the installer doesn't work in a visible typical way) I get tons of Avast warnings about troyans and attempts to open harmful websites. 
BTW, the original file from Releaselog is only about 500MB - see for yourself.
BTW2 - check this piece of crap on YouTube before making an effort to run it."
[T],Sunblock.,2012-02-02T20:34Z,"1. Works great for me no warrnings. running superantispyware, F-secure and windows defender.

2. Releaselog = direct downloads = packed files = smaller files. ( this is not packed = bigger orginal size)"
[T],Sunblock.,2012-02-02T20:36Z,3. Then game well its not realy anything i would recommend :D. played 10min and its uninstalled already. :P
,PikeyBoo,2012-02-03T09:01Z,I have download both copys of this game that are available on TPB and this one does appear to be be clean after scaning it unlike the other torrent but like everthibg else download at your own risk!
,tedwu,2012-02-03T09:04Z,"I care not whether if the uploader submits a name but upon checking the file cross langual sites show FASiSO a legit supplier for this file. Plus this guy has a skull. I wrote about skulls being hard to obtain before. Those guys are good and dont slip. Trogens are not even technically virus anyways check your sources if you need to. Trogens are merely a tool to bypass many firewalls and software checker system. Like a rar at most.
If anything to doubt about his file is if it's worth the fun/time. like Sunblock suggest"
,PikeyBoo,2012-02-03T09:32Z,"Hiw could you possibly know if the uploader has a skull its been uploaded anonymously. It has been approved by a mod with a skull I was merly saying you download all torrents at your own risk not just this one so dobt be trying to creat confrontation where there is none! Its not hard to download a file if you wanted to and infect something malicious into it all under the pretense of it being from a legitimate source by simply puting there name in the title, why didnt the original provider upload it them selves why is it Anonymous these are questions you need to ask yourself when downloading any torrent not just this one!"
,hax1337,2012-02-06T03:32Z,Dammit guys its Trojan.
,hax1337,2012-02-06T15:40Z,It's Trojan not Troyan
,hax1337,2012-02-06T15:45Z,"When I try to launch this it closes. It says:
""police.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close."""
,InFi[D]eL,2012-02-12T01:37Z,"I am confident that the object is clear of any potentially harmful objects (Trojans etc.) However, I have had no luck getting it to work. The setup.exe file runs as normal up until the actual installation. When we reach this stage, the progress bar fills in a matter of seconds and does not properly install the game. Note ad-watch (ad-aware) will attempt to block the ISO's autorun once mounted. This is a false positive and you'll need to disable ad-watch."
,foudrenoir75,2012-03-18T01:24Z,Kapersky: no threats detected. The game is working fine. Thanks.
,FamilyMan82,2012-06-15T00:53Z,I get a appcrash everytime I try to run this game. Installed fine but thats all it did. vision100.dll seems to be the root of the error any advice??
,BillyJoe575,2012-06-26T22:27Z,"I get an ""Error Reporting"" message if I try to run it after installation.

AVG 2011 Pro says it's clean/virus free."
,alissonpc,2012-07-17T23:37Z,"Here worked 100%, no problems with game load or virus on files. NO PROBLEM. I use Avira Free Antivirus, no alerts of trojan. Download and play if you question is ""has virus"" or ""it crashes"" =)"
,gasaixyuno,2012-09-06T03:26Z,"This game worked fine for me. Mount or burn and let the install go all the way through. Although I don't think it's the torrents fault, but the officers and such move slowly. Other than that, this torrent has worked fine

Windows 7 64-bit PC"
