,vascorama,2012-02-05T00:28Z,"Inside a subfolder.
Maybe your anti-virus blocked it.
Disable your anti-virus and browse the downloaded folder."
,metalchef,2012-03-07T14:12Z,"keygen worked for about one month...then application reverted to trial version. could not re-register with keygen.
yes, ""check for updates"" is unchecked/disabled.

perhaps modifying the host file would resolve this?"
,metalchef,2012-03-08T19:48Z,"removed program. re-installed, blocked internet via firewall and disconnected from WLAN, re-applied crack...worked for ONE DAY...then, back to trial.

also tried 7.0.1.2022 ...no dice. 

anyone got a fix for this--aside from spending USD$59.95 ??"
