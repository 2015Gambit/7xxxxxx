[color=red]StoryLine[/color]
[color=green]oon after her return from a business trip to Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff dies from what is a flu or some other type of 

infection. Her young son dies later the same day. Her husband Mitch however seems immune. Thus begins the spread of a deadly 

infection. For doctors and administrators at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, several days pass before anyone realizes the 

extent or gravity of this new infection. They must first identify the type of virus in question and then find a means of 

combating it, a process that will likely take several months. As the contagion spreads to millions of people worldwide, societal 

order begins to break down as people panic.[/color]
