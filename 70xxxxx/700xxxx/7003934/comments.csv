,Ykalondr,2012-02-02T16:03Z,This is update 4. What the scene called update 4 was actually update 3.1 since all it added was Large Adress Aware which made it possible for the game to see and use more than 4 GB RAM.

I started a download for this update and the one @ http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7002600/The.Elder.Scrolls.V.Skyrim.Update.5-RELOADED. This one finished first and made the other unable to finish d/ling. I'm assuming the error was becuase the files are the same. Notice they were upped the same day and are about the same size. This update has an extra blank ""Read Me"" file.

You might want to take some time to read the file details for the SkyrimLauncher and the TESV.exe. Then, you will see the launcher was not updated(still 1.3.12) but TESV.exe now says version 1.4.21."
,Ykalondr,2012-02-03T00:34Z,"Yes I know, just refering to the fact that Bethsoft calls this update 4 not 5. Whichever scene group that released the Large Adress Aware patch a month ago misnamed it update 4."

read there. according to that, and not counting the varied Beta patch. this is the 5th update for skyrim, so it can be safely called update 5. Bethsoft also never say this as update 4 or 5, they refer is as update 1.4.

happy now ?"
,GObonzo,2012-02-03T10:06Z,5th update = game becomes v1.4.21. very easy to understand
,iycgtptyarvg,2012-02-06T12:26Z,"Thanks.

I haven't played this game yet, but great to see updates are coming."

,Rawkzard,2012-02-08T02:14Z,"this patch introduces micro-stuttering for a lot of people, nothing your hardware can do really"
