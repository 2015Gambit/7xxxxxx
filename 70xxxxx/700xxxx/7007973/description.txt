This is the first season of the unedited series (291 episodes). I couldn't find any good DBZ torrents on TPB so I bought this set. There are six files, one for each disc. They contain the marathon feature, which plays all the episodes on a single disk without all the ending and opening credits between episodes. I also kept the original Japanese music because I like it better. If anyone has a problem with this, then FUCK OFF!

P.S. I plan on uploading all nine seasons once I buy them, and possibly GT and Dragon Ball, although there's already a good Dragon Ball torrent here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3728679/Dragon_Ball_-_UNCUT_-_Episodes_001-153_[Japanese_English_Audio__
