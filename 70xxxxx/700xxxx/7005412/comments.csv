--------

This is essentially a flawless print... 10/10.

 There are some release-specific eng subs available at s-scene, but they are machine translation and often wrong (but they're close, if you're desperate).

Sincere thanks to all seeders and leechers, and of course to the uploader as well. Another perfect up (though the movie itself was a bit cringe-worthy... 'The collected works of leonardo devinci? Fuck 'em! Let's destroy them gratuitously!' lol).

Long live The Pirate Bay!! "

Really, this movie is near perfect! Thumbs up for director Paul W.S. Anderson for yet another thrilling comedy action movie. His rendition of the famed novel is really... well... BADASS!

Not only, does he direct zombie movies well, he also portrays the early Paris life in full awesomeness!

This just excites me more for Resident Evil 5: Retribution!

He did ask a question and not showing off, if you find it to be ""showing off"" just because someone is asking advice then i guess you're just a little kid who can't afford one yourself because you don't get that kind of allowance money from your parents.

And yes that does make you a bad person if you choose not to seed like everyone else in this community should, everyone should have a chance to rate the movie by themselves and not through what you thinks.
You have a selfish way of thinking and shouldn't be allowed to be part of a sharing community, you even admit that you never seed, you should be ashamed of yourself if at least."
