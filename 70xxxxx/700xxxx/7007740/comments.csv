,goodwood,2012-02-04T19:34Z,"Thanks David for all the Great Ups

Any chance you could re-seed this one.

Showing Only .47% available. Been running 8 hours already.

Need some seeders that have the whole Files."
,quicrack,2012-02-05T07:51Z,"Don't worry guys, David has the full file, he just doesn't let it to be downloaded instantly after release - because there are leachers who will remove the torrent just after installing programs, while this torrent is young. This way, the torrent will be downloaded a bit later for you, but a lot more people will be able to get it on the decent speeds!"
,porky2017,2012-02-05T11:25Z,"thanks @polisdavid, as always gr8 torrent- I am seeding.."
,7117,2012-02-05T21:44Z,Hey!! Dont go that (flsw101) scam site.. bretty sure this asshole lie's.. if u want sn you can find it yourself in serialbox ..David sn works well also.cheers
,porky2017,2012-02-05T23:31Z,Hey there is nothing wrong with my torrent-it works fine-I don't need no serial-what's this guy on about..
,7117,2012-02-05T23:56Z,"@ porky2017 
just don't listen that  punk.."
,alkwef,2012-02-06T00:21Z,"Still downloading--downspeeds vary from 10 k to 365 k... only 45% availability?!

Also:
-+-+-+-WARNING-+-+-+-
flsw101 is a lying SPAMMER.
Google ""site:thepiratebay.se flsw101"" to see proof. All of his comments are: ""The ____ works perfect but the serial doesn't work. Go to this shitty spam site to download a virus. I mean serial."""
,alkwef,2012-02-06T03:16Z,"Little confused... TPB says 2.5 GB, BT says 2.4 (but 2.5 downloaded), and Finder gives me 2.68. What gives?

In any case, thanks--yet again--for another fantastic upload. 
Will seed to at least a 1:1 ratio (but probably a lot more than that) for as long as I can. Already at .3, so I'll probably go for 1.5 or something."
,alkwef,2012-02-06T03:22Z,"Hold up... on first launch for FCPX, I had like 20-30 Dock items open and close one after another (took like five seconds.) One or all (not sure) was called something along the lines of auvaltool. Anyone know what that is? Didn't happen again."
,alkwef,2012-02-06T06:30Z,"Me again, is it safe to install Apple's updates? I'm worried that (1) the crack will stop working and (2) they might figure out that it's cracked and get my IP address or something like that... please advise ASAP!"
,porky2017,2012-02-06T07:08Z,"I would like to know if anyone has installed the motion 5 update & the fcp x update.without any problems..
my software update has to updates to install.
does anyone know if its alright to download & install..

cheers"
,porky2017,2012-02-06T07:20Z,anyone used the software update yet with this torrent
,7117,2012-02-06T11:08Z,"@alfew
don't pirate software if u afraid for your IP
..and dont worry,nothing happens with updates, 
@porky
what update you talking about, this v 10.0.3 is last one"
,porky2017,2012-02-06T23:56Z,"@7117

The software updates on your Mac
I get 2 updates to install one for extra sounds for fox
& stability & one for motion 5
I am worried if I install these update fcp won't work anymore.

Cheers.."
,7117,2012-02-07T00:24Z,"..i installed these update to, everything is fine and works well, these is some extra sound clip's.. (useless and old btw)   "
,alkwef,2012-02-07T02:20Z,"@7117
I use a VPN 100% of the time and would use it for updates, just not sure if they would 1. see that it's pirated then 2. leave some sort of code that would repeatedly send the computer's info to Apple or something. 
And just to be sure, you had zero problems? Can someone else confirm this please (a little paranoid lol, but still)?

and if there are any Apple employees reading this:
You have $100 billion in the bank. Get over it."
,alkwef,2012-02-07T02:20Z,"Also, at a .5 ratio so far. Will continue to seed for a long time, at a minimum of half an hour per day (VPN has a limit :( ) but probably 1.5-2 hours total per day."
,porky2017,2012-02-07T03:09Z,"@7117 thanks for reply I will install updates tonight will report back on how it went

Cheers.."
,7117,2012-02-07T03:12Z,"dont worry, in prison you have lots of time cut some movies ..or study what are proxy servers and how these works
..i'm pretty sure you don't need that FCP 
leave it here, :) your mum gonna misss you"

,quicrack,2012-02-07T09:46Z,"@polisdavid,

I have found a Compressor 4.0.2 (new version) torrent on a French torrent site.
Please, add it to your torrent, and it will become the FULL collection!
(FCP + Motion + Compressor all latest versions)

Here is the link:

For people who doesn't know French, it would be a bit difficult to register,
since Google Translate is not working for this website.
So, I will give you my account:

,quicrack,2012-02-07T22:13Z,"@redjadevideo Not at all ;-)

I have created a torrent Compressor v4.0.2 to save your time, here is a link:

,rascame69,2012-02-12T06:01Z,"TY TY TY this is a great Torrent, worked perfectly no hassles, no hitches, smooth sailing, thanks again. "

,Whopper_Jr,2012-04-03T23:16Z,"I think Apple along with Adobe have realized that a certain amount of torrenting is good in the sense that people are actually learning how to use their products. How else would (thousands?) of teens get their start in the graphic design or production fields if they couldn't goof around and learn how the software works beforehand? 

Apple, and Adobe especially, receive the bulk of their software sales income from businesses buying in bulk. Kids who are designing little logos and making movies for fun don't pose any kind of threat to these massive companies, and there's not really much profit lost by letting a kid get their hands on an application for free that they wouldn't have purchased anyway."
,Whopper_Jr,2012-04-03T23:17Z,"Also, anyone got a link to JUST the 10.0.3 update? I've already got a copy of FCP X installed, just need the update."
,chrisrr,2012-04-20T11:56Z,Any chance anyone's got the latest: 10.0.4?
