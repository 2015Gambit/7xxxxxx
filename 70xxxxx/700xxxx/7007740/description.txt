Version 10.0.3 introduces Multicam Editing, Broadcast Monitoring, and more new features that extend the power and flexibility of Final Cut Pro X.

Multicam

Edit multicam projects faster than ever before with a collection of innovative features that provide unmatched speed and flexibility. Select video and photos, then create a Multicam Clip by automatically syncing different angles based on time of day, timecode, markers, or audio waveforms. Play back multiple angles at once in the customizable Angle Viewer, and use the powerful new Angle Editor to dive into any Multicam Clip and make precise adjustments. You can change, add, or delete camera angles at any time and work with different codecs, frame sizes, and frame rates without conversion. When itâ€™s time to cut your multicam project, simply click in the Angle Viewer or use keyboard shortcuts to switch between angles on the fly.

Advanced Chroma Keying

In addition to using the high-quality, one-step chroma key in Final Cut Pro X, you can now access advanced keying controls for color sampling, edge adjustment, and light wrap. Tackle complex keying challenges without exporting to a motion graphics application. And play back results instantly and in context to make critical editing decisions.
