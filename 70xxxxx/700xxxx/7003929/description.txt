After years of dedication and perseverance, he did. Soon after, the furry red love machine known as Elmo was born. Through rare vintage footage and a wealth of interviews with friends, family, colleagues, and Kevin himself, the multi-award winning â€œBeing Elmoâ€ narrates a heartwarming story about a boy who believed in the power of his dreams..
