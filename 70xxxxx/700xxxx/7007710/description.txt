Information on this process.


Inspired by Campanella's Dynamic remaster torrents, I've decided to start uploading my personal Unbrickwalled restored albums. My Process is essentially exactly the same, with my own minor tweaks while trying not to alter or exagerate any details. 

Source is always My own retail CDDA Tracks, otherwise, I use Secure ripped FLAC files from Demonoid user torrents.

First I lower the volume enough to give myself enough headroom to work, then I use Perfect Declipper to reinterpolate clipped peaks to rebuild as close as possible to what the Original unbrickwalled master may have sounded like. Overall, sound quality is improved, and distortion caused by squashed peaks is minimized resulting in increased dynamics and more punchiness to the music. I hope you enjoy, and leave feedback if you enjoy the torrent, or think it's a shit waste of bandwidth.
