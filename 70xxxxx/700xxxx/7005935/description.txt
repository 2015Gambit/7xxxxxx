If is the debut solo album from Bill Ryder-Jones, founding member and lead guitarist from The Coral. If was recorded to soundtrack Italo Calvino's meditation on writing in the post modernist novel If On A Winters Night A Traveller and lays out grand orchestral movements side by side with stark, nakedly emotional vocal led pieces that weave a bleak but beautifully visceral accompanying narrative. If has provided the framework necessary for Ryder-Jones to explore his musical potency in full detail.
