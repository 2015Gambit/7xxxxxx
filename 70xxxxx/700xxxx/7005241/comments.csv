The audio is terrible. When it was raining, or there were birds, the sound became a static hiss. Even worse, I was streaming this movie from my NAS to my ps3 and around 30 minutes into the movie, the audio became muted, with a copyright protection warning from cividea (spelling might be wrong) saying that playback was not authorized on that device. I was able to continue watching with VLC without any issues, but it's something to be aware of!"

Interesting... the compression on this mp4 file makes iPhone, iPad 2 & iTunes choke on it. VLC plays it fine on Mac, but on iOS devices it stutters on the VLC player.
Solution? Run it thru Handbrake, using the iPad settings. You'll end up with a slightly bigger file (1007 MB), but with AMAZING resolution.
However YIFY compressed this video, it's by far the best resolution I've ever seen on a 2-hour movie at a size of only 751.96 MB.
As for the movie itself, after watching the first 15 minutes, I decided it was good enough to watch all the way through, so I paid to rent it on Amazon instant viewing. We need to support the folks who make good movies!"
,ZombiePanda,2012-04-10T03:56Z,"This looks absolutely amazing.
I don't think I've ever seen something with such good quality at such a small size, normally people upload movies with tiny resolutions so it only looks good on small monitors but it looks great on my 25'' monitor so thanks. :D Downloaded it within 30 mins I think, I'll continue to seed."
