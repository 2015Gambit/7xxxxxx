The shocking story of one man against 1,000 women!

Protesting innocence (of course), 21-year-old Anne Carson, convicted as an accomplice to a bank robbery, finds herself in prison with 3 equally glamorous cellmates in form-fitting uniforms: tough Jenny, unbalanced Dorothy, and deceptive, sweet-talking Melanee who (it's implied) makes unwanted lesbian advances toward Anne. The prison chaplain takes an interest in her case...or is it in her? As Anne meets the darker side of prison life, she learns that her greatest danger is the existence, somewhere out there, of unrecovered bank loot everyone thinks she hid.
