
A sequel from the renowned director of Swedish box office hit â€œThe Huntersâ€ from 1996.
Itâ€™s been fifteen years since Erik was forced to leave the Norrland Police Department. 
Since then he has become the National Murder Commissionâ€™s best interrogator. 
When Erikâ€™s boss orders him back to his home town to solve a brutal murder, 
he hesitantly returns as the thought of going back stirs up unpleasant memories. 
What at first appears to be a simple murder soon proves to be something much 
more complicated.
