In this edition of On the Edge, Max interviews the filmmaker and journalist Oscar Leon.

Oscar being a prominent filmmaker at various Latin American broadcasters talks about the domino effects of the Occupy movement from the United States to Latin American countries and the anti-imperialist force or a new version of Leftist movement forming in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and other countries in the region.

The broadcast of the OWS movement in the Latin American TV channels, the role the internet and social networks have played in creating and spreading this movement, the effect of Arab Spring on the 99 percent movement and much more issues are all reviewed in this edition of On the Edge.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
