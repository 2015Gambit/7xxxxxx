SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Just like in Blazing Saddles, Richard Pryor was originally cast but had to pull out of the picture. His part eventually was taken by Gregory Hines (in his screen debut). Just before filming was to begin, Pryor had his infamous drug-related accident, catching fire and getting severely burnt.

This is the second Mel Brooks film in which Harvey Korman's character has to correct someone on the pronunciation of his name. The first one was Blazing Saddles. 

Mel Brooks came up with the name for this film because he was tired of people asking him what his next movie would be. 

The vestal virgins (who took the oath of chastity) in Caeser's palace are all Playboy playmates.Hugh M. Hefner (Playboy's patron) appears as the pipe-smoking entrepreneur talking about his invention, the centerfold. 

Parts of history that are spoofed and parodied in this movie include The Dawn of Man; The Stone Age; Moses and the Ten Commandments; The Roman Empire; The Vikings; The Spanish Inquisition; World War II and The French Revolution. The only segment in this film which is not history-related is the Jews in Space sketch.
