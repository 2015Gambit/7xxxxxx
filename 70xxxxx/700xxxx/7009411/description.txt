To anybody wondering, "Aquania -Fight-" and "Event 1" would be identical tracks,
same with "Abysus -Fight-" and "Event 3", so these aren't missing, rather, they weren't added to prevent duplicates.

I'm also under the knowledge that the console versions for this game contains additional tracks that didn't make it to this specific version. Unfortunately, I won't be able to aquire these.
Hope this will do; enjoy~
