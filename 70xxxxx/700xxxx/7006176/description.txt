The First Templar is a billed as a vaguely historical adventure. Indeed it is, but not because itâ€™s set during the crusades. No, The First Templar is historical because itâ€™s a look back at dated game design, a testament to how things were once done, and how they should never be again. This is the story of a Templar named Celian, a knight who is on a quest to recover the Holy Grail. His journey takes him all over the Middle East, with stops in historical cities like Acre. At its core, The First Templar is a hack-and-slash adventure, wherein youâ€™ll be pushed through a series of environments, bludgeon tons of enemies and solve mind-numbingly easy puzzles. Itâ€™s nothing I havenâ€™t seen done better many times before.

Moments into The First Templar you know youâ€™re playing a budget game. The menus and user interface are bad with generic fonts and an intrusive heads up display. The screen is simply too crowded â€“ especially in split-screen cooperative play â€“ and it takes away from any of the ambience or occasional beauty the environments have. Games like Dead Space have shown that UI can be both elegant and serve a purpose, while The First Templarâ€™s is just phoned in
