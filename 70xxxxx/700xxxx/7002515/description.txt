Release Title Strange Wilderness 2008 BRRip 720p x264 AAC -KiNGDOM 
Directed By: Fred Wolf
Storyline When his father dies, Peter Gaulke inherits "Strange Wilderness," dad's TV show about animals. After ratings plummet and the show is canceled, we watch a long flashback to see its demise. The studio head gives the show two more weeks. An old friend brings a story about Bigfoot in Ecuador, so a long road trip ensues with stops along the way and enough problems, misjudgments, and deaths to sink a less intrepid band. Peter's team faces competition from a better-funded and more practiced set of rivals.
Who will find Bigfoot first, and will they get it on tape and save the show? Can Peter make dad proud?
