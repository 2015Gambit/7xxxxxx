It's quite a difficult thing to do actually without a good video editing program for handling the crossfades.  If you have the entire shows, you might consider uploading an entire week and letting someone else have a crack at it.
Bravo to you for having the collector's sense to tape all of these!"
,pnep,2012-02-06T02:25Z,"im not taped this, its from TDS site."
,Kitiem,2012-02-06T18:38Z,"I've been trying to take these from TDS site for ages, but I've never succeeded. 
This is awesome. Thank you. "

,eleventy4,2012-05-22T03:23Z,"Thank you very very much.  Until Comedy Central decides to put out DVD sets, this will do nicely :)"
,hameggszero,2012-07-31T11:58Z,"Thanks pnep!!! One question: How did you get these? I know they are on TDS site but can't find any way to save them. The normal Flash Downloaders, Transport Stream, TubeMaster, etc don't seem to work on TDS.com. I would like to get the first two months of 2003 that are missing from the Wendal rips. Thanks to you these episodes from 2003 are the only ones not available on torrents. "
