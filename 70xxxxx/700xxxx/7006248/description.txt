Workdone:
I used Hos DVDR iso which was a pretty good quality cam but had alot of camera movements. So I went threw the whole movie and adjusted the video. It took 25 cuts and I used null transform to make it look like the camera never moved. 99% of all black borders are gone. I also cut out the two camera drops. Didnt see any reason in keeping them in. Was only around a min for both. I also trim like 10 sec off the beginning so there was no camera movements. The AR change alot which was adjusted in my 25cuts. Took me 12 hrs to do this CAM. Also did my usual contrast, brightness, levels, saturation, and smoother adjustments. If you dont like then dont download it.

Audio: Untouched was better then average
