,fruityp,2012-03-28T17:23Z,"For those having trouble with the game crashing after character creation, follow the instructions exactly BUT instead of configuring to windows 98, do windows xp. I've only just started playing, but so far so good!"

make sure you mount the iso image.  you need two types of programs for this.  an unrar program (i use winzip) and a clone drive ( i use virtual clone drive) both programs you can get here on piratebay.  then follow the instructions exactly, except for, as fruityp pointed out, make sure you configure it for windows xp and not 98.  you should be good.

To change the size of the screen, go into graphics and click on Screen Resolution. For me 1280 x 960 made it fit the whole screen :)"
