We will be having revival services at Paran Baptist Church, from Sunday, February 26th through Wednesday, February 29th. Service begins at 7 pm each night. Tony Lynch will be preaching, and we will also be having special singing during revival. All are welcome to come in and worship the Lord with us. We are a traditional, Bible based church located at 1603 Johnsonville Hwy, in Lake City, SC. We pray that all of our visitors will receive special spiritual blessing during revival!
