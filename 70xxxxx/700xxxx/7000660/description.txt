Fred Reinfeld was one of the most prolific authors in history, having written or co-written over 200 books. Most of Reinfeld's chess books, such as the comprehensive The Complete Chess Player, 
were geared toward novice players.
 Many players received their first introduction to the game through his books. Reinfeld also wrote books for more advanced players, but they sold fewer copies. 
In 1996, Reinfeld became the 26th person inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame, and the first inducted primarily for his writing.
