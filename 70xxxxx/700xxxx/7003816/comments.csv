,Rytis89,2012-02-02T17:15Z,"working for LT+2,0?"
[V],boobsman,2012-02-02T17:29Z,"@ Rytis89, yes working on LT2.0 as long as you don't patch :)"
,Robstar360,2012-02-02T21:50Z,"Hmm.. I don't Know Why I am the only one having problems. This did not work on my Phat Xbox 360 LT+2.0 Lite-on Drive, And Soul Calibur V did not work either. I am not patching the games at all. It shows the game on the start menu but when I press A to play it says the disc is ""unrecognozable"" Is anyone else experiencing this?"
,googoo69,2012-02-02T23:04Z,"LT 3.0 is required, its VERY hard to do the trick where you can still be on 2.0 to play the 2012 releases, its a long process. Either build a jtag (or reset glitch trick) or flash up to LT 3.0"
,cnester1,2012-02-03T19:39Z,@boobsman I have LT+2.0 and haven't done any updates. Have burned several other xdg3 games. Shows the game at start also but won't load. Before I waste another disc on a re-burn can we confirm it's working on 2.0???
,fallengun04,2012-02-04T02:09Z,"@cnester1 Have you tried applying the patch? 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0_

Apply that patch and burn again."
,Robstar360,2012-02-04T12:01Z,"Just so everybody knows, With a Phat Lite-on Drive using LT+2.0 (Offline only) using this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0_
patch, ALL of the following games have worked successfully:
Final Fantasy XIII-2
Soul Calibur V
Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning

Hope this helped somebody!"

,isrmicha,2012-02-04T20:09Z,"@Robstar thanks for the tip, :D"
,Assassinprofessor,2012-02-04T23:57Z,"@Robstar360 

it worked with the patch..simple as that..thnx to you n boobsman "
,knight90,2012-02-05T11:57Z,"@ boobsman
Is this pre patched because i can't seem to get it to work and would love to know"
,knight90,2012-02-05T11:58Z,also when i patch it with abgx it doesn't work at all could you explain this for me
,knight90,2012-02-05T12:36Z,i do have 3.0 yet abgx doesn't detect it
,GSergeant,2012-02-05T13:01Z,"Thanks! I have a PHAT with LT 3.0, but I have a couple of problems. First of all if I have the game installed, it starts well but after 3 minutes it says ""failed to authenticate disk"" or something and the console restarts. Also when I press RT, works for the first time and then I have to press 10 times to work again. So I have a problem when I want to use abbillities, the icon on the right lower corner appears  and then doesn't disappear. Anyone else got the same problems?"
,nubin,2012-02-05T16:04Z,this fucking release dont work in PAL systems
,Paradoxclaw81,2012-02-06T19:57Z,"Hey guys,

So i applied the patch and it all went well, but when i burned in I got a strange error message when it verified (it burned fine). I used ImgBurn.

And when i put the game in the xbox i got the Unreadable-error. 

My question is - should i just skip the Verify-part in ImgBurn? Or doesn't that affect the actual burn? Or did i do anything wrong?"
,Paradoxclaw81,2012-02-06T20:10Z,"My previous post seems deleted, so here goes again:

Btw - im using an old Hitachi (bought the xbox in 2006), and i got LT 2.0

So i patched the game fine and burned it. It burned fine, but i got an error when it verified (i have this checked as i was instructed to, by the burn guide i got when updating to 2.0).

Error resulted in Unreadble Disk-error.

Now, i burned other XDG3-games (Arkam, Dark Souls etc) and it went fine with Verify checked. 

Should i uncheck Verify? Note that im using an old Hitachi..."
,fallengun04,2012-02-07T02:09Z,"@knight90 Yes this game is a pre-patched so if u have LT 3.0, then no need to patch it and also abgx won't verify it because it's a new game.

@Paradoxclaw81 Hey dude, try using CloneCD."
,isrmicha,2012-02-07T03:35Z,"Hey, anyone know if have title update ??? i need it to play :c"
,knight90,2012-02-07T04:25Z,"@ fallengun04 

great so all i need to do is burn it and it'll work i guess (im not noob at burning games when abgx works which is why i asked XD )"
,Paradoxclaw81,2012-02-07T08:44Z,"@fallengun04 i got an iHas burner, i was instructed to use ImgBurn but will CloneCD work better?

My question still remains: will it work if i don't ""Verify"" the burn in the end? Or doesn't ""Verify"" affect the burn? 

I just don't wanna waste a bunch of DVD:s"
,fallengun04,2012-02-07T09:15Z,@Paradoxclaw81 Sometimes I'm getting errors when I'm using imgburn so just try CloneCD and also Verify doesnt affect the burn.
,Paradoxclaw81,2012-02-07T10:52Z,"Ok, i'll try CloneCD then. And it that doesn't work i'll try ImgBurn again at 2.4x instead of 4x, w/o Verification"
,isrmicha,2012-02-07T16:10Z,"Tutorial to Burn this Game in LT 2.0 :

First download and patch the iso with this files : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0_

second : use abgx 1.0.6 on iso

Third : Use ImgBurn to burn the .dvd file, select 2x speed burn, click to start burn, SELECT TRUNCATE! w8 until burn, and PLAY"
,fallengun04,2012-02-07T16:46Z,"@isrmicha Dude.Using the abgx 1.0.6 is not recommended for those who have LT 2.0 because it will put the topology data for LT 3.0. If you dont have LT 3.0, It is recommended to use abgx 1.0.5 as it doesn't put the topology data.Using the abgx 1.0.6 after putting the patch will only bring it back to normal and will be only playable to LT 3.0 so u need to patch it again.

Here's a tutorial to burn this game or the other new games (XGD3):

1.If you have LT 2.0,Apply these patch 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0
(For LT3.0 users, skip this step)

2.Open Imgburn (must be the latest version 2.5.6.0) and go to Tools>Settings>Write. Now select Calculate Optimal if you have the iHas burner and User Specified for those who doesnt have the iHas burner and will use the truncate method.If u select User Specified, write 2086912.
(If the game you have is XGD2, the layerbreak should be 1913760.)

3.Now close the settings and select write image file to disc

4.Load the your .dvd file 

(Be sure to check your dvd file if it has the right layerbreak.If you have the iHas burner and selected the Calculate Optimal, the layerbreak in the dvd file should be 2133520.)

5.Now if you have the iHas burner, select the advanced settings (located on the lower right part). Choose the LITEON tab and enable Force HT,Online HT and SmartBurn.Disable the OverSpeed.(If you dont have the iHas Burner, skip this step)

6. You are ready to burn!"
,Paradoxclaw81,2012-02-07T17:49Z,"@fallen Abgx didn't recognize the game as an valid ISO, so i couldn't check anything...

Allow me to elaborate: ALL my downloaded games shows up as Windows Media Player file format. Now, this has not been a problem before - actually, i have never used Abgx since i don't play online. 

So, how can i change the file format and make it correct? Note that i still get an IMG-file, but it's only a few KB's and Abgx won't accept that either"
,Paradoxclaw81,2012-02-07T20:26Z,@fallengun04 i followed your inscructions and IT WORKED! Thanks for all the help m8
,fallengun04,2012-02-08T01:22Z,@Paradoxclaw81 Hey man. Glad it worked for you! :D

,rootw0rm,2012-02-10T14:57Z,bad game CRC.  will post an update on whether it's this torrent or this release.
,rootw0rm,2012-02-11T01:35Z,this unrared release available on p2p in various torrents is corrupted.  bad game CRC and stealth needs patching.  not sure if the original release is like that too.
,rootw0rm,2012-02-12T12:56Z,this is  confirmation of what i posted before.  all the torrents with the unrared iso are CORRUPTED. game crc is bad.  there is no way to fix it.  the only good torrent is the one with all the original RARs and SFV. (i.e. the original release)
,fallengun04,2012-02-12T13:58Z,@rootw0rm nahh I dont believe mate. I downloaded this and works perfectly 100% burn 100% verify ad 100% installed to HDD. Playing for hours right now.I'm Enjoying this game!
,AminAveh12345,2012-02-12T14:01Z,@rootw0rm I Smell a troll? You must be bad at burning games since it doesnt work for you it works for me and others so idk what da fuck your on about...
,rootw0rm,2012-02-13T16:47Z,"use abgx to check the game crc and see for yourself.

this has nothing to do with burning.  this is about checking the ISO first to see if it matches up with the data from verified game rips...which it doesn't"
,rootw0rm,2012-02-13T16:55Z,"btw, you can burn and play a game even though game crc is bad.  however, you will get flagged and the game will eventually crash at a certain point when it tries to read the corrupted data."
