,stormium,2012-02-01T06:17Z,"sorry, although i regularly max out my upstream when seeding torrents, this particular torrent it is in super seed mode to help offset the hit-and-runs. 

alternatively, if you wish to increase  your downspeed,  you might consider not maxing out your downstream as my log shows you have dedicated several hours of time attempting to download this torrent at an average speed of 8 kb/s.

thanks."
