SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman found the famous kissing scene quite problematic, according to Alfred Hitchcock, because of the complicated blocking that needed to be remembered in the several long takes that it took to shoot it. 

The legendary on-again, off-again kiss between Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman was designed to skirt the Hayes Code that restricted kisses to no more than three seconds each. 

Director Cameo
Alfred Hitchcock:  About an hour in, at the party in Alexander Sebastian's mansion, Hitchcock gets a glass of champagne from the bartender and quickly turns to the left and walks off screen.
