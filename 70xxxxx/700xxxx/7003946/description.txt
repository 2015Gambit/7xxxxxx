Heaven Is An Orgasm (1999)




Lords of Acid's exaggeratedly sexual acid house dance music gained a cult following with their 1991 album, Lust. Previously, the band had released three singles that laid the groundwork for the dense, throbbing Lust and its club hits, "Rough Sex" and "I Must Increase My Bust." Between their debut and their second album, 1994's Voodoo-U, the group added industrial elements to their sound and became a more straightforward, band-oriented group. At the time of their second album, Lords of Acid was led by Lady Galore (born Ruth Mcardle; vocals) and featured bassist Lord T. Byron (born Frank Vloeberghs), keyboard player Shai de la Luna, and drummer McGuinnes (born Kurt Liekens). Subsequent efforts include 1997's Our Little Secret and 1999's Expand Your Head. Farstucker followed in early 2001, as well as a series of "stript" (their term) re-releases that cut the vocals from the original albums.
