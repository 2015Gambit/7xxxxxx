Plot: Daniel Jakor is one of the most prolific and successful artists the world has never heard of. Struggling to sell his own art, he finds his true genius lies in the forgery of the great mastersâ€”artists like Picasso and Monet. Daniel is quickly pulled into a world of organized crime run by Irish crime boss. When he gets in too deep, with no way out, there is only one person who can track him down: his ex-fiancÃ©e, an authenticator from famed auction house Sothebyâ€™s. Can she find him before the FBI does, or will double-crossing the mob bring his world crashing down? In the end, if no one knows, is it really Fake?
