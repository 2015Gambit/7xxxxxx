,CalumB628,2012-02-04T18:07Z,"How do you install? I'm not used to using 7zip and all they are is .001, .002 etc files."
,asdfkjjj,2012-02-04T18:54Z,"7zip is a separate archive program,  like win-zip or winrar,  google it."
,CalumB628,2012-02-04T22:01Z,"I know, I already download it. I just don't know what to do with the files."
,athina1008,2012-02-04T23:33Z,Thank you!!!
,Pink_Taco,2012-02-05T01:19Z,strange that if you use win raw which i thought you could use to open 7 zips as well but says corrupted til i used 7zip lol
,asdfkjjj,2012-02-05T10:14Z,"Might as well consider this release nuked. Too suspicious in my mind.  Anyway,  the game is like $8 on steam anyway. May as well splurge LOL."
,Cerebral222,2012-02-06T08:22Z,"Thanks OFO, works well, Cheers."
,2142rando,2012-02-16T05:27Z,excellent release. Nicely packed.
,2142rando,2012-02-16T05:28Z,a single exe on a theta release is normal. Just self extracting with a custom ui.
