Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with researcher and author Fritz Springmeier on the Thursday, February 2 edition of the Alex Jones Show. Springmeier is the author of numerous books, including a revised edition of Bloodlines of the Illuminati, available at the Infowars Store. The 624-page, large format book is a literal encyclopedia of rare, unbelievable information that exposes the dynasties that make up the global elite. Springmeier has authored more than a dozen other books and has made multiple videos and presentations. 

Alex also covers the latest news, including the mysterious decision by Canadian film director and producer James Cameron to buy a large tract of land in a remote area of New Zealand. 

Other items covered today include a lawsuit brought against the government in the murder of a Border Patrol agent connected to Operation Fast and Furious and the decision to subject Super Bowl fans to deadly TSA radiation machines.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
