PARADOX NOTES

While Paradox Interactive normally don't use any kind of DRM on their
game releases, then their stupidity have lately been a DRM on it's own.

Customers have to deal with three, yes, it's now three complete
re-downloads of the same game, before your game is in a condition were
it's possible to patch it with their first official patch, which
consist of a exe build with Clickteam Patch Maker.

We seriously hope that this is the last time we have to fix their shit,
so you all can patch your game with an offcial patch.

NOTE:

This release has all updated content, including the v1.1.02 update,
and do also include the content from the proper fix, which we released
a few days ago.

Enjoy another Skid Row quality release!
