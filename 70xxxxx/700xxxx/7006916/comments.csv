,Marcvss,2012-02-05T02:50Z,Awesome upload... Fixed my ctd so I is one happy bunny!!!!
,viggoh-,2012-02-07T13:27Z,"Fixed the cursor problems, but it doesnt fix the in-game bug at Act III, the ""The fall of Eboracum"" quest and the quest where you are suposed to get the second Shard of the Grail.. pretty much everywhere ive turned my eyes ive seen people complaining about that bug, lots of people get stuck.. There is also several other bugs, the buff ring around your main hero doesnt apply the buffs, some locationbuffs as for Heavy infantry does not apply either.. This game is far from finished, sad to realise it before even trying to play through it, they can't have, since its impossible.."
,queball_2000,2012-02-08T16:54Z,Is SKIDROW planning on posting the 1.03 update?
,queball_2000,2012-02-08T16:57Z,The patch notes says it took care of the quest problems...but cant seem to find it anywhere. Saw a post with a person actually praising paradox for sending 3 patches two weeks after release. ':D
,queball_2000,2012-02-09T16:47Z,"PLEASE SKIDROW! 
Now we are at  v1.1.04 for the game to be working reasonably well...please help us! "
,ArkAngel666,2012-02-15T04:49Z,"^^ Wrong... =}

We're up to 1.105 ;}"
[T],Skymocker,2012-02-16T04:13Z,"^^ Also Wrong... =}

steam users are up to 1.06

ONE THING YOU CAN DO IS USE THE OFFICIAL PATCH 1.02-1.03 that fixed a major campaign issue for me.  unfortunately if you try to use the official 1.04 patch it detects a file irregularity (AKA the crack) and doesn't run.

GL, hope that helps."
,Gummiballen,2012-02-20T11:58Z,"^^ Thats why we need The 1.05/1.06 Patch
SKIDROW style"
,handel1,2012-02-23T15:06Z,"Nah, the patches after 1.03 don't work not because of crack or something but because of the shitty patcher Paradox is using. The error it gives is ""cannot check the version of XXX.cfg file"" or such. Idiots. With zillions of files to patch and patches to apply there always will be something tiny missed and the patcher will stop."
,CrucialRhetoric,2012-02-28T13:32Z,yep... but I have the uttermost belief in Skid's capabilities to come up with something beyond 1.03
,Supa_Troopa,2012-03-24T18:03Z,"hey guys, if you want to update game further check this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7126086

or this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7126074/King_Arthur_2_upade_to_1.1.06_fix_only

I know I kinda screwed these torrent names, and can't edit them which makes them hard to find :/"
