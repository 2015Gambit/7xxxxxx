For the Bewitched completist. This single-season sitcom, originally aired in the fall/winter of 1977-1978 , revolves around the young adult Tabitha (the daughter from the earlier Bewitched series, who appears to have aged rather quickly to be an adult!) in her work life at a broadcast TV station.

Instead of a husband/wife dynamic like Bewitched, the series writers attempted a similar relationship (a young female witch is encouraged to not use her magic by her non-magic male partner) as brother/sister. Seems a little creepy to have a brother and sister parroting a husband and wife, but it was important to keep Tabitha single. Why?

More than anything, this series seemed to be an attempt to clone the success of The Mary Tyler Moore Show: a young, single woman on her own in the working world. Hard to imagine now, but this was considered evolutionary in the 1970s, so it's hard to fault the creators of Tabitha for attempting to tap into that zeitgeist.

Also included in this torrent is the original 1976 pilot Tabatha.
