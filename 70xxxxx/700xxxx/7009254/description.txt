VoIP For Dummies is written for anyone who wants to reduce or eliminate their toll charges while upgrading the level of computer networking services and calling features they receive. Here you discover not only what VoIP is but how you can implement it in your company or home. (Youâ€™ll even find out whether VoIP makes a lot of sense for your situation.)
VoIP has particular appeal to those who want to use their computer network to carry their telephone calls, thereby saving the expense of running different networks for each.
If youâ€™re a consumer running broadband Internet services and you have sig- nificant toll charges each month, you should look into VoIP to make your toll calls. With VoIP running on your broadband line, you can save money each month by reducing your toll costs while still maintaining your traditional tele- phone service for local calls.
