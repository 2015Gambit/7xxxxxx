I didn't see anyone post this yet so..

This the official uTorrent client patched to enable
using the DHT feature with torrents downloaded that have
the private flag set to true.
As far as i am aware this is the last stable non beta version released for the version 2 line of uTorrent builds before v3x was released.

I can't stand version 3 ;)

If anyone is wondering what exactly i did ?
I used PeExplorer to unpack the program (UPX)
Then i patched 1 byte of code to enable DHT.
And then i added my name/date to the inside of the .exe
Thats it.

Normaly i change the icons but with this release i left them alone. Also official uTorrent versions are normaly packed with the UPX packer but i figured it would be better to share it unpacked to avoid antivirus false positives etc.

Anyways hope someone out there likes this
and if anyone has any questions let me know
