,AlbertKof,2012-02-17T09:34Z,"Great, I was looking for this.. 

I was reading this http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=9590.0 and I just needed a unmodified version of the game and this came in great timing haha.

I definitely recommend this version above any other else

This + Final Fantasy VII Remix http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=8915.0 = The best game in the world"
,planestake,2012-02-21T03:24Z,"So i installed the game and everything seemed to go smooth til I tried to run it. Mounted disc 1 with Daemon tools but I still get the message that i need to insert disc 1, 2 or 3. Tried to run as admin and mounted on every virtual drive I have and still get the same message. Any advice would be appreciated thx"
,JetXVII,2012-02-29T21:02Z,"Excuse me, I like others on here am able to set up the game itself. But I get stuck when I mount the Discs. there is no launch file in the disc portions when you mount it, so What am I to do and exactly how? If anyone could answer me today I would greatly appreciate it. I have tried the unzipping and using the daemon tools and there is still no launch file."
,0Figment0,2012-04-15T09:33Z,"Downloaded and installed this. Worked perfectly. Thanks Chaos. =D
For anyone having issue using the Num Pad as a means of controlling the game, who don't have a Game pad for your PC, but DO have a PS3 controller, check out this link: 
http://www.gamefront.com/how-to-use-a-ps3-controller-on-a-pc/
You download a program that loads drivers to enable you to use your PS3 controller on your PC. (The num pad was driving me nuts)
I'm not sure if, once you install the drivers, you have to leave the program running or not. I did, but am going to try it later without. Happy FF7-ing. ;)"

,Distort_Inc,2012-07-14T17:00Z,"@JettXVII Use the ff7.exe in c:/program files/squaresoft/final fantasy 7, or check your games folder for the startup application.

Downloaded fine. Installed fine. No issues with disk 1, 2, or 3. I get the new game/continue menu. after I pick new game the screen goes black and freezes there. Am I missing something?"
,souperlame,2012-07-31T03:10Z,"everytime I go to install this, it exits the ff7 screen and doesn't do anything.. can anyone help? I was following the guide spike02 posted ( http://freehill.net/ff7install.html )"
