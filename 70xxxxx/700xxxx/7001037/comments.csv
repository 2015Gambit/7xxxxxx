,LCSINpatria,2012-02-01T01:31Z,i liked the dark reign stuff that came after
,Caf1000,2012-02-01T02:34Z,I thought the series jumped the shark a bit when the skrull foot soldiers started looking like a poor man's super adaptoid with the costume mixes. Had its good moments. Thanks for the upload!

I mean, Ultimate Spiderman, New Avengers v1, Alias, Powers, The Pulse, his run on Daredevil... I love those books, but SI and then Siege were both terrible disappointments. SI felt rushed and had many, many inconsistencies, and Siege was just bland. The best part of SI were the background issues in Mighty Avengers and New Avengers... 
I'm also kind of getting sick of Norman Osborn, seriously, in both Ultimate Spiderman and now in the Avengers titles, it seems like the storylines just get recycled..."
