,Evilution,2012-02-05T00:53Z,"It works, extracted just fine with ExtractNow aswell, i usually use 7-zip to extract Scenelines uploads, or just watch them with MPC-HC and rarfilesource without even needing to extract it.
Get RARFileSource if you donÂ´t like to, or have no space to extract all your favourite video downloads.

+ Scenelines uploads always work for me! :p"
,CapitanShinChan,2012-02-05T03:40Z,I can't extract the file from the rar archive. It asks me for a password :(
[V],sceneline,2012-02-05T15:03Z,What you use CapitanShinChan for extract? use winrar or Use VLC player to play from rar file no need to extract if you use winrar
,FRivera,2012-02-05T20:32Z,"Sceneline, thanks for yet another top-quality upload! You never disappoint. v9 a9 and THE FCKING SHOW IS GETTING BACK ON TRACK!!!"
