,sprongle,2012-04-01T13:30Z,"Three videos that are very slickly made and do make some good points but suffer from the fact that, unlike David Icke, who preaches no religious message in all his work, the maker is a fundamentalist Christian and this really slants his views towards a ""Jesus will sort it all out for you"" attitude. The truth is Man will have to sort it all out, because the Church's image of Jesus is a false hope invented to control the populace. Do what Jesus said, not what the corrupt churches tell you he said.
The maker may be right in seeing Evil and the works of Satan in all kinds of seemingly innocuous parts of the media, but Jesus will not remedy this, because Satan is not the problem, it is the deluded men of power who believe in him just as the maker of the videos believes in Jesus."
