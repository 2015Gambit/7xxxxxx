The Tonight Show With Jay Leno 2012 01 17: Sam Worthington, Sherri Shepherd, Adam Lambert and Headlines

The video quality is watchable, but not nearly as nice as a scene release - for some unknown reason, no scene release in XviD has materialized for this. The source was non-HD, was 4:3 and this is not a digital capture.
