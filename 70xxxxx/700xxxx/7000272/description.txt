This is a look at the Israeli occupation of the peoples of Palestine 
in a movie that follows along a couple of young women conscripts into the Israeli 
army - showing some folks from Europe (obvious blondes) along the way who are joined
in too - despite much concern for their safety on the part of those they leave
behind "equally".
