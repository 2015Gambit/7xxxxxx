,vice86,2012-02-05T17:10Z,I know this if for 4.9.2 but I'm on the 4.9.3 beta....the patch did make it unlimited and activated but it also makes SAM think its at 4.9.2 and it crashes about 15-20 seconds after it gets into the 2nd song.
,LordReserei,2012-03-16T22:02Z,I have the same problem. It crashes half-way through the second song in a que. 
,the-chojin,2012-03-17T01:41Z,"yeah crashes all time i try the patch on  v 9.0 too and it makes that unstable too,  and it ask's for key when you run it which is not in the  torrent 
had to roll back to v 4.2 and lost h1,20 min of show "
,cQQKnEZs,2012-03-28T20:53Z,does anyone have version 4.9.4 cracked yet? It fixes some issues that disables me from properly streaming with my configuration. 
,Darkdragontc,2012-04-26T21:05Z,"Yeah 4.9.4 will fix all the issues, but no one has cracked it yet, so we will need to wait for a while on this one. IF needed go back an older version."
,fonyo,2012-04-28T01:11Z,SAM version 4.9.1 works fine and it doesn't exit after 2 minutes of streaming/playing. It's available on demonoid. The only difference is that it comes with a little executable file which resets the trial and this should be done once a month to keep it going i think. I'm using it for months on my 24/7 radio without problems or hassle.
,mass21,2012-06-20T03:36Z,v.4.9.6 has been out for a few weeks. Still can't find it anywhere. Shame :/
