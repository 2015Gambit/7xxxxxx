,calem1111,2012-02-20T12:43Z,why have half the video's been split into multiple files?
[T],PirateBoy,2012-02-21T14:58Z,"@calem1111

The files have been split into halves so as to make it easier to encode the videos and make the video quality better overall.

Just select all the files and drag the 1st file into VLC player. It will automatically start playing the files one after the other and u have don't even have to change the files."

,Papa_Phil,2012-08-05T02:02Z,"Hey PirateBoy,
I appreciate you posting these. I have thoroughly enjoyed them. However, I am curious to know if there is a good program for me to put the files back together. Most of the full episodes I've watched from you are a good enough quality that it doesn't bother me and it just makes it overall easier to take back and forth to other places. I would appreciate any ideas you can come up with.
Thanks,
Papa_Phil"
