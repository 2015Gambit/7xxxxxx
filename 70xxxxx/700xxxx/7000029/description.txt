NOTES:

KK sources used,same russian video but this time round line audio added from unknowns rip :)

Right first stripped unknowns line and went to remux over my encode of the russian video but came across several issues.
Firstly there was 36 secs roughly missing off the intro,1min 8 secs overlap 3/4 into the film,5.5 secs missing several mins later
and the after scene was repeated at the end ....
So bascially had to go through and add the intro audio off the russian cam ,remove the min overlap and cut where the russian video
ended......
From there i grabbed the after scene credit from youtube and added the audio off it to make a complete audio file that would fit
over my rip.
Also cleaned the audio up in adobe using a hiss removal filter aswell as changing the EQ bands.

The video i cleaned the russian video up,changed the res ....yes it looks really thin now,but due to movement in the original russian files
the AR does change slightly throughout,so i opted to pic a res i thought looked best.
Also changed all the brightness,contrast,rgb eq,chroma,sharpness you name it :lol: .
From there i took the youtube clip ,levelled it up and filtered that aswell and appended to my encode.

Readnfo ...well basically just to say yes the runtime is different to unknowns but i removed all the black screen with credit music as i didn't
see the point,but each to their own ....but now this encode as no video overlap and full intro and the end scene after the credits .
Enjoy :)

Oh ps .....
after i upped here ,i'm going to upload it to public sites so the mpaa can get my ip,but i'm a dumbass LMFAO ...:slap:
