Book Description
Clojure in Action is a hands-on tutorial for the working programmer who has written code in a language like Java or Ruby, but has no prior experience with Lisp. It teaches Clojure from the basics to advanced topics using practical, real-world application examples. Blow through the theory and dive into practical matters like unit-testing and environment set-up, all the way through building a scalable web-application using domain-specific languages, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.

Clojure is a modern Lisp for the JVM, and it has the strengths youâ€™d expect: first-class functions, macros, support for functional programming, and a Lisp-like, clean programming style.

Clojure in Action is a practical guide focused on applying Clojure to practical programming challenges. Youâ€™ll start with a language tutorial written for readers who already know OOP. Then, youâ€™ll dive into the use cases where Clojure really shines: state management, safe concurrency and multicore programming, first-class code generation, and Java interop. In each chapter, youâ€™ll first explore the unique characteristics of a problem area and then discover how to tackle them using Clojure. Along the way, youâ€™ll explore practical matters like architecture, unit testing, and set-up as you build a scalable web application that includes custom DSLs, Hadoop, HBase, and RabbitMQ.

Whatâ€™s Inside
