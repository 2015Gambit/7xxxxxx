Edgy alt-folk duo The Pines (David Huckfelt, Benson Ramsey) return with Tremolo, their follow-up album to 2007's internationally acclaimed, Sparrows in the Bell which received rave reviews including 4-stars from Q Magazine. Where Sparrows was the calm before the storm Tremolo parts the clouds and lets the sun sneak in. With its alluring acoustic melodies, gritty electric guitars and refined songwriting, David and Benson have created a modern roots masterpiece.

Recorded in only two days and produced by acclaimed producer Bo Ramsey, Tremolo has all the elements of a classic. Eloquent lyrics that are carried by two distinct voices that coalesce in a unique blend of indie-rock, folk, and blues. The grooves are textured and atmospheric while sparse arrangements construct a musical landscape that can "make you feel happy and sad almost simultaneously."

From the driving opener "Pray Tell," the haunting title track "Lonesome Tremolo Blues" to their complete re-adaptation of "Spider" John Koerner's "Skipper and His Wife" and the mournfully beautiful closing track "Shiny Shoes," Tremolo is an album that can descend through every corner of human emotion while leading the listener to the light at the end of the tunnel. An album of this significance proves why The Pines are one of the important new voices in American roots music.
