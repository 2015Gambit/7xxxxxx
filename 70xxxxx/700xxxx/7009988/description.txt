Rather than concentrate on studio sessions from 1937, this offering combines two airchecks from the Savoy Ballroom and the Meadowbrook in New Jersey. Of course, it's the Basie band in their prime with Buck Clayton as lead trumpet, a sax section with both Lester Young and Hershel Evans aboard, and the unmovable rhythm section of Freddie Green, Walter Page, and Jo Jones swinging every note. Add vocals from Jimmy Rushing and Billie Holiday and you've got a treasure trove of performances.

Disc 2:
Recording Date 1938

The Count Basie band got its big break in 1938, thanks to some stellar early Decca sides and a stay at New York's Famous Door nightclub. In fact, many feel the late '30s represent the group's best period, a time when Basie counted such jazz giants as Lester Young, Buck Clayton, Harry Edison, Dicky Wells, Helen Humes, and Jimmy Rushing among his ranks. Thankfully, Basie's many studio sides from this time have been given their sonic due on quality reissues released by the Hep and Classics labels. As for rarities like radio broadcasts and live material, though, the available examples are rare and often the worse for sound wear. The EPM label, then, should be commended for their series of late-'30s and early-'40s collections chronicling Basie's many airchecks and concert recordings. This 1938 volume includes both, with fine vocals by Humes ("Blues With Helen") and Rushing ("Boogie Woogie Blues"), as well as several cuts brimming over with top-notch solos by Young, Clayton, and Wells.

Disc 4:
Recording Date: May 27, 1944 - May 14, 1945

The V Discs

This volume is of similar vintage to Vol 3. It features 4 separate sessions, the first of which presents the same musicians as January 1944. Harry Edison and Joe Newman remain the mainstays of the trumpet section. Lester Young and Buddy Tate are still the star tenor saxophonists and Dicky Wells is the lynchpin of the trombones. The impressive rhythm section of Freddie Green, Rodney Richardson and Jo Jones is still solidly in place. Jimmy Rushing is in there taking care of vocals

These recordings are taken from V Discs and represent a troubled time for the recording industry racked by dispute. Fortunately, such troubles have not had the slightest effect on on the wonderful music of Count Basie and his men. Nevertheless the coming months would witness some important changes, with first Illinois Jacquet taking over Lester Youngâ€™s chair. The new generation is thus already in the wings ready to bring a change in continuity (or perhaps  rather to ensure a continuity in change) But the Basie team is constantly up to the task in hand, as sparklingly relaxed as ever
