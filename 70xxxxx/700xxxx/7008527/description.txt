RAGE is a groundbreaking first-person shooter set in the not-too-distant
future after the asteroid Apophis impacts Earth. In an effort to save
civilization, "Arks" are constructed and buried deep underground.
These cryogenic lifeboats carry humanity's future, preserved with
the tools they need to rebuild. But when survivors begin to emerge,
they find the unexpected. Many humans who were above ground during the
impact unexpectedly survived, while horrific mutants roam the dead cities.
And a mysterious tyrannical government, bent on creating a new world order
has begun the search... for you.
