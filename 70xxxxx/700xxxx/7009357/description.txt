With many illustrations of Keely's inventions and diagrams of his theories, Free Energy Pioneer also explores secret societies and occult orders, examines the influence of these mysterious techno-occultists and their incredible ideas and discusses Keely's final idea: the ultimate evolution of humans through free-energy. 450 pages. many pictures.
