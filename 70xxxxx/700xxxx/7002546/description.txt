The Allman Brothers Band
Instant Live 2004
Tweeter Center, Mansfield, MA 8/21/2004

OFFICIAL RELEASE [320k MP3]

The excitement of the crowd was matched only by the fiery performance of the band as they returned to the former Great Woods with a spectacular show. Several newer songs like "Key to the Highway," "Gilded Splinters," and "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" were introduced to a hearty welcome. The amazing sequence of "Liz Reed" into "Mountain Jam" has a really cool tease of "Afro Blue" you just have to hear. This alone is worth the price of admission!
