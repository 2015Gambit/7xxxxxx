,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-02T14:30Z,"@troncaso2. Sandra is the No.1 forever, yes, but haven't you still understood that she quit nearly 2 years ago. All her FG sets are very old, from when she was 18yo (Sets 1-100 actually sometimes when she was 16-17 yo). She turned 20 yo on 14.11.2011 and is not modeling anymore. "
