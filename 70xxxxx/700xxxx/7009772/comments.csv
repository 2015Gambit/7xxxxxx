,DACPRIME,2012-02-05T06:52Z,"This Version 10.0.2.0.4269 has a well known bug, any program such as uTorrent with an ""open containing folder"" option, Dopus opens a 2nd lister after about 30 seconds.

This bug is fixed in beta version 10.0.3.1.4402. Unfortunately I have not yet figured out the new blacklisting protection. "
,snubz,2012-02-10T03:29Z,"Thanks for this DACPRIME. Is the bug you mentioned only problematic when you set Dopus to replace explorer? 

The protection on this software is crazy. Hard to get it working sometimes. Great file manager, just wish it didn't cost more than the OS it's running on. :("
,DACPRIME,2012-02-25T14:11Z,"If you don't have Dopus replacing explorer the ""open containing folder"" option just opens an explorer window, no bug."

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\DlgInfo\

Would you update un-blacklisting guide for W7"
,Sakunne,2012-03-01T14:58Z,"This one works fine, though blocking Inernet via hosts file doesn't work like it's described in included un-blacklisting guide - it still finds and suggests new updates.
Blocking internet using Comodo firewall works fine."
,mmm_9,2012-09-28T00:38Z,"Following the guide the license was accepted the problem is that when you are trying to bypass directory opus activation,after 5 minutes of using it the files are not read correctly and you have to restart the program once and once again.
Is there any solution for this?"
