Go here : http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20101105035304606
and read one of the last comments made by user melby.ruarus and follow his instructions.

(Although those instructions are for Snow Leopard, but they should also work for Lion!)

After you do that, go into the Applications folder, select System Preferences, Get Info and choose Run in 32-Bit Mode.

Now You can go to the Screen Saver preference pane, choose iKaleid as the screensaver and it will work!"
