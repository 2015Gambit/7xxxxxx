very watchable. great movie. I will watch again when HD version is released.

Thanks for the upload!"
,MisticBane,2012-02-06T00:28Z,"BTW - to the uploader... thank you for the effort. It was at least an effort to provide a ""watchable"" cam which is more than most can say. So, thank you."

V: 8
A: 2"
