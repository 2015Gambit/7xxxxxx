,MuserClair,2012-02-02T22:21Z,"damn right MrD.
i checked out your other tpb uploads and they're mainly pc games, one with a positive comment on it.  BUT.. ..most appear untrustworthy with links to external sites, sometimes for the file you're supposedly uploading!  it looks suspicious and tpb regulars won't waste their time on something that looks fake.. ..even if you're genuine.
tbh, anything that requires a password from an external site screams scam.  and this torrent bears an uncanny resemblance a torrent uploaded over a year ago that i've just found on another website, which was identified by several downloaders and a moderator as fake.
i suggest you just accept the good folks of this fine peer-to-peer community don't want the crap you're putting out.
jog on...."
[T],MrDowntown,2012-02-03T06:30Z,right on

@MuserClair

i've uploaded this torrent for people who want to help me find the password for it. i did not mean to post any fake torrents or anything like that. oh, and if you dont wanna download my torrents, then dont. i really dont care"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-02-04T23:06Z,"Then you are the one who fell for the scam. I would bet you good money that this file (if you were to ever find a password) is not legit. People post these files, rar/zip claiming to be 'something' [They ARE NOT], to receive the 'password' you must take surveys and enter personal information. You do not ever receive a password only links to more surveys and offers. If you use a program to crack the password, the file says it is corrupt, because it is. It is a fake file. This is a scam. Also, look at comics we have uploaded, look at the sizes, a SMALL comic, few pages bad quality is about 15MB, this is an entire collection at 6.55MB... really?? Come on. Use logic next time, And if you really thought this was real, here is my advice, wait till you GET password, unlock and verify, before uploading. "

 well, i guess ur right. i shouldn't have fallen for this. i'll try to get the books myself and upload them here. thanks for the advice ;) 
(p.s i'll delete this torrent tomorrow, assuming that u read this.)"
,MuserClair,2012-02-07T14:08Z,"fair comment, ipodmonesta.
MrD is just looking out for everyone who dl's from tpb, and his advice is good advice.. ..follow what he's said and you'll not go far wrong :)"
