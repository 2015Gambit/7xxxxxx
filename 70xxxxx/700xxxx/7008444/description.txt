Adobe CS5 SOPA Suiteâ„¢ (PortableApps.com Format)
"No installation, No trash left behind, Not ThinApp"

Category: Graphics - Design
Stealth: Yes (http://www.portablefreeware.com/faq.php)
Format: PAF (http://portableapps.com/)
Dependencies: Admin. Rights
Compatibility: WinAll, 32/64

Notes: My earlier releases were done in a hurry, almost roughshod. This release
is the result of hours of personal usage & testing. I also removed 
'3D Invigorator' from Photoshop because it's poorly designed and crashes alot.
Plus it's quite simple to create 3D Text effect (ALT + Arrow key). In addition,
a few other features are now working like Image Processor, Kuler, etc.

Synopsis: I am extremely anal when it comes to apps. leaving trash on my PC.
The only apps. on my PC that are installed is ESET and VMware. Everything else
is on D drive and portable. Why? notice how fast your computer is when you first
get it? that's because there aren't tons of installed software to bog down the
OS. This is why i refuse installation. 

This suite is NOT for career graphics designers. This is portable, thus NOT all
features will be available... most notably features that require background
services to be installed like 'switchboard'.

PERFORMANCE NOTES
-----------------
â€¢ Why use this over ThinApp? because this utilizes your PC's resources like RAM,
and Graphics RAM, GPU, etc. ThinApp is unable to.
â€¢ This has a slower load time because it has to copy files into certain places.
Be patient. First launch is always the longest because it has to initiate files.
Afterwards, it's faster. Also, when exiting, be patient and let it clean up 
after itself...  15 seconds is usually sufficient.
â€¢ Another benefit is you can add plugins, presets, etc.. just copy into the
respective folders.
â€¢ This is not really recommended for USB usage.. if you're a USB user.. you want
a ThinApp'd version. This is most beneficial for home users who use portable
apps. on their home PCs.
â€¢ If you're not familiar with the benefits of PortableApps.com Format.. 
than you do not need this.
