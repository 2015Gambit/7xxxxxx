HOW TO FIX.. after installing do this:
=======================
1. Navigate to AcrobatXPortable > App > DefaultData > Common.
2. Delete 'Adobe PCD' folder.

If it's already been installed, and used.. also delete here:
- AcrobatXPortable > Data > Common > Adobe PCD.

* this fixes Acrobat from closing after a few seconds.
* i apologize for the goof-up.

If you want a new PAF installer with this issue fixed:

im not sure how many people are familiar with Lightroom. Graphics Designers from the old school are familiar with a program called iView MediaPro: which was great for making Catalogs of Stock, Vector, PSD Graphics. But it was bought out by Microsoft, discontinued and ruined. 

Lightroom is iView Media Pro on Steroids :)
It has 1000x's more templates and all are stunning. If you're a graphics designer or uploader of graphics: you want to check out Lightroom!

Here's a quick sample i uploaded to show the similarity to iView Media Pro:
