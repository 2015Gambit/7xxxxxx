Obviously, such power comes at a price. The SPSS download is pretty large, and once you do have the program installed, itâ€™s a pretty steep learning curve until you find your feet. You could argue that SPSS is actually a glorified version of Excel, but with far more options and power behind it, itâ€™s an impressive beast. As a result, domestic users may be intimidated and would be better off getting started on a simpler data management app.

If youâ€™re serious about statistics, then SPSS is as good as it gets.

Hundreds of graphical options
