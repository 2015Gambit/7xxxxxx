SlaxArcade 1.0.0 - Saturday, 4 Feb 2012

[Introduction]
I would like to announce the public release of a small project that Ive been working on called SlaxArcade. Its a LiveCD based on Slax that includes all your favorite games, ready to play! It should run on (almost) any computer. It started out as a hobby, but so many people have enjoyed it that I wanted to release it to the public.
