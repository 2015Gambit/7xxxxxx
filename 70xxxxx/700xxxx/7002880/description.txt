SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Jack Nicholson shaved his head for the film. Morgan Freeman wore a bald cap.

Both director Rob Reiner and actor Morgan Freeman independently thought of Jack Nicholson to play the role of Edward Cole. 

In one of the scenes where Edward and Carter are playing gin, Carter wins very quickly, and Edward asks, "Are you the Devil?" Jack Nicholson played the Devil in The Witches of Eastwick and 'Morgan Freeman (I') played God in Bruce Almighty and Evan Almighty.
