SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Christoph Waltz (Cardinal Richelieu) has the same birthday (October 4) as Charlton Heston, who played Richelieu in The Three Musketeers/The Four Musketeers: Milady's Revenge

Playing Rochefort, Mads Mikkelsen in this movie wears an eye-patch over the very same left eye that his Le Chiffre character wept blood in Casino Royale. It's also over the eye Mikkelsen missed in Valhalla Rising when playing the viking warrior/spirit known as One-Eye. 

At the beginning of the movie, the map of Europe shows several states and kingdoms of that era. However, in Germany, a fictional kingdom west of Bavaria called "Wurzburg" is shown (slightly misspelled, as the original spelling is "WÃ¼rzburg"), the name of a Franconian city where major parts of the movie were shot.
