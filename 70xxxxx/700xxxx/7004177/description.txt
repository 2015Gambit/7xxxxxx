Eric says...
BLUES, BALLADS & WORK SONGS is an album I have been working on for most of my life. Its release coincides with my 60th birthday and it celebrates the music that first inspired me to become a guitar-playing singer. Being as passionate about writing songs as I am about singing and playing traditional material, I couldn't resist including the self-penned tunes at the end of the record. These newer songs, are the 'children' of the older ones.
