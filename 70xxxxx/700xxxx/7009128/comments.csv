,spambuster32,2012-02-04T21:04Z,"This is a fake.
Top.Gear.S18E02.1080i.BBCHD.h264.avi: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract

The zip contains Top.Gear.S18E01.1080i.BBCHD.h264 which indicates another fake by the same guys: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6992710/Top.Gear.S18E01.1080i.BBCHD.h264

The torrent includes a Read Me.txt which asks anyone with replay issues (which would be everyone, considering it's a zip file!) to install a ""codec"". The link is the a website loaded with ads, and likely malware.
