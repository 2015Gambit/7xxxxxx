Bourvil has invented a revolutionary bicycle and tries his luck in the Paris-San Remo ,a cycles race circa 1900.Abetted by his wife (monique TarbÃ¨s, with her shrill voice) ,but pursued by a creditor (Robert Hirsh) who wants his money back,he will experience lots of events before the finish.A good use of the wide screen and good colors are assets.A nod to Lamartine gives an intellectual touch: a girl (Jocelyne) is dressed up as a boy and they call her "Jocelyn" like in the writer's poem.One of the cyclists will spend the whole race floating on a river,which gives a surrealistic touch too.

Pleasant movie, with a very nice Bourvil.
