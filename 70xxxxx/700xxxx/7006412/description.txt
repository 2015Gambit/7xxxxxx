Have you ever wondered how does it actually feel like when you are able to put on sleep Amnesia's grunt. This time, you are not only forced to survive, but also to win. Forget about heavy artillery, firearms or standard cold weapons, all you need is a plain snowball and a simple goal, smash it in the grunt's face. Have fun.
