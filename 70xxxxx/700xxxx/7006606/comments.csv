,caveacane,2012-02-06T01:01Z,The rar file is password encrypted. Anyone know what it is??
,L3GiTPro,2012-02-06T04:47Z,"@caveacane  There is no RAR archive you fuck tard and the proof is in the files.  Just view the files by clicking the number 9 at the top of the page beside the word Files:  Copy everything you see in the section that shows the files.  Paste it into note pad and you will clearly see that it is a mkv file.  Or you could just copy the line where the rest gets cut off.  To do that just put your mouse to the right side of the screen until only that line is selected and nothing else.  If everything is selected, you went to far.

It just goes to show that there is people out there trying to fuck up other people work for no fucking reason.  Fucking TROLLS!"
