Workdone:

The reason for V2 is because I had V1 using russian audio to fill the no english spots. My V2 turned out alot better then my V1. I used Lum1x full video source and added Unknown end credits but cut out the black screen which now goes straight to the credits and the wolf lying on the ground at the end. I lower the contrast a bit and added, brightness, sharpness, saturation and adjusted the levels to the best I could.

Audio:

Not sure what happen in unknown audio source but there was 2 repeats in the audio. One spot was right before they cross the homemade rope and the end credit repeated. So I had to clean all that up and resync it to my video. Also did a denoiser and audio enhancements. Enjoy All, Alot of work was done on this.
