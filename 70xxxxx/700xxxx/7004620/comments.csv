,thenoobest1,2012-02-04T02:34Z,why aren't more movies under 4gb with DTS audio? 
,oldtimer48,2012-02-04T02:39Z,"From the part I have seen, A/10, V/10, awesome quality, thank you for sharing Hackulus, great copy"
,mepori,2012-02-04T08:57Z,"Audiovisual quality was fine, but the movie itself is an insult to taste. Get the 1973 version instead. Its out in blu-ray on Pirate Bay."

,tuloon,2012-02-08T12:22Z,So this might be a stupid question.  Why are all the HD movies in 2.35:1.  I mean does everyone have a super wide tv? Or am I missing something
,jomurr123,2012-02-09T06:45Z,"*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
VIDEO = 9 OUT OF 10
AUDIO =6.5 OUT OF 10
MOVIE =5 OUT OF 10

Worth checking out , audio out of sync a little bit "

,Tech-Noir,2012-03-04T14:51Z,"Most movies are in 2.35:1 because that is how they are filmed and presented in most cinemas. They could theoretically, most of the time, change aspect ratio, but that would mean eitheradding space to the top or bottom of the frame, or cutting out information left/right. And when the framing of a shot is dependant of 2.35:1 aspect ratio, changing it will compromise the intention of the director/DP etc.

Though I just have to ask, if you are worried by the resolution, why are you commenting on a 720p rip? Surely the 1080p versions will satisfy you more. Also most video players will allow you to define the aspect ratio to for example 16:9, if you want to cut off the sides in order to fill the entire TV/screen you are displaying on."
