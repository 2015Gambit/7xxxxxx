anyhow--- the missing description

===

I found these on various webpages. I thought i put it in
a collection.

Im sure theres more from the same developers out there
but couldnt find them so if you have some perhaps share your collection


Enjoy and Help to seed please

Note! I found on my phone they could initially crash or lock up
but seem to sort them selves out after 3 tries
they would crash on click play or when got the free spins
I found them more stable if choose 6 reels
i suspect it something to do with the phones screen
may work better on larger screen androids
my phone is a vodafone 858 low entry level"
