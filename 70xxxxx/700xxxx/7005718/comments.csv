So, if the video and sound quality is questionable it's 'cause I had to work with the shitty resolutions available that someone else provided, and having up to 6 parts sometimes, I had to re-encode them all into 1 file, and I did the best that I could using Ultra Video Joiner. I've included a Word.doc in the torrent, a list of all the episodes in 10 seasons (they were actually on for that long...?) and the ones I have here are blackened out, leaving the rest as a list to go by if anyone cares to try and make out a more complete collection. And if anyone has better resolutions of any of the eps. in this torrent, by all means, share. And leave feedback, including links to the ones other people would be wanting to add to their own collections, but only having to do with this series: Secrets of the Dead. Thanks, and you're welcome.... ;)"

,dielaughing3,2012-02-07T08:02Z,"Still waiting/wanting someone/anyone to pop up in here and say something to the effect of what a great show this is and perhaps how to rip the rest of the missing episodes off of: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/category/episodes/ .. I mean sure, just take the lazy way and watch them on their site, or be a collector of many things, like me, and try to make collections complete w/o sending PBS $24.99 + shipping for each episode. I rather think the networks and the media have paid them aplenty already."

The electronic music made for SOTD is individual to each episode, never playing the same theme twice, aside from the intro song. The creators of SOTD really did a fantastic job with this. If there was a soundtrack of all the many multilayered sequences of sound made for all these episodes, I'd snatch that in a hot second! Really, this is an awesome show packed full of history from the dawn of time.. and they didn't have a pussy making music for the show either. Give a little appreciation for the goods I gathered up from all over the place.. and by all means, if you have a better resolution, copy of any of these episodes, do share them and leave links for others to follow. I just got in the Japanese SuperSub from somewhere that is much higher quality than the one in this torrent. I suppose I'll upload it for you guys now.. but any time someone wants to chime in and make this a better, more complete collection, I'll thank you kindly for chipping in, and saying something about this.. would be great. 'Cause so far, I'm the only one who's said anything at all about this torrent. ~ Now, as for that SuperSub.. I'll upp it now. You're totally welcome, ye silent posse of leachers."

Thanks dude. Just starting to download now. I have looked all over the net as well and you have a lot more than I could find. Thanks for the time and effort you must have put in, and thanks for seeding. I will continue to see for as long as I am able.

Thanks again!"
