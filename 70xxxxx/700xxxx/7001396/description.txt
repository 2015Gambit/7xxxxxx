 A hockey enthusiast since 12 years of age, 
 Toronto-based Rajvinder Singh, even went   
 to the extent of trimming his hair,        
 discarding his Pagri/turban, did not       
 complete his education, incurred the wrath 
 of his father, Darvesh, who wanted him to  
 be involved in the family business as well 
 as confirm and respect Sikh religion       
 principles and values. Hoping to play      
 professional hockey, Rajvinder, along with 
 other fellow Sikh players, instead finds   
 himself treated as the object of ridicule, 
 referred to as a 'joker', by mainstream    
 Caucasian players. Even his friends tease  
 him and ask him to take up 'Guli Danda'    
 and Kabaddi', while his father makes him   
 work for Uncle Sammy as a truck driver. He
