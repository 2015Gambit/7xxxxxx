,Xpatriated,2012-02-10T21:36Z,"Just like to point out how Liefeld drew Damian in this issue.  Looks like he's maybe 18, 20 years old.  Is supposed to be about 10.  Great job Liefeld.  Now we have women, feet, faces, hands, and kids scratched off the list of what you are capable of sorta drawing/tracing.

I know!  Let's put this guy on 3 more books!  Yeah!

Dammit."
