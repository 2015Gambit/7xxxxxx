Description

Plot: Set â€˜around 1950â€², The Deep Blue Sea tells the story of Hester Collyer, the younger wife of High Court judge Sir William Collyer, who has embarked on a passionate affair with Freddie Page, a handsome young RAF pilot troubled by his memories of the war. The majority of the film takes place during one day in Hesterâ€™s flat, a day on which she has decided to commit suicide. Her attempt fails and as she recovers, the story of her affair and her married life is played out in a mosaic of short and sporadic flashbacks. We soon discover the constraints of Hesterâ€™s comfortable marriage, which is affectionate but without sexual passion. As Hesterâ€™s affair is discovered she leaves her life of comparative luxury and moves into a small dingy London flat with Freddie. Hesterâ€™s new lover has awakened her sexuality, but the reckless, thrill-seeking Freddie can never give her the love and stability that her husband gave. Yet to return to a life without passion would be unbearable. The film takes its title from her dilemma.
