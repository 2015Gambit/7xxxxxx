Now, I know the keygen shows up as a virus, but I found a MBR virus called rikvm on my computer after installing. Now, I can't be 100% sure it was from this file, but my computer started running very slowly after installing. I was able to clean it with Norton Power Eraser- Norton Security Suite did not pick it up."
