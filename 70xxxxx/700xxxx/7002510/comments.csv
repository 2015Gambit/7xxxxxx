,ChubZz,2012-02-15T23:54Z,"What do i do to import the Models? I used the TK17 Content importer to do the rest but it will not import the models

Any help would be appreciated"
,Wisher_SiD,2012-02-16T10:10Z,"When you install the content from this content pack, just run the game and it will automatically import them."
,us01,2012-02-20T19:05Z,"So what is the 'The Klub 17 v630 (3D SexVilla 2)'

Is the '3D SexVilla 2 v114+WhiteRabbits Booster Mod 0.1' + 'The Klub 17 Content Pack v11' a better version?

But the old versioin is 'v630' and the new version is 'v11'? Please explain.

Tanks."
,Nakorentreri,2012-02-21T07:56Z,"same as us01

Is that better version compared to the 530 or is the same or what? if anyone can explain the difference id apreciate it ^^ also if u keep the 630 version...do u need to install only or u need to import the data ? cause i installed first didnt seem to work but import seemed to put more scenes or positions but not more models or dresses and stuff so im at a lost here eheh"
,Nakorentreri,2012-02-21T08:02Z,small edit : when i first writed 530 i meant 630 v.
,Empfmil,2012-02-21T17:47Z,"Getting an error message every time I try to unpack the content, and I've tried everything I can think of to get it to extract! Any one else experiencing this and know what's wrong?!?!?!"
,Wisher_SiD,2012-02-22T17:08Z,"v630 is actually an older version than v114, since v630 is basically a version of the mod, while the game version should be 93 or something around that.
So you should get v114, since its the latest so far.
Also, this content pack is created for those older versions up to v630, so its not tested on versions after that, which is why its recommended to be used on v630.

Hopefully, you'll understand all of this crap i wrote... ;)"
,ptwist,2012-02-27T06:43Z,"Thanks uploader! Great torrent. 

Any chance you could look in to getting the other Thrixx stuff? Hentai3d, etc?"
,johnmourik,2012-02-28T17:06Z,"thanks for the upload!
If you get error when importing, try to run as administrator(right click) in windows 7.
It starts importing no problem"
,DHSDunner,2012-03-01T13:15Z,"I have got the same problem as Empfmil. I try to extract the file, but when it's on 99%, it says error. what should we do with that?"
,Lestat57,2012-03-05T16:58Z,"Takes FUCKING HOURS to import poses. Still installing and losing my mind here.
Anyway thanks to the uploader, other than that it looks fine. "
,Wisher_SiD,2012-03-05T20:46Z,"@Empfmil and DHSDunner: I know its a stupid answer, but since i can't think of anything that could be the problem, have you tried redownloading the pack?

@ptwist: Well, there's 3D Hustler, which is basically the same as this and Hentai3D, which ill try to upload as well."
,lifesaveyear,2012-03-16T19:45Z,lol i figured it out just when before you download it put capobility to windows vista pack 2 and thats it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,dred05,2012-05-04T20:12Z,"i'm confused I installed it but it can't find the klub 17 at the selected location...I continue anyway and installed it on the same folder I installed the game. I still can't see the new content. 

Am I doing it wrong? Help? :P"
,ikillforfun,2012-05-29T02:08Z,hi i had the same problem as dred05 so any help would be appreciated
,MousE0910,2012-07-13T15:37Z,"Thanks for the game and content pack man. It's very hard to find this. You rock!

Since you say you're open to requests, do you think you could try to find and upload Kink 3D game? (http://www.3dkink.com)
It seems to be the same engine as SexVilla but it's not made by ThriXXX. I have been looking for it for ages. Thanks!"
,NaWaR1337,2012-09-01T18:06Z,"GUIDE HOW TO GET THE ""CONTENT PACK"" TO WORK:

1. First of all i am using the game ""The klub 17"" Which i downloaded here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6747024/The_Klub_17_v630_(3D_SexVilla_2) 

2. If you have this version installed everything should work like a charm. 

3. Download the pack and then install, When installed many people wonder where do the files go and what do i have to do now? 

4.To finish the hole procedure go into ""C:"" or where you hade your game installed, look for the map called ""TheKlub17"".

5. When you you have found the map you'll have to start looking for at program called ""Content Importer"", this program should be found inside the ""TheKlub17"" map.

6. Doubble click the program and let it run, Be patient and let it run, it's going to take a couple of hours to finish, about 3-4 hours. The key here is just to be patient! :)

7. When the program is done, press ""close"" and start the game. Enjoy!

8. If you've followed all this steps everything should work just fine. "
