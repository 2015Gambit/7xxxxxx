Funk fans & hip hop fans alike should enjoy this album. 
Although the choice of tracks may be a little obvious the quality can't be questioned! 
Even if you've only got a passing interest in funk you can't fail to enjoy such classics as the Blackbyrds "Do it fluid" or Kool and the Gang's dirty "Funky Stuff". 
I'd almost say this album is worth buying for one track alone - "Express Yourself" A J.B's style piece of funk genius sampled by NWA for their track of the same name.
In short the perfect starting place for novice funkateers - all killers, no fillers  (Customer from Amazon)
