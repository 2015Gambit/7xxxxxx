a9/v10"
,99jay88,2012-03-22T17:02Z,Can anyone verify that this torrent contains ALL episodes?
,analogreflections,2012-03-22T22:25Z,You can see file list and compare it to imdb
,analogreflections,2012-03-27T01:17Z,"It is complete series, just like it says in description. I've watched it all myself. 
Guys, please seed as long as you can, thnx"
,99jay88,2012-04-14T03:46Z,"Whew.  Finally downloaded the entire torrent.  I will seed as long as I can.  I don't have a great ISP for upload speeds so I will only be uploading at about 37 kB/s.  

The quality of the files is OUTSTANDING.  As stated, they are recorded from TV so there are pop up ads and such, but that doesn't bother me  at all.  

Seinfeld in HD!  Is this heaven?

P.S.  Having the file names also including the episode title would be a nice touch.  It took me a while to name them all.  Not complaining though as I am SUPER happy just to have them."
,analogreflections,2012-04-16T18:15Z,"@99jay88

I'm glad you're satisfied with the quality. I should have renamed them too, that's true. 
Just curious, how long did it take you to download it, what was avg speed? It took me more than a month to upload lol :) 
peace"
,junzmyfav,2012-05-02T06:50Z,"I plan to re-release this with names, subtitles included, and .m4v. Also a MUCH smaller size but with negligible loss of quality."
,qofbored,2012-05-04T19:23Z,Looks good! I will keep seeding as soon as I have it complete.
,Bodhi2010,2012-07-12T14:32Z,"i need a new HDD for this :D
