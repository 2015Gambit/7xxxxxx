[V],psspss,2012-02-04T08:14Z,"sccording to the aftershows this is correct naming

momentum named everything wronmg when the specials aired

they specials are just that not normal episodes
they SP00_1 and SP00_2

i also make aftershow compilations and named them
specials also not to be confused with reg naming"
