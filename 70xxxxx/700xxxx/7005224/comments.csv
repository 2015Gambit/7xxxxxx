,pokkiri,2012-02-03T10:56Z,"@HDvideos great work guys,

if possible, could you upload all new malayalam/Hindi movies in 720p ? (1280x720)

Now a days people started to watch movies on their TV using (PS3/AppleTV/video player like iOmega/Western digital). 
watching on PC are those old days."
,praveen89,2012-02-12T14:05Z,video is good. Very bad audio. it feels really boring while listening in 5.1 theater system. It is 5.1 but no quality Please do consider the quality of audio too. Our ears are more sensible than eyes.............
