Some real effort went into this hardcore version of the all-female heist caper "Set it Off." In this one, breasty beauty Midori stars as the ringleader of their criminal venture, convincing her dazzling gal pals to help her pull off a bank robbery that'll make them all rich. While the plot itself falls by the wayside after a while, the sex remains at a fever pitch from start to finish. After a sultry lesbian opener that perfectly sets the stage for what's to come, we leap right into one of the most explosive scenes in the video. Monique pulls out all the stops in a hip-grinding blast with Devlin Weed that shows her at her down-and-dirtiest. A super-charged, ultra-energetic bangtango that doesn't let up. Midori lets her hair down in another great scene, taking on T.T. Boy in a slam-bang sexfest that doesn't end until both performers are totally spent. Midori's at her best here, driving the scene forward with her relentless hunger for more. Delicious Milano shines in a steamy set-to with Julian St. Jox, and Midori returns for a frantic final scene with the film's director, Mr. Marcus. While the acting is over the top, so is the sex, so it all balances out in the end. A first-rate effort all the way, with some excellent video work and the highest of porno production values.
