,premiado,2012-02-02T07:46Z,Thanks.
,sync390,2012-02-02T07:46Z,Still can't use mods.
,simolino,2012-02-02T07:50Z,@scene4all this better not be fake or my rat will crawl into your asshole and gnaw your entrails until you bleed to death through your asshole!!!
,ricocche,2012-02-02T11:35Z,Works but anyone notice any changes in performance like the critics said?
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-02-02T12:37Z,"Patch 1.4 works perfectly for me, so I'm not going to risk messing up my game again."
,ricocche,2012-02-02T13:43Z,Hmm.. I can't feel the 60% performance increase that they say about this patch. Or maybe I'm just running a lot of graphic enhancement mods. I dunno. Can someone confirm the boost?
,CookieMunzta,2012-02-02T13:48Z,"I've had many mods working since Update 2.
So far the only way I've discovered getting the 'Data Files' option to show up in the SkyrimLauncher was to delete everything in C:\Users\*USERNAME*\Documents\My Games\Skyrim
But don't forget to back up your saves first."
,3da2a31da,2012-02-02T17:21Z,"Update works fine.
I noticed a nice increase in fps in CPU intensive areas such as big cities, and all the mods work fine. Remember to update your SKSE.

HOWEVER! One side effect is that the game crashes / freezes every now and then, as opposed to before, when it never did, at least for me. Dunno if bad patch or bad crack."
,Machine4578,2012-02-02T17:36Z,"@CookieMunzta
You are right you can access the data file option after you delete the files. I also noticed an increase in performance too. Thanks for your input."
,brianxxx,2012-02-02T17:58Z,"Performance increases might not be as obvious for many people because Skyrim (like Oblivion) leans a lot on the CPU. So, you might have a slammin' Vid card but if your CPU is older or weak you are going to get left behind at times with this game or similar."
,Gigakos,2012-02-02T18:05Z,works fine with me
,ricocche,2012-02-02T19:09Z,"@brianxxx Hmm might be, might not be the case. I'm running an i5 2.3ghz (2.7 turbo), 8gb ram , Gtx 560m. Pretty decent for gaming. Maybe the 60% boost is 1.4 vs 1.3.10 without skyboost/tesval though, and because I used Skyboost I really cannot tell the performance increase then. Maybe a 1-2 fps I suppose, but I guess these mods are really killing my fps: 2k textures, fxaa injector, enb, ambient occulsion, and a bunch of 2048+ texture mods. Oh.. I'm killing it. ;)"
,CookieMunzta,2012-02-02T19:39Z,"Those texture mods aren't too demanding on modern a GPU, so I wouldn't worry there, however the shadow rendering in Skyrim relies heavily on CPU usage, so older dual core users might not see as big a difference as they may have been hoping for. SkyBoost can somewhat counter that, however."
,ricocche,2012-02-02T20:59Z,@CookieMunzta Skyboost is no longer needed at 1.4 as they say (since it does the same thing with 1.4) 
,bambarbio,2012-02-02T22:22Z,I need previous updates?
,CookieMunzta,2012-02-02T23:39Z,"@ricocche
A friend of mine who owns Skyrim on Steam had said the same thing. Not sure if I'll update just yet though personally.

@bambarbio
No, you don't. All Skyrim/Fallout updates contain previous updates within them."
,Pukavac,2012-02-03T02:21Z,"I registered just so i could comment on this. Seeing people complain how there is no performance boost, well, here is how it works out for me. I used to have a crapy phenom processor and was getting 50ish fps outside and 30ish in towns. I replaced it with an i5 2500k and my fps jumped to 60+ outside or 40 - 50ish in towns. After this update i`m getting at least 60 fps anywhere. Finally Bethesda GJ! A little late but GJ!"
,lamole234,2012-02-03T04:00Z,Anyone seed please??
,jredkai,2012-02-03T08:16Z,so is this the 1.4 update?? I don't see that info
,3da2a31da,2012-02-03T13:21Z,"@jredkai

Yes this is latest patch that updates your game to 1.4.21 version.
Now let's hope they'll hurry the fuck up with CK : /"
,brianxxx,2012-02-03T14:58Z,"Seriously! Can't wait to play with the Creation Kit! lol Should be within the next 2 or 3 weeks...just my impression from what I have been reading, plus the vids they have been releasing on it."
,Zaharus,2012-02-03T15:22Z,"Thanks, everything works :)"
,JDFan,2012-02-03T16:21Z,"This one works fine -- though did have a couple problems launching the game after patching ( forgot to remove all of the SKSE and Skyboost files !) - so anyone using it be sure to remove the files from you folder before patching as they have not updated it yet for this new patch and game will not launch with them in place.  
Other than that everything seems to be working properly and performance seems as good or slightly better than when using Skyboost and 1.3.10 version."
,bambarbio,2012-02-03T17:16Z,Thanks CookieMunzta for quick answer!
,Personify,2012-02-03T17:47Z,Sweet thanks. Includes ALL previous updates and 5! Thanks a lot.
,EverRusting,2012-02-04T01:33Z,"don't install this
My game was working fine with UPDATE 4
now with this it often crashes and I can't use shops sometimes"
,miketheratguy,2012-02-04T01:47Z,"My controls are messed up now. Can only exit out of a menu with the same button that opened it, and the buttons for reading / putting away a book are a backwards mess. Combat still works fine. Huh???"
,ricocche,2012-02-04T15:24Z,"I assure you it works, but there are some random crashes and freezes, which annoys me. Good side is that you don't have to use tesval/skyboost anymore."
,miketheratguy,2012-02-04T18:00Z,Cant understand the changed controls...they don't do what they say on the screen now.
,Aero1226,2012-02-04T20:50Z,"Hey guys..im a bit confused.

I just downloaded skyrim from razor and it works well, but i want the updates...

If i choose to download this, do i mount it just like the other download? or just extract/unzip?

And where do i place the contents? not sure wth  means....

And what do i delete? the TESV? And whats SKSE? Please help me out..."
,Aero1226,2012-02-04T20:53Z,Meant to say not sure wth step 1. means of the directions above...
,JDFan,2012-02-04T22:24Z,@aero1226 -- After downloading this just copy\paste the downloaded files (they are not in a compressed archive in this download so no extracting needed) -- to the folder that has  your installation in it (to find it if you have the desktop icon to launch the game just right click on it and select open file location and that is the folder to paste these files into and answer yes to the prompt to overwrite files (since these files need to replace the ones that are there already) -- If you want to be able to revert if something goes wrong then make a copy of the files in the install directory or rename them before pasting these files in (never hurts to be safe so that you can replace the originals if something goes wrong but it is not really needed as these files do work properly !) 
,Aero1226,2012-02-05T02:47Z,Ok but some people were saying to delete files like tesv and SKSE and skybox or w/e...whats that mean? do i have to do that or do i just overwrite and play?
,JDFan,2012-02-05T03:19Z,"SKSE and SkyBoost are mods for the game that use dll injectors that require specific versions of the files so each time the game files are updated the mods become unloadable until the mod makers update the mod files as well -- so if you are using them and upgrade you need to remove them until the updated versions are released at which time you download the new mod files and install them ( This update however adds most of the features that Skyboost had been adding so it is now pretty much obsolete anyway -- And I believe SKSE (Skrim Script Extender) has already been updated so just needs to be reinstalled after using this patch.

If you were not using them (which is probably the case if you do not know what they are ) -- Then yes just overwrite and play ! "
,Aero1226,2012-02-05T07:45Z,"Ok cool thanks!
One last question if you dont mind...Might be a little dumb but im just curious...I do have the ""full"" game if i apply this update with the other download correct? Everything seems to be running fine but the install was only a little over 5gb and thats a little small...atleast compared to other games i have."
,Zq8,2012-02-05T08:25Z,Will this work with the Razor release or only Reloaded?
,Zq8,2012-02-05T08:43Z,Will this work with the Razor release or only Reloaded?
,KIDWizdom,2012-02-05T10:26Z,why does the launcher say its version 1.3 update 5 is 1.4
,brianxxx,2012-02-05T18:10Z,"Speaking only from the LEGAL perspective as a legit purchaser of this game -  Patch 5 works just fine on the PC. No issues or odd crashes.

I updated from patch 4 and my game was running just fine with that patch on an AMD Win7 x64 system with an Nvidia card. Did not really need this patch #5 but I let $team do its thing."
,proteus70,2012-02-05T19:34Z,Worked GREAT for me !! I am using RAZOR release.
,JDFan,2012-02-05T21:07Z,@aero -- yes this game is only slightly over 5GB. -- most of the files are kept in compressed archives (BSA files) even after install so the total size of the game is fairly small when compared to other games.
,Givinity,2012-02-05T22:30Z,"note: this is version 1.4 Beta, not 1.4 release :p
this is 1.4 beta release http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/news/article.php?id=55

,jorycle,2012-02-06T17:12Z,"Just so you guys know, for whatever reason Zenimax is watching this torrent and reporting it to ISPs. Got the email today myself and laughed and laughed.

As I told both the ISP and Zenimax, downloading an update isn't exactly copyright infringement."
,Rawkzard,2012-02-07T03:50Z,"I wanted to test performace improvement, so I did this little test.
I saved the game where I look at Whiterun just after you enter through the city gates. I applied the patch files from 1.4 and did a screenshot with fraps:

Then I applied the patch files from this torrent and did a screenshot again.

,Rawkzard,2012-02-07T03:54Z,"And with 1.4 I mean ""Update 4"". I think this Update 5 is actually 1.4, correct?"
,therhymesmatter,2012-02-07T09:02Z,Ok mates somebody clarify here cause ppl say that this is either the BETA 1.4 or the FINAL 1.4...Which one is it???
,JDFan,2012-02-07T16:44Z,@therhymesmatter  -- THey are the same thing -- those that were participating in the BETA and already had the final Beta version did not receive any update when the final was released because they were the same files already !! 
,therhymesmatter,2012-02-07T23:02Z,"@JDFan
Why thank you mate! i am glad somebody cleared things out!now i can proceed with the dl!will seed till next update."
,Jakeler,2012-02-07T23:38Z,"Do I need to install all the other patchs aswell? If I just reinstalled the base game? Or does this have all 1,2,3,4 and 5 updates in one?"

,Lardzor,2012-02-10T21:59Z,"@tkok55:
If Esbern won't open the door, try backtracking till you go up the short starcase and there's a door where the game has to stop to load the new (old) area. Go through the door and let the game load the area, then turn right around and go back through the door again and see if Esbern is open the door for you. (Esbern actually has a lot to say, if he doesn't speak to you at all, there's a patch that re-installs his missing dialog. You'll have to look it up, I'm feeling too lazy right now)
