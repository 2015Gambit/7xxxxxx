     In a restaurant run by two Italian immigrants, the tables sit empty despite
     the extraordinary talents of Primo the chef (Tony Shalhoub,Monk) and the
     ambitious efforts of his brother Secondo (Stanley Tucci, The Devil Wears
     Prada). A celebrity night at their restaurant promises not only to turn
     their business around but to change their lives. 

     It's a five-course gourmet experience filled with rich, delicious
     characters including the marriage-minded girlfriend (OscarNominee*
     Minnie Driver), the seductive mistress (Isabella Rossellini) and the
     successful rival (Oscar Nominee** Ian Holm). From the first bite to the
     last, this critically-acclaimed movie dishes up an irresistible evening
     of scrumptious entertainment.
