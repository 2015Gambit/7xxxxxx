,carcas72,2012-02-04T11:49Z,Thanx man! :)
,HAAJHA,2012-02-04T12:35Z,@carcas72 No problem! ;)
,dongaillardo,2012-02-07T14:53Z,"Nice show. Just when we thought that Silvio is out, they pulled him back in!! But the problem is the norwegian subtittle. When they speak norwegian i can't understand a damn word! Someone gotta fix that . Or write a subtittle.txt and translate it. There gotta be some solution. Thanks uploader, now we're waiting the next episodes . Salute !"
,HAAJHA,2012-02-07T23:52Z,"@rseiler Yes, NRK obvisily subtitles the English parts. Now, I don't really understand what you're saying. Why would we need english subtitles/captions on a Norwegian television channel?"
,HAAJHA,2012-02-08T00:01Z,"@dongaillardo Glad you're enjoying the show! Yes, I have gotten a couple of comments about the Norwegian subtitles. However, the title of the torrent clearly says ""...Nor.Sub"" as in ""Norwegian Subtitles"". Yes, I could add a translation of the Norwegian parts, as I am Norwegian, but I honestly just don't have the time to do that. BBC bought the rights to showing ""Lilyhammer"" in the UK recently. If anyone are able to rip the episodes off of there it will have the Norwegian parts subtitled. Though I'm not sure when BBC will be airing this series. Sorry about that. Hey, no problem! S01E03 will be up and running tomorrow night/Thursday morning Norwegian time! "
