Thank you for giving me such a good laugh although I do not think you meant to do so.

Please check your last post to spot the typing error.

Please keep on looking for them though and tell me if you find them.

Regards.

You're awesome!

Can you please upload any:

Timothy Ferris
Robert Greene
Noam Chomsky
Deepak Chopra
Alan Watts
Friedrich Nietzsche
Eckhart Tolle

Strange combination I know, but those are my favorite authors and I figured I'd ask you all at once to save you time.

Thanks in advance."
