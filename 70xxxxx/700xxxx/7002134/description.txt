Burn The .ISO File With Active@ ISO Burner 2.1.0.0

I Reccomend Either \"Magic-ISO\" Or \"Power-ISO\" Instead Of Active@ ISO :)
ONLY BURN THE .ISO FILE!!! DON\'T BURN ANYTHING ELSE WITH THE .ISO FILE, KEEP IT BY IT\'S SELF!!!! :)

You Can Use What Ever Program You Want To Burn The .ISO File.
Place The Burned DVD Into Your Computer & Restart The Computer.
Make Sure Your Bios Boot Settings Are Set To Boot From DVD ROM Drive.
Also Make Sure To Set Your DVD-ROM Drive B 4 Your Hard Drive In The Bios Boot Settings.
Boot From DVD, After You Have Booted From The DVD.
I Reccomend Always Doing A Clean Install By Formatting The Existing Installed Operating System.
After The Windows Installation Is Finished.
Start The \"Windows 7 Activation (Reccomended)\"
