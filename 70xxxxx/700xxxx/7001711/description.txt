Revered Parisian electronic duo AIR (Nicolas Godin and JB Dunckel) were asked to compose an original score for the restored version of the classic 1902 silent film `Le Voyage Dans La Lune' (A Trip To The Moon) by Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s. This new artist album is the fully realized outcome of that collaboration. Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s is one of the central characters in Martin Scorsese's new blockbuster hit `Hugo' and his life and work (including the iconic `A Trip To The Moon') is attracting a whole new wave of interest as a result.
