In late august 2011 three producers from Sweden thought it will be a good idea to make some epicness together since they have followed
eachother for like three years, and had similar thoughts about this fucked up world we are living in. 
With the allmighty internet as our own highway, the arrogant leaders of the world and the fight that Anonymous fights this record is now rdy. 


The Bilderberg Agenda is not stylish, customizable, simple, and readable â€” you can not make it yours.

These tracks and the whole ideology belongs to The Bilderberg Agenda and all the Anons out there.
