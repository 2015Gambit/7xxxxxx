,Angels1971,2012-02-02T21:06Z,I actually looked them up on Tricerasoft first before sending them to you. I wanted to make sure they even made these ones in Karaoke. All the ones I sent you were available on there. Thanks so very much again :)
,Angels1971,2012-02-02T21:39Z,I will look into that kslc - I am trying to educate myself on all this karaoke stuff. I'm pretty computer literate once I'm shown something. I'll definetly look at it. Thanks so much for everything. I'm sure you will hear from me again soon :)
