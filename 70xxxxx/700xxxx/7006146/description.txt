Birthdays for the Dead - Stuart MacBride

Product Description

The gritty new standalone crime novel from the No. 1 bestselling author of Shatter the Bones and Dark Blood

Detective Constable Ash Henderson has a dark secretâ€¦

Five years ago his daughter, Rebecca, went missing on the eve of her thirteenth birthday. A year later the first card arrived: homemade, with a Polaroid picture stuck to the front â€“ Rebecca, strapped to a chair, gagged and terrified. Every year another card: each one worse than the last.

The tabloids call him The Birthday Boy. Heâ€™s been snatching girls for twelve years, always in the run-up to their thirteenth birthday, sending the families his homemade cards showing their daughters being slowly tortured to death.

But Ash hasnâ€™t told anyone about Rebeccaâ€™s birthday cards â€“ they all think sheâ€™s just run away from home â€“ because if anyone finds out, heâ€™ll be taken off the investigation. And heâ€™s sacrificed too much to give up before his daughterâ€™s killer gets what he deservesâ€¦


Enjoy!
