It is indeed nourishing to the soul to see the great spirit in the folks of Sweden
in what we are blessed with in seeing the "Wallander team" in the first
episode particularly (such as in the scene when "Linda Wallander" reminds her
mate of the concept of "empathy" as it is to her (he is a nicest man indeed)
- feeling as she does in need of a more romantic moment than was perceptible to
her keen senses at that moment. What great joy to see the Irish spirit thriving - 
the stocks of Canada that came from this area haven't fared anywhere as well in 
keeping their spirits up to this caliber -  I hate to have to say - yet there is 
some relative beauty here too - as it is unmistakably Swedish in a good many cases
you see as you walk down the streets here.


enjoy the series, however some violence depicted so caveat applies!
