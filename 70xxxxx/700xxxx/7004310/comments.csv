,bert16,2012-02-03T23:25Z,How accurate is this compared to other driver updating software? I tried a few and often I get drivers that are either older or not suited for my system. So far the most accurate has been that freeware Driverpack that someone just uploaded.
,_Dragan_,2012-02-03T23:41Z,"Well I tryed this program on my Windows 7, And it worked. I not have had any problems with the drivers. You can read more on this site. http://www.smartpctools.com/driver_updater/ 
And its a very good program.

* Access to over 200,000 drivers
* The latest Windows 7, Vista and XP Drivers. Just ask if you need more help :) "
