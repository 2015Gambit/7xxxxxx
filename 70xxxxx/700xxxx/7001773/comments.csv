(It is of DVD quality and is not HD - this is the way it is screened here...)  I would be happy to upload it here - but I don't have much uploading capability and I haven't uploaded anything here before... so I don't know how to start? It has English hardcoded subs, with Chinese Mandarin dialogue. Overall I rate the series as being pretty good... some parts are slow -- drag but that is to be expected...
I can't see 50 x 45 mins being edited down to 3 hours being any good - sure, there are whole parts of this presentation that can be edited out, but still - many worthwhile bits have to be omitted"
,kiwilove007,2012-04-14T01:22Z,"Having viewed the 50 part series - I have to say that the writing is somewhat uneven, and it is most probably made up of fictional additions.  And the whole story is not accurately told.  And that the best way of showing off this series, is to have a compiliation of all the major fight scenes, that will fit onto one DVD - leaving the minor fight scenes out.  I have made one up - but my uploading bandwidth is so very small - I have to offer it to anyone wanting to?  And Bruce Lee fans would appreciate this immensely for sure!
While not an accurate bio - it still has enough in it to make it worthwhile viewing.  Though it has slow and irrelevant? parts and unsatisfactory bit present.  Note - I have not viewed this particular download.."
