,GopherTee,2012-02-06T05:10Z,I am very experienced with the Wii games and what not but for some reason this game hangs at the start menus.  Is there certain settings that need to be used with this game.  I am using USB Loader. 
,Jacobus21,2012-02-09T19:33Z,"Use Configurable USB-Loader (CFG) v7.0.

Use IOS 247.

Use NTFS."
,Jacobus21,2012-03-11T18:06Z,"By the way it's WBFS format. So create a folder named ""wbfs"" in your drive and copy the game into it."
