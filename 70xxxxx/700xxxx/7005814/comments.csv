,BigBarney,2012-02-07T09:48Z,"Just FYI, this torrent is for 4.0.6 - 4.3 private servers... If you updated your wow client to 4.3.2 then you won't be able to play on private servers and will have to re-download this wow client...

After downloading you must NEVER run Launcher if there is one...

But instead the appropriate WoW.exe for your private server you are joining...

Currently this is only client for private servers, previous we could use retail client, but now there's an update for retail that breaks private servers that are below 4.3.2 patch (most servers are 4.0.6 - 4.1.)

So keep seeding/downloading this torrent until it get some life, cuz there will be a lot of usage of this torrent in future...

IMO this will be super low speed for a week or so... cuz 400 seeds on 2k leeches are a little to less.... i'm getting 40kbs down and 40up..., my speed max is 1mb/s so this is really low and sad :( but i want to play so badly athough molten is quite bugged at the moment..."
,Holts_31,2012-02-07T16:17Z,SEEEEED PLEASE 
,bryan2978,2012-02-07T16:18Z,this is going very slow. but i am uploading. i hit 3.0mbs d/l- 900kbs up at peak.. but very low now. i will seed as much as possible. any confirmation this works? 
,BigBarney,2012-02-07T17:28Z,"What do you mean by ""this works?"" ?

Of course it does and it should, cuz  seeders get more and more not ditching this torrent...

If you can't connet to molten-wow through wow.exe that is in torrent then look for guide that is on their website... although this torrent is oficially linked there so it should be already patched to work on molten wow..."
,marenp88,2012-02-09T12:26Z,"7GB downloaded, 1.3GB uploaded, seed more guys it there is no problem, pls :/"

If you have already downloaded that .torrent just go to the download folder and double click Wow.exe (no need for realmist change since it's done). Login in the game using Molten Wow account.
It does NOT need any CD-key/cracking/unraring/whatever. "

Wish there were fast seeders.

@morphine25
Your upload is already capped so it wouldn't make much of a difference on your download.
Yes, if you do not donate, you will be put on queue. That's what happens when people host major dedicated World of Warcraft servers which are popular so you can play. If you are gonna start bitching because you are poor, please kindly fuck off.
"
,darknyan,2012-06-13T02:47Z,"@Connormax

It usually takes a little bit to update the trackers. If you wait about 15 minutes, the data from the tracker will be updated. If not, you may be using a older version of Vuze which doesn't support UDP trackers."

WTH is wrong with you. His #advertisement# was totally on topic and relevant to advice newbees to play private servers. zzzetermal are actually one of the most known private servers with realible staff and uptime. So GTFO yourself gamernoob. I played since Atari/C64 was new so give up arguing. :P"
,McLyster,2012-07-25T19:45Z,"@azidtrip
just go learn a thing or two what makes a private server good and what World of Warcraft is about you fucktard. You must STILL be playing Atari, go educate yourself about what you talk about

if all else fails, have fun wasting your life on bugged and underpopulated(for a reason!) prvate servers"

There's about 12/13 gigs of fat that could've been trimmed from Data/Cache.

For those of you who are new to private servers, this is preset for molten-wow login, you have to change the realmlist.wtf file in WoW/Data/enUS if you'd like to use it for other servers (details on what to change it to will be on the server's website) and if you want to join a server, only accounts made on that server's website will work for logging in.

Has anyone tried running this on a trinity/skyfire repack emulator? hoping to use this for my own private LAN server. "
