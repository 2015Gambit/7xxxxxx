This is James L. Hirsen's amazing book The Coming Collision - Global Law vs. U.S. Liberties (1999) which exposes the United Nations as a threat to democracy. The global activists have some sinister beliefs. They wholeheartedly embrace environmental extremism, New Age mysticism, radical feminism, and international governance. Further, they fully intend to spread their philosophies worldwide. But most frightening of all is their plan to implement a global agenda by using the powerful weight of international law. Are we trading away the national constitution for international law? The author shows how all the pieces of the global puzzle fit together and explains how international law profoundly affects the rights and freedoms of every one. He documents that the UN is increasingly seeking expanded, supranational powers for itself, powers that are intended to displace both traditional national sovereignty and individual liberties. And all without the knowledge or consent of the people of the world. 200 pages. A must read for everyone.
