,thenoobest1,2012-02-08T01:47Z,what's wrong with the releases lately? no ac3 5.1 audio and it's in mp4 format...?
,chalky_no1,2012-02-09T02:42Z,"Hi froggie100, Is this as good as the VISION brrips you upload? As i see a VISION rip on here but it is a R3 and has bad feedback. "
,spifkitten99,2012-03-19T00:55Z,"The volume of the voices is very low, compared to the volume of sound effects.

VERY annoying.

To be able to hear what they are saying, you gotta turn it up, so that whenever some action happens in the movie, you are blasted like crazy.

If this is a BRRip as claimed, then the options are there, to change this. fucking do it properly, or make sure to make two audio tracks, so it can be adjusted later."
