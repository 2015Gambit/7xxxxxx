From Wiki:


The Social Network is a 2010 American drama film directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires, the film portrays the founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits. It stars Jesse Eisenberg as founder Mark Zuckerberg, along with Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake as the other principals involved in the website's creation. Neither Zuckerberg nor any other Facebook staff were involved with the project, although Eduardo Saverin was a consultant for Mezrich's book.[3] The film was released in the United States by Columbia Pictures on October 1, 2010.

The film received widespread acclaim, with critics praising it for its editing, acting, score and screenplay. Some people, including Zuckerberg himself, criticized the film for its many inaccuracies. The Social Network appeared on 78 critics' top 10 list for 2010; of those critics 22 had the film in their number one spot. Rolling Stone's Peter Travers said "The Social Network is the movie of the year. But Fincher and Sorkin triumph by taking it further. Lacing their scathing wit with an aching sadness, they define the dark irony of the past decade." It received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (Fincher), and Best Actor (Eisenberg) and won three for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing. It also won the Best Motion Picture â€“ Drama Golden Globe at the 68th Golden Globe Awards. The film also won Golden Globe awards for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Original Score, making it the film with the most wins of the night.
