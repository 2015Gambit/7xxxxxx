[/b][/color] ???Let???s Stay Together??? is the story of Stacy Lawrence, a pediatrician who is engaged to Charles Whitmore, the contractor she hired to remodel her kitchen.
Stacy and Charles have a fun, sexy, intense dynamic.
However, six months in, some of the magic of finally finding a soul mate has worn off, and they find themselves constantly renegotiating their rules of cohabitation.

In contrast, Stacy???s super-fabulous younger sister Tasha and her husband Jamal act like an old married couple even though they???re only in their 20s.
Tasha made a lot of mistakes in love before she found a stable, ambitious guy like Jamal so she has dedicated herself to pleasing her man and raising their six-month-old twins.
Jamal considers himself lucky to have a fine, dedicated wife like Tasha even though she does bring the drama on a regular basis.

Charles??? earthy younger sister Kita, a proud employee of the DMV, is celebrating her independence by taking a break from dating while she explores all that life has to offer before she settles down.
