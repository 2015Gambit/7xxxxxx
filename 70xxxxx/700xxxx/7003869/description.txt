Memphis-born and Atlanta-based, staHHr is an integral part of the Atlanta Hip Hop community. Authentic. Consistent. Powerful. Universal. Hip Hop. Skilled in the art of lyrical alchemy, staHHr, has been perfecting her craft and honing her lyrical warrior skills since the latter part of hip hopâ€™sâ€ Golden Eraâ€. Carving a niche for herself by interweaving intellect and social awareness with the essence of pure, unadulterated hip hop, she consistently provides a welcome breath of fresh air. No stranger to the elements and culture of hip hop, staHHr has earned stripes and sharpened her sword in street ciphers, mc battles (Blaze, The Source, Red Bull, etc.) and performing on local, national and global stages.

Although sheâ€™s been releasing music and performing with other artists for close to two decades, it wasnâ€™t until 2008 that she unleashed her debut solo album â€œAlmost Neva Wasâ€ via the Beatvizion Music digital imprint. Renown for her phenomenal spontaneous freestyle ability, high energy and lyrics that embody the essence of the â€œGolden Era Futureâ€, this sister has more than earned those â€œtwo Hâ€™s for hip hopâ€ in her attribute.
