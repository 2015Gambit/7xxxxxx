That's why I wanted to share a good transfer of it in Flac 96kHz. I hope you enjoy :) CD quality has nothing to do with vinyls."

,F.C.M.,2012-02-21T13:00Z,Hi enotes9 :) I encourage you to go for it. If you're searching for music enjoyment it's worth the money by far. A decent high fidelity equipment based on vinyl is not that expensive and will blow away most of the CDs you can buy nowadays.
