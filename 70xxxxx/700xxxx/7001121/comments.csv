,Kyouko,2012-02-04T14:15Z,"Oh yes! Finally a House episode with 720 quality. Sure the filesize is big, but what can you do? Working english subtitles can be found here: http://www.tvsubtitles.net/subtitle-202801.html

Thank you very much! I hope you continue to deliver rest of the season with the same quality."
