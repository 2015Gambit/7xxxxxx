,VeKTeReX,2012-02-03T05:41Z,"Definitely thanks for the episode, but this IS episode 6, not 3. The ""Hear of Archness"" were the first three episodes of the season. Not sure about the ""2009"" thing either.

But still thanks..."
,960018,2012-02-03T06:31Z,"The ""Heart of Archness"" was a short arc between seasons to conclude season two's arc.
And the ""2009"" bit might be to avoid confusion with a previous series called ""Archer"". There was one in 1975, if I'm not mistaken.
Also, thanks for everything, ettv."
,dBLOOD42,2012-02-03T11:22Z,"Instead of talking shit dipshits, you should check out the Official Archer episode Guide on the official webpage.
http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/archer/episode.php
Heart Of Archness are three standalone eps connecting season 2 and 3. Try not to be write-only faggots for achange."
,anon73a,2012-02-04T05:55Z,"So how should the files be named, dickwad? archer.2009.SshortarcbetweenseasonsE01?? It makes sense that the ""Special Edition"", as FX called it WAS season 3. Cable seasons can be any number of episodes these days. And where do you get that it somehow ""concluded season two's arc""?? Do you even watch Archer??"
,Senjurou,2012-02-04T16:22Z,LOL! this is AWESOME! and me being Dominican I know what Mamajuana does!

I don't know what the fuck you title those three episodes, but they are not s03.  Accept it & move on because it just doesn't really matter at the end of the day."
,tywebb661e,2012-02-09T23:39Z,"Just pretend the trilogy ""arc"" is attached to the end of season 2. Maybe label it S2.5E01..., etc if you want. Other alternatives will mess up and confuse people going forward."
,soupygbs,2012-02-17T22:44Z,"i think Anon73a might be retarded. The ""Heart of Archness"" is a ""mini-arc concluding season two's cliffhanger"" and not part of season 2 or 3"
