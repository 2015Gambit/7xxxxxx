 A team of professional con artists travel the country to catch out            
 unsuspecting members of the public with their fraudulent tricks in order to   
 teach them how to become more vigilant.                                       
                                                                               
                                                                               
 Shane Lynch goes undercover as a tramp as he tries to help the team pull off a 
 devious heist. Pretending to be a fraud investigator, he manages to convince a 
 mark that he has already been conned by Alex and Jess.
