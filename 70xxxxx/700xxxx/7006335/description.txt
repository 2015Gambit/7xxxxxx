///--------WHAT TO DO?

-- INSTALL --
Extract the ZIP. Done.
\\\"MineCraft_Prt.bat\\\" is the thing to open!

-- HANDY TIP --
Install Drobox, place the wole folder in your dropbox.

-- MODDING --
the actual game file is here:
..\\\\McPortable\\\\.minecraft\\\\bin\\\\minecraft.jar
I have premade some modded jars for you. In \\\"bin\\\\ModdedJARs\\\"

HELP
I have placed some help files on the places you need it. They contain only essential information
if you now some inproofments, please mail me as much you want!

emillo108@hotmail.com






///--------HOW IT WORKS
When you open \\\"MineCraft.bat\\\", it will tell Minecradt to use \\\"/McPortable/\\\" instead of %appdata%/. In this way, 

your save files wil always stay in the same folder as your game. Pretty handy to take everything on an USB-stick 

and play on other computers.
