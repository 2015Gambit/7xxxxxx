Just skimmed through... it's a really good rip! Definitely sourced from DVD. Good audio level and perfect sync from what I could tell. Considering the file size (700mb), I'd definitely give it A:10 V:10.
The only thing preventing it from being identical to a straight up DVD rip is a small watermark ('property of...') which appears at the top of the screen from time to time.

Thank you Hackulus and TARGET. "
