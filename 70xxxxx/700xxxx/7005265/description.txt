Notes:  I will NOT and REFUSE to upload their newest album.  It is pure SHIT. Not even worth mentioning it.  If you want it buy it just so you can give them a chance to put out an album to make up for this last one.  Just pure shit...

Enjoy this release.  Quality is crazy. :)  Seed, Comment, and just say thanks.
