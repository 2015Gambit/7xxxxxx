In mid-2003, nearly 6 years since the last Brazen Abbot release, Guilty as Sin was released. The 'Bad Religion' line-up was nearly confirmed, except for Thomas Vikstrom, who was replaced by singer Jorn Lande (ex-ARK, Masterplan). The very first Brazen Abbot concerts with a full band line-up were performed in Bulgaria the same year. This touring line-up consisted of Nikolo Kotzev - guitars, Joe Lynn Turner - vocals, Wayne Banks - bass, Lars Pollack - keyboards, Thomas Broman - drums. Such shows in Varna, Sofia and Plovdiv were both filmed and recorded by a professional crew to be included on the DVD which also features in-depth interviews with all the singers that were part of Brazen Abbot during the years (Jorn Lande, Glenn Hughes, Goran Edman, Thomas Vikstrom apart from Joe Lynn Turner), apparitions on the bulgarian TV and loads of cool behind the scenes footage from the studios and on the road. NTSC/Region 0. Frontiers. 2004.
