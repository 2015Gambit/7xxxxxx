,end77,2012-04-04T22:40Z,"This is nonsense, though I am glad it's here for free so people don't waste their money.

The marketing of it is targeting fat slothy people who want to lose weight in 60 days ... it's laughable. I don't want to lose weight, I want to gain weight (lean body weight of course, not fat) but imagine, who'd buy the DVD if they say 'gain weight in 60 days' ... bullshit, I petty the people who really put their minds into this nonsense. There's only one way to get real and solid results, no such thing as short cuts and '60 days'."
,end77,2012-04-04T22:45Z,"No shame at all, shameless people are behind this scam who only want your money, so shameless that they go as far as putting all their effort and energy in producing a scam ... they don't care where you get at after 60 days."
[T],ctang,2012-04-05T01:40Z,"that may be true but you do lose weight doing this program...as long as you do it and stick to it...no different than going to the gym...if you go to the gym twice a week and thats it, your results are going to be minimal...same thing that applies to this...do it everyday and stick to it"
,end77,2012-04-06T05:37Z,"I go to the gym 5 days a week, I build lean muscle mass, which in turn burns calories, which means I eat a lot and burn a lot. You need some fat on you to build muscle, and no, it's not like the gym, working at home as in this video is nothing like the gym, when you're building mass you'll always need heavier weights, and lifting your own body weight is never enough. You want to burn fat? Easy, go for a long walk on an empty stomach upon waking up everyday, there's nothing easier than burning fat. This proves that this video is for lame and lazy people who never touched weights, and have no care or concern in the first place about what they eat and for what they eat, those are people with no purpose, they eat what they want for no purpose.

When you learn to go to the gym you'll have guidelines on your food intake, such as, whether you want to load carbs for your tomorrow morning workout by eating bread and pasta before bed, or whether you prefer quick carbs for your work and getting those immediately before your workout, and much more such guidelines. 

Educate yourself a little, I spent years reading over the internet day and night on nutrition, this video tells you nothing of this other than throw your body around, dance and move you body like a fag ... so ridiculous and lame. Epic fail."
,JamesPY,2012-04-10T00:37Z,"this workout video is destinated for whom want a tonification and definition or make some kind of fickle cardio moves, especially for women, and it really works but slowly. @ctang any movie?"

""Educate yourself a little, I spent years reading over the internet day and night on nutrition, this video tells you nothing of this other than throw your body around, dance and move you body like a fag ... so ridiculous and lame. Epic fail. "" 

The videos focus primarily on body weight and plyometrics mixed with heavy cardio. This isn't meant to gain ""lean muscle"", it's meant to improve your cardio, make you more flexible, and in general put in you in much better shape. You don't need some fat on your body to build muscle(lol, idiot), you just need the carbs for energy and the protein for the muscle to build from. And beside, it's impossible to completely remove all your total body fat percentage just from doing these videos. I bet you havn't even looked at the nutrition guide that comes with it.

Also, high-interval cardio (like wind sprints or this) is the best way to lower total body fat percentage. Lifting weights doesn't burn nearly as many calories as (regular OR high intensity) running. 

And doing ANY excercise with an empty stomach is stupid. Sure, your body burns stored calories (fat), but it also goes into emergency mode and then as soon as you eat anything, it's immediately stored and the fat comes back. You're also much more tempted to over-eat afterwards. 

If you spent years reading about nutrition, you'd realize any of this. You're just another meat-head retard ""body builder"" on the internet who's talking out of his ass because he sees people are doing something a way that isn't HIS way.

@Everyone Else

This works if you stick to it AND the nutrition guide. You won't be huge, but you will be much better. I'm solid now and feeling great. Don't let retards like end77 tell you otherwise. "
,ConstantEcho,2012-04-30T22:34Z,"Also, people seem to have the wrong definition of ""losing weight"". It's not about losing weight, it's about losing total body fat percentage if you want your body to look good. If you're not able to lift your own body-weight, you WILL gain muscle from this, which means (unless your fat percentage is very high) you'll gain weight as well. Muscle is heavier than fat. So you should never count the pounds as they're irrelevant. If you want to see results, calculate body-fat percentage. (http://www.bmi-calculator.net/body-fat-calculator/body-fat-formula.php)

And if you've never been to the gym before, then starting with body-weight exercises like this is the best way so that your body will be able to handle it and you don't injure yourself. 

This way you won't end up with severe joint problems or a thrown-out back like end77 will when he grows up. (or learns to)"
,joshv712,2012-05-03T04:11Z,eat a dick end77. why are you even here? did you just get on here to bash people? go juice up and blow your boyfriend in the mens bathroom at your gym you love so much. :)
,vapor100ll,2012-05-10T03:00Z,"end77 obviously doesn't understand how the human body builds fat. Eating carbs before bed not only causes your body to produce fat, but also raises triglycerides and blood sugar and cholesterol levels... not healthy. Regularly eating within 4 hours of going to sleep at night has also been associated with diabetes in middle age people, for the aforementioned reasons. Working out first thing in the morning is healthy, but should be immediately followed by a ""healthy"" meal. Going to the gym is great for building muscle, but not necessarily a good way to burn fat unless you're hitting a treadmill, bike, or stairclimber as lifting weights does close to nothing in terms of burning the fat most people are trying to get rid of (ass, waist, thighs). In that case you might as well go for a walk/jog/run/bike ride. More cardio workouts are what most people need."
,bitemenow10,2012-05-10T22:20Z,why is this torrent so big the first insanity is only like 9 gigs?
,Zstar,2012-05-30T20:10Z,"@end77, well some people cant afford to go to the gym, and this will drop the pounds if you stick to it and diet. going to the gym can be pretty expensive, what with gas prices and everything else, and why should any one listen to someone that calls people fags, and coins the term ""epic fail"". for the record an ""epic"" is a long poem."
,end77,2012-06-05T16:39Z,"@Josh
I am straight, but thanks. I am around to download movies and came across this so I though to share my critics.

This vid is MEANT and DESIGNED to fool you, and you don't need be a genius to figure it out, first of all look at those presenters, you think they approve of what they were paid to preach in this video? You think they got their bodies out of the gay exercises in this video? Big NO.

@vapro Your body doesn't burn fat if it doesn't have muscle, and doesn't build muscle if it doesn't have fat, so you can do cardio all day long with the little muscle you have but the calories you'd have burned by the end of the day wouldn't measure up to the amount you'd eat by that of the minimum recommended daily intake, so you'll end up malnourished and weak. Your body is a double edged sword, but this video is a double hole dick scam!"
,tht81,2012-06-20T04:05Z,"@end77 i don't know if a dumbell fall on your head or you were lying about reading stuff on the internet but i got news for you muscle DOES NOT burn fat muscle cells like fat cells consume energy (which is what calories are), only muscle need more energy than fat thus burning more calories.  also you are wrong about needing fat to grow lean muscle (well, sort of) you see not all your amino acids ( the good stuff in protien) come from protein (and yes you need both animal and veggie protiens) some of them found in lipids (fat) which is why you never see a jacked up vegan  they can't build muscle without eating meat but i digress back to what i was saying  it is true that the stockier you are before working out the bigger muscles are going to be 

and just so you know what you are saying about using weights is true of the western philosophy of exercise and strength building which focuses on muscle size bigger is better but not so true of the eastern philosophy in which the emphasis speed and agility to build strength and power through fast, long muscles  as opposed to the slower fatter muscles of western exercise techniques.  remember not everyone wants to be mr. universe  most ppl who dl this just want to get in better shape so they can be a little better on the company softball team or finally start losing that weight they've been meaning to get rid of  or  like me they think that when it comes to muscles bigger isn't always better  after 60 days of this i am faster more agile stronger and more powerful just without the size  and a longer sleeker leaner body.

so to everyone else if you're expecting to be totally ripped from doing this  much like any other workout routine it will take time disipline and a lot longer than 60 days  and dont expect to have muscles on top of muscles on top of muscles  if you want that do what end77 says and hit the gym  most of you who do this will get into the best shape of you life or if not at least better than you have been which is always a plus 

sorry this is so long and not puncuated 

and now excuse me but, much to the dismay of end77, its time for me to start another 60 days of INSANITY"
