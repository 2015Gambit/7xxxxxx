,alistair74,2012-01-31T20:44Z,"I agree with pingman1969 must have taken 4ever, besides people cant expect Blu-ray quality for shit thats only been in theaters 4A week.Thanks M8 4 all your effort, Cheers .BONE."
,Carl167,2012-01-31T20:49Z,"Thanks brother, much appreciated "
,michaelrwatson,2012-01-31T22:46Z,"No one expects Bluray quality, but is it watchable? 

There's no point in ruining a potentially great movie trying to understand bad audio, or if parts are missing, etc. The 36 secs at the start doesn't sound like a killer, if that's all that's missing. Thx."
,UpHere,2012-02-01T07:11Z,Thanx for the upload. v6/a6 good work.
,michaelrwatson,2012-02-02T23:20Z,"""good work""?? What are you, some kinda moron?

Both this *and* the UnKnOwN release use the same video source (or else it's very similar)--it has horrible, pulsating flicker in most of the bright scenes (of which there are many since this is set in Alaska). TOTALLY UNWATCHABLE unless you are really desperate. 

Hey INSPiRAL, UnKnOwN, and .BONE: You need to have sharp objects shoved up your rectums for releasing this crap. Thanks.

,michaelrwatson,2012-02-04T07:57Z,@rajunhl: You need to have sharp objects shoved up all your orifices too you gay fucktard. Just like the idiots who released this unwatchable crap ts.

How fucking rude! Clearly states 'TS', what did you expect?! Yeah you might not like CAMS or TS' but there are plenty of people out there, myself included, who really aren't that bothered. Since we watch them in a small window on our laptops whilst doing other stuff on the web. It's about the freedom to choose, do I DL the shitter copy now? Or wait a couple of months for a perfect copy? Why would you want to take that choice away? 

Funny that all these whiny little girls are always the ones who have contributed nothing! Where are all your torrents? Yeah it's OK to knock others who go out of their way to supply you with free media, but you do fuck all to give back, just complain and insult people. Fuck off if you don't like it and go and pay for your shit!

@.BONE. Thanks for all your efforts man. You are much appreciated round these parts!"

My bad.... I wasn't thinking of people who ""watch movies in windows while doing other stuff on their computer"" like you.  

This copy might be acceptable for that if you make the window really small, like, a thumbnail.  But for anyone who actually wants to watch it fullscreen, the flicker is bad enough to give you a siezure."
