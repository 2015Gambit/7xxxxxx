,GounoKen,2012-07-15T14:49Z,"I only own the first box of Starzinger and a Dvd called vol.5 from the second box. Don't know if that's the one your'e looking for?

Anyway, Starzinger is being subbed again, but this time around they have this quality and really awesome subs, check out:

Skaro Hunting Society"
,d1knight,2012-07-18T04:59Z,"Discs 1 and 2 of box 2 are from vol. 4 and discs 5 and 6 from vol. 6 (the last one)... About that society you mentioned, i'll give it a try.... thank you!"
,GounoKen,2012-07-23T14:04Z,"Ok, then I understand. Can upload it with the same quality as my previous uploads of Starzinger when my computer has been repaired. Don't know really when that's going to be finished, unfortunately...

Do you have any dvd's from this series or do you know anyone who has it? Would be great if all the Raws could become available with this quality. And where can I find the remaining dvd's except from amazon and yahoo auctions, do you know?"
,d1knight,2012-07-26T02:56Z,I only have the files you uploaded.. I know of no one (yet) who has the series. I also tried amazon and yahoo with no luck.. 
,d1knight,2012-07-26T02:58Z,"Playasia.com had them listed and i ordered them.. but a week later, got refunded because they are out of print :( "
,d1knight,2012-07-26T03:01Z,"From TOHO [the publisher] the catalog # for vol. 4 and 6: TDV-18095D and TDV-18097D, just in case anyone can get them"
,GounoKen,2012-07-28T17:48Z,Ok. Thanks for doing the research. Unfortunate that you didn't get any results. Just write here or so if you find anything.
,d1knight,2012-08-01T00:57Z,I will... let's hope you get ur computer fixed soon :)
,GounoKen,2012-08-12T16:32Z,"Hi again.

Found four original Starzinger Dvd's at auctions  on Yahoo Auctions just some days back. I won the one that was listed that I don't own yet, and that is Vol.4 , will upload when I have it and the computer works."
,GounoKen,2012-08-12T16:36Z,Just won Dvd Vol.4 of this series. Will upload it when I get it and when my computer gets fixed.
,GounoKen,2012-08-12T16:39Z,Btw: Do you know Japanese? Would be great if we could find another translator for the group.
,d1knight,2012-08-16T01:34Z,"Congratulations on winning vol 4. The hunting for vol 6 continues hehe... but no, i don't know japanese, sorry. :("
