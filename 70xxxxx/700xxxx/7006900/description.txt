Amazing pre-code shocker full of black magic, sadism & depravity that has to be seen to be believed. 1932!!

Generally unavailable, & never widely released, this was ripped from a WB limited edition DVDR. Picture is good, pressed from a clean negative, though not restored or remastered. Still far better than the youtube clips going around that are presently the only other sources of this awesome film.
