Unfortunately, it doesn't look good when ACTA becomes ratified. News has been quiet about ACTA. It's kinda like a international DMCA takedown. But worse. It's purpose is target & enforcement of ""counterfeit"" goods. That's why pharmaceutical industry is a big part of it. To thwart real competition and innovation and force their overpriced shit on us, eg, cheaper generic drugs is bad for profits. 

Any amendments to ACTA will only be made by ""ACTA commitee"" made up of industry representatives 'without' any Public or judicial review. 

And you know they won't stop pushing SOPA or PIPA, it will come up again in some shape or form.
