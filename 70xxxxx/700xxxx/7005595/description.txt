Uploaded this as the versions up atm are wank and nobody is seeding. I'll seed as long as I can (a few days at least). All tracks except the mixes.

There's some bare fuckin dungeon rumblers on this years album, big up getdarker for not filling it with modem noise and the usual suspects.

And now the disclaimer: If you like any of these tracks PLEASE support and respect them by buying them from itunes/boomkat/juno etc. UK dubstep got where it is because people went to the raves and bought the tunes. Do the same please and help keep it going.

Bass, love and understanding.
