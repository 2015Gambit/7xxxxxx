,pratspall,2012-03-29T17:07Z,"Video is almost unwatchable, despite the relatively large file size and what looks like a 720p resolution. Frames drop everytime there is any movement on-screen, creating a stuttering mess. I love the show and appreciate the fact that someone took the time to upload some episodes, but these are painful to watch. "
,tyecita,2012-03-29T22:37Z,@pratspall Then you can always delete and upload your own! So you won't suffer or anybody else. 
,pratspall,2012-04-04T04:38Z,I did delete it. If I had access to the content I'd be happy to upload my own. I don't think you need to get defensive; you just got something screwed up in the ripping/converting process somewhere. 
,greatful1,2012-06-06T05:44Z,my son loves this show!!!  if the 16 people could seed it in the mornings & afternoons that would be awesome!  and thank you so much for putting this on here
,hz66,2012-06-27T19:15Z,On behalf of my nephew I thank you. Unlike others I will seed 
,hz66,2012-06-27T19:42Z,"Hey quick question, when you get a corrupt download ""the video has low frame rate and studders on occasion"" would I have to re-download or would a hash check fix it? Any insight would be appreciated "
,Hemude,2012-07-18T06:21Z,"I appreciate the effort, tyecita, and will make do with what you've upped - since there appears to be no alternative.

But I do agree with pratspall. Something is not right with the videos. Frame drops all over the place. Really bad stuttering. A second try is needed, if you're up for it.

Thanks again for trying."
,lordbongsnipa69,2012-08-19T00:21Z,"My son absolutely loves this show, thank you for uploading, dad gets to be a hero again :)"
,happygirl77,2012-09-01T01:35Z,Thank you tyecita! My kids love this show. I was having the same problem as Hemude but I ran the videos through ConverterLite (free download) and saved as AVI 720x480 and they came out a treat. Stuttering and Frame dopping - gone. Thank you again and was wondering if any chance of you downloading any more in the series?
