On the outskirts of Manchester in 1875, you play as Otis McGuiganoo, a scientist who is trying to perfect a Revival Syrum, to rid the world of early death, and bring back his brother, Dean. But something goes terribly wrong and he has found himself responsible for the lives of himself and many others in the castle. This is my first decent-ish mod, and I am still fairly new to the script functions in amnesia, so gimme a break, and if you dont like it, then thats not my problem is it. To be honest, no, I didn't test it too much, no, I didn't plan too. If you were REALLY looking forward to this mod, then im sorry to say it might not be as good as you think it is...
