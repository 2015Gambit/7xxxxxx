32 Bit users use the 32 bit one (duh) and 64 bit users install BOTH the 32 AND the 64 bit one.

This will fix the cannot find main class error, and many other errors you may be having"

then I loaded the game, typed my username, pressed login then it started downloading, and once it got a bit past 50% the screen went black and nothings happening now.. Please help, I'm not very experienced with downloading."
,KandyLee,2012-02-15T09:08Z,What program do you use to run this one?
,kaise123,2012-02-18T04:12Z,"@TG_schemes; That that there is something wrong with your PC that stops the game from running. Have you got your drivers up to date?

@KandyLee; Do you mean the launcher? Its MinecraftSL"
,davden0161,2012-02-19T04:13Z,"WTF it keeps saying 

ERROR: Could not find the main class: net.minecraft.MinecraftLauncher. Program will exit."

,MegaMobass,2012-03-04T02:25Z,would you mind putting up 1.2.3 Please. the only way for me to have mods in the game is through your download (mostly because i am incompetent to put them in my self). :) please and thank-you.
