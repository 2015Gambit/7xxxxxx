,crashdiet69,2012-04-16T21:32Z,"works perfectly!  Installs right over FCP v10.0.  All you gotta do is mount the image, drag it over to your application folder and hit replace.  Couldn't be any easier!!  Thanks again for the up! :)"

,itismelee,2012-08-24T09:53Z,Hey guys... I launched the .dmg file to open a drive with the program icon. When I double-clicked it the application worked without installation! Is this OK or I am missing something? 
,xxBAZINGAxx,2012-09-04T15:33Z,@itismelee I had the same problem. It would open and work but it wouldn't install to HD. I manually opened HD to applications and dragged and dropped Final Cut Pro into applications. You should see it coping the 2.11 GB to your HD.
