Tolstoy - What I Believe - the abortion called christianity

For Gandhi: 
A.  Jesus was the greatest human that ever lived
B.  Tolstoy was the greatest human alive in Gandhi's day, the most Christlike.

'I like your Christ.  I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike your Christ.'  Gandhi.

Regarding Tolstoy:

The Kingdom of God is Within You is the reason we know the name Gandhi. Gandhi read this (begin with the last 2 chapters) as a young law student. It entirely changed the direction of his life. Tolstoy's work regarding Jesus became Gandhi's "Bible" in South Africa and India.

The Gospel in Brief is Tolstoy's translation of the Bible. The greatest story ever told - without all the Voodoo added later on.

The Law of Love and the Law of Violence, written 2 weeks before his death, was instrumental to Dr. King; a book he read when at Crozier Seminary in his youth.

Notice:  Tolstoy's books on Jesus' Teachings often are written to be read beginning, end, and only then, middle.  This 'What I Believe' is such a book, and hence the sequencing of this audio rendering.  Should you wish a different sequencing, it will be easy for you to achieve.
