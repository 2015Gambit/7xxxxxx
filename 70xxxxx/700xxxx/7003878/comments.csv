mistake with the set number, this set is the same
as set 256 posted before.
It is to much if I ask you the set number 162 ?
Thank you again, great job"

,bialystok,2012-02-03T14:48Z,"sorry pfanpb, just now I see the comment in the set 256, You mention before that set 282 was almost the same.
Forget my previous comment"
,pfanpb,2012-02-04T01:43Z,I have heard rumors of another Christmas-themed set 256 but have never seen it myself.
