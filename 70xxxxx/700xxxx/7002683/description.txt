These have been grabbed from different sources... some resampled from APE into FLAC, some non standard text removed from tags, some artwork added to directories. Seed & Enjoy... 

If you have other albums by the Vandals in lossless (punk sounds horrible in lossy), please feel free to post them as comments. Thanks.
