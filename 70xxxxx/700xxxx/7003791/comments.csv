,scott_ehm,2012-03-13T09:20Z,"@cole90

All i've got is questions for you: What did you expect? Why are you here? Why did you write that? Why did you choose that conjugation of 'shot'?"
,kantankruz,2012-03-24T15:43Z,"Thanks for the upload, as we don't have this movie in our cinemas, this is the only way to see it (I have been hanging out BIG TIME to see it). When it comes out on DVD it will be bought and racked next to my T&E seasons dvd's. They will get their money from me! You hear that! GREAT JOB!"
,DarkDrakayn,2012-03-30T00:56Z,"A/V = 10/9, The movie gets a faint line of static for the last half but its hardly noticeable. Other than that the movie was an absolute must see for Tim and Eric fans."
,resmith,2012-04-29T04:11Z,A V 9 M 0  If you like gay guy shit then this is for you. I like dumb comedy's but this one is too stupid to find any humor at all.
,Andycor3,2012-05-07T01:11Z,"Great quality! but the movie itself lol it was pretty SHRIM! 
I wouldn't give it a rating."
,hamandrye,2012-05-31T09:09Z,"i don't know if its because i am watching it with VLC movie viewer, but the voice is delayed at about 33 minutes in. "

,Hared,2012-07-21T16:02Z,"I'm sure this is just my own specific problem, but the audio doesn't work for me. Also it won't work on windows media player, but it works fine on winamp. What should I do to get it to work properly??  "

,DreaD151,2012-08-09T16:16Z,10 out of 10 Scrims on Audio and 10 out of 10 Scroats on Video Great Job ICM369! MOVIE WAS A PERFECT 10.. i suggest if you dont know who tim and eric are watch some of their shows on youtube or adultswim.com before downloading this its not your usual comedy ....
,subject76,2012-09-11T05:10Z,"Yeah, ""Tim and Eric ""Awesome Show"" (Good Job)"" Was my all time favorite Cult show! They could do anything and I'd pretty much like it. But you REALLY have to be a follower of their show to understand their humour. It's Strange. Strange, Best Friends since College/Film School. "
