There are those who consider this the best of Tabor's later recordings. And it is excellent, but for those new to her, this is even more stark and harrowing than usual. Still, it's a triumph of form and content, and her voice, now maturing into a richer, deeper, lower register, has become (if possible) a more formidable instrument than before.
