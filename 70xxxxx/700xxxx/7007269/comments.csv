Thanks for the upload though mate, I was meaning to watch this. Good quality but seriously guys, don't bother. Poor adaption of the book and Kaya (the one who plays Cathy) is a dire actress.

Check out the 2009 TV adaption with Tom Hardy, the best of the recent adaptions and up there with the versions of old!


Thanks again."
