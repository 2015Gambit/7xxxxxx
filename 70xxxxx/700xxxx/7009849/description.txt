I came across this rare LP while vinyl shopping a few days ago and had a chance to rip it just today. I have not seen it being posted on any blogs and few here wanted it, so here you go people! A review on this LP is below (not my review but I agree with it in general):

The only full-length release from the Plastercene Replicas, "GLOW" was a brilliant release, highlighted by the very distinctive vocals of Charlie Salmon. Most people's introduction to the band came courtesy of the excellent video for Salmon's "We Can Walk", as well as its follow-up, the Stephen Stewart-sung "All I See". As a step forward from their self-title EP of several years previous, "GLOW" shows a band more fully in focus on their sound. The recording is bright and jangly, with a host of drummers sitting in, Spinal Tap-like, as able backing for guitarist/vocalists Salmon and Stewart and bassist/vocalist Brendan Cavin. Like the Jellyfish Babies, the Replicas never achieved massive success, but did spawn a piece of Canadian indie music genius, with "We Can Walk" standing out as perhaps the greatest Canadian indie single EVER.
