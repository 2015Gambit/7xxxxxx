,r.trifun,2012-02-06T02:09Z,"Hi 80z, I'm back at last, I used to have the user name rtrifunov. I've been absent for a while, but lately I've had a chance to keep up with Your ever expanding and, in my opinion, most valuable music library in the world. Glow is a fantastic rare gem, thnx. Do You, by any chance, possess R.A.F. - Restless Spirit (1987)? Your efforts are more appreciated and more important than You probably think they are. Cheers. "
,robssbmw,2012-02-07T08:13Z,"Hi 80zforever, I've been downloading all your stuff, and nearly got the lot. Absolutely amazing collection that you have got. 
I love listening to all this 80's stuff. I can't believe how good, some of the stuff is, that I missed out on, at the time. I love, Aerial -  Maneuvers. Almost my favorite album.
I just had to register with Piratebay to say THANKYOU. 
Thanks for the great memories and the great albums that I have never heard of.
I'm seeding where I can.
As a request, I have The Planets-Goonhillydown. I once saw another album at a record store by them, but didn't take up the opportunity to buy the record. My mistake,--Would you have it.
Thanks, for all your hard work...."
,ishti,2012-02-07T19:01Z,Bro Plzzzzzzz repost rare hits of the 80s vol. 37 !!
[V],80zforever,2012-02-07T22:46Z,"dragonbandit314, Were you not supposed to get retired after downloading all the stuff I posted? Don't expect me to go into seclusion before you lol

r.trifun. Glad to have you back here. We missed you.  I bought that LP a while back but it skips in a few songs. I got so pissed off that never got around to rip it (had paid decent $ for it). I will give it another listen after some cleaning and if it's worth posting, I'd do so. 

robssbmw, hey, nice to have you on board. you're very welcome and thanks for seeding. About The Planets, I think it was their 1981 record ""Spot"" that you had spotted LOL . I have it for sure and will be part of the next 4 rare 80s records series I'd post. 

haishti, dude I am actually seeding the initial torrent and get loads of downloads on vol 37. How come you can't get it then? I will re-post it, no worries. "
,r.trifun,2012-02-08T08:26Z,"Hi 80z, thnx for the reply. I've missed you guys too.
I hope you'll be able to clean and properly recover Restless Spirit, this album has a very special emotion, and a nice ethereal ballad from it, can't remember the name of the song, is really really something. Thnx once again.     "
,dragonbandit314,2012-02-09T10:42Z,"Hi 80z, I was so upset at the thought of you retiring first that I had to get in there quick (Chortle). I have done my 40 years and needed the time to listen to all your incredible UP's. Some of your early stuff now have no seeds and I have had one hell of a job to try and complete these series. Found a lot of incredible 80's blogs on the way. I am now so busy sorting my music out that I don't know how I ever fitted work in ... LOL.
I will continue to support you until you also have had enough. Cheers and be well. T."
