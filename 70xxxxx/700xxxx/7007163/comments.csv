,Dwch,2012-02-05T09:43Z,"Just skimmed through... it's a really good rip! Definitely sourced from DVD. Good audio level and perfect sync from what I could tell. Considering the file size (700mb), I'd definitely give it A:10 V:10.
The only thing preventing it from being identical to a straight up DVD rip is a small watermark ('property of...') which appears at the top of the screen from time to time.

Thank you eztremezone and TARGET. "

,Kaillia,2012-02-08T13:09Z,"@ Wellsj
Either you were unaffected by what she did to the UK as Prime Minister, or you were never born then, and have lived a sheltered life since.

While some parts of the country flourished, much of it didn't. She left Britain good for some people, but the majority were left with nothing and had no government to support them in their time of need. It pretty much says it all that her own party gave her the boot!

@ Peaballs. Another brainless twat. If you knew anything about her, you'd know a statue already exists. Why, I don't know, as she was one of the least popular Prime Ministers the UK has had. "

Somebody said they would stoke the fire, well....I'll be there to help when he/she needs a break to take over...what Meryl Streep is doing in this ""watered down "" version of this evil womans story is anybodys guess....pity they didn't show Thatcher as she really was, a right bitch who only cared (if thats ok to use that word with her ) for herself and her tory cronies, the misery she caused back then is so bad I cant put it into words. A PURE EVIL Ba***RD of a bitch. may she rot in hell for what she did."
,manzel,2012-02-18T10:11Z,"Audio - 9

Movie - utter crap!  Meryl is a top class actress and her portrayal of Thatcher was spot on but really...the storyline was pathetic.  Unless you were around for the Thatcher years you will learn nothing from this movie.  Flashbacks and conjecture about her dementia all the way.  What could have been a brilliant re-telling of the life of Britain's most memorable PM (good or bad) was a Disneyesque puff piece."

Are you totally stupid Kaillia. How the hell can you say that when she won 3 landslide elections! in 1979, 1983 and 1987! 

Yeah she was unpopular on the left but the right loved her. My family were in the centre and although not big fans of her they knew she was far better for Britain than that turnip Foot was or even Kinnock. And so did the majority of the UK hence the 3 election wins."
