The.Finder.S01E04.Swing.And.A.Miss.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD [MKV 324MB]

[/b][/color] From the creator of the hit series ???Bones??? comes ???The Finder???, a quirky, one-hour procedural centering on a remarkable man with an eccentric personality and a unique gift to help others recover what they???ve lost.
Iraq war veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) gained a reputation in his army days as being the go-to guy for tracking down insurgents and deserters and finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Unfortunately one IED found Walter before he could find it, resulting in severe brain damage with a lasting and unexpected effect.
Walter transformed from someone skilled at the standard recovery of people and things in wartime scenarios to someone - something - much more extraordinary: a Finder.
Walter left the military, but his reputation as a discreet professional able to unearth anything and anyone passed on to generals, politicians and other powerful figures.
