It's about freedom of information to anyone who can access it regardless of financial status, location in the world, &/or knowledge that there is more than what's fed to you out there to consume. Thank you, VTV. Thank you, PB. More balls in the few of you than the whole of Americas political system. Viva la revolucion!"

But in the case of the daily show I can't access the material online, since it's restricted to American ip's, so my only option is to pirate it. Thanks so much for putting these torrents on here."
