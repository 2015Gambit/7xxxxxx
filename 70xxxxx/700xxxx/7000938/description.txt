Woodstock Music & Art Fair (informally, Woodstock or The Woodstock Festival) was a music festival, 
billed as "An Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music"  It was held at Max Yasgur's 600-acre 
(2.4 kmÂ²; 240 ha, 0.94 miÂ²) dairy farm in the Catskills near the hamlet of White Lake in the town 
of Bethel, New York, from August 15 to August 18, 1969. Bethel, in Sullivan County, is 43 miles 
(69 km) southwest of the town of Woodstock, New York, in adjoining Ulster County.

During the sometimes rainy weekend, thirty-two acts performed outdoors in front of 500,000 concert-goers.
It is widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history. Rolling Stone called it one of the 50 
Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll.

The event was captured in the 1970 documentary movie Woodstock, an accompanying soundtrack album, and 
Joni Mitchell's song "Woodstock" which commemorated the event and became a major hit for 
Crosby, Stills, Nash n Young.
