Mike, Nikki, Maggie and their families live in a remarkable placeâ€”beneath the massive gleaming white dishes of a space tracking station, located in the heart of the Australian outback. The kids are scientists\' children. Yet they\'re ordinary kids facing the ordinary problems of growing up, but under very extraordinary circumstances. Home is a window on the universe. Students come to the tracking station from all around the world to conduct space-related experiments under the sponsorship of the Wright Foundation, an organisation dedicated to the promotion of science education. Nikki is 13 and into science. Her dream is to be the first person on Mars. Mike is 14 and he thinks science sucks. Jimi Hendrix is his hero. With his horse and guitar, Mike knows all there is to know about the meaning of life. Who cares about the stars? Tony, Mike\'s dad, and Marie, Nikki\'s mum, tentatively fall in love. Nikki and Mike do the same. And nine year old Maggie gets in everybody\'s way.
