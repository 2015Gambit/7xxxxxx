Pic-a-POD has been a popular utility for many years, downloading pictures of the day from a selection of sites and allowing you to set your desktop wallpaper to a specific picture, or to a random picture that can be changed at a chosen interval. Pic-a-POD 2 is a complete re-write of this app and is now available in the Mac App Store for US 99 cents. It allows access to 8 different POD sites and you can get the PODs for any date back to 1st January 2009.

A picture browser allows easy access to all your downloaded PODs, while a detailed view shows a larger image and more text information. View the pic on it's original web site, or share the link using email, Facebook, Twitter or Google+. If you set Pic-a-POD to change to a random desktop at intervals, you can also set it to include a picture from your iPhoto library occasionally. Pic-a-POD also allows for multiple monitors and multiple workspaces in Mission Control.

What's New:
â€¨* The Pic-a-POD window will now fill with pics, going back in time if
  required.â€¨
* To adjust the number of pics shown, change the size of the window.â€¨
* This is particularly useful if you like to get only one or two pics per day or if you have a large monitor.
