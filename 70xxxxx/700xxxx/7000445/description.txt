PlayStation 3 developer PS3Hen has released some updates regarding his Hybrid
Firmware 4.0. This firmware mod requires a hardware flasher as well as a PlayStation 3
that is on custom firmware 3.55. With this release you will need to patch the firmware
yourself with instructions in the PDF. Changes include the XMBFM ported by PS3Hen, released
by DeViL303, PS2 game disk recognition and icon changes.

I'm not going to make you re-download another 180MB PUP file, Instead I've decided to
release a patch which has all the tools required to patch my Version 2 pup to be Version 2.5
