,silencesummer,2012-02-06T00:57Z,"This is actually pretty awesome, well, some of the songs are. Silverstein kinda gets on my nerves (aside from their early works), but this is pretty good. Some of the songs are kinda lame, I hate the guy's singing voice for the pop-punkish parts (too monotone), but other than that it's pretty good, and a good torrent. Also, no idea they would have ever cover something as epic as Orchid, and they did a pretty damn good job. "
