WHATS NEW
---------

Included in the v1.60 update patch includes not only Operation Arrowhead,
but also Black Gauntlet.


HOW TO
------

- Install a FRESH copy of Arma II OA.
  NOTE: this was tested on the Arma II/OA that offers a crack to be
        installed at the end of the installation - DO NOT APPLY CRACK!
        and do NOT install the Battlepack update thing.

- Run the appropriate reg file in the Install ANY Update folder***
  (Win x64 or Win x32 depending upon YOUR OS)

- Install the v1.60 Update Patch.
  NOTE: I used the update included in this torrent that I found on
        a torrent site somewhere. I am pretty sure the factory installer
        will work just fine located here:
        http://www.arma2.com/supply/game-updates
        (The Arma 2: Combined Operations / Operation Arrowhead /
        Reinforcements 1.50-1.60 update)
        Alternatively you can choose to not download the v1.60 from this
        torrent and use the one you may already have. I have left this
        option open to your discretion.

- At the end of the 1.60 patch it will again ask you to install the
  Battlepack update thing - hit cancel = and the patch will finish.

- Play Arma II/OA from the shortcut from your desktop.
  NOTE: NO CRACK was EVER applied during this operation and works 100%
        PERFECT.
- Your done. GO FUCKING PLAY WITH NO CRASHES WHAT-SO-EVER!!!
  NOTE: You will HAVE to start a new campaign because old saves are
        incompatible with v1.60
