,RMJ113,2012-02-02T23:21Z,"the game never had CRASH issues!

I does have ""protection"" called FADE!

Fade = you might as well through rocks because your aim will not work with weapons"
,Majestik1,2012-02-04T08:01Z,"@RMJ113 never had CRASH issues??? You my friend must be one of the lucky few for ""whatever reason"". I have tried for 3 days to find a solution to:
A) Editor crashes
B) Campaign crashing after 4-5 minutes
C) Antialias/Draw distance crashes.
If you would have had these issues you would know this.
And aiming does work with this FIX.
Please don't make claims against other people's torrents unless you know what you are talking about."
,Majestik1,2012-02-04T08:04Z,Some people report success with the SKID's crack - but did not work for me or many others on the net. PEACE!
,Majestik1,2012-02-04T08:06Z,I can't BELIEVE that I cannot write S.K.I.D.R.O.W. as a complete word on this fucking thread.
,Majestik1,2012-02-04T08:07Z,SKIDROW
,Majestik1,2012-02-04T08:08Z,"MUTHER FUCKING DATABASE IS FUCKED UP, MAN!!! I tried since yesterday to post my comment and narrowed it down (SO I THOUGHT) to SKIDROW's name. Fucking bitch ass database!!!"
,Majestik1,2012-02-05T09:45Z,I have taken this torrent DOWN. too many people are downloading and NOT seeding. So I am going to put it up at Demonoid where people actually SEED. FUCK all you leechin no-sharing bastards! I guess I am collecting some old karma.
,RMJ113,2012-02-07T18:19Z,"I made no claims ! 
 I just stated a fact !
I have many friends that have many of the arma 2 releases, they all have fade issues only!"
,Majestik1,2012-03-07T03:28Z,"cool, NP RMJ113.
PEACE!"
,ZalHack,2012-04-23T07:31Z,Can anyone confirm this is fade free?
,Majestik1,2012-05-03T01:29Z,"This FUCKING torrent has NO FADE ISSUES.

This torrent SOLVES THAT ISSUE!!!

gawd DAY-AMM!!"
,NeedWeed,2012-05-08T22:33Z,this works perfect tks
,Hoj1,2012-05-08T23:47Z,"I get a 'invalid cd-key' in game when trying to connect to servers in multi, when i change cd-key to the second one, needed to run the game via lan, i get error after starting the game - 'Bad Serial Number given in Setup' - any fix for that? or maby someone got cd-key working on multi?"
,Majestik1,2012-05-09T08:03Z,"@ NeedWeed - You're welcome.

@Hoj1 - As stated per description and torrent readme file, don't know or give a fuck about online/multi play issues. Serial number issues? dude go somewhere else."
,Hoj1,2012-05-09T12:35Z,"anyw still the games crash sometimes when playing single playing so, nah, u go somewhere else, go suck some big dicko with that shitty fix"
,NeedWeed,2012-05-09T22:11Z,no u must understand we are doing it wrong the fix is fine 
,NeedWeed,2012-05-10T04:56Z,ok im back to clear things up and to say im sick of the spamming of all arma torrents.4 every arma torrent on on here any time someone says it works we get these company paid wankers just spamming shit so we get fed up and tired and just give up.the reality is u should not be having any fade issues if u dont crack or modify anything as of now im playing online on tunngle lan because u can not play online on bohemia servers with a downloaded game ie from piratebay it even comes up online and says illegal copies may degread and fade does not kick in.i did not test this for a long time but i did host my own game for about 25 mins which someone joined and we ran around testing wepons and blowing stuff up with no fade issues.i will have proper time to test this 2moro.as of now this works and if not 4 the reg edit file which the uploader was kind to give us arma would not update not even when i manually did it my self.so thank you again and trolls beware charlie sheen is coming to get u 
,NeedWeed,2012-05-10T05:20Z,and i even have this patch/update which is the exact same size and sum russian guy got it for me which i downloaded off a russian site in a arma 2 torrent but it would not work without the reg edit file from this torrent so its a little srtange that a russian guy who was in the tunngle room playing this game on multiplayer would give me the same update/patch if it didnt work 
,Majestik1,2012-05-14T09:58Z,"Thanks for the back up NeedWeed.

YEAH!!! SO LISTEN UP FUCKERZ!!!
ME... NeedWeed AND CHARLIE MUTHER FUCKIN' SHEEN...



...are commin' to get 'cha



."
,nomim,2012-05-23T00:45Z,"Hey, just clarifying, this isn't the full game right? Its just a fix/expansion/patch (judging off of the file size)? And can you upload a full cracked English version of this please? Thanks in advance."
,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-05-25T01:40Z,"This works allows the game to play, but then it just crashes anyway with dr watson."
,Jalbertio,2012-06-01T01:07Z,Does this work with DAYZ mod?
,Majestik1,2012-06-18T02:18Z,"@ nomim; Yes. No. There are enough torrents of Arma II that I don't need to polute the torrent pool.

@ SpaceCadet6969754; Don't diss my shit because you're using outdated Windows XP.

@ Jalbertio; Don't know. You could try it I guess. Haven't heard of DAYZ - but thanks to you I now have."
,Zer0XxXThund3r,2012-08-04T08:06Z,hey man does this actually work for Dayz mod just asking becouse you said on another torrent that it did. sorry for bothering you I hope you don't get mad. I just want to know before I get my hopes up but I'm still downloading this for the campaing.
,ccrusher1,2012-08-15T20:36Z,"Ok, everyone listen up. The update is not what causes FADE to become active. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR ORIGINAL INSTALL WAS! If you were smart enough to get the torrented version that DOES NOT have FADE, then you will never run into fade issues... AS LONG AS YOU DON'T APPLY A CRACK, AND USE ALCOHOL 52%'S A.C.I.D. TO CLOAK THE DEVICE.

What FADE does:
     -Checks your .exe to make sure it's EXACTLY the size it should be
          -If found to be different, even by 1kb, it will reduce in game features down to where it becomes unplayable.

What FADE does not do:
     -Directly check to make sure you're using a CD
     -Check patches
     -Check CD key
     -Check in game files.

Also, Majestik1, please try to control yourself. This is a torrent site, not a bar. Lol."
,davo43,2012-08-20T09:20Z,Dear Majestik1 not trying to be mean but i have read ur post I am asking you to take a chill pill and stop swearing say dam for fudge ir gunt but stop raging what we are doing is illegal any way so why u complaining   
,MiGKiller29,2012-08-26T03:34Z,"Majestic One, could I please get a link to the ArmA II OA that this was tested on?"
,MiGKiller29,2012-08-26T03:36Z,Could I please get a link to the ArmA II OA that this was tested on?
,MiGKiller29,2012-08-26T04:13Z,(sorry for the double comment)
,MiGKiller29,2012-08-28T06:11Z,"Thanks Majestic One, it works perfectly.

Also, (Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;m pretty sure) I found the one this was tested on, https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5670611/Arma_2_Operation_Arrowhead"
,giggedyguy,2012-09-19T22:42Z,"There's instructions about getting Dayz to work with Arrowhead alone, but it's based on having the purchased copy installed. Try it anyway and see if it works with this. The title of the thread is ""DayZ with only Operation Arrowhead""  found at Steam Users' Forums > Steam Game Discussions > # - C > ARMA series > ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead"
,giggedyguy,2012-09-20T22:03Z,And apply his reg fix or you won't be able to update. I've got mine all the way up to 1.62 now and it definitely fixed some things.
