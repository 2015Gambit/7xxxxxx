,Tanlic,2012-02-05T08:33Z,"Watched the first part of season 2 and it was ok but  without Andy Whitfield who sadly passed away you can't possibly expect it to be as good. The man was simply perfect for the part 

However I will continue to watch so thanks ettv. "

Great Torrent! Thanks!"
,noybinhd,2012-03-20T15:38Z,"Andy was a great actor for the part but both him and the new actor are so small. Spartacus was a huge man like Oenomaus.

Also the revenge part kind of throws me a bit. Slavery is not a natural human condition so slaves tend to revolt if not held in place by massive violence and threat. Spartacus and the others revolted because they desired freedom not because of any particular dominus.

Awesome show but Season 1 is still top dog in the series!"
