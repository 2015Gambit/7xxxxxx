Augmented by Genetics and Cybernetics the Transhuman reign over the Globe. The year is 2030 and the planet rebuilds still in the wake of World War III, the "War on Terror". The United States is no more, yet from its ashes arose the Imperium which seeks to rule all it surveys. For vengeance, and survival Imperator Romulus sends his newest space battleship: DSV Excalibur to seek dangerous allies to help him complete his dominance over the planet. If he succeeds no nation will be free from Julius Romulus Giovanni's boot, in particular the small German Dukedom of Saxe-Coburg.
One woman is a well honed blade: Frederika von Gotha, Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and a product of genetic engineering called a Morningstar, as a spy for her tiny nation she is given a mission, learn about the mysterious Falcanians and the secrets they keep hidden away on their artificial island.

"Falco Invictus is science fiction at its best. Rodney C. Johnson's novella is as sophisticated as it is imaginative. Through his profound and entertaining story, Johnson uses a well-crafted blend of mystic history, futuristic visions, and superb imagery to bring the Falcanian peoples and society to life. From the brilliant and solemn Nadia Korelia to the mysterious and powerful Sharr Khan, Falco Invictus is guaranteed to intrigue and delight."
