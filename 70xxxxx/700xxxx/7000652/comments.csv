,CAPTAINBEYEO2,2012-02-28T20:26Z,"Thanks for this.
I'm a noob of the older generation,but have
D/L this with not a clue what to do.

Dropped it into IMGBURN and off it went,
the burn speed showed to be 14. Don't know
if this ok as it was some one who asked  if 
i could burn games,so i thought i would give 
it a go. will find out when they go to play this
on their XBOX.
                      THANKS FOR YOUR HARD  WORK AND THE UPLOAD."
,alienhead22,2012-03-19T20:55Z,Is this live safe?
,duffman94,2012-03-27T22:08Z,you should put up the first need for speed underground and the first lego star wars
,spongebob12321,2012-03-28T10:04Z,"The first nfsu is not compatible with 360 , there is no emu"
,Dadoxbox,2012-04-18T20:50Z,Cool game Thanks for upload dude ! :)
,jlbf0786,2012-07-17T20:00Z,"Its not compatible with LT+2.0, if you've got a flashed drive then its probably not gonna work. I've burned numerous 360 games without trouble, and as soon as you select ""Play NFS Underground 2"" a message appears that states ""its not supported on your Xbox 360 console, an update may be available at xbox.com/games...etc""
So if you're using a flashed console it probably wont work."
,spongebob12321,2012-07-18T20:08Z,THIS WORKS ON LT 2.0 AND 3.0
,jlbf0786,2012-08-05T07:06Z,"well it's not working on my xbox360, it just pulls up the game art where you can choose to play game.. then after clicking ""play game"" you get a message that says this game is not compatible with your console, etc.. 

I downloaded using utorrent, opened with Winrar.. and burned using Imgburn. 
...

I must be missing something!"
