,spunkster,2012-04-24T02:49Z,"Wow. What a total piece of shit. Just... wow. This awful program managed to drag my computer down to a screeching halt. Totally froze, took about 10 minutes to get to .60% complete for converting a h.264 mkv video at 1880kbps to an h.264 lower res mp4 at 700kbps. All the apps took 30 seconds each to respond (like to switch windows or move a window). I CLOSED the program and it took another 10 minutes of agony to actually regain any kind of control over the system. Never again. "

,oneoftheother,2012-08-11T08:50Z,I'll seed for a little.
,bnz420,2012-08-29T21:50Z,program works fine but still when i try to send a file i previously converted (.avi to .dvd) manually it says this feature is available only for registered users??? (burns fine when promted post conversion)
