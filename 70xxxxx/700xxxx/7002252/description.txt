This is a movie by the most famous of Israeli Directors - Amos Gitai
who brought us the courageous work - Kadosh (which we posted here for
you earlier)

Today's movie is about some gals from Europe kidnapped and sold off into
prostitution into Israel


A most unpleasant story idea - however Amos Gitai isn't to be ignored
