Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies
Description
The Call of Duty: Zombies phenomenon has risen back to life.

Adapted from the best-selling console hit and built specifically for tablets and smartphones, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies delivers maps and weapons never before seen on mobile and 50 levels of â€œDead-Ops Arcade,â€ providing the ultimate undead challenge for fans of Call of Dutyâ€™s signature zombie warfare.

Play solo or join a team of up to 4 players as you mow down hordes of zombies with Call of Dutyâ€™s all-new interface, now featuring Voice Chat for the first time ever. 

Sure, earning Achievements and Point-Multipliers is nice, but to survive these Co-Op Maps, youâ€™ll need friends as much as youâ€™ll need firepower. Lucky for you, not only will the weapons and perks you love from Call of Duty lie at your fingertips, so will Voice Chat, a brand-new feature to the Call of Duty Zombies mobile experience that allows you to communicate with your fellow zombie-slayers in real-time. For the first time ever, youâ€™ll hear your friendsâ€™ calls for helpâ€¦and their screams for mercy. 

As if that wasnâ€™t enough, Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies also includes â€œDead-Ops Arcadeâ€ mode, an arcade-style top-down shooter perfectly suited for mobile combat vets. Unlocking the mode is easyâ€”simply find the four missing coins in the gameâ€™s menus. Once enabled, youâ€™ll have access to a 50-level zombie gauntlet with full Game Center leaderboard support, ensuring everyone knows of your skull-crushing talents. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies has been optimized for 3rd-generation devices and higher, providing unparalleled graphics and performance. As an iOS Universal App, the game operates the same whether played on iPhone, iPod, or iPad, meaning a zombieâ€™s brain will splatter just as vividly on your iPhone 4 Retina Display as on your iPad 2.
