,tinnypwns,2012-04-13T02:21Z,it dont work when i try to put it in modio as inject new file something pops up saying an exception has been made and it just closes modio and when i try to copy a dungeon defenders save to my USB it dont let me
,tinnypwns,2012-04-13T02:31Z,i got it to work but its fake when you put it in your save it corrupts it so dungeon defenders gives your olc save back like a backup so yea
,tinnypwns,2012-04-14T04:26Z,nvm it works i did it wrong thnx for the torrent could you upload one that has some more modded items?
