,Myrorna,2012-02-03T17:56Z,"Appears we need more seeders, stuck on 29% just waiting to seed.. "
,gibson121,2012-02-10T19:43Z,I too am stuck on a percentage and seeding :/
,mikkeyg,2012-02-19T14:19Z,"96 peers i'm assuming are all on 30.7%. 5 seeders, none of which are online :("
,the00negative,2012-03-03T21:12Z,"Shit guy's sorry, I can seed for only so long, before I have to get off my connection. I'm assuming at least some of you guy's have a much faster dl speed than me (I have 200 kb/s) and I said I would update on eps 20 and 26 and I'll try to seed as long as I can so that way when I get off others can seed. Sorry for the inconvenience."
