                the Major Crime Squad investigate crime and murder in all 
                quarters of multicultural Sydney.

                But overarching all, is the quest for Detective Zane Malik 
                to find the truth behind a car bomb attack which kills two 
                men.

                The Major Crime Squad form a joint task force with the NSO 
                (National Security Organisation) to deal with the crime. 
                There is paranoia in the city and fallout on the Muslim 
                community.

                Malik knows that in order to stop the circle of hate, he 
                must solve the crime. Was the bomb really an act of 
                extremists, as the media suggest, or a sophisticated 
                killing by a career criminal? Malik doggedly pursues the 
                truth until he, too, becomes a target.

                Inspector Patricia Wright questions his motives but her 
                vision is clouded by personal issues she wants to remain 
                hidden from the squad. Crime has touched her own family.
