I will have my CCNA very soon so I need as much knowledge as possible for the next job. Any other recommendations feel free to let me know. Sucks to be out of work :("

This is a very valuable upload, I want to thank you for that. Just want to add one detail if possible: Do you have the images for GNS3 (program free to download) that Jeremy uses in the labs? How can I get them? 
Thank you again for the upload."

You can get GNS3 from GNS3.net, and the IOS images from here:

10.28 GB!!! Any idea about the differences among images? I was reading the txt file and they repeat for example the IOS c7200 several times. Any way to get the same images that Jeremy used in the videos? "
