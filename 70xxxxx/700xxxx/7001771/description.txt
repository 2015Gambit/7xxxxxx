Is certification valuable? Absolutely. The Cisco CCNA certification can open more doors
in your career field than you ever thought possible. The CCNA certification teaches
you the "nuts and bolts" of Cisco devices, the Cisco IOS, and big picture network concepts.

...but is there more to it than just the CCNA? Absolutely.
This has been the driving force behind this one-of-a-kind series.
Cisco CCNA Labs: Cisco for the Real World teaches you everything that you need to
know that may or may not have been directly certification related.
It's just not possible to write exam questions that covers these types of concepts!

Pick up where certification exams leave off. With this practical, in-depth guide to the entire network infrastructure, youâ€™ll learn how to deal with real Cisco networks, rather than the hypothetical situations presented on exams like the CCNA. Network Warrior takes you step by step through the world of routers, switches, firewalls, and other technologies based on the author's extensive field experience. You'll find new content for MPLS, IPv6, VoIP, and wireless in this completely revised second edition, along with examples of Cisco Nexus 5000 and 7000 switches throughout.

Topics include:

    An in-depth view of routers and routing
    Switching, using Cisco Catalyst and Nexus switches as examples
    SOHO VoIP and SOHO wireless access point design and configuration
    Introduction to IPv6 with configuration examples
    Telecom technologies in the data-networking world, including T1, DS3, frame relay, and MPLS
    Security, firewall theory, and configuration, as well as ACL and authentication
    Quality of Service (QoS), with an emphasis on low-latency queuing (LLQ)
    IP address allocation, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and device failures
