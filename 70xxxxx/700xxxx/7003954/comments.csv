,Robstar360,2012-02-02T17:09Z,"Thank you so much Boobsman! It says it works with 2.0... Is this going to be like Soul Calibur V that it only works with 2.0 on certain drives? Or will this work on my Lite-On? Also, Do I need to apply your ""LT3.0 ISO Patch To LT2.0 for FFXIII-2"" or is this free-standing, ready to go on all 2.0 models? (I am not capable of playing online)"
[V],boobsman,2012-02-02T17:27Z,"@ Robstar360, no sorry for the mistake on Soul Calibur V, that will work on all LT2.0 drives, i cut n paste the description from my FF 13-2 release n did not see my mistake :( 
Both this and SC 5 will work on LT2.0 machines as long as they are not patched, its only the PAL Complex release of FF13-2 that has been patched for LT3.0 n needs to be downgraged, which i have also posted :)"
,fallengun04,2012-02-02T17:38Z,@Robstar360 if you havent updated your 360 to LT3.0 then u need to use the LT3.0 ISO Patch To LT2.0 for FFXIII-2.
,goodgun,2012-02-03T01:34Z,boobsman any chance you could upload wipeout in the zone RF or Pal version?
,Mad_Matt,2012-02-03T02:02Z,"""Both this and SC 5 will work on LT2.0 machines as long as they are not patched"" 
Does that include Liteon drives? also any chance of getting a copy of Neverdead that works on Liteon LT2.0 drives? Thanks in advance."
,Mad_Matt,2012-02-03T02:09Z,"""Both this and SC 5 will work on LT2.0 machines as long as they are not patched""

Does that mean that it works on Liteon drives with 2.0? Any chance of getting Neverdead that works on Liteon drives with LT 2.0?"
,Mad_Matt,2012-02-03T02:11Z,Sorry. Didn't mean to double post.....
,fallengun04,2012-02-03T04:10Z,"@Mad_Matt You can use this patch for NeverDead to play on LT2.0.

,Robstar360,2012-02-03T04:15Z,"@Mad_Matt I Burned this game as-is and it did not work on my phat lite-on drive with LT+2.0. The game appears on the dashboard but when you press ""A"" to play, you receive an ""unrecognized disc"" error. If you find a solution to this (like a patch to make newer games work on lite-on with 2.0) please let me know. Thanks =)"
,Robstar360,2012-02-03T04:30Z,"@Fallengun are you sure? I really want to try patching this ff xiii-2 NTSC ISO with that patch, but I don't want to make another coaster. What works for most people on LT+2.0 doesn't seem to apply for us with the old phat lite-on drives. Please let me know if your sure or not."
,fallengun04,2012-02-03T05:58Z,@Robster360 I cant guarantee that it will work but u just gotta have to try it. Maybe it'll work.I've read that some people tried this on their Lt 2.0 console (liteon phat). Try it man.

,steelllynx,2012-02-13T20:53Z,"isrmicha:

You need a lite-on iHas burner to burn XGD3 games.  Truncate does not work.  I have both the iHas124 and iHas324 and they both work fine for these XGD3 games."

,SuperTsubasa,2012-03-01T22:30Z,"i burned 2 discs with error on 96% , this iso is damaged, as no one yet said that is working."
,steelllynx,2012-04-06T05:19Z,"This copy is saying unsupported disc, BenQ 360 drive, LT+ 2.0.  I burned with a Verbatim DL on a properly flashed iHas drive.  Other XGD3 games work such as Sonic Generations.

What could I have done wrong where this says Unsupported disc?  It shows the game logo where it is supposed to."
,punkfreak123,2012-06-08T23:53Z,"Can anyone confirm that this iso actually works? I burned using an IHas drive with the correct firmware/settings and i got 2 coasters at around 60%. 

Ive successfully burned a few XGD3 games before, so i think this is a bad iso."
,punkfreak123,2012-06-10T00:34Z,"Nevermind, i was finally able to get a successful burn tweaking a few settings. The game runs fine when installed to HD.

I can confirm that it does work."
