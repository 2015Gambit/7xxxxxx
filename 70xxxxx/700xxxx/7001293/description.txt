"Gambling Again"

Burt becomes obsessed with gambling when he 
believes he can reclaim all the items he 
lost when he bet away all the Chance's 
belongings nearly 20 years ago. Worried 
about his bad habit reemerging, Virginia and 
Jimmy try to intervene but soon get swept up 
in the betting frenzy and develop their own 
gambling habit. But their luck begins to run 
out when they miss Shelley's staged play 
written by Sabrina and starring Hope as the 
lead.

Evolve...or die.
