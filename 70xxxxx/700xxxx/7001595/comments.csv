I used Wii Game Converter GXS to convert the wbfs to an iso."
,deamonicus,2012-02-19T21:45Z,"why in the world would you use a program to convert a wbfs file to an iso? listen a file in .wbfs format is a compressed version of an .iso file. its a lot smaller in most cases, and wont fill your hdd with useless files. might i suggest that for future installs of games in wbfs format, use a freeware program called wii backup manager. it will handle installing both extensions, wbfs, and iso. might i also suggest that if you have a game in .iso format, use wfbs manager to install it to your hdd, because it will compress the iso to a smaller wbfs format. so in short, for .wbfs games, use wii backup manager, for .iso games use wbfs manager."
