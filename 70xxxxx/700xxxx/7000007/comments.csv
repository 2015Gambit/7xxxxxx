,Hitech411,2012-03-16T06:50Z,Puts words 'AVS Demo' in audio from ripping a CD. It does convert files okay though.

,TyMod,2012-04-18T03:04Z,"Yes. When I convert files already ripped to my computer it doesn't put that demo siht on my music.  When I try to rip from a CD it adds the ""AVS Demo"" crap to the beginning of the tracks.  

Everything else works great though.  Thanks and if you could get a fix much would be abliged."
