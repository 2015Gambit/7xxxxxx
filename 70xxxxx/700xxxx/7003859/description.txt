"A critical approach to reading and writing is expected from all students in health and social care courses. However, students often find this one of the more difficult aspects. This book sets about correcting the problem, and it does so in a step by step fashion by using relevant examples, learning activities and highlighting key information. It encourages readers to think and evaluate written material for themselves, and not to take every piece of literature as Gospel.

The book is very well written and laid out. It uses plain English and relies on very little on jargon, therefore making it very readable. I will definitely use it going into my course and would have no hesitation recommending it to course tutors and peers."
Conor Hamilton, Student Nurse, Queen's University Belfast, UK
