   Jai, an orphan, is taken in and nurtured   
   into a hard hitting ganster by Bhagwan .   
   When not busy kicking the hell out of      
   rival gangs, he quenches his lack of love  
   in his life by running a nursery with his  
   pal Chotu. Meanwhile, Jai runs into a      
   Greenpeace activist Sandhya and sparks     
   fly between the duo. When Munna, Bhagawan's
   son, batters Jhanavi to death, he is bet to
   near death by an enraged Jai and eventually
   Munna gets killed. Bhagawan is enraged and 
   is hell bent on revenge. An ultimate face- 
   off between loyalty and morals ensues.
