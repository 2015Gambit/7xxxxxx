,RadarB8,2012-02-17T21:22Z,"Does anyone have access to the controller mapping files on the website? Those are vital to integration of midi devices for ultimate usability.
A torrent with all of them packed would be splendid.
Or, simply a username/password combo txt file will do."
,yoman444,2012-02-19T13:10Z,"PROBLEM: Most of the effects in the pack provided dont work. They show up once you put thrm in the plugin folder, and they show up in the virtual dj program. But you cant click on them. Is there a fix to this problem?"
