,alltherowboats,2012-07-26T19:19Z,Have snuck up to 92.9% with a whole slew of other people. Anybody there to bump us to 100%?
,alltherowboats,2012-08-16T13:16Z,"Hi. I downloaded the Rar version of this torrent and figured out how to extract the files into avi. I then replaced the videos in the folder (this torrent) that was stuck at 92.9% so that everyone doesn't have to get stuck with rar files or an incomplete movie.

Can't wait to finally watch this movie after about a year waiting for somebody to seed!! I'll definitely be seeding btw."
