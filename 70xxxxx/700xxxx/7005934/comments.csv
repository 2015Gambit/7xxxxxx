i am a big fan of yours,.. but question,.. how can it be that you already have fridaynight smackdown, when its not fridaynight yet? i am from holland and i know that the usa is 8 hours behind the dutch. so could you explane this?
ohw and dont get me wrong,.. iÂ´m not complaining, just was wondering.

Keep up the good work!! "

@LeXeS75 WWE tapes SmackDown on Tuesday evenings and airs it on Friday evenings on Syfy the same week"
