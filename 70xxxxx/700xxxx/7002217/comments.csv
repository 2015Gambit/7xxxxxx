,Grost,2012-02-02T17:09Z,"Not working,
The reflector is connecting to the server, to make sure the serial you entered is working.
but it doesn't works, it gives the following message:

This serial number is not registered with the
activation server

Check the serial number that was sent to you with your invoice.

If you cannot find your serial number, you can retrieve it at:

[V],scene4all,2012-02-02T19:13Z,"NOTE: For obvious reasons you should always make sure that
the title is restricted access to internet by a firewall
to avoid any problems. Further, when running our
keygens/patches you might need to run it with admin
rights while in Vista/Win7 to ensure that it has
enough privileges."
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-02-02T21:52Z,"@Grost:

Also, you should disable the internet when trying to activate.
Choose offline activation method.

Copy the activation request code into the keygen.
Then copy the activation code the keygen generates, back into the activation window and click on activate.

Now you should be activated and you can turn the internet back on.

Works fine for me!"

,SpaceCadet6969754,2012-03-06T04:13Z,"Does this work? Yes. 
Is the Keygen a security risk? 
Hell yes, it tries to modify these files when you shut it down.
C:WINDOWSMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv2.0.50727configenterprisesec.config.cch.13756.3005198921
So you should block it in firewall or run it in sandbox.
Also, in the readme file, you could put how you must block its internet access, and do manual activation, and paste the code from that into the keygen.
Otherwise this is good thankyou."
