,arguablysane,2012-02-04T20:04Z,"[ettv] is NOT TO BE MISTAKEN for [eztv]

I've had several absolute shit rips from ettv, but they seem to be getting better now that they've been established for a while.

Anything I see with the eztv tag I know will be the best quality there is."
,Mielieman007,2012-02-05T15:32Z,What happened to eztv's uploads. I don't like the ettv uploads as they cutt the episodes short and on the big bang theory they cut out the theme song. I have searched on eztv's website but didn't see the Supernatural upload there.
,v9n9m,2012-02-09T02:46Z,need moar 720p!!
,markdbsilva,2012-02-12T03:05Z,Nice quality. tnx
