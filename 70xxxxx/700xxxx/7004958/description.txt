   Jimmy Dove works for the bomb squad in Boston              
   and he is always the one who is on the tough               
   jobs. One day he decides to quit the force and             
   to become a teacher for the rookies of the                 
   squad. A few days later his successor is killed            
   by a bomb and Jimmy becomes suspicious that maybe          
   this bomb could have been built by a former friend         
   of himself. He begins to investigate and finds out         
   that his worst nightmare has returned from his past.
