The software is able to determine whether it is running from a disc or mounted image, although it cannot tell the difference between a user-burned and original disk"

,usherd,2012-04-27T04:33Z,If its not supported on your architecture that means that your processor can't support it the only way around this is to either upgrade your cpu - which I wouldn't advise if you don't know what your doing - or buy a newer computer you can also try using rosetta stone 3 as version 4 doesn't really provide aany upgrades over 3 aside for the web based stuff which you can't use unless someone developes a workaround
