 A hockey enthusiast since 12 years of age,   
 Toronto-based Rajvinder Singh, even went     
 to the extent of trimming his hair,          
 discarding his Pagri/turban, did not         
 complete his education, incurred the wrath   
 of his father, Darvesh, who wanted him to    
 be involved in the family business as well   
 as confirm and respect Sikh religion         
 principles and values. Hoping to play        
 professional hockey, Rajvinder, along with

 himself treated as the object of ridicule,   
 referred to as a 'joker', by mainstream      
 Caucasian players. Even his friends tease    
 him and ask him to take up 'Guli Danda'      
 and Kabaddi', while his father makes him     
 work for Uncle Sammy as a truck driver. He
