            "Teacher's Pet" is a popular song written by Joe Lubin and published in 1957. The song was originally introduced in the movie of the same name by Doris Day, in 1958. Day's version was issued as a single. Also this song was performed by Frankie Avalon in 1957. Frankie was an American actor, singer, playwright, and former teen idol.As a teenager he played with Bobby Rydell in Rocco and the Saints.  Avalon had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including "Just Ask Your Heart" (U.S. #7), "I'll Wait For You" (U.S. #15), "Bobby Sox to Stockings" (U.S. #8), and "A Boy Without a Girl" (U.S. #10). Most of his hits were written and/or produced by Bob Marcucci, head of Chancellor Records.
        "Little Queenie" is a song written and performed by Chuck Berry. It was released as a double b-side with "Almost Grown" in 1959.        
        Following in the footsteps of his older brother, the legendary Frankie Lymon, Lewis Lymon also made an attempt at rock & roll stardom. And though his group, the Teenchords, never enjoyed the level of success achieved by Frankie's Teenagers, they still carved out a significant niche for themselves in the ranks of 1950s rock & roll vocal groups.The group consisted of Lewis Lymon (lead), Ralph Vaughan (first tenor), Rossilio Rocca (second tenor), Lyndon Harold (baritone), and David Little (bass).
