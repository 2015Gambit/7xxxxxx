,Sejo323,2012-03-25T12:38Z,"The game wont start
i extracted it to 
E:Program Files (x86)Command and Conquer Generals & Zero Hour - BlurayTorrent.com
because folder C-documents doesnt exist on windows 7 and i ran the bat file but it wont start
the load screen stands for a couple of seconds and the game crashes
no error msg just windows 7 tells me that it isnt responding"
