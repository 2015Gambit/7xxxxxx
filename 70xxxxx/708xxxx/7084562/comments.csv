,Grizraz,2012-03-08T16:58Z,"Hey Rapterman_123, if you have the JF DC-3 boxed version, the expansion pack is already included. You just have to manually add the additional liveries via editing the aircraft.cfg file. You could PM me, and I could simply e-mail you mine. Don't know if I could be of much help with the download version, however."
,Grizraz,2012-03-08T16:58Z,"Then again, if I could ever figure out how to upload the torrent, I could help, and bring the complete CLS MD-87, as well. I can never seem to make it work. "
