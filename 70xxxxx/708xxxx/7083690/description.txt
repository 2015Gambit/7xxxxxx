Silencer is a musical masterpiece from Sweden. He was hospitalized after the recording of Death, Pierce Me. He escaped from the psychiatric ward leaving a note saying "I will kill girls and be as famous as Thomas Quick". The band later disbanded after Nattramn (Lead vocalist) randomly ran up and attacked a 6 year old girl with an ax and attempting to commit suicide by cop by screaming "Kill Me!" to the police while holding the ax. The police caught him by sneaking up on him while attack dogs distracted him and was sent to a mental hospital. While in the mental hospital he was allowed to make music as a type of therapy. He was not allowed access to drums and guitars but he was allowed a synthesizer. He created a band called Diagnose: Lebensgefahr which is an atmospheric black metal band which will soon be uploaded by me.
