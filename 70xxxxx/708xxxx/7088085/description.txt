"Eye of the Storm"

A severe hurricane strikes Southern 
Florida, but torrential weather will not 
stop Walter from searching for a female 
high school student who went missing 
during the storm. While Walter is 
stranded on Looking Glass Key at the Ends 
of the Earth Bar, Isabel visits the 
missing girl's high school and uncovers 
clues that link her disappearance to foul 
play and a more serious and life 
threatening crime. Meanwhile, Willa's 
probation officer is stormed in with 
Walter, Leo and Willa, and puts her 
differences with Willa aside to help the 
team solve the case of the missing girl.
