Charley Chase is no ordinary girl; she may or may not possess a little magic. While catching up with an old friend, Charley's ex-nemsis (Keiran Lee) begins fluffing their pillows; generally being a nice guy. When questioned, Charley admits to putting a spell on Keiran to make him more hospitable. But has the spell gone too far? Apparently, giving in to Keiran's advances is the only way to end it. Is that Charley's next move?
