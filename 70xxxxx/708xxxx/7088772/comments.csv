,zed1234,2012-03-10T00:29Z,"If you mean how to download, just click on ""GET THIS TORRENT"" and your bittorrent client should open. If it doesn't try to update it. If it still doesn't open then you probably have to use a diferent program.

If you mean the file that you are downloading, then you need a program that reads .rar files (like winrar). You just have to extract one file and then all the files should extract at once.

@sceneline Thanks a lot ;)"

By the way, if anyone have problems with the video format, you can just play it with VLC (and maybe Media Player Classic, but this last one is not working for me)."
