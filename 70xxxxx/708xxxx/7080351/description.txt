Details:

To coincide with the 2nd December UK cinematic release of HUGO, Martin Scorsese's christmas blockbuster, Harmonia Mundi is proud to announce the signing of the Howe Records label, devoted to the soundtracks of cinema composer par excellence Howard Shore. 

Academy Award-winning composer Howard Shore's Original Score for HUGO marks his 5th collaboration with acclaimed director Martin Scorsese. HUGO, based on Brian Selznick's award-winning children's book, tells the story of an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station and is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton. Hugo Cabret is an inventive boy with the ability to change people for the better. But in order to change himself and find a place he calls home, he must first solve this decades-old mystery. 

Shore's sweeping orchestral score transports the listener to 1930's Paris, to jazzy cafes, and is as multi-dimensional as the picture.
