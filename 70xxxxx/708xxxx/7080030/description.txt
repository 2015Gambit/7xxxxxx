Another White Summer (1993)






'Another White Summer',  is a popular Led Zeppelin bootleg that has been available unofficially for some time in various formats . The band's performance featured on this disc is 'tight' and sounds as 'fresh' today, as it did all those decades ago. If Led Zeppelin were a new band in today's music scene they would still arrive and dominate with the same force and impact as they did in 1968 because quality and style of such dimensions and scope are not restricted or stiffled by the era in which it appears. Talent, like water always finds a way through the cracks.
