Description
SparkyLinux is a distribution created on Debian stable branch with e17 window manager by Linuxiarze.pl team. The project has been moved from ue17r (Ubuntu Enlightenment17 Remix) and is not longer based on it. It's still under development so be careful using our distro.

SparkyLinux 1.0 rc 'venus' PL
SparkyLinux PL

At the same time with the English-language version released SparkyLinux the default location and layout of the keyboard, 'PL'. The system was up spolszczony, so the installation does not require configuration language. If you want to install SparkyLinux another location and / or different keyboard layout I recommend the English version.
