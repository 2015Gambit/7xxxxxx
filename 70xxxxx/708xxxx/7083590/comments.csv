First, the win_x86 folder is as win x86 in the patch. 

Put the lang_1033.dll to the correct folder, unlike the patch.

Second, that ""to my documents"" mod you have to put into documents > German truck simulator, and not just copy paste so it would be Game Truck simulator or you'll have no english option at in-game options and ui would be missing icons"
