Review: "I never thought coming into the mid year of 2010 IΓÇÖd be hit with such an inaccessible album, blending unlovely amounts of noise with screamo, heavy requests of shoegaze, and even throw in a little punk and youΓÇÖve got yourself the The MenΓÇÖs Immaculada. Each song begs to be ignored within the opening seconds; inaudible screams litter across distorted feedback with little hints of a clever rhythm section. Take Grave Desecration for example which has so many elements riding with it you could throw a dart at a genre board and come away a winner. The band know how to work their blending of styles with sexy transitions that seamlessly weave their way in-between tracks, like the acoustic outro that graces the end of the aforementioned song; itΓÇÖs a curve ball thrown at the listener after the two minute tirade that precedes it, still the moment has never felt so perfect."
