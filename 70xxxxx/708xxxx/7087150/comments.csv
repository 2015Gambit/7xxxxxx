,DeJohnnie,2012-03-13T14:36Z,"@QborT... I just red in the paper about the rights being sold to UsA (also UK/IRE).
They expect it to hit theaters at the end of this year, so I'm guessing thats the reason there are no english subs included (nor made < correct me if I'm wrong).
When the dvd/bluray releases in the states, it probably be after theater-release xD...

Hope this helps out and maybe someone at subscene or whatever (or me, maybe) will do some work and get the english sub out there for the whole world to enjoy =d"
,QborT,2012-03-13T17:46Z,DeJohnnie thanks for the heads up.
