[V],Nepotu,2012-03-09T00:38Z,"Someones wants only 720p. Someones, like you, my friend, wants only 540p. Then, what I have to do? I'll do what the rippers want, like always. Thanks to them now we have NBA games (720p, 540p, 504p, 360p or whatever) So, enjoy it, whatever..."
,ACA652,2012-03-09T14:09Z,"I like 720p too,but i don't see the difference  between 720p and 540p,of course 720p is better video of 540p,but not too much.I mean 360p is really bad.So you post 720 and 520p and everybody will be happy :D"
[V],Nepotu,2012-03-09T14:37Z,"I understand you and you have right, my friend, but I'm not the ripper of these games. I'm only the uploader. What I find is what you get. Cheers, mate!"
