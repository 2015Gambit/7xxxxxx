@Annoyme -


Shouldn't it be ""Podcast on loan from Gawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwd-AH!""?

Gotta get that ""preacher-voice"" in there!!

To tell you the truth, I honestly get really nervous when Rush says G_d's name like that. because we're not supposed to take G_d's name in vain like that.

Yes, Rush does have talent - no disputing that, but still... I wish he didn't do that. 

(That's just my two cents btw, not meant to provoke an arguement!)"
