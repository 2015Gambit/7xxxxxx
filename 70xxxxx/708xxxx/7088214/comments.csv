""i know it's the 21st century""

No, you obviously don't.

First of all x264 is not a file format, its a file container/codec. It looks a thousand times better on big screens than anything you will find in an .avi container, has a higher bitrate, hd support, multicore support, streaming support and its about 1/3 smaller in filesize.

If your phone/tablet is the only device you have that can play x264 this means that they are the only 21st century tech you own, or you are simply too lazy to figure out how to hook up your Computer to a TV - theres a million ways to do that.


The .AVI Container was implemented in Fucking 1992 with Fucking Windows 3.1 !

You complaining that you can't play x264 is the equivalent of complaining that your VHS doesn't play BluRay."

first off You can't stream mp4 from your pc through xbox.

secondly your a prime example of the douchebaggery on this website and why people just need to ignore things and shut the fuck up."

""first off You can't stream mp4 from your pc through xbox""

First of all you don't stream stuff THROUGH, you stream stuff TO.

Do you also complain that your Xbox doesn't play BluRay? How is it the uploaders fault or x264's that your device is shitty and outdated?
Or that you are too stupid or lazy to find a workaround for that?
Most ass cheap 40$ BLuRay players play x264.
You can build or buy a used PC with HDMI and 7.1 Sound for max 75$.

""a prime example of the douchebaggery""

Really? You technical incompetent baffoons whom just figured out in 2012 how install a torrent client come here and demand from uploaders, who put their great work up for free, to go back to an inferior technology just so it fits the the needs of your outdated crap hardware  or your simplemindedness when it comes to technical things?

And I am the douchebag here?

You shut the fuck up. Go ride your horse carriage and play with the other amish.

,felix89,2012-03-09T23:23Z,"Not sure if something is off with this file or if it's just me, but it's displaying kinda smashed vertically for me. I don't normally have trouble with this file type, as I have watched entire series' of other shows using the same video formats and containers. Then again, kmplayer sometimes just likes to fuck with me."

wow. you are a douchebag.  So explain to me why ASAP releases won't stream TO my xbox, but all of MOMENTUM's new mp4 releases play just fine?  ASAP is doing something different and it is fucking up the playback.  No reason to be such a dick to everyone."

Thanks eztv....must love Archer! -_-"

You don't get it, do you? Nobody gives a crap about your XBox.
It doesnt stream to my ps3 either, hell the goddmn thing doesnt play x264 - but I dont complain to the uploader about it. 
Every half way decent laptop that came out in the last 5 Years has a HDMI or at least a VGA output. No problem getting it on your TV. And if all fails - there are still converter apps you know - takes about 5 minutes and you got your shitty .AVI container...
Beside the gazillion other ways you can get it on your tv - But nooooo, that would mean that YOU have to do some research, maybe even google a thing or two, i.e. you would have to use your brain - and nobody can ask you to do such a awful thing, right? So lets just complain to the uploader about it, its easier.

This file is perfectly fine. If you don't like it don't dl it - it's free!

I'm not a douchebag to everyone - just to you fucking millenial kids whom run arround with an extremly arrogant attitude of entitlement to everything and the demand that everybody has to please their stupid needs.
These files dont rip/convert/torrent-upload themself you know - there are people putting work into this - and all you assholes have nothing better to do than complain that your 10year old toaster can't play the file...

Well, thank you! I rather be a cunt with at least a glimpse about how the things that I use work than the nicest guy in thw world whos too stupid to tie his shoe laces and instead of learning how to do it writes a complaint to Nike cause his shoelaces don't tie themself."

,vapov,2012-03-14T09:01Z,+1 for the smaller file size. Good work as usual eztv
,brinn1,2012-03-15T21:43Z,"I really don't understand the rudeness of your answers. Alot of us are not that well versed and looking for answers. There are probably large age differences as well. I'm 62 years old and a pediatrician (I take care of kids maybe 40 per day) and if they talked to others the way these threads go, they'd be told they were behaving in an unacceptable manner. I suggest that the bunch of cursing all- knowing children answering questions try to be helpful without being so obnoxious and begin caring how the other person feels. That said, I have the same problem with streaming from my computer with only ASAP.MP64 torrents and other MP 64 torrents work great. With Miro I do have the ability to covert the torrents to their MP64 and they work great but coversion takes longer than 5 mins that some (kid?) suggested. I'd rather not have to do it. I too use my xbox which is hard wired into my router with my network for internet etc. I'm assuming that ASAP does something to the torrents which makes them not streamable to many devices. I certainly know I could stream without xbox but perfer it as I use mezzmo as well and the whole system works great.

I would welcome any helpful information but would rather the rude know-it-alls just don't answer. I could ask you all some medical questions and test your diagnostic powers but expect you'd fail as badly as you accuse others when they ask the technical stuff. GROW UP"
,silentrob421,2012-03-21T11:39Z,"Have to agree with Brinn1 on this one.  No need to be a jerk about it.  I use my xbox to stream video for my wife while I am gaming, or else I would just view it on the tv with the HDMI connection.  Although I won't get this torrent, I do appreciate the work eztv has done for quite some time.  Thank you eztv!"
,Sinsults,2012-04-08T21:58Z,"@brinn1
I agree with a lot of what you said, but:
If you're looking for help, the comments section is not the best place to be asking.  In fact, I would have to say that only a complete idiot would ask for help in the comments section of a torrent, because they are just asking to be trolled. In that sense, I agree more with xIKIoIZIx because complete idiots irritate the fuck out of me too.  If you're not well versed on something, asking for information about it on a torrent comment section is not ignorant, it's stupid."
