Many of the lost souls of Ossos and In VandaΓÇÖs Room return in the spectral landscape of Colossal Youth, which brings to Pedro CostaΓÇÖs Fontainhas films a new theatrical, tragic grandeur. This time, Costa focuses on Ventura, an elderly immigrant from Cape Verde living in a low-cost housing complex in Lisbon, who has been abandoned by his wife and spends his days visiting his neighbors, whom he considers his ΓÇ£children.ΓÇ¥ What results is a form of ghost story, a tale of derelict, dispossessed people living in the past and present at the same time, filmed by Costa with empathy and startling radiance.
