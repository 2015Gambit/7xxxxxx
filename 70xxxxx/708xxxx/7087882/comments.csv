,ben7530,2012-03-09T16:24Z,"Thanks BobnJeff!

One question: is this file CINAVIA protected? (I stream to a PS3 using ps media server; cinavia files      won't play properly...)

Everyone else, please consider including a ""Cinavia protected: Y/N"" line in the .nfo files for your releases! Thanks!"
[T],bobnjeff,2012-03-09T19:17Z,"well that's the first i have ever heard of that. I would imagine being i have never been asked about that problem and not knowing what it is, or something i would have to add when i encode which i don't & why would i..... i would say no. but i will look up latter tonight to see whats that about"
[T],bobnjeff,2012-03-09T19:26Z,"after looking at this nothing i do or ever do will have this in it

I would love it if you could use your valuable time to give the tutorial step by step with how to rip a blu ray because I want to rip some of my movies into the hard drive in your method. If you rather not then I understand. Otherwise, awesome job and keep it up."

,inkyon,2012-03-12T22:21Z,I haven't heard anything from you regarding to the request I have
,trask42,2012-03-13T21:52Z,"Problems - the file showed up as ""corrupt"" at 99 percent downloaded. When I completed the download, it wouldn't play past the MGM Lion. It could be my computer. VLC, I've noticed, HATES mkv files past a certain size range. So, I tried it with Quicktime and it plays a little into the MGM Lion but glitches out and the file just stops entirely. Good try, man, but I'll get the movie from elsewhere. :( May work for some people but doesn't work for me."
,MikeyMetal,2012-05-24T11:52Z,Any chance of this in 1080i?
