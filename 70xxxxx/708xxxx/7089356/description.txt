An inksetter in New York, Quoyle returns to his family's longtime home, a 
small fishing town in Newfoundland, with his young daughter, after a traumatizing 
experience with her mother, Petal, who sold her to an illegal adoption agency. 
Though Quoyle has had little success thus far in life, his shipping news column 
in the newspaper "The Gammy Bird" finds an audience, and his experiences in 
the town change his life. Then he meets the widow Wavey.
