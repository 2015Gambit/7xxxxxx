,FlyingT,2012-03-06T03:08Z,Does anyone know the difference between the 13GB and 10GB torrents floating around? If I had to guess the 10GB versions have the art book/OST/comic/etc cut while the 13GB does not.
,FlyingT,2012-03-06T03:17Z,"Well apparently my comment got deleted, but does anyone know the difference between the 13 and 10GB versions floating around?"
,toxia,2012-03-06T03:41Z,"Anyone else having trouble downloading this? I have 1/55 seeds connected....is it because of so many leechers or something? Haven't ran into this problem before, thanks."
,masterac,2012-03-06T03:42Z,"you people should stop asking for FUCKING DLC!!!! you want it ?BUY THE GAME,your getting it for free so STFU.

my reasons are different,i did buy mass effect 2, the collector blablabla edition, but...the armor and other stuff were just a bunch of ugly pixel,every update of the game cause it to ask for a DVD in the drive, but its a digital version, so this is my punishement for bioware+penalty."
,masterac,2012-03-06T03:44Z,"and haveyou played the demo ? sheppard suit is just HORRIBLE compare to his face (low res vs high res for the face), wtf with that ? its the main charactere."

your not a pirate, this term doesnt apply to you.

,bleitwijf,2012-03-06T05:03Z,@FatHooker does not really help if there is 2407 leechers and only 559 seeders ... so yeah wait a few days and u will get decent download

,Airduinec,2012-03-06T05:13Z,"I'm getting the 'Element Not Found' error as well, so I'm not sure what's up with that.

Can anyone confirm the crack works and the game is playable? 547 seeders and no confirmation."
,heretic2,2012-03-06T05:15Z,Idk if its this magnet download thing or what but this torrent is not working well at all. Uploading plenty but it can't connect to even one seeder.
,heretic2,2012-03-06T05:16Z,Just way too many leechers I guess :(
,FatHooker,2012-03-06T05:21Z,"@samhell44 
1. I don't have a Walmart internet lol... 3-5kb/s is dial-up speed and no one on this world has that shit anymore, except maybe a few people who live in the middle of nowhere. Why would a dial-up person would Torrent in the first place? Think about it, you tool. They wouldn't!
2. You're a little bitch/troll, I agree with Masterac. No one wants a little bitch troll around, so you gtfo. 
3. If you clearly read... You'll blatantly see that I'm not the only one suffering from a horrible DL speed. Again, just a case of a troll being a little bitch, so stfu & gtfo, you dolt."

,heretic2,2012-03-06T07:06Z,@azza3211: B/c there are too many ppl who dont know what they are doing. Plus a shit ton of leechers.
,rawtoni,2012-03-06T07:07Z,"@azza3211 
im dloading it with 10kb/s so consider urself lucky"
,Cobain67,2012-03-06T07:25Z,"Wow, I'm getting sick of all of these generic ""Stop leeching and seed"" comments.  How retarded can these people be? A leecher is someone who is downloading the file from the seeders.  The seeders have 100% of the file.  So, basic logic tells us that a leecher can't start seeding a file that he doesn't have 100% of, can he?  The seeders have only so much bandwidth and it is spread evenly through the leechers.  This is also, more or less, a first come first serve basis.  With almost 10 times the amount of leechers than seeders, the available bandwidth is spread very thin.  Before you retards creat an account and start jumping down the leechers throats, do a little reasearch and find out what a leecher is and find out how torrents work, otherwise you just run the risk of making yourself sound even more retarded.

@azza3211
Probably the biggest reason is because movies are a fraction of the size of games.  The leechers get done downloading faster and are able to start seeding much sooner with a 700MB-1.4GB file than with 13GB.  Download speed is also reliant on the seeder's upload speed, which varies from person to person.  On this particular torrent, I was getting between 20 and 40 kb/s, but on EZ's I'm getting 1 MB, so I stopped this one."
,azza3211,2012-03-06T08:48Z,"@Cobain, thankyou for clearing that up. And also, well said"
,digitaldictatorship,2012-03-06T08:48Z,"Just keep uploading and stop whining.
As soon as I have the files, I will upload with a total of 6MB/s for a couple of days.

And @all you whiners
If someone has te download complete, he turns from leecher to seeder. You are all leechers, and once you have the files, you stop the download permanent. So please seed it yourself too.
Otherwise everyone gets diarrea."
,lmaraka,2012-03-06T09:09Z,i have clone dvd with russian language changed language according to the instructions but there is something weird its really hard to hear voices even on full volume and its fucked up without voices. is there any way to fix this problem. please let me know

,AlanGrantious,2012-03-06T10:54Z,"Copy and pasted from another torrent.

Ok ladies, I'm assuming this is the same torrent [the important parts] as the other reloaded ones.

[I downloaded ths is torrent, so I know it works]

So here's what you do.

1 - Mount/Burn the DVD image.
2 - Click on OriginInstaller.[Don't worry, it's not Origin, it's something RELOADED made]
3 - Install.
4 - Once installed go to the directory. me3/Binaries/win32
5 - Remove the EXE.
6 - Goto crack folder on dvd and copy/paste to Binaries/win32
7 - Create shortcut, and stick it on your desktop.
8 - Play the game.

I'm in a land where this game isn't out till Friday, and I got it working. It's that simple."

@Cobain67 et al. tards, Google harder. That's not how seeding works. Your misunderstanding is why you're downloading so slow. "

,Cobain67,2012-03-06T22:06Z,"Ok dewsaqed, then tell me, why was I getting 1.5 MB/s average on EZs torrent?  I started this one first and let it run for an hour and was at 1.3%, then decided to try another one so started EZs and right away it went up to 1.2 MB/s and never went below 800 kb/s.  So, I stopped this one and downloaded his in a little under 2 hours.  AND, his had WAY more leechers than seeders, almost 20 times.  Please, enlighten me with how this stuff works.  I'm sure you have 8 years of IT under your belt."

,Ezilkannan,2012-04-01T11:29Z,"@Cobain67 Dude, you have misunderstood the concept of leechers and seeders just like most of the other ppl. A leecher is not the guy who is downloading the file, a leecher is someone who takes everything but gives very little to nothing in return for example a share ratio of 1.00. A seeder is someone who gives more than he takes. A person downloading a file is simplly referred to as a peer. You can be a peer, but you are not supposed to be a leecher. Leechers modify their clients to limit their upoloading rates. A peer always gives back equal share of what he takes."
,TaleMunja,2012-05-18T12:14Z,"Just want to thank uploader and to confirm that game works nicely. I used Origin installer and cracked it without any problem. When i go in game ask me to make origin acount-i press ""Cancel"" and that's it; Single player is cool, Action mode is awesome(i don't like story soap opera).

 Once again BIG thanx! I will seed long time."

,Fantomnz,2012-07-26T07:18Z,"Steps for importing a ME1 save
------------------------------

1) Run the Mass Effect 2 configuration utility from the main launcher. Which is found here:-
   C:/Program File/Mass Effect 2/Binaries/MassEffect2Config.exe
2) Click the 'Save Games' button.
3) Click the 'Copy Mass Effect 1 Save Games' button,and select the appropriate location for your ME1 save game. 
(The default location is 'My Documents/bioware/Mass Effect/Save'.)
4) This will copy the appropriate save games from your ME1 directory into the proper place in the ME2 directory.
5) Run Mass Effect 2, and from the main menu select 'New Game'.
6) Select 'Import ME1 Character'.
7) Your savegame should now show up in the list.


If your ME2 game is in the same directory then your ME2 saves will show in ME3.

Hope that helps :)

,GgsterM,2012-08-06T22:02Z,"I've got a problem!!

So I installed the game and everything went fine, but since the second time I've played, a message that ""Mass Effect 3(TM) has stopped working"" keeps bumping up on the screen randomly. Sometimes I can play for an hour, other times every 5 minutes the game is closed.

Has anybody else experienced this? If somebody could help me, I would appreciate it very much."
