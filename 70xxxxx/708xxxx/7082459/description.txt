FIVE The Nazi Titanic - Revealed
6.March 2012

The bizarre story of a forgotten propaganda film made
by the Nazis about the sinking of the Titanic.

Made at the height of World War II, this film was
conceived as the ultimate propaganda movie with the
famous disaster recast as a story of Allied weakness
and German courage. At the time it was one of the most
expensive and ambitious movies ever filmed. The story
of its creation rivals a Hollywood movie script with
tales of betrayal, murder and massacre. It featured
military personnel moved from the front to act as extras,
the director was arrested and possibly executed on the
orders of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels and, in
the last days of the war, the ship used for the filming
was sank, as the Nazis tried to cover up the horrors of
the Holocaust.

For 60 years, the film was shrouded in secrecy. Now, using
GoebbelsΓÇÖs private diaries, unseen home-movies shot
behind-the-scenes during the production and the original
production design book, we reveal for the first time the
extraordinary story of the Nazi Titanic.
