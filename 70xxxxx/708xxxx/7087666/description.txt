                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 Sprinter Dwain Chambers is currently barred from being selected for the London 2012 
 Olympics because of a previous ban for using performance-enhancing drugs, but a court 
 case next week might force the British Olympic Association to consider him for 
 selection. Current and former Olympians including Sharron Davies, Kriss Akabusi, Greg 
 Searle and Kim Collins give their views, and Chambers reveals his regret for his 
 actions and shows how he is trying to put things right.
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
