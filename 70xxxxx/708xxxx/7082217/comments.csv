,Aaron8001,2012-03-12T02:17Z,"well its at least working, had to turn in-game settings way down for it not to be ridiculously choppy. 

i've been a 1.6 player for a long time, and was never a fan of source. I like what i see so far with CS:GO and i cant wait to see more!"
,IckyWeed,2012-03-13T14:51Z,"I have no idea how to install this. I tried what it said, but the .ovf file won't show up in the CS folder. There's nothing in it when I open it. And i did change the open thingy to ""Open virtual machine format images"". Can someone please help me asap? I really wanna try this!"
,alvine,2012-03-21T23:32Z,"ok I have registered just to comment on this
I have been playing since cs 1.6, i own css, and I could not wait to download this beta (im gonna buy the cssgo anyway)
so I have downloaded the torrent..I'm not greated with a normal iso like I was expecting...ok whatever  so i follow the instructions and install virtual mashine shit (WHY I JUST WANT THE GAME I DONT WANT YOUR FUCKING RUSSIAN XP)
the game doesnt even work in the virtual mashine
i copied and pasted it to my desktop and this shit isnt working ( seriously why the FUCK do you put a game within a virtual machine...just give us the fucking game GOD DAMN)
waste of my bandwidth and time I have torrented many games in the past and this gave me the hardest time ever this is shit
again fuck you for posting a bad quality torrent and wasting my time. "
,MNeXuSK,2012-03-28T11:47Z,"@ alvine 
your an idiot the game is in virtual machine because this is the only way it will work. you need to download csgo on steam on your pc(maybe a friends acc) then runn the game on its own. Just to confirm the game works on the beta it is in russian. copying the files to you computer will not work. the virtual machine version works because you have his steam info ect ect init. if some1 can boot up with that xp then it may work. not gna wast my time only offline works.
thanks for the upp but its a pain! lol"
,SarethW,2012-04-04T09:43Z,"When I started extracting the files it said something about corrupted or something, and now the whole VM Virtual Machine thing doesn't work

Worked for me :)"
,imtheking,2012-04-08T11:30Z,"Installing the game:
1) Install VMware Workstation v8.0.1 Full;
2) Exract the RAR file in CS folder, thr u ll find CSGOBeta.ovf file
3) Run VMware, in the ""File"" menu - ""Open"" to select ""Open image format for virtual machines"" and import the folder Image  CSGOBeta.ovf.
4) Start the game with a shortcut on the desktop virtual machine."
