,joejoe3x,2012-03-20T05:07Z,"false positive my butt. this is a rootkit known as serefef, a dangerous virus that replaces critical system files until an inevitable crash. very difficult to get rid of. not impossible though. better luck next time, jerk. "
[T],Tom_Da_Man,2012-03-21T14:46Z,"Plz, get educated be4 you comment..."
,joejoe3x,2012-03-21T18:28Z,"please get a life and/or girlfriend. only losers sit around giggling to themselves because they put a virus on someone's computer. and i am quite educated in the matter. kinda had to do my research considering you infected my computer with your shit torrent. it started deleting my files and i had to reinstall my op system because while i could get at the system files being corrupted i could not get at the infection itself. pain in the ass, but like i said difficult but not impossible to get rid of.
