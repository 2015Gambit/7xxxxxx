Corrosion: Cold Winter Waiting is a dark, shocking, and fear charged mystery horror game, that casts the player in the role of Sheriff Alex Truman as he attempts to piece together the origins of a disturbed and unidentified car crash victim.

Set entirely underneath an idyllic country farmhouse, in the deserted and claustrophobic confines of a mysterious and secret underground complex, players will explore a place nobody knew existed, and uncover a twisted past that gets more and more terrifying with every corner turned, every door opened, and every note read.

What happened beneath Cold Winter Farm? What does it have to do with the stranger, who survived a terrible crash, only to sit and mutter the farm's name? And if the place is supposed to be deserted, what do you keep seeing out of the corner of your eye?
