,OmniusPrime,2012-03-09T17:05Z,Any chance of getting a full-size version of this? For 3DTVs ...
,OmniusPrime,2012-03-09T21:01Z,"OK, DLing it now - though I'd wager a side-by-side test would show a detectable difference between a QHD upconvert and a full HD. But then who has two 70"" 3DTVs side by side? 8^)"

,BloodKil_,2012-08-27T21:10Z,"What a stupid site (sick-flix)

Basically to DL anything you have to pay for their VIP service (unless trailers and clips of movies are enough to entertain you)

Nice spam post of a single move here..."
