Luis Ospina and Carlos Mayolo, Agarrando Pueblo (The Vampires of Poverty), still, 1978.
A minor take on history (on marginality and the city)
Colombian filmmaker Luis Ospina has been directing films for over 40 years. 
His documentary work has focused on the exploration of the genre as a subjective one in which fiction and non-fiction intermingle. 
Since studying film in UCLA, Ospina started collaborating with Carlos Mayolo. They were part of a new generation of young artists, filmmakers, photographers, and writers working in Cali in the 1970s who were keen to challenge established forms of communication which remained unquestioned, at least locally. 
The city in general, and Cali in particular, became the subject of enquiry. 
The manifestation of its changes, its informal and unrestrained growth, its social composition and decomposition were taken as themes which triggered new cinematographic, photographic and literary languages.
