EPISODE SUMMARY                                                
  Clarence Montgomery, the only innocent man in Alcatraz, returns to
  present day, but is nows committing crimes. Why?                                              
                                                   
RIP  NOTES                             
  There were a couple of complaints about the initial release     
  but the reasons were not made clear and the symptoms really  
  odd. On the chance it was an issue with packed bitstream it  
  was redone without packed bitstream.
