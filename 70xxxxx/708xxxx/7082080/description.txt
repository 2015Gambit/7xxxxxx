The Royal Marines of 42 Commando prepare to return back to the UK after their six-month deployment to one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan. Out of 100 men, seven marines were killed in action and over 50 suffered life-changing injuries. Among the wounded are Simon Maxwell, Mick McConnell and Paul Vice ΓÇô all victims of IED blasts. The military mission they were part of was deemed a great success, but their lives will never be the same again.
