,Sugar_Skull,2012-03-10T01:33Z,"Not really into Stone Sour...I've got some Static-X but nothing Rare, I'll look into to it but I'm busy with school and kids. next thing I'm gonna do is Limp Bizkit oddities after they release the next single"
,TorelloTheHallowed,2012-03-25T04:57Z,"great collection, but i think u should add the live piano version of him covering ""The Alabama Song"" by The Doors =)"
,TorelloTheHallowed,2012-03-25T04:59Z,"oh and ""Apple of Sodom"" =)"
,Sugar_Skull,2012-03-27T15:11Z,Ya i forgot apple of Sodom! but I don't have the alabama song cover if you've got it please upload!
,TorelloTheHallowed,2012-03-29T02:20Z,"will do, the only copies around are live versions but with impeccable quality. ive been a leecher for sometime, recently registered but i am uploading that song now.....time to become a seeder xD"
