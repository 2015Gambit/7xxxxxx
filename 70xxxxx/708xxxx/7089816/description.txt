Album: Marilyn Manson-Oddities


Artist: Marilyn Manson And Various Artists


Description:


A collection of rare songs,covers,B-sides,and remixes, I've included a home made album cover. Just for fun. I've also Included some Brand New Manson Tracks From the Upcoming album "Born Villain". On a Side Note I had trouble with some of these labels as far as file details but all the proper info in included in the song title so maybe you can straighten that out. Also the sound quality varies because I pulled these from different sources Most stuff is pretty good quality though shouldn't be an issue. I have lots of rare music I love doing Compilations so if you have any Suggestions let me know.
