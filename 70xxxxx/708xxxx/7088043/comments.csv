alucard15, your isp is most likley throttling / blocking the bt protocol, google ""vpn"", i use relakks vpn service and its restored my downloading speeds to max."
,gcgb53191,2012-03-10T00:42Z,Is there something I can download so I can play these new mp4 whatever it is thats been coming out lately. Sorry don't know much about computers but Im getting irrtiated that I cant watch this show lately !
,qwertzo99,2012-03-10T00:52Z,"Why can't I download the torrent? All I see is ""GET THIS TORRENT"" but clicking on it does nothing. I'm using Transmission torrent client and it worked perfectly for years. "
,PrincePwn,2012-03-10T01:00Z,"Download Klite codec pack or VLC Media Player < what i use, to play every single movie format. Also, thse magnet files don't download for me, I must copy the ""Get this torrent"" magnet link and paste it in uTorrent as ""Add URL"". I'm not a magnet fan... I understand the reason for the change but until clients get updated it's gonna be a pain."
,zecathos,2012-03-10T01:16Z,"When I tried to use magnet link for the first time, I accidentally pressed something that my computer is not allowed to open magnet links anymore, and of course I checked ""remember this option"". Any way to remove this? Haven't been able to download torrents from TPB ever since, as they removed other ways to download torrents but magnet links."
,we_r_nd,2012-03-10T03:01Z,"Where are the avi file copies of things??  I know others are more compact, but I prefer the 175mb / 350mb avi shows over random mp4."
,we_r_nd,2012-03-10T03:36Z,"You too eztv??? VTV, TvTeam and others dependables are all going to the annoying mkv or mp4!!!! Stick to the 175 / 220 / 350 mb AVI format for tv shows, it plays on everything!!

ettv is the only guy putting them up it seems. "

,Remorthy,2012-03-10T18:09Z,good work as always.
,samy007,2012-03-10T21:33Z,"Thanks, great quality as always ! 
(The show is getting worse every week though...)

To those having problems with magnet links, I recommend the BitComet client: very easy to use, to configure, and it automatically loads every file trees from a torrent with more than one file. So that you can select wich files to download, one by one, or everything at once.

I still use BitTorrent when I can download the .torrent file, but I only use BitComet for direct magnet links.
Note that you don't have to bookmark every magnet from your web browser, BitComet allows you to store the magnet links inside the program if you want to use it more than once !"
,hca717,2012-03-10T21:41Z,"thanks extv
and good wok with making .mp4 files 
they have smaller size in the same old quality !!"
,e3poso,2012-03-10T21:59Z,"Anyone that thinks you're ""saving"" space by the smaller .mp4 files is retarded. You save 25 mb/file.... Ooooo so stupid. the new container is annoying and just catering to the retards that own apple stuff. Go back to sniffing your own farts and give us the format we know and love"
,Snoffle,2012-03-11T15:12Z,"god damn, just downloaded this in less then 10 seconds"
,gt900uk,2012-03-11T15:59Z,Does this play OK for everyone? The first week MP4 was out the files worked fine and those files still play OK. This week all the MP4's that i have downloaded just will not play at all on either of my PC's. Mediainfo doesnt seem to recognise them and VLC and splash wont play them. I am at a total loss. Have tried downloading them from different sources and just get the same result.
