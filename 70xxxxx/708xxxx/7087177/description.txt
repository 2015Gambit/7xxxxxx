Two years ago Simon King made Cheetahs ? Fast Track to Freedom, a film about his attempt to return two orphaned cheetah cubs to the wild. The film ended tragically with the cub Sambu being killed by lions, but his brother Toki survived.
Simon's new film follows the equally dramatic twists and turns of his continuing story.
