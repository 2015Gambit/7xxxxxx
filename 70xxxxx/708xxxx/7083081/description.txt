Source is german retail. I have checked for overlays during the main featurette and there wasn't any.

The casting does contain german words but as this does not affect the main show itself, i would hope common sense can be used.

Please feel free to watch and enjoy and if you have any concerns, i guess i will see them on some nukenet.

Big thanks to the guy who has the same aka as the main actor for his assistance.
