Nightraid, verry good looking vertical scrolling shooter,

i converted this fine and verry addictive psx game to an E-boot.PBP so you can play this on your PSP,

i tested the game on my PSP E-1004 with custom firmware 6.60 PRO B10...

for people who dont know what to do with this file:

unrar (extract) the file and hook up your PSP to your computer/laptop, then copy the map SLPM87048 to PSP/GAME on the memorystick of your PSP.

i should have: PSP/GAME/SLPM087048  

disconnect your PSP after copying and play the game.. 

Please let me know if the game is working fine or not and please let me know on what firmware this game is working for you so others know what they download...

thank u..

and please seed...
