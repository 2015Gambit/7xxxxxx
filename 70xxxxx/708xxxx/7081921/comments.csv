[V],catflap,2012-03-07T01:43Z,"this is not the special that was on in December 2010.

according to my epg, the bbc website, and the announcer at the
beginning of this file, it is a ""brand new drama"" series, so this is
episode 1 of 3 of the first series.

,cindy25,2012-03-07T02:12Z,"its considered episode 101

the pilot is consider episode 100

keep the avi coming, and please add more shows; converting these MP4 is annoying"
[V],catflap,2012-03-07T02:58Z,"when i have time, and if i think there might
be interest or need for something.

my own downloading always has priority."
[V],catflap,2012-03-08T02:21Z,"this series begins on BBC-HD on Monday 12.03.12.

i don't think i'll be recording it and i don't know if the scene or
anyone else is waiting for the HD broadcast, which might be
why i seem to be the only one around who posted a file of
this episode 1x01.

i don't need this to be in HD, but if the only file next week
is in crappy x264, i might do one. MAYBE."
[V],catflap,2012-03-08T02:23Z,"but episode 1x02 is on this same BBC 4 at the
same time on 12.032.12, so i probably won't
do an HD upload."
[V],catflap,2012-03-08T02:35Z,"sorry, 1x02 isn't at the same time as
the HD 1x01. it's on earlier but the
same night on BBC 4, which is where
this recording is from."
,neeliesu,2012-03-10T08:40Z,"@cindy25 ... hope you read this, I agree with you but don't know how to convert MP4, if you or anyone else has the time can you please tell me....Thanks :)"
[V],catflap,2012-03-10T13:41Z,"cindy, the easiest way I know, especially for people
like ourselves who don't have a lot of experience
with mp4 and mkv conversions and complicated
programs, is with Freemake Video Converter. I use it whenever i have an mp4, xvid, or mkv that that my dvd players or tv's media player refuses to play.

it's every easy and you'll soon gett he hang of it.
you can also email the developers and they
always answer emails.

good luck."
[V],catflap,2012-03-10T13:42Z,"sorry, i meant to also recommend it to neeliesu. :)"
,neeliesu,2012-03-10T16:52Z,"Thank you catflap, I've noticed lately more and more torrents are Matroska and X264, I can watch them on my computer with Media Classic Player, but I d/l so the family can watch together. We live abroad and the TV's not great andit's hard to follow 'cos it's not in English. Thanks again I'll do what you suggest... really grateful you took the bother :)"
[V],catflap,2012-03-10T18:06Z,"@neeliesu

the scene groups changed the rules and
now they release in mp4 and mkv, some
still put out xvid. check out user ettv who
usually has everything."
[V],catflap,2012-03-10T18:11Z,"that's ettv, NOT eztv. ;)"
,SYNAESTHES1A,2012-03-11T01:29Z,"I saw this on TV when it aired, but didn't think anyone was going to upload it. I'll nab it for now, though would prefer an HD version as I have the original pilot like that, so will still keep looking on the off-chance that someone uploads it after it's been aired.

Thanks a lot for your work though."
,neeliesu,2012-03-12T08:36Z,"@catflap...... Can't thank you enough, have now downloaded Freemake Video Converter, watched a tutorial, and converted an mvk file to AVI. Couldn't have done it without your help :)"
[V],catflap,2012-03-12T10:02Z,"that's great!

Freemake also has an audio converter,
a video downloader for youtube and
many other sites, and a music search
program.

have fun."
,doctord2,2012-03-13T07:24Z,"Catflap, THANK YOU and I hope you continue providing this show! "
