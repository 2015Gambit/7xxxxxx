,onallion,2012-03-07T00:27Z,"Fake, probably virus."

,premiado,2012-03-07T00:56Z,"To all the doubters, enjoy playing From Ashes with russian words then"
,premiado,2012-03-07T01:05Z,"You're able to choose english text from the in game options menu. Also, the scrolling text at the bottom of the in game main menu, no longer has russian words."

,sephiam,2012-03-07T02:03Z,"registered just to say that:

1. checked with AVG 2012 updated, no virus
2. its weird, the exe opened up my browser and went to a weird site BUT it worked and From Ashes dlc is now English.. so i guess that was a worthy little leap of faith i took there.

anyways, good luck
hope when i restart my comp doesn't die ^^"
,onallion,2012-03-07T02:15Z,"This is legit: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7082112/Mass_Effect_3_International_Language_Pack

*This* torrent is some Japanese trojan bullshit..."
,popieloze,2012-03-07T02:19Z,"Somebody seriously confirm that, I dont trust the uploader"
,premiado,2012-03-07T02:40Z,"yep it will bring up the browser to 3dm website, and its from the chinese not japanese"
,kaliver,2012-03-07T02:59Z,"it's a fix from the usual chinese sites, use it or don't. it fixed my game.  but feel free to listen to these pansies crying wolf if you like."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-03-07T03:47Z,This worked GREAT.  THANK YOU PREMIADO.
,Assyel,2012-03-07T06:28Z,"Registered to say it works. This activates language change ingame, so if you have CloneDVD version with RUS lang default you can change it now.

I turned off my router before I clicked the EXE file, just in case.

Seems legit"
,Ygdrad,2012-03-07T07:31Z,"I confirm that this worked and changed the dlc language from russian to english for me. It did try to open a web page though, but i made sure to disconnect from my network first."
,RealGoode,2012-03-07T08:23Z,for everyone saying this is a fake and a virus your full of shit just downloaded and followed instructions  and works perfectly thanks alot Premiado
,dlux69,2012-03-07T09:30Z,"FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE

CONFIRMED TROJAN

This download contains a fucking Trojan/Virus. DO NOT DOWNLOAD

This is the real deal (read comments): http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7082112/Mass_Effect_3_International_Language_Pack

FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE"
,premiado,2012-03-07T12:15Z,"it is people like dlux69 that makes me wonder, why did i bother to share stuffs with the community."
,Dufox,2012-03-07T15:25Z,"this is legit.

thank you so much for sharing this premiado.

to clear up why people are freaking and saying virus: 
1.inside the .rar is a .exe file that you place in your me3 folder.( .exe is always scary to most)
2. after you double click the .exe you get a notice box that you cant read ( always scary for most)
3. it takes you to a website. ( always scary)

if you know what a registry editor does, you will not freak out. but again this program does exactly what its supposed to do."
,kaliver,2012-03-07T16:43Z,"the website is just the 3dm site where they post these things. it's a little harmless self-promotion, though i can see why some would be wary of it."
,Javca,2012-03-07T22:34Z,"Ty very much for this Scanned with eset smart security 5 and no ""trojan"" found :) So it's not fake :). Greetings from croatia :)"
,Tiazi,2012-03-08T22:15Z,"I had english subtitles but russian subtitles in the DLC mission.

this fixed that for me.

clean & simple

thanks!"
,LadyIvory,2012-03-09T14:17Z,This is most def a trojan..do NOT download this..
,ruptawsky,2012-03-09T16:44Z,"Yes, it works! Thank you very much. I was  searching file like this for 2h. Now I have my own language in menu->extras->option. 
Działa. Teraz DLC jest po polsku, bo możesz zmienić jezyk w menu. Wystarczy, że wgrasz wczesniej paczkę z jezykami (dll, tlk). "
,premiado,2012-03-10T08:10Z,go fuck yourself ladyivory
,Damon163,2012-03-28T18:59Z,"This did not work for me, everything in the game is english except for the subtitles that are in russian. And I can't see a menu in options where I can change my language, only to turn on and off my subtitles. What should I do??? "
