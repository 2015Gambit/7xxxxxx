This compelling documentary explores an alternative theory to the "lone gunman" concept explaining President John F. Kennedy's assassination. The filmmakers posit that the President's own brother, Robert, may have inadvertently caused John's death. According to the video, a plot devised by Bobby Kennedy to slay Fidel Castro was subverted and then utilized to carry out the President's murder. The documentary even features an interview with an Army colonel who admits that he was ordered to get rid of witnesses to the assassination. It is also alleged that phony autopsy pictures were used to prove that Kennedy's death was caused by a single shooter.
