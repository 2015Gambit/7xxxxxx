,lonewolf1994,2012-03-06T21:36Z,which dlc does this unlock? just from ashes or even the N7 pack? also does the from ashes have english subs?
,D-Prophit,2012-03-06T21:47Z,"This may be a stupid question, but does this work with purchased versions of the game?"
,popieloze,2012-03-06T23:07Z,What is there to unrar? All I got is a cracked .exe. Doesn't seem to unlock anything in the RUS/ENG Digital Deluxe Edition.
,Medevila,2012-03-06T23:33Z,"@ D-Prophit, it should as long as you have already downloaded the DLCs and placed them where they belong."
,D-Prophit,2012-03-06T23:56Z,@Medevila I have from ashes downloaded. Thanks for the help. 
,GObonzo,2012-03-07T01:46Z,"file is the same size as RELOADED's OG crack. what's the difference? is this just for those using nonreloaded version? and instructions need fixing, says to unrar but is no .rar file. gonna confuse the retards"

,RRunner1,2012-03-07T15:55Z,Please! Can anyone explain if N7 WARFARE PACK  is unlocked in the game or not?
,callum92,2012-03-07T16:04Z,"If the game crashes for you after the you collect the data, find the other computer in the level
(there are two computers in the level that you need to collect data from) and collect that data first.
This should stop the game crashing."
,able1214,2012-03-07T16:22Z,"Confirmed. N7 Warfare Gear, Robotic Dog, N7 Hoodie are not cracked. Only Squad Alternative Appearance pack and From Ashes are cracked."

,narmishe,2012-03-07T16:53Z,"thanx @scene4all, 

@RRunner1it says DLC Unlocker at least read the title"
,RRunner1,2012-03-07T17:44Z,"@narmishe

Thanks for nothing Masters of the Obvious  .. Of  course that the title says DLC Unlocker, the question is what DlCs are unlocked! Deluxe edition has N7 WARFARE PACK  and i dont know if its unlock too, one more time thanks for nothing!"
,RRunner1,2012-03-07T17:53Z,"@narmishe
Thanks for nothing Masters of the Obvious! Of course the title says DLC Unlocker! The question is that it says:""This will unlock DLCs included with Mass Effect 3."" And Delluxe edition has N7 WARFARE PACK and its not said if its unlocked or not!

@able1214 

Thanks for the answer! Are you sure?"
,GObonzo,2012-03-07T18:27Z,"has no one uploaded DLCs alone?
all i see is game+DLC files which cannot be dloaded separate because some dumbasses .rar their ISOs andor put their .rar files into ISOs.
one or the other is all you need with torrents people, it's not like using WinMX or them back in the day."
,tkeys356,2012-03-07T19:56Z,Confirmed it works! Dont expect to get a N7 hoodie in the mail though

,dmmm123,2012-03-08T13:53Z,"IF I CAN GET EVERYONE'S ATTENTION PLEASE!

Are you stupid or something? This is day one DLC that was released which cut out a character that was originolly meant to be in the game but instead was released at an extra cost the day of release.

,Vicereine,2012-04-13T02:00Z,"Any hope for updating this to cover the new Resurgence DLC? I have a legit copy of the game, but I use the DLC unlocker because I didn't feel like giving Bioware 10 dollars to unlock something that was already on the disc. 
I get this when I open the game with the crack now:
""The following downloadable content cannot be used, as required patch is missing. Please install the latest patch and try again. 
Resurgence Multiplayer Expansion""

Not a big deal since technically I could switch between exe's if I want to play MP or SP, but it would be less of a hassle. Plus, it'd be nice to be able to mod the new weapons into SP without losing Javik.
Thanks."
,OniPT,2012-04-16T16:33Z,"Vicereine, it has been working fine for you? Won't Bioware/EA find it out & block the access to Multiplayer? Cuz I'm planning to buy the game, but DLC make me feel quite ripped off, specially when they are already in the disk."
