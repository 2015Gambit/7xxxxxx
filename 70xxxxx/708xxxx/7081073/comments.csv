I AM seeding it, I just haven't connected to anyone yet for some reason, I don't know why.
And I'm going to keep seeding this torrent when I'm able to. So if there are no seeds, just wait and I'll be seeding again as soon as I can.

Also, you who download should help seeding yourself. Don't just download the game and leave it all to me. Help me to help others get the game downloaded."
