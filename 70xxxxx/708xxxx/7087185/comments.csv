,SkeelZ91,2012-03-13T22:02Z,"you have to be jailbroken, and then you have to download 'appsync' for 5.0.1 via Cydia. After that, you can download 'iFunBox' and install the apps/games through there. "

,TehAgent,2012-03-26T14:47Z,"As long as you have a Jailbroken device

You can install this by going to your music folder > itunes > itunes media > Automatically add to itunes 

And putting the app in there. 

then just start itunes and select the apps tab, it will refresh your apps list, then go to your device in the side menu and select it in the list of apps on the sync screen. much easier than logging into your phone and doing it that way

you dont need fun box or anyother program. "

,blackbunnygirl,2012-06-28T06:10Z,"I found iFunbox to be pretty useful though. You can use iTunes but that generally requires you to sync your device, which I personally find incredibly frustrating (especially as I had installed vital apps from another machine).

iTunes is a workable way to install cracked iOS apps, but iFunbox offers so much more flexibility."
