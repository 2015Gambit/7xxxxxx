Halo special edition, easy to install. I created the installer is in Portuguese Notepad because I am Brazilian, but the install is in English. In winrar contains the instructions to install, but is in Portuguese, so I'll write them here.


directions

Create a folder on the desktop (work area) with the name
Halo EE and download this winrar to the folder.

Unpack and create a folder again
(inside this folder) named a Halo Special Edition
Destinatorio

Now double-clicks the installer with the name Halo
Special Edition and click on browse, select the folder that
you created with the name Halo Special Edition Destinatorio
and click on install.

After install (very fast on a pentium dual core 1.6Ghz),
and go to the folder and click the executable HaloCE with
Right click and send to ===> workspace, create
shortcut.

Now go the shortcut on the desktop, double-clicks and
have fun playing.
