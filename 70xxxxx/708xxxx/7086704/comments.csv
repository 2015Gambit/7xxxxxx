,rock3r5,2012-04-08T19:07Z,"thanx bro , bt why is visual studio 11 inďťż black and white , how can i change its interface to color to make it look like VS2010 ? plz help ..."
,UA-07,2012-04-09T00:59Z,"@ rock3r5 , well thats how M$ wants VS 11 to look like and I dont think VS 11 will be a much difference than VS 2010 if you are using any OS other than W8 as it is optimized to make Metro style apps in W8 only . Hope you will seed and get used to the look of it ."
,millennium5,2012-04-12T11:26Z,Why post beta's? You can dl it officially at MS! Legally!: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads
,UA-07,2012-04-12T17:54Z,"@millennium5 , this is not legal as am sharing a beta of a program which is available to whoever wants to try it . about uploading this , I have uploaded this as a torrent will give you more speed and you can pause your download at anytime and still resume it while the link you gave wont allow you that ."
