,Hakuei,2012-03-11T06:36Z,"I don't understand, IMMERSE versions of Justified is the only thing that my TV can't play perfectly. In each episode there is one moment where I get ~ 4/5 freezes.
And this episode just cut out around the 28 min mark.

A while ago I downloaded a WEB-DL version of one episode and it worked perfectly (but it's harder to find). IMMERSE versions of other TV shows play perfectly fine too.
What the fuck."
