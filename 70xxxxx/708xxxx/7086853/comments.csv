,ACE-ECA-,2012-06-23T13:20Z,"itune worked fine with my iPOD Touch, but in My Computer it shows the iPOD as a digital camera, and this software failed to see where the connected iPOD is after many tries, any helps? I'm using WinXP Pro (sp3), iOS 5.1.1 and latest iTune version installed"
,ACE-ECA-,2012-06-25T03:46Z,"I don't need this sh!t-ware any more, cos I just learnt how to get those photos and videos out of a digital camera now (iPOD). MS and iTUNE are both pieces of sh!ts! Even my Samsung digital camera installed a driver for itself and let me open it's folder inside to get my personal photos! We're on planet apes! itUNE is planet sh!t! Itune is a very expensive sh!t that couldn't filter between JPG and copyrighted Hollywood and SOny sh!ts!"
,ACE-ECA-,2012-06-25T04:01Z,"iTUNE and Apple made their own USB drivers for iPOD, they blame it on Microsoft for faults created from their own end, their drivers are made to filter out third party softwares from detecting iPOD (in some cases - even Microsoft!), it doesn't work too well on their own drivers on some rigs!"
,ACE-ECA-,2012-06-25T04:02Z,"First it show it's APPLE IPOD in MY COMPUTER, then later it changed to DIGITAL CAMERA in MY COMPUTER with your IPOD's username on it ... who did that? MS or Apple?!!"
