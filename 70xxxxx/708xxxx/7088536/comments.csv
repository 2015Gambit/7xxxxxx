,notchjohnson1,2012-03-09T19:28Z,WHY ALWAYS MP4? EVERYONE CONSTANTLY COMPLAINS ABOUT IT YET YOU CHANGE NOTHING. FUCK YOU
,dot.paar,2012-03-09T22:22Z,@notchjohnson1 WTF? anyone who doesn't like it can use another torrent
,johanneswiberg,2012-03-10T19:23Z,"@notchjohnson1 ""Fuck you""? Someone offers you something for free and it's not precisely in the perfect fashion that you prefer - and you comment ""fuck you""? Oh, all caps... should have realised you're 3 years old."
,nonukez,2012-03-10T19:59Z,"@notchjohnson1 Man, you have to be the most stupid and ungrateful person on PirateBay, and that's a hard title to attain.
If you don't like the filetype, there are other torrents for you to download. Or hey, why don't you pay for cable instead of whining like a fucking Jew? These guys are doing this for your own benefit, and you cry about the format? Jesus, your parents must hate you.
Also, ""everyone"" is not complaining; you are not everyone. Very few people are complaining, and their complaints are usually silenced once they realize how easy it is to play MP4 or convert it. 
Use Google, you spoiled little piece of shit. "
,patka2,2012-03-11T14:08Z,"@notchjohnson1 - my god, you're such a douchebag."
,goldkirby,2012-03-11T18:40Z,"@notchjohnson1 - wow, you are an idiot. Don't like the format, don't DL it. There are plenty of other files out there. For me, x264 in an mp4 container gives you the best quality to compression ratio, so suck it."
,joanmcbitch,2012-03-16T03:41Z,"Seems like Johnson IS the ""everyone"" he was referring to. You are either computer illiterate or a troll. There is really no other option when you consider the simplicity that comes with fixing your problem.

@nonukez Pretty sure you don't need cable for Parks & Rec...soooo uber Jew then?"
,notchjohnson1,2012-03-17T21:07Z,MP4 SUCKS AND SO DO ALL OF YOU FAGS
,shWit,2012-03-26T02:00Z,Long live MP4! notchjohnson1 in a whiny cunt!
,danimation3d,2012-03-26T12:33Z,"notchjohnson1 is probably trying to open the mp4 in MS Paint, cause cocksmoker doesn't have a clue about technology"
,fish2764,2012-03-28T23:05Z,"i am in no way ungrateful, but can anyone shed some light on why the change to mp4 from avi?
"
,rjcripe,2012-04-13T06:16Z,"notchjohnson1 is most certainly being over the top here, but I have to agree with him. I really don't understand the sudden switch from AVI to MP4 as the go-to format for the top uploaders. Is there a reason behind this? It really seems backwards. Yes, on the computer filetype really doesn't matter. Most video players can play most formats and, if for some reason your preferred video player can't, there are a thousand more free ones out there you can use temporarily that can play the format. But that's not the issue.

The issue is that 90% of non-computer video players (like... the ones that you can plug into a TV--ie: DVD players with USB ports, 360s, PS3s, USB-to-TV boxes, etc.) all either prefer AVI or just straight up won't play any other file type. And I know for a fact that a LOT of us who come here for their shows prefer watching them on TVs... and you have no idea how many times in recent months I have downloaded the wrong format. Yes, it's an easy fix and now I generally catch myself before I've wasted the download time and switch to another uploader who uses AVIs. But it's very, very frustrating.

I know this may not seem like a big deal to most of you--and it may not be a big deal. But it is frustrating, no one can be honest and deny that. Sometimes I feel like visiting comment sections and going off just as notchjohnson1 has done, but I realize that won't fix anything. But the thing is, when MOST downloaders don't care about filetype and can play anything, why use a format like MP4? It alienates a fairly large portion of the website's traffic while using AVI caters to the needs of EVERY downloader. It's not like an AVI has lower quality than an MP4 (which, btw, is why I understand some people's preference for MKVs--those DO have a higher quality--but in the case of MP4 vs AVI there is no discernible difference).

So, there. I'll play the role as the calm and articulate voice for the 25% of Pirate Bay downloaders who prefer AVI over MP4 for a *very* specific reason. Now you know!"
,rjcripe,2012-04-13T06:20Z,"But there is something I would like to add--the uploaders in recent weeks have caught on to the desires of that portion of pirates who not only prefer AVI's but REQUIRE them. It's very, very rare now for a popular video upload to not have an accompanying AVI file within minutes after the MP4/MKV upload. And for that, I am very grateful."
,Craigos8725,2012-04-19T08:13Z,"For all you guys still using DVD players and consoles to watch video files on your tv's why not just build a media system. Nearly every graphics card out these days has HDMI for your LCD's an plasmas or led if you wanna be fancy. 

Seriously its not hard. These days building a rig is less difficult than building a model airplane and it only cost about $250 for parts for a media rig.

Think about it, all the freedom of windows on your tv and you won't get the urge to complain about formats."
