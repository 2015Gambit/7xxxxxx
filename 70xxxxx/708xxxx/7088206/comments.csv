,whmxtra,2012-03-10T21:56Z,"Just a heads up folks, there might not be an HQ release this week. This ep sparked a bit of controversy and lifetime so far has pulled all references to this ep from their site so they may not upload the full ep this week, which means I won't have a source for an HQ rip for this one.

But I'm still looking, you never know what I'll find lol"
,whmxtra,2012-03-10T22:33Z,"And I'm back.... found what should be an HQ source, ripping now, will have it up in a couple hours, along with secret lives of dancers episode 5."
,whmxtra,2012-03-11T00:50Z,"And I spoke too soon, this is going to take awhile to find an HQ source as Lifetime hasn't put the episode up and probably won't."
,whmxtra,2012-03-12T05:02Z,"ok, good news is I found an HQ source, bad news is TPB is messed up atm and won't allow uploads lol. Will do it as  soon as they get that fixed"
,whmxtra,2012-03-12T07:06Z,HQ version now up: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7094787/Dance.Moms.S02E09.flv
,whmxtra,2012-03-15T00:12Z,"Episode 10 of Dance Moms now up: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7103291/Dance.Moms.S02E10.flv

No HQ till Saturday but still very watchable"
