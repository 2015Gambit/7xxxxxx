Mean Machines Sega Magazine Issues 01-53 (Oct 1992 - Mar 1997)

Mean Machines Sega was the successor to the multi-format Mean Machines
(also available at RetroPDFs) and, as the name implies, focussed solely
on gaming on the Sega consoles of the era. It ran for 53 issues before
being quietly absorbed into EMAP's other Sega publications.

These PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on
public torrent trackers . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and
copying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd
like to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most
PDF readers, including the iPad.

The OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the
more unusual fonts and layouts used and by the relatively low DPI of the
source images. 

The file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG
images; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible
without losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)

More OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check(or Google RetroPDFs) for more information.

Thanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site
(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to RetroPDFs
for their support.

90's style "greets" to anyone formally or currently involved in the
Amiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat
Will, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD
Grapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)
