,Daoloth,2012-03-09T19:47Z,"""Command line option syntax error. Type Command /? for help."" When mounting with DT. Opening the iso to manually run the installer I get ""The required resource 'setup.ini' is missing,"" which it is not.

Unusable as it stands, any help? I'm not doing it wrong. I'd skip this file if I were anyone else."
,MOTNS,2012-03-12T05:45Z,"(@Daoloth & people with this error)

I got the same error and accidently got it to work lol. So this is what I did on Windows 7

1)I unzipped the image to a folder 

2)Mounting the image and pressing the installer gave me that error AND also created a folder at ""C:Users*username*AppDataLocalTempIXP001.TMP""

3) If the IXP001.TMP folder has a different number in the folder name it doesn't matter. JUST FIND THE ONE THAT HAS a ""RELOADED.EXE"" file and another setup.exe. 

4) So then I moved eveything I extracted from the image in Step#1 to  ""C:Users*username*AppDataLocalTempIXP001.TMP"" except for the crack

5)I right clicked on on the set-up file and Ran as Administrator and was able to install.

6)When the game finished installing I just placed the crack in the usually spot in Program Files(x86)2ksportsMlb2k12"
