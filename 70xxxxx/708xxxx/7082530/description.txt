Caravanserai is the fourth studio album by Santana released in October 1972. It marked a major 
turning point in Carlos Santana's career as it was a sharp departure from his critically 
acclaimed first three albums. Original bassist David Brown left the group in 1971 and was 
replaced by Doug Rauch and Tom Rutley, while original percussionist Michael Carabello left and 
was replaced by Armando Peraza. Keyboardist/vocalist Gregg Rolie, who was having a falling-out 
with Santana, was replaced by Tom Coster on a few songs. Caravanserai reached the top 10 of the 
Billboard 200 chart in 1972.

The sound contrasted greatly with Santana's trademark fusion of salsa, rock, and jazz, and 
concentrated mostly on jazz-like instrumental passages. All but three tracks were instrumentals, 
and consequently the album yielded no hit singles. The album is the first among a series of Santana 
albums that were known for their increasing musical complexity, marking a move away from the popular 
rock format of the early Santana albums towards a more contemplative and experimental jazz sound. 
While Caravanserai is regarded as an artistic success, the musical changes that began on its release 
in 1972 marked the start of a slide in Santana's commercial popularity.

It was the last Santana album to feature Gregg Rolie and Neal Schon, who went on to form Journey 
the following year.
