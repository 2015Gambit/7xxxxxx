,firexninja,2012-03-10T21:55Z,thank you!
,BigBlack6Pack,2012-03-11T00:31Z,.avi is such a crappy format when it comes to highres videos. Stfu and get combined community codec pack or a converting program.
,williamlee2,2012-03-21T05:39Z,"@BigBlack6Pack: For some of us, it's not a question of what codec or what player to use. I copy .avi files to a thumbdrive and plug it into my DVD player to watch shows on my TV. The dvd player can't play .mp4 or .mkv files. I'll convert my own videos if it comes to that but don't act superior because you prefer one format over another. Everyone has a reason for liking what they like. Jeesh."
