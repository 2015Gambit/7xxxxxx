Cinderella was started in 1940 after Prokofiev had developed a greater interest in ballets following 
the success of Romeo and Juliet. He broke off work on it in 1942 to compose patriotic pieces and eventually 
War and Peace. Cinderella was intended from the beginning to be a full-length classical piece and was finally 
premiered, with Ulanova in the title role, in 1945. It immediately became a staple and quickly traveled to 
other countries. In England, the character additions of Sir Frederick Ashton are legendary and have been adopted 
almost everywhere.

The production here was created in 1986 by Rudolf Nureyev. He originally wanted to produce Cinderella in 
classic 17th century style and rejected the idea of set designer Petrika Ionesco that the work be set 
in Hollywood in the 1930s. However, Nureyev could not get this idea out of his mind and once the 
two got started all of Nureyev’s love of the movies came into play. The Prince becomes a Movie Star, 
the Fairy Godmother a Hollywood producer and Cinderella eventually wins both the Movie Star and a film contract. 
In between there are many allusions to 1930s movies and even a couple of scenes shot to appear as if on screen. 
Yet the basic story is intact and Nureyev was scrupulous in his use of Prokofiev’s music.
