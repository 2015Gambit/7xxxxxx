@ ""baronxs - 2012-03-06 14:37 CET: ""

It´s probably because you have downloaded the russian release with russian subtitles.
"
,sl00ke,2012-03-06T14:52Z,"to start mission: u get a new mail in your private terminal, from there read and follow instructions"

,gossen83,2012-03-06T15:40Z,"During the first DLC mission a infamous bug-crash that EVERYBODY in the U.S who bought a legit copy of ME3 also experiences is a crash if you watch the 2 videos in the wrong order. If you get a crash to desktop (CTD) read this thread and do what they suggest: grab the other signal-video first since watching one of the two vids causes a CTD but the other way around works. 

http://social.bioware.com/forum/1/topic/344/index/9654333/1#9655515

""Getting the other video first DOES in fact work, However, There are other 'crash locations' throughout the game, So you're not out of the woods yet! ""

That comment from a U.S-ME3 owner suggests there are more spots in the game where CTD:s happend but this has nothing to do with the pirated vs legitcopy as these things are as many know general bugs and need to be patched. Luckily it seems this is the only spot so far I can find in a thread and its avoidable by grabbing the OTHER signal-video in the mission first (somewhere else on the planet)."
,gossen83,2012-03-06T15:49Z,"P.S : The ""2nd"" (other) video signal is just 1mob-pack and 2-3 buildings away. Watch that one first, then watch the first one where it crashes to desktop (The correct video to watch is with a ""pod"" in it (no spoiler) ."
,toureyaya,2012-03-06T16:30Z,This shit just this in Russian
,furou,2012-03-06T16:51Z,So anyone figured out how to get the DLC to work with English subtitles? It seems like it isn't using the BIOgame and tlk files that the main game does for eng voice/subs
,MLO89,2012-03-06T21:30Z,DLC now works but subtitles and any text are still Russian with voices in English. Apparently we need a English DLC version.
,gossen83,2012-03-07T01:14Z,"Or your english is good enough to just disable subtitles, can´t have it all, either buy it or just roll with it like everyone else. And this isn´t a dlc, it´s a crack, try another dlc."
,gossen83,2012-03-07T01:36Z,"I just tried turning on subtitles, it´s perfectly fine and ENGLISH (Get the RELOADED version) before you start whining here about ""only russian subtitles and english VOICE) .

Works perfectly fine, if you got the russian version and can´t read that you`ve dl:ed the russian GAMEVERSION then don´t whine here."
,Sejo323,2012-03-07T19:52Z,"I got 2 questions
