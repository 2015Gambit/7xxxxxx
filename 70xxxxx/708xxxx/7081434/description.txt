I am currently on my first Preatorian mission since I added this to the cracked (reloaded version .exe-file) : masseffect3.exe, at offset 981f0, change bytes to b8 01 00 00 00 c2 08 00 .

Since I gave you the instructions above of what to change with a hex-editor to be able to play from Ashes you can do it yourself to your cracked masseffect3.exe but if you can not be arsed just get my editet .exe file where I added the line, I have JUST started the first preatorian-mission (after you have downloaded this you start up masseffect3 as usual and check your TERMINAL in Normandy where you will have a private message... will not SPOIL more) .

So, either add the code-line I typed or just dl my .exe-file (ofcourse it is virusfree and you virusprogram will not detect anything) since the only thing done is adding offset 981f0, change bytes to b8 01 00 00 00 c2 08 00 in masseffect3.exe .

NO CREDIT TO ME, since this fix was taken of forums...

Bioware: FU** you and your 1-day DLC:s, I had preordered the game since 9 months back, I cancelled my pre-order as soon as I found out about your hideous day1-dlc aswell as the butt-ugly graphics in the demo aswell as horrendous animations. I┬┤ve also cancelled my SWTOR account and stated the same reasons when I did it. ENJOY PPL and please thank me or write something when you have tried it :) . (You can just alt-tab when you start it up and see NO dlc error message and after you checked your normandy-messages and write something here as thanks :) ).
