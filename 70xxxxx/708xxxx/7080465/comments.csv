,hallelujah777,2012-03-07T22:05Z,"A big, big thanks for all the uploads..words can't even describe it..glad that I found your channel. All these downloads have been a great blessing! 

It would really be appreciated if you could please put 'get torrent file' option in your torrents.

Many thanks and God bless!"
,tommycool88,2012-03-08T00:35Z,"Many thankx bro, you are always appreciated. Keep up the good work. You are helping to keep some of us away from secular music."
,sicanddisturbed,2012-03-08T14:47Z,I was wondering if you have Flame - The 6th? I would appreciate it if you could upload it! Thanks for all the hardwork its appreciated.
,tommycool88,2012-03-09T03:43Z,"Still unable to download this torrent. Just like as Hallelujah777 suggested, could you add the '"" Get torrent file"" option.

Thankx"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-03-12T14:46Z,"That ""get torrent file"" option isn't something I can add, or to my knowledge, remove from any torrent I post.  I believe The Pirate Bay recently changed their policy on torrents, and now they only offer those magnetic link, and not the dot torrent files.

Here, let me go and dig up the dirt for you...

""The Pirate Bay announced more than two years ago that it would stop supporting .torrent files in favor of magnet links. Today TPB made the change official. The Swedish file hosting site replaced all .torrent files being shared by 10 users or more with magnet links. The magnet links are a type of â&#x20AC;&#x153;trackerlessâ&#x20AC;? torrent that pre-calculates a torrent hash (the code helping downloaders find peers with the file they seek) and places the hash within the link. Users looking for a file can then request it in a decentralized way, rather than ask a centralized torrent server to connect the user with another peer. Most current BitTorrent clients support magnet links, and the Pirate Bay previously made magnet links the default method of posting and acquiring files. Users of older BitTorrent clients might now find themselves frustrated. Certain file-sharers have been resistant to the idea of magnet links because it takes a longer time for the download to get going."""

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-03-13T02:27Z,"""any chance you could put the cd by the crabb family called together again and thanks in advance""

That ""Together Again"" album was just released on the 7th of February.  Although I have about 20 or so ""Crabb Family"" albums available to me, unfortunately Together Again isn't one of them.  Sorry about that.  :("
,bobeard38,2012-03-13T13:39Z,no problem bro. Thanks for trying :) God Bless you for doing all you do!!!!
,hallelujah777,2012-03-15T13:03Z,"Yes Sir, they do have. Anyways I've discovered how to download the selected files out of magnet link. Thanks again, now i am onto your 6th bundle of music. Man, you're awesome! xD"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-03-15T16:53Z,"Just willing to share whatever was shared with me, or whatever I've been blessed to pick up along the way.

I sure would prefer sharing what was requested of me, as opposed to just anything released during the 2012 calendar year. But until such time that I'm asked to torrent such and such, I'm more than happy to continue doing the whole ""The Year In Christian Music"" thing."
,zarkann1,2012-03-19T13:45Z,"Such a great compilation !

Moriah Peters song is giving me goose bump :)

God bless you all"
