It's watchable, but if you care enough to want a high-def copy, you won't want this one.  Unfortunately the only other 720p copy is around 6GB, so it's a long download and then you'll have to re-encode it or keep an oversized file.  Wish people would just use proper encoding rates and settings.  Anything around 2GB is going to be excellent for a typical 720p movie.  Anything under 1GB is going to be dramatically compromised."
