,Auscultation,2012-07-06T23:37Z,"1st: THANK YOU ChattChitto for all of the hard work you've put into bringing us so many GREAT Up's! 
2nd: Quasi-newbie ? ...I already have v2.3 (thanks to Dr. ChattChitto) & want to upgrade to this ver.  Should I do a complete uninstall, then fire up this new ver from scratch?  Or generate a serial, hit update, paste said serial & see if it works w/ the newer ver (newest is v2.47.0.1539)?  Maybe I'll give that a try (what the hell?), uninstall & load this if it doesn't work!?  Unless anyone has some wisdom they'd like to share, I'll give it a try & let you all know.  Thanks in advance to any comments/info anyone might have for me.  And, thanks again to you ChattChitto!                              "
