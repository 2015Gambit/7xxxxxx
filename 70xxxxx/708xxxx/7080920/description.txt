Shaun the Sheep - Life's a Treat [Theme song promo].VOB


Very HQ promo complete theme song music video from a DVD. "Life's a Treat" is a single from the animated TV series Shaun the Sheep that is performed by the comedian Vic Reeves

A premise of the series is that Shaun the sheep exhibits human intelligence, creativity, and behaviour in a farm setting, which usually provides a situational comedy conflict which Shaun must resolve before the end of each episode. Recurring themes include the characters evading the sheepdog Bitzer (though he is sometimes with the sheep in their escapades) and avoiding discovery by the Farmer.

Episodes are very much a combination of slapstick and classic silent comedy in AardmanΓÇÖs recognizable animation style. There is no spoken dialogue, even by human characters. In this way it is reminiscent of silent comedy films and even Pingu and the animated version of Mr. Bean. However, simple grunts, bleats, and sighs are all used to add subtle expression to each character's moods and feelings.

Shaun the Sheep made his first "official" appearance in Wallace & Gromit's third short feature, the Academy Award winning A Close Shave as the youngest member of a flock of sheep Wallace and Gromit work to save from an evil mechanical dog that wants to turn them all into dog food for profit. Shaun does show a hint of intelligence, though he proves to be a big factor in saving the day. Shaun and the entire herd are also seen living with the inventive duo (much to Wallace's annoyance since they eat everything in sight, including furniture and clothes as well as his beloved cheese), though none of this seems to be part of this series' canon, or it can be surmised Wallace simply sold off the flock to The Farmer where Shaun and his friends now reside.

Shaun also made a brief cameo appearance with the duo in one of the episodes (entitled "Shopper 13") of Wallace & Gromit's "Cracking Contraptions" web series of shorts.
