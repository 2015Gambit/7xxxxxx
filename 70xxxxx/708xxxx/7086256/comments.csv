This is the first of them -- my own personal colour correction for Luna Eclipsed.  I noticed that the original file of the late PonyArchive (included in my ""Season 2 1st Half"" torrent) didn't have the same colour correction as the others.  So I popped a fresh iTunes copy into Adobe Premiere, and voilĂ .

Visit this gallery to compare all three versions of the episode:

[printed like that since TPB refuses to display the normal URL]

""S02E04_iTunes##""	unedited iTunes colours
""S02E04_iTunes##+PA""	colour-correction as created for PonyArchive
""S02E04_iTunes##+PHR""	colour-correction by yours truly

Overall, I upped the saturation and changed the white/black balances a bit.  (Also, notice how Celestia is PINK in the original iTunes file?  DX)  It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn close to those other amazing files from the late PonyArchive.  And it'll do until higher-resolution releases make their way onto iTunes or wherever.

I may do this with all future episodes, i.e. encode my own instead of waiting on ZR.  (It looks like he/she is using Handbrake, so I'll see if I can make HB behave nicely for me, for once.)  I'll include this file in my full Season 2 torrent.  Feel free to replace the file from the ""Season 2 1st Half"" torrent with this."
