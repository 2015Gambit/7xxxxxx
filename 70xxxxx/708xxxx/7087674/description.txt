Rocco's Dad has a new girlfriend and she's a personal/business coach. Since Rocco has had terrible luck in business, she's volunteered to sit down with him, and see if they can get to bottom of his troubles. Everything starts out fine, and Rocco has certainly noticed how beautiful she is, but when she starts asking more personal questions, he get's uncomfortable. Trying to divert attention away from her probing, he asks if she might let her hair down, just to relax the mood a little. She agrees, but only he'll start answering her questions. It is, after all, for his own good. Once her hair is down, he see's how truly gorgeous she is, and before she can say no, he's making his move, and giving her a little coaching of his own.
