This is going to bug me until I figure it out.

I've never uploaded on Demonoid, I stay quiet on that site.  The tracker scares me, even though I overseed.  It's like having a coco next to you when you're driving.  Even if you aren't speeding, you still get stressed."

,Xpatriated,2012-03-08T23:01Z,"Ah, yes.  Yeah, you've been pretty active over there lately.
But you obviously know what I mean about the ratio (Mister .49).  How is it possible for an uploader to have less than a 1-1 ratio?  It doesn't make sense, but everyone hates you for it.  Or maybe that's all in my head and I'm just insane.  That's possible too."
[V],GunningHawk90,2012-03-09T05:03Z,"After uploading 342 torrents, you'd think my ratio would be atleast two. Last week, I uploaded over 30 GB of friends but Demonoid chose to ignore that.

And, then I download 2 GB of Stephanie Brown and Demonoid glady adds that to my ratio. That's how it's been like for over 6 months.

If, they'd actually calculated it correctly, my ratio should be somewhere around 3. But, it's a lost cause."
