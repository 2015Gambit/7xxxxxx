eztv, TvTeam and others dependables are all going to the annoying mkv or mp4!!!! I say stick to the 175 / 220 / 350 mb AVI format for tv shows, it plays on everything!!

KEEP THE AVI UP LOADS COMING!!! "

I Wish eztv would go back to avi files..    and i wish he or she woudl label his files as mp4...

i hate to complain but my dvds love avi files only..."
