I dont D/L from any other source, your rips are spot on, i facepalm when i read all the idiots that d/l then get on here and winge as they cant follow some very simple instructions.  Also any chance of an invite to the TPTB sight? Ive been checking it for years and have never found registrations open, would be MUCH appreciated!!  Keep up the freakin awesome rips guys, thanks again"

,AznAssassin,2012-03-13T11:25Z,Looks good! Will comment on quality when finish downloading but I am expecting an amazing rip as always :) Thanks TPTB/Shroo! :D
,ovnoglavi,2012-03-13T16:33Z,"WOW! Now this is one thing I never saw coming!!! TPTB are back! And that's a comeback with a mayor game rip! 
I was wrestling with BlackBox repack(at the game start, Bioware's intro would play and than everything goes black, nada, zero, zilch...), and now I'm forcing all my resources to TPTB rip download!!!

I hope I'm not mistaking and this rip will be good as every other this group has made... 
Nevertheless, working or not, I want to thank Shroo for giving me hope that I will play this game without buying it!!! 
Oh yeah, BIG thanx to fellow seeders for making this download possible..."

,AznAssassin,2012-03-25T08:20Z,"This version is PERFECT. Anyone having trouble with playing the game:
1). Check your fcking PC. A ton of dumbfcks on torrent sites always complain that a game wont work but really its because their PC spec is too low
2). Update your drivers. Video card, Sound and Movie plug-ins + Directx etc

If they dont work, I guess you're pretty fcked coz this version WORKS 100%. Thanks Shroo/TPTB! :D"
,hitanshu_conman,2012-03-29T09:39Z,"@Gindian

while tptb version has done this specifically : - 
Note2: Videos are left out at 100% quality for :

thnx 4 the quality upload at lowest size"

,farberama,2012-03-31T18:07Z,"I'm relatively new to torrents, so please bare with me.  I unzipped it and ran setup.bat.  I got the window that says 15GB of space required and 20-40 min for decompression, and TPTB.4.EVER.exe runs, but nothing else happens.  It's been like this for about 45 min.  Is this how it's suppose to work or am I missing something?  Thanks in advance for your help."
,farberama,2012-03-31T18:10Z,nevermind...
,kkmudgle,2012-04-01T05:16Z,"when running setup.bat the installation crash at 80% with the error ""extraction failed due to low memory or corrupted cab file"" while there is enough  memory and swap space. plz help "
,farberama,2012-04-01T16:12Z,"first I want to say thx for the torrent!

I got everything up and running, and I really like the game, so far.   But, about 50% of the time the game crashes on start up right after the ""click any key"" splash page while its ""communicating.""  

Any ideas what could be causing this?  It just seems odd that it doesnt happen all the time."

Only one problem audio is so low."
,sansyeux,2012-07-09T18:25Z,"hello everyone!

 I seem to run into a little problem, lately ea login is popping out every time i put the game. obviously this being a pirated game it won't let me open doors(or anything else) making me stuck in the game. now I'm close to finishing it for the 2nd run with the extended cut ending.

  I really want to finish already. is there a work around to this?

[other than buying the game?]"
,sansyeux,2012-07-09T20:43Z,"nevermind, got it fixed using this crack. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7079992/Mass.Effect.3.CRACK.ONLY-RELOADED

can't run the dlc from ashes though. i did before =[.
"
,sansyeux,2012-07-09T22:54Z,"tssss... here i am once again!

started the game, can't open the first door after knocking out the husk.

if anyone out there finds a workaround, let me know =D. peace!"
