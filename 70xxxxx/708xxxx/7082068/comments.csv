Changelog Here Guys

Alan Wake v1.03.16.4825 Update info:

- Add Latin-American Localization support (download the Free DLC from Steam and add -locale=esm to Alan Wake's Steam launch options to use it)
- Added -directaiming command line parameter that removes all mouse acceleration (enables also -rigidcamera automatically) 
- Improved low level mouse reading routines to make the control cope better with low and variable frame rates. This also removes the reported jerkiness when -rigidcamera was enabled. You may need to re-adjust your mouse sensitivity in the menus! 
- Removed auto-aim that was accidentally enabled in the previous build 
- Added a frame rate limiter to menus & videos to prevent cards running at 1000's of fps (reduces stress on the graphics cards)
- Reduced CPU use when game doesn't have focus
- Fixed ""first run"" on a 2nd PC overwriting saves & statistics downloaded from cloud
- Fixed crashes when using alt-tab to change out of the game when the game is loading 
- Fixed DEVICE_CREATE_ERROR for users who have ""custom DPI"" set in Windows. 
- Fixed one specific case of ""File IO Failure"" issue when unable to write to My Documents 
- Fixed camera to remember it's side preference (tab key) 
- Fixed Cursor Key / Numpad assignment issues 
- Fixed screen brightness back to original when changing process 
- Fixed some cases of ""back"" and Return to Game functionality so that it doesn't need 3 presses
- Thanks for your feedback! We are still working on improvements & fixes, please see our forum for up to date troubleshooting and update information: http://forum.alanwake.com/showthread.php?t=7759"
