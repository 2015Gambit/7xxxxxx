,DarkstarG,2012-03-10T08:52Z,"thanks, but it's missing a LC (according to forums, there are two folders LEAL and LEAL_LC)

also getting weird runway texture, which moves with the aircraft. i think that's because of the missing lc."

,ROJO815,2012-03-20T23:50Z,Is this just the 2004 version covered up as the fsx version. Thats whats properly causing the Runway glitch. Because the installer is not an official Eiresim Installer. And theres no LC file.
