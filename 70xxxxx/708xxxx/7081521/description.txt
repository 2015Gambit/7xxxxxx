Requested and it wasn't here already, so:

Alicante Ultimate

LEAL

Alicante Ultimate is the most realistic release to date from the Eiresim Team and indeed our first scenery outside Ireland. It is the first Spanish Airport to include high detail 20cm/pixel aerial imagery throughout that captures Alicante Airport in all its glory. Attention to detail has been the key behind developing Alicante Airport and all airport structures have been included with the scenery, including the soon to be opened Terminal 3 and the nearby coastal apartments which can be seen on final approach to runway 28.
