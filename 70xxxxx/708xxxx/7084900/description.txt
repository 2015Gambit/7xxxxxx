There are two different maps you can download - which one you want depends on whether or not you plan on installing Open Sauce.

The .map (this version) can be played with or without Open Sauce, but is missing several secondary visual and gameplay features that rely on OS scripting and memory boosts.

The .yelo can only be played with Open Sauce, but contains the complete experience. Specifically, it includes:

-Full-resolution textures
-Battle Rifle singleshot/burst shot toggling
-VISR mode
-Features in pause menu for changing Open Sauce-related settings
-Assorted easter eggs

If you have any questions or issues (or want to see this information more in-depth), make sure you read the included CMT Manual first!

Regardless of which version you download, you are encouraged to get the latest version of Open Sauce from its Google Code Page: http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce . We highly recommend you install OS - the process incredibly simple and non-intrusive, and the benefits are immense. The only requirement is that you update a properly installed copy of Halo Custom Edition to 1.09 and do not use XFire while you are playing the game (seriously, even having the XFire process running can make Open Sauce crash, so make sure that youΓÇÖve completely ended the program's process!)
