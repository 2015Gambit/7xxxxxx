,shock.d0wn,2012-03-07T03:50Z,dude at least wait for 1 dude to download it from you...we are all stuck at 15.8
,Alchsnip3s,2012-03-07T08:40Z,Im stuck on 78 please let us download
,Niyazov,2012-03-07T09:08Z,"Purely for curiousities sake:

Currently, the lot of us are stuck at 78.6%.  However, since I began download when it was around 40%, there have been approximately 135+ seeders, which I'm unable to connect to.  Once it finally reaches 100% for us, then we'll all be able to seed, the number of seeders will rise dramatically, and the torrent will operate as we'd expect it to.

So, my question is:  Who are these (mythical?) 135 seeders?  And if they actually exist, then we can't we download from them?

I've wondered this for quite some time and was hoping somebody here would have the answer... and it's not like we have anything else to do for the next couple of hours... ;-( Thanks in advance."
,morgues,2012-03-07T09:50Z,fuck this torrent!!!!! been downloading for 7 hrs!!!!! seed fucks!
,izzybella,2012-03-07T10:43Z,"I'm playing it through VLC as suggested, but the sound keeps cutting out at 39secs......any suggestions on what I can do please?"
,izzybella,2012-03-07T10:46Z,Opening it with iTunes puts the words miles in front of the people too. I'm just an Aussie who wants their Geordie Shore fix lol
,weasltera,2012-03-07T11:35Z,Dude your other uploads are all good but the quality of the ones is absolute shite!! I don't want to have to wait til its on here in NZ I want to watch it NOW!! :(
,wiggumpud,2012-03-07T12:22Z,Is it actually watchable?
,midge4th,2012-03-07T16:01Z,"it is absolutely shit quality, footage been cut and and skip parts, audio fucks up sometimes. its just not worth watching if people can find another version. I know this is a flaw we shouldnt moan about since you have uploaded it for us for free but my god, if youre going to make an effort, at least do the fucking job right."
,james78911,2012-03-07T18:47Z,"Its a bit shit when you take time out of your life to give something to other people. I tried right? Tell me its bad, dont be a massive dick about it. If you really want it that much PAY FOR MTV."
