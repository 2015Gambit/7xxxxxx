,opticalnoise,2012-04-02T12:28Z,"Everthing works great except for Splinter Cell. I installed both packages in the correct order, but when I try to launch it, I get a black screen and can't bring up the menu with the PS button. Anyone else got it working?

I'm on Rogero 3.72"
,Hazardous420,2012-04-19T01:03Z,to get splinter cell to work you need to run multiman first. Dont know why.

,MrAwesome85,2012-09-24T04:18Z,Thanks for this torrent I just want to ask How exactly does the PS1 Loader works? I was wondering if I can just use it like an Emulator and play my ROMs off a HDD. Does this allow me to do that?
