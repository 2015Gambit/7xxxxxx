Jethro Tull are a British rock group formed in Luton, Bedfordshire in December 1967. Their 
music is characterised by the vocals, acoustic guitar, and flute playing of Ian Anderson, 
who has led the band since its founding, and the guitar work of Martin Barre, who has been 
with the band since 1969.

Initially playing blues rock with an experimental flavour, they have also incorporated 
elements of classical music, folk music, jazz, hard rock and art rock into their music.

One of the world's best-selling music artists, the band have sold more than 60 million 
albums worldwide in a career that has spanned more than forty years.

A Passion Play is a concept album, and the sixth studio album, released by Jethro Tull. 
Apparently concerning the spiritual journey of one man in the afterlife, it is similar 
to Thick as a Brick in that it is one long track split across both sides of the LP vinyl 
record, save for the interruption of the oddly whimsical spoken-word piece "The Story of 
the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles" (a section that is very similar to, and probably parodies, 
Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf) Upon its release in 1973, it received generally 
negative reviews; nevertheless, it sold well enough to reach #1 on the charts in the 
United States. In the United Kingdom, however, it did not do as well, reaching #13
