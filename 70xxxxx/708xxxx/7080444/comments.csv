,DiabloTheCritic,2012-03-06T06:32Z,Why the fuck can't we get all files to show up in list any more.
,mrxdst,2012-03-06T07:49Z,"@DiabloTheCritic
TPB is using magnet links now. You don't actually download the torrent file from tpb. Magnet links tells your torrent client to download the .torrent file from a seed. Whats why you can't see the files before you start downloading the torrent  "
,PG1874FC,2012-03-06T09:23Z,"When the download starts, give it about 30 seccs then highlight 'files' near the bottom left if using u torrent then the files show in that torrent, right click the ones you don't want and choose 'don't download'"

,idonthaveafuckingclue,2012-03-12T02:45Z,How is this uploaded when it hasn't aired yet? Makes me skeptical. Maybe VTV is just that good. Any comments?

Does anyone have episode 10?"
,Erenath,2012-03-15T06:31Z,"I'm sorry to say, but this is episode 9. They had a double release and mixed up the episodes so this is originally ep.9   If you see the end they show you previews from the same episode. "
