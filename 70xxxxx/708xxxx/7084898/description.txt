Gradius Gaiden, another great horizontal scrolling shooter for the PSX converted to an E-Boot.PBP file so u can play it on your PSP...

I tested this game on my PSP E-1004 Custom Firmware 6.60 PRO B10...

for people who don`t know what to do with this file:

unrar the file, hook up the PSP to your computer/laptop and copy the map SLPM86042

to the map called: PSP/GAME  on the memorycard of your PSP..

u should have PSP/GAME/SLPM86042 now..

disconnect the PSP and enjoy the game...

please leave a comment if the game works or not and please let people know what firmware u are on so the know what they download is working for them...

please seed...

thank u for downloading and seeding...
