One of the best vertical scrolling shooters for the playstation-one converted to an Eboot.PBP file so u can play it on your PSP,

I tested it on my PSP E-1004 with firmware 6.60 PRO B10

for people who dont know where to put the file:

unrar the file and put the map called SLPS02056 on your memorystick of your PSP on this location: PSP/GAME

when copied u should have: PSP/GAME/SLPS02056

disconnect the PSP and play the game, if the game is loaded Press the home button to set the game to fullscreen and once u play the game u can add extra credits by pressing SELECT.

This is my first upload so please let me know if something is wrong with it.

oh yeah and please seed...
