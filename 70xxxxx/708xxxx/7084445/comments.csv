[V],TvTeam,2012-03-07T22:20Z,"exp_13, Nope !
AVI is there also. you can download AVI uploads."
,exp_13,2012-03-07T22:34Z,Got a link? I can only seem to find 2 TvTeam mkv releases and 2 sceneline mp4 releases. mkv is great but avi plays on everything.
,exp_13,2012-03-07T22:50Z,Where? I went through TvTeam's uploaded list and there is only 2 mkv releases. 
,we_r_nd,2012-03-10T03:05Z,"Where are the avi file copies of things??  I know others are more compact, but I prefer the 175mb / 350mb avi shows over random mp4."
,we_r_nd,2012-03-10T03:23Z,"What happen TvTeam??  You where my go to, but now everything you put up is random sized mkv or mp4.  Get back to the normal sized 175 / 220 / 350 mb avi files for tv shows!!  Avi plays on everything."
