   Good Night Good Morning is a black and     
   white, split-screen, conversation film     
   about two strangers sharing an all-night   
   phone call on New Year's night in New      
   York City. Writer-Director Sudhish Kamath  
   tries to discover good old fashioned love  
   and romance in a technology-driven mobile  
   world as the boy driving from New York to  
   Philadelphia with buddies after a wild     
   night out of drinking, calls the enigmatic 
   girl alone in her hotel after a brief      
   encounter at the bar. An all-night phone   
   call becomes a surreal, dream-like         
   experience especially when the limited     
   validity of the adventure gives you the    
   freedom to be who you want to be. Anonymity
   could be comforting and such a situation   
   could lead to an unlikely romance. Or      
   something like it.
