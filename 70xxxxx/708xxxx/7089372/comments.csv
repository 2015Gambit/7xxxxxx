how about what all is saved. like who survived, who was romanced in ME1/ME2, how the citadel fared, etc.
i imagine fake bullshit or you'd have posted the facts."

I'm just trying to help those who have not played ME2, if not like the torrent, do not download it."

I did not have any relationship with any of the crew of Normandi. I'm trying to help those who have not played ME2, or did not keep your save games. If you do not like the torrent file, not download it."
