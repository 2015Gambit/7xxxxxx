Ekatarina Velika (Serbian Cyrillic: ╨ò╨║╨░╤é╨░╤Ç╨╕╨╜╨░ ╨Æ╨╡╨╗╨╕╨║╨░, English: Catherine the Great), sometimes referred to as EKV for short, was a Serbian and former Yugoslav rock group from Belgrade, being one of the most successful and influential music acts coming out of former Yugoslavia.

Initially called Katarina II (Serbian Cyrillic: K╨░╤é╨░╤Ç╨╕╨╜╨░ II, English: Catherine II), the band had built up a devoted following that greatly intensified and expanded after the death of its frontman Milan Mladenovi─ç in 1994, which caused the band to dissolve. The group's core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenovi─ç, keyboardist Margita Stefanovi─ç and bassist Bojan Pe─ìar, with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods.
