,saint84,2012-03-09T17:33Z,"overrated movie , total crap . does not deserve 5 oscars . only if you are a rich jew who control hollywood critics and studios ."
,CCWGGuy,2012-03-10T16:26Z,"So wait, when they show the title cards when they speak are those in English?  "
,mt_phile,2012-03-10T16:52Z,"The 'title cards' that they show when they speak are in French.  The subs mentioned in the description are in English.

The movie is great, this rip is great."
,duriotic,2012-03-10T17:14Z,"We APPRECIATE your fast and helpful responses, so please don't be annoyed when I ask for clarification--I'm just trying to determine how disrupting the French overlays are--do the English subs completely cover them up?  Or do we lose some screen real estate to them?  Do they interfere with the readability of the Eng subs?  (Are the subs only on title cards, or during the main action shots?)

This is a BIG DL and I want to be sure before I take this instead of waiting for an English-oriented one.  Thanks so much!"
,srperdido777,2012-03-12T19:03Z,"Are there spanish subs anywehere?

v-9

Gave it a 9 becuase it is a weird resolution. But still looks great even when widened with MPclassic

Thanx"
