Episode/Not too bad
Thanks VTV"
,we_r_nd,2012-03-10T03:36Z,"You too VTV???  eztv, TvTeam and others dependables are all going to the annoying mkv or mp4!!!!  Stick to the 175 / 220 / 350 mb AVI format for tv shows, it plays on everything!!  

ettv is the only guy  putting them up it seems."
,powium,2012-03-10T04:06Z,"Thankyou! for providing this torrent free to the community, in whichever format you as the uploader decide."
,EbilPhish,2012-03-10T09:09Z,"Stop bitching about the format change.

There is no reason the rest of us have to put up with lower quality video and higher filesizes just because you can't be bothered to either update your hardware or convert the files (There's probably a program you can get that will automatically run when they finish downloading).

Ditching the old AVI/xvid format should have happened ages ago. I personally would have preferred mkv but mp4 does make sense since it plays on more."
,froznstuf,2012-03-11T00:12Z,Keep mp4
,jamie007,2012-03-11T06:45Z,"Thanks so much anyway, but WHY MP4?? Not all of us want to watch TV shows hunched over a computer desk. AVI plays on everything. MP4 and MK4 play on nothing."
,desmond722,2012-03-12T22:47Z,"to convert files use FormatFactory, its free and awesome, supports ALL video formats"
,JeffRelf,2012-03-13T10:03Z,"MP4 is higher quality and smaller; I'm loving it, thanks guys."
,SammoSammy,2012-03-13T10:11Z,"Never playing files on anything other than the computer with VLC master race. 

Upload it as a fucking gif with an attached MP3 at 64kb/s for all I care. It's free. 

PS. Please don't do that"
,c0ldpr0xy,2012-03-15T18:17Z,Damn these spoiled kids. Just download VLC player! It plays everything without a single error! MP4 have higher quality with less file size! You have to be an idiotic moron to not like it.
,d3bing,2012-03-15T20:15Z,"Keep MP4, that is marvelous! Better quality and smaller file size... plus it does play on everything - Mac, Windows, PS3 and iTunes... what else do you need? Thanks community, love the mp4 change!"
,uberjuice,2012-03-25T23:49Z,"Terrible audio,  not synched again. Thanks for the poor attempt."
,98573459834,2012-03-27T20:46Z,"thanks for the quality downloads as always!  
keep mp4, no need to convert for my ipad anymore.  "
