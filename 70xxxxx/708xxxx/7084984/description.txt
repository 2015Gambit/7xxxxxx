Game information:

Live the rags to riches story with your Sims while being connected to  your
friends! Experience the rise to stardom as your Sim performs on stage  from
from one venue to the next. And for the first time,  The  Sims  3  Showtime
introduces social features, including SimPort, an all-new feature that lets
you send your Sims to a friend's game! There, your Sim can perform at  your
friend's venue in front of your friend's Sims! You will  also  be  able  to
chat with friends and post messages and screenshots on your friends' walls.

Features:

* Your Sims can live the dream as Singers, Performers, Magicians,
and DJs. Watch them rise to fame-or go down in flames as
they perform for other Sims.
* All-new social features: chat with friends, post to their
walls, give status updates, and create friends lists
* Send your Sims to a friend's game and have your friend's

performance and career progression.
