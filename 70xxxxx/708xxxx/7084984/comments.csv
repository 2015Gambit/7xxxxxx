,Dunder92,2012-03-16T21:33Z,"It has a crack, but it does not seem to work. When I try to start the game with the crack I get the following error message ""Servicestart failed (0x0175dcbb)"".

But when I start the game without the crack I get into the game, but it says it's not verified and I get thrown out."
,Dunder92,2012-03-16T21:39Z,"Oh, I found out how to fix it. I copied the crack to the original Sims 3 folder > game > bin

Then I started it from there, and it worked with no problems."
,Hiruwolf,2012-03-18T18:50Z,"There siims to be some kind of error in this, since I don't have any of showtime traits or lifetime awards. Also the tree of prosperity doesn't work."
,MsCullen,2012-03-25T00:16Z,"Works Perfect...
Had a few probs at first, after I kept getting the message that it could not verify that it was genuine, and asked me to contact customer service...
Well, fuck customer service... The internet is its own customer service and after a bit of searching I found out all you have to do is.....
....... copy the crack and the .dll file again and go into your installation folder and paste them there. Just delete the files 'TSLHost.dll and TS3W' from the original 'The Sims 3' Folder and replace with the cracked ones. 
i.e don't load up the game until you've copied the crack again. 
worked for me....
Hope this helps people with the same problem. Peace Bitches x"
,krazyany,2012-04-12T18:29Z,so i keep getting a notification saying they can not verify my game please contact costumer service. well i did everything like i was suppose to according to what MsCullen posted n still go the same thing help! i am also new at this stuff a step by step guide for dummies will help :D thnks oh n by the way i have no crack file or .dll file :(
