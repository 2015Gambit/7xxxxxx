,sahilrox,2012-03-06T05:54Z,@siegeh You need to first join all the parts of 95mb using a file joiner.....then mount it!!!!
,sahilrox,2012-03-06T06:30Z,"The software for joining can be hj split. Its the best one around. Google It People!!!
Btw, i hope this contains English language and i hope i dont have to do anything annoying in this except installing and cracking....Can anyone confirm?"
[V],.Dude.,2012-03-06T07:08Z,"sahilrox: You dont need to join the parts, just extract any 1 part,and it will extract all to give an iso file,mount it --> install game --> copy crack --> play."
,simolino,2012-03-06T07:47Z,"Hey bro your fucken torrent's corrupted bro, 18% availability and it fucken gets a red X after like five minutes...I am dowloading the Extremezone one now, works like a charm. His availability is like 916% or some shit like that. Fix your goddamned torrents or don't upload shit."

,lolipopus,2012-03-06T12:13Z,"What's the difference between this 13 gb version and the 10,5 gb version?"
,abhi6780,2012-03-06T12:45Z,Waked Up after so many days.....
,GObonzo,2012-03-06T16:37Z,magnet links suck. why's extrememzone the only one left with real torrents for download. with these damn magnets you can't choose separately which files to download or which order to download them until after it's already started and filled up all it's needed space.
,kabutowarez,2012-03-06T23:34Z,"THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH for this ""original files/format"" release!!!!!!!
I hate the mess up unrared ones!!"
,kabutowarez,2012-03-06T23:34Z,and yes....the way magnet links work SUCKS!!
