Dear you,

Thanks very much for downloading my album, I hope you enjoy it, and show it to your friends. Although this album is free, you can help me out so much by buying it from here:

I want to show that filesharing doesn't stop artists from selling records, it actually helps. I want to show that people who fileshare aren't freeloaders or criminals, but normal people who are happy to support the artists they like. I also want money.

Aside from the album, I'm always doing new stuff, and you'll find out straight away if we're connected. You can do that in 4 simple steps:

1. Click "like" here:

Lovely. Anyway, my question is - have you bought the album yet?

Let me know.
Love, Dan x
