The vixens of wrestling are back. Sure Rumble Roses XX delivers the visual "enhancements" that you would expect for a next generation game, but this is more than just another pretty face. Get in the ring and unload submission holds, reversals, and an increased number of other new moves to take down your opponent. Go online and team up with another beauty in the all-new Tag Team mode or compete in a free-for-all to determine who is Queen in the all-new Battle Royal mode. Fight fair or fight dirty - humiliation is the name of the game.
