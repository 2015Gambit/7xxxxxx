Gekioh shooter king, one of the best vertical scrolling shooter on the psx...


i converted this game to an E-boot.PBP file so u can play this on your PSP.

i tested the game on my PSP E-1004 custom firmware 6.60 B10..

for the people who dont know what to do with this content:

unrar (extract) the file and copy the map in PSP/GAME of the memorycard of your PSP

Disconnect the PSP and play the game...

it would be nice if u write a comment if something is wrong or not... and please let people know if the game works on other custom firmware`s
