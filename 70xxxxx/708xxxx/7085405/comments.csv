Firstly, i would like to thank you for your generosity and sacrifice. i really appreciate all the time u spend in donating us alll free stuff. Please i have a special request... pls upload Score Magazine (issues- June and October 2011). I really would appreciate it if you grant this wish. All rapidshare i saw online have been taken down. Pls help!. With ur nickname, i am sure we both have similar interests.....Take care and thank u again"

[V],boobsman,2012-03-08T20:40Z,@ soletar sorry mate we share the same interests but i don't upload xxx material n i don't have those magazines :(

,jagb84,2012-03-24T22:02Z,"This one doesn't work with LT 3.0, I wasted 3 Dl- Verbatim on this one. Fail."
,jarldan,2012-04-16T16:13Z,"It doesn't work! I've got LT+ 2.0, did everything the instructions suggest. Even so, ended up wasting 3 discs, too. It probably works with higher flashing/mod versions, though. Not sure... DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
,jarldan,2012-04-16T22:31Z,"Hey, I got a question, just made me wonder. I played Arkham City, the game worked 100%. Isn't this game supposed to work for me as well?"
,Gavincol78,2012-04-17T14:13Z,"FOR THOSE WHO SAY THIS DOESN'T WORK WITH LT 3.0 VERIFY THIS ISO WITH ABGX 1.0.6 IT WILL CORRECT THE TOPOLOGY ERROR AND PASS THE STEALTH TEST BUT IGNORE THE VERIFICATION FAIL. OTHER THEN THAT IT DOES WORK ESPECIALLY BURNT USING A VERBATIM AND iHAS DRIVE NEVER TRUNCATE YOUR XGD3 DISKS.

#BOOBSMAN YOUR A GREAT UPLOADER BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO GET YOUR ISO'S CHECKED WITH ABGX 1.0.6 AND STOP TELLING PEOPLE TO TRUNCATE THEIR DISKS.

THE BEST XGD3 BURNING GUIDE IS http://www.ixtreme.net/open-forum/17835-how-i-burn-xgd3-using-ihas-imgburn-2-5-6-0-verify-using-kprobe-2-a.html"
