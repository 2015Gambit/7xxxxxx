I wonder who the Garbage track might be for. He He.

@beaujoulais, I couldn't find the track you put on my Angelfish torrent. Is it definately available?"
,beaujoulais,2012-03-07T22:31Z,"Hey guys, you're so fantastic - both of !!!
The Angelfish clips - 1 photo video from ""Anonymous"" and 1 from ""jumpingphil"" are still saved in my archive and both of in seed, too.
Sometimes I'm actually fighting with my dl s/w - something changed to former handling through the magnetic links. But it works and normally I'm only downloading clips but no CD, DVD or BRD. It's because of very strict German laws and big brother is watching us ...  :o) but it's OK. 
I'm really proud about your friendship and your support. Would like to drink some bottles of beer with you, guys. 
Cheers & cu soon again, beaujoulais"
,beaujoulais,2012-03-07T22:43Z,"Dear all, my Garbage favourite is 
""The trick is to keep breathing"", 
but from this song, there are nearly no live takes available. Does one of you have one ore more live clips from this great song ? If so, I'd be once again happy. I'd put some bottles of cold and delicios German beer in my seed for you,

PS: dl torrent ""Russian elections"" for looking how the US Rebulicans get selected their candidate against Obama."
,jumpingphil,2012-03-07T23:02Z,"@ Beaujoulais, I was working for Pitney Bowes in Heppenheim for 4 days every week for 2 years in 1995 and 1996. I used to stay in the Halber Mond Hotel.
Was that anywhere near where you live?"
,jumpingphil,2012-03-07T23:31Z,"@ Beaujoulais, I now have 2 torrents, check out the new one."
,beaujoulais,2012-03-07T23:36Z,"Hi Phil, nice - Heppenheim os only about 150 miles away from my home.
I live close to Friedrichshafen, at Lake of Constance. It's direct to the borderline of Switzerland and Austria and pretty close to the Alps. I like freeride skiing very much.
Our region is well known for the Zeppelins, the huge Dornier Do X airplane (Water Jumbo) and the Mercedes / Maybach cars and engines.
You're from the US, I see through your IP address. What region you come from and what favourite hobby you have in addition to music ?"
