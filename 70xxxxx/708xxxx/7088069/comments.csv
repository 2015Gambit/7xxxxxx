Stop uploading SDTV in HDTV please."
,machspee,2012-03-09T09:13Z,"wtf......why go to such great lengths as to compress a file and splitting it using a software? 

Don't you think it is a waste of time on your part and  for others who download it?"
,Evilution,2012-03-09T14:10Z,"There is an actual 720p HDTV release of the show.
Just 1 mkv, no rar.
Not been uploaded on TPB as i think there been some downtime... but search for Person.of.Interest.S01E17.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION on Torrentz dot eu"
