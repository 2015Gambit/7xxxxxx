Good audience recording of the real "Speak Of The Devil" album, with mistakes and all. As many ozzy fans know speak of the devil wasn't really live. Most of ozzy's vocals were recorded in studio due to voice problems he had during the two shows. Also Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was recorded in soundcheck so that means it was recorded live in the studio with corrected vocals is what I'm assuming. Pretty cool to hear this. Also you can hear the real in between song banter not the PG shit they add to the albums!
