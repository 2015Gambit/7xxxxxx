,Contagi,2012-03-06T22:30Z,"Thanks, I'd been trying for ages to download this via their site"
,itlivz,2012-03-07T00:57Z,I got banned and i cant use my store acct anymore  :( please upload later versions when they come out
,witeken,2012-03-07T15:15Z,"@itlivz or should I say Aliv3.
You fucking noob. It's your own fault, cracking KSP. 

@owner of this torrent
REMOVE THIS SHIT
If you want people to buy KSP, stop giving them the game. You noob get a life, pirating an INDIE GAME!!!!!! 
You should better pirate The Sims 3. 

@all the others who think they are cool downloading a 15 USD indie game:
Buy the fucking game. Trust me: It's awesome. There is no need to test it out. "
,itlivz,2012-03-07T18:20Z,"Excuse me? i got banned for sharing my purchased copy with other people who bought the game, only an idiot would pirate this game, well until now because i'm forced to"
,Contagi,2012-03-08T09:04Z,"@witeken

I do own the game, because I think KSP is wonderful and the devs need every cent they can get. Unfortunately, until this came out, I was unable to *download the fucking game I paid for*"
,overlord1123,2012-03-11T14:31Z,"Hey guys,

this game is made by a small development team and needs your support to develope the game further.
you can download the demo for free and it is olso fun.
if you like the demo please buy the game.
i bought it and i think the deserve the money for making such a game.
do you have any idea how hard it is to make such game with all that physics?"
,Zer0MARU,2012-03-13T17:08Z,"@witeken
unfortunately for me
15 USD = 30 R$
and i dont thin i really fell like paying that for an indie game when i can get a game like sins of a solar empire for 31,89 R$"
,Zer0MARU,2012-03-13T17:11Z,"@witeken
oh and i forgot to mention
Sins trinity for 31,89R$"
,Sean2323,2012-03-14T22:45Z,"I am very sorry about having to torrent this, but I couldn't buy it do to paypal being a fucking asshole, once any other payment method is added to KSP, I will pay the measly 15.28 Cdn for the game."
,DragonHealRx,2012-03-24T13:01Z,"@witeken
how about you shut the fuck up. who are you to say who should take this down. maybe theres people who really want the game and cant afford it. in reality they only need maybe $2 a game to make a profit, the other $13 if extra profit. so it really doesnt hurt them all that much if a few people torrent there game. if you knew anything about game development you would know that"
,Barbazulada,2012-03-27T03:30Z,"Thank you for sharing!

Actually, if I would payed 15$ and found the part
menu almost empty I would smashed the screen..."
,0rochimaru,2012-04-17T10:19Z,"To the whiners:

Those who pirate habitually will not pay for the game anyway.  Those who would pay for the game, will.  And those cannot afford it should still be given the opportunity to try it.

So STFU to all the indie dev bleeding hearts.  They're not losing anything, effectively."
,0rochimaru,2012-04-17T11:03Z,"Game works fine - just extract and play (Win7).

This version can also be copy-pasted over existing MODDED games and updated that way also."
,Timbo6669,2012-04-21T04:30Z,"OMG..LOL.. You guys are morally high and mighty and talking about it on the ""PIRATE"" bay.. If the game is good, i MIGHT buy it...."
,lolzonyourface,2012-05-18T02:15Z,Can you please torrent 0.15? it is out today. By the way this torrent works perfectly ^^
,kevinyan417,2012-05-18T16:29Z,Could anyone upload version 15 by any chance? Thx in advance
,cjwolfer,2012-05-27T20:17Z,Any chance on .15 anytime soon?
,DarkV123,2012-06-03T00:50Z,"I like the game and if I could I would buy it. But I can't mainly because I don't have a credit card, a paypal or stuff like that and I kinda feel bad for this but I will get it the first moment I can"
