This is a website introducing new linux users and old to HUminity and HUMANity, linux remasters based on Unity-linux with an Enlightenment e17 desktop with Ecomorph. It uses lower resources than some of the other desktop managers, and has some beautiful themes available.
Unity is a very nice linux distro imho which is why I chose it, and reasonably user friendly for new linux users, it has a helpful forum and irc chat channel if you need help, or just wish to introduce yourself, or make any comments.
The HUMANity x86_64 bit iso is similar to the i586 version, though has slightly newer e17 pkgs, (March 2012) and the newer kernel 3.2.9 the 64 bit version does not have the sys/sound though, it has a few more e17 themes, and features AgustΓÇÖs Angelic unity theme like the i586 version from February the apps are similar to the i586 version though not exactly the same.
