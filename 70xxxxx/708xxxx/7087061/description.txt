SpeedFan is the software for you if you want to reduce the speed of your fan on the radiator for the CPU and thus reduce the noise produced by your PC
This small useful software will show you the temperature, fan speed of cooler and much useful information.

SpeedFan works under Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, 2003, XP, Vista and Windows 7. SpeedFan works fine on 64 bit too. The relevant driver is now signed with my digital certificate.

If you are trying to figure out why your PC hangs when under heavy load or after some hours of usage, SpeedFan might help you find the real cause. Very often it is a poor power supply, or an improperly installed heatsink that lead to behaviours that we tend to associate (incorrectly) with errors from the operating system. SpeedFan automatically searches your computer for informative chips: the hardware monitor chips.

SpeedFan can display voltages, fan speeds and temperatures. On rare occasions, the BIOS doesnΓÇÖt activate such features. SpeedFan tries to enable them as long as this is a safe thing to do. Not only the motherboard is searched, but also some video cards and almost every currently sold hard disk. SpeedFan can access status info from EIDE, SATA and even SCSI drives, consistently showing internal data that can be used to diagnose current and future hard disk failures. This is known as S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology).
