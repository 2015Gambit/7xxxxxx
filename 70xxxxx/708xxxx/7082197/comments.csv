,starzulu,2012-03-18T23:29Z,Many Thanks for this.. I've been waiting since the dinosaurs roamed the earth for this one. Richard Burton is absolutely fantastic and for me kick's Olivier's butt as an actor. That said Olivier's Hamlet is still kick ass if not [to some] the best. Once again many thanks...
,starzulu,2012-03-19T00:57Z,Just watch it and I'm somewhat dissapointed. The video is of poor quality as with the sound ...My search goes on...
[V],johnefp,2012-03-29T20:13Z,"How about seeing it? Granted, the film quality here is not up to the standards of a modern audience. First of all, this is a recording of an actual Broadway performance and not a true film so the lighting is bad and there aren't as many close-ups as one would expect in a movie. But the darkness and black and white filming actually give the show a moodiness appropriate to the story of Hamlet. Still, there are moments where facial expressions are difficult to make out because of distance and lighting; however, there are also moments of extreme beauty."
