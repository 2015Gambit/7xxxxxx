Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing [Old Grey Whistle Test 1978].VOB



HQ "The Old Grey Whistle Test" 1978 tv show live performance video from a DVD. "Sultans of Swing" was the first single release of the rock band Dire Straits. It was first recorded as a demo at Pathway Studios, North London, and quickly acquired a following after it was put on rotation at Radio London.

The song was originally released in May 1978 but did not chart. Following re-issue in January 1979, the song entered the American music pop chart. Unusually, the success of this single release came more than six months after the relatively unheralded release of the band's debut album in October 1978. BBC Radio was unwilling to play the song due to its high lyrical content; after it became a U.S. hit, their line softened. The song reached the top 10 in both the UK and the U.S., reaching number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and helped drive sales of the album, which also became a hit. 

I would like to add that i think Mark Knopfler's guitar performance in this video is better than the studio recorded version. With his amazing spot on guitar solo work, and an all around top notch performance throughout the whole song, it's easy to see that he has to be one of the best guitar players of all time!

*My previous upload of this performance was from a VHS transfer, but this is from a DVD, so when i played them both side by side, the VHS version was very blurry and had lower quality audio. Hope you enjoy this HQ version as much as i do :)
