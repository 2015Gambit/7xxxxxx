,almostD,2012-03-09T12:51Z,"I just checked the PUP file with Custom Firmware Validator and it says it's original firmware 4.11.

If you succeed to install it you will have upgraded your ps3 to OF 4.11 (wich is bad since we are trying to downgrade to 3.55!)

What do people earn putting this Bullshit on the net?

[T],Heterodox,2012-03-22T20:54Z,This shit actually doesn't work? 
,Itachi_1s_alive,2012-03-25T06:00Z,"@Gouravy41: In my country *Iran* If you pay 100 us they downgrade your ps3 to 3.55, When I ask for more detail They saying ""We use multi cracking In your hardware and In your software, Downgrade your Ps3 bios(Or something like that) And then Run actual CFW, However I Use Blu-ray For now and don't pay them to crack my ps3, Lol."
,retx,2012-04-01T16:20Z,Visit sites like ps3hax so that atleast you have an idea if there is really a new cfw being released.
,esa40,2012-04-27T04:03Z,"What is this FAKE,,,If so then why not been removed ???"
,Mureren4000,2012-05-03T13:56Z,"IT'S SO FUCKING FAKE !!!  THERE ARE NOT CFW OVER 3.55 !!  
DON'T INSTALL IT - THIS IS A OFC 4.11 FIRMWARE !!!"
,Qub1,2012-05-03T21:28Z,"I'm sorry but everyone saying that its fake are just plain leeching retards.

You guys actually thought you needed to type the Passward- part? Then you lack brains, my friend.
The password is simply ps3new411

,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-05-08T08:48Z,"If you install this you're an idiot. We don't need any more custom firmwares, just buy the true blue and play the new games, easy."
,exofreak,2012-05-28T11:20Z,fake please ppl dont download this it will spoil your ps3
,Psychoticus,2012-06-01T11:52Z,Firstly this is not CFW (Custom Firmware) it IS OFW (Original Firmware). I installed it and it did upgrade me to 4.11 and everything seems fine so far but it didn't jailbreak my PS3.
,memooo,2012-06-03T20:35Z,"CAN ANYONE CONFIRM THIS
IF ITS NOT WORKING PIRATEBAY PLZ REMOVE IT"
,SmAcKa21,2012-06-17T08:25Z,you are such a fucking loser. 
,mistarz,2012-06-25T18:16Z,"Well it works on a fat modell.But just in the first stage in the update it passes thru phase 1 and @the second stage the actually install where you see the black background it says the latest system software is already installed.

So I'm on OFW 4.11 maybe thats why it doesn't work.Anny suggestions???

M"
,swallowitsony,2012-07-02T04:23Z,No it doesn't work on the fat model either. I tried. I don't know where you got the idea that it's working on the fat model. It's really a fake.
,mistarz,2012-07-02T20:08Z,"@swallowitsony 

Well i tryd it on my FAT...and as i said its running try the first case go the install aka from xmb....and does not work on the second stage of the install aka black screen the finally install.

M"
,mistarz,2012-07-02T20:11Z,"OK maybe a bit confusing...but actually it doesn't install fully it gets stuck at the second stage of the install.BUT it works half way try 4.11 OFW on a FAT ps3.

PS: i tried it.

M"
,coleix,2012-08-14T01:09Z,"Lol, this is funny, even the guy that upload it says is fake and you guys keep downloading this, this is OFW 4.11 so it just puts you in normal $ony 4.11 update.
Stop Seeding This."
,garemur,2012-08-16T02:57Z,"If the shit sucking UL says he hasn't even tried it ,let alone he doesn't even own a PS3 and admits that it's a FAKE then why is this garbage still here. Come TPB get rid of this shit and ban this sister,mother,aunt,grandmotherfucker for good."
