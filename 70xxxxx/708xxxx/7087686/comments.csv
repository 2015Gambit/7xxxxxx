,PoppaChubbie,2012-05-07T09:38Z,"This works just fine on win7 x64. It DOES fit on one single-layer DVD: Make sure u use DVD-R, not DVD+R. This is 4.7 gig which is the limit of what u can put on a single-layer DVD. Definitely does fit cos I have the burnt DVD in front of me.
Thanks a lot for this one azaq and of course Fairlight for making it possible."
,PoppaChubbie,2012-05-26T14:21Z,Whoops! I meant 4.37 (forgot the '3') ... much more than exactly 4.38 is too much.
