No one put out a decent OSX Port of Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption, so here it is.

I've patched it upto v1.1 so no crashing at the bishop scene. 

Played on MAX graphics settings on my 2007 Macbook white

2.2ghz
4gm ram
X3100 GMA
Takes about 1.5gb hdd space

CD Key: RAC2-SAL2-GAT3-RAD3-6545

Taken from Windows version, wrapped in Wineskin, Patched from 1.0 -> 1.1, cracked to run without CD2. 

Instructions to play.

1. Unzip Vampire.App
2. Place in Applications folder
3. Run Vampire.App
4. Slay demons, suck blood and Enjoy!


Thanks
