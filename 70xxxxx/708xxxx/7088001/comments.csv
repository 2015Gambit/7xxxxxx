Not tested on any other system, however wrapper instructions suggest 10.7 should be good too."

,chaddi22,2012-03-27T20:23Z,agree with treehugga... display on 10.7 sucks! is there any workaround?
,Treehugga,2012-04-01T22:38Z,"TEMPORARY FIX for anyone with graphical issues:
-press CMD+OPTION+A while the game is running and it will go into windowed mode. At the menu, you can set the resolution to your desktop resolution and it will fill most of the screen.

videos will mess it up, but just press CMD+OPTION+A whenever you run into trouble."
