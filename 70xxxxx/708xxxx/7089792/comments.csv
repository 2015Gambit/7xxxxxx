,earth3,2012-03-11T07:15Z,@lisa could you start the game?
,earth3,2012-03-11T07:19Z,"@lisa reinstall the game and make a shortcut to desktop with file path like thi
""C:Program filesME3Binariesmasseffect3exe"" -nomoviestartup
inside the quotes is your file path for exe and nomoviestartup should be typed after leaving a space
this will start the game without movies if it starts
try running this fix twice again"

,ovnoglavi,2012-03-13T15:34Z,"@ earth3

I've tryed that fix from safelink location and... NO GO!!! I don't think we have a bitrate problem, cause the Bioware intro shows OK... It's something else! 
I tried downloading that fsutil.exe, but I don't know where to find it... It allways redirect me to some windows recovery site...
Please, provide us with a link to this fsutil.exe, and pray you tell where to put that file!!!
Again, thank you in advance!!!"
