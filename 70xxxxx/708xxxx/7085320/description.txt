Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, March 7 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex concentrates on the foregone conclusion that the U.S. and Israel will attack Iran over its imaginary nuclear weapons program and touch off a Third World War that will deal the global economy a final death blow. 

Alex also talks about Senator John McCain's call for bombing Syria and arming the so-called rebels amassed to overthrow Syrian leader al-Assad. 

In the third hour of today's show, Alex talks with Jon Corbett of the popular blog TSA Out of Our Pants! Corbett posted a video yesterday that demonstrates how the TSAΓÇÖs radiation firing body scanners can easily be bypassed. 

Although not billed on the web site, Alex also talks with Eric "Mancow" Meuller [end of hour 2, 1st half of hour 3].

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
