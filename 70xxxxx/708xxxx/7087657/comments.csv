DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS!!!! Here, or anywhere!

Yes, SILENCE, IS COMPLICITY, HOWEVER...

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER DIRECT ATTENTION TO, AT, TOWARD... THE DENIALISTS. It is what they live for. It is what they live ON, like leaches live on blood. They have no more interest in getting to the Truth than Hitler's propagandist Goebbels did.

If you ever comment BECAUSE of something they've said,
AND YOU SHOULD, YOU MUST, do it for the ONLOOKERS, those that are confused, misinformed, or uninformed.

SILENCE IS COMPLICITY!!!! Criminal!

However, DIRECTING ATTENTION (RESPECT) TO A DENIER,
IS CRIMINAL STUPIDITY. 1. Bleeds your time and energy; 2. Feeds the Animals; 3. CONFUSES THE ONLOOKERS - THEY TAKE IT AS A SHOW OF RESPECT TO THE DENIALISTS!

DON'T DO IT. "

Summary 

ANDRILL, a scientific project launched to detail climate change after a 200 meter-thick ice shelf collapsed into the ocean off the Antarctic Peninsula in 2002, is explored, including footage and interviews with scientific experts. 

Main Argument: 
Due to human's mass CO2 producing, causing green house effect, causing global warming... the anartica ice is melting, sea level is rising and cities will be covered by water... 

Evidence: 
Earth has been through numerous times of global warming, ice melting and rising sea level without human intervention, because either life we know of does not exist or life we know of had not evolved to Homo Sapein yet. 

Stupid counter argument by me: 
Past global warmings were caused by Aliens' mass CO2 producing, causing green house effect, causing global warming... the anartica ice was melting multiple times, sea level was rising multiple times and aliens civilizations were covered by water multiple times... 

So we need to look for Aliens who had been causing earth's past mass CO2 producing, causing green house effect, causing global warming to justify blaming homo sapein's current mass CO2 producing, causing green house effect, causing global warming. 

Or we don't have any fxxking idea what causes/caused global warming and stop making bloody stupid blaming games.

Some possible causes of prior global warming events: Earth's position in relation to the sun, volcanic/seismic activity, meteor/comet activity, and the explosion of various biodiversity.

,drymoused,2012-03-13T18:29Z,The scientific evidence for human-caused global climate change is obvious for anyone with critical thinking skills. Only an idiot or a mouthpiece for corporate polluters would suggest otherwise. Do get a clue.

,AlexLibman,2012-07-03T03:23Z,"UnviolentPeacemaker's comments are a great example of the anti-intellectual tactics used by the alarmists.

They are losing their ability to fake and misrepresent the actual data; thought-terminating cliches is all they have left.  They must never allow anyone to hear the other side of the story, the debunking of their tricks, because any critically-thinking individual who ventures outside of their bubble will clearly see them as Lysenko-esque politically-motivated power-hungry liars.  The ""global warming"" story was created precisely for this reason - communists could no longer have total thought control due to intergovernmental competition, and needed to create a justification for a world government with which there would no frame of reference and no escape.

A few decades from now this AGW religious hysteria will come to pass, as hundreds like it have throughout human history.  Reasonable people will ignore the green thugs and continue to move civilization forward.  Human beings will irrigate the deserts and export all energy production / mining / manufacturing to space.  This will not happen because of the alarmists' political power, but in spite of it.  Sooner or later, free minds, free science, and free markets will prevail!"
,AlexLibman,2012-07-22T06:33Z,"Finally found the time to see it...  The beautiful footage makes this a very enjoyable watching experience - minus of course the obvious political bias and the unscientific tendency to jump to conclusions.  I guess video of ice caps slowly growing (as they cyclically do every autumn, and during the colder end of various other natural cycles) wouldn't have made very good video...  

A genuine scientist without a political agenda would tell you that the temperature data that we have is insufficient to even conclude whether the alleged fraction-of-a-degree warming for the past century is a scientific fact.  If it is, the cause is far from certain.  There are many natural cycles in this solar system that we are only beginning to understand, some of which may take hundreds or even thousands of years to play out (i.e. far predating the ability of modern science to reliably observe them).  And if the anthropogenic theory is indeed validated (which is quite a long-shot), what the exact consequences would be and what government intrusions are justified would remain an open question.

A real scientist would know when to say ""we don't know"".  Unfortunately most people who become climatologists do so because of an agenda - they're tree-huggers on a mission, and the billions of people whose lives are made possible due to industry are not their first concern.  Without AGW, they would be flipping burgers instead!

Their projections into the future are bullshit.  It reminds me of the infamous quote that ""everything that can be invented has been invented"" (attributed to US Patent Office commissioner Charles Duell).  If you think about it logically, the future impact of the human civilization should ultimately produce a lowering effect on the sea levels, and an overall long-term decrease in CO2 in the planet's atmosphere.  There are many energy sources in this vast universe - fossil fuels are just a very brief stepping stone that we won't need for much longer.  We humans can irrigate the deserts (which in the coming centuries would be done on a massive scale, with many a Las Vegas appearing in the middle of Sahara), we desalinate and pump water inland for pools and other conveniences, we plant crops that convert CO2, we manage forests for optimal growth, we can even build floating fields in the middle of an ocean and concentrate solar power build multi-story greenhouses in the polar regions!  As technology advances, it is inevitable that cleaner technologies will dominate, and all energy, industry, and mining will eventually be exported into space.

All this will happen not because of government intervention, but in spite of it - all that the free market requires is defense of Property Rights, which includes paying for liabilities like pollution."
,skyvillage,2012-08-17T13:05Z,"There is more carbon in our atmosphere today than at any time since the dawn of man--far more.  If we continue down this path, we will render this planet into something completely hostile and alien to human life."
,shamanist,2012-08-28T07:10Z,I am so proud of AlexLibman for getting up on his hind legs. Now if only he could get past the braying...
,AlexLibman,2012-09-24T08:46Z,"skyvillage:

I suggest you study 6th grade chemistry and learn to differentiate elements like ""carbon"" (C) and compounds like Carbon Dioxide (CO2).  When talking about greenhouse gases, we are talking about CO2 (3% of emissions of which are man-made), Methane (CH4, 18% man-made), Nitrous Oxide (N20, 5% man-made), and several other gases - all of which are produced by man in relatively tiny quantities and for a relatively tiny duration of time.

You also need to understand (as much as Al Gore would hate this) the difference between ""cause"" and ""effect"".  CO2 increases naturally follow several centuries after temperature increases, and the timing of when humans started to develop an advanced civilization has coincided with favorable warmer climates.  CO2 concentrations worldwide currently average about 400 parts per million - yes, they rose higher as we exited the last ice age (and the measurement for more ancient past is very inaccurate), with a very tiny contribution from man.

The benefits of having an industrial civilization are overwhelming, and higher CO2 concentrations are a benefit in of themselves due to a little something called photosynthesis.  Alarmist commies are yet to present any factual evidence that our small contribution of greenhouse gases has influenced past temperature, and that this influence would be negative - much less that giving them totalitarian power would solve the problem without doing a greater harm!

All of those gases are pollutants and can constitute a financial liability to those who produce them, as a Property Rights issue, but all talk of a ""global crisis"" remains wild politically-motivated fear-mongering that comes nowhere close to being substantiated by actual science.  The human civilization's addition of atmospheric CO2 can be easily offset, and by the end of this century it will decline into insignificance due to the inevitable technologies I've mentioned above.  The ""crisis"" your politicians use to manipulate you into giving them power simply doesn't exist!
