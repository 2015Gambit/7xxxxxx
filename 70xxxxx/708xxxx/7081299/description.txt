Deathspell Omega's complete discography.
These are all 320kbps MP3s that were transcoded from FLAC.
All albums aside from the following are vinyl ripped:
[2001] Split with Moonblood
[2005] From Entrails to the Dirt
[2008] Mass Grave Aesthetics
[2011] Diabolus Absconditus
These albums are sourced from the CD, as the Vinyl was unavailable. 
Diabolus Absconditus is also found on Crushing the Holy Trinity, which is a vinyl rip.
The vinyl versions of these albums sound much better than their CD counterparts, as they do not have the "loudness war" dynamic compression that is common in modern metal music.
I will be updating this torrent when new releases arrive, and I will be seeding this torrent on a 35mbps upstream until is sufficiently seeded.
