,Frenetus,2012-03-07T22:46Z,Yeah Thanks o
,Frenetus,2012-03-07T23:30Z,"Ah i just read what you said PHR.
It is no Problem for me to wait, in fact i could have watched it days ago, the reaons why i am waiting is the amazing quality that comes from this ""ZR"" Guy.
I appreciate your uploading, but encoding is one very difficult subject and one does not simply understand it just like that so i think it would be better if you keep up with that ""ZR"" Guy ;)."
,THEBADGUY1988,2012-03-08T15:56Z,"Thanks for another great episode PHR!
Awesome quality and sound as always!"
,ZR_,2012-03-08T20:09Z,"Wow... I did NOT realize that someone wanted my CC encodes so badly. Never thought to check TPB for ponies, anyway.

Sorry for any problems I might have caused: this episode was actually ""released"" last Sunday, but of course my random uploads might be hard to find, since I don't advertise them at all.

PHR, pls let me have an email address or something to contact you. As you probably already guessed, I'm too paranoid about this to leave contact info around."

*fanboy squeal*  CAN IT BE?!?  :D

""I did NOT realize that someone wanted my CC encodes so badly.""
Your re-encodes have corrected colours, and though they are over 250 MB smaller per file than iTunes, have no more significant artifacts than the originals.  There's also that thing with the iTunes files only being available in the US, YayPonies notwithstanding.
So yeah, we want them.  BADLY.

""Sorry for any problems I might have caused.""
No problems, bro, none at all.  Your uploads aren't hard to find.  Usually what happens is that, once I see the ep. pop up on iTunes, I Google ""pony S02E## mkv"" and wait.
Which is totally fine.  Quality is worth waiting for.

We should probably continue this chat via email or something.  tjk16384 [gmail].  (TPB doesn't have a PM system, does it?  Oh well.)  I'd love to have a discussion about encoding and colour correction and all that.

Oh, and by the way:  THANK YOU, again, for continuing PA's legacy.  *RD salute*"

Anyone else notice that pony torrents have an insane seeding base? Thanks for not being greedy guys."
,M1nt3a,2012-03-09T20:08Z,I've been looking for this torrent everyday since the episode aired so thanks for uploading it. I will seed for a few days.

1080p is not worth it on Ponys.(You only waste disk space with it and it does not improve the quality of the video)
720p is the best solution for this."
