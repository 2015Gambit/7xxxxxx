Encode:
Bluray was nice, just a lot of noise in the video, which is removed now.
Studio audio is from the DVDScreener which i entered back into the russian audio track.
The dvdscreener didnt contain audio for the scene after the end credits so i took the end from the russian audio too.
All in all a very nice release with a studio 5.1 trackmix.
Enjoy
