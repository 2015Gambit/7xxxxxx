[V],Nepotu,2012-03-10T18:26Z,"You're welcome, big man! I'm happy to hearing from you. I don't have one favourite team. I like Koby Bryant, so I like Lakers, I like Heat, Bulls and Dwight Howard, so I like Magic. I like this game and I like soccer (my favourite team is FC Barcelona). Maybe I will stay with Magic. How about that?"
,SoulSeekers,2012-03-13T03:34Z,"Heat, Bulls and Magic that is a great mix of teams they are all winner's I say definitely go with the Magic Or Heat Dwight Howard is a rare player there is no one in the NBA who is like him..They try to compare andrew bynum to howard I don't think that is a good comparison because Bynum is injured every single season..Dwight is better..FC Barcelona is awesome They are known WorldWide I know the soccer matches get heated out there~!!! the amazing spirit of that sport it's amazing!!!! Do you play soccer bro? "
