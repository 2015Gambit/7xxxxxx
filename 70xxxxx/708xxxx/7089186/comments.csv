,just_tex,2012-03-09T15:08Z,apparently I dont know how to work to seed this thing for you guys.  Sorry any advice would be appreciated.  This is my first torrent try. Sorry!
,BigBod,2012-03-09T16:24Z,go to upload torrent in tpb and follow instructions to find torrent you have created in your computer
,just_tex,2012-03-09T18:36Z,"Ok looks like its working (long sigh..) I have fast internet when I am on guys to suck this off but I am only on about 6 hours a day.  Just leave your torrent running is all I can say and it will start when I hit the internet again.  I also tried to post a list of the book titles by author and it would never seem to ""take"" when I hit submit so the list may be to long for a comment sorry.

,just_tex,2012-03-11T00:14Z,I thought it would be cool to have this all in one download but considering my limited time online to seed I might be better breaking it up for you guys
