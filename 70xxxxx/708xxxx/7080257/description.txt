This week with The International Forecaster we discuss: PutinΓÇÖs re-coronation in Russia; the gold and silver market; EuropeΓÇÖs ongoing collapse and the latest moves of the would-be elites. We also reflect on the legacy of Gary Allen, G. Edward Griffin, Stan Monteith, and others who were warning about the New World Order and its machinations decades before the modern Internet-fueled era renaissance in understanding.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
