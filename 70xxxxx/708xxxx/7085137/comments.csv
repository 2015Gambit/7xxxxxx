Oh course they were going to lose a huge amount of business by dropping his show. As they should.

The free market is about individual actors exercising choice."
,thunderbum,2012-03-08T02:05Z,"Rush was saying on his website that several of the advertisers who canceled their contract with Rush have been asking to come back!!! Priceless!!!

Clearing up misinformation on our sponsors:

""Two of the sponsors who have canceled have asked to return.  We are being very careful about that.  Not gonna give you any names here.  One of them is practically begging to come back.  Everything is fine on the business side.  Everything's cool."""

Good job!

,trickdaddy0024,2012-03-08T03:16Z,"Truth be told Rush's show now is very depressing...I mean he sound bitter and he is trying to move on but he is a bitter old man who hates Obama because he believes all this is his fault...Rush Limbaugh you need to look in the mirror...If your show keeps sounding like this than the end is coming soon...END

,Annoyme,2012-03-08T03:21Z,"see!

you can sense the hysterical madness that trickdaddy feels as he realizes the statist leftwing armies can't stop Rush."
,omtcnry,2012-03-08T03:43Z,"trickdaddy, you obviously didn't listen to his show today, which addresses the very advertising issue you speak of.
As far as depression, the only ones with that condition right now are the liberals who have once again failed at taking him down.
Happy Purim!"
,trickdaddy0024,2012-03-08T04:03Z,"@outcry said,""trickdaddy, you obviously didn't listen to his show today""...WTF are you bro...All Rush talked about was Disney, Advertisers, Union, Oil, Obama you know the usual bullshit...But did he ever laugh about anything today? I think not he was serious the whole time...And that is very depressing especially we the media is still talking about this story...And who cares what Rush says about all his advertisers...He lies about 50% of the time about everything...I still waiting on thunerbitch to reveal which advertisers are coming back...Still waiting...END"
