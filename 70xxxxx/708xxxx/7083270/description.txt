This is Update 6 (1.4.27) by Reloaded, only difference being that I compressed it into a .rar archive and popped the latest SKSE version in there. Alot smaller for people with a slow internet connection, or for people who want a portable version.


Info:

This is Skyrim version 1.4.27.

Unzip into Skyrim main folder and overwrite all.

You do not need earlier versions of Skyrim for this update to work.

This comes with the appropriate SKSE version.

This is confirmed to NOT be compatible with any Skyrim Creation Kit before 3/7/2012 (Date that I uploaded this torrent).

Credits go to Reloaded and SKSE team.
