Thanks for the upload tNe."
[T],trialNerror,2012-03-08T21:12Z,"I've never hated x264 because it is an AVC format which does play on PS3, X360, many mobile devices, and now even TV's support it. I have been one to say MKV sucks, though. But that was before I realized how stable and reliable the MKV container was and also how easily and quickly the MKV can be turned into a PS3 / X360 ready MP4.  Seriously only takes a minute and there is absolutely no loss of quality. And like Tone stated, there are now bluray players that can support the format and are easy on the wallet.

I've tried releasing MP4's that play on everything I have, but different people have different stuff and it wouldn't work for them, so I'm sticking with MKV which (most of) nobody has complained about.

I can also get x264 stuff out in a fraction of the time it took me to do a XviD.  Oh, and yeah, there is one show I'm currently releasing as an XviD: Disappeared. That season has been running since before the XviD to x264 change and was going to finish it off how I began it.  Everything else that was new season/series got the x264 encoding.  To be honest I can't wait for Disappeared to be done with so I can stop doing the XviD completely. Unfortunately I think it's like 30 eps a season. Blah.

Not all of ya know where to find me, but I have been mentioning this whole XviD to x264 conversion for a few months now.  Around October of 2011 I was giving people heads up about the swap. I've even shown the quick guide to make the MKV into a MP4 for PS3 / X360 playback a countless number of times.   For the umpteenth time here is that guide: https://kat.ph/blog/trialNerror/post/579/

No joke, it's been said repeatedly for months.  Pardon me if I'm tired of telling the same things over and over like a broken record.  Then to have someone say the videos suck; I suck; need to change now; blah blah blah; yep, fuck ya. 

One day you'll grow to love and appreciate the x264 AVC format and MKV container like I have.

Here's another heads up. There might be some minor changes to releases in the future.  Still x264 AC3 MKV, but different dimensions, sizes, and hopefully a noticeable difference in improved quality."
