The objective of the lubuntu project is to create a faster, more lightweight and energy saving variant of Ubuntu by using LXDE, The Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment, as its default GUI. Members of the lubuntu team take care of LXDE and other packages that are part of the lubuntu installation. Please join us and contribute creating a lighter, less resource hungry and more energy-efficient Linux Desktop. It is our goal to make Linux run on more cost-effective machines and MIDs besides Intel CPUs based on ARM and Mips. Lubuntu received official recognition as a formal member of the Ubuntu family, commencing with Lubuntu 11.10.
