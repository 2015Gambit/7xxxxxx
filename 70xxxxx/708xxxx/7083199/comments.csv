Nobody, not even a government, can stop it.  I'm not condoning it of course....but it's like bailing out the titanic with a tablespoon."
,SpoonyOne,2012-03-08T09:55Z,"not really, they are using lobbyist techniques on the US-government, and with enough numbers in an election year anything could happen.

Question is though: which way is the right way to go? White Man's Burden is ringing in the background and military intervention doesn't ring sweetly. I believe that Jason Russel is very dedicated, but almost in a manic way.

Use your own common sense when watching this movie."

,Cold_Audit,2012-03-11T03:19Z,"Use your common sense .. This is political propaganda aimed at Obama for the 2012 US election.

""InvisibleChildren"" are a front organisation for fundamentalist christians.

Kony was wiped out 7 years ago and is in hiding in the Congo, there are NO abducted child soldiers in Uganda anymore.

But Obama has ordered economic sanctions against the Ugandan government if it passes the anti-homosexual law in late March. This is why US military advisers are being pulled out of Uganda.

In an election year, If Obama goes ahead with his threat to impose sanctions on Uganda, he'll be perceived as favoring the US gay lobby at the expense of black african children.

Well played Republicans, you even got left wing students to spread the propaganda via social media ;-)"
