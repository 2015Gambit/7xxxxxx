This pack contains the subtitles for the following languages:

English
German
Spanish
French
Italian
Polish
Russian

It has been tested on the "Russian only" version of Mass Effect 3 distributed in Russia and the CIS. Unlike other language packs floating around, it actually removes the limitations and restores the language choice functionality found in the complete international version. The pack is compatible with the current DLC, and probably will be compatible with future DLCs and patches. It might work on other game versions with limited language options, too. However, it contains subtitles ONLY and DOES NOT add any voiceover options.
