,tpollo,2012-06-30T08:28Z,I have a legit RU version of ME3 on Origin. I extracted these files into the game's install folder as the instructions said but I still don't see any option to change the language in the in-game menu. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
,QoMSoL,2012-08-03T18:55Z,Guys I'd really appreciate this one for the extended cut cuz now it makes sense.
