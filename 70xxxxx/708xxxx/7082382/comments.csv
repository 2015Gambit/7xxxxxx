,fucklars2,2012-03-10T01:26Z,"Anyone have a keygen?

Plugins are disabled with all the included serial numbers."

,Dannieloco,2012-03-16T14:28Z,"Make sure to run the corekeygen to modify the host file so the adobe servers are blocked from being reached via the internet.

that corekeygen can be found http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6802136/Adobe.Lightroom.3.5.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker (download the torrent for the keygen).

then use the serial provided in this torrent.

If you'e upgrading from Lightroom 3.5, you're going to want to delete the old liightroom catalog 4.0 and have it build a new one. Otherwise, you'll notice a very slow lightroom that can annoy u."
,Rarandbeg,2012-03-19T00:47Z,Anyone know what the serial #'s are? Or where to find them? I seem to not be able to find them. Thanks.

Will i be able to just install this Over the older version of lightroom 3 that i have an not loose all my collection folders and such like that..Or will i have to do as danieloco states...Where i need to delete my old collections and rebuild them again after i install this?

,itsjustme0011,2012-03-30T21:54Z,"I already have the Lightroom 4 trial version installed from Adobe site.

Can I just use the crack or a serial from this download on the trial version already installed?

Or do I have to modify my system somehow so Adobe cannot check my program?"
