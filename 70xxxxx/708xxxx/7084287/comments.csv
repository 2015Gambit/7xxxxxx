,Cerebral222,2012-03-10T16:23Z,"@lakeshoretitle1, your right, Comodo IS warned me that total access to my keyboard was being requested, I blocked, so I don't recommend this torrent at all, more harm than good, just FYI."
,IFuck_JT,2012-04-11T20:58Z,"lol, no offence, but what else did you expect? Do you really think there would be a tool to speed up your connection? and even if there was, don't you think your ISP would pawn your ass if you did manage to use such a non-existant tool?

Ripping off torrents is one thing, trying to rip your ISP off to obtain said torrents is another thing all together, and, who the fuck has 100Kbps Internet?
