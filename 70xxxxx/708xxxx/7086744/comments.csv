Btw, for Color Efex Pro 4 in the available presets and recipes folder there are 2 .np recipes which gives error:invalid file format on importing . In the subfolder ""Don Smith"" there are : ""enhancing-morning-mist.np"" and ""lighten-morning-shadows.np"" which can not be imported as Recipes..but i guess 2 its not a big loss :) 53 is better than 10 :)
If someone need some cool plugins too check on my name for uploads :)"
