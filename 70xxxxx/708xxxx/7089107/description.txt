Details:

There are few singers in the music world who are as gifted as Ty Stone. Just one listen to Ty's debut album American Style showcases this. The lyrics are steeped in Americana while the production leans in the country/rock side of the fence but if all things were equal, Ty Stone would be the male answer to Adele. He's that good.
