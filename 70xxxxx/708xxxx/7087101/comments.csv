[V],ChattChitto,2012-03-08T21:11Z,"It does, just make sure to Run As Administrator if your using Windows 7/VISTA"
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-09T05:41Z,"Thanks for the Upload :)

@ All Downloaders - You will have to Copy - Paste - Replace the Crack. Automated Cracking doesn't work."
,EvilDoom,2012-03-09T15:52Z,"Greetings...

I am in need of your assistance...
If you could contact me @ UCantHax@Gmail.com I'll explain more...
This would be very appreciated...

,ham82,2012-03-11T00:07Z,"This doesnt work. It worked for me for about an HOUR before it spat out an error saying ""Major issue! Please visit site to download latest blah blah blah"".

Im on xp and used installer to apply crack just as nfo instructed.
"
,ham82,2012-03-11T00:18Z,ok i used auto so now i will do it manually and report back. sorry.
,flourgrader,2012-03-12T13:51Z,"ChattChitto :

Sorry mate it does not work !
ham82 is correct in what he says ! 
So no need to repeat him !
plus
If you make a web site and preview/ publish it all the screen is RED so your website is totaly unusable .
A lot of crackers think they have cracked this program 
but very few have a full working version. To the best of my Knowledge the latest fully working version is 7.6.4
It would be nice to see a fully working version ! Other option is to go out an buy it !"
,ham82,2012-03-12T21:48Z,"Ok, reporting back that even when crack is applied manually, still doesnt work for more than a few minutes. Spits out an error after awhile saying ""critical error: download latest at site"" yada yada. I didnt publish to domain but honestly why bother if it can just nuke it with red screen/watermark. I had wysiwyg 7 previously (paid) but dont think that has anything to do with it as i installed to different directory."
,mauzao9,2012-03-20T20:05Z,"I don't know if it is an Bug, but we can't use the Background options, only stays RED, with gradient, color or image as options to background.

Only selecting transparent background will take some effect, is this happening with others here?"
,flourgrader,2012-03-21T12:48Z,"mauzao9: Read what I said above !
Your wasting your time with this software !
It is NOT cracked  !
READ THE COMMENTS ABOVE !"
,taz420nj,2012-05-20T20:40Z,"Why has this torrent not been nuked and why are people seeding it?  The crack does not work.  Running as administrator doesn't have anything to do with it. The program detects the crack attempt and ruins any page you attempt to publish by changing the background red and changing the title to ""Created with an illegal version of WYSIWYG Web Builder 8"".

I'm very disappointed ChatChitto, this is not what I have come to expect from you."
[V],ChattChitto,2012-06-12T12:55Z,It does work..! Have you tried blocking it from using the Internet?
,ayaycaptain,2012-09-10T04:30Z,ayyy thank you >:]
