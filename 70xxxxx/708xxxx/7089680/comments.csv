,MedianJ,2012-03-23T01:59Z,"Not working, can't load most of the cars , just errors spamming. And only one track seem to be working. Don't bother downloading, it's like the other unlockers that doesn't do the job correctly."
,MedianJ,2012-03-23T02:01Z,"It seems though, as it could work on 32bit. I'm using 64bit and it could be a 64bit issue as far as I've understood."
,MedianJ,2012-03-23T02:37Z,"Sorry for the mess above. I found a quick fix for the 64 bit that worked, I'm just gonna paste it.

If you're using 64bit system, then do this:

1. Open up your registry (start>run>regedit).

2. Copy the key from ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionProductId""

3. Create a new key (type: string)ďťż in ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeMicrosoft Windows NTCurrentVersionProductId""

4. Paste in the value you copied from the last key. Now, run the unlocker it should work fine!"
