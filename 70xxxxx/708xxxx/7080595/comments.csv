So here's what you do.

1 - Mount/Burn the DVD image.
2 - Click on OriginInstaller.[Don't worry, it's not Origin, it's something RELOADED made]
3 - Install.
4 - Once installed go to the directory. me3/Binaries/win32
5 - Remove the EXE.
6 - Goto crack folder on dvd and copy/paste to Binaries/win32
7 - Create shortcut, and stick it on your desktop.
8 - Play the game.

,OmniNegro,2012-03-06T19:24Z,"Due to the multitude of problems people are having, I suggest one of the two solutions.

1. Wait for a crack fix/DLC fix. This may take the form of the patch that should have been a part of the game to begin with.

2. Try reading endless comments and follow the simple directions that require you to know how to pull your head out of your ass.

Seriously Bioware and EA are shitty companies that release early beta quality games as the retail version and require patches to get it to work properly. They do some of this because of sheer haste and disrespect for the paying customers, and  some of this is intentional to make things harder for pirates.

I have no interest in this game, nor much of anything with an EA logo on the box. But I enjoy reading and trying to help. Not everyone that pirates is ""Stealing"" the game. Some pirate because cracked versions bypass some of the headaches paying customers get.

Even if you enjoy the game, I suggest NOT buying it until EA/Bioware bothers to patch it so that it works properly. And if you have time, write them a letter explaining that you will not buy their garbage until they stop fucking you with bug-riddled games that have pathetic ""DLC"" used as bait on a hook so they can sucker people into a purchase.

Good day to those of you bothering to seed and contribute."

You do not follow instructions, so why bother to tell you here? You will just ignore it.

/Sigh

Alright. Here is the part you are ignoring. It should not ask you for a damned code at all. Not if you are doing it right. 

Disable autorun on your mounted drive through Daemon Tools or PowerISO or whatever mounter you use. NEVER use autorun for games. It will install garbage like Origin if you let it.

As others have said:
1 - Mount/Burn the DVD image.
2 - Click on OriginInstaller.[Don't worry, it's not Origin, it's something RELOADED made]
3 - Install.
4 - Once installed go to the directory. me3/Binaries/win32
5 - Remove the EXE.
6 - Goto crack folder on dvd and copy/paste to Binaries/win32
7 - Create shortcut, and stick it on your desktop.
8 - Play the game.

That is not too hard. And if you think it is then you can go buy the game and use autorun to let it take over your system with Ring 0 access that the Windows OS cannot even get. (Meaning you are owned by Origin from that point on.)"

,Mrpepperson,2012-03-06T22:36Z,"The only thing I have to complain about so far is the download speed. This is the slowest download I have ever done. I thought it was me, but I started a few other downloads to test my speed and they were going at a good 1.1 - 2.3 mb/s. So I think it's the seeders and how I'm connecting to them. Nonetheless, everyone needs to seed for at least an hour, your already getting free games, plus, it isn't like it's doing anything when it's seeding. (Besides a little slower connection speed) 

So, please, when your done with your download, just keep seeding while you play! Thank you to the people who seed, for not being a regular, selfish, inconsiderate, human being. "

Seriously, that man deserves a medal

Also seed you cunts. It's the easiest thing in the world. Leave bittorrent on while you're playing the game, and if you're concerned about slowing down your connection just set an upload limit so you have some breathing room.

The fact that the number of seeders is currently small (though only compared to the number of leechers - still second most seeded PC game on TPB) should be EXPECTED.  Frankly, MOST people probably couldn't download 13GB of data on their connection in less than 10 hours MINIMUM.  I know my own line won't do this in less than 8 hours even going at the maximum speed my line will take!

So could everyone quit bitching about the number of seeds until, idk, maybe 3/8/12 around 6AM?  In 72 hours from release we'll frankly have a MUCH better idea how the ratio is going to be.

Step 3: Now you see the BIOGAME_Rus.tlk file right? Drag it to your desktop.

Step 4: Find the language file you want, For example, I chose BIOGAME_Int.tlk for English. Now rename the tlk file to BIOGAME_RUS.tlk EXACTLY. Make sure NOT to change the file format, just the title. BIOGAME_RUS.tlk CASE SENSITIVE OKAY?!

""I can confirm Mike's fix! It worked for me, here's how the problem presented to me in specific:

I played ME3 directly after install and had no major problems, so I fine tuned the graphics and set the audio levels to my liking. But after having rebooted my PC the game had no sound excpt for the intro video.

I used Mike's fix tip and went to the settings applications located one directory above the exe (installpathMass Effect 3Binaries) and changed the audio setting to ""on"" from having been ""default"". It is important to not forget to save settings, which is found under the tab Mass Effect 3 before you close the settings application. After this, the sound should be back on.

Things that it does, that i have detected:

This file is a renamed VBS Host file. It asks for execute rights.
2. Copies a file to %appdata%[random]lvvm.exe and executes it
3. Copies files to %appdata%Microsoft[random][random].* (*.tmp & *.exe - 5 files)

Nvidia users should : 

Search for “Nvidia Setting”, it should have come with your computer. 

Open the program

Go to 3D setting, Select the “Manage 3D Settings”

Now click the “Program Settings” Tab

Click the “Add” Button

Navigate to “File Path..OriginMass Effect 3 DemoBinariesWin32″ and click on the “MassEffect3.exe”

Now you’re free to decide how the graphic cards handle the program.

Underneath the above option, you should find the “Select the preferred graphics processors for this computer”.

Tell it to choose “High Performance NVIDIA processor” it may vary, but the idea is the same.

Don’t forget to look at the bottom left and click the “Apply” button.

Got it from : segmentnext dot com

Great upload - many thanks !!

I had i problem where ME3 crashed on startup, But got fix for that...

Nvidia users should : 

Search for “Nvidia Setting”, it should have come with your computer. 

Open the program

Go to 3D setting, Select the “Manage 3D Settings”

Now click the “Program Settings” Tab

Click the “Add” Button

Navigate to “File Path..OriginMass Effect 3 DemoBinariesWin32 and click on the “MassEffect3.exe”

Now you’re free to decide how the graphic cards handle the program.

Underneath the above option, you should find the “Select the preferred graphics processors for this computer”.

Tell it to choose “High Performance NVIDIA processor” it may vary, but the idea is the same.

Don’t forget to look at the bottom left and click the “Apply” button.

,tcprime,2012-03-10T13:55Z,"To all of those who have ME2 save files, this fix worked for me.

What you need to do is create an ME2 save folder in the same directory where ME3 creates a save folder.

For those with a general setup, the save directory will be stored here:

C:Documents and SettingsUserNameMy DocumentsBioWare

Just add a folder named 'Mass Effect 2 Save' in that folder, then create a folder named 'Save' inside of the ME2 save folder you just created. Now, dump your ME2 save folders into that 'Save' folder.

This is the only thing that worked for me after trying quite a few different things. I think those instructions are simple enough.

BTW, make sure your original saves are still in their folder. It should be named something like the following format:

Character Name_Character Level_Profession_Date of save

I think there may be issues with save files used from the cloud, or games where you can't import if you started a 2nd playthrough, etc..but I had both types of save files and was able to import both of them with this method.

Cheers."
,tcprime,2012-03-10T14:01Z,"Made a mistake. Just create a 'Mass Effect 2' folder in the Bioware folder. Folder hierarchy should go like this:

Another Boring game, with the replay value of a bad ""B"" movie.

why even ask questions in the game the out come is the same . even the ending lets you make a choice control them or distroy them, no matter the ending is the same! 

the sad thing is playing a game where you make a choice should make the game different , But this game it does not!
so my point is why even put it in the game , when it makes no difference!
I guess by this they make the game longer, by you wasting time asking stupid question,s that have nothing to do with the out come of the game!

this is by far the best of the series though , the combat is more intence and flanking is good!

,nik0lakiC,2012-03-10T22:45Z,"Hello everyone, 

First things first. It took me 2 days to download this torrent because of possible connection problem. Some may be able to download it within 30 minutes or even a week but that is totally an internet connection matter.

Secondly, I can guarantee you that this torrent is  perfectly clean. No viruses and no trojan. If your antivirus shows you that the file is infected it is possible that it is wrong because the antivirus cannot recognize the files and identify the publisher or sth. 

Thirdly, this game runs excellent. Although it reccomends a RAM of 4G I can play on full graphics with my 3.5G. Ech of you that has a problem running this game try reinstalling it and check out if your computer can really run it here : http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/intro.aspx (site is totally safe).

Now about some instalation tips,
1) Mount the first .iso file using Power iso, Magic iso or Daenmon tools. ( I used Power iso)
2) Follow the exact instruction given by the installer.
3) When asked, mount the second .iso file and click continue to fulfil the installation.
4) After that open the second .iso file and open the ""Crack"" folder. Copy the one file inside.
5) Then go to the installation folder where you chose to install the game.
6) Open ""Binaries"". Then ""Win32"" and paste the copied file inside.
7) Run the game from the file you pasted in the folder.
8) Enjoy one of the greatest games of the decade.

These are the steps that I followed and it works awesome.
It is very simple. If anyone of you follows these instructions and still has a problem I honestly don't know anything else to help."

You should never have been asked for a serial at all. You clearly installed it incorrectly or are trying to access online portions of the game. If you installed in properly the first time, that wouldn't have happened.

,simolino,2012-03-14T03:54Z,"Imagine this kids...kidos, kids. let's have a serious chat right now right here, pretend I'm your daddy and I am instructing you in life ok bros. Imagine then, if you had a lamborghini, a really nice green lamborghini you bought yourself for christmas, let's imagine for a second that there was a machine that could make an exact copy of that nice green lambo for you to share with your friend. Your friend wants a lamborghini really bad, but you decide to share it to him for free, you give him a copy of the lambo, same thing, works the same. NOW, when you give him a lambo, he doesn't need a lambo anymore, thus he has no need to pay for one anymore. He doesn't buy a lambo because he already got one for free. Lamborghini INC, back in Italy says, well there is no more demand for lambos, no one wants to buy one anymore, so we are not making profit, and we are on the verge of going broke, thus we cannot produce more lambos. All of a sudden Firuccio the mechanic comes in with the startling news that their priced lambo is being distributed for free by a machine that can make copies of it. How do you think poor old Firruccio feels? cheated, broke, sad. Exactly, oh poor Firuccio, figaro figaro figaro, oh soo sad poor poor Firuccio. Poor Firuccio is then fired, because his boss can't afford to pay him anymore, in fact him and his brother Sigarro get fired, and soon after the company goes broke. Firuccio and Sigarro both loose their jobs, and their homes. Their hot italian wives don't suck their dicks anymore because they can't affrord to buy them a nice dress. Isn't this sad, ladies and gentlemen? oh figaro figaro figaro, this is very sad indeed."
,simolino,2012-03-14T04:19Z,"Ahhh but you thought I was trying to teach you about how bad piracy is, why no my friends, quite the contrary you see. We have not heard the other side of the Argument. Let's go back to lamborghini INC in old Italia once again. Cops arrest Enzo Lamborghini for fraud, and soon after arrested his henchmen Firuccio and Sigarro for being in the Camorra. You see, these camorristas were selling fake useless Lambos to poor unsuspecting people. Once in a while Lamborghini INC would produce a lambo that really worked as they had promised, so as to evade suspicion. Other times they made pure lemons, no effort. On top of that, The camorra's terms of service stated that there would be no refunds to the poor broke bastards who were unlucky enough to buy a lemon, which was most of the time. They also stated that they could take any of the lambos back at any time thy wanted, they could spy on their buyers to see who had made a copy of a lambo behind their back, and and made measure on their lime green lambos so they could not be copied...this made some of the cars break down, oh figaro figaro figaro, and the people who had bought one legitimately could not use their awesome green lambos. On day you and your friend drive buy, and a poor italian old lady Marvela sees that your lambos work, but her's does not. She feels sad, not only because her menopausia has set in, but also because that lambo she sees is perfect working copy, and that you got your lambo for free. She feels sad and commits suicide. Soon after cops probe the case, and find out that she had actually paid for her beatiful green lambo with her sweat and toil, but could not use it because of the anti copy mechanism that the camorristas put in it.  Poor old Marvela could have gotten one for free that worked, instead of buying the one THAT DIDN""T WORKKKK ohhhhhh how sadaaa makes me want to cry ohhhhhhhhh!!! figaroooooooooooouuuu!!! oh TRAGEDYYYYYYYYYY!!  and so the camorristas get arrested and get what they deserve.

,TadeuAV,2012-03-15T19:46Z,"Hi guys!

I'm here seeking some answers, could you help me with this question? I understood the installation procedure using OriginInstaller.exe, but...

1. The OriginInstaller.exe will work with the retail physical dvd files?

 If a create iso images using the legit dvds with this .exe i can bypass the key authentication?

... I'm asking this 'cause i live in Brazil and here not everyone have a good cxn or persistent one. And i'm always looking for workaround when installing games, God knows when i will lose my cxn... and i haven't finish this torrent download yet, DL 33 KB/s



Well, sry for my bad english and good game for everyone from a ME fan =) Peace!"

,tiz2,2012-03-17T10:50Z,@ docjomalley:Because with only 3mb the number of simultaneous connections you can have before it becomes counter-productive due too the overhead from each connection is low compared to someone with a 100 mb line. Better internet often means faster torrent download. 
,tiz2,2012-03-17T11:01Z,"@ docjomalley: To clarify, you want a few people with somewhat fast upload to get a good download speed. Someone with a more powerful connection can also use a lot of people with a low upload speed and it will all add up, but that option is not for you. You will instead get the low download speed when that happens, because you are connected to alot of slow connections + the overhead from each, bringing your 3 mb down."

In order to get the best ending, you'll need to play a bunch of multiplayer and raise your readiness up to 4,000 (6,000 according to some). Fucking retarded decision on Bioware's behalf, but do we know if MP even works for this version? I know it doesn't on most piratey stuff, but I can always hope. If not, the best ending is 99% unreachable (unless you followed a very specific path through all 3 games) until someone releases an MP crack, a fix or a trainer that lets you increase readiness points/war assets and such. 

TL;DR- You NEED multiplayer for best ending, MP usually doesn't work for us. Has anybody figured out a workaround or gotten MP to work?"
,markunt,2012-03-21T00:37Z,"UPDATE!!!

My previous comment wasn't ENTIRELY accurate. Apparently, your Effective Military Strength is the stat that determines the ending. While you cannot get enough through SP, you can when you beat the game and start a New Game+, your EMS carries over. So basically, you have to beat the game twice to get the best ending."

evo ti c/p rješenje za problem, trebalo bi šljakat 100%:

tcprime wrote: ""To all of those who have ME2 save files, this fix worked for me.

What you need to do is create an ME2 save folder in the same directory where ME3 creates a save folder.

For those with a general setup, the save directory will be stored here:

C:Documents and SettingsUserNameMy DocumentsBioWare

Just add a folder named 'Mass Effect 2 Save' in that folder, then create a folder named 'Save' inside of the ME2 save folder you just created. Now, dump your ME2 save folders into that 'Save' folder.

This is the only thing that worked for me after trying quite a few different things. I think those instructions are simple enough.

BTW, make sure your original saves are still in their folder. It should be named something like the following format:

Character Name_Character Level_Profession_Date of save

I think there may be issues with save files used from the cloud, or games where you can't import if you started a 2nd playthrough, etc..but I had both types of save files and was able to import both of them with this method.

The game is working perfectly for me , The installation went smooth Well Done EZ.

Those whose bitching regarding the installation its either your computer or you dont know how to install the game.

1- downlaod poweriso 
2- click start go to powersio folder "" poweriso virtual Manager ""
3- go to your taskbar on the down right corner ull see the icone of the powersio right click it and choose a drive and go to the torrents ""mount Image"" downloades where you downloaded the game. 
4- mount   rld_me3a.iso and installation program will popup and if it didnt popup go to mycomputer and go to the drive you have mounted double click on OriginInstaller.exe 
5- later on the installer will ask you that it need a ""file "" to complete installation mount the other file which is "" rld_me3b.iso "" and click ok
6- the installation is done. mount again ""rld_me3a.iso"" and open the drive by going to Computer > right click ME3_Disk1 > copy the crack and paste it in > Games > Mass effect 3 > binaries > win32. copy and replace "" yes"" 
7- double click masseffect3.exe and the game will start perfectly.

I read about all the comments and issues people were having while the download was doing its thing and prepared myself for the worst. Was quite surprised when everything went smoothly, saves worked fine, didnt crash at some point people were talking talking about with pods, yada yada yada. 
Anyway, another tutorial for those who dont know what they are doing, and an example of what exactly I did for people that do ;p
WIN 7 64 bit

1) You dont have to burn a disk to use .iso files ;p
2) I use Daemon Tools lite, mounted rld-me3a.iso and ran the autoexe
3) When it comes up with what some people in previous comments thought was an error ""Cant find file #35"" or whatever, at that point you just mount the next iso (which is equivalent to inserting ""disk 2"").
4) It finished the install eventually and when I looked at the reloaded loader it did show an error ""external component has thrown an exception"", but I ignored it and continued anyway since the install did appear to complete.
5) Instead of installing the crack that came with the torrent, I used the DLC unlocker crack instead... because... well... I wanted Pavik and the Particle Rifle :D
6) Before I ran the game I did open ""MassEffect3Config.exe"" first to make sure everything was set the way I wanted it.
7 ) Manually dragged my own shortcut of the DLC unlocker crack to the desktop, ran it from there and everything went perfect.
I have so far completed the game in speed mode you might say with terrible War Assets and saw the shitty ending you get with that so I can at least say this method worked for me and I had no issues like I read about previously. 
Ill also add here, with these coalesced.bin editors around, we torrent users can also experience the ""good"" ending. "

To all that are woundering if this torrent is ok I can say that I have never trusted a downloader more than extremezone, ALL WAYS WORKS IF YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!

Forenote to extremezone I will put my input in as I come across any other fixes, Please read below as could do with some help?? Just like I thought many other Mass effect 1 People were having as I did in the begin, trying to get everything to work properly :) Cheers Jimsmurph

I have never uploaded a Torrent before & would like some help please, WHICH I would believe be of benefit to all that have had problems getting the DLC content to work!!!!

After & I say many hours off screwing around with downlods & stuff, reading every forum I could get my eyes too I finally have got everything to work!!!!

Yes ""Bring Down The Sky""
 Yes ""Pinnacle Station"" Which I might just say here that I have the Name Pinnacle Station in my DLC Content box when I access it!!!! Wicked :)

Iv written a Install guide for me & for even a first user to understand as I might be a Qualified Tech but others arn't Aye :)

So If anyone is interested in helping me sort out my first torrent & take it off my hansds as I can't hoste it from here then email me Slider-69-@hotmail.com

Many Thanks to all the tirless work & effort the uploaders do to bring us which I have found for the most part excellent torrents (for the ones I trust :))

Seriously though, to everyone who is considering downloading this, consider this first: Skyrim has been top PC Game torrent for almost 6 months.  ME3 has been out just 1.5 months and already getting beat by GTA and FIFA.  If you want a decent RPG, don't support BioWare - don't even torrent them, it's support too.  Go play Skyrim and support a game that's ACTUALLY GOOD.  (So good it's the only one of my last 7 torrents I actually bought lol.)"

I hate to tell you but you are wasting your money dude. You can't even come close to using ONE of these babies if you don't upgrade you processor.

Go with the i7-3960X - 3.9 GHz Turbo Boost and hook a corsair watercooling on it then overclock to 4.2Ghz. 

That should get you to 7.9 perf index and keep your fps above water with pretty much any game one best settings. 

PS. make sure you use one of these babies for physics and one for graphics. Don't overlap functions.

I installed the game and what not successfully, moved the .exe into the win32 nonsense
Finally tried starting the game and it starts doing the loading mouse and then opens a window saying:

""Mass Effect(TM) 3 has stopped working. Windows is checking for a solution to the problem.""

And then:

 ""A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.""

I'm running on OS Windows 8 Evaluation Build 8400 if that has significant value, although it shouldn't seeing as Windows 8's compatibility mode to run apps as Windows 7 usually works, this is a problem. Does anyone know how to fix this??"

For Graphic related issues: MassEffect3.exe has stopped working when hit the Escape key or in the middle of play, its a graphics driver problem. I have fixed both of these issues on my Laptop to play this game already. I uninstalled my current driver and went found an older driver, the one I had when I played Mass Effect 3 (Aug 2011) and the game runs SOLID! With sound and no problems. To install this game download and instal MagicISO. Mount the disc and run the exe when it pops up follow the directions and BAM. To Crack just copy the crack into the Binaries/win32 folder and click Copy and paste over! Not that hard. If it doesnt work then your computer cant run it. "

Heres a install guide for this download...

Mass Effect 3 Install Guide with All DLC & Unlocked N7 content.
---------------------------------------------------------------

I use Virtual Clone Drive..Its free Google it!!!


Mount ISOa start install, 
when ask for the next disk/part mount ISOb & continue the install.
Once finished Exit the installer.

Goto the ME3 DLC UNlocker folder open it up you will find the crack.
Get it from here:-
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7081986/Mass.Effect.3.DLC.Unlocker-RELOADED

Browse to the Games install directory Binaries - win32 folder, 
It is here by default:- C:/Program Files/Mass Effect 3/Binaries/Win32

Now copy the crack over to the Win32 folder & overwrite it.
From the Win32 folder copy & paste a short cut of the now new,
 MassEffect3.exe on to the desktop.

You can now close everything & unmount the ISO.

Start the game with the shortcut.Stop the Game.

Now open the N7 DLC folder. (This is no longer available but im working on uploading it).
So use this one:-
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7137586/Mass_Effect_3_dlc_weapons_armors_and_cheats

Now copy the Coalesced.bin file over to the CookedPCConsole folder,
It is here by default:- C:/Program Files/Mass Effect 3/BIOGame/CookedPCConsole
& overwrite it.
Again You can now close everything.

Now open the Readiness Level Cheat folder.
Now copy the Local_Profile.sav file over to the Save folder,
it is here by default:- C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/BioWare/Mass Effect 3/Save
& overwrite it.
Again You can now close everything.

Note:- You dont have to use the N7 & 100% Cheats if you dont want to, just don't do those steps.

To Import a ME2 Character you need to have your ME2 Game folder in the the BioWare Folder
& in your ME2 Game folder you need your complete save folder
So to get to your ME2 Save folder the path would be this:-
C:/Users/Administrator/Documents/BioWare/Mass Effect 2/Save 
then it would have your Characters folder in the save folder.

Start the game with the:- import a Character option & sellect your ME2's last save.

Recommend disconnecting the internet during play.

Play the Game.

Hope this helps ::)))

Enjoy!!!!!"

,ilikegames525252,2012-07-16T02:55Z,"Need help.....

downloaded everything and originally had the game working perfectly but now whenever i try to launch the game it pops up with origin

ERROR

origin is not installed and required to play your game..bla..bla..bla.

someone suggested to go into the binary file, click the masseffectconfig.exe and then click on the online tab.. but there is none, if anyone knows how to fix this it'd be much appreciated"
,Fantomnz,2012-07-16T11:17Z,"@ImranN I would say that you would have no problem running on high..make sure all your drivers are the latest available etc etc
At worst you'll freeze the game or crash it.. no harm done just reduce it & play on!!!

@ilikegames525252 You are correct there is no option in the config, that person was wrong!!!
Ther is how ever feedback in the option settings that can be set to NO.

Ok the instructions for the torrent are:- As usual we recommend firewalling the executables, not using Origin, and
 avoiding EA.

I would disconnect from the internet unplug or if wireless change the properties to connect manually & then disconnect.

Then I would recopy the ME3.exe crack that you used last on the completion of your install(I dont know if you have done the DLC's or not) to the install directory, It is here by default:- C:/Program Files/Mass Effect 3/Binaries/Win32

Remember to delete any shortcuts you already have & then make a new one from the new .exe
That should work!!!

If that dosn't work for some unknown reason something has really gone wrong.

Goto to your save files, It is here by default:-
C:UsersAdministratorDocumentsBioWare

Take a copy of the ME3 folder just in case.
Re-Install the game whilst disconnected from the Net. You could follow my Guide above if you like, All works Perfectly!!! Im playing that install now :)

Replace your ME3 Save folder. Overwrite it so its what you had when you copied it!!
Play the Game :)    NO Internet!!!!

Last if you have the Extended Cut, First make sure the game is playable then exit the game goto:-
Mass.Effect.3.Extended.Cut.DLC-RELOADED

And follow my install Guide for that also.
There all done!!!

Enjoy... Sharing is Caring :)

Altho you dont have a nVidia card you still need to install Physx. You can install it separatly without having to install a nVdia driver.

Should work unless 2nd you have a bad or corrupt download.
Possibly you could just redownload the 2nd Disk/ISO.

,Fantomnz,2012-07-31T01:07Z,"@SBonesE8

Have you got another game controller plugged in. If not try a wired mouse... Yea I know its not ideal but if it fixes the prob then its the wireless thats creating the issue.
If this is not the case then copy your save files & do a fresh install.

Hope that helps :)

,ctfo,2012-07-31T11:08Z,are there cracks for multiplayer? or should i just buy the game because i want the multiplayer too
,Vodkev,2012-07-31T15:16Z,"Impossible to play the multiplayer with a cracked version. 

You have to buy the game and use Origin to do so."
,GgsterM,2012-08-07T04:09Z,"I've got a problem!!

So I installed the game and everything went fine, but since the second time I've played, a message that ""Mass Effect 3(TM) has stopped working"" keeps bumping up on the screen randomly. Sometimes I can play for an hour, other times every 5 minutes the game is closed.

Has anybody else experienced this? If somebody could help me, I would appreciate it very much. "
,Fantomnz,2012-08-07T14:49Z,"@GgsterM

Only thing I can suggest is that you update all drivers, also you need .netframework 4.0, DirectX, PhysX.

If all upto date & still having problems copy your save files & do a fresh install then put your saves back.

Hope that helps if not let me know :)

thanks a lot for the advice, but, sadly, the problem persists. I'm guessing it has something to do with the fact I'm playing it on an HP Pavilion dv7 laptop. The driver updates I installed don't seem to solve the problem. It seems more people have this driver problem with these kind of laptops. I'm not really sure, though.

If you or anyone else knows if there's a solution, I'd be very grateful. Anyway, thanks a lot ;)"

Ok found this info.

Strong Gaming Performance

Armed with Nvidia’s GeForce 9600M GT graphics card and 512MB dedicated memory, the dv7 is ready for some serious gaming and multimedia usage. Its 3DMark03 score of 12,516 is more than 1,000 points above average for this category, even when you include high-end gaming machines. However, its 3DMark06 score of 3,930 is about 900 points below average for the category. That means while it’s fine for mainstream games, it will deliver below-average performance for high-end games like Crysis.


So can only assume it's the graphics but it should cope ok from what Iv read.
I guess you have the latest C++ 
So you could try increasing the virtual/swap memory size, I would suggest no lower than 1536Mb.

Turn off back ground processes that arnt needed whilst in play. It could be as simple as a auto program update trying to connect.

You can goggle ""How to"" for both of the above, but an easy way to do the back ground programs etc is to Install ""Game Booster"" latest version
Its free just google it & Iv been using it & its excellent IMO :)

Hope that helps :)

Thanks a lot, man, I really appreciate everything you're doing to help, but the problem persists. I've tried everything, and still the same error =(

If I find a solution, I'll let you know. Thanks a lot! :)"
,GgsterM,2012-08-09T17:10Z,"For whoever has read my problem a few comments back, I've noticed the message ""Mass Effect 3 has stopped working"" usually (I believe most of the times, if not always) comes up when I open the command HUD, press ESC or open the map. It doesn't come up every time I do these things, but sometimes when I do, the game crashes. Any thoughts?

Thanks"

,matsja,2012-09-23T22:39Z,"Great torrent, 

Quick question: I have downloaded some DLC's released by RELOADED, the levathian, the 1,03 patch and the extended cut, and the ""from Ashes"" shared by pisoY, which I read in the comments  that it worked with this release.  

In which order should I install the different dlc's and updates. Patch first, and then the extended cut, and then the dlc's or what else? Does it even matter? 

Thanks for sharing!"
,matsja,2012-09-24T01:06Z,"okay, I just gave it a go, and it worked out fine. Here's my recipee: 

1. install this one, (follow the intructions)
2. start the game, disconnect to internet.
3.exit and install the dlc unlocker from reloaded (follow the intructions)
4.started the game, just to see it worked. 
5. installed the 1.03 patch from reloaded (follow the intructions)
6.started & exited
7.installed extended cut, levathian, and the n7 package (follow the intructions)
8. played the game. 

Sound, ME2 character, everything works, figured out that the ""From Ashes"" is included in this version of the game, and is unlocked with the unlocker. Not sure yet if the dlc's all work, guess you'll hear from me if not..

I play on a Asus UX31E ultrabook, with win 7 64 bit and Intel HD 3000, works fine, just remember to upgrade the graphics drivers (version 8.15.10.2622) and the microsoft visual C++. "
