The Art Of Sex has been a long time in the making. We didnΓÇÖt want to present it as a story, instead we wanted to go back to basics and concentrate solely on the precious act of making love. We wanted to show its lustful, raw passion, we wanted to show it in all itΓÇÖs natural beauty, and we wanted it to be a true reflection of the emotions and physical pleasure shared between a man and a woman during sex.


Usually in straight porn, we cut right into a deep-throat blowjob given by a overly made-up girl in 6-inch heels, then the pumped up male figure proceeds to fuck the shit out of her like sheΓÇÖs an animal, as she screams and pretends to enjoy herself. It is void of intimacy, it is a cold, mechanical and empty performance.


We wanted to smash through this convention and make something totally new, taking what weΓÇÖve been doing with lesbian erotica and applying it to straight sex scenes. The girls had to be loved, worshipped and caressed, the feelings and ardour shared between the man and the woman had to be real, as did the orgasms. Kissing, eye-contact, loving and romantic touches, intimacy, these were the things we aimed to show, as we felt more honestly represented the reasons and the way people make love in the real world.


The Art of Sex examines the beautiful, passionate and tender side of love-making.

Including some of the most incredible, real footage of different couples discovering themselves and one another during the most intimate act two people can share. The sex has to be seen to be believed.
