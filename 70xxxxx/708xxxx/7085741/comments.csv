,k.haas32,2012-03-24T08:02Z,ive actually have a question. Why is that we have to click on Magnet now to download? When I do it this way I cant see the files that are downloading. I used to be able to click on the green arrows to download that particular movie. Any help on how this works now?

A=10, V=7

A bit of pixilation on larger screens.  V would probably be 10 on a computer screen.

Great UP! "

Good movie but the ending could have been more explanatory. I sure hope that there is another one coming out because once again the ending wasn't as long as the actual plot. Overall good movie"
