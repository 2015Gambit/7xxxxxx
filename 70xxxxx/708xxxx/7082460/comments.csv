,jj441,2012-03-07T13:03Z,don't download this bullshit
,dukeford57,2012-03-07T17:14Z,RATHER HAVE NON-RAR AVI FILE. BOYCOTT X264 AND RAR!
[T],theburningbush,2012-03-07T22:41Z,"sceneline: Thank you for your very timely post of this torrent.

You went to all the trouble of making this available, and then got dumped on by the ""gimme, gimme, gimme!"" bunch. I mean, it's S-o-o-o-o hard with 7-Zip to right-click on the rar file, choose ""extract here,"" and get the final file. Are RARs necessary? No. But to whine and moan to somebody who's providing a ***FREE*** service...holy crap!!!!!!!

If you whiners don't like the way this free stuff is being spoon-fed to you, THEN DO IT YOUR DAMNED SELVES!!!

I got your boycott RIGHT HERE!"
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-08T04:31Z,"To the whiners...you know who you are.
Please remember....
You are not a customer.
TPB is not selling anything.
You are NOT ENTITLED to anything from this site.
So, please, do not behave like a spoiled child who throws a temper tantrum when he/she is not getting what they want. Boo Hoo you gave me a free, dark blue colored, car but I wanted a black one so I'm gonna piss and moan an talk shit....grow up!
If this site is not offering what you are looking for then look elsewhere. Meanwhile don't be an asshole...don't FLAME. "
,zx6rider,2012-03-09T06:24Z,The point is that this uploader is the only one who uploads .RAR files...this sets him apart from all the others...there is no reason any longer to have them rar unless you are just too lazy to unpack them b4 you upload. If Sceneline chooses to go against the grain people are always gonna bitch about it and hit an run or not DL.
,zx6rider,2012-03-09T06:28Z,The only uploader that does upoads .rar is gonna get shit.. its that simple.. plus he keeps putting SD in HD sections.. he is either a dumb fuck or he is trolling this community. 
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-11T14:14Z,"
 @zx6rider -- FUCK OFF!!!

Is that simple enough for you?

If someone does not this free RAR offering then move along without spewing.

I'm well aware of what year we are living in and well aware of what a RAR file is and it's history.

,dodsy2008,2012-03-16T14:59Z,Does anyone know were to find an AVI of episodes 10 & 11.?!? [@uploaders. PLEASE....Enough with the MP4's (or at least make AVI's available too). 
,missworld,2012-03-31T20:23Z,It takes a few extra seconds to convert .RAR files.. If you are too dumb to do so.. go somewhere else! Cheers Sceneline :) 
,imabadboy,2012-06-04T15:05Z,can someone show me where series 9 episode 1 is on here? i cant find it ANYWHERE!!
,DaYgon76,2012-07-12T05:39Z,"@Dodsy2008
I know it's a shame as my DVD player won't play MP4's either but what we gonna do. It is free after all.
I use MP4Cam2Avi to convert them it's free, easy and quality remains good.

Once you run it use the following optionson the right hand side:
Action = Batch Convert
Video Format = Xvid MPEG-4 TV Standard 16:9
Audio Format=Lame MP3 High Quality

I've been using it for while to convert x264 MP4's.
Hope that helps"
