Besides being the coolest toy you will ever play with, our Holdem Bot has many practical uses for the online poker player and will quickly become a valuable tool in your arsenal.

Start Tournaments. Use the poker bot to play the first few hours of an MTT for you then step in fresh and take over near the money.

Play Overnight Tournaments. Those late night tourneys are juicy! Put the bot in and go to bed. See where you finished in the morning.

Hold Your Place. When the wife calls you to put up a shelf you don't need to lose your spot in the loosest cash game you've ever seen.

Consistency in SNG's. Our forum members have collaborated on testing SNG profiles and have reported in-the-money finish rates as high as 45% over many hundreds of trials.

Clear Deposit Bonuses. Take advantage of poker room deposit bonuses without having to worry about finding the time to clear them.

Rakeback, Baby. A break-even cash game profile will actually return an impressive monthly profit in rakeback payments.

Crush the Micros. The micro-limit games are easy picken's but hardly worth your while to play manually. Let your pokerbot mop them up while you are away from your computer.
