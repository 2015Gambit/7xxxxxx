True, that its blurry, but it's watchable (depending) on personal viewing  preferences, and just wanted to say ~

,lolcats12,2012-03-09T04:35Z,"miwrouph736,

the link you provided requires you to FUCKING PAY for an account. That defeats the whole purpose of piratebay. The reason people come here is to get things for free. Stop misguiding people to make them pay for things that OBVIOUSLY they want for free
