to get it in menu is     ""BUY""  What i did wrong?"

Then run the keygen - the top number will be the HWID number, press 'generate' to add a serial to the bottom line. You'll notice a registry entry has been added to the same location the keygen is at, just double click to add the full licence to the registry. Thats it. Now open Vueminder and no more 'buy-me' pop ups.  Hope this helps."

,Krelkal,2012-07-18T03:44Z,Works wonderfully! Awesome torrent! Just make sure once you use the keygen to implement the registry file (just double click it). It should be put in the same file as the keygen after you use it.
