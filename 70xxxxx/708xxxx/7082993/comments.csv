,yonarizona,2012-03-07T06:35Z,Valor spelled wrong on pic? Why file so big for cam?
,boozie56,2012-03-07T12:03Z,yonarizona This is probably a U.K. cover. Thats the Brits way of spelling it along with other words like flavour and the likes. But hey HeroMaster thanks for the up.
,adm69,2012-03-07T15:25Z,"Which is the right way, considering it is the English language ;-)"
,swalker87,2012-03-07T21:52Z,"@ adm69, couldn't  put it better myself !!!"
,grider,2012-03-08T23:00Z,"@swalker,  Which the Romans put down on paper...."

Anyone?"
,elgo2006,2012-03-09T05:39Z,"Real copy. Thanks for the up, Hero.
This is the best copy on here, but still not that watchable. Wait for a better one. Then again, it is a cam. Audio is tinny at times, but good at others. Video is pretty blurry.
A=4
V=3
M=7"
