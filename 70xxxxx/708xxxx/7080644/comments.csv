,AL13N13,2012-03-06T11:36Z,Thanks for the upload. Can you just tell us is the DLC From Ashes included and working? Thank you
,Airduinec,2012-03-06T13:34Z,"I don't know what's up with the setup.exe in the base file directory, but AVG reads it as a trojan. I deleted it and found another setup.exe in folder one, and ran that instead. Not sure what the second one is for.."

,AL13N13,2012-03-06T14:20Z,"Downloaded an hour ago, installed without problems, Avast reported nothing, no crack needed,   finished first mission without problems. Only thing i havent confirmed is DLC From Ashes. Other than that game runs perfectly. Thanks to the uploader"
,Airduinec,2012-03-06T14:28Z,"Just finished installing. 

USE THE SETUP.EXE IN FOLDER ONE

Installed PERFECTLY and I am currently playing the beginning of the game. I HIGHLY suggest unchecking updates on installation (as you always should).

No is seemingly needed in addition and no serial is required. Install takes around 45 minutes.

I'll be seeding for some time now. Thank you for the great copy, HeroMaster!"
,In_Da_Club,2012-03-06T14:38Z,"Fast download, awesome size + works like a charm, thanks!"
,HouseDrawing,2012-03-06T15:19Z,AVG picked up a Win/Heri Virus during installation? 
,HouseDrawing,2012-03-06T15:27Z,"Okay, having a slight problem. Ignored the virus, assume that's AVG bitching about something it's misreading.
But I'm installing the game and it's stuck on ""AreaMap_CitHub_Camps.pcc"" and not going anywhere. Should I just leave it? "

,Vukko,2012-03-06T16:03Z,"I'll never get it, how can you reduce the size of these games so much. Ain't it losing on performance or sth? What's the ""magic"", 'cause I feel cheated.."
[H],HeroMaster,2012-03-06T16:07Z,@ALL No DLC in this Repack Version check out DLC Unlocker just released by Reloaded.
,seriousSaMs,2012-03-06T16:30Z,"yeah HeroMaster how is the size so small, HALF of reloaded upload!! plz xplain. knowing that the full game's there we can hope for more seeders :P"
,Valamyr82,2012-03-06T16:51Z,"This is odd, even utorrent's bitching about harmful files. Didnt see this happen before. But I guess, trusted uploader will be trusted."
,Yezhik,2012-03-06T17:58Z,"The size is small because it's compressed. Hence why it takes 45 mins to install, it has to de-compress all those files to 13gb and then install them"
,4piZ,2012-03-06T18:18Z,Well thank god someone took the time and effort to upload a highly compressed version wich is less than half the size of the original Reloaded version. Makes downloading a game like this on release day a whole lot easier. I will be seeding this one for a very long time. Thanks for sharing!
,flankers,2012-03-06T19:28Z,"Based on size and name while downloading, this is actually same as Mass Effect 3 Multi7-RU Repack.

Now we have another torrent emerged, which appears to be exactly the same as well.

Mass Effect 3 Delux DVD from DibyaTPB

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7081873/Mass_Effect_3_Delux_DVD

If that is correct, it contains all Deluxe DLC, which you can activate with Reloaded Activator."
,Ringer2123,2012-03-06T19:33Z,"Who the hell uses Antivirus anymore??  If you are that dumb that you're running around getting them you don't deserve the internet.   Also, Thank god for the upload as i'm pulling a 1.5mb download rather than a bloated 100kb.  + Internets for you."
,YuriRuler90,2012-03-06T20:09Z,"Very nice. Wasn't getting but 2-3kb/s with the other torrent, hopped on this one and started at 700kb/s. Seeding now."
,xReFuse,2012-03-06T20:56Z,"For those wondering how this strong compression is possible....aslong you got enough power in your hardware  you can compress files really really small.

best example. Some games that were actualy 16 gb got released in a compressed version were the complete game is about 1gb 

Took a longer time to pack it with such an high compression but it still worked perfectly"
,LordReserei,2012-03-06T21:06Z,"seriously. There's more than 3 times the amount of seeders than peers, and this thing is downloading slow as hell. "
,Jaycce,2012-03-06T22:30Z,i jsut finished download the game and when i run the setup i get an error on the first file in data bin 1 HELP PLEASE
,Jaycce,2012-03-06T23:11Z,FUCK man this isnt working for me... good job and everything but after i run the setup the first file doesnt allow me to continue when i press retry... i pressed retry enough times and it bypassed it but in the end when i run the game it instantly says Mass effect 3.exe has stopped working close program FUCK i guess i should just torrent the larger one right?
,lead_coda,2012-03-06T23:33Z,"Good upload, thx! But after I create (or import) a character I just got stock on the loading screen forever ! Can someone help me please ?"

,lead_coda,2012-03-07T07:31Z,"Thx guy for your answer, but my problem is not the importing :P The thing is than I get stuck in the loading screen (when the ship fly in space, just see it floating like that like for 1h) thx for your answer !"

Sorry,didnt have that kind of a problem. I copied my old Mass Effect 2 folder in MyDocumentsBioWare (using XP) and import worked fine. Make sure you dont have different platforms like old ME2 saves on XP and new Mass Effect 3 on Vista/7. If using latter,try compatibility and admin modes on shortcut. Besides,anybody knows if this version has DLC's and could they be unlocked? "

,darkdodge,2012-03-08T19:39Z,"This is definitely worth downloading. No DLC's in this version but you can download ""From Ashes""
from here:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7072740/Mass_Effect_3_DLC_From_Ashes

and the best part is that you wont be needing any language fixer.Just extract to game location.Also,you will need to get DLC Unlocker from Reloaded:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7081986/Mass.Effect.3.DLC.Unlocker-RELOADED

Copy this to BinariesWin32 location.

i can only assume that it is corrupted, my only suggestion is that you re-download it which you say you are already doing. so once you are done i believe you shouldn't have any problem.
If you do encounter that problem again then try deleting the whole of DVD1 and re-download that  to rule out anything else."

not complaining about the torrent cos evrything else works perfectly. +1"
,Lordnomington,2012-03-18T00:45Z,Guys if you are getting the error codes when installing try re downloading the setups(setup.exe and .dat) and make sure your antivirus is off when downloading as it will picks up the setup files up as Trojans and this corrupts the setup data which is causing the errors. Hope this works as it did for me.

anybody knows how to fix this?"

Becoz first when i tried installing from the root setup. the error appeared in 13.5% of installation. Then i thought yeah might be my AV or something blocking the installation? i switched to safe mode and tried installing from there now the curious thing is i installed awesomely till 73% and got another ""writing error"" now, when i hit retry it started from 0% again. I m very sure this is something happened to me earlier (don't remember which game i downloaded faced the same issue tho). But yeah i have faced this kind of issue earlier while installing a large size game from torrents. Any one who can find a solution for this will be much appreciated :)"

Actually the .bin files are not corrupt, it was the ""setup.exe"" in the root directory! so folks who are having this installation issues use the Setup.exe inside the ""Disk 1"" folder 

Thanks for this awesome upload!"

turn off your antivirus and install. you can turn it back after you finish the installation. you should be able to install it easily"
