Not everyone will survive. An ancient alien race, known only as "Reapers",
has launched an all-out invasion leaving nothing but a trail of destruction
in their wake.
Earth has been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of total annihilation, and
you are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is extinction

You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can forge in your own image.
You determine how events will play out, which planets to explore, and whom
to form alliances with as you rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat
once and for all. How you wage this war is completely up to you: go into
combat with guns blazing or use cover to plan a more tactical assault.
Utilize your squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain death
from a distance or go toe-to-toe with enemies using devastating melee
attacks. Mass Effect 3 will react to each decision you make as you play
through a truly unique experience of your own creation.
