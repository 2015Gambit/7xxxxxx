,rsvuk95,2012-03-07T15:39Z,Is this work ?
,houseofswing,2012-03-07T18:23Z,my rule of thumb is if its a single rar file and not from trusted or vip skip it
,Flipper_boy,2012-03-07T20:03Z,"Tried it, it's working along with the crack. Just unpack and press setup."
,HiArashi,2012-03-07T22:57Z,Was sceptical myself with both the game and crack but they turned out real.
,rsvuk95,2012-03-08T21:53Z,Working great :D
,darrense,2012-03-08T22:18Z,It says the serial code has been activated too many times on different computers....
,Hojuaja12345,2012-03-09T22:05Z,"@Darrense

Use the guys crack located here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7084040/Major_League_Baseball_2K12_PC_Crack_Only_MLB2K12

1) Unpack

2) Drag the contents of the crack into your game folder (Usually C:/Program Files/2K sports/MLB 2k12)

3) Launch the game.

HOPE THIS HELPED!!! :D"
