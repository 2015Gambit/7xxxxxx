,Doomtrigger1,2012-03-06T17:07Z,USE YOUR FUCKING HEAD Jazzko YOU STUPID PEICE OF SHIT. CHANGE THE LANGUAGE YOUR FUCKING SELF. GO TO THE FOLDER BIOGAME THEN COPY BIOGame_RUS.tlk AND RENAME BIOGame_INT.tlk TO BIOGame_RUS.tlk  DELETE THE RUS ONE FIRST. ITS ALL OVER GOOGLE AND A FEW OF THE TORRENTS GAWD YOUR FUCKING STUPID.  DLC IS IN ENGLISH TO ME 
,OmniNegro,2012-03-06T17:35Z,"@Doomtrigger1
Amen! No quarter for retards who cannot search for answers. Any five year old should be able to find how to do that.

And if not, well they could still try bothering to read the comments of every last ME3 torrent in the last day. That would answer them a hundred times."
,Dufox,2012-03-06T18:13Z,"lol at the bitching.

jazzko... rage less 

to the other ""smart guys""
getting me3 to work with english text is easy.
getting FROM ASHES to work with english text is not so easy.

doomtrigger1, you made yourself look like a bigger jackass than jazzko did... good job"
,TheGeth,2012-03-06T18:21Z,"@OmniNegro

I haven't seen anything about this. So, write about this there. Please.

P.S. And sorry for my bad English..."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-03-06T19:18Z,"Fuck your quarter. We've used that method and the text is still in russian. If you've got nothing new to add, then just shut the fuck up.

I can push my way through and get my paragon points, but my only concern is the Prothean's text outside of the DLC area. Otherwise, this is no big deal."
,Ringer2123,2012-03-06T19:31Z,"AMEN.  All other torrents were downloading at a max of 100-200kbs.  I've got a 1.5mb going on this.  

+1059012582349058341905841950 INTERNETS HEROMaster."
,OmniNegro,2012-03-06T19:46Z,"@TheGeth

I do not know how to expound on what has already been said. But many many comments in other ME3 torrents suggest that  you should take Biogame_int.tlk and rename it BIOGame_RUS.tlk so that it uses the International English version in place of the Russian version.

I do not have the game, so I cannot actually confirm that it works. But if you read the comments you will see this solution is common and people are saying it works for them.

Good luck."
,OmniNegro,2012-03-06T19:52Z,"@ButtWipeJunior

Do you even know what quarter is? No, not ""A quarter"". That is a different thing. Try learning it if you do not already understand. And fuck you too. :)

So the big complaint you have is that the subtitles are Russian? And only in the DLC? Someone will post a fix soon I bet. Keep reading this and other ME3 torrents comments and you will see it soon."
,TheGeth,2012-03-06T20:12Z,"@OmniNegro

Sorry, I though you were talking about bonuses of Deluxe Edition."
,BruceWayneJr,2012-03-07T00:13Z,"@OmniJerkoff: I was being dismissive. Look it up, moron. "
,BruceWayneJr,2012-03-07T00:30Z,"Nobody said anything about ""a quarter"", so learn to read.

And honestly, save your fucking advice. You don't have the game, you haven't experienced the issue, and you have no firsthand knowledge. So save us all some trouble and stay quiet while the people who are actually working with the issue can make some headway.

Fuck off. Thanks. :)"
,OmniNegro,2012-03-07T01:06Z,"@BWJ
Why are you upset if you were being dismissive when you told me to STFU and bitched up a storm?

Take your own advice.

Notice I was careful not to accuse you of not knowing what quarter is. Maybe I was being ""dismissive"" of you?

And you honestly have no idea what my knowledge includes. Nor what has changed since I last posted a comment.

I will remain. You are unwelcomed. (Everyone else remains welcome.)

All your ""Paragon"" points are clearly unearned. :)"
,Rmk825,2012-03-07T04:38Z,So do we copy this .exe over the previous crack?
,STVENOM,2012-03-07T04:51Z,I HAVE THE DLC AND THIS CRACK BUT HOW DO YOU TRIGGER THE DLC??
,STVENOM,2012-03-07T04:54Z,"btw OMNINEGRO, get off this fucking site you mother-fucking no life cunt, almost every torrent i go to i see your degenerate ass starting arguments with people. Perhaps you don't get any attention in reality so you seek it through pathetic arguments. Whatever the reason, get some help."
,Rmk825,2012-03-07T05:07Z,Also looking for info...does this download give us the Pre-order DlC N7 Warfare Pack...if not any idea how i can get ahold of it is much appreciated
,jsiso,2012-03-07T05:36Z,STVENOM +1
,able1214,2012-03-07T16:23Z,"NO. N7 Warfare Gear, Robotic Dog, N7 Hoodie are not cracked. Only Squad Alternative Appearance pack and From Ashes are cracked."
,ryanmadman,2012-03-09T19:28Z,I FOUND A Mass Effect 3 WEAPONS/ARMOR DLC UNLOCKER... GET IT FROM HERE!!! IN GAME TOOLS: >>>> http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_mass_effect_3.shtml#Mass Effect 3 v1.0 +9 TRAINER 2 
[V],OneFourOne,2012-03-11T06:05Z,Thank you :)
,pinkincide,2012-03-12T09:40Z,"I'm also asking how do you trigger the DLC.  It's a simple question and you can be the one to give the answer that is nowhere on the internet.  I've looked.  Please, won't you answer how do you trigger the DLC today?  For the children."
,Savato93,2012-05-13T19:15Z,"Hey ryanmadman, if I used that trainer to unlock the N7 bonus weapons, but didn't use this first, would it undo the effects of the trainer?"
