Is it an mp4?"
,jajaes,2012-03-06T05:37Z,thanks sceneline
,ZetoxJR,2012-03-06T05:43Z,"@PW5, it is probably a .mkv, which is playable through VLC"
,PW5,2012-03-06T07:11Z,"ZetoxJR: Thank you. I hate mkv files :) 
Coz I wanna watch the show on my tv with friends & my media player doesn't play mkv :(  
Guess I'm gonna have to get a mkv to avi converter coz so many shows & movies are coming out that way now. Still haven't found Skins 6.02 on anything other than mkv."
,trick721,2012-03-06T07:46Z,"It's MP4, not MKV. Much lower video quality than I expected - what's the point of still doing these in SD? A smaller file size at 720p looks better than this. At least somebody put it up this time."
,trick721,2012-03-06T08:06Z,Audio is also not great. Maybe I'm just too spoiled for PDTV source?
,eargnairod,2012-03-06T20:09Z,"oh come onnnnnn, someone upload this in 720p please :( "
