,SectorVector,2012-03-09T20:03Z,The file size 1.16 GB and the description (960 x 720) are the same as your earlier 720p UP. But this is marked 1080p ! Is it simply a duplicate of that UP. Just thought i'd ask. Anyway happy to know its out on bluray. Thx. :)

Resolution.............: 1424 x 1080

Too bad I cannot edit."
,moshster,2012-03-10T11:47Z,"Does this have the inter-scene frame cards in English or French?  Can anyone please confirm, thx."

,SilenceMurderer,2012-03-10T14:30Z,"@FreeChili
No one speaks in this movie.

@moshster 
The language written in the movie itself is French, if that's what you mean."
,moshster,2012-03-10T16:19Z,"@SilenceMurder - Thanks.  Yes that's what I meant, the between scenes text.  I could probably interpret the French but think I'll ait for the English release rather than be distracted by the text."
,fumo7,2012-03-14T22:32Z,"It's silly to do 720p and 1080p in the same, (very low) bitrate. The 1080p will not look any better than 720p, in fact there is a good chance it will look worse."
,11162,2012-03-16T13:03Z,Please include a sample
,SilenceMurderer,2012-03-16T13:22Z,"@fumo7 
The low bit rate is possible because the movie is black/white. 1080p will look better on a 1080p tv, 720p on a 720p tv."
,JorgePoty,2012-05-27T00:49Z,The English subttitles are not synchronized!
