,Steff320i,2012-07-01T11:45Z,"With all due respect, psspss: Do you recompress other people's uploads? Just wondering, because I get the impression that your uploads have less quality than other versions.
Is it because you turn everything into avi?

You do know that by recompressing you lose a lot of quality?

There's a few episodes of ""Swamp People"" in AVI that are really unwatchable, while the 720p version of those same episodes is really crisp. What's the reason for uploading bad quality, recompressed  AVI's ?"
