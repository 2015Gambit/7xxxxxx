Type: Anime-TV series
English: Future Diary


All episodes AVI format.
(Will play on anything without any codecs as far as I know)
video-Width:720
video-Height:480



Excuse episodes 11-20, I used a subtitle extractor to get them to show after converting the video format. I thought it was important to keep the files with the same video type. I intend on ripping the other episodes when they are released.
This is a compile of the episodes i have found to date.


Feel free to request (anyfucking) anime. I'll try to find it and compile it.
