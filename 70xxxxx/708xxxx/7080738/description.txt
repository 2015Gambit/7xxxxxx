Prager 20120305  3 Buried the Lead

Prager H3 Charlie Sykes fills in for Dennis. Cardinal Timothy Dolan sent a letter on Friday to all the Catholic bishops 
of the United States stating the Catholic Church will fight President ObamaΓÇÖs healthcare mandate that the church pay for
 contraceptives. Rather than cover this development, the media ran wild with RushΓÇÖs insensitive comments.

 Also, the Journal of Medical Ethics says newborn babies are not ΓÇ£actual personsΓÇ¥ and do not have a ΓÇ£moral right to lifeΓÇ¥. 
The ethicists also argue that parents should be able to have their baby killed if it turns out to be disabled when it is
 born.

Prager H2 Charlie Sykes fills in for Dennis. Entitlements used to be coupled with a work component, 
but due to the explosion of welfare in the 60's, government assistance has become a vehicle to appease the masses. 
The left wing media has pounced all over Rush Limbaugh for his contraception remarks but no one on the left is being 
held to the fire for their hate-filled comments about the passing of Andrew Breitbart.

 government than in the manufacturing sector, we have become a nation of takers rather than makers. Callers weigh in.
