,sumosmurf,2012-03-10T01:18Z,"Can anyone confirm this as legit? Nothing listed @ http://fanedit.org, nothing listed by searching Google. Plus the 13Gb size makes me think this is fake."
,SpoonWielder,2012-03-10T01:53Z,"It's legit, it's a fan-edit I made myself. It's not on fanedit.org cause I didn't know the site existed. I'm just a marvel fan. There's a forum dedicated to Timeline here;

,marioxb,2012-03-23T13:26Z,"It's not fake, it's a fan edit, and it's great! Now, SpoonWeilder, I just have to ask, you didn't follow DIrishB's timeline very closely, I see. Now, I didn't watch the whole thing yet, but I'm wondering why you did it the way you did, and do you have a ""timeline"" of your version?"
,SpoonWielder,2012-03-23T20:23Z,"I used Andrew Norfolk's timeline for the most part;
http://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/5395/A-Marvel-Cinematic-Universe-Timeline/
There been a few differences between his and mine since some of the Avengers comics have come out though."
,dp_pirate,2012-04-24T16:06Z,Is there anyway to get an HD (at least 720p) version of this edit?  It is freakin awesome.
,SpoonWielder,2012-04-25T20:12Z,I'm working on getting it to a better quality. Should be done soon. More than likely after Avengers comes out though. 
,PirtateMonkey,2012-04-26T03:14Z,"Great torrent and great editing, me and my mates watched it all of today to get ready for the avengers movie tomorrow and it just blow up away :)

there was a little bit of a issue in part5 with the audio going out of sync in a scene from Thor but that fixed itself after abut 5 minutes when it cut to the deleted scene of Thor and Erik Selvig walking back from the bar.

Question to SpoonWielder:
When im looking at the files it has the cover art on them as the thumbnail.....how did you manage to do this?
also great work :)"
,SpoonWielder,2012-04-26T06:28Z,"Yeah the audio sync problem was the first problem I fixed with the HD version. 

PirtateMonkey: Just loaded up the files in iTunes (cause they're mp4) and right clicked and hit Get Info. Then just change the album artwork to the posters and it changes the thumbnails."
,PirtateMonkey,2012-05-01T00:44Z,"ahhh i see thank you, thats awesome.

shame i would have to convert all my videos to MP4 for that to work (could take some time with the amount i have lol)
i'll give it a go though....thanks for the info :)"
,toutesuite,2012-05-02T03:18Z,"Can't wait for the HD version. Are you considering any alterations of the timeline? I noticed a few changes that seemed to make a lot of sense, especially one scene in Iron Man 2 (""There's a situation in the southwest"") that kind of pushes the Iron Man II timeline further into Thor territory."
,chuckufarley,2012-05-08T07:28Z,"Part of your audio sync problem may be because you have the video as 30i.

I can't even figure how you would have done that since at worst you should have gotten 29.97i by not removing pulldown flags.

Either you have extra frames that don't belong or the video is playing back .03 fps too fast.

If you release a new version, try to get to 23.976p.

It won't stop me from watching it though.  Thanks for the hard work."
,SpoonWielder,2012-05-09T20:57Z,"Higher Quality version here;
