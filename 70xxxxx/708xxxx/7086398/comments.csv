,JWRBlack,2012-03-09T23:17Z,Since 1204 the single DVD update can install the new version 4 of Jeppview. You can have V3 removed by the installation or just leave it (it will be updated).

,icepilots,2012-03-11T02:08Z,"I'm not so sure about the FliteMap updates. It installed new terrain and nav data - but as of this update, it still shows the chart version to be 1203 - which expired 20+ days ago..."
,precursor1188,2012-03-11T06:22Z,"@icepilot
the new dvd format updates my flitestar/flitemap as well. when you run the setup did you observe the dialogue box that informs what's being updated? You should see the fliteStar line saying that it will be updates. have you updated to the v9550? maybe this could be the problem. get it from J website."
,precursor1188,2012-03-11T06:38Z,"@perroazul
plse download Jeppview 3.2 + Cycle 0901. install the program and install the outdated 0901 data. when everything is running ok with the outdated data then you update with this dvd."

@Capt_Nemo: is it possible to get the piece of software that allows you to convert the garbage names in the sbscrips.dbf into readable names?"
,icepilots,2012-03-12T14:44Z,"precursor1188: It updated the terrain and what looked to be the nav data - but didn't update the chart data.

I tried installing JeppView as well which went without a hitch - but the chart data is still out of date in flitemap...

Yes, its 9.5.5.0 on Windows XP."
,precursor1188,2012-03-12T16:31Z,"@icepilots
not sure where is your problem. however I can confirm that enroute navdata, airport charts are updated with this 1205 dvd. the first screen upon flitestar startup shows all data current. suggest you re-install flitestar now that you have jeppview installed. the airport charts are now in the common folder."

,jai_hind,2012-03-20T06:50Z,"1.Disconnect Internet
2.Set computer clock for Jan 10, 2009
3.select both Jeppview and Flitedeck programs
4.use as name : PILOTS
5.use serial : VNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F ( this will give you Full Worldwide access )

now you need the other two CDs.

install CD1 using following 2 serials:

for VFR Europe : 217AN22318
for Full Worldwide : 217AN22319

install CD2 (no serial here...)

6.Do not reboot
7.Run Jeppview or Flitedeck
8.Program prompts for 30-day free use or Activation
9.press NEXT
10.Select ""by phone"" option and press NEXT
11.use the code R00D-KCAB (r-zero-zero-d) not ROOD (r-o-o-d) !!!!

12. set now the current date on computer clock !!!"
