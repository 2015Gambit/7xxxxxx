I can't believe all the stuff you share here is original to TPB, I have most of it. No problem, if so, but are you running a search before you upload? We want to avoid duplicate torrents because it dilutes the seed swarm and both of the duplicates tend to drop out...just a FYI."
,_SnakEye,2012-03-08T10:27Z,"aarque
yes, I am also trying to avoid Duplicates.
so I only post things that I have not seen in the past in TPB.
I will pay more attention on my next posts to be sure no one else beet me on that before I post.
thanks for the heads up."
