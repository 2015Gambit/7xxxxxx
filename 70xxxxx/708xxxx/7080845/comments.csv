,TaylorBA,2012-03-09T09:06Z,80MB episodes are not 720p
,JD1992,2012-03-10T05:30Z,You need to do some research on resolution. It is the proper resolution at a lower bit rate. There are no better available for the first two seasons. It is 720p.

,JD1992,2012-03-10T23:57Z,"I stand corrected, but seeing as this is a cartoon.. 6.5 GBs for no noticeable difference is not worth it. I've watched the two and they look nearly identical."
,Tiny Turtle ,2012-03-12T14:23Z,"Why rename the source files? It just makes it so much harder to figure ut which subtitle files are compatible when you have removed ""IMMERSE"" or whatever. :/"
,JD1992,2012-03-18T05:32Z,That's my standard file naming scheme for my TV collections. When this is reuploaded as season 3 completes I will include subtitles.

,swampmatt,2012-04-27T17:09Z,"as for the comment about 80mb files not being 720p - -

All I can say is I'm amazed at the quality of those images!!!  If this was a continous-tone (photo) then the complaint about 80mb not being HD may be valid, but this is animated so it works GREAT! 

When I convert these to MP4's (my preferred format for my AppleTV) they expand into average of 380MB files. So if you want a large file, that's it. 380MB for 21 minutes of video can pass for HD. Abd the quality is still superb!

Don't knock it until you try it!"
