In Confidence: David Attenborough
The guest is the acclaimed broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough who joins Laurie Taylor to discuss his distinguished career, talking about everything from how he first got into television to what he has learned over the last five decades making films all over the world. Having been offered a job with the BBC before he'd ever even watched television, Attenborough's big break came in the early 1950s with a show called Zoo Quest. But what attracted him to zoology in the first place?
