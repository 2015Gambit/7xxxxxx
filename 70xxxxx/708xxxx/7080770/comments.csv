,sammyboblammy,2012-03-06T16:45Z,"I will second the motion above. Gave a quick looksie and even the dark scenes were good 
a: 6
v: 7

Especially brilliant for a cam and fortunately in the darker scenes there a a few shot looking throughvnight vision since it is about navy seals. Thank you for the great upload LegendET.

a: 9 (some background noise)
v: 8  (some dark scenes but otherwise perfect)

There were subs where need be and the quality was great. I did watch on a smaller screen but after running through convertXtoDVD it came out well too. Excellent upload +1 my friend. "

,TheAsset,2012-03-07T22:45Z,"meh, i actually think Special Forces was a better movie.
this was OK but Special Forces had better battles & the hardware on show was like hardcore porn.
big thx for the UL though, was worth a look.
a-6 -v-7....best out atm.
hard to see what's going on in the battles & actors all sound like Darth Vader."

,westie420uk,2012-04-10T17:57Z,"Thanks for the upload, but i thought it was quite a poor copy. The audio was ok, but the picture was very blurry & it went out of focus a lot. Its the type of film where you need to see as much detail as pos. Watchable if you really want to see it, but i would wait for a better copy. I will deffo watch again when a better copy is up."
