,NETAI,2012-08-25T15:35Z,A great copy for a classic movie. Thanks!
,red2silver,2012-09-13T22:13Z,"Simply awesome. The quality made my jaw drop like Jim Carrey's in The Mask.

Somehow I feel YIFY's animated rips r better than normal ones - maybe because theres no sense of depth in animation which is normally sacrificed during compression for normal feature films.
Any1 please let me know if there seems 2 b any other reason - I just wanted to know this out of curiosity.
+1 from me
100 / 10 if thats possible :)"
