,lmfao20,2012-03-09T22:27Z,"Hell I will take some Russian Language classes if I have too, LMAO"
[T],despo1ler,2012-03-10T00:23Z,"instead of moaning about wanting an english version how about thanking the uploader for providing a decent video source which someone will be able to telesynch an english soundtrack to, possibly the 1 from the arabic subbed cam rip that I saw earlier.
 If you aren't going to contribute anything towards making an english version then pls keep quiet an be patient."
,SUFC,2012-03-10T04:43Z,"moaning fookers!!!! go out and cap some line and sync it yourselfs....
do any of you ever think that encoders sometimes grab stuff from public trackers such as the pirate bay....
Thanx to the uploader for putting this out..."
,sandisexmagnet,2012-03-10T04:58Z,i like falcons
,izzydeak,2012-03-10T05:12Z,For all the lazy ppl out there I am in the works on the english version so give me sometime it will be released asap. Its the combination of the russian video and english audio with the first 8:24 cut off to match the audio 
,maxmaxpayne,2012-03-10T09:12Z,"@izzydeak
is that 8 min 24 seconds missing, why don't you just put video with no audio in the firs 8min 24 seconds ????"
,maxmaxpayne,2012-03-10T09:13Z,"and lol, so many of the cam movies i dl here are done in russia."
,FamilyGuyFan,2012-03-10T12:15Z,"@izzydeak - What do you mean lazy people...don't you mean non-russian speaking people? How the fuck does not speaking russian equate to being lazy? That makes me culturally challenged at best...lol. 

Nice upload."

,Horatio28,2012-03-10T18:17Z,"@FamilyGuyFan
I'm afraid your assumption is misplaced and faulty.
I do indeed doubt that izzydeak, meant his comment as an insult to Russians and I see no indication in his comment that would back your assumption. In fact, your the one calling all non-native Russian speaking people lazy, am I right? Now, we should all stop generalizing since it's not fair and it's morally wrong.

Great Job, Maxrus, good upload.

Stop posting this...."
,Shadowym,2012-03-11T23:57Z,"Good to see the MPAA's crack down on Canadian CAMs reducing piracy....NOT.

For awhile there they were saying most piracy was because of Canadian CAMS.  Apparently they can't do that anymore and good luck cracking down on Russian movie theaters.....clowns!"
,anubisavi,2012-03-12T02:45Z,"Actually in russia you don't have to wait for the movie to premier to get a cam copy. All theaters get the movie a week before it is premiered. In some cases 2 days. during special screenings, lets just say for employees , some dude with a hefty wallet comes and gets a cam copy which he sells to distributors who make 1000s of dvds to market for 3 to 4 $ a pop. We get it for free over the net of course. Copyright enforcement in Russia is a hollywood thing ..how much $$ will they pay extra for the police to actually go out and make seizures (that will happen to super blockbusters) . Otherwise no one cares "
,colcaboom,2012-03-14T09:24Z,"@ despo1ler : I digress, fuck the uploader and his russian piece of shit attitude, no one needs anymore clowns on TPB, we'll just take the content from trusted regulars who are not retarded and can put a ""audio rus"" if the case be in the torrent's name, so ppl don't have to fucking download it to find out."
,IsoSucks,2012-03-18T04:39Z,"Well from the people who have stated its not in English and how good of a video
 did you stop to read the INFO ? 


good upload thanks and now to wait for someone else to finish the job for FREE so stop your bitching and get a life "
,steplogical1,2012-03-27T02:13Z,"@Horatio28 - Familyguyfan wasn't talking about Russians. It just read that way. Since you're obviously intelligent, one would think you'd have comprehended what he was saying. He was wondering why Izzydeak referred to us as ""lazy"" people because we don't speak Russian."
,MetlHead,2012-03-27T14:33Z,"wot ... no bloody comments for this movie yet? ... geez I'll wait till there are comments about it, thanks."
,MetlHead,2012-03-27T14:34Z,"haha just as I finished typing, and clicked on ""submit"" the comments showed up, lol."
