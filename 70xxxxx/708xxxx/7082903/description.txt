You are a ninja.

Your god-like speed, dexterity, jumping power, and reflexes are all the result of an amazing fast metabolism; sadly, so is your natural lifetime of 15 minutes.

like all ninjas, you have an unquenchable thirst for gold, a natural propensity for exploring rooms infested by increasingly lethal ninja-killing robots, and a devout belief in N.

N," the way of the Ninja", is a highly advanced system of spiritual, coqnitive, and physical training.

It emphasizes pacifism, humility, and the need to traverse a series of 5 rooms before the end of your lifetime; a feat known only as "beating episode".

In accordance with the teachings of N, it is your profound hope that one day you will develop the skill, intelligence, and inexplicable ability to reincarnate necessary to achieve mastery of all 100 episodes.
