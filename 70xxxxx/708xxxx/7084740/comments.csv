,cmac86,2012-03-08T01:59Z,im not gonna bother uploading anymore torrents. too many hit and runners. shouldnt waste my time.
,smilingze,2012-03-08T03:57Z,"Sorry I am new to this , so a game like this one , how do I burn it to play it on my 360 ? 1.86 GIB seems very small for a game , right ?"
,branimir2000,2012-03-08T08:58Z,"Hi cmac86,

It doesn't look to me as if there are too many hit and runners for your torrent - there are 77 seeders and 18 leechers at the moment.
Now, about Alan Wake - would it be playable on non-jtaged consoles? If so, I would be very gratefull if you could put it up! My upload is 10MBit, so I promise I would seed!

Cheers!"
