I Am Alive is an action video game developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and published by Ubisoft. It was released on Xbox Live Arcade at March 7, 2012 and will be released on the PlayStation Network in spring.[5] The developers released the official release date for the Xbox 360 version via Facebook as March 7, 2012.[6]

The game takes place in the fictional American city of Haventon, one year after the Event, a worldwide cataclysmic event that wiped out most of the human civilization and left the world in ruins and barely habitable, with the ground now covered by a toxic cloud of dust and ash. I Am Alive focuses on facing the permanent insecurity of a now decaying and hazardous world, and humanity's darkest inclinations.

Originally under development by Darkworks from 2008 until 2010, Ubisoft Shanghai has since worked on the title.
