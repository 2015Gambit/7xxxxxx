Crashday v1.2 no-cd exe.

Works also in Crashday 1.0 and 1.1 !

Just unpack with winrar or winzip.
Put it in your main crashday directory/map.

Now you can join the V1.2 games online



btw end 2009 Atari stopped the Crashday MasterServer.

The New Master Server is since then hosted by player RichDutch from The Netherlands.
