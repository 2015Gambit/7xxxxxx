,Kalei808,2012-03-20T08:25Z,"Can someone PLEASE help me! I've been using this site forever, and I just tried to download this torrent, and several other ones, and when I click download, it downloads this codec m file (is that bad?) I'm afraid to click it!

Also if I try and other links to ""Get this torrent"" etc, it just opens up Limewire.  PLEASE HELP!  Thank you!"
,jojoxx,2012-03-31T10:30Z,"@kalei808-anytime you download a torrent, you need to have a program (such as Limewire, Utorrent, ect) that does the actual downloading. Your computer needs an application to get the file, just like you need a type of browser (internet explorer, safari, firefox) in order to get to a website. This is normal operating procedure. Hope that helps. "
,skadee,2012-05-20T13:44Z,"@Kalei808  don't click where it says download, click where it says ""get this torrent"" it's a magnet link-  accidentally did the same thing at first. "
