ENCODER'S NOTES..: The video source was taken from mSD Rip and we have to change the framerate of the video since it won't sync well with our English Audio, finally we have an English version Audio muxed with the French Bluray.

Source Subs too went out of sync because of the change in framerate, so we had to use the subs we had , 
anyways original subs have been included for anyone who can sync them well.
Enjoy...
