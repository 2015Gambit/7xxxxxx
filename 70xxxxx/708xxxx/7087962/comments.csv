,greenwheel,2012-03-09T18:21Z,Wait this is all rars. Fuck this I'm getting the other one since the user took the time to unrar it first. Rars are only usefull for ftp transfers and the like. Not for torrents...
,h8iSgZPj2,2012-03-09T21:57Z,fuck rar crap. sceneline is a shameless moron
,Orion765,2012-03-10T00:52Z,It takes 10 seconds to unrar! wtf is ur problem!!
,pirate_demo,2012-03-10T07:10Z,"It seems to be broken for me.

.rar has never been a video format."
,Goudy,2012-03-10T17:52Z,"Downloaded, working great."
,akoehler,2012-03-12T03:11Z,"I can't believe what I'm reading here lol. .rar means that the file is compressed and, with winrar, very easy to extract. Usually takes two clicks of the mouse for me. It makes the transfer more secure as well in my opinion. 

On another note, looks great! A/V 10/10. Much thanks to the uploader."
,subethernet,2012-03-12T07:47Z,"People spend alot of time making video codecs like h.264 and mp4 etc etc these are designed to compress the living hell out of video files.  If you need to rar a file then either you're crazy or stupid.  You would generally only save a percent or two of file size when rar'ing, alternatively encode it right the first time and there will be no need"
,mothymandinga,2012-03-12T11:27Z,Works fine for me. Thanks.
,MasterBrain25,2012-03-15T01:47Z,"Lol, bitches don't know how to extract a .rar file, i mean, to know around here you have to have that kind of knowledge."
