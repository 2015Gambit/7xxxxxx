,darkfrost,2012-03-28T18:53Z,Man I didn't think I had a chance in hell of completing this download with only 1 seeder but it finally finished. UNBELIEVABLE! BIG Thanks to seeder and the uploader! This is some fucking rare and hard to find shit!! I'm gonna seed this until I see those seed numbers rise. SEED PEOPLE!!!!
[T],Sackilla666,2012-04-01T19:58Z,Right on darkfrost.  I know I love this album.  Just to bad not many folks are hip to it.  I'll be seeding these for awhile for sure & hopefully the DL'ing speed picks up.
