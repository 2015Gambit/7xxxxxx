,Fuel87,2012-03-08T15:54Z,I'll comment here as it's your latest post I love your releases but I was wondering if you could do a pack for Fantastic Four 588 up until whatever was the latest? I cant find 588 or or few further and then the arc hits something new if you could it would be awesome!
,Fuel87,2012-03-08T15:55Z,TY for all you do here btw
