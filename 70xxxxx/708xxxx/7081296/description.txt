Details:

The MenΓÇÿs debut LP, Leave Home, is an eight-course feast curated and prepared by Black Flag, Guy Picciotto, Sleep, and Queens of the Stone Age, but it leaves a singular aftertaste that is all its own. From the bowels of Brooklyn basement-jammers and loft shows, The Men arrive with their first LP on Sacred Bones, attacking the current scene with a full cache of influences. Fractured, gaunt sounds are bolstered with the barks of hardcore, the drones of gaze, and the ceaselessness of psych. Wide-open jams are juxtaposed with claustrophobic, psychotic fits. ItΓÇÖs a bad trip you wonΓÇÖt want to come down from.
