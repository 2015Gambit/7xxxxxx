Xubuntu is a community developed operating system that is well-suited for laptops and desktops. Whether you use it at home, at school or at work Xubuntu contains all the applications youΓÇÖll ever need, from word processing and email applications, to web server software and programming tools.

Xubuntu is and always will be free of charge. You do not pay any licensing fees. You can download, use and share Xubuntu with your friends, family, school or business for absolutely nothing.

We issue a new Xubuntu release every six months. That means youΓÇÖll always have the latest and greatest applications that the open source world has to offer.

Xubuntu is designed with security in mind. You get free security updates for at least 18 months and with the Long Term Support (LTS) version you get three years support. There is no extra fee for the LTS version, we make our very best work available to everyone on the same free terms. Upgrades to new versions of Xubuntu are and always will be free of charge.

Everything you need comes on one CD, providing a complete working environment. Additional software is available online.

The graphical installer enables you to get up and running quickly and easily. A standard installation should take less than 25 minutes.

Once installed your system is immediately ready-to-use. We provide you with a desktop offering that includes a full set of productivity, internet, drawing and graphics applications, and games.
