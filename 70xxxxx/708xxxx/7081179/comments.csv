[V],ChattChitto,2012-03-08T00:15Z,"@xenia05
I know :/ my sincere apologies to you and everybody else! I'm terribly sorry for putting the wrong key in my release, the last weeks were crazy and i by mistake inserted the wrong key, a non HD key yet working properly for DVD's.
@amiga1000 my apologies to you too.
I'll make sure this mistake doesn't happen again no matter how busy i am.

Finally thank you all for your trust in [ChattChitto RG]! Freedom of sharing :)"
,hardkh,2012-03-08T06:07Z,Thanks ChattChitto
,sleerf,2012-03-12T02:39Z,"OK. First of all, thanks ChattChitto for always being there with the latest version! Thanks for being reliable, trustworthy, and thanks for the awesome music that plays with your installer. :-) 
I just wanted to let you know that this most recent version is set to automatically check for updates. I think historically you have disabled this so I didn't even have to go back in and uncheck the box in the settings. I didn't know if this was something that changed or something you overlooked while you were busy. I certainly am not complaining. I just thought you might want to know. Thanks again for all your stuff!"
,hardkh,2012-03-12T04:07Z,"Can you do the latest 7.0.2.0 please
cheers"
,naebeth,2012-03-12T13:47Z,"I'm getting the error that the key provided isn't valid for BluRays, only DVDs. 
Any chance of a download link for a working key?"
,b1grud,2012-03-13T11:52Z,"Hi Chat,
