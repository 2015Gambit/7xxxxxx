,Rockfrilla,2012-03-08T00:26Z,"So here are some updates:
the installation went very smooth just use the keygen and copy the crack to the sims 3 folder not the sims 3 showtime folder, the game runs perfectly i'm having real fun playing, so enjoy everybody!!"
,Blackruby,2012-03-08T01:39Z,"The Katy Perry set is an individual download, buy purchasing the game you are given a code, the code is used at the Sims 3 store to download the Katy Perry items. So it doesn't matter what version this is, you can't get the items unless you do that.
If you are smart though, you will know where to go to get this content. I am more awesome than you, so I know this."

Well, fuck customer service... The internet is its own customer service and after a bit of searching I found out all you have to do is.....
....... copy the crack and the .dll file again and go into your installation folder and paste them there. Just delete the files 'TSLHost.dll and TS3W' from the original 'The Sims 3' Folder and replace with the cracked ones. 
 i.e don't load up the game until you've copied the crack again. 
worked for me....

Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!"

,aeristilheartly,2012-05-22T21:43Z,"ALRIGHT listen up here people who are having problems, this is what you do!!!!

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!

,Cannibal_X,2012-06-22T21:51Z,"@maebba,
You need to open the file you downloaded with WinRAR, look for the folder named ""Crack"", extract that to your desktop or somewhere.
After that, follow these steps:
**I know you have a Mac, im posting instructions for Windows. Just improvise and figure it out.**
1. Open ""My Computer or Computer""
2. Go to your C:\ Drive
3. Go to Program Files(x86)
4. Go to Electronic Arts
5. Go to The Sims 3 **Not showtime.. the original**
6. Go to Game
7. Go to Bin
8. Open the folder you extracted earlier named ""Crack"", now highlight all files and drag them into the bin folder. 
9. Copy and Replace
Now open the Sims 3 again and try to play.

,kmi12,2012-07-23T01:44Z,can i update the game after installling this?sorry im newbie here...
,agent17d,2012-07-27T03:06Z,"I just finished downloading this game.  It works 100%.  In my opinion this expansion pack sucks and it just a cheap imitation of a previous expansion pack from sims 2.  

Anywho make sure you dont crack your game!!!  Only mount it.  If you dont like it follow khemphill ideas and it will work.  If for any reason it say it couldnt update then a previous game is corrupting the update to install this game.  

I hope you all able to install it without a problem :)  Happy simming

So I created one of my own went all out still the same thing no one to work the drink bars. Can someone help me figure out how to fix it or is it how it just is in the game now. Because honestly really sux now if that's the case. 

Oh and one last thing I can't find the new showtime magician things and some of the other few performance things. The expansion is working because I have that collection folder with all it's items in it. I tried to have a club with different shows and things to perform but can't find the things.
