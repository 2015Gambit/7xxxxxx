,k3nd00d,2012-03-07T17:37Z,"@psspss: ep5 had the request for people wanting the be in season 2. But yeah, I think ep6 is end of season 1.

@dudogger: idiot. lefties that are realizing they are really left leaning libertarians and not eco-socialist & eco-fascist totalitarian drones are buying guns and supplies like mad just like the right leaning libertarians that are not corporate fascist & religious totalitarian drones! *muahahaha* myself, I am a agnostic self reliant centrist libertarian...but morons like you think a libertarian means far right (while those drones on the right think libertarians are democrat spies). the left and right establishment and extreme base voters are all about CONTROL and imposing their idiocy on everyone else. you are no doubt one of these brainwashed establishment drones. drones of the establishment are the enemy of freedom loving thinking free minds. the point is ultimately to not have to rely on some distant government controller to help you when you need it, but rely on yourself and those near you...like buying local food or knowing that you can buy a bag of pinto beans at the store and put them in the ground and grow food (until they start irradiating them) rather than from some centrally controlled mystery meat processing plant. you'd be surprised how many people have asked me if they can really grow their own beans or peas or lentils or garbanzo beans from what can be bought in a grocery store. people don't even know and don't even simply try, they just remain helpless and depend on someone else to wipe their asses! PATHETIC!"
,k3nd00d,2012-03-07T18:25Z,"btw, thanks to the ""patriot act"", the most recent NDAA, a certain telecommunications act, various executive orders, programs like echelon and carnivore  and other tia spin-offs, my previous post could earn me a label that could result in my name being put on a list i don't deserve to be on. a list of people to be monitored as essentially potential enemies of the establishment...the new version of national security, where everyday joes are basically treated the same as a potential or active terrorist. oops, i've got keywords in this post too. that's double bad terrorist of me."

,pirateradiorocks2,2012-03-08T01:45Z,"I heard that the US Govt. was going to offer a $10,000 tax free bounty for every illegal man, woman and anchor child turned in. That it was only available to 'real' citizens and was going to run $330,000,000,000 (that's $330 Billion) But, what got me was the fact that it would cost less to pay out the bounties on all 33,000,000 illegals than it would to support them on Federal, State benefits/monies for 3 months. That it would take less than 1 year to do so was just amazing! Seems this same info was made available in an internal DHS study in 2010, but the study was taken off the web share point docs after only a couple hours. So, if it is feasible, cost efficient and would open up a crap load of jobs to Americans, why won't the US Govt. Do it?"
[V],psspss,2012-03-08T02:49Z,"settle down on the comments geeh

join a forum and view your mind.. stick to on topic
for the torrent itself

anyhow I saw a docu once that said illegals
add value to american (after all your all illegals
you came from other countries and took over
from the natives :)

who else will do the crap work in your country
if you get rid of them. cos they do any thing
to live under the radar"
