I converted this from HD source to xvid take it or leave it 
BUT HELP SEED if grabbing

note I think this is Season Finale as only 6 episodes are listed
on main site and movie database.. perhaps its a mid season break

A Georgia man stockpiles food, fuel and weapons, fearing an imminent economic collapse will bring violence and rioting to his suburban town; a Colorado man collects seeds to grow his own food in the event of a radioactive disaster; a California man builds spider holes throughout the Sierra Nevada Mountains, planning to disappear underground while chaos reigns during the next economic depression
