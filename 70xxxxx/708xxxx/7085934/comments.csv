,Xpatriated,2012-03-08T22:10Z,"I haven't been uploading supernatural lately (almost no hits), but it's out, so I guess I'll do that.  Hawk and Dove (yech) still hasn't been scanned.  Probably because it is an atrocity both written and drawn by Rob ""Talentless"" Liefeld, but that's just a guess."

,Maddogsargent,2012-03-09T14:17Z,"I've just been downloading the New 52 recently, I began reading them which really got me into DC, then stopped as I began collecting the old DC, starting on Infinite Earths then making my way to flashpoint, so I've got a lot of reading to do!

I've heard quite a lot of people say some of the New 52 series aren't up to normal standards, but I think I saw on the DC website that one of the main aims was to bring in new readers, consider this job well done on me!"
