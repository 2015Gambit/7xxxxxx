Part 2 of 2 of the Monkees Greatest Hits on Video.  Thanks to the original seeder on Demonoid from which these tracks were extracted and cut into music video tracks ready for import into the playout software of your choice.   This is a service for VJ's who do not have the time, software or knowledge to split music DVD's into single tracks for use in professional video Discotheques.   Rigmar Radio recommends OtsAV DJ for Video and Karaoke glitch free playback.   There excellent Beat Mixing, Video transitions and smooth, smooth playback make it the professional's choice over the cheaper and more common Virtual DJ, PC DJ and all the rest.

If like me you have a large music collection then Ots is really the ONLY choice for the rest fall over when you try and re index a collection of more than 40 thousand tracks!!!  None of them integrate Karaoke Audio and Video in the one collection using a single file format.

Needless to say OtsAV DJ provided this listing below:
