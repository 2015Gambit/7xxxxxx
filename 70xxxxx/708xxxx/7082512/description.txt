                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Nineteen-year-old Nic Hamilton sets out to become a racing driver, entering the 
 highly competitive Clio Cup to prove he has what it takes. Nic is no ordinary 
 would-be speedster however - he suffers from cerebral palsy and his brother is 
 Formula One star Lewis Hamilton, who is on hand for advice. But Nic's disability 
 and lack of experience behind the wheel mean he is facing tough odds to finish 
 each race in one piece - and when a high-speed accident threatens to end his 
 career before it has really begun, it takes every ounce of courage to get back in 
 the driving seat. 

        
                                 Enjoy!
