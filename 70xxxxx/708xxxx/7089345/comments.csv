 Google takes me to at least a dozen solutions... what's wrong with yours?"
,splarty,2012-03-10T18:23Z,"You don't need to convert mkv files.

mkv is just a ""container"", inside that container the video file is typically (but not always) an mp4 file.

All that you need is a program that will change the container (Quicktime, ffmpeg, mpeg stream clip, sublet, in fact most software that encodes video all have an option called ""passthrough"" which is graphics speak for ""do not re-encode"" ... if the video codec is MP4 just use one of these programs save the format as MP4 and ""passthrough"" the video and audio .. all that does is put it in a new ""container"" that is now MP4).

Obviously this is not a detailed description but just google """"passthrough"" mkv mp4 "" and you will get hundreds of links to explain how to do it."

Although I feel for ppl who lost a loved one on 9/11, PEOPLE DIE ALL THE TIME from things that aren't their fault. Most of the time there is no media attention, or financial settlement.
Throughout the movie it seemed more like an adult trying to pretend to be a kid than a kid. Maybe it would have worked better as a 20 y.o. guy remembering his experience in the 1st person??? Maybe a girl??? 
THANKS for the movie, though."
,altonina,2012-04-01T09:37Z,"I really don't like how the script had this kid define himself as having Asperger's ""disease"". Kid's with Asperger's are smart but have trouble socializing and need to work on things like conversing back-and-forth and eye-contact. His parent's seemed educated and gave him lots of attention. 
I have never heard anyone call it Asperger's a ""disease"", and it really sucks that they just put that out there like it's nothing. Asperger's is a label and thanks to this movie it's a disease as well!"
,altonina,2012-04-01T10:29Z,"...I realized something in my previous statement and I don't want anyone to misunderstand.
I ONLY mentioned the parents in the movie because I can't imagine him being tested for Aspie's and believing it to be a ""disease"", unless the parent's are really ignorant. His parent's were caring & supportive (not ignorant), and he was a smart kid who would have asked many questions about it.
Asperger's, like ADD, has ABSOLUTELY NO RELATION TO INCOME. It's not as well-known as ADD or ADHD, but IT IS NOT A DISEASE. Like kids w/ ADD, ADHD, Aspie kids ARE also smart."
