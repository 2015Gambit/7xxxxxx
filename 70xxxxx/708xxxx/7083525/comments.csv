32g was banned for ""uploading child model torrents that violate the rules of our site."""
,slowquin,2012-03-07T20:30Z,@WHZ this girl intrigues me or at least the preview does....With her pretty face and carefree attitude....I wish the Fame-girls website would have gotten her first. I'll see if I can find her on usenet if so I'll up her sets.

,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-08T08:24Z,^Yes he tried very hard to ban me but to no success ! Thx to AK420 and MOD Agricola i'm still here : https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=116351

Yeah i reported you but i wrote ""Still i am not sure.I request a verification "" .

 I reported  32gbusb too and i requested a verification then mods found guilty on him and banned.

and i have no  relation between  AK420 's ban.My hands are innocent on it."
