Metal gear solid 1 converted Both dvd`s into one E-boot.PBP so u can play it on your PSP and easy change disc`s via the Homebutton menu...

I tested it on my PSP E-1004 custom firmware 6.60 B10...

for people who dont know what to do with this file:

unrar (extract) the package and copy the map called: SLES01370  to the PSP/GAME folder of the memorystick of your PSP.

when done u should have: PSP/GAME/SLES01370/Eboot.PBP

disconnect the PSP and play the game... i guess u know where the game is located...

please seed...
