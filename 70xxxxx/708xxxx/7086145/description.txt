Plot:

As the seasons pass, a lone stray cat reminisces of life with his master. He talks of the small passions of their time together, and how their shared affection gives them each a reason to be alive. Speaking both of love gained and love lost, he chronicles the eternal nature of their bond, as despite their own respective heartaches they still have each other. The two converse in a touching tale of the true strength of friendship in the face of hardship.
