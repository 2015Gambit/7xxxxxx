,Ozdl,2012-03-10T04:56Z,Thanks spastik64.
,skyline3d,2012-03-11T17:33Z,why 420 MB? what's wrong with 170 mb? the quality was the same! please make 720p rips around 200 mb like before!
,Realstuff,2012-03-21T11:45Z,What's up with E20???????
,laika_raw,2012-03-23T21:58Z,skyline3D are you retarded or something? this is a 720p the one that are 170MB have a HD source but are reencoded. It is a huge difference in quality if you don't see it you need glasses!
,lattari,2012-03-30T15:39Z,"Indeed, while you can argue that you can have highres in as small a file size you want I still don't think they should be put in this section. Thanks for the up. "
