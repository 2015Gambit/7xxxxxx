Review:

For people who have not listened any of the works of Kawai, this is a perfect chance to do so. The music is constituted by a series of powerful moving vocal tracks, as well as a mixture of other soothing and relaxing tracks that will pump into your skin the feeling of a desolated city.

It possesses rich instrumentalization, such as in Liberi Fatali (of Final Fantasy's VIII soundtrack) or as in the Duel of Fates (of Star Wars Episode I soundtrack). His top-notch highlights in orchestration come to show in tracks #3 and #12, being this last one an aggressive orchestral track of 10 minutes. I, personally have not heard to the date something as moving as this album (in it's own style) and, believe me, it will enchant you and you'll want to listen to it several times. After hearing this soundtrack, you may want to check out the movie too. It's a pretty interesting euro-japanese mixture. (By Jose I. Noguera, Amazon.com)
