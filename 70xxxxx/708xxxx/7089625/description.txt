I have updated the i586 HUMANity iso, it has some new very nice themes thanks to Agust for his great work
As you may have read unity-linux has been through many large changes, one of these has been changing over to using the mandriva cooker repo, this has involved quite a lot of time and work for the unity-linux devs who work very hard.
I am pleased to announce that Agust has made another beautiful unity-linux e17 theme, and is also making another for unity-linux at the moment.
I would also like to thank the enlightenment e17 team for all there work developing enlightenment and their help, especially one person who recently helped me greatly, you know who you are :) this helps me to get e17 pkgs updated easier an quicker.
