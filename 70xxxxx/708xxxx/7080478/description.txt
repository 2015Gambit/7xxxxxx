On February 2nd 2012, Sean David Morton and Project Camelot teamed up for a LiveStream web conference concerning Terence McKenna's TimeWave Zero and the implications for our immediate future in 2012.

Joining Morton, and Kerry Cassidy of Project Camelot, was Joseph Matheny - author of the underground cyberpunk classic "Ong's Hat".  Time travel and the approaching singularity implied by Novelty Theory were the focus of the conversations between Morton and Matheny.  

Author of The Montauk Books, Peter Moon, was also present for this LiveStream event.  The video clip in this torrent consists of the Joseph Matheny segments concerning TimeWave Zero, but an mp3 of the entire radio show broadcast on Sean David Morton's Strange Universe is also included.  The LiveStream video broadcast can be watched on YouTube.
