[T],iamgreat,2012-03-06T20:40Z,"There was a piece in the Huffington Post about how Canada is missing the boat on reality shows. http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/brian-cormier/canadian-reality-tv_b_866696.html The guy basically said that the US had it right with all of the cheap reality shows and that Canadian television was behind-the-times.  Most of the comments are about how wrong the author is. 

""I am metaphorically standing on the dock watching the Reality T.V. boat leave our shores and can honestly say that this is one boat I missed on purpose and hope never docks again.""  I didn't write that but wish i had. My comment apparently was unacceptable and can't be found there. Citytv has the fifth season of Murdoch Mysteries to broadcast and then it will be the only network in Canada without so much as one new or ongoing original scripted series. 

The only non-scripted show i watched all of was Murder In Small Town X and that was mostly because i was curious about how bad it was going to get.  I just finished watching the Jonathan Creek episode with the c-story about the reality show imported from Japan. They wrote into that script an admission the in-show reality show was rigged by the producer to sensationalise things. That does summarise fairly well what i think of all of the competition shows. 

But this is Canadian and it is xvid. That is 2 strikes against eztv or ettv uploading it so i thought to be nice to those who do not agree with me and who might be looking here for it.   The show is on Sunday and Monday night so look for it here early Monday & Tuesday at the earliest.

I check ratings in the U.S. and recently checked Canadian ratings for the first time. Almost all the Top 20 weekly shows are Global and CTV I think. I forget exactly but I remember the Top 3 being BBT, Survivor, Amazing Race. That's excluding cable shows, which I assume would be lower anyway.

But I don't think CityTV had a single show in the Top 20. So I guess they have quite a bit riding on this show, especially given how much money they probably put into it. Airing it head-to-head against The Amazing Race tells me they must have high expectations for it as well.

I can't speak much on actual Canadian content on the networks. Most of the Canadian shows I watch are on cable. Like Lost Girl and Haven. And Breakout Kings. Or is that even Canadian? Not sure. Regardless, I'm glad you're uploading these. The fact that you're posting them, despite not being a fan, says a lot about you. Cuz I don't think I'd put forth an effort towards something I didn't enjoy ..lol. So thank you."
