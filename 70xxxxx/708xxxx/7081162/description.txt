                Canada's Got Talent | s01e02 | Calgary auditions


If you are like my you might think Canada's greatest talent was in keeping this show from existing. The suits at Citytv thought otherwise. They will also be bringing us the Canadian version of The Bachelor later this year. 


But if you like this franchise here is the second ep of the Canadian version. This was broadcast on Citytv on 5 March 2012 and is about the auditions in Calgary. This show got such great promotion i didn't know it existed until after these auditions happened. If i had known of them i would have gone and heckled or protested. It has been how many years now and i still can't forget the promo for the premiere of America's Got Talent on CTV. That little jingle "I wanna be rich, powerful, and famous" still haunts me.
