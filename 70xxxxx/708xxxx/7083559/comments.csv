[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-19T10:24Z,"Video should be Ok . But Audio ? Why only 2 channels 128 kbps AAC?

The answer is: The way is ripped doesn't allow a higher bitrate for this size with AAC, so the choice was 2 channels [and it matches in compatibility with PS3].

Bits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.058  !!!

[much under the minimum 0,100 !! ... and it's 1080p !]


@afterratzz:

If the downloaders enjoy your work...go along this way !

Cheers.
