The band typically compose lengthy guitar-based instrumental pieces that feature dynamic contrast, melodic bass guitar lines, and heavy use of distortion and effects.
Amfrastaso's style has easily identifiable connections to genres like math rock, art rock and occasionally instrumental metal with great influences by bands like Mogwai, Pelican, Mono, P.G. Lost, Isis and Sigur Ros.

Small bands have a really hard time surviving without the support from you - the listener! Every bought song/album will support the band to make more music, 
enriching your world in the process.

So, again - please support the bands out there!
