,deanxavier,2012-03-12T17:21Z,"If you're stuck on 26% stop downloading, give it a chance to get a few more seeders! THEN SEED!"
,GBAnonymous,2012-03-12T17:27Z,Because there's so many damn leechers! It won't let me edit the torrent to add web seeders either so there's nothing I can do I'm afraid :( I'll keep trying to find a solution guys!
,joelhammer1,2012-03-12T18:07Z,Everyone stop leeching for a while. Thanks GBAnonymous for trying to fix this
