Blackmore, the world's smallest Russian stacking doll. Charlie travels
with his hobo friend Levi to the mysterious kingdom of Camelfoot, the
mythical resting place of lost hobo king and his crown. Charlie must
help Levi's uncle, Rufus Ryken, reclaim his rightful throne by solving
three tests of valor and reawakening the hobo blacksmiths of old. Only
then can the crown be reforged, enabling Rufus to become king and unite
the fractured hobo people under one sardine. The Lost Hobo King
features a complete adventure with several new challenges, each with
multiple solutions, an all new assortment of unique dolls with engaging
