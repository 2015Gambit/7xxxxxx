,athina1008,2012-03-10T01:58Z,Thanks a lot!!!
,korsair_13,2012-03-10T09:57Z,"The shortcut that this game makes is called ""Vessel"" and the game itself doesn't run so I am leery of this release. Doesn't do anything when i click the application or the shortcut except start and stop as a process. "
,goldengm,2012-03-11T15:17Z,"I've mounted and installed the game then copied all the files from the skidrow folder to the program files folder but it's still not running.
Could anyone help out?"
,korsair_13,2012-03-11T17:50Z,"Figured it out. You have to right click the app and say ""Run as administrator"""
,JJay254,2012-03-12T00:49Z,Whenever I exit the game my save file is erased. Any idea how to fix that?
,Ntron,2012-03-16T00:40Z,"just run it as administrator, always try the basics before you ask why it wont start."
,aerwev,2012-03-16T17:43Z,"@jjay254 i had same problem with dear esther skidrow release, so i downloaded theta release of this game. it does not have a torrent in piratebay but you can download in 300mb parts from dl sites.

 /i dont know what really is the problem but i use windows 7 64"
,kubenek,2012-04-22T21:27Z,It worked ONCE with 1.0.0.2 and now i cant start the game. win7 64
,japo32,2012-04-24T11:44Z,"Here's what I did to make it work:

1) follow default instructions.
2) delete the ""vessel"" shortcut since it seems wierd.
3) create a new shortcut to stack.exe
4) rightclick new shortcut and click properties
5) go to ""compatibility"" tab and under the ""privilege level"" section check ""Run this program as administrator""

That's it. Windows 7 32 bit."
