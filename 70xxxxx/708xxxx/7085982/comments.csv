,wooleybugger74,2012-03-20T07:02Z,"Can anyone confirm that this works for Photoshop Elements 10?  It says it works for Elements 1-9.  I installed several of the individual plug-ins, but ""Topaz Labs"" does not show up in the Filters like it says it should. . .  Thanks for the upload, but I'm stuck here."
