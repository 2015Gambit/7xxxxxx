,asdfkjjj,2012-03-10T12:49Z,"why not just list the missing files and your operating system etc,  rather than giving us a mystery zip file?"
,digitaldictatorship,2012-03-11T13:06Z,Seeding now for 8 hours straight.
,digitaldictatorship,2012-03-11T13:08Z,"binkw32.dll
NxCooking.dll
PhysXExtensions.dll
readme.txt"
,Epockis,2012-03-11T15:14Z,There are no missing .dll files in reloded. something is fishy about this torrent!
,ovnoglavi,2012-03-11T16:41Z, Hm... This torrent is for missing windows .dll files!!! So there are no mss effect 3 *.dll files involved!
,digitaldictatorship,2012-03-20T19:12Z,"Let me get this right.

I tried to install Mass Effect 3, and than I got an error that these files went missing.

Just notice that I run illegal 64-bits windows, so that's why some files won't be there.

No virusses or anything, trust me."
,kyler211,2012-03-24T07:22Z,"dont waste your time downloading this
the errors are probably because of his inexperience in uploading files by making a rar inside a rar"
