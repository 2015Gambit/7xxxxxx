I downloaded Mass Effect 3, and when I tried to launch it, I got an error that I missed certain .dll files. So I found them scattered all over the internet and now it works just fine.

Installation instructions included :)

I'm running:
Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
Intel Core i5 CPU 650 @ 3.20 GHz processor
4GB RAM
NVIDIA Geforce GT 430
