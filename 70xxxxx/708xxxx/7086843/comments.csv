,grantm44,2012-03-13T09:03Z,is this a virus? it seems like it by the way my anti virus acted. 
,grantm44,2012-03-13T09:36Z,i really want this update can someone please upload one that is legit and not a virus
,FulcrumX,2012-03-14T20:52Z,"this is legit, no virus whatsoever. tried and tested."
,Terminus20,2012-04-16T08:34Z,"Downloading now, will come back if something seems screwy, but please remember that cracks act like a virus. That is why a lot of cracks for games will set your anti-V off. Personally I've never had a crack actually be a real virus. "
,bb4192,2012-05-25T20:38Z,"Might just be me, but i can't move the crack into my directory. It's saying i need administrator permission even though i am on the administrator account. can someone help?"
