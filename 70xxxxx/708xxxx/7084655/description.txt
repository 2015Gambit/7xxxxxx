Classics Album: Stevie Wonder:Songs in the Key of Life 

Taking more than two years from conception to release, Stevie Wonder's classic 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life is now generally accepted as his finest creative hour in an enduring recording career spanning over four decades.
Released on October 9th 1976 Songs In The Key Of Life was a worldwide best seller. It entered the U.S. Billboard album chart at number 1 and remained there for 14 weeks, as well as securing a 44-week chart residency in the Top 40. Songs In The Key Of Life also reached number 2 in the U.K., remaining in the charts for over a year. This outstanding chart success was consolidated when Wonder won 'Album of the Year', 'Best male vocal performance' and was also named 'Producer of the Year' at the 1976 Grammy Awards.
