Had a few probs at first, after I kept getting the message that it could not verify that it was genuine, and asked me to contact customer service...
Well, fuck customer service... The internet is its own customer service and after a bit of searching I found out all you have to do is.....
....... copy the crack and the .dll file again and go into your installation folder and paste them there. Just delete the files 'TSLHost.dll and TS3W' from the original 'The Sims 3' Folder and replace with the cracked ones. 
i.e don't load up the game until you've copied the crack again. 
worked for me....
Hope this helps people with the same problem. Peace Bitches x"
