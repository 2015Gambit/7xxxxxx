HELLO,

THIS IS THE HDD OF MY GAMECRISTAL ARCADE MAME MACHINE. THE MOTHERBOARD DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE, BUT THE HDD IS WORKING GREAT AND MY CABINET IS ALSO GOOD. MAYBE IT IS INTERESTING FOR MANY PPL. SO IF YOU CAN MAKE THIS WORK ON AN STANDART MOTHERBOARD PLEASE LET ME ALSO KNOWN. THERE ARE 5 PAGES WITH EVERYPAGE 10 GAMES I THINK. AND THERE ARE MORE GAME HIDDEN ON THE HDD. SO I THINK IT IS UNLOCKABLE.

THIS IS WORKING ON WIN98 SO MAYBE YOU CAN RUN THIS ON XP OR WINDOWS 7, BUT IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH RUNNING THIS SOFTWARE I CAN ALSO UPLOAD THE IMAGE OF HDD.



FOR PICTURES SEARCH FOR GAMECRISTAL ON GOOGLE AND YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT.


GOOD LUCK ALL.
