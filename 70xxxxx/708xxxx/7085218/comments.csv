Please apply our Ultimate Fix, which can be found on our Forum here: www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com

@Toenails
Doesn't matter, as long as you open the downloaded .rar file using WinRAR only!

@chewy90
It should, but I wasn't able to test that.

@zcmetra
It's smaller, has clear instructions included and we actually provide support if you have any problems.

This is the normal edition, but the Katy Perry and Limited Edition contents can be downloaded from our official MediaFire account. If you don't know what the link is, please check out our website.

@Bulion991
Request the crack via our e-mail, please. We'll then send it to you via e-mail.

@philipakos
Remove all Mods and try again.

[T],Games4theworld,2012-03-11T19:43Z,"Hello,

@ItzMeeBabe
Use the manual patch instead: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1870-can-t-update-the-sims-3-to-v132-fix-manual-patch-updated
And yes, you may use the Simport functions, IF you have at least one store bought The Sims 3 game, from which you can use the serial code to register the game to your The Sims 3 account and use the Simport functions.

@rainieedayy
Yes, some Mac users on our Forum reported that this should work fine on a Mac. Since I have no Mac knowledge at all, I recommend checking their posts/guides here: www.games4theworld.bestgoo.com

@perish_song
Please re-download and re-apply the latest version of the Ultimate Fix: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t752-the-sims-3-ultimate-fix-should-fix-most-of-your-problems
It has been updated recently, to support version 1.32 of the game.

@Patty1042002
There's no .ISO file. Just extract the .rar file using WinRAR (NOTHING ELSE!) and then read the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"".

@BortaMaga
No, this is the normal version. You can download the Katy Perry and Limited Edition contents from our official MediaFire account here: http://www.mediafire.com/?y8uy4gu2y8jqt

@RenatoZG
Why would we password protect the files?
