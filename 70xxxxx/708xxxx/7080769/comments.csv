That link has answer to your question. Basically every Tv program releasing group decided to start using mkv format as it is higher quality and smaller size."
,m412kkuu,2012-03-06T08:31Z,"Also thanks to uploader, finally someone uploading these at good pace"
,mdh99,2012-03-06T08:49Z,@bubbanuggzz Outdated formats???? LOL MKV is NOT an outdated format. Just cos your Xbox can't play them that doesn't make the the format old. LOL!!!!!
,bubbanuggzz,2012-03-06T09:41Z,"@mdh99 i concider any format thats over 2 years old & not used by all media as out dated.thiers a reason avi is compatable with everything.                                                           @m412kkuu i understand the reasoning behind the switch but eztv,vtv,& ettv are still puting up avi along with mkv                                                                       @tvteam nothing but love for the hard work that goes into ur uploads....just no love for mkv"
,bubbanuggzz,2012-03-06T10:04Z,"@m412kkuu i checked that link & mkv is never even brought up.in fact,it says mp4 should be the standerd container for x264(witch does work on more media devices than mkv i might add).thanx for the info,but next time look before you link ;)"
,danrman,2012-03-06T14:15Z,"@bubbanuggzz xenonMKV changes the container to mp4 for you, so that you can play the mkvs on a 360 without entirely re-encoding them. it takes like 5 min a file."
,danrman,2012-03-06T14:16Z,"@bubbanuggzz Oh, and it is freeware."
,riceboysleeps,2012-03-06T14:36Z,@bubbanuggzz you're fucking idiot
,bubbanuggzz,2012-03-06T15:33Z,"@danrman thanx for the tip,ill have to check that out                                                                        @riceboysleeps i think you mean im A fucking idiot.now quiet down,grown ups are talking"
,dohertyben,2012-03-06T18:50Z,"Thanks for the quicker download and better quality by using MKV TvTeam 

Seriously? You are demanding that someone uploads and seeds, at their own time and cost something, in a format that suits your outdated technology? While you sit on your fucking ass and bitch away when 99.9% of people greatly appreciate the effort put in.... "
,riceboysleeps,2012-03-06T18:58Z,"@bubbanuggzz yes, that's what I meant, you're just an idiot again for confirming it"
,TauraCasanove,2012-03-06T20:00Z,I love you for getting Skins up in good time! 
,piratebooty71,2012-03-06T22:35Z,i am disappointed with your new format msd or whatever it is . ps3 and xbox unfriendly .i refuse to watch these on my laptops small screen or take forever to convert the files. sorry but u used to b my go to guys 4 shows.
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-07T04:20Z,"love the new x264 mkv.
Smaller file size and Superior video quality over xvid/avid."
,mdh99,2012-03-07T10:29Z,"@bubbanuggzz Again, just cos your Xbox 360 won't play a certain file doesn't make it out of date or old. MKV is actually newer then AVI. AVI is a VERY old format.

Is bluray an outdated format?? You're xbox can't play them, so they must be."
,siiix,2012-04-08T14:04Z,i love mkv super quality for the file size... THANK YOU
,kjmg321,2012-07-05T11:48Z,so when i download torrents i put it on my usb n watch it on my tv but when its a mkv file or a mp4 it wont work only avi does why is this ??????
