Skins.S06E07.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 218MB]

[/b][/color] Fast-paced and full of angst-ridden fun, this British drama may be based on teenage characters and aimed at a teenage audience, but its content is strictly adult.
Watch as eleven teens struggle with highly-charged issues of race, religion, sexuality, drugs, and food disorders.
With a solid set of good actors, expect the drama to consist of a lot of well-played emotional ups and downs.
