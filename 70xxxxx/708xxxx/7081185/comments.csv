,-darkangl-,2012-03-06T13:51Z,Are these coming naturally in .jp2 format or are you converting them?  Seems odd that they'd be using an almost unused format for their images.
,futureshock999,2012-03-06T14:51Z,"AVOID THIS!!!  Infraview states that these .jp2 files are trying to load DLLs with the same name as the picture files.  Which is why these could be the relatively unknown .jp2 format in the first place.  Could be an error, but why risk it?"
,polx73,2012-03-06T15:24Z,"used to format *.jp2
