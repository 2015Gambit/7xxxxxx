I've not seen a version of ultraedit without a hitchhiker in a long long time"
,davidku,2012-03-22T20:36Z,"I downloaded and tried but not working.

a) patched the host file
b) enter any words in 
- license : strictly for evaluation only
- password : 1234567890

c) click activate and it says invalid server response which is normal because host file was patched.

d) then i run the keygen.
nothing in the drop down box that i can select v18.00

so, i use v17.x

i put user code 1 : strictly for evaluation only
user code 2 : 1234567890

and hit generate but nothing appear.

seems like not a workable patch."
