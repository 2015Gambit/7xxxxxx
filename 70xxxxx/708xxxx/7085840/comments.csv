Also when you have dual sound cards, it sometimes uses the wrong DSP with this fucked up format. Also pixealation occurs when directshow plays theese and DWM is enabled. And also battery time on laptops turn sour when playing these crap files.

Once again... Keep it simple, keep the xvid releases until there is something better, that uses LESS power to render, i do not care about file sizes and neither does mot people."
