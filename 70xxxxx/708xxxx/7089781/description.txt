Autoevony is a bot for use in Evony online browser game, it allows you to cheat by automatically doing tasks for you like farming for food or upgrading buildings to training your troops, to use Autoevony is against the EULA from Evony.com

Many on the designers website suggest improvements, some good, but lately they haven't been so good, and now starting to ruin the online game, you can download the AutoEvony bot from here after registration http://forum.duelingelectrons.com/

The source code is a guarded secret, and even though the Dueling Electronic mob stole the bot off the original owner, they won't release it, so I decided to DE-compile the code, and upload it so you can do what you want with it, I DE-compiled it back as far as I can without destroying it, I have reassembled it again and found to work without errors.

So!! If you know lots about Java and Action Scripts and don't like any features in this bot or want to change the fonts or window sizes for 1024x768 then here download this, do the mods you like, and if you like release your version with your improvements.

Enjoy!!
