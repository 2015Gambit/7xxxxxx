Another World is the second full studio album delivered by Queen guitarist, Brian May. Recorded at his home studio after the completion of the last Queen album, Made in Heaven, the album was released in the UK on 1 June 1998 and on 15 September of that year in the US. The album itself started life out as a cover album. The "Heroes" concept was to record his favourite tracks from his favourite artists, but the idea soon mutated into a full album. Some of the covers found their place on the album, whilst others were released as B-sides to singles and on the Another World tour promo CD.

Drummer Cozy Powell died in a car accident before the album was completed.
