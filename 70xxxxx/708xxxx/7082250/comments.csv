,whmxtra,2012-03-10T21:55Z,I will when it airs and I can find an online source
,slaboteur,2012-03-13T14:40Z,"this is a hard program to find, your efforts are much appreciated"
,whmxtra,2012-03-15T00:06Z,"Still working on this, might have found a new source for it but won't have time till the weekend to try and rip from it."
,ty_uppers,2012-03-16T20:56Z,"Much appreciated!

Too much to ask to upload Jeff Lewis' ""Interior Therapy?"" It just premiered Wed. March 14. I guess they had to change the show from ""Flipping Out"" since he hasn't flipped anything for a couple of years."
,whmxtra,2012-03-18T01:12Z,"Will see what I can do, meantime having a hard time finding more eps of this show and real housewives"
,Wellsj,2012-03-19T11:07Z,Cheers mate
,IGOTNOTHUMBZ,2012-03-20T00:08Z,I guess this show isn't a HOT upload =( My fiance is so sad...
,whmxtra,2012-03-21T00:05Z,"Haven't given up yet, but finding a decent and reliable source isn't easy"
,whmxtra,2012-03-29T06:50Z,"found episode 3, will upload it tomorrow"
,whmxtra,2012-03-30T09:58Z,"ok found 3, 4 and 5 so put them up here, but please ppl do your share of seeding. I'm seeding 3 files for this atm and I can only seed to a ratio of 5 as I'm on vacation so it's costing me literally $1/meg here."
