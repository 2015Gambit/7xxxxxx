,thunderbum,2012-03-06T22:06Z,Just thought of a request: would anyone have an audio book of Ameritopia? Seems every d/l and torrent I've found that's supposed to be Ameritopia has turned out to be fake.

Sorry to gatecrash your torrent, but if you're interested in Glenn Beck, someone has begun uploading his radio podcasts again on Demonoid after a long hiatus. If you seed well and give him/her a bit of encouragement, hopefully they'll start doing it regularly. I'm probably not allowed to post links, so just search for ""GB Radio"" on Demonoid and it should be the only result. Cheers."

look again for Ameritopia

,Annoyme,2012-03-07T03:40Z,"I'm just not a fan of Glenn, hayesy.

I suggest you download his torrent file from demonoid and upload it here for extra seed/peer support and a wider audience for his upload."
,tomc100,2012-03-08T08:23Z,Can someone upload Glenn Beck's podcast again.
