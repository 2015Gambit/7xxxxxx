Thanks!!"

Open utorrent or bittorrent and find a symbol at the top left that says ""add torrent from url"" click that and past the link location you copied from here. hope that helped"

Easier for them  Your connection is Extreamly slow (still on 128k) if you have to wait for upto 5 minutes for the files to show"
[T],immagical,2012-04-15T15:24Z,"@3rdAdam,    Thanks,, yep i noticed after 18:00pm till midnight i'm being throttled to hell by isp, and this is when it takes ages.  anytime b4 that time its seconds to connect.. But still my max speed for downloading is only between 429 to 530 kb/s.


the movie here is good..  Thanks to BONE. :)"
