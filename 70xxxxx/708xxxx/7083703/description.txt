Redemption Inc. Revisited s01e09

Six months have passed since the filming of Redemption Inc. The winner has started a new business, and the other participants have forged ahead with newly-acquired resources and skills. Kevin O'Leary and Brian O'Dea travel across the country to check in with Alia, Aaron and Ryan. Three of the ex cons have acquired new jobs. Two have gone into business together. It's unclear whether one participant can even be found - and another is on the brink of an extraordinary breakthrough. But it could go either way.
