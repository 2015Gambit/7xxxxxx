,zabr7mar,2012-06-06T16:27Z,keygen is not compatible with the windows version i am running. that's x64(64-bit) can anyone help with this or maybe provide a keycode that worked for you?
,gammaquarto,2012-09-03T14:08Z,"Keygen doesn't give a valid code for me.

Crack the executable yourself:- search for 83 C4 0C 8D 70 FF F7 DE 1B F6 46 EB 10 and change the EB 10 to 90 90."
,Shelleyan,2012-09-10T09:42Z,"@ gammaquarto which executable, plz explain more fully?

I enter the code from the keygen but the 'ok' button of the actgivate window remains greyed out . . 

Thanks"
,glubao,2012-09-25T19:19Z,"thank you so much @gammaquarto, how do you figure out which is the hex to change??

@Shelleyan : he's talking about using a hex editor, such as hxd, to change the program code... you can easily find that online"
