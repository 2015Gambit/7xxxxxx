Jokes :D.

First thing, always always always have a torrent picture. Bayimg is your friend and is really not that hard to use.

Second, when first uploading, people don't know who you are, and you will get less leechers. Reputation comes in time.

Keep it up with making the FOLDER the torrent and not a rar file. People hate rar files, just stay away from rar files.

Pro tip with piece size: Small piece size, always better than large/larger piece size. Smaller, means more people start sharing sooner.

If you using Utorrent, 16kb up until 1gb... Yes, little is amazing.

Welcome though, I hope to see you upload more. Don't be afraid to share strange stuff, this is TPB, people come here to escape normal man. I often upload Trap, futa and loli.

motto of TPB: Fuck da police!"
,anime.me,2012-03-09T22:44Z,"Thanks man, having trouble right now though, utorrent is saying my tpb tracker isn't working.
Lolz, ima never rar anything, its annoying and look suspicious.
Going to upload more content, in multiple fields. Idk why I started with porn -_- 
I'm glad to see my torrent was noticed, thought it would take longer.
Anyways, Thanks! Hope you like the content!
Btw... 31 seeders already? Gonna have to upload doujinshi when I get home:)"
,anime.me,2012-03-09T22:49Z,Also tell me of any other danbooru based sights you know!
,anime.me,2012-03-09T22:56Z,"By the way, I'll take requests for stuff. The acceptable subjects are: metal, anime, techno,  pic collections,hentai movies, programs, such and such, but only stuff I approve of ;P"
,Doomext,2012-03-11T04:31Z,"Trackers are old news. With Utorrent, you have DHT, which enables trackerless torrents.

You know what trackers I use on my torrents? None. Not a single tracker. I find people through DHT.

Sites are: Danbooru, Gelbooru, Fakku and L.U.S.C.I.O.U.S.

However, I found it very difficult to determine whether I had already uploaded a picture from Gelbooru, so I just stopped uploading pictures."
,anime.me,2012-03-12T00:24Z,"I'm trying to post my doujinshi and my flash games, but it won't let me:/ and idk what dht is... sorry, I prefer the old torrent system, not these magnet links "

,ltshwa,2012-03-29T22:14Z,"Guro? Like, how extreme are we talking here?"
