Marie is going to a St. Patrick's Day party since her boyfriend is working and doesn't drink. When her beau's son, Johnny, finds out, he comments on the fact that she's wearing too skimpy of an outfit, and that it's not even green. Marie doesn't just tell Johnny she's wearing green panties, she shows him. Johnny ends up kissing more than the Blarney Stone on St. Paddy's Day, and finds gold at the end of the rainbow. Talk about the luck o' the Irish. Slainte
