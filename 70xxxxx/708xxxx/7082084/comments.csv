Subtitles aren't very good though, the people who made them obviously misheared a lot of the lines. 

Thanks for the great upload though ^^"
,LethalRabbit,2012-03-24T23:41Z,"Posted my previous post when I was half way through the movie. The further I watch it, the more nonsense the subtitles are. Do yourself a favour and turn them off first, you'll understand the movie better without them ;)"

Please upload a better 1080p print and DTS 5.1.
Always love your work. This is not up to your usual standards. 

Cheers"
