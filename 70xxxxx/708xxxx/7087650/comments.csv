,Xpatriated,2012-03-08T22:47Z,"The first 2 volumes can be found here:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5110353/Supernatural_%28TV_Prequels%29

and the 3rd volume can be found here, if it still has any seeds:  
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5647917/Supernatural_-_Beginning_s_End_(TV_Tie-In)

If it doesn't, leave a comment.  I'll do a 4-pack (origins, rising son, beginning's end, caledonia) so that you all can have some prequel fun.  But make sure to stack if you already have this one.  I don't like wasting seed time on people replicating files.  (Stacking:  Downloading torrents with shard files to the same directory so that no duplicates occur.)"
