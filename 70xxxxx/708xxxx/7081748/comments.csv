DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS!!!! Here, or anywhere!

Yes, SILENCE, IS COMPLICITY, HOWEVER...

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER DIRECT ATTENTION TO, AT, TOWARD... THE DENIALISTS. It is what they live for. It is what they live ON, like leaches live on blood. They have no more interest in getting to the Truth than Hitler's propagandist Goebbels did.

If you ever comment BECAUSE of something they've said,
AND YOU SHOULD, YOU MUST, do it for the ONLOOKERS, those that are confused, misinformed, or uninformed.

SILENCE IS COMPLICITY!!!! Criminal!

However, DIRECTING ATTENTION (RESPECT) TO A DENIER,
IS CRIMINAL STUPIDITY. 1. Bleeds your time and energy; 2. Feeds the Animals; 3. CONFUSES THE ONLOOKERS - THEY TAKE IT AS A SHOW OF RESPECT TO THE DENIALISTS!

DON'T DO IT. "
