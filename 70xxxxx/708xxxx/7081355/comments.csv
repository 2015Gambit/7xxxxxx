To preserve a good resolution quality of the movie I prefer not to shrink it alot

I minimize the original format to the optimum best resolution can be 

And congratulations for uploading  your own torrents :) glad that I helped :D

WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED IF YOU REPLY
,nexuswolf,2012-03-12T10:43Z,"@ZedBoi
Don't Burn It On A Disc..
If You HAve A LG 3DTV, U must have got an 8 GB USB Flash Drive Free with It
Copy The Movie On The Flash Drive, Then Plug N Play The Movie!!

@DrKey
I Hope You Don't Mind That I answered The Question!! :-P"

anyway of maing it one screen?"
,ausielove,2012-04-02T09:04Z,"hi booger,

3d movies will show two screens untill you activate 3d on your remote.. we have the samsung  3d tv and it will ask you to select how you want the movie to display the moment you select 3d to start on tv.. there is a option to make two screens one screen..our tv show an icon with two people next to each other.. if you select that then it becomes one 3d screen thats perfect 3d!! better to put movie on usb or external drive to play"
,booger36901,2012-04-08T15:12Z,"@aussielove i do put it on a external hardive and plug it into my 3 tv, i do have the 3D button on my remote but i havent seen the optaion to change it to one screen is there another button i have to press?"
