I Love The '70s is a television mini-series produced by the BBC that examines the pop culture of the 1970s. It was broadcast in ten hour-long episodes (ed. Marley segment featured only here), one dedicated to each year, with the first episode, I Love 1970, premiering on BBC Two on 22 July 2000, and the last, I Love 1979, premiering on 23 September 2000. The series proved successful and thus was followed by two similar series, I Love The '80s and I Love The '90s, both of which aired during 2001.

Sweet little take on Bob. Not the least bring up their ideas about & memories of the days that were in London whereabouts such as Clapham, Hackney, the East End and even upper-class Hampstead. Memories ranging from Bob's early sightings at The Speakeasy Club to the grandeur of a packed Lyceum. Not all are fully correct regarding dates and venues, so you'll have to be easy on them for that.
