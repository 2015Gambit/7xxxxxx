,atishay58,2012-03-09T20:05Z,"Why can't I download any torrent files now???
It is everytime saying ""ugrade your torrent client"", what I already done 10 times...."
,BruinBear,2012-03-09T23:22Z,"By ""upgrade"" they mean they want to force you to use Utorrent instead of the client you are using now."

,we_r_nd,2012-03-10T03:42Z,"THANK YOU ETTV!!

eztv, TvTeam, VTV and others dependables are all going to the annoying mkv or mp4!!!! I say stick to the 175 / 220 / 350 mb AVI format for tv shows, it plays on everything!!

KEEP THE AVI UP LOADS COMING!!! "
