[V],bestec1234,2012-03-09T18:45Z,"Thanks... it really is good to know that people appreciate it.  It sorta makes it all worthwhile.

Before I started uploading, I downloaded for a few years.  I used to hate it when people would post torrents with no previews, because of the hassle of downloading part of the torrent to see if I liked it, and then feeling bad about not seeding the torrent because I only downloaded part of it.  So I try in my own torrents to include a cover image.   LSG and figurebaby make their own covers and it's good to use those.  I also like to put up a handful of representative samples from the set if it's practical -- one that shows each part of the woman's body.  I don't do that for some of my topless-only sets like the nadine-j.de stuff - the cover image of the woman's face and breasts is pretty much all you get on the set, so there's not much point in posting lots of additional previews, especially since their sets are usually only 60 pictures.

Damn.  I'm rambling.  :)

Anyway, you're welcome.  Glad to hear that people are enjoying them.  Comments are always welcome -- even if they're negative.  The only comments I don't appreciate are spam and personal attacks. 

I also welcome requests and suggestions.  Sometimes I'll post just some of what I have of something, just to see if anyone comments.  If no one does, I move on.  I posted the ""curry in a hurry"" video -- I haven't gotten any comments on it, so I didn't post the half dozen or so additional scenes that I have.  But, yeah -- the comments that say ""Do you have any more of this model?"" are always fun to see. 

I don't get as many comments as I'd like to, and I actually haven't said anything about it until now.  It's not that I need a pat on the back or anything -- it's more that seeing people comment on it is fun.  It's interesting to hear what people have to say about certain models.  I posted the model with facial hair on her chin thinking it would spark a debate -- nothing. :)

Gosh ... I really rambled.  If you read this far, thanks. :)"
