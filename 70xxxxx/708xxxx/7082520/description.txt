"Doctor Emmet Cole"

The Magus crew continue their trek to the 
Sahte Falls where they discover Emmet's 
camera bag. Upon further examination of 
the tapes within it, they find some 
powerful footage of Emmet that shows him 
spiraling out of control, and it leads 
the crew further into the Amazon. 
Meanwhile, Lena reveals a secret she's 
been carrying to a fellow crew member.
