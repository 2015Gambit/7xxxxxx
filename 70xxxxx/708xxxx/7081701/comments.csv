This movie is one of the absolute best surprises out there right now! 

Like old-school ""Slapshot"" times fifty...LMFAO funny (like sides hurting funny) but really a good warm-hearted film too. 

I've been using piratebay for ages and just finished watching Goon, got back on here and actually finally registered so that I could comment and let people know what a great movie this is.

Thanks again extremezone. You absolutely made my night with this one!  "
