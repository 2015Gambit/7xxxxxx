,Templar84,2012-03-07T13:06Z,"sorry for the double-post, for some reason it showed as removed so i reposted.."
,Buck3t,2012-03-07T15:08Z,Looking for a money trainer too
,frankinou,2012-03-07T16:29Z,"work good , no trojan detect ^^ thanks"
,MLO89,2012-03-07T21:06Z,"Problem with this trainer is the upgrade points are only there while the trainer is running. If you start the game back up without the trainer, all upgrade points it gave you are gone."
,dobber31,2012-03-07T23:42Z,anyone got link to money trainer?
,opaleg,2012-03-08T01:31Z,"Make sure to put the universe in a safe when you are finished with the trainer.

,Seancpconn,2012-03-08T11:15Z,"Anyone looking for a money trainer, just use cheat engine. Google it. Run ME3, then alt + tab it, run cheat engine, and load up the process, which can be done on the top left. 

After you have that loaded, in the value box on the right, enter the amount of money you have and then hit new search. It should come up, use the red arrow to drop it down into the bottom box where you can right click on the value and change it to what you want.

Sometimes it takes a few searches, so search for the first number, buy something alt+tab it again and just enter the new number and hit next search. "
,Seancpconn,2012-03-08T11:16Z,"Aside from change the money value, you can change any numeric value in the game including skill points, etc"
,godziothc,2012-03-09T21:07Z,dang... no option to add paragon/renegade points
,ziibrok,2012-03-10T06:16Z,"Yeah, paragon/renegade points option would be really helpful. Even the latest +9 trainer by 'FLING' doesn't have this option."
,Ximmortal,2012-03-10T12:35Z,http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7091548 heres a trainer that gives infinite credits 
,Pwntatochips,2012-03-11T04:54Z,"Am I supposed to activate this every time I launch Mass Effect 3? Because I used the Infinite Upgrade Points, saved, exit the game and trainer. Came back and the points were available but the skills weren't saved. Is it a bug? Or is the trainer always supposed to open to have it saved?"
,peterwan,2012-03-13T22:33Z,"i think INFINITE HEALTH is enough:)
