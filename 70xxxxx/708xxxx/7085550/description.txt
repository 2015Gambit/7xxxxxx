synopsis
---------
1.18 "Gary" John Delaney Scott Sonneborn
story by: Todd Garfield and Jeremy Corray February 29, 2012 (2012-02-29) 

Maahox develops a gremlin-like holographic pet, which he sends to attack the Castle of Lions through Pidge's videogame. When Vince finishes the game, beating the final boss, he downloads his prize--Maahox's pet and names him "Gary". 
However, the seemingly harmless cute creature soon causes chaos for the force by multiplying itself in order to destroy the castle's defenses. After being captured by Hunk's space mouse trap device, Gary escapes and grows into a monstrous version of itself as it attacks the Voltron Nexus. Pidge finds a way to defeat Gary by re-rigging the mouse trap to make what he calls a "Gary Bomb" so the space mice can carry it inside the creature, but in the end, the damage to Voltron's inner workings has caused major damage.
