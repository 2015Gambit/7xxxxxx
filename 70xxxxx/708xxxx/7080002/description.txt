  RE:  No More XviD releases


Dear Retards,

Yes, MP4 is a more flexible format, and may be superior to AVI, but they don't play on DivX DVD players. What inbred halfwit decided it had to be MP4 **INSTEAD** of XviD, uncle-dad?  

Oh, and thanks for dropping XviD right in the middle of the US network broadcast season.  That was also very well thought out, morons.

Sincerely,

A Former Fan



If you are reading this, you are probably looking for xvids of your favorite shows too.  Well, here is one.  Try to seed until at least 2-5 others have a complete copy, and may hardly miss FQM, VTV at all.

This is a replacement for one posted earlier today.  It was fine for computers, but lower end DivX DVDs might not play the audio.  I forgot to change the audio encoder, sorry.
