Details:
The Rum Diary is Christopher Young having fun; he's back in his comfort zone, coming up with crazily creative cue titles, slipping in names of favorite composers, jamming with his friends and returning his roots. People forget that Young was a jazz drummer at North Texas State University before he became a composer, and was hugely influenced by the large jazz bands of the 50s and 60s throughout his youth. Young himself says that "most of the tracks on the CD were presented as thematic possibilities for the film" and that the film "gave me a chance to pour out music that has been inside of me all these years."
Fans of smooth jazz, especially that written by aforementioned composers like Mancini, Hefti and Baxter, might find The Rum Diary something of a curio, and those who cannot tolerate non-orchestral scores or anything with a sly sense of humor or an unorthodox instrumental complement will not have a clue what's going on. Personally, I found The Rum Diary to be a superbly eclectic, creative and original score that shows a totally different - and much welcome - side of Christopher Young's musical personality. It's one of the best comedy scores of the year.
