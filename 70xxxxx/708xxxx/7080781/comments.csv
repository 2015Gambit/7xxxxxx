Learn to read, the source is HDTV, the description says the resolution is 704x400 which is good enough for a pc monitor @ 2048x1080 to view without pixelating.

Its not omg perfect everything, ofc there is blending its a 1gb avi for a 1h30m show, you want HD? Go find a 4gb torrent.

Thanks to the uploader. Will seed."
