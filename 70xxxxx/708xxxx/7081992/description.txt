This is the .yelo (Open Sauce-ONLY) version of A50, "The Truth and Reconciliation", from the first release of CMT's SPv3 mod.

Special note: if you're getting low FPS while using Open Sauce (regardless of version), the manual has a section with tips on how to get better performance. Here's a short version if you are lazy:

-Disable motion blur (CMT extras or pp_motion_blur_enabled false in console)
-Disable FXAA (CMT extras or pp_fxaa_enabled false in console)
-Disable all postprocessing (pp_unloade in console)
-Decrease texture quality (video settings menu)
-Decrease screen resolution (video settings menu)

There are two different maps you can download - which one you want depends on whether or not you plan on installing Open Sauce.

The .map can be played with or without Open Sauce, but is missing several secondary visual and gameplay features that rely on OS scripting and memory boosts.

The .yelo (this version) can only be played with Open Sauce, but contains the complete experience. Specifically, it includes:

-Full-resolution textures
-Battle Rifle singleshot/burst shot toggling
-VISR mode
-Features in pause menu for changing Open Sauce-related settings
-Assorted easter eggs

If you have any questions or issues (or want to see this information more in-depth), make sure you read the included CMT Manual first!

For the .yelo version, you must have the latest version of Open Sauce installed (if you don't, get it from its Google Code Page: http://code.google.com/p/open-sauce .) We highly recommend you install OS (and you need it for this version!) - the process incredibly simple and non-intrusive, and the benefits are immense. The only requirement is that you update a properly installed copy of Halo Custom Edition to 1.09 and do not use XFire while you are playing the game (seriously, even having the XFire process running can make Open Sauce crash, so make sure that youΓÇÖve completely ended the program's process!)
