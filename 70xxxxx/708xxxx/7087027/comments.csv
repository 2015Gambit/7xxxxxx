>> why in the porn section?
So your average retard can't find it.

>> why 2006?
Because that's the version that was stolen. If you have a newer version to offer, please do.

>> why are so many people seeding/leeching
Why are you commenting?

It is exactly what it is described as."

,mnshetm1991,2012-03-11T09:41Z,"if this is the 2006 version why should people even bother downloading it, i mean it is verry old or does it still work perfectly in 2012? and if this torrent is droped by anonymous, i bed the FBI is on it so isn't it a bit risky to download it? if i am just talking bull shit just say so becouse i am not so great with torrents and stuff."

,tocalili,2012-03-12T01:27Z,@Vatrahas I completely agree with you. To those who don't care about programming there's no point in downloading it.

,cheeser180,2012-03-13T04:02Z,I got some false positives from M$ Security Essentials. Other than that if you're on Windows use 7-zip to extract the tar.gz. This will produce a .tar file. Use 7-zip again on the .tar file to extract the Norton folders. Thanks for uploading/seeding people.
