I recommend you read this, it seems it's only good for Canada . 

it seems long distance do have to pay rates on it."
,ManinBlue,2012-03-07T20:18Z,"yes darkdragontc.. i forgot to mention that fact.
long distance IS NOT free, and the voip that they offer requires a fee also.

but if u are in canada and are looking for free local calling this is a great idea."
,vonwisdom,2012-03-07T20:53Z,Its free why would I need a torrent?
,ManinBlue,2012-03-07T21:23Z,just cause if i didnt upload it... would u have known about it?
