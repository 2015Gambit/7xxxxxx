Strange considering the book is 5-1/2 weeks old and a #1 bestseller."

,boarding_pirate546,2012-08-23T02:58Z,"Just finished this incredible audiobook.  A quote from the book I felt I had to write down: ""The federal government has become the nation's largest creditor, debtor, lender, employer, consumer, contractor, granter, property owner, tenant, insurer, health care provider, and pension guarantor.""

Great torrent and great book, thanks Annoyme!"
