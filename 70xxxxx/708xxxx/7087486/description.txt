The Uninvited centers around two teenage sisters Anna and Alex Rydell (Emily Browning and Arielle Kebbel) who return home from a mental hospital only to find their recovery unraveling because of a cruel stepmother, an ignorant father and a lingering, scary ghost. With their mental states deteriorating can they stay alive in a haunted house where the only thing they have is each other? The Uninvited is based on Kim Jee-Woon's 2003 Korean horror film Janghwa Hongryeon which in turn is founded on a classic Korean folk tale.
