This is a rip of the DVD uploaded by skyaddicted (The Green Beautiful DVD ISO La Belle Verte). Quality of the video is not great, but practically as good as the source DVD. There are a few versions of this movie out there, but all of them seem to have a problem with ratio. I tried to fix that in this version.

Description (thanks to binary1024)
La Belle Verte is written and directed by Coline Serreau, a woman film maker from France. Her film is probably the only French film of recent times that talks of nature, environment and importance of greenery in our daily existence. In La Belle Verte, we see how an alien lady (played by Coline Serreau herself) from a green planet (La Belle Verte - the Beautiful Green) descend on French capital Paris in order to gather information about the status of greenery on Earth. What follows is absolutely shocking for this alien as she learns that earth's inhabitants have almost no respect for nature,greenery and environment. Apart from its pro nature stance, La Belle Verte is also a searing attack on consumerist society where modern human beings have no idea of nature's power. This forces them to eat meat, and listen to music which is nothing but rubbish.

A rare, funny and interesting movie which supposingly was banned in the USA and EU. So I guess there must be something to learn.
