,mrnexus,2012-03-09T14:59Z,"Thanks boobsman,The only problem i have is that my console is just flashed its not jtag or RGH can you direct me to a tutorial on how i can do the RGH on my console any help would be greatly thanked,as always thanks very much for the mass effect3 game upload and this dlc,IVE had to buy this DLC but a heads up for everyone the prothean is the most powerful and important player in the game apart from shepard I have heard and the laser gun he use's that you get in the game is brilliant,so this is very important to have in the game from the start,This should have been in the normal copy as well as the CE,but we have the good old boobsman to sort us out :):)."

,JFrost22,2012-03-10T04:02Z,Jtag hasn't died yet. This is a waste of space. No offense boobsman I like your ups except this one.
[V],boobsman,2012-03-10T10:02Z,"@ JFrost22 just because you cant use it or don't want it doesn't make it a waste of space, many people do want it which make it a worthwhile upload:)"

,strider4ever245,2012-03-11T02:08Z,I keep getting disc read error on my rgh console.. always when I start the from ashes mission it boots me out of the game. Any thoughts?
,strider4ever245,2012-03-11T12:05Z,"nvm, got it working, excellent ul :)"
,foxfarts,2012-03-11T22:04Z,"@MrNexus If you register at the tx forums, darkfib3r has an excellent guide to doing it. I recommend getting or building a nand reader. Or you can look for the install jpegs for any other glitch chip and his guide will generally still apply. Also, if you decide to get a tx coolrunner you can use their jrunner app and it is all self contained and you can use the pdf that comes with the app as a guide."
,foxfarts,2012-03-12T23:06Z,Also heavenly modz has a start to finish RGH guide
,sarahjtag,2012-03-13T12:14Z,"Hi guys. Just to confirm as I can't get this DLC working. I have my games in HDD:/games/ so for example ME3 is HDD:/Games/56094
With that in mind where exactly put this file?.
Sorry for the noob question and any help very much appreciated "
,Stroke265,2012-03-14T09:39Z,"hey i have an answer and hope someone can help me. I´ve copied the folder 4541095D into the content/0000000000000000 of my hdd with xex menu. The content from the ashes and the other file appear if i search (trough the nxe not xex menu) in my content settings, memory, hdd, mass effect 3 game folder and doesn´t appear the corrupted which may appear if is installed on an invalid route. So it is copied succsessfully right? But when i go to play mass effect 3 and load a savegame doesn´t appear any new mission on the galaxy map, neither new armor or gun. I don´t know what is wrong. I´ve installed extra content before even mods wich go in the same folder if i remember right. Or maybe i must do something in order to activate the content? Do i have to start a new game?
Thanks for the help that could provide me"
,Stroke265,2012-03-14T10:18Z,"@Sarahjtag Regardless if you have you extracted iso in HDD:/Games/56094, the extra content like those dlc goes in the content/0000000000000000/4541095D/00000002 and the  content/0000000000000000/4541095D/00009000 is for the avatar items. 4541095D in this case is the name of the game (mass effect 3) in hexadecimal value. So just do as the description says. Copy the folder 4541095D in the hdd:content/0000000000000000 and it must work fine because that folder contains the other two folders and the files in their corresponding folder"
,Stroke265,2012-03-14T10:28Z,"@sarahjtag Regardless if you have your extracted iso in HDD:/Games/56094 the extra content as this dlc go in the hdd:Content/0000000000000000/4541095D/00000002 and hdd:Content/0000000000000000/4541095D/00009000 for avatar items. 4541095D is the hexadecimal value for mass effect 3 name.
 So just do as the instructions says: copy the folder 4541095D in your hdd:/Content/0000000000000000 folder (overwrite if it ask you so) and it must work. That folder contains the 00000002, 00009000 folders and the files in the corresponding folder."
,Stroke265,2012-03-14T11:34Z,"I´ve already realized what was happening. The content was locked, but i just downloaded the xm360 and unlocked it. Thanks for the upload boobsman.
