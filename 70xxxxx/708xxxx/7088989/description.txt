Mass Effect 3 Collectors Edition DLC JTAG-XPG

REQUIRES JTAG OR RGH MODDED CONSOLE!!!

An ancient alien race, known only as Reapers, has launched an all out invasion leaving nothing 
but a trail of destruction in their wake. Earth has been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of 
total annihilation, and you are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is 
extinction. You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can forge in your own image. You 
determine how events will play out, which planets to explore, and whom to form alliances with 
as you rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat once and for all. 

How you wage this war is completely up to you: go into combat with guns blazing or use cover to 
plan a more tactical assault. Utilize your squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain 
death from a distance or go toe to toe with enemies using devastating melee attacks. Mass Effect 3 
will react to each decision you make as you play through a truly unique experience of your own creation. 
The war for Earth has begun and you decide how it ends.
