Enjoy guys and help seed,thank you.






1) Battlefront Columbia:

The first episode deals with counterfeit money from Latin America — the country that is known for making the most fake currency is Colombia. The Secret Service counterfeit team is involved in tracking down those responsible for falsifying American currency. Surprisingly, the amount of fake U.S. money that is printed each year is more than $25 million. In this episode, the viewer is able to join the Secret Service on a manhunt to track down these criminals.



2) Frontline New York City:

The next episode follows agents in New York City as they track down criminals who try to get money through an electronic device. The viewer gets to see actual sting operations take place and feel the satisfaction of a thief getting caught with his “hand in the cookie jar.” As a voice-over says, ""The counterfeit team must be ready for anything.”



3) Undercover Miami:

Next, the viewer is taken to Miami and gets to listen to an interview of a Secret Service officer who goes undercover in the electronics section of Target. The counterfeit team follows the trail of money and successfully arrests the culprit by using a range of impressive security devices, such as laptop cameras and high tech ear microphones.



4) United Nations Lockdown:

The last episode follows the Secret Service as it protects foreign dignitaries at the General Assembly meeting at the United Nations. Due to the amount of work it takes to protect 131 dignitaries, more than 6,000 law enforcement officers are involved in the process. Because it is in New York, the United Nations is a difficult place to protect, with several vulnerabilities that can be penetrated by criminals. The Secret Service takes any threat seriously and prepares for this event for several weeks. The viewer gets to watch as the leaders of Iran and Pakistan arrive in America and the things that have to be done to ensure their safety."
