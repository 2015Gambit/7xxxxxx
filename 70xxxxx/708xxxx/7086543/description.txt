Jorge Cortell - Intellectual Property Xvid MP3

In this lecture given by Jorge Cortell to the Norwegian UNIX Users Group (NUUG) on the 17th of November, 2005, Mr. Cortell discusses the idea of intellectual property and how - at it's core - it is simultaneously absurd, prohibitive to human progress, socially suicidal and probably just another corporate grab for money and power. Closer to home, Cortell portrays file sharing as more akin to marketing than stealing, and he backs this assertion up by showing that sales for "intellectual property" have actually risen since the rise of P2P.

Jorge Cortell-Albert taught Intellectual Property Law and eCommerce for the Multimedia Internet Applications Masters Degree at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain) before he was fired due to pressure from corporate media interests. Jorge is also an active lecturer and researcher focusing on the interplay of business, technology, and intellectual property law, and the impact that interplay has on consumers and politics.
