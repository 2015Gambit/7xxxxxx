i was hesitant in regards to my posting of this book. In fact, I still don't like the idea of posting it, personally. the majority of people will just judge it without reading it and thats fine. instead, i will look forward to all the moronic comments that are sure to follow (mainly from zakimar) but i'll explain my reasons below.

Review is as follows:

Islam and violence appear to dominate global politics in the twenty-first century. This book examines dimensions of Islam and violence as part of wider debates about politics, history, faith, power, rebellion and struggle both within Muslims' realms and outside it. The author accounts for definitions of violence and terrorism with both historical and contemporary dimension. The book explores the motif of violence in its myriad aspects including debates about sacrifice, private and public violence, responses and reactions, as well as suicide and martyrdom.
