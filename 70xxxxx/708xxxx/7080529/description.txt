George Kinney, of the late, great, Texas Psychedelic rock group ΓÇô the Golden Dawn, was diagnosed with liver cancer in 2011. Luckily, the disease responded to treatment and Mr. Kinney received a liver transplant around Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, Mr. Kinney still needs expensive treatments and medications to survive. The George Kinney Medical Fund has been created to help with these expenses.

We are asking all fans to contribute $5 per downloaded title above directly to the George Kinney Medical Fund.

You can Paypal the George Kinney Medical Fund at: kinney777@gmail.com

or make checks out to GEORGE KINNEY MEDICAL FUND and mail them to: George Kinney, PO Box 51, Cedar Creek, TX 78612 United States

We would like to appeal to all fans of the Golden Dawn, Texas Psych, psychedelic music and the arts in general to make a donation to this fund. George has made some really beautiful music over the years and heΓÇÖs a really cool guy; heΓÇÖs one of us.
