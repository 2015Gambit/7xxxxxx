,muLineZu,2012-03-07T00:10Z,"You used to encode better before this PS3 bullshit... You rip a blu-ray's DTS 5.1 to AC3 2ch? Get real! If the PS3 users want more than to play on their console, they should buy a PC. What's next? Join the BD to CD size rippers army? Too bad..."

Get your facts straight.  The PS3 has a wide range of native file formats that include multichannel surround, and using external server PS3 Media Server, I can watch full bluray remuxes with DTS audio passed thru as Linear PCM 2.0.

If the uploader chooses to change a ripping style, go find another if it pisses you off that much.  I think there are enough uploaders out there that there is really no need for you to be a complete butt nugget floating in a bag of douche runoff."

it is grainy, I cant really say its a 720p, but did you really expect 2.06gig to be enough for a full length 720?"
