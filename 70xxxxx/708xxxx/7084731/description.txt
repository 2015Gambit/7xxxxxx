This is an original mint condition Nautilus DBX II encoded LP
 decoded with a dbx 244 decoder. No de-clicking was required.
 The dbx Type-II system reduced the audibility of dust and scratches, reducing them to  tiny pops and clicks (if they were audible at all) and also completely eliminated record surface noise.
 dbx encoded LPs had, in theory, a dynamic range of up to 120db. In addition, dbx LPs were produced from only the original master tapes, with no copies being used,
 and pressed only on heavy, virgin vinyl.
