Documentary which goes inside the secretive Traveller world - a world of long and bitter memories 
Filmed over twelve years, the film chronicles a history of violent feuding between rival families
using remarkable access to document the bare-fist fights between the Quinn McDonaghs and the Joyce 
clans, who, though cousins, have clashed for generations. Vivid, violent and funny, the film explores 
the need for revenge and the pressure to fight for the honour of your family name.
