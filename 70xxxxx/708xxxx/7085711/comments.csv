,jagr_200,2012-03-08T03:26Z,The torrents with .rar files suck. Just use .avi or another format. I don't wanna deal with converting and dealing with all the files.
,ReliableMike,2012-03-08T09:09Z,"Holy shit jagr could you possibly be any more lazy/spoiled?  Nobody cares what you don't want to deal with you're an anonymous internet geek who can't even spend 2 minutes to convert something you're getting for FREE.

Here's a tip.  Just extract the damn thing and then go back to the torrent and choose - remove and -> delete .torrent and data.  Simple as that.  Moron.
