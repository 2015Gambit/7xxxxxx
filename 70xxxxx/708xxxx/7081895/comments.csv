Funny how that the left has never criticized George Soros who bankrolls the left, and wants to replace American sovereignty with international bureaucrats .

Maybe if George Soros actually manufactured things or employed Americans, he could be as rich as the Koch brothers, instead he bankrupts third world currencies and people.

Be proud of the biggest single lefty billionaire. Scumbag that he is."
