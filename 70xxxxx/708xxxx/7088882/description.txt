ABOUT THE SHOW
Battleground is a documentary-style drama series created by JD Walsh that chronicles the inner workings of a Democratic Party primary campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin. Led by campaign manager Chris "Tak" Davis, the team battles against corrupt politicians and staff infighting while campaigning for a distant third-place candidate. The show marks hulu's first foray into original scripted programming.
