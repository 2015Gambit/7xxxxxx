,strathmeyer,2012-03-09T03:25Z,"Sounds like a problem with your client, Diablo, not TPB"
,strathmeyer,2012-03-09T03:26Z,Not to mention that TPB lists which files are in a torrent???
,Sailingmaster,2012-03-09T04:53Z,I'm getting sick of these low weight files that look like stop motion photography on anything larger than an iPhone.
,prosebeforehoes,2012-03-09T07:55Z,"I can't find the download icon either, Diablo."
,evilg0d,2012-03-09T08:49Z,"Thank you VTV, I appreciate your work.
@ DiabloTheCritic & prosebeforehose; There is no ""Download"" link anymore, just the magnet. If you want to know what's in the file click on the number next to ""Files:"" at it will appear.
Oh, and DiabloTheDipshit; stop blaming your issues on others you pathetic fool. You are getting stuff for free yet you still feel the need to bitch about it. Grow up or stop commenting.
@Sailingmaster; If you don't like it why are you here complaining about it. Look for a HD versions or buy them. No one is forcing you to download these rips which are excellent quality for their file size."
,emanohose,2012-03-09T17:28Z,"VTV: Good work. Thank you.
Evilg0d: this number thing is brilliant. I also agree with you on your other comments."
,atishay58,2012-03-09T20:13Z,"(Problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client!)

Getting the above thing... Even after upgrading the torrent client, I am still getting the same....

Can anyone help me pleaseeeeee!!!!!!!!"
,MissuX,2012-03-10T00:51Z,"What about the video quality? This new video has only 230mb, it usually has 350mb..
Is it normal?

[I can't see files before download either.. i use uTorrent 3.1.2]"
,ROU-KillingTime,2012-03-10T12:10Z,"@MissuX The Xvid releases were 350mb, the new x264 releases are smaller, while having the same or better quality thanks to the more advanced codec.

As for the magnet links, they just mean you are getting the .torrent file from the swarm rather than from the website. My client (Ktorrent 4.1.1) shows me the files once it has grabbed the .torrent from the swarm, so no problems here on that front."
