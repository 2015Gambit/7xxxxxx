,SC420,2012-03-09T21:32Z,"Hey .Leto It takes a jerk to know one JACKASS and I at least UPLOAD quality files here on TPB whereas all you do is LEECH and act like a whiny BITCH and you probably watch tv on a 30 year old square analog tv. 

Did it ever occur to you that lots of people prefer XviD over x264 files. Can you play a x264 file on a dvd player?  You can play XviD on Philips DVD players and other DVD players but they won't play x264 mkv files. 

My Panasonic BD-75 Blu Ray player plays mkv files flawlessly however on my Samsung 60 inch 3D LED LCD 8000 Series Smart TV model # UN60D8000YF

Now go away and STFU Jabroni............."
