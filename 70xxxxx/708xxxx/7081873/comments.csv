Mass Effect 3 LossLess Repack-Z10yded 

which is in fact 

Mass Effect 3 Multi7-RU Repack

?

Based on size 6.06 being same for all of them I suppose it is. Finally some good info on that Repack."

,Marcvss,2012-03-07T12:06Z,"Archive is either incomplete or damaged... Winrar 4.11 won't extract files.

Any ideas?"
,evilworm13,2012-03-07T12:07Z,Seems to be something wrong with the archive
,Marcvss,2012-03-07T13:01Z,"No nothing wrong with the archive. Just use 7-zip that will do the trick.

Just installed it and it runs great but I cant seem to find the extra content like the n7 wargear, extra casual outfit and the robot dog.

Uploader how do we unlock the extra content?"
,evilworm13,2012-03-07T13:31Z,My mistake. Unpacked the .001 file with 7-zip and no errors.
,ronan17,2012-03-08T17:50Z,"works fine, just remember to install from the .exe that you find outside the two disc folders"
