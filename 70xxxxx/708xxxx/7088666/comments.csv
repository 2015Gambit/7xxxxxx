,KHLuver,2012-05-20T14:10Z,When i play it will it be English or i have to equip the patch first?
,kurohyoneko,2012-05-29T03:09Z,"@KHLuver, I'm assuming we just have to play since there's only one file in the torrent."
,aracuscesasr,2012-06-03T21:38Z,"It worked perfect, i just finish the game today, and worked perfectly, almost 100% english (except something in 100acre wood and at the beginning with roxas's jobs, nothing important at all) no freezes, no glitches, excellent torrent"
,Idus15,2012-06-11T02:24Z,"just one thing i have seen sora's forms (valor, Wisdom, Limit, Master ect.) for some reason dont level up past level 2 or 3 in some cases (wisdom) not even level 1. i gave grinded the game with my forms and nothing on the status changes for the forms. if anyone knows why this is happening or how to fix it please let me know. other than this the game is 100% i love it thank you for the torrent :)"
,Zaptroxix,2012-06-13T19:08Z,"@Idus15 Valor and Wisdom are trained only against HEARTLESS, Master form are trained by the ammount of drive orbs you collect while in the form. Final Form can only be trained against NOBODYS. And Limit form is trained when you use the Limit Commands of the form. "
,JDAlicea,2012-06-24T22:45Z,"Just a quick question on the English ""Patch"" portion, I know in the original Final Mix, all original content cutscene wise is still in english and they give Japanese subtitles, but all text and new cutscenes are in japanese.

This English ""patch"" makes all text in game English AND gives English subtitles to all Japanese parts?"
,GBPP,2012-06-28T21:12Z,ran fine but crashed in the end cinematic for me. Not use if its the iso or just PCSX2. Anyone who it works for can you tell me which emulator and settings you're using?
,latino475,2012-07-04T06:40Z,ok so the game works almost perfect but 1 huge prob for me i cant see my health and on ATLANTICA i cant see the timers for the musicals can anyone tell me how to set up my video settings so i can see my health and timers pls.
,coldbread,2012-07-12T09:40Z,PAL or NTSC?
,micnor14,2012-08-01T06:07Z,"@Mrnimrod Anything is better than gibberish for a description. Is this PAL or NTSC? Any details on the physical file included? Like format? That's cool, once someone takes the time to DL and post some simple details, I can appreciate not wasting my bandwidth on what could be garbage. 

Cheers"
,kariasj,2012-08-10T00:09Z,So what is the requirements to play this on my ps2?
,haphet,2012-09-09T11:22Z,i has only the iso file is it really the real deal??
,haphet,2012-09-10T15:53Z,its was just a normal kh2 iso.. what a waste of time
