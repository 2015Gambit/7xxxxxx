[T],jmz619,2012-03-09T23:09Z,Wow very nice group great mix of electronic/hiphop/rap/rock IMO a 7/10 +1
,Flyingbox,2012-03-10T01:38Z,I'm not one for rap but damn... this isn't bad at all. Took me off guard with the slow progressive suddenly turning rap/electronic on the first track.
,mishkx,2012-03-10T01:56Z,"not a hip hop fan, but rebstar is definitely something special. GREAT ALBUM and it's FREE (legally speaking)! keep it coming"
,calvinkei,2012-03-10T02:08Z,REBSTARS NEXT UP!!!! HANDS DOWN ONE OF THE BEST HIPHOP ARTISTS IVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. GO HARD. FUCK LILWAYNE!
,w00tbie,2012-03-10T03:14Z,nice original soundfeel. listening now on your site. thanks for sharing it. and THANK YOU PROMOBAY!!!! XXXX
[V],HobbitGamez,2012-03-10T07:04Z,"I would have never payed for this. monotonous and the assonance is exaggerated so that it doesn't flow very well. props for sharing freely, though. 4/10"
,magooze,2012-03-10T20:25Z,"I think the first post were the artist(s) hyping this shit up. I love all music and they have a new cool style. Just need some professional help if they were to go big. I could see the kids these days liking it. Rappers/rockers when I was growing up were hardcore felons lol these guys are going to court for parking tickets lol. Anyways good music, I cant hate on you guys you are doing it and im all for it. Congrats and keep it up."
,soundchaser515,2012-03-10T23:55Z,"WOW. Being a musician, I found REBSTAR a fresh of breath air. Not n2 hiphop/rappity-heehaw, but this is a nicely produced, well written and outstandingly performed disk. They're gonna do well. This is the first I've heard of REBSTAR. And guys, remember where you are right now. You wont be there long. But REMEMBER.!!! thx"
,dxbx,2012-03-11T00:08Z,cant be mad at this..rebstar been doing collabos with stars like trey songs and drake and ray j..im glad to see he down2earth even tho he makes major moves. big ups. i'd pay for this 
,dxbx,2012-03-11T00:10Z,"rebstar is just 1 guy, kid from sweden - he has a video with trey songz (youtube 'rebstar without you trey songz) its rather old though but massive video"
,lattari,2012-03-11T17:40Z,I liked the song on your site and now downloading your album - thank you for sharing it! Congratulations for getting into Promobay also. I love the concept and what a kickoff with Coelho.
,enkamen,2012-03-12T16:34Z,"i signed up only to comment on this release.

first of all - thank you TPB for introducing a lot of new people to this great music. you guys have done a better job promoting and finding talent than these damn dinosaur record labels.

i'm proud to say that i'm now a fan of rebstar. he reminds me of a young kanye west. and let's not forget the production is INCREDIBLE

this should be considered among the top 10 hip hop releases the past 12 months...as soon as jay-z or drake starts to publicly promote rebstar you'll all agree. just wait and watch.

my rating: 8.5/10"
