Donald J. Trump has just five words for the politicians and so-called leaders in Washington, DC:
ItΓÇÖs Time to Get Tough

President Obama has been a disaster for America. In four short years, heΓÇÖs wrecked our economy, saddled our children with more debt than America managed to rack up in 225 years, and gone around the world apologizing for our countryΓÇöas if the greatest nation in the world needs to apologize for being a land of opportunity and freedom, which we were before Obama became president.

Now, America looks like a broken countryΓÇöstripped of jobs, stripped of wealth, stripped of respect. And what does President Obama do about it? He plays nice with a China that is doing everything it can to destroy our economy, while refusing to stand up for America with Middle Eastern oil mobsters who think they can hold us hostage through higher prices at the pump, and chucking billions in ΓÇ£stimulusΓÇ¥ money to his friends and supporters while letting the rest of us foot the bill.

This canΓÇÖt go on. And if Donald J. Trump has anything to say about it, it wonΓÇÖt.

In his new blockbuster book, Time to Get Tough, Trump has the answers America has been looking for, an agenda for making America number one again, including:


How to put OPEC out of business 

How to create American jobs by forcing Communist China into truly fair trade

How to retire our debt without endangering long-established programsΓÇölike Social Security, Medicare, and MedicaidΓÇöthat millions of Americans depend on

How to undo the fraud of Obamanomics and the disaster of Obamacare

Blunt, straightforward, and honest, itΓÇÖs all trademark Trump, setting out a common sense agenda to restore American prosperity and make our nation respected once again.
