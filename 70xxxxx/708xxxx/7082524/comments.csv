I wonder how the election would have turned out if Trump had decided to run for President!"

,Stanselm,2012-03-09T18:26Z,His casinos in Atlantic City had to declare bankruptcy due to mismanagement.  Hardly the successful businessman he makes himself out to be.

Coincidentally, I worked for an ad agency that had Trump Plaza as a client then.  I was the CFO and had to deal with some of the biggest schmucks on the planet.

I'd write more, but I get acid reflux just thinking about it . . .

Meanwhile, he's got his name on high end real estate around the world and is worth over a billion dollars.

Yeah, but there's that casino......"

Go blow smoke up someone else's ass, fucknuts.  C.F.O., my ass.  More like Chief Fucking DUMBASS."
