Bill Lloyd - Set to Pop 1994 

[B]Originally released in 1994, the self-definitive Set to Pop finds Bill Lloyd masterfully asserting his claim to the pop half of the country-pop duo Foster & Lloyd. This reissue (available for the first time in Canada through Denon) is an essential addition to the collection of any fan of melodic, unflashy, guitar-based power pop. Alongside the noble, ringing guitars of &"Forget About Us" and "Alright" enjoy the wiggly, quick-picked riff to Ray Davies' "This Is Where I Belong," the inherent humor of the AC/DC-meets-bluegrass intro to "In the Line of Fire," the pointed, John Hiatt-ish barb "The S.W.A.T. Team of Love," and the dramatic, bass drum-punched chorus of closer "Anything Less than Love." [/B]

Bill Lloyd - Back to Even 2004

 When you listen to Bill Lloyd's Back To Even album you ask yourself; :"who's this guy writing about, him or me?" It's that close and that good. The title track says he's traveled one end of the musical and emotional spectrum to the other and has survived to write one track after another that reaches into the head and heart. Listening to this album has you playing the old flower game of "she loves me-she loves me not" and then resolving it with the playful Kissed Your Sister. The overall sound is tight and Lloyd constantly finds that one little element that makes a song stick in your head. Hearing the crying pedal steel guitar of Rusty Young on Story I Can't Tell makes the song more than just a baleful ballad of love lost. This record is track after track of pop and circumstance. Chiming guitars, tight harmonies, not to mention little side trips back to the 60's and 70's that are the hallmarks of a Bill Lloyd musical expedition. When you've heard all the tracks you have to say, "Bill, we know a lot about each other." It also happens to be a great tribute to a very classy songwriter.
