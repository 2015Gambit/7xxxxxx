With all the style of Bogart and the comedy of Moonlighting, F. M. Bradley and Jack Baker take to the streets as private detectives in search of a killer in The Adventures of Dick Black, The Black Dick. Baker once again turns in a credible non-sexual performance as the thinking half of this duo, while Bradley does most of his talking through "Master Johnson." The result is a comical, sexy and well-made shot-on-video feature.
A murder in a well-to-do family's house sends our heroes off in search of clues and screws. While Baker probes for facts, Bradley probes his own way and really gets to the bottom of things. He "questions" the wife (Melba Cruz) while Baker talks to the husband (Herschel Savage), and then later corners the daughter (Jeanna Fine) who bares all to his masterful tongue and tool. Needless to say the killer is exposed, but not before we get to see plenty of steamy sex. Mike Horner's office fling with Tiffany Rose really takes off, and Rene Summers and Jane DeVille's double teaming of Savage gets the video off to a great start.
Plenty of production values here ΓÇö including highway scenes in the duo's '57 Chevy (hardly a classic, though), good choices of shots by director John T. Bone and a competent cast ΓÇö are evidence that Dreamland Home Video put some time and effort into making this tape. Their reward is a production that should rent and sell very well. (P.S. ΓÇö a sequel, The Adventures Of Dick Black; The Case Of The Tattooed Lady, is promised at the end).
