Meltdown on Mars is a stunning action base-defence title.
The player is the last survivor of the human colonists on Mars. They must strategically eliminate the relentless horde of aliens with guile and no mercy, earning cash to buy and install automated gun turrets, fortifying barricades, devastating mines and a variety of increasingly brutal weapons.
Remembering to use the base and terrain to their advantage, they can guide the aliens down a narrow passage or into corners making them easy to ambush and destroy. Or just go on a rampage!
But extinction is not an option!
Good luck soldier!
