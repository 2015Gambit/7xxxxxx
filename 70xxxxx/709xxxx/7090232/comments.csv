No way is passive 3D better than active. Lower frame rate and not true HD! Passive is inferior in every way except maybe cost."

Just one thing, your recent uploads cut off the top and bottom of the screen on my tv and can only be viewed full screen if I put the settings on zoom and then I lose the sides of the pic?
Can you or anyone else let me know what I need to do to fix it?
Cheers all"
