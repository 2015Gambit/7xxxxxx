It might be shortchanging this young German group's distinctive character, but
the [em] trio's current music has heir-to-EST written all over it, and not only
because they record for the same label that the late Esbj√∂rn Svensson did so
much to put on the map. But while the square-bracketed [em] (the letters declare
drummer Eric Schaefer and pianist Michael Wollny to be equal members of bassist
Eva Kruse's group) share Svensson's knack for rock-band intensity, jazz
spontaneity and classical precision, they do it all their own way. This live
album is the group's freest and yet most cohesive creation, shifting from funky,
chord-pounding pieces (fans of Neil Cowley might be kindred spirits here) to
lyrical piano reflections and hip uptempo swing. Sometimes Wollny spreads pools
of sound around Kruse's pure bowed hum, sometimes he fires spurts of staccato
melody and chord clangs over Schaefer's sweeping drums. It's an exciting set, as
the crowd reaction confirms.
