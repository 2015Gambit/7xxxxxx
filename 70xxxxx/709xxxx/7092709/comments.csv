Same issue they had with their 1.7.5.166 version, works once and only once, trying to restart the program later won't let you start it up

Looks like they rushed another crack out the door that doesn't work"
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-11T14:53Z,"@Valagard

You stupid asshead; you have to read the nfo and turn off internet to run it!
Futhermore its been tested by many people and they wan't any problem so shut the fuck up!

@miguelsz3
Thanks for the upload!"
,Valagard,2012-03-12T11:11Z,"@restrict

You bloody moron, it says nowhere in the info to turn off the internet, or block it, or anything like that in it. If you are going to spout shit, make sure you actually read it etc first"
,Valagard,2012-03-12T11:44Z,"Just tested blocking it with windows firewall, and yes, it does indeed work after"
,Zebz213,2012-03-12T16:38Z,"As stated by Valagard it does work as long as you block it through firewall. For anyone who doesn't know how I will tell you how.

How to Block with Firewall (Windows 7)

1. Open 'Control Panel'
2. Click 'System and Security'
3. Click 'Windows Firewall'
4. On the left panel click 'Advanced Settings'
5. On the left click 'Inbound Rules'
6. On the right click 'New Rule'
7. 
  a- Program
  b- Navigate to Bandicam install location and select bandicam.exe
  c- tick the 'Block Program' bubble
  d- tick all 4 boxes
  e- Name it (I used ""Bandicam"")

Then bandicam should work fine and not give the 'Invalid Program' error anymore. Hope this helps; Please seed after you download!"
,Valagard,2012-03-12T23:12Z,"I noticed that even with blocking the program, after some time the program fails to start recording video, but will still take screenshots

Reinstalling the program makes it work again, but only for a while before it starts failing again

Going back to 1.7.5 till a fully functional crack comes out for this"
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-12T23:47Z,"@Valagard

You have to read the nfo !

     [Extra info]

     When you try to run Bandicam and the following error shows: 
     ""This application is invalid. You need to reinstall the application"",
     then apply launch ""Bandicam RegFixer.exe"" and restore RegKeys."
,Valagard,2012-03-14T08:34Z,"@xRestrictx

Even if I run the registry fixer program after it refuses to run, Bandicam will start up, but it will refuse to take video, only screenshots

This is ultimately a bad crack, and this isn't the first time they have released a bandicam crack that worked for awhile, then failed in the end. 1.7.5 had this issue

I've gone back to MSI afterburner till they fix this, far higher quality anyways (But almost twice the HD writes)"
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-14T15:02Z,"@Valagard

Fcking gaylord, i works smootly and tested by many people, so go fuck youre big mommy!"

Fcking gylord, i works smootly and tested by many people, so go fck youre big mommy!"
,Zebz213,2012-03-14T19:25Z,Ok it ran fine since my last post but I turned my computer on this morning and it didn't work. I noticed yesterday it was asking to update but I declined the update. When I installed I used the Regfix and this morning I used the regfix after it stopped working. It still does not work. Hopefully they will put out a new crack that fully works and doesn't stop after some time.
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-14T21:02Z,"As i said earlier the crack works fine!
If you don't get t to work then you are doing something work.

This crack was tested by many people before release, and all succesfully tested.
So if it doesn't work it's not the fault of the crack!!!"
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-14T21:03Z,work= wrong*
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-16T11:00Z,"1) Clean install
2) Do not run app yet
3) replace with crack files
4) Run launcher and backup your registry key for x64
5) Run app, on 2nd launch you mite get the invalid error (i got it once).
6) Replace the registry key you backup with launcher and then run app again.

You should be fine now. If you get error again just replace with the backup registry key you saved using the launcher."
,ainax,2012-03-18T23:00Z,"Doesn't work : it ""bdcam.exe has stopped working"" when I start a recording
but when I take the original bdcap32.dll, it work fine (with Bandicam.com on the top of my videos...)"
,Valagard,2012-03-22T09:59Z,"I already told him this crack is flawed, he won't listen though

Even if restoring keys, it will run the program, but it won't capture video or take screenshots till like you said you restore the original file

Also the hacked bandicam file keeps hooking itself with Java client and other java files, in order to remove it for a clean install you have to reboot windows"
,guerillaboi,2012-03-26T03:00Z,"gj on the crack everything is working fine except im still getting the bandicam.com across the top of my vijeos, ive done the registry adn blocked the program any ideas?"
,brockso,2012-03-26T13:35Z,"Hey there, thanks for the crack, I enjoy it.
But on the downside, your crack doesn't work. It's like trying to wipe my asshole with sandpaper. You are a complete fuck and really need to work on your crack making abilities. Because this shit is so bad, I think that I may have to lite my cat on fire. Thanks for your time, I mean wasting my time, fuck tard. Oh and xrestrictx it doesn't work, it's a piece of crap, go to hell you donkey fucking asshole."
,guerillaboi,2012-03-26T14:02Z,"Update: Bandicam logo has dissapeared while recording LoL, seems to be working absolutely perfect now.. dunno what troubles deez people are having but there is nothing wrong with the crack just takes a bit of knowledge which to be honest if your on this site you should have.. 

NUBZ EVERYWHERE!!"
,guerillaboi,2012-03-26T14:03Z,I should make a tutorial with Bandicam to show these idiots how its done bahahahaha
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-26T15:54Z,"@guerillaboi

Good to hear it's working :)

And ofcourse the crack it fully working, but some noobs like brockso doenst know how it works xD"
,Valagard,2012-03-26T19:46Z,"*Install Bandicam*
*Block it from internet access*
*Back up registry keys*
*Start up Bandicam*
*It starts*
*Close bandicam*
*Restart it*
""There was an error, please reinstall the program""

No, your crack just fucking sucks. It works sometimes, not all of the time

We went through this same fucking shit with the 1.7.5 crack, it did -THE EXACT SAME THING AS THIS-, it would work a few times, then never the fuck again

And they went back and -FIXED IT-, they admitted the crack was fucked up, went back and fixed it

The final version of the 1.7.5 crack I didn't need to block with windows firewall, I didn't need to back up registry keys, I didn't need to do any of that shit, it just works period. The version that -DIDN'T WORK- you needed to do that, and even then it would stop working eventually as well"
,Valagard,2012-03-26T20:06Z,"--------INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS I FOUND WORKS---------------------

Install Bandicam

Do -NOT- start after installation

Copy over all cracked files

Go into windows firewall advanced properties

Block Bandicam.exe in both inbound AND outbound, make sure YOU DIRECTLY PATH TO THE EXE, copy this

into the pathing C:Program Files (x86)Bandicambdcam.exe

Start up Bandicam RegFixer

Back up both the x86 and x64 keys

Start up bandicam

Close bandicam

Start back up bandicam, it -WILL- fail and ask for a reinstall, close that window

Open up Bandicam Regfixer, RESTORE both the x86 and x64 keys

Now start up Bandicam, it should now work repeatedly from now on without errors

------------------------------

This doesn't change the fact that the crack is still incomplete, and that you have to do this massive walk-around with the crack in order to get it to function

Meanwhile the proper 1.7.5 crack you just copied over, and it -ALWAYS WORKED-, no firewall blocking, no backing up reg keys etc"
,xRESTRiCTx,2012-03-26T22:58Z,"I admit the crack is a bit poor, but it removes the watermark etc so that nice"
,Valagard,2012-03-27T06:55Z,"As per my instructions, the crack still doesn't work properly, I need to re-apply the registry keys after -EVERY- reboot of my system

Back to MSI Afterburner till this gets fixed"
,guerillaboi,2012-04-22T11:54Z,ive followed everything to the letter and still cant get rid of the watermark :/
