,Northernknight3,2012-03-25T14:01Z,Some of the info in the film is highly inaccurate - for example it claims that some Spitfires were still in front line service in the RAF in the Nineteen Sixties - whereas in actual fact the last Operational Flight of three Spitfires was based at RAF Woodvale and was used to obtain daily weather readings as part of the UK Weather forecast - it was withdrawn in June 1957.
