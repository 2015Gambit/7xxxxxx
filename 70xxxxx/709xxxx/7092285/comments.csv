All of CP's uploads are shit. Learn to do it right or don't do it at all, CP. Look at ettv. They know how to do it. And why is their uploads better and pristine quality and smaller in size than yours? Stop what you're doing."
,givemeav,2012-03-17T04:38Z,"Indeed. C_P's releases are shit in 99% of the cases. I've seen some pretty decent ones but most are just crap. The quality would've been good about 10 years ago, but the year is 2012. It boggles the mind. How can these people fuck things up the way they do? What are they going to do next? VHS rips of new shows?

C_P torrents should be banned from torrent trackers. It's pathetic in this day of age to have such shitty releases, especially by people who have been doing this for quite a while and should've learned the proper way to capture/rip/encode long ago."
