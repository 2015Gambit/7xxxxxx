Notes from Dime:

Here is a very cool DVD I know MANY people would be interested in to have!
Here is the story;

Ledstedt, Stockholm, Sweden, was a rock fan and owned a Super 8 camera for
some short years in the 70's. He filmed a reel at 3,5 mins at various rock
concerts in Stockholm between 1976-1980. He has since then stored these reels
in his cellar. 2 months ago he told me, Godzilla32, about these reels, and he
said I could convert them professionally to DVD, and do what I want with them.
Thx to Cheaptrick also for upping to Dime.

My note:

This was a larger torrent on Dime with other music groups. I seperated Bob's
footage from that and created this individual folder and modified text for
the reggae massive who'd prefer to have this only.

The footage is excellent picture quality, but has many splices and is hand held
(shaky). I am happy to have, but if you're not a Marleyphile you may want to skip.
