if u look at the files u will see there are 65.
if u click onto the blue part of the files you will be able to see them.kk"
,dangermouse2001,2012-03-17T00:20Z,"thanks for replying. I see the files - 65, but what i was asking is if the album follows on like a house cd, cos usually with the rnb or hip hop comps its just individual tracks. maybe cos of the different bpm etc?"
