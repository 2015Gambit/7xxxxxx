- The Sitter
-Paranormal Activity 3
-A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas 
and
-50/50

I'll *try* to do Harold and Kumar. When I see a good quality version of The Sitter, I'll convert (I've only seen cams so far). Probably no to PA3 and 50/50 tho, I'm too swamped right now do do much more than new (this week) releases. Sorry. :("
