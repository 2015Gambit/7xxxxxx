COUNTRY GUITAR THUNDER was originally released by Merle Travis and 
Joe Maphis in 1983. This is a repackaged version of that album, with 
bonus tracks and different cover art.

Merle Travis recorded his portion of this album in association with 
veteran flat-picker Joe Maphis (maybe the fastest guitarist that ever 
lived) during 1977 and 1981 in Nashville, Tennessee, Albuquerque, New 
Mexico, and Charlotte, North Carolina. It's an all-instrumental album 
made up of duets and Maphis solo-featured numbers, and material ranging 
from traditional pieces like "Irish Washerwoman," "L'il Liza Jane," and 
"John Henry" to movie and television theme music ("Ballad of Thunder Road," 
"Bonanza"). The sound is crisp and vivid, as well as surprisingly warm, 
and these guys knew how to make the stereo separation work for them. Six of 
the 16 tracks are Maphis numbers, but the rest is a dazzling interweave of 
playing by two of the greatest country guitarists that ever lived. And it's 
budget priced, to boot.

Performers include: Joe Maphis, Merle Travis, Marty Stuart, David West, 
Tom Corbett, Dennis Caplinger.
