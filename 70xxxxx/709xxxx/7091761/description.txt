EPISODE SUMMARY

Srinagar, Kashmir. Dominic King is negotiating the release of a British Asian 
family kidnapped while on holiday visiting their son Mahavir. As the handover is
completed, the police arrive and a shoot-out ensues. The kidnappers (Anwar and 
Leela) get away with Mahavir and in their panic they board a tourist bus, taking
all the passengers hostage. Dominic must negotiate with Anwar, whilst trying to 
convince the police not to attack. Beth, a housewife in Manchester, sees the 
coach on the news and realises her parents and husband, Shaun, are hostages, and
heads to Srinagar. When Anwar learns his family has been arrested he threatens 
to kill a hostage an hour until they are released. Dominic persuades Anwar to 
give him until dawn to get the family released but things escalate when Carrie 
and Dominic discover there is someone important on board the bus.
