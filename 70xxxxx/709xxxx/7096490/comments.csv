,wallmartysec,2012-03-12T23:06Z,"I made the mistake of following you and downloaded it. It's a crappy low budget flick with crowds of zombie children, men and women, running very fast indeed after the poor humans, but so poorly made up that it is just a bunch of people with smudges on their faces, not the half-eaten and terrible looking real zombies you see elsewhere. The 6.4 it got surely comes from retards and rednecks who never watched a proper zombie movie. "
