The Violent Century:
The 20th Century was the most violent in the history of our planet. In no other has war been so widespread or caused so much suffering and loss of life. The Violent Century looks at the background to the wars which have convulsed our planet, and the amazing technological advances which have transformed warfare in our time.

The World Goes To War 1900-1914:
As the 20th Century dawned, the world was enjoying a period of peace and prospery seldom experienced before. Yet just over a decade later this apparently stable era collapsed into a massive war involving all the major European powers. The World Goes To War describes the world of monarchies and empires with which the century opened, and the few swift weeks in which this descended into a conflict which changed the world forever.
