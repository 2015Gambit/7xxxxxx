,Espionage724,2012-03-13T03:39Z,"a good bit of people are around 50% now with one nearing 60% :)

Hopefully people start hitting 100% in a day or two so these speeds increase :)

Also, my max upload is 100kb/s"
,Espionage724,2012-03-14T00:55Z,"These discs are also NTSC-J for those curious (but as I said, you can also just force a specific TV type from USB Loader GX or whatever you use)"
,Espionage724,2012-03-25T00:39Z,Also please use encrypted protocols in your Bit Torrent clients. I only accept encrypted connections :)
,zeldaman101,2012-06-03T11:50Z,Could you upload Kettei-Ban on it's own? I already have the first 3.
,Espionage724,2012-07-04T17:32Z,"You can manually select Kettei-Ban to download and exclude the rest from your torrent client (uTorrent and Tixati allow this, pretty sure others do too)"
