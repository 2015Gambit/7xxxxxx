Taiko no Tatsujin Wii
σñ¬θ╝ôπü«θüöΣ║║
Taiko Drum Master Wii

Genre: Music
Language: Japanese (lots of Hiragana and Katakana, some Kanji)
Controller(s): Wii TaTaCon(s) and/or Wiimote(s)
Format: .wbfs
(the reason for this format is to save space. If I had used .iso it would
of resulted in all disc images being around 4.37GB each.)

TAIKO Wii [R2JJAF] = Taiko no Tatsujin Wii
TAIKO WII2 [S2TJAF] = Taiko no Tatsujin Wii Dodoon to 2 Daime
TAIKO WII3 [S3TJAF] = Taiko no Tatsujin Wii: Minna de Party 3 Daime
TAIKO WII4 [STJJAF] = Taiko no Tatsujin Wii: Kettei-Ban

I also included "WBFS Manager" and "Wii Backup Manager" for convenience :)
(feel free to use them, or grab updated versions, or whatever)

You can use "Wii Backup Manager" to convert the titles over to .iso format,
and then load them onto a USB Flash Drive or SD card via "WBFS Manager", and 
start them via "USB Loader GX". You may also use other methods to start the 
game(s) if you know what your doing.

Depending on your Console version/type, you may have to force a TV setting 
for the game to appear.

Tested on a Wii (Black) with 4.1 System Menu and USB Loader GX. I had to force NTSC.

It seems to also be possible to play these games on Dolphin, but I experienced input
lag from a real wiimote. Experience may vary.

TLDR Info:
- This torrent includes all 4 Taiko no Tatsujin games for Wii
- You'll probably need to convert .wbfs to .iso
- You need a soft/hard modded wii

Enjoy!
