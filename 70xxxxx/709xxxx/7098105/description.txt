Huey Lewis and the News is an American rock band based in San Francisco, California. They 
had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually scoring a total of 
19 top-ten singles across the Billboard Hot 100, Adult Contemporary and Mainstream Rock 
charts. Their greatest success was in the 1980s with the number-one album, Sports, coupled 
with a series of highly successful MTV videos. Their worldwide fame expanded when the song 
"The Power of Love" was featured as a key track in the film Back to the Future, became a 
number-one hit, and nominated for an Academy Award. The News combined a rock (and sometimes 
a "blues-rock") backing with soul and doo-wop-influenced harmony vocals and Lewis' voice.


Sports is the third album by American rock band Huey Lewis and the News, released in 1983. 
This was the album that made the band famous, reaching number one on the Billboard 200 on 
June 30, 1984, and making the band internationally known. The album has been certified 7x 
Platinum by the RIAA. Sports was ranked number 2 on Billboard's 1984 year-end album chart
after Michael Jackson's Thriller, and spawned four top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and 
a fifth that went top 20. It also did very well internationally, with most of its singles 
reaching chart peaks in various countries.
