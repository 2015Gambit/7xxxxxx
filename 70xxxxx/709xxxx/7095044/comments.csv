,Crash2701,2012-03-14T03:06Z,"I ""supposedly"" had a fully activated version of WIN7 with all the bells and whistles... 
Well, turns out I didn't.
An hour ago I was accidently right-clicking 'My Computer' and selected Propetries. And there, in all it's might and glory my OS was informing me that I only had 4 days left to activate the bloody thing. WHEWWWW!
Long story short, found this jewel, tried it and >BINGO"
,Grooge,2012-03-17T19:54Z,Thank You.
[V],wilimaw,2012-03-19T01:53Z,you're welcome
,carriecelery,2012-03-25T18:37Z,"I installed Windows 7 Home Premium (x64) without entering a product key and patched it to Service Pack 1. I ran this loader and Windows reports that is is activated. It successfully passed the Microsoft Genuine Advantage component embedded in the Microsoft Security Essentials package.

It worked perfectly for me. Thank you so much!"
,stuXter83,2012-03-29T17:42Z,"Works excellent!
Downloaded, Installed, rebooted.

,mikehouston09,2012-07-31T04:36Z,work great thanks
,corbryant,2012-08-12T12:45Z,"Okay, I've been doing this shit for YEARS, and used the same WGA Chew program to activate, or to remove WAT to be more specific.  Works.  So, I wanna play BF3 and needed to install 64bit on my semi-shitty system to play it.  LOL  I guess 64bit is a different animal when it comes to activation because my shit didn't work.  After trying 5 or 6 other ""64bit"" activators this is the only one that works.  And it's pretty impressive.  Has controls for all options that would normally stop one or the other form working.  OEM table IDs, etc.  Very nice!  I'll be adding this one to my library.  LOL!  I don't usually comment, but I thought this one might be worth the time!"
,corbryant,2012-08-12T12:48Z,"@willmaw: You're the man...or woman, whatever the case may be.  Thanks.  It's 5AM and I was sick of trying shit.  Gooooodnight!"

,nfsndrg,2012-08-25T23:48Z,All updates done with no problems (even Service pack 1).
,grafx1,2012-09-01T21:56Z,"Would this fix some kind of volume licensing issue i`m having?

""The Software Licensing Service reported that the computer could not be activated with a Volume license product key. [..]"""
,Luggen1,2012-09-23T14:54Z,"Amazing! 
It works like a charm with win 7 Ultimate. Just a click, a restart and it's registrated :) 

You are the best! 
Thanks a lot!!!"
