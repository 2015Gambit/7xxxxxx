SYNOPSIS:  
Many horror-film fanatics call F.W. Murnaus silent German classic starring Max Schreck - who sports grotesque makeup that transforms him into a symbol of pestilence and decay - the scariest Dracula adaptation ever. The chilling tale kicks off when a real estate agent (Gustav von Wangenheim) begins conducting business with eerie Count Orlok (Schreck), who goes on a rampage when he becomes obsessed with the mans comely wife (Greta Schr√∂der).
