,sykfuk,2012-07-08T11:29Z,I have the most recent version and I followed the directions but when I start up the game I get a message telling me that they can't verify that it's a valid copy. Can I get some help?
,kristenrofl,2012-07-11T20:07Z,having the same problem with validity. please help!
,candycoatedlove102,2012-08-05T01:30Z,Are you 10000000% sure that you're putting the crack in the right location? Because I've had to go on TeamViewer with people and they did the crack step completely wrong.
,unstoppablekurt,2012-08-07T03:00Z,guys I think what you're doing wrong is running it from the launcher. You have to run the game from the crack.
