At least make sure your uploads are working properly before you put them up, jesus. "
,MaradonXP,2012-05-13T23:00Z,"Not only does every episode work, but they all stream to the PS3 perfectly without needing to be transcoded."
,gmfreeman,2012-05-29T04:59Z,portions of the episodes are simply blank. would not recommend.
,MaradonXP,2012-06-29T03:59Z,"I retract my earlier comment, I was looking at another season, this one is definitely broken."
,eviltapes,2012-07-21T19:49Z,"Bad upload. Like stephenball70 said, about half of the episodes are unwatchable or missing a few minutes. Even on the ones that work, quality is very inconsistent."
