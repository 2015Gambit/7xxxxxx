[V],Nepotu,2012-03-10T18:21Z,"God bless you too, my dearest friend Dimmis80! Your words worths all the effort of the rippers (and uploaders). I know that our example will make other people to join us, to put their stuff here on the net to share with us. It's not a copyright matter it's a matter of unselfish sharing to all the people who love this game and don't have other possibilities to watch these games. Make people happy, that must be the reason of any human kind. God bless you all!"
