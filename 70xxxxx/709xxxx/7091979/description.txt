Chihuly in the Hotshop 
In 2006, world-renowned artist Dale Chihuly reunited glassblowers from important periods of his career in a weeklong residency at the Museum of Glass in his hometown of Tacoma, Wash. The residency brought 40 artists and gaffers together to produce pieces revisiting 13 of Chihuly's most important and best-known series. CHIHULY IN THE HOTSHOP captures highlights of that historic event, following Chihuly and his teams as they create magnificent works of glass art before an appreciative live audience in the museum's state-of-the-art hotshop. Filmed in high-definition, the documentary offers an intimate, close-up view of the artist's process, from initial design to completed piece.
Even if you have no interest in Art at all this is a superb chance to see world class Glass Blowing
