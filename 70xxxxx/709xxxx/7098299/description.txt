Product Description

You donΓÇÖt need to have been born under a lucky star, or with incredible wealth, 
or with terrific contacts and connections, or even special skills...but what you 
do need to succeed in any of your life goals is self-discipline. Unfortunately, 
most people give in to the two worst enemies of success: they take the path of 
least resistance (in other words, theyΓÇÖre lazy) and/or they want immediate 
gratification: they donΓÇÖt consider the long-term consequences of the actions 
they take today.

No Excuses! shows you how you can achieve success in all three major areas of your life:

1. Your personal goals.
2. Your business and money goals.
3. Your overall happiness.

Each of the 21 chapters in this book shows you how to be more disciplined in 
one aspect of your life, with end-of-chapter exercises to help you apply the 
ΓÇ£no excusesΓÇ¥ approach to your own life. With these guidelines, you can learn 
how to be more successful in everything you doΓÇöinstead of wistfully envying 
others who you think are just ΓÇ£luckierΓÇ¥ than you. A little self-discipline 
goes a long way...so stop making excuses and read this book!
