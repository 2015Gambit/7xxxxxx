Christmas Eve, year 2012. In a snowy Manhattan, a swarm of hideous organic structures suddenly burst from under the ground, killing several people and destroying many more structures in the process. They are dubbed the ""Babels"". These plant-like roots bring with them coiled life-forms, called the ""Twisted"", that actively attack and seemingly consume humans.[citation needed] Within a year of the attack, an investigatory team known as the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation) is formed. One of the members of CTI is Aya Brea, who was found lying blood-soaked in a wedding dress outside St. Thomson's Cathedral in 2010 just before the Babels and Twisted began appearing. Dr. Hyde Bohr, Chief of CTI, found Aya stripped of her memories from the years before.[citation needed] After taking Aya in, the CTI discovered that she was capable of transferring her soul from body to body, an ability dubbed ""Overdive"". Bohr and the others planned to use this unique ability to travel back through time and prevent the disaster. They developed a machine called ""Overdive System"", which makes use of Aya's ability and can send her in the past to take control of someone else's psyche and therefore their actions. The machine was completed in 2013 and utilized 2 years after the Twisted first appeared."

HAVE FUN ... "

enjoy ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-12T15:46Z,"The users must excuse me but i have to say the next things : this is my first and maybe the last upload for a game for the PSP , somehow i feel that all the nice intention in making the users get a nice PSP game with everything perfect on the emulator gets more recepivity , if for one side the PSP iso is untouched , for the other the PC users got much less problems or any getting the emulator more updated as possible with correct configurations to the use of the emulator on the PC amd mow i can tell a little personal story ...
I played the Parasite Eve 1 and 2 and i found out some time ago that the 3rd game of the series was only available for the PSP then i decide to check is compatibility with the best PSP emulator on the PC and i got lucky , nice playability with little things on the videos audio here and there but nothing really bad that means a threat or be boriing the playability nd i like when it is possible to make a new creative file to upload , on this case by casuality i maded a PSP game file after checking the comportment of the iso on the emulator and if i got the game for myself it wasnÂ´t any special problem upload him to the others taking in mind all the necessary help that the emulators needs to run better as possible ...

Thank you and happy game and of course i am a little sad with the number of users for the moment but with my conscience absolutly ok about the intention of presenting a nice interesting new file for the PSP and still having all the normality on the iso itself for the ownwers of a real handeld for this game ... and of course that The 3rd Birthday game it is the correspondent to a Parasite Eve 3 that surprisingly is only beeing available many years after the make of he first 2 games of the series ... enjoy ."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-12T19:20Z,"This comment it is to say that i am on the third level already without a single problem with the emulator , graphics always looking nice and the videos running normal and the gameplay is close to the ideal , maybe 5 frames per second less or something , really no big deal , so far so good , certainly playable no doubt ...

Happy gaming ..."
