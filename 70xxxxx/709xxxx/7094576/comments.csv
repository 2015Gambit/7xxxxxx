,mamun777,2012-03-13T22:07Z,"Hello tr108,
Can you help me please, I have over 250 1080p .mkv format movie file. All Iâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;m asking for is encoding tool that you are using for iTunes format. What tool you are using? I really like yours  .m4v file formatâ&#x20AC;Ś.Please help!"
,marko997,2012-03-14T04:24Z,@mamun777 i guess he uses Handbrake. thats for me the best convertion tool. Converting a 4-5 Gb takes in my Mac about 5 hours. A 1080p will take loooooong.
,BlueTak,2012-03-14T15:20Z,"@tr108 ~ I use Handbrake for .mkv files too, I'd like to know if you do, and whether you stray far from the ATV2 preset?"
[T],tr108,2012-03-14T21:43Z,"@donotcare-- I probably won't get to the other H&K movies, or any TV shows beside the Justice League Unlimited animated series, till the summer. If I'm still around then, remind me :) 

To everyone asking-- yes, I use HandBrake (the nightly builds from https://build.handbrake.fr/) on my Mac. I actually still use the ATV G1 preset with adjustments (Constant Quality 22 or 21, AC3 to 384 Kbps, and tweaks in the Advanced tab). If I used the ATV2 settings, my encodes might even be 5-10% smaller but that would eliminate the G1 people. Perhaps in the near future, as ATV3's start multiplying, I'll move things over to the G2 preset tho..."

,k.haas32,2012-03-24T08:14Z,ive actually have a question. Why is that we have to click on Magnet now to download? When I do it this way I can see the files that are downloading. I used to be able to click on the green arrows to download that particular movie. Any help on how this works now?
[T],tr108,2012-03-24T22:26Z,k.haas32 - there was a TPB blog post about the switch to magnet links: https://thepiratebay.se/blog/208
