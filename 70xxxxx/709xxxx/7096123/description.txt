          Game Info:

            Control the game by connecting one to four Game Boy Advance
            systems to the Nintendo GameCube (no Game Pak is required for
            the Game Boy Advance). 
            
            Explore cooperatively on a single television -- or duck into
            the underground world within your Game Boy Advance to see what
            lurks below. 

            Work together with other players to defeat enemies that go
            back and forth between the Nintendo GameCube and Game Boy 
            Advance screens. Control enemies on the Nintendo GameCube by 
            hitting switches on the Game Boy Advance screen with your sword.

            Use strategy to find out where other players are on the Nintendo
            GameCube screen or where they're hiding in the caverns of the
            Game Boy Advance. While players are inside the caves or houses,
            they can see secret messages on the Game Boy Advance screen or
            perform actions without others knowing.

           -- Enjoy yet another major from your friends in iPH --
