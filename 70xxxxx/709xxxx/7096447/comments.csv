,joew771,2012-05-19T02:48Z,"Thanks for the upload.
I am not blaming you karaokeking123, but this book is completely awful. It has some of the worst writing I have ever come across and I read a lot of books. Like lots. I have nothing against erotica or porn either, this book is just plain bad. Extremely repetitive, boring and silly. It started life as Twilight fan fiction and you can tell. It reads as if it were written by a 13 year old girl with no idea of what sex or love are or what erotica is or what good writing is for that matter.
Read at your own risk."
,joew771,2012-06-09T11:46Z,"If anyone wants to read a serious book about sex and sadism and domination and erotica and philosophy that is well written- 

Look here, though you should be careful and read the warnings.
