Picture is terrible, no color at all......"
,mranonymous333,2012-03-11T02:37Z,"Just a friendly heads upâ&#x20AC;Ś this release has french subtitles only, no english subs at all."
,marec1x,2012-03-13T21:50Z,"Diet_cola

,BangUchiha,2012-03-19T12:35Z,"The commentors before this are complete idiots.

I have actually watched this torrent: 
A: 10 Audio IS in sync, which is mostly orchestra music
V: 10 watched it perfectly on my 60"" HDTV BlueRay quality
(not widescreen though)

It is supposed to be black and white! That is how they filmed it retard = Diet Cola

It's movie onscreen captions are in French but there is english subs you need to load which show perfectly and on time when loaded. I used media player classic which I prefer over the new versions.

Great movie, Thanks froggie100!"

,tg99,2012-04-01T18:50Z,"IMPORTANT: I didn't notice before downloading, the video is in 4:3 ratio! 960x720! "
,moshster,2012-04-05T09:30Z,It's supposed to be 4:3 !!!! This movie is intended to look and feel like an old silent era movie.  The only thing that is modern is the audio which is in 6 channel surround.
,tg99,2012-04-08T19:23Z,@moshster Check the aspect ratio mentioned on the imdb.com and you'll have your answer.
,roboyle,2012-04-15T23:26Z,"Just to re-itterate, at the time of posting this is the most popular torrent for this film - readers should not though that the onscreen captions are all in French (with English subtitles). Not a major issue I suppose but I've gone abck and got what (I hope) is the same thing but with English captions. Worth considering before downloading!"

,Ruby_pirate,2012-04-18T04:23Z,GREAT quality! I always trust you froggie100. Thanks so much! :D
,mCihhh,2012-05-09T03:26Z,"@tg99
Well, you need to check it yourself because on imdb it says ""1.37:1"" and that's 4:3
This movie is supposed to be 4:3 and in b&w."
