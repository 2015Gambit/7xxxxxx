After midnight, Darian Dax (Seana Ryan) rules the airwaves from Palm Beach to Biscayne Bay. Her seductive purr and her killer instinct for exposing her listeners' most intimate secrets has made 'Night Heat', her late-night call-in show, the undisputed champion of the Miami radio market. Encouraging her callers to share their forbidden fantasies, she lures her audience into the roles of exhibitionist and voyeur. For five hours each night, she is queen of the dark heart of a booming, newly hip city throbbing with lust, greed and ambition. But being rich, beautiful, and famous is not enough for Darian, who has plenty of lust, greed and ambition of her own. In addition to her hosting duties, Darian has an extraordinary lucrative sideline. Fantasy and reality overlap as we hear the callers describe their scenarios and watch Darian's girls enact them.
