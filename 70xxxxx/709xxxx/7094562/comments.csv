,Famousdim,2012-03-13T19:57Z,"Dear vtwin88cube, I admire almost all your torrents/collection and when you have a torrent in here I know is a good quality. I also like Led Zepp very much and also Yardbirds but this CD's has nothing to do with that especially to kill with guitar. I know very well Jimmy but here he is very child!"
