2 Reviews from Amazon.com pieced together to sum up the album.

The Original Edition of the classic album later released on Beastie Boys' Grand Royal imprint. This is the raw pre-Mario Caldato Jr-ized (and better) version of the album that would become SWAX.  From the writer/producer of hits from Baby Bash, Paula Deanda, The Grouch, Luckyiam PSC, The Federation, Mozella, etc!

If you like the album then go buy it.
