Apparently there are no plans to release this splendid movie in Britain, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa.  So as a service to the public of those nations I offer this torrent.  I take credit for neither the video nor the subtext. The subtext is an amateur effort and not perfect, but more than acceptable and it captures the fine humour of the screenplay.
