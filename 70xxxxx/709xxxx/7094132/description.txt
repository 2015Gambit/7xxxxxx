Paolo Parente's Dust comics of the hit table top game about an alternate history set during World War 2.

With the "Dust" universe, Parente has rewritten history so that in 1938, the Axis powers discovered a spacecraft in Antarctica filled with advanced alien technology, giving them a tremendous edge over the rest of the world. "They used this technology to build a fantastic army of robot machines, missile technology, jet fighter crafts and night vision," Parente told CBR. "When the Allies' D-Day assault happened, the Axis was able to hold off the Allies with this new technology. This created a stalemate in the world similar to the Cold War of the '80s. The Allies now have Generation 1 technology and the Axis were at Generation 3 technology."
