Wake up to information being read to you, like weather, sports, and more!
Smarter Alarm is a talking alarm clock. Instead of hearing an annoying alarm, youΓÇÖll wake up to the voice of a robotic British woman who will read personalized information to you, like "Jarvis" in Iron Man.
Would you like to know if you'll need to dress warmly today? How about the score to last night's basketball game? Smarter Alarm will read information that's important to you, such as weather, your latest emails, Google calendar appointment, sports scores, stock prices, birthdays, the morning's headline news, and your own RSS feeds.
Feeds that Smarter Alarm can read to you:
- Current and forecast weather
- Stock prices
- The day's headline news
- Sports scores of your favorite teams (NBA, NHL, NFL, and MLB)
- Your Facebook friends who have birthdays today
- Your Google calendar appointments for the day (requires Android 2.0+)
- Your Google tasks
- Your latest Gmail emails
- Your Facebook events in the next 24 hours
- Custom RSS feed
- What happened on this day in history
- Quotes of the day
- Make generic GET and POST requests
