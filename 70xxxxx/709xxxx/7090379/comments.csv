,candycoatedlove102,2012-03-10T06:34Z,"@goodbyelullaby
Yeah, I did. :). On the first one, I forgot to put the crack and serial number in the iso file so I had to re-upload but now everything is good.

@thatcheezepersonorwhatevesurnameis

Ask SuprBay to ban you. Next time, don't randomly come and ruin my torrent page. I don't need spammers like you ruining my page. Goodbye.."

,candycoatedlove102,2012-03-13T21:49Z,"Uhh.. yes, it'll work on a Macintosh computer. I don't know how you insert the crack though."
,thunder_shock10,2012-03-16T17:57Z,why cant i download??
,candycoatedlove102,2012-03-17T13:47Z,Because your computer needs to support the Magnet Links. Update your browser.

,DJfairy,2012-04-02T22:09Z,how do i seed and what does it mean!!!!!!!!!!
,candycoatedlove102,2012-04-04T20:48Z,"Seeding means that you finished downloading the game but didn't delete it from your torrent list. So seeding uploads, a certain percentage of MB or GB to a source that provides the game for you.

So a seeder provides a token for a leecher to download the game without interruptions"
,pshi,2012-04-05T12:43Z,Someone please seed D:
,dizzybugx,2012-04-08T12:14Z,Someone please seed!!!! Stuck at 91.7% :(:(
,candycoatedlove102,2012-04-14T06:28Z,Sorry. I can't help with seeding anymore. D: I deleted the torrent off of my seeds because I thought that it would have had seeds like the other torrent. So I would have to make a whole new Generations torrent and re seed but that would take so much time.
,skydan39,2012-04-22T03:29Z,thanks
