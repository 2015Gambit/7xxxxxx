,kevnah7,2012-04-14T00:56Z,"@Gabriel Thank you, but the torrent wont let people download the last 4 pieces to several songs so I'm going to try deleting it and re uploading it"
,GabrielKnoc,2012-04-14T03:27Z,"@kevnah7 I've started downloading it again, i'll have to wait until you're able to seed it again, if you could see it for as long as you possibly could for about a week that'll be great. I'll comment stating whether i've downloaded it or not. I'll also seed for other people's sake"
