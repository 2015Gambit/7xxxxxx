A Funeral Home owner has two friends who run a diner. Both enterprises aren't doing too well. So they think of a fiendish way to increase their businesses revenues. Well many rate this as a very bad movie. It is actually an intentionally silly horror movie and when you keep that in mind it is OK. And at least it is barely over one hour long. Being made in 1966 gives it some pleasing aspects like the music and  the three villains each have a beautiful mid-60s Triumph motorcycle which look and sound awesome. It has a fun review of all the characters before the ending credits are shown.

I added some things before and after this movie which are about from the same time. There is a Coca-Cola, Newport cigarette and Folgers coffee commercial, then a Television Code of Conduct PSA before. After are a Colt 45 Malt Liquor commercial, a 10 minute long Westinghouse air conditioner models for 1966 short film featuring a pretty dancing presenter (probably shown at trade shows and dealer meetings), a Noxema mens shaving cream commercial and finally a movie trailer for Modesty Blaise.
