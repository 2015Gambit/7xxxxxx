Recorded Live at , Stockholm, Sweden - September 26, 1986.
Personnel: Cliff Burton; James Hetfield; Lars Ulrich; Kirk Hammett .
Notes: Cliff Burton's last show - Luckily, this is the same show James Hetfield returned to playing guitar (I guess he had an injury and was only singing for a while) so we get one last set with the whole band in full. (by cooperaa - Taken from rateyourmusic.com) .
