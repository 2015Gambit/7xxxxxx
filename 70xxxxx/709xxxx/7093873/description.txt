NOTE FOR MY MOVIE TORRENTS: Each movie has been hashed with an MD5 checker and I am listing the hash below. MD5 programs are designed to verify data integrity using the MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) 128-bit cryptographic hash. MD5 hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and authenticity.
In terms of integrity, an MD5 hash comparison detects changes in files that would cause errors.
