,nmann22,2012-04-07T20:38Z,"Seriously!? Its sad that No one understands resolution!!!
1080 = 1920x1080 not (1920x800)?
720 = 1280x720 not 1024x535 what is that!?

TITLE STUFF PROPERLY ITS NOT THAT HARD!!!!!!


YET GOOD UPLOAD!!! "
,hvlp1,2012-04-13T04:49Z,"Bit Defender is blocking the download, is it safe to bypass and ignore this"
,Johnny_Sleven,2012-06-02T04:38Z,"@nmann22

Settle down... The reason for the smaller vertical resolution is cropping of the black bars. Do your research before you yell at the guy that took his time to burn and upload for you."
,Johnny_Sleven,2012-06-02T04:38Z,rip i mean :)
,Groovejet,2012-06-02T06:51Z,"seriously it's sad when a fool lile nmann22 doesn't know the difference between 16x9 TV aspect ratio and 2.35:1 movie ratio.

Next he'll be asking that the film should be cropped to fit his TV instead of showing black bars.

These fools and n00bs are a bigger threat to the internet than censorship."
,foegel,2012-06-10T18:00Z,"@nmann22 1920x800 is without borders. why do you even comment when you don't know what your talking about.... stupid! if you don't like it don't download it then...



Great UL as usual 3Li keep up the good work"
,Abrar_x,2012-06-26T07:04Z,"not impressed coz 3li has proved to upload greater print torrents... compared to the previous uploads this one is not satisfying at all ...and also with it's huge size...

I am a regular downloader of 3li files... and also thankful to him for his upload.. but truthfully saying that this print isn't satisfying as far as the screen shots look..."
,BlameHoffmann420,2012-07-30T11:32Z,"@Johnny_Sleven @foegel Why do you even comment when you don't know what you're talking about. 1920x1080 is not 1920x800 with cropping. It is an attempt to conceal the poor methods of compression used by noob uploaders. Most commonly seen by Yify.. The true 1080p version of this video would be 21.4 GB - as stated in the description. However, the download here is NOT 1080p, therefore it is incorrect to list it in the title, and you're both morons. "
