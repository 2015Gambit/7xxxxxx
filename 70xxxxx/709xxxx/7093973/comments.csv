There is no other English audio track included in the MKV, so unless you want a completely out of place narration of all the events taking place in the movie, I'd suggest downloading a different torrent."

Avoid this one!"
,Skrumpy,2012-03-28T04:57Z,The other comments are correct.. unfortunately the visually impaired comments really ruin the movie. I saw no way to disable these and only 1 English track is included.
,retired-nerd,2012-06-08T18:51Z,"wow. this is a HUGE waste of time and torrent space. but, the features it offers will be good for someone out there. perhaps the uploader should have done a better job and the description, instead of including a bunch of bLah."
,bluecatjenny,2012-08-16T04:06Z,"There's a pretty easy way to replace the soundtrack for the vision-impaired - download another version of the movie and replace the soundtrack.  I downloaded the currently most popular version:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5022333/I.Love.You.Man.DVDRip.XviD-DASH

and since the movie takes exactly the same length of time to play, used Freemake to turn the video from this download and the audio from the other download into the perfect version of this movie!"
