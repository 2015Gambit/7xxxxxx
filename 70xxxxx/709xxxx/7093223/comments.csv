,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-11T20:39Z,"Amazing upload and a tremendous task !
Now you got to be a MAN and seed all those babes.
If you do then you'll be da man of the year. Big thx to you ! Seed them all..."
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-12T15:49Z,"Now we are all stuck at 6,5 % (of 80gb) - Please SEED !?"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-12T19:36Z,"@rgarjr78. Still no seeding. Check your uTorrent. We're all stuck at 6,5 %."
,rgarjr78,2012-03-12T19:52Z,"it'll be back up seeding shortly, sit tight."
,KeeperUsiel,2012-03-12T20:31Z,"So...how do you have a site rip in less than 1MB?

You don't. It's a torrent link.

Why not just post the actual rip?"
,KeeperUsiel,2012-03-12T20:32Z,"In addition, the torrent file that allegedly has all 80 gigs of photos...has three whole seeds, none of which are active."
,rgarjr78,2012-03-13T02:47Z,"The .torrent file is over 1MB, when attempting to upload it here it always craps out. TPB doesn't like big .torrent files"
,Slinkey66,2012-03-14T01:21Z,How about seeding your fricken upload mate?
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-15T08:29Z,"He's seeding only occasionally, that's why we have only 12 % now after 4 days. How about giving more seed hours and all of your upload speed ? This torrent will need it if you're ever going to finish that 80 gb. Remember that unfinished zip-files will be to no other good than the recycle bin ? "
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-16T16:58Z,"thx rgarjr78 - it's looking promising now. 16,2 % and 13 GB downloaded. Keep it up !"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-30T05:38Z,"45 % now completed on 30.3.2012. 
Good but only a small fraction of the zip's are ready. Please, please continue seeding ? Do a man's work rgarjr78 and SEED !
We want the whole 80 GB of Digital Desire Babes..."
,joew771,2012-04-16T10:04Z,Everybody relax. Seeding 80G to hundreds of people takes awhile. I am at 72% right now. I don't expect to be done for another week. This stuff is free so quit complaining. Congrats on the upload rgarjr78. Pretty crazy.
,El_Kabong1,2012-05-09T07:07Z,"I'm at 80% as at 9-May. It's slowed down recently, at this rate it won't be finsihed for another couple of months. About a quarter of the zipfiles are completed, looking good.

Thx heaps, rgarjr78!"
,Fodder403,2012-08-30T00:25Z,Almost done.
