So this is a rip from the EpixHD online stream of Kevin Smiths Q&A, Burn in Hell. I'm not from the US, so I had to do this through a series of proxies which made the process very slow, so this is only the lowest quality (500k) stream. I'd say it's nudging DVD quality - very watchable. Anyway for non-US people like me this should help you out until it's on DVD :)

Only further processing on my part was converting the h264 video to xvid so it'd play nice in an AVI. The AAC audio is a direct stream copy from source.
