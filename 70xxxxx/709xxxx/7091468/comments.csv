For those of you accustomed to WifiWay and do not wish to have to use the Live CD every time you want to use this wonderful program, here I present version 3.4 already installed on a virtual machine and the ""Guest Additions"" also in place so you just have to, after installing VirtualBox, download the file, unzip it, create a virtual machine ""Other Linux Kernel 2.6"" in VirtualBox and use as a hard disk file ""Wifiway34.vdi"" that you obtained with decompression.

In addition, it also includes a tutorial with which to make future installations of WifiWay in a virtual machine."
