
Colin Murray presents the best of the action from the day's three crucial Premier League clashes which have huge significance at both ends of the table. It is a massive day in terms of who will win this season's Barclays Premier League as title chasing Manchester City and Manchester United are both in action - with City facing a tough trip to Swansea, while United host West Bromwich Albion at Old Trafford. The two Manchester sides have set the pace from the start of the season and both will be wanting to pile the pressure on each other as the run-in hots up. There is a crucial game also for relegation threatened Wigan, with Roberto Martinez's side travelling to Norwich. Wigan have struggled throughout this season and are once again in great danger. They escaped the drop on the last day of last season - they will be aiming for maximum points to maintain their hopes of survival again this time.
