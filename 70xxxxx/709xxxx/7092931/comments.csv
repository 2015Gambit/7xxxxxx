1stly, thanks for all your work and generosity. All your work are top shelf material , i see you as the new Mr Kickass or Axxo. A legend in short. Keep it up. 

I have a small grouse with you. Your early torrents used to be between 450-500MB... I remember your Taken 2008 was like 298MB. These films were small in size and made download faster and yet still retained their astonishing clarity. Your recent uploads now are relatively big 600-1.8GB. You have your skull now so why kiss the ass of the we want 1G crowd?. Pls remember you achieved ur fame on the basis of those small downloads. I appreciate your work and am still downloading ur stuff but some people have very low bandwidths and speeds..... The Alvins and Chipmunks-Chipwrecked (599MB) at least harkened me back to your good old days.THANKS"
,soletar,2012-03-11T03:56Z,"Why not-

450MB- small for the slow connection downloaders

and 

1G- for the 'i want super-clear stuff' crowd


at least, 450MB (low), 600MB (medium), 1G (high). Skip the medium one, i have noticed you are doing 2 versions these days. thanks agin.sorry for ranting but remember ur past pls. I remember those old 007 uploads and complete series that were small in size, great in quality etc..... PLS REPLY"
