,vreyhr676y,2012-03-16T05:01Z,"Hey ettv, have you ever heard of this new cool codec H.264 and this also cool audio codec AAC HE v2? You could have higher resolution and quality with half the file size of this torrent... why don't you tried instead of using old crappy encoding technology?"
,Joeyw1986,2012-03-17T08:57Z,Hey vreyhr676y how bout you pull the cock out of your mouth before leaving comments.  if you arent happy with the way a torrent is encoded or the format it is in instead of insulting and berating the uploader why dont you do one of two things 1. politely ask the uploader if they would be willing to upload a format/encoding you would like or if you lack the social tack to do so upload it yourself
,Killher,2012-03-21T20:48Z,"Word, Not all of us had a school or our mother buy us a dual-core processor for passing 8th grade. Some of us are POOR and .avi is the only thing that runs smooth.

Also, I'm tired of hearing retarded complaints about switching to magnet links. TPB HAD TO DO IT TO STAY ONLINE. All of these illegal files are hosted in a REAL country with REAL concerns about being legally attacked by the U.S. I understand nobody has said it in here, I just want to put this info in a fairly popular torrent.

And finally, I haven't even finished dl'ing this torrent but I can tell you that it's great and labeled right, just like everything else ettv has ever posted. 

Thanks for all your work guys. And thanks especially for keeping .avi alive in a world that loves to leave the poor behind."
