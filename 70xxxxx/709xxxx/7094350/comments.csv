,micron66,2012-03-12T16:39Z,Does this have any of the Special Features ?
[T],[D],2012-03-12T19:29Z,Nope.
,micron66,2012-03-12T21:07Z,"in the torrent info it says ""English commentary"",what's that ?"
[T],[D],2012-03-12T22:05Z,"It's a commentary...
Some of the episodes have the writers, directors etc talk a bit in some scenes."
,hoboX10,2012-03-12T22:44Z,"Is there a way to not play the commentary then? Is it a separate audio track? It would be pretty annoying to have them talking over the show when I want to watch it, but having a SD version of the episodes with the commentary would be nice."
[T],[D],2012-03-13T00:43Z,It's pretty obvious it's another track. Who would put it as the only track? Besides the fact that it's another codec which would suggest it's another track.
,hoboX10,2012-03-13T17:11Z,Yeah sorry I wasn't really thinking when I typed the comment.
,griiid,2012-03-13T18:46Z,SEED please :)
,usuario2,2012-03-14T02:50Z,Many thanks. You are just great
,skoumoun,2012-03-14T23:35Z,"""ESIR"" ? 
That's really the internal release ?"
,Lord1975,2012-03-15T10:43Z,Please seed.. :-)
,usuario2,2012-03-16T17:16Z,Why can't I open the torrent and choose only the parts I want to download? Does anyone know?
[T],[D],2012-03-16T18:01Z,"Because at first you only have the magnet link which doesn't contain info on what is inside. 
The clients will change in time to fix this problem."
,Hartvig,2012-03-18T23:22Z,"Thanks :) avg. download speed was 516kB/s, so a pretty fast torrent considering the size."
,usuario2,2012-03-21T03:12Z,Thanks a lot for your answer. Seems like i'm gonna have to make some space in my hard drive
,southak,2012-03-24T20:12Z,"So x264 10bit ""no external players"" means I can't play it on my NMT media player? "
[T],[D],2012-03-24T20:55Z,Yes. Not sure if it's something they can fix with a hardware update.
,AcidPhonk,2012-03-26T12:29Z,The DL is going sooo slow. Could someone please SEED. Would make me very very happy... THX already
,AcidPhonk,2012-03-26T12:31Z,The DL is going sooo slow. Could someone please seed??? Would make me very very happy... thx
,smerte,2012-03-29T01:19Z,"Thanks a lot, a really AWESOME upload!  It didn't work in my mediaplayer and my computer was almost dying when playing this. lol!

,Taevious,2012-03-29T18:52Z,"V: 10
A: 9

As to be expected, the quality is fantastic. Thanks uploader...was going nuts looking for a version this beautiful.

On another note, does anyone know if there's a way for translations to show but not the entire subtitle track?"
,griiid,2012-03-31T14:06Z,"Quality is fantastic!? you got to be joking, its full of graphical bugs and a bright pink mist at the bottom of most of the files, any comment?"
[T],[D],2012-03-31T14:18Z,You are using an old decoder. Read the description for more info.
,griiid,2012-04-01T11:36Z,"Aha! so you have any suggestions on what to update. I want to use my media player classic?
Thanks."
,griiid,2012-04-01T11:48Z,Problem solved! I just updated to a newer version of k-lite codec pack. And yes - the quality is great ;)
,Taevious,2012-04-01T11:52Z,"A comment? Yeah, update your shit and thank the uploader...aka: [D]

As he just said...read the description."
,hexenII,2012-04-02T22:11Z,"Hi [D], just confirming, the SPA sub is included, as stated above?, will start downloading tonight, but since now, my deepest thanks."
[T],[D],2012-04-03T08:40Z,All those subs are included.
,CakeMonster,2012-04-10T14:04Z,"@ [D]

Dude!

In the most respectfull way, I am saying please do not eoncode like this again

The only player to use for 1080p is Splash lite player since VLC tends to slow down or lag with 1080p files

And with your eoncoding splash lite has big problems

So please next time on your next torrent do not do it :)"
,Thieutje,2012-04-13T00:26Z,My hdi dune is even capable of playing 12bit so i don't get it why this is not working on it since it's only 10bit! Anyone ?
[T],[D],2012-04-13T09:09Z,"Those bits refer to output capabilities, not decoding. It can only decode 8 bit."
,hrqf7,2012-04-24T21:18Z,"[D], thanks for this.

But I have a question, can someone explain this to me: if the blu ray source is 8-bit than what good does 10-bit encoded rips are if the source was 8-bit, just wondering ?
[I'm a complete noob on encoding video, so apologies for the noobness.]

...and again thanks."

,dora_the_horror,2012-05-14T00:50Z,@CakeMonster You are fucking retarded and do not know shit about media players. I bet you used to use quicktime.
,umut2004,2012-05-20T14:49Z,"I'm sure it will worth to watch it so i started download like an hour ago. But please can anyone seed? 

I'm downloading with 60-100k but uploading with 500k is a bit annoying..."
,Akhenaton666,2012-05-31T00:34Z,So will these files play on a netgear multimediaplayer or what... im not into all this 8bit 10bit 12bit fuzz... anyone?
[T],[D],2012-06-03T22:01Z,"No, it won't work."
,jjonathann,2012-06-06T13:04Z,"Very good upload! 

as said in the description just update your media player and it works just fine :)"
,arkhanrj,2012-07-01T16:42Z,"Go fuck yourself idiot, no one can see this shit!!!!"
,AnonymousBasterd,2012-07-04T12:42Z,"This is encoded in 10-bit X264 so your old players WILL NOT WORK!!!

Recommended Player is MPCHC x64 (Google it)

V/A: 10/10

For the upper, Tnx! But you should've squeezed it a little bit to reduce the file size. (Purpose of 10-bit x264 is higher compression w/o compromising the video quality)"
,Jonasx,2012-09-05T19:51Z,Does this have english subs specifically/exclusively for the Dothraki dialogue? Or are the subs whole-episode only?
,bankhoop,2012-09-26T07:35Z,it plays on vlc wat else do u want
,bankhoop,2012-09-26T07:35Z,thumbs up
