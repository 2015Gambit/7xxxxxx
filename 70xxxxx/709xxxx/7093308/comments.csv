,mark59,2012-06-13T05:36Z,I support Pirate Bay with coin by wearing the tee shirts. If you can afford it - do the same for TTC. They do a fantastic job and should be supported too. Recently they are selling the courses at affordable prices. I bought 2 for a hundred bucks even though I had already pirated them.
