Details:

For their second album and label debut on Lion Music, Canada's Borealis has left nothing to chance and pulled out all the stops. Fall From Grace is uncompromising, dare I say, old school, power metal. Heavy and intense, Borealis is relentless from the gate, but in a very good way. They're forceful yet still maintain developed melodic lines and some compositional intrigue.
