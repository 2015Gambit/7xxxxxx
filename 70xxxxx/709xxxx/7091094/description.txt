Ned lived a happy life growing organic vegetables on a farm with his hippie 
girlfriend and his dog named Willie Nelson, but an unadvised incident with 
marijuana at a farmer's market lands him in jail. When he gets out of jail, 
he is off to live with his sisters. While Ned is still happy, his sisters 
are much less so after he manages to screw up one marriage, one job opportunity, 
one budding relationship and one domestic partnership. He sees those problems 
as breakdowns in communication, but his sisters see him as an idiot.
