Works on Win 7 x64 and besides unchecking hardware acceleration from the inside game menu, I also had to check these at the shortcut (or at the .exe): ""Disable Visual Themes"", ""Disable Desktop Composition"" and ""Disable Display Scaling on higher DPI settings"". Compatibility set to Windows 2000 and ""run as administration"" is also checked. Finally all settings in the graphics card control panel set to default. Be sure to also apply the updates freely available on the internet."
