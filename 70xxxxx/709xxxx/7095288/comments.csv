,cyberkeg,2012-03-28T08:45Z,"Thanks for all your uploads.  However, I agree
with PHDIKOULAS.  Although it takes much more
time, a brief synopsis of the books or at least
a link to the synopsis would be much more useful
thank info on epubs.
In addition, no problem copying/pasting the epub
info below the synopsis for those few that may 
actually not know about epubs.
Anyhow ... thanks again."
