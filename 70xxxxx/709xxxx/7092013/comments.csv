,MsMuffet,2012-08-21T03:33Z,"Thank you Ms Fenmore for providing what is probably the very last TV performance of comediene Phyllis Diller as Gladys Pope, Sally Spectra's zany side-kick. She will be missed.
This and the previous episode 03-08-12 (6276) is most likely the final appearance of Phyllis and she was cracking jokes and making it a ""Bold Gold"" episode as wedding celebrant for Susan Flannery and John McCook's final spur-of-the-moment wedding. A five star episode from the vetrans!
RIP Phyllis Diller!
Cheers from Down Under ;-)"
