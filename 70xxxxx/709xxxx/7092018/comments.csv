i cant play it on my lt2.0 ryt???
thanx..!!!!"
,carmelo7,2012-03-10T22:18Z,For some games you need to change topology from lt3.0 to lt2.0
,eternal666,2012-03-10T23:14Z,thanks boobsman ur the best
[V],boobsman,2012-03-11T00:21Z,"@ carmelo7 you only need to change topology for XGD3 games, this is XGD2 and does not contain topology data so just use abgx to check crc. Always remember that if a game has multi player  you'll need to re-burn once abgx has a proper patch for online play."
[V],boobsman,2012-03-11T00:23Z,"@ Assassinprofessor no real need for a new upload, just google the torrent title n find a seeded torrent with the same contents, you'll be able to remove the old torrent but keep the uncompleted files then continue the download with the working torrent."

,DanielRibeiroMarinho,2012-03-14T03:04Z,"Played the game about 6 hours, here's my opinion, if you're a silent hill fan, this game will bring you the silent hill 2 feeling, enought said, this game is amazing, don't hear ign !"
,DanielRibeiroMarinho,2012-03-14T03:08Z,and don't forget to play at midnight with earphones ;)
,thejackal85,2012-03-14T20:32Z,"I have literally tried everything everyone has mentioned to be able to get different games like this to work and they just haven't worked. Does anyone have a step by step on what I can do to make these work? 

I really want to learn how to do this. "
,homdawg,2012-03-15T09:03Z,"@thejackal85
1.download imgburn(2.5.6.0)
2.download abgx360(1.0.6)
3.then download the game
4.after downloading the game you will get two things
5.one .iso and one .dvd
6.dont do anything to them
7.open up abgx 360(google the internet for what settings you should use)
8.choose the iso file from abgx360
9.run abgx360
10.abgx360 will fix the errors and stuff in the iso
11.after that close the abxg360
12.open up imgburn(new)
13.click tools>settings>layerbreak to 1913760(because this game is xgd2...for xgd3,you shud use calulate optimal)
14.click on write image to dvd in the write tab
15.make the write speed to 2.4x or 4.0x if u have no other choise
16.put in a blank in your dvd burner. 8.5 DVD+R DL(verbatim for best quality)
17.click on the burn button
your all done!!!!!!!!! :D"
,Smallz94,2012-03-15T20:41Z,"@thejackal85 

if you still need help

i got a vid tutorial that i made few months ago  give me your email address and i will send it to you.. :)"
,Derpina,2012-03-16T10:05Z,"Is this game also working for PAL region? 
A while ago I downloaded SoulCaliburV from COMPLEX also, but the game wouldn't start and did show an image and recognised the disc as SoulCalibur... I thought this meant it was the wrong region. o.O"
,angelwiki,2012-03-16T17:43Z,"Guy let me warn you , all 2012 XGD2 don't follow the old burning concept we all have used in past, if u try to burn them u'll probably end up losing ur blank dvd n the process will get failed around 40% same shot happened to me while burning fifa 12 n this one lost 4 precious dvd's in total - 
so the way i came up with works like charm n i m playing it without any problems soo far -
all you gotta do is in imgburn set the layerbreak to calculate optimal and set the burning speed to (AWS) automatic write speed , it sets the speed req automatically. 
it's my opinion,  maybe for some of you the old method works fine for me it hasn't ! "

,sykotic77,2012-03-19T00:07Z,I agree set to optimal layer break im on lt3.0 and no issues going optimal.
,cold25th,2012-03-19T18:58Z,"i am a silent hill fan i have played every game they have out, but blockbuster for some reason has chosen not to stock this game. and that sucked like crazy cause i was waiting til the store opened to get the game that was not there. but anyway long story short i got online and downloaded this game and burned it to disk and started playing it with with no problems other then the game is a bit choppy but hey you know i can deal. so as i keep playing the game i believe i got about 38% of the way in and was heading to the mission point by the st, marys part of the map and right after entering a gate and u walk a little ways and your almost there the game saves twice then like 2 steps more it saves a 3rd time witch freezes the whole system. i have tried it from the hdd and the disk with the same problem in the same place. i have also 2 xbox360s and have tried it on the other system as well with the same problem. soo that leads to believe that the ISO has a problem with it. but far as download speed i got the game in less then 48 hours."
,M0NST3Rx2JZ,2012-03-23T12:36Z,It seems that people on Abgx don't know how to verify this game. All they wanna verify is older games.
