My last Fox News special "Illegal Everything" showed how government's mountain of rules stifle entrepreneurs and make criminals out of everyday people. I tried to open my own lemonade stand but New York City made it difficult. The government said I had to pass a 15-hour food protection class, which included questions about barracuda and puffer fish.
Tonight, we revisit some guests from "Illegal Everything" and others who have to deal with the piles of laws, which, at the federal level alone, now total 160,000 pages.
