Absentia 2011 HDRiP AC3-5.1 XviD-SiC 

PLOT:
Tricia's husband Daniel has been missing for seven years. Her younger sister Callie comes to 
live with her as the pressure mounts to finally declare him 'dead in absentia.' As Tricia 
sifts through the wreckage and tries to move on with her life, Callie finds herself drawn to 
an ominous tunnel near the house. As she begins to link it to other mysterious disappearances, 
it becomes clear that Daniel's presumed death might be anything but 'natural.' The ancient 
force at work in the tunnel might have set its sights on Callie and Tricia ... and Daniel might 
be suffering a fate far worse than death in its grasp.

NOTES: 
Source: 720p wmv Digital VOD Rental (Video) & DVDSCR (Audio) - BOTH Sources Our Own! 

Since this film is hitting DVD on March 13 but there doesnt appear to be a BD release coming out 
anywhere, we thought we would bring you the next best thing, an encode from a 720p source, and 
once again from the group who brought you the DVDSCR! The 720p VOD source only included 2.0 audio 
so we used the 5.1 DD from our DVDSCR source. The reason for the cut in point on the opening logo 
is because the DVDSCR didnt have the opening logo so we had to cut in that exact point to match 
the audio. Encoded from a 720p HD wmv Digital VOD Rental. Did the usual stuff, turned out nice. 

Enjoy!
