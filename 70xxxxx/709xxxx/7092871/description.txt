PLOT: A young prince is taken for tuition at a secluded seaside
hotel. But he quickly tires of his lessons and wanders off to visit a
nearby lighthouse where he has been forbidden to go. Befriended by the
lighthouse keeper, he learns of a secret world that can be seen inside
the light of the lamp. This is the world of Taxandria where all
machines, progress and time have been banned. In Taxandria an innocent
printing clerk unwittingly causes a revolution when he upsets a
printing press and tries to replace the spilled letters, only to have
his new words taken for a subversive code. On the run he falls in love
with the palace princess, discovers the forbidden art of photography
and sets out to fulfill his dream of building a flying machine.
