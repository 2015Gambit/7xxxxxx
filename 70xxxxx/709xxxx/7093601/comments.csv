That's What I Call Metal Torrents, PREFERRABLY numbers: 5, 10, 23, 29, 36 and 42 ??? I seed for 1 week after completion, and would love to complete these 6 plus Brutal Yet Melodic torrent ! Thanks a million !!!!!"
,pgugat900,2012-07-08T19:31Z,"Anyone know what happened too Bio has not uploaded in a while, did he finally get mad enough because no one is seeding. He did say a little while back he would stop if people did not start seeding more. Like DeeSund I have been trying too get a few back files only some of ones I am trying too get are not so old, like NTWICM#64."
