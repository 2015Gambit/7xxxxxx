,CookieMunzta,2012-03-10T07:49Z,Do you know if this'll work on the Black-Box version?
,CookieMunzta,2012-03-10T07:49Z,"Ahh sorry, didn't read the info properly."
,earth3,2012-03-10T10:02Z,@cookie yeah i heard this works copy it to the biogame/movies folder and run it
,elizevin,2012-03-10T15:09Z,Doesn't work for me (I downloaded blackbox rip)
,earth3,2012-03-11T01:42Z,did you run it twice?
,earth3,2012-03-11T01:45Z,"it only fixes the video encoding problem
you only need to run this if your game freezes before video like startup bioware video or something else"
,lisapower,2012-03-11T05:14Z,"this does exactly nothing. still black screen with a little icon (3) left at the top of the screen, nothing happend."
,earth3,2012-03-11T07:02Z,"@lisa it worked for many who had video encoding problems
and quoting your ""this does exactly nothing""
you gotta put it inside your movie folder and run it twice
this increases the movie size
so this does a lot of things:)
if you cant understand a fix and what it is for dont tell that it does nothing"
,earth3,2012-03-11T07:03Z,may be your problem is not with the vids
,earth3,2012-03-11T17:30Z,"forgot to mention
you need fsutil utility too download this a put inside cwindowssystem32 folder"
,earth3,2012-03-11T17:33Z,/files/2687446555/fsutil.exe
,earth3,2012-03-11T17:37Z,add rapidshare in front
,lisapower,2012-03-12T01:23Z,"@ earth3

Rapdishare link doesn't work!

i still got a black screen."
,lisapower,2012-03-12T01:25Z,"ah, ok now i got the rapidshare link, i will give a last try."
,lisapower,2012-03-12T05:24Z,sorry but where can i found the cwindowssystem32 Folder?
,earth3,2012-03-12T05:55Z,c/windows/system32
,earth3,2012-03-12T06:02Z,"try reinstalling the movie folder and run it twice
if the bioware animation shows up then this isnt your problem your problem may be something else
bioware animation wont show up if your video bitrate is below average"
,darkshadow666,2012-03-20T18:35Z,How can i run this file? This is not an exe!
