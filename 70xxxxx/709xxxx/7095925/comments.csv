,Caf1000,2012-03-12T13:38Z,Thanks for posting this! I discovered the character from a Supergirl crossover but I never could find cheap issues or digital copies. This should be a treat.
,xenoFLASH,2012-03-12T15:15Z,"MM82, have you been reading swamp thing?"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-03-12T16:43Z,"xenoFLASH:Yes,of course,it's my favorite new 52 title,besides Batman and Animal Man..."
,wolfymain,2012-03-13T05:59Z,Cheers mate....sounds good.
,new_wave_prom_81,2012-03-13T07:31Z,"Yup. LOVE Animal Man, Swamp Thing and this when I can find it. 
Never heard of RM until this. But again  same with Animal Man.
Which ""52"" Batman are you liking?"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-03-13T09:30Z,"Batman as in ""Batman"" by Snyder and Capullo,althogh I love all bat titles and I'm curious to see tomorrow's issue of Batgirl since the issue will be about Joker's shooting Barbara and how she coped with it...so something like short remainder of Killing joke and beyond..."
