,DarkN9ne,2012-03-10T16:25Z,A/V?
,Eurokie,2012-03-10T17:02Z,"A/V= 3/1
It's zoomed, grainy and the sound is terribad.
Thanks for the effort though."
,berserker055,2012-03-10T19:38Z,"A=4 V=4 
annoying arab subs in middle screen
zoomed"
,martyn666,2012-03-10T22:10Z,"its only slightly watchable im afraid, annoying arab subs so sod knows where uploader copied it from ? but if its a ""dying to must see"" then do it, watch it but i'll wait for a better copy i think.. but all the more thanks for giving me a chance. Much apprecaited !"
,theeccentrik,2012-03-11T06:08Z,"Movie is just out but a woeful upload!
V-4
A-3
And i'm being generous at that!"
,Gros_Shadok,2012-03-11T08:37Z,"On top of that, the movie is MISSING 24 MINUTES since the duration is 106 instead of 132.

So don't waste your time !"
,Gros_Shadok,2012-03-11T08:37Z,I meant 108 not 106
,Gros_Shadok,2012-03-11T08:42Z,"Also, the movie is also missing 24 minutes since it's only 108 instead of 132 so, really, if you like movies with bad video, bad audio AND missing nearly 30% of its duration, and with Arab subs covering a part of the screen, go ahead.
Personnaly, I'd rather wait..."
