The film is largely based on A Princess of Mars, the first novel to feature the hero John Carter. The story was originally serialized over six monthly installments, from February through July 1912, in the pulp magazine The All-Story; those chapters, originally titled "Under the Moons of Mars," were collected five years later as a hardcover book from publisher A. C. McClurg. In both the novel and film John Carter is a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain who is mysteriously transported to Mars, which is known to its inhabitants as Barsoom. In the course of his first adventures there Carter learns the planet is dying from the loss of its atmosphere and water. Only a peaceful alliance of its intelligent but volatile inhabitants can save all the species of Barsoom from extinction, a goal he sets out to achieve.
