[T],SoulUploader,2012-03-13T16:05Z,@MasterRaider You can add VRAM manually. A google search should tell you how.
,MasterRaider,2012-03-13T18:55Z,"I have already did Google Searches in the Past. I modified the .vmx file to say 1GB Ram but I never works in any version. Apparently that only work for Windows Guests. Any other methods? BTW my Bandwdth is slow in my area 50kb/s, I just want to ask questions while I wait my 8 days of downloading"
,MasterRaider,2012-03-13T18:57Z,BTW Thank You for your work
[T],SoulUploader,2012-03-13T23:52Z,"@MasterRaider I'll look into it, usually that works for me"
,gstued,2012-03-15T00:24Z,"...just an FYI, your website is getting blocked by Eset Nod 32. There seems to be some code in there that is not being allowed."
[T],SoulUploader,2012-03-15T04:37Z,@gstued It's because of a file I used to have hosted there. Another site took the file and they also hosted malware and so my site is now flagged as risky. Since then I moved the file to mediafire and I'm hoping the flag will be removed soon.

,jerrry94087,2012-03-20T23:33Z,"Could you please not use .exe self extracting archive? In order to use it in Linux .exe implies I also have to have some kind of Windows simulator (virtual guest or wine).

Why don't you just make it .zip archive?"
,jerrry94087,2012-03-21T04:16Z,"Could you please also make it work on VirtualBox?
Normally .vmdk can be used as a hard drive image in VirtualBox. But booting.vmdk from this torrent fails in VirtualBox."

,ovheadro,2012-05-27T20:57Z,"To those of you wanting VMTools, you will need to mount the Darwin iso (found elsewhere, I think) and run it inside of the virtual machine. It will install the additional hardware, and get  your higher rezzes and such."
