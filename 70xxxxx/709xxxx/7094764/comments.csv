I just need E07.
Now it downloads the whole lot!! :("
,rx7cosmo,2012-03-13T14:23Z,"Yeah seriously, fix this crap"
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-03-13T16:03Z,"First add this link on your torrent client, wait for few minutes till it shows the file list. Go to the file list tab. Skip the files that you dont want to dload. Thats it :)

Its not the problem with TPB, it is how the makers of bittorrent made it."
