,rebeccabouvier,2012-03-16T18:46Z,The game crashes as soon as the first loading screen finishes. Before playing I get a popup saying that my base game is more updated than the pets modified version. It says I will encocunter significant bugs/crashes and this is what happened. I went to uninstall my base game and redo everything but when going back to utorrent for this download it says it is no longer available/error. I'm very disappointed with this. Can someone help? I spent all day yesterday downloading this and now I have to find another one and try again.

What's your game version? If it's the 1.31 version, just find a link for the crack. I can't provide links, but  email me at cutiepie-100-dede@hotmail.com if you want more help."
,candycoatedlove102,2012-03-17T13:46Z,"Search up The Sims 3 Pets in the Windows 7 finder bar.

You didn't have to uninstall the game. You just needed a different crack."

,MrDarkGlasses,2012-04-08T05:39Z,"When I try to play the game it says 'Failure To Authenticate CD Copy' of the game. 
Maybe you know what I could possibly do to fix this? Please I really want to play this game."
,candycoatedlove102,2012-04-14T06:29Z,You need to crack it and keep the ISO file mounted in MagicDisc.
,FamilyMan82,2012-04-16T06:33Z,to MrDarkGlasses: You need to download the non dvd crack and put it in the sims three base bin folder. You will then have to open it from the sims 3 base directory but dont worry.. it will be sims pets.http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_the_sims_3_pets.shtml
,Sukia,2012-05-29T02:50Z,"The game works just perfectly, but the pets turn out really..hideous. They're all morphed and cut up and running around. It's funny, but I want my regular pets ;o; Does anyone know how to fix this problem?"
,sophaloaf,2012-06-23T15:26Z,"i downloaded it and cracked it, but when it gets to the choose town screen it says it is unable to verify that your disc is a valid copy... help? what do i do?"
