:: PLOT :: Monty Python and the Holy Grail loosely follows the legend of King Arthur. Arthur (Chapman) along with his squire, Patsy (Gilliam), recruits his Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Bedevere the Wise (Jones), Sir Lancelot the Brave (Cleese), Sir Galahad the Pure (Palin), and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot (Idle). On the way Arthur battles the Black Knight (Cleese) who, despite having had all his limbs being chopped off, continues to try fighting. They reach Camelot, but Arthur decides not to enter, as it is a "silly[1] place." They are then instructed by God (represented by Chapman's voice and an animated photograph of cricket figure W. G. Grace[2]) to seek out the Holy Grail.
