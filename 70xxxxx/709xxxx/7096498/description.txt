  'The only thing that will stop you from     
  fulfilling your dreams is you" People       
  have dreams, but not all of us have the     
  guts to put faith in ourselves. Most of     
  us lose focus and give up. We are most      
  afraid to believe in our own dreams.        
  Those who do are the true winners. This     
  slice of life film is set in the backdrop   
  of our capital city- Delhi. A city that     
  brings in thousands of North Indians in     
  search of opportunities that was never      
  available in their own home towns. Like     
  -wise, six boys from different states come  
  together to share a two BHK apartment in a  
  middle-class colony, which they lovingly    
  call "Sadda Adda". This film is their story.
