This is just an experiment for me, but the quality is great and the audio as well. Subs are hard coded so this flick will play on any player as well as PS3 and Xbox360. I tested this on my systems myself.

Unfortunately I changed the original file names for the video file and subs. So all credit got to them, all i did was keep the same quality and hardcode the subs to the movie so others can enjoy this.
