Whats more, once you finally get the audio to sync with the video (I use the +/- buttons in Mplayer), the video skips a bunch of frames and falls way out of sync again. Expect to have to mess with this alot. at 56 minutes, having the audio and video synced, the video glitched to the point where it was a full 4 seconds out of sync. I mean Wow..."
,jobey5000,2012-03-13T15:39Z,"For all you noobs out there, ""out of sync"" means that the audio and video don't line up. Example: you hear what they are saying, and then their lips move afterward. It is a real hassle with this movie."
,jobey5000,2012-03-13T15:44Z,"audio and video are great for a movie this new, however you will have to adjust the sync throughout the entire movie. This is the honest truth, so why are my comments being deleted?"
,prefix911,2012-03-13T16:07Z,"So far all the other uploads are fairly bad.
Hope this one is better"
,jobey5000,2012-03-13T16:50Z,"Oh, and the last three minutes of this movie, the climax of dialog, is in a foreign language... This torrent is obviously somebody's idea of a joke."
