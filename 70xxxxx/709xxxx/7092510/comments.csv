,future-dada,2012-04-16T18:01Z,It is for PC (personal computer)
,IV7144,2012-04-23T03:13Z,"So this IS for OXS right? Not Windows, as in: PCs? I have Reaktor 5.5.1 already installed, but when I go to install Razor it tells me the installation failed. "
,tylerdurden68,2012-04-25T04:32Z,Thank you for the upload. I followed all the steps but when I try to run Reaktor as a standalone app the icon bounces on the dock forever and nothing happens. It does work flawlessly as a VST plug-in and AU in Ableton Live 8.2.6.
,IV7144,2012-04-26T20:34Z,Tyler did you get Razor to install? Are you running OSX? What version? I have 10.6.8 on a new MBP. Gives me Installation Failed everytime.
,future-dada,2012-04-29T19:43Z,Tested on OS X 10.5.8 - 10.6.8 and 10.7.3 ----OK.
,yvel1,2012-06-01T12:09Z,"I had some problems to install on my mac 10.6.8. Basic installer couldn't install any of the .mpkg files of the folder. 
I used Pacifist to install Reaktor and apparely it's working.
But impossible to install Razor & Skanner ""Installation failed, there is a problem during installation, please try to install again"""

Help please!"
