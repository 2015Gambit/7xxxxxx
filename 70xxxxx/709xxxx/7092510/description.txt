VERY IMPORTANT! These are the steps to follow. (only testing AU .component and SO X 10.5.8)

1.   install Reaktor v5.5.1.mphg

2nd. Install Razor v1.0.0.mpkg

3rd. Delete (Standalone, component, VST, etc...), and paste files of the folder "UPDATE Reaktor"
     (Standalone, component, VST, etc...).

4th. Install Skanner v1.0.0.mpkg

Enjoy!

Open .rar with Stuffit expander.


The process described is a consequence of having installed Reaktor v5.5.1 with Razor, and now, having found the update of Reactor v5.6.2 to allow installation of Skanner.

And remember (old slogan of Team H2O) not making money with this Software.
