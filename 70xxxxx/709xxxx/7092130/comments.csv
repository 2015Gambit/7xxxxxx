,amztvs,2012-03-30T19:32Z,"@wallmartysec did some one told you that you should talk bad about a book that you haven't even read... or is it your belief....tell me, have you ever read it and understood it? just tell me, did you ever in your life, read the Quran? never had the time to read it, don't say I am always super busy and I don't have time. we make our own time. many scientists have researched about what the Quran said, and they were all proven true. No one could ever find a single mistake in it. first of all, read the Quran, understand it and then tell me what you think about it. there is no point in fighting against something you don't even understand. so stop believing what others say and find the truth by yourself. only then people will accept your thoughts with great detail. I might not be the best Muslim but I will not tolerate anything said against the Holy Quran. people who are against the Holy Quran say that ""we have read the Quran several time and that's why you should believe us and go against the Quran"". well why did they read the Holy Quran several times if it were all lies to them. people only read books, articles e.t.c several times only if they really like it. if they don't like it, they wont even look at it even for a second. Oo please, stop believing what others say and find the truth yourself and then decide whats right and whats wrong. just answer me this, have you ever read it, understood it, if you haven't then you have no right to say something like that."
