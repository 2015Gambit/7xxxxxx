The Zombillenium attraction park is hiring people, but only for an indefinite timespan. The selection criteria are not hard, you just have to be dead. A comedy with sharp black humor, created by Arthur de Pins.

I hope you enjoy this issue, and I also hope you're willing to spend some time correcting my choice of words/grammar where appropriate.
If my sentences are weird, please correct me, then I'll upload a new version with the corrections included.

When an official release is released, this torrent will probably be deleted. You have been warned.

Comments and ratings are much appriciated.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
