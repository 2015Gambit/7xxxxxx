- ARTIST
Little River Band is an Australian rock band, formed in Melbourne in early 1975.
It found immediate success in Australia, but It also enjoyed sustained commercial success in the U.S. where it achieved 13 U.S. Top 40 hits.
From 1976 through 1985, the group maintained a constant touring schedule which kept it in the U.S. for long periods of time and may have contributed to much of the constant shuffling of personnel.
The music and lyrics for most of the group's compositions were contributed by Goble and Shorrock primarily, with contributions from Birtles and Briggs.
The band sold more than 25 million records.
