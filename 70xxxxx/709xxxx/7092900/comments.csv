,gibson121,2012-03-11T03:01Z,Downloading and seeding. I'm surprised I found this just after you uploaded it :)
,the00negative,2012-03-11T03:26Z,"Heh, well that's a good thing, cause hopefully you can seed for a much longer time than me. Last torrent has 27 leechers and no seeders. Didn't work out so well."
,Frenetus,2012-03-11T14:38Z,"I am afraid 1080p is overkill on this series, you will get the exact same quality if you watch it with 720p on a 1080p monitor (if the encode is good ofc)."
,C4bb4g3,2012-03-11T17:30Z,"I'm stuck at 1,9%"
,Protheu5,2012-03-11T21:10Z,"Speed is very very low. Downloaded 2.6% in 4 hours, seeded twice.
If speed doesn't improve in day I'll have to quit."
,C4bb4g3,2012-03-11T21:54Z,"i went to 2,6% full speed, now i'm stuck again. the00negative are you seeding at all?"
,[Z],2012-03-11T22:05Z,"*brohoof*

I will seed twice my normal, so that is 3 times or maybe up to 5 times, I hope it helps, it seems it needs lots of seeders. Please do this once the season completes again for the full season!

Also if you have utorrent you can set it to ""initial seed"" mode which tries to spread as many parts of the files instead of just the same ones over and over so that other leechers can seed eachother different parts as well. Makes it go faster with a slow upload speed or if there are tons of leechers.

Since the initial uploader didn't, I will.

@frenetus well I notice a difference, even at good quality encodes between the 720p and 1080p. I have a good TV and an even better computer screen. Flaws are quite apparent to me. But most people don't have super good HD, in the future more will so this is a good investment anyhow."
,Frenetus,2012-03-11T23:43Z,"No you don't.
Please do the following to check if your 1080p Version of ANY piece of movie is worth 1080p.


1. Do a screenshot of a scene you think which is holding a lot of details.(in .png)

2. Load the screenshot into gimp or photoshop.

3. Resize the screenshot to 720p.

4. Save the 720p resized screenshot(also .png)

5. Open teh 720p screenshot seperately.

6. Resize the 720p screenshot up to 1080p.

7. Compare the new 1080p with the original Screenshot on http://screenshotcomparison.com/.

8. If you hover over the screen and you actually SEE a huge diference (lines arround characters are getting thicker, little details are going lost, the picture is getting blurry).


If this does not occur and the picture does look pretty much the same, you have the proof, that a 720p version would have been enough and everything bigger the resolution is just wasting your disk space because your player also can resize the material to your 1080p monitor.

I am really sad a lot of people don't get this and cling to their 1080p. :/ Most of the time 1080p is sadly just wasting your Hard disk space. (This does NOT append to real life movies, i am talking about anime and drawn stuff.)"
,the00negative,2012-03-12T01:51Z,"@C4bb4g3- I said In the description that I can only seed for so long, and that I asked for others to quickly download so they can seed once I get off. My brother plays online games and my seeding causes him to lag up to 3000 maybe 4000 ping. So I can only seed during certain times. Plus my internet connection is shut off around 9 or 10. So yeah.

@Frenetus Well I did your procedure, and it did come out a little bit fuzzy. All the details are still there, the lines are unaffected, but the whole general picture is fuzzier than normal. Plus I'm on a 1366 by 768 screen, So I do know that 720 works fine on my laptop. I guess it's just a matter of personal preference, some prefer 1080 even though 720 is just fine, but then again, 1080 will look good on any screen. My HDD has 580 Gigs of memory, and I've used about 1/5 of it with software, pictures and videos, so I'm not exactly worried about space just yet. Once it reaches past 250 to 300 gigs, then I'll start making adjustments."
,Frenetus,2012-03-12T03:03Z,"I don't want to argue with you.
(The fuzzy thing could be about your resizer not being perfect, but if you say there are no details really lost it is clear, but if you are on a screen below 1080p you can't really tell, would you mind giving me the link to the comparision?)

I guess it's just a matter of personal preference, "

,[Z],2012-03-12T06:35Z,"no the00negative you did it wrong. Its okay I did one of my own using a season 1 episode I have(since I don't have this torrent Dl'd yet). But trust me frentus, I see a very real difference. When I resized it to 720p then back to 1080p, the chance in quality was quite noticeable.

http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/112345

Anyhow, as to the torrent, Seed it like I said, with the initial seeding option. In utorrent, right click the torrent, hit properties. At the bottom is  ""Other settings"" where you will see a checkbox for ""initial seeding"" hit that. So instead of seeding part 5 of the data 12 times to 12 people. You will seed part 1-12, each to a different person, then those 12 people can seed those parts to one another, and the process should go a bit faster so we can get out of this 3% thing. 

Hope I helped. @frentus, neat test, thanks for sharing, I do see quite a noticeable difference. Very clever."
,the00negative,2012-03-12T23:19Z,"Thanks Z. I'll be able to seed today, and I started the initial seeding, so we'll see how this turns out."
,[Z],2012-03-13T01:45Z,"You can also right click>bandwidth allocation and set it to high. But if someone else needs the internet to play a videogame, you can also go to bandwidth allocation>set upload speed> and then pick whatever you want. I do that when I play videogames and set it so that overall my torrents only use half my internet upload speed. That way you can just leave the computer on and seed longer. Hope that helps too!"
,CherryCheese,2012-03-14T06:28Z,No seeds? Download stuck... fantastic.
,gibson121,2012-03-18T04:45Z,"Still seeding XD
I'm only at 20%, but that's mainly due to my connection."
,linkx7,2012-03-18T04:54Z,no seeders my down load is stuck
,cristos33,2012-03-19T22:31Z,ok halfway through WILL SEED when done. Ur welcome
,[Z],2012-03-20T09:51Z,at this rate it won't be worth it to DL. I have seeded about 10GB of this and am only at %20 sorry.
,amateur_science,2012-03-21T15:17Z,"Has anyone managed to reach 100% yet?

I've had a solid 300kb/s download so far to 5%, so thanks to the seeders! I plan to seed this a few times over. "
,CherryCheese,2012-03-22T19:13Z,"So im connected to a seeder and im downloading incredible fast now, i will seed the shit out of this when im done, for a good couple of weeks cause ill be out of town, and i have a huge bandwidth at my house.

*brohoof*"
,tech9721,2012-03-25T17:30Z,"I don't see anybody with more than 25.2% of the file. I believe it's the same 25.2%. Once my share ratio gets to 100:1, I will drop this file. Hopefully someone sends the remainder soon."
,envielox,2012-03-29T18:53Z,"Could you give us an info when you gonna seed ahead of time, so we can make sure that we are downloading at the moment ?
This torrent could use more seed's."
