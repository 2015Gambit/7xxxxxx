[V],psspss,2012-03-12T08:09Z,"for TNE and therefore.. I wont change my naming methods.. I upload the file with the naming I use
regardless of sources streaming usenet etc

i hate tags.. you dont see me messing up a filename

i always rename the files I source or convert thats just how it is

if cappers are so fragile then they should upload as soon as rip them right.. so to claim to be the first
rather then just adding to usenet and hope
others spread it to p2p

Lol i dont do egos and teeny tag stuff.



i put ref its was fqm if makes happier.. sigh 

i dont mess about with big descriptions as people want it sooner too

thats me take it or leave it.. i just get stuff up soon as possible and find the missing stuff
when scene etc let us down with mssing ones
or no caps at all..

speaking of which what happened to DEAD FILES new season :)"
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2012-03-12T08:16Z,well said :)
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T08:31Z,"the reason of the brackets is as so.

once I had filename with corrupted or bad
as titles.. e.g video.S01E01.corrupted.xvid.avi

see what i mean

whats better video.s01e01.hdtv.xvid-][ Bad ][ date ].avi

you decide.

I also like long names. i often put a shortdesc
of a movie in brackets and category

hell windows can have 200 char names why not use them I say :) great when using the win 7 search tool too..

thats my logic and reasons.. people can put tags in or rename them to suit after all

we always thankful someone rips though.,. any source any format.. nothing worse start a series then stop capping for us"
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T08:49Z,"i think cappers if want tags should just add it to the video header in the tag fields some do that also

but defacing the filenames is bad in my books"
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T08:51Z,"worse cappers add a tag to the video as a logo too!

thebox private tracker is bad for that eh"
[T],trialNerror,2012-03-12T12:17Z,"Wow. That's great and all but I think you missed the point. Once you've spread it on torrent sites and it's well seeded, you can then name it to whatever you want for your own library.

It was only suggested as polite manners to leave the scene released file(s) as is when snagging it from a warez or rls site then turning it around to a p2p site. You even say people want it faster, so make the release even a little bit faster by not bothering to rename it.  You even talk of disliking the defacing a file name, but you're removing the signature of someone other persons work.  Besides, your date in brackets is a day off because you are going by the EUR time a file is available online when the episode itself aired in USA 9~10 hours prior to that.  Also I'm sure anybody that downloads this into their library will rename it yet again to match the other previously obtained files, so there's really no need to rename anything to begin with.  

As for scene releases - there's rules about those. Rules about how the vid/aud is encoded, how they are named (no spaces or special characters allowed because servers perform better without them - they don't use Windows like the average user does) , and where they can be released. For some series they even have a rule for when they are released. They can't just post them anywhere any time.

Oh yea, The Dead Files wasn't a new season. It was just a special episode.  There is no newer episodes airing in the near future."
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T13:31Z,"who cares TNE.. geeh.. go bug someone else
with this non sense

shit you whole lot prob worse then hollywood
or gov trying to control what we do and behave"
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T13:33Z,"not as if also.. i removing a signiture and put my own on.. 

i just providing the episode as it wasnt on here

clear and simple.. 

no egos no rules just tv"
,reb754,2012-03-28T20:58Z,"trialNerror hit the nail on the head on this conversation.  

psspss, you clearly need to hear from the other side of the argument as to why this is not only bad form, but detrimental to P2P.  You see, I was a indepenent capper, did it for nearly a decade, so a lot of people know me by my tag.

Removing the capping tags from filenames is tantamount to disrespecting the person (capper) who took the time to capture, edit, encode and upload these files.  It has nothing to do with ego, it's simply respect.  This is how you can show it by not defacing the filenames.

No one cares how you decide to organize your files on your computer for your own use, however please do not redistribute them by defacing someone elses efforts.  If you capture and encode your own stuff, by all means, label them as crazy as you'd like.  That's your perogative.

You say you hate logos?  You DO realize why cappers have to resort to that?  It is because of people like you, doing what you do.  That's just one consequence.  Another consequence is them stopping altogether or greatly delaying their releases.  I am in the stopped camp.  For various reasons, I decided to retire from the 50+ episodes I released on an average week.  However the disrespect from the minority in the P2P community (lets face face it, MOST of the P2P community is respectful and fantastic), is certainly one of the nails that helped seal the coffin.

Now you can cry ego all you want to try and justify this OCD inclination about having to rename filenames, but it doesn't make it accurate.  In the P2P world, all you really have is your reputation, and when you distribute files, that reputation comes down to a name.

Trust me, you aren't a one man team, I see you taking credit for finding the episodes everyone else missed.  Rest assured, you are FAR from alone.  And now you may have to search a whole lot harder.

Respect is a simple concept.  You want to keep it clear and simple?  It already is clear and simple without people like you obsessed about stripping filenames.

The scene will keep going no matter what, but the indie cappers are the heart of reality TV, I advocate for ALL of them.  Please respect them.  Or you are very likely to lose them.

As a side note, I have really no interest in a debate on this, but it's evident you really do need to hear from someone who represents what you so clearly despise although you seem more than happy to take advantage of everything we (cappers) put out there.   It's quite the oxymoron."
