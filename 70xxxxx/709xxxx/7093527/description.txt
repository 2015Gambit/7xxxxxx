________________________________________

    Although several of his hits are featured -- including "Honky Tonk Man,"
    "The Woman I Need," and "All Grown Up" -- most of Rockin' Rollin' Johnny
    Horton is comprised of obscurities, culled from his early career. The
    album veers between is rockabilly experiments and honky tonk, and the
    entire CD is highly enjoyable compilation for fans of his harder-edged
    music, even though a handful of tracks haven't aged particularly well.
