but to those of you who hit and run and do not seed back
may you have a fiery death
350 seeds and 350 peers turns into 340 seeds and 275 peers.... thats 75 people who just hit and run and do not seed back, i have been downloading this for over 12 hours now and its still not done...i think torrents should be given out on a share ratio priority, where those with a higher share ratio of 1.0 or more get the torrent first and those who hit and run with a ratio of .5 or lower should wait at the back of the line."

you should try private trackers then.
They have that system.
But it's not perfect.
First you get everything late , cracks , games...
And I use a fiber connection.
Here in Turkey they have limit on uploads. First of all My connection is 50 mpbs down / 5 mbps up. If my total upload reaches 50 gigabytes my connection will be reduced to 1 mbps down / 512 kb up , and to be honest i can't live with that kind of broadband for a month.
Same goes for download , but download has 250 gb limit.
So Down and Ups are not seperate when you break your limit in either of them you're screwed for the month.
I'm sorry guys if there wasn't something like this i would seed my ass off.
I'm still gonna seed but not that much sorry."
