Note:

Best played on VLC Media Player.

Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users).

Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is (Find it on TPB itself) coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic.

Any requests? Let me know.

I would appreciate it if you could leave feedback as comments.

This time, instead of our typical 320 kbps/CBR MP3 Audio file I have included an ipod/iphone/ipad friendly format that is M4A with lesser size but something which can give the former a challenge when it comes to quality, take a look and give in your most valuable suggestions or state if I should get back to uploading 320 kbps MP3. 

Times are changing and its about time we incorporate new technology and lets kiss good bye the ones that served us earlier, we had a great run back then with it but now its time for us to move on. :)
