               Degrassi | s11e35 | Can't Tell Me Nothing, part 2

With a stressful day at school, Katie takes her mother's codeine during the day, despite sister Maya's warnings. Katie's knee gets too warn out before the soccer tryouts, and she requires surgery and recovery before being able to play again. After ex-boyfriend K.C. overhears Jenna's song about him, he writes a poem making Jenna's character a monster. Jenna keeps her song about how she is over K.C., and it is widely received well. Also at the coffee house, Tristan decides to sing without the Tori-Zig couple, but the two decide they will stick together, and Tristan does not get booed off the stage.
