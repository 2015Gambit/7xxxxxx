Movie Review: " Yaar" is a psychological thriller with decent performances from the entire cast. Children going missing are commonly heard, but this one takes it a step ahead with unborn children being abducted from wombs. Strange as it may, the movie leaves you convinced that such acts are a possibility provided you have some one as scheming as Elango.
