From my comment at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7073332/Countdown_with_Keith_Olbermann__2012-03-02_H.264_AAC_MP4 :
''There was no 3/5 CWKO program. ... 3/6 will have a special 3-hour CWKO Super Tuesday coverage program, but I will not be posting it. By the time I finally got it uploaded, it wouldn't be news...it would be ""olds,"" and much would likely have changed in terms of election results. ... My next CWKO post will be on 3/7.''

From my comment at http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7088055/Countdown_with_Keith_Olbermann__2012-03-08_H.264_AAC_MP4 :
''Once again, no Countdown tonight (3/9). Instead, it's a 2-hour-long TYT. ... Keith said nothing on last night's program about there not being a program tonight.''
