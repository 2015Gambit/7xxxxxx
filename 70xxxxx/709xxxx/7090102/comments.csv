,Happy_In_Kaohsiung,2012-03-10T13:03Z,I appreciate the upload but don't understand why .mkv and not.avi?Can't play these on my dvd player or PS3.

I would not pay out of principle,you haven't the talent to make music or film so why should you make money out of it?I'd rather actually pay full price than pay people making money off other peoples talent."

This is not the spirit of PB!"
