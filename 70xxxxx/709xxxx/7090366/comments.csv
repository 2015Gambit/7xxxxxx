[T],trialNerror,2012-03-11T00:58Z,"Even though I've been saying it for a few months now I guess I have to keep on saying it - I am no longer doing XviD videos.

XviD has become inferior to x264.  XviD is a waste of space and lack of quality.

There is ONLY ONE release I do which is XviD and that is the Disappeared season currently airing. I'm only doing that in XviD because the season began last year before this x264 transition.

Wanna know something neat?  The MKV's of mine will actually stream from PC to the X360 or PS3 without any converting.  Somehow tNe MKV's will do that and scene MKV's will not.

*shrugs shoulders*  Whatever."

,claytona57,2012-03-14T03:37Z,"Hey tNr, I been dl'ing all of your uploads of GA since you started and I gotta say, keep up with the great work that your doing.  

I would rather have x264 over XviD anyday. At least your uploads will play on all of my devices and are in excellent quality.

And Oh I have been reading the other users comments for the past couple of weeks about your uploads and I gotta say, to the hell with them. x264 is the way to go"
