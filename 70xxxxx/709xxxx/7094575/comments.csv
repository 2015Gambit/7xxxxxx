,laxgod01,2012-03-12T23:01Z,"hey man ! i've downloaded most of this season from you, but I havent been able to download the last 2 !! thr used to be a link under the magnet link that said get this file or something like that, but now it says ""The problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent clients ! "" ..what gives !!!??"
,snostorm8,2012-03-12T23:26Z,"downloaded and clicked the link, will seed till next weeks episode as always :)"
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-13T00:26Z,"@laxgod01

I'm not entirely sure what you mean but click where it says ""GET THIS TORRENT"" with the little magnet icon next to it.It should open right up into your torrent client.

Also i'm not sure what client you are using but i have heard that the newer Version(s) of uTorrent doesn't work well with magnet links.

@snostorm8

Thank you it is much appreciated :)"
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-13T00:28Z,"P.S:
