,nader704,2012-03-24T11:28Z,hey thx...just need more tips about installing it...so i dont need to extract anything?
,amaedict,2012-03-24T15:02Z,"nope nothing. just install, create account ( its free ) and play. there is a shortcut on your desktop after you installed."
,grangeke,2012-03-31T00:20Z,"Wow thanks for this!
I tried downloading the installer from the website itself but for some reason it does nothing anymor after running the installer and after it starts unpacking the installer.msi."
,grangeke,2012-04-02T17:03Z,"forget about my message, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!

You can use whatever login name you want and if you type sjkoqgnozeig and pass oazifhnzo첫iefh
It still logs you in so this is a hijack for accounts."
,amaedict,2012-04-03T07:42Z,"Please dont talk shit.

there is anothing wrong with this download, it works 100%.

Go troll somewhere else please !"
,grangeke,2012-04-05T13:57Z,"I'm not trolling or makign things up.

I fully downloaded this and even seeded and when i noticed some mistakes i logged out and logged in by typing a random name and password.

Guess what, it logged that account in!"
,amaedict,2012-04-06T21:21Z,"O please. You must be the only one in the world with that problem then...

This client works 100% there is NOTHING wrong with it.

Please go troll somewhere else."
,grangeke,2012-04-08T23:17Z,"We'll see.

Anyone else that completes this download do not create any account and you'll see your account 'existing' with this download."
,accius21,2012-04-10T21:59Z,"hmm just finished and noticed something weird the game install in:
''C:Program Files (x86)NCSoftAion 2.7.0.2'' instead 
''C:Program Files (x86)NCSoftAion''

have played the game before so i know where should be installed. will check with another account so can know if is some sort of hack or not"
,accius21,2012-04-10T23:00Z,"ok guys THIS IS NOT THE RETAIL AION SERVER, this is ZAION a private server, most of files seems untouched though to use retail server just rename the game folder to Aion then delete all things related to zaion and repair with NCsoft launcher, it worked for me"
,grangeke,2012-04-12T18:10Z,Told you all it was a hijack for accounts.
,Sno0dl3z,2012-04-20T08:53Z,"I must of tried downloading it for days with it freezing like 10 times but with this just removed the Zaoin part, updated it & now I can finally play. ^L^  Thanks."
,viniciusz,2012-06-07T01:11Z,"Hi guys, I wonder if you know where to find the torrent client from NCsoft Aion updated, I can download this aion 2.7.0.2 and then upgrade it with the NCsoft launcher?"
,htshpst,2012-06-22T01:31Z,Deciding whether to DL or not.. are you guys saying that I can delete the Zaion related files and be able to play normal intl aion?
,arkanjo90,2012-06-23T03:55Z,Sure you can. Just delete all the zaion related files and update the game with the Ncsoft launcher.
,htshpst,2012-06-26T15:44Z,"Would somebody please tell me which files should I remove in order to be able to play the international server?

and how to update it with the Ncsoft launcher?

Excuse my ignorance."
,Dr.Awesome123,2012-07-06T14:31Z,How to instal this plz help me 
,Brackenburg,2012-07-27T21:59Z,"I've played on private servers before.
Oftentimes you can put it a random login/password and you will get in, but you won't go anywhere from there.
grangeke, this is probably not a hijack. If the NCsoft client can pick up the installation, then there's nothing to worry about even because you login through the NCsoft client and not through the game window now.

Just delete all files related to Zaion and it'll install normally.

I will have to bash the poster because it says these files are untouched when obviously they're not."
