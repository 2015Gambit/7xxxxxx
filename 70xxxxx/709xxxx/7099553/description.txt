This is a website introducing new linux users and old to HUminity and HUMANity, linux remasters based on Unity-linux with an Enlightenment e17 desktop with Ecomorph. It uses lower resources than some of the other desktop managers, and has some beautiful themes available.
Unity is a very nice linux distro imho which is why I chose it, and reasonably user friendly for new linux users, it has a helpful forum and irc chat channel if you need help, or just wish to introduce yourself, or make any comments.
