Anyway all info is at That page will always have the latest info on the torrent. There is also a direct link if required. Ok TPB wont let me post a link now. Brilliant

,Bran1991,2012-03-12T05:17Z,"Love these torrents!!! I have no idea what it would take but could you possibly do a torrent for a cracked technic pack launcher? just Single player would be fine. I love the mods that are in it. Get back to me when you have a chance please!!

Thanks, 
Bran"
