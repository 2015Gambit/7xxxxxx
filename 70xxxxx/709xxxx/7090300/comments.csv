[T],tr108,2012-03-15T14:18Z,"afranc, you're welcome.

And yes, constant quality on HandBrake. I usually run a few different encodes (CQ of 22, 21, +/- some advanced options), then select the best visual quality vs. file size ratio encode. If the source is good, it typically ends up being the 22 w advanced options encode."
