,thisispurx,2012-03-13T17:47Z,"Going to DL Dance Academy right now..never heard of it before I hope it's as good as Dance Moms and I'll have a new weekly series to watch!!

Thanks!!"
,geeteebee,2012-03-14T01:16Z,"I'm D/Ling Dance Academy now.  Hope it is good.  Thanks for your efforts.  Can't wait for Miami.  Any format you can do is better than the alternative, nothing.  You are great."
,whmxtra,2012-03-15T00:04Z,"Dance Academy is an Australian drama about a girl going to the ballet academy and what not.

Sounds boring but it's not. If anyone needs it I have all of season 1 as well so I can upload a torrent of that at some point if the other torrents for it on here don't work."
,whmxtra,2012-03-15T00:10Z,"Episode 10 of Dance Moms now up: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7103291/Dance.Moms.S02E10.flv

No HQ till Saturday but still very watchable"
