Thanks for the upload - Unfortunately for me it doesn't work with a legit Railworks 3.
Do you have East Coast by Creative Rail which should work with a legit version?"

,sharp09,2012-03-18T18:56Z,Thanks for your effort but it doesn't work for me and it's the same with most of your other torrents! None of them are .rwp or .rpk so they can't be recognized by railworks!
