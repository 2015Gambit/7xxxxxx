Hotkey Editor Information

This trainer presents an new feature you can acces by clicking the hotkeys
button
With the RazorDOX Hotkey Editor that pops up you can change the hotkeys
used by the trainer. Every trainer will be having pre defined hotkeys
which are listed in the Ingame hotkeys section below
You can either choose to keep these hotkeys and simply play the game with
these pre defined hotkeys or you click the hotkeys button to change the
hotkeys used by the trainer. A small example on how to do this based
on one hotkey from the ingame hotkeys section below:

1 NUMPAD1 Toggle Infinite Health

Now in the hotkeys dialogbox you will see this hotkey as Opt.01
Where Opt.01 points to the option count from the ingame hotkey
list below

Now if you want to change the hotkey you simply click on the
editbox containing the hotkey and press your desired hotkey
Now click on the save hotkeys button to save your user defined
hotkeys. Now start the game and enjoy!!

1 - Run As Admin
2 - Once it runs, change the hot keys in the trainer. Many are shared with game features so I picked the ones I wanted to use, then hit the others with the BACKSPACE key so it says NONE.
3 - Run game and once in the game, escape out, hit F12...should hear tone...then go back into game and use as desired.

*To the critics of trainers...nobody asked for your opinions. Some of us just like to have fun in extreme ways. It is a game and anyone can play it any fucking way they choose. THAT IS HOW GAMES ARE MEANT TO BE PLAYED."
