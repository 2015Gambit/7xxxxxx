,ap2882,2012-04-04T03:36Z,What fucktard thought it would be a good idea to upload a 9 gig documentary?

Using newest version of VLC player."
,vatel88,2012-07-17T20:44Z,NVM apparently the video isnt choppy. But be fore warned for some reason playing Star Trek online while watching this movie causes the movie to start skipping the video. strangely no other game has made it do it lol!
