After quitting Granny's diner and with her self-

it is in life that she's good at; and Emma 
continues questioning David about the 
disappearance - and possible murder - of 
Kathryn. Meanwhile, in the fairytale land that 
was, Red Riding Hood yearns to run away with her 
true love. But she, along with her fellow 
townspeople, are virtual prisoners when a 
bloodthirsty wolf continues on its relentless 
killing spree.
