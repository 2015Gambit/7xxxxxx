PurgeIE Pro
PurgeIE is a program for removing your surfing tracks from your computer.  Internet Explorer keeps a lot of information that can reveal your surfing habits.  This includes a history of each site you have visited in addition to a copy of each of the Webpages.

PurgeIE optionally displays a list of the items it deletes and provides a 'Preview' function to let you determine the items that would be deleted by the 'Purge' function.

PurgeIE frees up wasted space on your HardDrive.  PurgeIE  functions without requiring you to restart your computer.

PurgeIE was initially released in February, 1999, and has become the utility that newer software products try to imitate.  PurgeIE now has registered users in over 55 countries.

PurgeIE Pro is the professional edition of PurgeIE.

In addition to the features in PurgeIE, PurgeIE Pro includes Secure Erase and supports Plugins.
  
Although several Plugins are distributed with PurgeIE Pro,  a separate program is available for you to create your own Plugins to delete files, folders and Registry entries.
