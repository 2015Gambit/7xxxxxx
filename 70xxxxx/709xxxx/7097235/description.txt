The sixth album in the Twilight Sessions series.

Like the first five volumes, this is an album of completely improvised, live ambient music.

Each piece starts as a blank canvas.

The music is built around a long, slowly decaying loop. Notes are added from synths, guitar, voice and clarinet and over time, they built into grand, atmospheric soundscapes.

Sometimes, however, I forget to press record when something wonderful is created. On these occasions, I can only capture the loop that has already been created. This is the reason that three of the tracks on this album are unusually short.
