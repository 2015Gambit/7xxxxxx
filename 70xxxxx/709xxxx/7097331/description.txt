Couple notes people.

1. This is not my rip, credit to whomever did this, I just happened to find it so I'm uploading for those that have been waiting 1 1/2 years for this lol.

2. There's some asian subtitle and logo stuff that is a bit in the way here and there but it is an HD rip in English and very watchable so will do till my own sources can get it to me and I can make a cleaner rip without the subtitles etc.
