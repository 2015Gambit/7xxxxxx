,hisperiandeathhorse,2012-03-10T17:37Z,Thanks for the upload! If you could please add the Mass Effect 3 - Trainer 1.1.5427.4 (ORIGIN RETAIL) version it would be much appreciated. Your version does not work with origin.
,Ximmortal,2012-03-10T21:17Z,@hisperiandeathhorse i'll try to get that trainer ass soon as possible 
,RMJ113,2012-03-10T21:23Z,"Origin will not allow trainers

""CHEATING "" is forbidin

copy your game to desktop and use the RELOADED crack in that , then use use the trainers!"
,RMJ113,2012-03-10T21:24Z,good idea to make a back up of game saves!
,Pwntatochips,2012-03-11T05:22Z,Does this trainer work with keeping the upgrade points after exiting the game? The one by HeroMaster doesn't.
