MisterMusic Show 192 [01:59:35] mp3

On this week's show new music from The Shins, Norah Jones with Danger Mouse,Violens, and Kaiser Chiefs.
Plus we revisit 1976, for a song that was originally the B-side of the single,but later became the biggest hit on the album for the group-in the 'Oldie of the Week'.

Blending new indie and alternative music with classic hits from the past, it's the MisterMusic Show.


Heard weekly on Rock XS Radio [rockxsDOTcom] (check the DJ schedule for broadcast times)
