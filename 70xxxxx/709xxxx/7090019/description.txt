This is a DVD iso of the Star Wars Holiday Special. The video quality is not great, as it is taken from existing freely available sources, however the main advantage of this format is this: it has chapter markers.

If you haven't seen the Star Wars Holiday Special, you can't understand how important this is. Watching it from beginning to end or searching for anything particular is a brain-melting exercise. I am the one who put in the chapter markers, and it very nearly destroyed me.

Other advantages of this format include the ability to easily burn it to disc and watch it gathered around the TV with the whole family - something I strongly advise against.

Also, once you've got it on disc you can easily gift it to people whom you love and/or want to punish.

Enjoy!
