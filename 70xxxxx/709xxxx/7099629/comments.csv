,DMWill,2012-03-13T19:49Z,thanks again for the Mexico Rally.  americans like me really appreciate it :D
,UAofE,2012-03-13T23:02Z,"Agent4747, if you want a smaller file download the shitty SD version."
,3Dazz,2012-03-14T00:47Z,"If there was a smaller version of this file, I think there would'nt be any comments regarding this files size. My comment is why was there only small files for day 1 + 2, but day 3 is in 720? I will most likely get this file as we dont get WRC in Aus this year."
,123-abc,2012-03-14T01:25Z,thanks man - I'd have to wait for the end of year review dvd to see the wrc if it wasnt for your uploads!
,3Dazz,2012-03-14T02:08Z,"Im sure you all know this, full coverage is available to watch on youtube. Or if you want to download a copy, use a youtube downloader."
,Agent4747,2012-03-14T17:47Z,Thank you 3Dazz. UAofE is obviously pretty retarded...
