,scorpionhell,2012-03-13T03:36Z,not sure about what actually airs on the networks... but by release date.. this was episode 8... & somehow last week the 2 episode special was 9 & 10... it took me awhile 2 figure it out.. hope it helps... but ettv KNOWS exactly what he's doing... sooo just trust him... haa... ;)

This is the episode that should have aired a few weeks ago when the Daytona 500 NASCAR race was rained out on Sunday and they aired the race on Monday evening when Alcatraz normally airs."
