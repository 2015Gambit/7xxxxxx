,geolittle,2012-03-13T15:18Z,Seeding is a problem every month. I think there are some communication issues in that part of the world. Patients is a virtue. Especially for the great playlists these guys put out each month. I'd be more than happy to seed on my 30mb line if a direct transfer is possible.
,one_of_7.500.000.000,2012-03-13T22:39Z,"I do this every month on my 4 MB line each month and my playlist is even bigger. It takes me about seven hours to find about 30 seeds. I think somebody has the idee to press pause in order to force sharing. Patience ok, but more than three days?"
,The_Barman,2012-03-16T02:54Z,Say five days already. Last month I just ignored the incomplete songs. This time it's a lot more. A monthly FRESH nuisance.
,bored.of.waiting.6days,2012-03-16T02:58Z,"6 days and still stuck at 97% - pathetic. Why spend so much time listening and sorting and creating great playlists - if you not going to seed them fully? Navigatorz has introduced me to some great music and bands, and there's CD's on my shelf that your playlist has put there. But not seeding your own playlist is (fill in your own word of frustation here)"
,wa.wa.wah,2012-03-16T21:21Z,"Patience my ass. I've been stuck at 97% for DAYS. 
This is straight up negligence. 


Please seed! For the love of cthulhu, PLEASE!!! "
