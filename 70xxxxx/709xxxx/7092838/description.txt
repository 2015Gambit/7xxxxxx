Alps touchpad driver from HP (August 2011) with modified INF file to turn off annoying scrolling icons, show two finger scrolling, zoom, circular scrolling, pinch, and flick(back and forward) options under mouse.

Experimented with a thousand different Alps drivers from dating all the way back to 2008, this one seems to be by far the best.

Personally I prefer to turn the pinch to zoom off and enable the left side of my trackpad for zooming in and out on my VAIO SA3 but maybe its a hardware issue with my specific laptop.

This is my first torrent so feedback would be appreciated.

Enjoy!
