Actually, all you need are the Hebrew Bible, the various (and contradictory) versions of the Christian Bibles, and the Qu'ran.  More people have been jailed, tortured, and murdered in the name of religion - defense of one god or another than by all of the others mentioned in the description. 

""Man is the religious animal. He is the only religious animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion--several of them. He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight.""

[V],joshua13,2012-03-26T02:20Z,"Really blue son? People have often killed for religion, nationalism, power, wealth and much more but if you  think religion is #1 you are repeating an old myth (or lie). Have you never heard of Hitler's 6 million and the 50-70 million killed in WWII? Millions more maimed, tortured, imprisoned? Have you never heard of Stalin who beat hitlers 6m? The Khmer Rouge? The Chinese ""Cultural Revolution?"" And that is just a part of the 20th century's toll, my friend. Religion had little or nothing to do the great majority of human killing and cruelty - it just gets the press because it seems contrary to sense."

,spopes232,2012-08-17T10:45Z,I don't think books screw up the world. The interpretation that people make of books is what screws up the world.
