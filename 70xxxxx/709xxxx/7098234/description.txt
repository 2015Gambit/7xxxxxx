Game information:

 Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flight simulation set in a world
 war I+II scenario. During the 7 campaigns the player has to fly and fight
 through over 48 missions. Before taking off, the player can choose between
 different aircrafts, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Within
 the missions the player gets different objectives like patrolling
 sneaking, hit & run, bombing and escorting. Objectives are presented as
 dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player can
 upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes easier, have
 more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose
 between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the
 game easier to control, while the second one gives more options to control
 the aircraft. Beside the campaign the game also features several
 multiplayer modes, local and via internet for up to four players
