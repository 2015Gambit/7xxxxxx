Come on people, seed instead of just leeching! "
,Volkaru,2012-04-16T11:14Z,"The game installed and is running perfectly, but I haven't figured out how to get the DLC working, I ran the giveme2entitlements.exe right after installation, and then I loaded up the game (without being connected to the internet, just incase.) and after playing for a little while, I noticed that I have none of the DLC. I closed the game, made sure everything was installed correctly, ran the entitlement exe again just in case, and still nothing. Is there a step I'm missing? Any help is appreciated, other than that absolutely loving this torrent!"
,Volkaru,2012-04-16T11:50Z,"Nevermind, a restart after the first time, deleting the entitlement file in my documents, then running the exe again, then playing the game fixed it. Woo!"

------------------

Note:- For people who are receiving the following error message ""Could not get adapter entropy"" or,
the giveme2entitlements/MassEffect2DLCUnlocker keeps crashing,
you should have a LAN card on your PC that is enabled but not plugged in,
& block the mass effect files in your firewall. 

You can't have your onboard enbabled either!!!
The DLCs and crack exes worked fine right after I installed a LAN card.



Alternate Loader (which is included in the install folder but can be found here)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found this program on google giving me an alternative in activating Mass Effect's DLC's because the program
 ""giveme2entitlements_v2.exe"" doesn't work for me as for a internet connection issue.
It allows the user to select the network they currently use as in my case.

This program is not mine!

Instruction: (What I did)

1.)Download the program (in google if you don't trust this)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6334605/Mass_Effect_2_alternate_activator_(DLC)

2.)open and then select your network (It will create a file named ""BioPersistentEntitlementCache"" 
located in my case in *...\User\Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect 2\BIOGame\Config\...)

3.)done

P.S. If you used the program ""giveme2entitlements_v2.exe prior into using this,do delete the file 
""BioPersistentEntitlementCache"" first


Authentication errors

can be fixed with the above."
,dafaq6493,2012-05-05T03:30Z,hey i was just wondering is it possible to ONLY install the DLC or do you have to install the game as well?
,delamortis,2012-05-23T08:23Z,"I have this very odd problem that occurred regularly no matter how many times I start a new game. The game works fine for long times then at some random points access to Galaxy map is impossible. You see that flashy blue square that requires you to click space to interact with it, and it changes color as if it was clicked, but it never opens and I have to start a new game all over again since reloading never fix it. Any help for that or a crack made to fix it?"
,codexius2,2012-05-29T05:52Z,does this include 1.02 patch?
,luigginote,2012-09-10T18:12Z,"Sorry,
I have 2 questions:
Every time you start the game you need to unplug the internet to get the dlc working?
When its the first time you notice the DLC are working?
Please, answer me!"
