┬║ FEMFAT offers a complete solution for fatigue engineers. It 
┬║ covers all fatigue aspects of ground vehicles and other 
┬║ machinery.
┬║          
┬║ Assessment can be made for all ranges of strength as 
┬║ durability (infinite life), finite life and static 
┬║ strength. FEMFAT can easiliy fit into an existing CAE-
┬║ process because a multitude of FEA-interfaces and load-time-
┬║ data interfaces are provided together with a comprehensive 
┬║ material data base. Fatigue analysis can be performed for 
┬║ cast and machined components but also for joints like seam 
┬║ welds, spot welds and self piercing rivets.
┬║          
┬║ FEMFAT is split up in several modules to reflect the 
┬║ requirements for different fields of application. 
┬║ Additionally to the fatigue analysis modules there is a 
┬║ range of tools for related topics like friction bearings, 
┬║ pre- and postprocessing for acoustic simulation and 
┬║ submodeling/data mapping.
┬║          
┬║ For test engineers we provide an extra tool which covers 
┬║ all kind of signal processing, cycle counting including 
┬║ data compression tasks. Another advanced feature is to 
┬║ automatically perform virtual iteration for MBS-models to 
┬║ generate valuable load spectra
