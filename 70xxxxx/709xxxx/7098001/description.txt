This is an eight part Australian documentry set in a Sydney Emergency Room.

Parts 1&2 have already been posted by TV Team.

After weeks of searching I have aquired parts 3-6 which I have now posted.

Part 6 was only aired on 9/3/2012. When parts 7&8 become available I will endevor to get them to you.

Please bear with me as I am sixty years of age and these are my first attempts at uploading, although I have downloading for years.

Than you, it is nice to be able to give something back.
