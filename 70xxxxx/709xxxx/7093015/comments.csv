OMG, check the portofolio of the director

,IHadACat,2012-03-11T23:37Z,"A-10, V-9, M-3

Despite some half decent acting, this film is indeed low budget. I've seen better CGI on Nintendo 64, and that isn't an exaggeration. I'm an easy-going critic, but this wasn't worth my time.

Regardless, thanks for the upload LegendET!"

,MVC78,2012-03-12T19:40Z,"ATTENTIONE! 

This is NOT one of the TWO Snow White movies coming out this year. 

This is direct-to-DVD dreck that is trying to cash in on the Snow White phenom of 2012 and not worth your time! 

It's here for FOOLS who do not read the comments before they rush to download something. Not that any of you are FOOLS, but it's amazing this is on the first page of TPB"
,nybergarn,2012-03-12T20:46Z,"As someone metioned this is NOT one of the big snow white movies coming out this year, I thought it was ""Snow white and the huntsman"" which is released in june this year.. 

conclussion:

VIDEO: decent, way to bright to bring out the movie-feeling for me, the walls are litteraly WHITE with extrem reflection in the camera when it was filmed....

SOUND: nothibng to complain about really, poor soundeffects but nothing the uploader couldv changed.

MOVIE: straightforward,shitty effects, the CGI was outdated long ago and the plot are horrifying, they actually try to reach climax TWICE in the movie..."
,cirith151,2012-03-12T22:42Z,Glad I read the comments.  A good lesson to those who don't. Haha

,JihadJake,2012-03-13T03:38Z,"Hey guys just a warning this movie is by the infamously bad production company called The Asylm. They made such movies as Titanic 2, Snakes on a Train, Paranormal Entity and of course the Megashark series

good quality though a/v 10/10"

,smidio,2012-03-13T07:38Z,Why are people making movies like this. It is a waste of money and time. Although very very little money was used for this disaster movie. DO NOT DOWNLOAD

,gumamela,2012-03-13T11:00Z,"Fuck. i should have researched the title of the movie first before downloading. who would have thought there will be 3 versions of snow white this year!?!? 

i hate that i had to suffer the slow download (44hrs). imagine my anticipation, only to be disapointed bigtime. grrrrr!

,Big_Mick,2012-03-16T17:17Z,"should NOT be on the top 100, this movie is horrible, not even sci fi channel worthy, and they make some pretty bad movies. video and audio quality are tens, the movie is a 1 and that is only cause snow white is pretty hott."
,Tee_12,2012-03-16T18:47Z,nice print...!
,MVC78,2012-03-16T22:07Z,"ATTENTION! ACHTUNG! 

This movie is NOT one of the blockbuster Snow White movies to be released in theaters later this year! It does NOT star Julia Roberts or Charlize Theron. 

It is a direct-to-DVD movie trying to cash in on the Snow White blitzkrieg and apparently 4000 downloaders have not read the comment section. 

Thank you to the uploader, but the lack of info on this movie is curious. "
,iamhelix,2012-03-17T07:53Z,"all you idoits who downloaded this thinking its something else are retarded, its pretty c;ear what it is from the title."

,haydn70ac,2012-03-29T15:29Z,Hey is this the one with Halle Berry as 'Snow White'?

,SquareEggs,2012-04-16T05:26Z,"To any and/or all of you who downloaded this, b4 realizing you were fooled, just take it as a lesson learned, and try not to let 'The Asylum' fkers fool u again.

Not sure if I can post a link in this comment, so if this link doesn't work, then just search wiki for  'The Asylum'. It's a film studio that makes 'Mockbusters'.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum

As far as I can tell, they don't even try to make a good movie. It seems that their only goal is to make a cheap ass movie, and then try to fool enough ppl so that they can make a profit. lol. fkers.

They got me twice, last year. 1st time was
'Battle Los Angeles' (released March 11)

The Asylum version: 
'Battle of Los Angeles' (released March 12)

Bastards tricked me with 11/11/11 also. Can't remember which was which, but one movie was titled 11-11-11, & the other was 11/11/11.

Just try to be smarter than me, and don't let em fool you a 2nd time lol. "
