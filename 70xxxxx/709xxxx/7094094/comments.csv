,Blueoctober712,2012-03-12T00:43Z,I was there. Windham wins and stewart takes second. What are the odds that villi doesnt make the main and Stewart closes in on the points big time!!
,gkc135,2012-03-12T02:08Z,"slugzor & Blueoctober712: Are you guys fucking retarded? Thanks very much for fucking up this race for me and anyone else who reads the comments.

slicknick: you are the man. THANK YOU yet again"
,slicknick610,2012-03-12T02:46Z,I think slugzor was just rooting for Kdub. But blueoctober is wrong anyway but he is just being an asshole.
,Blueoctober712,2012-03-12T03:44Z,Dont lie Slick nick!! its true
,sanga77,2012-03-12T14:06Z,"HI I cant seem to get the torrent to work? its been like this for about two weeks. any help please?
using a mac and safari.

even older torrent that Ive already have now seem to have lost the download arrow.."
,slugzor,2012-03-15T12:54Z,"Blueoctober is just trolling, and I said""K-dub FTW"" just because he is always good in mud.I don't know the results before I download, and because of ppl like blueoctober I don't read comments before I watch the race.Would recomend the same to you all so you dont rage about the trolls."
,Raikzz,2012-03-18T18:37Z,Where's Round 11 ? :(
,ninjakecil,2012-03-20T17:45Z,"@sanga77
Use uTorrent, Vuze, BitTorrent or any client that supports magnet links. From now on, any torrent with active user above 10 will only have magnet link, no .torrent file to download.

@slicknick Thanks. Cheers m8."
