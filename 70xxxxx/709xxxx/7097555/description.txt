There are 3 versions of this. 									

												

The file GATOR is the original AAC and the other two are AC3. 					

												

One being just a remux with AC3 and the other a recompression attempt to make a better fit 

for 16x9 TV. 											

	                                                                                  

It is not quite true 16x9 as a few pixels are missing from each side but IMHO it looks 

better than the 960x720	WHICH IS NOT A 16X9.							

											

Common resolutions for 16:9 are 640x360, 854x480, 960x540, 1024×576, 1280×720, 1366×768, 

1600×900, 1920×1080, 2048x1152, 2560×1440, 3840×2160 and 4096x2304.

1080p (Full HD) is 1920×1080, while 720p (HD) is 1280×720.
