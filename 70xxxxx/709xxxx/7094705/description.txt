Often those they abuse are only vaguely aware of what is happening to them. In this eye-opening book, you'll also discover * four reasons why victims have a hard time leaving abusie relationships, * power tactics manipulative people use to push their own agendas and justify their behavior, * ways to redefine the rules of engagement between you and the abuser, * how to spot potential weaknesses in your character that can set you up for manipulation, * 2 tools for personal empowerment to help you maintain greater strength in all relationships, and much more.
