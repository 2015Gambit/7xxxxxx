,Baka345,2012-03-26T18:04Z,"I have auwful sound lugs in plot-locations - background ambient is off but each step of character makes it to on for less than a second. Sometimes there is no sond from characters in dialogs. Also, on a planet, where you get Liara, there were no textures in the shadowed places on the surface of the planet. And i have a fieling that some dialogs of citisens are cuted out. Though in general it works fine, but still i would not recomend this one."
,Nerd28,2012-03-27T16:48Z,This shit frequently hangs and may corrupt save files (all of them at once). Never use this bent pack.
,Nerd28,2012-03-27T17:14Z,"Addition: Had a look in logs what realy corrupts - it's character's profile. So you still may to make new (and same) character and use previous save games. Another hint, - switching off internet connection during the game (plus maybe lowing graphics quality) reduces hangs."

I have never uploaded a Torrent before & would like some help please, WHICH I would believe be of benefit to all that have had problems getting the DLC content to work!!!!

After & I say many hours off screwing around with downlods & stuff, reading every forum I could get my eyes too I finally have got everything to work!!!! Again everything to work!!!!

Yes ""Bring Down The Sky""
Yes ""Pinnacle Station"" Which I might just say here that I have the Name ""Pinnacle Station"" in my DLC Content box when I access it!!!! Wicked :)

No ERRORS Galaxy Map, Overheating,Saves etc etc To be honest Iv thrashed the Game flawlessly several times now to level 60 & have imported it to ME2 no problems at all :-)

Im working on the ME2 & DLC install process at the moment as I have for this one!!!!
Which of part is in the above post :)

Iv written a Install guide for me & for even a first user to understand as I might be a Qualified Tech but others arn't Aye :)

 So If anyone is interested in helping me sort out my first torrent & take it off my hansds as I can't hoste it from here then email me Slider-69-@hotmail.com

 Many Thanks to all the tirless work & effort the uploaders do to bring us which I have found for the most part excellent torrents (for the ones I trust :))"
,GuitarrAddictt,2012-05-12T03:58Z,"I have a problem.

I install the game with no problems. But when i'm trying to launch the game nothing happens.. nothing at all.. the computer just thinks a bit.. and then nothing happens.

Help would be appreciated. :)"

,afakgfm,2012-07-09T16:27Z,"Make sure to use DAEMON Tools (a free program used to mount disks) to install and play it. I haven't done it yet, but the torrent sounds promising enough."
