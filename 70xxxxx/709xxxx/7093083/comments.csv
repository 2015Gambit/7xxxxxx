,inkyon,2012-03-11T09:21Z,know where to find english subtitle for it?
,pteosmium,2012-03-12T00:40Z,"Good quality! H264, 5.1 AC3.  Totally pointless to RAR video files.  You can't compress them. Seriously.  Just makes it harder to manage files.

Westhwood, you just need an updated client compatible with magnet links."
,FrostyWinnipeg,2012-03-12T04:54Z,More then likely he did not RAR it but downloaded it from a newsgroup that way. I agree to RAR is unimportant but its tough to disagree with an uploader.

Don't know why some have problem downloading.
No problem to unpack either.
Thanks for the upload"
,tufgong,2012-03-12T19:53Z,"westhwood - you are a fucking moron, how many of these torrents about ""Game Change"" are you going to post your moronic words..."
,fredskidoo,2012-03-13T08:11Z,"So where was this one from? - what language is it in?  I only ask because HBO premiered this on the 10th of March - in English. I would like to find a non-subbed, spoken English version of this with the reported high bitrate and resolution (I'm assuming) that this one has. "
,stegman,2012-03-13T18:31Z,"@fredskidoo,
Are you related to westhwood by any chance?
Maybe he's your long lost twin brother you thought you never had? 
Congrats, btw. I'm happy for you both. :-)

I see you're new to p2p world, so:
For the last decade almost EVERY rip of any major US TV-show was followed by a fan-created, handmade english subs. It's nothing new.
Prepare to get your mind blown:
