dehou, I'm stuck at 99.9% on your U2 Part 9 Torrent. I need just 2 MB more. Any chance you could seed for a while please.

beaujoulais, did you see my Garbage torrent that you asked for?
"
,beaujoulais,2012-03-13T08:00Z,"Hi jumpingphil, communication via comments is a little problematic. To you question: Yes, the Garbage live track from ""the trick is to keep breathing"" is fantastic - ""the trick is to keep on seeding"". cu, beaujoulais  ;-)"
,dehou,2012-03-14T03:08Z,"thanks!!

@jumpingphil: no problem at all, iÂ´m always checking my torrents and if they die (it happens all the time) i re-seed"
,jumpingphil,2012-03-14T17:46Z,"@ Dehou, I have it in full now, thank you very much."
