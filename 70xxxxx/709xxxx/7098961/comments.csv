Fuck you all 

if you are pirating & also help others
talk about Quality of movie / quality of video & audio

That's why YOU marathi people remain backward always  
At least have sense to say thanks 
just take & go is not a pirate culture & no other culture 

if you say thanks these who are using their money {power & Net charges} for seeding for will get you more things 

at least click on + button on right upper corner named quality if you are bore of typing

,auxigen,2012-03-19T18:07Z,"Dude, Why are you so desperate to comment on Marathi people's cultural evolution??? Don't judge a whole race just because some of them did not comment on a pirated torrent site. Do u know which cast our president is? Sachin Tendulkar? Lata Mangeshkar is? Jhansi Ki Rani was? Do you know who is the Group CEO of Citi Bank? Who made the first Indian Movie? It was a Marathi manoos called Dadasaheb Phalke. I can go on like this for the whole day. Please get your facts checked before calling the entire cast ""backward"". We are Indian first then everything else.

Don't be so angry. Chill maar, relaxxx.

P.S-Nice torrent :)

i know what you told & am also indian & i have many friends in MH 

but sometimes you have do something like this in order to get some really good thing out 

& here you are 

my point is 

if someone is helping[sharing] then he should be appreciated that's it 
in india when you talk about their cast 
that's when people rise & do something good
otherwise
just they just have one feeling
