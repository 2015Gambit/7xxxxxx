The Giants of French literature : Balzac Flaubert, Proust, and Camus


Prof. Katherine Elkins 

It is a series of fourteen lectures (each ca. 40-minutes long) that are delivered by Professor Elkins, of Kenyon College. 

In this series of lectures, Professor Katherine Elkins details the lives and works of the premier French writers of the last two centuries. With keen insight into her subject material, Professor Elkins discusses the attributes that made classics of such works as Balzac's Human Comedy, Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Proust's In Search of Lost Time, and Camus' The Stranger. Literary immortals all, these four French authors produced works that reflected their times and exerted a continuing and lasting influence on all the generations that followed.
