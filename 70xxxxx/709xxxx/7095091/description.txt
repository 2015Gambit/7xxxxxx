This is my previous 6.88GB collection converted from CD+G into DivX
with some added and revamped selections too - totals 9.38GB as DivX

Its a nicer way to exist - promoting this music with a portable roadshow
of some kind perhaps - a laptop along with a mike and Behringer amp - why not!


It beats rap music and the garbage on the shelves all to hell I say!

enjoy this complete DJ collection of standards traditional pop jazz
showtunes, euro patriotic and other favourites along the way!
