[T],moviesbyrizzo,2012-03-14T23:11Z,"By the way, we sometimes have a power failure in our area which lasts a few minutes each time. We had one a few minutes ago in fact. We have almost never suffered from down-time from this fact however - as we use a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) on our main server to keep  things going automatically each time. Recommend each ""career seeder"" invest in one certainly! thanks, Michael"
