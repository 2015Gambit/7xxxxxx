,necrogen,2012-03-14T01:00Z,What's the quality of these episodes?
,jjmontroy,2012-03-14T03:29Z,"Quality is good 720p, I'm just watching these and so far the episodes ""Still"" and ""apple thief"" are messed up so I suggest not downloading those ones if u can. Get them separately on pirate bay a quick 2 min download for me"
,unamuzzed,2012-03-31T00:00Z,thanks :D
,SymbianScenic,2012-04-01T13:09Z,"hey, thanks alot for this! Just had a quick question. Are all the files 720p?"
,3htthe,2012-06-24T00:42Z,I just previewed a few- no. Not all of them are 720p. 
,MicrosoftWeird,2012-07-10T13:37Z,is incendium included?
,FenianLad,2012-08-07T01:11Z,"I can't comment on the rest of the torrent because I only downloaded the episode Incendium, but the quality was ok. Not the best I've seen, but it's the only torrent with Incendium actually included so I've no choice. A much higher-quality torrent can be found here minus (Incedium):
