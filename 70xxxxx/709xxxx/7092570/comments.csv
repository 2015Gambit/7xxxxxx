,burnpet,2012-03-14T23:30Z,"Hey, i am part of the 2 man team behind this game.

I cant really do anything regarding piracy and i really don't want to be all dramatic and start preaching why its wrong to warez indie games, I do have a request that if you have pirated the game and enjoyed it, please, help spread the word about this game. record a video, link our website in forums, tell you friends (paying friends :)), anything. 

If you cant afford the game and have to resort to piracy, at least give us something back in exchange for our hard work."
,SleazyUnicorn,2012-03-15T03:15Z,lol your not a part of this?...you would of atleast had the username they use stop lying and go get laid
,burnpet,2012-03-15T06:43Z,"Even if i am not one of the developers, how is it affecting the legitimacy of what i said?"
,SleazyUnicorn,2012-03-15T06:58Z,cuz if you arent part of there team no one cares wat you have to say?...you cant do anything about the pirating of ANY game so why make a comment about it?...if we wana fucking buy the game why would we b here?...if we wana support them y would we download a torrent?...so wat your saying just doesnt matter...kthxbai
,SleazyUnicorn,2012-03-15T07:07Z,oh and by the way retard its a 3 man team ignorant fuck
,burnpet,2012-03-15T16:37Z,"Not all pirates pirate 100% of their games, some do it so they could test for themselves without having to listen to biased reviews, some do it because they are temporarily short on cash, so do it out of a principle ideology. 

We are a 2 man team, alex, our PR, has just left us."
,FireFtw,2012-03-16T00:07Z,"@SleazyUnicorn

,FireFtw,2012-03-16T00:11Z,"Also @burnpet, I agree on your view on piracy, and the only reason I bought this game originally was because I got a pirated version. That being said, this is your game and if you would like I will take down the torrents and stop updating them. "
,burnpet,2012-03-16T21:25Z,"If you wont put a torrent here, someone else will. i rather it will be someone like you who value us and our work and is decent enough to put a link to our webpage here."
