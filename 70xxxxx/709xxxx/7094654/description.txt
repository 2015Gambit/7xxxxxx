In this hour and a half special, writer/director/com
edian/podcaster Kevin Smith conducts a riotous and outrageous
Q&A session about the aftermath of his latest film, Red State
Topics include such misadventures as his pissing off the entire
movie blogger community at the Sundance Film Festival and being
followed around the country by the highly devout, and highly
angered, Phelps Family
