[T],carter67,2012-04-03T16:30Z,"    Thanks for posting this, installed on my Chinese Head Unit yesterday c/w  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7017201  maps and wow this is absolutely Brilliant. I used the Tomsoft skin and it Looks and works so much better than IGO8 & Primo 1.2 ever did. The extra options alone and the increased quality of my TMC are without doubt brilliant unexpected extras.

    I Highly Recommend this to any one running the Chinese Wince Head units with Sat/Nav it's like installing a brand new Unit.

    The PirateBay Torrents are Fine, Fast, Safe Torrents and I will continue Seeding to help keep them Alive.

,ScorpioPirate,2012-04-10T14:29Z,"maniacse!!!

It work ok, but you have to use only normal voice.
And disable real view ""Exit signs"" and ""Photo real in highway""  Because those eat lot of memory.
When you do that it can run under 64MB Ram.
Have a' nice day... :-)"
