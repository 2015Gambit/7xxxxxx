PLEASE, GO BACK TO PUTTING A TORRENT LINK AND THE MAGNET ONE, BECAUSE FOR THE MAGNET YOU MUST HAVE UTORRENT 3 AND THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN MANY SITES. PUT THE MAGNET IF YOU WANT, BUT ALSO THE NORMAL TORRENT DOWNLOAD LINK OTHERWISE I AND MANY OTHERS CANNOT GET THEM. IT DOESNT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU AND WE CAN ALSO ENJOY THE STUFF YOU UPLOAD......

It's not the uploader's choice, *all* of the pirate bay has changed to magnet links *only*.

It makes it so TPB can never be taken down permanently, the *entire* site is about ~100mb now, and can be hosted anywhere."
