,Goodquality2012,2012-03-27T11:35Z,Truly. I cannot even begin to fathom how pathetic you are for uploading possibly one of the worst pieces of shit ever created. And to think they actually got funding for this? For all who are curious. Its really... REALLY bad.

I personally love this movie, but I like musicals, weird things, and gore."
,Harbinger_of_Aids,2012-04-10T01:02Z,Thanks for the great upload! This film is truly a masterpiece. 
,stormyd1369,2012-04-28T08:36Z,"Have you ever heard the phrase ""cult movie""??  This movie is FREAKING AWESOME!! Its a modern form of Rocky Horror Picture Show...sort of..only BETTER!! Thank you so much for uploading this video..I've had it stolen from me twice..and its a must-see for anyone out there who prefers to think outside of the box and wouldn't be caught dead hiding with the rest of the close minded ""sheeple""."

He hates repo so much that he created a profile on a torrenting site, searched for repo, then took the time to comment on it just to voice his hatred. Me thinks someone is overcompensations for something. Think you actually may have some feelings for repo, goodquality?"
