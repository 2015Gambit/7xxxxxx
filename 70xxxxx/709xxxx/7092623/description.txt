Why Hide My IP
Many websites and software applications use your IP address to track and profile your online activity. When you connect to the Internet, your computer is assigned an IP address, which is your unique identification number on the Internet. This number may contain information about where you are located, who you are, and what programs are running on your computer.

How to Hide My IP
Using Super Hide IP, you can conceal your identity online by showing these websites a "fake IP" located in a country of your choice, blocking hackers and prying eyes from knowing your true location or identity.

Install Notes
1. Install the program and do not run.
2. Copy the crack "SuperHideIP.exe" to prog dir,i.e. "C:Program FilesSuperHideIP", and replace the original.
3. DONE!
