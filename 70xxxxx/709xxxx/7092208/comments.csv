The weapons work in multuplayer! Just host a game and check them out"
,OmniNegro,2012-03-10T19:17Z,"Multiplayer cheats suck like a velociraptor as a hooker.

Do what you want to the single player game, but what the fuck is wrong with you power tripping bitches ruining things for everyone else?"
,AkkAttack,2012-03-10T19:56Z,It's Co-Op.. Anyway just giving people the option.
,MLO89,2012-03-11T08:02Z,Nice but you made it a little too strong. Need to back off the weapons a bit to make the game better.
,MLO89,2012-03-11T17:57Z,"It takes the same number of shots to kill a big Mech with this as a regular soldier, making it out of balance. Can you modify it a bit to balance that?"
,AkkAttack,2012-03-11T22:59Z,"Yeah, I made this with one thing in mind, to dominate any enemy with minimul hits, I can easily change it so that Wep dam isn't so high, if that is what some of you may like. I didn't know how many people would enjoy this so I didnt put to much time into thinking what you guys would want in a mod."
,MLO89,2012-03-12T18:08Z,"Please make another one. I really liked this one rather than using a trainer but as I said the damage needs to be balanced. It's about right for killing regular soldiers but killing the tougher stuff should not take the same number of hits as it does now. The way you have it now, everything dies with the same number of hits. Looking forward to seeing you adjust this. Thanks"
,AkkAttack,2012-03-12T18:21Z,"The reason it takes the same number of hits is.... the damage is so high, give me your email, I'll personally send you a new one, what weapons do you mainly use? That way I know what to change"
,MLO89,2012-03-12T19:25Z,"I'll give you my disposable email address for now and once we communicate, I'll give my permanent one. Thanks

,MLO89,2012-03-12T19:29Z,email me and we can talk in more detail.
,HaLuong11,2012-03-16T09:28Z,"Can u please give me some instruction how activate the 99999999 credit option in multiplay mode please? I press 2, then it's show that i got 9999999 credits on the top right corner but it didn't go to my money amount. Here is my email: haluong11@gmail.com. And thank you again!"
,AkkAttack,2012-03-16T12:52Z,"Alright, this mod's Numpad 2 for credits does NOT give you credits in multiplayer, just single player. I can make another that gives you credits for multiplayer, if enough people want that."
,HaLuong11,2012-03-16T19:00Z,Please make one sir! Please! I really hope so ~^.^~ Anyway thank you again for your effort!!!
,mclovin30,2012-03-19T03:19Z,Has anyone tried this in multiplayer? Did you get ban? Is it possible to farm credit in Gold using this and kill waves easily? 
,mclovin30,2012-03-19T14:43Z,"Just tried on MP. couldnt get it to work. I hit the numpad keys but no effect. Could you teach me how? also, which weapons does the inf ammo and rapid fire affects? "
,AkkAttack,2012-03-20T14:07Z,"The Numpad cheats are for single-player only, the weapons though are for multiplayer and single. Most all the weapons other then the starter ones, i.e. predator, avenger, so on are modded"
,wert1098,2012-03-20T19:21Z,can you make a modification on the geth rifle and only to that gun so i could use it in multiplayer and one hit kill?  
,brianbernardo,2012-03-23T05:13Z,"hey...thanks for the mod but...the only weapons that are affected by the mod are the starter ones....how do i get them to work on ALL of the weapons...god mode,exp and credits worked though thanks :))"
,HaLuong11,2012-03-24T05:34Z,"Can u make a new one but adding the assault rifle ""vindicator"" please? ^_^ or can u show me how to do it?
I'm messing around with ME3 Coalesced Utility but for couple days but still didn't get what i wanted >."
,AnonymousBasterd,2012-03-24T10:27Z,Can you just create a mod that will instantly give me ALL Weapon Mods? Cause THAT'S ALL I NEED! This mode is just utterly destroying the game. This mod is like a Super Everything Mod...
