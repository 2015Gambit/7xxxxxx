I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.
I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 
Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 
Surely I wont always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it is up to you to help these shares to spread.

Hector Zazou Discography
A MUSIC torrent :)
Dig the faery word of Hector Zazou
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Zazou

Some time ago ill88eagle, my brother and me were musing about some new interesting discography to build...
My wife simply said: - Why don't you try Hector Zazou... I guess you all should like him?
- Hector who???
But eagle and my brother said: - Trust your wife.
And so we started chasing... and it was really worth the effort...
Zazou was a peculiar artist who explored the music scene in a very personal way... From his progressive "Erik Satie" beginnings with ZNR to electronic music, mixed with avantgarde and especially world music of whatever kind: african, asian until sacred celtic music.
He worked with many artists, known and unknown: Bill Laswell, Brendan Parry, David Sylvian, Harold Budd and also Bony Bikaye, Carlos Núñez, Sainkho Namtchylak - just to cite some of them (and I guess the last three will be unknown to many of you :) )
Surely a torrent not for MTV consumers... but my mates and me are stubborn... we believe in music... 
There are 27 album and a DVD (from Quadri + Chromies: a loopable visual installation, worth a Venice Biennal, with the artwork of Bernard Caillaud with the music tapestries of Zazou).
All the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB). The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible. Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips. Enjoy :)
