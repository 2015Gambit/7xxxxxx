[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-10T12:47Z,"@cheetah25:

Perfect... for portable devices with screens about 4-4,5"" [ max 11-12"" for the iPad] and low storage capacity [ 16-64 GiB ] like smartphones up to iPad [the new one]. For wide  screens [PC monitors and HD TV's] you need sensible higher video and audio bite rate for cinema quality !!"

,paulcx,2012-05-29T22:44Z,"Don't be put off by the error saying Spoken language = Finnish. 
They do speak English!
(in the little bit of talking done)
Silent movie text on screen is French (at least what I saw when skimming the download), but translated into English in the Subtitles track. "
