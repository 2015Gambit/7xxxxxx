,nysk,2012-03-12T18:53Z,"one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. not the usual Armageddon pathos, not the usual vampires, aliens, ghosts, murders, torture or whatever is conventionally scary, yet still, it's under your skin, shake you to your core scary, lingering long after you've watched it. if you find it burdening to be stimulated mentally from a movie than skip this one.  
thanks for the hr upload!"
