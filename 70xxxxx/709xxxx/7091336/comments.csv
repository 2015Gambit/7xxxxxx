[T],trialNerror,2012-03-11T00:52Z,"Hm. Some of us have work on the weekends and can't stay up all damn night to give you want you want immediately.

You can quit your bitching now since the 720p has been released.

Besides, there is nothing wrong with this HDTV version. Looks damn good.  "

,1dissident,2012-03-12T23:31Z,"thanks man.  No bitching here... I actually like the 264 d/l's.  I'm not really sure why people would say something like ""you're a giant pussy for uploading 264"" ...wtf does that have to do with anything?  STFU and get your shit somewhere else if you don't like it."
