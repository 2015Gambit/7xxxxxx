,cojon,2012-05-15T18:09Z,"I have been looking for this thing! I have, and have and have--what a find! Muchas Gracias!    Appreciado mucho!

Thanks for that superior upload.

Interface be damned, who cares!  It might be a bit unorthodox and require a few different strokes, however it's a real working PFD converter. It could be better, but as I open it I will sing praises to scene4all until I find something better. 

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!

I'm doing handsprings across the barn right about now happy and content as a piglet with his face stuck to a big warm tit and his butt comfortable in five inches of shit! 

Now that's happy, content, and comfortable...aint it! "

I am running Windows 7 64 bit."
