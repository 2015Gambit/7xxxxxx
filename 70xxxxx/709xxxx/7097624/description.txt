ABBA was a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972, comprising Agnetha Fältskog, Benny Andersson, 
Björn Ulvaeus and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the 
history of pop music, topping the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982. ABBA has sold over 370 million 
records worldwide and still sell millions of records a year, which makes them one of the best
selling music artists, and the second best selling music group in history, behind The Beatles . ABBA 
was the first pop group to come from a non-English-speaking country that enjoyed consistent success 
in the charts of English-speaking countries, including the UK, Ireland, the U.S., Canada, Australia
