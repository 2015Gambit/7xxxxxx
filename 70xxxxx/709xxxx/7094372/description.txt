┬░  Many companies use advanced finite element analysis to calculate         ┬░
 ┬░  design stresses, but the fatigue analysis is often still done by         ┬░
 ┬░  manually picking stress points for spread-sheet analysis. This is time   ┬░
 ┬░  consuming and unreliable because itΓÇÖs easy to miss failure locations.    ┬░
 ┬░  Component validation by fatigue testing a prototype design in the test   ┬░
 ┬░  lab is time-consuming. If the prototype fails prematurely, a costly,     ┬░
 ┬░  open-ended cycle of design-test-redesign is required. Project            ┬░
 ┬░  time-scales slip and delivery is late.                                   ┬░

 ┬░  In the automotive industry some 40% of the total development cost is     ┬░
 ┬░  spent making prototype parts. In the medical industry an unexpected      ┬░
 ┬░  failure can mean the loss of several months lead-time over               ┬░
 ┬░  competitors.                                                             ┬░

 ┬░  With fe-safeΓäó as an integrated part of your design process, you have     ┬░
 ┬░  the ability to optimise designs and test programs, reduce prototype      ┬░
