Sense And Sensibility (1995) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114388/

Just, my _first_ experiment in DVD encoding, but still the smallest rip for that movie: 500 MB.

Possibly interesting for you are the encoding parameters, which usually nobody disclose:
HandBrake-0.9.6-i686-Win_GUI,mkv,x264,filters off,keep aspects,anamorphic=none,bitrate=427,2pass+turbo,AUDIO:AAC,Dolby surround,22.05,96
ADVANCED:
ref=5:deblock=-2,-1:analyse=all:me=umh:subq=5:psy_rd=0.00,0.00:direct=auto:keyint_min=23:aq-mode=2:bframes=16:qpmin=10:qpmax=51:mbtree=0

Feel free to use these options yourself, or improve!
I actully cloned these options from YIFI torrent "Amelie (2001) [ENG Subs] - 480p 400mb - YIFY", which has the best quality/size, in my opinion .. ;)
