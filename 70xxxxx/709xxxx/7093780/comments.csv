,temo2k,2012-03-18T01:54Z,This is a bad rip by WRE. If you compare it to the webrip there are annoying pops and clicks in this that shouldn't be there.
[V],Mr.Yellow,2012-03-18T23:47Z,Guess u have issues with ur player dude
,temo2k,2012-03-19T02:49Z,"No, it's a bad rip. 

The little clicks at the beginning of track 1 aren't part of the song, they're glitches. You can even hear the sound pop at around 13s.

QMI released an mp3 rerip of cd1 to fix it but I haven't seen a rerip of the flac version.

Anyways, just warning peeps that this release isn't perfect like it should be..."
,enkedo,2012-03-19T06:49Z,"i am agree with temo2k
this rip is not high quality"
[V],Mr.Yellow,2012-03-19T19:50Z,Well i think that ur more than welcome to upload a better version guys!
