It's CSI: Istanbul in this dark thriller featuring Sener Sen, Cem Yilmaz, and Okan Yalabik as a team of Turkish homicide detectives investigating the murder of a young woman whose severed arm is found in a swamp. This pivotal case is the first for rookie detective Hasan, the brightest and most promising student in his class; the last for Chief Ferman, whose pending retirement looms; and a career-defining challenge for the passionate and impulse-driven Idris. The suspect list includes a line-up of close family members and local ne'er-do-wells, plus one wealthy overlord who strikes fear and dread at the mere mention of his name. And as the three detectives winnow the list of suspects, their revelations pose more questions than they answer.

Written and directed by Yavuz Turgul, Av Mevsimi is a masterpiece of cinema noir. With its impeccably-crafted screenplay, and a constellation of perfectly-cast characters, every minute of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime is an exercise in mindful pacing and plot development that weaves a richly sinister tapestry of mystery and intrigue.
