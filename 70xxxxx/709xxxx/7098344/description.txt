Home Of The Future
The Pereras, a regular family from Sheffield, have their lives transformed by cutting-edge technology, giving them a taste of how we all might be living the future.

Part 2 | Home of the Future
It's all change for junior exec Joel as he's given a home office packed with the cutting-edge technology that will be coming to our workplaces (and growing number of home offices) in the future. There's everything from pocket-sized virtual laser keyboards to robots on wheels that let you 'walk around' an office in California while sitting on the sofa in Sheffield. Joel also discovers how sci-fi is becoming a reality, with computers you can control with magic wands. Meanwhile, the run-down family MOT testing centre business gets an overhaul, as expert presenter and futurist Chris Sanderson sets them up with their own electric charging point, and mechanic Leon discovers the secrets behind the future of both electric and hydrogen-powered cars. But the most exciting gadgets are the 3D printers, allowing the family to 'print' solid objects. Meanwhile, life gets a little easier for Mum and Dad as they are given robots that wash the floor and do the vacuuming. There's also a cool new kitchen to speed Michele's mountain of laundry, and a visit to a UK company that's invented a 'virtually waterless' washing machine. There are also apps that help with the shopping; a bath that runs itself to your chosen temperature, depth and bubble consistency; and vast solar farms that turn the power of the sun into unlimited energy.
