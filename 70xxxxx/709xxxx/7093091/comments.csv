,jaybee2003,2012-03-11T06:49Z,It's a rared mp4 lol. shit release.
,stegman,2012-03-11T06:58Z,"OK, so what did you thought this meant? :
""x264"" and ""Video Codec...: h264""

Of course it's .mp4, and there's nothing wrong with those.
Slightly higher bitrate & resolution, with slightly smaller size, compared to old-school .avi/divx format.

Love 'em or hate 'em .mp4/h264 are here to stay.
Welcome to 21st century.

P.S.
Thanks a lot for the movie 'sceneline'."

@jaybee2003  -- You sir are a dumb ass.

Nothing wrong with rar. Takes twenty seconds to un-rar.

MP4 PERFECT!!! Superior video quality in a smaller file size.

,pin6appl6,2012-03-11T07:18Z,Ladies and Gents we are good to go. Thanks for uploading so fast!
,sev_on_tpb,2012-03-11T07:26Z,"yeah, i was wondering, what exactly jaybee2003's problem was: the rar-ing, the mp4, or both?"
,Heave__Ho,2012-03-11T07:47Z,"Why the rar files? This isn't 1995 when we're worried about dropped packets.

Also, it doesn't play properly."
,davidsask,2012-03-11T10:21Z,"This is indeed a SHIT file, it takes forever to unrar, then when you try and play it any player it stalls and there is no VOLUME! You suck ass sceneline for all your stupid rar files and esp. for this bunk one!"
,sev_on_tpb,2012-03-11T10:22Z,"actually, yeah, this doesn't play properly for me either - in VLC or Quicktime.  this version is better http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7093117/Game.Change.2012.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD"
,reedski,2012-03-11T10:25Z,"NO Audio Funky Audio codec mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC
Give me an XViD anyday"
,zero1zero,2012-03-11T13:33Z,The movie starts paused for like 20 seconds then it starts. It looks like it was supposed to record that 20 seconds but it messed up. The rest of the movie seems fine. 
,BoonesFerry,2012-03-11T13:52Z,"Yup! BAD FILE! Needs to be nuked. 
The problem is not with TPB member Sceneline.
The problem is not that it's a rar file...no biggie.
The problem is not x264 or mp4
The problem quite simply is this is a bad file. No need to freak out people. It happens. "
,juandl,2012-03-11T21:05Z,"Yep. Unfortunately there is no audio using any player I have including latest VLC.  Oh well, thanks for trying.

Agreed that un-raring is not really a problem but is really unnecessary with video and images.  Zipping is for compacting white space of which there is little to none in video."
,JRaiden,2012-03-11T22:51Z,"Confirmed problem with ASAP's release.

,pteosmium,2012-03-12T00:43Z,"Totally pointless to RAR video files.  You can't compress them. Seriously.  Just makes it harder to manage your files.  All the RAR files are the same combined size as the contained video file.  Compression only works when there is data that is repeated over and over again (text, applications...).  So called ""video compression"" is lossy in nature and therefore can't be reversed."
,dtsm,2012-03-12T01:09Z,"Fast download, easy to open rar files to mp4. My only issue is handbrake won't convert to mv4 file so can't upload to iPad to view. But it works fine with quicktime on a computer."
,Sanyi001,2012-03-12T23:16Z,"no sound for me either. 
A: -1million
V: who cares"
,touchablehusky,2012-03-16T21:10Z,"My Mac did not like this file, and I could not convince the rar expander to play nice with any of the rar files.  Appreciate the upload effort, sceneline, and the prob could be with my old compie!"
,eleventy4,2012-08-22T01:20Z,"An MP4 doesn't need to be RAR'd because it's already a compressed file type.  That being said, I don't mind enough to complain, just thought I would help clear up the issue.  Thanks for the rip!"
