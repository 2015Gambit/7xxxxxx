Some people, believe it or not, actually care about QUALITY. The standard rips that are about 300 mb are so heavily compressed that they look very bad on a full-hd monitor, it takes away immersion."
,lu_fer,2012-03-12T11:52Z,"This file has 4.2 gb and the image isnÂ´t excellent image, a smaller file will be a worse image,big files , better images, do you understand?"
,Elroosi,2012-03-12T13:56Z,The bigger the better!!!! 1080 Rocksssssssss!!!!!!!!
,hutness,2012-03-12T22:32Z,Darn it. I wish it was a little below 4 GB so I can put it on a 4 gig flash memory.
