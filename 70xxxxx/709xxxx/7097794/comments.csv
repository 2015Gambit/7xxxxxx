Again ty 4 your ongoing and very much appreciated efforts, "

Its better audio/video at a smaller size. Its also natively supported by a lot of devices like Xbox. If its not playing on your phone, I'd suggest QQplayer if you're on android. If your on iPhone, then try another player. If that doesn't work... convert the video yourself? You're getting something for free, so don't complain too much. ;)"
