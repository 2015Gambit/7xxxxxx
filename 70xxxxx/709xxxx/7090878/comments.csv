much longer .. zillions still want my rips for xvid

however you can covert very fast these with umile encoder 3.. google it.. its free. however you need
to make custom profile for 1000kbs 25fps and 640x352 sizing.. about 5min to setup and save
it for future uses.

however some wont convert.. audio can drift
randomly but does about 90 percent fine in 8min
converts.. very fast on single pass and faster if
have nvidia card as it can uses it math processor
to do it faster"

trailNerror's new format is total crap, I can't watch any of the season 6 episodes without the audio skipping completely"
