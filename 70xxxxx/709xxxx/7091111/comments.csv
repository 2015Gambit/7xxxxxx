Anyway I've been searching for McCloud Season 5 (it has made it to dvd already) and it would be really cool if you could upload it or tell me where to find it.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065317/
Your feedback/input would be much appreciated! Thanks for all that you do, your hard work is greatly appreciated. Cheers, Fiz."
