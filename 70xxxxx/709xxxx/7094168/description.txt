Release info:
WAM is proud to present XBOX XDK 5933. Digital signatures removed
   to protect the guilty.  This release is for all the great xbox homebrew
   developers out there. WAM loves you all !!

   Notes:
   
   So Whats this? a new xdk? but microsoft said 5849 was the last one..
   Well they straight out lied. This xdk was produced for Microsoft's
   in house developers (Think Halo 2). What they tweaked is unknown
   but rest assured it must be good.

   -We've included the remote recovery exe for those
   who have an official debug kit.

   WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!WARNING
   If you have a retail modded xbox do not use the remote
   recovery executable. it can and will flash your bios, overwrite your
   harddrive, and blank your eeprom. Unless of course you know what your doing.
   do not blame us if you hose your xbox!
