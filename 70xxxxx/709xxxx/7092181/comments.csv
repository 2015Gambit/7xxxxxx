,Osmosian,2012-03-10T18:09Z,"Also, I don't see the point in the cutting at the top/bottom you did. But okay."

,Osmosian,2012-03-10T19:18Z,"Download latest utorrent, press ""Get this torrent"" then click OK when your browser asks you. That's how magnet links work."

You are an amazing uploader, always on time and with a nice amount of seeders to go with it. You're awesome, and thank you again :)"
