    Along with Chet Atkins and Merle Travis, Joe Maphis was one of the most
    widely heard session guitarists from the 1940s until the 1980s, but his
    solo recordings weren't nearly as popular -- which doesn't mean they
    weren't good. The 24 brisk, crisp instrumental tracks on Flying Fingers
    (running under one hour) were cut mostly for Columbia between 1955 and
    1960; the 1955-1957 stuff was recorded between sides by Rose Lee Maphis,
    and she is present there playing guitar, with Larry Collins (featured on
    four numbers, on top of which his sister Lorrie is the subject of the
    title of the Maphis original "Lorrie Ann"), Johnny Bond, and Leon Silby
    joining the guitar accompaniment on the later sessions. In addition to
    guitar, Maphis himself plays banjo and autoharp on various tracks. The
    best showcase to date of Maphis' work, the music features what seem like
    superhuman feats of dexterity, reminiscent of Jascha Heifetz's 1930s
    recordings on the violin, only better -- every note is hit spot-on, but
    the playing never loses its warmth or seems mechanical. Listeners may
    swear that the masters of "Flying Fingers," "Fire on the Strings," and
    "Floggin' the Banjo" must have been sped up, but they weren't. While they
    may constitute highlights, they're not alone. Other high spots include
    "Katy Warren Breakdown," by session fiddle player Fiddlin' Kate Warren,
    and the cover of "Sweet Fern" by A.P. Carter. There's also a lot of variety,
    especially with the presence of the four Collins sides, which rock pretty
    hard; "Early American" shows some strong blues elements.
