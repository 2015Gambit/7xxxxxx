This time, instead of our typical 320 kbps/CBR MP3 Audio file I have included an ipod/iphone/ipad friendly format that is M4A with lesser size but something which can give the former a challenge when it comes to quality, take a look and give in your most valuable suggestions or state if I should get back to uploading 320 kbps MP3. 

Times are changing and its about time we incorporate new technology and lets kiss good bye the ones that served us earlier, we had a great run back then with it but now its time for us to move on. :)
