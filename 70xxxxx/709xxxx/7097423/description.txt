Behold yet another insanely good album.

Hunky Dory is the fourth album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1971. It was Bowie's first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Hunky Dory has been described by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as having "a kaleidoscopic array of pop styles, tied together only by Bowie's sense of vision: a sweeping, cinematic mélange of high and low art, ambiguous sexuality, kitsch, and class."

The style of album cover was influenced by a Marlene Dietrich photo book that Bowie took with him to the photo shoot.

This album is the real deal. It's the highest quality possible, and all the songs are named and tagged for your iTunes needs.
