about this day of asot, PLEASE don't give me pain in the ass about the 10 seconds shift in the songs, and for ppl asking why they are split, because we love them that way , if you want them unsplit you can find them i just do split, and if you're wondering that i said they are the same !! well i say that for amateurs trance listeners to shut them up, but when you're into trance, you will know when a song is stuck in your head, you don't have to go all the way through keep looking for it and just copy it to other devices, THAT'S ONE OF MANY REASONS
