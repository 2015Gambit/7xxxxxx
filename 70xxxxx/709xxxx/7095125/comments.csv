,FileList1,2012-03-12T14:14Z,And don't worry about comments about split/unsplit thing. Splitting is the best thing you can do! So keep up the good work. :) Have a nice day.

,karimbaraka,2012-03-12T18:37Z,UR the best
,tranceaddict9,2012-03-12T18:49Z,No. splitting is not the best thing you can do.
,tranceaddict9,2012-03-12T18:55Z,"If splitting was the best way, Armin, Aly and Fila, Sean Tyas, etc., would stop while performing after every fucking track to announce the name of it."

Jog on then mate."
,maniak242,2012-03-12T19:55Z,BANG!!! Thanks inspiron :D
,Prit-O,2012-03-12T22:06Z,"@inspiron Bro don't worry about any unthankful, tight-ass leeching sons of bitches. Your work is admirable. All that hard work compiling music for trance fanatics. I'm looking forward to the djblackeye mix. Cheers."
,Medvek,2012-03-12T22:44Z,"I loev your torrents inspiron, but i think this one is missplitted hard. Every song changes at the middle of the tracks.. etc.. you were in hurry or what?

anyway keep doing what you do, the dance community is very thankfull for it. your doing a great job!"
,dungab,2012-03-13T01:37Z,"i love just how split songs are right now, massiveÂĄÂĄ"
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-13T07:06Z,can you please add a unsplit version to the side of your uploads?
,qussay86,2012-03-13T09:16Z,"Fuck the haters bro, just non-sense i mean you don't like it assholes just close your fucking window and don't download... you're the one bro keep it UP :D
Leon Bolier and Markus werrrrre on FIIIIIRRRRRE that evening o/"
,mountainlion2012,2012-03-13T10:41Z,Someone please post a unsplit version I'm tried of trying to get the unsplit version to work right!
,tranceaddict9,2012-03-13T20:38Z,"@mountainlion2012  I haven't found the unsplit version anywhere online yet, but there are programs to fix these tracks. Soon there will probably be an unsplit version somewhere. Don't know why inspiron is so butt hurt to keep on splitting it."
,MitsEvX,2012-03-13T20:52Z,You deserve an award :D Thanks as always!
[T],-inspiron-,2012-03-14T00:56Z,"YOU FUCKERS @mountainlion2012 AND @tranceaddict9 GET LOST, DON'T POST YOUR SHITTY COMMENTS IN HERE, or any of my torrents, no one forced you to check my profile here regularly, i will keep on splitting, get the fuck away, damn, losers can't help it !! and if anyone else asked for unsplit politely i will do it, P.S i can give you other thing really big and not split, something will get in you not through your ears ;)"

""and if anyone else asked for unsplit politely i will do it""

Hey man! Just wanted to see if I could take you up on that offer. I LOVE your split tracks and torrent/seed them every week.. because they're easier to find knowing the name of the tracks and whatnot. And it fits easier on my ipod. But my girlfriend seems to like the unslpit for some reason, so wanted to see if you can upload it? Just for asot 550, the other guy doesn't seem to be uploading unsplit past the London event. Thanks so much mate!

It's the best that you upload the split tracks, fuck the haters!!"
,turvgasm,2012-03-14T11:14Z,"Inspiron, I'm with Matt1004 - I d/l heaps of what you post, but prefer ASOT in the unsplit version. Is it possible that you could help us out? Certainly not knocking either way. Just my preference is all. BTW i check your account all the time. quality uploads and trance non-stop! Much appreciated!!"
,L0Liv3r,2012-03-14T13:45Z,"anyone else experinced problems with this set? the sound is wierd,"
,AMDOMINATOR,2012-03-14T16:18Z,"Inspi Bro You Did An Amazing Work Always.

I Don't Know How Many Of The People In Here Have Been To An Actual Live Performance By But There Are Big Screens In There Which Do Show The Names Of The Tracks The DJ Is Playing.

As For Those With Problems With The Split Tracks, Well All I Can Say Is It Better Split Rather Than The Whole Continuous Thing.

Cause I'm A DJ Myself And Sometimes I Love The Songs Played By The Other DJs And Its Like Hey Wait A Minute What Is This Track Man I Wanna Hear Again Or Even Play It Sometimes For My Own Set And For This Things Can Get Pretty Hard At Times Scrolling Back And Forth For The Song And Then Even Trying To Finding Over The Net.

You Make My Life Much Easier And Simpler Inspi.
Thank You Very Much For Your Effort."
,zoghurt,2012-03-14T21:00Z,"Like always, you are great inspiron. Thanks for the share. 

However, I just listened Leon Bolier's set and I must say, it seems like you messed up the splitting with this one. I'll go with unsplit this time."
,hsotnas,2012-03-14T21:37Z,"mountainlion2012 - get the Fuck out of here. Why the hell are you cry like a bitch always ?

@inspiron - Wow, awesome man !!! Thanks so much. You are doing a great job as always !!! Kudos to you, keep up the good work."
,kokohaxor,2012-03-14T23:08Z,"sory inspiron, i appreciate your work very much but this is very bad work... the sound is weird and the name of tracks arent right - its shifted by one and the worst for my ipad thing is that the splitted tracks  arent even full tracks but its like half of the previous song and half of the next... i suggest reupload"
,johan_9,2012-03-15T08:32Z,thanks a million love your work :)
,MTLGENTLEMAN,2012-03-15T19:47Z,"Hi Inspiron,
