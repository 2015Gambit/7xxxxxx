http://www.medixfire.com/?6cd86ukchanmce8

Change the 'x' to an 'a' to get correct URL"
,whmxtra,2012-03-11T23:06Z,ok why does nobody ever seed this torrent? I'm uploading at 900 kbps and downloading at 2 kbps....

,jchen9999,2012-03-12T06:16Z,"can you please upload the (SD) version
thank you"
,hamof,2012-03-12T15:05Z,"my vlc media player doesn't recognise the subtitles file, whats wrong?"
[T],burgundyranger,2012-03-12T18:12Z,"I'm in the process of downloading the SD. Facts are that the HD version gets 5 or 6 times the number of downloads. So, I prioritize that one.

In terms of seeding, when I post the torrent, I seed for as long as it takes for others to get a full version and I see more seeders. For a reason I can't explain, TPB does NOT see me as the original seeder and will show a 0 as number of seeders. DO NOT GO BY THIS.

Thanks"
,whmxtra,2012-03-28T10:46Z,"wasn't going by that, I am going by the fact that I end up uploading at 1 mpbs while downloading at 1.5 kpbs so by the time I get the file I have uploaded 10-20 gigs of data. Shouldn't be like that unless the seeders aren't seeding properly."
