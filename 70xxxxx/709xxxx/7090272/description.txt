Creature Tech - Doug TenNapel [IMAGE Comics]

Good battles evil, and the world hangs in the balance! Resurrected by the Shroud of Turin, the zombified Dr. Jameson intends to finish what he started 150 years ago -- destroying the earth with a giant space eel. Standing in his way is Dr. Ong, a would-be pastor turned scientist who now works in a government research facility infamously known as Creature Tech. Aided by an unlikely cast of rednecks, symbiotic aliens, and a CIA-trained mantid, Dr. Ong embarks on a journey of faith, love, and self-discovery. All in a day's work at Creature Tech!

This comic sounds weird right? Well, it is - But AWESOME weird. I spent 2 hours in Barnes and Nobles reading this - So Good!! Scan quality is not the greatest but only copy I could find. Like it - Buy It!
