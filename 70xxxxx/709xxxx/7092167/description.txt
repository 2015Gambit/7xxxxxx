Description

Plot: During a weekend corporate retreat, her best friends convince unlucky-in-love Lonnie to “switch the script” and take control of men. Lonnie impresses every man in the place with her beauty and charm – most importantly, her boss’ good-looking son, David. Lots of laughs, funny hijinks, and heartfelt moments take place, and we watch as Lonnie tries to embrace her new personality without turning away what quite possibly may be “Mr. Right.” Ray J, Thomas Mikal Ford, Bobby V, Jackee, Veronica Rodriguez, and Denyce Lawton star.
