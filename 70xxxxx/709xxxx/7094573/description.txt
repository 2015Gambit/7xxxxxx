Earth, Wind & Fire is an American R&B musical group founded in Chicago, Illinois, in 1971 by Maurice White. 
Also known as EWF, the band has won six Grammy Awards and four American Music Awards. They have been inducted 
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and have sold over 90 million albums 
worldwide. Rolling Stone magazine has described them as "innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet 
galvanizing" and has also declared that the band "changed the sound of black pop". In 1998, they were ranked 
at number 60 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Rock N' Roll.

The band's music contains elements of African, Latin American, funk, soul music, pop and rock music, jazz 
and other genres. The band is known for the dynamic sound of their horn section, and the interplay between 
the contrasting vocals of Philip Bailey's falsetto and Maurice White's tenor. The kalimba (African thumb 
piano) is played on all of the band's albums..
