A gentleman thief and a lady pickpocket join forces to con a beautiful perfume company owner. Romantic entanglements and jealousies confuse the scheme.

Most any place can seem to be a paradise. While you embrace, just the one that you adore. There needn't be an apple tree with magic powers. You need no garden filled with flowers. To taste the thrill of sweet greed hours. Gentle perfume and cushions that are silk and soft. Two in the gloom that is silent but for sighs. That's paradise while arms entwine and lips are kissing. But if there's something missing, that signifies. Trouble in paradise.
