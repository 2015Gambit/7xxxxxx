This one's got everything: action, cannibals, gore, funny special FX, cheesy
love scenes, diamond thieves... everything a fan of trash could possibly ask
for. As for the 'plot', well this one seems to be heavily influenced by Jess
Franco's WHITE CANNIBAL QUEEN. An essential for the adventurous cinema lovers!

A holy grail of the cannibals-in-the-jungle genre, Ratno Timoer's 'Jungle Heat'
is a much better entry than S.G. Putra's 'Primitives'. You'll enjoy it, take my
word for it!
