Plot:
In this unearthed lost movie from 1990 that the studio deemed too terrible to release, a Vietnam 
Veteran Sal Bando(Sorbo), tortured by his past as a Poolboy returns home to Van Nuys, California, 
and a country he doesn't recognize, in which it seems only Mexicans run pool-cleaning companies. 
Bando sets off on a brutal mission to reclaim his "rightful" vocation and enact revenge on the man
(Trejo) who killed his wife and son.
