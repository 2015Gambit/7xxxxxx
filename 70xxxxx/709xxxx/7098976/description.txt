Plot:
When his brother is killed in a robbery, paraplegic Marine Jake Sully decides
to take his place in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he
learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of
driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for the precious
material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal
surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military
unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to
infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity. While Jake 
begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the
beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless 
extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in 
an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.
