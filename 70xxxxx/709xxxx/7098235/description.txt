Champion Jack Dupree - From New Orleans To Chicago [1966]

2008 - Retro Disc International / 33029 / Remastered / CD

Like many black American blues and R&B artists, New Orleans singer and pianist Champion Jack Dupree found more respect and recognition in Europe than he did in his homeland, and he relocated to Europe in 1959, only rarely returning to the U.S. He cut several albums there, including From New Orleans to Chicago, recorded in London in 1966.

From New Orleans is probably one of better known Champion's album, mainly for the presence of Eric Clapton and John Mayall at the sessions. Throughout, listeners are treated to Dupree's thundering barrelhouse piano, his Emerald City vocals (always delivered, it seems, with a slight wink), and a solid and rocking backing band. Highlights include "Ain't It a Shame" and "Down the Valley", great songs .
