,Frenetus,2012-03-13T13:44Z,"Seriously dude^^''

What do you know about encoding?"

,Frenetus,2012-03-13T20:38Z,"I don't want to make a fuzz ;)
 I just wanted to mention what I see.
Size doesn't matter btw., encoding quality isn't all about size. There are a shitload of functions and properties in h264 you can use which influences the quality of the video."

Look at this if you want to know what i mean^^''
I mean you no ill, i just know that it is possible to do better."
,IotIP,2012-03-16T18:29Z,"If you are worrying about something being this small, you are first... too used to idiots that don't know how to set up an encode (unless you have raw 7.1 sound, a gig for a 20 minute cartoon is stupid, even at 1080p/48fps)...  and, yes, this happens all the time.
Two, you probably don't do much real encoding (just picking up a free Windows encoder with a trojan installed, doesn't count).
This doesn't mean anything about you, personally, but it is a sorry state of affairs while the technology is going through a transition from one standard (xvid/divx/avi) to another (H.264/mp4 MD/HD/XD).  This may turn into a debacle like the Beta/VHS wars, where stupidity and promotion reigned over common sense and quality.
I want to see the best and most useful technology win... and to be used correctly.

Be happy it's a portable size, and that this person probably knows better than most, how to encode.  (I like small, it works best on the ""road"")

The only thing I want, that isn't here, is where this was captured from... The Hub, the web, or iTunes.  Without an explosion of adverts and badges, is always preferable."
,Frenetus,2012-03-17T02:04Z,"Uh yeah, i know that, as i said in my comments, 220mb is perfectly possible and even with good quality, but you have to know a few things about encoding. ;)
And XviD is already dead on the internet, only a matter of time till the last dvd players without h264 die out imo.

The source btw. is the same I think (Itunes)."
