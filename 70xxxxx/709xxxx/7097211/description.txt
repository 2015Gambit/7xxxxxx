 BBC correspondent Paul Wood reports on the brutal suppression of the uprising 
 in Homs. During the past four months, he and cameraman Fred Scott witnessed 
 the Syrian government's bombardment of the city and its people. Wood charts 
 the progress of the rebellion, from its start with hope of revolution to the 
 refugees now fleeing the city to escape retribution at the hands of forces 
 loyal to President Assad.
