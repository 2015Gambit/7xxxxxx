The complete series so far. Four episodes, each cut in two parts, i.e. eight in total.

AVIs collected from TPB with greatest care, subtitles from Addic7ed.com.

All files renamed to my preferred liking.

No advertising, no samples, no other crap included.

Subs for the first (two part) episode was for the hearing impaired, but I've tried to edit them to become normal subs -- I may have missed a little there, if so, forgive me. All subs that I have checked so far are of near professional quality.

If you like the concept of complete series uploads, please help me seed this upload to at least ratio 2:1!
