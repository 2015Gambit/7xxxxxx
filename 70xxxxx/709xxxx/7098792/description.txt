Rossellini, 1973: One makes films in order to become a better human being.
The New York Times, : Just watching Rossellini's magnificent work may help a bit in that department as well.

In the final phase of his career, Italian master Roberto Rossellini embarked on a dramatic, daunting project: a series of television films about knowledge and history, made in an effort to teach, where contemporary media were failing. Looking at the Western world's major figures and moments, yet focusing on the small details of daily life, Rossellini was determined not to recount history but to relive it, as it might have been, unadorned and full of the drama of the everyday. This selection of Rossellini's history films presents The Age of the Medici, Cartesius and Blaise Pascal - works that don't just enliven the past but illuminate the ideas that have brought us to where we are today.
