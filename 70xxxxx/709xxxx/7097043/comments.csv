My Father was just informed he needs surgery so my time was limited and have been dealing with related issues.

He should be fine. I am not worried. He is healthy other than a blockage."

,thunderbum,2012-03-13T21:53Z,"I'm sorry to hear about your Dad - my best for a speedy and complete recovery!! I just brought my Mom home from the hospital recently - she had bronchitis and bored silly for a week. What pissed me off about her stay was that some f'ing thief on the floor: I brought her some cross stitch to do and the embroidery scissors were stolen along with a bunch of her favorite muchies (Giant Toblerone bar), large bag pistachios, and someone tried to steal the watch off her wrist!!!

I only noticed the watch yesterday - the leather strap was broken and stapled (!) as well as surgical tape (!) was used to hide the staple. (White leather - that's why I didn't notice it at first.)

Did I mention my Mom is 90? (Yeah, I'm an old fart) Really bugs me when people target 'seasoned citizens!

And she's doing just fine now - had a pacemaker put in 8 months ago (bionic Mom!)

Let us know how your Dad is doing - always nice to hear good news!  :)"
