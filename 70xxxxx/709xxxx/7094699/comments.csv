,angel255ad,2012-03-12T12:05Z,Thanks for the upload i don't know why people are using mp4 and mkv's now i prefer avi.. because most software i use for doing movie and tv shows don't except the other formats and there alot harder to deal with avi's are better to manage so thanks :)

I will always do .Avi files first as it is my main file method for uploading

But i am going to start uploading MP4 files more for the people who enjoy the files as MP4's "

Problem with AVI is that the bigger the screen, the more pix-elated it gets. Only good for laptop viewing really. Mp4 files are usually a lot clearer. I've noticed this when downloading films from other users also."
