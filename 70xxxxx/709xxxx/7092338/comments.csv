,omegaviper,2012-03-13T07:58Z,@khobQc this isn't the game you dumbass it's mini image so you don't need a crack and can update the game as if you own a official copy.  khobQc are you gay? because I am and I would love to have some gay sex with you while playing the sims
,omegaviper,2012-03-13T08:00Z,this is not connecting to this tracker I have never heard of udp://tracker.ccc.se:80 I have tried many procedures to fix this to no avail.  Why didn't you just use the regular piratebay tracker or open.bittorrent
,omegaviper,2012-03-13T08:05Z,"right click the torrent in your torrent program and edit tracker list and copy and paste this http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce and click add, the torrent will download after you do so"
,Nicki143,2012-04-07T17:42Z,Does anyone know where I can switch out my cracked files for the original non-cracked showtime files? Thanks.

,Phandoraz,2012-06-02T00:19Z,"Hello, I downloaded the mini image for pet. I have the legal copy and the game installed.
I mounted the image in daemon tools lite, but when i try to run the mini image it doesn't work. How come? I know this download is for showtime, but i've been searching on the internet and it's not helping much :/ any help is appreciated.
Thanks in advance and for your upload"
