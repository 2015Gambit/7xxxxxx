[T],FatFreddy473,2012-03-13T20:45Z,raw files are better than converted files
[T],stumpie1971,2012-03-13T21:27Z,"Not If You Use The Right Software ? and people want 320kbps , i was only trying to help :)"
[T],FatFreddy473,2012-03-13T21:49Z,people want 320 kbps because they think it's the best but it's really just the same as 256 kbps
,sthar,2012-03-13T23:38Z,"l3endik got it right.. thanks, great quality!"

,Slindish,2012-03-22T07:03Z,"Cheers for the upload. Stumps, converting is always going to lower the quality. That's a no brainer."

Now please apologize or at least admit you're wrong."
,19kylegreer96,2012-04-23T08:32Z,"shame there is a common misconception in audio quality, guys, a raw 256kbps song from iTunes is better than converting it to 320kbps, it sounds the same, because you can't gain what's not there!  Thanks for the upload, that other guys version sounded like a potato, oh and I'm 15 and I probably know more than he does about audio fidelity :)"
