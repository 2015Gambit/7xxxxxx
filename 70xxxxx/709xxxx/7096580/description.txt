Take a screenshot of your phone's screen. Root is NOT required.
FINALLY, A SCREENSHOT APP THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ROOT
"No Root Screenshot It" is an application that lets you take screenshots of your phone. This application works on ALL phones. Root is NOT required.
This application is for those users who need to take screenshots, but don't have root access to their phones.
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE INSTALLING:
This application will instruct you to download and install a free desktop application on your Windows or Mac. Once installed, you must run the desktop application with your phone attached to your computer. This will enable screenshots on your phone.
Once you've done this, you can disconnect your phone and take screenshots whenever you want. However, every time you restart your phone, you'll have to connect it to your computer and run the desktop application again. If you restart your phone frequently, this app may not be for you, as it may prove to be too inconvenient.
Your phone will NOT be rooted or temp-rooted in any way. No system files on your phone will be altered.
