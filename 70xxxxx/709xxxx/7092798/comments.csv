Thanks for the upload tNe!"

Why are you even on here commenting? We really don't give a shit about your opinion. I'm proud to say that we live in a world where we can illegally download all the copyrighted material we want, and if you don't want it, don't download it. That's freedom. Now go back to watching American Idol while being molested by your Uncle and keep your goddamn freedom of speech to yourself. This isn't the place for it.

Whether you believe all this stuff or not, the best part about this show is that it make you think about it and question the way things are.

@trialNerror
Thanks buddy. Nice up."
