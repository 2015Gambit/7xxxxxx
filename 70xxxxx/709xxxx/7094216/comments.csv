,cur37ious,2012-03-12T04:19Z,"Hey K3, upload whatever you want.  If someone doesn't care for it, they're free to not download it.  In fact, they're free to upload whatever it is that they DO like.  Whining not necessary or appreciated.

If you happen to see EL James - Fifty Shades of Grey in ebook (epub or mobi) format, it would be much appreciated."
,zoebanks,2012-03-12T08:29Z,"Re: Cur37ious.

How dare you suggest that I am whining.

Yes, KK123 can upload whatever they want.  However, I am a fan of classical music which KK123 does not upload.

I love most of the books that are uploaded and rightly praise them but I will not do so for music that I hate.

That is why I wrote what I did you stupid person."

Thanks,she is on the mend now(after catching also the nova virus in the hosp).
but bad news,i can`t find any of Mike Pannett books at all on the net,sorry."
,zoebanks,2012-03-12T19:17Z,"Hello.

Sorry about this but some people think with their mouth rather than their brain.

Hope your wife gets well soon.

I have never asked for music before as I have asked for lots of books.

The only music that I would like if it is available is the Decca Sound box set of 70 cd's or the Toscanini box set which is available this month which is 90cd's.  Otherwise I am fine at the moment with music.

Regards.

[T],karaokeking123,2012-03-12T21:31Z,"zoebanks
am i reading this right? 90cds/70cds?
or 90s--70s.
i don`t know much about this music,but if you give me the precise wording and year i may be able to help."
,zoebanks,2012-03-12T21:56Z,"Sorry.

The Decca Sound is a 50 cd box set and was realeased late last year.

Toscanini Collection is a 85 cd box set but according to Amazon this will not be realeased until mid April.

To include two extra box sets, Piano Masterworks which was realeased by Decca in 2009 is a 50 cd box set and Violin Masterworks also realeased by Decca in 2009 is a 35cd box set if available.

Regards.
