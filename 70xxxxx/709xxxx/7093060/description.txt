Attention please - the encodes use 10-bit H.264 format.
Old H.264 decoders don't work with this and produce corrupt image. You need up-to-date CCCP or FFDShow, CoreAVC 3.0+ or LAV Video decoder. Alternatively MPlayer (July 2011 and newer) or VLC 2.0 and newer. GPU-based decoders *WILL NOT* work - that includes DXVA, VDPAU, the so-called cuda in CoreAVC, or any other hardware decoder. The same goes for standalone players.
