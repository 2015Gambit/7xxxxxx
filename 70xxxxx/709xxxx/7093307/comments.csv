,hawkesk57,2012-03-12T02:33Z,"This torrent change confused me at first, but I switched over to uTorrent and I cannot overstate how much BETTER MY DOWNLOADS HAVE BEEN!!!  Resistance is futile, prepare to assimilate.  ;-)"
,GeniusAnomaly,2012-03-12T18:30Z,"Just use uTorrent for all torrents it works perfectly.

Fuck You westhwood, you fake ass mother fucking troll, Prick!"
,SirScoops,2012-03-12T18:43Z,hopefully this isnt overly liberal/biased.. palin is definitely a fool but so are half of our politicians... like biden..?  also westhwood we at TPB are very sorry u dont know how to download torrents
,OttifantSir2,2012-03-12T20:32Z,"Though ÂľTorrent is good (at least it WAS best, but haven't used it for several years due to it not being available for Linux), there are other very good torrent-programs too. Like Miro (also Web-TV), Deluge, Tribler, KTorrent.
And they are also all of them able to handle magnet-links perfectly."
,hotaru69b,2012-03-12T22:26Z,Is there a tool to convert Magnet links into downloadable .torrents? I'd like a file I can save in order to keep my stuff managed (plus I use DL a magnet link from here - hope I can when I get home.)
,homericICON,2012-03-13T03:46Z,"Magnet links work just fine in both Vuze & Utorrent, but magnet links provide legal distance for TPB in its defence of file sharing and so in that sense are superior."
,fredskidoo,2012-03-13T08:05Z,So does anyone know if this one also has english subs - I mean it premiered on HBO in the states on the 10th so why even upload an english subbed after that - being that it was produced in english. BTW thxs ettv
,JoePlum,2012-03-13T22:56Z,"Let us review. You started by being too stupid to download a torrent which lead you to attack the poster with ""What is your game here?"" People then helped you. You were able to download but then you went into some sort of hissy fit that ended with *you* telling others to grow up. Thanks for the laugh and now go and fuck yourself."

v:I can't vouch for the video because my computer often runs videos choppy even with VLC.

The movie allegedly fills in blanks in a conspiratorial fashion(implying Palin lied about having spoken on the phone to a world leader) but the solid facts they incorporate really make you sympathize with(and laugh at, of course) Palin. For example, her teleprompter really did break in her convention speech. Also the movie paints McCain as the better candidate for president, considering his original intended running mate(I won't spoil). They also include sound bytes from Obama during the campaign that pretty much contradict what has actually happened since, so in a way the movie makes McCain look awesome."
