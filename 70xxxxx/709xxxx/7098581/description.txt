Somalia, 1993: U.S. forces deploy into Mogadishu for Operation Task Force Ranger, and engage in full-scale combat for the first time since the Vietnam war. As a member of the Army Rangers, the elite special operations force, you will engage the fanatical followers of terrorist warlords in a furious battle for control of the city.

Fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow squaddies, you may need to call in air support more than once! Prepare for a challenging campaign in which you will rescue hostages, hunt down terrorist leaders, hit key enemy facilities, and protect supply convoys from hordes of bandits. Get ready for fast-paced, in-your-face combat - in Mogadishu, the action never stops!
