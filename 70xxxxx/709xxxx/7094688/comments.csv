,domino,2012-03-12T16:58Z,all CAMs look bad. thats how the copy is . people should know this by now...

,ofr5555,2012-03-12T21:26Z,The first minute is blurry. The rest of the movie is very watchable. Thank you. I used VLC to improve the audio with the equalizer.  Headphones helped too. A-6 V-7.5  
,dustin5052002,2012-03-12T22:53Z,thanks man 
,rislaz,2012-03-12T23:06Z,"Video 4 sound 5-6 in quality for a cam., I am being truthful as I can be. Personally i would wait for a better release if you realy whant to enyo the effecst and the scenery. This is a sci fi so its important to have these things in order. For example you can hardly recognize the characters faces because of bad quality. I hope this short review was helpful for recognising if this video is your viewing"
,GSavage87,2012-03-12T23:56Z,Thank You HeroMaster.
,rislaz,2012-03-13T00:41Z,"i stand corrected, the movie quality gets better later on video 5-6 watchable. I Still recomend waiting for a better version"
,boomdaniel,2012-03-13T03:58Z,"pretty decent quality, watchable, however, sad the movie isnt as good as i thought. ill give it a 7"
,groudnuty,2012-03-13T06:03Z,acceptable quality and decent Disney movie. Worth spending 2h in front of monitor.
,killinginnocent44,2012-03-13T15:37Z,This cam is crap A=1 V=1 don't bother to download.
,TomiGunz,2012-03-13T17:02Z,it jumps right into the movie. im wondering if heres anything missing from the beginning.
,Jay_20,2012-03-14T02:59Z,Out of any movie iv ever downloaded this had the worst quality. Even for a Cam.

,Big_Mick,2012-03-16T13:30Z,"My issue with the movie isnt about the torrent, i have read the books... WRONG actor for the role of John Carter. just my opinion.

1.3 mbs dl so i got it in a matter of minutes! "
,Big_Mick,2012-03-16T13:55Z,"mars isnt barsoom in the books, m.a.r.s. is a classification of planet types. it isnt our neighboring red planet(in the books) and wrong actor for John Carter"
,elitecrusher,2012-03-17T02:59Z,"This was good. The first five mins is hard to see, but dont let that deter you, it gets better picture wise! Good movie though"
,kensin2011,2012-03-18T01:11Z,"watchable

,N3090n3,2012-03-20T02:29Z,OK rule of thumb if your going to record a 3D movie one must shut off the auto focus so that the 3D may work right also you can not uses divx/xvid on it cuz your lossing frams so the guy did good work you can tell its not his first boot legg but it probably was his first 3D boot legg So remember kiddies you want to boot legg 3D no cams that us divx or xvid turn the auto focus off and you will get nice product. in fact all you want to be boot leggers out there i say go get your self Looxcie 2 and wide angel lens add on open it up cut few led lights so no one around you can tell its on uses the droid app so you can turn the auto focus off well doing 3d get your self 9v battery and regulator on it and usb port that will get you like 20 hours of power for the looxcie as well you could make whole day out of theater hopping and boot legging enjoy the info and uses it well my friends
