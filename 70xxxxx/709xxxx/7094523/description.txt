Our seventh album of deep and mysterious longform ambient music.
A continuous, hour long piece split into eight parts.
Slow, really slow, expansive atmospheres and bells.

The music is generative: 
each note is played in a long loop, the length of each loop if different for each note, so although the music may seem to vary only slightly, it never quite repeats itself.

Again, the songs titles are named after Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) - small planetoids and other objects in our solar system whose orbits are on average greater than that of Neptune.
These objects are in turn named after characters from Greek and Pacific island mythology.
Seven is the last album whose songs will be named in this manner - for now at least. While there are many known TNOs, only a few have been given proper names and I have used them all on these first seven albums!
