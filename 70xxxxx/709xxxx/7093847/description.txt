Rip of the EpixHD live Q&A with Kevin Smith, recorded in 2010 not long after Too Fat For Forty. This is literally live in that Kevin answers questions sent in during the show via Twitter and Facebook - this is simply 45 minutes of Kevin Smith, an iPad and a sofa.

You can actually stream this online without an account etc, but it's always good to have a video rip (plus I didn't even know this existed, it's not listed on IMDb). You can stream it if you'd prefer here: http://www.epixhd.com/kevin-smith/

Ripped direct from the online stream. As with my other Epix rip, the only processing after that was converting the flash video to xvid and remuxing the source audio.
