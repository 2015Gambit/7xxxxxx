Gracie Glam is worried about Joey being deployed, but mostly because she doesn't want him to be lonely for an entire year overseas. She feels it's her patriotic duty to make sure he gets the best send off she can, and this Naughty American is going to take it like a trouper! Joey, stands at attention and gives it his all. It's so much better to make love, not war.
