,oznerol1,2012-04-04T02:19Z,"Indeed, looks like an internal copy got leaked. Especially judging by the Frederator Studios bumper at the end. That doesn't explain the horrible compression though. I'll just wait for it to pop up on my Tivo and watch this on CNHD."
,twrntg2,2012-04-04T10:13Z,"in case you wanted to know, the file was hosted on cartoon network's adventure time page. it had a password box and the password was ooo. i found this from reddit. a few hours after the reddit post the file was removed from the cartoon network website."

Nah but seriously it's okay, the quality's quite bad, but definitely watchable. Thanks ""Danrman"" "
,meowbot,2012-05-03T07:17Z,This was posted before the episode aired.  There should be a better (higher quality) torrent by now (?)
,vududis,2012-05-05T19:10Z,"Apparently the only way to get a decent copy of this episode is the 12GB, 720p torrent of the whole series, which is a  bit of overkill for a cartoon :P"
