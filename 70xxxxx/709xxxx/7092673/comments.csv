,iDiru,2012-04-06T05:59Z,"Um, so, I don't know if I'll get an answer but I can't get this to work. I've read all the instructions in the crack folders. I've copied and pasted all that is to copy, that I know of. But I can't even get past the serial number... I'm putting in the serial it tells me to and it tells me it's wrong. I hit retry and it just goes back to the same screen and wants me to put in the number again. So, it's useless right now.. Help? "
