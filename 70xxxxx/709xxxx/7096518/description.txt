The new Anathema album, leaked on march 12 through spotify. Official release date is april 16.

Please note that the quality of these files is not optimal. The songs were ripped in an unknown lossy format from spotify, and then converted to MP3 at 256kbps, which is again lossy. If a lot of people request this, I can upload the songs in FLAC too, to make sure that the quality is equal to that of spotify. The album will then probably be around 300-400MB.
The songs were separated manually by myself, so small differences with the original album may (and are likely to) exist.
