[V],HobbitGamez,2012-03-16T02:43Z,"@wii-gamer

buy a new tv :P

no but really, you might try to force NTSC in load settings. usually no color is a region problem."
,wii-gamer,2012-03-16T14:05Z,how do i force ntsc....i am using usb loader gx 
,bhutan_6,2012-03-16T19:21Z,"Thx Hobbit, you're the best."
,CrileyC,2012-03-16T22:23Z,"@wii-gamer

you'll find it in the settings of USB loader. just look around in its options and you'll see something similar to ""force NTSC"""
,yungbuk45,2012-03-17T17:26Z,i have a ? im new to this so how do i install usb loader on my wii i also have the homebrew channel already installed i downloaded usb loader and unziped it str8 to the sd card but now what
,superryan,2012-03-18T23:48Z,"I downloaded this and when I put it on my wii with ""Wii game manager"" everything seemed like it worked but when I selected it, the game just dimmed a bit and made a single tone buzz sound and stayed black.

Anything I should do or did wrong? I have a soft modded 4.3u wii NTSC"
[V],HobbitGamez,2012-03-19T00:41Z,"@superryan

use USB Loader GX, scew with the load settings and different cIOS if you have to. Worked for me with default settings though."
,superryan,2012-03-19T18:11Z,"@HobbitGamez

I do use USB Loader GX I ment I loaded the game onto the hard drive with game manager.

All the other games I have on my hard drive work fine except this lol. Don't know if it would work any better but should I burn it to a CD and back it up with USB loader? will try that a little bit later."
,nathanmichaelmoore,2012-03-23T08:28Z,"Just wanted to say thanks hobbit, i have used so many of your torrents and they always work great so thanks for all the great downloads! :)"
,torrentjimmy1,2012-03-23T15:36Z,Quick 2 questions please...NTSC & PAL if you have both copys of the same game do they use the exact same save file? Also for some reason I wonder do PAL voices in game differ from the NTSC games voices. I hope that doesnt sound too bad but a PAL game I got there voices just annoy me like accents im really not used to... Not a hater or anything just curious and if they use the same save file would switching to ntsc change voices...
[V],HobbitTunez,2012-03-24T00:37Z,"@torrentjimmy1

different regions will always create different save files. I don't know if one will overwrite the other (never tried it) but I doubt it. As far as voice acting I am sure it is unique to each game, but most of the time the game creators would not go to such expense as to create two different english language voice casts."
,torrentjimmy1,2012-03-24T16:57Z,"@HobbitTunez

Thanks, altho it makes me wonder if there isnt any change in the game play or voices why sometimes have a 2 year gap from pal to ntsc"
,kaundinya,2012-03-24T19:27Z,i have a problem i have a softmodded 4.3u wii nd i have usb loader gx all small games work fine but when i try to load games like this or call of duty MW3 or wwe 12 it wont work but if i burn it onto a cd it works fine on neogamma what is the problem???
,iamchrislechat,2012-03-29T08:07Z,already got the 4gb version but just saying good job to hobbitgamez for being smart enough to release a WBFS version for once
,username04,2012-04-05T09:18Z,@wii-gamer not sure if you have usb loader but if you do FORCE NTSC or FORCE PAL
,ZombieChaser,2012-04-17T19:42Z,Had to register to say Thank You Very Much an I Really liked how clear your instructions are Thanks agin
,Shiro-Itami,2012-06-26T18:15Z,796 MiB? Whats the catch? Cuz theres a Pal Verson thats 4gb Yea its ISO but... is there any features removed or something?
[H],shirepirate,2012-06-27T23:59Z,"@Shiro-Itami

there's no catch, that's just how large the game is. a disc image ISO is always filled with empty data. New Super Mario Bros Wii is only 352 MiB. Rest assured there is nothing removed from any wbfs torrent, it's the same as a copy you buy at the store

,superseani2,2012-09-04T18:37Z,"wait a minute.... how can this be 796 Mib, i tried to compress the original Wbfs File but i can't make it smaller than 2.32Go"
