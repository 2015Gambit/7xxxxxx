I really thought by now the scene would have given up on this hated MP4"
[V],joshua13,2012-03-13T01:56Z,why hate mp4? the h.264 codec is a great and mp4 is a great container format. why stay in the past?

MP4 does not work in stand alone DVD players; converting is time consuming, and takes more space than just getting avi

I was forced to convert 2 yesterday, one ended up 495, the other 631; with avi they would have been 350 each. "

[V],catflap,2012-03-13T03:06Z,"btw, most new dvd and bluray
players with have ability to play mp4
and mkv. but who wants to go out
to buy a new player?

i have a 3D bluray player that plays
mp4, but but not all mkv files.

my 3D tv has a built-in media player which
also plays most mp4 but not all mkv.

i have 2 dvd HDD recorders that play xvid
and most divx.

so i sometimes have to re-encode to xvid, but
i use freemake video converter and you can
make files the size you want."
,necrofami,2012-03-13T04:24Z,"You should be able to remux an mkv into an mp4 container in less than a minute with the right program, since they both primarily use X264. Of course, an mkv container will handle literally almost any codec you throw at it, and mp4 won't, so that's probably the issue to begin with. You'd lose video quality going from x264 to xvid at the same file size, though.

Also, dude... thanks for this. We can't get Dirk on this side of the pond any other way that."
,doctord2,2012-03-13T07:25Z,"+1 on both E1 and E2, and I hope you upload future episodes. LOVE this show and TYVM for the effort. "
[T],Pongydog,2012-03-14T02:52Z,Thanks for this...but the video quality could have been much better. Not sure why the picture quality is so poor because it has been encoded at a decent bitrate.
