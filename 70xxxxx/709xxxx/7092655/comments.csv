Would be very happy to have a fix if it told me what it was going to fix before I install it into my very hard to recover 54 gig modded FSX .
so if you will tell me what and how it will fix the fatal errors"
,aarque,2012-03-11T01:39Z,"Let me guess: UIAutomationCore.dll. It is only available all over the internet FOR FREE. What about The Pirate Bay attracts lamer would be file share barons? And why do they feel a need to share something that is already freely available, here, of all places..because it is cool? ""It"" meaning TPB, of course, not the file.

Especially love the lame ass meta tags. Way to draw in every possible search term for a useless file and if they didn't hit it on the first ""Microsoft Flight Simulator X,"" just go ahead and throw in two or three extra for good measure.
Please, kill this torrent and bring some valuable content not easily found elsewhere. Thank you so much in advance.

 Looks like the rant is moot, we still need to learn how to point the tracker to the torrent and not the file itself."
,InvisibleGhostSniper,2012-03-11T14:34Z,"Hey aarque, why don't you go fuck yourself, you little whiny bitch cunt. And don't give me the ""I have torrents, you don't"" speech. You just like to pick on people, and be an asshole. If you don't have anything good to say, just't don't comment, you moron. You are NOT TPB sherif."
,FS_Junkie,2012-03-11T16:35Z,"Hey, IGS ... I'm just so in awe of your amazing eloquence. You're not a TPB sheriff either, so get back in your little hole. Dog eat your favourite teddy bear or what?"
,aarque,2012-03-11T19:54Z,"Some people just think they have the right spam the entire internet and ghost fool is essentially saying, ""go ahead and poop in the library."" Well suck some of mine too then ghost fool, who are you to distinguish the difference. TPB has no ""sherif,"" group opinion rules and some things are forbidden even here. Go ahead and cross the line and see where that gets you. 

Besides, this lame torrent isn't even seeding, you got no place better to be?"
,flyerhk,2012-03-12T01:27Z,"Geez, how old are you guys...12 ?

Chill out it's only a damn torrent... just ignore it and move on, no need to act like kids over this...

DC-3 Legends of Flight Expansion Pack Thanks in Advance"
,flyerhk,2012-03-12T21:03Z,"@klipais: what's your purpose? I think the fact that arquee get files from all over the place and bring it here is fine, that way yoou, I and every other leechers don't have to search for those all over the place. Thank him instead, he makes things much more easier for you to get your stuff!
And hey, it's not like it's anyone's stuff, those files were stolen/cracked/distributed in the first place, they are owned by one and only one person: the dev!
Download and enjoy, otherwise just pass, ignore and move on!

Cheers!"
,AeroZoft,2012-03-13T01:15Z,Well said flyerhk.  :-)-{--
,aarque,2012-03-14T05:16Z,"Ya, it's all good. I like to bring stuff from kaskus, those sri lanki dudes are funky, but cool. It's just that, that file share stuff is so transient, there are people still seeding my original torrents, my old torrents practically pre-date megadumpload. And I have brought some originals, my Cessna Conquest was and remains a TPB exclusive - and there is the recent Aerosoft Bronco, now I know that was a world wide first, it came from an inside source close to Aerosoft, and went to The Pirate Bay first. On that occasion, the file share sites were lifting from US.

But hey, it's cool, I like to share, and I think the Bit Torrent protocol, through TPB trackers, is the best way to make timeless shares. People like it, they seed, they don't, it dies. So we get some community input and participation, as well.
Altogether, excellent.
 I know I harsh on the noobs and lamer dudes like this guy, but hey, bring valuable content and I will do what I can to help you get it out there."
