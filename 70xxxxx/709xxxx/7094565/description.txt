Photoshop 10000 Actions Pack 14  of 33 :
----------------------------------------


[NOTE PHOTOSHOP  ACTION FILES HAVE A .atn FILE EXTENSION - So if you see a .atn 

file extension you can be sure that it is a Photoshop Action File]



This series of 33 Plus Pack contains about 10000 Photoshop Actions in total.


How to Create, Use, Alter , Manipulate & Print Action's Manuals are also enclosed.


Remember, due to the vast amount of Photoshop Actions it is quite possible that 

about 5 % of the Actions may have been repeated.


Almost all the actions  are compatible with Photoshop 7 to Photoshop CS 5.1. and 

Win98 to Win7 .Some are not compatible because of change in Commands and 

rearranging of panels from version to version, but such actions are not more than 

5% again.


It is not possible to supply a list of Actions included because the description 

page of TPB will not accept such a huge list and moreover the compilation would be 

a huge task. But, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed :).


In Win 7 Copy / Paste the Action in -  "C:Program Files  Adobe  Adobe Photoshop 

CS5.1  Presets  Actions" Folder.  A similar Folder is available in lower Windows 

OS.


Refer the enclosed manuals on how to work with Action from within Photoshop. I 

must warn you that it can be addictive !



THE  UPLOADS ARE ESSENTIALLY FOR 32  BITS SYSTEMS AND WINDOWS OS ONLY. THEY MAY OR 

MAY NOT WORK ON 64 BITS OR OTHER OS.
