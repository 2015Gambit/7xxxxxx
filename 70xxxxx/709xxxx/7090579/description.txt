This is a remastered edition of the original Phantom Cut of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. This cut has much of the child pandering merchandise making content removed from it. Much of this film is a faithfully matched cut-for-cut of the original Phantom Cut with the exception of the reincorporation of a deleted scene, the removal and replacement of the GOD AWFUL Yoda puppet with a CGI one, slightly altered subtitles, a more condensed version of the Gungan battle against the droids, and even less Jar Jar antics than the original Phantom Cut.

This movie is in a DVD folder format and can be placed on a Dual Layer blank DVD via the shareware program ImgBurn, or played with a media player such as VLC, or Cyberlink PowerDVD.

This movie was edited on a 64 bit Windows 7 machine with 4GBs of RAM, an Intel i7 processor, Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5, and Roxio Creator 2010 Pro. I wish to thank the Phantom Editor and George Lucas (Yes, even him) for helping hobby editors to give their own creative spin on a project.

Sincerely, RemasteredJedi
