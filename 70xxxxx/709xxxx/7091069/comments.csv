logan-x-art yes, the x264 versions are hideous. I welcome the x264 standard but until software and hardware players are better done the xvid versions are a preferred encode.

Consider the xvid version currently has 3000 seeds from 7000 downloads. The x264 version has 220 seeds from 700 downloads. Not hard to choose which is the preferred encode :)"
