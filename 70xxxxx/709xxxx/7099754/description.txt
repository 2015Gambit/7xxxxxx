2HD apparently omitted the nfo for their release of Heartland.s05e16.HDTV.XviD-2HD.avi so here is the file specs and other info. It isn't as fancy as their nfo files are but i also didn't want to give the impression this is my release. I am simply uploading it because in two days noone else has and i am done seeding the Don Cherry mega-bio-pic and Undercover Boss Canada too.
