,justmee1,2012-03-13T18:34Z,THANK YOU SO MUCH!!  Have been waiting on this.  Sure was nice of you to do this.
[T],iamgreat,2012-03-13T18:38Z,"That's what i get for typing the file name instead of copy & paste of it - the mistake is mine. The torrent and the file name should be listed as: 

Heartland.CA.s05e16.HDTV.XviD-2HD

We don't want people thinking this is from the show with Treat Williams as the doctor. I have that if anyone wants it.

Who's gonna ride your wild horses"
,dumbasstheives,2012-03-13T21:34Z,"Not sure what you are talking about. There is a nfo. Maybe your source didn't get it?
"
[T],iamgreat,2012-03-14T12:17Z,"dumbasstheives, it would have been nice if you included a link to it.  One can only check so many dozens of sites looking for a damn nfo file before she says 'ah screw it - odds are if none of them have it then it probably doesn't exist'.  Apparently if i had looked longer i would have found it. How many hours of your life would you have spent looking for an nfo file?  I spent over an hour looking for the nfo and not one nzb site or forum or blog had that little text file.   But they did have the nfo for the 720p release. So i assumed it didn't exist and i wrote my own. Most people don't include them. Most shows have the perk of being uploaded and seeded by eztv or/and ettv. If you want to complain it is really easy to ensure i do nothing which will upset you. 

And if you are the author of the hard-to-come-by nfo then somewhere between you and i it hit a steel-reinforced-brick-wall that the video was able to pass through. :P"
,iqreevo,2012-03-16T00:56Z,um... it would be really great if you guys could tell us how the bloody hell you actually watch this episode. i've clicked the download and get this torrent button and all it's done is download some useless crap to my computer... a little help please!?
[T],iamgreat,2012-03-19T17:31Z,"iqreevo, um... No help for those who don't know how to use the magnet link and can't think of anything better to say than to call it useless crap that i invest my time and small data transfer allocation to bring to those who ask. 

how the bloody hell you actually watch this episode - quite easily. But it only works for those who are not grumpy. There is a special encoding which assesses the emotional state of the viewer.  Seriously, this should play fine in whatever programme you watched the rest of season 5 with. Whether TVTeam or myself upload it is immaterial. "
,JulieTV,2012-06-05T22:29Z,"Hi, Could you make a torrent with the hole season? and if you have the files season  aswell, I know its a lot to ask ;) keep up the great work :D"
