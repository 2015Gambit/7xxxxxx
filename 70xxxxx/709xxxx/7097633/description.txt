Another incredible album by an underrated artist.

Ramones is the eponymously-titled debut studio album by the American punk rock band Ramones. It was released on April 23, 1976 through Sire Records. The band started recording the album in February 1976 and spent an estimated US $6,400. Many recording techniques used for the album were similar to techniques used by The Beatles and orchestral recordings. The album was produced by Craig Leon. The front cover depicts the band members standing in a line leaning against a brick wall. The photograph was taken by Roberta Bayley. The cover art was ranked number 58 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Album Covers. The album reached number 111 in the United States on the Billboard 200 chart and was ranked number 33 on Rolling Stone's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
