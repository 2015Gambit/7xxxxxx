[V],TorrentTracts,2012-03-12T16:00Z,"In another thread, sicanddisturbed recently asked me to torrent Flame's new ""The 6th"" album.  I am more than happy to do that, as well as sharing Flame's other five albums, making his complete six disc discogmaphy available here on The Pirate Bay.

If there's any specific Christian Music that anyone else would like to see shared here, please let it be known.  :)"

[V],TorrentTracts,2012-03-13T14:53Z,"""I keep getting an error when downloading""

I've never personally experienced that error myself, so I did a little research on it for you.  Seems like a relatively easy one to fix.  My suggestion would be to (A) go into your torrent program (B) change the default download location for all your torrents to something new, and then (C) revisit this thread and start a fresh download once again, from scratch.

Once that works, you can complete the download of the torrent and then revisit ""B"" by changing your default location back to what it used to be."
,taylorOE,2012-03-14T03:43Z,you should upload Trip Lee's new album when it drops! I will be sure to come later that day to see what's up with that! you think you can do that for us? :)
,blueget,2012-05-11T23:30Z,"Thank you for all the great uploads, it is really great for me to be able to explore the world of christian music (and interestingly since I started downloading I bought much more CDs than before)

What I would be really interested in are the early Albums of Remedy Drive, back then when their name was ""Remedy"" (and, in the very beginning ""The Aslan Band""). I can't get hold of them (except ""Magnify"", I found that one at a sharehoster and will upload it here if you don't have it)"
