,tibrusjer,2012-03-13T15:30Z,"Haven't got the quests to work properly
Cheack the ownedcore.com forums for updates.

The spells and items seem to work somewhat.
PS: The barbarian leap strike may make you able to jump outside the level."
,tibrusjer,2012-03-13T15:31Z,"Right now it is more of a sandbox than anything else, but I will try to update on this site as often as possible."
,godziothc,2012-03-13T18:58Z,Looks preety legit...was tired of those bitminer fakes
,GObonzo,2012-03-13T22:35Z,"so legit, but doesnt work?"
,degea,2012-03-14T07:30Z,FAKE!!!!
,tibrusjer,2012-03-14T09:17Z,"Fake, really?"
,zhenyerdev,2012-03-14T09:55Z,"Working, but i think i better wait till diablo 3 release cause emulator is...not so cool at the moment)"
,degea,2012-03-14T13:08Z,"tibrusjer if u are stupid...download and install, no problem. off course its FAKE!!!"
,tibrusjer,2012-03-14T13:47Z,"I made this torrent so I'm fortunate to actually not needing to download the torrent, I've installed it and the server works fine."
,tibrusjer,2012-03-14T13:48Z,"Consider this emulator as a sneak peek, it isn't a fully working emulator or game yet, but it will give you a taste of what to come =)"
,Artiscock,2012-03-15T08:26Z,"When I start the D3Launcher and press Local Battle.net after 30 seconds an error message pops up saying ""Locale specific files are missing or failed to connect to Agent. Please reinstall the Game!"". What to do?"
,Artiscock,2012-03-15T14:19Z,"Got it to work by running Diablo III Beta launcher before D3Launcher. It updates the missing files, registry entries etc. But yeah, this version is not worth playing for gameplay. Rather to get basic idea of graphics, interface and controls..."
,yaemhay,2012-03-16T16:01Z,"It works with Mooege, zobies works,few quest and couple skills"
,Rohlland,2012-04-17T20:01Z,"it is WORKING, just do step by step!"
,axinte,2012-07-01T15:27Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "
