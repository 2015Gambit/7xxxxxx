Great PQ as usual with the RUDOS versions.

Only bad part, not the fault of the torrent, uploader or host..Is the fact that it does have a fair few bleeps and sound dips because of the typical spineless nature of American TV! Gets irritating after a while.. 
But NOT the fault of the torrent or anyone whom worked on it."
