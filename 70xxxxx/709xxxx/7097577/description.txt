NOTES:

Bloody sods law...got it all done,they we get some new audio lol.
Well decided to go back to the drawing board and encoded the video again from scratch,think its better now than before.
Still missing all them secs in 9 different places.
Audio we were given was meant too sync'd....but wasnt for me,so had to resync it all again ARGHHH!!
Anyway due to the audio have parts where the video was there etc...i had to do a total of 30 cuts to get this to fit and in 3 spots had too use the old audio.
But at least now any grp can use this audio too fit over the Russian release
