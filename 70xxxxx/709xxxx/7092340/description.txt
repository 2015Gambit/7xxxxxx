On November 5, 1975, a group of loggers in the mountains of northeastern Arizona observed a strange, unusually bright light in the sky. One of those men, Travis Walton, recklessly left the safety of their truck to take a closer look. Suddenly, as he walked toward the light, Walton was blasted back by a bolt of mysterious energy.

His companions fled in fear. When they reported an encounter with a UFO ΓÇö something they would have considered impossible if they had not witnessed it themselves ΓÇö the men were suspected of murder. For five days authorities mounted a massive manhunt in search of Walton ΓÇö or his body. Then Walton reappeared, disoriented and initially unable to tell the whole story of his terrifying encounter.

In Fire in the Sky Travis Walton relates in his own words the best documented account of alien abduction yet recorded, the story of his harrowing ordeal at the hands of silent captors and his return to a disbelieving world of hostile interrogators, exploitative press and self-styled "debunkers." Travis recounts the struggle to get a fair hearing, and confronts his detractors with a stinging rebuttal.

Now, the real story behind the hit movie from Paramount ΓÇö a detailed expose of the campaign to suppress Walton's story, and first-time revelations of startling new developments.
