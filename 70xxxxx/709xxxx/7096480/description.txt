  'The only thing that will stop you from    
  fulfilling your dreams is you" People      
  have dreams, but not all of us have the    
  guts to put faith in ourselves. Most of    
  us lose focus and give up. We are most     
  afraid to believe in our own dreams.       
  Those who do are the true winners. This    
  slice of life film is set in the backdrop  
  of our capital city- Delhi. A city that    
  brings in thousands of North Indians in    
  search of opportunities that was never     
  available in their own home towns. Like    
  -wise, six boys from different states come 
  together to share a two BHK apartment in a 
  middle-class colony, which they lovingly   
  call "Sadda Adda". This film is their story
