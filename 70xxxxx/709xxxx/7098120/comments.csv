,LazarusL,2012-03-13T08:30Z,Would any of the 100 seeders perhaps care to offer a comment?  A/V quality?  Is it a cam?  Is the movie any good?
,brendaleyland,2012-03-13T09:39Z,LazarusL why gont you download and tell us? Why does it have to always be someone else?
,RumataDEstor,2012-03-13T10:19Z,it's no good anyway. Want at least a dvdrip!
,RumataDEstor,2012-03-13T10:21Z,It's no good
,DerpaHerps,2012-03-13T10:26Z,Its a cam not dvd checked the sample
,lizmm,2012-03-13T10:46Z,The uploader clearly states it is a TS. A TS is a CAM thatÂ´s been cleaned up a bit.
,asdfkjjj,2012-03-13T12:03Z,"TELESYNC is  normally filled in an empty theater and has audio recorded from an external source, like a headphone jack provided for the hearing impared. Typically this provides MUCH better audio and CAM typical video without people standing up or making noise throughout the film.  Uploaders seem to have forgotten what the diff rips actually mean."

,saint84,2012-03-13T13:08Z,video not bad for a cam . however 12 mn cut off from the movie . that's a lot it seems. is suppose this is the source from the russian video . would hoe for a larger file with better bitrate and mabe somebody add the 12 mn missing from the movie 
,nilocrepooh,2012-03-13T13:14Z,@asdfkjjj its because either they are noobs OR snotty little shits that have had mommy do everything for them all their short little lives. I see all sorts of shit on here like ppl requesting movies and the like (as if the uploader gets some financial benefit from it). they do this because they love file sharing- nothing more. so to all the dickhead losers out there that are never happy with anything.....dont bite the hand that feeds.
,RumataDEstor,2012-03-13T15:17Z,"I wonder, who would suffer to watch a movie, which is all about computer graphics and special effects in such a low quality? Thanks for the upload though. This is the 5th release of John Carter I'm downloading, but I'll wait untill better quality is available"
,Play4263,2012-03-13T15:20Z,"A-6 V-4
Video is a little washed out and zoomed in.  Ok if you're desperate.  Thanks LegendET"
,joegreg13,2012-03-13T15:43Z,why do we have over 20 copies of the same source. It sucks and we know it

,greasygas,2012-03-14T03:34Z,"good thing yaal made comments finally ! mine is that pirate bay rocks ! donate now! and donate often!  I will too, and now for my comment the quality seems  watchable  which i will now do thanks PB!"
