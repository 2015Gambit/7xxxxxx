,voltrix128,2012-03-11T05:33Z,"OMG this doesn't work!!
I can't find any train or route of this addon!!"
,bones2904,2012-03-11T06:19Z,"Thanks again, love your work."
,Budge44,2012-03-11T06:22Z,The Trains etc are in the editor because i've used both the BR151 blue and cream and the wierd looking BR323 shunter in free roam. Its the 6 scenarios that are supposed to be with this addon that are missing.
,Budge44,2012-03-11T06:45Z,3 scenarios for Hagen-Siegan route and 3 for Seebergbahn route. Thanks for your downloads though tpb_4_ever.

,Ajaywarik,2012-03-11T10:58Z,"hey when i extracted the file, the file is not opening n its showing .rwp extention. So how should i open it plee help"
,gamer2010,2012-03-11T14:48Z,can t find train in the game??
,tpb_4_ever,2012-03-11T14:52Z,"@Ajaywarik, Open railworks and use package manager,"
,gamer2010,2012-03-11T19:08Z,i installed it with package manager and still can t find the train
,voltrix128,2012-03-11T21:27Z,Can you upload the 6 scenarios that are missing??
,voltrix128,2012-03-11T21:29Z,Can you upload the 6 scenarios that are missing???
,Ajaywarik,2012-03-12T01:04Z,There is no railwork or someting like that where can i find it @tpb_4_ever
,showitoff,2012-03-13T20:09Z,"From what i have read in other railworks downloads....alot of these ripped activities and rolling stock wont work if your hooked into steam.
Also its good to read up or get to know the game software your dealing with so no issues like with unpacking the RWP in package manager...RWP files are just like a zip files but can only be opened in Train sim. tpb 4 ever does a great job of uploading these files. Everything i have got from him works like a dream....if you follow the directions!"
,tpb_4_ever,2012-03-13T20:44Z,"Make sure that you run this in the skidrow version of Railworks. All the trains and scenarios are there.

Go here to see what is included : steampowered.com/app/65249/"
,Budge44,2012-03-14T02:31Z,"Im using Skidrow 11.0b of version of TS2012, not hooked into steam either. If you check package manager and highlight the DB Freight addon after installing the .rwp file all you have installed is an ""Assets"" dir with all the  trains and rolling stock in it. There is no ""Routes"" dir installed which is where the scenarios are kept.
    Just cant seem to get this one working tbp_4_ever apart from editing a free roam scenario and adding trains and rolling stock that way."
,tpb_4_ever,2012-03-14T17:21Z,The routes are default so they're not included as they should be there anyway.  The routes are Hagen-Siegen and Seebergbahn
,voltrix128,2012-04-03T06:51Z,"I found the missing scenarios!!!!

,voltrix128,2012-04-03T06:52Z,Replace the first / with .
,Budge44,2012-04-08T22:09Z,"Just noticed your link voltrix128, just downloaded scenarios and working fine. Many thanks"
,voltrix128,2012-04-09T04:04Z,"No problem, i'm here for help!"
,piaopiao,2012-05-04T05:19Z,@voltrix128 the scenarios link is dead. >_
,Dirrrrt,2012-05-21T19:58Z,How can I hook the Skidrow version into the Steam version?
,chegsdf,2012-09-02T20:05Z,"The link for the scenarios work. Change the ""/"" into a dot.

And Dirrrt, you can't use these on Steam."
