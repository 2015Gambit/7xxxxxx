Lions In The Street is a band from Vancouver, Canada. Started in 2006 by Chris (guitar and vocals), Sean (guitar), Enzo (bass) and Jeff (drums), four real lovers of 70s rock. They are an essential group for fans of records such as ΓÇ£It's Only Rock & RollΓÇ¥ by The Rolling Stones, ΓÇ£Shake Your Money MakerΓÇ¥ by Black Crowes or the classics of Neil Young. After a first mini-LP from 2006 titled ΓÇ£Cat Got Your TongueΓÇ¥, in 2010 they self-released their first LP, a self-named debut album with a handful of tracks that ride between the dirtiest blues with touches of country and the most savage rock. Pure and hard Rock'n'Roll to dance and sweat to.
