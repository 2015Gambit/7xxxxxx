I've been using this myself, it works perfectly fine except for the "no-body" bug in character-creation menu.
Don't worry that bug won't be seen again.

Guide:

1. unpack .exe to your game dir (where your TERA-Launcher.exe is located)

2. run as admin (vista and 7 users) and press "Patch it!"
   (allso you might wanna check the little box to make an easy backup of files)

3. wait a few seconds and you're done! :)

Please note that i don't know for how long this version (v0.1) will work.

File has been scanned with WinClam and has done no damage to my computer,
but keep in mind if you get a warning from your own anti-vidus that this is
a file to edit other files, there "might" contain strings that are considered a threat by your AV, but don't you worry about it.

Please seed, my broadband sux balls!
