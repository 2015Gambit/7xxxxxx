,ev1lbetty,2012-03-21T18:15Z,also there is absolutely nothing in the download. i really love this comic please 
,Face113,2012-06-19T05:00Z,I'll seed for a week after I finish downloading. Does anyone have issue #22?
,Face113,2012-06-19T06:13Z,Please seed. Stuck at 35.8%
,iamokaw,2012-06-20T18:26Z,"Betty, what do you mean there's nothing in it? It's 360MB; there's gotta be SOMETHING in it..."
,Face113,2012-06-24T03:55Z,Betty is wrong. The CBRs are in there. Unfortunately the seeding sucks and i will probably never finish the download.
,iamokaw,2012-08-20T20:11Z,"I've had this thing on my seedbox for MONTHS and 24/7 it's still at 35.8%. I've shared at a ratio 30.663.

I REALLY wish someone would make a new torrent of this; I don't think this one will ever complete..."
