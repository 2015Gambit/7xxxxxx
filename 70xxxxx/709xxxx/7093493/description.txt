Beth Tacular and Phil Moore ΓÇô a nature-loving, woods-dwelling, earnestly creative pair who comprise two-thirds of indie folk trio Bowerbirds ΓÇô are not the sort of couple on whom you'd wish calamity. But when the result of broken ribs, serious illness, break-up and reconciliation is an album as gorgeous as this, you half-wish the hardships keep coming. Their songs on this, their third record, are more expansive, bolder and stranger than those that have come before: like life, they're also messy and loosely formed, swelling and subsiding in ways that sound both slapdash and irresistibly serendipitous.
