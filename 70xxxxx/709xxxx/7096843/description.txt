Housetrends Magazine features articles on home building and remodeling, kitchens, baths, gardens and a database of professionals who provide home services. Housetrends is an idea that grew from a single magazine published in Dayton, Ohio into an ever expanding group of magazines in five markets. Launched in 2001, Dayton was quickly followed by Cincinnati, Ohio, Tampa Bay, Florida, Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Each city was chosen for its own unique sense of style and regional personality. Every Housetrends issue displays the vibrancy and creativity of the marketΓÇÖs community of residents and home & garden professionals.
