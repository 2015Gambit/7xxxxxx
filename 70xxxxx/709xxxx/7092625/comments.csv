,mrgold76,2012-03-11T20:49Z,"Thank you!
Will try this :)"
,President_Kush,2012-03-13T15:48Z,"Just installed.  Used first Key and everything Is  working fine as of now.  

The key is a file.  During Install, It will give you a few options, choose ""from file"" (thinks its 2nd one) then browse to location of download and open the ""Key"" file and continue to install. 

Not to sure I like the firewall.  Used to use Norton and everytime ANY program tried to access the internet it would ask me to allow/deny/create rule (to automatically always allow).  Opened torrent client and it didn't even ask for permission.  

I don't know... will probably buy norton internet security 2012 when I have an extra $20.  anyways... thanks thumper"
,tr99tr,2012-03-13T23:47Z,you can set this firewall to allow/deny everything

,neelbhai,2012-03-21T07:50Z,Does it update?? or will the update catch that it is pirated??
,Killadown1,2012-03-23T22:51Z,"Excuse me sir, i would like to only got the key of this torrent, can you please, upload only the key? I would really appreciate, thank you."
,annspain,2012-03-25T07:19Z,"Thank you so much for this. As soon as it went live it found threats to my computer which I have now sorted, these never showed up with the free version.
Having never opened a key from a file before I found it a little confusing, and that's only because I didn't read the instructions properly.
Thank you again, it works a treat"

,itworks22,2012-04-17T11:49Z,"Ran with this OK for a month - but today it's come up with:

ILLEGAL copy - it will be closed down - renew at 50% reduction"
,LSO44,2012-04-17T12:34Z,"I'm getting the same as itworks22. Not sure whether this is just a scare tactic to get us to pay, avast still seems to be working."
,irmitarosa,2012-04-17T12:59Z,"Just installed it, updated, seemed to be working fine but just as itworks22 I am getting now the following message from Avast:

ILLEGAL copy - it will be closed down - renew at 50% reduction"
,jesster,2012-04-17T21:33Z,Same problem too. it says illegal but it was still working. I know your torrents are good.  and I know you can find solution for this sir. thanks a lot. oh I downloaded you Smith Micro Anime Studio super fast download thanks man
,GearHead3,2012-04-18T00:13Z,"same problem here, two laptops popped up the same message after updating. still seems to work for now. agree with jesster, your torrents are always terrific. hope a fix comes out soon."

These license works fine..."
,daemon1100,2012-04-18T16:01Z,"the 2 keys in this torrent are flagged, use DarthXP's avast keys link above ^"
,JAYO1601,2012-04-21T19:27Z,It was working for a few weeks then avast sent me a message saying this is an illegal copy so i stopped using it
,Somacruz_92,2012-04-22T11:43Z,"Happy if the other key works, as long as Avast doesn't keep minimizing my WoW while I'm healing."
,MrDumbAss,2012-04-26T05:32Z,"It shows illegal copy pop-up once in about 2 hr, I just close it. It is not stopping any security services as of now."
,pile_19x,2012-04-27T00:03Z,hey guys i need an advise..... avast sent me a message saying this is an illegal copy.. IS this serious ??? 
,jaxus,2012-05-14T11:04Z,"hello to all!
the message avast has sent about the illegal version is not a problem with this torrent, but as I saw, avast has sent it to anyone who has any type of ""illegal"" copy of avast... it seems that they begun researching about ""illegal"" copies"
,ato080,2012-05-17T18:24Z,"Every license file I try is ""banned.""  Maybe need to think about putting in a fresh copy."
,ato080,2012-05-17T18:25Z,"After a while, they'll refuse to update your virus list."
,dsacxzasd,2012-05-21T01:30Z,http://www.multiupload.nl/NGOGA44QQ1 Patch still working
