,ChillReb,2012-03-12T23:32Z,When I try to open the game it says game was purchased thru the App Store using another computer and it needs the Apple ID and password used to purchase it... It gives the Apple ID but I take it you don't want to give us the password...

,ChillReb,2012-03-16T14:15Z,@WinterGale: I don't have any Paid For Apps from The App Store as of now... That's what I come to PirateBay for... LOL.... But I did try what you explained in your last comment with a free downloaded Apps MasReceipt... It was real easy to do... Didn't work though... Told me the game was Damaged afterwards... But that's not to say it won't work with an actual Purchased MasReceipt... I will hold on to the game until I finally break down and hand over some of my Hard Earned cash to Apple and try it again... LOL... Game looks like a lot of Fun... Thanx...
