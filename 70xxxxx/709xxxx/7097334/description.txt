Jim Ford is the mythic artist behind 1969's legendary country soul album Harlan County. After recording his sole album he hung out with Sly Stone and wrote for artists and friends like Bobby Womack, PJ Proby, The Temptations & Nick Lowe before completely disappearing from the scene in a haze of drugs and irrational behavior. When BEAR FAMILY managed to track Ford down in 2006 he was living in North California in a simple mobile home loaded with reel to reel tapes and cassettes. Some of these masters were included by BEAR FAMILY on popular anthologies like Sounds Of Our Time and Point Of No Return. This brand new CD, Demolition Expert (Ford was a demolition expert when stationed in Germany during his stint in the U.S. Army), sets focus on Jim Ford's acoustic home sessions, containing 29 previously unreleased acoustic recordings. It is a unique opportunity for the listener to hear Jim's creativity flow. You're invited to Jim Ford's living room to witness him come up with some truly soul shattering musical moments. Many tracks on this anthology would be potential hits in the hands of today's artists. You will also hear Jim be interrupted with drug deals on the phone and friends chattering and singing along. The recordings are a welcome and essential addition to any Jim Ford collection. Liner notes by singer, songwriter, musician, artist (and Jim Ford fanatic) Jeb Loy Nichols.
