This should be a revelation for mathematics undergraduates. Having evolved from RundeΓÇÖs notes for an introductory topology course at the University of Alberta, this essential text provides a concise introduction to set-theoretic topology, as well as some algebraic topology. It is accessible to undergraduates from the second year on, and even beginning graduate students can benefit from some sections. The well-chosen selection of examples is accessible to students who have a background in calculus and elementary algebra, but not necessarily in real or complex analysis. In places, RundeΓÇÖs text treats its material differently to other books on the subject, providing a fresh perspective.
