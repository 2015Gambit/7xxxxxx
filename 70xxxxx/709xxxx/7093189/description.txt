NOTE FOR MY MOVIE TORRENTS: Each movie has been hashed with an MD5 checker and I am listing the hash below. MD5 programs are designed to verify data integrity using the MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) 128-bit cryptographic hash. MD5 hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and authenticity.
In terms of integrity, an MD5 hash comparison detects changes in files that would cause errors. The possibility of changes (errors) is proportional to the size of the file; the possibility of errors increase as the file becomes larger. It is a very good idea to run a MD5 hash comparison check when you have a large file such as a movie or.iso downloads.
