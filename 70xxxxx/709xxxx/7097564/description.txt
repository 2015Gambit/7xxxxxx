The Manhattan Transfer is an American vocal music group. There have been two manifestations 
of the group, with Tim Hauser being the only person to be part of both. The group's name 
comes from John Dos Passos' 1925 novel Manhattan Transfer and refers to their New York origins.


This album began a new era for the group: This album was the first one with Cheryl Bentyne
who replaced Laurel Mass√©. It was also the first album that contained songs that were hits 
in both the jazz and pop categories. The disco hit song Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone reached 
#12 on Billboard's Disco chart, and on the Hot 100 reached #30. "Trickle, Trickle" reached 
#73 on the Billboard Magazine's Hot 100 chart. Overall, the album reached #55 on the 
Billboard Magazine Top LPs chart.

The most widely known song from this album, Joe Zawinul's "Birdland," won the group its first 
Grammy Award for Best Jazz/Fusion Performance, Vocal or Instrumental in 1980. Jon Hendricks 
wrote lyrics for the vocalese version on the album and Janis Siegel received a Grammy for her 
vocal arrangement of "Birdland". Eddie Jefferson was writing the new lyrics for the song 
"Birdland" but he was killed before finishing them. This album is dedicated to him. "Birdland" 
was the most played Jazz track in 1980 and many regard "Birdland" as the "signature song" of 
the group.
