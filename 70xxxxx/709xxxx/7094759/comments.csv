[T],iamgreat,2012-03-12T07:23Z,despite the odd name of the file this is the 2HD release of the episode. 
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T08:06Z,"really.. how come he didnt add to TPB then?

i hate tags.. you dont see me messing up a filename

i always rename the files I source or convert thats just how it is

if cappers are so fragile then they should upload as soon as rip them right

rather then just adding to usenet

i put ref its was 2HD  if makes happier.. sigh 

i dont mess about with big descriptions as people want it sooner too

thats life"
,dumbasstheives,2012-03-12T09:12Z,"Because 2HD is a scene group, not a P2P  uploader. Scene groups don't want their files to hit P2P but they do anyway. Your not going to see a username 2HD on TPB.

Atleast show some respect to the people you steal from and let their files be named how they named them.

[V],psspss,2012-03-12T10:30Z,"darn piraters want respect LOL

geeh some many rules huh

well atleast with tahs the fbi will know who to arrest in the raids :D"
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T10:33Z,"leaving in tags defacing names is nothing to do with respect.. anyhow how lame

and why dont they release to p2p.. what a ahole way huh
and you expect respect.. then release then to p2p
for all to get"
[V],psspss,2012-03-12T11:26Z,"piraters that break the rules but want you to follow
there rules.. 

one word - ironic

like my own local and streamed rips.. i dont care
what peiople do with them.. its their bandwidth
and like once anything is on the web
people choose to do whatever they want with it

keep the web free and free of rules.. :/

anyhow enough of this BS

they cant even provide xvids and form mp4s
they sure earned the respect all these so called
groups of teeny rippers"
