Even though I am leaving my macbook on 24/7 uploading this I only have 384 kbit upload, so if you have a decent upload speed please leave this torrent seeding once you have finished downloading. I think all mac users who like strategy/sci-fi should get a chance to play this classic in its native mac form :) Thanks."
,ryballs,2012-03-11T06:30Z,"For NEW PLAYERS Only: To start a game on Easy with Tutorial click [Start Game] followed by [Make Random Map] then choose the size of your planet (I personally prefer HUGE ;p) then choose [Citizen] and [Standard Rules]. Select [Play Random Faction] until you work out your favourite faction. Once you have entered your name and clicked OK your dropship will land, starting your first colony. Now just click [Tour] to begin the tutorial!"

,vascoinha,2012-03-12T07:24Z,"thanks for upload, but this is only for classic, not for osx (especially not lion), right?"
,vascoinha,2012-03-12T07:30Z,"thanks for upload, but this is for classic/os9 only, not for osx (especially not for lion), right?"
,ryballs,2012-03-12T09:42Z,"vascoina: Good question. The instructions I gave in the description are for OSX (tested on Snow Leopard, should work on Lion) but there is also the Classic mac app in the same folder."
,vascoinha,2012-03-12T10:54Z,"@ ryballs:
due to the leck of support for power-pc-progs smac doesnt work in lion.
as i love the game i was hoping you ""modded"" it somehow in order to make it run again.
thanks anyway.  :-) "
,ryballs,2012-03-12T11:18Z,"vascoinha: Yes you are totally right, this works in Snow Leopard and Classic but not Lion due to its dependancy on Rosetta. If I find a workaround for this I will let everyone know."
