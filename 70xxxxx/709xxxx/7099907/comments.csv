,opaleg,2012-03-13T22:44Z,"This game runs SO SLOWLY! I can Run Mass Effect 3 and others on high.. and with graphics this bad, the slow pace AND frames per second is not a good sign.

Probably bad coding practice. I do not recommend this game for it's technical side.. but it may be worthwhile otherwise."
,Technew11,2012-03-13T23:12Z,Thanks for the upload man! Downloading right now!
,rhinowar,2012-03-14T16:04Z,"These games are hilarious,  I mean on the first mission I get to the first location and am told to check on patient...well thats good but you can't find the patient. lol  and forget about going to options to check on which keys do what...nope none.  

Now I want a sim for the fast paced world of flyer delivery or even better postal delivery.
mmmmmmmmmmmmmm postal"
