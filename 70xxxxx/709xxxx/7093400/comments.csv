There seems to be some problems with 
Renaissance. There are a lot of random words and letters input randomly into different sentences making it hard to read.

The Secret Crusade and Brotherhood are both perfect without any errors."
,qretzu,2012-03-24T21:25Z,"Thx for the notice.

The problem exists in all formats, or just in a few?"
,patient67,2012-09-17T18:12Z,"Renaissance is horribly translated by someone called Isabel Murillo, which is weird because it was written in English by an Englishman. it's not that the files are somehow corrupted, it's the actual translation. the two first sentences:
""Shining and flickering torches on the top of the towers of the Palazzo Vecchio, the Bargello, and only a few lanterns Destedresser was in the cathedral square, slightly towards the north. Some more lighted docks along the banks of the Arno River where late it out for a city where most people would retire to his home with the arrival of the night, were distinguished in the darkness a few sailors and longshoremen.""
the fuck."
,qretzu,2012-09-18T03:20Z,"I admit, it's true, sorry that I was hasty and didn't give a heads up. As soon as I'm gonna find a better version of Renaissance, I'll make a new pack, together with Revelations and Forsaken."
