Bill Conroy of narconews.com joins us to discuss the various gun-walking programs that have been employed by the ATF to allow guns to be shipped into the hands of the Mexican drug cartels, from the Bush-era Wide Receiver program to the Obama-era Fast and Furious program. We talk about new reports that US troops are being deployed on the border to deal with the increasingly deadly drug gangs, and what people can do to change the course of this disastrous drug war.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
