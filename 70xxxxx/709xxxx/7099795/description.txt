This modern day branch line in North East England stretches from the market town of Bishop Auckland to Darlington, with its East Coast Main Line station, and is part of the famous Stockton and Darlington Railway which opened in 1825. It also features the 'Prince of Wales' Shildon tunnel, which opened in 1842; at three quarters of a mile in length, it is the oldest working railway tunnel under a settlement in the world.
