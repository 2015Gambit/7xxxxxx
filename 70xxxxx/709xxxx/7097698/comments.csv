,mobno1,2012-04-07T20:54Z,Is it problem if ESET warns me that the keygen is a virus?
,aehsani18,2012-04-26T19:44Z,"I got a virus warning and I've ignored the warn.
But afterentering SN it wants to activate from net.

How to solve this one?"
,aehsani18,2012-04-26T19:53Z,"Foud it!

Press the Manually Active, then copy the XML that it generates and paste it into keygen to get a registration code!

Wheres that manually active option? "
,NikonTheThird,2012-09-08T18:33Z,"This torrent is fine. It even updates to the newest Version v7.6 of Reflector without problems.

Instructions:
* Download
* Realize that the Virus warning is of type Win32.keygen (and therefore harmless)
* Disconnect from the internet (so you will see the ""Manually Activate"" button aehsani18 mentioned
* Extract Reflector and run Reflector.exe
* A wild Activation Dialog appears
* Run the Keygen and select Edition: VS
* Insert a generated Serial into the Dialog
* Wait for the online activation to fail
* Click the ""Manually Activate"" button
* Copy the XML into the upper Textbox of the Keygen
* Copy the generated response into the Dialog
* Activation successful!

After a restart, Reflector said an update was available (v7.6 for free), so I installed it and it works just fine.
Hope this helps :)"
,sweaterpuppies1,2012-09-14T04:06Z,Is it safe to re-enable internet connection on that PC after the manual activation?
,NikonTheThird,2012-09-17T22:48Z,"@sweaterpuppies1: Yep, once it's activated you can do whatever :)"
