,popeye013,2012-03-10T15:05Z,Does this have the sound dips in it like the RUDOS version or is it clear of them? 
,dohertyben,2012-03-10T20:03Z,"There are no audio problems, the sound dips are the producers censoring bad language. 

Pretty ****** ridiculous that they ****** couldn't ***** edit it in a ***** way that ***** avoided ****** swearing.... 
It gets really ***** annoying after the first ***** ten ****** minutes

A9 V5 - not the usual crisp picture from TvTeam, but thanks for the fast upload "
,popeye013,2012-03-10T21:20Z,"Yeah i knew it was the live editing of the swearing, i was just wondering if this one had that irritating sound dips in it or was a clear version, but ohwell. Thanks anyway mate"
