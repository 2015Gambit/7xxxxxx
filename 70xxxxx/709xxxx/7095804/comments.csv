[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-13T18:49Z,"...and I'm sorry:

,QborT,2012-03-13T21:26Z,"Actually the title should be: The Grey 2012 720p RC BRRip H264 AC3 ... Region C Russian source, not a proper."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2012-03-13T22:47Z,"@QborT :

Since the Blu-Ray RA or RB has not been released the source I used should be an RC  [ The.Grey.2012.1080p.BluRay.x264-xiaofriend ] as I mentioned...


....but  a very good one RC Blu-Ray  !!


P.S. You should appreciate/comment the quality and not the title or the source !!

P.P.S. About the source you are more then probably right.

How about the quality ???"
,pezed,2012-03-21T06:03Z,"Thank You. Nice quality at only 1.76 g's
You rock."
,mojowoikin,2012-03-22T09:00Z,"Thanks Cody! Great quality, just a couple seconds here and there where the quality seemed to drop just a little, but otherwise great. Could be just my player too.

A9
V9
M7.5 

Lots of people hated the ending of this movie but I would rather have that kind of ending than some super unbelievable Hollywood heroic ending. A good flick."
,pezed,2012-03-27T20:30Z,Very Very Very Niiiiiice. Thank you.
