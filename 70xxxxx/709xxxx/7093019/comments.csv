only info I found on it.. no wiki on it by looks


PAWNATHON CANADA is an exciting four-day event taking place April 1-4 in Toronto. Attendees will be offered a free appraisal on their prized items, and the opportunity to potentially sell their treasures to a Pawn Master. Expert appraisers will be on site to look at every item, and participants may be filmed to appear in PAWNATHON CANADA, a new special airing on History Television in summer 2011. The most extraordinary items - based on history, mystery and value - will be included in a bidding war where Pawn Masters will go head-to-head in a battle to outbid each other for the most coveted items. Please visit www.pawnathon.com to pre-register for the event"

[V],psspss,2012-03-12T10:36Z,"i think some vlc real time audio tweaks can improve it

but its no biggy better then not seeing it at all.

some streams are poorly done and others better
depends if they do mp4s or FLV 

they cant even get the filenames right on their own commerical videos on some of the sites which is funny!"
