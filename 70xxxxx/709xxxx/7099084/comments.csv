A dark spot here or there but the movie is good rip though none the less. so I can give a V:6 A:6

Worth the time for the movie for a decent cam."
,TwilightGozen,2012-03-22T07:16Z,"So over all the video quality seems decent enough; It's watchable and you can hear it quite well. Naturally its a bit fuzzy being a cam but I've seen a lot worse.
A: 7
V: 6"
