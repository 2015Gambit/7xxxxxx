              Wrath Of Grapes | The Don Cherry Story 2 | part 2


This second part of the sequel to the Don Cherry biopic from 2010 was broadcast 4 March 2012 on CBC. 


ABOUT THIS TV MOVIE
Wrath Of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II tells the story of Cherry's later years and his evolution into one of Canada's cultural media icons, with Jared Keeso reprising his Gemini Award-winning performance as the host of Coach's Corner. 

No one thought the newly-unemployed coach of the Colorado Rockies would last more than a few weeks as a CBC commentator in 1980, never mind eventually be voted number seven on the all-time list of great Canadians.

Wrath Of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II uncovers who Don Cherry really is, the events that shape his past and the key moments in his life that allow him to continue to stay relevant to people today. More than just a broadcaster, Don is controversial, populist, politically involved, a supporter of the troops, and a figure who stirs up emotions of all kinds everywhere he goes.

Wrath Of Grapes: The Don Cherry Story II will explore the impact Don's outspokenness has had on his Coach's Corner platform, and the attempts that have been made to curb his opinionated nature.
