Freddie Hart had been recording for almost twenty years before his 1971 hit `Easy Loving' climbed the charts to number one and gave him Song Of The Year 
in 1971 and `72. This collection brings together his very early catalog of Capitol and Columbia recordings from 1953-1961 including his first major hit 
'The Wall' from 1959. Also included is Freddie's composition `Loose Talk' that was a hit for Carl Smith in 1955 and was also recorded in 1961 by 
Buck Owens and Rose Maddox. Among Freddie's country material are two rockabilly sides `Dig Boy Dig' and `Snatch It And Grab It' recorded in 1956. 
Sadly they didn't catch on at the time, but highly praised by collectors making them rockabilly classics. This is the same year that he recorded 
`Blue` & `Drink Up And Go Home' a great catchy classic honky-tonker. The bluesy 'Baby Don't Leave' has such a unique guitar solo, it would have been a 
great song for Elvis. Freddie's version of Harlan Howard's `Chain Gang' is fantastic and was recorded a few years before Johnny Cash's version from his 
"Blood Sweat And Tears" LP. Freddie's songs were recorded by Patsy Cline, Lefty Frizzell, George Jones, Bob Luman, and Kenny Rodgers 
just to mention a few.
 
There are several previously un-issued songs like `Dance And Sing', `From A Boy To A Man', `Loving In Vain', `I'm Gonna Live For Today'and
`Do My Hear A Favor'. The title track `Juke Joint Boogie' and `Heart Trouble' were originally released on LP in the 1970's but they were in electronic 
stereo. Here we have them straight from the excellent original mono masters. Some of the musicians backing Freddie on this disc include Wesley Tuttle, 
Cliffe Stone, Joe Maphis, Jimmy Byrant, Merle Travis, Johnny Bond, Floyd Cramer, Grady Martin, Hank Garland, Bob Moore and Hargus "Pig" Robbins.
