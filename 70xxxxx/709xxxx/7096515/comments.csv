Do you think thereÂ´s a chance you could upload Project Runway All Stars? seems like nobody is uploading working avi files :("
,notchjohnson1,2012-03-13T03:46Z,MKV? dude wtf... whats with everyone uploading bullshit ass formats all the sudden for shows? are you too lazy to upload AVI now? the fuck uses mkv for ANYTHING?!?!
,frumpypanda,2012-03-13T06:10Z,"great job with all your uploads.

if cockmasters have a problem with MKV, perhaps they should complete the 30 second install of the vlc player.

works great!
supreme quality!"

You need to stop whining; get VLC to play this. In fact, the comments page isn't for bitching, it's for commenting IMHO. 

Don't diss the uploader for making a better quality upload than lame old AVI's. It may even still be AVI, but in an MKV container...It's just that MKV has a few nifty features that come in handy. Google it. That goes for you too, Anon. You can stop rubbing my nipples now. "

,Killher,2012-03-21T20:56Z,Really people bitching about mkv in an avi torrent? That's absolutely retarded. THIS TORRENT IS AVI. It doesn't say anything about mkv ANYWHERE. Get the fuck over it.
