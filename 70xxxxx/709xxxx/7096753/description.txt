Hello every-one.

Few days ago i found out Francesco Lettera (http://www.francescolettera.it/discography/?eos=) and his music left me speechless, searched Internet for a collection, but apart from two albums, I couldn't find anything else.

As I didn't want to stop there, I went to his official page and used a free-ware recording program to record the songs ONE-BY-ONE, so behold...!

Hope you enjoy it.

With respect.

P.S.
Keep in mind that:
- I am NOWHERE near familiar with audio-programming, therefore no matter my best efforts to make the quality flawless, you will still find many "negatives"

- This is NOT a record/rip from the official CDs, I am looking forward for those to leak In Internet aswell.

- This collection took me quite a lot of time to be made, but I still believe It could be better. I will be more than happy if you could leave me some feedback at comments !
