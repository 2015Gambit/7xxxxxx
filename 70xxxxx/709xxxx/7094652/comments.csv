,c3poli,2012-03-12T06:28Z,First to comment jajaja Thanks ETTV you are the shiznet
,Virasto,2012-03-12T06:29Z,you are best ettv :)
,Chased911,2012-03-12T06:38Z,THANK YOU BROTHER. I WASTED MY TIME WITH ANOTHER UPLOADER WHO HAD YOUR NAME AT THE END OF THE FILE. WASTED AN HOUR OF BANDWITH AND IT WAS A FAKE FILE WITH PASSWORD. YOU ROCK!
,Happytime,2012-03-12T06:56Z,Thank you kindly:P  Waiting on an episode of the walking dead is like the only downside of the show at all. 
,ajkenney,2012-03-12T07:39Z,"First I want to thank you for taking the time to upload this.  Some folks are grateful.  As for me and most others, WE DON'T LIKE IT!!"
,ajkenney,2012-03-12T07:41Z,"We don't like it because, it's and .mp4 file.  It should be an .avi file.  These files are much more flexible on the systems they can be played on.  AVI files are better for everyone.  Thanks!"
,Chased911,2012-03-12T07:48Z,RICK KILLS SHANE. DAMNNNN!!!
,PG1874FC,2012-03-12T08:12Z,"Many Thanks For This, shame most of the torrents that are real had sad people posting comments telling us all what happened in it or complaining about the file type...this downloaded in under 6/7 mins,,cheers"
,AlienYouCallGod,2012-03-12T08:27Z,"Mp4 files work on my xbox so I certainly don't mind them. Also people who comment spoilers, true or not, on torrents are just straight up douchebags. Why do people have to be assholes for no reason."
,Rheymisson,2012-03-12T08:30Z,"well, I believe your intention is to upload the best for us. So I suggest you guys from ettv upload .mp4 and .avi files for a while, then you see which one achieve more seeds and stops uploading the other. This way the more accepable extension will be preserved :)

thanks for the upload by the way"
,REDEYESWOLF,2012-03-12T08:45Z,"I'd have to admit those people talking about the file type do have a reason to bitch. I mean come on ettv, get a program called free video soft and convert the file to avi before you post it on the piratebay. Thanks again."
,REDEYESWOLF,2012-03-12T08:49Z,"I'd have to admit those people talking about the file type do have a reason to bitch. I mean come on ettv, get a program called free video soft and convert the file to avi before you post it on the piratebay. But then again to those who are bitching about it, you could convert the file your self to avi. Just thank him and go eat some ice cream or something..Thanks again."
,Happytime,2012-03-12T09:09Z,"OMG the bitches has awaken..why the fuck do you arguing about the format of the file? dont download it then. Fucking cunts...

*SPOILER ALERT*  Ye he dies, and after this episode i was left with one big question, how the fuck are they gonna make this show interesting when the best character has fallen!!?!?!?1"
,Happytime,2012-03-12T09:13Z,amen to that redeyeswolf. People these days are just to damn ungrateful.
,harry_tuttle101,2012-03-12T09:15Z,"A10

,massiveattack786,2012-03-12T09:54Z,"Thnks ettv..for me its no problem mp4 or avi...as a matter of fact, i dnt need to convert to mp4 anymore since i always watch the series on my psp yayyy.;)"
,lobo345,2012-03-12T10:11Z,"Hi ettv, you have included useless txt-file in this torrent. Don't do it again. It's just.. well.. useless."
,naticus,2012-03-12T10:35Z,"stop whining, free is free. you are the child who complained about having food, a roof over their head, and a cell phone and car paid for at the age of 16. i am the child who used to beat you up at school for being pathetic and failed your parents."
,tt_wilk,2012-03-12T10:50Z,thanks bro. Great quality
,JCD3nton,2012-03-12T13:07Z,"PS3 doesn't work this file type, please upload the AVI version! I can't watch it on my LCD TV."
,JCD3nton,2012-03-12T13:16Z,"PS3 doesn't play MP4 file format, I can't watch this on my LCD TV. Please upload the AVI version!"
,0Albert0,2012-03-12T13:19Z,"what happened with this one ettv?

,lightisi,2012-03-12T13:34Z,"thank you ettv.  very nice quality work!

too damn shame for shane.  well i'm happy his dead."
,fsmmikey,2012-03-12T13:55Z,"@tetiwhitton This download is real, I think you may have been mislead by another uploader with a torrent pretending to be from ETTV.

@JCD3nton I use a PS3 to watch all the videos I download, you can still view this file on your ps3. I used TVersity to stream the
file my my laptop to PS3. It's a free program and works very well."
,auronrock,2012-03-12T14:15Z,What a waste of bandwidth! I'll never again download from ettv. Forever block
,john_doe123,2012-03-12T14:15Z,thx for sharing
,74cam,2012-03-12T14:40Z,"First of, thank you ettv. I love this series and I'm glad you're taking the time to upload it

Now for you bitches complaining about the file type...if you don't know how to re-encode videos, why are you even using tpb? Be thankful you got something for free. If it doesn't work for you, too bad. It worked for almost everybody else and you're obviously retarded"
,Bungholio2012,2012-03-12T17:25Z,"Works fine, unless you are retarded.

,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-03-12T19:14Z,"I have never seen such a bunch of fucking whiners. If you don't like the file format, you have two fucking choices: (1) don't download the file, or (2) get yourself a fucking converter and convert it yourself. You are not paying for the file, and you all sound like selfish little children bitching at the uploader.  Now, for those of you posting spoilers--may I suggest that you go locate a spiked pole and then sit on it? ""Selfish asshole"" seems to be the phrase of the day."
,hashuboy,2012-03-12T19:23Z,"Thnx ASAP and ettv,finally some good epsiode was ""better"" than the last few i was really loosing interest in this show but this ep got me again! "
,hashuboy,2012-03-12T19:25Z,yeah its good that Shane died me also happy :) but cant understand where the story is goin seriously
,PG1874FC,2012-03-12T20:31Z,"Ok, there has been a lot of moaners today. Firstly, get VLC player then the file and nearly every fucking other file in the world plays on it so you can watch this no problem on your laptop or pc, get your psp or x box or whatever dosen't play mp4 to fuck or complain to Sony etc you can't watch illegally downloaded files on their overpriced consoles..get a life and thank ETTV"
,cyriuspt,2012-03-12T20:36Z,i can't take this torrent .. why ? :S
,45yu53,2012-03-12T21:14Z,"Password protected, and yet to aquire it one have to complete some lame surveys. All right, done, possword is nowhere to be seen, tried multiple times. What the fuck are you thinking?"
,lumiden,2012-03-12T21:38Z,"@hashuboy Should seriously be ban from commenting for spoiler. Please, there is no way to report."
,jonaslorik,2012-03-12T21:54Z,"why did they kill of shane -.- he was actually one of the better characters, bummer"
,iZanHF,2012-03-12T22:03Z,Downloading now at 4.0mb/s. First time I attempted to download it though it wouldn't move from 1.0kb/s. If it does require a survey download then that is stupid!
,dwight.schrute,2012-03-13T00:48Z,"Chased911 You're a fucking idiot, please, never ever attempt having children. Good job spoiling the episode twist for the others who dont have seen it yet. I first wanted to figure out this password thing but you managed to piss me off even more you goddamn cunt >"
,Chased911,2012-03-13T01:44Z,THERE IS NO PASSWORD FOR THIS TORRENT. IT IS LEGIT.
,rshkhsee,2012-03-13T02:27Z,"knew i shouldntve read this fucking comment section...what the hell is with the spoilers man?! 

Also: Bitches get some VLC and stop complaining!"
,Chased911,2012-03-13T02:27Z,NO PASSWORD BUT RICK KILLS SHANE. DAMNN!!! STILL THINKING ABOUT IT.
,666ASPEN666,2012-03-13T02:38Z,"I never read comments .. but people that do spoil such be Blacklisted/IP banned from being a member here.. and get and option to hide comments, and fix the search function.. its the worst! and an edit button to edit comments .. alot of thing need to be done here,"
,ngodnap,2012-03-13T03:29Z,y i cannot download anything in this site?
,MisterLL,2012-03-13T04:02Z,Looking good! Thanks ettv.
,tmzzl5,2012-03-13T05:37Z,"Dont work for me, the audio and video not syncronized. I try to play on comet player and media player classic. Shit.. shit.. shit..."
,BarraKas,2012-03-13T05:46Z,"you have to be pretty sad and nothing else to do to come here and spoil the episode for everyone, people like you usually die alone i hope thats your case motherfucker i swear i fucking curse you "
,BarraKas,2012-03-13T05:48Z,doesnt piratebay have moderators or adm?if you have you need to ban these people asap i think they lost their right to speak here
,yaoicrazed,2012-03-14T12:27Z,awesome episode...thank you for the upload...
,dvdriprocketmail,2012-03-14T15:37Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I agree with everyone else that likes avi's better than mp4's.  I convert videos with DivX Plus Converter so I can play them back on my DVD Player.  Maybe I'll buy a media player of dealextreme so I don't have to convert the mp4's to watch it on my tv.  To all the people complaining about people giving their opinions about not like mp4 format, you sound just like the people complaining about the mp4 format."
,curbgod666,2012-03-15T01:16Z,I don't mind mp4's just for that fact that I can throw these bad boys on my ipod classic!
,railgun1,2012-03-15T09:46Z,Thanks for the upload!
,PnZombie,2012-03-16T01:25Z,"Okay, I seriously only registered just so I can leave comments.
First off, there's no point in flat out bitching about the format. Speaking up about not liking the format is fine, but down right slamming ettv for not uploading it into the format you HAVE to have is uncalled for. If you have the time to leave nasty and rude comments, then you have the time to download a converter and do it yourself. Don't blame other people for your lazy habits. There's too much hate in the world as it is.
Plus it's freaking free people! Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
As for you rotten spoiler people, SHAME ON YOU! We get that your life is miserable and you have NOTHING better to do than to make others miserable, but don't spoil it for us. Go get a hobby, or go play with yourself or something and let us have our adrenaline rush anticipation time alone.
Last, but certainly not least, just be grateful that there are nice people out there, who are willing to spend their time and energy doing things for others. If you don't like how it's done, then don't download it and keep your nasty ungrateful comments to yourself.
Thanks very much for the upload, ettv!"

,PBR-Streetgang,2012-03-19T01:59Z,"@PnZombie

I love when i see a spoiler as i love it when people hate their lives. Whenever you see a troll or a spoiler you should laugh a little inside as you know that persons life suxs big time and they have no friends, or at least no friends that care about them, lol. they probably have people that they hang around but they just give them shit and steal from them at the least, lol, their lives are shit. they must be shit or they would not get enjoyment from doing the petty little things they do to make themselves feel good.

So go for it Trolls and Spoilers, show us all how bad your life suxs while we download and watch TV for free and feel happy while we do so, and thanks to all the great uploaders out there who make it all posible.

Down with SOPA."

Great Torrent! Thanks!"
,kornbred69,2012-04-08T02:59Z,the only thing better than eztv's awesome uploads would be a description of the episode. it's hard to keep track of what episode on what device.. really wish i had amc here!
,kornbred69,2012-04-08T03:07Z,"oh and to clarify to the idiots, eztv = mkv with avi for the huge dl's mkv is the best format for this quality to be downloaded.

If you have problems playing mkv or any file type, remember, tou can download !!codecs!! and install them. or get a better viewer!"
