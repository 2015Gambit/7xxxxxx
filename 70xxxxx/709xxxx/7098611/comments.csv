,hflawlm,2012-03-16T21:13Z,"Works fine, might need a custom kernel though. WiFi seems to be messy.

To flash with Odin

1. Wipe your device
2. Make sure the device is wiped.
3. Flash as PDA with Odin
4. Wipe the device again
5. Restart the phone.

It may boot as polish but you can change that later."
