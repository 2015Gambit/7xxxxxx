2 LPs on 1 CD: Jimmy Witherspoon at Monterey (1959)/Witherspoon, Mulligan, Webster at the Renaissance (1959).
Previously released on CD as "The 'Spoon Concerts".
Recorded live at the Monterey Jazz Festival, Monterey, California on October 2, 1959 and the Renaissance, Hollywood, California on December 2 & 9, 1959.
Originally released on Hifijazz (J-421) and (J-426)

This single CD (which reissues all of the music from an earlier two-LP set) includes the high point of singer Jimmy Witherspoon's career. On October 2, 1959, he appeared at the Monterey Jazz Festival and created such a sensation that it caused his career to go through a renaissance. Heard at the peak of his powers, Witherspoon holds his own with a mighty group of veterans (trumpeter Roy Eldridge, both Ben Webster and Coleman Hawkins on tenors, clarinetist Woody Herman, pianist Earl Hines, bassist Vernon Alley, and drummer Mel Lewis). Although the five-song set only lasted 25 minutes, Witherspoon's performance was the hit of the festival. The other half of this CD features Witherspoon romping through ten mostly traditional blues songs two months later with Webster, baritonist Gerry Mulligan, pianist Jimmy Rowles, bassist Leroy Vinnegar, and drummer Mel Lewis; the performance is equally exciting. Highly recommended, this CD is the one truly essential Jimmy Witherspoon release.
