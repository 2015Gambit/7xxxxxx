Thanks a thousand times. Hope the quality is okay."
,jrbudda66,2012-03-30T03:59Z,"Scan quality is pretty decent. Thanks to uploader and many many more to the scanner.
Only bad thing is about 10% of pages are upside down. Would recommend viewing with pdf-xchange, u can flip the pages as you go and save the pdf."
,jrbudda66,2012-03-30T23:52Z,"I take it back. Volumes 1, 2, and 5 are good quality.

Volumes 3 and 4 were done with a digital camera, and are nearly unreadable. (no upside-down pages tho)"
,S.C.I.,2012-04-07T21:34Z,"in the future i am going to try to find a exact digital copy,nonetheless this one is enough just to have a watermouthful!!
man,let me tell you,when i will afford 450 bucks i wont hesitate to buy it personally!!!
Salute"
