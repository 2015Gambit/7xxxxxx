,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2012-03-12T06:14Z,"wow, uploaded 11 mins ago...and it already has 1912 seeders. lol "
,Zen_,2012-03-12T06:39Z,Might have something to do with slash being the guest star xD
,UserCC,2012-03-12T07:12Z,Or maybe it is because of silent Kimi R ?
,BlueMeanie1976,2012-03-12T09:47Z,"Thanks for using the .mp4 format! I wish more folks would, instead of that crappy .avi! Thanks for the upload! "
,lobo345,2012-03-12T10:07Z,Or it's uploaded somewhere else before piratebay and they have common swarm.
,Deneb_716,2012-03-12T12:23Z,The video is ridiculously out of sync. Am I the only one? Because I can't find it with normal sync. 
,dmordred,2012-03-12T14:17Z,"hummm divx player can`t play this apparently... and I can`t find the proper codec, could any of you nice souls point me to a decent codec pack? thank a lot"
,DerSpiegel64,2012-03-12T14:22Z,Codec pack?!?!  You still messing around with those things dmordred?  Are you trapped in 2008 or something? Switch to vlc Media Player and you don't need to bother.
,sd404,2012-03-12T14:48Z,Download VLC media player
,noorister,2012-03-12T20:50Z,vlc media player is awesome! I wish I wasnt stingy so I could donate some money to them.
,bholann,2012-03-12T20:57Z,Can anyone upload it in .avi so I can see it on my PS3?
,t00b2012,2012-03-12T21:59Z,Audio was out of sync for me too on WiiMC. In VLC it was fine though. Thanks for the upload!
,srasc,2012-03-12T23:28Z,"The problem for me is that I can't pass it through my metadata adder program iFlicks nor other converter programs like Handbrake. Never had problems like this with an .mp4 before. If I just stick it in iTunes it does work though, no out of sync issues like some others are reporting."
,looserrocks,2012-03-13T07:24Z,"This episode is awesome, it has slash and kimi R as guest stars!!! . There's Ferrari 250 california as well which is an iconic car. But for me its just something else that s featured in this episode, the true great car of our generation The M5, that makes this episode so special!!!"
