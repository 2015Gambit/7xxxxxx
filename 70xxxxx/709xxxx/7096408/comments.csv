,tyl3rdurd3n,2012-03-12T19:02Z,"Hi. Not related to your upload, I know, but you were going to up Malcolm X. It was on the 'upcoming movies' list on your site... what happened?"
,sid4455442,2012-03-13T11:54Z,"thnx yify!!

,Avenger199,2012-03-13T13:19Z,How the hell can i download this man.
,Mrcheeze,2012-03-14T03:31Z,"I watch these movies through my playstation and get that damn cydia audio sh**. Do any of you know a way around this? Thank and love your uploads man, very appreciated."
,yurgn31,2012-03-14T12:56Z,"2 hours at 720p and it's only 700MB?
What's the video bitrate?"
,hadi1989,2012-03-14T21:22Z,"@Mrcheeze I am getting the cinavia audio message for ps3 on a lot of yify's torrents lately as well. Carnage, Tintin and now this. Anyone know how to fix it? I googled it but none of the suggestions work."
,bktheman,2012-03-16T15:35Z,"@yurgn31
have it or hate it son
there are 100ds of people who are simply happy* that yify's rips are so high in quality but always around 700mb...
if you are looking for... a bigger size rip....
THIS might be the wrong place for you.
nobody questions yify's quality

cos it's just awsome.. always"
,chewbacca.star,2012-03-18T05:15Z,"I can´t believe I´ve just bought a rental download of this movie on iTunes store for U$ 3 dollars... 1,81GB taking 3 hours to download... And then I find this amazing thing here, free, 700MB and downloading in 30 MINUTES!! 

LESSON: DO NOT BUY ANYTHING BEFORE CHECKING The Pirate Bay and the Yify collection. Thank you Yify, love you man!!"
,psaraff,2012-03-27T11:10Z,"Dear YIFY

Please upload Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, there are so many torrents on pirate bay but all suck..I have been waiting for you to upload it. 

Many Thanks"
,.Leto.,2012-03-31T07:28Z,"lol, quite funny to see rips made to fit on a 700MB CD. FYI we're in 2012 :)
but I guess it's nice to see that someone cares about those living in some third world country :D"
,terarded,2012-04-01T12:26Z,"@.Leto. your being a massive douche.
people want 700 mb movies because its easier for storage, i personally go for yify torrents because of their great size. if all the movies i have were all in the 1200 mb range, id have to for over an extra 400$ at least for new hardrives to store them on. so quit your hatin coz yify is one of the best torrent uploaders out there.

p.s i created an account ONLY to say this to you."
