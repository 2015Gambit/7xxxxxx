,Mr_Gamer,2012-03-12T20:26Z,Why is this released in a 480p *.MP4 instead of a 720p MKV?
,rlywndr,2012-03-12T20:47Z,"^ because it is.  There is a 720p mkv available, too.  Use the search box at the top of the page."
,rlywndr,2012-03-12T21:08Z,"Okay fine, my bad.  Uncalled-for comment is inaccurate.  the 720 mkv IS over on the eztv website, but hasn't been posted here yet."
,MnrBurger,2012-03-14T06:09Z,"If you are going to upload the same thing twice or even three times, then at least do all of us who watch this on our TV sets via DivX DVD players, a favour and upload it in avi format.  WTF is with the mp4 formats that will only work on my PC?

So now I have to waste time converting this cheesy mp4 to avi, and lose some quality in the process.  That sucks twice!"
[T],scuba-doo,2012-03-15T04:10Z,"@MnrBurger you see to think you are a eztv costomer and they have to serve you. Let me assure you that's not the case...

the format as of ""almost"" recently ( for all scene releases ) is no longer avi."
