Damn you totalbiscuit for making me want to try this out before buying it.. >:"
,cywin,2012-02-07T20:57Z,it has 2 seeders but it fast download my download completes in 7 sec
,Betoriel,2012-02-07T22:04Z,"Now there's plenty more seeders, thank you.

Anyways, the game is pretty fun and the torrent works great..

The difficulty is alright I guess, bit too easy at times.. But I really wish there was some bit more hardcore achievement, something to have good time AND catch all the extra passengers at same time.. Since the game lacks that one..

The only annoying thing about this game is the tutorials, and the moment when you receive achivements.. Those 2 should be skippable, since most of the time, they just end up wasting your time and it gets really annoying really fast..

Other than that, it's great fun little game.. And definitely worth buying."

But that's more or less minor nuisance.."
