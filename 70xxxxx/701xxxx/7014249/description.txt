A producer decides to reopen a theater that had been closed five years earlier when one of the actors was murdered during a performance.  To temp fate further, the theater is to stage the exact same production with the remaining members of the original cast.  This rarely seen classic was to be the great Director Paul Leni's last film, who died later in the year of blood poisoning.

I apologize for the poor quality of this movie, but the DVD isn't any better.  This movie was never officially released to video and has not been restored.  It's a rare find.
