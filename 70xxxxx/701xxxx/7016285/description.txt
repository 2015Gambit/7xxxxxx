                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Model Katie Piper, who was badly disfigured and partially blinded after being 
 attacked with acid in 2008, investigates a new surgical procedure that could  
 potentially restore her sight by transplanting stem cells directly into her   
 left eye. She explores the science behind the operation, and investigates the 
 ethical debate surrounding the use of cells extracted from human embryos - a  
 practice that some people argue is morally unjustifiable, but which others    
 believe could revolutionise the world of medicine. 
                           
                                 Enjoy!
