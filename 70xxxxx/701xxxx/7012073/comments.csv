,agrenas,2012-09-02T15:09Z,could u please upload human anatomy latest?
,freeiz,2012-09-09T18:02Z,"BlueMan_86: you are referring to the downloadable version, which i dont have; i paid for the webapp (online subscription) version, which is what all of you are getting for free here

it appears that visiblebody.com has not updated the online version since 19 apr 2012, and i dont see any major changes between that and the uploaded version (released 23 nov 2011)

whoever get a copy of the executable, please share"
,BlueMan_86,2012-09-15T22:44Z,"Thanks Freeiz for your answer... There is more body parts in human atlas 2...
I just have one more thing to ask...
Is there some way so I can save parts in high resolutions???
I tried to zoom and printscreen and join in photoshop, but because of 3D there is no way...
Any solutions??? THX"
