,dmxkilla,2012-02-08T19:37Z,"does anyone know if playing this game now will get my console banned from xbox live? 
i have been waiting for it forever, but really want to be able to download DLC from here on out as well of course"
,spreadhead,2012-02-08T21:18Z,So I download. Rip to DVD. And it plays on my X360? It can't be that simple.....can it?
,gert1985,2012-02-09T00:19Z,"Works perfect...love all ufc 3 games and this one is realy da best
SPREADHEAD run it with the abgx360 .. and write the iso file on a verbatim DVD + RDL disc with speed 2.4  .. 


how 2 write a downloaded game you can learn from everywhere on the web..try youtube when you havent writed a dick yet


...DMXKILLA Yes you problably get banned when when you play this pirat game with your internet cable connected..."
,dmxkilla,2012-02-09T00:52Z,"right, but if i unplug my internet connection while playing will my console be safe? or will it get flagged for a ban regardless?"
,spreadhead,2012-02-09T01:50Z,"Excellent, I should be able to figure this out. Thank you gbert1985!"
,spreadhead,2012-02-09T16:24Z,Is a modded xbox required?
,gert1985,2012-02-09T18:10Z,sure you need a modded console when you want 2 play those games you download on the web.....when you play a downloaded game and the internet cable is unpluged then it still leaves a mark 2 your console and problably as you connect the cabel your console gets banned...if you want 2 play multiplayer games  and download other DLC then you should not mod your console at all and play just orig. cd-s but when you think about those prices then every new game cost about 50 + $ but when you mod your console then every verbatim DVD+RDL disc cost a little over 2 $ and you get the games as fast at they come 2 the shops

,mrnexus,2012-02-15T12:27Z,"To those who want to play this game or any game early all you have to do is play it offline which means no internet connection to the microsoft servers thats it and when you finish the game uninstall it and clear your cache on ur hardrive just to be on the safe side,then when its released you can connect to xboxlive and play the mulitplayer etc good luck all :)"

,Kabrock,2012-06-02T22:13Z,"Downloaded and burned on Img burner, but the game takes quite a while to begin and during the fight THERE IS NO SOUND! im gonna try to burn again!"
,AXSC,2012-08-28T18:19Z,"@sid4953

First of all, you need a flashed xbox to play these.
Second, you need a dual layer disc to burn it
Third, you need to put it through ABGX360 and burn with imgburn"
