,Browny1309,2012-02-08T06:32Z,"Doesn't work still i replaced the steam_api file with the one you gave, and i have put it into the right directory and everything so i dont no what wrong if its working for anyone else plz comment and explain what you did but im retty sure this doesnt work"
,Jakeler,2012-02-08T07:05Z,Yeah didn't work for me either.
,HeReS,2012-02-08T07:54Z,"This doesn't make any difference, same non-working crap.  Clearly, working is not about this file. 
As uploader, darqsido2, have YOU tested this CK? I bet you haven't.

Well, I guess I better wait if Razor makes their own release of CK, might even work."
,darqsido2,2012-02-08T09:00Z,"Why the fuck do you think I would upload this if it didn't work. it is always the people who don't work that post crap.

This totally works. i guess not for you for whatever reason but this was a great solution for me and others in the original  Skyrim Creation kit torrent.

When Razor does release one, i will get it. for now this is what is available. if it doesn't work for you, then too bad :/"
,ApesGrandson,2012-02-08T09:11Z,"It works.  Extract contents of creation kit archive to Skyrim root.  Then, put this dll in Skyrim root.  Easy peazy."
,Ps3InMe,2012-02-08T09:41Z,"This totaly worked for me.

Dl this steam_api.dll and place it in root skyrim,
my case that is c:\program files\bethesda blabla\skyrim.

Do so and the crashes wont occur at startup.
it does not prevent any other crashes caused by any other reason then startup but it works."
,knnr111,2012-02-08T12:50Z,"If you have problems after downloading and using this, copy and paste your steamclient.dll (if you have steam) to the skyrim main folder."
,dogzbollox,2012-02-08T18:28Z,For those who are having problems with this DLL make sure that steam is not running. It was crashing on startup until i killed steam client and now it's working fine.

,RbtRvltin,2012-02-11T08:57Z,"It works, geniuses. Also, I love you man. No homo."
,killerrj8,2012-02-11T22:00Z,"Guys, if you have problems like me when it says: ""Creation kit doesn't work anymore...""

,jasonm17,2012-02-14T12:55Z,"Hey man! it's asking me to select a file to open with, or search internet for how. Do you know how to get this crack working?"
,linkster10,2012-02-19T14:42Z,"Amazing! Worked Instantly! Thank you very much darq! (haad to make an account just to say thanks, thats how happy i am :D)"
