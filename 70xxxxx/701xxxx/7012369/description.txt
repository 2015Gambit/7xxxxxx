Plot: Two very different cops are pulled into the same spiraling case in the crime action thriller SIU. Directed by Hwang Byung Guk (Wedding Campaign), the gritty police actioner brings together popular actor Uhm Tae Woong (Cyrano Agency) and up-and-coming star Joo Won, from the hit TV dramas Ojakgyo Brothers and Bread, Love and Dreams. The classic veteran-rookie cop pairing, thrilling action scenes, and heady case of crime and corruption add up to an intense and entertaining genre hit. The film also co-stars Jung Jin Young (Battlefield Heroes), Sung Dong Il (Childrenâ€¦), and Kim Jung Tae (Officer of the Year) as detectives.
