Yours Sincerely"

Do you have them or do you have any idea where they may be floating around? Thanks again"

wewuz:I have 100 bullets complete somewhere on cd so when I find it I'll probably upload complete run,but I'm kinda waiting for someone of the scanners to release new scans,same as they did with preacher..."
