,CTR-3000,2012-09-01T17:50Z,"@Stilroc
You dont have to use the loader VLK versions can also activated with a fake KMS server however i included the loader because it's the easiest way to activate for most people.
@D255
I got this copy myself however because it is a unmodified MSDN iso there will probably be a lot of people to upload the exact same file."
