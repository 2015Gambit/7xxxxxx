Book Description
================
Although his father had been reluctant to become a field operative,
Jack Ryan Jr. wants nothing more. Privately training with a seasoned
Special Forces drill instructor, he's honing his skills to transition
his work within The Campus from intelligence analysis to hunting down
and eliminating terrorists wherever he can - even as Jack Ryan Sr. campaigns
for re-election as President of the United States.

But what neither father nor son knows is that the political and the
personal have just become equally dangerous. A devout enemy of Jack
Sr. launches a privately funded vendetta to discredit him by connecting
the presidential candidate to a mysterious killing in the past by John
Clark, his longtime ally.

A shadowy mercenary team is dispatched to capture the former Navy SEAL.
With Clark on the run, it's up to Jack Ryan Jr., along with Ding Chavez,
Dominic Caruso, and the rest of the Campus team, to stop a threat emerging
in the Middle East: A corrupt Pakistani general has entered into a deadly
pact with a fanatical terrorist to procure nuclear warheads, which can
be used to blackmail any world power into submission.

With the breakneck speed and military action scenes that have made him
the premier thriller writer of our time, Tom Clancy delivers a novel
of high-tech warfare in which the enemy within may be even more devastating
than the enemy without.
