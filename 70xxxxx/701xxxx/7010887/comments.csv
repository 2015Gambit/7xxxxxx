,lokolokomo,2012-02-05T17:02Z,"Sunblock my Man,will this work on NTSC/J?,Thanks so much for sharing Fallout Vegas,more power to you and God bless to you."
,SwedishJackass,2012-02-06T09:39Z,I scanned it with abgx and dvd 1 is just regular fallout new vegas. Dvd 2 is an expansion installer and wave 13 so you dont need LT+3.0! it didnt completly verify it however since its such a new release but i'm sure its fine. THANK YOU Sunblock. !!
,lokolokomo,2012-02-07T16:40Z,Not for NTSC/J.wish someone up this for NTSC/J.
,elsita,2012-02-07T22:25Z,is the dlc instalable from the disc? do you need some code to install it as it happened with some other ultimate/gold editions in other games?
,DJ_SEVEN,2012-02-09T03:56Z,"@ Sublock

Is it possible to make a single upload of DLC dvd2
there are alot of people who already have FO3NV and Dln the game (If its the same) is a waste of bandwith!

Thnx for the effort though!

Cheers"

Can you just burn the dlc to disk then run it on the xbox without the need for a flashed console?
Thanks"

,Ashy999au,2012-07-29T06:42Z,"Downloaded this for my Jtag xbox 360
From DVD 1 - Go to play it and it says the disc is dirty, i dont know how that is right when there is no disc in my DVD drive

Go to install from DVD 2 - Comes up with my hard drive to select and just goes back to the xbox dashboard"
