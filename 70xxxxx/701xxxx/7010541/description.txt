Ubuntu Unleashed is filled with unique and advanced information for everyone who wants to make the most of the Ubuntu Linux operating system. This new edition has been thoroughly revised and updated by a long-time Ubuntu community leader to reflect the exciting new Ubuntu 11.10 (â€œOneiric Ocelotâ€) and the forthcoming Ubuntu 12.04.

Former Ubuntu Forum administrator Matthew Helmke covers all you need to know about Ubuntu 11.10/12.04 installation, configuration, productivity, multimedia, development, system administration, server operations, networking, virtualization, security, DevOps, and moreâ€”including intermediate-to-advanced techniques you wonâ€™t find in any other book.

Helmke presents up-to-the-minute introductions to Ubuntuâ€™s key productivity and Web development tools, programming languages, hardware support, and more. Youâ€™ll find brand-new coverage of the new Unity desktop, new NoSQL database support and Android mobile development tools, and many other Ubuntu 11.10/12.04 innovations. Whether youâ€™re new to Ubuntu or already a power user, youâ€™ll turn to this book constantly: for new techniques, new solutions, and new ways to do even more with Ubuntu!

Matthew Helmke served from 2006 to 2011 on the Ubuntu Forum Council, providing leadership and oversight of the Ubuntu Forums, and spent two years on the Ubuntu regional membership approval board for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. He has written about Ubuntu for several magazines and websites, is a lead author of The Official Ubuntu Book.
