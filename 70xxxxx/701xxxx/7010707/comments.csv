I've been downloading your torrents forever and they've always worked great!

At ufc.141 and after, including this torrent your torrents give the wrong length in Windows Media Player Home Cinema.  Always over 200 hrs or something. But if I open the same torrent with Windows Media Player (the one that came with Windows7) it shows the correct time.

I've searched for weeks and can't find a solution. Updated Home Cinema to the latest version.

Please help as I really prefer Home Cinema over the default Windows Media Player.  "
