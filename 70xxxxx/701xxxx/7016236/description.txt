Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Tuesday, February 7 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex announces a key terror alert with specific threats. 

He also talks with retired orthopedic surgeon, author, and radio talk show host Stan Monteith. Alex and Mr. Monteith talk about the impending attack on Iran and the distinct possibility the conflict will turn into World War III. Stan Monteith is the author of several books, including AIDS: the Unnecessary Epidemic, Hidden Agenda: The Fluoride Deception and Iraq: the Untold Story. 

Alex covers the latest breaking news on a Senate bill allowing airports to get rid of the TSA, the latest absurdities by the FBI on who might be a terrorist, and Madonna's Illuminati extravaganza during last weekend's Super Bowl.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
