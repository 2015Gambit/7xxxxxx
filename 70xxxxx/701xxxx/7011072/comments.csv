,pavel_velasof,2012-02-13T09:11Z,"first, copy calculator to your desktop and run it.
then, type ""y"" for yes to generate license file to in command window
if you've already installed ANSYS, then start license manager, specify license server machine and type your computer name as hostname, next,next,next...
when the manager wants you to specify a license file, find it from desktop then type next...
That's all..
If have not installed ANSYS yet, first generate license file, then install ansys and license manager, at the end of the installation license server is asked and type your computer full name and apply same steps."
,LegolasDRoger,2012-02-13T16:16Z,"	Make sure that you are not connected on internet.

1. Copy MAGNITUDE and paste in your desktop;
2. Make sure that there are NOT any other Ansys license in your computer. If there are, open windows on safe mode and delete them;
3. Open the DVD and install the license manager setupLM.exe as administrator. Finish the installation without the license file;
4. Open MAGNITUDE paste in your desktop and run the calculator;
5. Copy the license file to C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\Shared Files\Licensing;
6. Run license manager and choose Run the License Wizard;
7. Choose Run the ANSYS Licensing interconnect with FLEXlm (default);
8. Find the license file on C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\Shared Files\Licensing and click continue;
9. Click Continue over and over and finish the installation and restart your computer;

	Again, make sure that you are not connected on internet.

10. Now mount m-a1464a.iso and run as administrator Setup.exe;
11. Choose with ansys products do you want to, and continue;
12. Skip the following options and click continue;
13. Mount the m-a1464b.iso when the software asks.
14. When the installation is over, restart your computer again. 

	You are probably ready to make fun of Ansys.

,richie_rich1,2012-02-26T20:06Z,"Hi... the ""Access is Denied"" is a Windows7 admin problem. Still working on that. admin in Windows7 is just plain stupid. 
I got the license to work just fine in WindowsXP.
In Windows7 I get up an admin account, but it still saids you need admin permission. How stupid is this?? The is too mucn rain in Seattle, moss has grown in the developers brain. (IMHO)"
,richie_rich1,2012-02-26T20:16Z,"the ""License Manager shows Access Denied"" problem is a Windows7 issue.
I got the same message on my windows7 computer. The way MS has the admin accounts set up is F**KED UP. I had no problems installing on my WindowsXP computer. I am working on the admin issue and will post when I find out something."

,ricki1,2012-04-08T19:28Z,"Ok, so I installed by following the instructions (which are terrible, BTW) and Fluent seems to work fine as long as I am not connected to the internet. 

As soon as I dial up to my ISP, I get the error ""Failover feature 'ANSYS ICEM CFD' specified in license preferences is not available. Request name aienv does not exist in the licensing pool."" and Fluent does not work. 

When I disconnect my dial up connection to the internet and restart Workbench and Fluent, everything works again. How do I fix this so that I can use both Ansys and be connected to the internet at the same time?"

,antianto,2012-06-23T16:55Z,"All right people, for those of you having problem with either ""Access denied"" or ""Could no find path specified"" when trying to install the license.txt file, you may have to restart your computer with User Account Control disabled. I did this and the license installed successfully. Don't forget to block Internet access to the Ansys softwares as they start (easily accomplished with Windows Firewall).

Everything works perfectly now. Good torrent. Thanks."
,kapoios2,2012-07-16T19:55Z,"Hello guys,thanks for the torrent.I also have problem with installation.I use windows 7 professional Greek.
1.I pasted the  folder in my dekstop and i created the license.txt file.
2.I installed ansys (user account control disabled) and used default settings.
3.I set as hostname the name of my computer(which contains characters in greek).
4.Trying to install the license manager,when i browse the license.txt file,it says that the hostname value in the license file does not match any valid hostname value for this machine,and the license file was not installed.
5.I installed all the ansys programs in my secondary hard disk,but i can install the license manager only in my primary hard disk(it's the only option ansys gives me).Could this cause some problem?
Thank you "
