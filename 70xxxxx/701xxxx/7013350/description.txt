James Stewart Essential Calculus.. 


I found this on the internet ....  BUT .... the original did not have all of the pages working properly.. 

I decoded and re-encoded it and it now has all pages..

seed and enjoy my friends...

{note}--- this is not the early transcendentals text book.. this is the harder to find red book with the integral sign in the front..
