,aarque,2012-02-06T18:11Z,"Instructions:
This is an ascrypt_pro installer. You have to run the installer to the registration screen, then find the temp folder that contains ascrypt_pro and replace it with the one in this package. When the Aerosoft Launcher pop-up opens, force quit the installer, then add the .bgl files from this package into the appropriately named scenery folder within the Aerosoft directory. You can leave or delete the .blob files, FSX won't recognize them and they are only 5 mb. As an added measure, you can delete the Aerosoft Launcher within the Aerosoft directory, it is useless anyway. "

,namco-nexgen,2012-02-07T02:45Z,129 leechers and 3 seeders... Download-and-jump-out is still fashion i see. Dumbasses.
,aarque,2012-02-07T04:24Z,"masterboy6x, if you contact me in the forums, I can walk you through the enable button. The rest of you guys, thanks for the props, know I will keep working on bringing valuable and original content as long as I am able."
,BigFatAlpha,2012-02-07T04:47Z,"Seeders are gone, stuck at 41.8%.

Stop the hit and running, otherwise the torrent dies"
,aarque,2012-02-07T11:41Z,"Torrent won't die, but my connection is an absolute disaster. They assure me they are ""working on it."" The outside estimate is day after tomorrow."
,BigFatAlpha,2012-02-07T15:02Z,Thk for the 411
,TravisA320,2012-02-07T15:59Z,lol.Stuck at 90% since last night
,Crash2701,2012-02-07T16:46Z,"@ TravisA320:
how can you be stuck @ 90% when nobody got more then 82.1%???"
,aarque,2012-02-07T17:09Z,"Well day-am Travis, considering the file is 2.35 gigabytes and less than 24 hours old, that's not too bad, especially in light of this crappy internet. I do appreciate the update however, helps me keep tabs on this sucky ISP."
,Crash2701,2012-02-07T17:14Z,"@ aarque:
now at 82.2%. (to help your tabs, lol)"
,TravisA320,2012-02-07T17:24Z,"@aarque Well to hlelp out, I am definately gonna be seeding this if it ever gets finished!"
,aarque,2012-02-07T18:11Z,"All good. Every torrent I have ever started has eventually made it to full seed, even if I had to re-up the durn thing."
,yuca,2012-08-12T19:28Z,"I have an aerosoft product that I bought already installed. It did installed the Aero Launcher. If I installed this torrent would it mess up my purchased add-on?
Also, can one get rid of that stupid aero launcher without causing any downside effects?"
,Taco92,2012-08-28T08:45Z,"Thanks for every torrent, aarque!"
