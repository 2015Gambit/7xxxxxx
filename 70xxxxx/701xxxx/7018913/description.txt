Plot

Ronald Miller is tired of being a nerd, and makes a deal with one of the most popular girls in school to help him break into the "cool" clic. He offers her a thousand dollars to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. It succeeds, but he soon learns that the price of popularity may be higher than he expected.To try and get out of his nerdy set, Ronald offers Cindy, cheerleader and school's most popular girl, a deal. She urgently needs $1,000 which he will let her have if she dates him for a month. Being desperate she grudgingly accepts, and soon starts to actually like him. But she finds his plan of becoming number one guy has worked and he has other fish to fry. Ronald Miller has had a crush on the beautiful Cindy Mancini for years - who doesn't even know his name. Cindy's idea of a Saturday night includes parties while Ronald's is poker games. In addition, Cindy is dating the former football star turned college pro - who has been giving her the cold shoulder. Cindy finds herself in a desperate situation when she borrows her mother's $1000 suede dress, without permission, and ruins it. The only person who has the money to replace the dress, without her mother finding out, is Ronald. However, Ronald tells her that the only condition for him giving her the money is if she poses as his girlfriend for a month. As the month passes, she begins to show an interest in Ronald. But he is so consumed with popularity, he is blind to her feelings. In addition, he also begins to join in with his new "friends" in taunting his old friends. Can Ronald find his way before he loses Cindy and everyone he cares about?

The method of encoding that i have used is compatible for all android phones as long you have installed Rockplayer,MoboPlayer, MX VideoPlayer or similar application. Movie has been cropped
and resized to achieve maximum full screen Landscape display with overall quality, amazing smooth frame rate with synchronized audio and video 
without any problems. [color=Green]Subtitles[/color] you can download them from here: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-5888 or http://subscene.com/cant-buy-me-love/subtitles-16173.aspx for using them
just create one folder in your SD Card for example "movie" and put the video (*.mkv) and the subtitle (*.srt must be renamed same like the movie) file of your desireble language in the same folder
