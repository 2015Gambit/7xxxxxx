,sonofsam0981,2012-02-23T04:47Z,Thanks for the great collections your posted. Just wondering if you have any olfer (pre 2010) PcGamer mags. Ive found some but the speeds are so slow and lots of them are already dead...Also if you can get your hands on some of those classic PcModder mags from around 2005-2006-ish would make my day!
