,OmniNegro,2012-02-06T01:18Z,Passworded? Why fuck yourself like that? No-one will touch it like that. Observe how the regulars post if you want my advice.
,Hajeil,2012-02-06T03:21Z,@OmniNegro That's the way it came in the original download direct from skidrow-scene. Either use it or don't. It's legit. No bullshit survey crap. Just put the password in and it starts unzipping. Her is a direct link to where I downloaded these files from if anyone wants to check for themselves. http://www.skidrow-scene.net/?p=1643
,Aredyn,2012-02-06T03:56Z,"Already in game, crack works, but a huge issue, the game apparently doesnâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t detect my keyboard, only mouse. Canâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t change controls nor anything.
 Anyone else experimenting this ? plz help, thx!"
,Hajeil,2012-02-06T05:01Z,@Aredyn Make sure that you don't have a controller plugged in and don't realize it. It works fine both ways for me.
,Aredyn,2012-02-06T08:22Z,"@Hajeil yea that's what I thought what's the problem, but no, and it won't even recognize any controller for that matter as well.
Preloaded version with THETA cracked btw."
,Hajeil,2012-02-06T08:43Z,@Aredyn Hmmm...yeah that's what this is is the preload with THETA crack. It works fine for me. Double check all of your connections and then launch the game and try it. I just booted it up myself and with a controller plugged in I can go back and forth from keyboard/mouse combo to controller seamlessly just by pushing a button on either. If all else fails you can always try a reinstall. 
,Aredyn,2012-02-06T17:44Z,"@Hajeil Already done 2 reinstalls. Everything checked, AV off, firewall blocking exe, also firewall not blocking.
Never had this problem before with any game.
It is so weird T__T"
