With a large amount of features - diverse small aircraft, impressive night texturing, AI traffic, frequency-controlled approach- and taxiway lighting - and a well equipped military airfield earn the highest marks for Sion. VFR-pilots will find all distinctive visual references such as petrol stations, the hospital in Sion and the castles of ValÃ¨re und Tourbillon. The printable A4 approach charts will help you on the steep IGS and subsequent VFR approach to runway 25. The nicely lit-up castles are a particular eye catcher but to top it all there's a fantastic firework display in Tourbillon which takes place on the Swiss national holiday and New Year's Eve!

    Highly detailed airfield scenery of SION optimized for FSX

I am in favor of learning new stuff."
