NME Review:

Django Django are four men who, among many other things, play guitars, drums, bass, and sing. This is pretty much the only thing theyâ€™ve got in common with any other emerging British band right now. We say â€˜emergingâ€™, but the Edinburgh art-pop foursome first started garnering new band fizz in 2009. A three-year gestation of hype to album delivery would normally be as fatal to a band as their singer being run over by an articulated truck, but Django Django have emerged from their pupal stage showing off a blinding array of colours, and their debut album takes flight bound for somewhere new. 

Itâ€™s not, though, somewhere entirely without precedent. The major inspiration on â€˜Django Djangoâ€™ would appear to be the works of The Beta Band. Yup, for some bands The Libertines are Day One. For others itâ€™s the Stones. For Django Django, itâ€™s the now-defunct Scottish indie semi-legends who were as much characterised by their muddy, spliff-friendly tones as their intrepid, far-sighted eclecticism.

Funnily enough, there is a family connection â€“ Django bandleader David Maclean is the younger brother of Betas keyboardist John Maclean. Even so, theyâ€™ve moved on from their predecessorsâ€™ sofa-bound outlook on life. The rootsy acoustic scrapes, sneaker-shuffling rhythms, echo-slung vocals â€“ all Beta trademarks. But Django make an itchy, Vitamin D-saturated music that grabs hold of their inner stoner, hauls him off the settee and catapults him out into the blazing sunshine.

We begin with â€˜Hail Bopâ€™, a baffling mix of tribal drums, electro-whooshes and cowboy whistles and cricket chirrups. This gives way to the kind of irresistible chant-chorus that peppers the entire album, and ensures that, as far as envelopes are being pushed stylistically, the finished product always hits your lap sounding dead-on immediate. There are echoes of Hot Chip in â€˜Hand Of Manâ€™, while â€˜Loveâ€™s Dartâ€™ is drum machine-bedded acoustic fingerpicking sliced from the most tender parts of Gruff Rhysâ€™ brain. Out in front, though, is the Tarantino-theme-via-Calexico bounce of â€˜Lifeâ€™s A Beachâ€™ â€“ as immediate an anthem as youâ€™re going to get from a band who clearly have the attention span of month-old puppies. Itâ€™s an album characterised by its sharp stylistic swerves, but never feels jumbled or incoherent. 

Itâ€™s a dream of the psychedelic tropics, a heady explosion of colours, an album that takes what it means to be â€˜in an indie bandâ€™ and gives it a good shake. Time to pay a visit.
