but i assume this is compressed from a dvd9? if so, would be great to upload the movie(s) untouched, allowing for individual customization after download. 
bitrate would be great to know!

thanx!"

I am ripping these from my collection of DVDs that I have made from rented movies over the last seven years or so.

Nearly all of them have been put onto a single layer disk, so unfortunately I donĂ˘â&#x201A;Źâ&#x201E;˘t have an uncompressed source handy.  That said I can assure you that these look GREAT on larger screens.

I chose to make them this size for economy as double layer discs were $3 each when I started this and single layer discs were .25 cents each . . . I have 2700 discs now.

Now I am working on putting some of the best ones on a hard drive to be played with my HD TV media player and am still thinking economy is the best rule as these are half the size of ripping a duel layer.

This is the best quality for the value.

I will try to add some more technical information in the future. "

in anycase, keep up the good work!
thanx again!"
