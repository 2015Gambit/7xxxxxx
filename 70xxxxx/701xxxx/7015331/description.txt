Clear explanations of theory and design, broad coverage of models and real systems, and an up-to-date introduction to modern database technologies result in a leading introduction to database systems. Intended for computer science majors, Fundamentals of Database Systems, 6/e emphasizes math models, design issues, relational algebra, and relational calculus.

A lab manual and problems give students opportunities to practice the fundamentals of design and implementation. Real-world examples serve as engaging, practical illustrations of database concepts. The Sixth Edition maintains its coverage of the most popular database topics, including SQL, security, and data mining, and features increased emphasis on XML and semi-structured data.

ï¿½Fundamentals of Database Systems is a leading example of a database text that approaches the subject from the technical, rather than the business perspective. It offers instructors more than enough material to choose from as they seek to balance coverage of theoretical with practical material, design with programming, application concerns with implementation issues, and items of historical interest with a view of cutting edge topics.ï¿½
ï¿½Henry A. Etlinger, Rochester Institute of Technology

ï¿½This is an outstanding, up-to-date database book, appropriate for both undergraduate and graduate courses. It contains good examples, and clearly describes how to design good, operable databases as well as retrieve and manipulate data from an existing database.ï¿½
