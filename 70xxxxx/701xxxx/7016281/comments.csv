,.l.l.l.l.,2012-03-06T15:51Z,hey man cant you upload one piece dubbed instead of subbed???
[T],PirateBoy,2012-03-06T19:52Z,"@ .l.l.l.l.

We generally upload English Subbed animes. From now on, we will upload animes in only HD 1080p or 720p quality. But, not sure about dubbed releases. Because it takes a lot time to encode each episode."
,prentsel_101,2012-03-21T17:27Z,Tank you! it was like there was no file containing one piece that was smaller than 100 GB or something.. been waiting for this a long time  :D
,prentsel_101,2012-03-22T05:35Z,so are you going to do more OP torrents?
[T],PirateBoy,2012-03-24T12:56Z,"Yes. All episodes of One Piece will uploaded in due time. But they will be in 720p HD quality. There is no torrent in the internet which has 720p HD quality of One Piece from Episode 001. So, it will be the first if its kind. Have patience...it will take some time. Meanwhile...enjoy the other HD animes and anime movies. :)"
