so really couldnt the calendar have ended on Dec 2011?

and then thinking about it.. all the Big QUAKES around the ring
of fire starting to happen in Sep 2011 thats pretty close
to Dec 2011.. 

so maybe the Mayans did know something about quake
patterns... despite people saying they got knowledge from Aliens
UFOS etc.
they just might of worked out stuff from observing or had some
past records which have been lost..

just my 2 cents

also perhaps Dec 2012 is correct and its when the big quakes
hit North and middle America on the California side they
know that big fault plate is over due to SLIP

I think I would be very worried of mile high wave and quakes in the part
of world looking at quakes every month from 6s to 7s and higher
to date,,,,"

and have a read of the criticisms.. exposing some of it

[V],psspss,2012-02-09T10:52Z,"this is the only episode I could find of the series
but i suspect the reason is it the best one
and others less interesting.

its also a dvdrip by looks and the ripper didnt know what
he was doing so I had to fix it up properly
for my collection and sharing my work :)

im sure someone has more of the series out there"
[V],psspss,2012-02-10T01:36Z,why didnt the nat geo etc hire a heli and land them on island save all that time climbing up too ??
