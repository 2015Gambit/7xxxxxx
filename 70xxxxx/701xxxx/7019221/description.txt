Apocalypse Island is a two hour television show that was produced in 2009 and first aired on the History Channel on January 3, 2010 as part of the "Armageddon" series.[1] The premise of the show is that an archeologist, Canadian Jim Turner, has discovered a â€˜monumentâ€™ on an undisclosed island off the coast of South America that was potentially linked not only to the Mayan culture, but to the â€œphenomenon of 2012â€. The History Channel is mounting an expedition and needs an anthropologist/adventurer (Jeff Salz, PhD) to join Turner on his return escapade to the site. Narration is done by Robert Davi. The undisclosed "Apocalypse Island" is in reality (Robinson Crusoe Island, Chile).
