,polarbearable,2012-02-07T09:31Z,Please be patient as my upload speed in not great. It will take time to initially seed.
,polarbearable,2012-02-07T11:53Z,"I'm going to Initial (super) seed so you won't actually see me with 100%, but I'm there. This will hopefully speed up the initial upload."
,polarbearable,2012-02-10T23:43Z,"For super seeding to work properly, please;
1. Stay in the swarm (ie. keep downloading) for as long as possible. Leave the computer on.
2. Have your upload speed as high as possible. If you are all only idling along with a restricted upload speed it slows the whole process for everybody, the uploader included.
3. Read up on super seeding and you'll gain an understanding of how it works.

Cheers :)"
,polarbearable,2012-02-13T04:43Z,I gone back to normal seeding for a day or so  as not enough peers are staying with the swarm and I think (could be wrong) this is slowing things down.
