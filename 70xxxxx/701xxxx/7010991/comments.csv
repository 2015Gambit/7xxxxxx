,plasmacan,2012-02-05T17:49Z,How come it's not 8.14 or something gig ? it's a new game ... you didn't say does it goes only with lt 2 or 3 ...I'm still downloading hoping it works tho 
,fallengun04,2012-02-05T18:00Z,"This is an XGD2 game not XGD3 so just like the old games, use 1913760 as your layerbreak and your good to go."

,thegreatjames,2012-02-06T04:49Z,"nope does not work, unreadable disc. ruined 2 cd's, thanks."
,Elektroskank,2012-02-06T05:59Z,"I can't imagine why it wouldn't work trying to burn them on cd's. What a fucking moron. Do you think that pink skull and crossbones up there is part of the uploaders username? It's not. It's there because he/she consistently uploads quality stuff. If Sunblock. says it works fine, then it works fine. ffs..."
,Elektroskank,2012-02-06T06:05Z,"Speaking of morons, i accidently just hit the negative quality button and can't undo it now heh :/"
,thegreatjames,2012-02-06T13:52Z,"dude try it for yourself, it doesnt work. 
just finished the darkness II and now playing kingdoms of amalur, all working great, my imgburn settings are fine for xgd 2.0 and 3.0, it just does not work.
got a unreadable disc error and the game icon doesnt even show when I press play game, which it normally does when I get the unreadable disc error."
[T],Sunblock.,2012-02-06T14:22Z,"Well i have burned 10+ of this game and my friends have done the samething and none have any problems with it, And it have not bean *NUKED* so..."
,thegreatjames,2012-02-06T14:40Z,"forget everything I said, so I am a moron. 
3rd times a charm, it does WORK."

,guyyoung29,2012-02-06T15:40Z,"thank you, can you get hold off the new ea grand slam 
tennis 2 "
,ElPirataHombre,2012-02-06T20:49Z,This is the promo by the way. Not sure if anything is missing but me personally Im gonna wait on a proper. And by the way guyyoung29 in case your wondering Grand.Slam.Tennis.2.XBOX360-SWAG
,ElPirataHombre,2012-02-06T20:54Z,"And as far as dealing with hit or miss when burning XGD3 titles, just convert your 360 to an RGH. No more disc needed and the system works less due to the fact of not using the DVD drive. Just convert the ISO to a GOD (Game on Demand) put it on an internal or external HD and your good to go. It will eventually get to the point where live will no longer be an option with an xbox360 thats modded."
,kaz182,2012-02-06T22:47Z,Can anyone confirm the proper way to burn? What layer break?
[T],Sunblock.,2012-02-06T23:11Z,"open the UFC Undisputed 3 ~XPG~.dvd in notepad and u will see the layer break.
LayerBreak=1913760

But use imgburn and u dont have to do more then just click on the .dvd and burn it."

,ok124763,2012-02-07T02:34Z,"I've been waiting for this one! unfortunately I guess I have to keep waiting. My Xbox isn't banned from live (yet). 

But if I play this on it's real release date after ABGX can confirm it etc... it will be safe to do so, right?

,AminAveh12345,2012-02-11T22:21Z,@bryanm417 You need to flash your xbox 360 first....if you havent done that then no and you need to burn the games on a verbatig 8.5gb dvd double layer disc...
,AminAveh12345,2012-02-11T22:22Z,Seed the game fucking leachers...
,bryanm417,2012-02-11T22:28Z,I was going to flash my 360 a while back i opened it up and it had the wrong drive thing i think due to the fact i bought the cheap arcade one after my other one broke.. guess ill just have to wait 3 days for it to come out
