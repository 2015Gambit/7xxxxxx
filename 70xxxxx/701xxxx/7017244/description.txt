It's been two years since Jackie Estacado used The Darkness to kill the
men responsible for his girlfriend's murder. He's been unable to shake
the memory of Jenny's death since bottling up his supernatural power
and now The Darkness wants out. A sudden, unprovoked attack on Jackie's
life heralds the start of a full-scale mob war which has clearly been
orchestrated by some outside force. The botched attempt opens the door
for The Darkness to reemerge, and sets Jackie on a journey to hell and
worse as he unravels the mystery behind the attack and the motivations
of The Darkness itself.
