Never seen timeslip, after checking it out, it looks really interesting.

You can tell alot of time has gone by when you can remember the days before internet.  None of my children ever believe there was such a time...

if interested, I can post ""the new tomorrow people""  However I was deeply disappointed with it.  Especially since there was no ""Tim"""
[V],steevo-be-thy-name,2012-02-10T01:19Z,"I never knew there was a new series of it , i cant remember that . I would give it a bash m8.
And yeah , i think everyone went about touching their belt buckle pretending to jaunt .
So i thankyou for the nostalgia , keep up the good work bud . "
