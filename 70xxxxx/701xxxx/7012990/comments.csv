,brianxxx,2012-02-06T15:55Z,"Just remember that most of the time, everyone overuses the defrag tool. Back in the day (Windows 98 and earlier) we had to scream at people to defrag. Now, everyone does it so much that it does little to help and mostly puts unnecessary wear and tear on the HD. If you have an SSD with trim functioning, you should not even need to defrag. 
And yes, I am a fan of the Auslogics products! lol"
,keywest33,2012-02-06T16:02Z,@djjlicious thanks again I am impressed with this works well and I find it better than Diskeeper which is very heavy on resources

Clean and fully functional after using the patch. Works great on Windows 7 x64."
