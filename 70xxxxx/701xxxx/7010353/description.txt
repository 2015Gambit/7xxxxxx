I am providing important films in ISO for the film buff or novice film historian. It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries. 
I would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)

This is a DVD rip to an ISO; you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.

This file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:

Audio Options: English and French

Filmed in BandW; interactive menus; scene access; making-of featurette; audio commentary; photo galleries; location map; original prologue script; production featurettes; trailer.
