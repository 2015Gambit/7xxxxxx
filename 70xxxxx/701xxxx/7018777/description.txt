"Lance!"

Whitney is shocked to discover that 
Roxanne's ex-husband Lance (Hayes 
MacArthur) is back in town. Whitney 
tries to dig up dirt on Lance so that 
she can convince Roxanne that he is 
not a changed man, but instead ends up 
with a surprise of her own. Meanwhile, 
Neal encounters some racism with one 
of his work colleagues, but isn't sure 
how to handle the situation. 
Elsewhere, Lily doesn't want to tell 
Neal that she lost her engagement ring 
and begins frantically searching 
everywhere for it.

Evolve... or die.
