,Malebranche1985112,2012-02-05T05:19Z,Will this crack work with the upload you've done as well? I've seen comments that it works with the 13GB one. Just curious.
[V],OneFourOne,2012-02-05T05:23Z,now i want you guys to seed :)
,toolnumber5,2012-02-05T05:30Z,Just tested and this crack works with the CLONEDVD torrent! Thanks! http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7007389/Kingdoms_of_Amalur__Reckoning_CLONEDVD_-_MULTI5_
,toolnumber5,2012-02-05T05:31Z,"Seed baby, seed!"
,einzelhaft,2012-02-05T05:49Z,Yep - seeding! :)
,Netarangi,2012-02-05T06:00Z,Works with every version.
,colexianx,2012-02-05T08:21Z,"Works nicely up until I fight the first boss, the Rock Troll. I am unable to use a finishing move on it. The game indicates I need to press F, but F doesn't do anything. Both the entrance and exit to the room are barred, so I cannot continue. I have reloaded my games several times. Tried it with an xbox 360 controller. Even tried remapping the interact button (Default ""F"") to ""G"", and then G appeared over the dying Rock Troll's head... but still, cannot kill it.
Is anyone else having a similar issue? Is it this crack?
I used this crack and the ""Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning CLONEDVD - MULTI5"" torrent also from TPB.
Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,colexianx,2012-02-05T08:37Z,Is anyone able to kill the Rock Troll boss?
,Machine4578,2012-02-05T09:47Z,"@colexianx
not sure whats wrong? im usig xbox360 controller and hit the buttons as they appeared and killed the rock troll boss with no problems. i was then able to advance. the only advice i could give is maybe try holding the button longer??? good luck"
,barnabey,2012-02-05T09:50Z,"The crack works to start the game...
Does somebody know how to change langage of the game? Please."
,colexianx,2012-02-05T11:08Z,"@Machine4578
Well, that tells me it isn't this crack or the torrent.
Ill try reinstalling, I probably messed something up.
Thank you."
,wiedzmin332,2012-02-05T14:16Z,EA are shitting their pants right about now.
,LuckyStrike74,2012-02-05T14:46Z,"@colexianx
Works fine for me, with the keyboard and with the default F button.
But I'm using the game from the Skidrow website (8 gb english only), and the crack on this torrent.
Good luck.. "
,Zolraudio,2012-02-05T20:39Z,Works perfectly on the 13gb one. Thank you very much. :D

I don't know if it's the same crack or not, but i downloaded this crack aswell just in case. cheers for the upload."

,kittehkun,2012-02-07T16:53Z,"If I buy the game in store then come home, install this then the game do I need to deal with origin at all?"
