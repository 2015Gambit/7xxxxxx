http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907848/

Plot:
For as long as she could remember, Dakota Skye has been cursed with a super power. She has the ability 

to see the truth in any lie she hears. From small, harmless white lies, to the more devious kind, they 

have come from the people that she should trust the most; her family, friends and teachers. These lies 

have snowballed, leading to her becoming bitter and apathetic towards the world around her. Now 

seventeen, Dakota just watches the world happen around her, unmotivated to join it.
