V/8
A/8

I noticed the tops of the actors heads were missing quite often but this i believe is part of the movie as the full screen is at all times in view i think."

,msweet53,2012-02-06T05:27Z,Really? 500+ seeders and a 20 kb download speed?
,jvanwey,2012-02-06T06:10Z,dark parts unwatchable. light parts very hazy. garbage
,MisticBane,2012-02-06T07:38Z,"Interesting... it's called ""garbage"" by someone without any uploads to his name? hmmm

Personally, it's been a pretty decent upload considering - also, I have yet to DL anything from Hackulus that is ""garbage"". 

Hackulus does his or her best to provide the best they have to offer and I am rarely disappointed. Many thank to Hackulus. (Who might I add is also a VIP in the Pirate community.)

A/8 V/8   M/ worth it"
,Jagga73,2012-02-06T08:11Z,thanks for the up Hack!!!
,tripication,2012-02-06T08:14Z,acceptable download speed if your not in a rush (200-300 kb/s)
,zookafg3,2012-02-06T08:38Z,"Thank you!
Little dark in some areas, but very watchable."
,ShinkuEX,2012-02-06T09:21Z,"V: 7 A: 8

This is definitely the best copy available. The sound is clearer than other torrents, though be careful if you have a high quality headset on. Otherwise, say goodbye to your ear drums.

You can even hear the little... whatever it is, moving around in the crystals!"
,tripication,2012-02-06T10:44Z,"Just finished watching it, v:7(Steady cam, looks a bit cropped in but acceptable.

,Toadem,2012-02-06T15:45Z,Thank you Hackulus :) good or bad the effort is appreciated.
,nightfox87013,2012-02-06T16:03Z,"You could watch this.. Audio is good enough for me, Video could be better, but I guess what you'd expect for a cam.. 
It served its purpose, even though some parts (darkness etc) are a bit hazy..

Good enough, I'd rate it about 6/10.."
,Th3Or4cle,2012-02-06T16:31Z,"People never cease to amaze me with all this ""slow download "" etc. shit. Take the time to research a little about how to properly download torrents. You need to go to your gateway and make sure your ports are forwarded correctly ~~ Google is your friend. I download at 2.5mbs to 3.1 mbs even if there are only 20 seeders  EVERTIME , almost every torrent"

Hackulus is one of the most trusted and respected uploaders on the net and for him to put his time into putting out the best possible quality torrent available says enough bout his character and ur comment says enough bout urs!! Remember what momma used to say, ""if u aint got nothin nice to say, then shut the fuck up u little brat!!"""

,jvanwey,2012-02-07T04:48Z,just giving an honest opinion on quality. fuck your face misticbane. i see your list of ul's is huge. 
,MisticBane,2012-02-07T06:10Z,"@jvanwey - I may not have any uploads... that is because I am not going to even pretend to be good enough to get them out as well as our host on this page, (Hackulus).  However, I am also not complaining like a whining little bitch about getting something for free just because it isn't up to ""my standards"" either. If you don't like it... learn how to do the sshyte yourself and fuck off. If you wanna even try to download something that someone has taken the time to upload, then don't bitch and complain... just be thankful that (UNLIKE YOU) they made the effort to give something the best that they are able and didn't bitch like you did."

,DiscGolfNutt,2012-02-07T23:46Z,"Really good quality for a cam. If you're wanting perfect quality, this isn't for you. It gets a little dark towards the end of the movie but it's very watchable. Thanks for the upload.


A/V: 7/7

,ItsPete,2012-02-09T22:17Z,"VERY good quality for a cam. I have only sampled it so far, but based on the little I have watched I am giving it:

A: 8

V:8

Remember, it's a cam but it looks like a very good cam."
,tx18wheels,2012-02-10T04:33Z,Thanks Hackulus! Downloaded in 12 minutes - thanks seeds! Usual light haze or grainy as in any CAM. Worth downloading!

,ust2,2012-02-11T01:27Z," A:7
 V:7

 Not bad.

 The video seems to have cut the top bit of the screen out or was just not centered very well, and is a little blurry/dark as expected.

 The audio has a fairly consistant hiss/buzz throughout but you can hear talking clearly atleast."
,Guru_Ethereal_Sin,2012-02-11T04:53Z,One word... *Aliens*
,mortuustuna,2012-02-11T14:06Z,"not sure how people can give this a 3 or 4 rating, this is a solid cam, good picture, clear sound. Ok its not screener quality, but thats because as it plainly states it is a CAM.
I would say at least 7/7 audio and sound.

And for all you 
"" this copy is no good but I found it in excellent quality here, junk website.com""
 douche bags, please feck off and die screaming.
thankyou"

what I find amusing is that you claimed your isp was going to sue you over copyright infringement and piracy of material they did not own nor have a legal right to pursue litigation over.  

Next time you want to scare folks, use the company that produced the film at the very least so that we all know you're not a complete n00b, just an asshole."
,spifkitten99,2012-04-18T14:07Z,"Unwatchable!

Even for a cam, the video is absolutely horrible.

- It's cropped to death! Half the picture is cropped away.

- It's blurry as hell!

One of the worst cams I have seen. The people rating the video 5 and up, are idiots."
