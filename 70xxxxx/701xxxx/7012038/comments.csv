And I was amazed, this film could have been made 80-90 years ago. OK, the soundtrack sounds a lot better than old films off course. If you're looking for CRASH, BOOM and BANG you'll probarbly get disapointed. But if you're looking for an amazing experience, this is a film for you. It ought to win OSCAR for best:
Achievement in Art Direction
Achievement in Cinematography
Achievement in Costume Design
Best Achievement in Directing
Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Score
Best Motion Picture of the Year
Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role
Best Writing, Original Screenplay
That's my humble opinion.
And yes, Meryl Streep will at last get her second Oscar. She doesn't play Margaret Thatcher (The Iron Lady) she IS Margaret Thatcher."
