It was really easy to use compared to the 3 or 4 things that I wasted a few hours on beforehand. It'll catch any video on any web page and record it directly to your hard drive. I didn't bother encoding the .flv's or any of the rest into one nice concise continuous codec because VLC plays it all, so why bother anymore?!!"

The electronic music made for SOTD is individual to each episode, never playing the same theme twice, aside from the intro song. The creators of SOTD really did a fantastic job with this. If there was a soundtrack of all the many multilayered sequences of sound made for all these episodes, I'd snatch that in a hot second! Really, this is an awesome show packed full of history from the dawn of time.. and they didn't have a pussy making music for the show either. Give a little appreciation for the goods I gathered up from all over the place.. and by all means, if you have a better resolution, copy of any of these episodes, do share them and leave links for others to follow. I just got in the Japanese SuperSub from somewhere that is much higher quality than the one in this torrent. I suppose I'll upload it for you guys now.. but any time someone wants to chime in and make this a better, more complete collection, I'll thank you kindly for chipping in, and saying something about this.. would be great. 'Cause so far, I'm the only one who's said anything at all about this torrent. ~ Now, as for that SuperSub.. I'll upp it now. You're totally welcome, ye silent posse of leachers."
