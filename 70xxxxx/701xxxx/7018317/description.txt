Notes: the Italian BluRay disc has H.264 MPEG-4 AVC Video at 24.000fps and very low
19Mbps average bitrate, which means it doesn't look good. UK BluRay release offers
27Mbps average bitrate in 23.976fps original format, which means outstanding quality.
The BluRay Italian DTS HD-MA 5.1 16bit has been re-sampled, enhanced, re-synched and re-encoded
at maximum DTS-HD MA quality (and converted to 24bit). The LFE channel was taken directly
from the English DTS-HD MA audio track because it sounds louder and better with less noise. 
The Italian AC3 5.1 was encoded from the same raw audio tracks used for DTS HD-MA 
with no quality loss. 

Regarding the custom menu, due to MultiAVCHD bugs and limitations don't use "setup" on titles
other than the main movie, it would lead to a crash on most players. Otherwise all titles play fine.
And for language audio and subtitles selection just use your player remote controls menu and buttons
to switch, it's easier.
