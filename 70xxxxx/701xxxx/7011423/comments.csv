,legofreak7377,2012-02-06T01:39Z,quality?? A/V?
,xeroxz,2012-02-06T01:53Z,"Thanks a ton. Took a while for this one to be leaked, but nevertheless. Just wish people would seed. I do not have the fastest upload speed in the world, but I am seeding as well as I can while downloading. About 60% done right now, with 9 hours to go :( But I guess this is how it goes with fresh torrents. Thanks again neon."

,AN0N_YM0US,2012-02-06T21:06Z,Thanks for the share. Quality is perfect DVD Screener. Only question is why the Hell would someone have it in rar files. You do know people delete that after unpacking and thus destroying the seeds. Common sense I thought.
