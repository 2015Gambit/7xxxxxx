Book Description
================
Based on 15 years of research, Glock is the riveting story of the weapon 
that has become known as Americaâ€™s gun. Today the Glock pistol has been 
embraced by two-thirds of all U.S. police departments, glamorized in 
countless Hollywood movies, and featured as a ubiquitous presence on 
prime-time TV. It has been rhapsodized by hip-hop artists, and coveted 
by cops and crooks alike.

Created in 1982 by Gaston Glock, an obscure Austrian curtain-rod manufacturer, 
and swiftly adopted by the Austrian army, the Glock pistol, with its 
lightweight plastic frame and large-capacity spring-action magazine, 
arrived in America at a fortuitous time. Law enforcement agencies had 
concluded that their agents and officers, armed with standard six-round 
revolvers, were getting outgunned by drug dealers with semi-automatic 
pistols. They needed a new gun.

When Karl Water, a firearm salesman based in the U.S. first saw a Glock 
in 1984, his reaction was, â€œJeez, thatâ€™s ugly.â€ But the advantages of 
the pistol soon became apparent. The standard semi-automatic Glock could 
fire as many as 17 bullets from its magazine without reloading. (One 
equipped with an extended 33 cartridge magazine was used in Tucson to 
shoot Gabrielle Giffords and 19 others). It was built with only 36 parts 
that were interchangeable with those of other models. You could drop 
it underwater, toss it from a helicopter, or leave it out in the snow, 
and it would still fire. It was reliable, accurate, lightweight, and 
cheaper to produce than Smith and Wessonâ€™s revolver. Made in part of 
hardened plastic, it was even rumored (incorrectly) to be invisible 
to airport security screening.

Filled with corporate intrigue, political maneuvering, Hollywood glitz, 
bloody shoot-outs - and an attempt on Gaston Glockâ€™s life by a former 
lieutenant - Glock is at once the inside account of how Glock the company 
went about marketing its pistol to police agencies and later the public, 
as well as a compelling chronicle of the evolution of gun culture in 
America.
