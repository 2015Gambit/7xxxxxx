In what was billed as one of the most anticipated comedy shows of 2009, award winning comedian Trevor Noah finally performed his long awaited, first ever one man show. Aptly titled "The Daywalker" it was performed at Gold Reef City's Lyric Theatre with all shows sold out! 
The Daywalker sees this prodigious talent at his very best in what can only be described as a masterful performance. Trevor delves into a wide range of topics including the story of his life as a mixed race child growing up in South Africa. It's cutting edge, full of punchlines and twists all delivered in Trevor Noah's clean cut, no cursing style. 

A comedy spectacle and a truly unforgettable experience
