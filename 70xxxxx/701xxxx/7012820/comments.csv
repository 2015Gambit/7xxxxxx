,vanneli,2012-02-06T19:19Z,Does this include commercials?
,extracube,2012-02-06T19:33Z,"Please report!  Is this one also stuck?  I just spent 14 hours trying to download 1.47GB video from TV TEAM, it was stuck at 99% and is unplayable.  

Is this one also not working?"
[V],neon,2012-02-06T20:35Z,this one works just fine...no-one is stuck
,kingsteve2002,2012-02-06T20:47Z,It's been stuck at 99% for a couple of hours for me.  Is anyone seeding? 
,n.audeh,2012-02-06T20:57Z,Thanks a lot for this upload neon. I wasn't able to watch the game and now I can watch it as many times as I please. Great quality too so thanks again!

[V],neon,2012-02-06T21:03Z,"nearly 4000 have finished downloading this file....theres a couple of trackers down...add this one to your client for faster download :)

udp://tracker.istole.it:80"
,tomblie,2012-02-06T21:20Z,Add me to the list of people that had this torrent screech to a stop at 99.99%
,tomblie,2012-02-06T21:39Z,"My comment was deleted so I'll try this again. The torrent stopped at 99% and is downloading at .4kb/s now

And this is even after adding your special tracker, neon"
,tomblie,2012-02-06T21:40Z,NVM about the deleted thing. Guess my browser was acting up. The 99% problem still holds true though
,sibtulhassan,2012-02-06T22:49Z,I am having the exact same 99.9 problem!
,badaudio,2012-02-06T22:58Z,Hopefully this works out. Never did have time to watch it though previews from streaming look great!! On the edge and then I will have to read all the articles too.
,kingsteve2002,2012-02-07T01:47Z,"neon, How do I add the tracker to my program?  I'm using Utorrent."
,wario_kong,2012-02-07T03:09Z,is there Kelly Clarkson sing in this version? 
,angelmartin,2012-02-07T04:35Z,"thanks for the uled. no problems with the dl, and a great game!"
,tomblie,2012-02-07T04:37Z,"kingsteve2002

Copy the tracker
Right click the torrent in utorrent and go to Properties
Paste the tracker into that big Tracker window

But to be honest, it hasn't made a lick of difference"
,kingsteve2002,2012-02-07T05:21Z,"Thanks, tomblie.
Any luck with a different torrent?"
,extracube,2012-02-07T06:45Z,Finished downloading and is working 100%  (btw I'm the guy who asked for report earlier).  Thanks.
,tomblie,2012-02-07T09:58Z,"Quick update. The torrent finally finished after sitting at 99.9% for almost a whole 24 hours.

The quality is good. Of course it's not OMG HD but if you want that, grab the 5+ GiB file. For what this is, it's good.

No commercials and no half-time show. This is for those who want the game and nothing else. If you wanted the whole experience with overrated commercials and a horrible halftime show, you're shit-outta-luck"
,aijaij,2012-02-12T18:07Z,"Disappointing video quality I must say - not exactly HD quality :-(
