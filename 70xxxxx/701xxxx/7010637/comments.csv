[T],PirateBoy,2012-02-06T11:55Z,You are welcome. You can trust our uploads. We try to deliver best possible quality in the least possible size. :)
,Duddy420,2012-02-11T12:33Z,Thank you
,calem1111,2012-02-21T00:56Z,"and you fail to mention that majority of the video's have been split into parts, which is fucking retarded"
[T],PirateBoy,2012-02-21T14:56Z,"@calem1111

Well, it may seem to be ""fucking retarded"" once u see that the files are multiple. But, it isn't a problem when u know how to play them.

Just select all the files and drag them into VLC player. It will automatically start playing the files one after the other and u have don't even have to change the files.

So, stop complaining and enjoy the upload."
,DjSkouishi,2012-02-27T18:03Z,thx man you torrents are awesome! i got all 15 seasons of Bleach from you and i absolutely love them! keep up the good work! :D
,gavinorb,2012-03-17T14:07Z,I'm going to download all of the seasons from you. And future thanks once I DL'd all of it.
,upbeatanime,2012-04-15T04:27Z,"nice upload for people with shit internet, i however prefer non-split episodes and good quality. so its not for me, still good job.

remember people this is lower-quality for size limits and you can't bitch when there are higher quality , but mulity-gigabyte releases"
,Leah006,2012-05-21T17:56Z,this was a good download. there was unnecessary cursing in the subtitles though -_- i hated that because young kids had to watch it.
,SquidOS,2012-08-02T18:45Z,There is a slight error in all of the videos in which the audio and video is out of sync. This can be fixed by going into the audio settings of Media Player Classic and setting the value in Audio Time Shift (ms) to -500. Otherwise a fantastic upload. Keep up the good work. :)
,bocok,2012-08-23T19:51Z,thx pirateboy :D
,lilrico0917,2012-09-19T02:16Z,"Good stuff now, if you can get naruto-naruto shippuden like this oh man that would be great, thx alot for great content."
