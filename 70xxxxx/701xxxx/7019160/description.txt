Abraxas is the second studio album by the Latin influenced rock band Santana. Consolidating their 
highly acclaimed live performance at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, and the interest 
generated by their first album, Santana (released in May 1969), the band took some time to issue 
a follow-up. Released in September, 1970, the album's mix of rock, blues, jazz, salsa and other 
influences made it a classic that defined Santana's early sound, and showed a musical maturation 
from their first album.

The title of the album comes from a line from Herman Hesse's book Demian, which is quoted on the 
album's back cover: "We stood before it and began to freeze inside from the exertion. We questioned 
the painting, berated it, made love to it, prayed to it: We called it mother, called it whore and 
slut, called it our beloved, called it Abraxas..The word "Abraxas" has use within Gnostic cosmology.
