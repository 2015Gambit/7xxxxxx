For everyones info here, this particular version update is an important one, it addresses that damn a/v sync issue when ripping a DVD to .mp4 or mkv formats, this issue has been around for quite a few version updates. I had to go back to 8.1.2.0 for a while because of this.

I tried with this version and it works beautifully to both above formats.

AND as usual, a truly perfect clean upload by CC"
