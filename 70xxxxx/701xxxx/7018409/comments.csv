I m trying to d/l and reseed through here via torrentday.com and would like to support and seed back for the site, but I now see that it is invite only and sady there is a lack of people gifting us the pleasures of uploding series 1. Such a shame. I'm a member of the box so very responsible to be considered for membership if anyone is aware of opening dys when new members an apply plse pm me. Equally any newer sites opening up looking for committed clean users to share and seed safely?"
