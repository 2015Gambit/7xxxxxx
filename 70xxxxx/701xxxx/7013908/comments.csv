,haydn70ac,2012-02-08T09:56Z,"@zakimar, well considering you already call your mother Uncle Bob, I can't see any harm in you calling her Uncle Tom."
,stormium,2012-02-08T15:13Z,"although i generally disregard most of what 'zakimar' says as being really simple or inappropriate, he actually stumped me with this one and i had to google: ""uncle tom."" heh... although still inappropriate, he does gets some points for introducing me to a new slur.

other than that... any comments or opinions on the content?"
