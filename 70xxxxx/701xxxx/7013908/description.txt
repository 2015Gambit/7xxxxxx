In her memoir, NO HIGHER HONOR, Rice looks back, offering unexpected candor about her tenure as national security adviser in Bushs first term and as secretary of stateâ€¦the [books] moments of self-doubt and regrets are a revelationâ€¦Rice offers sharp and penetrating portraits of foreign leadersâ€¦Her memoir is a reminder that foreign-policy choices facing the United States are complex and difficult, with no easy solutionsâ€¦Rice has acquitted herself well in telling her side of the story; now she awaits the judgment of history.â€

I enjoy biographies and memoirs, particularly of women in leadership, and I thought Rice's memoir would help me understand some of the decisions and actions of the Bush administration from the viewpoint of a smart, educated, talented woman. I was disappointed in her performance as Secretary of State, and I was disappointed in this memoir. Really a slog to get through it. There were good moments, when she wrote about relationships and what it was like to do the job - but most of it was exhausting, as if she went through her daily calendar to recall each conversation and meeting minute-by-minute. Her recollections as National Security Advisor were actually far more interesting. And even though the financial collapse and presidential election of 2008 were not her areas of impact or focus, they were pivotal global events, and her ONE PARAGRAPH devoted to each was surprising, given the extraordinary detail she provided on everything else.
