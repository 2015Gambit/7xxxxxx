                          = THIRD REICH THE RISE & FALL =
                          ===============================





For the second half of the twentieth century, the Third Reich has been deliberated and dissected. Now, as the "Greatest Generation" fades into history, the image of 40,000 uniformed Nazis goose-stepping in perfect synchronization represents all most Americans know about history's most dangerously successful totalitarian government. 


Dig deep beneath the surface of our collective understanding of the Third Reich as HISTORY unearths what we don't know about the individuals who comprised one of the most fascinating and complex regimes of recent history. THIRD REICH: THE RISE AND FALL uncovers familiar anecdotes and fascinating details about the people who comprised the Nazi Party, and raids the treasure trove of archives the Nazis left behind, including rarely-seen German newsreel recordings along with other unique footage carried home by Russian troops.


As produced for The History Channel, this courageous documentary takes an unflinching look at the inner schematics of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. As the program reminds viewers, the Reich was not only one of the most reviled governments in history, but one of the most dizzyingly complex, with a diabolical totalitarian structure that did much to account for its temporary success.


The program travels beyond public comprehension of the Reich, to examine the individuals who comprised it and the secrets that belied it. In the process, it draws heavily from the trove of materials left behind by the Nazis, German newsreel footage, and much more.
