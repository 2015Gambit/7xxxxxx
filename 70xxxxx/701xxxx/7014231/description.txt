Nobody likes Joseph, but he didn't really care until
his beloved dog went missing. Now Joseph is pissed.
But the final straw is when his girlfriend leaves him

something - bringing an old fable back to life about
a wolf that was black as coal and feared like death.
The first targets are foster parents Sam and Doris
whose sunny fall morning has turned into an
unspeakable nightmare...
