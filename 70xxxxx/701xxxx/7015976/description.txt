K-Lite Codec Pack (64-bit) 5.8.0 Codec [Monday February 6th, 2012]


Version 5.8.0 ~ 9.4 MB ~ February 6th 2012


K-Lite Codec Pack 64-bit

This is a bundle of 64-bit DirectShow filters that can be used together with 64-bit players, such as Windows Media Center.

This 64-bit pack can co-exist without problems with the regular K-Lite Codec Pack. In fact, it is recommended to install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the codec pack. That way you will get proper playback in both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Many multimedia applications are still 32-bit and will work fine on your 64-bit version of Windows.
