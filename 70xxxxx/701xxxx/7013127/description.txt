    The plot of Be Reham revolves around        
    Sanjeev Kumar, the police commissioner      
    and Shatrughan Sinha, his subordinate       
    inspector who is his devotee and always     
    keep him in high esteem. The dead-          
    honest and dutiful cop Sanjeev opines       
    that policemen are no ordinary civilians    
    and to do their duty perfectly they         
    should be careful with their public         
    image. He gives this lesson to              
    Shatrughan when he finds him enjoying       
    wine, dine and dance with his lady love     
    Reena Roy and others. However Sanjeev       
    himself has to face the dilemma of          
    following the law of the land or            
    maintaining his image (which he feels,      
    represents the image of the whole police
