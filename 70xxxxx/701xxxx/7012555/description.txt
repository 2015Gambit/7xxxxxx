The film starts off with the Mystery Machine driving through a desert town. A sand storm kicks in, and Shaggy makes an accidental turn into government property. The sight of a UFO causes Shaggy to lose control of the vehicle, and find themselves on the outskirts of a small town. While Scooby and Shaggy stay with the van, the rest of the gang walks into a local diner to ask for directions. Shaggy and Scooby then encounter a fictional animal called a jackalope. Shaggy and Scooby run in the diner in panic while the Scooby-Doo, Where are You theme song (sang by Jennifer Love Hewitt) is played, claiming to have seen aliens.
