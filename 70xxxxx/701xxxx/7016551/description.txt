I don't know why I uploaded the other Ginsberg torrent instead of this, but get this one... has more stuff in it. 

Seed and Enjoy. 

Additionally, you can get more FREE poems in ebook format at poemhunter.com ... I highly suggest taking adantage of it before some massive multinational media corporation discovers that people have access to free reading material and makes them take the site down.
