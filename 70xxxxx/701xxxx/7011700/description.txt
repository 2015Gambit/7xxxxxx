    Howard Thorne is a rapist in Los Angeles: he meets women at work and     
    at parties or he sees them walking down the street, and he follows       
    them, terrifies them, and assaults them. He also dreams about these      
    assaults, and he's unclear how much of what he's done is real and how    
    much is fantasy. He ignores his heroin-using wife, Vicki, who tries      
    everything she can think of to get his sexual attention. Howard and      
    Vicki go separately to a costume party where she learns the full         
    truth about his nature and where he is stalked by one of his recent      
    victims. Individualized versions of Hell await Howard and Vicki.
