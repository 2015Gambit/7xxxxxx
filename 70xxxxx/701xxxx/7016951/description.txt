                The family is still estranged after Caroline moves
                back to the Clearwater House with Du Plessis, who
                appears to be showing signs of a major breakdown and
                is convinced that he has seen the ghost of Peeters in
                the town. Meanwhile, Ed and Danny try to rescue some
                animals from a closing zoo but their attempts to cut
                corners may lead to regret. A concerned Caroline
                confronts Du Plessis, who reveals the truth about the
                circumstances of Peeters's death. But later, when she
                digs deeper, her discoveries are a shock to everyone.
