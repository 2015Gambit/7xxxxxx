720 X 480 DivX 1100k video bitrate 16:9 aspect ratio from this old ntsc dvd
we found around (the xvid we found on the net was only 4:3 aspect ratio - with
a square picture instead) 2hrs_2mins 192k audio 29.97 fps


This movie has some rather ravishing sex scenes involving our Dear Ms. Emma Thompson - so its not to be missed on that account alone.

That said, its not a brilliant idea in its concept of equal liberty as it were
to the pleasures of the spirit and flesh.

We have had various examples of going too far in suggesting or proposing or
positing other notions for what are old fashioned values of traditional family
and loyalties thereto related.

In a nutshell, Ms Thompson's character as scripted (as bizarre as this is)
is telling us that its not the handsome young gallant Germanic British soldier
in officers uniform that is her thrill. Instead, its a Rasputin like figure of
an old long-bearded homosexual man with a voice too many octaves too strained
to sound like he would have real integrity in pursuing the affair - given her own 
honest needs that is. This, she says is her thrill - in fact "she doesn't want to
carry a child - unless its his - otherwise she wants it not to be born" - she
loves this Rasputin like man she says - because in her own words - "he is cold
and wise"

Who wants cold?!!!!!!!!!! (weird!) Keep the advice to yourself my dear!
Furthermore Dear Emma, the words "cold" and "wise" are mutually exclusive
as a way of life option I submit in the strongest possible terms of what is
Christianly endeavour - hoping for better choices for all in what spirit we
strive to maintain in our lives for as long as we choose to live on.
