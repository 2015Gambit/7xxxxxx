NOTE: The patch/cracks may show up as a virus in your Antivirus Software, this is known as a false positive. In more description, a false positive, also known as a false detection or false alarm, occurs when an antivirus program detects a known virus string in an uninfected file. The file, while not infected with an actual virus, does contain a string of characters that matches a string from an actual virus.

A false positive can also occur when a program performs an action, which appears to the antivirus program to be a virus-like activity.

-The patch/crack is an obvious false positive. I will bet my life that you do not get problems caused by this.
