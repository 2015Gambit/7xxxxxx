Hmmm, probably the best way to get that sex figure income is to write a book and promise all idiots that think they can get rich doing nothing that it can be sure be done even if you have no education or anything! LOL"
,willis00,2012-02-09T11:40Z,"^
You don't need an education to become rich, you need to make something or sell something that people want. Steve Jobs didn't go to college , although he only had a $1 salary was worth billions

Mark Zuckerburg did not finish college nor did Bill Gates"
,Koenrad,2012-02-16T10:26Z,"^ You're argument is flawed. Just because a you have examples of people that didn't finish college and got rich doesn't mean you don't need an education to succeed. It definitely helps to be intelligent and have a good education.

 Are you saying that Steve Jobbs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerfag are uneducated? No, you are wrong, they are brilliant people. College does not = smart. 

Learn to think critically."
,machspee,2012-02-29T02:11Z,"You know its kind of funny reading your naive arguement. More or less it is like saying "" I too can become Beethoven because iam pretty sure my dick is larger than his""

No matter what these ""self help"" industries say about you, you can't become the next millionaire within a few years. 

It might sound trite but becoming a millionaire takes traits of intelligence, application, knowledge, handwork, and commitment.(in exceptional cases, just dumb luck) 90% of the people who buy these books doesn't have any of this."

I think you're wrong about having to extremely intelligent etc. I mean yes you need to have SOME smarts, but its all about the idea. If you have an innovative original idea, you will go far. If you can find a market that has gone un-catered, you're in to make money."

,Chisha,2012-07-22T12:10Z,Instead of arguing about opinions has any of you read the book? why don't you comment about what you think about the book instead?
