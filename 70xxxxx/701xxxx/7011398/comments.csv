I suppose I COULD open a unix terminal and paste all those .rnn files into one file that may or may not be readable, but I'd really rather not.  "

,Purple_Monster,2012-02-16T00:05Z,"After @semisaname 's encouraging comment I decided to try this torrent again. I downloaded a fresh copy and used VLC to open the directory where all the .rnn files were stored. VLC threw up several errors, which I ignored because it looked as if VLC was reading the rar files (slowly, one-by-one) into the buffer at the same time. After a little over an hour all the files were in the buffer and the video began to play! 

VLC is awesome - what other player could do this? Send 'em a donation!"
,bhyllsman,2012-03-05T17:06Z,I can not for the life of me understand why people take so much trouble to upload files but do so in a form most programs will not subsequently convert---to wach on the pc this is fine but i have yet to find anything that will convert it to dvd!
,freeware17,2012-03-10T18:13Z,If you intend burning to DVD don't bother downloading this torrent until it is fixed because call.the.midwife.s01e04.720p.hdtv.x264-tla.rar archive is corrupt.
,blondie2,2012-03-18T02:20Z,This doesn't work at all.
