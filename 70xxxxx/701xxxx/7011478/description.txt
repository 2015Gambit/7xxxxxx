This is Nancy Elizabeth's first EP, recorded under her full name 'Nancy Elizabeth Cunliffe'.

Now available on cd. Now this is a nice record â€“ six delicious tracks of obtuse English folk, how lovely! Taking influence from eastern European gyspy music, Thai music and classic British folk,  singer songwriter Nancy Elizabeth Cunliffe has managed to drum up an EP of quite unique beauty. I would like to compare her to Vashti Bunyan, Josephine Foster or even Joanna Newsom but that would be sloppy, she only has shards of these artists in her sound, what she conjures up is simply her own. The way she manages to cram in influences into the folk template is divine, and her use of instruments (harp, piano, guitar) is measured and subtle. This is a perfect taster to a very promising new talent in folk music, Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ll be hearing a lot more about Cunliffe in the months to come.
