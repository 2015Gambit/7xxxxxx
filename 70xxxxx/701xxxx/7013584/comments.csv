,toonboon,2012-03-12T16:05Z,Could whoever uploaded this seed this for a while so others can get to 100% and seed afterwards? Everyone seems to be stuck at 70% right now.

,KShel5150,2012-05-31T04:09Z,"you sometimes it has nothing to do with the number of seeders, if you are using an IP Block, Packet Data encryption tool, or forcing encryption through your Torrent client and the seeder is not using any of these (therefore not allowing encrypted data packets) you wont be able to seed from that person. "
,MFKDGAF,2012-06-10T00:32Z,"This is actually the 2nd half of season 2 after they took a break. 

This torrent contains episodes 10-16.

There is only a total of 3 seasons. Please fix title for others.
