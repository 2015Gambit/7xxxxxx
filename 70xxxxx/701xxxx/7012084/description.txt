How to update your ROM collection and start seeding at more than 0%
-------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you already have one or more ROM sets that belong to this collection, it
  is easy to use this torrent to update your collection, only downloading the
  files you need, and sharing your previous files from the start.

  First, you need the datfile used to build this collection. This file is
  included in the "data" folder indexed by this torrent. With a modern
  BitTorrent client, you can adjust the priority to download this file first.

  Once you have the datfile, verify and fix your collection with the ClrMamePro
  tool. On the net, there are many good guides on how to use this tool
  correctly (also see the guide referenced below). For this step, it's better to
  keep your rom sets unmerged and in zip format. Don't forget to make backups of
  your files just in case!

  Once you have fixed your previous files, you just need to torrentzip all of
  them, so they match the files from this torrent. A good general guide about
  clrmamepro and torrentzip can be found at [4].

  Now you're ready to start updating/sharing your collection efficiently. Place
  your torrentzip'ed files where your BitTorrent client expects them, force a
  re-check of the files and your torrent will be joined with all your previous
  files. Have fun, and seed generously :). Thanks.
