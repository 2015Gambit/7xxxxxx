           The gangster Nino has a gang who call themselves Cash Money    
           Brothers. They get into the crack business and not before      
           long they make a million every week. A cop, Scotty, is after   
           them. He tries to get into the gang by letting an ex-drug      
           addict infiltrate them, but the trial fails miserably. The     
           only thing that remains is that Scotty himself becomes a       
           drug pusher.
