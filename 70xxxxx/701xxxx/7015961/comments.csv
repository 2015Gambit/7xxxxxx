,Sogarr,2012-02-08T00:56Z,What exactly is the difference between this and the THETA upload..?
,NanoEntity,2012-02-08T02:04Z,"Theta is Physical copy of the game, as in retail DVD.

SKIDROW is steam copy of the game, as in steam...."
,CommonsCarnival,2012-02-08T02:26Z,"Adding onto NanoEntity's point, as was noted in the description above, the Theta release did not have an English installer and the game itself was only in English. I'd assume with this release, instead of ineligible characters from the Theta release, you'd be able to read it and change the in-game language if needed.  I've played a couple hours of the game so far and enjoy it, although the camera can be a little wacky."
,OmniNegro,2012-02-08T02:57Z,"The biggest difference is the languages. THETA has only English in the game. The installer is another language too. Skidrow has all the languages the game should have.

Historically Skidrow releases have better compatibility with future patches and such. But THETA has reliable releases too. Just different. And they clearly rushed to be first. Nothing wrong with that, but I would stick to Skidrow if I was interested in this one.

I wonder if the two releases have different cracks and if they can be used in either version?"

For the people who are getting the BSOD, if you have Realtek onboard sound this is most likely the cause, however it could be many things.
For the people getting a blank screen check to make sure you are running the game as Administrator, disable UAC (Vista / Win 7), have latest graphics drivers, C++ and directX installed.
Block the game in your firewall, that reduced the load time for me by alot.
If you have Kapersky or Norton on your computer this will also cause problems. (Kapersky and Norton are Cancer! Uninstall now! I recommend !avast ;D)

,Collun,2012-02-15T23:40Z,"@ChainedMemories

The same thing happened to me. I'm not sure exactly what was causing it. All I did was run the Reckoning.exe in compatability mode. Afterward I launched the game and the orc picture hung for about a minute before running the game. The key here is to be patient.

After that it didn't hang and launches normally w/o it running in compatibility mode. Below are the settings I ran it with under Properties > Compatibility in Windows 7, 64 bit. Hope it works for you too, could have been a coincidence though.

[âœ“] Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows 95

However, when I exit the game, I have to wait another 5-10 min staring at a black screen. I updated my vid card drivers and did all that mumbo jumbo with the Nvidia control panel. It didn't stop the stupid black screen.  I also set the .exe to administrator and the other stuff, but to no avail. I then did one last, but extremely simple change and that was the resolution on my computer. After I lowered the res, it fixed the stupid black screen and now I can play in peace!!!!!

,neolectric,2012-03-15T06:46Z,"IGN Review:

http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/121/1218070p1.html

8.5	Presentation
Amalur totes an impressive story penned by one of the great fantasy authors of our time, and it takes place in a fantastic fictional world. It’s complex and hard to follow at times, though.

8.0	Graphics
Beautiful environments and solid animations are marred by fairly shoddy-looking character models. I wish lip-syncing was more on-point during dialogue.

8.0	Sound
Music is sparse, but the voice-acting is well-executed and really adds a great deal to the story. Characters have a lot to say, and that’s a good thing.

9.5	Gameplay
The bread and butter of the game. Reckoning sets the bar very high for other games moving forward, and is an absolute pleasure to play.

9.5	Lasting Appeal
I hope you have a hell of a lot of time on your hands, because Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning will require all of it for the foreseeable future."

,EdyK9,2012-03-28T09:23Z,"More details on how to instal:

2. Mount (DaemonTools or PowerISO...) or burn image(Nero...)

3. Install

4. Copy everything from the SKIDROW folder(from the mounted dvd image) -> go to your Desktop and right click on ""Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning"" shortcut -> select Properties-> Find target. 
->Paste in there the cracks and select ""Yes to all"" to overwrite the original files!

5. Play the game!

I hope it helps.
Have fun!

,g0dzai,2012-09-26T23:39Z,"@360r8d- torrents are never safe if you are an idiot, as you seem to be. To properly use torrents you must first need to understand computers. If you DO know how to work your computer then you can use a combination of Malwarebytes AntiMalware, Sandboxie, and a decent antivirus program (microsoft security essentials is fine). Malwarebytes gets few false positives, and with a sandbox program like sandboxie, you can run any program and watch what it does to see how it behaves and if you can trust it. This is where we get back into knowing how to use a computer though. If you have no idea what is what, no amount of tools will help you. Your best bet is to just buy the game and be safe, or educate yourself and use a sandbox or a virtual machine to run a game. There are MANY people who download a SKIDROW release, then crack his exe or dll file and put their own nasty surprise in. Then you get people who catch the virus and blame skidrow. Skidrow does NOT knowingly virus games. Everytime a virus has been in a game with his label on it, it was tainted AFTER the fact. Always CRC check the game, or get the release directly from the skidrow site. One thing that NEVER helps though, is petulantly yelling about problems repeatedly in a post. It makes you look like an idiot, and most people who know better will point you in the wrong direction BECAUSE you are too annoying, and/or too dumb to do your own research. NOTHING beats educating yourself. Until you do, you are prey for anyone who tells you what you want to hear.
So for you I would say, ""Sure, ALL torrents are safe. And America is the land of freedom."" It's what you want to hear, right?"
,g0dzai,2012-09-26T23:59Z,"@paladin181- Have you ever worked with a skidrow game before? First you have to MOUNT the ISO. Use Daemon Tools Lite(its free). You mount the ISO, then you will have a directory with the install files etc. There will be a folder called SKIDROW as well. After you install the game, but before you launch it, copy the contents of this folder to the INSTALLATION directory. (which is usually c:program fileskindom of amalur (or whatever you selected it to be, etc). Windows will ask you if you want to overwrite, and you agree. This is called ""applying the crack"". When it says copy the contents of the SKIDROW folder, this is what it means, not the main torrent download folder that is called Kindom of Amalur-Skidrow(or whatever). Hope that helps. Consider using google to research these sorts of things. It is basic knowledge and available much quicker than praying that someone on a torrent site takes pity on your ignorance."
,g0dzai,2012-09-27T00:40Z,@taenmoago- The keyboard solution I have found on the net is universal. What is happening is that you are using the DIRECTIONAL buttons to move. THIS game uses the WSAD keys to move. Try that.
,g0dzai,2012-09-27T00:47Z,"@ageesuckup- the reason they went bankrupt is because they moved their entire company to the east coast in anticipation of great success, they paid for all of their employees and their families to move, and bought their old houses for them as well as renting their new ones. When the housing market tanked, they were unable to recoup losses, so they borrowed an additional 60 million dollars. That, grasshopper, is called corporate mismanagement. They needed to sell 3 million to break even, and they were dishonest with investors. It was a big story. And it was long ago proved that people who torrent (to back up purchases, of course), are not the same as people who buy outright. Why, just look at all the n00bs on here that cannot even figure out how to mount a volume and spend their time complaining as if it is the developers fault. These people get viruses or frustrated and end up buying the game anyway. So either you are a SHILL, or then what the hell are you doing all high and mighty(and hypocritical) on a torrent site anyway. "
