Unique and award winning
Melodyne editor, with its Direct Note Access technology, makes possible what had previously been considered impossible: access to individual notes in polyphonic audio material. Correct wrong notes in a piano recording; change the chords in a guitar accompaniment after the recording is over; refashion a sample lick. Only Melodyne editor gives you the freedom to work like this with audio. And allows you to do things you could only dream of doing before.
 
Edit music and not just audio data
With Melodyne editor you can edit your audio material in an intuitive and flexible way. Simply move an audio note to a different pitch or a different position. Make notes longer or shorter, louder or softer. Delete notes from chords or add new ones by copying. Use a multitude of scales, create your own or extract scales from audio recordings. Control the timing in detail and even the time course within notes. These functions for shaping audio will give you an experience you donâ€˜t want to miss.
