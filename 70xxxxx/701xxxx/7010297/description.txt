All Praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the [one Who] sustains the Heavens and Earths, Director of all that is created, who sent the Messengers (may the peace and blessing of Allah be upon all of them) to rational beings, to guide them and explain the religious laws to them with clear proofs and undeniable argumenys. I praise Him for all His bounties. I ask Him to increase His Grace and Generosity. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah alone, who has no partner, the One, Who Subdues, the Generous, the Forgiving. I bear witness that our leader Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, His beloved and dear one, the best of all creation. He was honoured with the Glorious Quran that has been an enduring miracle throughout the years.
He was also sent with his guiding Sunnah that shows the way for those who seek guidence. Our leader Muhammad has been particularized with the characteristic of eloquent and pithy speech, and simplicity and ease in the religion. May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, the other Prophets and Messengers, all if their families and the rest of the righteous.
