Two years after their brilliant popsike debut, 1967's We Are Ever So Clean, Blossom Toes unleashed this extraordinary fusion of acid rock and prog, emphasisng how far they'd come since 'the summer of love'. Characterised by complex song structures and memorable guitar solos, and featuring a guest appearance on sitar from US folkie Shawn Philips, the album has gone on to become a major cult favourite. Heavily bootlegged over the years, this is its first official reissue. Produced with the band's full involvement, it comes with seven bonus tracks, encompassing non LP singles, demos, out takes and live performances, as well as a full colour 12 page booklet incorporating many rare photographs and a comprehensive band history, as well as an introduction from the band's leader, Brian Godding.
