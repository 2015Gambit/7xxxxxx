,imunionjack,2012-02-28T12:33Z,Serials wont work for long will they if you keep posting them in the comments. Just send the paker a message so he can add it to the download maybe. I use the SUMPC daily but Id suggect CCleaner as the tool to use.
,imunionjack,2012-02-28T13:14Z,And its just a typo in the text file. The one posted is the same with the right text lol But as Im the worst in the world for typos and not correcting them on my site forum then Im hardly in the position to moan about it lol Ta for the share.
