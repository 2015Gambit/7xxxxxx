,gipper82,2012-02-05T10:53Z,"Ya, seriously.  Why is no one seeding? 0 seeds."
,gipper82,2012-02-05T14:19Z,aaaah it downloaded so fast and now i'm stuck at 98.5% downloading at 0.3kb/s....what's the deal????so frustrating...upload speed is great however
,neil_diamond ,2012-02-05T14:43Z,What they did here was stop exactly at 99% on purpose! Little bastards want you to come to their site to get that missing 1 percent.
,sonzai,2012-02-05T14:50Z,"Because no one was seeding I downloaded the file on RapidShare and started seeding by myself.
Unfortunately there's just the video file."
