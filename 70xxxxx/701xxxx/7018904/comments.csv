I play the video as I would in youtube, but do not see the file in the IE temp cache like I would in youtube...

I am a subscriber to GBTV also, and if I can get them straight from the site it would be faster for me. 

Also, I would like to have a personal archive stored, as I do for his prior shows on both Fox and CNN.

Thanks for the hosting!

I am using XP not W7 OS to capture. No special settings.  After you start a show, check the VIDEO quality option and download NEXDEF if you do not have it installed."
