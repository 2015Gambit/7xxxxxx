See the sample of Attributes Inspector here. 

Style Inheritance

Our unique function of Style Inheritance makes it possible to apply appearance changes to all items in a DHTML menu by changing a single value of general style attribute. It is still possible to change each menu item separately exactly according to your wishes. Here you will learn more about Style Inheritance. 

Advanced WYSIWYG functions

Advanced editing functions, such as copying parts of menu hierarchy, copying properties of individual menu items, copying the properties of whole submenus, or drag and drop functions for moving entire parts of menu structure, will enable you to compile a final DHTML menu in a fast and effective way and with minimal effort. You will see all the changes on the preview panel immediately. 

Programmable interface and easy implementation into web pages

Agama Web Menus will enable you to generate a single compact JavaScript file or a separate set of files one of which contains the configuration of the entire menu. This configuration file can be generated dynamically on the http server side. A number of user-configured events will then enable perfect interaction with the rest of your web pages. You may attach your own JavaScript code for events such as roll down/roll up a dropdown menu, viewing submenus, or moving the mouse across a menu item. You need add only short HTML code to your web pages with using your favorite site builder like Homesite, Expression Web, Dreamweaver and others. 

A fully commented DHTML menu script source code

is available to the owners of a pro version licence. The JavaScript (DHTML menu script) created by us is an exclusively object oriented code that enables easy programming approach by means of member function and properties. See license compare table. 

Transparent licence policy

Our product, as compared to the products of other producers, generates a JavaScript that does not refer in any way to other domains of the internet; neither does it so to verify the licence authenticity. Menu functionality is therefore fully dependent only on the availability of your web server, not on the availability of the software producer's server. 

Detailed documentation and in-built context help

The program is accompanied with detailed documentation describing the meanings of all configuration attributes, program function, and a number of hints that will enable to compile menus in a fast and effective way. The program itself is delivered with a help panel containing context help. Corresponding help is always offered for an active program element. This context help will enable you to master the program functions fast.
