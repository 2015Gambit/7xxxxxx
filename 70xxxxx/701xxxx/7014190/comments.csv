,rlywndr,2012-02-07T07:33Z,@ above: It works out eventually.  How about not complain about something that is free?
,tyweed,2012-02-07T08:25Z,somthing must of went wrong becasue TvTeam is one of the best. Never had a problem till now
,roberto123456789,2012-02-07T09:19Z,Sorry but complaining about a free service is futile. Seriously these guys are doing everyone a huge favor. Show some respect. Where are the files you upload?
,bedukay,2012-02-07T11:11Z,Anyone complaining about the download speeds on this one you're gonna be even more upset when you finally do complete it and find out the audio is out of sync about 1/2 way through. I'm guessing that's why this one was released later: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7014571/Pawn.Stars.S04E73.Air.Mail.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-FQM
,Lucidfire33,2012-02-07T13:56Z,Audio is out of sync 9mins into this torrent would download the later version
