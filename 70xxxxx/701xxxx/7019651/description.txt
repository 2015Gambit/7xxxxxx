  An investigation into a radical new approach to education focused on  
  teachers. Matthew Carney reports.

  Note: Some confusion with the season labeling of Four Corners, the    
  first episode was broadcast in August 1961, making 2012 the 52nd      
  year of broadcast, however in August last year Four Corners           
  celebrated '50 Years', which would seem to be the completion of 50    
  continuous years since the first broadcast, though it was actually    
  then in its 51st year. Anyway we are going with S52 since seasons     
  are based on calendar year blocks these days.
