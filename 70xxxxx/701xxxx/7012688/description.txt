NOTES:

Thanks to whoever capped this ....nice one :)
Source right video....black borders top and bottom,loads of glares,lacked colour,movement...mainly up and down.
Audio for cam was really nice and heard some worse line audio than this .....just needed alittle more tlc and be great
cam audio.
Workdone ....well cropped the borders but due to the camera movement you still get a black border at the top...so cropped a touch
more at the top but never went to the lowest point otherwise you would have lost too move.From there i resized the video,but 
due to camera movement the AR changes slightly but nothing major at all.
Now we also noticed that on parts you could see alot of pixels also opted to use a HQ smoother and blend them in the best we could to make it
look better and smoother .
Also then needed to balance out the contrast and brightness to remove the glares and whilst keeping decent black levels....also increased the
chroma alot as it needed it badly.
Finally added some sharpness back to the video ....

Audio like we said was good but still wanted to make it better,so dropped it in AA and ran a light hiss removal and then changed all the EQ bands
and resaved,then remuxed.

Overall for a cam ...great audio and video not too bad either i'd say v6.5 a 7.5 ....enjoy folks :)
