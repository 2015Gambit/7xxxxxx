Plot 
===========
The movie opens with a recap of Ichigo Kurosaki's final battle with Ulquiorra in Hueco Mundo, which Ichigo wins after being forced to transform into a incredibly powerful and completely uncontrollable Hollow. Some time later (i.e. after the completion of the Aizen arc), Ichigo is living peacefully in the real world when Rukia Kuchiki and Renji Abarai arrive, but refuse to inform Ichigo of the reason for their visit. Shortly after this, Ichigo's school is attacked by a set of powerful, mask-wearing spirits called the Unforgiven (Togabito). When one of the Unforgiven has his mask broken it is revealed that they have escaped from Hell: breaking the mask triggers the appearance of one of the guardians of Hell, a KushanÄda, who then impales the unmasked Unforgiven and drags him back to Hell.
