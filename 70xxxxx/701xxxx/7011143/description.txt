SYNOPSIS:  Making its long-awaited U.S. home video debut, Luchino Viscontiâ€™s The Leopard (Il Gattopardo) is an epic on the grandest possible scale. The film recreates, with nostalgia, drama, and opulence, the tumultuous years of Italyâ€™s Risorgimentoâ€”when the aristocracy lost its grip and the middle classes rose and formed a unified, democratic Italy. Burt Lancaster stars as the aging prince watching his culture and fortune wane in the face of a new generation, represented by his upstart nephew (Alain Delon) and his beautiful fiancÃ©e (Claudia Cardinale). Awarded the Palme dOr at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival, The Leopard translates Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusaâ€™s novel, and the history it recounts, into a truly cinematic masterpiece.
