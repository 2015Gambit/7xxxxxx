Thanks so much for this!

What was the source?  Tape from FM?

I have seen a reel-to-reel of a KBFH here:

Again, THANKS!!!!!!!!

Winter, Zeppelin and more) in the near future (today) ,so watch for em and tell your friends! Ps. The announcer gives a lot of backround on the Band and Show in the Introduction. -I have no further history to add sorry."
