INSPiRAL READNFO:

Video was pretty nice considering the size,res etc....but the main issue is a faded watermark "shame" on the video itself...
no we never put it there.After a bit you forget about it as its quite faded.
Audio is very nice for cam indeed,some hiss and a couple of coughs but otherwise clean.
Video we tweaked the brightness,contrast,chroma,changed the rgb eq settings .....basically gave it some lov'in.
Audio,now cleaning it was the easy part ....syncing it what bitch 
Was going oos every min or so by a second...so needed to cut and stretch,but the main problem we found when syncing was the video is
missing over 40 secs in 3 places ...a couple of 1 - 2 secs cuts and a big massive one lasting over 37secs.
And abit of work we got it all done so insync and looking and sounding good.
