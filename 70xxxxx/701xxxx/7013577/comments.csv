,velorx95,2012-02-11T22:04Z,how do u install the game i cant get it to work? can someone give me steps please 
,Albie10,2012-02-12T00:40Z,"still downloading, going a bit slow if i have the patience to wait for completing it i will let everyone know if it works"
,lee280269,2012-02-12T12:36Z,"Works 100% many thanks, installer is in strange writing but game itself is English text and audio.
only played for 15mins but seems to be full game with a no dvd crack in the crack folder."
,voz808,2012-02-13T09:42Z,"Game works. Doesn't seem like a demo.
The installer is in a weird language, but the game is in English.
For those of whom are not familiar with these things, the steps are easy.
1. Download the torrent
2. Seed the torrent for other people to use
3. Download a virtual CD emulator, I use daemon tools
4. Daemon tools will run the ISO as a disk, so click on the install.
5. Once installed, (default location is C:\Program Files\Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning) Open the folder from the ISO called crack. Drag that item into the Kingdom of Amalur folder, it will say a name already exists, click 'replace'.
6. You'll double click on that icon to run the game. It will now work.
7. Click the red X in the top right when it asks for your EA account."
,sgtchiefapone,2012-02-18T13:13Z,"This works perfectly although download took a while due lack of seeders. Strange this game hasnt got more as its a great game. Anyway once you have downloaded and go to install don't be scared of the strange text on the install screens, the actual game is in english and if you use in game subs they are english too. Cheers for the upload, thumbs up."
,sgtchiefapone,2012-02-18T13:16Z,"ps: use a virtual drive to install, I use PowerISO as ive had issues with Daemon not picking up in the past."
,dioisgod,2012-02-19T06:24Z,"thanks for this it is 100 percent legit scanned it and it came back fine, easy setup just follow the guys directions above. and for others wondering yes this does include the house of valor content"
,Polkagrisen94,2012-02-21T15:35Z,"I can't get this to work.
When i copied the crack to the folder and start it, it says that im missing xinput1_1.dll.

What to do?"
,Mr.BlizzardBeta,2012-02-23T07:28Z,"@Polkagrisen94 Google search the specific .dll. and you will get in 1 of first search results a website to download (any) .dll for free. There were 2 .dll's I had to get to get it running. Dont remember which ones. but you google search that shit, and will find it. I have faith. Google magic
. Game is legit and working. "

,pyure,2012-02-27T03:26Z,"HELP! 
I followed the instructions and dragged the Crack folder into the Kingdom of amalur folder, when i try to run the .exe i had to download 3 missing .dlls and after the third one i got a weird msg with a bunch of gibberish. "
,kakuzu,2012-03-21T19:08Z,"First off for all those wondering if it works and if its legit yes it does. Be prepared though its a large download and seeders can never be enough. There no glitches although when it starts out there is no sound but as soon as you start to play everything works smooothly. I do have a question though, two if you will and they are really for me. First is there anyway I can make it run faster on my laptop? I know its my laptop making it not run as fast as it can, but its not to bad I've already reached level 15 in about three days. Second can I register and EA account? I don't want to take the chance of them reading it and me caught so I can to ask first. Thanks again, one of the greatest games every hands down."
,IamLetho,2012-04-13T08:38Z,So I cant find the crack file... Any step by step instructions... Yeah.... Sorry
,Grighton,2012-04-21T07:13Z,"This didn't come with a crack, so I'm not sure what to do after it's installed. :/"
,bluesnacks,2012-05-30T22:41Z,"There is a crack.

Right click on the ISO file, open it with a zip manager (winrar, 7zip) and drag the crack folder out of it to your desktop. 

Installation should go like this:
1.Install the game. It's in ascii so don't bother trying to read the instructions.
2. Extract the crack folder ONLY from directions above.
3. Apply crack to game installation folder.
4. Play Game."
,bluesnacks,2012-05-30T22:52Z,I forgot to mention DO NOT go online with it.
