,SerSpec-V,2012-02-12T01:27Z,Installed it in my 255W and will try it out soon. Big thanks to Ipmark.
,pxpierre,2012-02-14T04:11Z,"@ cyribdis - You are a jerk.

I see 2 pages of torrents in Ipmark's profile and NONE in yours.

Thank you to Ipmark & seeders!"
,lamonor,2012-02-18T18:37Z,"Ipmark: Thank you, works great.
cyribdis: Patience is a virtue."
,SerSpec-V,2012-02-27T04:24Z,Updated 4 Garmin's and it's working good.
,burnoutz,2012-03-02T09:27Z,"Hey guys. Just downloaded this and it's much appreciated. I'm having one small (giant actually) problem, how do I install this.

I installed the UPDATE.msi file and selected all of North America. It said that I didn't have anough space so I deleted the ""gmapprom"" so I could fit the new map file created by MapInstall.exe. What then?"
,hub_cappb,2012-03-03T19:39Z,I am getting a CRC error
,hub_cappb,2012-03-03T19:50Z,Stops at 99.8%. What is happening?
,pewee44,2012-03-03T23:45Z,as usual perfect thank you
,Coreman1956,2012-03-11T11:37Z,make sure you back up all original info from your garmin unit.
,jman2529,2012-03-12T21:19Z,"Garmin City Navigator North America NT 2012.40 Unlocked for Mapsource installation steps:

*ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR FILE FROM YOUR DEVICE FIRST BY CONNECTING IT TO YOUR COMPUTER AND COPY THE FILES TO YOUR DESKTOP* 

1. unzip/extract the first zip file and it should recognize the link to rest. ( I useD winrar) 
2. Install the package with the CNNANT2012_40Update.msi file, the setup will install BasaCamp and MapInstall on your computer. 3. replace the original .EXE SILES IN C:Garmin directory with the modified ones in Patch directory folder. 
4. connect your Garnin to your computer and use Mapinstall to update your map for your region (start/program files/ Garmin mapinstall)"
,netsurfery,2012-03-18T02:22Z,Worked Great for me......thanks Ipmark your the best.
,rhamelynck,2012-03-21T03:13Z,Do you have any directions on how to download to an SD Card?  Thx.
,chickins,2012-03-21T05:38Z,dose this work for Kenwood DNX6160??
,madsal,2012-04-10T01:04Z,"I'm using the Garmin Montana 650, will this work on there?"
,Ipmark,2012-04-10T13:07Z,"Yes.
This map works on all Garmin GPS that support NT technology."
,jrfk2,2012-04-17T04:07Z,"I have a nuvi 200 which supports NT and this seems to be the same thing garmin wants to sell to update my 200, but anything I select is too much space. Do I delete anything from the nuvi? it only has 3.82 MB free of 991MB. I guess I expected this to just overlay all the NA maps ..?"
,jrfk2,2012-04-17T04:10Z,I have a nuvi 200 which supports NT and this seems to be the same update via the garmin web site. But I only have 3.8MB of 991MB free. DO I need to delete anything from my Garmin? I guess I expected it to just overlay the existing NA maps .. other than that it works great.
,mazda94,2012-04-21T18:42Z,"what if it says not enough space, do you have to delete anything first.  Thanks"
,TorquedTorrent11,2012-04-21T23:07Z,"I have a newer 2011 garmin 1450 LMT so i get free udates and i updated to the NA.2012.40 maps. On the newer garmin when you power up,  it shows on the screen ( loading maps) 2012 navteq, copyright. which said 2011 before i updated it. I also have a 2008 model nuvi 250, which i used this download to update it. I went through the steps and it said it was successful updating. When i power up the Nuvi 250 it still shows (loading maps) 2008 navteq, copyright. 
I'm wondering if the NA.2012.40 Maps are on it or not. Or because it's a patch update, thats why it still says 2008. Can someone confirm this Thx. "
,Zackeroo,2012-04-25T08:26Z,"Seemed to update successfully, but then when I started to use it on the way to work,  the maps have no detail and the distances are all whacked!....   argh!   I've tried to copy my original gmapsupp file back but I've still lost all detail, etc.   Is there any hope to get this nuvi 255W back to usableness or do I have to toss it?

Thanks in advance"
,Zackeroo,2012-04-25T19:06Z,"Nevermind.... I was able to go to the Garmin site and update missing or damaged files from there after putting my original gmapsupp.img back on....    After backing up, gonna try this again...   Appreciate all the effort Ipmark!"
,bpennsr,2012-04-28T14:01Z,I have a Nuvi1390 and the Mapinstall provided could not retrieve any maps from my unit that would allow updating to progress.  Instead I used the Mapsource provided and it worked.  I clicked on the map tool (the irregular shape icon not the tool menu) and was able to highlight all the component maps and get them listed in a mapset for download.  Because my unit did not have enough memory I had to select and remove some maps I doubted I would use.  I then used the  Mapsource transfer function to download the right-sized mapset and it worked great.  Time to get a microSD! I noticed the the download route calculation checkbox was greyed out but the data must be included since my unit could perform route calculations with the new map files.
,Ipmark,2012-04-30T09:41Z,"On your Nuvi 1390 the preinstalled map is locate on a system (hidden) folder .system.
You have to unhide system folders on the PC (folder options) to see it."
,toyz4roy,2012-05-08T21:26Z,Will this update the POI too?
,tudas_ka,2012-05-17T10:33Z,Wow!  It works like a charm!  I tried install first in my old Nuvi without problem then and to the newer Nuvi with bluetooth.  The prompt to enter ZIP code is very cool!
,cheskim,2012-06-19T21:35Z,"Can somebody please walk me through this installation. I updated my garmin 260w with a 2010 nt before without any problem. I attempted to install this for the last 2 weeks and can't do it right. I thought everything works, till halfway to my destination the map went blank and said "" unable to calculate route"".  Thanks"
,MightAx,2012-07-05T05:24Z,There are 9 files which one do you use??? please help
