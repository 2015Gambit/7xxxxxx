                   Robert De Niro    :   Jack Byrnes
                   Ben Stiller       :   Greg Focker
                   Teri Polo         :   Pam Byrnes
                   Blythe Danner     :   Dina Byrnes

                   Jon Abrahams      :   Denny Byrnes


                                   Plot:

          Male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) is poised to propose to
     his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) during a weekend stay at her parents' home.
     But here's the catch, he needs to ask her father first. Alas, the fur flies
     as Jack Byrnes, Pam's cat-crazy, ex-CIA father, played by Robert De Niro,
     takes an immediate dislike to her less-than-truthful beau. Greg's quest for
     approval gets seriously sidetracked as Murphy's Law takes over and a string
     of mishaps turns him into a master of disaster and total pariah in the eyes
     of the entire family, all except for his shell-shocked girlfriend, who can't
     believe she still loves her one-man wrecking crew.
