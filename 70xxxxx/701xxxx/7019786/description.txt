I'm posting samples from a "siterip" I recently did of the discussion thread at
 
http://vintage-erotica-forum.com/t14150-lingerie-catalog-scans-from-70-80s-amp-90s.html

This thread is unique there -- most of their threads are of vintage porn.  This one, however is of bra and panty ads.  The siterip ended up with just over 20,000 pictures.  These samples were chosen completely at random, so they should be a representative sample of what's in the collection.  As you can see, many (maybe half) of the pics are entire-page scans of 50s-60s era catalogs.  There are plenty of Sears and JCPenney type catalogs, along with magazine ads and print ads from the Sunday newspaper.

I'm posting this here to find out what kind of interest there would be in me posting the whole collection, because it would be a ton of work.  I'd need to eliminate duplicates, and filter through the various "small/medium/large" image sizes of the same picture, and filter out some of the pics that are actually porn.  (There are a quite  a few Samantha Fox photos in the collection.) The end result would probably still have a fair number of duplicates, and they're totally mixed up because the siterip didn't distinguish a photo based on which thread post it came from.

If I post the whole collection, it would be in Porn> Pictures>, since some of the pics really are lingerie catalog scans, but show some nudity.  

I'm only going to do this if I get an overwhelming response here that it's wanted.  So if you want it, speak up.
