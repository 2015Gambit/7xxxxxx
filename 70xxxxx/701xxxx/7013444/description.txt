You can forget snuggling up on the couch this winter as Hed Kandi brings you a tasty collection of frosty Kandi treats. Our latest edition of our world-famous Hed Kandi Winter Sampler is a deliciously stylish selection of goodness sampling a host of Kandiâ€™s latest flavours. Following the lead from our massively popular Summer Sampler, this yearâ€™s winter edition offers a nibble of Hed Kandiâ€™s expanding repertoire and new talent, and will be the first opportunity to hear many new mixes from our A-list producers and artists including; DJ Chus, Tara McDonald, Patrick La Funk, Lauer & Canard, Garrett & Ojelay and Crazibiza to name but a few. This release also features the winning track from Nathan Cozzetto who won our Disco House Producer Competition in October. So whilst the world outside is cold and gloomy get yourself ready to rumble for the upcoming Spring party season with this perfect post-Christmas pick me up. Take off that itchy sweater knitted by Granny and bin those dodgy socks from your stocking as this compilation is all about putting on your most glamorous outfit and finding your closest Hed Kandi party!
