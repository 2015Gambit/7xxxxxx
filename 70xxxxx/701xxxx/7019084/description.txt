RuPaul's Drag Race S04E01 - RuPocalypse Now!


Hello, fellow RuPaul's Drag Race fans! :)

These files are ripped directly from the 720p streams available on LogoTV.com (though sadly for Americans only). Unfortunately, they split each episode into multiple files and I don't know of a nice way to merge them without losing quality.

For that reason, I have added a playlist.m3u file for easier viewing. Most media players should be able to open it, but if yours doesn't, I recommend using the excellent and free VLC ( http://www.videolan.org/ ).

Enjoy! <3
