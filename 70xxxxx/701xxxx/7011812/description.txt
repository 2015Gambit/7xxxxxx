                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Being Human is a British drama series following George (a werewolf), Mitchell (a 
 vampire) and Annie (a ghost) sharing a flat together desperately trying to fit in 
 and lead a normal life "being human".

 The first two series takes place in Bristol whereas in series 3 they relocate to 
 Barry Island in Wales.   
 
 Yet another example demonstrating that x264 provides better compression
 and equivalent or greater quality at smaller filesizes.

 Video Settings: --preset slow --crf 20 --level 3.1
