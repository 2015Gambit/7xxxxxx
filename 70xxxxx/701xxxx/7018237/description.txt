          PLOT           
                                                                      
                                                                           
     In October 1991, a confluence of weather conditions combined to form 
     a killer storm in the North Atlantic. Caught in the storm was the    
     sword-fishing boat Andrea Gail. Magnificent foreshadowing and        
     anticipation fill this true-life drama while minute details of the   
     fishing boats, their gear and the weather are juxtaposed with the    
     sea adventure.
