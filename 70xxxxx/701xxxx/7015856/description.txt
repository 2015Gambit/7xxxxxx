A Swedish documentary about the economic crisis in Greece.

The documentary was made from Alexandra Pascalidou on behalf of SVT Swedish television.

The original video had Swedish subtitles so I was forced to put a black background behind the English ones.

The subtitltes are hardcoded to the video.
