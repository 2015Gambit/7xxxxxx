Island/Mango RRCD 52/524 069-2

This generous collection of classic, rare, and previously unissued tracks is part of an outstanding reissue series from Island Jamaica (Island Records' reggae-specific imprint). The Augustus Pablo album may be the best of the bunch; it opens with the classic Jacob Miller song "Baby I Love You So," which is immediately followed by the dub version of that track ("King Tubby Meets the Rockers Uptown," perhaps the single best dub cut ever recorded). Instrumentals and vocal tracks by Pablo-produced artists follow, including a couple of previously hard to find Delroy Wilson tracks with their dub versions, and two classic performances by Junior Delgado and the late Hugh Mundell. Run, don't walk, to your nearest music store to get this one.
