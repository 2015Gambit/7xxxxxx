,pyramania,2012-02-07T20:43Z,"Download is in .rar files, which have to be extracted before you can view them in avi format or converted to burn on dvd.
you can use a program like Izarac to convert them."
,Beetlejuicexx,2012-02-08T00:14Z,"@pyramania - really? Doesn't look like rar files from the file listing: 
1 of the 7 is:
Extremely.Loud.&.Incredibly.Close.2012.DvDScr.XviD.Ac3.Feel-Free.avi	1.27 GiB"

,xxx71,2012-02-09T21:49Z,if in doubt extremezones copy is good no disrespect to this up-loader   
,themancminsh,2012-02-10T16:52Z,forget the trolls above - A8 v9 good copy plays fine on my pc ... no rar file either - these company hacks trying to save their pathetic jobs will tell you any old crap- download - you won't be upset.
,Dwch,2012-02-15T20:40Z,"The quality is not as good as the original PADDO DVDScr, but the benefit of this one is that the movie is in one piece... the PADDO version is split into two parts. Considering its size (1.27 GB) I'd give this one A:9 V:7.

Thank you PADDO, Feel-Free, and anonymous uploader."
