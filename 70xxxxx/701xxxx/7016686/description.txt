Deep Purple's concert ripped from Blu-Ray. Includes bonus.

Filmed on the closing night of this year's [2011] Montreux Festival on July 16, this concert features Deep Purple playing their classic hits with the accompaniment of a full contemporary orchestra conducted by Stephen BK Bentley-Klein. The orchestrated arrangements give an added depth and range to the familiar songs and the band, who are clearly enjoying the experience, deliver one of their finest performances. With a career stretching back into the late sixties and global album sales in excess of 100 million, Deep Purple need no introduction. They continue to record and perform around the world on an ongoing basis and remain of the finest hard rock bands on the planet as this live Blu-ray clearly shows.
