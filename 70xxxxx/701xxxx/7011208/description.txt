Animated Live 3D Wallpaper showing realistic views of the Sun, planets, asteroids, and moons of our Solar System with a starry background. Watch the Sun evolve towards a Red Giant (dependent on the battery status), use the orientation sensors to look around, enjoy splendid views at Saturnâ€™s rings, or fly through the Solar System.

Due to the realistic graphics, this is a very memory hungry wallpaper. Before buying, please keep in mind that it might not work on weaker devices.
