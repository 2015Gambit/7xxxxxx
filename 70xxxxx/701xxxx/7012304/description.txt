Release Notes....: ORENJI's release is badly deinterlaced.  Obviously a smarter deinterlacer or better
                   settings should be used for sports.  Screenshots are included in Sample dir but it
                   is noticeable in any high-motion segment.
                   DO NOT look at them unless you don't care about spoilers.

                   Additionally, although not reasons for proper, theirs is encoded at CRF23 @ 29.97fps,
                   (and fast deinterlacer used, hence the win) while we encoded at CRF22 and the proper 
                   59.94fps.  Theirs also has a 1.4% AR error which, unfortunately, is acceptable under
                   the current rule set.  Enjoy the higher quality encode.
