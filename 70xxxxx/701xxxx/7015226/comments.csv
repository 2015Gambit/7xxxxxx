have patience, i will seed for long time
it will take bit long for u to get it done
i seed at 20KBPS or so
i will not stop seeding until 4 or 5 downloads done by my seed
and dont think i stopped seeding if u dont get downloads coz some time i need to give my pc rest too
specially around from mid night (IST which is +5:30 GMT)
thats it"
