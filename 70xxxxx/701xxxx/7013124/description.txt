Not my work - credit to slicer for this, the only torrent available version to work fully on my 64 bit Windows 7, including the Boot defrag and filemover.

Full details on the Disktrix site - especially the "Can your computer do this ?" section 2. 

I tried their compression and relocation suggestions and there is a very noticeable improvement in (for example)backup speed. 

For example a 1 Gb HDD backup with Acronis was taking around 5-6 minutes, and is now down to 3.
