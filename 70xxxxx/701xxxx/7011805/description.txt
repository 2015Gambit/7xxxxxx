    Tony Robinson and the Team head to Dunwich, a village      
    that's literally falling off the edge of the UK.          
    Coastal erosion has eaten away most of this              
    once-bustling settlement, and before the whole place is   
    lost to the sea, there's a last chance to find out more    
    about the lost origins of this dramatically situated      
    town.                                                    
                                                              
    Could it even be possible to prove conclusively that it    
    dates from Anglo-Saxon times?                             
                                                             
    But the archaeologists face a huge challenge. Up around   
    the old walls they have to dig one of the deepest          
    trenches they've attempted in recent years. And on a      
    second site by the popular beach cafe, they're           
    searching for an early medieval hospital. But it's not    
    easy to access in the gaps between the fish and chip       
    shop, crowded car park and public toilets.                
                                                             
    Team leader Mick Aston is also desperate to understand    
    the layout of the town's medieval priory, and sets the     
    geophysics experts a Herculean surveying task.            
                                                             
    And the Team don't just concern themselves with dry       
    land, employing ultra-high-tech sonar technology to        
    explore the large portion of the medieval town that       
    already lies beneath the waves.
