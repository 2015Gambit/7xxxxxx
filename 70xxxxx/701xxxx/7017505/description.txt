Subtitles: EN
Date: 2012.02

Director: Nicole van Kilsdonk

Genres: Family

Plot:
Chips with mayonnaise, red onions and hot sat sauce is what you get if you order Patatje Oorlog
or chips war in Holland. Holland has not been troubled by war for a very long time and nowadays
war is something that happens elsewhere. And yet war can also affect peoples lives at home 
so too the life of Kiek. This nine-year-old girl is very worried about her father, a doctor.
Hes urgently needed in a foreign country ravaged by war. Kiek is afraid that even if he doesnt
use a weapon, her father could still be hit by a stray bullet. Although her mother explains that
this is very unlikely, Kiek isnt convinced and feels she needs to do something. Her childish
logic gives rise to strange ideas: she imagines that if her beloved dog were to die, there would
be less likelihood of something happening to her father. Then, when her fathers daily calls
begin to dry up and cracks even start to appear in her mothers carefully preserved faade,
Kiek decides its time to act. Nicole van Kilsdonks non-sensationalist film portrays a problem
which is today almost commonplace, as seen through the eyes of a child. The story also touches
on existential questions, such as whether it is possible to live ones life without taking risks.
