,beano311,2012-04-24T20:51Z,"This is listed under ""Highres - TV shows"", but it's not hires at all. Just an FYI if you're downloading it expecting 720p like I was, don't waste your bandwidth."
,nameless.twisted,2012-05-12T01:26Z,"BAD!
Bad video quality, the audio is late in most of the episodes.
Thanks for the upload, but it's really really bad ._."
