So, now that my spellcheck has determined I am illiterate on almost all accounts, a slight warning:

if you are under 18 and downloading this... while I can't and won't condone any of the subject matter represented in these songs, I am a strong believer in inalienable personal freedoms; as such, if your parents say anything when they find out you are listening to this, just tell them this:

Yo, Bitches! It aint nothing if aint the explicit version! You and the P.M.R.C can suck on this!

Then run, and run fast... run really, really fast because your parents are probably going to start slapping suburbia back into you via your ass in an awfully heinous and sadistic manner.

Another important aspect of personal freedoms is knowing when to keep your inalienable personal freedoms personal in order to avoid beatings. 

Additionally, check out Atmosphere, Sage Francis, Eyedea and Abilities and Brother Ali if you want to hear some awesome music with subject matter that does not constantly revolve around drinking, smoking weed, banging bitches and whatever else popular culture decided you need to focus your attention on.

If you are over 18... well then, by all means, smoke weed, drink lots, bang bitches... and most importantly, shake it like a salt shaker. Just don't hit and run. Thanks.

Seed and Enjoy.
