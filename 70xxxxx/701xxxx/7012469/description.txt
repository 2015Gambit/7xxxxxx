The Dragon Radar leads Goku[citation needed] and Bulma into a remote village. They find that the village is being terrorized by a shape shifter named Oolong. An old woman in this village has the Six-Star Ball (Liu Xing Qui), and she agrees to give it to them if they drive Oolong away from their village. Oolong wants to marry a girl in the village, so Goku dresses up like her to trick Oolong. When Oolong discovers this, he gets very angry. To protect his identity, he reverts back into his original state after he transformed and runs away from the village. Goku follows, and eventually catches and defeats him. With the village saved, the old woman gives them the Six-Star Ball.
