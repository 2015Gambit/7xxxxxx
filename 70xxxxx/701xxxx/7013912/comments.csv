Also, when you have something valid to upload, please provide additional information -- in this case, we would have wanted to know whether it is the current version (10.0.3). But 10.0.3 is already here, so it doesn't matter in this case...it just shouldn't have been uploaded to begin with.

(AND, you're not even seeding it anyway...)"

10.0.3 is NOT a Lion version. Current version of Lion is 10.7.3"
,CA2ONT3,2012-02-09T02:38Z,"what in the hell is 10.0.3 version? You got to be kidding Einsteins. If you don't know how to use it just don't. stop posting nonsense notes.. every release has a secondary number leopard was 10.5, snow leopard, 10.6.., and Lion 10.7.., "
,CA2ONT3,2012-02-09T02:40Z,"this is a Lion 10.7.3 taken from my retail download from apple store, I installed it myself"
,CA2ONT3,2012-02-09T22:01Z,here you have very simply and specified how to make this installESD Mac OS 10.7.3 bootable: http://www.macworld.com/article/161069/2011/07/make_a_bootable_lion_installer.html
,krackhd,2012-02-12T17:22Z,"Actually the Installer version is different to the actual OS build. My MAS download of 10.7.2 is Version 10.0.13 in Finder. Select the Install Mac OS X Lion.app and do a Get Info and you will see the Version number there. It's the installer version, not the OS version.

I'm downloading the 10.7.3 installer from the MAS now and we'll see what version it is listed as.

10.0.3 is a way early version of the Installer program tho. Unless you meant 10.0.13 which is still 10.7.2"
,krackhd,2012-02-13T04:53Z,"Damn...get so used to typing ""10"" when referencing OS X. The 10.7.3 installer is 1.0.16"
