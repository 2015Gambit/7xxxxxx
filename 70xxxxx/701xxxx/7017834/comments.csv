But I ask you to support forward utorrent because Miro can not setup without administrator rights, and BitTorrent is harder to use than utorrent. utorrent can remember my torrents so I only have to start utorrent client and this starts the seeds also. BitTorrent can't remember my torrents to upload? I always have to add again the torrent files when I restart the computer??

utorrent has boss button and I can hide  utorrent but Bittorren can't be disappeared. How can i hide BitTorrent program?"
