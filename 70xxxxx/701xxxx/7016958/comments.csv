,dansmagic,2012-02-10T11:15Z,"Getting sick of these damn MKV files, and even worse when they're archived. Takes 30 minutes to convert a 21 minute show! ffs "
,pdxwill,2012-02-10T20:20Z,"@dansmagic - Why the hell are you converting them, are you some kind of retard? Just download a real media player like VLC or Media Player Classic, download k-lite codec pack so you have codecs for all video types, even if that's overkill, it just makes life easier, being able to play all the formats. It's just stupid to respond to a format by getting pissy and converting it to something else, just get the right player and play the fucking thing, you imbecile!!!"
,9519,2012-02-13T13:06Z,great rip if you extract one of the rar files all the episode is there

Oh boo hoo. 
I don't like pdf
I don't like jpg
I don't like rar
I don't like mkv
I don't like my FREE candy...it's round and I only like square pieces. I don't like eating with a fork I only like spoons. 
Blah Blah Blah
Shut the fuck up you whiney little bitches.
Get with the times...get the appropriate file decompression tools and video players.
Or better yet, just fucking die.

,mrrickyhorror,2012-02-16T06:36Z,"@sceneline- thanks for the upload, man. Always good quality.

@pdxwill and @BoonesFerry - Automatic win. I'll be extracting my file with winrar and watching it on vlc. But I HAAATE .torrent files. Does anyone know where to get torrents that aren't torrents? *derpface*"
,BoonesFerry,2012-02-18T09:48Z,LOL
