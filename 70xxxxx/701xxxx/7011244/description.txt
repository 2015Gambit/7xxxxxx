

Recorded July & August 1993. This release 1993 on 'Milestone'.

Review by Scott Yanow:
Sonny Rollins mostly sticks to standard ballads on this excellent CD which finds him joined by trombonist Clifton Anderson, pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Bob Cranshaw, drummer Jack DeJohnette and, on two selections, a five-piece brass choir arranged by Jimmy Heath. Comfortable and occasionally passionate music by one of the classic tenor-saxophonists.

Personnel as above on tracks 2-6.

Plus on tracks 1 & 7:
Jon Faddis & Byron Stripling - Flugelhorn
Alex Brofsky - French Horn
Bob Stewart - Tuba
