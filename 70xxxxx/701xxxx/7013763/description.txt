Storyline:Would you kill to live? That's what two men, Adam and Gordon, have to ask themselves when they're abducted by a serial killer and paired up in a deadly situation -- holed up in a prison constructed with such ingenuity that escape seems impossible. Attempting to break free might kill them, but their captor could decide at any moment that it's time to dismantle their bodies in his signature way.
