This is a full version of the book, complete with full-res pictures, charts, lists and diagrams.

I took the pain to scan this out of admiration about the book and mister McGee. I already own the printed version of the book and I needed an electronic copy to carry with me anywhere I go. I hope you use it the same way.

The printed book is a must-have bible of food science, easier to read and dirty cheap anyway. Buying it you support mr McGee and his colossal contribution to modern cooking.
