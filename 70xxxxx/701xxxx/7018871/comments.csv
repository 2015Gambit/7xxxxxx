But i'll do it for the dlc's anyway.
Thanks."
,SirReaper,2012-06-18T21:47Z,"Ok so i've downloaded this , but the save file from the other game/version that i had isnt working with this one.

What can i do to keep my save? Or where do i put it so that i can load.
It was in a folder ""out"", and i placed my old save there but i guess this version save stays at other location ?"

Was in my program files or something..

Thanks again for the torrent."
,TaleMunja,2012-07-19T22:56Z,"Hm, i downloaded this but i need only dlc's to play. When i stat the game it make me only game to play-not dlc. They are ""available"" but i cannot start them. 
 Are this dlc's work as some 'levels' in usual game?
 Is this DLC's need to be started as separated games from main one? I mean, logical to me but i cannot start them. Help"
