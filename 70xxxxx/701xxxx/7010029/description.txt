NOTE: This is an Orbx FTX airport, and as such a copy of Orbx FTX Pacific Fjords must be installed prior to use.

Windy Tongass Narrows. 

A challenging landing awaits the adventurous pilot of both commercial airliners and bush planes, with infamous crosswinds up to 90 knots which have been known to
blow approaching planes out across Tongass Narrows in certain conditions. PAKT is another beautifully crafted airport by Russ White, whose reputation for levels of detail never seen before in FSX is growing with each new project he undertakes. This airport is no exception, with a unique multi-level runway and taxiways sloping down to the aprons. The entire airport precinct is built using a single 3DS Max model and of course Russ has included unique tech such as animated ground staff, seaplanes and more. Destined to be a classic!
