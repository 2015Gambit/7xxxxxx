Is there a way where we can vote more than once? "
,aarque,2012-02-05T06:26Z,"One has to be recommended by another trusted member, the pink or green skulls. Reputation points - the little green numbers under the Suprbay avatar and large quantities of quality torrents help to get one noticed. I'm really working on upping the torrents."
,rainvel,2012-02-05T07:33Z,online version or DVD version?

Thanks. "
,SniperBliss,2012-02-05T17:34Z,"Hello guys, please stop being freaking douches and help out Aarque. 
He is working hard to get these to you so the least you can do is help him out on SuprBay, and stop leeching off of everything he does. "
,aarque,2012-02-05T18:42Z,"Thanks for all the props guys, I am sure we will get that Milviz Eagle soon enough. Don't trip too bad about the requests, I have so much junk I seriously forget what I have and I don't promise to fulfill them.
 Only real problem is my ISP. They sent me a new modem and it is even worse than the last one. Half the time I can't even load pages. Makes me think they are choking me off 'till the cops come, but I'm just paranoid that way."
