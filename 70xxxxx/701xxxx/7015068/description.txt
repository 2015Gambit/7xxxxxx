thx

Encode:
Screener was nice, just oversharpened and too low bitrated for that kind of movie,
also had a couple of watermarks at the beginning and inside the movie every 30 mins.

Tried to repair the oversharpening, removed some noise in the video, removed all
kind of watermarks at transition scenes only so that you wont see them anymore.
added slight sharpness again along with brightness, rgb and denoise.
got very nice
enjoy
