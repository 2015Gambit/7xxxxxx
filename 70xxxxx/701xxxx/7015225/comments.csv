,Upgrayedd82,2012-02-16T21:21Z,last time i downloaded a torrent this slow was 15 years ago when i still had dial up
,Upgrayedd82,2012-02-24T15:21Z,i went into the room where the flare was on the roof and it crashed saying it couldn't find the baneSS_b1_fx file. now it crashes soon as i load that save
,george047,2012-02-29T17:39Z,"@Upgrayedd82
Open Binaries/Win32/BmLauncher and then go settings and turn off DirectX 11 features and tessellation and then start the game and delete your old saves and play a new game"
,mntlsylm,2012-03-02T03:03Z,how do I get past the activation?
,george047,2012-03-03T16:01Z,"@mntlsylm
No need of activation. just install and play "
,mntlsylm,2012-03-04T06:23Z,"Won't let me play. Keeps popping up with the activation window with no way to close it except try to activate. Which, naturally I can't do because I ""lost"" the serial number. Help?"
,mntlsylm,2012-03-04T06:33Z,"I already own this on PS3, I just wanted to utilize the PhysX on my PC. When I hit play on the startup screen that comes up after double clicking the BMLauncher shortcut it goes to a ""frameless"" window that says that online authentication is required to play. If I try to authenticate it naturally won't without a valid serial number. If I hit exit on that window it exits out completely. Unless you know a trick there is no way to play this without a valid serial number. As well, I have installed the game and cracks exactly as instructed to do so. But still can't play because of this damn authentication BS. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated."
,george047,2012-03-06T16:39Z,"@mntlsylm
can u give a screenshot of authentication."
,mntlsylm,2012-03-08T04:21Z,"@george047 

Would love to but comments won't let me add it here. Got an email?"
