What this trilogy talks about is the same exact thing as the NWO, ruled by Lucifer. What could be the purpose of this framework? Well, simple enough, to console you all and make it look like some ""bright future of mankind"" so you accept the NWO and give an oath to serve Lucifer and Lucifer only, as all of you will be required to do according to information on record.

Remember this well: without your agreement, the NWO and a rule of Lucifer can not be established as it would be a violation of one of the most fundamental Laws of existence, which is Free Will. If this is done without your explicit agreement, the punishment to those who violated this Law would be more than they bargained for. This is the LAW! Under no conditions whatsoever it can be violated, and they know it really well, no matter what they tell you, deluding and zombifying you all and converting you into biorobots - functional biological machines.

This whole ""paradise on earth without God"" ideology is meant not to free you but to enslave you and in the most drastic and violent ways. If you agree to it, you will sign your own death sentence as it is planned to destroy at least nine tenths of the world population ""to restore the balance with nature"" and create that ""paradise"" for the ""elite"" of parasites to parasite on the fruits of labor of the rest of you - ""slaves"", in a LITERAL sense.

Conceptually, this framework does not make any sense even though some things seem to correspond to reality. Because someone has to rule it and make decision to allocate the resources, to initiate the projects and make all sorts of decisions. It can not just work by itself. Someone has to direct this grand show, and who would that be but not the same biggest and baddest bankers that change their dress to look like some ""elite"" while controlling the world just the same. What do you need money for if you OWN the whole world?

Can you even conceive of an idea of getting rid off the bankers and their deadly grip on the world? HOW? WHO has any power to force them to accept their own bankruptcy unless they are even bigger bankers? You mean the UN? Well, but the UN is their ""back door to enslave the world"", just as Harold Wallace Rosenthal states in his six hour long interview on record. It is them who created the UN in the first place.

If you can understand this and see it, there is no need to even read the rest of this critical review. "

define New world order-
Who is lucifer?

you -- This whole ""paradise on earth without God"" ideology is meant not to free you but to enslave you and in the most drastic and violent ways---

me--
We are already slaves , under  money religion and more.

you-- conceptually, this framework does not make any sense even though some things seem to correspond to reality. Because someone has to rule it and make decision to allocate the resources, to initiate the projects and make all sorts of decisions

me--
no one person controls the resources its strategicly managed by a network of computers fed data from national and international inputs from experienced humans in that field.

this is all about utilizing the most efficient technology science has to offer (at that time) for social concern. basically making every thing essential available to everyone equally  . how is that nwo or slavery , the machine are the fucking slaves not us!!!"
