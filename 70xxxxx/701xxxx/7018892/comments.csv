,Velious,2012-02-09T15:13Z,whats the diffrence between this torrent and the ultimate edition which was released a few days ago?
,AK47Adrian,2012-02-09T16:11Z,ultimate edition it's xbox 360 edition

,Velious,2012-02-09T17:03Z,there is also a pc edition
,rpgman1,2012-02-10T05:07Z,"It's already released on Steam, but people wanted to play the mods with the DLC. Might as well wait for the PC Ultimate version on torrents."
,tankerzpure,2012-02-10T18:53Z,"Guys my estimated dl time is like 2 weeks, which is probs the same for u guys, so ppl please seed, and if a few people could pause their dl for a bit? so a few more ppl can dl it then in return seed it..."
,Mudlar,2012-02-12T13:53Z,I think there is no difference between ultimate edition and this release. On one DVD is game & on another all dlc`s
,5spot,2012-02-14T22:53Z,I used Frostwire as my torrent down loader for this and I don't know how to mount it can anyone help??

,Behemeth,2012-03-22T03:46Z,"Do the two ""DVD"" files mount as one program, need to be burned on a disc, or did I mess something up in seeding?"
,P-roy,2012-03-22T12:31Z,basicly i figured a way around my problem but it involves changing my graphics driver every time i wana play which is  stupid dopes anyone now of a more permanent solution

,firefly-neo,2012-04-01T02:09Z,"hey when i install it, it gets half way and then ask to insert disk 2. i get stuck there. what do i do????"
,Cpt.Obvious,2012-04-01T19:16Z,"@firefly-neo:
How about insert (mount) disc 2?"
,Davenporterk,2012-04-01T23:03Z,"I got all of the way out to where all the ghouls are and it crashed on me and ever since then I can't play at all, I boot up into the top screen (after clicking play) and it freezes have to close with task manager."
,preparationh,2012-04-04T06:56Z,"@firefly-neo
click browse and select the folder where you extracted the dvd2 ""Fallout.New.Vegas.All.DLC.v1.4-SiMON-DVD2"" and it should just continue installing.."
,preparationh,2012-04-04T07:38Z,"thank you .BONE. worked great, and very easy to install. no crack needed, either. i was going to download just the dlc individually since i already have the game but it seemed like such a hassle. with this you just let setup do all the work for you while you sit back on your throne and smoke your cigar!"
,dadstop,2012-04-08T08:26Z,"bullshit fucking release, DON'T FUCKING DOWNLOAD"
,henly1234,2012-04-12T19:36Z,"I bought this from Steam, not realizing as a first time buyer that Steam has to run as well, which I hate, I downloaded this and it works a treat no problems whatsoever, good work, TY."
,Greypoop,2012-04-13T10:42Z,Super easy to install and I haven't found a glitch yet. Just make use you have an up-to-date Direct-X.
,stringtheory,2012-04-16T05:33Z,"for some reason, terminals don't unlock, I crack the password, but then I can't access the info inside for some reason, any help? "
,saddoking,2012-04-18T03:43Z,"fantastic torrent, works like a charm. no problems arisen so far:)"
,aicomb,2012-04-19T02:42Z,"Why are there 2 ISO files? Do i have to install both? Do I install them at the same time or one after the other, if so, which one are you supposed to install first?"
,khmerog,2012-04-21T01:37Z,"aicomb - you install the disc 1 first. it will ask you to insert disc 2 later..before you click OK..mount disc 2 and then click ok. .I use Virtual Clonedrive to associate with any iso files.

Is there a way to turn off the DLC? Because I wanted to finish New Vegas first and then load the DLC in order. or does it matter? The game starts me off with a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun and 4 good armour. In Fallout 3 I started off with no weapons. Is that because of the DLC? I kind of wanted to start off from scratch."
,Kyle2013,2012-04-23T03:25Z,"The game works great and everything, but I can't bring up the command console ???? I press [ ` ] , but it doesn't come up. I've tried all of the buttons on my keyboard. I'm 100% sure the button is working too"
,bayboyjd,2012-05-02T20:30Z,if the game is lagging really what can i do
,Cusconillow,2012-05-03T04:36Z,"Call me dumb, but can someone please explain to me how I am supposed to get this thing working from a .bin file? It won't mount with DT."
,skulldragon,2012-05-04T06:44Z,"One question:
THIS torrent or
Fallout New Vegas (Ultimate Edition) (2012) [PCDVD][MULTi5] torrent?"
,thepartysub,2012-05-08T22:45Z,the dlc wont mount  i selected the right folder and it keeps saying it cant find the setup-2a.bin which i know is in that folder
,westpsmity,2012-05-11T16:07Z,"Help please! I've downloaded this twice, and both times while installing it tells me that certain files are corrupted, and thus won't install properly. That's why I downloaded again, thinking it was just a bad DL, but the exact same files were ""corrupt"", making me feel like there's more to it than that... Ideas? Solutions?"
,johnfist,2012-05-15T09:24Z,I' m sorry if this bug people but is this for PC or do you put these files on a CD and play it on xbox? and can someone tell me how to install these games?
,s1raz1,2012-05-18T19:32Z,Too all  who cant make this simple DL work... u  r a waste of life and should give up... also seed for at least 24 hours b4 giving up tho...

,Not_my_real_id,2012-06-01T23:42Z,Anyone got a virus scan on this?
,Not_my_real_id,2012-06-02T03:30Z,"Just ran an avira scan over the iso, looks clean."
,rowboogs1,2012-06-14T21:32Z,ANYONE having problems with the game lagging alot just adjust the graphics to 800x600 or put the detail level on medium or low always worked for me 
,fluxwave,2012-06-15T10:28Z,"I`m going to answer 90% off all the questions asked here:

-Yes installing the DLC`s also includes bugfixes etc
-Ran: Avira-AVG-Norton-NOD32 scans some turn up false positives on the crack folder THIS IS NORMAL.
In order to install you have to mount BOTH .iso files. or mount CD1 install and when it asks for CD2 dismount CD1 and Mount CD2, simple.
-Everything you need to install and play the game is included either in the files or in the description."
,Krzysd,2012-06-15T23:52Z,"Game works, but every time I load into any of the DLC the game crashes."
,snarfies2,2012-06-16T04:52Z,Installation completely seizes up and halts at textures.bsa.
,streetbum149,2012-06-29T20:45Z,"not sure if its just me but after a new install of this and the other top seeded original game (without mods or ANYTHING, completely vanilla and in the correct load-order) it just refuses to work. i get passed the video then it crashes. "
,joural,2012-07-08T04:53Z,"My game stopped working when I entered the bar at the start of the game, which was frustrating, but not impossible to deal with.  I loaded from the save a few times, it would automatically shut down shortly after the load screen or at the end of the load screen.  I rolled my eyes, erased the file and tried a new game.  Same problem in the same place, but when I tried to load the game from before entering the bar it ALSO bugged out, freezing seconds after loading or else closing during loading.  Any solutions?"

,VitorCz,2012-07-17T02:32Z,100% working free virus thank yo .BONE.
,RonBon37,2012-07-17T04:52Z,does this come with the game?? or is it just the DLC
,RonBon37,2012-07-18T01:35Z,it won't let me fast travel and wait

,imad198,2012-08-03T02:59Z,PLEASE ANSWER. Can I play with an xbox controller?
,Mr.BlizzardBeta,2012-08-04T06:16Z,imad198. Yes . you should only have to plug in the 360 controller and it will install updates(if its first time you plugged it in) and it works
,Ravirne1,2012-08-05T12:53Z,"Im am downloading now. I see that there are two .ISO files. is it a 2 disc install? Also, are the DLC already working with the game if i just mount and install are the DLC working? 
I SEED YOU SEED WE ALL SEED."

,stubbieaussi,2012-08-06T01:10Z,"Torrent works great. If it isn't working blame your pc.
The dlc content will automatically start in game even if you untick the dlc in the launcher data menu.
You could try manually removing the dlc files if you really don't want them I suppose."
,lovelydirt,2012-09-09T15:50Z,"Installed on Win7, works fine and no virus alerts. Thanks for a great torrent! ^_^"

,OperationAnchorage,2012-09-22T16:47Z,This torrent works flawlessly. The game runs perfectly on my ASUS G75 with NO lag what-so-ever. I just made sure I got far into the game before I left this comment to be sure it really worked. SEED FOR EVERYONE GUYS! THIS TORRENT IS GREAT!
,yesterdays_pirate,2012-09-30T08:21Z,"This torrent works great. The other torrent call:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7485053/Fallout.New.Vegas.Ultimate.Edition-KaOs

is good to, but the problem with that one, is that it unpacks everything including the game bsa's, which it seems, corrupts the game somewhat, giving some npc's balding spots, head clipping through hair/gear. 

I heard that if you unpack the game's bsa(like the textures bsa)in the same directory, it will create the mentioned glitches. You need to upack them in another folder to avoid such errors.  "
