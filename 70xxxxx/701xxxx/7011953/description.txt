Plot: Drama. Oskar (Thomas Horn) is convinced that his father (Tom Hanks), who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, has left a final message for him hidden somewhere in the city. Feeling disconnected from his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock) and driven by a relentlessly active mind that refuses to believe in things that canÃ¢Â€â„¢t be observed, Oskar begins searching New York City for the lock that fits a mysterious key he found in his fatherÃ¢Â€â„¢s closet. His journey through the five boroughs takes him beyond his own loss to a greater understanding of the observable world around him.
