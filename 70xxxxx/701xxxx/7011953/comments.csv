,oldtimer48,2012-02-07T03:07Z,".BONE. can someone please help, is this version the one with 47,  14.3mb files for each cd, marked a.r ? too complicated for me if it is, or does ""repack"" mean you have packed all 47 files into one to assist hopeless cases like me?"
[V],.BONE.,2012-02-07T05:08Z,its avi and its a repack (rerip) because the video on the last copy was interlaced..
