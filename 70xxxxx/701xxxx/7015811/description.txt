-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Over Canada : An Aerial Adventure was released in 1999, and made
every cathode ray tube in Canadian electronics stores look beautiful.
It looped endlessly in every store you walked into. Then, the industry
moved up to flat panels & high-bandwidth high-definition video feeds.
And we all eagerly plugged our Over Canada DVDs into the upscaling
DVD player, ready for something akin to BBC Earth. Wow. Were we
disappointed.
  The DVD transfer of this video is a godless travesty of interlaced sadism.
Apparently, it was shot in high-definition, but whomever dumped it on
to DVD must have had an undying penchant for 1930's broadcast quality.
  I've been waiting for a high definition release of this flick, but I just
don't think it's coming. So, I dedicated a whack of computing cycles into
the SD feed, did a significant cleaning & deinterlacing, and we can once
again watch it without getting a bleeding-eyed migraine..
  I was unable to decimate the video down to a proper 23.976fps rate,
had to keep the NTSC 29.97fps, so any PAL people will likely have
to watch it on a computer. But the frames are now progressive, and
I used an excessive amount of bandwidth to maintain a nice clean
image.
