The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by rock band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, 
and was released on 9 March 1987 on Island Records. In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 
release The Unforgettable Fire, U2 aimed for a harder-hitting sound on The Joshua Tree within the limitation 
of strict song structures. The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music and depicts the bands 
love-hate relationship with the United States, with socially and politically conscious lyrics embellished 
with spiritual imagery.

Inspired by American tour experiences, literature, and politics, U2 chose America as a theme for the record. 
Recording began in January 1986 in Ireland, and to foster a relaxed, creative atmosphere, the group recorded 
in two houses, in addition to two professional studios. Several events during the sessions helped shape the 
conscious tone of the album, including the band's participation in A Conspiracy of Hope tour, the death of 
roadie Greg Carroll, and lead vocalist Bono's travels to Central America. Recording was completed in November 
and additional production continued into January 1987. Throughout the sessions, U2 sought a "cinematic" quality 
for the record that would evoke a sense of location, in particular, the open spaces of America. They represented 
this in the sleeve photography depicting them in American desert landscapes...
