Nat.Geo - UK - The Truth Behind Docu Series (2011) (UFOs - Atlantis - Ark - Lochness - ETC) Xvids


I made a smaller set and xvid format with mp3 audio from various sources
floating around to make a complete season/series collection

take it or leave it

but whatever you do please help to seed it.

enjoy

PS. I would say being Nat Geo that their experts would come
up with the usual BS about plywood strings swamp gas
and planets for things and humans crazy or seeing things
not there blah blah
but should be a interesting watch to see what they come up
with

contents

UFOs
Lochness
King Arthur
Crystal Skulls
Ark
Atlantis

hmm also wondering how much is stock footage
and poor quality videos over the new
stuff being captured on HD sources :)

the same experts same skeptics and what not

on well on with it we goooo...
