show as UK are very bad at renaming the same
shows for some queer reason

like they did with the beast man series"
[V],psspss,2012-02-06T07:17Z,opps I mean interview not interest hhhaa.. better head to bead for more sleep
[V],psspss,2012-02-06T11:50Z,"opps last comment was for the other ufo torrent hehe

anyhow
just watched the crystal skull one.. was very good and interesting
however the ufo one was the same old stuff really
anyone whos played with rc helicopters would of picked
up the fake as a model as I did :)
you can tell by the uneasy movement with the wind and the scale didnt look big enough
UK tried the fake ufo routine in previous ufo
docos up last year.. that one was rc plus
helium looked good but moved too slow
and didnt go to high anyone could pick it
as a balloon hoax.. 
guess some people can be fooled but that
dont and wont explain away some of the better stuff out there"
[V],psspss,2012-02-06T11:59Z,"but then to anyone watching it.. it is a ufo until its
known.. it was a weird device in the sky that didnt
match any of the normals liek planes helis or birds
or ballons..

so does it really prove people are gullible.. hell no
it proves they did see something in the sky
and video-ed it LOL

so whats the point of that experiment.. well
its pointless

still boils down.. either a UFO is 1) alien tech
2) human tech 3) misidentified nature like shooting
stars"
[V],psspss,2012-02-06T12:10Z,"as for the statement she was lying about finding the skull.. how come no one ever thought maybe she did.. and her father buried in order to surprise his
little girl in her great find and the story got out of hand
so he went with it so not to disappoint his daughter - little tricks and lies can get out of hand
and your stuck with it."
