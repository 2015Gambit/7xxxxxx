,azinorum,2012-02-07T06:51Z,TvTeam. I think its obvious from the various comments already posted that there is a problem with your uploads. I always seed for 4 days and there has never been a problem with your files in the past but recently all your uploads have no seeders (at least when using utorrent). I lived in the ME for many years and your uploads kept me sane but recently (for the past 3 weeks) it has been frustrating. Do you have any idea why this is happening? Perhaps its a utorrent issue? Regards 
,azinorum,2012-02-07T06:56Z,"This is the second time I put this comment forward. TvTeam, over the years you have gained my respect and following and all your efforts are much appreciated. Just recently all your new torrents get stuck at 99.9%. This being one of them. I use utorrent so I wanted to ask if you had any idea whats causing this clitch? I normaly seed for 4-5 days but nobody id seeding your uploads. What gives?"
,wired2,2012-02-07T08:40Z,Stuck at 99.9%
,SambalOelek,2012-02-07T09:07Z,"Stuck at 99,9%. :/"
,wired2,2012-02-07T09:45Z,Gave up on this and got it off TorrentDay
,SambalOelek,2012-02-07T11:12Z,"Got it!
I edited which files to download and chose to only have the actual movie file. Suddenly it got to 100%.

It's not like I need the sample file or the included text files etc..."
,liccleminkey4170,2012-02-07T12:42Z,"Thanks TVTeam another great upload! Is there any chance that you could continue to upload The Biggest Loser Australia, not sure whats happened to dear BigFish5, but I'm getting withdrawal symptoms and that ain't pretty on a girl ~ Thank you ~ much love and respect!"
,henglish,2012-02-07T15:34Z,Thank you!
