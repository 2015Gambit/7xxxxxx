Windows 7 PC testing features by PCMark 7 edition


Minimum requirements
All systems that meet the minimum requirements are able to run the main PCMark test and obtain a PCMark score.
OS: Microsoft Windows 7Processor: 1 GHz or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) Memory: 1 GB for x86 systems or 2GB for x64 systemsGraphics: DirectX 9 compatible graphics adaptorDisplay: 1024x600 minimum display resolutionHard drive: 10 GB free space, NTFS file systemInternet connection: required for product activation in the Professional Edition Click here to see if your PC can run PCMark 7

Recommended system requirements
Some tests require more powerful hardware. For the complete PCMark experience and the ability to run all tests use a PC that meets or exceeds the recommended system requirements.
OS:Windows 7 Home Premium or higherProcessor:1 GHz or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) Memory:1 GB for x86 systems or 2GB for x64 systemsGraphics:DirectX 11 compatible graphics adaptorDisplay:1280x1024 display resolutionHard drive:10 GB free space, NTFS file systemInternet connection:required for product activation in the Professional Edition
Specifically some tests require certain hardware in order to run all workloads:
- Entertainment test requires DirectX 10
- Computation test requires DirectX 11
When running these tests on a system with less than the recommended hardware, some workloads will be skipped. Scores from such systems will be lower than systems that meet the recommended requirements.

Licensed for commercial use

PCMark 7 Professional Edition is the only edition licensed for commercial use. The Professional Edition unlocks all features including custom testing options, unlimited test runs, automation and priority customer support. A commercial license enables you to use the benchmark for business purposes including testing for performance, conformance and stability, for research and development including component evaluation, burn-in testing and competitor analysis and for promotional use including trade shows, consumer events, overclocking competitions and other sales and marketing activities. If you are a member of the press please contact us for special licensing terms.
PCMark system performance tests

PCMark 7 includes a range of tests that give different views of your systemâ€™s performance. In the Advanced Edition you can choose which tests to run. The common use and hardware component tests are unavailable in the Basic Edition.

Overall system performance is measured by the PCMark test. This is the only test that returns an official PCMark score. The Lightweight test measures the system capabilities of entry-level systems and mobility platforms unable to run the PCMark test, but it does not generate a PCMark score.
Common use performance is measured by the scenario tests â€“ Entertainment, Creativity and Production â€“ each of which results in a scenario score.
Hardware component performance is measured by the hardware tests â€“ Computation and Storage â€“ each of which results in a hardware score.
PC test descriptions
The PCMark test is a collection of workloads that measure system performance during typical desktop usage. This is the most important test since it returns the official PCMark score for your system.
Lightweight test

The Lightweight test contains a collection of workloads to measure the performance of systems unable to run the PCMark test. On entry-level desktops, tablets and notebooks, only one application tends to be in active use at a time and it is rare to run computationally heavy applications. The Lightweight test is ideal for benchmarking systems using the Windows 7 Starter operating system and is also compatible with Windows Vista. At the end of the test your system is given a Lightweight test score.
Entertainment test

The Entertainment test is a collection of workloads that measure system performance in entertainment scenarios. Individual workloads include recording, viewing, streaming and transcoding TV shows and movies, importing, organizing and browsing new music and several gaming related tasks. If the target system is not capable of running DirectX 10 workloads then those tests are skipped. At the end of the test your system is given an Entertainment test score.
Creativity test

The Creativity test contains a collection of workloads to measure the system performance in typical creativity scenarios. Individual workloads include viewing, editing, transcoding and storing photos and videos. At the end of the test your system is given a Creativity test score.
Productivity test

The Productivity test is a collection of workloads that measure system performance in typical productivity scenarios. Individual workloads include loading web pages and using home office applications. At the end of the test your system is given a Productivity test score.
Computation test

The Computation test contains a collection of workloads that isolate the computation performance of the system. At the end of the test your system is given a Computation test score.
Storage test

The Storage test is a collection of workloads that isolate the performance of the PCâ€™s storage system. You can choose to test other storage devices in addition to the system drive. At the end of the test your system is given a Storage test score.
