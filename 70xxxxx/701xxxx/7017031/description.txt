SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

DemiÃ¡n Bichir did all the scenes of climbing up palm trees with no stunt double. 

Director Chris Weitz liked to do all the dangerous scenes in the script before he asked his cast to perform them. They had a stunt double to teach both DemiÃ¡n Bichir and Chris Weitz on how to climb a palm tree. After the Stunt man showed them, Chris Weitz was first to successfully climb the palm tree. "That is why in my films there is not much scenes that require stunt doubles" Chris Weitz told the audience at a SAG Screening.
