,daucuskarota,2012-02-13T18:33Z,With which scene release group does this DLC work? Razor1911? KaOs? Black Box?
,whiteorc,2012-02-20T08:28Z,i'm sure it works with razor - that's what i have.
,crowcrowcrow,2012-04-18T18:27Z,"Don't be silly, guys. While this is technically a DLC it's really just updated graphics so this does not require ANY particular version of Skyrim. It just overwrites images."
,RennFoxx,2012-08-02T00:15Z,It works! Skyrim looks way better now! :D
,Perpiris,2012-08-04T16:50Z,after which update can i install this?
