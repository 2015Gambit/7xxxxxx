  Former imprisoned convict, Kumar, returns    
  to the town where he was arrested. He        
  meets with his girlfriend, Kalpana, and      
  her uncle and aunt. He spends the night      
  at a hotel with a woman named Nisha. In      
  the morning, he wakes up with a gun in       
  his hand, and the lifeless body of Deputy    
  Superintendent of Police, Lobo, shot dead    
  in his room. He seeks the assistance of      
  Kalpana, who arranges for him to live at     
  her uncles' place. When Kumar, whose real    
  name is Raju, locates Nisha, and goes to     
  question her. The next day Nisha goes        
  missing. When Raju goes to talk to the       
  hotel manager where he was staying, the      
  Manager gets killed. Now Raju must run       
  from the police, as they seek to question    
  him for two murders, and possibly one        
  abduction.
