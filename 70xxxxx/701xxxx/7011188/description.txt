I am providing important films in ISO for the film buff or novice film historian. It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries. 
I would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)

This is a DVD rip to an ISO; you can watch it on your media player mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.

This file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:

American film noir directed by Billy Wilder co-written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler and produced by Buddy DeSylva and Joseph Sistrom. The script was based on James M. Cains 1935 novella of the same title which originally appeared as an eight-part serial in Liberty magazine.
