Alma is a collaboration between six-time grammy-nominated Cuban composer and pianist Omar Sosa and celebrated Sardinian trumpet and flugelhorn player Paolo Fresu, with guest cello contributions on four tracks by noted Brazilian conductor, arranger, producer and cellist Jaques Morelenbaum. The compositions are all written by Omar Sosa and Paolo Fresu, except for Under African Skies , a version of the popular track from Paul Simon s Graceland.  Blending acoustic and electronic sounds, the two create expansive interior landscapes in 11 original compositions enlivened by Afro-Latin rhythms and brightened by sensitive improvisation.
