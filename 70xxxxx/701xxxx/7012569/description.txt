[b]TVO - The Agenda with Steve Paikin, February 3 2012: Fearing the Future[/b]

The future was an exciting place, brimming with optimism. But now our movies and science fiction novels warn of dark days ahead. What happened to our optimism?

[u]A Bright and Shining Future Awaits[/u]

We've looked into the future, and it's dark. Increasingly, we've lost a progressive view of our future. Instead of seeing promise and lives made better by technology, we're seeing lives filled with cyborgs and an uninhabitable society. Should we be afraid? Or are we being unnecessarily pessimistic?
