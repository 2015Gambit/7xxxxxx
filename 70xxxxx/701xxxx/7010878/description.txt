In this Pre-Release 3 mojang patches the following that will be available when Minecraft 1.2 is Released THIS IS JUST THE PRE-RELEASE.



1. Many mob-related bug fixes (and some new behaviors)

2. Ocelots are easier to tame, and cats can be told to sit

3. Many small bug fixes and tweaks

4. Villagers will try to detect village houses and live in them

5. Updated language files (now with 50% less profanities!)

-------------------------------------------------------------

We decided to do an extra update of the snapshot this week. The reason was because of 

the shift-click bug when crafting items, which would consume all the items in the 

crafting table and only produce a single result item. This bug is troublesome because 

it?s such a fundamental feature, and we don?t want to penalize people if they forget 

that it?s broken.

We also fixed so that cats can be told to sit with an empty hand.
