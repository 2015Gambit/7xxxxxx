Ice Pilots: Season Two
Ice Pilots is back. The hit docu-series following the adventures of renegade Buffalo Airways returns for a second season of nail-biting challenges and compelling stories, featuring the pilots and crew who put it all on the line flying vintage warplanes across the Arctic. Our favourite faces and some new rookies show up for another season of thrills, chills, laughter and their most personal stories yet.


Part 5: The River Lift
A vital ferry link is down, so Buffalo mounts an all-out campaign to airlift 100,000lbs of essential goods across the Mackenzie River. As Devan and Scott shuttle goods nonstop, things really pile up for Jynelle in cargo. Meanwhile, Justin helps an RCMP corporal move to a new community, and expectant parents Rod and Sasha McBryan get the first glimpse of their baby via 3D ultrasound.
