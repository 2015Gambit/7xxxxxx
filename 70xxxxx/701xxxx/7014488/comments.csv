conan 2012 02 01 ?
conan 2012 02 02 ?

None of these were ever UL'd at TPB, eztv, or Demonoid. It would be way cool if somebody would."
,melbcro,2012-02-07T09:38Z,Have you tried looking for direct downloads?
,tazyla,2012-02-07T18:44Z,Thanks alot for this upload. But as the Burningbush said do you have those episodes as well?
,Captain_Spaulding,2012-02-07T22:00Z,"Yeah upload the other ones too please.
I know it's rude to complain about something you're not due, but I need my weekly dose of conan!"
,Avoca91,2012-02-07T22:05Z,"Where are last weeks episodes?!?!?

If no one is going to upload them, then does anyone know where i can ""direct download"" them or something. I am desperate here!
