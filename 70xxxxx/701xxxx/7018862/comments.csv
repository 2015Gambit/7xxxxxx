Was looking forward to kill Â˝ an hour with the old Zuma, but just a demo with a password protected serial..... so it kinda rendered it useless."

out of all of them
zuma delux has a compressed serial file(passworded) cant view it  
you cant leave ratings when deleting the torrent out of your file manager
