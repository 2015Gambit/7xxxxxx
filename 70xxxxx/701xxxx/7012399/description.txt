Plot: Ronal is a young barbarian with low self-esteem, the polar opposite of all the muscular barbarians in his village. Heâ€™s a real wuss. However, as fate would have it, responsibility for the tribeâ€™s survival falls on Ronalâ€™s scrawny shoulders, when the evil Lord Volcazar raids the village and abducts every living barbarian with the exception of Ronal, who is forced to go on a perilous quest to save his enslaved clan and thwart Volcazarâ€™s plot to rule the world. Along the way, our unlikely hero is joined by Alibert the buttery bard, Zandra the gorgeous shield-maiden and Elric the metrosexual elfin guide. To ultimately vanquish the enemy, the band must overcome awesome challenges.
