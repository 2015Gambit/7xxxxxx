Listeners should thank HighBridge for offering this 1990 recording of Garrison Keillor's visit to Mark Twain's house. It is both educational and fun, much like reading Twain's own work. Keillor is accompanied by humorist Roy Blount, Jr., and singer Pamela Warrick-Smith. Warrick-Smith sings some of Twain's favorite songs in a majestic fashion. Keillor interweaves sketches of Twain's life with readings of his favorite Twain quotations, swapping favorite Twain memories with Blount and doing more surprising things like playing the Twain family music box and playing against Blount on Twain's pool table. Both of these last two activities are marked by the odd sounds and precious moments that define live broadcasts and make this tribute visit to Twain's house a lovely listening experience. G.T.B.
