From Wiki:


Sting (born Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner on 2 October 1951), CBE, is an English musician, singer-songwriter, activist, actor and philanthropist. Prior to starting his solo career, he was the principal songwriter, lead singer and bassist of the rock band The Police.

Sting has varied his musical style throughout his career, incorporating distinct elements of jazz, reggae, classical, new age, and worldbeat into his music.[1] As a solo musician and member of The Police, Sting has received sixteen Grammy Awards for his work, receiving his first Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1981, three Brit Awards â€” winning Best British Male in 1994, a Golden Globe, an Emmy Award, and several Oscar nominations for Best Original Song. He is a member of both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. 








The Dream Of The Blue Turtles 1985


The Dream of the Blue Turtles is the first solo album by British pop singer-songwriter Sting, released in the United States on 1 June 1985, a year after The Police had unofficially disbanded. Though less successful than any of The Police's albums, it managed to reach number 3 in the UK Album Charts.[6]

It includes Sting's first hit after The Police (his first solo hit, "Spread a Little Happiness", was recorded while still a member of the Police), "If You Love Somebody Set Them Free". Though the song reached number 3 in the USA, it was a relative flop in the UK, where the album's track "Russians" (about Cold War nuclear anxieties, which had peaked in the 1980s) proved more popular.

The movie Bring on the Night documents some of the recording work that produced this album, as well as the subsequent tour.

The album is named after a dream of Sting's.

...Nothing Like The Sun 1987


â€¦Nothing Like the Sun is a 1987 album by Sting. The title comes from Shakespeare's Sonnet #130 ("My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun"), which Sting used in the song "Sister Moon". He added that his inspiration for this was a close encounter with a drunk, in which Sting quoted the sonnet in response to the drunk's importunate query, "How beautiful is the moon?"

The Soul Cages 1991 (Remastered 1998)



The Soul Cages is the third full length studio album released by Sting. Released in 1991, it became his second No. 1 album in the United Kingdom.[5] It spawned four singles: "All This Time", "Mad About You", "Why Should I Cry For You" and "The Soul Cages". The latter won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.

The Soul Cages is a concept album focused on the death of Sting's father. At the time, Sting had developed a writer's block shortly after his father's death; the episode lasted several years, until Sting was able to overcome his affliction by dealing with the death of his father through music. The first song written for The Soul Cages was "Why Should I Cry for You", and Sting has stated the rest of the album flowed quite easily after that first hurdle was overcome. Most of the songs have motifs related to sailing or the seas (Sting's father, according to Sting's autobiography, Broken Music, had always regretted not becoming a sailor.) There are also references to Newcastle, the part of England where Sting grew up.

Album opener "Island of Souls" tells the story of Billy, the first son in a family line of riveters. As he watches the ships his father create set sail, Billy dreams of taking his father along with him to escape by sea; his dreams become more prevalent as his father is injured and given three weeks to live. "All This Time" chronicles Billy's desire to bury his father at sea. The middle section of the record focuses mainly on the town Billy lives in and its people, before the highly introspective "Why Should I Cry For You". Musically, a mournful Northumbrian Pipe motif at the end of "Island of Souls" returns to open "The Wild Wild Sea", where Billy loses his way in a tempest only to find himself steered to safety by the spirit of his father. In another fantastical narrative on the album's eponymous track, Billy's father is being held captive by a demonic fisherman, with whom Billy wagers his life in a drinking game in a bid to set his father's soul free. Finally, the album ends with the moody, slightly-enigmatic "When The Angels Fall", which serves as a final thesis on the Catholicism which so heavily influenced Sting's upbringing; particularly regarding his father's spiritual beliefs. Musically, the song acts as a full stop for both the albumâ€™s content and Sting's own personal torment, with the songâ€™s fluctuating tonality finally resolving to a firm and secure G major, marking a return to â€œhomeâ€ (in this case, the home key of the earlier, conceptually significant, track â€œAll This Timeâ€) and providing an overwhelming sense of acceptance, redemption and subtle-nostalgia; beautifully realised in the albumâ€™s closing â€œlullabyâ€ motif. The character of Billy is referred to in the third person for the first three songs and in the first person for the last three songs.

In an interview with Charlie Rose aired on December 10, 2010, Sting mentions that he is working on a "mood piece", a musical project and book in collaboration with Pulitzer winner Brian Yorkey. The work will be based on an album he released many years ago concerning the loss of his father, growing up in Newcastle and witnessing the passing of the shipbuilding industry there. He admitted being scared of the prospect of pulling it all together but expressed confidence in it working out. This project has since been confirmed as the upcoming musical 'The Last Ship': set in Newcastle during the 1980s and featuring new material composed by Sting. Although the project is in its early stages of development, playwright and collaborator Brian Yorkey confirmed Sting has already written a number of new songs for the project

Ten Summoner's Tales 1993


Ten Summoner's Tales is the fourth solo studio album by the rock musician Sting. The title is a combined pun of his given name, Gordon Sumner, and a character in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, the summoner. Released in 1993, it explores themes of love and morality in a noticeably upbeat mood compared to his previous release, the introspective The Soul Cages.

This album contained two U.S. hits; "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You" reached #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and "Fields of Gold" reached #23.[9]

Ten Summoner's Tales was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1993. In 1994, it was nominated for five Grammy awards, winning Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance ("If I Ever Lose My Faith in You") and Best Long Form Music Video. It did not win Album of the Year or Record of The Year.

A long form video featuring alternate musical performances and live versions of all tracks was filmed at Lake House and released in conjunction with the album. The video went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video in 1994 and was directed by Doug Nichol and produced by Julie Fong.

The 1998 re-release CD includes a bonus video track of "If I Ever Lose My Faith in You". It also features the song "Everybody Laughed But You", which was excluded from the original 1993 release in the US and Canada. The song did appear on the original release in the UK, Europe, Japan and other territories, and the "If I Ever Lose My Faith In You" single. The instrumental track for "Everybody Laughed But You" was also used with an alternate lyric and released as "January Stars" on the "Seven Days" and "If I Ever Lose My Faith In You" singles.

The cover of the album was photographed at Wardour Old Castle in Wiltshire, England, featuring HrÃ­mnir, an Icelandic horse Sting owned for a period. The album was recorded at Lake House, Wiltshire, mixed at The Townhouse Studio, London and mastered at Masterdisk, New York.[10]

A different version of "It's Probably Me", featuring Eric Clapton, was featured in the opening titles of Lethal Weapon 3. This version is available as a single. In 1994, "Shape of My Heart" was featured in the end credits of LÃ©on, replacing Eric Serra's The Experience of Love (a track that Serra eventually used in his 1995 soundtrack for the James Bond film GoldenEye).

Mercury Falling 1996


Mercury Falling is the fifth studio album released by Sting. The album was marked by its tight studio production and use of brass reminiscent of recordings made at FAME Studios in the 1960s. This release was considered by many fans to signal the beginning of Sting's transition from heavier jazz-inspired rock to the adult contemporary genre. There was one uplifting ballad, the second single, "You Still Touch Me".

The track "Twenty Five to Midnight" is not available on every release of the album. It is listed in the official Sting.com discography tracklist, but was excluded from the American and Canadian releases. It however was included in the CD-Maxi Single of "You Still Touch Me", as the 4th track.

The album begins and ends with the words "mercury falling".

"Valparaiso" was used during the closing credits of the 1996 film White Squall.

Brand New Day 1999


Brand New Day is Sting's sixth solo album. A Grammy Award winner, it peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 and sold over 3.5 million copies in the United States alone. The song "Desert Rose" prominently features popular Algerian RaÃ¯ singer Cheb Mami. Originally, Sting's usual producer Hugh Padgham was to produce the record, but Sting was happy with the work done by Kipper, and Padgham was never called. Many sounds from Spectrasonics can be heard in Kipper's work on the record.

The full version of "The End of the Game" was included on the single for "Brand New Day" and the DTS and DVD-Audio releases of the album. The music video for the title track is a parody of bleach commercials, and advertises "Brand new 'Day Ultra'" brand.

Sacred Love 2003


Sacred Love is the seventh studio album by Sting. The album was released on 30 September 2003. The album featured smoother, R&B-style beats and experiments collaborating with hip-hop artist Mary J. Blige and sitar player Anoushka Shankar. Some songs like "Inside" and "Dead Man's Rope" were well received; and Sting had experimented with new sounds, in particular the more rock-influenced "This War".

Sting adapted the first quatrain of William Blake's Auguries of Innocence for the first four sung lines of "Send Your Love".

Sting's collaboration with Blige, "Whenever I Say Your Name", won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004.

Songs From The Labyrinth 2006


Songs from the Labyrinth is a 2006 album of recordings of the music of John Dowland by Sting and Bosnian lutenist Edin Karamazov. It entered the UK Official Albums Chart at #24[3] and reached #25 on the Billboard 200, strong charting peaks for a classical record on the pop album charts. The release was a slow seller for a Sting album, his first since 1986's Bring on the Night to fail to break the UK top 10.[4]

The album was released and re-released in several versions: LP vinyl and CD editions with 23 tracks, a CD/DVD edition with 8 tracks on the CD and a DVD documentary (released in both "CD size" and "DVD size" packaging), and a CD re-release with 26 tracks (including live versions of Sting's own "Fields of Gold" and "Message in a Bottle", originally recorded with The Police). To date, no edition exists containing the complete 26-track extended CD program and the DVD documentary.

...All This Time 2001


...All This Time is a live album and concert film by Sting, recorded and filmed on 11 September 2001. It was recorded at Il Palagio in Italy in front of a select audience drawn from his fan club and features live versions of Sting's songs from his The Police and solo song catalogue. The album and video get their name from the song of the same name from his album The Soul Cages.

As Sting wanted to put together a concert in his home, he enlisted a group of musicians to practice and perform this concert with him. The events leading up to the night of the performance were filmed, and within these events on the day of the performance, the New York terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, occurred, and the assembled group of musicians was made aware of this. Due to the tragedy, Sting offered all the opportunity to step down from the concert. None did, and the group performed the concert as originally intended, although Sting indicates on the DVD documentary the tone of the evening was quite different from how it was originally intended. Additionally, the "Desert Rose" performance featuring vocalist Cheb Mami was canceled due to the same circumstances. The concert was directed by Jim Gable and edited by Scott C. Wilson and Jeff Doe.

As a result of the tragic events, the concert was dedicated to those who lost their lives that day. Inside the CD booklet, upon the first page, is stated, "This album was recorded on September 11, 2001, and is respectfully dedicated to all those who lost their lives on that day." Thereafter, the lyrics for the included song "Fragile" are also transcribed; of the full song list comprising the CD, only the lyrics for this one song are within the booklet; this too seems a testament to the tragedy of 11 September.
