OK Gang think CAREFULLY before you download, for this is part ONE of goodness only knows how many parts in total for this is the start of many thousands of Karaoke tracks, in fact a major collection and the total download size will be many, many Gigabytes in Size and will take me two months or more just to upload and seed!

This is a re seed but totally updated with the new songs and many index errors have been corrected.  It appears first on Demonoid and only once each part is well seeded over there, do I then post it again over here and by the end of this series you will have a Karaoke collection of over 12500 tracks.   

Yes you will hear some DJ's boast they have over 30 thousand Karaoke songs,  BUT This collection all WORKS, Has NO DUPLICATES and is tagged and file named using Industry standard conventions so you can actually search and find the track requested!  

Now that is the thing here, many, many long hours have gone into ripping the original media and converting it to this machine friendly format.

Each download is a single RAR Archive due to limitations in the Bit torrent format and I will split each letter into batches of no more than 200 to 400 songs so as not to tie up your machine for too long.   Enjoy.  Index text file is enclosed with each archive un compressed so you may look at it first if you wish.
