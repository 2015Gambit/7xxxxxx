,keywest33,2012-02-08T16:21Z,"I am ""compressing"" cd contents again and will up it if needed let me know???"
[T],faren73,2012-02-08T17:06Z,"What happened to the previous upload? I was hoping to get the full recovery disk. I have an old Dell Optiplex GX270 that my kids are using and wanted the full recovery disk, since I don't have one. It should be Windows XP Home Edition OEM disk, can you up that as an image file?"
,keywest33,2012-02-08T17:41Z,@ faren73 I have that cd here and will try as i am new to uploading (I messed up utilities up and am trying to upload it again but just keep getting waiting for TPB upload) will keep trying

,keywest33,2012-02-08T17:56Z,@urez2beat sorry about that prob with upload but will re-up tonight
,urez2beat,2012-02-08T18:02Z,YEAH STUCK AT 73.8% and basically nothing seeds: 0 of 0 connected(0 in swarm) peers:8 of 34 connected(6 in swarm) So I don't know what happened but it was dloading great then all of a sudden somebody or something put the brakes on!!!
,keywest33,2012-02-08T18:04Z,files were skipped in last upload
[T],faren73,2012-02-08T18:05Z,"No, thanks anyway. I need home edition for recovery, but utilities and drivers might work anyway, don't need XP Pro unless you provide serial too. I will try this instead and see if the drivers and utilities work for me"
,keywest33,2012-02-08T18:28Z,"@ faren73 You must have ""missed last comment"" its home and ""green cd"" (dell factory cd)for optiplex No activation needed."
,keywest33,2012-02-08T18:30Z,Tryn to uload now but keep gettin submitting for upload and sticking there (will keep trying )
,keywest33,2012-02-08T18:40Z,"LOL I MUST BE ""BLOCKED"" FOR ""MAKING MISTAKES"" have both cds ready to upload but keep getting ""submitting for upload"" maybe its just traffic"
,keywest33,2012-02-08T19:38Z,still unable to upload 
[T],faren73,2012-02-08T23:18Z,"That's what I need! You should try just making one bootable image file from the disk using poweriso. It doesn't matter if it's an iso or daa. Maybe you need to delete your previous torrents first, before you can upload a similar one, I really don't know what the issue would be that would prevent you from being able to successfully upload this but please keep trying!"
,keywest33,2012-02-09T16:50Z,"@faren73  check this link as I think this is what you are looking for!!!!!!
