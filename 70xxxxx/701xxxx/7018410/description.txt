@@@ Description @@@


With Snagitâ€™s capture, edit, organize and share technology  itâ€™s easy to create engaging visuals that grab attention and keep it. Let images do the talking for you. Snagit will help you capture any image you want straight off your computer screen.

Enhance with transparency, callouts, and other effects to turn a simple screen shot into an eye-grabbing visual. Easily organize your images and use them again and again for other projects.

Then show off your Snagit creations to anyone. Just add them to your documents and presentationsâ€¦ or share using your favorite applications. It doesnâ€™t take much to explain a concept or an idea with Snagit. The images you create do the talking. And the more you use Snagit, the more ways youâ€™ll find to use it!

Here are some key features of "Snagit":

Combine images:
Â· Create custom graphics easily by taking multiple captures and putting them together.

Spotlight and magnify:
Â· Draw attention to a specific part of your image. Just select the portion you want and Snagit will blur and darken everything else.

Markup tools:
Â· Add effects to your image, even if you don't have a design degree. Draw attention with arrows, add a text callout or torn edge effectâ€¦just to name a few.

Auto-storing:
Â· All of your captures are automatically saved to your Library with the most recent viewable all the time. Save time by quickly finding all your past captures.

Tagging:
Â· Along with saving your capture, Snagit also stores information so you can find it again later. Search for your captures by date, website, or a custom flag that you create and assign.
