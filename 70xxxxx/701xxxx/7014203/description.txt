"The Blue Butterfly"

When Castle and Beckett investigate the 
killing of a treasure hunter, they discover 
the case is linked to a mysterious homicide 
from 1947 involving a hard-boiled private 
detective. Castle realizes the only way to 
solve the present-day murder is to solve 
the murder from the past. The 1947 case 
comes to life through stylized flashbacks, 
featuring Castle as the private eye and 
Beckett as a femme fatale.
