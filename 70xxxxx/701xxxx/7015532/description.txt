                        Announcement                     
           
                                                                             
                                                                             
  It is with a tear in our eye that we announce the retirement of Smart      
  Bitrate Control, and its encoding program, known as Nandub. 15 months ago, 
  Nandub created a stir in the community with its public debut, pushing the  
  bar of acceptable DivX quality much higher than it had ever been. For 15   
  months, Nandub kept this posistion as the best quality achievable. Alas,   
  all good things must come to an end.                                       
                                                                             
  For 3 months now, the VCDVaULT Emerging Technologies team has been         
  tirelessly benchmarking and assessing XviD and other new Mpeg-4 codecs.    
  XviD was chosen when it finally beat Nandub in blind side-by-side encoding 
  tests. XviD recieved an astonishing 60% of the total votes in a blind test 
  next to DivX 5 and DivX 3.11 encoded via SBC. (DivX 5 and 3.11 both        
  recieved 20% of the total vote). XviD is not only the best looking codec,  
  but it brings several added advantages with it. First and foremost, its a  
  GPL'd codec. Its free as in beer, and will always be free. It has a great  
  team of developers working for it to improve its quality day by day        
  (Nandub was determined to have reached the pinnacle of DivX 3.11's         
  possible quality and all development was frozen). And finally, XviD brings 
  us tremendous new technical tools. XviD will allow us to set compression   
  levels macroblock by macroblock, unlike DivX 3.11 which only allowed us to 
  set compression on each frame. XviD gives us complete ISO compatibility,   
  ensuring future compatibility with standalone devices.                     
                                                                             
  We here at VCDVaULT realize that a codec change is never easy. We believe  
  though, that we have provided a suitable migration path to move this scene 
  into the future and to ensure its continued success. Another GPL'd         
  community tool that will help immensely in this move, is FFDshow. FFDshow  
  is a set of DirectShow filters for the Windows platform that allows        
  decoding of DivX 3.11, DivX 4, DivX 5, MS Mpeg4v1,v2,v3, and XviD in one   
  complete package offering superb post processing quality. Not only that,   
  FFDshow also has builtin filtering capabilities to help better display     
  some of those old DivX 3.11 encodes you still have laying around.          
                                                                             
  Along with this announcement, we're also very happy to announce the        
  unilateral TDX approval of XviD usage in group releases. An evolving set   
  of standards is being approved now (and is attached in tdx2k2.nfo) that    
  will take the scene into the coming year.                                  
                                                                             
  So we have a handful of XviD rips to give you, as a small demonstration of 
  XviD's potential, XviD's quality, and the general future of the DivX scene.
  Some of the movies are old, some of the movies are new, but they're all    
  quite good, and we hope that you enjoy them as much as we enjoy bringing   
  them to you. And don't worry, The Matrix is not among them. ;)
