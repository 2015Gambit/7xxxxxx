,tardfingers,2012-02-10T06:55Z,no shit retard. its an anime movie what'd you expect!? 
,VirtualComet,2012-02-28T01:12Z,It works great! V-9/A-9. Its dubbed in English with no subtitles.
,ProphetZarquon,2012-03-30T19:43Z,"SirFuse was probably looking for this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4560124/Redline.2007.REPACK.DVDRip.XViD-XanaX

Which is a 2007 film by the same name.

That said, this anime is over 90 minutes and much much more worthwhile than the Eddie Griffin spectacle I have linked above.

In short, great movie.  Great size!  Great quality... 720x400 24fps, flawless image so far using VLC with no Post Processing."

This is the anime film [2009] I've been looking for, not the live action [2007] which I downloaded yesterday by accident. In the end I got two films for the mistake of one lol. It is in English Dub.

.BONE. Earns My +1 of Approval!"
