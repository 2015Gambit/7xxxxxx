Respected actor Paddy Considine moves to the director's chair for the first time with this emotionally powerful drama. Joseph (Peter Mullan) is a short-tempered alcoholic with a violent streak and just enough sense to know his life has gone terribly wrong. After getting in a fight with three men during a drunken bender, Joseph stumbles into a thrift shop run by Hannah (Olivia Colman). Joseph tosses random insults at Hannah for her strong religious convictions and desire to help others, but as he gets to know her better, Joseph develops a grudging admiration for Hannah. His feelings grow stronger when he learns just how dysfunctional Hannah's home life is -- she's married to James (Eddie Marsan), who has been subjecting her to humiliating physical and emotional abuse for years. Eventually, Hannah works up the courage to leave James, and Joseph takes her in. Tyrannosaur was an official selection at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.
