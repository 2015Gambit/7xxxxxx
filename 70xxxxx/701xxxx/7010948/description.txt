this torrent is a complete anime series torrent that is becoming increasingly rare at the moment (or so i found)

so this is just to make downloading everything easier because it's all in the one place.
i orignially downloaded these episodes from Nyaatorrents.org but noticed that every other seeder dropped off but me.
full credit for those that did the hard work, as i said, i'm just uploading to make things easier.

video quality SHOULD be 720p (so Nyaatorrents.org said when i downloaded it) either way, it looks good.
audio quality sounds good too
and the english subs actually make sense.

if the torrent isn't to your liking, keep the bitching and moaning to yourself, make a better torrent upload and f@&king seed it yourself.
all leach, not many seed and hardly anyone uploads.
so if you like it, please rate it & comment

so please, after you download - seed for a while. or put it on a scheduler so others don't have to wait as long as you did.

i'll warn you now, i've got a DL/UL cap and this torrent will be on a schedule. but you WILL get it - i hate it when people bail on their torrents and i won't.

Cheers guys and girls - hope you enjoy.
