There's no more torrents on tpb. Use magnet link."
,znavy264,2012-04-08T13:14Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!  You should never have to get new codecs for a .mkv file.  Not only does this file not work on my WD Live media server, but when VLC opens it, all I get is a green screen for 1 and a half hours."

,nagumo,2012-04-21T10:10Z,"Is there any way we could get some kind of herp-derp retard icon for users like, znavy264?  That way the rest of us know to skip anything they say by default.

Seriously, could you be any more of an idiot?  Video and audio codecs are regularly updated to add new features as well as enhance compatibility.

Yes, 10-bit encodes exist, and will eventually be the standard since it allows for higher color accuracy at 8-bit compression rates.  Try educating yourself before spouting off, znavy264 (aka herp-derp retard). "
