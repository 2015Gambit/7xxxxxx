Various Artists  Roots Of Rock N' Roll, Volumes 1-8
Label: Fremeaux & Associes, France
Released: 1996
Format: Mp3@320


FrÃ©meaux is the French labelâ€™s take on the immediate forerunners of American rock, music in the Southern tradition introduced through various media to be  discovered by Northerners and christened  rockâ€™nâ€™roll . Each two CD set contains a range  of boogie, with some swing, honky-tonk, blues, and country verging on rockabilly. Icons abound, including Little Richard, Bill Haley, Howlinâ€™ Wolf, Big Mama Thornton, Fats Domino, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Peggy Lee, Clarence â€œGatemouthâ€ Brown, Dr Feelgood, Flatt & Scruggs. But itâ€™s the obscure artists that make these CDs so engaging. Louie Innis, Wynonie Harris, Bumble Bee Slim, Skeets McDonald, Speedy West, and many other an excellent but forgotten musicians offer an intriguing glimpse of the breadth of Southern rock origins prior to the middle of the 20th century

Roots Of Rock N' Roll, Volume 1: 1927-1938



Legend would have it that Rockâ€™nâ€™roll was born in Memphis in 1954 when a young truck-driver by the name of Elvis Presley opted to sing â€œBlack bluesâ€ his way. A legend that drastically over-simplifies reality, however, for the roots of rockâ€™nâ€™roll are already to be found in the early recordings of blues, jazz and country music of the mid-1920s

Roots Of Rock N' Roll, Volume 2: 1938-1946

If, as one tends to believe, the Rock nâ€™ Roll era was born in the fifties, its build-up covered a long period. In this second volume of the Roots of Rock nâ€™ Roll, we discover the period from 1938 to 1946. The Southern music was changing with its popularity extending over the traditional boundaries due to the boogie-woogie fever, the upheaval of American society provoked by the war and transformations in the record industry. In this time of movement, the whole of America began to boogie in a way that was very similar to what was to be known as Rock nâ€™ Roll.

Various Artists - Roots Of Rock N' Roll, Volume 4: 1948

Throughout 1948 the Cold war did not appear to dampen the ardour of American dancers, whether white or black. They were bopping and swinging their partners around, throwing them above their heads, between their legs â€“ perhaps not yet really rocking, but one little roll would be enough to transform what was already a frenzy into a tornado. With this boxed set featuring both familiar and more obscure 1948 titles, you can tap your foot in time with American history
