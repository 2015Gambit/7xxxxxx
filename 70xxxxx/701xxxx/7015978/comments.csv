,HAAJHA,2012-02-10T11:11Z,Great torrent! Amazing quality! I'll let the torrent seed through the weekend.
[V],TheExecutive,2012-02-11T04:34Z,"The first 2 episodes have Norwegian subtitles.  How are we English-only viewers supposed to follow those?? Only Stephen Van Zandt speaks English in this series.

Gotta pass on this show, as much as I'd like to see it....at least till someone can get the first two
shows with English subtitles.

Van Zandt was great as the second-in-command both with Springsteen's E-Street Band and on The Sopranos!"
,mrpro2,2012-02-11T20:18Z,English subtitles (by Google translate): http://subscene.com/Lilyhammer-TV-series/subtitles-93183.aspx
,mrpro2,2012-02-12T10:55Z,"They are not great, but not so bad either. At least you can understand what they're talking about."
,Svaneper,2012-02-14T20:52Z,"Yarr! thanks alot for this lily, will seed this atleast a month (10mbit) or more if needed ;)"
,Svaneper,2012-02-14T20:54Z,"I've managed to find english subtitles for those who need, I cant guarentee the quality of the translation until Im done downloading (aswell as I am norwegian, and not so good in english), some odd happend while trying to post the link, but I'll give you the pages I found em; subtitleseeker.com  freesubtitles.com  podnapsi.net"
,REC394303,2012-02-16T11:01Z,"Not bad for a Norwegian production, but it did come short at some aspects. The sceneries could be coupled smoother together. You just don't go to a disco scene without following a person or to shoot one of the lead acthors, just as an example. Smell a bit like a hasty after production; lack of that last mill to put it well together. Let's hope second  season get rid of these errors. 
Maybe the humor is too local as well at some places. Worth watching though. "
,andorius,2012-02-17T17:23Z,"I am Norwegian, and understands everything. 

I could create subtitles for this show if someone can tell me how i can do it! ;)"
,andorius,2012-02-17T17:36Z,"I am norwegian, and i can create sub titles for the episodes! :D

Can someone give me a quick tutorial + where to upload?"
,Tholl,2012-02-18T03:44Z,"Excellent A/V, but missing the English subs.  "
,Vindeno,2012-02-18T10:06Z,"Thanks a lot! Great that you've uploaded this, too bad that the first two episodes have Norwegian subtitles only, as it scares away non-norwegians from downloading this, but you can easily find English subs by Googling. 

A: 10
V: 10
Show: 9"
,evilotto,2012-02-24T03:48Z,Good subs on the way...
,evilotto,2012-02-24T03:49Z,"For everyone needing proper subtitles for the first two epsiodes, here are the ones I've made which are nearly perfect and make it worth watching!"

,evazap99,2012-03-22T08:53Z,Could someone please do proper English subs for the whole season ? Useless to us otherwise... surely Netflix would have had this ? Or was it dubbed ? 
[V],Kuthumi,2012-04-12T17:38Z,"A 2-disc edition is available at cdon dot com, both DVD and Blu-Ray, with professional subtitles in English and Norwegian. The series was not dubbed, but made with dual-language dialogue. The main character appeared to understand everything said in Norwegian, but he himself spoke English, as did the other English actors."
,DOAP,2012-07-03T17:53Z,"if some 1 would pls make this an avi, mp4 file i would be very happy and thankfull"
