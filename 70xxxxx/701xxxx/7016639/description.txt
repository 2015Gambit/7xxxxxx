Workdone:
First off the video was very nice besides the video resolution changes half way threw the movie and there was alot of noise in the video. I had to do 3 cuts, I decide to keep the movie as the beginning resolution source and not lose much video and increase the resolution on the second half. Which turn out very nice. With all the filter I couldnt even tell. The flicker is pretty much gone if not gone and most of the noise. Tried some new smoother I havent used before which I turned out liking. 

Audio: The audio isnt the best and you can here people laughing in the movie. I did use a denoiser, lower the bass a bit and increase the overall volume.

Enjoy!
