After watching the first episodes of the new series on TV,
including the Christmas Special for 2011, I can say for
definate that Brendan O'Carrol (who plays Mrs.Brown) is a
pure comedy genius. He manages to tickle your funny bone
every single episode with this magnificent show.
Brendan is a true comic, who works to his every strength
in this show to produce this peice of magic. You'll
literally laugh your socks off with this programme.
Apart from the lead all the other charecters, especially
Winnie, add to the complete comic of the show.

A great show - and a must Download!
