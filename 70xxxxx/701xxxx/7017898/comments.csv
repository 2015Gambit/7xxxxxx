,Cyqua,2012-02-12T14:10Z,"Hi again KK,

I'm having some problems with opening any of the files in both Kindle reader for PC and even Calibre. Calibre says that the file name is invalid and I can't edit any of the file names or even delete them without deleting the whole folder.

Could you maybe try to rename the file and re-upload, please?

Much appreciated, Thanks!"
