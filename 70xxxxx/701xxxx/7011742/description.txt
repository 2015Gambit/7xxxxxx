(from liner notes)
"What began as a collection of Bluegrass all-stars playing some of their favorite old songs now sounds even more like a band, a true and fine working group whose members know, aticipate and appreciate each other's moves. They play and sing the songs with care and devotion, and, most important of all, with the kind of fire and drive that all great Bluegrass bands must have . . . there is freshness, power and a terrifying beauty here." --Bob Claypool
