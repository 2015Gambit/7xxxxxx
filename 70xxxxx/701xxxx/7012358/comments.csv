[T],MrDowntown,2012-02-06T08:27Z,I despise the fact that sometimes TPB freaks out about some characters in title/description. The funny thing is I swore i erased the apostrophe in the title.. ARGH!!!
,MuserClair,2012-02-06T10:44Z,":D  still appreciate the up, even if tpb has substituted the apostrophe! thanks MrD :)"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-02-06T17:58Z,Wait are you telling me its not called Fury@#$%^&*(S big Week!? I thought he just cursed a lot in the comic
,Xpatriated,2012-02-07T07:21Z,"Apostrophes, hyphens that are separated by spaces, ellipses.  I'm sure there are more.  They've ruined many of my description boxes."
[T],MrDowntown,2012-02-07T18:19Z,"Well in this torrent specifically I thought i had gotten rid of the apostrophe in Furys, what annoys me is sometimes it fine to use, : - ' other times TPB loses its mind"
