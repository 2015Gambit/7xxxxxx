I'm Sorry about the swedish sub.
Its a retail copy and i dont tamper with subs or do google translations.

Unfortunatelythe release plans for nordic countries has been danish, norwegian and swedish, finnish subs+audio.
Never retail releases is having more with all of the above languages.
And i will ofcourse not exclude it if it is there."
