It's a fact that men love lists: with lists, men can find the most interesting information with the least amount of effort. This book contains over 250 lists covering the most important subjects in life - cars, sports, barbecues, gadgets - and answers the most vital questions: Are Ferraris faster than Lamborghinis? What's the most common murder weapon? Who was the fattest Prime Minister? Which city has the highest proportion of women to men? and, What's the most alcholic beer in the world? No matter what your chosen subject may be, "Top 10 for Men" is a must for every pub-trivia king.
