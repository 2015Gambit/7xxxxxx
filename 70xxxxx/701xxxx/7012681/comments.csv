,harry_h13,2012-02-06T12:40Z,"Thank you, thank you, thank you so much! It really doesn't matter if you do because if there are people who chose not to post this on this forum then they should not have any problem if you do. There are hundreds of people here who are dying for this to be posted. Thank you for your kindness and great work from India."

,fc2log,2012-02-06T16:58Z,"Having seen these torrents and comments for a couple of years, I have the distinct impression that albiondean and pooloop uploaded MOTD for a while to get expats hooked and then pulled back into a paid website in order to make money off of content that they didn't produce and have no right to. (If I'm wrong, then why do they care when people re-upload MOTD?)"
,garryowen78,2012-02-06T20:27Z,"fc2log - where are they trying to sell the torrents?

If that's true, I'd like to say to albiondean and pooloop that 1) I'm genuinely grateful for all those dozens of MOTD torrents that they uploaded, which brightened up many a Sunday afternoon. But 2) that trying to get people to pay for pirated copy is a bad idea. Surely you guys could find some indirect way of benefiting from the publicity and popularity you've gained on this site? 

If mrsboatwright has re-posted their work, then he's certainly doing a good thing for the piratebay community, and I'd urge him to keep doing it. If it was in higher resolution that would be even better, but I'm certainly not about to get picky. 

So thanks for the upload, it's much appreciated. "
,Crokerite,2012-02-06T21:15Z,"Many many many thanks for this, cant appreciate it enough!"
,mrsboatwright,2012-02-06T21:32Z,"I downloaded MOTD for the last few years from albiondean pooloop and footballmal
This weekend no posts from anyone
Searched around a tracked down pooloops site.
Just wanted to get it out there for all football fans it is file sharing afterall
I got abit of flack for re-uploading pooloops torrent which i wont do again didn't realise it was against etiquette.
At the moment MOTD of the day can be downloaded at
pooloops site (search poolops match of the day)
He does do a lot of work to get a lot of football up and all he asks is for a donation if you want too.
or my new source
theboxbz
(which seem to be ok with re-uploads as long as they are credited)
Cracking download speed but eventually have to pay on this site not much though
But for anyone that wants it I will upload for the rest of the season here on Pirate Bay 
Does anyone have a problem with that?"

,stupotb,2012-02-07T03:26Z,Thanks mate :-)
,EdoSensei,2012-02-07T09:39Z,"pooloop, please consider the above comments. It is file SHARING afterall. We are all very appreciative of your efforts, but if you don't advise people where to go, then what do you expect?"
,garryowen78,2012-02-07T10:30Z,"pooloop - I just did a google search and found your site - haven't tried downloading anything from it yet, but it seems good, so I'll certainly try it out, and if you keep supplying high-quality MOTD, I don't mind making a donation now and then. However, all it takes is for one person out of hundreds of downloaders to re-post, and your stuff will appear on Piratebay - maybe it won't happen every week, but it will happen often, and I don't see how you can stop it. But I don't see that it should be such a big deal for you - people want to get the file quickly, and if you're posting it first, then many people will go to your site anyway, and some will make a donation. Then it will appear with some delay on Piratebay. Seems like a perfectly reasonable system to me, not worth getting annoyed about. "
