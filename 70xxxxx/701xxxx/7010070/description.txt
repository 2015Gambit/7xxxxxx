Savaging Spires (their true identity is still somewhat shadowy) might be from central England but they have created a world of sound where old ghosts can walk freely through these sunny grounds and impart equal doses of dread and joy. Take opener â€˜Bending the Rules of Timeâ€™ which immediately transports us with whistles, strings and those soon-to-be-familiar choral vocals. A kind of work song for the dead, it is a brief and wonderfully melodic songdream. In fact none of these pieces outstay their welcome, allowing us to feel as though we just happened to grasp them for a moment: music at once spontaneous and eternal.

In a break from the acoustics, â€˜Trustâ€™ employs stuttering feedback worthy of Washing Machine-era Sonic Youth before collapsing into hazy music box melancholy. â€˜Crowsâ€™ allows the mood to darken further with a repeated entreaty for the subject to â€œwake upâ€. It sounds like a wake outside the caravan and beneath the stars. It is left to â€˜Seconds In Motionâ€™ to close the record with a gentle reverie of harmonica and slide guitar. Another, until now hidden, continent creeps into view for a moment and we sense possibilities beyond these gentle haunted lawns. But thatâ€™s for another time, insofar as Savaging Spires pay attention to such constraints. For now we have one of the most evocative records youâ€™re likely to hear this year.
