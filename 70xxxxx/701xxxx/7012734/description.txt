Gasp as we find the perfect drift car for a gritty, Bourne Identity-style chase!
Cheer as we stage a race for all those unsung heroes of the movie industry!
Whoop as we find the car that makes the perfect dramatic exhaust note to dub onto
an action sequence! Make some other sort of noise we haven't thought of yet as we
attempt to emulate the classic Man With The Golden Gun barrel roll, having frankly
made a total hash of it when we first tried it on telly! All this plus a vast fleet
of sexy supercars and a man with a jet pack racing a skoda
