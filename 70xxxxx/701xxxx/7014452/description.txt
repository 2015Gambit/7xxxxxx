Kokomo Arnold: King Of The Bottleneck Guitar (1934-1937)
Label: Black and Blue
Released: 1991
Format:Mp3@320

Not only was left-handed slide guitarist James "Kokomo" Arnold an important early influence on artists like Robert Johnson and Elmore James that would follow, he was also, perhaps, the first "shredder" in guitar history. Arnold was known to be a fast player, and at times he would slide his bottleneck up and down the fretboard with such amazing speed that he'd struggle to keep up with his vocals. To further increase the dramatic effect of his songs, Arnold would also frequently drop into a haunting falsetto voice to accompany his fleet-fingered guitar playing.
