,EdoSensei,2012-02-05T13:51Z,"Well done! I hope pooloop doesn't get annoyed. As I mentioned in a previous comment, surely the point of him and others such as albiondean recording and uploading it somewhere else, is so that others around the world without access to it can see it.

But at the same time it's right that you should acknowledge their initial efforts."

,ocky1,2012-02-06T01:12Z,"not being funny mate, but didnt you read the warning in block capitals on pooloop's blog site that said ""IF I FIND ANY OFF MY UPLOADS ON ANOTHER SITE, IT WILL BE THE END"" (paraphrasing). seems a bit reckless posting here. dont you think that he would post it here himself if he wanted to. the least you should do is to check with him first."
