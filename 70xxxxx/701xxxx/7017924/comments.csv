,OmniNegro,2012-02-08T19:35Z,"If Skyrim was not a garbage console port it would have the high resolution textures at launch. But ""Modern"" consoles cannot even come close to using them, so they excreted the game and forgot to flush.

I love the game, but PC games are supposed to have uber graphics. That is why we spend boatloads of money on GPUs.

A+ for bothering to release it at all, but an F- for rushing to crap out a port that was only half there."

I hear that. Situation would be much less shitty if they released this on 11/11, not 3 months later when half of us already finished the game.

Anyway uploader thanks for this, will give it a try."
[V],Murlok,2012-02-08T20:24Z,OmniNegro  I just a uploader. for - as crap blame Reloaded:)
,ifran03tr,2012-02-08T20:42Z,45% >.< 
,OmniNegro,2012-02-08T21:13Z,"@Murlok

I know. Sorry. I meant to say that Bethesda should get an A+ for bothering and an F- for selling the game without the high resolution textures that should have been a priority for a PC release.

I know you are not responsible for it. I and many others do very much appreciate your contribution."
[V],Murlok,2012-02-08T21:52Z,Thx peers :)

,Unknown16,2012-02-09T06:31Z,"I can't really see that much of a difference except a pretty big FPS drop. I was expecting graphics compared to Crysis 2 but it's nothing alike, and I think the engine just got a whole lot laggier. Shame on you Bethesda, but thank you for the upload Murlok :D"
,fcdwn777,2012-02-09T07:29Z,"Quick question, I am semi new to torrenting and this torrent has me a bit confused. When I open it there are like 30 .rar files, and then 30 or so files of something else, and to be honest I am not sure what to do. It seems that if I mount the iso in one of the .rars, it is an installer. But I am not sure if I am doing it right. What exactly am I suppose to mount?"
,Palpatin3,2012-02-09T08:11Z,So patch 1.4 (not beta) is all in there?
,Palpatin3,2012-02-09T08:14Z,@Unknown16 Texture mean that you need a 64 bit computer with more than 4GB of ram and a graphic card with more than 1GB of VRAM. Texture needs more memory. So if you lag that is because you are short. Texture is the pasterns on the walls or ground.
,Unknown16,2012-02-09T19:46Z,"@Palpatin3

That's the thing though, I have 8gb of DDR3 1600 RAM, a GTX 580 with 3GB of Video Memory and Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. My processor is high also so it can't be that."
,OmniNegro,2012-02-09T22:06Z,"@Unknown16

If your FPS drops by a noticeable amount then something is wrong. I have seen that this is not the case on a system with a Phenom 955 x4 and 4GB of RAM and a Radeon 5850.

I do not think you need that much RAM for it to matter. I also think it works fine. So I think you are one of those dummies that thinks that they need 16x antialiasing passes and wants to whine that their FPS drops to nothing because of that ""User Error"". Set antialiasing to 2x or at most 4x and it will look just as good while delivering much better FPS. 

Take my advice or stop talking. The larger textures make antialiasing even more difficult and require even more VRAM.

Try disabling antialiasing and run around and see if you can actually see the difference in individual frame quality. Most people cannot. Your FPS will shoot through the roof however.

I hope this helps you."
,Unknown16,2012-02-10T01:11Z,"@OmniNegro
Didn't need to do any of those things. Nvidia 290.53 Beta drivers improved FPS performance by a lot. So next time you want to give advice, no need to be a prick."
,tenom,2012-02-10T03:26Z,"@Unknown16
I think i may know ur prob here, the laging is caused due to da update u made on dis pack dis sometimes hapen. The FPS drop might be due 2 ur machine or ur GPU simply chek ur cpu and take a look at it.
IF u wnt 2 experience high resolution texture uninstall and install da game again and note do update da game before playing

Kindly remind me if dis works
P.S.:PLZZZ dont blame BETHESDA STUDIOS"
,STONEDSTONER,2012-02-10T08:44Z,Much of an improvement??
,OmniNegro,2012-02-10T12:09Z,"@Unknown16

Despite your opinion, I was only trying to help. If you are offended by me suggesting that you may be a dummy then you are easily offended.

Care to share with the class what you did that helped?

I do find it funny that for calling you a dummy you respond by calling me a prick. Lol. You are right though. I simply cannot think of a kind way to suggest 16x antialiasing is retarded.

Oh well. I have seen and heard far more people complaining about FPS when they do not even understand the basics of what their graphical setting mean. You may well know it all. But I do not hear anyone else complaining about low FPS."
,Unknown16,2012-02-10T18:25Z,"@OmniNegro
Wasn't the dummy part it was the ""Take my advice or stop talking."" part. Even though your advice was pretty much retarded as me not updating my GPU to Beta drivers. Maybe I did take it the wrong way, but seriously, I got dragons to kill. "
[V],Murlok,2012-02-10T21:52Z,Easy Does it . We all friends:)
,OmniNegro,2012-02-10T22:30Z,"Agreed Murlok.

But I am a prick. I could have chosen my words better. Sorry.

Enjoy killing high resolution dragons. :)"
,accursedX,2012-02-11T02:20Z,Is this working ????
,Cash8844,2012-02-12T09:25Z,"Works great, tested last night actually noticed improved performance while running the hi res pack. Many thanks."
,daucuskarota,2012-02-13T18:32Z,With which scene release group does this DLC work? Razor1911? KaOs? Black Box?
