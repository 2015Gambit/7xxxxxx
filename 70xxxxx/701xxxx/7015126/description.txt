The fifth title of this exclusive and all new DVD collection for fans,
we take an inside look at the British actor, producer and musician for 
five decades: David Bowie. 

Most famous for his alter-ego, the ostentatious, androgynous ''
Ziggy Stardust'' during the glam-rock era of the early 1970s, Bowie has 
continually reinvented his music and image and is regarded as an influential 
innovator, particularly in rock music. 

He has had numerous top ten hits in the UK charts, most notably China Girl, 
Modern Love and Starman, with Space Oddity, Under Pressure and Let s Dance 
reaching #1, amongst others. 

Bowie is also a multi-instrumentalist, singing vocals as well as playing 
Electric, Acoustic, and Twelve String Guitar, Keyboards, Alto, Tenor, Piano, 
Harmonica, Xylophone, Tambourine, Drums, Percussion and many other instruments, 
making him one of the most multi-talented musicians in the world. 

Told through missing-believed-wiped archive interviews and rare and unseen footage, 
this insightful DVD is a worthy addition to any Bowie collection. 

Items genuinely unseen and never before appeared on DVD including film from the 
ITN archive. 

Includes lost and now restored TV interviews from the past and rare film of the 
singer talking about his career. 

A must for the die-hard fan!
