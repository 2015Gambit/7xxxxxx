,MisticBane,2012-02-08T04:53Z,Thank you so much LegendET... been wanting to see this! Will give A/V later after I watch it.  :)
,darobber,2012-02-08T05:15Z,A/V? .......
,MisticBane,2012-02-08T07:56Z,"As good as could be expected from LegendET, the first upload of this is better than most other first uploads of other movies.  A/8 V/6 (Audio is an 8 simply because its from a cam - but still good.) (Video is not too bad but does loop-back on itself at times throughout the movie so it gets a little lower rating.)

Still, it's a great upload and all the effort put in is really appreciated! Thank you LegendET for all your hard work and risk bringing this to us.  :)"
,andyb02,2012-02-08T08:57Z,"A/5 V/5 
Its watchable but not great. Picture is a little blurry and sound echos a little bit. "

,cyber_cop_101,2012-02-18T15:53Z,"Why exactly does this have a +9 on quality but yet the comments are horrible, So which is it people, good or bad... Can't we make up our mind? Trying to find a decent copy of something is frustrating sometimes, because people don't know how to properly rate a movie. They expect TS uploads to be blueray quality or something LOL and so they rate it 1 or 2, but someone who knows what they are doing it would actually be rated a 6 or 7 for a TS upload. So I never know how to judge these comments LoL... "
