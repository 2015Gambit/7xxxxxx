  In China theyre setting blistering speed records. From the go-fast,  
  rich kids quickly amassing stables of super-cars to the developers    
  building sky-scraping hotels  start to finish  in just 14 days.     
  One local rich list estimates China has almost a million              
  millionaires, 600 billionaires and the numbers keep growing at a      
  staggering rate. Private jets are flying out of showroom hangers at   
  mach 1. The economic transformation of China has been electrifying,   
  but with Europe teetering and the U.S. plodding can the biggest       
  tiger of all keep on roaring? The super-rich youll meet in our 2012  
  return certainly think so.
