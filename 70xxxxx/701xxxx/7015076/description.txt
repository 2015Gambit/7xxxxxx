DESCRIPTION:

Renowned cookbook author Susan Herrmann Loomis has traveled extensively to collect recipes that incorporate every kind of nutâ€”from almonds to Brazil nuts, and everything in between. In these delectable recipes, you'll see nuts as much more than a tempting snack. Loomis shows how they complement, and can be the centerpiece of, every single meal of the day.

Included in this imaginative collection are more than 100 easy-to-make recipes for small plates, salads, main courses, side dishes, and desserts. Start with breakfast and serve Waffles with Walnut Whipped Cream or Apricot and Pine Nut Compote. Share an evening with friends by serving Anise- and Fennel-Spiced Walnuts or Brazil Pesto with Pasta; next, move on to a main course of Gingered Fish on Spiced Macadamia Butter; and finish with refreshing Lemon Poppy Seed Ice Cream or Coconut Sticky Rice with Peanuts. Loomis provides an invaluable collection of The Basicsâ€”including recipes for Almond Milk, Lemony Hazelnut Butter, Poppy Seed Dressing, and Macadamia and Coconut Sprinkleâ€”for stocking every pantry and adding a new dimension to daily meals.

Along with the wonderfully diverse recipes in this book, you'll find nutritional information, menu ideas, and different kinds of foodâ€”simple, exciting, flavorful, unusual, easy, and good for you, too.

Nuts in the Kitchen is the ultimate culinary guide for using these wonderful, healthful ingredients in inventive, sophisticated, and astonishing ways. Whether you are a vegetarian, a vegan, or a meat eater, you'll find yourself turning to this book over and over as you prepare meals large or small.
