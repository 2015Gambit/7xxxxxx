,dirtydave99,2012-04-08T00:26Z,"Seems to be a discrepency about episide info from different sources. Maybe its a regional issue??

http://www.history.com/shows/americas-book-of-secrets/episodes/

At that link the episodes and air dates are the same as tvrage except for The Monuments, which is not shown.

Thanks for uploading - Looking forward to more regardless of any confusion.

Cheers!"
