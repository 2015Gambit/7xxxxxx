Lots of names of places are missing, and unless
you zoom really hard, some places are missing.
Anyone know what's going on here...?"
,Jan-Bertil,2012-02-09T21:37Z,"Disregard my comment above. Mapsource must have fucked up temporarily. After restart, it works."
,zeljko68,2012-02-10T17:53Z,how can I install?
,av_andrei,2012-02-11T15:32Z,work perfect; unlock with Garmin Keygen v1.5 + CF
,Wipuliwo,2012-02-15T12:46Z,"this isnt unlocked and Garmin Keygen v1.5 + CF doesnt unlock this what u have to do is install mapsource from garmin website, use the patch(u can find in a torrent here) and it will unlock then just send to device dont use mapinstall"
,216579687,2012-04-14T13:56Z,"Locked. You need to generate yourself a key with ""garmin map unlocker 1.5.exe"". Works well on PC. 

Can't transfer this map to Garmin device. Search for ""IMG"" version of maps for Garmin device."
