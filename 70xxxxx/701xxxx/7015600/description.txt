   BOMBER BOYS

  Actor Ewan McGregor and his pilot brother Colin explore the role
   RAF Bomber Command played during the Second World War,
   when it co-ordinated raids against Axis targets. The programme
   traces the obstacles and challenges that were overcome as the
   Royal Air Force developed the unit over six years of wartime 
   operations and highlights examples of individual heroism and 
   extraordinary collective spirit. Colin also learns to fly the key 
   aircraft of the campaign, the Lancaster bomber!
