[b]### NOTES ###[/b]

[color=yellow]It's a little late for our version but here it is :P Source is very good for a CAM, added a few filters to look more better, smoother, brightness & contrast, sharpness. First 2 minutes it's out of focus but then everything is alright. See sample for Q. Thanks to all who appreciate my work :)[/color]
