Vegetarian cooking has taken a firm foothold in our culture. Here you'll find a variety of savory meatless meals. Though the ingredients are simple to find and recipes a breeze to prepare, the emphasis is placed on purchasing seasonal produce for optimum flavor, nutrition and cost.
Also included are tips on nutrition in a vegetarian diet - a guide about how to get sufficient protien, profiles on legumes and grains, and information about sweetening alternatives.
