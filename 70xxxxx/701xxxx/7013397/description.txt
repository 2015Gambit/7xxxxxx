MotoHeroz

MotoHeroz takes the fun, fast gameplay of a Trials style game, adds it to a frantic rally race, and delivers a fresh new kind of side-scrolling, platform racing game. 

Players race, chase, and rally their way through a brightly colored world, competing against their friends for the fastest times, entering daily races, and hunting for secrets and coins. 

The game has three main modes: a surprising and fun single player adventure, a two to four player local party mode, and a new type of daily online competition, in which a new online track opens up daily to give you constant new opportunities for the top of the Leader Boards. 
Features: 

    Physics-based fun: Simple but effective physics deliver an addictive gaming experience. 
    Fun for one: Single player story mode with memorable characters and rich visuals. 
    Fun for many: Four player party mode that is easy for anyone to pick up and play. 
    Take on the world: Ghost race against any time from any track in the game. 
    Claim the top spot: Global and Friend-based Leader Boards let gamers compete against each other. 
    New type of daily competition: New tracks and Leader Boards opening each day. 
    Fully optimized: Steady 60 FPS, widescreen support, and blazing fast load times. 
    A complete package: 100+ tracks, four cars, and many game modes equals tons of fun!
