,upbeatanime,2012-03-30T04:11Z,"The free version has the download page:
www.fraps.com/setup.exe

simple and anybody can visit it. Could someone who bought fraps log in and see if they are redirected to an equally simple download page, or tell me if it is a custom download link per user account?

I thought it might be:
https://members2.fraps.com/setup.exe

but isn't, anything else obvious to try didn't work either. Not worth keep guessing. so somebody please tell us, very useful information. thanks in advance."
