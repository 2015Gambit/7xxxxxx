[V],Nepotu,2012-02-09T01:23Z,"Thank you guyz! Yes, ivo, it's very sad. If you don't buy stuff, you don't exist, you can die because they haven't any benefit. This is the free society. You're free to die and you're free to pay too. God bless you all, my friends!"
,ivo1978,2012-02-09T20:48Z,"Yes Nepotu, strong words but this is the bitter true! I'm now watching the 92' bulls championship run! I'm sorry that can't share some games and that I couldn't seed all the stuff you uploaded because of my HDD limits. Thaks anyway and apreciation for you efforts!"
