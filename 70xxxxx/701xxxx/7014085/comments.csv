Bill Press comes across like a high school history teacher who is just hanging on till his retirement in a month or two. The other guy (so memorable I've forgotten his name) attempts to make jokes and then laughs at them himself, and has a voice like fingernails on a blackboard.

But Keith!  Ah, who else could punctuate a soundbite from Christine ""I am not a witch"" O'Donnell with ""Wasn't that the beginning of an old Bob and Ray sketch...?""  (For those of you too young to know the immortal Bob and Ray, spend some time on Wikipedia or Google), report on a gaff by a female regional TV reporter who will be judging a sausage tasting contest, and then bringing in an expert to debate whether Rush Limbaugh, caught on video at the Super Bowl, was actually picking his nose, or just going for a quick internal scratch?

And I have to say that with no set, no props, no necktie, and the geek-chic black-rimmed glasses, he has never looked better.

It is (and, well, this is coming from Austria where local programming just sucks) the best hour of television in the world!

Time...Marches On!

Aloha!  (Where the hell did that come from?)"
