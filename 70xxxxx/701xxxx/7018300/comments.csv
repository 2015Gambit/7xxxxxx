,mw1987,2012-02-09T16:10Z,"FFS I'm still downloading after 12 hours and only completed 20%... I've already uploaded over 10GB...

FU! I've banned 37 ips who 100% completed and runned and didn't seed. Banlist is online.

Downloading via rapidshare now, goddamn selfish fucks. This is the reason I don't upload shit to public trackers anymore, filthy pigs."
,Bloodwyin,2012-02-09T16:34Z,"Correction, it is a general bug on loading levels, sometimes it can be avoided, but it is nearly unplayable because you don't know if and when you can download which savegame."
,Bloodwyin,2012-02-09T16:35Z,"@mw1987 you are just a torrent retard, downloaded the torrent in 23 minutes..."
,mw1987,2012-02-09T17:13Z,"@Bloodwyin
Good, cause I'm not uploading to public torrents anymore at all, because fucktards like you who leech all my speed and don't seed."

,mw1987,2012-02-09T21:43Z,"In the end you will cry like a slaughtered pig. Guys like me will stop seeding with +- 20mbit/sec. Torrents will die, because of fucks like you.

In the end, you will cry how SLOW it is for YOU.
Meanwhile I'm sitting on the side with a big smile and putting my middle finger up when you need any help :-)

I'll only upload and massive seed on private trackers now. If fucks like you gonna come to spread your cancer there, I'll go for newsservers.

You wanna act like an elitist? You gonna get raped by them, kid."

ROFL, you are DUUUUUUUUUUUMB, retarded low IQ!! Must be dumber than a cockroach!!
I said I downloaded the game in 1 hour via rapidshare: MORON, RETARD, DUMBASS, FUCKTARD, STUPID! LOL

,DrDoom66,2012-02-09T21:56Z,"@mw1987 It's you who did not follow any education, just look at the kind of senseless shit you comment. Your parents should ask your school for a refund, you dumb fuck. If you already downloaded the game from somewhere else just stop whining and get the fuck out. "
,mw1987,2012-02-09T21:56Z,"This game is not that great.
Its way worse than JA2, but it's still a decent game, especially since this is developed on a small budget.

Gameplay 7/10
Graphics 8/10
Replayability 2/10
Bugs / Incomplete 3 4/10

Too many bugs though, which makes playing the game sometimes frustrating.

Also no FOW, this game is really too easy. Even the demo was easy if you know what to do..."
,mw1987,2012-02-09T22:00Z,"@DrDoom66
I don't fucking care what you think of me. People who know me think I'm very intellectual and I don't give a shit. I love to be rude, cause you ask for it, you can get it, noob.

It's easy to talk behind your pc. If you got skills you would challenge me, noob.

1) You are probably a fucking leecher
2) Gtfo noob, you are not in my league

Go back to your hole, you stink!"
,Badah,2012-02-09T23:32Z,"This is not the final release, it's the beta from 2011"
,godziothc,2012-02-10T05:30Z,anyone else experiencing crashes when trying to use explosives to blow up walls?
,mw1987,2012-02-10T12:47Z,"I got the game completed over 60% now and encountered numerous of crashes and bugs, therefore I shall rescore my bugscore with 1 / 10..."
,ender917,2012-02-10T21:32Z,"!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD !!
This isn't the final release. It's beta release .91 from December 2011.

Also, you can only play the first level. Everything after that crashes the game. Wait for a final release one."
,BarbaricGoose,2012-02-11T00:25Z,Why are people saying this is a beta release? What proof of that is there?
,mw1987,2012-02-11T12:06Z,"@ender917
That's total bullshit!

As I said, I was at 60% of the game... Currently at 68%...
And no, it didn't crash after taking the airport, I completed many levels so far (toke 3 mines).

The problem is re-entering same sector (level) which always seem to crash (for example, level cleared: tactical view -> strategic view -> tactic view => crash)."
,ender917,2012-02-12T09:07Z,"@mw1987

Doesn't change the fact the game is beta. When your game starts up and is at the main screen, look in the top left corner. It says this is the build from December. The update fixes most of this, though.

So for those of you that are going to download, follow the instructions above and then go here:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7020808/Jagged.Alliance.Back.in.Action.v1.03.Update-SKIDROW
download that and then install that in the same manner you did this one. Don't forget to copy the crack over.

If you do these steps you'll have the full, updated game."

,m3my,2012-02-20T00:23Z,"pls somebody knows, why in JA:BIA isnt so many options on the main map like it is here in gameplay preview > gametrailers()com/video/e3-2011-jagged-alliance/715885

I did well, becouse I saw that trailer, preordered, then I tried this one (thx Skid) after that i canceled my preorder. Becouse its not that game what they were showing on E3.
Somebody knows why ?"
,Dasher492,2012-02-26T18:27Z,"I downloaded everything, put the Skidrow file in the installation files, and when i try and start up the game, nothing comes up. Help?"
,henrinissinen90,2012-02-29T16:38Z,"I'm unable to get the download link for this torrent file so i can could download this game on my Utorrent, is here anyone who could like send me the torrent file for this JA: BiA ?"
,henrinissinen90,2012-03-11T09:28Z,"I got the download link, just needed to update my torrent. And i would like to comment on the game while im here. I'm an old fan off jagged alliance back in 1&2, and dident knew what to expect from this game since its been quite long since i played Jagged alliance last time. But i've been playing like almost 11 hours per day this game, its so fucking great. And if you download this skidrow, and you update it( V1.03, V1.05, and V1.06) you dont have any problems.) My game can crash once in every 4 hours or so when sometimes downloading a map, but thats it. And it does automatic save before crash so no worries :D. I Suggest you buy this game to really support the makers, its worth it"
,Bucky0hare,2012-03-22T11:00Z,Great game but constantly crashes on me. i have updated to v1.11 any ideas anyone.
,badirama,2012-03-23T17:14Z,"Guys, listen, this game works beautifully, just download this torrent, install, and then download lates patch (for me it was 1.1 also from skidrow) and also install. After patch Jagged Alliance is so much better, its no beta any more. Very addictive, cool game. Just remember to seed, as someone seeded for you!"
,holloh,2012-05-04T22:09Z,"It installed fine, then I patched to the latest 1.13 from Skidrow. After launching the game in English, this is what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/e51Mg.jpg"
,Shegul,2012-05-08T20:57Z,"This game is blasphemy to JA series. Make great, turn based, tactical game and make it into... this. 

Game itself is so-so, but compared to previous games it's bullshit. Got tired of it after cleaning airport and came back to JA 2.5."
,bobby358,2012-06-15T20:18Z,"game crashes all the freaking time, cant even enter 1st town lol, useless"
