,wydna,2012-02-09T03:09Z,Im interested in this new update too. I actualy have an offical RW 2012 which has just been updtaed via steam but i don`t know whch files i would need to transfer across to my Skidrow version in order for it to work.
,TheNemmy,2012-02-09T14:21Z,"well according to rs.com they have also increased protection against cracks, OMG, but well who can beat skidrow :D"
,TheNemmy,2012-02-09T14:22Z,"@wydna
can you share what big changes (visually or solid) you witnessed in new update ?"
,wydna,2012-02-09T20:28Z,I haven't really had a good run with it as most if not all my addons are from torrents and won't work with the genuine version. One improvement i have noticed is far less juddering in and out of the cab. So if you watch the train pass in static cam it passes smoothly. Is skidrow working on the update as I'm eager to get on my cracked version!
