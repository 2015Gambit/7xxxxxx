delete everything you see there (skip those who can't be deleted).
that would bring you to a clean start.
launch the Installer and get to the point where you need to enter the registration info in the Installer.
head back to that folder you removed everything earlier.
(there would be like two new folders there).
just search for the ""ascrypt.dll"" in one of those folders (or might be even in one of it's sub folders) and replace the file (copy and overwrite).
then hit on next in the Installer to pass the registration part without entering anything in there.
you will see/get a popup window telling you ""Registration completed"" even though you did not enter any registration info.
that is the magic of this crack/DLL file.
good luck....."
