What the heck is an 800p, theres no such thing. Please dont use expletives. This is P2P, have respect for the guy. Even if you were to buy the Bluray (which you wouldnt - if you were one to buy, you wouldnt be here in the first place) you may not get 1080p - though you get that it would have black bar of pixels on top & bottom of each frame.

@peapiyush & @Pogue.Mahone &  any other noob complainers
Theres 1080p & 1080i. P is for progressive & i is for interlaced. The Full HD spec states a resolution of 1920*1080. The studios release discs - BD, DVD or whatever in different apect ratios - 2.4:1, 1.78:1 (or 16:9) etc. It is the display manufacturers who have popularized 16:9 for their commercial reasons.

If you are dismayed at seeing the black bars of videos which have a wider aspect ratio than 16:9, go buy a Philips Cinema 21:9 TV or Vizio CinemaWide XVT3D580CM"
