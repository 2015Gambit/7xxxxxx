mp4a is usually the audio codec for mp4 movie files i have got from tpb!!!
the a52 codec does not work with windows media player 12 in windows 7 & hence gives no audio for this movie!!!
surprisingly even quicktime does not give audio for this movie file!!!
if you download this movie you will be stuck with only vlc to watch it!!!
i do not install codec packs!!!"
