101 Dalmatians is a 1996 American family comedy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and a remake of the Disney animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), which in turn was based on Dodie Smith's 1956 novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians. It stars Glenn Close as the villainous Cruella de Vil, and Jeff Daniels as Roger, the owner of the 101 dalmatians. Unlike the 1961 animated version, Pongo, Perdita, and the 99 Puppies are all played by real-life dalmatian actors and none of the animals talk. Its theatrical sequel, 102 Dalmatians, was released in 2000.
