Develop Android apps without the pain of having to set up a development environment.


Setting up development for Android can be a real pain int he arse, and setting a development environment from scratch can take a whole day or more if you're unsure of what you're doing.

MotoDev studio automates this process reasonably well but it the current version has a buggy installer, and you still need to have the JDK installed, then download the Android SDKs and create emulator images. Plus you have to register at their site before you can download.

This VMWare image comes preinstalled with MotoDev studio and most of the Android SDKs (up to 4. something). All you need to do is open it in VMWare Player and you're good to start developing android apps straight away.

I can't seed at massive speeds, or even 24/7. But hopefully, if this torrent is popular enough and gets enough seeders, this will be the quickest entry path into Android development!
