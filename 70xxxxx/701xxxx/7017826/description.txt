Plot: In this follow-up to the 2008 worldwide hit Journey to the Center of the Earth, 
the new 3D family adventure Journey 2: The Mysterious Island begins when young Sean 
Anderson (Josh Hutcherson, reprising his role from the first film) receives a coded 
distress signal from a mysterious island where no island should exist. Itâ€™s a place 
of strange life forms, mountains of gold, deadly volcanoes, and more than one 
astonishing secret. Unable to stop him from going, Seanâ€™s new stepfather, Hank 
(Dwayne Johnson), joins the quest. Together with a helicopter pilot (Luis Guzman) 
and his beautiful, strong-willed daughter (Vanessa Hudgens), they set out to find 
the island, rescue its lone inhabitant and escape before seismic shockwaves force 
the island under the sea and bury its treasures forever. -
