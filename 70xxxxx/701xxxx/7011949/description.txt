thx

Encode:
well this screener needed a lot of work done.
It was very dark, colourless, audio was low and every 10mins the annoying watermark pops up.
fixed brightness, fixed colouring, fixed loudness of audio track, removed the watermark in
transitions scenes only so you wont see the watermark anymore, added sharpness and denoise.
looks like a proper dvdrip now, check pics and sample
added subs in srt
got very nice
enjoy
