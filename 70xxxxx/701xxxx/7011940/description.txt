Features:

Capture

â€¨ Quickly and easily record all your miscellaneous to-dos and store items in your inbox until you're ready to process and organize them. Capture it all on the fly with the quick entry panel, accessible via keyboard shortcut from virtually any application.

Organize

â€¨Use the powerful contexts feature in OmniFocus to categorize actions by work mode. When youâ€™re ready to sit down and make some calls, just click on the Phone context in your OmniFocus document in order to see all the phone-related tasks you have.

Sync

â€¨You canâ€™t accomplish your goals if you donâ€™t have them with you. OmniFocus synchronizes your task database with a server or disk, so that all of your Macs, your iPhone, and your iPod Touch are up-to-date. Sync over your local network using Bonjour, through the cloud using MobileMe or any standard WebDAV server, or even with something as simple as a USB drive.
