[T],Auge,2012-02-10T05:54Z,"Rasspitan:
I have two of the Criterion Trilogy posted already, Through a Glass Darkly and The Silence.
The missing one Winter Light I have and will post soon)."
,jfhjr,2012-02-12T15:22Z,"I'm going to download this Bergman ""Faith Trilogy"" when I have finished getting The Public Enemy. I don't want to get too greedy and the DL so far has been sporadically slow, then a little faster, and then slower again. Hopefully everybody will seed when finished. I will seed at least 60 days. THANKS to you Auge!! You Rock!!"
