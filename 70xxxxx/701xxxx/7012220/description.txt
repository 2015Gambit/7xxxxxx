Notes
â˜…This is a theme intended to replicate the look of Android 4.0's launcher & icons. The icons included are to replicate a stock experience and not an interpretation, therefore there won't be any additions other then system apps.
â˜…Regarding 'MovetoSD' availability: If the app is moved to SD Card, you risk the custom icons not loading properly because of how the system loads the SD card.
â˜…Launcher Pro users may need to wipe data if they are having 'Force Close' issues. Phone Settings > Applications > Manage Applications, choose Launcher Pro, select 'Clear Data' and then try to load the icons again.
