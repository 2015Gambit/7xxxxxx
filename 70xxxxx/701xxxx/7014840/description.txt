Ice Pilots: Season Two
Ice Pilots is back. The hit docu-series following the adventures of renegade Buffalo Airways returns for a second season of nail-biting challenges and compelling stories, featuring the pilots and crew who put it all on the line flying vintage warplanes across the Arctic. Our favourite faces and some new rookies show up for another season of thrills, chills, laughter and their most personal stories yet.

Part 3: Under Pressure
The curse of -40 hits Buffalo pilots Devan and Scott on a food mail flight up the Mackenzie Valley when a mysterious rise in oil pressure threatens to destroy one of the C-46â€™s engines. Rookie pilots Andrew and Graeme face the test theyâ€™ve been working toward for years â€“ getting â€œchecked outâ€ as DC-3 co-pilots. And when Jynelle gets pulled back into running Buffaloâ€™s cargo operations during her school exams, itâ€™s a recipe for a meltdown.
