I am providing important films in ISO for the film buff or novice film historian. It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries. 
I would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)

This is a DVD rip to an ISO; you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.

SYNOPSIS:  Pulp novelist Holly Martins travels to shadowy, postwar Vienna, only to find himself investigating the mysterious death of an old friend, black-market opportunist Harry Limeâ€”and thus begins this legendary tale of love, deception, and murder. Thanks to brilliant performances by Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, and Orson Welles; Anton Karasâ€™s evocative zither score; Graham Greeneâ€™s razor-sharp dialogue; and Robert Kraskerâ€™s dramatic use of light and shadow, The Third Man, directed by the inimitable Carol Reed, only grows in stature as the years pass.
