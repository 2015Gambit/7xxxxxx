 unless the ep is over an hour long i cannot see why this shold be rar'd to a 453mb file!!! if this 'speed cd' is makin claims of great tors of speed and quality then it's increased the size by 500%. hardly 'speedy'. a friggin 21 minute file 453mb?!?!"
,synchro_w,2012-02-09T23:39Z,453mb for a 11.23 sec file and 48mb for a friggin sample? this is not worth dloading. wait until someone puts up a normal 100mb file. piss poor episode anyway
,synchro_w,2012-02-10T01:26Z,"ok, rant over. but.. 453mb for 10 mins???"
,synchro_w,2012-02-10T02:21Z,"pleaseplease sceneline . don't assume everybody's got HDTV or HD monitor. i'm still usin my old CTX 19inch monitor because it works. i'm sure most ppl can't afford to buy new monitor if they already have a workin one. ok, it's big and bulky but hey, it works and that's enough for me. 
please try and keep the short tv files down to 200mb or less. it's watchin southpark on HD!! no point."
