,jordanidk,2012-02-05T19:40Z,"Whoever designed this camera deserves to be shot, it's a great game but unplayable for me due to the camera being far to zoomed, it's like playing with bloody tunnel vision. 

Add a zoom-out camera function and it'll be a great game, until then I can't really play it."
,SuperFulcrum,2012-02-05T20:01Z,is the game worth downloading?? or it is just another EA crap

,ohias,2012-02-06T02:14Z,"2Granchy: they absolutely should not. When the developers move from EA with their shady business practices like online passes/preorder bonuses/splitting games into DLCs then sure, I'll buy it. Before that they can blow me."
,sonic30,2012-02-06T02:37Z,"Played it now for 3h. Works like a charm, no problems so far. Yeah the Installation Language looks a bit odd, but the game is full (and only) english. Thx extremezone and THETA for another great release."

,OmniNegro,2012-02-06T09:43Z,"@watermelonseeds
Just because every other game company is doing the DLC/activation scam, that does not make it acceptable. They are all scumbags at EA. I truly hope EA's corporate headquarters burns to the ground with all the scum trapped inside.

Easily nine out of every ten games EA stamps their logo on is unable to even be completed on the PC at launch. They only do shitty ports and rush the developers because they WANT their games to be fatally flawed at launch. Then you have to update it and hope they fixed their late beta game that they sold as a final.

Others here can testify to that. EA is pure scum.

Thank you to extremezone from everyone. (I am no touching this one, but thank you anyway.)"

,OmniNegro,2012-02-06T20:07Z,"When you jackass kiddies claim extremezone gave you virii you demonstrate that you know exactly dick about what is happening. Go get ass-fucked by a freight train.

Your virii are from elsewhere. You arbitrarily decided to blame someone because you are too dumb to determine exactly where it came from.

And to the babies saying there is no zip... You are retarded. It is a zip64. Windows may not be able to extract it, but Winrar can easily. 

Running the setup/install is pointless.

Just extract, copy crack and play. No serial, no networking, no registering the game. (Skip that garbage on your first run and it will work fine.)

Those of you who cannot figure this out are either stupid or children. Grow up or get someone without a dick in their mouth to explain it to you in tiny words and/or grunts.

Respect where respect is due. Thank you to those who help, and a major league fuck-you to the babies who want to blame everyone for all of life's problems."
,cloudsora,2012-02-06T20:28Z,"I love noobs who complain about virus's and other shit from a VIP's upload.
extremezone's torrents USUALLY aren't complicated and this one wasn't."
,L3GiTPro,2012-02-06T21:09Z,"It would help if the installation was in English but I was still able to follow through without an hassle.

I downloaded NFS Run and the installer was like this and the crack seemed to be a virus but not a dangerous one.  Just a typical crack one.  I am not saying that this torrent is a virus in anyway and if I do get a virus alert it will not be because it is a dangerous one it will be because it is a crack.

Will probably report back after install is done."
,Kadian04,2012-02-06T21:09Z,I thought this wasn't out till the 10th? Anyone that can explain? o.O
,OmniNegro,2012-02-06T21:53Z,"@Kadian04
It should hit store shelves tomorrow the seventh.

As per the usual scene, we get a preview of the final without the hassles that the retail customers have to endure.

I have a purchased copy of Saint's Row 2 that cannot be installed at all without Steam and all that nonsense. I would not be surprised one bit if I had to download the whole damned game to install it. (After installing that steam malware.)

I came here and downloaded a scene release that allows me to install it and be done. No steam, no registration, no nonsense. I now download a copy of every game I will purchase since a scene release is usually much better than the retain garbage. (I still purchase my games, but I will not be suckered into using their excrement anymore.)"

thanks extremezone dling and will seed till the next week!"
,majuaraan,2012-02-06T22:14Z,"@kadian04 yeah cuz you know, they dont  start physically producing mediums untill the day a game comes out, use your head!!

Also this happens with some games: when I exit the game, and open task manager I still see 2 reckoning.exe*32's, and access is denied when trying to close them, How can I kill them? as they take up like 400mb of ram?

Also why No AA setting in this game? nvidias AA is too stessful for my Gcard."

Much Obliged.
I intend on buying Mass Effect 3 at the beginning of March, but as per usual. Bioware just like many other companies are insisting that we must install ""Origin or Steam"" the two main ones I can think of right now.

It's ridiculous but if I intend on playing Online with Mass Effect 3, I have no choice.

I'll be downloading this game, but I don't think I'll take my time to buy it.

Thanks for the information.

@therhymesmatter

1) They is no need to be so rude about it.
2) Your comment was redundant.
3) Merely saying ""The Scene"" does not explain anything. Many people are unaware of what this is.
4)I agree this is a create upload by Extremezone, one uploader that has never failed in my opinion."

As for the game itself, it got hyped up, not nearly as good as I thought it would be.  Its fun, sure, but it really doesnt deserve the 9.0/10.0 ign gave it.  Good job to EA publicists for making a big deal out of a normal game.  R.A Salvatore deserved to get his name connected to a better game, thats my opinion anyways...."

,MicronSeD,2012-02-07T20:36Z,"@maxamilliongat damn seems like you're spying on me, anyway around 5-6 gigs is far more than not seeding anything. If you need some tips about understanding why you can download blurays in 10 minutes it's cos they're not 1 day old or they don't have 8k leechers more than seeders."
,insidius,2012-02-07T20:38Z,"downlaoded it and everything worked perfectly, but when i turned my pc off and the next day on again i fucked up!! it said that some file was missing, so i downloaded it, but when i had done that it needed a new file! after donwloading all that it just said error and some weird ass shit and now i cant play it !!! 
anyone knows why ?"
,Sareth88,2012-02-07T21:31Z,"Downloading at 50kb. uploading at 1000kb+

Downloaded: 2.27Gb  uploaded: 16Gb

At this rate, you can be god fucking damn sure you won't get a single bit of seed from me IF i manage to download this (next week?). I'll probably have uploaded 50gb by then anyway.

BTW i live in a relatively poor eastern eu country where this upload speed is not even considered fast. Or expensive. So i don't get where all these fuckers with medieval upload speeds come from."
,crimsonradiance,2012-02-07T21:47Z,I'm having the same problem as ciuberkis; it simply says it's stopped working at the troll startup image. Any help would be appreciated :)
,Shadow926,2012-02-07T21:56Z,"I managed to download it within a day (speed was below 100kb/s at first, but towards the end I got up to 4Mb/s).
All that time I've been uploading at around 2Mb/s, capping at 4Mb/s upload.

Now, I've set my program to stop seeding at 44.1 gigs (6.00 ratio).
I think the problem isn't hit'n'runners, but the pure fact that this is a multi-tracker torrent with over 10k leechers vs 2k seeds.

Anyhow, installation worked fine, game is playable :)"
,OmniNegro,2012-02-07T22:15Z,"@Sareth88

In America most ISPs give great download speeds but only the most pathetic upload speeds.

It is not even close to uncommon for people to have multiple mebibytes per second down and only 128 kibibits per second up.

(To the newbies that think I misspelled that I suggest looking those words up.)

Also some American ISPs have awful restrictions on uploading. They plainly drop connections when you actually try to use your bandwidth. And they never guarantee even the pathetic rates they sell.

So remember that despite appearances, not all leaches that fail to seed have done this by choice."

,paulgilbert2000,2012-07-24T08:34Z,"this has been posted many time with no answer what so ever !

how do you fix the non responsive keyboard issue.

after character creation the keyboard does not work. at all.

for some reason no one also found a fix for this on other sites.

NOte: googling Koa + keyboard not working brings up many censored searched results in response to a some complaint

is there a secret someone is keeping or what?!"
