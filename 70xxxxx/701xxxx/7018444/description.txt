Well Done Gang, You grabbed that pretty quick and here is the 2nd part.   By the end of this series you will have a Karaoke collection of over 12500 tracks.   Yes you will hear DJ's boast they have over 30 thousand Karaoke songs,  BUT This collection all WORKS, Has NO DUPLICATES and is tagged and file named using Industry standard conventions so you can actually search and find the track requested!  Now that is the thing here, many hours have gone into ripping the original media and converting it to this machine friendly format.

Each download is a single RAR Archive due to limitations in Bit torrent and I will split each letter into batches of no more than 200 songs so as not to tie up your machine for too long.   Enjoy.  Index text file is enclosed with each archive.
