 Prabhakar (Jiiva) is a Telugu teacher in       
 a private school, who leads a lonely life      
 in a dungeon lodge. He is frustrated and       
 even tries to commit suicide, in a system      
 where knowing your mother tongue and           
 teaching it is looked down upon by a           
 society which craves for material benefits     
 which results in financial in security for     
 many.These frustrations and circumstances      
 make Prabhakar mad as a result of which he     
 kills nearly 23 people all in different        
 situations ranging from a railway booking      
 clerk to a customer of prostitute house.       
 Finally he finds a private channel cameraman   
 and confesses to him his killing spree. In     
 the flashback, he unfolds his painful at times 
 beautiful-past and the reasons for his passion 
 for the Telugu language.
