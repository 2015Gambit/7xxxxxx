        Plot .......: After tragically losing his wife to breast          
             cancer and struggling to raise three young children on       
             his own, real life super hero and modern day Forrest         
             Gump, Terry Hitchcock seized on an idea. He wanted to        
             accomplish the impossible: run 75 consecutive marathons      
             in 75 consecutive days to bring attention to the             
             incredibly difficult lives of single-parent families. He     
             ran in spite of freezing rain and unbearable heat, in        
             spite of chest pains and bone fractures that wracked his     
             57-year-old body. He just kept running - each day, every     
             day - strengthening an unbreakable bond between father       
             and son--- not stopping until he broke the finish line       
             tape in Atlanta. MY RUN is more than a film about a guy      
             running multiple marathons; it's a film about the daily      
             marathons we all run in life.
