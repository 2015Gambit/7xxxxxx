The Biology Of Cancer (2007) By Robert A. Weinberg, Garland Science.

ISBN 0-8153-4078-8

PDF format, scanned in 300 DPI in color & OCR.
White edges cropped, and chapters are in separate files if you don't need all.
Original page numbering kept, so you can use the contents page.

Index and glossary not included, they're useless if you have OCR, you can use the search function.


This is one of the best books on the subject of cancer and costs over a $100.

I have other textbooks scanned on TPB as well, and every once in while I upload more, but I prefer to upload as anonymous.

I usually seed for a few months or until ~100:1 upload ratio. 
Enjoy, seed and keep knowledge free.

Cheers.
