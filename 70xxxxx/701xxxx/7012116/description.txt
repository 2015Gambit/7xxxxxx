He's a top fashion photographer who has everything: glamour, glitter and even a ravishing wife who can't get enough of his nonstop lovemaking. But when an accident takes her life, Arnauld flees to a remote French village. There he meets Tessa... a wild Oriental nymph of the fields. Arnauld can't shake the image of this erotic temptress, even when a nymphomanical client and her luscious models arrive for a photo shoot. These girls distract our lonely widower for a while (not to mention the horny villagers! ). But Tessa is the women he wants. Finally, she is his for a night of unrelenting passion where The Seduction of Tessa becomes a reality.
