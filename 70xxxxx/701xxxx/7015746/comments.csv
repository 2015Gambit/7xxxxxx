,hitchup,2012-02-08T08:33Z,"VFR Appalachia is first in our series of highly detailed east coast USA airports meant for pilots who prefer to fly the mid-Atlantic region. As the product title suggests, our aim was to recreate real-world airports in FSX for those who prefer low and slow short hops between airports. The eight airports in this series were developed from our on-site visits and birds-eye-view shots from our pilot - Jay, so what is rendered in FSX is what was captured realistically from real-world.

VFR Appalachia comprises:

    Eastern West Virginia Regional Airport/Shepherd Field (KMRB), West Virginia
    Cheat River (WV31), West Virginia
    Front Royal (KFRR), Virginia
    New Market (8W2), Virginia
    Moran Field (MD99), Maryland
    Seven Springs Borough (7SP), Pennsylvania
    Nemacolin Resort (PA88), Pennsylvania
    Ingalls Field (KHSP), Virginia"
