This comprehensive guide to location portraits teaches the basics of good head-to-toe posing, indoors and out, and shows the classical approaches used throughout photographic history to create a pleasing rendition of the human form. Additional introductory chapters detail the four main posing styles and reveal how to determine which will work best with a subject, their clothing, the location, and the purpose of the portrait. Chapters for advanced photographers highlight the creation of a wide variety of individual and group posesï¿½including ground, seated, head-and-shoulders, and standingï¿½to be utilized in tandem with stairs, rocks, and other architectural and natural elements. A chapter devoted to the essential business skills needed to professionally schedule appointments, work through consultations, manage sessions, and present and deliver final prints is also included.
