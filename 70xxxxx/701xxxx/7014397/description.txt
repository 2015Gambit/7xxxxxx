Chris Farley - Chris Rock

An unlikely man raised by ninjas, goes against a counterfeiter with the help of the criminal's girlfriend. 
Following a ship wreck, a baby is rescued by a clan of Ninja warriors and raised by them as one of their own. But Haru, as he is called, never quite fits in, nor does he manage to make a worthy Ninja. However, the good-natured and persevering Haru, in his own bumbling way, and with some help from Gobei, manages to prove himself to be a winner in the end.

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
