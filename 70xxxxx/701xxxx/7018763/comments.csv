,bucket1970,2012-02-18T08:48Z,"Sorry, I'll eat my words. I uninstalled/installed this over my Deluxe version, and it didn't register as Premier at first for some reason until later (after an update?). It's all good! Thanks a zillion uploader!"
,sidsimon,2012-02-18T19:09Z,I am grateful for this as I am for all the uploads here. Long Live PB!!  
,AdamantiumAngel,2012-02-25T03:51Z,I wonder if this'll still be good for doing taxes in 2012.
,AdamantiumAngel,2012-02-25T04:05Z,That was poorly worded.. I meant I wonder if this is for doing taxes in 2012.
,alen129,2012-02-27T23:57Z,"@AdamantiumAngel. Yes this is for tax year 2011 which are supposed to be filed in 2012 and by Tuesday, April 17, 2012. hope it helps."
,Falcon_Claw,2012-03-01T04:50Z,Nice upload thanks a bunch!! it is premier Like says!! if u have the 2011 biz addition I would be most greatfule
,skycrath,2012-03-07T02:18Z,Does anyone know how to get a free second state? 
,derekg,2012-03-13T01:04Z,"If you install on two machines and pick different state on each machine, then you'll have two states.  If you have only one machine, install virtual machines."
,Turtle126,2012-03-17T01:20Z,"Dumb Question but can i file my taxes with this? I mean i know that is what it is used for, what i meant was does the fact that im downloading it from here prevent me from actually fileing? "
,meckmeck,2012-03-22T21:22Z,@Turtle126 Yes you can file with this. It acts as if you bought it from the store.
,clamenza,2012-04-03T02:43Z,Is there a multi-state hack like in years past?
,Silentscope,2012-04-12T04:13Z,"So will this work next year for the 2012 tax year, which is to be filed in 2013?"
,jrdenn1981,2012-04-14T05:28Z,"@ Silentscope  - Yes, this is for taxes due Apr. 15, 2012. Cheers!"
,BYaO,2012-04-18T09:38Z,i paid $19.99 for the free state e-file.
