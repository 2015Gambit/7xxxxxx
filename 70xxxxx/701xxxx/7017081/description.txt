Tabula Rasa was a major progressive rock group from Finland in the 1970s.

Tabula Rasa was founded at Kangasala in 1972. Founding members were Heikki Silvennoinen (guitar), Tapio Suominen (bass) and Asko Pakkanen (drums). The main influences were the prog-rock bands Jethro Tull and Tasavallan Presidentti. 

Later, Jarmo Sormunen (flute), Jukka Leppilampi (vocals), Jarno Sinisalo (piano) and Jukka Aronen (drums) also played in the band. Most of the songs were written by Silvennoinen. The lyricist was often Mikko Alatalo, a well known Finnish musician who was never an actual member of the band.
