,hick619mind681,2012-02-08T18:12Z,is it w8 beta?
,barkerbob26,2012-02-09T23:20Z,"ms will always be ""making adjustments to improve the os"" even after it's released... who would want the latest of something by MS? it started out decent, then they for some reason included the ""desktop"" feature. worthless. "
,ClipperCigars,2012-02-24T11:01Z,"No, it's not the latest. No one ever said it was. It's good for those of us that want a complete version history. Even better because this is one of the leaked beta's, pre free preview version. (Windows 95 was so much better when it was still in Chicago beta version 3xx before Apple made them take out all the cool features it had to avoid a lawsuit.)


@barkerbob26. No, the desktop is not worthless. It is absolutely necessary for anyone trying to do real work. Not everyone is a computer illiterate casual user who only checks weather & facebook.

The big issue is that they crippled the desktop so much, that it's not functional for much. At least win7 and earlier, you had instant single click access to everything from apps & games to configuring & setup to shutting down. Not anymore. :( But even in it's reduced state, it's still more functional then Metro. I keep trying to remind myself, it's still beta preview, and maybe will be better by release, but holy cow, Metro as it stands now (as of 8102) is the most useless, un-effective back-asswards cluster f--k of an interface that only makes it harder and slower to do anything. 

Facebook on a tablet or something, yeah fine. But I got specific system tweaks to make under control panel, and videos to transcode, and excel spreadsheets to update, and remote server maintenance to perform, and application testing to do, and iso's to region patch, and archives to expand, and files to archive, and pic microcontroller programming to do, and rom's to dump, files to ftp, and I still haven't gotten to the more casual things like email and web research yet. 

I like the new task manager, I like the new file copy/expand window details, I like it has expanded networking functionality. The rest of it, new desktop included is a massive failure in my opinion. Beyond my extensive trial testing & use of 8102 and collecting releases for the sake of it, I'm personally never going to actually run this steaming pile of functionless fluffy bloat until I'm forced to kicking and screaming because of some future app that I must be able to use requiring it.
