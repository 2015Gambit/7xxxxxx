Carson Kressley is the most recognizable name in menâ€™s fashion today. With a legion of fans who hang on his every tip and quip, Kressley has single-handedly made it cool for the average guy to care about clothes. In Off the Cuff, Carson makes over the tired menâ€™s style guide with an edgy, hilarious romp through every manâ€™s closet: from socks to scarves, from jeans to leather jackets, from the dreaded pleated khaki to the classic pink oxford.

Trading trends for timeless style, Off the Cuff helps readers abandon the chase for â€œthe newest blackâ€ or tomorrowâ€™s version of the mandarin collar. Kressley delivers a guide that mines each manâ€™s unique personality and physique and lets readers in on his best-kept secretâ€”that the only thing sure to stay in fashion is the man who wears whatâ€™s right for him.

Vibrantly illustrated with full-color photographs, and written with Carsonâ€™s signature wit and irreverence, Off the Cuff is poised to deliver what Queer Eye fans have always wanted: Carson in their closet.
