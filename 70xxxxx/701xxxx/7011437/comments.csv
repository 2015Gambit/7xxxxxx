,Purple_Monster,2012-02-07T20:15Z,"Yes, I'm having trouble too. I have tried several times to download this torrent but it always hangs, showing zero seeds in Vuze even tho PB may show several seeds. The download never begins. Defective torrent file, perhaps?"
[T],Xichael,2012-02-07T21:22Z,"After 24 hours at 0.0%, I can confirm that something is wrong with this torrent.

You'll have to grab the 720p version: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7011398/"
,libertaswv,2012-02-08T02:05Z,"Thx for the confirmation, all. Very strange to see this from TvTeam w/out comment

Be sure to check out Purple Monster's informative comment at the helpful link provided by Xichael above.

Can't find it anywhere on a public tracker.... The only good copy i've seen available as of this comment is @ TheBox (aka 'Seed Purgatory'). Hannibal (Box encoder/uploader) put up a file labeled 'Call the Midwife s01e04.thebox.hannibal.avi'. Hopefully it will filter out, but.... Nuthin' yet.

Also in the Dept of Strange, check out the isohnt page for 'Call.The.Midwife.S01E04.720p.HDTV.x264-TLA'. Look at the tracker list."

,tontotx,2012-02-16T11:29Z,stuck at 99.99% for two days now...any help please?
,tontotx,2012-02-16T14:49Z,any chance of getting a good seeder?
,tontotx,2012-02-19T13:41Z,"Still stuck at the same place, says there's one seeder but why can none of us finish this then? PLEASE HELP TVTEAM!"
,bhyllsman,2012-02-21T06:44Z,stuck at 98% for 2 days says 48 seeders but none on line dont waste your bandwidth on this one
,freeware17,2012-03-10T18:34Z,Can only reach 96.2%. So near yet so far!
,freeware17,2012-03-10T18:36Z,Stuck at 96.2%. So near yet so far!
,freeware17,2012-03-10T20:18Z,Don't waste time trying to download this torrent.
,fogcoast,2012-03-12T04:10Z,"I too hit the wall with this torrent at 96.2%, BUT, if you have a torrent client that allows you to skip the 5 files ( 2 txt, 1 nfo, 1 sample avi, and 1 jpg) extraneous to the main avi file it will put your download status up to 99.9%. You'll notice the main avi file still reads 99.9% but I played it in Divx Player and it appears to be the complete episode (beginning & end credits & randomly checked middle sections all good quality). Hope this helps folks."
