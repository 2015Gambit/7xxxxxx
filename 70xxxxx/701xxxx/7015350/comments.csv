,Gcentral,2012-06-20T17:19Z,"Quality is great. Gave me the feel of cinema hall. My sincere thanks for packing short films featuring Scrat and Sid in addition to the four Ice Age full length films. Overall, it's a great download. 10/10!"
,3x3tr4tor,2012-06-25T20:25Z,"@ Talemunja :

Turn on your download client, right click on ""GET THIS TORRENT"" and select ""copy link location"". The rest is easy."
,rogerm68,2012-07-02T12:25Z,Ice Age 4 is an entirely new and different movie. It has nothing to do with the Ice Age Xmas special.
,taelor_Z,2012-07-14T23:37Z,yaaythnx! love these movies! :)...
,Soul7Dev,2012-07-18T23:56Z,Very nice torrent dude 
,jjiminian,2012-07-24T20:56Z,Perfect!
,Ansari49,2012-08-08T23:48Z,"Great work but u tricked us.
Ice age 4 is just for a piece of fun it is not originally the 4th part of Ice Age."
,thereisnoother,2012-08-11T18:10Z,"Excellent quality for the size. Considering the size, I would say A/7 V/8. If the audio is too soft just turn it up but low end is lacking ...although, what do you expect with 4 movies at only 2.21 GB?? :-) Overall, I am not complaining because this is great for kids, fast download, and much better than expected quality.

,jupiter45,2012-09-02T12:29Z,"Thank you.I don't understand why some people are complaining about this torrent.Audio is soft,the last Ice Age is not in it,this and that.People be grateful,you get this for free.Stop bitching or go and buy it."
,Nalaik,2012-09-27T20:26Z,what about the video quality of ice age 4 ?
