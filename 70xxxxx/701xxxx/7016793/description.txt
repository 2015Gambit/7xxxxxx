The Winds of Change by Various Artists
Nearly 15 years have passed since South Africa rose from the oppression of apartheid to become a democratic country. Winds of Change is a unique collection of South African music and extracts from significant political speeches that charts the journey to freedom from the struggle days right through to eventual democracy.

Through folk songs, freedom songs, tribute songs and narrative, the special story of the nation of South Africa unfolds, revealing the massive role of music as a means of protest and survival. All songs chosen for this collection speak of the miraculous journey to democracy either with their words or by symbolising a specific era. This collection traces the incredible journey of a nation that defied all expectations; our Mzansi.

Winds of Change is the musical discography of the South African story, touching on the horrors of apartheid, and later the unbanning of the ANC, and the beginning of a free society.

Heartfelt songs such as Amampondo\\\'s State of Emergency, Johnny Clegg\\\'s unforgettably impressive Asimbonanga, Stimela\\\'s Whispers in the Deep, Johannes Kerkorrel\\\'s Halala Afrika, Hugh Masekela\\\'s Bring him back home, Skeem\\\'s Waar Was Jy and Sibongile Khumalo\\\'s Sabela are all included on this iconic album.

Between the songs you\\\'ll hear excerpts of various iconic speeches such as Mandela\\\'s Rivonia Trial speech, PW Botha\\\'s Total Onslaught speech, FW de Klerk\\\'s unbanning speech and Mandela\\\'s inauguration speech.

This album highlights how crazy things were in SA and how far we have come; to see South Africans - regardless of race - singing Nkosi Sikheli I\\\'Africa or Shosholoza at sport events is still a goosebump affair.
