IconPackager In Action

Overview
What makes IconPackager special is that unlike Microsoft\'s themes which only change a few icons, IconPackager changes hundreds of icons. A package of icons contains icons to replace most of the common icons on your Windows PC. 

Everything from \"My Computer\", \"Recycle Bin\", Folders, all the way to specific file format icons such as .doc and .xls files and any other file type a user wishes to use. With its shell integration, IconPackager also allows users browsing through their system to right-click on any file and go to the added \"Icon\" tab and change the icon.

Installation notes:
==================

Run IconPackager_public.exe
After installation, copy the file from the crack folder to the installation directory, overwriting the existing file.

For extra Icon Packs, copy the folder \"Stardock\" to \"my documents\".
