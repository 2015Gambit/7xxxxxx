,buttslaya117,2012-02-07T12:47Z,The audio is messed up. After nine minutes the left channel cuts out and it's like that for the rest of the episode.
,buttslaya117,2012-02-07T20:13Z,"Oh I'm dumb, if you play with VLC you can set the audio to the right channel only so it'll play through both speakers. So it's not really an issue, unless you don't watch it on your PC."
