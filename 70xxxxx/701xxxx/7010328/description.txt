The majority of data contained in this archive is the culmination of my research into conspiracy related topics over the past five years. I have archived vast sources of knowledge to be contained in a virtual library of mostly PDF and HTML format. The importance of this information transcends all materialistic and monetary concepts, therefore if you wish to support the authors of the works provided, you may do so on your own time. A great portion of the information contained may not be 100% accurate, so always use your own discernment and reasoning while reading.

Information relating to anarchism, aliens, astral travel, consciousness, conspiracies, dreams, esoterica, freemasonry, gnosis, hallucinogenic drugs, illuminati, politics, occultism, science, science fiction, spirituality, wilderness survival, and universal knowledge.
