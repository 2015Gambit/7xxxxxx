[T],V100,2012-02-06T16:05Z,Why? Almost all of the commercials sucked.
,wind4ken,2012-02-06T19:12Z,Hi...I just downloaded the file.   Took a long time to download.  Now I can't get it to play.  I end up with 50 files with this type of ending.  orenji.r50...How do I play this file?  Thanks.  Mac user here.
,n.audeh,2012-02-06T20:54Z,"wind4ken, you need to download a program called winrar for your mac and then you need to merge all the files together to get one big file. Once you have done that open it in winrar and extract the video."
,midiboy2,2012-02-06T23:31Z,"If you want to see the Super Bowl commercials, they're easily found with a Google search. If for whatever reason you want Madonna's half time show, that's easily available right here on TPB. "
