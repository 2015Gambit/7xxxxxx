It's AWESOME!  And since it's from eztv you know the quality rocks.
A:9.5
V:9.5

How'd you miss S05E15 of Big Bang Theory?  I almost thought you were gone or something!  ;)

If it weren't for EZTV, I'd never see any TV.  Sometimes I feel so guilty I go out and buy things I don't need and fill out the customer satisfaction survey and write in that I bought their product because I HAD NOT heard about it in TV advertisements."
