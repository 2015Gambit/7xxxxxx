Somewhere on TorrentFreak, I found out a simple comment, that with the magnet links, the whole Pirate Bay fits on USB stick. So, I thought, why not test it out?

So, I went trough all the Pirate Bay torrents and downloaded as little necessary information as possible for the dump to be somehow useful.

And wow, ALL the pirate bay magnets are just 164 MB unzipped, 90 MB zipped. That is really, really small!

The format is simple. An example:

7015954|Ubuntu 11.10 Alternate 64-bit|707047424|2|5|5316391aed813d4283178dce2b95c8ad56c5be72

7015954 is the piratebay ID of the torrent
Ubuntu 11.10 Alternate 64-bit is the name (there CAN be "|" in the name)
707047424 is the size in bytes
2 is the number of seeders at the time of the snapshot
5 is the number of leechers
5316391aed813d4283178dce2b95c8ad56c5be72 is the magnet link hash


If you want the magnet link correctly, you have to write
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:5316391aed813d4283178dce2b95c8ad56c5be72

I did NOT download comments and/or descriptions, since that would be too big and I didn't want it to be as complete as possible, but as small as possible.

The only thing that's strange is that I found out only about 1.5 millions of torrents, while there is something about 4 millions of torrents in TPB footer. However, I think I am correct and TPB footer is not ;)

Enjoy.
