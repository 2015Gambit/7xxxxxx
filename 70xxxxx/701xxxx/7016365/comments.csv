,allisfine,2012-02-09T00:58Z,"(Hello YCombinator!)

I went trough all the torrents, but as a logged out user. This may be the reason why I saw only 1.5m of torrents.

I went trough the torrent description sites like
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/$i

It took the computer about 2 days. I can post the script somewhere if you want, it is in perl, it is not complicated at all."

I ran in to this problem when making my youtube upload scheduler (java) http://code.google.com/p/ytuscheduler/

I worked around it by cutting the string up in to an array based on the delimiter, then counted the length of the array, then i pulled the first 2 and the last 3 elements of the array assuming the remaining was the file name. Seems to work out well - no reason the same couldn't be done here. "

the file looks sort-of-sorted, but it's not. If you sort it by ID, the first torrent is 3211594, the second torrent 3211609, the third (and the first one with any seeder) 3211623

to all:
you need perl, curl and Parallel::ForkManager module to run the skript.

Otherwise you could just open up this file in wordpad/gedit/whatever and search for what you want. The format imformation is being store is as stated in the description: TPBID|TorrentName|SizeInBytes|Seeders|Leachers|MagnetLinkHash

 What you do is take the MagnetLinkHash and place after: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:

IF MagnetLinkHash is 123456789123456789 then what you do is this:

magnet:?xt=urn:btih:123456789123456789

I don't know much about programming, but I think it would have been better if you replaced the ""|"" symbol either in the torrent titles or as a separator.
Trying to import the file as delimitated text in excel or access, there are about 2000 torrents in which ""|"" is present as part of the title, so it screws the sorting.
