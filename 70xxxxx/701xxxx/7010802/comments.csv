,micoyol,2012-02-23T13:45Z,"Hello Sir.
Thank you for this great software I always trust you , I downloaded no VIRUS in it, I installed , but it only give me 30 days, maybe I am doing something wrong.
Would you please tell me how use the Daemon loader , because there are three files of Daemon Tool files in it .
Than you Sir."
,belelegnmm,2012-02-25T10:19Z,still says 20 days left what shall we do up-loader any idea ?
,pletibaba,2012-02-28T02:01Z,garbage

,Anonbrebz,2012-03-11T14:24Z,"works good thanks, ignore the idiots there's not any viruses"
,raserdude,2012-03-12T01:06Z,this does not work only trial version
,AdamantiumAngel,2012-03-12T02:07Z,Hm.. Gives me a 20 day trial..
,AdamantiumAngel,2012-03-12T02:10Z,"Just a theory.. But that ""loader"" might reset the trial days left to 20 each time you use it? But that would still be rather annoying. I haven't tested that. It would be cool if the uploader would offer some assistance lmao."
,InsaneHoboSRB,2012-03-19T17:29Z,It installed correctly but I'm not sure about the loader... Is it just supposed to renew the trial to 20 days or what because when I use it it still says 20 days trial...
,TrueOne_,2012-03-19T18:29Z,fake and gay don't download this crap doesn't work.
,AJ-jollyroger,2012-03-21T18:16Z,"IT WORKS IF YOU CAN GET WINRAR TO REPAIR IT 
IN WINRAR TOOL BAR. THAN LOOK FOR REBUILT IN FRONT OF THE NEW RAR FILE. IF YOU DON'T YOU GET NOTHING OR SOMETIMES A 1.5 MB FILE
& NOT THE 17 MB FILE.
WEBCHELLA 
CAN YOU RELOAD IT. PLEASE CHECK THE RAR FILE.
IT ALSO ASKED FOR VOLUMES"
,AJ-jollyroger,2012-03-21T18:18Z,"FORGOT. GUYS WITH THE VIRUS CALL.
EVERY VIRUS PROGRAM THAT READS THE WORD 
              ""KEY""
IS GOING TO SAY VIRUS OR THE WORD CRACK.
                    VIRUS"
,eguyreurguyrhtr,2012-03-24T07:52Z,"You people are thick.

1. Install the program.
2. Move the loader into the program folder.
3. Run loader.
4. Do the human race a favour by mutilating your reproductive bits beyond repair with a blunt instrument."
,batman79,2012-03-30T02:36Z,"For fucks sake people, please listen to eguyreurguyrhtr. Especially step four you stupid mother fucks."
,AdamantiumAngel,2012-04-01T18:20Z,umad. lmao
,AdamantiumAngel,2012-04-01T19:02Z,"Can't figure it out.. First tried just loading the ""loader"" exe from the original folder it came in, didn't work. Tried putting the whole ""Loader"" folder in the program directory and that didn't work. Tried just having the exe in the program directory, didn't work. Renamed the exe and overwrote the other on in the program directory and just makes everything lock up and freeze. So I'm out of ideas."
,narmishe,2012-04-02T15:54Z,"@webchella, thx for the share, but this dosent have the key, you should change the title, however it has a loader that lets it run beyond the 20 trial days. cheers"
,vkonline,2012-04-07T21:40Z,"lol @eguyreurguyrhtr, @batman79 :DDDDDD"
,tmn8,2012-04-10T22:37Z,Guys Its got a trojan. make sure you have an antivirus installed before installing.
,calvinvalerian,2012-04-11T15:26Z,LOL When someone say there a trojan in the file. It reminds us of condom XD
,johndovas,2012-04-11T16:31Z,it's not a virus... but it's not working as well.
,BossBadger,2012-04-12T07:11Z,"Doesn't work. I moved the loader to the install directory, ran it, allowed the main exe in my antivirus, and there was an error in a foreign language when I tried to open.

Bullshit :/"
,BossBadger,2012-04-12T07:41Z,"Use this one:

,evadbmobevid,2012-04-16T02:50Z,works. you just have to repatch every once in a while.
,Versaveli,2012-04-22T01:26Z,That sucks. AVG detected a Trojan. Watch out.
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-29T05:37Z,it says it detected a trojan. so i can't move the loader folder :(
,MrAwesomeLuis,2012-04-29T05:42Z,"hey you don't need a crack, just delete the trail license you have "" i found it in , the c drive, program data, daemont tools pro,   and then launch the daemontools pro icon thing . it will ask fo a liecense and click trial and bam you got20 more days again, i think you got to keep doing this but if the crack is a trojan then yeah it is better this way"
,pa1ner,2012-05-02T22:24Z,Piece of shit!
,Marty9231,2012-05-03T18:36Z,"Ok it's really not that hard:

1) Download torrent, unpack everything

2) Install Daemon Tools Pro with a TRIAL LICENSE

3) DO NOT start Daemon Tools, if you have: ctrl+shift+escape and close every Daemon Tools related process

4) Copy the Daemon Tools Loader to the folder where you installed it.

5) Run the loader

you now have an activated version of Daemon Tools Pro"
,minatokrunch,2012-05-26T17:26Z,"so yeah, i put the loader in the program file and i still get that i need to buy a liscense and to make matters worse, it went down from 20 days to 2 in just 10 minutes >.>"
,jonatan80,2012-06-02T22:19Z,can't get it working whit win7 64bit
,Sbargain,2012-06-03T13:27Z,@eguyreurguyrhtr well said sir.
,Chasieboy,2012-06-13T20:36Z,Where is the product key. I cannot find it.
,DarkTrololo,2012-06-14T10:13Z,ppl don't be so rude and write shit this doesn't work even if u move the loader into the program folder...
,khanBay,2012-06-22T05:21Z,"This software is awesome!!

,lil_boi99,2012-07-13T15:41Z,even after the loader it dosnt work :S
,kurdapyo777,2012-07-20T17:05Z,followed instructions but still stuck with 20 days trial period...  maybe you just have to use the autoloader everytime you open the program so that you'll always have 20 days trial
,whoolf,2012-07-22T10:25Z,Its cool 
,whoolf,2012-07-22T10:26Z,Its downloading with 1mb/second 
,NZBDM,2012-07-29T22:10Z,"Will see how i go, hence i dont even have fuckin antivirus lol"
,buckpoole,2012-08-19T23:54Z,"When i unpack the file, my loader folder is empty..."
,buckpoole,2012-08-20T00:41Z,"ok, i figured it out. McAfee was auto deleting the file, without even notifying me. So i turned off real time scanning for 15 mins, re unrar-ed it, and copied it over."
,EXKALIBUR1970,2012-08-20T00:42Z,"Gracias por compartir software de calidad.
Seeding"
,SONNYSPAK,2012-08-20T21:25Z,"yes avg says its a virus, it's not. not one bit. it works flawlessly "
,specialiste,2012-08-21T03:28Z,"fast download, GREAT instructions -- worked perfectly! thanks"
,Alboy76,2012-08-29T15:34Z,"i just installed the program and it works perfectly, for the second time installation...i copied the crack files into daemon tools folder at the programs during the installation, and did the program succeded...thank you Webchella"
,clintbro1,2012-09-09T00:21Z,"This shit has a fucking trojan, beware."
,Leotqleo,2012-09-13T09:39Z,"Easy:

) Download torrent, unpack everything

2) Install Daemon Tools Pro with a TRIAL LICENSE

3) DO NOT start Daemon Tools.

4) Copy the Daemon Tools Loader to the folder where you installed it.

5) Run the loader

Good Luck"
,seVen-kun,2012-09-15T07:45Z,"yeah you could prob figure out how to make this instructionless pos work, or save the 6 mins and download another one... lifehack"
,pl4c3b0,2012-09-25T06:14Z,you have to be kidding me. this is double compressed for what purpose? cause the full extracted files come out to be a little less than the double compressed rar... plus its only fucking 17 megs. this is some crack you found on the internet and arent even giving credit to whom it actually belongs to. kids these days.
,zyanya,2012-09-25T10:48Z,"ok ppl for the ones of you that followed the steps and couldnt get it to work.....

1. extract
2.install program "" dont run it""
3.copy loader into daemon tools program folder
4.run loader ""as administrator""--important..i try it first without running as administrator and it didnt work
5. enjoy

p.s. i got this running on windows 8 even after i got a message saying there was a compatibility issue.. just ignore..the torrent is good 
thanks to the uploader"
