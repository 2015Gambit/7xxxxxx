6 Original Studio Albums
4 Remastered Studio Albums
1 Live Album
1 Compilation (rarities)

So, while it was my intent to cross post the original discography (5+ gigs, 17 albums), I had to recreate the torrent to include DHT to get TPB to accept it... so, I trimmed it down and removed the original releases in favor of the remasters and deleted US releases in favor of the JAPAN Releases. Its still very large (3.2) gigs and its going to take a while to get it distributed.  While I can't do anything about hit and runs, I can start posting to private trackers and I don't want to do that... so, please seed at least 1:1... 

Keep an eye out for a new album to be released early in 2012.

Due to the size of this torrent, it would be appreciated if you everyone could seed more than 1:1... thanks.

Pennywise is a Californian punk rock band from Hermosa Beach, California, formed in 1988. The name is derived from the monster, It, from the Stephen King novel of the same title.

Between their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005s The Fuse, Pennywise had released an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released nine full-length studio albums (the last being 2008s Reason to Believe), one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, About Time, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australias ARIA Charts. The band\'s mainstream success was signified by a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring and Sublime (unlike the last five bands, however, Pennywise refused to sign with a major label). By 2007, the band had independently sold over 3 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent punk acts of all time.

==========

Pennywises line-up, which remained constant from 1996 to 2009, consisted of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up until bassist Jason Thirsk committed suicide in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli TÃ©glÃ¡s. This new lineup has been working on a new album to be released in early 2012.
