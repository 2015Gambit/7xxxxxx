Ashampoo Photo Optimizer opens with a neatly assorted and enhanced looking interface with the chief features placed at the top panel and the left pane displaying the thumbnails of pictures stored in the program. Every image can be optimized and saved one by one and removes any dark elements from the image and makes it simpler to operate. Photos can be optimized with a single mouse click and appear to be much brighter and sharper in quality than before and have stronger contrasts as well. The direct comparison of before and after effect that is displayed on the image simply shows the strength of the optimization algorithm of the application and makes it a must have for all photography enthusiasts. The optimization effect can be undone at any time on the picture and processed on multiple image files at one time through a batch facility.
