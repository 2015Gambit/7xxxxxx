
The Ultimate History Lesson is presented as a five-hour interview session -memorializing Gatto's research, publications and life experiences- which forms an impeccable resource and reference library of the Underground History of American Education. Each hour focuses on examining the evolution of ideas which manifest today in the phenomenon of "public schooling". By dissecting the history and presenting you with the references, you're left at the end of each hour with a copious amount of information from which you can continue your own personal journey of discovery.
