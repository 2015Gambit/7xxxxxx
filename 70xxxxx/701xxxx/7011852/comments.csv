,tofi-75214,2012-02-07T19:33Z,"Thanx! Great recording, very raw, almost brutal. Can you tell me, please about the source. What's the name of the Bootleg, where and when was it recorded?"
,pmp317,2012-02-07T23:01Z,You're welcome but I'll admit his is rough but still very high fidelity and very listenable for a vinyl rip on a Philips CDR burner from an unknown private label release dating over a 1/4 of a century ago! My dad said he'd recognize the cover and has seen it online b4 but couldn't provide any further vital details other than it's extremely hard to find and rare! I'll do some digging and confirm with my old man and post it as soon as pin point the source of the bootleg's origin.

The chord progression of the first track is similiar to Vodoo Child, so maybe it's an early studio session for the Electric Ladyland album from 1968.
Being stone-cold sober I was completely blown away while listening to the tracks :-)
Once again, thank you for this precious little gem."
