Disc 1

I can't give you anything but love
Loverman
Back in your own backyard
Your mother's son-in-law
Miss Brown to you
On the sunny side of the street
I love my man "Billie's blues"
I wished on the moon
Twenty-four hours a day
What a little moonlight can do
No more
He's funny that way
Nice work if you can get it
My man "Mon homme"
Lover, come back to me
I must have that man
Easy living
All of me
You go to my head
Strange fruit

Disc 2

God bless the child
I'll get by
Them there eyes
Some other spring
These foolish things
Don't explain
Yesterdays
Any old time
I gotta right to sing the blues
My last affair
Moanin' low
That ole devil called love
I cried for you
The way you look tonight
Pennies from heaven
I cover the waterfront
A sailboat in the moonlight
Long gone blues
This year's kisses
Carelessly

Disc 3

They can't take that away from me
The man I love
Fine and mellow
The mood that I'm in
Mean to me
I can't get started
Ghost of yesterday
Swing brother swing
Did I remember?
I'll never be the same
I'm gonna lock my heart
No regrets
A fine romance
Who loves you?
I'll get by (alternate take)
Trav'lin light
Solitude
I've got my love to keep you warm
Good morning heartache
These 'n' that 'n' those
