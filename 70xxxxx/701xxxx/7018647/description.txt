To anyone reading this whether a life-long christian, a moderate believer or a truth seeker, Welcome!

This wonderful series (17 parts in total) is a thought provoking look at our Creator, his plans for us, how he feels about us and his plans for saving this dying race!

Based strictly on bible truth, This seminar unfolds piece by piece revealing the awe inspiring character of our heavenly Father.

I pray that some of you will download and enjoy this series and I hope it mends some of the distorted images of God that are unfortunately out there,
May God bless you and guide you into an amazing experience in your daily lives...
