Why did I receive this complaint?
Anti-piracy companies automatically monitor public bit-torrent trackers for US IP addresses that are involved in illegally sharing copyrighted material. These companies then send a DMCA complaint to the underlying ISP behind the IP address, and this ISP then forwards the complaint on to us. We are legally required to forward on the complaint to the suspected customer.
