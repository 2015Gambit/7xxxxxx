Jack Sadelstein (Adam Sandler) is a successful advertising executive in Los Angeles with a beautiful wife (Katie Holmes) and kids, who dreads one event each year: the Thanksgiving visit of his identical twin sister Jill (also Adam Sandler).

[b]### Notes ### [/b]
[color=yellow]First thx to BHRG for their  work to sync audio, of course thx to FYA for bring us the english line, thx guys....sourse is realy good for TS just first minute is blurred. Added a few filters, sharpened, doesn't look darker and work a little bit on the OOS part (was synchronized so how can the TS version, not well but well enough).....is much better to watch this version than the previous one.[/color]
