[V],psspss,2012-02-09T01:36Z,opps typo x352 not 252 pixels
[V],psspss,2012-02-09T02:22Z,"you will like this movie if like this stuff.. its a bit slow
and would of been better with more effects at the end

TAKE SHELTER"
[V],psspss,2012-02-09T02:34Z,"was a pretty good watch a little like THE COLONY series in places :)

since the quakes here we also have solar batteries and torches
and water tight containers with food and tins and water.. not as extreme
as these guys just enough to last a few weeks

but it was amazing when the house was made a mess no one had torches in their room except me and I had some solar torches scattered in the house in the pitch black
as power went out i could direct them to find one as I was jammed in the bedroom as door blocked.
now everyone in household has learned the hardway and have a torch in room and know where find others even if it ends up on floor in the debri"
,claytona57,2012-02-09T03:59Z,"I know I thanked you for this episode but this was not what was aired last night. This was released by TVTean on june 28th of 2011.

[V],psspss,2012-02-09T04:09Z,"This could be a re-air or old rip from July
not sure dont really understand the guides as
said Feb there? well first time ive seen it anyhow

perhaps this is the pilot for the series?
im sure someone will figure it out and perhaps
find more episodes?

[V],psspss,2012-02-09T04:21Z,"UPDATE: seems this is not the one from last night after all
but the pilot episode for the series.. all I could find though
perhaps a usa capper will leak the other somewhere for all
I cannt rename the title here since edit disabled to reflect the mistake

but air date should be 30-Jun-2011 for this one
and E00 not E01 since its not be made a series
its a pilot
now perhaps someone can upload or find the 2 new episodes then
rename to suit... BLAH"
[V],psspss,2012-02-09T04:34Z,"
UPDATE2 it is actually called E01.. according to tvrage E02
aired last night
http://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-30544/episodes/1065132867

so the name is right and order just not the air date of this one.
and its a pilot obviously.. i think its all clear now..
so those thinking it was E02 it clearly wasnt as I did call it E01
after all.. but alas many still havent since this episode as
only aware of it since E02 air-ed "
[V],psspss,2012-02-09T09:30Z,"by the way -1 is not valid or fair as its correctly named just the wrong date and the video quality
is very good"
,08141983,2012-02-09T16:14Z,So is anyone going to put up Episode 2? I'm kinda surprised it's taken this long. I've checked usenet as well and the only thing I can locate is Episode 1 from way back. 
,j0nnyboy,2012-02-12T22:55Z,"^ Regarding the drones over US airspace... you know those unmanned drones that kill people over in Afghanistan and Iraq? Well the US gov't is OKing those things to fly over our skies.

Look up the NDAA act. Obama signing a bill that essentially declares the US a battlezone and anyone can be detained without trial for an indefinite amount of time.

I'm not a big conspiracy guy, but I feel like something's in the air and the shit may hit the fan soon. Not tryin to be all doom and gloom people, but prepare for the unexpected. Buy guns."
[V],psspss,2012-02-15T10:37Z,"im going to rename mine starting at E00 not E01
so matches the other cappers and natgeo
listing and ignore tvrage

premiere can be S01E00

it will save the confusion on new episodes to come"
