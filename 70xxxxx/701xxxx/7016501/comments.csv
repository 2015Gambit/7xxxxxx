Yes, it's episode 1, but the uploader (xCrazy0328x) uploaded episodes 1 and 2 in a joint file (one video), so if you want to watch episode 2 you'll need to download that, and it would be easier to download that to watch one and two rather than spend double the time for one episode. I missed that when downloading this, and I wanted to make sure nobody else followed my folly."
