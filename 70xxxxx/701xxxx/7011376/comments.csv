,polarbearing,2012-02-06T04:46Z,"This one is the real deal - downloaded and tested.

The passworded file was posted by some asshole and has apparently been deleted."

,Marelazaez,2012-02-06T07:47Z,RARs!! A virus probably you will found.
,Swidea,2012-02-06T08:13Z,"There is nothing wrong with this torrent. Just extract the file and play it, everything works perfectly =)"
,ahorwood,2012-02-06T10:11Z,"Since this was uploaded by sceneline I assume that half of the comments below are posted by assholes who aren't smart enough to own a computer. 

Thanks guys. I love Top Gear, but cannot get it in France."
,Marelazaez,2012-02-06T12:46Z,"No virus found. I am posting this after  I mentioned a probabilty of virus presence becouese of RARs, wich is not a rare thing. This one is clean, I checked it with Kaspersky. "
,TPBrullz,2012-02-06T14:00Z,"lol, i'm loving all the morons that don't even know how to extract compressed files.... what the fuck are you doing here?

And like that wasn't stupid enough, you come here and whine about it not working lol"
,ysc100,2012-02-06T16:13Z,why i need to register a bloody junk mail site to get pw? stupid torrent
,questar,2012-02-06T17:33Z,"There's an explanation for the password required comments. What I downloaded was a single password protected 1.5GB RAR file. This is the first time I got one of those.

I checked here Sunday shortly after this episode of Top Gear finished airing and saw a torrent of this name. I started downloading briefly but then paused it. That torrent was NOT uploaded by sceneline but had this torrent's name. This morning I saw this torrent and downloaded the torrent file. Having the same name, the previous torrent restarted.

So the password-required RAR file scam apparently is about quickly uploading a fake torrent with a commonly formatted name and then either removing it when the real torrent is uploaded, or having the fake torrent get deleted.

So go easy on the outraged commentators. It really did happen."
,mothymandinga,2012-02-07T15:30Z,Works perfectly. Thankyou.
