im currently downloading.......does it work?"
,Brrr1955,2012-02-10T10:05Z,"No, afther instaling FSX is not able to start, i have to reinstall :( :( :("
,_SnakEye,2012-02-10T10:45Z,"You might have had a different Issue , not related to this Install.
but it works great for me and My FSX runs perfectly with this Addon."
,_SnakEye,2012-02-10T10:48Z,"BTW - You must read the PDF file that comes along with this addon. it is much more then ""Next"" ""I Agree"" Installation. there are some compatibility notice you need to address and a correct way/steps that needs to be done.
it is a Texture Addon which replaced your Default FSX textures with those Hi Res textures.
you probably did not follow the manual, that is why you broke your FSX."
,_SnakEye,2012-02-10T10:50Z,"""kmankm1"" - Yes it works great, just be sure to fallow the Manual (PDF) after you Install the product.
only after you read the Manual, you can go ahead and launch the Program to complete the Injection into FSX."
,Brrr1955,2012-02-10T14:19Z,"""GEX Africa and the Middle East users must
be on v1.10 to install the options from this product""

Yes, I didn't read manual, and I have only v1.0, so that maybe problem why I crash FSX. I'll try later afther instaling v1.10 patch."
