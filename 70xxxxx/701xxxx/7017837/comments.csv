,BigZ7337,2012-02-09T03:20Z,"Hm,  when I open the torrent it isn't showing any files. Does anyone actually see the files from this download when Bittorrent opens the torrent? The only problem I could possibly think of on my end is that Bittorrent just updated."
,MeGa_T,2012-02-09T05:10Z,"Yeah it didn't show the files in bittorrent on mine either, but when I went into the folder on my computer all the files were there and working. Yay!
will seed for a while =]"
,3amJoker,2012-02-09T05:56Z,Yeah that might have been a stuff up on my part setting up the torrent. I wanted to get it up ASAP for you guys so I just skimmed the tutorial on uploading torrents. Will study more before next one. Enjoy!
,BigZ7337,2012-02-09T08:16Z,"Ok, the download worked, and apparently now every torrent on pirate bay is doing this. The files are there once it's done, so I'm not sure what's going on. Torrents from Demonoid are working fine, I just tested one. 

Thanks for the upload! :)"
