The 1st season b&w episodes are supposed to be more grim and serious than the later episodes, and I'm looking forward to seeing that.  Also, thanks for making these big avi files.  It's nice to see someone breaking the chains of 350 MB for one hour TV shows.
Don't pay attention to cvvv.  He's a complete fucking asshole.  He's such an asshole, that I actually remember his name from bitching about other torrents here on TPB.  Click on his user name and see how many torrents he's uploaded on TPB. (hint: it's less than one)"
