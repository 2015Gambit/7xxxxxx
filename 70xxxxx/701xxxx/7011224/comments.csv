,F0rgiven,2012-02-05T20:20Z,"The audio is low and kind of bad, but it is bearable. Audio is in ENGLISH, not a Russian upload. Video is decent, just what you would expect from a camera. This is the only working english version of the movie up so far. Have fun downloading, and SEED."

,abai92,2012-02-06T02:35Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! Yes, it is real but audio is fucking horrible. It's literally 5-10 seconds out of sync.
Wait for a better torrent, this is fucking horse shit."
,MisticBane,2012-02-06T07:29Z,"I can see giving constructive criticism for uploaded torrent - hey, that's what the comment section is for. But, at least it is a watchable copy for those that simply can't wait to get a ""good or near perfect"" quality. However, being a dick about it doesn't make it any better. 

I will admit - yes, the audio is out of sync; however, it can easilly be fixed by someone with enough brains to read above comments like the one posted by kazmandu above.

Does someone need to review ""Hooked on phonics"" to understand that much? I will give you a simple link... and don't worry, it IS in audio format. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4904566/VA-General_Sounds_PRESENTS_Hooked_On_Phonics-WEB-2009-W33d_INT"
,xMajesticMeteorx,2012-02-06T13:01Z,"It's real and good enough for my poor ass.

Sure the eventual DVDrip will be the one you want to store in your external harddrive if you're in to that. But this is good enough."
,Swapp,2012-02-06T19:51Z,"Its a CAM version of a movie filmed of Found footage( CAM)... Camseption

How good could that be?"
