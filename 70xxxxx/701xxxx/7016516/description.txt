The gripping and captivating story of a young man who is trained by a powerful being for a special purpose and the first of a three-book series, â€˜Truth- Godspeedâ€™ carries readers on a journey that exposes the root of what ought to drive heroism- love, loyalty, pure motive, power, responsibility and understanding of human nature. Though set in the future, when humans and humanoids have spread beyond earth and populate the vast universe, and when travel through the cosmos is as common as travelling to cities within a country, the book inspires reflection on life as we know it and encourages introspection on human nature, good and bad. It even moves readers to question their very reason for existence. It is a must read. Gareth Mayersâ€™ debut book is a masterpiece of a plot and provides foregleams of a promising writing career.
