,spidey111,2012-02-08T18:56Z,"Hey YIFY,you have almost all sequels its great but you have missed ROCKY series so please complete it n your RAMBO collection wasn't good please RE-UPLOAD it each of 700mb... Please reply soon will be waiting for your reply :)"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-08T22:17Z,"@Rustyronny. No. The grass is not green elsewhere. YIFY is magic, the best there is. I've tried, earlier, some other guys in vain, nowadays i know better and i only wait for YIFY uploads and also meanwhile download older torrents from him (all well seeded!). Just click on his name above or visit his blog and start downloading awesome movies from THE BEST YIFY !"
,Who-He-iZ,2012-02-08T22:19Z,"... and many thx to you YIFY for this movie !
V:10 and A:10"
,theniner,2012-02-09T08:40Z,"quality good with one exception ""Drive"".
but this can be one of the SLOWEST for downloading, wish that i knew why, since there are numerous seeds posted. have not had this problem with others."
,theniner,2012-02-10T09:27Z,"the volume as in the the movie ""Drive"" and this ""2012"" is NOT GOOD! 
THIS WILL BE MY LAST MOVIE DOWNLOAD.
don't know how others have GOOD VOLUME and acceptable VIDEO and this sight has GOOD VIDEO but TERRIBLE AUDIO, ie. on computer VLC, WMP, SEAGATE HOME THEATER... thanks but no thanks"
,ipodmonesta,2012-03-11T09:25Z,awesome!! I LOVE U YIFY :DD
