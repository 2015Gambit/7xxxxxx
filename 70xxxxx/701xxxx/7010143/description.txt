SYNOPSIS: The first feature film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture, Wings tells the story of two men (Buddy Rogers and Richard Arlen) in love with the same woman (Clara Bow). Their rivalry grows into a wary friendship once they become fellow fighter pilots in World War I. Director William A. Wellman had the full cooperation of the U.S. War Department, which allowed him to film spectacular aerial dogfight scenes. Gary Cooper appears as a veteran pilot.
