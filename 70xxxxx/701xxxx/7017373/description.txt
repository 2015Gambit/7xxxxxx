Vincent likes his girlfriend. Katherineâ€™s pretty, smart, and successful. Trouble is, sheâ€™s starting to talk about long-term commitment, something Vincentâ€™s spent his entire life avoiding. Since romantic complications are the last thing he wants to deal with, Vincent meets his friends for their regular night of drinks. Little does he know that heâ€™s about to be blindsided by a beautiful, seductive, irresistible freight train named Catherine. Suddenly, heâ€™s hung over in bed next to the most beautiful woman heâ€™s ever seen, unsure about the previous nightâ€™s events. Was it just making out, he wonders, or did something more serious happen between them? Should he tell Katherine? Will he ever see Catherine again? Vincentâ€™s about to find that a stumble on the staircase of love can turn into a horrific, fatal plummetâ€¦

Features

    The Horrors of Loveâ€“Vincentâ€™s waking fears, doubts, pressures, and growing guilt about commitment and fidelity now gleefully follow him into his dreams, manifesting as horribly disfigured monsters and a ticking clock.
    Between a Rock and a Soft Placeâ€“The player must navigate Vincent through heavy moral decisions. As in real life, hardly anything is black and white. What is the value of honesty? What is the right thing to do? Either way, someoneâ€™s going to get hurt. Worse yet, someone could die.
    The Nightmare of Your Dreamsâ€“With oversight from acclaimed producer Katsura Hashino, famed character artist Shigenori Soejima and master composer Shoji Meguro create sights and sounds unlike anything else. As unforgettable and original as the gameâ€™s narrative, Catherineâ€™s visual direction and musical score define and perfectly complement Vincentâ€™s terrifying ascent into the dizzying perils of love.
    Escape With or From a Friendâ€“Local competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes, in addition to leaderboards, ensure that the many thrills and horrors of racing through twisted stages can be enjoyed by more than one player and add hours of extra gameplay to the overall experience.
