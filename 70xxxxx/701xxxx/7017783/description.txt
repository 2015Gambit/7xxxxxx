To live in a pristine land unchanged by man...
to roam a wilderness through which few other humans have passed...
to choose an idyllic site, cut trees and build a log cabin...
to be a self-sufficient craftsman, making what is needed from materials available...
to be not at odds with the world, but content with one's own thoughts and company...
Thousands have had such dreams, but Dick Proenneke lived them. He found a place, built 
a cabin, and stayed to become part of the country. These videos are simple accounts of 
the day-to-day explorations and activities he carried out aloneand the constant chain of 
nature's events that kept him company.


I spent ages downloading then converting all these from VOBs etc so that you can enjoy the entire collection at a click!
