All of the files played fine for me. But VLC complained about 'Alone in the Wilderness - Part 1 (2003).avi', and tried to repair. It couldnt, but the video played fine anyway."

I'm having issues playing all from PS3 and PC using MPC but iPad seems to like them all just fine, without any seeking/pausing options though.  "
,Drreez,2012-04-12T00:33Z,@tweedlash Part 2 does not open in windows Media Player but it opens just fine in VLC Player which is a freeware and is one of the most recommended and best video players available.
