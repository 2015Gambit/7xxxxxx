,zonderdollen,2012-02-11T17:44Z,"Dear Auge,

Big thanks for all these great classics.
But please do not seed all these 20 or so at once.
Be so kind and take care of seeding, let's say, the first five first and so on.
First in, first out system...  ;-)

Regards!"
[T],Auge,2012-02-11T20:21Z,"Iâ€™m a little confused here.
My bit torrent says that I have uploaded at least 4.24GB of the least uploaded file and 8.03 of the most uploaded file. It also says that there are at least 0(3) seeders. I have read that means that I am connected to 0 seeders but that there are at least 3 seeders out there. But it seems that I am the only seeder no matter how many are in the parentheses.
I would like to add a file a day.
When is there enough other seeders so that I can move on to other movies?"
