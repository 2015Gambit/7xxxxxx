dvd-/+ records and played in a dvd player, am I right ? 

Thanks for upload anyway! :-()"
,dumpo,2012-02-06T11:18Z,"why every single episode in a single ISO?

this is no typical DVD-structure

any more informations? For an untouched DVD9 (10 episodes รก 1 hour + DVD extras) it seems to bee to small (and the ISO packing prevent a preview)"
,rundajzl,2012-02-06T11:37Z,great croatian subs put som more movies......thanks excelent
,markien,2012-02-06T17:57Z,"Downloaded the First Episode. I always run ISO through DVD SHRINK, then I burn the VTS as a dvd movie. This file did not work in 
Dvd Shrink. Maybe it will burn as ISO, never done that."
,docgil,2012-02-10T09:20Z,"You can easily burn an iso on a dvd ( with nero ) but, here, you need 10 dvds for this first season !!!
Dont understand why you did that when the original boxset contains only 5 dvds ??!!!"
