NOTES:

KK sources ...video is thanks to lum1x for sharing bro  and audio MiSTERE 
video was ok ...but whacked colours and colours also seem to change slightly throughout ..also lacked contrast,some interlace
issues on some frames here and there.....
Audio was nice but peak levels were hitting alots of highs and also had some 
noise too it.
Video we resized,tweak rgb colours added contrast and some sharpness ....also 
opted to deinterlace blend to smooth it a touch more.
Audio totally remastered changing all the levels and used a hiss removal ....check original to cleaned in adobe or goldwave and see
the difference in the audio patterns 
Overall not too bad but still nothing special ...so 6.5 all round IMHO.
