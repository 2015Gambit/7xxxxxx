,johnsparrow,2012-06-25T13:20Z,in the setup at 87.7 a message appear with wierd language and whenever i keep pressing on close or ok i get the message again how do i fix it?pls answer me
,crossebby,2012-06-26T08:37Z,"johnsparrow 
dsanjay 

U need to mount First image with Alcohol software(download and install it) or daemon tools(I prefer alcohol), then mount the first image in Alcohol then it will show ""setup"" click it and start installation , after reaching about 90% it will show a message with weird language, what U have to do is "" remove the first image or delete the image then mount the second image"" in the Alcohol then press ""OK"" on the message box in the game installation. Thats it will install the rest.

This is clean and with out any glitches I am already half way through. Gud luck."
,crossebby,2012-07-02T07:20Z,"damn it  freezing every 7 minutes or so, i  found half of the map and the freezing started. Stupid games most of the recent games are shit. And there is no proper fixes or patches from developers, I trying since 3 days to solve no luck will delete this soon.  Its not the rip its the game itself.

Thanks alchemist Ur pretty good ripper. "
