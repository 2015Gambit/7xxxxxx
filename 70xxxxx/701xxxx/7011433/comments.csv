These articles should be useful for a summary of what the economics profession believe generally about the necessity and efficiency of government vs. the market.

I selected these papers by going through the last fifteen years of what had been published in the three journals mentioned below. The later journals are the dominant journals that are supposed to give a summary perspective on the views of certain strands of economists and economists views in general. The first journal is a newcomer, and is somewhat contrarian.

There are also two articles on the effects of economic freedom on economic growth. These articles were chosen since they are the two latest and largest surveys in this field. One of them is however not in this torrent, some problem with the file. The last link is to that article.
