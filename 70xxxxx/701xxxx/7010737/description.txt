Beautiful oversize, coffee table style book "Kulinarya's team of six chefs, all of whom have made their own mark on Filipino cuisine, had many lively arguments to distill the core principles of Filipino Cooking from the huge diversity of regional and individual practices. The result: a guidebook that brings greater understanding of our cuisine and inspires more careful attention to good cooking practices. The graceful and precise photography of Neal Oshima combines with the clean, practical styling of Claude Tayag to produce a sumptuous vision of Filipino cuisine." --Michaela Fenix "Finally, a cookbook that presents Filipino cuisine for a 21st century global audience."
