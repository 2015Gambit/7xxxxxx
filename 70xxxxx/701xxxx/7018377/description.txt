Skintight is one of the more emotionally intense of the late golden age films, and does a fine job of combining sex with a sinister, edgy kind of Cronenberg mentality. Paul Thomas is the head of a sex therapy institute, and is *****ing up. He is obsessed with therapist Annette Haven, and in a series of recurring fantasies, he dreams of Miss Haven, dressed in Skintight black leather, in a nightmare setting of shadowy sexual activity. Lisa Deleuw also inhabits this fantasy realm. Thomas is already in a bitter confused state because of unusual sexual problems with his wife, and when Haven (also the victim of Thomasâ€™ recurring obscene phone calls) leaves to get married, Thomas snaps completely. The theme of someone going mad is a frequent one in adult films because it lends itself to frequent imaginary or hallucinatory passages, thus allowing a lot of sex scenes. This particular portrayal is effective because Paul Thomas isn't a bad actor â€“ he played Peter in the 1973 Norman Jewison JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR, which is a pretty good credit for a porn actor's resume!
