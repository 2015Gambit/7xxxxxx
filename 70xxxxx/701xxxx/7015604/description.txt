Notes:

FIRST OF ALL A MESSAGE TO THE LEAKER....
"GO AND SUCK YOUR SELF YOU TINY NOOB.." IF YOU ARE READING THIS...NO NEED TO LEAK THIS ON A SITE WHICH I WILL NOT MENTION...

THIS IS HERE WAY WAY EARLY BECAUSE IT WAS LEAKED.....NOT HAPPY AT ALL... PROBABLY THE LAST CAM I DO FOR A WHILE...

READNFO well this is why>>>

the source was stretched so i fixed this.. and opted to set the resolution to 720x320 looks much nicer!!
on to the video . it was very dark so added bit of brightness and sauturation and other filters to it to make it look nice!
the audio is given by a special friend of mine .. and it was very noisy!!.. so ran a few noise filters on it, now it sounds nearly perfect just the occasional laughter from the cinema and the occasional loud hiss at a few places which only lasts for 2-3 secs! 
will do a v2 once i get new and better audio.. until then here it is..with all that been said bottom line not bad for a first cam.. so like i always say... take it or leave it!

enjoy ;
