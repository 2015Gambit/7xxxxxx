,necyomantia,2012-02-17T16:23Z,"To Play with Nvidia 3D vision rig, first u need to set up your 120hz monitor and 3D IR emitter and glasses properly from the driver menu, then download the 3D vision Video Player from nvidia website(free full version), instal a codec pack like k-lite, open the video file, select L-R Half-SBS Left image First and 16:9 aspect, youre ready to go..."

however i cannot put this file onto my USB flash drive,or 500GB external hard drive,it's the first 3D mkv file iv'e ever downloaded,this is what it says:

'The item “Transformer 3 Dark Of The Moon 3D.mkv” can’t be copied because it is too large for the volume's format'

i'd really appreciate any help i could get guys,iv'e tried googling with no avail,and if possible some detailed information would be greatly appreciated.thanks in advance! "

Try reformatting the drive to NTFS, make sure to save any data on your USB drive as it will erase everything. To do so go to COMPUTER, RIGHT CLICK your thumb drive and CLICK FORMAT, under file system switch it from Fat32 to NTFS, check the quick format box, then CLICK FORMAT. It should work then."

It works good on my Samsung 55 inch 8000 series so it should work good on yours also. Sometimes with these you have to do a little bit of tinkering around with the 3D settings. I cheat and hook up my computer and use stereoscopic player for SBS format and then click 2D to 3D on the TV and it looks great. Haven't downloaded in a long time because these downloads take forever so I use a program to convert my 2D files into high resolution 3D myself which usually only takes about 6-8 hours depending on length but looks just as good as these once you figure out what to do. I can use another one to do faster conversion but the lower resolution makes it look terrible"

,Mostafa_Refaie,2012-04-02T11:25Z,"@booger36901 this is a 3D Side by Side movie. when you play it on 3d Tv whether by streaming or connecting you laptop to tv via HDMI cable, you choose SBS 3d and your tv will merge the 2 parts into 1 in 3d"

,oki111,2012-05-22T03:43Z,"Hi guys! Im new at this 3D thing, and i just need to know how do i play these 3D torrents on my 3D TV. When i try to play the files i get 4 screens on the TV. How do you guys play these torrents? Thanks for all answers!"
,Mostafa_Refaie,2012-06-27T01:05Z,"FOR ALL 3D BEGINNERS!!!

1- Simply you connect your PC/Laptop via HDMI to a 3D Ready tv weather its samsung or anything else, then play the movie with ANY video player that supports MKV (the video format).

2- a split screen will appear, all you have to do is press 3D on your tv remote and choose side by side, the tv will merge this images to one so you watch it with active shutter 3d or passive 3d glasses.
------------------2nd way-------------------------

1-If your tv can play MKV files, simply copy the movie to an HDD (usb won't work) and continue to step 2

------------------3rd way--------------------------

1- If you have PS3, just buy a strong wireless router (ex. Asus Rt-N56U, Asus RT-N66U or link sys hd routers)

2-Download ps3 media server, choose files you want to stream and HOLA! (I don't recommend this one as its expensive)

pros: stream media wirelessly

,PympJuce2,2012-09-25T23:34Z,"Here's what I do. I have Sony Playstation 3D LED Display. I downloaded Stereoscopic Player from this site. I download this(or other)3D movie. Drag n drop movie into Stereoscopic Player. If autodetect doesnt work, then go to View, and scroll down to Side by Side. I then hit the 3D button on my Sony Display to side by side, and works every time! Hope that helps."
