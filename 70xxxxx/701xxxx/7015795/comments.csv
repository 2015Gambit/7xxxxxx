(TR/Crypt.xpack.gen, not a keygen warning but a trojan.)

There is a crack without trojs:

,peka95,2012-02-16T22:13Z,does this game has a virus or not.
,exionn11,2012-02-17T08:26Z,"it's impossible to play the game like this, the mouse cursor is always loading in the middle, even tho im using the gamepad the mouse ruins my aim. the guy rolls by himself, and if i put the mouse in the corner the guy runs to it. how do i fix this shi**?"
,sk8ter88,2012-02-17T17:34Z,"hey Extremezone you Rock , but is there a fix for the cursor ?????? its keeps spining !!! cheers "

that did not work for me......"
,Username10201,2012-02-19T11:57Z,"I am also unable to get saving working properly. I should be getting auto save notifications after doing collectables and such but do not. I have changed the compatibility settings for the exe and ran as administrator but that had no effect. I've tried playing both with and without my av's and firewalls up.

I've had the installation files put on the desktop, program files and (x86) on my windows 7 machine. There were no issues during installation and the game runs extremely smoothly aside from not saving. 

Where the save files should be located remains blank no matter what I do. I have spent a few hours trying to solve this but I'm having no luck.

Any suggestions?"
,an7779,2012-02-22T01:01Z,"thanks for the upload extremezone, like others said mouse cursor keeps spinning all the time. This game do save, I finished normal difficulty & now playing the hard mode, this game only saves once u finish the whole episode & beat the boss at the end of every episode, no saving in the middle, it's kinda frustrating but challenging. One question to ask .. does this game work for online play, when I went to play survival mode it asks for internet connection to connect to a certain server & there I stopped, any ideas? thanks again EZ, ur the best"
,TSwan,2012-02-22T06:05Z,"You guys are all fucking noobs! If you don't know how to download shit then stop whatever you're doing! No fucking shit its gonna say trojan Antivirus detects software that alters system files and that uses different code, the crack to any program is the code its the same file but the security code is removed so you and I can play hassle-less, and so we don't need any dvd shit to play it. So stop your god damn whinning and be happy with it, other wise GET THE FUCK OUT! Computer programers like I that spend hours cracking software and files for you dumb asses to abuse and claim a virus isn't fair get a grip its not a damn virus, look at how many seeds and peers it has there should be your first clue and second it has no God Damn negative Quality rates. So get over it go buy the real deal! "
,exionn11,2012-02-22T16:01Z,how do i fix this god damn cursor problem?!!?

,HARBETH,2012-03-18T16:54Z,"All ok.
Big thx Master."
,zeca.pt,2012-04-11T03:13Z,"Hi everyone!

About the saving game problem in Shank2, i did this:

(win7)
1- create another user account with only english carachters (i named the account simply ""A"")
2- install the game in that account (on desktop or anywhere)
3- play ! (play a bit survivor (faster), and see if the medals progress are saved after reentering the game)



i had the saving problem in other games (Battlefield BC2), i found this trick in some forum, i tried and it works

now it saves the progress, yay!

cheers"
