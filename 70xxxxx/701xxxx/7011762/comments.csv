I read those and I took the time to read the published criticisms. Mostly, the criticisms were small minded nick picking. Example - many people were very upset at the idea of the human gene being selfish, therefore there was a call for him to change the title of his book! If they had actually read his book, (most did not but still published critiques) they would have realized the title was perfect and correct."
