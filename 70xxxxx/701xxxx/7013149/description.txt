I searched the torrent and I couldn't find it, so I decided to seed the one I downloaded from a direct download website.

The available formats are:
 - epub
 - mobi
 - pdf

Also, if you want to buy the book you can do it on Amazon 
http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-But-Mainly-Death-Games/dp/0615574092
The Kindle edition is actually 3 dollars.

But if you really can't or don't want to buy it for whatever reason, or you just want the book free of DRM, then there will always be an available free copy, no one will stop you from getting something that is essentially free to copy.

Enjoy! ^^
