SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Zac Efron was originally cast as Ren, but he pulled out in March 2009. 

Julianne Hough beat out several favorites including Hayden Panettiere, Miley Cyrus and Amanda Bynes for the part of Ariel. 

Kevin Bacon was given the script, but could not find a role he was willing to play. One particular role originally written for him was Ren's deadbeat father. However, he gave Craig Brewer his blessing. 

Unlike the original, Kenny Wormald performed most of his own dance moves due to his dancing background. 

The film is dedicated to the original 'Footloose' (1984) director, Herbert Ross. Not only in the end credits, but the cop who pulls over Ren has "H. Ross" on his name tag. He is credited as Officer Herb. 

Although it is pretty rare, there have been individual towns or counties in the U.S. that have forbidden public dancing by law. For instance, in 1980, People Magazine ran a story about students at Elmore City High School in Elmore City, Oklahoma, who had to lobby the town's and school's officials for permission to have a prom. They were successful, and their prom was the first legal public dance in Elmore City since the town's 1861 founding. The plot of both this movie and its source, 1984's Footloose, were loosely based on Elmore City's story. 

Craig Brewer wanted to be a filmmaker after seeing the original Footloose. He loved the movie so much he recorded the audio and listened to it while walking.

Craig Brewer:  His boots are seen dancing in the opening credits when the words "A Craig Brewer Film" appears.
