Always an artist on his own journey O'LionÃ¡ird signed to Real World label in the mid 1990â€™s making many ground breaking recordings with the multi million selling and Grammy-nominated Afro Celt Sound System. Solo albums Seven Steps to Mercy (1997, produced by Michael Brook) and Invisible Fields (2005) brought widespread acclaim confirming Oâ€™LionÃ¡ird as one of contemporary musicâ€™s most ambitious singers and recording artists.
O'LionÃ¡ird has always been a collaborator and an artist seeking new fields of engagement. From his collaborations with Peter Gabriel on Ovo, this has taken an increasingly classical form. His song-cycle with Gavin Bryars, Anail De (The Breath of God) reflects a deep artistic collaboration and friendship with the composer. Similarly he has worked extensively with acclaimed Irish composer Donnacha Dennehy and his group The Crash Ensemble. On â€˜Foxlightâ€™, his third solo album, Iarla has created a rich and mature work as producer Leo Abrahams returns Oâ€™LionÃ¡irdâ€™s remarkable voice to the heart of the music. 

In an interview for Society of Sound Iarla talks about the making of this album: 

â€œLeo Abraham is the key song-writing collaborator. His guitar playing is lyrical and beautiful and restrained but at the same time quite adventurous â€“ from a sonic point of view heâ€™s ahead of the curve. When youâ€™re making a record such as this youâ€™re concerned about songs â€“ thatâ€™s the form and shape. But there are other things as well â€“ Iâ€™m often liable to start writing based on sound and texture â€“ a voyage into sound as much as into songs. My work with Leo is another indicator of that â€“ the pure experience of listening to sound, arranging sounds to create sometimes-unexpected effects and to generate response and emotion. Some tracks on this record are much more about the sound field â€“ particularly the song â€˜Stayâ€™ â€“ a song about my father and me as a very young boy. Jon Hopkinsâ€™s contribution is the backbone, the skeleton â€“ itâ€™s as much about the sequence of the sonic events as anything else."

"The lyrical content of the song is condensed â€“ itâ€™s collapsed into one world almost â€“ the word â€˜stayâ€™. Not a hell of a lot of word to be given the duty of carrying the whole message! But that then puts you into a position where youâ€™re creating something that is so dependent upon every next droplet of music - the arrangement of microscopic tonal events that somehow reach your heart. I always look forward to mixing â€“ we have been working in London and I couldnâ€™t wait to get into the studio at Real World. What we are trying to do is the iteration, the final burnishing. Thereâ€™s a sort of dark magic to mixing â€“ foreground shifts and its all very subjective but at the same time you know when its right and if youâ€™re lucky you know when thereâ€™s enough done.â€

Producer and guitarist Leo Abrahams discusses the recording process: 

â€œI had an idea about how I wanted to frame Iarlaâ€™s voice; quite different to the way it had been done before. One of the things in art that I am really interested in is ambiguity and for me there was a lot of ambiguity in working with Iarla because I didnâ€™t understand what he was singing about! But nevertheless he is capable of communicating so much without using text that the majority of his listeners can understandâ€¦but itâ€™s a thing that can be obscured by too much production or too many mysterious sounds. 

I have a small recording studio in East London with a little live room and a little control room. Although itâ€™s a digital studio it has lots of nice analogue warm-sounding equipment in it. But the room doesnâ€™t have a huge amount of character â€“ it doesnâ€™t sound echoy like a church or exciting like a stone garageâ€¦itâ€™s quite dead. So that gave us a lot of control of what spaces we wanted to place the sounds in â€“ we wanted the strings to sound like theyâ€™re in a church but weâ€™d like the vocal to sound like its right next to your ear. Itâ€™s a very intimate sounding album that weâ€™ve come out with. Rather than have a lot of things covered in reverb, there are a lot things that are very dry and maybe one thing that sounds distant to give it more space. 

What I like in records is contrast. I like some sounds that are very â€˜expensiveâ€™ or â€˜pureâ€™ sounding and other sounds that are tiny or sort of â€˜wrongâ€™. So a lot of the piano is recorded with contact microphones that cost Â£ 5 each and then the vocal with an Â£ 8 000 microphone! Somehow that gives a distance between all the other elements that I think exaggerates their differences and makes everything sound deeper. 

One of the thing Iâ€™ve been exploring as a guitar player for a long time is creating â€˜soundscapesâ€™ â€“ basically ambient music using analogue sources. Even with analogue synthesisers youâ€™re triggering something â€“ pressing down a plastic key and triggering some kind of circuit event. If you are controlling very complicated sounds with a guitar string I find you can get a sort of expressiveness or a fault within that which balances our the â€˜coldnessâ€™ of the digital part. So most of the ambient sounds on the record have a very analogue and physical source - whether thatâ€™s Jon Hopkinâ€™s contributions with piano or Leafcutter John using accordions or glockenspiels or me using guitars.â€
