,ProphetZarquon,2012-02-08T01:47Z,"Again , THIS IS NOT A 720P RELEASE

Even in the description, it says 1280x544.  The quality is GREAT but I really object to people taggint their torrents as 720p when they're clearly not.

Excellent quality, YIFY always posts very high quality rips.  But don't expect 720p from this 700mb file, because that's just not practical."
,ProphetZarquon,2012-02-08T01:48Z,"NOT 720p

Great quality, but it's simply not a 720p file.
The description even says 1280x544 so PLEASE quit tagging stuff as 720P when it obviously isn't (especially at 700mb)!"
[V],IndexTrance,2012-02-08T08:10Z,"'ProphetZarquon'

If you don't know what 720p resolution stands for than don't comment on things you don't know .. 

It is 720p and the resolution is set for the Aspect Ratio to be correct when playning this movie ..

So you mean RG like WiKi, AMiABLE, TWiSTED, ViSION, REFiNED, SPARKS, CHD and so on are wrong and you correct .. Think again!  "
,Dig1taL,2012-02-09T01:50Z,"Great quality as always, YIFY :D

The film, however, is nothing special (IMO)"
,firestartergmh,2012-02-10T03:36Z,Thanks a lot 4 da upload :)
,monkey16,2012-03-03T02:14Z,"@ProphetZarquon

You unlettered, ignorant, ungrateful buffoon.. find out what 720p means for yourself before whining here."
,spifkitten99,2012-03-18T23:19Z,"What is the point of 720p, but only 700 megs? You get nothing out of it being 720p then. Ridiculous."
