The Brain Our Universe Within: Perception
Recently it has become possible to undertake what had previously been thought impossible - charting the activities of the mind, such as memory and thought. Join Dr. David Suzuki as he investigates evidence that our minds - thoughts, feelings, spirituality and creativity - are merely complicated networks of biochemical reactions. Imagine the dramatic social implications this theory could have on the world today.. Perception: Although we all start with the same basic neuronal architecture, our life experiences physically change our mental make-up - and the way we perceive information from our senses. Explore each of the five senses - following the pathway from the sensory neurons, through the thalamus, to the cortex - and learn what happens when you get your sensory wires crossed.
