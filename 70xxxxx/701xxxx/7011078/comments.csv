,FRivera,2012-02-06T11:18Z,"Yeah, its him in the 1998 version too, I just thought maybe they released an updated version (happens sometimes)."
,fillinthisspace,2012-02-10T00:12Z,"This is definitely from the 1994 series. If you've downloaded the old torrent:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5809443/The_brain__our_universe_within_-_discovery_
then this seems to be the ""missing"" episode.

As best as I can tell the order should be:
1. Evolution
2. Perception
3. Memory
4. The Miraculous Mind
5. Matter Over Mind

Unfortunately though this torrent seems to have issues. The quality is fine but the aspect ratio hasn't been set correctly so it doesn't display as 4:3 as it should. It also appears not to have been de-interlaced.

The aspect ratio can be fixed by re-saving the MKV using MKVMergeGUI, which is part of MKVToolNix.
