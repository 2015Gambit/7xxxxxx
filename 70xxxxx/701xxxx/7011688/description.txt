Raymond Victor Franz was a member of the Governing Body of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses from 20 October 1971 until 22 May 1980, and served at the organization's world headquarters for fifteen years, from 1965 until 1980. The books Crisis of Conscience and In Search of Christian Freedom are his two primary written works. The first, Crisis of Conscience gives an account of his history in the organization and how he came to a crossroads decision that led to his leaving the headquarters and eventual expulsion from the Watch Tower Society. The second work, In Search Of Christian Freedom, delves into the anatomy and development of their doctrine and the exegesis of their divine authority claims and means of exercising subtle, but undeniable control among their membership. His writing is candid, but free from bitter vindictiveness or anger as is all too commonly found in ex-Jehovahâ€™s Witness literature. His former position gives one a rare and unique glimpse into the inner authority circle of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses.
