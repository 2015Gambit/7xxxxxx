Sunday, 05 February 2012


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On the Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the latest developments in the impending attack on Iran and the distinct possibility of false flag provocations in America, Israel and other countries that are helping them ready an unprovoked attack. Iran has promised to respond to countries participating in the covert and soon overt war against them. 

Alex also talks about the TSA's "wiener police" as the aviation Gestapo enlist thousands of fast food sellers and other vendors to spot terrorists under the "First Observer" program during today's Super Bowl event in Indianapolis.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
