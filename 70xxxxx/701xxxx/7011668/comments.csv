,Kiotori,2012-05-25T04:58Z,I Love the Quality but whenever I play it I get what sounds Like English and Japanese at the same time. Any Help?
,LaiTEAM,2012-08-05T04:29Z,"The subs file included with this torrent is a big piece of sh*t:

Examples:
SUBS: REDLINE's still popular amongst the public.
AUDIO: Redline is more popular than ever...

SUBS: You st*nk!
AUDIO: You totally s*ck!

...and so on

On the other side, video an audio quality are great."
,shpongles,2012-09-15T19:53Z,"LaiTEAM: because the subs are meant for Japanese audio.

This torrent uses the original translations instead of the dubbed translations.
