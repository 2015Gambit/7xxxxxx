NOOKAâ„¢ presents a new way to look at time. Time is the most ubiquitous thing we experience. NOOKA presents a graphical representation of time that transcends the linguistics and math that make telling time difficult for a child to learn â€“ creating a truly intuitive experience to tell time, set alarms, and visualise world-time/timezones.
