"Kevin Baldwin, better known by his stage name as Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind, is an American hip hop producer, DJ, and member of the underground hip hop group Jedi Mind Tricks. His production is often the most acclaimed aspect of the group's work. At times sampling upwards of 50 sounds for tracks, Stoupe is often considered one of the most complex, intricate and dedicated producers in hip hop. Stoupe has worked with only a limited number of artists outside of Jedi Mind Tricks, including 7L & Esoteric, Canibus, Virtuoso and Guru of Gang Starr. Stoupe's first solo album, 'Decalogue' was released in 2009 on Babygrande records. It featured a mixture of underground and popular rappers (for instance M.O.P.) performing over Stoupe's productions. In June 2010 A Bright Cold Day was released on Enemy Soil. The album was a collaborative project between Stoupe and long-time associate Liz Fullerton, who together recorded under the name Dutch. Fullerton had previously contributed vocals to Jedi Mind Tricks' songs Death Messiah and Razorblade Salvation. Stoupe resides in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
