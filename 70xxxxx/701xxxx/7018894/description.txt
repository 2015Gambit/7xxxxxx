Ok guys, I think I got it this time. Found it buried at rutracker, but I am pretty sure this is another PCC release. I am pretty sure it works as expected. There is a little flutter with the rudders and the airbrake does not visibly deploy, but it appears to slow the aircraft. All the displays work and are clickable and the HUD works. If you guys find it doesn't work, I will ask to have this torrent killed, if it does, I wil kill my other Superbug torrent. I know you will let me know.

Use the .bat file to install, then copy the ACM folder into the VRS_FA-18E folder.
