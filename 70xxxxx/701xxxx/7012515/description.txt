SOME TRIVIA FROM IMDB

Sean Durkin was looking for an unknown actress to play the role of Martha, which was the only role auditions were held for. Elizabeth Olsen auditioned twice for the role of Martha, and had to begin filming only two weeks after winning the part.

The title of the movie appears to be built around two songs by Jackson C. Frank. "Marcy's Song" is performed by John Hawkes' character in the movie. Jackson C. Frank's own rendition of "Marlene" plays during the end credits. 

Shot over 20 days.
