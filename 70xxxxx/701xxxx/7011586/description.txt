Award-winning teacher Mary Lou Walker presents 10 clear rules to making conversation rewarding and fulfilling in this casual compendium of wit and wisdom. Positing that conversation groups, or colloquies, make the perfect social antidote in todayâ€™s culture of tweeting and texting, she infuses each step with valuable life-lessons to help develop character and likability while mastering the art of engaging with others through dialogue. 

Ideal for starting colloquies in the living room, classroom, or public library, her instructions include: â€œdonâ€™t steal the subject,â€ â€œprobe, donâ€™t pry,â€ â€œdonâ€™t take the bait,â€ and â€œthink before you speak.â€ Through real-life examples, Mary Lou demonstrates how to â€œspeak easyâ€ with civility on all matters from high brow to low brow, with no topic off-limits.
