,mCihhh,2012-06-06T11:27Z,"Hi there MRShanku and thank you for your rips.
I don't know if you take requests but I leave here a suggestion:
The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946)

It's a great Film-Noir and the BluRay was released a few days ago.
Here's the source: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7322750/

If you can't do it there's no problem ;)
Cumps and thanks once again."
