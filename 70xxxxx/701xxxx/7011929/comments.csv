[T],scuba-doo,2012-02-06T08:06Z,"@smithy125 hope you enjoy it :)

for further speed boost revert to windows classic theme..

then right click ""My Computer"" go to ""Advanced"" tab. Go to Performance, settings and chose ""Adjust for best performance"".

it wont look as ""nice"" but will be a little more responsive."

audio error....

press : windows key + r
type: services.msc
goto: Windows Audio

double click and change from Disabled to Automatic and then start the service."
,tomasSC,2012-02-11T01:26Z,is this better than MicroXP??
[T],scuba-doo,2012-02-12T08:04Z,"@tomasSC

depends how you mean better. Less has been removed or diasabled in this version...But if you change to windows classic theme and under performance setting chose best performance... it runns very fast.

im working on version 3 as we speak...with no languages or keyboard layouts removed and bug fixes etc etc. so maybe wait for that one."
[T],scuba-doo,2012-02-15T15:44Z,"Get version 3 now :)
