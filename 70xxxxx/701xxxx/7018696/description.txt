@@@ Description @@@


Conflict: Desert Storm II: Back to Baghdad is the well-timed successor to the original tactical squad-based action game from last fall. This game was originally being called Conflict Desert Sabre, but a real life invasion of Iraq a few months ago provided a golden opportunity to work the word Baghdad into the title and capitalize on the world's fascination with Operation: Iraqi Freedom.

Gameplay: The tactical squad-based action in the Conflict series is unlike the system we've come to know in the Tom Clancy-themed games like Rainbow Six partly because we're getting the third person perspective. CDSII stays true to this essence by requiring players to plan, strategize and engage in combat all on the fly. The set of skills you'll need to be successful is unique among many similar themed games. Fast twitch read and reaction abilities like you'd need in a third person shooter combined with the patience and analytical skills you might have to use in a real time strategy are both at a premium and it is for this reason that this second game in the series should be received with open arms.
