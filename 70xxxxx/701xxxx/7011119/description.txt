Meet Bharat, the Aam Aadmi, part time cashier     
and part time "Hanuman" at Ramleela, residing     
in the city of Bhopal where he lives with his     
father Shivnarayan, an old timer who values       
freedom and hopes to see a corruption free        
administration in the country. Bharat is          
married to Nisha a schoolteacher, loving and      
caring but doubting wife concerned more about     
Bharat's promotion from cashier to manager at     
the bank than his flying tricks at the 'Ramleela'.
The small and happy family lives with a forced    
upon guest Amita, a young, beautiful girl who     
works at a call center, forgets her ID at home    
and likes to hitch a ride with Bharat on his      
scooter when he is not busy dropping his wife at  
school. Did I forget to mention, Bharat drives a  
Scooter, the sidekick of this story.
