FUBAR Destroyer 2010
This is a very very very nasty application! As with the other applications in the FUBAR-series, it is designed only to be annoying.This one takes it one step further...
This application will WIPE & DESTROY all data on your harddisks.When you run this app, it will ask you if you really know what you are doing.And it will ask you again.. :)
If you choose Yes, it will quickly install and register itself. And nothing more. Nothing more will happen, until next time any user logs into Windows. Then all data on all harddisks will be permanently wiped and destroyed. YOU CANNOT RUN THIS PROGRAM BY ACCIDENT!Unless you are seriously retarded! :)"

What's really funny is some retarded kid, who made a review of FUBAR DeskFiller, and described it as a virus that would delete all your files :D

Now, talk about being stupid and unable to distinguish 2 things from each other ;)"
