,the_devious,2012-02-08T10:19Z,"Hey Gary,
Cheers for this; much appreciated. I'm a bit worried though, since Tellymad has closed down, what with all the file hosting fallout. If Magz is out of the picture, who is gonna perform a cap to start of with?
Fingers crossed, eh."
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-02-08T11:21Z,"Magz is still around! I don't want to be barred from this site by announcing where, coz that would be a shame to all the people who only know how to get the shows from me, but she is still helping all of us to watch TOWIE and MIC! Bless her heart!"
