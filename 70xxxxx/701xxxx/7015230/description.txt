"Nobody's Fault"

When a violent incident involving a 
patient has serious consequences for 
one staff member, House and the team 
are placed under review by Dr. Walter 
Cofield, Foreman's former mentor and 
current Chief of Neurology. As House 
and each member of his team recount 
the details of the dramatic and life-
threatening incident, Cofield must 
weigh the team's unconventional brand 
of collaboration against their 
ability to save lives.
