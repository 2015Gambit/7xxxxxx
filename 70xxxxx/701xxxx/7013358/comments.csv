,bushbabae,2012-02-06T23:44Z,Is anybody else having problems with downloads from tvteam ?  For the last 3 days I have not been able to download.  It says downloading but does not move at all and I am at a loss.  All other torrents are working fine.  Help anyone please xxx
,bushbabae,2012-02-07T03:04Z,Its so frustrating because quite a few of the programmes I watch I can't find on any other sites that have not been put there by TVteam.  I have sent a message to them but I don't hold out a lot of hope of a quick fix for this...means no tele to watch !!
