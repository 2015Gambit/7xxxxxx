,Gvarimoto,2012-02-08T21:03Z,"Thanks alot !

Is it safe to play before 10.Feb ? (security triggers perhaps ?)

Since it wont officialy release untill then, any answer will help."
,chupo28,2012-02-08T21:11Z,"Is it playable with +L.T. 2?

Thank you in advance:)"
,Craiggers1990,2012-02-09T03:32Z,@Gvarimoto unsure since it cant be patched yet with abgx because it hasnt be verified in the database i wouldnt play it. but once it gets verified which i would say is in the next couple of hours yes it should be safe. but thats my opinion

thanks"
,RaithMoracus,2012-08-21T08:34Z,"Do you get notices when people comment on these things? 

Anyways, Boobsman, please, if you have access to the NTSC-U version, please up that. I've spent 3 hours searching for a working link that doesn't require a premium account to sites ryushare or netload. The only other torrents I've found are all useless and un-seeded. 

I love your ups. I appreciate you. You're amazing, and they all work (and burn) perfectly. But the lack of ntsc ups with this game is driving me crazy."
