Vincent likes his girlfriend. Katherine's pretty, smart, and successful. Trouble is, she's 
starting to talk about long-term commitment, something Vincent's spent his entire life avoiding. 
Since romantic complications are the last thing he wants to deal with, Vincent meets his friends 
for their regular night of drinks. Little does he know that he's about to be blindsided by a 
beautiful, seductive, irresistible freight train named Catherine. Suddenly, he's hung over in 
bed next to the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, unsure about the previous night's events. 
Was it just making out, he wonders, or did something more serious happen between them? Should he 
tell Katherine? Will he ever see Catherine again? Vincent's about to find that a stumble on the 
staircase of love can turn into a horrific, fatal plummet...
