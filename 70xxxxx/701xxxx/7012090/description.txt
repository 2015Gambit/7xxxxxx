Star Wars Family Guy "It's A Trap" Episode VI Return Of The Jedi HDTV

"It's a Trap!" is the double-episode season finale of the ninth season of the animated series Family Guy. The episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 22, 2011. It retells the story of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi as "Blue Harvest" did with Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope and "Something, Something, Something, Dark Side" did with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back by recasting characters from Family Guy into roles from the films.



Star Wars Episode III Robot Chicken HDTV


Star Wars Episode III Robot Chicken HDTV is a 2010 episode of the television comedy series Robot Chicken, and the third and final installment in the Annie Award-winning and Emmy-nominated Robot Chicken: Star Wars trilogy. It premiered on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block on December 19, 2010. The special is 45 minutes long, as opposed to the 21-minute runtime of the two previous Star Wars specials. It was the final Robot Chicken: Star Wars special

Unlike the previous installments in the satirical trilogy, Episode III tells a more cohesive chronological tale stretching from before the events of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to after Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. Emperor Palpatine, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, acts as a narrator - chronicling his own rise to power, the questionable wisdom of his selection of Anakin Skywalker as an apprentice, the extermination of the Jedi, and routine life aboard the Death Star. Several skits feature Boba Fett, voiced by Breckin Meyer (who was nominated for an Emmy for his writing work on the first Robot Chicken: Star Wars), including his fall into and time spent in the Sarlacc pit. Other skits feature more minor characters like Gary the Stormtrooper, Max Rebo, and Prune Face - none of whom had speaking roles in any of the Star Wars films.
