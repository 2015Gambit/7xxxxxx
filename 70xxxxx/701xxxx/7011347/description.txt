The Mystic Knights of Tir Na NÃ³g is an American television series set in a fantasy version of ancient Ireland, created by Saban Entertainment. It was loosely based on actual Irish mythology. The name derives from TÃ­r na nÃ“g, one of the Otherworlds of Irish mythology. It was Saban's first fantasy series to involve knights, dragons, and wizards. It aired on the Fox Kids block on Fox from September 1, 1998 and ending on May 7, 1999. A second season, Mystic Knights: Battle Thunder was planned, but was later cancelled, and its budget was put towards Power Rangers Lost Galaxy. It was an attempt in doing an original non-Japanese special-effects series rather than adapting from actual Japanese tokusatsu.
