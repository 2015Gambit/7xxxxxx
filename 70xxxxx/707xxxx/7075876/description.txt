Alanah Rae is thinking about moving in with her older boyfriend but his son, Rocco, isn't too crazy about the idea. He's trying to reconnect with his dad and doesn't want Alanah interfering with his plans. Alanah wants everyone to be able to get along and live together so she pleads with Rocco. He'll drop the whole thing if Alanah is willing to drop his pants and play a tune on his skin flute!!
