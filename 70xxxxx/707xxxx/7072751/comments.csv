DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS!!!! Here, or anywhere!

Yes, SILENCE, IS COMPLICITY, HOWEVER...

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER DIRECT ATTENTION TO, AT, TOWARD... THE DENIALISTS. It is what they live for. It is what they live ON, like leaches live on blood. They have no more interest in getting to the Truth than Hitler's propagandist Goebbels did.

If you ever comment BECAUSE of something they've said,
AND YOU SHOULD, YOU MUST, do it for the ONLOOKERS, those that are confused, misinformed, or uninformed.

SILENCE IS COMPLICITY!!!! Criminal!

However, DIRECTING ATTENTION (RESPECT) TO A DENIER,
IS CRIMINAL STUPIDITY. 1. Bleeds your time and energy; 2. Feeds the Animals; 3. CONFUSES THE ONLOOKERS - THEY TAKE IT AS A SHOW OF RESPECT TO THE DENIALISTS!

DON'T DO IT. "

The entire system of carbon trading is another scam handed off to Al Gore by its true inventor, Ken Lay of Enron.

Where is the real source data? Not the opinions or interpretations of the source data. The real source data. It has has been locked away, concealed, destroyed and misrepresented. That's all you need to know."

""Don't be a fool....""  Listen to this crap, it will turn your head full of mush into something resembling Swiss cheese.  "
