One day after pretty Meg Keltons husband Ted has left for work, she gets assaulted by the apartment buildings janitor in the stairwell as she was taking out some trash. This begins a chain of events that will she Meg flee Boston to dissappear in the crowds of NYC and then going by the name of Ellen over and over she meets people who seem nice but something always goes very wrong. I added some commercials from 1965 to the final mpeg2 file. Before the Feature Film are AMC Rambler Rogue, Folgers coffee and Sweeta TV commercials. After are Polaroid, Brylcreem, Lady Sunbeam and a long trailer for Thunderball.

Doris Wishman (1912 - 2002) was a prolific self taught exploitation film maker. She learned when she worked as a secretary for movie distributor Joseph E. Levine that a low budget movie could make money by way of good advertising and successful distribution. She started out with Nudist, Naturalist films and progressed to true sexploitation by 1965 as the bar had been raised on what was allowed in public theatres.
