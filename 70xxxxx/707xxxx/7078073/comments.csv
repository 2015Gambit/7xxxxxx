,666ASPEN666,2012-03-06T18:40Z,"magnets links work for me.. however you can not choose which files to download or even see the files size or anything, in my opinion.............. Magnet links = Pure crap! I want the damn option of choosing which files within the torrent i want to download! Not possible with magnet crap!"

,19Grim80,2012-03-10T08:14Z,"With regard to magnets, if you don't want to download certain files of a torrent, select the files you don't want as soon as it's starts to download in your chosen client, then change their priority to 'Don't Download'. If you're having trouble with Magnets, completely remove what ever torrent client you are using & reinstall using the latest version. Fixes it everytime for me. Also, you don't need to like Magnets, they're doing the job just fine which is keeping torrents like this available to you & me.  Google it..."
