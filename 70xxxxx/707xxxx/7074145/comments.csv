,crutchy,2012-03-05T01:25Z,"Works perfectly for me, great torrent."
,FThisSht,2012-03-05T19:01Z,"How do I use this?  You really should include a txt file with instructions for tech-tards like me.  Downloaded the files; now what?

What do you mean ""put the directory to...blah, blah, blah""? Put to???"
,FThisSht,2012-03-05T19:14Z,"Nevermind.  Got it.  Had to go digging around Google to find it, though.  You could be a little clearer next time.

For my fellow tech-tards, let me clarify what he means by ""Just put the directory to Photoshop->Locales and choose english from Settings -> Interface in PS"".  He means go to Photoshop in your Applications folder and drop the folder you get from this torrent into the folder labeled ""Locales"".  While yer there, delete the folder that says ""en-MX"" from the ""Locales"" folder.  I did this, started up PS, and it was all English.

Cheers"

Yeah put to, not everybody on this planet speaks fluent english. Use your brain people! It's not that hard!

This is my first torrent and I am very glad I helped so many people :-). Little things matter. "
,channaa,2012-08-16T06:33Z,I don't have an Adobe Photoshop folder in my applications. Can anyone help me out? I am also fairly new to this. Right on. 
,channaa,2012-08-16T08:43Z,I thought that this was the torrrent for the CS5  itself but after a brief reading I understood what it was for and got it to do its thing. Thanks!!!!!! 
,NovaNika,2012-09-17T21:25Z,"Where can I find an English language pack for Win. XP? I've looked around piratebay and can't find one at all. I installed PS CS5 recently and it all came up in Russian. I tried changing the language only to discover that it didn't come with an English Language pack. Any help would be great, thanks."
