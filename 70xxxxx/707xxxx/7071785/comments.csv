,TyMod,2012-03-03T03:14Z,"I agree, the trailer looked like shit but I will give it a try. Small time games always have something unique and good to them."
,stalker277,2012-03-03T14:30Z,"Dude, edit the title to include JULIA without dots... the search engone won't know how to find it else. I had to search for reloaded."
,Nojadx,2012-03-03T15:13Z,"The dll in crackfolder, have Virus ""generic trj"" TROJAN from Spain, Capturing screenshots, and personal data !
Then i try start the game (only the cracked dll was auto removed) Stop ! virus in the cracked exe too, FORGET all, i uninstall. 
Happy i have a legit antivirusprog updated, no mention, bacause i don't like boobsman to make something against it.
Now all 2-3 boosman downloads this morning are deleted and my pc scanned OK.
I never got any virus from this site, now i register a account only to tell some about this shit only."
,Nojadx,2012-03-03T20:01Z,"Dålig på engelska, så viktigt, att meddela alla att cracket här, har virus Troyan, som capture screen och tar privat info, VARFÖR, jag HATAR !"
[V],boobsman,2012-03-04T09:09Z,"@ stalker277 that's why i've included the name Julia in the tags section so that it come up with or without dots as well as Reloaded which is how you found it :)

@ Nojadx there is NO virus, the detection your getting is a false positive from the crack. Its very common with games to get this false positive and nothing to worry about."
,Nojadx,2012-03-04T10:06Z,"Ja, dålig på Engelska, Hatar att få virus, alla kanske inte har lika bra antivirusprog, och åker dit på shit. tyckte bra att folk får veta, så dom kan skaffa skydd. Så dom har extra noga koll.
Jag litar naturligtvis inte på denna upladdare så vill inte informera om vilket antivirusprog jag har, då kanske det byggs in något shit som inte jag upptäcker nästa gång."
,Nojadx,2012-03-04T10:10Z,"Men det är första gången jag får falsk positiv virusvarning, och inget prog eller spel är värt att chansa, ifall inte falskt."
[V],boobsman,2012-03-04T23:08Z,Det är en falskt positiv spelet har laddats ner 700 gånger och ingen har smittats! De flesta spel som har en spricka kommer att ge ett falskt positivt så det finns inget att oroa sig :)
,k81689,2012-03-05T05:27Z,"Finished the game.

A computer program lies is their greatest invention in their future.

Too much Nitrogen will explode!!!

A planet covers with ocean contains NO water so the only survivor can not return to earth.

,alec_alec,2012-03-05T10:35Z,"Help!

For the life of me, I cant copy the julia.exe in the crack folder. Its either corrupted, missing, or neds suped-duper admin priviliges. What to do?"
,alec_alec,2012-03-05T19:58Z,"Nevermind, my bad, tried to emulate with MagicIso. Alcohol fixed the problem"
,alec_alec,2012-03-05T23:42Z,"And indeed, it sucks."
,n0mski,2012-03-06T01:20Z,"some peeps complain that getting AV warnings i used pes2012 rld.dll fixed the warnings for me
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/n0mad720/J.U.L.I.A._Fix.rar grab it here if ya want"
,Paveway,2012-03-06T14:36Z,"This game is the biggest piece of shit i have seen in my entire life. The developers of this abortion want taking out into a field and shooting! The stories shite, the puzzles are retarded and Rachel looks like she's been beaten with a baseball bat. Thank you Boobsman for the fast upload though mate!"
,pastorok,2012-03-10T19:56Z,"My avast say its Trojan Gen....Evry time when I started a game, its exe gone into the hell of avast.

,arn420,2012-03-21T19:17Z,"My Kaspersky detect rld.dll as a torojen.I dont think it is false-positive.This type of torojen affect your browsers and shows add in every page.
And this game is a piece of shit."
,nemesite,2012-03-31T09:58Z,It's all good. Clean and works without a hitch. However the game itself is utter shit imo
