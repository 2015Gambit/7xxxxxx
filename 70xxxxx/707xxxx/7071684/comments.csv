,SyndromeOfADown,2012-03-02T15:51Z,"Thanks for the quick upload inspiron! I was on the official stream yesterday and there were a lot of technical glitches. Did you fix/skip these glitches in your release, or did you not have problems?"
,AciDToX8,2012-03-02T15:54Z,"hey bro, i seed and rate your torrents every time so don't worry, people will not forget about you"
,dominique120,2012-03-02T16:02Z,You are the best man! unfortunately I tuned in a little late for the show and was not able to listen to the first 3 DJs. You saved me. Simply awesome inpiron!!!!
[T],jmz619,2012-03-02T16:33Z,Question: What program do you use to split tracks? I'm looking for a way to split a podcast but not sure what to use.
,feitosathiago,2012-03-02T17:42Z,"very good inspiron! thx so much, but... wheres the radio show at the beginning of the event, before tom fall? thx again mate :)"
,SyndromeOfADown,2012-03-02T18:37Z,"I just checked and track #8 of Tom Fall has ~1 minute of repeating beats, during the stream crash of the live event. So the tracks were not fixed before uploading. Just letting everyone know it's got a bug in track #8 Sweet Quasar (Tom Fall Mashup) =P"

,Prit-O,2012-03-02T19:27Z,@inspiron Thanks Bro for the brilliant upload. You're a lifesaver. A true trancer who shares his love with us all. Great Stuff ;-)
,josegrande,2012-03-02T20:02Z,"Thanks inspiron u did it again!

Btw, split tracks are much better and much more time consuming to do. They still play like a continous mix unless your media player settings are messed up. "
