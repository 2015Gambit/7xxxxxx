:: Decription: Rick Grimes, a small-town cop, gets shot on the job and goes into a coma. When he wakes up, the worldΓÇÖs gone to shit, the dead coming back and eating the living. Every minute becomes a struggle for life, and the longer the nightmare goes on, the more it becomes apparent that the living might be more of a problem than the dead.
