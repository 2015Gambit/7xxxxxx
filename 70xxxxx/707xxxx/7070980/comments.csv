so i downloaded this one and it the exact same..   

its completed download,   but when i play it in Vlc media player it has to try and repiar,,,, but it doesnt all repiar,  onjly  about 78% then it plays with only ""1 HOUR 3 SECONDS""  of movie...  

so if its not like that at your end then maybe something wrong in the upload.   

has  anyone ells noticed the leangth of film.??"
