,eriklmth,2012-03-12T03:38Z,"I looked at the frequency spectrum for the first three tracks using audacity.  I looked at 192kbps, 320, and wav versions I've downloaded (for each song).  For the first and third track, there was a noticibly longer frequency at lower volume levels for the wav files as compared to the other versions.  The 320 version seemed better than the 192.  I've never read these spectrums before, but I think I did it correctly, and I'll go with the wav file after all."
