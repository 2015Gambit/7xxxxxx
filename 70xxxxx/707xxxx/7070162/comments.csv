"
,garzanich14126,2012-03-01T23:52Z,Word up awesome!!!!  works on emulator  Kids will be happy thanks.
,ZaReGGae,2012-03-02T00:49Z,"Region - PAL or NTSC, please!!!"
,codyormoe,2012-03-02T01:16Z,"To be honest, I never check the region. Both PAL and NTSC work the same on my NTSC Wii. I put the games on a usb hard drive and play through Wiiflow. Never had an issue with any game.

If you're worried though, you can download Regionfrii, it's a program that will change the region of any Wii ISO to whatever region you need it to be."

Thanks soo much its finally here and awesome too!"
,Otaku073,2012-03-03T04:11Z,Ok so when i boot this it plays but the screen is gray and shaking up and down. My other games boot just fine but this one doesnt. Any help?
,MarcoCV,2012-03-03T06:56Z,"can someone please tell me the rar password? I cant get to enter the suggested page in the ""read me"""
,codyormoe,2012-03-03T13:55Z,"Marco....This isn't a rar file and there isn't a read me file. I think you downloaded a different torrent.

Otaku...what loader are you using? It plays fine on Wiiflow, but I have others I can test, just need to know what you use."
,hoodbag,2012-03-03T20:10Z,This is PAL.
,an9el61,2012-03-04T12:19Z,"Just put onto my wii and works fine, kids love this game. WBFS file needs to be converted to .iso with wii backup manager then onto your wii with WBFS manager. Many Thanks uploader."
,codyormoe,2012-03-04T19:21Z,"You don't need to convert to ISO then back to WBFS. Create a folder for the WBFS file with game title as it's name, put the WBFS file into it. Put folder into the WBFS folder of your external HDD.

On my external it would look like this...
W:WBFSMario Party 9 [SSQP01]SSQP01.wbfs

W: is the drive letter I assigned to the USB HDD we use for the Wii.

Or you can just use Wii Backup Manager to move the WBFS file onto the usb HDD, it will create the folder for you and put everything in the right place.

The only reason to convert to ISO is if you're going to burn to disc. In that case, you can use Regionfrii to change from PAL to NTSC(or whichever region you need) before burning, if necessary."
,lilrico0917,2012-03-07T09:19Z,"Works Fine on 4.3u Wii 2006, if you use Usb Loader gx just make sure you go to settings game mode and force it to NTSC and it should work just fine."
,lilrico0917,2012-03-07T09:20Z,forgot to mention that the game is Pal 
,xw1r3dx,2012-03-08T09:07Z,thanks! been looking for this one
,abc123mc,2012-03-10T02:52Z,For some reason... this comes out black and white on my computer.  Does anyone else have that problem or know how to fix it? : ( it's working but I just don't see colour...
,abc123mc,2012-03-10T03:10Z,"^ Sorry, I meant it comes out B&W on my wii : ) Thanks in advance for your help!"
,05linx,2012-03-10T08:46Z,@abc123mc its showing in black in white cause your wii may be in a different region than the game is. You can change it to show in your region in the options in CFG (if that is what you're using).
,abc123mc,2012-03-10T17:35Z,"I tried to force it to NTSC region (cuz I thought that was my region) but it just made my screen black with small white text scrolling... How can I check my region?  Also, do you know if there's a specific IOS it should be set at?  

Haha as you can tell, I'm not a very technical person ; ) Thanks for your help!"
,abc123mc,2012-03-10T22:21Z,Sweet This works!
,gwapitonorf,2012-03-18T03:25Z,"THANK YOU SO MUCH!! WORKING GREAT! IM USING WII FLOW :) 
"
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-03-19T13:10Z,"@abc
You should know your region. Its really simple. Basically, if you live in USA or Japan, you are NTSC. Otherwise PAL.

This is really small. I know games can be small and good, but when you can use 4 times the amount of space without any drawback at all... it just seems like they left a lot out. "
,kibub,2012-05-12T19:34Z,"Thank you for WBFS version.
In Canada we have Download limit and WBFS its our saving.
Thanks again"

I'm guessing your not familiar with wbfs format lol. the actual game itself may actaully only be 1GB, but the disc is 8GB. basically they waste the entire disc and write ""filler"" data for the other 7GB. super smash brothers brawl is a 6GB game, so they write 2 GB of junk data to the disc. I have no idea why, but im guessing it looks more professional if the disc is completely used?"
,D34THW41K3R,2012-06-28T05:03Z,"but, in wbfs format, they nix all the filler junk, and you have just the game data. in other words, no filler data equals smaller game size. thus is the advantage people see in wbfs games. btw, sorry for  double posting lol"
,122rocop,2012-07-08T13:47Z,This game is ok but mario party 8 is better
