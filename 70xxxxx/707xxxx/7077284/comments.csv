,Bookeek,2012-03-06T21:47Z,"well, it's a little bit more than 'just' readable. By readable I mean= you will not get annoyed by too many errors in text while reading. Anyway, I guarantee it's the best Gardner collection out there at this time.

Keep uploading great torrents my dear ;)"

,eleaticus,2012-04-10T04:34Z,"Oh, no!  All of these  ESGardner novels but not a one he wrote as AAFair!!  The Lam and Cool novels were so much richer than the Masons; humor, detecting by the hero, ... just richer!  Please get them and UL them!

Please!  Please!  Please!"
,UncleO,2012-04-10T04:43Z,"OMG, YES! U R RIGHT, Eleaticus. Donald Lam & Bertha Cool [& Elsa Brand?] were so much more fun than Perry & staff.

I'd echo Bertha if we'd get a bunch of them here:

""Fry me for an oyster!""


So, yes: Please!"
