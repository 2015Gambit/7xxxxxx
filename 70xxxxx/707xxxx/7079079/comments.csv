,orion8_2012,2012-08-26T19:46Z,"I still can't seem to get it to run (windows 7).  When you install nx, it asks for ""Enter the license server or browse to a license file"".  Where do you point it to because the default is nx80ugslicensing040UGSLicensing.msi which apparently doesn't work for me (nor does NX8.0.lic in CrackUGSLicensing since that file can be only used when installing the license).

Thanks.

p.s.  Somehow, the UGSLicensing is installed in C:Program Files (x86)UGSUGSLicensing on my machine."
