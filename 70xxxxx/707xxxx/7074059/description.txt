About
Turtle Kevux is a Linux system based on gnu software and a linux kernel, all compiled with uclibc instead of the more common glibc.
It is not fhs or lsb compatible, which is seen as one of the many security enhancements.
It provides numerous space efficient packages available today.
It forms a complete but different system to Windows, Mac OS, Solaris, Bsd, or Linux.
Turtle Kevux is closest to Linux.
This system partially implements the Featureless Linux Library.

Turtle Kevux 0.9.5

While fixing the installer problems with turtle kevux 0.9.4, I kept finding more problems until an entire month passed.
I did manage to fix a whole lot of problems and so I release turtle kevux 0.9.5 with a functional installer.
I also stumbled apon other problems and even managed to solve some really old known issues.
Claws-mail now works, the latest series of xorg and mesa are now being used, and even the 64-bit cdrom boot issue is resolved.
Now for the bad parts.
Modesetting is functional and enabled by default, but I find that my old ati radeon card that worked wonderfully with mesa 7.8 does not perform as well with 7.11. With modesetting enabled, its performance is barely acceptable and with modesetting off it is only acceptable performance. However, the newer video cards work wonderful with modesetting. If you have any trouble with desktop performance, try booting with the option: nomodeset.
