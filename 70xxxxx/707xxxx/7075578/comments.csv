I have a touch (2nd gen) but I'm running IOS 4.2.1 will this one work for me, or do you recommended the old version of this game."
,Koenn1,2012-05-20T09:16Z,do you need jailbreak for this?
,Fegelein3,2012-05-27T03:34Z,Please seed. It takes a very long time to download due to the low amount of seeders.
,iMod,2012-05-28T20:17Z,"@mat5904, i think there is no need for you to get this updated version, this update was only iPhone 4 and iPad 1
So if you have any of these devices then yes you'll need the update"
,kalec545,2012-06-23T19:09Z,"hey ive got an ipad 2 and an ipod touch 4. ive downloaded the app, and it shows up in my itunes library, but i cant transfer it to the devices, even tho the computer and the devices are synced. any help?"
,nkostic,2012-07-08T01:56Z,"HELP PLEASE: i downloaded this app (using safari) and transferred it from the downloads folder into itunes and that worked fine, but once i connect my iphone and try to sync it, it syncs all other apps except this one, it doesnt give me any error message just unchecks it and removes it from the ""to be synched"" list. this happens to every version of this game i tried to install through the mac, does anyone know how to fix this?? Also, the file is 466MB in my downloads folder, but when i move it to Itunes, it becomes over 680MB, why does that happen??"
