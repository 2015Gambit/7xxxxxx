Capo is a musician's best friend. It lets you slow down your favorite songs, so you can hear the notes and learn how they are played. And, you can tab out your songs in record time atop a highly-detailed OpenCL-powered spectrogram display!

It's your music
No longer do you have to rely on the musical tastes of others to learn music. Drag songs right from your music collection into capo to start learning them.

Tab it out!
By simply drawing atop the spectrogram, Capo will generate tablature automatically for you. It really doesn't get much easier than more...
