,General1825,2012-03-04T03:21Z,Thanks !!  This episode was worth waiting for.  How many are in this season?  Do you know?  Thanks for you great efforts.
,whmxtra,2012-03-04T04:25Z,"should be at least 10 eps, if not 12. So worst case there's still 2 more to go.

On the bright side, when this season ends the first season of Dance Moms Miami starts :)"

,bluemystic01,2012-03-09T04:08Z,Wondering how long it takes to post a dance moms. I am waiting for Episode 9
,whmxtra,2012-03-09T05:21Z,"Episode 9 up here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7088206/Dance.Moms.S02E09.avi

please read my description there, it is a temp release for those that can't wait, the HQ version will be released Saturday.

bluemystic, it usually takes till Saturdays because that's when Lifetime puts them online now. So my sources can't get it till then, once they have it I can rip it and throw it up.

Now having said that this rip I uploaded now is not HQ but for those that can't wait it's the best I can do as the alt sources I found are low quality, but it'll do till I can do the better rip Saturday"
