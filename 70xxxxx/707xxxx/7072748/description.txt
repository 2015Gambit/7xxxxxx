A female war photographer's hardcore obsession with a reformed, but notorious murderer is disrupted when she takes a destitute woman and daughter into her home. The daughter's strange relationship with the gas mask her shellshocked military father left behind fuels a grave chain reaction. 

Gas Mask is a highly-stylized, uncompromising series of dystopian snapshots leading up to the fall of New York City. The story is told through the final days of a crew of sadistic gangsters, a bizarre little girl, a delusional government agent, a famous photographer, a notorious murderer, an unbreakable mother, a master tailor, a shifty graffiti artist, a fiendish cop, a hungry city councilman, and more.





I uploaded a mobi of Gas Mask in the last noir pack, but by mistake it was an early edit. This should have less errors for those that enjoy the book and want a cleaner copy.

If you like this book please review it on Amazon and Goodreads, so more readers will give it a chance.

Thx.
