,skullNbones,2012-07-09T16:39Z,"thank you for the up sarsars.

1. Install the game.
   Do NOT create a desktop icon (executes 'Launcher.exe which updates the game if online).
   Install MS Visual C++ & DirectX.
   Do NOT launch Depth Hunter yet.
   [Finish].

2. Copy ALL files from the 'UPDATE' folder & paste into the game directory: [C:Program FilesBiartDepth Hunter]
   Copy ALL files from the 'CRACK' folder & paste into the game directory: [C:Program FilesBiartDepth Hunter]
   Right-click 'depthhunter.exe': Send To -> click Desktop (create shortcut).
   Do NOT use 'Launcher.exe' or the game will update & render the crack invalid.

3. Start the game from the created desktop shortcut
   Do NOT enter any Serial Number: Apply / [Enter]
   Do NOT play the game online."
