Spearfishing and Underwater Hunting are ancient fishing and hunting
methods, used to catch fish and shellfish by using a mechanical harpoon
Today, spearfishing is a sports activity in many countries around the
world, especially in the UK, around the Mediterranean Sea and in South
America. Spearfishers hunt while diving apnoea, holding their breath, so
have to coordinate their energy carefully while monitoring their prey
especially in tactically challenging hunting situations
