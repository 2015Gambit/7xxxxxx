Richard Buckner is an American singer-songwriter born in California. After living in Edmonton, Alberta for a number of years, he currently resides in Brooklyn, NY.

This record is rooted in a blend of outlaw country, Americana, and folk, but venturing into experimental and avant garde pastures. It may not be quite on the same level as his best country and experimental albums (1997â€²s Devotion & Doubt and 2002â€²s Impasse), but Our Blood offers a glimpse into the world of Richard Buckner that serves as an ideal starting point for new listeners.
