IMPORTANT:

I don't do movie uploads mainly due to the time and dedication involved... however, I really wanted to see if this anime was as good as everyone said it was. The problem was I couldn't find an English Dub that was suitable for playing on my laptop (non-high definition) that was actually dubbed in English as claimed. So, yeah, I had to convert one [Source: BCD 720p rip]. The issue is that If I was looking for it, other people might be looking for it too, so here it is. Enjoy.

On a side note, I did enjoy the movie. I thought It was pretty good. This movie might be suitable for younger audiences as there is no nudity, little bit of violence and only a little blood (mainly face punches, but some comical uses also.)

On another side note, if you insist that the only way to watch anime and don't understand whatever language it was made in is to get English subbed versions, well, I really don't know what to tell you. I don't watch movies to read subtitles. To each their own.

Best viewed on a laptop.

I watched this on VLC player and it played flawlessly. I also did some quick reviewing on quicktime and did not find any issues. Audio is a little low on quicktime, so VLC might be your best option unless you have headphones or something.

ENJOY.
