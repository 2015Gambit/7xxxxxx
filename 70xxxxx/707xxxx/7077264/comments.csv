As far as the movie goes it takes on a novel approach and the animation style used for the virtual world was new for me and I liked it. Grandma made a good point that hunger and loneliness are the greatest horrors known to man.
I was not expecting much but on a hot summer evening as the dark shadows of gloom were engulfing me as I sat worn out by this worlds endless races I saw this movie and it made me happy so stormium thank you. "
