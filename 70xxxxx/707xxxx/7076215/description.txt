"2001" is a story of evolution. Sometime in the distant past, someone or something 
nudged evolution by placing a monolith on Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout 
the universe as well). Evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moon's 
surface, where yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith 
placers that humankind has evolved that far. Now a race begins between computers 
(HAL) and human (Bowman) to reach the monolith placers. The winner will achieve 
the next step in evolution, whatever that may be.ΓÇª
