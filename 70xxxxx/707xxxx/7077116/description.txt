Hi all, might be my last torrent for a while, I am being blocked from thepiratebay.se and had to proxy in to get this out. This is the CaptainSim 707 with all expansions. While we have seen excellent rips already, this is an installer, with registry keys and instructions to modify the sound.ini in the CS folder. It was made available by our excellent friend 
Armagedon, who told me it was available for only two hours on a Russian site, I am guessing rutracker and he went to some effort to provide us translated instructions, which I clarified a bit. If you already have the rip, it might be good to add the instructed changes to the dll.xml, reg keys and sound.ini changes, which is what I did. The only cost for this is that you will have to seed for a short (or any length of) time, since everything is bundled into a .zip.

Also, try to support the developer, it encourages new releases.


As always, see below. I have no idea of my future status, but I will 
always endeavor to help:
