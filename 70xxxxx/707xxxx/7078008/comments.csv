,werdbooty,2012-03-05T07:06Z,"Jebus, download times are getting worse with every episode. Thanks for the up. Will seed."

,oiukl,2012-03-05T07:33Z,"lforis88 grow up and stop acting like your in middle school, I will never seed for a little shit like yourself"
,Gaist,2012-03-05T07:35Z,honeslty fuck off madmax. etc.. comments aren't here for whiny bitches. have a good fucking day. asshole. comment about the fucking episode.
,prosniper007,2012-03-05T07:59Z,"Ok, i never comment, but seriously you Americans/Brits/whatever STOP COMPLAINING a country such as mine, New Zealand, uses this site quite a lot, as we are behind in almost all international t.v shows, and about 99% of us have a limited bandwidth. I'm not sure how it works in the U.S but from what i understand you get unlimited internet and pay for what you use. We have the choice of internet plans. For instance, i get 60GB a month, once i use this quota, my speed gets reduced to ""dial-up"" until the new month, so no, i will NEVER seed. I download a 1GB movie for instance, i end up using over 1GB for the uploading while i'm downloading, i'm not them going to leave it there  to further waste my broadband. Oh, and FYI, NOBODY, and i mean NOBODY will EVER seed just because you come on here and leave a comment saying ""SEED""... idiots"
,sad-sam,2012-03-05T08:01Z,"lforis88 and madmax1111, you guys really are fucktarded assholes.  get a grip foris, you ignorant wanker fucktard bitch. 

Getting back to the point, typical of walking dead, you can skip all but the final five minutes and save yourself some time"
,driver-8,2012-03-05T08:30Z,I just want to complain. I am really upset about it.
,Wylde.1989,2012-03-05T09:26Z,ok guys for one it is free to SEED and not everyone gets the walking dead where there from so how about less bitching and more SEEDING 
,chinoco,2012-03-05T10:11Z,thanks ettv love you
,grugly1984,2012-03-05T10:56Z,its only taken me 5 mins.... thanks...
,jaxative,2012-03-05T12:50Z,"damn password scams. Yeah I wanna pay $5 in mobile phone credit for a show I can buy for less. I will know in the future that ettv is a name not to be trusted, a shame cos it was a fast download."
,jaxative,2012-03-05T12:59Z,"Yeah I'm gonna fill out a survey that'll cost me $32 in mobile phone credit to download a show I could (eventually) buy in Australia for $5. I used to look for the ettv brand especially, but if you are going to be even greedier than the studios then for me anyway ettv has become a name to avoid. "
,fuckneck,2012-03-05T13:58Z,"What a bunch of whinning pussies.
Get something for free, yet still complain.
Downloaded this in 5 minutes from Japan.
If you wanna bitch, try looking towards
yourself and the stupidity you emit.
Not our fault your computer sucks."
,JRaiden,2012-03-05T14:39Z,"Judging from these comments, I'm disappoint at The Walking Dead's... audience."
,AKJBronx,2012-03-05T15:38Z,"@prosniper007 People in Australia/New Zealand are the reason I try to seed more than 2:1.  This time, I'll seed for you too.

As to some of the comments on here, I really like having to find the useful comments about quality, etc. amongst posts using homophobic language.  /sarcasm  Say what ever shit you like about the speed of the download, but keep the hate speech to yourself."
,neojh,2012-03-05T16:02Z,"thanks ettv , seeding at 100 KB/s !"
,Feraas,2012-03-05T16:42Z,just wanted to say thx to all the seeders....
,Feraas,2012-03-05T16:44Z,thanks ettv and to all the seeders....
,Cheddabuff,2012-03-05T16:44Z,"I wasn't going to seed but since lforis88, madmax1111 were such rude assholes..Im definitely going to now..anything I can do to help them out..brilliant strategy idiots..haha...stop complaining dumbass, and get a job."
,alvin0524,2012-03-05T16:48Z,thanks for the upload ettv. seeding at 300kbps. :D

,prosniper007,2012-03-06T04:22Z,DALE DIES
,TtToker,2012-03-06T05:04Z,"new strategy from the network, rather than saying its fake or password protected, they say Seed! followed by racist and other immature comments. so now to get back at the racist douche bags, these friendly folks that do seed will stop to get back at these ""douche bags"" that are really the people that are trying to get us all to stop sharing. and word to anybody that wants to see any tv show with no spoilers. Download it if it has a skull. don't read the comments unless you want to see these lifeless ass holes spoiling the show.
Great Episode Great quility, Thanks for the up.

and again to the people bitching at the lack of seeders. How many people do you expect to seed a show that was just released? before you finish downloading you're not considered a seeder either so it takes time for even a small amount of seeders to please you assholes. you cant be grateful for a free tv show because it took time to download it? then you want to bitch about it on here like somebody that has downloaded it will be coming back to see the comments and see that some asshole is begging for seeders so it'll remind somebody to seed? how pathetic can people get. I seed as much as I can. not for any of you, I seed for people like me. I do for others as I wish they would for me. so since I said that, I'd like to thank all of those that did seed for me. and a big fuck you to the impatient complaining crybabies that had to wait an extra 30 minutes to download this free torrent. "
,CDXX-420,2012-03-06T08:11Z,"is it just me, or did they remove the .torrent dl links? just magnets now...?"
,CDXX-420,2012-03-06T08:16Z,the way i see it... I at least try to get a 1.0 ratio on all my torrents dl'ed. in other words i upload a minimum of that of the file size dl'ed. 100mb dl ='s 100mb uploaded.(at least) Simple enough considering all the pointless bandwidth limiting by ISP's worldwide!
,amber_leaf,2012-03-12T19:00Z,"Excellent, thanks.

@prosniper007 - thanks for the spoiler shithead!"
