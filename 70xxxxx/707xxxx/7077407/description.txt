Jazz Boat is a comedy in which a would be cat burglar gets inadvertently involved with more serious small time thieves. Now it is notable for having an interesting cast and for being a great time capsule of the pop scene in London, England 1960. All the more curious in todays hindsight when that pop scene will witness a total transformation in the near future thanks to groups like The Beatles. Lovely Anne Aubrey had a brief career in the movies, 1957 to 1961 for some reason.

I added some items from about 1960 to the final mpeg2 file. Before the main feature are a Chevrolet then a Mum creme deodorant commercial followed by a trailer for L'Avventura. After Jazz Boat are a Gillette safety razor blade commercial, The Corvair in Action (5 minute short which is maybe the best car introduction ever) and a trailer for Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho.
