  RE:  No More XviD releases


Dear Retards,

Yes, MP4 is a more flexible format but they don't play on DivX DVD players. What inbred halfwit decided it had to be MP4 **INSTEAD** of XviD, uncle-dad?  

Oh, and thanks for dropping XviD right in the middle of the US network broadcast season.  That was very well thought out, too.

Sincerely,

A Former Fan
