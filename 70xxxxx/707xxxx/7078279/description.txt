Officially, "Apollo 17", launched December 17th, 1972 was the last manned mission to the moon. But a year later, in December of 1973, two American astronauts were sent on a secret mission to the moon funded by the US Department of Defence. What you are about to see is the actual footage which the astronauts captured on that mission. While NASA denies its authenticity, others say itΓÇÖs the real reason weΓÇÖve never gone back to the moon.
