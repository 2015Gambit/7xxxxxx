Street Fighter X Tekken RF XBOX360

Two of the greatest fighting game franchises of all time face off in the first of two cross over 
melee games that mix Street Fighter and Tekken characters.

Street Fighter x Tekken makes history as fighters from these two bastions of the fighting genre 
come together for the very first time. Utilizing the same 2D viewpoint and technology that 
powered Street Fighter IV, this game allows for Tekken characters such as Kazuya Mishima and Nina
Williams to make the transition into the Street Fighter universe having been re imagined using 
Capcoms much loved art style. Their looks may be different, but these characters have retained 
their own unique characteristics and signature moves as they go head to head with classic brawlers 
from the Street Fighter franchise in what promises to be an explosive match up.

Using the amazing Street Fighter IV engine, this game mixes 2D gameplay with fully realized 3D 
character models.

Fighters from Street Fighter and Tekken universes battle for domination in both new and familiar 
highly detailed environments that are brought to life with engaging animations.

In addition to modes such as Versus and Training that will feature new enhancements to make the 
fighting experience more in depth and enjoyable, Street Fighter X Tekken will include Tag Team 
combat where players select two fighters to deliver knockout assist attacks and special combos.
