I have a question I hope someone can answer for me. 
I have the HDMI cable to hook up my laptop to my tv. Someone awhile back, added a file that said how to use my laptop and still watch the movie. But I can't seem to find it now. Does anyone know how to do this? Thank you in advance.  My email is sgunner.sue@gmail.com"
