It's in Microsoft's .CHM format (a completely outdated ""e-book"" format based on compiled HTML).  For any Mac user, this is a COMPLETE waste of time simply because you have to scour the Internet to find a .CHM reader.

I went to Sourceforge, found a .CHM reader, and that's how I discovered the fact that this shithead above posted only a fucking IMAGE file.

Don't waste your time on this one, folks.  It's not what's advertised ... AT ALL.

Fucking asshole."
