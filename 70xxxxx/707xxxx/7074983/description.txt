A lion prince is born in Africa and is told by his father, King Mufasa, that when Mufasa dies, Simba will take over the throne, cheating his Uncle Scar out of becoming King of the Pride Lands. Scar, fueled by rage, plots to kill Mufasa and Simba so he is able to take over the throne. He and the hyenas team up and manage to push Mufasa to his death, but Simba survives, and, armed with misinformation, flees the Pride Lands. Simba, believing that his father's death was his own fault, decides to never return home; due to this decision, he meets Timone the Meerkat, and Pummba the Warthog, and the trio become fast friends. Simba stays with them well into adulthood until his childhood friend, Nala, tracks him down and begs him to return to the Pride Lands, where Scar has reigned as King for years, and ruined everything. All of the animals will starve to death if Simba does not return. Simba..
