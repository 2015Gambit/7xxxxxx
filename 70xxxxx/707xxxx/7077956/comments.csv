If it had been there at the time don't you think I would have?"

Correct me if I'm wrong... You are complaining because a file has much better picture quality, is smaller and will download faster than the three times bigger, lower quality, slower file you wanted?! Are you retarded or are you trying to compensate for something?"
,L4_M3N4C3,2012-03-05T06:30Z,"LOL is someone complaining about quality? its better than avi and smaller geez. 
guess people try to complain bout anything these days.. Ive downloaded and watched allready and it kicks the shit outta ur 170mb file size..
Thanks ETTV ur the greatest"
,BruinBear,2012-03-06T02:08Z,Not everybody watches these eps on their computer. I have stand-alone dvd players and portable players that will not reliably play these mp4's. I have had to stop using EZTV because they don't offer the AVI's anymore...at least ETTV still offers both. I say put the MP4 format up against the AVI and see the totals of which gets downloaded more. Then stop using the loser. You can then kiss MP4 goodbye. Not everyone is an apple tard.
