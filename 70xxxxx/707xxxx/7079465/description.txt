Being.Human.S04E05.PROPER.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 198MB]

[/b][/color] Have you ever heard the one about a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost living together? Well for George, Mitchell and Annie, that s no joke.
It s their life... or afterlife as the case may be.
The supernatural trio share a rented house, desperately trying to strike a balance between their paranormal problems and the domestic challenges that regular humans take for granted.
All in the hope of achieving the simple pleasure of Being Human.
By forcing themselves to assimilate into society, they hope to experience the joys and satisfaction of normality...
