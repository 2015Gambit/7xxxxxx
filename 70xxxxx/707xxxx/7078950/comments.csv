,randyy242,2012-07-06T02:10Z,"@ ryde-bmx this has 38 seeders and 6 leechers, it should be fine.

@ kyomashi1 this worked fine for me, seems to be virus free.

@yudimultiply seems to be virus free to me

@nuke1007 which loading screen are you stuck on?  Everything works fine for me but I did notice the loading to be a little bit slower (a friend had installed BO:P on my pc a while ago but he deleted it after he got his new pc); this version loads slower then the retail version... unless its just my pc getting old xP"
