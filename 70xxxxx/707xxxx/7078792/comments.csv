Sorry we weren't notified

Anyway audio crashes at 42:18, 30 secs before the episode ends... it's annoying ? Nop"
,lochnet,2012-03-06T00:44Z,the audio crash comes during the death of a main character and ruins the whole scene

Tv rips groups (in this case compulsion) sometimes are wrong, like all human. Instead of criticizing and talking about ruining should be thankful that someone rips tv-shows."
