The brief volume of the first thirty-six chapters focuses on Western (or classical) music, which includes the first six parts of LISTENING TO MUSIC, Sixth Edition.

"The listening guides are a decided strength and are masterfully conceived and executed."

"Strengths: 1. Wright has written with extreme clarity. He doesnÂ't waste words or indulge in scholarly "overkill. 2. He has done a good job of relating musical forms and styles to popular music forms. Of particular note are the examples of the Sting rondo and Elton JohnÂ's use of basso ostinato (would it be possible to have those pieces included on the CDs? I fear that I donÂ't own either of them). 3. The introductory CD contains the best examples of musical instruments, musical element and textures and forms that IÂ've ever heard."

"The new layout with more, shorter chapters is an improvement] in that it does break up the longer chapters; it presents less of an apparent obstacle for studentsÂ--which is excellent!"

"[for part openers with timelines] Good idea Â- with what is happening in the world at that time Â- so that the music is put into context for the students."

"[On LISTENING TO WESTERN MUSIC] Thank you for considering this. I teach an entirely separate course on non-Western music so I have no use for any of the world music contentÂ--also there simply isnÂ't time in 15 weeks to cover even all of the art music." --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
