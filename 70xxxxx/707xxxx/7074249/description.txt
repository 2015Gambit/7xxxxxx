"A Gifted Man" follows Michael Holt (Patrick Wilson), a brilliant and charismatic surgeon who, after his ex-wife, Anna, dies and starts to teach him the meaning of life. Thanks to his lucrative career as an exception doctor, Michel has lived the life of luxury and easiness. Michel's sister Christina (Julie Benz), a single mother to a teenaged son, Milo (Liam Aiken), is happy that Anna is back in her brother's life even though she is only an illusion. Michael was always a better person because of her. However, Rita (Margo Martindale) is concerned of Michael's sudden change in behavior.



Anna tells Michael to continue her work at the Free Clinic and there, Michael meets Autumn, a volunteer that continues Anna's legacy. Michael connects with her and realizes that he can do more than save the rich and famous. From producers Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich" ), Academy Award winner Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs" ) comes "A Gifted Man", a story of compassion and love in the medical field.
