,Uriz3n,2012-03-04T17:14Z,"Thanks. But I can't read stuff like that. Animal testing and cruelty and all. Call me a Wuss, but it hits too close to home. I do love my dog.

Anyway, MM, I was wondering if anyone in the gang has a complete collection of the ""Wheel of Time"" Comics, the comics for the Robert Jordan novels. I found some (New Spring 1-7; The Eye of the World 0, 1, 18), but I'd love to get all of them. Thanks."
