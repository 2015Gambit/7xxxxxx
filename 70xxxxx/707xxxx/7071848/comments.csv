(Bitcomet - error al cargar el archivo)

I have trouble downloading the torrent, any solution?

(Bitcomet - error loading the file)"
,sleeper31204,2012-03-06T03:48Z,"Hey, can someone please tell me they are having a better dl rate with ""utorrent"". I'm stuck dling at like .7, I don't think its my connection but I'm having a low rate on another file. OR. how can I dl using my vuze program? Thanks guys!"
,gevaarlik,2012-03-06T13:18Z,"Hey guys. When i click ""Get this torrent"" (magnetic link) thus message pops up saying ""external Protocol Request"". I accept it and it adds it to my torrent client (Bittorrent) but with no allocation of the size. however, once the downloading has started it tells me the size. This may be silly but will it affect the format of the movie or anything like that???

Appreciate the help"

no it does not, that's just how magnets work
magnets are being used these days because they are less trackable, and that delay probably has something to do with it, making it look like ur downloading it from Africa or something"

,ag_orange,2012-03-14T16:04Z,Excellent movie....movie is 10/10!
,QborT,2012-03-18T05:31Z,"Orchonic you are wrong, magnets are used because TPB doesn't want to host the torrent files.  It's just one more way for TPB bigwigs to keep themselves safe from the MAFIAA."
,slaneesh,2012-03-24T11:54Z,You need to update your utorrent client so it has the proper support for magnet links
