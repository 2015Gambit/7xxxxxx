,JohnnySp,2012-03-02T20:53Z,"Let me try and disspell some of the description.

Notes:

--No Crack yet, it will be tough for it to be out before March 9th (Not sure why)

--This file may be updated, if it is the file size won't change much as it'd be updated to include the crack which won't be a significant increase/decrease in size.

--This file, that does not include the crack, comes without the main EXE b/c you need the crack so including the main EXE does you no good.  When the crack is available you will want to place it in the BinariesWin32 folder.

--Apparently we may need a specific compression program, FreeArc to extract the files.  Also, it will take a large amount of RAM and you will want to ensure that most programs are shut down prior to extracting so that it does not cause a system hang.

--There is nothing ripped out of the files, other than the main EXE, the videos do work.  

I think that's the best way I can transcribe the original description.

FYI: The ""Globe"" on the end of this title if b/c of the uploader.  And, perhaps the Portable is because of the compressed file size."
,Netarangi,2012-03-02T20:53Z,"YOU STUPID FUCKS. THIS IS THE GAME. JUST RIPPED/REPACKED. THERE IS NO CRACK AND WON'T BE TILL AFTER THE RELEASE DATE.

,supernapalm,2012-03-02T21:09Z,"@Netarangi
RAWR!!!!!!!!!
In all seriousness, if that's the case and no crack until release then not much point me keeping what I've already downloaded. Only got it so I could play early...

On another note. The collectors edition has started popping up on private trackers. No I don't know where and no I don't have any invites"

,K.I.D.,2012-03-02T22:00Z,"Crack is gonna come on the 6th, 7th at most... once North American players unlock the game, the EXE will be available for the scene and p2p groups to work on."
,Sabrann,2012-03-02T22:29Z,"The idea here is obvious, download the game so when the crack is released you don't have to wait for GB's of data to download.  You'll be able to just download a crack which will be a few MB's and play."

[V],globeplus,2012-03-03T01:15Z,"Hi , this comment is to say that it looks like a multi7 language files for this game are now available for download but still the crack needed , i repeat that i will make an update once a working crack comes out for this file , with the crack and subtitles or maybe a dll , wherever can be the files not included on the iso that i used to make this work , i am convinced that somehow no matter it will be number of possible files for this update , probably not too much size as that , of course i make a note for the fact that if some dlc that can be addicionated to the game start to be available of course is up to the users get this dlcs because is well known that the iso that i used to make the work was only the main game with crack not available but of course still beeing at this moment in time a nice contribution , of course that really important is to play the game but for that we have to wait for the crack ... ok , this are the notes about this file and believe everyone that was hard work this pratical file that in my opinion is 99% of the main game but of course , the last 1% (the crack) is decisive to really play the game and all of us will be waiting for that soon as possible ... thank you for understand all the points of this game file and what it is important most of all is to give positive contributions to the site ... happy gaming to all of you when that will be possible of course ...

little note : in case of addicionate any new available dlc to this game file don´t forget to make a backup first first of the folder just in case of the download dlc origibate or not any inconvenience to the gameplay for some unknown reason ."

[V],globeplus,2012-03-03T14:47Z,"NEWS TO MY FELLOW USERS OF MY FILES :

After having a forum with more than 120 members closed suddenly without the opportunity to correct anything more than a year ago , i got my blog at the word.press
 with at that time close to 600.000 clicks in only one year or something closed suddenly too without giving me the chance to corrections beside my efforts , i decide after a few requests here and there analise the possibility of a new site and i decide to start step by step working in a new one in a new style and probably more complete than the extinct blog but with my corrent available time  still have at least a few weeks in front to be all the site ready to go , what i can do in a week time or something is to start the site with what it is possible and keep growing the site day by day in my hobby time until i get the all site ready ...

In this new site my archives finally have is own space with many old nice games worked with portability available by links easily to use , of course that having better net services help on the downloading doesn´t mean that the others with slower net services don´t have a shot on the downloads part by part of any available game or other general interesting things about gaming but not only that can be available , like i said before this site have in his own time all the intention to be more complete than any other site , blog ot forum that i had before ... we are all guys that like to pass the time positively on the computer doing things that we like to do to better pass our own free time and any available site that can possible increase the possibility of getting more options for downloads or general information can´t be bad ... see all of you around and i will tell something more about this subject on the next week , when i think that i have a minimum available conditions to start the site availability i will say something then i will keep new things coming to the site until reach the point that i think it will be ok to just keep going with the normal updating with new files or news or wherever , of course that my new files here in piratebay  will have there previligiated place on the site , to the users of the site knows what are my latest files or the work in a new file ... it will be fun i guess but of course lot of work in front ... happy files to all of you ."

@globe: was there any protection in the iso? and dude could you please make a GUI interface for  Precomp? It will make precomp a lot easier to use and comprehend....."

,rocky0412,2012-03-07T17:35Z,its not working!!! think the intro video replacement would fix it.... plz globe can u upload the intro videos from the demo!!!! and thnxxx
,Zoner87,2012-03-07T17:39Z,Ok; so it still crashes after the 1st mission; funnily AFTER playing the intro vid of the 2nd mission; so i guess i will have to download and replace all the movie files..
,the_Reaper534,2012-03-07T17:39Z,"Played the first mission you could also play in the demo. After a short scene which wasn't included in the demo my screen goes black and I just hear ""windy"" sounds."

,Zoner87,2012-03-07T18:46Z,"Yup; i guess the game isnt able to play the cutscenes; it does make wooshy noises, so the cutscene is locking up it seems..... ah well, my legit copy arrives on friday, so ill just wait for it lol..."

,Sabretou,2012-03-07T20:36Z,"@Zoner: Temporary measure, but have you tried removing/renaming the movie files causing the lock-up? A lot of games skip the movie if it isn't available."
,Nyacca,2012-03-07T20:37Z,@sdasfas everyone here has already got that lol because its the Reloaded crack... it does not fix the video problem before mars mission.
,Zoner87,2012-03-07T21:14Z,"@sabretou: Yup; tried removing the file, tried replacing it with another file that the game is able to play (renamed intro vid to tht file name); etc etc... game still locks up at the exact same place; so i guess the reason is a file size mismatch from the expected..!"
,georgegalily,2012-03-07T22:42Z,"I was thinking, Is it possible if you replace binkw32.dll ME3 original file (After backup) with other old game binkw32.dll like Batman Arkham Asylum to solve the problem.

,Angeirax,2012-03-07T23:14Z,"After the shuttle taking off a cutscene is supposed to play, not a video so the cutscene is the problem, I know because I watched gameplay videos on youtube and after that it plays the cutscene with shepard on the shuttle (?) with ashley/kaidan and james vega"

the upload will be appreciated. just upload it as torrent and seed well"
[V],globeplus,2012-03-08T00:11Z,"Hi guys , it happens a kind of madness on this videos of this game that i really didn´t expect at all , i tried a few work arounds and none worked beside the real video then i was for a more deep analysis of the videos and i didn´t like it what i found out , this bik videos have an unsual minimum of quality framerate , for example i can´t make the videos with less quality but i can impove even more ... sound strange ? it is the true , if i want to increase the size of the biks it is possible and that indicates no special numbers associated to the bik videos that only the main biks have or something , this is ununually about the video quality , it looks like that , i will keep analising them , who knows if i find more something interesting ... sorry for this but i getted surprised , this is reallu unsual for bik videos and i need to understand better this phenomen ... see you soon ... "
[V],globeplus,2012-03-08T00:39Z,"After more anlysis on the videos , i find out a wayto decrease close 0.5 mega for each 8 mb bik files , so if the file have 20 mega i can remove 1.somehing mega and so on ... well , i will keep more analysis ..."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-08T00:45Z,"Another curiosity : oi is really not about the resolution of the videos but the data rate , still 0.7 or 0.8 m off for each 10 maga of this bik videos maximum . See you around ."
,rocky0412,2012-03-08T05:03Z,@Globeplus;; mate I tried to convert the whole videos back to its whole size using RAD TOOL ...but still no luck... Wanted to know whether ur original copy is working fine with crack??? And if possible upload the whole movies folder so that we can also fix the movies..... 
,crysisftw,2012-03-08T05:11Z,"oh, globe!! still no workaround?? some say they cant play after the mars mission or something.. my game isn't even starting!! please fix this"
,earth3,2012-03-08T05:15Z,"@globe dude are you indirectly saying that this torrent is nuked?:(
so to fix we will have to dwnload videos ryt? then why dont you upload vids ASAP?"
,Zoner87,2012-03-08T05:51Z,"It seems it isnt a video problem but a cutscene problem; can someone get someone to upload all the cutsene files from the mars mission?? That might be the last fix that is needed since the game is playing the mars intro vid; so vids dont seem to be the prob anymore; cuteness, specifically the one in the shuttle before landing on mars, seems to be the problem, in anycase, im gonna get my retail dvd tomorrow, so if it isnt fixed by then i will upload those cutscene files for you guys ;) "
,Sabretou,2012-03-08T05:51Z,"Considering the time it's taking for you, globe, it might be better to get a working torrent and use your compression magic on it. Seriously, it'll be faster and it'll work."

,crysisftw,2012-03-08T06:51Z,"@zoner87: we would all appreciate if you could upload the video files once you receive your copy.. thanks! and hey, my game isn't even starting.. how come you got yours started?? i have i7-2600k, ati 5970 2gb, 4 gb ram.."
,earth3,2012-03-08T08:39Z,@crysis globe's update does nothing really you gotta replace it with vids from the demo i dont even have the demo man it is too large to dwnload all the big files:(
,Zoner87,2012-03-08T10:28Z,"@crysisftw: Replacing the intro videos by the original ones (i took em from the demo) allows the game to start, but it still crashes before mars... i will upload a torrent with the cutscene causing the crash and the original intro vids in a bit, though the game might just crash further on since we havent identified the root cause of the crash... yet."

USE IT IT WORKS PERFECT... NOW PLAYING MASS EFFECT 3 ....GLOBEPLUS VERSION .... IN ENGLISH...

,rocky0412,2012-03-09T16:18Z,"EXPLAIN 1....
 put fix.exe inside BIOGameMovies folder (yes, with .bik files) & run it. you need 4GB free disk space.
original recoded videos will stay as .bak you can remove "".bak"" part and get them back if needed.

EXPLAIN 2.
this builds the videos back to their original size. but not into exact original FORMAT... TO BE SIMPLE IT FAKES THE VIDEOS TO BE ORIGINAL ONE...."

,newmouse,2012-03-09T23:55Z," The vid_fix.exe is here : 
http://www.mediafire.com/?lg7nimmcmw084m7 

It resizes the Bink Files to around 4 times larger 
Put it in the Movies Folder & run. 
Only takes a very few minutes.
AND YES FOLKS IT DOES WORK !!!
(Exhausted small sob !) @@@"
,newmouse,2012-03-10T00:10Z,"I found the vid_fix.exe from user comments on the Black Box site. Black Box Rip has the same problem.
About 1/2 way down the comments 
http://blackboxrepack.com/mass-effect-3-black-box/ 

The 900MB total size Movies folder in this & Black Box Rips will be expanded to around 3.5 GB.
You can compress it with Windows inbuilt file compress feature back to 900MB Disc space.

I now have ME3 running with full English voice & Subtitles.

[V],globeplus,2012-03-10T00:30Z,"Thank you newmouse for your help but it is useful for an ununexpected situation like this when the bik videos needs a minimum data rate have something that can foul the data rate on the videos and probably that was obtained , i am totally shore about the stability during the gameplay but the general idea it is positive , i got a few more ideas based on this principle but it is clear that i can´t know the way that was done to create this fix because he can be used in a similar situation anyway but i got something else in mind but only understanding the way to create this fix to know if it was possible to do something or not ... well never mind and thank you for your cooperation and see you around and happy game ."
,newmouse,2012-03-10T01:19Z,Perhaps the easiest & best way would be to upload just the Movies files in larger size @@@

and as the black_box version has the same problem with there videos... they used this software too...."

How you get the code ? and thank you for the colaboration , by the way i upload the Stacking game for 1.05 gb , it is a funny graphic adventure game that have a nice athmosphere , only have a 5 minutes conversion work and that´s it to play with total portability around the computer , you canm launch the game wherever is the game folder ... see you and thanks and tell me please how you get the code ..."

[V],globeplus,2012-03-10T13:09Z,"To earth3 : ok , thank you , you got my pirate Globedektop v2 ? then don´t forget to go to the new rips website , it is close 90 gb in rips of nice old pc games , they are not recent but they are nice games and it is impossible that you played all of them , they are quick to get on te links and after a few months many oif this nice pc games , specially for rips , the files of them start not having too much help , so this is the way to get them easily , if you want a rip of an old pc game easily and by links for old pc games certainly more easy download 3 or 4 gb than 10 gb for example if was the aize of the original , it is positive concept and not too much options for rips sites available , use the site wherever you want specially in periods without too many new pc games then you pick up a nice old one and you have a game to play , why not ? i go to the facebook in some time , i already get the feeling of the code but the executable necessary to do the work have an obrigatory administartion rights that i am trying to understand how to bypass not requesting administartion rights after each video that it is worked ... see you ."
,earth3,2012-03-10T13:19Z,or you can google it
,earth3,2012-03-10T13:21Z,you wanna skip admin ryts? use a bat file like 1 i uploaded instead of exe thing
,georgegalily,2012-03-10T13:22Z,"I think if you use ""Sysinternals Process Explorer"" you can find the path to the executed batch file"
,earth3,2012-03-10T13:30Z,"@george dude why dwnloading a program when you can do it just by opening temp folder? and after these exe finish they usually delete the bat files so you need to be quick to kill the process
handling the program you suggested and win task manager may not be quick enough! anyway you can find file location using win taskmanager it self
so you see using taskmanager is more reliable!"
,earth3,2012-03-10T13:38Z,"@globe your piratedesktop should contain a start button and notifier icons so that we can replace taskbar otherwise after some time it becomes a irritating. if you put it in the bottom you wont be able to see it fully and left and ryt positon of a widesvreen is too small for it if you put it in the top it messes with my mozzila everytime i want to minimise it so the best thing to do is replace win taskbar with yours for that you gotta put the start button in it
your piratebar looks very cool so i would really want my taskbar away"
,earth3,2012-03-10T13:41Z,@globe have a look at this http://ss64.com/nt/delayedexpansion.html
[V],globeplus,2012-03-10T14:06Z,To earth3 : thanks for the help and i didn´t find messgaes from you on the Facebook but doesn´t matter about the GlobeDesktop do the next 2 things : 1 . create a shortcut in the quick launch bar for the executable and 2 - right click on a bown on the piratebay presentation then click Settings and finally reduce the Dock Size for wherever you want and you get all of them accessible with how many space you want on the desktop independtly of the desktop secreen size ... see you and i am still studing this code .
[V],globeplus,2012-03-10T14:22Z,"To earth3 : i tried the bat already for skip administration rights but the bat itsef don´t let execute as administrator and if you run as administrator with right mouse click the fsutil.exe that it is the program does really matter to increase the data rate don´t run properly because it is a utilitary program that onry execute with administartion rights then if click the administartor rights on the propertys of the excutable he will do the work but only 1 at the time you need to say yes to the administartion rights every single video that the utoilitary do the work , works but in borring way , the question is how the fsutil.exe execute 2 or more consecutive videos without beeing requesting administartive rights all the time ... cheers and many thanks for all the help ."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-10T14:32Z,"I want to tell to the generalty of the users that beeing hekping me is beeing helping yourselfs too because with that i can´t do more work and more faster and that it is great for everyone , i don´t too much to have the files available and the users get them soon as possible and in case of possible preoblems the things get resolved more easily so it is better for everyone , i don´t know everything and evry single thing that can help a little bit more on the work certainly it is positive , thank you all for understand and it is nice having great collaborators helping with what it is possible ... thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2012-03-10T14:36Z,"Correction to the before comment :

,earth3,2012-03-10T14:39Z,"well the bat file doesnt require admin rights i already checked that it works flawlessly
i think only the exe requires admin ryts
and i have no idea why fsutil will want admin ryts
it is just a win utility"
,earth3,2012-03-10T14:41Z,why did you run it as admin anyway?
[V],globeplus,2012-03-10T14:42Z,"To georgegalily : The Process Explorer is interesting and useful in certain circunstances but i can´t get the code from the exe with that , i still requesting to the earth3  how he get the code ...? Thank you for your suggestion ."

2) After converting run the ME3_GLOBE_Converter in BIOGAME folder
3)wait till it completes

4) now download and extract the COMPLETE UPDATE v2 GLOBE FILE(1)
5) it contains ;

Binaries
BIOGame
ME3+21Tr-LNG
GDFBinary_en_US.dll

6) first copy and paste(replace) the files in Binaries>Win32 files to the game folder.
7) Now copy and paste all the files in BIOGame>CookedPCConsole

8) now copy and paste the GDFBinary_en_US.dll to the MASSEFFECT3 folder(replace it)

9) now the big part in COMPLETE UPDATE v2 GLOBE FILE(1)>BIOGAME>MOVIES>Fix(Run twice) just copy it and paste it to MASSEFFECT3>MOVIES and U have to run it twice(run as administrator). It takes time so be patient.

After its done now U good to go.

BUG: in case ""No sound "" issue with the game just run the game directly from the game folder not from the shortcut.

I finished the game without a crash. If Ur antivirus says ""VIRUS"" in COMPLETE UPDATE v2 GLOBE FILE(1) it means that the ""Trainer"" is culprit, remember the this trainer is not created by globe. So just delete it, BTW the trainer is not working anyway.

Sorry globe my HDD is busted so unable to seed this time. U have done a great job. U inspires pirates like me lol.
