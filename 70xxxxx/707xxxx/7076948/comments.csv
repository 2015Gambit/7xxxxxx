dig deep"
,ninjakecil,2012-03-06T18:37Z,"Thanks slicknick610.
Btw, the first part's audio is off by -520ms, so the audio were faster than the video.
Anyone wants to sync their audio/video has to delay the audio by -520ms in the players that supports audio delay settings."
,slicknick610,2012-03-07T04:39Z,@ninjakecil I just noticed it too. I upgraded one computer to Handbrake 0.96 and it seems to cause a sync issue. I am trying to get 0.95 back and will post 480p part 1 and both 720p parts. I assumed the newer version would work fine but I guess not.
,ninjakecil,2012-03-07T06:19Z,"I extracted the audio to see what's cause the desync, and it was the audio. There's a silence of 520ms in it. To be precise, at 830ms from the beginning. Have a look at the screenshot:

I doubt going back to the old program would fix this if this problem is in the audio part. 
Just add a -520ms delay to the audio in the encoding program and it's all fixed. Or you could try to extract the audio from the original recorded show, and fix it."
,slicknick610,2012-03-07T12:23Z,@ninjakecil No going back to the old version will definitely fix the issue because I am going to redo the whole process with the older version. Which worked perfectly for months now.
,qbaqi,2012-03-09T05:02Z,"@slicknick610 As a California stuck in Egypt, I don't know what I would do without your uploads.  You make a life away from Piru, Glen Helen, Racetown395, Lake Elsinore and all of my other favorite SoCal tracks bearable:)  Paypal doesn't work over here.  Get a FAWRY account and I would gladly donate to the cause to keep your equipment up to date and the uploads coming.  Thanks a lot rider."
