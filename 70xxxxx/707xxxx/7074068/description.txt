Hot on the heels of his previous release, Rogero brings everyone his latest update Rogero
CFW v3.1. The main difference between this and the last release is the BSOD problem
certain PS3s were running into after downgrading should be all fixed up. This CFW is an
ideal candidate for those who have downgraded their consoles with a ProgSkeet or E3
Flasher device, but can be used by anyone with access to the 3.55 firmware on their
consoles.
