This is a German Parody with a Star Trek/Star Wars theme.

Captured from SBS with a simple capture card years ago. I give the Audio & video a 7+.
Note: This was captured slightly zoomed, so some of the original text is cut off, but the subtitles are not, you will not miss out on any info.

Audio    - German
Subtitles - English (Hard coded)

I'm only uploading this because this movie is so freaking hard to get hold of; if you have, or know of a better copy of this movie, please post a link here.

                              ENJOY.
