"Wacky Races, I mean Top Gear, returned with another three-way contest tonight as Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May donned driving goggles and tested the KTM X-Bow, Caterham R500 and Morgan Three Wheeler at Donnington Park racing circuit. Not the most dramatic central section to an episode, but refreshingly car-based compared to last season's antics which saw houses demolished by machines of war.

While this segment was bankable Top Gear fodder, more risky was Clarkson's decision to make light of his famous comments on the One Show. 'You're going to be shot in front of your family' he told James May, 'because apparently you can say that on television'. The broadcaster of course references Ofcom's recent ruling that the remarks he made about striking public sector workers were not inappropriate, a pretty sensible decision that Clarkson is clearly delighted by.

Elsewhere Alex James was the Star In A Reasonably Priced Car, unfortunately being given yet another platform on which to talk about cheese, and setting a decent but middling time of 45.2 that equaled Cameron Diaz on the leaderboard.

Clarkson also test drove some remarkable relics in the form of a Bentley powered by an aircraft engine and fire-spitting BMW in not the most memorable episode of Top Gear, but thoroughly watchable all the same."



Coming next week: Jeremy, Richard and James attempt to find out if they can go motor racing for less than it costs to play a round of golf. Slash and F1 driver Kimi Raikkonen aguest on the show this week taking to the track in Reasonably Priced Cars. Richard test drives the new BMW M5.
