,Raitatsu,2012-03-05T23:09Z,"-inspiron-, I've been on a downloading spree the last few days. I've downloaded almost all of your torrents because of it. I wanted to say thank you so much for being such a badass. Thanks for these awesome torrents mate. Fucking awesome quality. Couldn't ask for anything better. You are definitely on my top 5 list of favorite uploaders. Thanks mate."
,FileList1,2012-03-07T16:27Z,"I think 320 good quality mp3, is better than apple's low m4a (aac).
Please keep uploading good music in high quality mp3.
So can you upload this Unmixed version of ASOT 2012, in good 320kbps mp3 format?
Thank you for all your hard work. Cheers."
