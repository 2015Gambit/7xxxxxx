Heli Traffic 2009 is a Flight Simulator module that adds realistic AI helicopter traffic.

Flight Simulator has supported AI traffic for several years and versions now. While offering realistic fixed wing AI aircraft, Flight Simulator does not natively support AI helicopters. There are a few add-on AI helicopters available, but they all take off, fly and land like airplanes.
