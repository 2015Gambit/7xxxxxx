This is a reproduced torrent of Papakeno's PapaPop 83 - Saffron Audio.

I want to make it abundantly clear that I have not in any form, shape, or way, been involved in the compilation process of these collections - All of the "Blood, sweat and tears" are Papakenos and not mine. If you like the music, then pay your respects to the man here, don't thank me, thank Papakeno!

You should also check out the "ISOTOP" and the "synthORdie" Collections, created by _Wintermute_ and mrsynth - Very good music in similar style:

PS
I work abroad, therefore I will disappear and re-appear at intervals (usually away 6 weeks, home 6 weeks). So if I'm not seeding right now, just be patient, I will return so you can get it downloaded.
