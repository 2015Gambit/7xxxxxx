,scouts69,2012-03-05T08:57Z,"okay i think i fixed the problem with the how downloading shit. IF you are using VUZE open up VUZE then click ""tools"" then click ""Options"" and finally click ""Interface"" then at the very bottom of the list u will see a Reset button click that and ur problem should be fixed no need to try to update VUZE cuz im sure it is already up to date 4.7 so yea that should fix it. If you have a Mac i don't think will work think some steps are different but if u get confused just google it like I did and u should find a forum post talken about it  could have a updated post for Mac user's so yea hope this help's if it does then please pass this along to other movie's comment that u download to help everyone with this shit problem :)   "

,Rush,2012-03-06T05:14Z,"@charlietexas... uTorrent is currently a piece of shit ... just got perma-banned for exposing the bug in their current version.3.1.2 (all build extensions) 

If you have to use uTorrent dump the POS 3.1.2 and download this version 2.1.1 build 25302... it never shows errors and has the same bells and whistles as the current version....If you don't believe me go visit their forum and see admin pulling a huge fucking CYA......... fuck utorrent.and all the fucking lying admin and moderators... ready to switch to Vuse... 

Oh yeah thanks extremeZ......for the rip"

,deano7,2012-03-06T06:25Z,"I'm using uTorrent 3.1.2 and i'm not having any prob's with these magnet links... all i do is open uTorrent, click the ""Add Torrent from URL"" tab, right click the magnet link, copy the link address, paste it in the ""Add Torrent from URL"" box, click ""OK"", choose dl location, and Bob's your Uncle... for me it doesn't matter if there's nothing in the window... just click ""OK"" after you've chosen your dl location and later you can choose what or what not to dl... 

Thanx for the rip btw... "
,Rush,2012-03-06T06:55Z,"@deano7.... sorry bro, should have made it more clear, it's not about the magnet links it's the (files stuck in uTorrent cache and not writing to hdd/ssd) bug that is a huge issue to lots of users... but not all

I'ts mainly the way the staff at the forum treats it's  complaints... like were all stupid... I had to tell them to fuck off and have been giving them shitty reviews on download sites every since... lots of users are rolling on archived versions (2.1.1xxxxx)  for this issue.... just to give heads up if anyone has this problem... don't look for support from uTorrent... they're in complete denial

,radmanish,2012-03-06T08:24Z,"waiting for the sherlock holmes 2, any Idea extremezone coz the DVD realse is April ."
,deano7,2012-03-06T08:37Z,"@ Rush... no prob' mate... i mainly wanted to let people know how easy it is to use the magnet links... 

On an unrelated note, regarding MAX / MAXSPEEDS rips... i must of dl'd about 15 of them so far ( thanx again MAX ) but every one of them ( before i figured out how to fix the prob' ) stop all of a sudden at a certain point when played on all three of my DVD players... it's nothing to do with the blank DVD's, and obviously nothing to do with my DVD players, as they all stop suddenly at the same point on my thumb drives i plug in to my DVD players too... all MAX rips work fine on my PC though, but i dunno about you guys... i prefer to burn them to a DVD and watch 'em on my TV... 

Anyways, i haven't read anyone else mention this, but i'm sure there are others out there that have noticed this fault... so here's how to fix it...

Download VirtualDubMod... i use 1.9.11

Click ""File / Open DVD File"", click ""Video / Direct Stream Copy"" ( make sure ""Direct Stream Copy"" is checked in Audio too...) , click ""Home"" on your keyboard, press and hold down the ""Shift"" key on your keyboard, and while holding the shift key down click the slider at the start point of the movie on VirtualDubMod and drag the slider right to the end of the movie.
Release the Shift key then click ""End"" on your keyboard.
Then go to ""File"" then ""Save as AVI"".... Bob's your Uncle... ;-)"
,armchair.53,2012-03-06T09:32Z,"interesting that most comments so far concern the problem (in my case with bittorrent) that recently started and concerns the option of which files in a torrent to download.  The window where you could do that is now empty.  I still cannot figure out why this is happening.  There is a work around in that if you click on the file tab, you can then manually instruct files you don't want to be ""skipped"" but I still don't understand why this has happened.  I have goggled but have not found an answer.  Obviously in some cases, such as with subtittle files, you don't want to or need to download those.  Or sometimes with music albums, you only want 1 song.  Has anyone figured this out.  OH by the way... thanks again extremezone, you rock."
,deano7,2012-03-06T10:35Z,"@ armchair.53... like i said it doesn't matter ( for me anyways ) if the window is empty, as after you choose your dl location then click ""ok"", you can just choose what to not download once the files appear in uTorrent, or in you case, bittorrent, by right clicking them and choosing ""don't download""..."

,spifkitten99,2012-03-06T15:15Z,"Face it. Magnet links suck. I do like the idea, a lot, but the problem is that you can't see what files it contains, until it has already started downloading, and that's annoying, particularly when you don't want all of the files.

uTorrent is going down hill, with their stupid updates, not improving anything, but just breaking some things, while making other things annoying.

But seriously, nobody should need to google how to open magnet links in utorrent. When you click them, your browser should already give you the option of how to open them, and then simply open them with uTorrent. No more to it."

Seems to me that if you have problems with say, uTorrent then switch to BitTorrent. If you have problems with one crack, try a different one. Here is my favorite, if you can't figure it out and nobody wants to baby step you through the problem, open a browser, take your lazy ass to google and READ about some sh*t. "

A: 9 or 8, seemed to have too much... bass? I'm not an audio expert, but basically it was too low and rumbly, I had to adjust the equalizer on my T.V. so it was less like an earthquake, but other than that, great audio.
M: 8

Coming from a pro-wolf prospective (there is a controversy surrounding wolves, there is the anti's (being ranchers, hunters, faux conservationists, people who just hate wolves), the pro's (wolf lovers, environmentalists, conservationists), and the ones with no opinions or who are in between) there was a bit of propaganda (giant dire sized wolves, ""murdering"" and not eating, alpha myth (wolves live in families, not packs), and so on) but honestly, if wolves were less afraid of humans and really just more like humans in intelligence, emotions, and whatnot, I could really see them being like the wolves in this movie, therefore I feel it is realistic, and I really like how the whole movie in general is about life and death, not just survival but more like accepting death and how it hurts people and animals, it was truly amazing and I really appreciate it. 

***SPOILERS***

I was still cringing and correcting inaccuracies but I can still appreciate the movie, lol, I just hope people realize that the vast majority of the facts in the movie were purely fiction, the only ones I agreed with were looking them in the eye and standing your ground when you have your food and are protecting it, to not show fear towards them, and I forgot the other one. Wolves may defend their kill but they will not viciously attack you over it, the LAST thing you want to do in a wolf encounter is run for your life, even if the wolf is running at you, you walk away slowly and calmly, same with dogs be them feral or domestic, this is intimidating and confusing to them;, they typically weigh on average 60-100 lbs (male and female) and may seem large but IMO are rather small compared to what people make them out to be, it is their fur and odd anatomy that makes them appear large, but especially in this movie, they aren't that big; alpha's may challenge or intimidate a human but not in the way shown in the movie, they do have a territory range but no ""kill range"", they hunt away from the den but in no particular radius, in fact the further the better to keep other larger predators such as grizzly/bear away from the pups, and if you step into that range, they will not come after you, and they don't defend their dens, this is why den gassing and killing pups is so easy, I could just go on, lol. A lot of this can be debunked and if you are really interested in learning about wolves, Google is great.

P.S.: I know the movie isn't about the wolves, but I can't help it. The Wicker Man drove me crazy too, not only for the bad acting but changing a religion which is completely harmless into one that belongs in a psych ward..."
