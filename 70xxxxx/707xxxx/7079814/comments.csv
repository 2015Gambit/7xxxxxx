,Larssagen,2012-06-01T06:37Z,Nice upload RR-NE! But i do not think it is fully complete .. there should have been 23 episodes in that season not 13 
,Larssagen,2012-06-01T06:41Z,sry my mistake! you are right it's 13! :)
[V],rr-ne,2012-06-01T07:50Z,"I go by Wikipedia, so yeah. I stand by saying the season in progress is Season 06"
[T],iamgreat,2012-07-03T15:46Z,"RR-NE, 

I do thank you for your work here however Wikipedia has been corrected (mostly not by me). And this time it actually has a tru and reliable source for the information - the company that own truTV. According to Turner Broadcasting season 6 starts on 10 July 2012, which means this is only HALF of season 5. Sorry for being a bringer of bad news but i thought better to know than to not know. Maybe title the next compilation Season 5 Part 2. 

And on another note, in case you haven't seen it already, i have put up a torrent of the two pilot episodes. It is labelled Season 00. I still can't believe the guy's explanation for why he bit a co-worker. "
[V],rr-ne,2012-07-05T06:25Z,"I noticed wikipedia has changed it, I'll get back to it sometime"
,Nightgun,2012-07-30T07:34Z,"""Thanks"" for all 5 Seasons of Hardcore Pawn ! 
going to get Pawn Stars soon :D

Also Great Torrent ! :D"
[V],rr-ne,2012-07-30T08:51Z,"@ NightGun --- this is not complete season 05, i thought it was because TruTV took a few weeks off and added 12-13 eps to season 5, you can find season 5 eps other eps on TPB too"
,lust2dust,2012-08-17T02:50Z,Hey Thanks - awesome quality 
,spacemancalvin,2012-08-26T00:36Z,"k this clearly isnt complete, half the fucking season is missing, fuck this shitty upload"
[V],rr-ne,2012-08-26T03:18Z,"@spacemancalvin

Yeah, this isn't 'complete', but its still the first half of season 05!

If it isn't good enough for you, then don't download it.

Otherwise, search through TPB and the rest of the internet and find the other eps, like i had to.

use YOUR time."
[V],rr-ne,2012-08-26T03:20Z,"As you can see, i uploaded this way before season 5, eps 14-26 even started airing. I wasn't aware of season 05 being continued. I would appreciate it if you would accept it as a 'mistake' and not be so rude about it. Thanks!"
