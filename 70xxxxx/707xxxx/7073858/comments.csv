x264 is an AVC codec which IS supported by the PS3, X360, Apple devices, and gradually more stand alone players.  If this doesn't play on your PS3, take your PS3 back as it is defective.  If you see an x264 .mp4 release from me, I tested it on the PS3 before releasing.

*almost* any x264 .mkv file you get can be made PS3 ready with Avidemux (freeware, google it).  Drag & drop the .mkv video in, answer the questions about frames and indexing (yes or no hasn't seemed to make much difference for me), set the video and audio tracks to copy, the format to mp4, and save.  Done in a moment and plays on PS3.
The only time extra work is required is if the audio track of the mkv is DTS. That needs to be converted to 6ch AC3.  Need pictures to guide you along?  Go here: http://kat.ph/blog/trialNerror/post/579/

If psspss wants to try to convert every x264 release to it's ancestral counterpart XviD, that's up to him... but I am not going to stop using x264 since it's a FAR superior compressor.  I can have something done with x264 in a much more timely manner compared to XviD, look just as good as the XviD would (maybe a little better in some scenes) and a smaller file size.  Why would anyone not use x264?!"
[V],psspss,2012-03-04T01:30Z,"yet funny how 100s to 1000s some even 5000
download the xvid convert still even days
or hours after all the mkv and mp4s are up
tells you something that supply verse demand
is still there

the only people I know that like mkv and mp4 are
room size tv screens

rest of us just copy xvids on keydiscs and play them on our 1-2 year old gear on a big screen
with upscaling and is extremely good

the only problem I have with some mp4s is
they increased the MB sizes and use VBR
so cant convert them without syncing issues
most of the time.

im sure in time as ISP data gets bigger and cheaper
and my laptops play them ok I prob switch but for
now xvids for me and I only shared my converts
as people ask for them. I do the work for myself
and dont have the cash to blow on data after all"
[V],psspss,2012-03-04T01:32Z,"ps I used avidemux it still out of audio sync converting to xvid.. in the end i used super converter
and had to use Mencoder and ffpmeg went way of out
sync.. Im not sure but its only your converts to mp4
that I have issue with.."
[T],trialNerror,2012-03-04T05:53Z,"What's even more hilarious is 100, 1000, and even 5000 people is not enough of a ""demand"" for me to revert back to XviD.  Not when 50000 to 100000 people are just dandy happy with the 480p/720p x264.

Frankly, as I see it, you're holding people back from advancing to a better change by releasing a shitty old XviD version.  Especially when many, many, many residents have a PS3 or X360 which fully supports the x264 AVC codec.  If they are too damn dumb to realize they already have a x264 player, that's not my problem.  If they have only a couple year old equipment to play XviD then they are WAY behind times and again that's not my problem.  I've had XviD DVD players for almost a decade now.  10 years dammit!  That's OLD in technology terms.  Ever since I got a PS3 a few years ago that XviD DVD player just collects dust because of the AVC playback support on the PS3.

I also learned over my time of uploading shit that people are VERY demanding, psspss, and when you start feeding them one thing they're gonna want more, more, and more, and you yourself alone trying to convert all the popular series from x264 to XviD is way too much for one person.  You shouldn't do that.  You should tell them all piss off and it's the way things are now.  The people can either get with the times or learn to convert shit themselves instead of relying on someone else to do it.  Instructional guides are all over the internet.  Imagine that. Real useful information on the internet.  It's not just all about free shit to download, shopping, and porn; there's valuable information on it, too.

Also one more thing that's been rattling around in my head is If I remember correctly you said something about .mkv's stuttering and lagging on your laptop...?  Didn't you also say you have an i7 laptop?  Like... an i7 processor?  If this is true then there's absolutely no reason any stutter or lag happens during playback on a system with i7 power in it.  I'm on a desktop with a processor not even half as powerful as i7 and it plays 1080p vids fine if that's the only thing running. If you are having that issue then it's something with your codecs or video card, not the x264 codec or mkv container.


p/s: I was referring to Avidemux for making mkv into PS3/X360 ready mp4.  Fuck converting to XviD.

As a matter of fact I'm gonna say it now and I don't care if it makes a bunch of people stop downloading from me...
Fuck you fucking whinos always demanding and bitching.  You want something go get it yourself.  I'm not here to please your every goddamn need. I'm here to provide access to decent quality videos that some people can't get in their country or to other people that are just too fucking Jewish to pay for a cable/satellite service in this country.

Hey how about this... I just stop.  No more releases whatsoever from tNe.  How would that go down?  Then were would you get your Ghost Adventures or Drinking Made Easy or Disappeared or whatever other series I might end up doing since the scene teams aren't.

Fuck y'all."
,compccs,2012-03-04T14:57Z,ive been around for a while now and i fully agree with tne and am glad to see that the scene has agreed as well doing sd rips with x264 ... as far as container mp4 is nice coz itll play right out of the gate on most players like a ps3 but even mkvs all you gotta do is toss them in a prog and litterally seconds later and its viewable.. i use mkv2vob but to each their own.. same outcome.. so tne keep on keepin on and for the people bitching just move on... and tne just for your own info my cable providor doesnt have syfyhd for my gh and ghi fixes and no travelhd for my ga so tons of thanks for the 720s... couldnt say it enough i know what it takes to do these use to do music vidz back in the day and yea its time consuming especially when its gratis... so muchas gracias and thanks for educating :P ... PEACE!
[V],psspss,2012-03-04T15:02Z,"lol oh geeh your sound like hollywood now

I do it for me not requests.. and all my local friends except 1 like xvids thats thats the reason
if I have it i share
its not cos we dont have cable just we dont live in usa/uk etc to get it
i7 plays them fine as long as dont fast forward
then sound vanishes for a minute in vlc
I know mplayerc prob does it fine and kmp but
i use them as last resort over vlc any I like
the files to be playable on other devices. xvids
works on everything.. think Ive stated this many times.. defending my point and reasons

i cant see whats wrong with making stuff available
in xvid first then release a mp4 even if mp4 is just
720p thats what most want in formats and sizes

you fail to see also people are glad you provide in any format someone has to fill in when the sceners fail to provide

i dont get the issues here
