Notes -

Well 1st off this is made up of several dif cams... took the P76 file and made 35 individual cuts to it to 
crop, resize, rotate and perspectives it.. then adjusted RGB, brightness, contrast, levels and everything
else individually then appended all my pieces back together and then synced and muxed INSPiRALs CAM audio 
to my encode... enjoy
