Based on it being cam and trialer mixed i rate it..  A-6.5____V-8____M-8    the audio is low because i think it may still be the original cammeras audio version and probably not much can be done to adjust..   But a decent tv and you can tweek your own trebble and base!!! :)

thanks Froggie for the upload :)"
