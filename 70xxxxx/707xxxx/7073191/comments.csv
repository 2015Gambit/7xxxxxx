,ReleasePT,2012-03-03T20:04Z,How do I update Jeppview? Thanks.
,JWRBlack,2012-03-03T20:39Z,Not a regular update. No Windows .exe included. Seems to be for Apple only.
,glounk,2012-03-04T00:54Z,it is not for PC'S :-( .
,iflyg,2012-03-04T01:26Z,"Hi all.
Thank you for the upload, yet it would be great to mention that it is not for Windows, would have saved so much time both for us working on a PC and all who use the ipad....
Can someone upload for PC???
also, can someone upload the North Atlantic manual?

Thanks a lot"

No way to update your PCs programm with this file."
,icepilots,2012-03-04T03:59Z,"Works on the iPad perfectly.

Not sure how FliteMap / FliteStar updates will be done these days - as the old trick of renaming CD2 doesn't work with the new update DVDs.

Am still hoping someone manages to figure it out - as I love tinkering with FliteMap!"
,JAB69,2012-03-04T09:22Z,"It seems we are two teams now, 
1. The ones who only need update for the iPad (FD/TC)
2. The ones who need update for PC (Flitestar)

This is a challenge for the uploaders, 
Personally i think the way it has been done so far, with the PC version (2x image files) and codes have been great, as it works good on borth platform with less effort from the uploaders. Just uploading an update for the iPad leaves ther Flitestar users out. 

Keep up the good work guys and thanks for all the great uploads !!!"
