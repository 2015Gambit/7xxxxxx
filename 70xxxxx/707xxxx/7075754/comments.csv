@Hethyc Go to C:Users(your pc name)AppDataRoamingutorrent (if you use utorrent, otherwise I don't know how to do this...) there you can fond all the torrents that you opened with utorrent. incluinding the ones with did using magnet links. Then cancel the magnet link download and start again using the torrent file ;)"
,Hethyc,2012-03-05T06:36Z,@zed1234: Thing is that there isn't torrent file of this episode in my roaming only those that I've downloaded before. When I click on magnet link it opens uTorrent and there's nothing to download...
