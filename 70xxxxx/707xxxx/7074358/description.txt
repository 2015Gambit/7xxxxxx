Pee-Wee loves Dolly more than anything else in the world. Too bad she's a doll. But Pee-Wee doesn't want to admit it. To him she's as real as the bowtie around his neck, much to the chagrin of sex worker Lizzy, who longs for Pee-Wee as much as Pee-Wee lusts for Dolly. When Dolly is stolen by a mysterious bandit, Pee-Wee goes on a wild, madcap recovery mission, complete with ghost truckers, gangbanging bikers, and a porno director named Chorkle...only to find Dolly as a prop on a Lizzy porn set! Will Lizzy finally consummate her love for Pee-Wee? Is Pee-Wee really over Dolly? Will you bust a nut over the crazed 4-way interracial ass fuck, or Capri Anderson's awesome body? Hit play (as in playhouse) and find out.
