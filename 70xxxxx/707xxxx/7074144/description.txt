Documentary about how a much-derided music actually changed the world. Between 1969 and 1979 
disco soundtracked gay liberation, foregrounded female desire in the age of feminism and led 
to the birth of modern club culture as we know it today, before taking the world by storm. 
With contributions from Nile Rogers, Robin Gibb, Kathy Sledge and Ian Schrager..
