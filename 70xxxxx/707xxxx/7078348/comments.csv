lex Jones and Infowars appear to be in damage control as damning information linking Alex Jones to the Israeli intelligence firm STRATFOR is spreading virally around the internet

On February 16, 2012, Truther published a breaking news story entitled “Alex Jones Cancels Speaking Tour 3 Days After Exposure As Possible STRATFOR Double Agent“. The article detailed the obvious and striking similarities between Alex Jones‘ Infowars and the Zionist intelligence agency entitled STRATFOR.

A few weeks later on February 29, 2012, the story regarding Jones and STRATFOR began to go viral on the web. At the time of publishing, there were over 3,000 blogs and websites posting the original story.

The chain of events which have transpired in the last 72 hours are quite shocking and may lead to the downfall of Alex Jones, Infowars, and STRATFOR.

The Bogus Infowars News Story 
On February 29, 2012, the exact same day the story regarding Jones and STRATFOR became and internet sensation, Alex Jones and Infowars released a new news story, with the words “STRATFOR” and “Israel” in the title of the story. The only problem with the Infowars story was that it was old news from November 13, 2011, packaged as new news for February 29, 2012.

The bogus Infowars news article was a calculated move by Alex Jones and his Infowars crew to muddy the waters in regards to the information linking Jones to STRATFOR. By creating a bogus news story with two key search terms in the headline, people searching online for information regarding Jones and STRATFOR would be led astray.

The bogus story by Infowars is now being carried by hundreds if not thousands of alternative news websites. Although the pathetic attempt by Jones did not work, as evidenced by the 3,000 plus websites currently carrying the Jones STRATFOR story, the fact that Alex Jones and Infowars published a bogus story shows they are in fact trying to block the story...."
