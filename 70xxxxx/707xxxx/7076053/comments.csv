[V],gnv65,2012-03-05T18:25Z,I have found that AVG is notorious for reporting Win-Heur which is very rarely reported by other antiviruses!
,hallyp,2012-03-06T04:27Z,I just told you what AVG told me. I put the comment here to inform others what happened and to find out if anyone else encountered the same problem. That's all.
,hallyp,2012-03-06T05:12Z,"Ah, gnv65, your comment about AVG misreporting viruses rings a bell. Couple of years ago AVG kept repeatedly finding some virus (don't remember the name of it any more) on my computer, but it was nothing but a bug in AVG itself. The problem disappeared when I updated AVG. "
