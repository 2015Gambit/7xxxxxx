,Kadian04,2012-03-05T23:37Z,Covertly I could really use a hand with the language issue.

,NakanoSan,2012-03-06T00:11Z,"I'll be damned. It does work.

If you need it to work, check page 2. Too lazy? Download the Multi7 language fix here, go to BIOGame/CookedPCConsole, delete/rename BIOGame_RUS.tlk to something else, then rename BIOGame_INT.tlk to BIOGame_RUS.tlk

You'll launch the game in English, but you'll get an error ""Unable to Authorize DLC"" with the DLC names in Russian. Wait for the full US release tomorrow."
,Dufox,2012-03-06T00:16Z,"by the time the comments fix themselves someone will have posted the fix link.

,obiwanoskar,2012-03-06T07:36Z,"It would seem that even with the crack I can't get this game to work :(. It just comes up that the process has stopped working. 

I have put the crack in binaries/win32 but to no avail. Anyone got a clue of what the problem might be? Im using a 64bit OS. 

Thank you!"
