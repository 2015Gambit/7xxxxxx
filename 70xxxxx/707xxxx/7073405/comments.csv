,ndim22,2012-03-03T19:10Z,Worked fine for me. Thanks!
[T],zerothdegree,2012-03-03T20:24Z,yeah this forced over to magnets thing is pretty lame. I don't want to upgrade my torrent downloader client. It looks and works how I like it. I don't want all this extra shit and lack of control over my downloads. although I got it to work with out upgrading. just unnecessary extra steps and a longer wait time to start downloading.  Don't really see the benefit of these magnets for anyone.. 
,JRaiden,2012-03-04T12:47Z,"Magnet links benefit sites like TPB, not users. Can't believe they're giving users severe problems (and that TPB is linking/advertising uTorrent).."
,Varfe,2012-03-07T23:20Z,Yeah god forbid this site that gives you FREE anything-you-want should change to something that helps insure it stays around for longer...
,TPBManzanar,2012-03-23T23:14Z,I'm all butthurt cause I dont wanna upgrade my client!  waaah!
