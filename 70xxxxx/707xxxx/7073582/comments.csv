,mordor2003,2012-03-03T10:06Z,Anybody plz tell me why am I only getting magnet link and not the other download torrent option for last 2 to 3 days on tpb
,][V][,2012-03-03T10:44Z,"Hello YIFY Group, Thank you guys so much for the grate jobs you doing, i have been downloading your rips for very long time and all of them perfect with one smal problem and that is for some reason the sound level seems to be low, i have to turn the volum around 40-45 in order to get a normal level lets say 10-15 other than that , everything is just wonderfull, i see you guys expanding now to SBS too which is grate, i was wondring if you guys will consider an other form of expation too, i will be more than happy to help you with 60fps if intrested, youcan get intouch with me for the details: 6871920@gmail.com
for my other friend who is missing the torrent link, i have been having the same problem in the past week too, i think its piretbay server problem, i personaly work around it like this: find my YIFY torrent, go to the page, copy the HASH code on top of the page, search it on the net and start downloading it from an other torrent site like kickass ( it will be the exact same copy of YIFY) untill hopfully the piretbay fixes this problem."
,saydonsay,2012-03-03T11:11Z,"where is the ""GET TORRENT FILE option"" to download a movie?"
,monkey16,2012-03-03T13:38Z,Why you no longer see the 'Get Torrent File' option - http://thepiratebay.se/blog
,monkey16,2012-03-03T13:39Z,"Thanks YIFY! 
Is there a 1080p rip coming up for this?"
,Gacy8Gein,2012-03-03T13:40Z,"There won't be anymore ""Get Torrent File"" links here anymore.
Just the Magnet link, which should work just fine, if your Torrent Downloader is up to date.
It has been done for a reason, as is the fact the site is only .SE now."
,psynr,2012-03-03T16:40Z,"sitter 2011 movie plz yify :) 
thanks a lot:)"
,Lou-Khan,2012-03-03T17:59Z,"Yeah PB is encouraging Magnet links and other new technologies (well not new, but newer than bittorent), which is good, we only need to bear with the short period of adaptation...
And I've seen other uploads with the .torrent link, I guess that depends on the preferences of the uploader...
BTW so many leechers on this torrent, so slow..."
,Revraiser,2012-03-03T21:31Z,"hey guys, ive download the latest utoorent but i have not since been able to download any moives as theiris no links still. Can anyone tell me how to find a proper link now ?"
,.Leto.,2012-03-04T02:52Z,"seriously, 2h38 in less than 1GB??
what's the point doing a bluray rip if it's to ruin the quality and the movie??
all that because you're too cheap or too stupid to buy a decent size hard drive.
this kind of crap has nothing to do in the Highres category.

,soletar,2012-03-04T04:34Z,"03-03.... a very special day for me, extra special torrent for me as well. This film is one of my most anticipated!. Pls every1 pay no attention to the previous poster, he is off his meds"
,mpheus,2012-03-04T06:07Z,"@.Leto. - Shut up man! Not everyone has 10Mbit or higher connection. Also some have very small bandwidth cap so this is perfect for them. I have been downloading most of the movies from YIFY and all of them are perfect rip. Start ripping yourself if you cannot appreciate other's work.

@YIFY: Awesome job mate! "
,swiftE,2012-03-04T07:01Z,YIFY your awesome
,aP1LGR1M,2012-03-04T09:56Z,"@YIFY...buddy..if there was an award for the best ripper (i'm not too familiar with the terminology of TPB but i'm guessing thats's what they call folks who put stuff up for downloading) here u'd be nominated..and if i was on the jury u'd win it..!
:-)
Good job...like always !"
,painkilleradnan,2012-03-04T22:57Z,.thanks YIFY....waited 4 ur upload...:)

,saydonsay,2012-03-05T16:52Z,"@ Revraiser

We have the same problem..until now I cannot download a movie..I do everything but still I cannot..I felt disappointed on this new TPB.se...

To all YIFY team could you help us..Thanks in many"
,leodelacruzx,2012-03-05T22:49Z,Thank you Yifi! :)
,aP1LGR1M,2012-03-06T01:01Z,"Cinevia is being a bitch yet again - blocking the audio in PS3 - the way around is a pain in the ass, need to move the date an yr forward every time the audio gets muted. Anyone aware of other more robust workable solutions to bypass Cinevia?
A/V is a 10.
@saydonsay i'm on BitTorrent 7.2.1 - works great. Hit ""launch application"" on the pop up  after you click on ""GET THIS TORRENT""."

I apologise for my bad english."
,7201080,2012-03-10T16:55Z,"@.Leto , your a tool  , shut up ,  please learn how to encode with h264 before commenting  .. 

Ive been encoding for over 10 years (divx3 onwards , xvid , im even fluent in Flask Mpeg etc .  mkv/h264 is amazing , if you set it well )

AWESOME WORK YIFY the video quality is exellent 

the movie isn't high motion , h264 only animates what it needs
therefore 952.19 mb @ 2hrs 38 is perfect ( about 450kb/s )
DVD and BLURAY waste so much space as they play frame by frame at CBR which isn't needed
( they were created for ease of use ( Buy and Play / No Brainer / For the cattle  ) 

if it were an Action movie with high detail like Lord of the rings then it would be about 1.2-1.3gig

BLADE.."
