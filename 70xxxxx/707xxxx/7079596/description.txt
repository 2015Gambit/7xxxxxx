OK.

THIS IS NOT A MASS EFFECT 3 CRACK. Shall I repeat it again?

So what I did was I logged on to a Hong Kong proxy, passed through the release date check and now my MassEffect3.exe launches with Origin and there's no getting past that on our pirated copies. (It's also 21.3 MB and that's normal)

So if the crack groups haven't gotten their hands on this yet then HERE YA GO!
