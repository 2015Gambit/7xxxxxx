,Matterman,2012-03-05T20:24Z,"@azx555 Nah, they probably figured this out way faster than me. But hey if you actually bought the game I think you could play it with this."

,Lockrendan,2012-03-05T20:45Z,"I guess if you bought the game then this would work fine and you wouldn't have to go through the trouble of setting up a Korean or Indonesian VPN, but the main reason I want a crack is to avoid that Origin shit."
,Azula,2012-03-05T20:46Z,"Who knows, what the F is with skidrow site?.. Is there any possibility EA keeping it down?.. Is this always happens before crack release?.. I just can't wait any! Longer!"
,dlux69,2012-03-05T20:47Z,"@LexLuth0r

no"
,Matterman,2012-03-05T20:47Z,"Sorry for my crappy description everyone but what this lets you do:
-if you have a pirated copy, this will boot up Origin and ask you for a VALID SERIAL (and it's through EA so no keygen will work) -> STILL WAITING FOR A CRACK
-if you actually bought the game, maybe this will let you play the game, I don't know I didn't buy it."
,godziothc,2012-03-05T20:48Z,"@LexLuth0r

no, its an unlocked version of the exe (the one that ""knows"" its past the release date already as games do not use our system date&time to determine that). what the other guy did is just a forced offline mode (just like disconnecting your ethernet cable)

No working crack atm"

,Netarangi,2012-03-05T21:17Z,"@swebarb this is what you need when you crack it you fuckin retard. a cracker could get this and crack it. origin games only need the .exe, not any .dll files. get a brain faggot"
,Jessy_xoxo,2012-03-05T21:19Z,"Sigh, Skidrow promised a crack ""in a few hours"" 8 hours ago and they've been offline ever since. Maybe they got DDOS'd by a rival group or EA"
,Doomtrigger1,2012-03-05T21:24Z,SKIDROW DOES NOT HAVE A WEBSITE
,Jessy_xoxo,2012-03-05T21:26Z,"guys:

Unfortunatelly, we have been receiving 10gbps+ DDoS attacks which caused downtime/packet loss to both us and our network provider. Nodes will be migrated within 4 hours from now to our own hardware. Sorry for any inconvenience this has caused you and we hope you can bear with us.

Regarding Mass Effect 3- New update along with N7 content will be available in few hours. Crack will be available soon! We'll keep you updated."
,Jessy_xoxo,2012-03-05T21:30Z,"afaik no, sorry"

,Insomneac,2012-03-05T23:37Z,"To all the dumb noobs who are a waste of oxygen:

SKIDROW DOESN'T HAVE A FUCKING WEBSITE.

It's fake, and makes money from idiots like you and advertisements.

It would be great if all the idiots on the Internet took up another hobby, like running across busy freeways."
