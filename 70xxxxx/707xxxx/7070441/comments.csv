Most people might want or need a couple manuals but who's going to need hundreds or thousands? Does anybody want to download this archive file for one or two manuals. Probably not.

Hopefully some kind person who actually does download this will re-upload with the contents not packed at all."
,galaxist,2012-03-02T02:56Z,"I totally recommend to pack files, I also use 7z, which I think itÂ´s an excellent format. But the best itÂ´s to compress each file individually. Thanks, I will take a look. ,)"
,Zlombie,2012-03-02T18:53Z,"Sorry for packing the whole collection to one big 7zip file. I used to keep my collection online on few services, unfortunately they all ""died""(you know what I mean). So, in order to keep collection online, i decided to seed everything until it's online. After that, everybodu shoud use all these files as one whish, seed them separately. That's the reason, i just wanted to preserve everything so i packed it. I have very slow connection, maximum 30kB/s upload and it's unclear if i'll be able to seed this collection later becouse i won't be able to pay for Internet acces (i live in very bad conditions). So, please be patient and download this collection, unpack and seed seed seed as much as you whish and what you whish. Spent few years collecting this and i simply want to make it available for everyone who needs it. First download whil take a while, few day at least. Pleas be patient and dpn't forget to seed. 

All i want is to preserve all those manuals and books FREE for everyone-"
,raindr0ps,2012-03-04T03:40Z,"Sorry, JAQUEBAUER,
You are wrong. Sure with magnet link you get the whole torrent but can within you client select the files you want, IF the files are not packed in an archive (rar, zip, 7z, etc). In that case you have to download the entire archive to get the few files you want. That is the problem. This requires increased bandwidth on EACH users part for no reason. Why cause increased traffic on the internet for files you will only delete? I have yet to see any reasonable explanation why one would archive files unless he wants to include spam or malware or has a huge text file that needs compression to reduce bandwidth and increase download speed.
