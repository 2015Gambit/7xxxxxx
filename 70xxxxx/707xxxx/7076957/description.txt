Strapped for cash as ever Del is clearing Grandad's allotment
which has become a health hazard and where he finds some bottles
of yellow liquid,which he dumps. He also finds a tap,hidden by
rocks, but claims that there is an actual spring,yielding
'Peckham Spring Water'. Using a bottle of mineral water for the
lab test he gets the water accepted and sold to a supermarket
chain. Unfortunately he is unaware that it has been contaminated
by the same yellow liquid he chucked in the reservoir and, as he
turns out the light, the water starts to glow green.
