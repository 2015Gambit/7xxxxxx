,TheHFH,2012-03-05T23:59Z,"To change the Language to english Delete: BIOGame_RUS.tlk from 
Mass Effect 3BIOGameCookedPCConsole and then rename BIOGame_INT.tlk to BIOGame_RUS.tlk.

Then change GDFBinary_en_US.dll to GDFBinary_ru_RU.dll in the Mass Effect 3 folder."
,wmd23,2012-03-06T00:01Z,Confirmed as working. Any language issues are down to your copy of the game.
,Jellymanisme,2012-03-06T00:09Z,"Step 1: If you haven't already, get the language files from here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7072758/Mass_Effect_3_Multi7_(Language_subtitles) Follow installation instructions!

Step 2: Go into your installation folder and go to BIOgame, go to cookedpcconsole. Now find the language files. They are .tlk files, labeled like BIOGAME_(insert language name here).tlk.

Step 3: Now you see the BIOGAME_Rus.tlk file right? Drag it to your desktop.

Step 4: Find the language file you want, For example, I chose BIOGAME_Int.tlk for English. Now rename the tlk file to BIOGAME_RUS.tlk EXACTLY. Make sure NOT to change the file format, just the title. BIOGAME_RUS.tlk CASE SENSITIVE OKAY?!

Step 5. Ok your done. PLEASE COPY AND PASTE. Lots of people are probably frustrated with this as I was. THANK YOU :D"

,Sivos,2012-03-06T00:18Z,"I'm currently downloading the game and, according to comments on this and that torrent, it's working.  So, my question is, for those who tried it, can you import your ME1 and ME2 character into this game successfully?  If it's complicated, please put in a step by step guide, but if it's an obvious button clicking then never mind about the guide.  I'm just curious if pirating the game will effect that even if they are both already pirated.  Thanks."

,tekproxy,2012-03-06T01:15Z,My previous comment was deleted? It looks like the crack works. You gotta change some files mentioned previously. But my question is HOW DO YOU GET ME2 import to work? None of my saves are showing up and I have them copied EVERYWHERE.

,Dufox,2012-03-06T01:45Z,"my comment disapeard but an update for when it show's back up :D

i had a problem because some dumb shit decided to winrar the version i downloaded and a file got corrupt when i was extracting it.

the sooner people realize winrar is outdated and only used for programs that replace files the better.

winraring a game is literally stupid these days.
winraring a crack is smart.

learn from my ranting people :D

now to the actual crack. this crack is working with the rus/eng deluxe edition(the version that didnt have dlc)

i think what is confusing people with the language is you have to replace the biogame_rus.tlk file with a different file. but the game will not recognize it unless you rename the new file to the same name.
this is the (ghetto rigged way to change languages) a proper way will be out soon."

,tekproxy,2012-03-06T02:14Z,"TO IMPORT ME2 CHARACTER!

Get copy of the save file. It will have .pcsav as the extention.

Create a directory like this: C:UsersYourUsernameDocumentsBioWareMass Effect 2SaveJohn_30_Vanguard_123321Save_0000.pcsav

Replace John_30_Vanguard with your characters name, level and class. If you don't remember, use Gibbed save editor to check. There are 6 numbers at the end of the directory and 4 at the end of the file that don't seem to matter.

You probably have to restart the game after copying the files there."
,LemureZ,2012-03-06T02:17Z,Works fine although it can't seem to see ME2 save files and DLC can't register.

I am using the RUS/Eng version, with the DLC downloaded separately and this crack."
,Dufox,2012-03-06T13:05Z,"@johnIV

click on biogame_rus.tlk and drag it to your desktop.

take the file name biogame_int.tlk (from the language fix) and drag it to the coockedpc folder.

right click on biogame_int.tlk and rename it BIOGame_RUS.tlk

that should be all you have to do.
basically you are replacing the russian text with english text, but the game doesnt know what BIOGame_INT.tlk is
so the english file has to be named BIOGame_RUS.tlk in order for the game to read the file and know what to do with it."
,Sivos,2012-03-06T13:50Z,"Awesome, thank you for answering my question.  I assume when you said ME2 that would include ME1 which makes sense they would be together.  So, obviously, the council will be dead for me if they do reference them and my character is not a Spectre."

,therhymesmatter,2012-03-07T17:02Z,I was wandering...Will they be able to release a multiplayer crack or a virtual server so that we pirates could enjoy some multiplayer?It seems unlikely at this stage but all in all it's gonna make it's way through a Garena-like application 
,Dufox,2012-03-08T00:58Z,"they will almost guaranteed make a way to play online without having origin on your computer, but you will still have to buy the game.

unless they make an unofficial server to play on there is a 99.9% chance you wont be able to play online. even if they made one, private servers are almost always crap "

,ajicorath,2012-03-08T22:28Z,"Massive thanks for this. Like the person a few posts above, I bought the game but Origin is truly the worst piece of software ever. I've had Fifa 2012 for 5 months and never been able to load it once!

Anyway, I'm using this crack, but because I pre-ordered through Origin, I should have the bonus N7 armour and weapons, however they don't appear to be available. Is this a side effect of using the crack?

Many thanks."
