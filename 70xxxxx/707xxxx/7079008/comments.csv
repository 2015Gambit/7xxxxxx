[T],esharoth,2012-03-06T10:42Z,"Go to bayimg and upload the image you want to use. You'll get a link for the image, with letters at the end (e.g. kanImaadB). Copy the letters and modify them all to lowercase (e.g. kanimaadb). Now when you upload a torrent, put the lowercase letters where it says ""Image tag from bayimg"". The torrent will then display the image you uploaded."
