Dropping some of the folky elements of 2009s Reservoir, London-based outfit Fanfarlo move in a more synth-oriented, 80s new wave direction with 2012s Rooms Filled with Light. Which isnt to say theyve completely abandoned the grand and buoyant pop that made Reservoir such a surprise. On the contrary, working with producer Ben Allen (Animal Collective, Deerhunter, Gnarls Barkley), Fanfarlo have crafted a sonically adventurous and somewhat angular album that finds them coming into their own as less Grizzly Bear/Arcade Fire-influenced also-rans and more of a uniquely addictive neo-new wave ensemble in their own right. Once again showcasing the yearning baritone of Swedish-born lead singer Simon Balthazar, Fanfarlo also feature multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Cathy Lucas, who shares lead duties on a few songs. To these ends, we get the sparkly anthem Deconstruction and the Haircut 100-sounding Tunguska, with its blue-eyed soul saxophones. Elsewhere, the 80s vibe continues with Feathers, sounding something along the lines of a midtempo synth pop duet between David Byrne and Kate Bush, and the bright, rambling Tightrope, with its driving bassline coming on like a lost Fun Boy Three cut. Ultimately, the great thing about the 80s vibe on Rooms Filled with Light isnt that Fanfarlo have aped their idols, but rather that theyve found a way to make these Day-Glo, spiky-haired melodies feel utterly contemporary.
