Our external perseption of America and the typical attitudes you perceive from arrogant/ignorant people is that all Americans are republicans. And im not just talkin about the recent repulicans on TV but the general commen sense things people outside of America take for granted that we perseve to be general knowledge and common sense actually has to be explained to a majourity in the USA. I heard that something like 40%-50% of the US population beleives that the bible is literal fact. THAT is truly scarey..."
,tomreedtoon,2012-03-03T12:24Z,"Well, I'm an American. I'm not going to claim that Americans are exceptional people, or any of that conceited stuff normally associated with the ""Ugly American."" (Read the book if you can find it.) I'll simply say that everybody, in every nation, needs somebody like a Bill Maher to point out their flaws and imperfections. Maybe you're just angry that we got Craig Ferguson from Scotland, to do similar work in late-night TV. Don't worry, somebody else will come along to rake Britain over the coals. Cheer up!"
,C3rb,2012-03-03T13:08Z,"No anger here. Self deprification seems to be something new to the religious extremists of America. Im an atheist personally. Like i said 
the commonly held common sense general knowledge that i know to be the country and culture of the UK, no high society bullshit, you know
 down to earth ground people. I heard another one of those statistics years ago about how church attenance has fallen year on year in the
 uk for the last hundred years and thats whith a growing population. seems stark contrast to the 40%-50% of americans believing the bible
 to be literal fact.  Also, you obviousley dont know anything about British comedy and if all you can do is quote some monty python, 
faulty towers shit, then you sir are just another ignorant American. Thats by definition of the word ignorant, look it up in an English 
dictionary. And like i said, no anger here, was complementing America for producing Bill Maher and this episode of his show prooves that
 not all Americans are dumb as fuck. Just felt i needed to add that little disclaimer, wouldnt want you mis-intepreting this reply, taking
 it out of context and then trying to throw some misguided bs in my direction and expecting it to have meaning.

And yes i do agree with you ""every nation, needs somebody like a Bill Maher"" just its a shame America has taken so long to figure that out,
many other places around the world have known this for a long time, my original point was saying that id figured America was fucked cause
 of the state of intelligance of the general populous but here we have evidence that there is hope for you after all. no anger here friend."
,noles1970,2012-03-03T20:36Z,"Well.You forget what many Americans think of the UK.They call us dumb when we have the best universities in the world.Then they use Facebook,Microsoft,Apple,the Internet,the plane,cell phones,GPS, etc.All of which are American inventions.They call Americans lazy yet America DOMINATES in the Olympic medal count.England still has a king and queen in the 21st century!!!!What???You watch American movies,TV shows,comedies,etc. all which are far superior to English shows..Travel abroad and go to an International store and see which products are British compared to American...America blows the UK away.Go abroad and see how many UK restaurants there are as opposed to American.Look at the American GDP compared to the UK..not even close!!!You make fun of Bush who definitely was a joke.But what's worse?Having a crappy president or being a nation that kisses that crappy president's ass and follows him into war?You can keep being insecure about your own country..but we back up our awesomeness..God save the Queen...What a joke!!!hahaha"
,C3rb,2012-03-04T03:01Z,"ignorance is bliss. you seem very happy. good for you. awsomeness ???? wow. i refer you to my original post and this episode of Real Time.  BTW America didnt invent the internet. look it up. and you really shouldnt start comparing America's inventions with British. trust me, look it up. Like i said im an atheist, i look at the monarchy, christmas and marrage all in the same way, they are traditions, nothing more than a part of the culture and history. Of which American culture and history is a laughing stock around the world. good luck with life. "
