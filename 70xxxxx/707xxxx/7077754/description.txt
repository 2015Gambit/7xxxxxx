In a Dystopian Mushroom Kingdom, corruption and avarice reign supreme. Even the greatest heroes of the land have buckled beneath the overwhelming will of the amoral elite. When a series of grisly crimes pushes an unlikely champion to seek the truth, a mystery unfolds that could completely destroy everything he holds dear.


My opinion - VERRRRRY interesting look at the whole Super Mario Idea, kinda throws ya right off like that Hard R Rated Mortal Kombat they pitched. But it was entertaining and a welcome edition to my collection. Who knows someone else might like em. Really good pic, the audio isnt the best considering it looks like it was someones college project more than anything so its not even a B Rated Tv series. There are 10 episodes in all. Still a cool watch if you're looking for something different that you've never seen before.
