Pianist Pandelis Karayorgis, bassist Nate McBride, and drummer Curt Newton play
an honest, expressive free jazz thatΓÇÖs also playful and intelligentΓÇöit feels
closer to the wit and high spirits of hard bop or swing than most free piano
trios. Everything in the music is malleable, tempos are unfixed, ensemble roles
are fluid, and most of what happens from moment to moment is dictated by
whatever the trio is spontaneously developing at the time, not by predetermined
structures. Karayorgis sets ΓÇ£Who Said What WhenΓÇ¥ in motion with fast moving
extended lines, with McBride and Newton capering right beside him. Suddenly he
cuts off linear progress with blocky note clusters and the music disperses in
spattered piano notes and scattered snare accents and widely spaced bass
thrusts. The trio is interactive enough so that these frequent changes in
direction come not just from Karayorgis, but from anyone. Their empathy is
strong enough so that ideas emerge by mutual agreement and develop for as long
as the group maintains interest in them. Then they quickly decide together to
investigate another, usually contrasting, direction. This makes tunes like
ΓÇ£Correspondent,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Spinach Pie,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Fink, Sink TinkΓÇ¥ radically unstable, but
the music feels unstrained and even lighthearted. Their approach to jazz
standards like EllingtonΓÇÖs ΓÇ£The Mystery SongΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Warm ValleyΓÇ¥ is equally
discursive and free of literal historicisms. In fact, what theyΓÇÖve taken from
history is not style or genre limitations, but a sense of possibility, a license
to explore ΓÇô enjoy it as they do it.
