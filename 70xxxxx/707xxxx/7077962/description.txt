"Bust Me Right in the Head with It 
                           (Asuncion, Paraguay)"

The Race travels to Paraguay for the first time 
ever, as Teams struggle to produce during a 
fruity challenge, and Racers face a harsh 
reality if they fail to perfect a local 
balancing act.

(Rules are unclear if a show such as this would
be 'reality' or 'competitive reality'. Due to
this being a literal race involving lots of
running and high motion we went with 
'competitive'.

22/Slower+
Evolve...or die.

Enjoy :)
