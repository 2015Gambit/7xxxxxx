For more than a millennium, the ancient Olympics captured the imaginations of the Greeks, until
 a Christianized Rome terminated the competitions in the fourth century AD. But the Olympic 
ideal did not die and this book is a succinct history of the ancient Olympics and their modern
 resurgence. 



Classics professor David Young, who has researched the subject for over 25 years, reveals how 
the ancient Olympics evolved from modest beginnings into a grand festival, attracting hundreds
 of highly trained athletes, tens of thousands of spectators, and the finest artists and poets.
