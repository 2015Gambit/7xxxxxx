Look to http://css.setti.info/servers/l4d for available servers. You can leave your browser open and alternate between both windows by using the ""alt & tab"" buttons. Just cut & paste the url. "

Here's the link to download it from Pirate Bay...

Some may have already added servers to their favorites lists, but for those that haven't... this is a time saver!"

,xlevelx,2012-07-14T20:33Z,"To Nioki... I've been looking into your question and don't see anything in the game itself that is causing sound problems.

The only thing I can think of that may be causing the sound trouble you're experiencing is that it may be from the host you're playing on. 

Some customize their server maps to include extras like laser sights, rapid reload and more which may include an altered sound file. This may be the cause of the burning zombie sounds.

I hope this helps!"
