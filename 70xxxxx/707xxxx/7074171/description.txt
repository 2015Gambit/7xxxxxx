Game Info
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The war to Take Earth Back begins on March 6, 2012 for Xbox 360, 
Playstation 3, and PC. Not everyone will survive. An ancient alien 
race, known only as "Reapers", has launched an all-out invasion 

leaving nothing but a trail of destruction in their wake. Earth has 
been taken, the galaxy is on the verge of total annihilation, and you 
are the only one who can stop them. The price of failure is 
extinction. You are Commander Shepard, a character that you can 
forge in your own image. You determine how events will play out, 
which planets to explore, and whom to form alliances with as you 
rally a force to eliminate the Reaper threat once and for all. How 
you wage this war is completely up to you: go into combat with guns 
blazing or use cover to plan a more tactical assault. Utilize your 
squad to full effect or take a lone wolf approach. Rain death from a 
distance or go toe--to-toe with enemies using devastating melee 
attacks. Mass Effect 3 will react to each decision you make as you 
play through a truly unique experience of your own creation. The war
for Earth has begun and you decide how it ends.
