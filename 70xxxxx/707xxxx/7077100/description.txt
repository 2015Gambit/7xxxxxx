Review by Scott Yanow:
Fans of jam sessions and tenor battles will definitely want this CD. Tenors Scott Hamilton, Ken Peplowski and Spike Robinson (constantly pushed by the brilliant rhythm section of pianist Gerry Wiggins, guitarist Howard Alden, bassist Dave Stone and drummer Jake Hanna) take turns raising the temperature on such viable devices as "Blues Up and Down," "Shine," "I'll See You In My Dreams" and "The Jeep Is Jumpin'." Robinson (easily the oldest of the trio of tenors) gets a slight edge and generates the most heat, but the saxophonists actually complement each other quite well. A consistently exciting set.
