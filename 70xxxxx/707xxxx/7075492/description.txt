Here is newest version of Renoise for Mac OSX, a popular DAW with tracker-a-like approach.Renoise is a complete, expandable Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) with a refreshing twist. It lets you record, compose, edit, process and render production-quality audio using a tracker-based approach. It features a wide range of built-in audio processors, alongside support for all commonly used virtual instrument and effect plug-in formats. In a tracker, the music runs from top to bottom in an easily understood grid known as a pattern. Several patterns arranged in a certain order make up a song. Editing in a pattern grid lends itself very well to a fast and immediate keyboard-based workflow. With Renoise you can produce loops, beats, chords and melodies efficiently step-by-step.
