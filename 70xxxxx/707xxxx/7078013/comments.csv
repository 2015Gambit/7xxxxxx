,bowlinwes300,2012-03-05T05:15Z,as always awesome and super quick this time.
,melbcro,2012-03-05T05:48Z,This mp4 is so bad. Time to download a AVI!
,marielleramos,2012-03-05T06:29Z,download from ettv! avi format!
,superstrikertwo,2012-03-05T07:29Z,While I like the mp4 changes this one is just terrible. Every few seconds the image freezes up in places.
,ust2,2012-03-05T08:09Z," It plays perfectly fine in VLC, make sure you are using the latest version of it too.

 I'm on a shit PC atm, which has a 32mb gfx card to give you an idea of how old it is haha and it plays this in VLC with no problems..

 So I don't think the problem is this file if you're having difficulties playing it.


 I'm not sure why everyone switched them to MP4's suddenly though, all of sunday night's cartoon's are. It seems strange."
,doggler,2012-03-05T08:24Z,great quality for the size
,Radiolo,2012-03-05T09:33Z,"Don't listen to all these complaints! Quality is PERFECT, everything plays fluently on quite old computer. You just need a proper player (I'm using VLC for mp4 files) and I guarantee, you'll have no problems. Great compression, so small size of the file, and still it looks much better than most of 175mb avi releases! Thanks Eztv!"
,ebud,2012-03-05T09:56Z,"i don't like MP4s, i frequently had problem playing them, yet haven't tried 'em since i got the latest version of VLC... running on a 5or6 y/o Toshiba laptop with WindowsVistaHomePremium.
Generally, I had a hard time when slowing down an MP4 vid or when rewinding/f.fowarding it while it plays. (i watch eng. progs. though i'm not eng. native)."
,RDawgg,2012-03-05T14:52Z,"I like MP4's, but only for short stuff like music videos.. "
,RDawgg,2012-03-05T14:59Z,"I just checked out the video. The quality is as good as avi, except it's 3 times smaller in size. This saves up a lot of room on my HDD. I'm prolly gonna convert all 300 gigs of my TV shows to mp4."
,RDawgg,2012-03-05T15:01Z,"By smaller size, I meant the file is only 64mb. And the resolution is even bigger than usual."
[T],jmz619,2012-03-05T15:51Z,wow great quality for only 64MB amazing +1
,stijr,2012-03-05T15:57Z,"thanks! 
never got a lemon from this guy."
,BrPrimey0,2012-03-05T16:08Z,"I've got 99 problems but image freezing ain't one of them.

This mp4 has zero problems. If you're having a problem it might be time to upgrade your pc. Quit running videos on a potato. "
,dudew8,2012-03-05T18:53Z,"Im so stupid, sound was behind alot and it thought it was ""part of the show"" and i watched 5 minutes into it before it became old and boring and then i found out it wasnt supposed to do that xD"
,VSteez,2012-03-05T19:11Z,"Great speedy torrent and great quality. Everybody complaining should download VLC, it works a lot better and the quality is brilliant as opposed to WMP."
,ebud,2012-03-06T00:35Z,"Did anyone ever had problems scrolling in an MP4? 
I generally get small freezes/glitches, even if i play them on VLC. I know my PC is old (about 5 y/o)and running on WindowsVista, but it shouldn't be a problem, would it?"
,Erik_O,2012-03-06T00:49Z,Actually better quality and smaller size than xvid! Love MP4!
,ebud,2012-03-06T02:15Z,"alright now, this MP4 just works fine!
Thanks a lot to the creator and uploader. You make my world a bit better every download i get from u.

This episode is just great too! Finally Family Guy is back on track!"
,Erik_O,2012-03-07T00:47Z,perfect quality and smaller size than xvid!
,PlatinuM195,2012-03-07T06:28Z,Awesome quality and works perfectly. Finally killing off the old avi standard :D you guys are the best.
,Darsh84,2012-03-07T13:53Z,Perfect quality!! plays fluently. No freezing whatsoever. I use vlc to play all video files. Thanks eztv!! It was about time .avi format was bid goodbye.
,PlstkSprk,2012-03-07T19:36Z,Less than half the size of Xvid and better quality... A+
,twijjit,2012-03-08T15:13Z,"Since no one else here has anything constructive to say... I'm sure it plays fine on VLC, but I like to share what I download with friends, who have computers of all variations, and most/all don't have VLC. This one's running like garbage on a fast (quad-core)computer, and the same on a mediocre (dual-core) laptop. ""Get a faster computer"" - Thats what I'm talking about. ""Oh, okay. I'll go spend $800 on a new top-o-the-line system, just so I can save an extra 60 megs of space."" Maybe this file format will pan out in the future, and if it works for you, thats awesome! But until then, if you're a ""collector"" like myself, well...an external hard drive is a lot cheaper than buying a new system to appease what I consider a ""bugged"" compression format.

Now I'm sure someone has something non-constructive to say to this, so let the flames begin.. (not that I'll be here to read them.)"
,BayDwella,2012-03-08T22:15Z,thanks
,BayDwella,2012-03-08T22:21Z,"Windows 7 64 bit , runs perfect on vlc player"
,ust2,2012-03-12T04:08Z," Where are tonight's episodes? 

 They were all new and are uncharacteristically late getting uploaded, starting to worry they aren't coming! >:(


 @twijjit

 If your friends don't have VLC, it only takes a quick google search, and if these friends also don't have internet it's only a small file so you could easily give it to them with the other files you share..

 Nothing else is needed, not even extra codecs that those other progs your friends are using required.

 But no, that is too difficult and you'd rather be stubborn and fight any change. Suit yourself.

 How powerful or not a PC is really doesnt matter here either, as i've said i'm on a shit box that is 11 years old and everything plays fine when using VLC."
,ust2,2012-03-12T04:31Z," I guess they aren't getting uploaded to TPB this time..?

 They are all over at kickass torrents (kat.ph or just google the show and season/episode number), uploaded by the same trusted users.

 Don't forget Bob's Burgers S02 premiered too!"
,Goat_,2012-03-13T18:55Z,Amazing how this 64 MB can have a better quality than a 132 MB file!
,iamhelix,2012-03-14T03:59Z,if you have problems playing this its you or your computer not the file  or its container / compression type
,tornripley,2012-03-19T01:39Z,Thanks loads!
,midurix,2012-03-30T12:22Z,"For some reason this is the only video file my Samsung tv won't play properly, I get audio drops every 5-20 second for maybe half a second at a time. So I end up missing out words. Very weird considering that the TV will play absolutely everything else I throw at it and I have owned it for just over a year and nothing else has failed to play absolutely flawlessly. This only happens with this torrent and American Dad also LOL."
,najor66,2012-07-01T10:46Z,"I prefer smaller file when it comes to video and this one fits the bills. Thanks for the post.
I use VLC on a PC and the file plays nicely too."
