Shelby Lynne (born Shelby Lynn Moorer, October 22, 1968, Quantico, Virginia) is an American singer and songwriter. The success of the 1999 album I Am Shelby Lynne led to her winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist, even though she had been active in the music industry for some time. She released a Dusty Springfield tribute album called Just a Little Lovin' in 2008. Since then she has started her own independent record label, called Everso Records, and released three albums: Tears, Lies and Alibis, Merry Christmas, and Revelation Road. (wikipedia)

Revelation Road is Shelby's most personal record yet. She wrote, recorded and produced the album, which leads off with the title track and first single, a stirring reflection on reckoning and redemption. From Country to Pop and back again, this is Shelby at her finest.
