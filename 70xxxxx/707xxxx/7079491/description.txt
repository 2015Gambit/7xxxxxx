                           DESCRiPTiON 

 An account of the million British horses put to work on the front line during 
 the First World War, told using archive footage, testimonies from veterans of 
 the conflict and sequences with experts such as former RSPCA Chief Vet Mark 
 Evans. Journalist Brough Scott tells the story of his grandfather General Jack 
 Seely and his horse Warrior, which was renowned for its courage and became a 
 mascot for the troops.                                                                      
                                 Enjoy!
