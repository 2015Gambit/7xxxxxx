I CLAIM NO CREDITS FOR THESE BOOKS: I've downloaded them once and I'd like to share them.

All books are of the first editions, except for microbiology which is the third.
OCR (text readability) has been applied to almost all of the books.


(Note: Medical books and software are being removed from all over the web, so start sharing anything you have)
