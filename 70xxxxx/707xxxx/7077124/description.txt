Despite ordering the death of millions, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler managed to survive more than 40 attempts on his own life. Using both re-enactments and first-person accounts, this documentary series details the many plots launched against Hitler. Computer-generated graphics, classified documents and archival film footage of the FÃ¼hrer's various strongholds help detail the elaborate security measures used to protect the German leader.
