NEW FACTS will be learned, emotions will be churned. WWII buffs and historians will be delighted even upward to 5-stars and beyond with the inside information of what took place beside the ruthless Nazi Hitler. For viewers who thrive on continual education, this will enlighten you about the enemy of WWII, not just the ""bodyguard"" element. It you seek 'light' entertainment, keep in mind this Athena DVD is a documentary, a very good one, and sometimes graphic.

This 13 episode DVD set contains astonishing historical photos and film in sienna, B&W, and color. Some film segments or portraits are used repeatedly in different episodes as the footage is used to visualize the expert commentary continually being presented by the narrator, Robert Powell (also on the SUBTITLE option.) The repetition suggests the DVD could have been shorter in length, but because it was initially presented as segments on TV, the repeated views were important for each episodes' portion of the story that was being highlighted on that day.

This series is not just about the many bodyguards. But it is the story of the man, Adolf Hitler, his rise to political fame, his ruthless pursuit to conquer Europe, his eventual fall, and his need for protecting himself. It's a combined series of Hitler AND the teams of bodyguards including the escort command, Gestapo, headquarters guard, RSD, internal security, SA, SD, and the fierce SS. The series tells of their beginning to end, leaders to traitors, and members closest to Hitler. Details previously undisclosed. There are live eyewitness interviews with some of the German survivors of these groups.

Although Hitler was a ruthless and ugly ruler, part of the history of the 1930s and 1940s Germany is told in an extensively detailed and accurate way as part of the German Political and War story that has seen little prior attention. Hitler's life and evil humanity history survived because of a unique system of personal guards, no regular schedule, frequent last minute changes, unpredictability, rivalry among guards and leaders, layered protection and, ultimately, chance.

Included in episodes are photos, film, diagrams, and commentary in detail about the cars (Episode #8), planes (#9), and trains (#10) used by Hitler and the adaptations created for his protection. It tells of the key personnel who operated them. Great nostalgic views of old transportation.

Over 40 attempts on Hitlers life over 25 years. Why were none successful? This documentary series tries to answer that question. It also leads the viewer to consider 'What would the world be like if Hitler's Bodyguard had NOT been successful?' Or on occasions when the bodyguards were instigators, ""What would have happened had they killed Hitler, the man and institution?""

It's a thought provoking, and emotional series. A ""Churchill's Bodyguard"" companion.
Extras include ""A Viewer's Guide"" booklet filled with episode highlights, questions to ponder, photos, bibliography, Bodyguard Who's Who, and a description of each unit. A list and description of films made about Hitler assassination attempts. Photo galleries on each disc and...
SUBTITLES, extremely helpful with the German names and locations.
