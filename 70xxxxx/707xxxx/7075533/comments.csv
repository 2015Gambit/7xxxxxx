,TheMetalGrl,2012-06-09T13:53Z,"I ran Alien Skin's official 30 day trial (from their website) before installing this [k].
Now my computer/PS remembers this somehow and tells me my tiral is up asking for a SN, even when I try to launch this K version...
Any solutions? Is there a hidden file I can delete to uninstall the original trial plugin fully? Or even better.. anyone have a key-gen..??

Thanks"
