,corriebain,2012-03-26T22:30Z,"can someone help me out please if possible? I used to able to download torrents no problem, but now when I click on the link that says 'get this torrent', instead of downloading it, it says 'extracting' and then a pop up says 'welcome to the Mozilla Firefox setup wizard' which simply links me to upgrading my already updated Firefox..I have azureus vuze as my torrent client which works fine with other torrents. any ideas as to what could have gone wrong?any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance to all on pirate bay and especially to the very kind person who uploads these torrents, you are amazing!
