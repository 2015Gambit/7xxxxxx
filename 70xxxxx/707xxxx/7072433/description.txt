

Now that he's assumed the mantle of Afro-Beat superstardom from his father, Femi Kuti seems much more assured on his third album, Shoki Shoki. 
Femi is just as focused on political and social situations as Fela Kuti, as displayed on several tracks here ("Blackman Know Yourself," "What Will Tomorrow Bring," "Victim of Life," "Look Around"). Also like his father, he never lets the lyrically conscious material get in the way of pushing irresistible grooves. 
From the openers "Truth Don Die" and "Beng Beng Beng" -- both of which were passed off to dance remixers including Masters at Work and Black Science Orchestra -- to later tracks like "Sorry Sorry," Femi is a strict bandleader who knows how to get the most out of his charges. 
In fact, the only real stylistic difference between father and son is the fact that songs by Femi are shorter and poppier than those by Fela. (AMG)
