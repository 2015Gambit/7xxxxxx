,BFNC2,2012-03-02T03:40Z,Why did you change file format to MP4? Sadly my network player doesn't like MP4's... Any chance of changing back to AVI?
,Dble,2012-03-02T05:45Z,Both Quicktime and VLC were unable to open it. Never had any problems before with eztv.

,Glitch02,2012-03-03T02:25Z,Thanks for posting this.  :)
,Dunbar714,2012-03-05T01:21Z,"This is the second week in a row that Parks and Rec .mp4 has been completely unwatchable due to bad compression effects, I watch in VLC and I've not had this problem before with any other x264 videos. "
,dielec,2012-03-05T02:15Z,Works and looks great on my PC with GOM player. Thanks eztv!!
,shWit,2012-03-06T03:52Z,MP4 is awesome for PS3 and mobile devices; quit bitching.
,shWit,2012-03-06T18:05Z,"And it worked for me in both quicktime and VLC, with what seems like slightly better quality than .avi files of similar size.  "
,RedTy,2012-03-11T19:03Z,Thank you for finally thinking of the ps3 users!! MP4 works great
,BFNC2,2012-03-12T01:07Z,"Shcwit, I'm glad the change makes it better for you, but the change had the opposite effect on me. I hardly think that makes my comment ""bitching"""
