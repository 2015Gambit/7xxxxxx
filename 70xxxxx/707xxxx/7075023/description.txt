For Better File Info, use this great free program. Lets you see Multiple audio and subtitle tracks for Anime. Great if a torrent is partially done for a large and poorly seeded torrent to see what the real info is on a partially downloaded torrent file without having to wait for a full download.

Please Enjoy, and always remember to buy any products you torrent if you do enjoy it to support the creators so that they make more of it!
