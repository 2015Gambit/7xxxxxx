Please keep seeding once you finishing downloading."
,grEnkenoB,2012-03-05T01:36Z,it's your torrent and you're only seeding 2 or 3? might as well not even put it up. damn. I really wanted this.
,[Z],2012-03-05T02:09Z,well then how many times over do people normally seed their own torrents?
,[Z],2012-03-14T23:54Z,Well I ended up seeding it 6 times at full speed.(400KBps). Now I'll just leave it on at 4KBps until the end of time.
,Asalvus,2012-03-15T01:03Z,Seeds please?
,[Z],2012-03-21T08:35Z,I'm seeding again at full speed. Its not my fault no one else likes to seed after they leech.
,Spec234,2012-03-22T07:01Z,I'll try to seed this for as long as I can once it is complete. I however can only seed at night. Thanks Much Uploader!
,pokajunk,2012-03-31T20:33Z,"Been looking for this forever, thanks. Gonna seed for as long as i can :)"
,H_Mist,2012-04-14T17:12Z,Takes forever to get any sort of decent down speed... Will seed when once this thing finishes >_
,[Z],2012-04-23T18:36Z,"yeah sorry about that. I only seed when my computer is on, and sometimes I have to stop seeding at high levels to do other upload intensive things. However I am now close to seeding 10 times over and at that point I'll leave it at a low upload speed. So its really up to people to seed after they leech."
