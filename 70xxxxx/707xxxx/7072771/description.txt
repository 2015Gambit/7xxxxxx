BBC - The Police in Montserrat (1981)



Information
This BBC 47 minute documentary "Police in Montserrat" was shown on UK television back in the 1980's and it hasn't been broadcast outside of the UK. This version includes several clips that did not make one of the previous broadcasts. There is an extended intro, and additional footage of all three band members being interviewed. In mid 1981, young Jools Holland flew out to Montserrat with a small camera crew to film The Police at work recording their fourth album, Ghost In The Machine. After the cold UK and rainy Netherland where the first three albums were recorded, the island of Montserrat and George Martin's homely Air Studio offered a welcoming, warm environment for the recording of what many fans still consider to be the band's best album. After Jools' introduction to the island we see Sting running up a hill to the studio, and are thrust straight into a series of fascinating interviews and videos. Jools talks to each band member in turn, asking Andy to explain how he gets some of his effects and gets him to demonstrate his Roland guitar synthesiser.
