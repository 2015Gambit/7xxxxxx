Other than that great torrent :D
Awesome quality 
10/10"
,Pizzabox23,2012-03-05T12:39Z,"Oops, well now you have ghost princess in high def. I didn't get around to watching the last few episodes. I'm pretty sure you can find Incendium on demonoid but not in high def."
,Pizzabox23,2012-03-05T12:41Z,Yeah Incendium is on demonoid but it's pixellated as shit; pretty much unwatchable. :/

,uncleface,2012-04-23T06:23Z,"Any chance we can start getting more of Season 4?  401 and 402 are out there but there have been two more aired since then.  I know these are all volunteer efforts, just hoping."

,TrueW0RDS,2012-08-16T15:06Z,Great upload! A:10 V:10! +1! OHHH GLOB!
,TrueW0RDS,2012-08-16T15:13Z,"Great upload! A:10 V:10! +1! OH yeah this seasons is *INCOMPLETE*, It's missing Incendium (last episode in the season)"
,Pizzabox23,2012-08-18T04:05Z,"@TrueW0RDS 
If you look at the first 2 episodes you would see that it's been noted that Incendium wasn't in this.
At the time of upload no good quality version of incendium was available, only a pixelated 240p version. A copy of incendium has been linked to in previous comments, feel free to download it and add it to the folder :)"
,Pizzabox23,2012-08-18T04:06Z,I meant first 2 comments*
,Pizzabox23,2012-08-18T04:12Z,Oh and I'll also note the reason why Ghost princess was labelled twice as GP and Incendium is because it turns out the episode of which was meant to be incendium in HQ was a fake upload by a d.me user and I didn't realize.
