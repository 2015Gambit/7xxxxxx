,alkwef,2012-03-05T02:37Z,ULer did not upload to demonoid. Remove the first tracker in properties to get rid of the error.
,Jero2000,2012-03-05T13:11Z,I never download anything that has been uploaded by an anonymous source. I could just as well buy a PC if I wanted to p!ss on security.
,mactechly,2012-03-05T21:47Z,is this working ?
,iPlunder,2012-03-05T22:19Z,"Jero2000, that's such an unbelievably asinine statement that I don't even know where to begin!

First off, what's your definition of anonymous?
Unless you personally know the uploader, EVERYTHING you download from a torrent site is from an anonymous source!

I've downloaded thousands of files, and rarely even look at who the uploader is.
I have NEVER used anti-virus software on my Macs (although I do intend to install ClamAVX very soon), and have suffered no ill effects yet from a download.
I have run MacScan a few times, and it alerted to a couple of suspicious wallpapers, so I deleted them - no big deal!

Since you're so concerned, I would think you're already using anti-virus software, and you can immediately scan and quarantine any suspicious files, so what's the problem?
If you refuse to download from ""anonymous"" sources, you're missing out on a lot of files!"

Downloaded it without any problems whatsoever; the only contents are the app and a text file. I scanned it with two well-known security programs and found nothing... you don't have to download it if you don't want to, but that's your loss.

mactechly, it's working for me--tested with several different devices. For optimal connection speed (if Internet doesn't matter) create a wireless network with your Mac and connect to that.

and well said, iPlunder. "

,mactechly,2012-03-06T17:21Z,"Thank alkwef, works just fine."
,SavgStorm,2012-04-06T18:02Z,"is there another torrent with the new 1.2 version of this program? or is there a serial for the 1.2 version out there somewhere? just  curious. I made the newly move of updating because I didn't see any security in place so I assumed the update would have none either. But it's asking for a ""registration certificate"" and has a dialog box which I'm assuming they are basically just asking for a serial of some sort. Thanks ahead of time :D I'll downgrade for now though."
,alkwef,2012-04-10T03:52Z,1.1 is available from appd. no 1.2 AFAIK
