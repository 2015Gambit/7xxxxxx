That promise (true or not) was made to the Hebrews at a time when Jews and Hebrews were the same people. But in 740AD some people in the Khazar Empire (central Asia) became Jewish, seemingly by order of their government. (See Arthur Koestler – The 13th Tribe). They proceeded to convince the rest of the world that its anti-Semitic to make any distinction between Hebrews (an almost black race) and the Ashkanazi Jews (white as a ghost). These alleged white Hebrews are clever identity thieves. They merely adopted the religion of the indigenous Hebrews, then claimed all those native's rights. They do things like convince the public that Tay-Sachs is a “Jewish” disease when its strictly an Ashkanazi genetic disorder that did not exist anywhere in the region before the current adult population move in.  Are you a Roman because you become a Roman Catholic? Study real history. Don't get fooled."
