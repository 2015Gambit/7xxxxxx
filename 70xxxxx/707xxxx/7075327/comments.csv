,Dregon909,2012-03-11T23:16Z,"Yeah, won't launch for me either. On OSX Lion, should it be able to work for me?"
,Dregon909,2012-03-11T23:28Z,"Found the file inside, ran it, says its not valid on this computer."
,deathtax,2012-03-12T04:20Z,Does not work with Lion.
,marinhojr,2012-03-16T03:06Z,"For those with bouncing patch, just Terminal:

chmod 777 ableton.suite.8.2.8-ipatch.app/Contents/MacOS/iPatcher

simple as that!"
,ssphoto22,2012-03-17T07:24Z,"@marinhojr

When I run the command it says 'no such file or directory'

any advise? "

Yeah. what worked for me: I added a directory. exp: if the fie is in your applications folder take: chmod 777 /applications ...."
,future-dada,2012-03-20T16:35Z,I do not know. Check the permissions.
,syoukhan,2012-05-10T12:05Z,"don't works, if double click just keeps bouncing, if launch it with terminal...nothing happens"
,imkid,2012-05-31T15:06Z,"hey guys, I was having the same problem. I solved by... 

1. ""right-click"" the ableton.suite.8.2.8-ipatch.app
2. choose ""show package contents""
3. go into ""Contents"" folder
4. Go into ""MacOS"" folder
5. ""right-click"" the ""ipatcher"" 
6. from menu choose ""Copy Path> Terminal Path""
7. Open Terminal
8. Type in... 

""chmod 777"" space ""paste terminal path""

*** I copied & pasted the iPatch app into the Live 8.2.8 folder inside of the ""Applications > Live8.2.8"" folder... My terminal path was...

SO if you do the same by simply ""right click"" and ""copy"" the "".app"" then you should be able to use the same terminal url and then just ""copy"" the code + url below and paste it into terminal!

chmod 777 /Applications/Live 8.2.8/ableton.suite.8.2.8-ipatch.app/Contents/MacOS/iPatcher"
,jllx,2012-06-03T03:16Z,"Okay so I got the patch running but when I have to select the item to update, and I select Live, it tells me ""You can't apply this patch on that file !"".

What am I doing wrong?"
,gsof,2012-07-08T23:54Z,"Solutions provided by @imkid works perfect, thanks for sharing this."
,chaostastic,2012-08-25T12:33Z,"mmmfish, why don't you pull this torrent, fix the app and repost? It's like a dead easy thing to do. Stop spreading bad stuff that already is available too!"
