Bryn Blayne is back. In her first match the Champion Ariel X destroyed her physically, mentally and sexually. Did this cause Bryn to break down, cry and run home to mommy? No fucking way. Bryn hit the gym, got outside training and came back stronger, faster, and better. If you cannot take a brutal loss in your first match and bounce back better the next time, you have no business being in Ultimate Surrender.

 Holly Heart has probably had the toughest matches of any wrestler. This fitness model is asked to take on the biggest, strongest and best this site has to offer. She never backs down, she never gives in, she always fights hard. Every wrestler should look to Holly for inspiration. 

Ranked 6th vs 7th. This close match up did not disappoint. Brutal non-scripted wrestling at its best. Both wrestlers were exhausted, leaving it all on the mat. One wrestler lost and got brutally fucked and humiliated in RD4. The other grabbed a well deserved win!
