[T],promodsharma,2012-03-04T13:45Z,"@'Cuelebre' - I stand Corrected :). Yes the latest version is '3.5.10'. Simply download the latest version and install over the existing one (no need to uninstall the current version). 'Copy - Paste - Replace' the Folders as you do in this one and you are ready to use the new version ! The plugins are portable & will work with any future higher version, by using the method above."
