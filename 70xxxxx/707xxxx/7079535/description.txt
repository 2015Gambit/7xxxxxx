Details:

On the first, blessed Halloween in living memory that we havenΓÇÖt been subjected to a new Saw flick more grisly than a Gaddafi corpse shot, letΓÇÖs hope The Miserable Rich are here instigating a far more sublime new franchise. Their third album Miss You in the Days is the Brighton chamber pop outfitΓÇÖs ghost story collection ΓÇô its sleeve a gathering of amorphous spectres in snow thatΓÇÖll no doubt be trotted out one day as ΓÇÿproof of paranormal activityΓÇÖ on Most Haunted; its sounds the fragile broodings of piano, viola and violin echoing ΓÇô literally ΓÇô around a haunted pub attic in the grounds of Blickling Hall where the album was recorded within earshot of the headless ghost of Anne Boleyn. Its themes: the inhuman and incorporeal ΓÇô poltergeists, possessions, apparitions and other such banes of the weak-minded and gullible ΓÇô rendered in wonderfully human fashion. Like Beirut hosting a Wuthering Heights theme Halloween party, itΓÇÖs a record that grows goose-bumps in the night.
