,sufiblade,2012-03-13T10:20Z,"Uploaded on March 2012, and claiming to have the latest versions. But I see here Exposure 3 instead of 4!"
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-13T10:37Z,"@'sufiblade' - Please do your homework and read the description, before posting comments to misguide others.

1) Alienskin Exposure V 4 is only for Mac.

2)If you read the description, I have uploaded the plugin only for Windows ( and this is the latest version for windows)

3) A simple search on Google would have let you know the truth."
,sufiblade,2012-03-13T13:34Z,But I have V4.0.0.439 trial running on my Windows machine.
,sufiblade,2012-03-13T13:35Z,"I got it from here:

https://app.alienskin.com/downloads/

As you can see, it says Exposure 4 there as well"
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-13T20:23Z,"@'sufiblade ' - You will find Alienskin Exposure 4 , for windows here - 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7100274/Photoshop_Plugin_Alien_Skin_Exposure.4.0.0.439_Revision.20227_La

This was a hard nut to crack (The Mac version was cracked easily ), it was cracked just 4 Hrs. back by X-Force (All credit to them). You will find the Crack Revision number also mentioned."
,sufiblade,2012-03-14T05:47Z,"Wow thanks man, checking it out. I guess the fault was mine that the 4.0 only got released right after this torrent arrived"
[T],promodsharma,2012-03-14T07:48Z,@'sufiblade ' - You are welcome :)
,SideSkroll,2012-07-31T08:38Z,"HOw about blow up 3? :)
Thanks."
,SealTeam9,2012-08-24T05:52Z,"Thanks for the bundle, but like previous releases and x-force cracks, these do NOT work for Windows 7 x64 with Photoshop CS6 x64.  That said, I have every reason to believe they WILL work for previous Photoshop versions."
