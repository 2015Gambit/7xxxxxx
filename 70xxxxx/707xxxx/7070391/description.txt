Requiem is a program that removes Apple's DRM (called FairPlay) from songs, videos, and books purchased via iTunes, so they can be played on non-Apple-approved devices like a SlimServer or Linux box. The DRM removal is a lossless process - it is merely decrypting the file, not decoding and reencoding it. 

See the README in one of the releases for more about how to use Requiem and how it works.
