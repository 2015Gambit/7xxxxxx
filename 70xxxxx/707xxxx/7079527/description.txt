End 2009 Atari stopped the Crashday MasterServer.

The New Master Server is since then hosted by player RichDutch from The Netherlands.

To use the new server;
Open, with notepad/wordpad, in Crashday main map netdefault.cfg and change line 6 in;
masterserverip

Or replace the old netdefault.cfg;
Download and unpack the new masterserver.rar with winzip or winrar and copy it to the crashday main directory/map and confirm replacing the excisting one.

Enjoy the Ride!


btw Crashday version 1.0 and 1.1 users will find almost only 1.2 lobbies
Using the Crashday1.2. exe (also needs to be copied to the main Crashday directory/map) you can join Crashday v1.2 online
