"Exit Through the Kwik E Mart"

In order to get back at his dad, Bart goes 
undercover as a graffiti street artist and 
plasters Homers unflattering image all over 
Springfield. But one night, Bart and 
Milhouse get caught in the act by 
established street artists Shepard Fairey, 
Ron English, Kenny Scharf and Robbie Conal 
(guest voicing as themselves), and to 
Barts surprise, they invite him to exhibit 
his satirical artwork in his very own 
gallery show. Meanwhile, a hip, new health 
food superstore opens in Springfield that 
threatens to put Apu and the Kwik-E-Mart 
out of business.
