,BlueTak,2012-03-03T23:34Z,Thank you once again. What movies have you got lined up?
[T],tr108,2012-03-05T02:08Z,"You're welcome.

I don't have any films in the stream right this moment (trying to finish off a TV show, Justice League Unlimited). I'm open to suggestions, however... :)"
,donotcare,2012-03-05T18:21Z,can you please do the scream trilogy? the star wars saga? killer elite? a bronx tale? just to name a few. thank you in advance if you decide to do them. if you don't thank you for reading my request. cheers from new york!
,BlueTak,2012-03-05T22:19Z,"Machine Gun Preacher & Killer Elite would be great. 

Anything recent really, much like YIFY's uploads. "
[T],tr108,2012-03-06T23:24Z,"Killer Elite & Machine Gun Preacher should happen. Check back by Sat nite.

The Star Wars saga will mos def happen tho prolly not till April. (I'm a huge fan myself)

The Scream films & A Bronx Tale probably won't tho..."
,donotcare,2012-03-07T19:05Z,Perfect! My birthday is in April! I appreciate you doing all of these movies. Thank you so much!
,BlueTak,2012-03-07T21:04Z,"TR, with the recent announcement of ATV3 and 1080p playback, will you support? I assume you're an Apple fanboy too ;)"
[T],tr108,2012-03-10T06:29Z,"I'd love to be able to share 1080p encodes, but since 1080p content (at least right now) doesn't work *at all* on the ATV2, that would mean doing two encodes for each film. Not sure that's feasible.

I'm looking to replace my G1 ATV - I also have an ATV2 - with a new ATV3, so I'll investigate 1080p encodes, for certain. :)"
,jegator,2012-03-18T18:38Z,"Thanks TR!  Would you consider uploading the extended lord of the rings trilogy, star wars, and maybe 50/50?"
,insomniacgirl,2012-03-20T02:55Z,Amazing quality thanks!!!!
[T],tr108,2012-03-20T12:28Z,"Thanks for the love, everyone!

jegator, I'll def do LOTR extended, but not until mid-April at the earliest. (I'm a fan myself :)"
,Bali2011,2012-03-29T23:46Z,Thank you!
