Instructions:
1. Download, Install the program, remember where you installed it to.
2. Navigate to where you installed it to.
3. Copy you compiled game folder contents including subdirectories to the desired game numbered file. (ex. if you wanted your level to be level 33, then put it in the lvl-033 folder)
4. repeat the process until you fill the board. You can move both single player and multiplayer maps to these folders. Either will run, and single player mode kinda gives you a chapters idea.
5. Run the MM03.exe file, it will flash some text as it converts your .exe files to N2KMaster Megamapper format file (.n2k) 
6. Select the desired levels you wanna play. Congratulations you've extended your FPS Creator past what the creators of the software thought possible.
