Information
------------------------------

Austin is on a mission to find one of the most elusive snakes in the world, the mythical and mysterious Tzabcan rattlesnake. His journey starts at the giant stone statues of Chichen Itza: ancient Mayan ruins from a civilisation that revered the Tzabcan. But this civilisation is gone, and so are the snakes.

Austin must now trek deep into the jungle in search of this dangerous viper. Forest snakes like the Tzabcan are incredibly hard to find as they camouflage perfectly in the undergrowth. But he's not the only one on the forest keeping an eye out for snakes: a troop of howler monkeys have spotted one and they don't delay in letting every one know about it. The noise leads Austin to a remote temple deep in the jungle where amongst the ruins he finds his legendary serpent.

Also in this episode, Austin finds a lance head viper, peccary, a boa constrictor, a coral snake, a tarantula, and a troop of howler monkeys.
