GCB.S01E01.480p.HDTV.x264-mSD [MKV 222MB]

[/b][/color] Amanda Vaughn, once the ultimate high school "mean girl," is forced to return home in disgrace after her marriage ends in scandal.
Amanda is nothing like the girl she was 20 years ago, but as her old classmates reacquaint themselves with the new Amanda, will her home town welcome her with open arms or seek revenge? No one in this town is a saint, but that doesn't mean they can't have a heart.
As Amanda and her teenage kids try to adjust to their new lives, the ladies from her past alternate between sympathy and scheming.
