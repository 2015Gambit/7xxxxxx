I have scanned 2 of my old issues if this mystery/fiction magazine from 1986.
I think it remained in publication for a very short time.
My main interest in buying these issues was the Dashiell Hammett story After the Thin Man spanning over both issues.
Also have a look at the following link:

I hope you like these. The scan has come of pretty well for such an old mag of 25 years!
