Swimming with Crocodiles
Documentary series which aims to do the unthinkable - see if people can swim with crocodiles


1)  Botswana 
Botswana
Ben Fogle travels to Botswana to join a pilot research study which aims to do the unthinkable - swim with Nile crocodiles. These ancient reptiles spend roughly 80% of their lives underwater, yet relatively little is known about their subaquatic lives. Now for the first time, crocs have become the biggest killers of humans in Africa - up to 700 this year - so new research is vital. Wildlife experts Brad Bestelink and Andy Crawford have devised a method of diving with crocodiles which they believe to be safe. For the first time, leading crocodile authority Adam Britton has come to test their theories, and see if they can reveal new information about these magnificent beasts. But after the team's underwater cameraman Mike Pitts has a near miss with a crocodile, will they continue with the task they have set themselves?

2)  Australia 
Ben Fogle travels to Australia's Northern Territory to attempt a dive with the most aggressive of all reptiles, the saltwater crocodile. Having successfully undertaken underwater research on the Nile crocodile, will the team of scientists be able to do so here - where it has never been attempted? With humans and crocs sharing more and more territory, the work is more important than ever before as increased conflict is inevitable. During the programme, Ben uncovers the complicated relationship between croc and man when he meets a grief-stricken aboriginal elder whose favourite giant 'boss' crocodile has been shot dead. The team find it almost impossible to find the right conditions to dive with a 'saltie' and, when they do, they have no idea how it will react.
