,nogtci,2012-04-06T05:43Z,"Video plays for about six seconds, then stops. It is the same with every player I try. WMP just gives an error saying the file is in use... Can someone help me sort this out XBMC will not play the file either... I have rechecked my download for integrity and the file is complete.

Any help would be appreciated.
