,wallmartysec,2012-03-03T21:43Z,"TERRIBLE MOVIE !! As if Ed Woods had done Plan 9 from Outer Space in 2011... Bad acting, impossible situations (a guy gets shot in the gut but walks miles later to safety with only an occasional wince of pain), supposed angels that minutes before were busily discussing their love life (?) while monsters were hunting them down, the high rating in IMDB only means we are becoming a world of retards, so watch out for the people walking around with ice cream cones stuck on their foreheads..."
