,shinobiXRT,2012-03-02T19:09Z,"thanks, we needed a HD version with Eng Audio"
,shinobiXRT,2012-03-03T12:12Z,so this is a reseed of aoloffline's? with added dub? because your file name is exactly the same on torrent hash
,DeepHorizons,2012-03-03T17:00Z,"Yea, Re-seed with added dub & sub"
,shinobiXRT,2012-03-03T19:09Z,"thanks and good work. if it matters to you, your version was less compatible with direct TV play. but the ""subs only during text"" was a very good touch. have you got a youtube channel?"

The movie have amazing effect of sound and superb visual. DONT WORRY, THERE ARE 4 SPOKEN LANGUAGES, THE DEFAULT IS JAPANESE, SO, GO TO THE AUDIO SETTINGS AND JUST CLICK ON ENGLISH FOR SPOKEN LANGUAGE."
,Suomisisu,2012-06-15T13:20Z,I'm going to rip the English audio out of this .mkv and then embed it in a 19GB Bluray I have of the Jap version and I'm also going to transfer over the Eng subs. I'll let you know how it works. I want to watch this in full quality if I can and the difference between a 19GB and 3GB rip is huge.
