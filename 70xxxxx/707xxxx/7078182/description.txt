http://ANobleLie.com -Noble Lie: A myth or untruth knowingly told by the elite 
to maintain social harmony, or the social position of the elite.  The 
Republic, Plato

The 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City was a direct blow to the heart of America. 
168 people were killed, including nineteen children.  For those watching the 
nightly news, Terrorism had come home. For years following the bombing, 
countless victims family members, survivors, rescuers, and ordinary 
Americans, have questioned the official accounts about that fateful day.

Hoping to shed light on answers long ignored and censored, both by prominent 
media outlets and the U.S. government, A Noble Lie peels back what we thought 
we knew about the bombing and its perpetrators. This film exposes information 
never before examined or brought to the attention of the American public.

A Noble Lie is the culmination of years of research and documentation 
conducted by independent journalists, scholars, and ordinary citizens. Often 
risking their personal safety and sanity, they have gathered evidence which 
threatens to expose the startling reality of what exactly occurred at 9:02 am 
on April 19, 1995 in Oklahoma City.

Utilizing footage and eyewitness testimony, previously unseen, A Noble Lie 
will change forever the way you look at the true nature of terrorism.
