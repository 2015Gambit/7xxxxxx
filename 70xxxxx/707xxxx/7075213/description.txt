Description

Moom allows you to easily move and zoom windows to predefined areas of the screen, or to make them full-screen, using either the mouse or the keyboard.

When used via the mouse, all you need to do is hover over the green resize button in any Mac OS X window. Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.

When used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.

You can also save window layouts, create custom controls with shortcuts that work globally or work only when Moom's keyboard bezel is onscreen.

Release notes
Moom 2.4 - Feb 28 2012
- New Features

Custom controls can now be chained together, so they run sequentially with just one Moom invocation.

* Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Reorganized Moom's menu bar menu to put often-used commands
  near the top.

* Custom Controls that use F-key shortcuts should now properly show
  in Moom's menus. (Hat tip to Matthias F. for finding this one.)

* Moom now checks if it's hidden at launch, and asks the user to unhide
  if that's the case.

* Fixed a timing issue related to bringing windows in saved layouts to
  the foreground. (Hat tip to Boone S. for finding this one.)

* Fixed an issue that affected some windows with attached sheets. (Hat
  tip to Andy K. for finding this one.)

* Changed the way grid resize and spacing settings interact. (Hat tip to
  Dominik W. for the suggestion.)
