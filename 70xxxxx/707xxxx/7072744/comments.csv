[H],Eppo,2012-03-03T01:07Z,The index system can be off and/or slow at times. Please be patient and the seeds will show :)
,hj.hornbeck,2012-03-03T22:06Z,"Hmm, it's still displaying zero seeders and leechers, even though I see one of each on my end. Oh well, there's an easy fix: to anyone thinking about downloading this torrent, don't trust the numbers. The most recent version of this torrent always has at least one seed!"
