,upskirtsniper,2012-03-05T18:55Z,"Soo does the audio cut out on this version, im guessing yes as it says in the notes, can any1 tell me if its worth getting now or should i wait for a better copy?

thanks"
,upskirtsniper,2012-03-05T19:07Z,"Why is it so difficult to get a decent 720p, ""missing audio 42:18-end"" great and this is the BEST torrent available at this time, no offence intended to the uploader i always use ur walking dead torrents and am truly greatfull but why is the audio missing, and why has it failed to crop"
