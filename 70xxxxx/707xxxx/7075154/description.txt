Pretenders II is the second studio album by British rock band the Pretenders.

The success of the Pretenders' debut album in 1980 created a great demand for 
more material from the fledgling band; however, a lack of songs precluded the 
quick release of a followup album. In the UK, the band released two hit singles 
in 1980 and early 1981, "Message of Love", and "Talk of the Town". In the US, 
where standalone singles had become rare, these tracks were combined with three 
others for a stopgap EP release called Extended Play, in March 1981. Their second 
album, Pretenders II, was released a scant two months later, to mixed critical 
reception, partly because two of the better songs on the album had been previously 
released, and partly because many of the songs were viewed as overly-similar 
(though not quite as groundbreaking) to the band's debut. Nevertheless, several 
of the album's songs became hits and the album has increased in critical stature 
with time.
