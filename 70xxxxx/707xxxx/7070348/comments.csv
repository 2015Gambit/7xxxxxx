,simolino,2012-03-02T21:08Z,"@ivanhoe68 Beta patch haha you're a fucken moron. This one IS the real one idiot! The one's who are supposed to test their fucking patch is BETHESDA, not scene crackers...so SKIDROW is supposed to fix the fact that their stupid fucken patch doesn't work. NO. They only fix it so you can install the patch, they don't fix the goddamned patch and therefore the goddamned game and do extra work that really they aren't supposed to be doing, because of Betheda's stupidity."

,micnor14,2012-03-06T23:56Z,"I'm getting weird save issues, apart from the game just not working anymore. Save games are saved outside the regular directory, and are prefixed with NULL, not to mention adding save games to the same directory doesn't work for some dumb reason. Arrr. Clean copy of Reloaded's here on WIN7 x64 of course. Might try downgrading in a minute. "
