,yaminkhan,2012-03-14T17:56Z,how is this film can anyone tell me plz
,resmith,2012-05-02T09:01Z,"Are the BULGARIAN subtitles listed below in a srt file or are they hard coded? This is one of the reasons why I hate the magnetic torrents, you can't see what your downloading. The file says it has 5 items in it but when I open the folder in the early download I  can only see the sample, the 700 mb & text nfo."
,TheStrobe,2012-05-03T20:28Z,resmith you are a fool.  just click on the files number and you can see whats included in the torrent.  simple
,H6imdall,2012-05-03T22:40Z,"The subtitles are in a srt file so u can hide or delete them if u want. Besides the quality is something like 9 / 9, so thx for the job !"
,resmith,2012-05-05T02:25Z,"A V 10 all good. TheStrobe I've been doing this for over 10 years as long as you've been on this planet it sounds. When I open a torrent with the magnetic link, the box where the listing of the files from the torrent are all greyed out. I don't know if it's my os or maybe utorrent is causing my problems as my utorrent has been reinstalled. If you check around other people have this same issue so don't  be such a GD smart a$$."
