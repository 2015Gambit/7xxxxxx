To make these mods playable, you need to place the contents of each one of the folders included on the pack on the folder 'mods': 
'C:\Users\*Username*\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2011\mods\'

Each mod is a .zip file, so no decompressing is needed. The mods 'installed' should appear in-game on the Store tab named 'Mods'.
