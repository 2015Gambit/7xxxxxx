Typinator is for you if you've ever experienced the tedium and frustration of having to repeatedly type your name, e-mail address, home page url, and other words or phrases again, again and again. Or if you frequently need to quickly insert images like your signature, location plan, or company logo into documents.

Typinator boosts your productivity and eliminates errors by automating the process of inserting frequently used text and graphics and and auto-correcting typos and misspelled words.

Configuration is easy - You just define abbreviations and their replacement text or picture.
