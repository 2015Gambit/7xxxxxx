,DiabloTheCritic,2012-03-07T03:18Z,STILL CANT SEE ALL  THE FILES IN THE TORRENT.....REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING.
,elche1369,2012-03-07T09:09Z,Thanks for the up amigo!
,j.t.,2012-03-07T10:59Z,"to diablo
just click on the top of the page to 
Files: (number)....and voila!
and stop whining."
,armchair.53,2012-03-07T13:21Z,"I'd also like to raise the issue about not being able to select which files in the torrent I want to download.  In this case, there are 4 files including a sample file.  The only file I want is the actual movie.  This problem just started happening recently and I don't understand it and have thus far been unable to get an answer about it.  So if anyone knows, please comment.  There is a workaround however.  Once the torrent gets connected, click on the FILE tab (I'm using Bittorrent 7.6) and you will see all the files.  In this case there are 4.  Then right click on each file and it gives you the option to ""don't download"" - you also have the option of setting the priority of the files.

Anyway, thanks LegendET for sharing."
,balrog814,2012-03-07T14:47Z,"crap. horror turns into drama. very, very few frights. Watch Insidious instead :o"
,jayhanton,2012-03-07T22:56Z,its called a magnet link you fucking moron....google it then fuck off!
,dayglo666,2012-03-08T00:26Z,jayhanton that kind of comment makes you a bigger moron than anyone else

Answer: GET A BETTER AND NEWER CLIENT THE ONE YOUR USING IS OBVIOUSLY CRAP, JEEZ!"
,Rush,2012-03-08T21:58Z,"@DiabloTheCritic... I'll type slow so you can get it 

1. start torrent/link just like any other
2. click on ""files tab"" in uTorrent (could be different name in vuse etc.)
3. wait for individual files to appear (may take 30 sec to 1 min.)> now hit pause
4. RIGHT click all files to trash>select do not download
5. untick pause.. Only ""target file/files will now start"
,Rush,2012-03-08T22:10Z,"@armchair.53... yea that function/window will not work in most all clients until the new versions catch up. 

Close that window or better yet go to UI pref. and don't even let it open... cause it's useless with magnet links. 

THEN read the above post^^^^^ follow closely and  DONE.... I figured this shit out in 5 min.  and I'm no techie... WTF."
,mcrackin1,2012-03-09T00:37Z,"I use the latest version of uTorrent. I click on ""Get this torrent"" and the regular window appears, but no files are in it. I've tried fucking around with it myself and I can't figure it out. The ""helpful"" comments in here don't make any sense. The problem is when uTorrent automatically pops up, it has a window that appears that allowed to to select/deselect files in the .torrent you want to download. There are NO FILES in this window, you can't download any files associated with the .torrent file. When I try downloading the .torrent, it appears in uTorrent but nothing downloads because I haven't selected anything and I CANT select anything."

,kdgang,2012-03-09T19:29Z,"@mcrackin1
even when you dont see any files at popup window its there, just click on ok and wait 30 sec and it will d/l then do as above comment to select files to dont download"
,Chaos5364,2012-03-09T19:31Z,does this torrent has multiple languages or spanish subtitles? I would really like to know before downloading. getting external subtitles with the right synch can be a pain in the %$#!
,kdgang,2012-03-09T19:33Z,"@mcrackin1 
even if you dont see any files at popup window when you click on magnet link its there.  Just click ok and wait 30 sec it will start d/l, then do as above comment to select files you dont want to d/l"
,Stabs555,2012-03-10T01:57Z,To anyone complaining about not being able to select the files you want to download it is because of the magnet links. If you are using Utorrent you can click files and then right click on the files you don't want downloaded and select Don't download. Hope this helps!
,Spudy123,2012-03-10T03:20Z,Quality's not that good A5/V6
,Dulle,2012-03-10T06:17Z,"This is NOT a horror movie. There's about 10-15 seconds of scary stuff in it combined through the whole movie. The ghost is NOT malevolent.
It's a drama for middle aged women who want a cute story that will keep them on edge.
Just thought I'd warn those of you who are expecting to see a scary horror movie, you will be disappointed."
,5h0Gun,2012-03-10T07:50Z,"It's not a horror movie, it's a suspense thriller, two very different things."
,kawnilsen,2012-03-10T14:41Z,"The problem with not understanding the 'Files tab' might be that you have closed ur tabs.. Open up utorrent/magnet link and look in the down-right corner of utorrent, if u have closed the tabs u will see two arrows pointing upward, click on this and the tabs will come up. Then select the torrent u are downloading and press on 'Files' in the tabs menu, now follow the instructions Rush posted ^"
,jboydgolfer,2012-03-11T05:45Z,"If your really having trouble getting how to only get the files you want out of the torrent, open the file selection in your torrent client and select (dont download) for all the files you dont want.Then all that will be downloaded is the movie.{For those who are still having trouble with the change over}."
,jboydgolfer,2012-03-11T05:46Z,Oh rush already said that.Well like he said then.

Thanks LegendET and to all seeders.
Pretty scary movie if you'll watch it at 00:00 hours, lights off, and you're alone. Trust me, I did it. Not that scary though but at least there's a bit of goosebumps."
