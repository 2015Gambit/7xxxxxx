,hawkesk57,2012-03-03T00:34Z,"At the risk of seeming ignorant, is pb forcing us to use the ""utorrent"" downloader?  I've been using bittorrent for years, and lately I've seen a disturbing trend when trying to get a torrent - it attempts to download a blank file, and the ""fix"" is to use utorrent.  What am I missing?"
