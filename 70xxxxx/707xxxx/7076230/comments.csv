,Mahabaza,2012-04-06T21:46Z,thx for uploading :) so this is Sora no Otoshimono or Sora no Otoshimono Forte ? And what is the quality? 1080p or 720p or something else?
,Drakolich,2012-05-30T17:47Z,Quality is 720p and 1080p... you can figure wich is wich by the screen size...

,youwannaroll,2012-09-26T14:05Z,"w.t.f... x264 (lower qual) video.. and FLAC (lossless) audio... 17.5 gigs for essentially a 26ep series, and extra clips? 

i don't hate quality, but FLAC audio is a bit crazy when matched with x264 video. actually, FLAC audio is just crazy, period.

anyone seen a similar torrent with reasonable filesizes?"
