,Arlington,2012-03-10T06:18Z,"I did exactly as told, and the entire list of airports comes up on the FD app under Term charts.

But, when i go to click a chart, the message says- ""the requested chart is not in the library. Contact Jeppesen Technical Support""

What am I doing wrong here?"
,darkristy,2012-03-10T15:11Z,"Thks Radeanus
but i have the same probleme as Arlington
it works perfectly with jeppTC but can't see charts in jeppFD.
any solution plz?"
,captaind,2012-03-11T07:06Z,How do you move these files to the iPad?  Does it need to be jailbroken?
,JPFT2010,2012-03-14T18:46Z,"Hi everyone,

I cracked the Jeppesen TC Ipad version but with the tutorial you gave us is not possible to crack Jeppesen FD Ipad for update 1205. Anyone has the same problem? If you have it working explain me how to do it. Thank you"
,IPilot,2012-03-15T13:40Z,"Hi dear, tank you for you post. 
Everyone should be having the same problem as me. 
In the files posted by you and no route waypoint were updated, I believe that the files should have been done before routing updates take effect. Would it be possible you post a new file path for us!
Thank you so much for everything!!!!!!!"
,IPilot,2012-03-17T03:45Z,"I also cant use.
My version of mobile fd is 1:04! 
I believe the the files of enroute data have a problem.
I can only use terminal charts it's perfect run."
,hamster123,2012-03-25T10:43Z,"Just to be curious, is the data of JeppFD is the same as JeppTC? If it is, why do we have to worry about the chart data in JeppFD?"
,PA46T,2012-03-25T17:18Z,"If I want a VFR Europe coverage, it's possible with Jepp FD or TC ?? "
,silent8,2012-03-31T00:05Z,how do you install the FD and TC on the Ipad from this? sorry for such a newbi question...
,JPFT2010,2012-04-01T05:46Z,I did everything like explained for cycle 1205 FD ipad and it doesnt work. I replaced every folder and put the new ones. Can someone post here how to do it? As me there is lot of people with the same problem. Regards
