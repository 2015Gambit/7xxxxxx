,madcat209,2012-03-04T21:04Z,Holy hell.. she is amazing!  Is this her only set?  I would KILL to see more!
[V],bestec1234,2012-03-04T22:58Z,":) Yes, this is Emma's first set."
[V],bestec1234,2012-03-04T23:50Z,"Interesting.  I've known for a while that someone will like any model I post, regardless of how attractive I think she is.  I personally don't like this model.  (I don't like the shape of her breasts.) I wasn't sure how popular she would be.  Nice to see a favorable response, then. 

nadine-j.de has had other models that only appeared in one set, but most of their models do have multiple sets.  I think we'll probably see more of her."
,madcat209,2012-03-05T01:40Z,"I have to admit, perhaps i am a weird one, but i particularly like her breasts (perhaps larger nipples are what gets me); and i think she has an amazing face.

Ah well, you are right; somebody out there likes everyone.  If it isn't too much trouble, if you do find another set (her ""bio page shows her on a bed, which is not in this set), please think of me. ;)"
