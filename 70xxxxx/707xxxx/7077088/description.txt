  In Nov 2010, a group of friends went to     
  a place to shoot their final year project   
  film but never returned.A few days later,   
  their camera was found.What happened with   
  them was captured in the camera. The film   
  is a compilation of the footage found       
  from their camera.This is the first time    
  not only in Indian Cinema but world over    
  that a film is being released without a     
  title. Instead, to describe this unseen,    
  unheard story, all that is used is a symbol,
  ΓÇ£?ΓÇ¥ .It delves into the found footage genre 
  where the lines between reel and real become
  difficult to distinguish.
