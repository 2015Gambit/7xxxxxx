Please let me know if it works for you guys"
,SS64084,2012-03-04T14:46Z,every time you change your wallpaper or Install new GFX drivers you will need to do the above method.
,SS64084,2012-03-04T15:06Z,"step 5 must say ""Right Click Desktop"""
,SS64084,2012-03-04T15:07Z,"oh it was correct, ignore above comment."
,crybaby95,2012-03-04T16:01Z,Why is your torrent only 471 bytes? Windows 8 is about 3 GB. This must be fake
,crybaby95,2012-03-04T16:04Z,"Nevermind, I see what you did. But I can't prove that it works."
,crybaby95,2012-03-04T16:06Z,"This doesn't truly remove the watermark, you are just hiding it. By the way, you have a misleading title."
,SS64084,2012-03-04T16:50Z,"sorry about the title, yes it only hides it, but I think its good enough until somebody release a crack to remove it."
,TheJoesif,2012-03-04T17:10Z,"@crybaby95 if you read the title, it removes watermarks idiot!"
,zaeb,2012-03-06T18:42Z,not bad but i just figured out better way. it hiddes it completely. OPEN PERSONALIZE - GO TO DESKTOP BACKGROUND - CHOOSE FIT - SELECT BACKGROUND COLOR TO WHITE - SWITCH BACK TO FILL. WATERMARK WILL APPEAR EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THEME. REPEAT THIS STEPS FOR EVERY THEME YOU WANT TO USE. WIN 8 CP X64 proly works for x32 also
