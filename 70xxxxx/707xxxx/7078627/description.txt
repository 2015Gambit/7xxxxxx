Back in the gardens there is a royal visit to prepare for when Her Majesty the Queen helps the gardens celebrate their World Heritage Site status although disaster strikes before the visit of Prince Charles and Prince Turki of Saudi Arabia when bad weather forces the gardens to close for the first time in 15 years There is also a unique insight into the pioneering work which is carried out in the laboratories. Each episode introduces some of the gardens monthly highlights and problems which all fall within the daily duties of Kews dedicated team of experts. These include preparing for the controversial Chihuly exhibition, creating an authentic Zen garden, a marathon pruning session and feeding the carnivorous plants.
