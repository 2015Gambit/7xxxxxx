I had my xbox flashed a couple of years ago, just downpatched the games. Since Skyrim I flashed it myself.. Skyrim didn't work but my other burned games still did.

Does this mean I flashed it wrong and it reverted? (That seems a bit impossible?)
Or does that mean that the Skyrim was burned wrong?

Thanks in advance!"

,bokenzo,2012-03-04T12:19Z,"Hey everybody

I am having serious problems with the burning of this game.

I have burned several XPG games but this doesn't seem to work after using 5 disc's :-(

When I insert the game in my Xbox which is modded with LT 2.0, it reads the disc fine as ""Mass Effect 3"" but when I press Play, it says ""Disc is not supported"" :s

The way I have burned the disc's is:
Burned with either 2.4x or 4x in speed
Burned with Dual Layer 8x Disc's

When that didn't work I tried using the final fantasy XII-2 topology method to patch from 3.0 to 2.0 but it still doesn't work :s

I have simply run out of ideas to burn this game :s

Can you guys please help me? :-)"

Nothing, you just keep burning them untill you get a quality burn, each time you burn the outcome is  diffrent."

I just can't spare a lot more disc's. I only have 3 left :-(

Did you use the final fantasy XII-2 topology method on the ISO? :s

Or did you just keep on burning them until it worked?

By the way do you have LT 2.0 or 3.0 because I have 2.0?"

@boobsman...you really impress with how quickly you get torrents posted. How do you get the advanced copies?  I probably don't need to know...just happy its there.

For those having problems burning this. You wanna defrag your drive, go to msconfig and under the start up tab you'll wanna unchecked all this options except the windows ones. Enabale all the features on your Ibadan drive. Enable OPC, and burnoroof. That should give you a good burn...oh and use kprobe to make sure you disc numbers look good. "

Im using LT3.0, just run the image through ABGX360, it's the master topology and already patched so there is really no work to be done, honestly i even checked the ID's and everything matches.

I just burn untill i get a good quality copy, they never fail me, and i've now been playing Mass Effect 3 for 19 hours, on both CD's, its working fantasticly and this game is awesome just as the previous games :)

,revolver75,2012-03-05T14:08Z,"@homdawg why dont you try this.
1.download iso
2. run through abgx 2 check if all is ok
3. then patch with the ff13 data
4. then straight into imgburn layerbreak 2133520
5. burn at 2.4x only at 4x if no other option
6. check the verify box to have imgburn verify the burn that way if it fails at say 49-50% then you know theres some problem with the layerbreak and know were to look to fix the problem if there is one.
burning at 2.4x and verifying the write will take a while prob an hr or so but a good rule of thumb is slower burn better results hope this helps m8 let me know and as for the game its awsome been on non stop for two days im still seeding to uploaded 53.7gig."

 lol no sorry 2 = to
just a bad habit with me writing it that way.
i always use the latest abgx and imgburn i also have the max ihas burner which helps to reduce problems to.

lt+3.0 down to lt+2.0.

1. download game iso
2. run through abgx to check if all is ok with iso
3. then patch with the ff13 data
4. then straight into imgburn layerbreak 2133520
5. burn at 2.4x only at 4x if no other option
6. check the verify box to have imgburn verify

done."
,Daky1001,2012-03-05T22:18Z,"@revolver75 Oh,OK then.
I did all that except verifying in imgburn and I don't have Ihas burner.
Are those two important for successfull burn?
Also,I found another guy who said that if I don't have Ihas burner that I should select user specified and use 2086912 layerbreak,what do you think of that?
I really appreciate your help and time! :)"
,revolver75,2012-03-05T23:10Z,the verify could tell you were the problem is but it makes no diffrence to the burn the ihas drive does though as you get 100% of the img and other drives its like 97% as for the layer break ive never used that one i have ihas and i use user specified 2133520 but what have you got to lose if your still using truncate just go through the steps again but instead do user specified 2086912 again 2.4x burn and if you verify the burn and it fails at say 50% then you know theres a layerbreak problem you can skip verify but it may help you identify the problem.

I tried to run this game through abgx360 but it says isnt recognised as an iso or stealth file. Burned with imgburn but failed check and didnt work on my 360. I see people on here talking about using certain topologies to get this to work. Im a bit confused as I was told as Im on 2.0 I dont need them. Should I download the latest abgx360 or not?

,revolver75,2012-03-06T19:18Z,"@daky1001
dont know what else to try m8 there a lot of factors imgburn and abgx should be the latest versions thats easy after that is all diffrent burner imgburn settings discs layerbreak etc i did look into that layerbreak i get why they use that for non ihas burners.

1. download game iso
2. run through abgx to check if all is ok with iso BEFORE you patch with final fantasy 13 topology data.
3. then patch with the ff13 data http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6999991/Final_Fantasy_13-2_XBOX360_LT3.0_ISO_Patch_To_LT2.0_
4. then straight into imgburn layerbreak 2086912 USER SPECIFIED
5. burn at 2.4x only at 4x if no other option
6. check the verify box to have imgburn verify again keep saying it but if you verify and it fails then we can target the problem plz verify if it fails verifacition at 49-50% the problem is the layerbreak.

this is your best bet dont use abgx after you patch with ff13 data it will remove the patch you just put in place.

only other thought is tell me what you do step by step but a lot of factors do come into play with burner type settings for said burner and imgburn settings along with diffrent layerbreaks for example i use ihas max burner i have settings both for my burner and imgburn and i use LB 2133520 and i burn 100% of the iso i dont have to worry about topology data cause my xbox drive is samsung i have read a lot into the topoogy prosess and do understand it theres just so many variations m8."
,fanfasnight,2012-03-06T19:49Z,"Well i give up maybe im just stupid  , tried everything abgx then injected the file then imgburn then burn and i still get unsupported disk lol well enjoy the game guys"
,Daky1001,2012-03-06T20:52Z,"@0revolver75 I did use abgx before,and after I patched with FF13 3.0 to 2.0 I went straight to imgburn.I set to 2086912 user specified and to 2.4X.I also clicked verify and it stopped at 50% telling me there is an error.However when I set to 2133520 and cheked verify it didn't show an error but when I tryed to play it the X360 showed disc is unsuported or something like that.Funny thing is that before abgx 1.0.6 came out I was able to play XGD3 games.I have one more question: Would I have this problems if I upgrade my X360 to iXtreme LT+3.0?"
,deathdealer1977,2012-03-06T21:18Z,"ABGX already has the first disc verified, and I am sure the second is coming....why not just wait a few hours and run it through ABGX to get a proper topology"
,revolver75,2012-03-06T21:36Z,"@daky1001 ""I did use abgx before,and after "" theres your 1st problem abgx before the patch NOT after m8 do not use abgx after you patch with ff13 data go straight to burn ok.

2nd if you got no errors with 2133520 then thats what you use 2133520 user specified.

try the above way abgx then patch then straight to burn NO abgx after you patch burn using user specified 2133520
n that should be you.

yes updating to lt+3.0 will solve 90% of your problems if you also get a cheap ihas burner and flash with the max firmware you will solve 99% problems all thats left then is program settings easy enough.
one thing to note though when you upgrade to lt+3.0 you will have to rip and reburn all your previous games after running through abgx for topology lt+3.0 update to make all your games compatable and all games you used truncate on in the past you wont be able to rip those discs to img as they dont contain the full img so redownload and back all game iso up to a hdd i do i have 300gb of games on an external drive incase of stuff like this good luck m8 keep trying."
,revolver75,2012-03-06T21:50Z,"@deathdealer1977
because even then the topology will only be compatabile with lt+3.0 and will update as such which is no good for these people like daky1001 on lt+2.0."
,Daky1001,2012-03-06T22:46Z,"@revolver75 No,you misunderstood me.I said that I used abgx before patching and after I patched I went straight to imgburn."
,revolver75,2012-03-06T23:10Z,"@daky1001
dont know what to tell you m8 should be working the method has been confirmed to work maybe down to settings in imgburn goolge and youll find some settings to try out but once you get its done and worth it good luck."
,Daky1001,2012-03-06T23:43Z,@revolver75 I'll send my X360 to a store that will modify it with LT3.0.We'll see will it work after that.

i ran abgx, and it went through perfectly and burnt it like the guide said, and then tried another copy with overburn. on optimal layerbreak and on the specifc ones people have mentioned. the truncated copies work, but they freeze, get to the loading screen and just stop working, and/or when i try to install it, it stops at 49& and then says the disc is unreadable and scratched.

then, even though i have lt 3.0 i used the ff13 path and tried to burn a couple copies that way as well (those all didnt even work)"

always use verbatim made in singapore only(mkm003 or mkm001)..
u will also need to verify ur burns with imgburn(should be 100% verified) and kprobe..
kprobe should be

PI MAX should be 100 or less & PI Average should be 5 or less
PIF MAX should be 4 or less & PIF Average should be 0.20 or less
Nero Score should be no less than 90"

Message to anonymous…..

Your ideas so far have been good mostly ineffectual.  it is good that we are waking up but we need to all get together and have an idea Jacuzzi, toss some ideas around….. So here is my little list of ideas so far.  Some are bad.
Some are impossible.
But if another anon can do what I cannot do maybe as a people we can fight back!!!



I cannot hack!

But here is my wish list if I could …...

****************

I would hack a large supermarket chain and get hold of a full list of buying prices.  (lets see how much profit these corporations make on our daily food).
****************
Hack the education board and get the learning material for each and every subject and post it on the net!  Free of charge!!  The cost of buying education is an abomination to the human species and is solely to keep people uninformed and / or in debt.  Let people teach themselves…..   If education was free... over time we could challenge the elite.
****************
Create a better internet search engine….. Google has gone against its ""don't be evil"" motto… it is now evil!   We need a truly uncensored search net engine.
****************
Create a better alternative to facebook…. No ads… no spying….  If we could cut of the feds from all this free info. They would pap themselves.
****************
Create a better YouTube….  Traffic shaping is hiding the truth videos from the public
****************
Free VPN's for all….. I don't want my ISP knowing what type of porn I like thank you very much.  Its my business only.
****************
Can someone set up an anonymous store?!  A place to buy masks. Posters, stickers, banners, merchandize about anonymous  (needs to be non profit).  I want to let my town know that I am anonymous and so are they….
****************
Can anyone think of a way to make mobile phone SMS messages and phone calls encrypted?  I PAY a lot for my phone…. The fact that is not private, sickens me…..
****************

These are my first ideas….  If you can help…please help….Can anyone add to this list??   Please add your idea and pass it on…..


WE are anonymous, WE are legion, WE are all of us.


Please post this in the most inappropriate places and help it spread...

,helreyzer,2012-03-21T04:49Z,"Thank you very much boobsman!

I know the game is working for most of you so the problem is on my side. Thing is, I have no idea what I am doing wrong.

Dashboard is 14699
LT+ 3.0 and my drive is a benq
DVD is a ihas with ixtreme mod

I tried burning with both memorex (the right ones) and verbatim (also the right ones) the first disc with the following settings (layer break = 2133520):
-Burn straight from the download (fail, cant see game image, cant installl)
-Apply master topology (fail, cant see game image, cant install)

I tried downgrading to LT+ 2.0 and the following settings:
-(Another burner 97%) Layer break = 2086912, apply ffx13-2 patch (fail, but can see game image and can install 100%, game wont load)
-(Another burner 97%) Layer break = 2133520, apply ffx13-2 patch (fail, but can see game image and can install 100%, game wont load)
-(IHas burner 100%) Layer break = calculate optimal, apply ffx13-2 patch (fail, but can see game image and can install 100%, game wont load)

Therefore, i reflashed to LT+ 3.0 and tried all my  10 dvds. Not one loaded. Im running out of ideas, all my burn has been working so far, except for KOA:R which has the same tendency of pissing me off and not working.
