On my Bravia which doesn't upscale movies the picture's slightly blurry and blown up and looks like an upscale of the dvdrip on PB.

,painkilleradnan,2012-03-04T22:58Z,thanks YIFY......u r da bst uploader......keep it up...
,fofo141,2012-03-05T00:29Z,Thank you so much YIFY
,Obiwancanblome69,2012-03-06T06:41Z,Why does this uploader keep putting these small file non highres movies in the highres section? None of them are anywhere close to HD. Why don't the MODs do something about this?
,stonner89,2012-03-06T09:37Z,"@Obiwancanblome69  this rips are good for watching in Desktop, and some people has low bandwidth so it's useful for them."
,theeccentrik,2012-03-10T06:41Z,"@stonner89 you don't put a fuckin file in a category based on the screen size/type of the downloader, it's the file quality.
I bet your the type of guy who heaps praise on someone who has uploaded a blank screen just because he took the time to do it!! (not YIFY btw)
Credit where it's due
Criticism when it's poor.      my 2 cents! lol"
