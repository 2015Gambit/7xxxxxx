Yelawolf - Radioactive (Deluxe Edition) iTunes

Note- I didn't like Yelawolf at all, thought Em was just making some money off him but after listening to Throw It Up with Gangsta Boo and Em I couldn't help but listen to other songs and found the album to be pretty damn good. Impressive even. Definatly worth the download if you havn't heard any of the songs.

If you have heard is Hard White (the reason I thought he was shit), the rest of the songs are nothing like that.  Most have a little meaning behind it too.  So take a listen atleast, you won't regret it.
