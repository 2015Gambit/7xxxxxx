Rodney meets Vicky, a seemingly impoverished artist who
it transpires is the daughter of the Duke of Maylebury.
Having obtained a pair of tickets to the sold-out
production of Carmen, Rodders seems to have deeply
impressed Vicky. She is less taken by the presence of
Del and his peroxide blonde dolly bird. Especially when
they open the crisps. Vicky then invites Rodney to a
party at the Dukeâ™s country home, and it seems romance
may be on the cards. Then Del Boy turns up, hits the
vino-plonko and ruins everything for his little brother.
