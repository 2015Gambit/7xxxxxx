All TPB ""torrents"" with more that 10 seeders are now magnet links.  you can upgrade your torrent client should be fine.  Utorrent picks them up with no problems at all."

the book is way better than this holywood thing. If you like lots of violence and sex of course. But it's the bestseller, right?"
,afranc,2012-03-10T03:57Z,I don't know how this thing is encoded but if you try to fast foward on iTunes / quicktime / appletv you won't be able to (black screen). It's a shame rips looks good and plan ok on vlc
,pezed,2012-03-27T21:02Z,Very nice. Thank you Mr. Froggie.
,Bud625,2012-04-23T05:39Z,"Good file

Personally I thought the original Swedish version was way better. I could see how this version would appeal most (US) people though. Nothing wrong with that I suppose if that's your thing. I just suggest giving the Swedish version a shot first."
,master_b415,2012-04-26T01:51Z,well done by me A9 - V9...ty  +1 here
,fslaker,2012-05-17T18:03Z,"Weird... TPB also doesn't show magnet links to me despite me having the lastest uTorrent.
Maybe it's because I'm Firefox :("
