                           DESCRiPTiON 
                          
 ITV News business editor Laura Kuenssberg compares pay, benefits and pensions in the 
 public and private sectors to try to determine which employees are better off. She 
 looks into the stories about long lunch breaks and jobs for life, finding that 
 people in both sectors imagine the grass is greener on the other side.
                                        
                                 Enjoy!
