,indiazer0,2012-03-03T18:36Z,*I meant: is there a torrent file for this torrent file? lol. the one with the three green arrows pointing downwards.
,Pirat47,2012-03-03T22:39Z,Use uTorrent - magnets cannot be easier with it + it's the tiniest one.
,Pirat47,2012-03-03T22:40Z,"And nope, there isn't a torrent for it."
,Pirat47,2012-03-03T22:46Z,"The topic has been up so many times, but ok...
If you have uTorrent be sure to use it to open magnets AUTOMATICALLY - it means, if you click magnet link for the first time Firefox will ask you which program to use to open it - select uTorrent and you are done. 
Next time you are opening a magnet just left click it and that's it. It cannot be easier, right?

If you have a different application set to open magnets then go to Firefox > Tools > Options > Apps (or similar - i don't have an English version) and then find ""magnets"" and choose default program to open them."
