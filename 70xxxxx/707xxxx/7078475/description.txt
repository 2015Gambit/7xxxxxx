Gundam AGE - 21 "Phantoms in the Way"



 Hundreds of years of human colonization of space have finally resulted in a period of lasting peace. However, fourteen years ago, a mysterious foe, the UE (Unknown Enemy), suddenly appeared. Since then, this cruel yet mysterious enemy has destroyed space colonies, and routinely attacked other targets. A victim of their attack of the space colony Ovan, Flit Asuno was given a family heirloom by his dying mother, the AGE Device memory unit, which contained plans for a mobile suit. In hope of protecting others from the tragedy that had befallen him, Flit began to develop this suit with the help of the Earth Federation in the space colony Nora, and named this suit "Gundam" after the legendary suit developed by his family many years ago. It is now the year A.G. (Advanced Generation) 115. When the UE suddenly attacks Nora, Flit must pilot the Gundam to fight against the UE, thus beginning the Asuno family's century-long battle to protect humanity from the invaders.

Attention please - the encodes use 10-bit H.264 format.
Old H.264 decoders don't work with this and produce corrupt image. You need up-to-date CCCP or FFDShow, CoreAVC 3.0+ or LAV Video decoder. Alternatively MPlayer (July 2011 and newer) or VLC 2.0 and newer. GPU-based decoders *WILL NOT* work - that includes DXVA, VDPAU, the so-called cuda in CoreAVC, or any other hardware decoder. The same goes for standalone players.
