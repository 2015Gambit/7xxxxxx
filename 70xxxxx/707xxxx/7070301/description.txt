Hello guys!

i\\\\\\\'m very very sorry for the delayed upload, but my internet service provider (Ziggo) was ordered to shut down thepiratebay for all the clients of their services. 

So instead of hosting it on another site, i found a workaround ;)


btw , i won\\\\\\\'t be collecting tunes after these two torrents i\\\\\\\'m about to upload. A mate of mine is going to collect tunes and host the torrents for me. 

Hope you all enjoy the heavy dubstep torrent ;)

cheers,
TGDubbs.
