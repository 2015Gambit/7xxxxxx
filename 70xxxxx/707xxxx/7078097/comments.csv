,Arurian,2012-03-05T14:51Z,"why i cant download, click the magnet link..nothing happens, and where is the regular download?"
,sharklazer,2012-03-05T17:45Z,"If the magnet link won't launch, right click it and copy the link address.

Then in your torrent client use the ""Download from a url"" feature and paste in the url.

Alternatively get an updated version of your torrent client and make sure you set this as the application to handle magnet links in your browser."

,2mjolk,2012-03-06T00:01Z,"I understand H.264/MPEG-4 AVC move but why the hell .mp4??
Why no .mkv?
I'm not a specialist but my Samsung tv doesn't like mp4 while it plays AVC x264 in mkv container perfectly. And if the sound is AAC that's another world of pain.
Djeez. this blows."

,RichTUK,2012-03-07T00:48Z,"stop complaining about the container, if you need it to play on another system i.e your tv or you want the .mkv just convert it yourself, doesnt take that long."
,onett_home,2012-03-07T01:29Z,"Chinese dry-cured hams have been recorded in texts since prior to Song dynasty and used in myriad dishes. Several types are existent in Qing dynasty and used in dishes of stewing hams (火腿炖肘子), and vegetables, or for a wide variety of soup and important soup stocks. One of the most famous Chinese hams is the Jinhua ham, a dry-cured ham which is used to produce a dish known as ""Buddha jumps over the wall"". Jinhua ham is used in Chinese cuisines to flavor stewed and braised foods as well as for making the stocks and broths of many Chinese soups. The ham was awarded first prize in the 1915 Panama International Merchandise Exhibition"

,JCD3nton,2012-03-12T13:06Z,"PS3 doesn't work MP4, please upload the AVI version! I can't watch it on my LCD TV."
,etherea1,2012-03-12T18:00Z,"Why is everyone complaining about the file format? Just convert it for gods sake! Its not even a big file. Besides, I convert all my files to DVD format when I burn them to disc so they always play, but now with my bluray player I can just shre them on the network and browse to it on my computer. Theres a million ways to fix your problem, complaining is just... unproductive. "
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-03-12T19:15Z,"I have never seen such a bunch of fucking whiners. If you don't like the file format, you have two fucking choices: (1) don't download the file, or (2) get yourself a fucking converter and convert it yourself. You are not paying for the file, and you all sound like selfish little children bitching at the uploader. Those of you who are complaining are the ones who look like complete asshole losers."
,xtreamzone,2012-03-13T17:15Z,"Amazing TV Series, can't wait for season 3 and The Gov!"
,kitrana,2012-03-13T17:45Z,look not everyone has the time programme or technical wherewithal to convert these files and avi is a far more universally useable file format.
,harry_tuttle101,2012-03-16T15:19Z,"Yeah you cry baby ps3 and xbox users, SHUT THE FUCK UP! You are the MINORITY, and YOU'RE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBS. Shut you whining asses."
,harry_tuttle101,2012-03-16T15:20Z,"Maybe, JUST MAYBE we upload in MP4 just to fuck with you assholes? Ever think of that? NO, why? because you're too busy complaining your bitchy little heads off."
,d32,2012-03-19T19:17Z,"smjreload, you fucking fucker, writing spoilers into the torrent's comments."

,Finan82,2012-04-30T00:49Z,@smjreload What sort of cunt are you? Writing a spoiler in the thread. Dumb bag of shite!
,JulesCow,2012-05-18T00:39Z,"Be careful, I just got an email from my ISP for copyright infringement! Depends what country you're in I guess. That said, I watch all the new EPs now through the-walking-dead.bazinga.li (HD stream, you just need to register).
