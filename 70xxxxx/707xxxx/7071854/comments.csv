 It's simple really, stop using WindowsMediaPlayer to watch things. It's only good use is for music.

 Use VLC instead.

 Not only does it play things better with zero hassle or extras needed, but it has far more options available for tweeking sound/video for when you download lower quality cams and stuff."

Movie was funny up until it gets to the 'tough gangsta' black girl and then all the so-called 'funny racism cause you white' stuff. After that, the acting,plot line and everything else went downhill from there.
But,saying that- good work on the encode extremezone,keep it up!"
