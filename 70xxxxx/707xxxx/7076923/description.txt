WARNING: This PDF file is a complex file and this bootleg release is not fully compliant with the PDF Version 1.7 standard. As a result, it displays incorrectly here and there when using standard-abiding products like Adobe Reader or Acrobat (A warning is usually displayed when this happens). PDF X-Change Viewer (freeware) by Tracker Software  http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-viewer is less fussy with standards and displays the file correctly.

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
