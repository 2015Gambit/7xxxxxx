The truth about the million British horses that
served in World War I is even more epic than
Steven Spielberg's War Horse feature film.

This documentary tells their extraordinary,
moving story, begining with the mass call-up
of horses from every farm and country estate
in the land.

Racing commentator Brough Scott tells the tale
of his aristocratic grandfather General Jack Seely
and his beloved horse Warrior, who would become
the most famous horse of the war.
