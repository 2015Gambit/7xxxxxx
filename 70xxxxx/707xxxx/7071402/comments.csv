,icepilots,2012-03-03T02:17Z,"I also wonder if anyone has figured out how to update FliteMap / FliteStar with this?

In the past, we renamed CD2s label to xxxxFSFM_2 and it worked - with the single DVD, I haven't been able to figure this out as yet..."

,RBA2,2012-03-03T17:57Z,"No need to rename the labels for Flitestar/Flitestar, this new DVD update automaticaly detects and updates all jepp software on the machine."
,edwared,2012-03-03T18:40Z,thankssss
,JAB69,2012-03-05T14:12Z,"Thanks for the upload of DVD (new system) lets see how the Nav Data update works in this new scenario.

Keep up the great work"
,icepilots,2012-03-06T13:23Z,RBA2: It didn't detect the working version of FliteMap on my system - nor did it update anything :(
