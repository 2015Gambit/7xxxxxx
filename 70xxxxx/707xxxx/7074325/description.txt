Sir Paul Newman received a well deserved Oscar (as best actor)
nomination for his Lead role in this movie - the best of men I say!


The movie essentially says this to us:

The absence of malice is what makes the difference as to whether a man is guilty
of rape (no woman can give consent to masochistic urges as they are inherently
mentally unwell that have such tendencies) - and therefore in all cases of what
we call "tort" injuries - we look to the presence and degree of malicious intent
both prima facie and otherwise apparent under the surface in order to determine
guilt and the extent of it - in the harm caused a member of society by another
of its own constituents.

Simple negligence in carrying out ones duties is a different sort of an infraction
in the minds of a reasonable man than would be so in the case of outward
willingness and desire to do harm to someone - (without regard to justice). 
This movie drives that point home.


One of the best movies of our time.

Sally Field gives a great performance "equally"
