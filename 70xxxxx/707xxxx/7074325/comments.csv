,lawman007,2012-03-06T20:52Z,your description of the legal issues in the film is not correct. malice is an element of an action for slander or libel. malice was lacking in the film because the reporter checked the facts before reporting them and they were true.
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2012-03-06T23:21Z,I was merely pointing out that a higher standard ought to apply in case of rape for example. Simple consent shouldn't be construed as legally all there is at stake - certainly morally. And to all affairs therefore of human conduct.
