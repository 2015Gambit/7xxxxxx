,thediego270188,2012-03-07T03:16Z,can you explain me hhow to seed ??? :S
,bumbusz,2012-03-16T22:22Z,"You can seed by simply not stopping the torrent when it's at 100%. Seeding means uploading and that's exactly what you do even while you don't have the full data. You were the one who created the torrent, you should simply stay online and then you're seeding :) Otherwise nobody will ever be able to finish downloading and the torrent's dead"
,KarlPawer,2012-04-20T22:33Z,"Please, seed!!! thediego270188, just stay online with your torrent client open and don't stop the torrent you created - it will seed as long as you don't close your client or stop the torrent."
,dunwellr,2012-04-30T12:44Z,This collection is dead unless someone starts seeding again...:-(  Too bad. The colleciton looks very attractive.
,DamnPC,2012-05-02T03:51Z,"Wow this looks great. If I'm able to download all that I need, which depending on the files should be most of the torrent, I will try to seed at least 1000% probably more afterwards.

PLEASE SEED. :("

I wanted to ask you a favor. I'm learning Greek and  I would really appreciate if there was a possibility that you somehow send me only the Greek part of this torrent ( for example, upload it somewhere else), because the download speed is very slow.
here is my E-mail:
mega131@hotmail.com
You would really help me.
Thanks in advance!"
