,budzman700,2012-04-17T05:22Z,"hey if your having problems running the game on windows 7 , change your screen resolution to 800 x 600 and it will work have fun :D"
,DACreech,2012-05-10T18:11Z,"This game is very easy to install and plays great. I even have it on my lap top.  1.Extract 2. ISO mount 3. Install   No Key Gen needed. No Crack needed.  No Copy /paste needed.  Just install and play it.  As simple as that.  Cool game by the way!  Definately one of the best games I've DL'd on PB.

Thank You esharoth for this awesome upload!"

,vicoux,2012-06-05T00:45Z,"Works perfectly, just need to mount the iso ( i used virtual clone drive ) and it was fast to install, nothing else needed, perfect. Thanks man. great game btw"
,BigJoeJoyce,2012-06-13T22:13Z,"When I try to open ""setup_empire_earth_2_gold.exe"" I get the message ""checking file integrity, please wait"" and a bar loads up but after that nothing at all happens. Anyone have any suggestions? Also I can't mount 'cause there's no iso and can't extract because it's not a rar file."
,whitman5,2012-06-14T08:16Z,Came out clean with AVG and Avira before installation and AVG after installation. Installs cleanly. The only hitch so far is it can't connect to a game hosted by a retail cd version of 1.2.
[T],esharoth,2012-07-23T18:01Z,"What iso file are you people talking about? It's the GOG version of the game, they provide games in the form of simple installers."
,ROFLMTO,2012-07-31T10:03Z,"If the game doesn't start and keeps minimising and you can't do anything, make the game windowed by added the following lines to config.cfg (or config_EE2X.cfg for the expansion):
g_bFullscreen = 0
g_allowWindowedMode = 1
g_ConstrainCursor = 0
s_windowXOffset = 10
s_windowYOffset = 10
s_adapterIndex = 0 

That worked for me."
,MagicManPC,2012-08-19T00:06Z,"If you're not familiar with Gog.com (Good Old Games) you should check out their site. 

They revive old games, remove DRM, include all the latest patches and updates, and they make them work with most of the latest Windows Operating Systems. Most games are only $9.99 or $5.99 and sometimes you can get them on sale for 50% off. It's a great way to enjoy older games.

Oh yah, and there's no ISO's they just use a single executable to install the games."
