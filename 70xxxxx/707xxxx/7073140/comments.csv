,beaujoulais,2012-03-03T10:18Z,thanks - Q: which category of music this song and interpretion may belong to ? 
,pupovaczlatko,2012-03-03T10:35Z,"        According to music critic Richie Unterberger of allmusic, ""Several songs on 1964's Beatles for Sale, as well as ""I'll Cry Instead"" from A Hard Day's Night, had leaned in a country and western direction. But 'I've Just Seen a Face' was almost pure country, taken at such a fast tempo that it might have been bluegrass if not for the absence of banjo and fiddle."" 
      McCartney has stated, “It was slightly country and western from my point of view... it was faster, though, it was a strange uptempo thing. I was quite pleased with it. The lyric works; it keeps dragging you forward, it keeps pulling you to the next line, there’s an insistent quality to it that I liked.” "

I've had to use some new ( to me ) software to get it, but all seems to be fine.
Happy days."
,beaujoulais,2012-03-03T15:25Z,Wow Zlatko! You're a great music analyst. Deep thanks from a music & Zlatko fan!
,beaujoulais,2012-03-03T22:47Z,"Dear Zlatko! Even I learned much abount music categories from you, I'm not able to classify group ""Garbage"" - OK, they once belonged to the 'indies', but is this an exact valuation ? Please help me in this case, too. Thanks, Beaujoulais"
,pupovaczlatko,2012-03-04T00:19Z,"Garbage are an alternative rock band. Garbage's sound has often been described, not only by the band and fans, but also by critics, as being alternative rock, post-grunge, electronic. During the early days of the band, some songs such as ""Only Happy When It Rains"" and ""Stupid Girl"" were described as grunge, whilst some disagreed. Steve Marker (guitar, keyboards) saying that the band wanted to ""take pop music and make it as horrible sounding as we can.""  Butch Vig (drums, percussion) has said the crossover-heavy sound was inspired by the band's background with remixes, where songs would be rearranged to every musical style to which they held interest, and also that he ""grew up listening to everything from pop radio and opera to country music and polka, so I really though that Garbage would be an interesting and eclectic thing to do.""

        The first alternative music was made in the late 60s with groups like The Velvet Underground, Iggy and the Stooges, MC5, and The Silver Apples. The trend continued through out the 70s with bands like David Bowie, Can, Neu, Kraftwerk, Television and The New York Dolls.In the early eighties alternative music was limited to a few college radio stations. In the mid 80s as it became more popular  In the late 80s commercial stations slowly began to embrace what up till then had been known as college rock.  Alternative Rock remained in the underground for many years and, aside from occasional exceptions like R.E.M. and The Cure, met with little commercial success. 
        Indeed, the use of the word ""alternative"" in its name indicated that it was something outside the mainstream of rock music.  However, the runaway success of Nirvana in 1991 changed all that and catapulted Alternative Rock to the forefront of popular music

2) several youtube videos are not released for Germany - so I neither can't play nor record them 
Video ""Angelfish - Suffocate Me"" is a good example - but maybe somone may rip it for me ...
Thanks 2u & peace from Germany, beaujoulais"
