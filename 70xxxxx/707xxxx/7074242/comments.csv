,00mex00,2012-05-21T04:08Z,@paskoxbox  Well.. good luck out there.. u need to evolve or die.. it's the law!
,Recludere,2012-06-11T01:47Z,"@paskoxbox For one, why did you come to The Pirate Bay to tell everybody you stopped downloading from The Pirate Bay? That's like going to a restaurant to tell everybody you're not going to eat there. Second, uTorrent is the best client there is and you are foolish for refusing to use it or even try it. Good day sir."
,mr2old,2012-07-04T22:03Z,I use BitTorrent...   no idea if there is a difference
