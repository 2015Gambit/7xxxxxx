This is the pilot of the Billy the Cat series, originally made by Colman and Desberg. It's quite a nice series, and it's a shame that it was never translated to another language than Dutch or French. This pilot even was never published as a comic book, it was only published in Journal de Spirou in 1982. I'm sorry to say that I did not have all the pages in French available, so most of them were translated from the Dutch version. This is my very first own scanning/cleaning job, so please comment on how well it went!

There's also a television series loosely based on this comic, but more light and for a younger audience. I hope fans of that television series (which was translated into English) enjoy this fan translation of the pilot, which I aptly named "Billy the cat: The Pilot", and ask for more, or that a new audience is intrigued by this comic.

I would also like corrections on my grammar and spelling, and general word usage.
If my sentences are weird, please correct me, then I'll upload a new version with the corrections included.

When an official release is released, this torrent will probably be deleted. You have been warned.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use *.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
