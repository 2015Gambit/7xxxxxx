Storyline: 'Padre Padrone' in Flanders. Farmer Vermeulen rules his estate like an old school patriarch, stern and authoritarian. Rivalry between father and son steadily increases as son Louis has his own ideas on where to seed and when to harvest the flax. A typical setting for the classic generation conflict between father and son, which ends in a vicious beating by the farmer, that leaves his son crippled for ever.

The novel had been filmed before, during WWII (1943) as 'Wenn die Sonne wieder scheint' (When The Sun Shines Again) by Nazi director Boleslav Barlog. Interesting to know is that the location of the original story from the novel is about the area where Hitler served as a soldier during the First World War.
After the War, author Stijn Streuvels was severely criticized for collaborating with the German occupier during the making of this first film.
