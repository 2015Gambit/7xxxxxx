,johnofaus,2012-03-03T09:06Z,"What's this Problems with magnets links crap. It sends you to change to utorrent, tried it a while back, don't want it."
[V],Masterzilla,2012-03-03T10:44Z,"If you have problems getting magnets, just rightclick on GET THIS TORRENT and COPY URL, and in your torrent client add new torrrent from URL. That should work.

And thanx for avi version of this. Keep them coming ettv ;)

Cheers."

Good torrent, thanks."
,Aikousha,2012-03-03T11:24Z,"That doesn't work... at all.
First, I don't get an URL from that copy, and, second, there is no ""add torrent from url"" selection anywhere in any of my clients.
And though the magnet link opens the magnet loading window, it always fails.
This: ""Cì∞Cô∞P∫HMÆ§ÎHM}††|EºÉÄ ?Ä?ÄNqÄAêAAêAêN„êIò"" is not an URL!"
[V],LegendET,2012-03-03T11:45Z,"@ Aikousha google Tixati download and install it
on setup set it as magnetic file manger or just run it and in Add+ select Open Magnetic Link copy and past Info Hash number and press Open download will start"
,BlueEyedCrow,2012-03-03T11:55Z,"Thanking you kindly, sir!"
,BlueEyedCrow,2012-03-03T11:57Z,"To everyone moaning about magnets... I find whilst using 'Chrome' as my browser and 'U-Torrent' as my client I have NO problems at all... In fact, I'd go as far as to say it's quicker, easier and better than the old arrow links that downloaded the torrent file."
,kosick82,2012-03-03T15:58Z,"I was using firefox and Bit commit didn't work I was going crazy uninstalling and installing new torrent clients no matter what, no program was working for me .. I then change my browser to internet Explorer and it allow me to get the torrent now using U-torrent. It's strange maybe I need to update fire fox was working fine a week ago hope this helps you guys going through what I went through keep Spartacus Coming Thanks!!!"

,JohnnyConfidence,2012-03-05T17:45Z,Thank you! So appreciate the continuation of the xvid versions of my shows. The other editions out won't play on my tablet without conversion which is a huge pain. Keep up the great work. ETTV is the best!
,Cheyenne-tgy,2012-03-05T17:51Z,thanks.
,Typharius,2012-03-05T19:13Z,"Like with your last upload there is something different about your avi's than any others, they won't stream to an xbox 360 without jerking all over the place constantly. Thanks for trying anyway but I'll have to wait for someone else to upload it. What the fuck is with all these shitty 264 format ones lately??"
