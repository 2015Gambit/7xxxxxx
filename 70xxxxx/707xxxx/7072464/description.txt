Installation of tTorrent Pro 0.9.4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Root needed!!! Do not ask me how to root your Android device. Google is your friend...

1. Backup and uninstall any previous versions of tTorrent.
2. Install tTorrent 0.9.4.apk (Dont run!)
3. Install Lucky-Patcher-v1.0.13-approb.com.apk
4. Put hu.tagsoft.ttorrent.lite.txt into "/sdcard/LuckyPatcher/" (without quotes). If this directory doesn't exist, then either ensure that LuckyPatcher was installed, or search your device for the LuckyPatcher directory.
5. Run the LuckyPatcher, allow Superuser access, long press tTorrent, and choose Custom Patch!
6. Enjoy
