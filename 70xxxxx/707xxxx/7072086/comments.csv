,RuivoX,2012-03-03T02:37Z,"Silence, i'm enjoying all your releases... Nice encodes, delivering a great video quality at files so small... I'm wondering which program do you use ( i'm with TRON 1080p in 13,5GB which i need to shrink to free a little space in my HD eheh )"

Hi, nice to hear that! Actually I'm still trying out different programs. A very simple program that does the job is: DivX Plus Converter (free trial).

Depending on your system, encoding takes a lot of time, so I recommend downloading a smaller version of the movie instead."
