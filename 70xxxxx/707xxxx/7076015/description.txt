Moonflower is a 1977 studio and live double album by Santana. The recording features both 
studio and live tracks, which are interspersed with one another throughout the album. It is 
perhaps the group's most popular live album, because Lotus did not receive a U.S. domestic 
release until the early 1990s. It displays a mix between the fusion of Latin and blues-rock 
styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the much more experimental and spiritual jazz 
fusion sound that characterized the band's mid-1970s work. The live material was recorded 
during the supporting tour for the Festival album, which displayed a similar mix of styles, 
and many of the album's songs are featured here ΓÇô namely, the three song medley which opens 
Festival.

A cover version of the Zombies' mid-1960s hit song "She's Not There" was released as a single 
and peaked at #27. The song was the first Santana recording to hit the Top 40 of the Billboard 
charts since "No One to Depend On" reached #36 in 1972. The album reached #10 on the Billboard 
charts and was eventually certified platinum, neither of which occurred again until the 
star-studded Supernatural in 1999.
