It's fun to turn the knob.

You'll need two of frame A, two of frame B, one each of gears and
helix.  Frame B has moving gears and is required to flex a few mm
during assembly, so you'll need a printing process that allows those.
I used SLS.

I designed this in 2011 as a party favor for the SME RAPID conference.
This version is smaller and stripped of their logos.  It's public, so
feel free to build it, hack it, make your own version.

If you do something cool with it, I'd love to see what you got, so how
about sending a picture to b@bathsheba.com?  


Onward and upward!
