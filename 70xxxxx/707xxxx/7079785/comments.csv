,georgiqg,2012-03-05T23:05Z,"After installing the program from the ISO, if you get an Error message, that the file ""Current_User.mdb"" is missing.
To fix that, go to install directory (C:Program Files (x86)McGraw HillBig Yellow German VerbsDatabase), right click on ""User_Records.mdb"" => Copy and then paste it into folder ""C:Users[user]AppDataRoamingMcGrawHill"" and rename it to ""Current_User.mdb"".
That worked for me."
