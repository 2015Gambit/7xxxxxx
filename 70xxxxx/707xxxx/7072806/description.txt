Tree Notes is a notes organizer for Windows that allows you to organize and manage all your notes in a tree structure with icons. Tree Notes is very easy to use and light-weight.

Store and manage unlimited number of notes in a single database file.

The new version 2 now allows you to attach files, emails and links to notes. The attached files can be optionally embedded and stored in the Tree Notes database.

You can easily add new notes or import them from files to add them to Tree Notes. For example, you can import all your files like ToDo.txt and Notes.txt, so you can have them in one place. The tree allows you to have even hundreds of notes in a single file, and navigate them easily.

Tree Notes can be controlled using keyboard to save your time. Activate it any time with a system-wide hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+T by default). Cycle through the tree using Ctrl+Tab.
