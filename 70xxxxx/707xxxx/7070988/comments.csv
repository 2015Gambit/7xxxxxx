If you use uTorrent, you download the whole thing.  

Then once it's downloading click on it to select it.

Then select the ""files"" tab at the bottom of the uTorrent window.

Then highlight all the files except the sample file.

Right click and select ""don't download"".

Only the sample will download, and if you like it and want the movie, go back and select the movie file, right click, click the pop-up menu ""priority"", and choose ""normal""  [or ""high"" or ""low"" depending on how you want the download prioritized.]

There, I've done my good pirating deed for the month.  ;)

Thanks for the up, E to the Z. "

i got a dvd player that won't play files over 1 gig so 700x2 works fine. if you're looking for a larger file and want to get with the times, why are you still even with xvid? talk about dumbass idiots.
