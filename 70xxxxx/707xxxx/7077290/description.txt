SYNOPSIS:  
In Dead Ringers, David Cronenberg tells the chilling story of identical twin gynecologists - suave Elliot and sensitive Beverly, bipolar sides of one personality - who share the same practice, the same apartment, the same women. When a new patient, glamorous actress Claire Niveau, challenges their eerie bond, they descend into a whirlpool of sexual confusion, drugs, and madness. Jeremy Irons s tour-de-force performance - as both twins - raises disturbing questions about the nature of personal identity.
