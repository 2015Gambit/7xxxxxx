Turns out I had a bigger problem than a defective video card  . . . my mother board went bad on me, so I replaced it with a Gigabyte board and got a better processor and doubled my memory . . . that will teach that naughty board.

Anyway, I am back. 

Just wondering, is there a reason you guys are not rating these torrents? I am used to seeing stuff like 6/10 or V6 A10 . . . is that just not done with ISOs?

Oh yeah, let me know if you would like to see anything else on these descriptions, I am just adding the stuff I would want to see on there."
[T],Auge,2012-03-04T21:40Z,"Well, I messed up something in the description . . . It should read:

115 minutes
Color 
1.85:1
Spoken Language: English 
Subtitles: None"

,faccage,2012-03-05T17:31Z,"Loving the stuff you're uploading. Thanks a lot. I just wondered if I could make a few requests. House (1977), Bergman Island, Ali: Fear eats the soul.

I also wondered in terms of the DVDs that you own, what are they like? Are they all art or do you own exploitation for example?

Thanks"

,faccage,2012-03-06T15:36Z,"Hmm OK thanks. I'd probably be more interested in art films then, but particularly Fassbinder released by Criterion, such as Ali: Fear Eats The Soul, World on a Wire or any of the BRD trilogy.

Thank you."
