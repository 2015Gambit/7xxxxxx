,lulu_the_hound,2012-03-04T12:10Z,Scenebalance RAR version worked much better and faster; TvTeam is usually very good but could only get 62% after 24 hours
,xithos,2012-03-22T02:08Z,Please Seed when possible. Stuck at 69% will Seed for 24 afterwards!
,USAPatriot1,2012-07-02T21:33Z,I feel fortunate. I made it to 83% before it stopped cold.
