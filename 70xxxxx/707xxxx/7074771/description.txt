This torrent contains the complete Mass Effect Universe with all its tie-ins and stories in a single collected form that inlcudes game plot summaries.
With the launch of ME3 only 3 days away I thought this would be a good way to allow the fans to recap all the info before plunging into Mass Effect 3.
If you like any of the books or comics included in the torrent, please buy them in real life as the game industry needs all the support it can get.

To read the PDF you can use Foxit's PDF Reader and for the CBR/CBZ files, you can get CDisplayEx or ComicRack, both of which are excellent comic readers.
Google em to find em :) They are free!

Here is a reading order for the purposes of review and storage.

The folders are arranged in the reading/playing order too and make sure you follow it to avoid spoilers and all that. For more information, you can always visit the
