Welcome to East Midlands Airport accurate and stunning FS scenery.

Nottingham East Midlands Airport or 'EMA' was opened in 1965 on the former RAF Castle Donington. The airport is also home to several cargo terminals and in 2000, DHL built its large ┬ú35m cargo facility.

The arrival of low fares no frills carriers in 2002 meant a large increase in flights with BMIbaby and Ryanair. The arrivals hall has been extended and a new transport interchange has been created with a new pier built to reduce 'across tarmac' walking to aircraft.

East Midlands airport is the UK's largest cargo airport with DHL, TNT and UPS having bases there as well as being a primary hub for Royal Mail.
