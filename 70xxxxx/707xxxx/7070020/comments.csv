,tubeamp,2012-03-02T15:47Z,Anyone getting problems installing the max/msp module?  
,future-dada,2012-03-02T15:59Z,It works quite perfectly.
,future-dada,2012-03-02T16:03Z,"After installing everything, the modules (MaxforLive) have to stick in every corresponding folder to: Max Instrumentos, Max Audio, Max MIDI effects."
,tubeamp,2012-03-02T20:33Z,I think my system is all gummed up with previous versions of max/msp and so the installer fails ... I'll try a reboot and then wait and see if max/msp 6.x ever gets released.

Up to where I know (To me the same thing happened).

I suppose that this happens for having patched bad in the first attempt.

I have done the following:


1 º. Erasing Ableton Live's installed folder 8.2.8 (Applications), it is not necessary to have uninstall Max for Live.


2 º. To eliminate files of configuration that believe themselves in the folder home/library/preferences/Ableton/*** everything related to Ableton, Live 8.2.8 **** - Not it of other versions -


3 º. It returns to install everything in order that the file Live.app has not been modified by the iPatcher and now you repeat the process.


I happened several times to me (3.4 o5 times), since he had no instructions of how to operate the iPatcher, but in the end I got it work



I have installed two versions, v8.2.7 and v8.2.8 and I have no problems."

,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2012-03-19T00:34Z,"Thanks to future-dada & nikitriki

1) download this torrent
2) go to the app store and search for stuffit expander.
3) UNRAR the downloaded torrent.
4) double tap ""Ableton Suite Live 8.2.8.dmg""
5) install ""Ableton Suite Live 8.2.8""
6) once you got that installed go back to the ""Ableton.Suite.v8.2.8. and.Max.for.Live + Modules - MAC.OSX - packet - dada"" folder. go to Patch>Contents>MacOS>iPatcher.
7) open iPatcher select Live.app & you'll probably have to look for Live like i did. so search in Application>Live 8.2.8. and double tap on ""Live""
8) once iPatcher finishes go back to ""Live 8.2.8."" folder and double tap ""Authorizelive828.auz""
9) NOW you can download that Max Instruments shit."

2. find your live.app file
3. open the new Authorizelive828.auz"

,rojoM,2012-03-22T20:47Z,"
How To Get This Running

1. Open the Ableton Suite Live 8.2.8.dmg and drag the live folder to your apps folder (or app shortcut inside the dog, as instructed).

2. Install Max for Live. I ran into a problem with this. After several attempts, I always end up with an error encountered during the installation process. But, I figured out a solution. Instead of directly running the Max for Live.mpkg, I opened its package contents (right click) and ran the Max5.pkg found in Contents/Resources/Max5.pkg. And voila, installation successful.

3. Was unable to make use of the patch included in the torrent so I used the patch in this link http://peeplink.in/26263f287d3c, worked like a charm. Simply download the patch in that link. Run it, select the live.app, then run the Authorizelive828.auz. That's about it, installation of live will soon follow. Oh, and you will be prompted if you want to install all the max stuff, just click on yes.

Cheers to the uploader!

I'm running Lion 10.7.3"
,improvjlo,2012-03-23T05:26Z,Still says the Authorization isn't working...dammit
,foxchants,2012-03-23T05:54Z,"Anyone having problems with opening the Ipatcher file likely had problems with permissions. 

To determine if this is the problem:
1. open terminal
2. drag ipatcher file into terminal 
3. press enter (terminal should respond: permission denied) 

Fix:
1. open terminal
2. type ""chmod a+x "" (there is a space after ""x"")
3. drag file ipatcher file into terminal
4. press enter (permission should be changed and you should now be able to open the file)
5. double click ipatcher file

Best!"

,Marcopolo84,2012-03-29T20:56Z,"wait FUCK YES i got it, if your having trouble authorizing delete live install again and do everything threw stuffit expander and follow what @whypaywhenucanusepiratebay says just don't open it before or without stuffit expander cause then it won't let you authorize "
,umin3,2012-03-31T01:01Z,"I have tried both patches and it still says

You can't apply the Patch on this File !

Help?"
,chaostastic,2012-04-03T12:58Z,"The distributed patch is wonky. Someone who knows squat about OS X must have set up this.

If you change the name of ""Patch"" to ""Patch.app"" and run chmod in the terminal: sudo chmod -R a+x [path to Patch.app]
you will get a runnable application that open like any other app by double clicking.

Anyways, when I run the app and select my Live application it says everything have been set up, but when I start Live by dropping the generated file ""Authorizelive828.auz"" (in the LIve 8.2.8 folder) on the Live icon it says ""this authorization file is not valid on this computer"". 
It's likely this is because I have a PPC machine and whoever did this didn't bother to make a generation of an auz file for other hardware than Intel.

However, my Max for Live installation also didn't work, though I don't see why authorization should be invalid if Max isn't installed.

Any further advice?

Now you know how to repair the Patch application and how to run the auz-file. Something that was missing from the instructions."
,chaostastic,2012-04-03T15:29Z,"I verified installing Max doesn't make a difference for me. I did this by opening the Max package and ran only the ""/Contents/Resources/Max5.pkg"" installer as the step ""run preflight script for Interlok Extensions"" failed with ""Max for Live.mpkg"". 

It's possible my previous description with properly renaming the iPatcher and running chmod on it will work fine on an installation of Live 8.2.8 in a Intel OS X machine. "

Yo empiezo por instalar MaxforLive luego entro en la carpeta del iPartcher y te encontrarás con el parcheadot con el logo en negro y rojo más un archivo (no lo borres) simplemente doble clic en el iPartcher y se abrirá una ventana en la cual tenemos que añadirle la aplicació Live del directorio superior...

Simplemente hacer esto

Otra cosa es que se haya intentado instalar y que no haya salido bién por razones que no vienen al caso ...
