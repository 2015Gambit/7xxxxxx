,premiado,2012-03-03T02:32Z,"i do not like Bioware ripping customers off. I purchased the main game only for the multiplayer, and will be torrenting the dlcs."
,csa2,2012-03-03T11:16Z,"@premiado
Im wondering how it gonna work with the multiplayer, when you are useing original game to play the game and torrenting the dlcs and cracking them, doesnt Origin servers detect it that you have cracked dlc-s."
,rctroh,2012-03-04T01:16Z,"@premiado @csa2
Yeah i wonder that if that work....
i already bought standard one. but i am going to download all dlcs on torrent. And i really doubt multiplayer will work with dlcs crack."

,HaVoC91,2012-03-06T01:49Z,"So the crack is out. I can confirm it works, but everytime I start up the game it tells me the DLC can't be authorized. Does the DLC have to cracked too? I also turned off the online features."
,ndv288,2012-03-06T02:35Z,"ME2 needed the giveme2entitlements.exe program to crack DLC. I assume this ""from ashes"" DLC will need something similar. I would assume it will be called ""giveme3entitlements.exe"" and as far as I can tell, it is not out yet."
,STVENOM,2012-03-06T07:44Z,HOW THE FUCK DO YOU CRACK THIS DLC NIGGA
,Green.Lantern,2012-03-06T11:07Z,Damin it This fucked up my audio 
,kardass,2012-03-06T12:35Z,From what i know from Mass Effect 2 to use the DLC you need to deconnect your internet connection. Will that work with this 2?

,sickboy52,2012-03-06T17:04Z,"To anyone who's curious, it turns out this guy is actually pretty damn interesting.  Ton of backstory to the Protheans as well as insights on many other things.  Should have been part of the main game, I'd suggest waiting to play ME3 until you can get this working."
,Boltthrower56,2012-03-06T22:02Z,"I've been searching for the subtitles file in the dlc , couldn't find it.
It's subtitle file is seperate from the rest of the game.
I think they're inside default.sfar file but i can't seem to open it.
If i could just open it...
Nothing goes smooth anymore..."

,ZoopZA,2012-03-07T10:48Z,"Got ME3 CE on pre-order, but if I have to wait for this to DL on Friday it's going to set my back about 5 hours before I can play it, what with my slow internet connection.

Anybody know if I can simply download this torrent then on release day copy this torrent's contents to the game folder in Origin and have it work without downloading anything?"

,therhymesmatter,2012-03-07T15:18Z,"oh and btw 

@premiado 
It is not BioWare that's ripping off it's customers.EA does the ripping off!They decide how DLC are distributed and when.BioWare may have content worth for 10 DLC even as we speak but EA is gonna decide when and IF they will release it..So blame it on EA the blood suckers...Too bad BioWare is rolling with them..But hey at least they have a lot of money and can back up BioWare's masterpieces"
,Dufox,2012-03-07T23:08Z,"unless they updated how this works.

1. yes you can download the torrent, pop in the dvd you bought at the store and it will work.

2. if you have the original game and plan to torrent the dlc. install the game to the natural directory. then install the game again to a different directory.

once you apply the cracked dlc you wont pass the authorization checks online. and the only way to log in with cracked dlc's is if you replace the launcher with a cracked version.

their could be ways around this or i could be wrong, not sure how origin will affect it. but i would try to avoid installing origin at all costs"
,rctroh,2012-03-08T03:53Z,"@Dufox 
hope that works. i might try that as well. use crack one for single player and original one for multiplayer"

ULTRA MEGA SUPER DUPER IMPORTANT MUST REAAAAD!!!

If you are playing the DLC mission Priority: Eden Prime then you may encounter a certain bug that always happends no mather what, after watching a certain video and you reagain control of shepard the game will crash, to fix it you must wait until you regain control and press ESC a bunch of times to fix it otherwise is going to crash as soon as you regain control .

Wrong altough it might work this is a wellknown bug even with a legit bought Game!!!!

The fix is this:-

If the game crashes/freezes for you after you view the data on a computer.
Find the other computer in the level, which is down to the left as you leave the Prothean Life Pod,
then up into a room. You'll find it!!
As there are two computers in the level that you need to collect data from,
you need to collect that data from that one first as they need to be viewed in order.
It is a well known ""Bug"".
This stops the game from crashing. 


I finished the ""From Ashes"" DLC but the prothean is still not playable. 
He cannot be picked from the teammate's menu, shadowed...
Is that some kind of a problem or i just have to do something in game to unlock him? 

That is only when you havenÂ´t played the mission on Palaven,
after that mission he becomes available .

Hope that clears that up. Enjoy :)"
,mr.Death2,2012-09-17T14:12Z,U can download this torrent and play it and there is no need for crack if u have 1.03 update. 
,RafVne2,2012-09-25T02:04Z,"Thanks for the up buddy...

Is this something new, or different maybe, because I could have sworn that from ashes was included with the first scene release, but I could be wrong... will check it out...

BTW... I haven't had a problem with the mentioned bug, And I have finished the game several times over, I've gone back to it to check out the new endings and the levi DLC, done and done... I figured I'll play once again and to make it a challenge I'm not wearing any armor, (even gotten myself a Naked mod for my sweetie) funny as hell, to see her running around ""butt naked"".... for a while at least  (it's called A7guccidancer for interested) , but I digress."
,RafVne2,2012-09-25T02:10Z,"shit... 
What I was gonna ask is... what IF sudenly I can't view/access neither ""pod""... game crashes as soon as I touch it, I guess will have to edit coalesced.bin then hu? I don't want to go there, I know I won't be able to stop, and I'll spoil the game. Once you'll loose sence of asccomplishement the game is ruined. Ya know what I mean. I guess I'm off to look for a stage complete code... take care."
