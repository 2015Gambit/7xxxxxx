The first section of the book helps you establish your honest starting point--it's easy to be at an acceptable weight but have unacceptably high fat percentages, cholesterol or blood sugar. Establishing this point involves a fair amount of measuring and math, and includes checklists that will help you identity potential concerns like Syndrome X or thyroid problems.

Diet and nutrition follow; the section encompasses fairly complex suggestions on intake percentages as well as simple meal plans and recipes. Portion control figures highly--it's back to the old 'four ounces of skinless chicken breast' as a basic building block. A short section on supplements refers in a general way to recent research, but is more of an introduction than complete system. More time is devoted to the exercise program, but this could be more complex than a typical dieter feels ready for. Clear photos show off specific exercises, but they require regular trips to the gym or a set of dumbbells at home. The last section, which Shilstone suggests photocopying, is a day-to-day journal that allows you to check off goals and note areas for further work. It's a helpful tool, but also requires a fair amount of dedication.
