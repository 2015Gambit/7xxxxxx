,cherryshit,2012-03-05T17:08Z,"eztv uploads whatever scene group releases first. If ASAP uploaded first in MP4, then eztv is going to upload MP4. Unless you want to go to another tracker, the only other option you have here is an HD MKV file: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7078236/Californication_S05E08_720p_HDTV_x264-IMMERSE_[eztv]"
