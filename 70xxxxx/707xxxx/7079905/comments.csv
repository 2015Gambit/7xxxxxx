,Annoyme,2012-03-05T22:53Z,"Hah, Ars, I've probably downloaded every conservative and libertarian torrent on TPB and Demonoid over their history.

somewhere between 2500 and 3000 DVDs full!

Maybe I should ask YOU, if there is anything you would like?

I am going to try to up three torrents a day for the next few months. Double that on Saturday and Sundays.

,trickdaddy0024,2012-03-06T00:37Z,Dumbo does it again...Everyone should save this podcast and listen to Dumbo on the verge of crying because his half ass apology...LOL...Dumbo can talk down to minority and immigrants but I think now that he has his tale in between his legs...He will think twice about disrespecting WHITE women...Dumbo's show is on life support...If President Obama gets re-elected then Mr. Limbaugh's career is OVER and he could blame Obama for that too...END
,Annoyme,2012-03-06T01:44Z,"Rush's ratings go up when Dems are in power.

He is usually the only real opposition with wimpy dem-lite RiNOs like Speaker Boehner."

,trickdaddy0024,2012-03-06T02:06Z,Rush is about to get fired from his job and you put up links showing how much he makes...Are you just trying to annoyme?

,thunderbum,2012-03-06T21:50Z,"LOL!!

It's every loony leftist's dream that he 'loses his job' but for 23 years that hasn't happened! And it won't happen either.

Rush's audiences range up to 43 million listeners per week (worldwide), and he has built a vast empire all by himself utilizing natural talent and the ability to expose the left for what they are.

""Truth has its own attraction."" And that's why Rush is so appreciated and loved.

How's Air America doing? (smirk)

And like Rush mentioned in today's show: it was his audience that made those companies rich... his listeners that added popularity to companies such as Carbonite (barely known before Rush), ProFlowers made a mint as did all the other companies that turned and pulled their ads...

...however there will be more companies that will sign on, and more money to be made for them by Rush's loyal EIB listeners... and that's what pisses off people like you off. 

We're still here - and so is Rush.  "
,protongeek,2012-03-09T21:05Z,"Hey its Trick Daddy still complaining about rush. Hey Trickdaddy if the founding fathers were still alive people like you would be kindly asked to leave the country with your communist idealogy. Hows it feel to know that your saviour Obammy is an abject failure. Unemployment rate actullay at 9.6% and if part time jobs were included based on people who originally had fulltime jobs its at 14%. Good job Democrats ! High gas prices , and high unemployment. Reminds me of Carter. Looks like Jimmy has something to look forward to. Not being the worst president afterall. If I were black I would be like fuck the first black president and he sucks ass."
