While many young artists fall into the ΓÇÿnu-folkΓÇÖ category, this album, above almost anything in recent memory feels like a bridge between old and new ΓÇô itΓÇÖs certainly a traditional folk disc but the interpretations are striking and fresh. WhatΓÇÖs even more impressive is that this interpretive innovation comes from LisaΓÇÖs musicality rather than production techniques; she uses very traditional instrumentation throughout but approaches the songs from a different angle to her contemporaries. Even with this individuality she still manages to appeal to traditionalists as well as drawing in newcomers to folk music.
Co-producer Gerry Diver and Lisa provide almost all of the instrumentation including acoustic guitar, hammered dulcimer, accordion, autoharp and thereΓÇÖs memorable fiddle from Lisa throughout the disc.
Eight ΓÇÿtrad. arrsΓÇÖ sit alongside three of her own contemporary pieces and the quality is high throughout, in particular ΓÇÿBeggar BeggarΓÇÖ has a sweet, soulful sound and a beautiful fiddle backing, and ΓÇÿBlacksmithΓÇÖ, an 1825 York Broadside neatly sums up the album has it embraces both the traditional and the modern.
What this album and Lisa have is confidence, the eleven songs pass by quickly but the range of styles and vocal performances show innovation and belief in her own musical sensibilities. An excellent album and highly recommended.
