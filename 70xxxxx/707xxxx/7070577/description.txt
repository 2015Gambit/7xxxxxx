Japan were a British New Wave group that formed in 1974 in Catford, South London. The band 
achieved success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when it was often associated with the 
burgeoning New Romantic fashion movement (though the band itself has downplayed any such 
connection) They achieved several UK hits in the early 1980s, most notably "Ghosts" and 
"I Second That Emotion" which were top ten hits in 1982.

The band began as a group of friends. Brothers David Sylvian (guitar and vocals) and 
Steve Jansen (drums) keyboardist Richard Barbieri and bassist Mick Karn studied at the same 
school. Guitarist Rob Dean joined later, but before the band had its hits. As youngsters they 
played Sylvian's two-chord numbers mainly as a means of escape; sometimes with Karn as the 
front man, sometimes with Sylvian at the fore.

They dubbed themselves Japan in 1974, signed a recording contract with German disco label Hansa
and became an alternative glam rock outfit in the mould of David Bowie, T.Rex, and The New York 
Dolls.
