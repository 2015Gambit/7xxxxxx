,barometerrising,2012-03-03T07:38Z,"Yes, thank you."
[T],theburningbush,2012-03-06T06:39Z,"Thanks for the feedback, everyone.

In a different venue, my efforts here have resulted in me being characterized as a ""slacker."" So, your positive feedback here is even more valued by me.

On another note...
There was no 3/5 CWKO program.

3/6 will have a special 3-hour CWKO Super Tuesday coverage program, but I will not be posting it. By the time I finally got it uploaded, it wouldn't be news...it would be ""olds,"" and much would likely have changed in terms of election results.

My next CWKO post will be on 3/7."

You can count on my appreciation and support as long as I'm around.  (I am about to go into the hospital here in Austria for a couple of days - I wonder if they have a wireless LAN area...)"
