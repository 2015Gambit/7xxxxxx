,DoctorKing,2012-03-06T02:57Z,It stopped at 57.8% and won't finish downloading... D:
,JawDroppinDroopBallz,2012-03-09T18:45Z,Is everyone else stuck on 93.8% ?!!!
,BULLTRON,2012-03-11T21:34Z,"Come on guys, stuck at 99.8% for over 13 hours now, this is ridiculous.  SEEEEEEEEDD I'm gonna seed this shit forever along with glitch mob and beats antique, let's go!"
,BULLTRON,2012-03-12T05:21Z,"Alright, now the bar is red and everything is fucked.  The file that is .02% incomplete is the Live DJ set, and neither windows media nor VLC will play the file.  If anyone knows how to make it work, hit me up chrisbro189@yahoo.com.  Otherwise I'm just gonna google that shit."
,BULLTRON,2012-03-12T22:42Z,"So if you got an incomplete file, just download mp3val (googled that shit) to fix it.  Instead of fucking up and not playing it, your chodeplayer will be able to skip the broken shit.  I'mma keep seedin, even though it won't seed beyond .3kbps, in hopes that we'll get more seeders.  Opiuo is the shit, and everybody needs to know it."
,intrinzix,2012-04-10T09:03Z,I've been stuck at 99.8% for 18 hours now. Seed so I can finish and I'll seed for a month.
,hadonis,2012-05-07T21:09Z,"Stuck at 98.8% because of the live Triple J (January 2010) : Seeeeds !

Overwise all the other sounds are great, I love Australian electro !

Thx !"
