Q: HOW TO CHANGE LANGUAGE IN GAME?

A: Run ""regedit"", go to HEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Valve -> Steam (click on it) and there change Language ""russian"" to ""english"".

When I ran regedit first time, I was at this location.

,CookieMunzta,2012-03-06T16:11Z,"Could anyone translate the instructions in to English?
Thanks."
,Rhythmus,2012-03-06T16:44Z,"@CookieMunzta Just install VMware-workstation-full-8.0.1-528992.exe and use key from keys.txt
After installation click double on CSGOBeta.ovf and VMware will import virtual machine. "
,CookieMunzta,2012-03-06T17:01Z,"Nevermind, got it.

Just install VMWare, open VMWare and enter one of the serials.
Go to 'file' > 'open', go to the folder where CSGOBeta is, and double click that.
Then follow Rhythmus' instructions to change the language.

Game works perfectly, many thanks."
