,roaduck,2012-03-03T18:54Z,"You're so right steevo-be-thy-name. I remember burning proggies that were fast, good, uncomplicated and that were a few tens of MB's.

Now they're 2 GB for the big Nero and Roxio! 

Loads of shite on them you'll never need or use, tentacles all over your hard-drive and registry and log files and usage files everywhere plus the DRM crap.I can do without it mate. 

This little proggy does everything apart from convert and deal with bluerays, DVD-A's and SACD's which hardly anybody burns annyway.

DVD's, CD's, Blue-rays and Violet-rays will be dead in a few years anyway - It'll be all solid state - no magnetic or optical storage."
