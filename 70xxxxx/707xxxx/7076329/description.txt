He believes that capturing Singania's most dangerous and elusive lieutenant, Don, (Shahrukh Khan), will be the most effective way of accomplishing this. Don's gang consists of Anita (Ishaa Koppikar), his girlfriend, and Narang (Pawan Malhotra). Soon, Roma (Priyanka Chopra) joins them, but she has other plans - kill Don; Don was responsible for killing her brother Ramesh, as well as his fiancee, Kamini (Kareena Kapoor in a special appearance).
