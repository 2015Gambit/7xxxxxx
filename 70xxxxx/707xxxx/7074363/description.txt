I converted TNEs mp4 to xvid
had some issues with audio sync but tried a new program that
could do AVC1 VR bit and audio ok
not sure what tne is using but his is the only rips I have problems with
all others can convert right off :)
it looks like it drifted with each ad break by 100ms
man I hate mp4s 

note audio came out 22K not 44K not that it matters as its
not audio and mostly speech under 8K
doubt anyone would notice

cant be blowed redoing it 2am already and tired
and its good enough for me take it or leave it 

enjoy and HELP SEED! if decide to grab
