Hahah! Not to sound cynical but I'm glad my rips give you shit when trying to convert them. :D  I will agree with you about hating mp4's, though. I only like them because it's what the PS3 likes.  By the way, if you want a higher quality resulting XviD, convert the 720p, not the 480p.  Inflating an already low bitrate video is rather pointless. Using the higher bitrate video and compressing it makes sense and produces a better finished product.

@ Rambo:
The last 5 series? Huh?  You only got 2 seasons I've only been doing this for a little over a year.  I've learned a LOT over that course of time.  If you have spent as much time as I have reading through forums, tutorials, guides, researching software, pros and cons of this and that, ugh I'm getting a headache thinking about it all... you wouldn't be bitching about x264 sucking and XviD being better.  It's the exact opposite, Rambo.  XviD is total crap and x264 is the way to go. Get use to it.

And I don't recall ever saying I hate x264 because it doesn't play on PS3.  I've hated .mkv's because they don't play on the PS3, but that's the container, not the codec.  The PS3 plays x264 stuff just fine when it's in a .mp4 container.  x264 is an AVC codec which IS supported by the PS3, X360, Apple devices, and slowly more stand alone players.  I test the .mp4 videos on a PS3 to make sure playback is acceptable before posting.

*Almost any* x264 .mkv file you get can be made into a PS3 ready .mp4 with Avidemux (freeware).  --Drag & drop the .mkv video in, answer the questions about frames and indexing (yes or no hasn't seemed to make much difference for me), set the video and audio tracks to copy, the format to mp4, and save. Done in a moment and plays on PS3.  The only time extra work is required is if the audio track of the mkv is DTS. That needs to be converted to 6ch AC3. Need a visually aided guide?

Works about 99% of the time. Note I did write ""almost any"" earlier; I have one .mkv that's just an A-hole and won't convert, grrr (Revelation of the Pyramids 720p).

If psspss wants to convert every x264 release to its ancestral counterpart XviD, that's up to him.  He really doesn't have to, though, since x264 is a LOT better than many people seem to think."
[V],psspss,2012-03-04T00:28Z,"I bet if you converted your own rips back to xvid
your find the same problem with audio sync

by the end its 1.5 seconds out thats using all the
best converters.. 

again its the VBR you use.. hence whu Contant bitrate rules

===

those using Bitcoment 
tranmission
and bitlord

should really consider upgrading to utorrent 2.2.1 or higher

your only getting 2kb/s as everyone "
[V],psspss,2012-03-04T00:34Z,"super converter worked but I think some frames skip

avidemux crashes on importing and also goes out of sync in safe mode or using avsproxy

so I think Im doing everything correct.. 

maybe its a certain ffdshow version need but doubt it

umileencoder is darn fast like 5-8 minutes on i7
to convert think it does less checking of frames
but some mp4s suffer out of sync over doing it
3 times longer in avidemux"
[V],psspss,2012-03-04T00:36Z,"the biggest problem now with mp4s is everyone is adding 100mb
to the size for the small mp4s thats heaps more bandwidth now..

and 720p are killers for data use so saying convert
them is ok if you trying to make the isps richer"
[V],psspss,2012-03-04T01:59Z,"I wasnt too bothered about getting this episode
perfect.. its after all just another recap show with
chat.. kinda boring

about time they produce new episodes new locations

be good if they did a week long investigation with day time recording too that be different
and some normal homes said to be spooked"
