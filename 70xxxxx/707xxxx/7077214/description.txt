In the name of Kane! The Command & Conquer series continues to thrive on the Xbox 360 with Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath. As the stand-alone expansion pack to the criticallyacclaimed and fan favorite, Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars, gamers will be able to continue the Tiberium saga without first owning Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars. This Real-time Strategy (RTS) game returns to the Tiberium Universe with Kane at the center of an epic new single player campaign spanning 20 years - from the rebirth of the Brotherhood of Nod after the Second Tiberium War through the dramatic events of the Third Tiberium War and beyond. This story will be told through a new set of high-definition, live action video sequences starring a celebrity cast including Joe Kucan, playing the megalomaniac leader of the Brotherhood of Nod, alongside new talent Natasha Henstridge and Carl Lumbly. With your help, Commander, the Dark Messiah may rise again
