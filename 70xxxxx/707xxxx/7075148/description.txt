Burn as a CD using your fave CD burning software

DTS CD's are only playable on installation that support
the DTS format. When you play them on a stereo setup,
you will only hear white noise, which can damage your
ears and speakers ! On the PC they are playable with all
regular players (Foobar, VLC, Media Player Classic), but
of course your PC needs to be connected to 6 speakers ;-)

A lot of listeners to 5.1 surround are sceptical about 
upmixes from stereo. In their opinion only studio made 5.1
is good. I hope they will think again after listening to
my upmixes. Of course I cannot make discrete channels like
they can in a studio where they record every instrument on
separate tracks, but the sound is excellent, there is a lot
of separation in the 6 different channels and the soundfield
is immersive. And FWIW 90% of the retail surround titles are
upmixes, mostly with only some reverb in the rears."
