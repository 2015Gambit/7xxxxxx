RELEASE NOTES

The Deep Black : Reloaded is a video game in the ?Action? genre (third
person shooter). Deep Black features extensive gameplay (40 single
player missions in 4 different environments) that offers a mix of
terrestrial and underwater battles, which so far has no direct
analogues in this genre in the global video games market.

The sci-fi project with detailed action-packed underwater combats will
feature a new trend in TPS genre. Exciting gameplay suggests using both
environments for combats: land and underwater.

The unique setting of Deep Black comprises an immersive story line,
complex science-fiction mystery, espionage and bio-terror. The story
line runs up in the nearest future in the world of unsteadiness, chaos,
espionage, terrorism, desperate fight for world supremacy and
possession of sophisticated biological weapon.

Usage of realistic physical effects in the underwater environment
enforces players to feel all the deepness of fear and unpredictability
of combats in Deep Black.

Players will take to the murky depths armed with a wrath of underwater
equipment from specialized underwater suit with jet pack and integrated
harpoon and other high tech equipment in pursuit of enemies. With the
majority of the game play taking place below the water?s surface,
action-adventure fans will need to master new skills to fight hostile
enemies and infiltrate enemy bases.

,ovnoglavi,2012-03-04T17:36Z,Just saw the gameplay on you tube and the game looks pretty good! It kinda looks like Syphon Filter I played on Sony Play Station way back... Will post comment again after I finish downloading and installing. 
,TyMod,2012-03-04T19:14Z,Now crack ME3 lol.  thanks Extreme and Skidies.
,OmniNegro,2012-03-04T19:20Z,"Lol. For those that think they saw something stupid that seems like a sign of an account being captured by retarded LEA, the game title includes the word Reloaded. The group that released it was Skidrow.

I was about to cry for the fallen Extremezone. But I searched and promptly pulled my head out of my arse. :)"

because game like this can't sell there. you know ? consoles's gamers can't endure any thing like.

,Cerebral222,2012-03-05T11:39Z,"@Ray1476, If you are still having problems with copying and pasting the crack files, drop your AV, I use Comodo IS and had to uninstall the software to copy the files across, after that there was no problem, just glad Comodo is free."
,Ray1476,2012-03-05T18:21Z,"@Cerebral222

,Str8_Juice,2012-03-07T22:05Z,ok I am having a problem...it seems I did everything right and it starts up good and as soon as I select a mode type to start game it stops working has this happened to anyone and if so what do I needto do???
,Nojadx,2012-03-08T12:44Z,"Funkar jättebra, lite kul, annat än det vanliga, det gäller att ha programmerbar controller (no key remap) jag har Belkin n52te.
Spelet hänger sej när man startar new mission (ctrl alt del, stäng spelet) sen funkar continue, Verkar som introfilmen är rippad, inga problem, filmerna efter funkar ""hittills"" i tutorial.
Tips starta med DeepBlack.exe istället för default genväg."
,Nojadx,2012-03-08T14:42Z,"Jag upptäckte efter många förgäves försök att starta nytt spel ""crasch"", (såg att ett nytt val fanns ""Continue"") men tvekade att klicka på ""Continue""
 Men ""Continue"" fungerade perfekt. trots att det skapades efter crasch. förvånad !"
,adighraiz,2012-03-11T18:18Z,"thanx @extremezone

note:if you by accident update your launcher ""LauncherUpdater.exe"" the game will ask for serial
exit then copy the crack again and it will work perfect with successful serial"
,yougot404d,2012-03-12T05:52Z,"I uploaded 60gb, hope it helped. Cheers."
,meaningless_existence,2012-03-25T17:20Z,"Not a bad game, just finished it.
10h+ playtime."
,SergioFCPorto,2012-03-26T01:29Z,thanks
,druhklam_orbowetsch,2012-03-30T04:50Z,"Many thanks extremezone, I'll give it a try..."
,JonviceHC,2012-04-10T09:22Z,"I accidentally let the launcher connect to the internet. Copied the crack again, but still required serial. Then, I tried reinstalling and still asked for serial. (I was disconnected on those last 2) Anyone have a solution or a serial I can use offline?"
,D_A7,2012-04-22T13:36Z,"When i start new game it says "" Your game resources are damaged , instal game from original directory ""

i did everything in instructions and is still not working ."
,D_A7,2012-04-22T13:38Z,"""reinstall from original installer"""
,Sivos,2012-04-27T09:15Z,"Got to admit, I half expected this to be uploaded by RELOADED lol."
,Sivos,2012-04-27T10:05Z,"In case this wasn't already said before, if you encounter the thing that says to type in the serial number, just exit the game and install the crack again.  That was simply because the game updated on its own and replaced the crack with the real .exe (it may happen even if you installed the update that came with the copy)."
,stahtufiang,2012-07-01T19:24Z,"another great upload from, finishes in trash just because it won't work "
,id10tpc,2012-07-09T16:44Z,"easy download, easy install no problems,windows 7 32bit"
