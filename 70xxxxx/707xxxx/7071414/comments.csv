,bhaak,2012-03-03T09:35Z,dududus: because the new scene rules allow smarter quality-based encodes which retains the same quality with no target size.

Could you upload Game Of Thrones S01 720p BRRip XviD AC3-ViSiON ?"
,steelllynx,2012-04-06T05:26Z,Hardcoded english subtitles??  Why?
,steelllynx,2012-04-06T05:27Z,What is it with TPB movies anymore.. .  Can't get a damn NTSC DVD-R (aka DVD5) 4.37 GB without fucking NL SUBS hardcoded in them.  
,steelllynx,2012-04-06T05:28Z,"Why, might you ask, would I want a DVD5?  Because most of the x.264 stuff out there is desynched."
