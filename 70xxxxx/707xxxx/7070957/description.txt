First off, video seems to be multiple sources,
at least 2 cams and possibly trailer segments
cut up and stitched together. About 30 seconds
missing around 40 minutes or so. Cut video into
31 pieces, then cropped rotated and stretched each
seperatly to remove as much camera shifting as
possible without losing picture. Then another 64 cuts
to make it all sync up properly.
