Man On A Ledge 2012 720p CAM READNFO XviD-26k
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568338/

Sources - Video= P76...Thanks :P
          Audio=NOGRP...thanks :P

Notes -

Cropped, resized,slight rotation and perspective, denoise, slight rgb, levels, brightness. 
now the reason for READNFO.. there is 1 minute missing from movie.. not worth the trouble to 
upscale the missing 1 minute from NOGRP's cam cuz it just dont look good regardless ur not 
missing much in that 1 minute to worry about ..then just synced and muxed NOGRP's cam audio to it..
turned out decent.. not greatest but will work til R5 or better comes along.. enjoy
