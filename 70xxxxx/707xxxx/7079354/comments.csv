A torrent with active user above ten only get the magnet link. That's what I red from a TPB mod in the comment section of a torrent here in TPB."

,slicknick610,2012-03-07T04:43Z,@Yuri-san I just noticed it too. I upgraded one computer to Handbrake 0.96 and it seems to cause a sync issue. I am trying to get 0.95 back and will post 480p part 1 and both 720p parts when I can. I assumed the newer version would work fine but I guess not.
,Yuri-san,2012-03-07T06:47Z,"Tnx Nick, and tnx for the awesome uploads"
,vwberg83,2012-03-08T10:10Z,thanks...
