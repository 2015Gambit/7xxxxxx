What sucks about the magnet links are I can't just grab the one good song from the bunch like I normally do. "

Excuse me, but selecting certain files inside a magnet/torrent is perfectly easy with Âľtorrent.
You just mark the files you don't want, right click and select ""don't load this"". Try it!"

Thanks for caring but Ive been using Utorrent for years now and never had an issue I'm not sure what the cause is everything works as it as in the past just there is no information inside the box that pops up if I select ok I download all the files inside the torrent but the option to select each piece of data separately is gone.

@Biomechanicall again great upload as always not trying to spam your torrent. Keep uploading we will keep coming back."
