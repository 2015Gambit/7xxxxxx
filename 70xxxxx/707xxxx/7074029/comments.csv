,Coquinoob,2012-03-03T10:26Z,Hope you'll like it :) It's already a STL file you can print it directly with a makerbot and cie!
,Lucian_,2012-03-04T16:32Z,but i dont have a 3d printer ?
,MistryWho,2012-03-05T20:46Z,@Lucian_ I'm sure someone will upload a 3D printer soon :P
,spaz92693,2012-03-11T04:21Z,Well this would do me really good if I had a 3D printer. XD
,aarjcas,2012-03-14T11:04Z,I need a 3d printer to print a 3d printer D:
,awwgoddammit,2012-03-15T02:11Z,Gee... Could someone just upload a .jpg? I don't have a program that can deal with this file type [-L-]
,wirama,2012-03-22T12:15Z,"if anyone doesn't have a 3d program or stuff like that, you can just search it in google image"

,Blinker88,2012-04-01T04:23Z,Nice. Anyone have a guide on how to choose the best 3D Printer out there?
,cobalt23,2012-04-13T22:12Z,@blinker.. MakerBot  In my opinion The one and only. Google it if you are unsure
,Coquinoob,2012-04-18T10:17Z,"I will try to post a tutorial soon, showing how to print and wear your beautiful mask! Keep in touch!"
,portydert,2012-05-02T10:13Z,someone print me a 3D printer and ill print this for you? :)
,joanmcbitch,2012-06-08T17:36Z,Fucking awesome. People don't seem to see the sick potential of this.
,Taco92,2012-07-13T07:35Z,:P
,.235.,2012-08-01T20:36Z,"this is a great idea, however useless. The image has no depth to it and as such can not be printed. (yeah it's 3d, but the surface has no depth)
nice try though! I wish there was more like this"
