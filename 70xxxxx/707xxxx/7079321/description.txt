Anneke van GiersbergenΓÇÖs long-awaited album ΓÇ£Everything Is ChangingΓÇ¥ is slated for a January 2012 release on PIAS Recordings. The first single ΓÇ£Feel AliveΓÇ¥ preceded the full-length disc in September 2011, and the accompanying video became an Internet sensation.

ΓÇ£Everything Is ChangingΓÇ¥ was recorded mainly at her home studio in the Netherlands and at Ultrasound Studios, Braga (PT) with production done by Daniel Cardoso. This album is the first one to be released under her own name and promises to reveal an entirely new side of this multi-talented singer.

Anneke describes the creative process surrounding the album as ΓÇÿfinding my own identity as a solo artistΓÇÖ. It reflects the changes sheΓÇÖs been going through in recent years, resulting in a unique blend of upbeat rock, electronic sounds and of course Van GiersbergenΓÇÖs trademark heartfelt singing style.
