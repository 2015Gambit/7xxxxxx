,Jules_k,2012-03-05T15:51Z,I noticed that suddenly the episodes released are now less than half the size of what they used to be. New codec?
[V],spastik64,2012-03-05T16:26Z,"Yeah, now most rip groups are encoding HDTV version in x264 and format mp4, with a higher resolution (720x404). This is the explanation that the size is less."
,douglascheat,2012-03-06T07:06Z,The quality is taking a hit with this new smaller encodings.  I hope the groups realize this and make these optional and not the standard.
