     When indie game developers Alexey and Markus are in trouble, their        
     only hope comes from their creation.                                      
                                                                               
     You are the Tetrobot: a tiny robot that can drill blocks of matter        
     one by one, collect them, and recycle them into new pieces of 4           
     blocks. You also have the possibility to destroy lines of 8+ blocks       
     in a very ┬½retro russian┬╗ game style. Sand, wood, stone, obsidian,

     to use wisely and take advantage of them. So get ready to use your
