Well, my antivirus software did not hit the alarm, so I guess it is virus free.

Anonymous? Hmmm... scepticism understood, but don't you have an antivirus program to ""catch the fly""?

Take it easy man! ;-)

As for why Maher did not upload it himself, no idea... Maybe he just got tired with what's going on with the torrent-halleluya...

Respect to Maher and the anonymous uploader! ;-)"
