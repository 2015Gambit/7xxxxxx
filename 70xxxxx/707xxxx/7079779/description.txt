- ARTIST
Journey is an American rock band formed in 1973 in San Francisco by former members of Santana. 
Originally a progressive rock band, they redefined their sound by embracing traditional pop arrangements on their fourth album, Infinity.
Their strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987, after which they temporarily disbanded. 
Journey enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid 1990s, and later regrouped with a series of lead singers.
They have had eighteen Top 40 singles in the US, six of which reached the Top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Their worldwide sales have reached over 80 million albums.
 A 2005 USA Today opinion poll named Journey the fifth best American rock band in history. Their songs have become arena rock staples and are still played on rock radio stations across the world.
