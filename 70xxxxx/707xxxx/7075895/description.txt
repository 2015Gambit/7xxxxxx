Classic Metal Slug characters Marco, Tarma, Fio, Eri, Ralf, and Clark return once again to take on General Morden and his new and improved Rebel Army.
Metal Slug XX is a side-scrolling, arcade-style, run-and-gun shooter for PSP where players can choose between six zany characters and shoot through seven action-packed levels with varying obstacles, numerous enemies, and diverging paths. Confident players can put their skills to the test by playing more than 70 mission-based trials in "Combat School." Leona can also be unlocked, although I'm not sure how.
