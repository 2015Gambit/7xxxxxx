,Glitch02,2012-03-03T03:34Z,Thanks for posting this up!  :)
,Online.Pirate,2012-03-03T05:33Z,"YUK when did VTV change to uploading mp4 files?

Will have to grab this ep from eztv"
,JinPT,2012-03-04T23:11Z,"MP4 is the way to go, better quality for around the same file size. DivX is outdated and should be dumped, I'm happy to see this finally happening, my only complaint would be that it took too long, this should have happened maybe 10 years ago... Disregard the idiots who can't stand change, those are the same type of people who complain every time facebook slightly changes a color, grab your episodes in MP4, you won't be disappointed!"
,jamie007,2012-03-07T06:39Z,"@ JinPT, that might be the case but not all of us like watching movies and TV shows sitting hunched in front of a computer monitor. With AVI I can throw it onto a USB thumb drive or copy it straight to a DVD or CD and play it on any DVD player, PS3, Xbox or any other device in the house without a problem. With MP4 all I get is a bunch of ""format not supported"" error messages.

As always a big thanks anyway to the uploaders and I dont mean to sound ungrateful."
,Online.Pirate,2012-03-07T07:04Z,"Comparing MP4 to divx is pointless..

MP4 is a media container.. Divx is a codec
Divx can be both avi and MP4 files.

But as jamie007 said.. Avi is much easier for sticking onto a usb and watching from a dvd player etc. I can watch MP4 on my tv if I hook up my laptop to it and play it off my laptop.. but why do that when I can stick it on a usb in afew seconds and just plug it in and watch it

As for quality, both avi and MP4 are the same to me on the computer screen.

And as far as facebook goes I couldn't care less what colour they change it to, it will still be just as lame :D"

,uberjuice,2012-03-25T23:48Z,"Terrible. Audio is not synched. Do not download mp4's, good users."
,wthrman,2012-04-08T14:03Z,"OK, I did an analysis on both the AVI and MP4 video files uploaded by VTV and they actually both use MPEG-4 standards. The difference is the files in the AVI container format use the Xvid codec (uses the MPEG-4 Part 2 standard), whereas the more recent files in the MP4 container use the x264 codec (uses the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC standard). Objective comparisons have shown that the x264 codec is far superior to the Xvid codec, with x264 only requiring 52% of the bitrate that Xvid needs to produce the same overall quality (see http://compression.ru/video/codec_comparison/h264_2011/). So, the fact that the MP4 videos are pretty much the same size as the AVIs basically means that they are about twice the quality, and I don't know about anyone else, but I can see a huge difference when watching fullscreen on my computer or on my HDTV (I have no problems watching them from a USB flash drive using my PS3 or using MPlayer on my soft-modded Wii).

@uberjuice: I have found no problems playing the videos, even when using Windows Media Player...what media player are you using? Try using a different player such as VLC media player or MPlayer and see if they play correctly then."
