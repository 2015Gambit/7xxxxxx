,x5x5x71,2012-03-04T16:09Z,"@saydonsay
just click on 'GET THIS TORRENT' link on the page, seen next to 'horse shoe' symbol, thats magnet link. Your torrent client uTorrent 3.1 is capable of using it/working with it and downloading the torrent.
hope you get it to work."

,rinju,2012-03-04T17:10Z,@saydonsay: Sometimes it may be due to your browser settings. Open this page in Internet Explorer. Then click the magnet link 'Get this Torrent'. The torrent will open in utorrent or any other torrent clients....Thanks

,faizaan10,2012-03-20T16:13Z,Is it just me or is everyone seeing just a magnet link and no torrent link for almost all the recent torrents.
,as85,2012-03-28T08:29Z,Thank bro.
,evath,2012-07-30T06:58Z,"For anyone having a problem with the download link not working, just click on get torrent.  When the torrent opens in your downloader, it will look like the file is empty.  It is not.  Click ""save"" as you would normally.  Look in your downloader and you will see that your file is, in fact, downloading.  Do not despair over what looks like an empty window... everything you need for happy viewing is there.
YIFY .... thanks again, hombre!"
