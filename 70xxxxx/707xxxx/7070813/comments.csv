Hmm. . . I wonder why this has not been front-page news in the left-wing media in North America. Die Zeit reports that:

    Fritz Vahrenholt, one of the fathers of Germany's environmental movement, no longer trusts the forecasts of the IPCC. Doubt came two years ago when he was an expert reviewer of an IPCC report on renewable energy. ""I discovered numerous errors and asked myself if the other IPCC reports on climate change were similarly sloppy. I couldnâ€™t take it any more. I had to write this book.â€

He has written a book to expose the sloppy science of the IPCC.

    Undeniably thereâ€™s a feeling that the stars are now aligned, the mood has swung, and key players are changing their minds. As FOCUS reports, even the most die-hard of warmists are converting, or at least softening their tones. Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, a renewable energy expert, was once one of the fathers of the modern green movement in Germany and believed everything the IPCC preached â€“ until 2 years ago. FOCUS writes:

    ""Fritz Vahrenholt, one of the fathers of the green movement, no longer trusts the forecasts of the IPCC.â€

    and FOCUS tells us why, quoting Vahrenholt:

        Doubt came two years ago when he was an expert reviewer of an IPCC report on renewable energy. â€˜I discovered numerous errors and asked myself if the other IPCC reports on climate were similarly sloppy.â€

    In his book he explains how he dug into the IPCC climate report and was horrified by what he had found. Then add the 10 years of stagnant temperatures, failed predictions, Climategate e-mails, and discussions he had with dozens of other skeptical elite scientists. That was more than enough. FOCUS quotes:

        ""I couldnâ€™t take it any more. I had to write this book.â€

Malthusian disaster-prediction has been going on for 50 years now. First it was the population explosion. Then it was global cooling. Then it was global warming. Now they talk about ""climate change"" which is so vague it could be anything. The science is not the point. The point is the UN gaining power to tax every country in the world, a massive transfer of wealth from the industrialized West to the Third world and global socialism. Now that makes the blood run cold."

You should get your head out of your ass"

DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS!!!!  Here, or anywhere!

Yes, SILENCE, IS COMPLICITY, HOWEVER...

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER DIRECT ATTENTION TO, AT, TOWARD... THE DENIALISTS.  It is what they live for.  It is what they live ON, like leaches live on blood.  They have no more interest in getting to the Truth than Hitler's propagandist Goebbels did.

If you ever comment BECAUSE of something they've said, 
AND YOU SHOULD, YOU MUST, do it for the ONLOOKERS, those that are confused, misinformed, or uninformed.  

SILENCE IS COMPLICITY!!!!  Criminal!

However, DIRECTING ATTENTION (RESPECT) TO A DENIER, 
IS CRIMINAL STUPIDITY.  1. Bleeds your time and energy; 2. Feeds the Animals; 3. CONFUSES THE ONLOOKERS - THEY TAKE IT AS A SHOW OF RESPECT TO THE DENIALISTS!  

DON'T DO IT."
