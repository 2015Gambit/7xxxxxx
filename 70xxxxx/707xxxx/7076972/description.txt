Uncle Albert's birthday looms on the horizon, and
Del Boy books The Nag's Head for private drinks
and a party. Trigger surprises everyone by inviting
a date he met through an agency. This arouses Del's
curiosity and soon he too has a date from the
match-making company. Rodney takes the initiative by
going for the 'James Dean' look, though this ends in
disaster due to an encounter with some punks. Things
look rosy for Del though. His date with Raquel Turner
(unemployed actress) goes swimmingly... until it turn
out she is works as a strippergram twice a week.
Despite a small run in with the police, love conquers
all in the end.
