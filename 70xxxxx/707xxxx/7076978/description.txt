Boycie and Abdul pitch a diamond scam to Del Boy,
who immediately turns them down. That is until
they offer him a ┬ú15,000 cut of the estimated
┬ú150,000 sale of the stone on the UK market.
Del finds himself designated as the courier
between Holland and Britain. No sooner has Del
enlisted a reluctant Rodders, he hears his old
foil Chief Inspector Slater is eyeing Boycie and
Abdul as drug dealers. Del decides to hide
undetected in the back of Denzil's van. Denzil
then getting in and driving them to Hull
(pursued by Rodney) was not part of the plan.
Thinking quickly, they hire a boat, and let
Uncle Albert guide them to Amsterdam.
