Two guitar giants. A collective band comprised of virtuosic instrumentalists. One shared goal. 
And one tremendous album, commonly referred to as the equivalent of aural nirvana. Still the only 
meeting of Santana and John McLaughlin, Love Devotion Surrender more than lives up to the promise 
offered by its principal creators as itΓÇÖs a spiritual journey based in divine faith, religious 
toleration, and the forward-thinking philosophy that music can take us closer to the truth. These 
enlightening concepts are reflected in the playing of Santana and McLaughlin, who repeatedly hit a 
higher plane on this stunning 1973 set.
