DL was easy; contents are (to-date) malware-free; vid & aud are flawless-despite my sluggish 1 Meg Samsung notebook- in media player classic  this edition is uncut (except for some ending credits); and, to boot, video is subtitled-wow! i can practice/compare spanish-2-eng . keep doing good works.  c.Rex"
