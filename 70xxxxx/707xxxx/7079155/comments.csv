The image works nice.. BUT, I need the password for the user cachem.

It autologon, but when I try to install app or change some things ask me for user password."

The password is the same as the username (cachem) but that probably wont work unless you have a French keyboard. On my English keyboard typing cachem resulted in cqchem on the screen.  Switched the input language to English and tried again and voila!  I was able to set the username and password to my liking."
