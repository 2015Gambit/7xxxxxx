[/b][/color] Tyler Perry's House of Payne is a new comedy series about a multigenerational, working class family who experiences all of life's struggles with faith, love and most importantly humor.
Pops, the uncle and head of the household, has his life and home turned upside down when an unexpected event forces his nephew, CJ, played by Allen Payne, and CJ's kids to move into the house, putting three generations under one roof.


This chaotic living situation takes its toll on cranky Pops, who is reluctant to have his routine disturbed.
In addition to CJ's family, Pops and Ella's son, Calvin, a wise-cracking college kid with no money, hangs out at home which makes it impossible for Pops to have any peace and quiet.
It soon becomes evident just how wide the generation gap is, as the family tries to find a way to coexist through all of life's hilarious ups and downs.


Putting the family back in family comedy, Tyler Perry's House of Payne tackles real life issues with very funny humor.
