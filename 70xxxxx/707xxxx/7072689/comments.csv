I hope everyone who reads this enjoys it, and if you don't I'm happy that you didn't have to pay anything to try it out. I have three other books--Understanding Charlie Manson and the Family of Infinite Soul, Zombies on the DL, Fascist Vampires. They are all available here for you at piratebay. Again, I apologize for any problems with torrents. "
