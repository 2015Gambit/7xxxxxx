,ben7530,2012-03-03T14:47Z,"@ Glofingguru and 666taint. If you want to use TPB, please keep up to date. TPB is no longer hosting torrents, only magnet links; therefore ther are no more ""download torrent"" buttons on TPB. Start using uTorrent, and all will be fine. 

(Flash-get for torrents saved to the desktop? Yeah... you need to use uTorrent!)"

,bonez686,2012-03-12T19:22Z,"Movie was great.. 3 days after I finished downloading it my ISP sends me threatening information to ban/block my services due to copy rights infringement of downloading products from Columbia Pictures. I laughed at it as usual but annoyed at it regardless.

Lol just be weary of your mail you might receive the same letter or letters. "
,ejaymz,2012-03-12T23:44Z,good movie
,lambos2k,2012-03-14T19:30Z,"Can someone help me to get the torrents. I only see ""Get This torrent"" w/ magnet, and i click on it nothing happens can some one please tell me how i can get this "

I stopped watching after 20 min. it does not let you enjoy the movie (which seems to be great) "
,Zomgoblin,2012-03-23T16:00Z,"This must be flagged or something because I am not a heavy torrenter and my ISP just busted me  for downloading this.
Believe me or not..."
,Huovinrinteen_Hunks,2012-03-26T18:40Z,"PS3 Users:
When cinavia message code 3 appears go to PS3 date/time settings and change date. I changed 23.3-->24.3.

Works only about 20minutes and then you have to do this again to get audio back."

,ro4eva,2012-04-14T17:40Z,"I loved this movie.  I'm not a big fan of the drama genre, plus I said to myself that I would only watch the first hour of it but I couldn't stop.  Very unique film (for myself anyways).

Rooney Mara has a gorgeous ass.  I would eat off that thing."
