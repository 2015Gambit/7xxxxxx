Review of the book:
"The book is extremely well organized with an easy-to-use table of contents....The citations, both to external references and internal cross-references are thorough and evidence based. Brown often references PubMed directly in the text, which makes verifying information an easy task. Because emergency medicine is a complex field with many overlapping disciplines, topics are also cross-referenced in a helpful manner...Overall, this book would be a useful tool in the arsenal of any medical student or resident....for a quick reference, this book is the perfect fit."--The Journal of Emergency Medicine
