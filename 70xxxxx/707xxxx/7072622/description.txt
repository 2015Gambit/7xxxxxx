Accu-Feel is a program written for FSX that uses additional physics and sound to elevate almost your entire aircraft collection*, both default and 3rd party. It works at the core of FSX, and therefore does not make any changes to any of your aircraft files (for example, downloaded aircraft paints won't be touched). In fact, we don't need to edit or change a single file in your entire FSX install directory. We instead ΓÇ£readΓÇ¥ the aircraft that is loaded, analyze it, then automatically create a custom physics and sound profile that is saved outside FSX. You, the customer, don't even have to know this is all happening. You can just select your aircraft and fly it. 

However, people all have different likings, and while we have ours, we are happy for each person to have theirs too. So every aircraft can also be customized. Using an in-game GUI (Graphical User Interface), settings can be viewed and edited with easy-to-use sliders and buttons. Once done, all settings are automatically saved with the press of one button. 

After installing Accu-Feel, you may climb in one of your ΓÇ£probably never flownΓÇ¥ default Microsoft-built aircraft and think, ΓÇ£this is actually quite enjoyable.ΓÇ¥ Once we started playing with the initial versions of Accu-Feel, we found that our entire aircraft collection felt a whole lot bigger. Accu-Feel is also tested in-house with over forty 3rd party aircraft.
