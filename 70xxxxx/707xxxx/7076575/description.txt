Based on the well known fairy tale, with a sumptuous score by
Tchaikovsky, the Sleeping Beauty is one of the world's best loved ballets. 
At the christening of princess Aurora, the evil fairy Carabosse throws 
a terrible curse upon her and predicts that she will prick her finger 
and die on her sixteenth birthday. Fortunately, the Lilac Fairy lessens 
the curse: Aurora will be plunged into a deep sleep for a hundred years 
but will be awakened by a prince's kiss. The fateful birthday arrives 
and the king and queen urge the beautiful princess to choose a husband. 
Having forgotten about diabolical Carabosse, they do not notice that, 
disguised as an old woman, Carabosse is approaching Aurora...
