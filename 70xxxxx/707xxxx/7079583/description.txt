This is Incredible Hulk Ultimate Destruction (NTSC) for GameCube.

Couldn't find it on here, so I found it on the net (works just fine on Dolphin, haven't tried on modded Wii). Here it is for your enjoyment.

I will seed as long as I can. No guarantees. I will not stop seeding if someone is in the middle of downloading.

PS

I already unrar'd the file, FYI.
