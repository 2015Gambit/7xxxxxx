Future Weapons: Season 1
Just how smart and lethal are the weapons of tomorrow? In Future Weapons, former Navy SEAL Richard "Mack" Machowicz goes in search of the latest, cleverest and most terrifying technology already reaching out to dominate the battlefields of the 21st century. He introduces viewers to weapons that seek out targets almost on their own; others that tap new forms of destructive power; and a few that push the limits of overwhelming force.

Part 6: The Power of Fear
The sensor fuzed weapon is a smart bomb that splits into dozens of tiny but lethal airborne tank busters, capable of reducing a tank column to mere shrapnel. And if it's fear that's required, reach for the MOAB. Short for Massive Ordnance Air Blast, the MOAB has never been dropped in action. Yet its very presence makes the enemy quake. Weighing in at 20 tons, it's the biggest conventional bomb ever made, and it's capable of taking out underground concrete command and control centers ΓÇö or two whole city blocks.
