[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T11:12Z,"@breebitch

Are you sure you downloaded my torrent??

I never password protect my media and i actually opened it to watch to check quality after i converted it so it should be working fine.

I know 4 a fact it isn't PW protected and if the 1 you have is then that it is not my torrent"

You have to Download the Magnet Link click where it says ""GET THIS TORRENT"" next to the little red magnet icon.

Glad you got it working correctly"

I've been clicking those links to support with every download!"
,NESFAN4LIFE2011,2012-03-06T20:24Z,"xCrazy0328x,

How come the link ""get this torrent file"" was removed? Also, for some reason, this video has to buffer a lot in VLC video player. 

Thank you for your support. "
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-06T21:47Z,"@it_helps_to_dream

Thank you i appreciate you showing support it helps me out a lot


@NESFAN4LIFE2011

I'm not entirely sure what you mean but if your are talking about the ""Torrent Download"" link after there are a few seeds/leeches the file becomes magnet link only."
,fastal90,2012-03-06T23:02Z,"Having some trouble here, every time I click get this torrent the window pops up in my client (utorrent) but there are no files to select or deselect.
