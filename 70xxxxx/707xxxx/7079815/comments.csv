,5bux,2012-03-06T08:43Z,You may find a Java error when starting the 1.1 AdventureCraft. To fix this go to http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.7.1-201109091335/index.php#SWT and get the x86/64 Windows download. Extract the files and replace the SWT file in the directory. Hope this helps.

Then you can play portable after it all installs correctly. There are quite a few maps available for AC on the wiki too."
