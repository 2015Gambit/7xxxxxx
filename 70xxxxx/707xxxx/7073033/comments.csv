,Pink_Taco,2012-03-03T06:31Z,question i see alot when downloading something like istoleit. something and some say it is just a name some say it is tracking people.? 
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-03T14:21Z,"did you mean about the interest of use a lot of trackers dude ?
Well,ya it helps a lot for several interesting stuff
of course.
istole tracker is not suggested by far for several good reasons dude.
Be more clear,please.
There are many interesting web sites concerning the interest of using multi-trackers for increase your speed ability and more.
I personaly use free open trackers in most of time.

,Pink_Taco,2012-03-03T20:35Z,sorry hard to explain my self here. i just wanted to know if istole trackeris watching people like those who send copyright info to you  warning you of illegal activities.
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-04T09:57Z,"DMCA can get any information they want all especialy by any free open tracker to know all ip of leechers,seeders and peers.
Few private trackers don't allow you to connect to them because you need to be registered as member on their own website.
istole is one of certain specific trackers that was public but for several reasons i can explain to you here,this one refuse now to connect cause i think it has switched to private tracker anyway.
Using private tracker(s) in more secured anyway for peers and seeders cause unregistered public peers,or seeders,cannot use this last one.
Are you able to connect to istole tracker ?
I can't myself since long time now
...
cu around"
,Pink_Taco,2012-03-04T21:06Z,yes actually i  get most of my speed from there many times and recently. 
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-03-05T18:25Z,"guess you might be such registered to istole then,or may be my ip has been blacklisted by them,dunno...
Was a fast and good tracker 4 me for seeding few months ago,but now,impossible as it still refuse that i connect to for seeding anything anyway.
since that i'm a bit sad so :(
cheers bud."
