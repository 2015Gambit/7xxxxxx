Criticism of the Western Civilization - Collection 15 (Slavery revisited):


The news outlets on the internet reported yesterday a story about Richard Cebull, the Montana's chief federal judge, who admitted that he forwarded an email comparing African-Americans to dogs and implying that President Barack Obama's mother had sex with animals. 

Richard Cebull's email, obtained by the Great Falls Tribune, reads: "Normally I don't send or forward a lot of these, but even by my standards, it was a bit touching. I want all of my friends to feel what I felt when I read this. Hope it touches your heart like it did mine."

A joke then follows: "A little boy said to his mother; 'Mommy, how come I'm black and you're white?' His mother replied, 'Don't even go there Barack! From what I can remember about that party, you're lucky you don't bark!'"

Cebull forwarded the offensive email from his official court account to six "old buddies," who then forwarded it to others.

Interestingly, the news piece continued and mentioned that this is not the first instance of an official coming under fire for sending a racist Obama email. In April 2011, an Orange County GOP official sent out an email with a photo of Obama's face superimposed on the body of a baby chimpanzee.
