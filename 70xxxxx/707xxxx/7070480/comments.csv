,Matinator10,2012-03-01T23:34Z,"@privateking
Seriously, why would you say seed? Dont be a noob and wait for your turn (it's free), or go find a good tracker instead of public."
,whamozen,2012-03-02T00:21Z,This one sure is nice.
,maciek99,2012-03-02T01:53Z,great but i cant save.........
,maciek99,2012-03-02T03:05Z,"has anyone saved the game? continued when they reset the game?

cuz i cant :("
,ag_orange,2012-03-02T17:48Z,It works fine...
[V],boobsman,2012-03-02T17:53Z,"If you have issues saving then the problem is with the original game rip, im sure there will be a patch shortly if there is a problem."
,narmishe,2012-03-03T15:24Z,thx man
,Nojadx,2012-03-03T15:43Z,"Laddade ner detta i morse och J.U.L.I.A-RELOADED från boobsman, Installerade först Julia som hade generic tri Virus TROYAN Capturing screen, sno personal info ""RADERA/avinstallera"", så bara att radera detta med,
Vill inte försöka någon mer boobsman torrents.
Trist att jag skapade ett konto bara för shit, men har aldrig tidigare åkt på något shit från pirat bay, dags att höra av sej.

OBS, jag har inte testat installerat denna, bara tankat hem och raderat !"
,Legizy,2012-03-03T15:51Z,"I don't think there will be an update that would solve the save game problem because when I dropped the game in steam and forced to launch it, it worked fine other vise I couldn't save it.
Or the crack doesn't work properly. "
,Sojobo1,2012-03-03T16:11Z,TO BE ABLE TO SAVE: run the game in administrator mode. Problem solved.
,Nojadx,2012-03-04T10:16Z,"Ursäkta att jag nojade, det kan ha varit mitt första falska virusvarning, men det räcker för mej att skippa.
Igen det handlade inte om denna torrent, bara jag som inte tycker något är värt att ladda hem, om inte 100% säker på spelet eller uppladdaren."
,Willium_Bob_Cole,2012-03-05T05:06Z,I don't suppose anyone could provide a save file at the end of the factory set of levels? I didn't change to admin privilages before starting and now I've lost a good few hours progress =[
,zetaCat,2012-03-05T23:32Z,What are people using for mounting the disk image?
,zetaCat,2012-03-05T23:44Z,Being stupid... Never mind that comment
,zetaCat,2012-03-05T23:59Z,Excuse me for being a noob or idiot or whatever (never pirated steam game before) but in the instructions it mentions Skidrow folder. It did not appear anywhere after installation. Where should it be? And I can only assume that running it through steam is a bad thing so how do I prevent that?
,Legizy,2012-03-06T15:41Z,"You need to crack the game, just simple copy all files from SKIDROW folder (it is in the mounted disk) to where you installed the game."
,pancadas,2012-03-06T20:38Z,my crash on the second set of puzzles.... help...
,Made1985,2012-03-07T01:28Z,set to run as administrator fixes the save problem thanks sojobo1 and thanks boobsman great game
,pancadas,2012-03-07T13:53Z,my crash on the second set of puzzles... think a fix is needed.

What am i doing wrong?"
,squall_leonhart69r,2012-03-17T20:18Z,"THIS TORRENT IS INFECTED WITH A TROJAN

the setup.exe in a clean version of the image is 1.8MB in size

in this torrent it is 900 or so KB and can be opened like a zip file. inside it contains the original setup.exe and a trojan infected nogrp.exe

Clean MD5 = ca39466c8140e09dc29f377f15c09299 *sr-vessel.iso
THIS(Tampered with) MD5 = feb6fb9060da7391ed3228d4b3553f1a *sr-vessel.iso"
,iivs,2012-03-18T21:59Z,"The only thing that works, is sound. Everything else is just black screen. Chaning Vsync on and off doesn't help. Changing from full screen to window mode and vice versa, solves this for only few seconds and when moving character or rain falling, everything becomes black again. Disabling Windows Aero aslo doesn't help either."
,squall_leonhart69r,2012-03-19T03:23Z,"livs, thats because you have antialiasing enabled in your video cards control panel"
,pdropvg,2012-04-01T04:01Z,"SAVE ERROR FIX
