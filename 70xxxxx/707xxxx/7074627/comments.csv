,mickyfinnny,2012-03-05T01:06Z,"This installer came off ruski site,and unfortunately the modified installer mucks up the installation a little.But the good news is that it will become apparent where to put some files when starting active sky.If you do get stuck,i will help remedy this enigma.Btw,good guess aarque hehehe. :+)"

,boucheman414,2012-06-26T06:27Z,Im trying to download it so that I can seed it..  But it is going slow as hell.  I will leave it seeding for many months to come if I can get it to download.  Thanks in advance for your submission.
,CrazyonYou,2012-06-26T06:34Z,"I'm trying to get it downloaded and I will seed for a very long time.. if i can get it downloaded.  I will also comment on any opinions I have towards the program, not your torrent mickyfinnny but just the program in general and how it installs and such.  Thank you so much for posting this torrent!  I'm running WIN7 64bit so I'm sure I will run into problems lol just as I have with just about everything that I have downloaded for FSX Acceleration. "
