Cheers"

 Yes!
 You need to go to cydia and install Appsync.
 I think you get Appsync with Installous.
 Then connect your iPhone/iPad/iPod and   
 click on ""programs"" and drag the file into 
 there and then, click in you iDevice and click on ""programs"" and find your game. and click on the game. Now, a badge wil come on the game. Now just sync you game to your iDevice! and done! (No one understands this right?)"
