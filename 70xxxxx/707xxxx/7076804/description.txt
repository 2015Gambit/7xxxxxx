There is nothing as unbearable as a bad date. From the awkward conversation to the strained laughter to the moments of sheer bewilderment (Did he just call me ΓÇ£Poopsy?ΓÇ¥), dating is not an activity for the easily discouraged. Thankfully, Justin Racz returns with this newest installment to help ease the romantic pain. These would-be Casanovas remind us that there are worse times to be had. Including entries such as: ΓÇ£Creepy Non-Blinker,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Keeps Telling You How Much You Remind Him of His Sister,ΓÇ¥ "Mechanical Bull Riding," ΓÇ£Lap Dog Girl,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Invites you over and is wearing pajamas when you arrive,ΓÇ¥ 50 Dates Worse Than Yours presents just about every blindingly bad date around. Filled with entertaining photographs and outrageous bullet points listing each prospective partnerΓÇÖs hideous traits, this is the perfect gift for anyone who has ever faked food poisoning just to get away from that guy her aunt set her up with.
