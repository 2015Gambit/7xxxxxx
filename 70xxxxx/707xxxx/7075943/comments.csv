It isn't being seeded very well though - there are allegedly over 50 seeders but none of them ever seem to be online."
,rabocop,2012-03-06T08:21Z,"I don't think even the original uploader is still seeding this. Only been up a couple of days, shame the torrent died so quickly."
,Vrekk,2012-03-06T20:24Z,Not enough seeders to fully download. If the original uploader could seed this for a while i'm sure there are plenty of people who will seed it once they have a complete file.
,dupatroopa,2012-03-07T05:21Z,If I could only get past 95% I would seed the shit out of this.
,saladsam,2012-03-07T05:42Z,"Sorry for the slow download, guys. I've been seeding all day, hopefully at least a few people will share the full file. Though every time that number of seeders goes up it seems to drop right back down..."
,rabocop,2012-03-07T06:11Z,"This finally downloaded - not thanks to anybody actually seeding it anymore, but because various peers between them had the whole thing - and it isn't even what it says it is. These ARE NOT the Walking Dead TPBs, they're just the individual comics that make them up bunched together in a rar file. Worthless torrent, that the uploader knows is worthless because he gave up seeding it within hours of putting it up."
,Vrekk,2012-03-07T19:12Z,rabocop This is exactly what saladsam say it was. Cbrs of the file and it's great. Now that I have the full thing Ill seed the fuck out it. Now if only I could get the whole thing for the other volumes
,rabocop,2012-03-08T08:48Z,"No, according to the description these are the Walking Dead trade paperbacks, volumes 1-15 (this torrent containing 1-3). What the torrent actually contains are the comic books divided by volume and rar'd together. They don't even have the trade paperback covers, they have the original comic book covers. They haven't even been rar'd together in such a way that allows them to be READ as complete trade paperback volumes, they've just been thrown together so you have to extract the individual comics and read them one by one.

Despite the fact that there are several torrents already out there for the complete comic book series, I have no problem with people uploading their own, since redundancy is better than shortage, but torrents need to be labelled properly. This took ages to download but I stuck with it because I wanted the TPBs for easy of reading on my e-reader, but I could've downloaded this same content somewhere else in a fraction of the time. The bottom line is, the title and description of this torrent leads one to believe that the content is something other than what it is. Is it The Walking Dead? Yes it is. Are they volumes 1-15 of the trades? No, they are not.

I'm sure saladsam had the best of intentions, and perhaps I could've been less of an arse in my last comment, but the facts remain."
