DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS!!!! Here, or anywhere!

Yes, SILENCE, IS COMPLICITY, HOWEVER...

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER DIRECT ATTENTION TO, AT, TOWARD... THE DENIALISTS. It is what they live for. It is what they live ON, like leaches live on blood. They have no more interest in getting to the Truth than Hitler's propagandist Goebbels did.

If you ever comment BECAUSE of something they've said,
AND YOU SHOULD, YOU MUST, do it for the ONLOOKERS, those that are confused, misinformed, or uninformed.

SILENCE IS COMPLICITY!!!! Criminal!

However, DIRECTING ATTENTION (RESPECT) TO A DENIER,
IS CRIMINAL STUPIDITY. 1. Bleeds your time and energy; 2. Feeds the Animals; 3. CONFUSES THE ONLOOKERS - THEY TAKE IT AS A SHOW OF RESPECT TO THE DENIALISTS!

DON'T DO IT. "

,bigbullzi,2012-03-11T08:19Z,UnviolentPeacemaker is a die hard dummycrat. he wouldn't believe the truth if his god told him. and he kills cats for pleasure and says he is saving the planet.
,RTT2,2012-05-20T13:27Z,"To save repetition, I've made a longer post about this on another torrent, under my last username - it's the second comment by 'ArtieT':

I lost my account details, that's why I have a different name now. Note how I only have one identity - I'm not a sock-puppet, unlike many denialists on the net - they're always being scraped off the boards!

btw have a look at the seeds for the denialst nonsense - mostly 1(!) cf the seeds for the great books about the actual science, e.g. Mann's The Hockey Stick and The Climate Wars, or the actual history, e.g Merchants of Doubt, rather than manufactured political rhetoric.

Good to see implicit support for the idea of a consensus tho, there may still be hope for denialists to reach the truth after all...

stay off them blogs now

Oh and Well done, UnviolentPeacemaker!"
