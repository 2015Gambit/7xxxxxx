If you want to know where artists like Tracey Chapman, Katy Perry, and the like got their inspirations and who may have paved the way for all singer songwriter women, check out Joan Armatrading. This new record is quintessential Joan and is as fresh and new as when she first came on the scene. She is a timeless artist, greatly underrated and undiscovered by the younger set. Not to mention she has epic guitar skills, I highly recommend everyone check out this new release. (review, amazon.com)
