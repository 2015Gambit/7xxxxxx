[V],twentyforty,2012-03-02T09:17Z,"Relative to 260MB = 10/10

Absolute (compared to ANY rip of ANY movie) = 0.1/0.1

Relative to state of mind, eventual deafness or slight blindness = 0/0

Relative to eventual playback system = 1-10/1-10

Anything is relative. Trust yourself, not to opinion of other people. "
