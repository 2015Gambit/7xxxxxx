[V],YIFY,2012-03-01T19:12Z,720p will come
,rom86,2012-03-01T20:09Z,@yify. Do we really need 1080p rips? 720p works iincredibly well on even 55inch led screens. thanks yify.
[V],YIFY,2012-03-01T20:30Z,"I am going to upload the 720p version of this as well :)

I offer both for people so they can choose which to get :)"

,fofo141,2012-03-02T21:23Z,Thank you so much YIFY
,monkey16,2012-03-02T21:48Z,"First of, I owe your team a big thanks for the numerous torrents I've got from you over the years. You were one of the first to truly recognise the advantages of coding in x264 and the mkv container, over the vastly inferior avi system. Only now do you see major uploaders switch over from the old avi system to x264+mp4, in the TV shows. 

I'm grateful that you (and some others) have been championing the AVC standard, for a long time, when it comes to Movies. KUDOS!!!"
,monkey16,2012-03-02T22:16Z,"I did have one bone to pick with you though... You've always released true HD/HQ rips, and I couldn't be happier about you now releasing 1080p videos while staying true to your MO of keeping the file size low.. but I wish you wouldn't go below 0.050 bits/(pixel*frame) for 1080p videos and 0.065~0.070 bits/(pixel*frame) for 720p videos, since a 720p video needs to englarged/magnified when playing it on a full HD display - the low bitrate really shows then.

I hope you see my point. I really enjoy watching stuff in HD, but I do have space/bandwidth constraints so I rely on the smaller sized releases. But, there is room to bump up the quality without vastly increasing the file sizes. 

Thanks again for the all the effort in getting these releases out."
,sweet1969,2012-03-03T05:46Z,"Yes, PLEASE continue to release your 1080p versions!!  I have a 40"" Sony true HD, and your 720p are usually OK, but your 1080p ones KICK ASS!!!  I see a MAJOR difference in quality.  for all of those lame-asses complaining about the size being too big, grow up!!  I live in Cambodia with a slow ass connection, and I wish they were ever-so-slightly bigger so they aren't so compressed.  They take up too much space??  Buy a bigger hard drive, tightwad....

and dont forget to vote for his videos!! ++++++++++++"
