I would seriously of thought that she would have followed in the footsteps of Virginia. 

Thanks for the upload."
,Holy Divr,2012-03-05T21:22Z,"Thanks as always Mr Who for the FG re-sized sets. And the May mod sets. If you have the time, could you re-size 32g's earlier Nika model sets?"
,hoosierdaddy522,2012-03-07T00:48Z,Thanks who. I noticed ALL of 32gb's & ak's posts have been removed????? The witch hunt continues............what's next to be censored?
,Who-He-iZ,2012-03-07T07:24Z,"^Yes, i just don't get it. All 32gbusb's torrents that i downloaded were clearly 18+yo models but suddenly yesterday something happened, 
I wasn't online then. Anyone knows what it was? 'Happy', did you see his last upload? I don't understand this kind of 'witch hunt'. If a really good guy like 32g uploads 200 great torrents and then somebody suddenly thinks that now there's a suspect of CM and then that guy reports it to SuprBay forum, then a MOD bans user and all his torrents are gone! Just with a simple click. Why don't they have a  warning system instead for cases like that. Remove only that torrent and give user a warning? Then after 3 warnings a ban? Banning should be instant only for all those FAKES or VIRUS-uploaders !"
,slowquin,2012-03-07T08:27Z,The policy against underaged models has been in effect over a year now G32 was good till he decided to post Gia
,neranjan1111,2012-03-08T16:33Z,agreed with Who-He-iZ they want to use a wanning system  
,sila11,2012-03-10T09:41Z,"If you post underage models you get kicked off, and good job as it is a form of child exploitation. No warnings needed, if you post pics of sexualised kids you get the boot."
[M],Lollash,2012-03-14T12:16Z,"We dont need a warning system for that. Read the rules before you upload, its pretty simple."
