Rescued from a dead torrent. I was only able to get 99.9% of the archive, though,
and had to use winrar's repair feature. Also the files were huge flacs with
a cuesheet, so I split those and fixed the tags.

There may be a broken song in there somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it.

The cuesheets have the old tags because I was too lazy to fix them. Same with the
filenames.
