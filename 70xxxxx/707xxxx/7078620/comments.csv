,armchair.53,2012-03-17T08:29Z,"Comments are important in the Piratebay community... and in this case, it's good for people to provide A/V ratings.  But it's quite strange for 1 user to rate A=9, V=9 and others to rate as 5 /4 and 3 /4.  So what's going on here?  You would like that a file of this size would be good quality.  Are some members just not being honest? or maybe something else?  I'll also add that whether or not it is a good movie is a matter of taste and so I don't really think people should comment on that as anyone can google it to get reviews, but then again, freedom of speech is cool..."
