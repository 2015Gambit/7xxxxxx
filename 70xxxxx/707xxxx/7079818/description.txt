- ARTIST
Led Zeppelin were an English rock band, active in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Formed as the New Yardbirds in 1968, they consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band are widely considered to be one of the most successful, innovative and influential groups in the history of music.
Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the United Kingdom, as they preferred to establish the concept of album-orientated rock. Their first two albums, with their heavy, guitar-driven blues rock sound, led to Led Zeppelin being regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock.
 Led Zeppelin disbanded following Bonham's sudden death in 1980.
They were described as the "greatest rock and roll band of all time" and are one of the best-selling music artistsΓÇövarious sources estimate the group's sales at more than 200 or 300 million albums worldwide.
