,buttboybastard,2012-03-07T05:14Z,"I disagree, mp4 kicks ass, you can put it on your iphone."
,McGunt,2012-03-08T20:45Z,"PLEASE GOD leave them as xvid avi files...and while we're at it - they're either broadcast in PAL or NTSC so none of ""us"" need to change to completely different frame rates either. Thanks all the same"
