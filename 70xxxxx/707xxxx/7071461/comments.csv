If you have wireless you should also stop the scan and connect to your network and then update and then start your scan. If you are connected through a cable then it should update automatically when you boot the CD."

[T],faren73,2012-03-04T01:34Z,"If you are connected to your modem or router when you boot the CD, then since this is a linux distro boot CD, it should automatically detect your connection and have no problem updating the definitions. I also had no problem updating this with a wireless PCI card installed and was able to connect to my network through a wireless connection. It all is done without having to start windows, therefore no interference from any virus or malware that may deny your service"
