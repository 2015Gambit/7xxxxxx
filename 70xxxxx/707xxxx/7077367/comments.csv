,Dirrrrt,2012-03-05T00:26Z,"Res.      : 624x352

It's crappy YouTube quality @ 360p. So it isn't any HDTV!"
,Mikhel,2012-03-05T00:44Z,"@Dirrrrt: it says HDTV because that was the source from where this RIP was made, leaving it as a 624x352."
,XoxotinhaVampira,2012-03-05T02:02Z,thank you!!!!!
,Gwenn45,2012-03-05T05:59Z,"Tnx,..xxx!!!"
,evilg0d,2012-03-05T12:17Z,"@Dirrrrt & Mikhel: Actually ""HDTV""  in this instance is unfortunately terribly misleading as it is nothing more than the release group."
