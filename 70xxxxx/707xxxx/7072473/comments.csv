Thank you!!

You are a real friend to many, many of us out here.

,Annoyme,2012-03-02T22:09Z,"You are all welcome.

2 full months of shows served today.

Starting this weekend I will be sharing some interesting old pdf scan books of conservative and free market legends. They can be read on many/most e-readers or regular computers alike.

Keep an eye out tomorrow, around noon (EST)"
,Annoyme,2012-03-02T22:22Z,"a better phrasing would be...

pdf format books of old libertarian, conservative, and free market legends. "
,charlietexas,2012-03-02T23:58Z,thanks for this.

@Annoyme -

I have a huge collection of Conservative audiobooks.  I had posted to Mininova, and some were upped to Demonoid.

Do you think I should post here?  Any requests?

,thunderbum,2012-03-03T00:37Z,"Most excellent, Annoyme - looking forward to the good reads :)

Have a safe weekend, all!"
,sel96,2012-03-03T00:38Z,"Thanks again, Annoyme. Have a great weekend!

Arsventure, got ""A Conservative History of the American Left"" by Daniel Flynn by any chance?"
,thunderbum,2012-03-03T00:39Z,"@Arsventure - if you're willing to 'up', I'm willing to 'down'.

One can't get enough of good reading! :)

Many thanks for your offer!"

Alas, that title never came out as an audiobook.

I could read my copy to you, but that would suck!!

Just kidding!  I think I will start out with books that I ripped from cassettes that never were out on CD.

In honor of the post, I will start out with the Rush books - they were what opened my eyes way back when!!
