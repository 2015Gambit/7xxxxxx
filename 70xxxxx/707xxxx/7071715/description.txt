I really should search for fantranslations before I start translating them myself >_<
The first four parts of "Capes and claws" were already translated by someone else, so here they are!

The original post of the original translator team/person (IΓÇÖm not sure whether he's a single person or not) you can find here:

Original description:  And a new little scanlation, Capes and Claws....a furry comic with pirates :)

I donΓÇÖt know how to top that, so IΓÇÖll just hope you enjoy this comic!
Note: They translated it from the German version instead of the original French, so donΓÇÖt be surprised my translation of part 1 and their translation differ a bit.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use *.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
