Only one thing, I keep getting a black screen. I used to have that on 1.8.3 as well, thats why  I stopped playing. Does anyone have a good solution? I already tried the things on Youtube, but that didnt help or it was for XP. I need a solution for W7 (64bit)"

,Dodge34,2012-03-22T02:43Z,"Sorry but for people with premium accounts, I would recommend to never use this kind of hacked version with your real premium account, you never know if the cracking team didn't install a spyware that would send them your genuine premium username and password to their email address... Be safe with this kind of thing, you don't even have to login, just don't try to login and you'll be safe and be able to play with just a nickname and nothing else."
