[/b][/color] Wild at Heart catches up with British vet Danny Trevanion and his family as they strive to expand the veterinary practice and co-exist with their neighbours through a drought which grips the region.

Danny's wife, Sarah, is busy juggling work and family life, and Lucy-Jo Hudson as daughter Rosie, is keen to prove herself an able vet assistant to her father while romancing bar owner Max.
