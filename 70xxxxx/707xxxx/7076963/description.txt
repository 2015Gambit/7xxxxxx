The Trotters join other Nag's Head regulars on a day trip to Margate.
However, possibly due to one of the Albanian radios Del has imported
and is fitted in the coach there is a fire and an explosion and, due
to a train strike, the party are forced to stay overnight.
As it is a Bank Holiday accommodation is scarce and the Trotters find
themselves in a creepy old guest house run by scary Mrs. Cresswell.
Del and Rodney go to a club where they see magician the Great Ramondo
and his assistant,Raquel, a former girl-friend of Del. Returning to the guest
house they find themselves locked out and return to Raquel's flat,where Del,
who still has feelings for her, makes a fool of himself by assuming
that Ramondo,who is actually gay, is sexually harassing her and hits him,
throwing his suit-case out of a window. On return to London Rodney makes
a similar fool of himself by assuming that Cassandra is having an affair
with her boss whilst Del finds out that the suit-case he threw out of
the window hit Boycie and Trigger.
