No income tax, no VAT and certainly no guarantee of
anything but laughs as Del and Rodders hit the
high-rise world of inner-city dealing. Trotters
Independent Traders Company (TITCO) remains
commercially unviable. Del is stuck with 125
unpredictable Latvian radio alarms, the council have
rejected his home improvement grant application and
Rodders is on a sex programme that would leave Roger
Rabbit knackered. But when our fancy-dressed caped
crusaders turn street vigilantes, they find being on
the right side of the law has its own rewards.
