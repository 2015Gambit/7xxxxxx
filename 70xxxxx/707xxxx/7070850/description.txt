I climbed Mount Everest eighty thousand years ago. I am the last
supermarket trolley alive. Aloha.

I once bet 500,000 pounds that God existed. I was a nut. Thanks
to Edgar Malroy I am better now. Really

I was made on the 3rd of November 2022, at 11.30 a.m., in an
industrial estate on the outskirts of Chelmsford.

After I rolled off the production line I was greeted by a technician
with a friendly face. She tapped me on my push-bar and said the first
words I ever heard. Which were: Whos a pretty boy then?
Which was how I discovered my gender.

For a time I considered the technician with the friendly face a
mother of sorts.
We all did I suppose.

The technician who said the first words I ever heard and tapped
me on my push-bar was called Kitty Fitzgerald. She earned 9 pounds
50 an hour in 2022. She was not incredibly enthusiastic about my
existence. She said Whos a pretty boy then? casually, as if
she was uninterested. In fact, she couldnt have cared less.

The reason why Kitty Fitzgerald couldnt have cared less about me
or the other fifty trolleys she looked after was this: three weeks
earlier she had come home to find her husband having sex with the
family vacuum cleaner.
They got a divorce and she never spoke to the vacuum cleaner again.
