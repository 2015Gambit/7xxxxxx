,TehForkinator,2012-03-21T05:45Z,"Do i need previous updates?

please tell me, cause there is 9 updates before this one, and i don't want to download them all."

I think you do NOT need them.

A good way to tell is look at the filesize of each update. If they get progressively larger [like your girlfriends...j/k] then they are usually just adding the older patches with it.

Good luck :)"
