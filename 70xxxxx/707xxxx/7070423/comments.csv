,Annoyme,2012-03-01T22:38Z,"Breitbart's death is a kick to the gut. I'm the same age he was, and do some of the same things for a living he does (on a miniscule scale)

I've liked the guy for not holding back like the mainstream media."
,omtcnry,2012-03-01T22:54Z,"Thanks.
G-d bless Anrew Breitbart!"

@Annoyme -

No kidding - I found myself with a tear rolling down my cheek when I heard the news.  I'm about 10 years older than you and Andrew, and I felt very mortal.  I just lost my Mom this Christmas, too.

He was a hero to me, and you honor his courage by what you do - helping spread the word of Conservatism and the truth.

May others be so inspired.

Thanks again.

,thunderbum,2012-03-02T04:05Z,"@Annoyme: thank you for today's podcast.

@Annoyme & Arsventure: I know what you meant by a kick to the gut. It still doesn't seem real somehow :(

Arsventure - I'm so sorry for the loss of your Mom. It's so difficult to lose a parent! I lost my Dad 5 years ago and there's still a crater in my heart. My condolences.

I am going to miss his fearlessness, tenacity, courage and everything that was good, strong and moral about him. He had more solid character than than that America-hating creature in the WH! Actually let me rephrase this - I miss him already.

My heart and prayers (yes - prayers!) goes to his family.

G_d bless them all."
,Atlantan,2012-03-02T05:19Z,"Thank you! I didn't know Andrew Breitbart, but I followed his tweets and was honored that he followed mine. Such a terrible loss. He was brillant and fearless."

@thunderbum -

Thanks for your kind words.

Let me tell you, knowing that there are people out there like you guys makes a big difference to me.

I have been through a lot of personal issues recently, and what is happening to our country is beyond appalling.

After awhile, I can't help but ask ""is it just me?""  Honestly, sometimes I think I am imagining the whole think and my sanity is slipping!  Thoughts go through my head, and I go ""no way!  you're crazy!"", then I listen to Rush and Levin concisely explain what is happening in a way that makes clear sense.

Thank God!  And thank all of you for sharing this wonderful material!

Oh - one more thing.


I hope all of you got a chance to hear Mark Levin's show on Wednesday.

It was brilliant, but also scary.  He really outlined where we are and what is at stake.  I was choked up with tears.

Also, last night he referenced a Thomas Sowell piece that really laid out what is at stake, not only for the USA, but for Western Civilization as a whole.

Vital reading, from a truly brilliant man.

Take care, everyone.  And may God be with us.

,Annoyme,2012-03-02T16:52Z,"Yep, Rush and Levin are must listen to shows. Peter Schiff is my other must listen to host.

I link to the Laura Ingraham show but don't have enough hours in the day to listen to her.

What I do for a living requires me to listen to the three hosts listed, 2 hours of Canadian news/commentary and 2 hours of UK news/commentary 5 days a week just to remain informed. Probably hit on 300-500 news links a day.

The three shows I listed keep me sane and give me a point of reference to gauge the bias in the rest of the media on a daily basis.

Thomas Sowell is one of the greatest teachers in print

read these three books...

On Classical Economics,
Basic Economics,
Applied Economics,

and you will know far more about what is going on than most of the fools graduating with 4 year degrees in economics know.

I encourage everyone here to give Peter Schiff a try. From Sebaygo1's torrent here or at schiffradio(.)com for free."

Here is a great 17:26 minute Peter Schiff interview of Andrew Breitbart last summer."
