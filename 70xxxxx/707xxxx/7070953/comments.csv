As for skipping files... the only way is to...
1. start download 
2. click files tab and wait for individual files to appear
3. right click on files to trash... and click on ""do not download""

 I used to deselect all the random extra crap no one needs like the .txt's and other junk.

 Not only that sometimes there are only a few files you want/need out of a torrent... with magnet links you gotta start downloading and THEN disable the files you don't want 1 by 1!

 Fucking waste of time, and usually by the time you disable a bunch of files from say a discography the torrent is already done lmao."

 Excellent fanboyism.

 It's pretty damn hard to get a virus from a torrent, especially when they are just video files like this one or direct cd/dvd images.

 You'd have to be downloading some pretty strange torrents to begin with to get one nowadays, so I don't really see how mac or pc matters there.."
,kallalla,2012-03-03T11:47Z,"For the people complaining about the inability to deselect files in the magnet link; those files are pretty small anyway so why should it matter? 

Why would you bother with deselecting a .txt file which takes about 10ms to download? It probably takes longer than that to deselect it. When you want to delete the movie, you delete all the extra files also.

I've had zero problems with magnet links. Fast as hell and I totally understand why tpb would opt for them. If it makes it easier for tpb to stay up I'm all for it. We see that btjunkie closed down, I for one am really happy that tpb is up"

Thank you so much mate, was clicking the link seeing no files not waiting, cancelling it then trying again - over and over, googled problems with TPB and everything, then by chance saw your comments here explaining I just had to be patient for a few seconds and click ok and that it would come through- so thanks for that;

@ All you other TWATS

I'm not even a noob, just didn't know about the whole magnet thing, and its 'PEOPLE sharing with PEOPLE' - thats the whole point in torrents is it not, and you can't even leave a comment sharing your knowledge on what to do, rather you'd just leave some snide remark about it - YOU should all be banned from the site, if you don't understand what the word 'share' means look it up ya dim witted fucks!!

Magnets links start slow, it does not take long to pick up on others IP's before you're downloading at your typical rate.

Wake the fuck up and get educated.

@TheAsset

Wake the fuck up, PC's still dominate the computing scene. As such there are more virus' developed for PC's!

There aren't enough Mac's in use on this planet for any hacker to give a fuck.

The point being, why create a virus for:

1 Mac to the 100 PC's to it. Pointless.

For example, I saw the first comment, checked the reception to this movie on wiki, and decided not to waste my time watching it.

Thanks for the heads up, sergiocarp, don't be put off."

,samy007,2012-03-28T16:25Z,"I don't understand WHY people still hate magnet links.

WAKE UP ! You don't have to download every files from a magnet link if you don't want to, you CAN select the files one by one just like before when you could dl the .torrent file.

Most of the BitTorrent clients are not yet build to support magnets, they have an awful time trying to reconstruct the file trees when you click on it (blank pop-up dialog with no files on it and you have to click OK to dl everything in a single row).

If you wait a few months, EVERY bittorrent clients will support magnets, and no one will have to suffer this blank pop up anymore. It's a fact !

BUT, if you don't want to wait around, STOP bitching about it, and USE one of the client that ALREADY support magnets. 

-> BitComet client ALWAYS load the file tree from a magnet, it's just like old times! 
It's even better when you look at it: you can select the files you want to download from a magnet, and the program also stores the magnet link for you to use it later on in order to dl the rest of the files you unchecked.

STOP CRYING AND DOWNLOAD BITCOMET, PLEASE !

Magnets are the future of torrent downloading, get this in your small minds people !"

In µTorrent, you can do that by going to Options → Preferences → General and then pressing the “Associate with magnet URIs” button "

A/9
V/9
M/3

The audio and video was excellent but i gave 9 for both because i believe 10 is reserved for Blu-Ray?

As for the movie, there were a lot of funny parts but it was just dumb, and its been done before. Is hollywood that bereft of ideas that we need to see another movie about a fat white guy who gets the smoking hot girl and is involved in situations with snoop dogg wannabe's and dropping the f-bomb in front of little kids and having them dropping the f-bomb also...Seriously? Everyone is different and there will be a lot of people who like this type of thing but i would say don't expect anything but cheap laughs and toilet humor and you'll enjoy.

Cheers"

,crazyoliv,2012-08-13T02:33Z,"The movie sucks.
I use to be a good customer of J.Hill and S.Rockwell but that time they didn't sold it out at all.
The editor is a twat. the filmmaker made it grotesque. Its cheap. Acting sucks. Totally misscast. It isn't even funny. Hill and Rockwell made their worst performance ever. THey would have desirved a Razzie or two.
There is thousand of good movie around there. This one really sucks."
