The Velvet Underground & Nico is the debut album by American rock band The Velvet Underground 
and vocal collaborator Nico. It was originally released in March 1967 by Verve Records. Recorded 
in 1966 during Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia event tour, The Velvet 
Underground & Nico would gain notoriety for its experimentalist performance sensibilities, as 
well as the focus on controversial subject matter expressed in many of their songs.

Though a commercial failure upon release, the record has since become one of the most influential 
and critically acclaimed rock albums in history, appearing at number thirteen on Rolling Stone 
magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as well as being added to the 2006 National 
Recording Registry by the Library of Congress
