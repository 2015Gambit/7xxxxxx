,drukpa,2012-03-05T11:15Z,"Whats wrong with PB torrent links?

Suddenly cannot DL torrents, just keeps opening new empty window on Chromium (haven't tried on other browsers yet).
Strange, I never had any problems with PB, anyone experiences the same?"
,robym3,2012-03-05T15:39Z,"just click OK on empty window, it will download. it is not about TPB. it is ACTA etc shit :P"
,drukpa,2012-03-05T21:26Z,"I understand what it is now, and still cannot use the link - empty window is empty window. This is supposed to DL from torrent client, but I use rtorrent from terminal - not a wide spread way of ""torrenting"", so I have to patch my rtorrent in order to use TPB - I really didn't expect this from the home guys. Don't feel like patching now, need torrents quickly, so disappointedly I must halt TPB usage for a while. Feel awful about it "
,AnomandarisPurake,2012-03-12T02:04Z,I CAN'T get the torrent!! Can someone please explain in simple English how I can get it?
,SerSpec-V,2012-03-17T01:24Z,^^^Click on it !!! Is that simple enough for you???
