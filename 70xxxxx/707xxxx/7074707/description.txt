Premiered by the Opera De Paris in 1870, and inspired by the fantastical writings of E.T.A. Hoffmann, 
Coppélia tells the story of a young man who becomes besotted with an exquisite automaton and 
is finally brought to his senses by his fiancée. In their production from the magnificent Palais Garnier, 
choreographer Patrice Bart in his final production and 
designer Ezio Toffolutti explore the storys darker side while doing full justice to the exuberance 
and elegance of Delibes glorious score.
