,madkad,2012-03-04T04:49Z,"I'm not able to download anything. The green ""get this torrent"" arrows are not to be found. Please help me"
,dodsy2008,2012-03-04T05:23Z,"@madkad....
I've noticed that too (on several PB torrents lately). Use the magnet link though...and it saves to your download folder. UNFORTUNATELY though...you have to download the entire torrent. (i.e...U can't select just one music track to download and seed)"
,dodsy2008,2012-03-04T05:32Z,P.S.......@ExtremeZone.....THANKS VERY MUCH for all your time N effort. I've never been disappointed with your ups...SO THANX.

,SuperFulcrum,2012-03-04T09:42Z,"@dodsy2008 you dont need to download the whole torr,if you have utorrent just go to Files and right click on that file and click Don't download "
