The SD x264 TV Releasing Standards 2012
L TT TTL INTRO

x264 has become the most advanced video codec over the past few years
Compared to XviD, it is able to provide higher quality and compression at
greater SD resolutions. It also allows better control and transparency over
encoding settings. With CRF in the mix, we can also ensure that a diverse
array of material will get the most appropriate bitrate for them and not
arbitrary and fixed sizes. This standard aims to bring quality control back
to SD releases. There are many standalone players/streamers such as TviXHour, WDTV HD Media Player, Boxee, Xtreamer, PS3, XBOX 360, iPad, &
HDTVs that can playback H264 and AAC encapsulated in MP4

The SD x264 TV section was formed to separate releases from the ruleless
world of TV-XviD. This document will cover the rules and guidelines for
