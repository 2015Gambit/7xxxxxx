hey people, there is a very good Android (and iphone) app called, TuneIn. i have the Motorola Xoom Android tablet, 10 in screen, super great OS.

you can listen to any radio station, in the world.

so, go to Ktlk and you can listen to the full 3 hr of Randi, but maybe that station also repeats the 1st hr too.

NOTE, you can download Thom Hartmann free here,

i know, we all want to time shift and not have to listen live. oh, you can record the audio using TurnIn Pro, but the file has to stay on your tabet or smartphone, if you wanted to make an audio copy, you would have to play the audio into another computer or an mp3 player/recorder, in real time."
