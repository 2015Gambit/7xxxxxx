How, in a nation as wealthy as America, can the economy simply stop working for people at large, while super-serving those at the very top? This weekend, in an encore broadcast of the premiere episode of [i]Moyers & Company[/i], Bill Moyers looks at AmericaΓÇÖs economic disparity and investigates how it happened and whoΓÇÖs to blame. His detectives: political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, authors of [i]Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer ΓÇö And Turned Its Back on the Middle Class[/i]. Through exhaustive research and analysis, Hacker and Pierson ΓÇö whom Moyers regards as the ΓÇ£Sherlock Holmes and Dr. WatsonΓÇ¥ of economics ΓÇö detail important truths behind a 30-year economic assault against the middle class.

Moyers calls the book ΓÇ£the best account IΓÇÖve seen of how politicians rewrote the rules to create a winner-take-all economy that favors the 1% over everyone else, putting our once and future middle class in peril.ΓÇ¥

The show includes testimony of middle class Americans at a Senate hearing about the impact of hard times on families, as well as an essay on how Occupy Wall Street reflects a widespread belief that politics no longer works for ordinary people, including footage we took at the OWS rally from October-December 2011.
