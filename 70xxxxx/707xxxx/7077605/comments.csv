The keygen is working. Just tested it again.
1. Run setup and install Transcribe.
2. Exit Transcribe if you have started the program.
3. Copy keygen to Transcribe installation folder.
4. Run keygen.
5. Click Patch, choose Transcribe.
6. Click Generate, copy generated key.
7. Run Transcribe.
8. Click Enter new license key. 
9. Paste generated key, click OK.
Done!"
