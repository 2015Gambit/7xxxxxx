or just all other languages but English?

And since this is the Digital Deluxe Edition, 
is the bonus material included?"
,icelaw,2012-03-03T02:54Z,"That comment i made before, 
disregard that,
read the torrent title wrong and thought this was the complete game.."
,gabrielrmt,2012-03-03T03:03Z,can someone tell me why when i try to download one torrent now it tells me that the magnets liks are with prob?
,narmishe,2012-03-03T06:23Z,@gabrielrmt just install the latest utorrent client!
,aloayzab,2012-03-03T20:56Z,"How do we change the lenguage? I manage to change the installer leng but this mean install origin. There is no lenguage option in configuratio. And no SKU.ini, just SKU.bin. And nothing in the conf.xml. There is a option in-game? or we are gonna play this is russian?"
,pisoY,2012-03-04T09:26Z,"@aloayzab, you will be able to change language in-game under options. But only for subtitles. Digital Deluxe Edition, have Russian voice, some says it have english, some says it doesnt not. Just to make sure, I downloaded second torrent also (the one with N7 in tag), and I would advise you to the same.  You never know..."
,aloayzab,2012-03-04T22:19Z,thank you very much i will download other torrent too. btw you now where is the voice lang file? maybe that way we know if ther is english or russian voice.
,aloayzab,2012-03-04T22:35Z,"Well I dont find any lang file but I dowloaded another torrent and it have a install logcat in wich it says that the language is english... so I belive that the other copies are not installed ones, just a full copy of a dvd. I hope that the default voice is english."
,ozkan112,2012-03-06T00:05Z,"THANK YOUUU İT WORKS

""rename GDFBinary_en_US to GDFBinary_ru_RU

First there is already one  GDFBinary_ru_RU there, And second, there are no such files in Biogame folder."
