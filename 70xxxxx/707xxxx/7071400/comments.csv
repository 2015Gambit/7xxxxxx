Po3 1-5 are basic PDF files and should work however you go to read them, they should open in most ebook readers. I know i can open them in ibooks, adobe and kindle.

Po3 6 is a azw file, which means that it was purchased and has copyright shit going along.
no solution other than to see if you can find it online somewhere else or buy the book. I've been looking but haven't found anything yet."
