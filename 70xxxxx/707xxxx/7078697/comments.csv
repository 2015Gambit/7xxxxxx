,bigbud13,2012-03-23T01:04Z,Doe this include mark of the assasin dlc??
,Shahoul,2012-03-29T12:13Z,works for me. but it doesnt seem to include Mark of the Assassin. its a bit strange though that they are making bug fix (instead of balance) updates so late
,lozada1991,2012-04-12T18:04Z,just click the files and you'll see what's included.

,billias1020,2012-04-24T01:55Z,any help with the signature dlc not found after the update?
,mojo-666,2012-05-22T19:16Z,"The crack and DLC also work for the Mac version:

1. Let the game update itself to 1.04
2. copy the file crack/bin_ship/DragonAge2.exe from this torrent to /Applications/Dragon Age II.app/Contents/Resources/transgaming/c_drive/Program Files/Dragon Age 2/bin_ship"
