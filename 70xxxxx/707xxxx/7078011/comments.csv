If it ain't broken, don't fix it: .avi was fine. Morons :(("
,driver-8,2012-03-05T08:28Z,"@7Sept

Sorry you are technologically challenged. I suggest you stick to watching the show on TV or recording it on your betamax. "
,TheSageM,2012-03-05T09:41Z,"7Sept get a life. Who the fuck to you think you are to insult the legend that is EZTV? You should be banned from TPB just for that, you cunt!"
,7Sept,2012-03-05T10:28Z,Yeah... record the tv and post it on the Internet... what an extraordinary achievement!
,chaos924,2012-03-05T13:06Z,"Why are you complaining? No one's making you download it. If you don't like x264, download the .avi version."
,ben7530,2012-03-05T13:50Z,"@ 7 sept.

Were you born of Sept. 7, 2011? x264 has been the preferred format for hi-def releases for at LEAST 2 years..."

,Nowis24,2012-03-05T17:45Z,do I need to dl utorrent for this or can I still use Bitcomet for this(if upgraded)?
,ViolentC,2012-03-06T02:44Z,"@ Nowis24
Bit torrent is still the shit bro... click the magnet and wait 30-90 seconds for the file to show up. will apear to be an empty torrent for a moment, be patient (don't stop it, and delete it and try again... jus wait)"
,TheNarrator23,2012-03-06T07:35Z,"@7Sept: Oh no, the series that you have been pirating for free have changed format. What has this world come to! IS THERE NO GOD!

Seriously dude, shut the fuck up. EZTV does a hell of a job, and if they want to change the format, so be it. Yes, it's not the same file as my other 200 episodes of FG, but atleast it's free.

BTW, thx EZTV, you rock ;)"
,kjans1978,2012-03-06T10:57Z,"I've enjoyed eztv's torrents so many times I felt *obliged* to dedicate my first tpb comment ever.

7sept deserves a red-dick next to his username.  It will make clear what he stands for, next to extv's green-skull."
,Brut_Man,2012-03-06T14:54Z,"How are people having problems with this new format or whatever it is, it works exactly the same for me as it always has, I haven't had to change anything."
,will240,2012-03-06T14:55Z,Why can't I open it with magnet links? :( I have the latest version of utorrent. Please help.
,dA_dk4ever,2012-03-07T01:30Z,BEST COUCHGAG EVER!
,PlatinuM195,2012-03-07T05:49Z,"Finally, been waiting forever for avi to die out. Thanks guys :D"
,ust2,2012-03-12T03:15Z," Where are tonight's episodes guys? They were all new.

 It's been over 2 hours since the first aired (cleveland show) and i'm starting to worry they aren't going to get uploaded :(

 They normally get up'd about 10-20min after each show ends on TV."
,ust2,2012-03-12T04:28Z," Go to kickass torrents (kat.ph or just google) for tonight's episodes.

 I'm not sure why they aren't uploading to TPB this time, but they are available over there and uploaded by the same users."
,8Infinit,2012-03-12T09:22Z,"@7Sept- I won't flame you because I understand the frustration. For some reason, x264 videos like this just do not play correctly on my laptop they get strange blocks and pixels that make the videos unwatchable). However, instead of being needlessly angry, try finding a workable solution. I suggest Pazera's Free MP4 to AVI converter. It's totally free and works great."
,dallanlee,2012-03-13T01:47Z,"@eztv
First and foremost, thank you! I REALLY appreciate the 264 encoding and mp4 format. iDevices rule the world and this makes viewing shows on the iPad/iPhone etc. so much simpler among other benefits!

@7Sept & 2 8Infinit
Notice you're a minority here?

@7Sept aka DumbAss
""If it ain't broken.."" Well xvid/avi is ""broken""; it's outdated and inferior to 264/mp4/mkv. You need to stop expecting people to cater to the minority. I have been waiting for avi to become a term used alongside tapes and cassettes. haha It's not there yet but hopefully soon! I absolutely refuse to download movies in avi but TV shows have been the exception because I rarely find mp4 or mkv. The change is greatly APPRECIATED!"
,danrman,2012-03-20T07:37Z,"If you are going to release hd files, at least do it in mp4. Most of the people who are upset about the switch to mkv, are upset because devices like the 
Xbox 360, th PS3, and other things people use to watch movies on their TV, don't play mkv files."
,expometty,2012-03-30T01:29Z,What danrman said.
,xViviDx,2012-04-18T08:57Z,7Sept: moron. mp4 and mkv 264 povide vbr and vfr. meaning a video of 999 kbps can range up to 2500 kbps when needed in large scenes. avi is more constant bit rate. .264 mp4 is best for HD videos. learn a thing or 2 b4 you try bagin ppl out on shit u dont know
