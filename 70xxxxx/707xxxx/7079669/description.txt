Spider-Man v1 (1963-1998) Chronological

This is a chronological collection of all Spider-Man titles running from 1963-1998. It includes all core titles and relevant limited series and one-shots. Also included is Secret Wars 1, due to the large impact it had on the main storyline. 
Whether this is complete or not will always be a matter of opinion. The decision to not include more sidestories was because it's hard to draw the line for what should and should not be included. Thus I leave it up to the reader to decide if and what they want to add. To me this is complete.
Also to note is that this will fit perfectly on 3 DVDs if split properly: DVD1 1963-03-10 - 1985-02-40, DVD2 1985-02-60 - 1993-05-80, DVD3 1993-05-90 - 1998-11-60
In a torrent this big there are bound to be errors, if enough are found and reported to make it worth it I will release an updated version at some point.
In closing I want to say that a large amount of work has gone into this, my own and the work of the scanners and collectors/seeders. All I ask in return (and on behalf of all the other people who made this possible) is that you SEED AND ENJOY!

The ordering has been done using the following priority list:
1. Release date
2. Relative ordering of issues on the Marvel Chronology Project (http://chronologyproject.com/)
3. When the above does not apply, my own judgement[/color][/b]
This means that issues have never been moved away from their month of release, even if they fit better storywise in other months or even years. The idea is that you will read every issue in approximately the same order you would have if you were buying every issue when it was released.

Every file has received the following treatment:
1. All ads removed
2. All split spreads combined into one image
3. All wrongly rotated images fixed
4. All folders within the archives removed (some reader programs have issues with deep folder structures)
5. All image files renamed to 01.jpg, 02.jpg... (to make sure all reader programs get them in the right order.)
6. All files packed in CBR format
7. The files themselves renamed to a consistent naming scheme, starting with YYYY-MM-XX where XX is a number used to order issues within the same month
