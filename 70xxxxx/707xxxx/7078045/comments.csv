[V],rr-ne,2012-03-05T04:51Z,Do you release other users torrents?
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T04:57Z,no why would you say that?
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T05:05Z,And if you got a problem with my torrents don't come on them it's as simple as that
[V],rr-ne,2012-03-05T05:30Z,"I was only asking. (Because ""ettv"" has the same file at the exact same size.)

174.28 MiB

Alot of your torrents are 175 avg, (Tv show uploaders are around that size.)"
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T05:38Z,"just becuz we have the same size doesn't mean anything

And plus most uploaders ""eztv"" ""ettv"" ""TvTeam"" have the same size uploads 

Am i an exception becuz i don't have a green skull in which i have been denied of every time i ask??   "
[V],rr-ne,2012-03-05T06:34Z,You're not allowed to ask for a Green Skull.
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T06:42Z,"well it doesn't matter anyway whether TPB acknowledges me as the good uploader that i am or not

The main point is that i'm not the only 1 that has the same size torrent as a particular uploader and picking me out of the group isn't fair to me  "
[V],rr-ne,2012-03-05T06:48Z,"Well, I apologize.

Sorry for the trouble."
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T07:11Z,no problem bro 
[V],rr-ne,2012-03-05T09:54Z,"Are you a Simpsons fan? or just uploading them for others?

Im a huge Simpsons fan!! got all 501 episodes on my harddrive and ps3"
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T10:07Z,not really just more uploading i don't think it is as funny as it use to be
[V],rr-ne,2012-03-05T10:30Z,"Yeah, i agree. the 90s Simpsons was the best!!"
[T],xCrazy0328x,2012-03-05T10:59Z,"yea after 23 seasons its like how much further r they gonna try to go

Everything has to end sometime 

I guess since people still watch they won' t be ending anytime soon"
[V],rr-ne,2012-03-05T18:25Z,i heard from multiple sources Season 25 will be the last of The Simpsons
