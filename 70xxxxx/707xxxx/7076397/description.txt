Greatest Hits (2004)




In the late '70s, when the fortunes of Motown Records seemed to be flagging, Rick James came along and rescued the company, providing funky hits that updated the label's style and saw it through into the mid-'80s. Actually, James had been with Motown earlier, though nothing had come of it. After growing up in Buffalo and running away to join the Naval Reserves, he ran away from the Navy to Toronto, where he was in a band with future Buffalo Springfield members Neil Young and Bruce Palmer, and with Goldy McJohn, later of Steppenwolf. As the Mynah Birds, they signed to Motown and recorded, though no record was ever released.

James had a journeyman's career playing bass in various group before signing again to Motown as an artist, songwriter, and producer. His first single, 'You and I' (May 1978), topped the R&B charts and reached the pop Top 40. 'Mary Jane' (September 1978) was another hit. Both were on James' debut album, Come Get It! (June 1978), which went gold. Subsequent efforts were not as successful, though Bustin' Out of L Seven (January 1979) featured the R&B hit 'Bustin' Out' (April 1979). James returned to form with the number one R&B hit 'Give It to Me Baby' (March 1981), featured on the million-selling Street Songs (April 1981), which also featured the hit 'Super Freak.'
