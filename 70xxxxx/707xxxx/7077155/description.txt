Antonio's parents were murdered when he was a child. As an adult, he is transformed into a relentless bounty hunter, code-named "Mandrill," with the sole aim of finding the murderer and avenging his parents. Mandrill's only weakness has always been women, so he asks his uncle, a "Don Juan" expert, to instruct him in the arts of seduction.
