,SBVIPER,2012-07-05T09:14Z,I didn't watch this but I did check long enough to see that it is in English.  Later in the day I receive an email from out service provider that Warner Bros sent them a detection of use of their product and if Cox Communications receives further complaints that they would discontinue my service.  Has anyone else faced this and is there a way to deal with it? Thanks! :)
