Meet Will. his evolved, sensitive nature is why his awesome wife, Theresa married him. But Will and his friends find themselves wondering, in a world of Axe ads and manscaping, what does it really mean to be a guy anymore? Will is more interested in finding the perfect gift for his son Nathan's 13th birthday than in doing his job selling insurance; sensitive soul Craig still pines for his college ex, Lisa; and Kenny clamps down on his anger and asks himself, "what would Tobey Maguire do?," when his ex, Brenda, starts seeing a guy who is everything he's not and much better looking.
