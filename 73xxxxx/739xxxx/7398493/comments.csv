[T],duranie,2012-07-02T02:24Z,"It's been said that AFG don't cap shows themselves, they just take the x264 releases and re-encode them to xvid.  So, unfortunately errors happen. 

Upgrade your hardware.. and go with (the much better quality) x264! You'll save yourself headaches down the road, I promise!
