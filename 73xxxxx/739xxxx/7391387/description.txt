but also has a dedicated mini-magazine called iPlay, where you can get incredible 
content covering everything iPad, iPod and iPhone. iCreate is sumptuously designed 
and it not only keeps you informed of whats going on in the world of Apple, but it is 
also there to help you get the most out of whichever device you own. Tutorials cover 
the entire iLife suite and professional applications as well as helping you make the 
most of your mobile Apple devices too, whether thatΓÇÖs an iPod touch, iPad or iPhone.
