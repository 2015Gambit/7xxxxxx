Total Immersion Four Strokes Made Easy: L1 Master Basic Balance-  iPad optimized!

Total Immersion Swimming "Four Strokes Made Easy" contains many of the same drills as "Freestyle Made Easy" presented in a different way with different swimmers.

We have also made this stuff EASIER to master because we have BROKEN DOWN INTO INDIVIDUAL LESSONS AND DRILLS!

A brilliant swimming technique that makes water your friend and maximizes efficiency, effectiveness, balance, symmetry, enjoyment, beauty.

Technique matters.

Watching an entire DVD in a linear fashion (or listening to one of Terry Laughlin's lectures or presentations) simply does not enable mastery of the lessons.

And the rate he dishes out his info on video, in lecture or in presentations is always too much too fast.

Because each lesson builds on the previous, it's ineffective and pointless to roll along watching the video until you can correctly implement the principal being taught.

We have found that outside of the water, individual lessons on the iPad work great for very young swimmers, particularly with water babies.

TIF = Total Immersion Freestyle, L = lesson, D = drill, TIFSF = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle, TIFSFB = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle-Backstroke

Because both freestyle and backstroke are "Long Axis" (LA) strokes they are dealt with at the same time in the TIFSFB drills.
