What mod is that?"
,fabiencolombo,2012-06-27T09:04Z,"it's a mod I got from a chinese forum. It is integrated in my torrent.
It will add 90 hentai readable in game.
They are stored in a chest in breezehome"
,homiloko,2012-06-28T14:13Z,"I've seen the screenshots and man, this is some magnificent work :D

One doubt though, does it work with v1.5 or 1.6?

I'm a modder too, I have over 200 mods and when I updated to v1.6... Let's just say I had to do a fresh install, and root out which mods stopped working (causing CTDs) xD lots of work..
The good thing though, is that I've come across this great tool called 'Mod Organizer' (you can easily find it on nexus, it's different from NMM) and it is very unique in that each mod is stored separately in it's own folder (even after it is installed) so you don't get a bloated data folder, and activating/deactivating a mod is as simple as checking a box (similar to activating an esp, but it works for any mod including textures)
Since you seem as OC as I am, and like to organize everything, I figured you would like it ^^
I'm running on Monli too, except its a modified version (found on loverslab), and have a few chinese mods too.. I'll be sure to try your mods out, there seems to be plenty of new stuff for me , I think we have similar visions on skyrim (:"
,fabiencolombo,2012-06-30T04:12Z,"Thanks for the com.
I forgot to specifie which version I use, sorry.
I still use the 1.4, so I guess you should be fine with 1.5 or higher.

Thanks for the mod organizer thingy. I usual;y install all my mod manually, especially textures mods. I use the nmm for my dance mods though, easier to swap around :-)"
