Hello everyone. This is my first torrent so be nice :-)
Here is what I offer you. A file that is 10.9Gb zipped and +20GB unzipped.

This file contains all the textures and mods I gathered since the game came out as well as a mod I made myself to replace ALL NPC ingame with anime models.

To use,, just extract everything in your data folder and check all the .esp.

Make a backup beforehand just in case.

If you don't like my anime mod, just uncheck all loliXXX.esp and esm.

There done.

Be careful those texture are quiet demanding on your rig.
I play with:

I7 2600K oc @4.5GHz
SLI MSI N580GTX Lightning twin frozrz III oc
8 GB of DDR3
And windows 7 64bits.

I know most of you don't have a SLI setup, so I tested it with ONLY 1 of my 580
I manage to keep an above 30FPS in most cases.
I use a personal enb as well, if you don't use any enb, you can add 30FPS :-)

Here is a link to see the result:
