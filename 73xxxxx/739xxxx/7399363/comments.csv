,fordiv,2012-06-30T04:11Z,Low quality. Tonight I'll try to make a good ISO image and seed for 24 hours. Will report here.
,fordiv,2012-06-30T05:18Z,"This avi file has very low quality. Blame me for not reviewing the results before seeding. PLease download instead my full DVD ISO image uploaded here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7399665. I'll be seeding for at least a week. Sorry to those who were disapointed with the quality of the small file. This one is good, I promise. Please seed back. "
