,nox150690,2012-06-28T20:54Z,"Thanks for the upload. Is there any way that I can get the server to sync with my PC'S time,like the real server's do?"
,Conan_513,2012-06-28T21:32Z,"nox150690 time sync is default in 1.7 :)

Very important!
If your ArmA 2 not legal, you must change your default keys to generated keys! 
Otherwise your DayZ character is not in safe!"
,nox150690,2012-06-28T22:17Z,"I have a legal copy of ArmA II , OA and the DLC'S. I just want a LAN server for me and my brother. The time does not seem to sync at all. While it does have 24/7 time, it does not sync with ""real"" time."
,snifabus,2012-06-28T22:30Z,is this everything i need to play dayz it looks so fun i really wanna try it
,Conan_513,2012-06-29T05:58Z,"Known problems/bug and solutions

On server startup you get missing ""arma2profile"" error
- You not copied the server into the ArmA 2 CO folder

On server startup you get missing pbo error
- You have Steam version of ArmA 2 and you skipped the 0 point

Stuck on Loading screen or after join you see ""Wrong version...""
- Disable UAC in Windows 7 fix these problems

Vehicles not spawn on the map
- Apply the Vehicles Installer (not 100% yet)"
,Fredrik-88,2012-06-29T09:59Z,"@Conan_513

Disabling UAC didn't do the trick for me. I'm still stuck at loading screen with the bar, as it looks like, is on 100% but I can't continue.

Is there something I've done wrong? I followed your instructions to the letter.

(I don't have Steam or Retail)"
,nox150690,2012-06-29T10:43Z,Fixed the day/night problem. Just required a server restart.
,Conan_513,2012-06-29T12:28Z,Fredrik-88 stop or uninstall mysql if you have and do not close the popup cmd window when you start the server
,Conan_513,2012-06-29T14:33Z,"this torrent doesn't work sorry but here is the fixed version:
