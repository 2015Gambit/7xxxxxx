I didnt know IV5 was finally out, last time I looked it said it was rescheduled to something ridiculous like DEC 2012 - Ill check"

,shanerianne,2012-07-04T21:02Z,"thank you MrDowntown, you just gave my family another free dinner. Why? for every comics I download from all of you, its equivalent here in our country almost 2 kilos of pork meat. Although I still buy original comics for the sake of patronizing the comic industry, you just save me another great title especially from Mark Millar. Thanks again."
