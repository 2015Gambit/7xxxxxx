HIT GIRL #1 (MARK MILLAR) [Marvel ICON]

Hit-Girl spins off into her own blood-soaked series by the sales-busting creative team of Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. This story takes place between Kick Ass volumes 1 and 2 as Mindy McCready tries to settle into life as a regular schoolgirl, but wants nothing more to be dispensing hot justice to the scum of New York City. Her mother and step-father think shes doing her homework, but in reality shes taken Kick Ass on as her sidekick and training him up to punch, shoot and stabΓÇª just like Daddy would have wanted. A limited edition variant by Leandro Fernandez will be released for this issue.
