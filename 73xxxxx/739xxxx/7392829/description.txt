1)  Part 1 
First of a two-part documentary following the lives of people from the Jewish community in Manchester. Bernette Clarke, a modern orthodox mother of three, travels to a part of Israel so ultra-orthodox that men have to walk on a separate side of the street to women; boutique owner Joel Lever throws opens his doors and explains why his shop is the place to be for every Jewish occasion from birth onwards; Jack Aizenberg boards a plane to Poland to visit the place where he was born and where he last saw his family alive during the Holocaust; and Rabbi Zevi Saunders talks about the work of a rabbi and reveals how he was unlucky in love until he met his fiancee Erica on the internet.
