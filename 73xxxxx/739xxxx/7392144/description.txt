Falcon medicine exists for centuries, but in the past 10-15 years tremendous progress and new development of diseases and treatment methods have been made. It has always been a challenge to treat these beautiful birds of prey and the challenge continues until now. Falcons, falconry and falcon medicine are important in Abu Dhabi and the United Arab Emirates which can be regarded as the cradle of modern falcon medicine in the 21st century. Having treated more than 30,000 falcons over the past years, the author feels that the time has come to share his outstanding experience with the veterinarians' and falconers' community for the sake of these incredible birds of prey - to enhance their living conditions and to improve medical falcon health care world-wide. This book is based on his experience of a large variety of different cases and is therefore very practical-oriented. It is intended to be a useful handbook for all interested people working with falcons such as veterinarians, veterinary students, falconers and raptor rehabilitation workers. The aim of this book is not to include all research that has ever been done on falcons, but to highlight those issues that are really working out in practice. It includes 17 chapters ranging from history of falcon medicine to different diseases up to first aid and intensive care medicine.
