way to go ubisoft"
,popino01,2012-06-28T23:04Z,"@ChiliNoMoreX You gotta be kidding, the game is pretty fun, not the best ever but still pretty good."
,couteau,2012-06-28T23:55Z,"so still no winxp compatibility, excellent."
,nicklas1015,2012-06-29T03:52Z,Still no fix for driver crashing... UBI can fuck themselves
[V],blaze69,2012-06-29T07:09Z,"@ popino01

Ur Totally wrong. Game Is a Waste of Multiplayer . Real Lame. Not what I and Most Peeps Expected From Ubifuck. 

As Skidrow Team Said 
Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!  I did Enjoy Single Player. and Thought I buy cuz Of MP. one Of The Worst :(

Bought On Steam and Regretted It."
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-06-29T08:07Z,Totally agreed with blaze69.

,aigaleo12,2012-06-29T12:08Z,does it fix gunsmith problem?
,lutakflint12,2012-06-29T16:28Z,Does this FIX the XP compatibility Issue??????

,lutakflint12,2012-06-29T16:32Z,srry for the double post.
,couteau,2012-06-29T17:51Z,"I heard Ubisoft is making new game atm, otherwise than first fixing their goddamn game. I guess they don't give a fuck anymore about PC versions of games."
,GObonzo,2012-06-30T04:02Z,"playing now and loving the single player. only one's better i've played are the Battlefield&Bad Company games. mp demo was okay.
game has run as well as any modern game at release these days. think car companies and game developers have started saving shitloads of money having the consumer do all the testing of new products."
,david91428,2012-06-30T11:25Z,this update uninstalled my game... wtf?
,kabutowarez,2012-06-30T21:52Z,"WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
the first update(v1.1) installed the files from the patch on ""C:Program Files (x86)Ubisoft"", and I have the game installed on ""G:Tom Clancys Ghost Recon Future Soldier"", and now, this v1.2 has put them on ""C:Windows""!!!!! And i got lucky i saw the destination on the bottom of the install window, this would explain a lot of problems if it happens to others!

,gvazdas,2012-07-01T22:25Z,"Blaze, if you bought in on steam, why the fuck are you commenting on a pirate website?"
[V],blaze69,2012-07-02T01:16Z,"@ gvazdas

Because I Downloaded The Pirated Version. Then Bought On Steam
Dumb Fuck Read."
,IndigoAK,2012-07-02T10:32Z,"There is no Windows XP ""issue"" people.  The game uses a DirectX 10/11 engine and therefore doesn't support Windows XP.  There will be no patch that enabled a DirectX 9 render path, so you can just stop asking."
,couteau,2012-07-02T12:30Z,^ keep trolling bro.
,lutakflint12,2012-07-02T13:45Z,"@IndigoAK
Wrong, the game is meant to be played on windows xp sp3, win 7 and vista , there will be a patch for win xp sp3 soon enough..."
,sr2005,2012-07-02T17:51Z,"I have a problem.I have played all other previous missions fine.Now Iam in the Tiger Dust mission.Yesterday night when I was playing tiger dust mission the game suddenly crashes and even today when I try to load continue campaign the game crashes on the loading screen and a error massege crop up something like this:""Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library""
 Runtime Error! the point is that still now I can play all other previous missions but not tiger dust.Does anyone have any fix?"
,IndigoAK,2012-07-02T22:34Z,"Then why is there no official statement from Ubisoft about this patch?

All I can find on the web are statements from random people saying that support will be added in a patch.  The game's system requirements on Steam don't mention Windows XP anywhere, the Ubisoft official forums make no mention of an XP patch outside of normal members who claim it's coming.  Contacting Ubisoft support directly about Windows XP will simply get you a response saying you don't meet the requirements to run the game.

And let's not forget that Ubisoft has a known history of promising patches and then not actually delivering them.  With the issues this game is having and its poor sales, they have no incentive to butcher their engine for an API it wasn't designed to run on."
,couteau,2012-07-03T00:56Z,"the only place where XP is not mentioned is on ubisoft forums, reason for that is - they forgot or just didn't want to add XP as supported OS, obviously too busy delaying the game.
check out canyourunit.com it clearly says XP is supported. but we will see."
,Dimmis80,2012-07-03T16:46Z,Hey guys.I have the black box version and i was cool with the game.!All of a sudden in one mission that my guys needs to go prone under a wall one of them stuck very close to the next wall and i can't continue the mission.He just wont coming to the door that we must take down.And i tried loading the save game but then it happen to an other guy from my teamates over and over again.So i decided to use this update.I install it copy everything from Skidrow folder to games folder and Orbit folder but when i try to run now the game first it wont take me to the login screen to write the pasword that i read in the install notes but it run the game and it give me a Fatal Error and the game now wont run at all.!!So is this 1.2 update compatible for the black box version.?Is there if its not compatible an update for the black box.??Anyone with the same problem with that damn mission is there a solution.???Or i have to unistall and then install the game again for the 1.2 update to work.????And does it fixes the pathfinding problem.?I hope u guys can help me and thanks in advance.

,thcfreak666,2012-07-05T20:56Z,DoesnÂ´t work with win 7 ! DonÂ´t waste your Time!
,brianxxx,2012-07-07T20:20Z,"This game and these updates all worked fine for me. Running Win 7 64 bit. I installed game as directed in NFO, then installed 1st patch, then installed 2nd patch.

This is not fake and it did work for me."
,sage1210,2012-07-08T11:23Z,"this game is far worst for the stupid camper and idiot roof top sniper that think they will have the good hide out and untouchable for them in this game.

trust me, i already found a lot of complain from them. including those cod haters.

,rhea.duran42,2012-07-08T15:42Z,"I still don't get why people would still voluntarily use  XP. Outdated, broken piece of crap OS."
,NotInLove,2012-07-10T23:56Z,Anybody got a problem with crash in the map Valiant Hammer `? .. 
,iittopper,2012-07-11T09:40Z,"@dimisis80
to all those who is facing problem like him , do this
1) block future soldier and launcher with firewall
2) remove your xbox 360 controller or any other controller 
3) run the game as administrator 
4) enjoy"
