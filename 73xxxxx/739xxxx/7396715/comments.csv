,CapeCodSmith,2012-06-29T03:50Z,Thanks weebey7....but everyone should know first that this isn't kracked...its just the free trial.
,weebey7,2012-06-29T21:21Z,"CapeCodSmith if you don't know, then please refrain from commenting. The trial expires after 7 days, after which is it locked and you can't open it anymore. This is what the app says: 

""This fully-functional version of PinPoint
will run for a total of 7 days, after which, if you find it useful, you can buy your own copy from the Mac App Store.""

So yes, this is the trial version, but basically turned into a fully functional version that never expires."
,iPlunder,2012-06-30T00:10Z,"According to the About, It also isn't 3.7.2, it's 3.7."
,weebey7,2012-06-30T06:13Z,"Wow, more questionning the quality of my torrents... now I feel like I need to shut you up. 
Download the trial from MU: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/8111/pinpoint and see the version number, it's 3.7.2 and yet the ""about"" says 3.7.
I guess the developpers don't update the version number in the about section unless it's a major release, like so many developers do but what do I know.

By the way, if you don't like this torrent then leave it and stop being a douchebag. Never question my torrents until you've done your research."
