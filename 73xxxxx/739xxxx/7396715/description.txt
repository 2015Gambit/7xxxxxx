PinPoint helps you locate your pointer on the screen by displaying an animated graphic of your choice around it. It is great when you have many monitors or to work outside in the sun on your MacBook or for people with visual disabilities. The new version is only available through the Mac App Store, but for users of Mac OS X below 10.6.6, you can still get the older version from the www.macchampion.com web site. No upgrade path to move to 3.5 though because of completely different copy-protection systems and until there is an upgrade option on the MAS.
