,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-27T17:41Z,"To answer all your questions regarding his green skull downgrade. 

A piratebay mod took his skull away for 2 weeks from the 23/6/2012 (status will be assessed in 2 weeks from that date) for something that happened on the forums and also on tbp where another uploader stole extremezones upload from another site and quickly uploaded it to tbp as extremezone. EZ was not happy about this, there was also some petty issues on suprbay forums.

End of the day the mod went a bit overboard on his poweretrip and took away extremezones green skull. (temporarily). The mod was extremely unprofessional by announcing it on a torrent that ez was downgraded to pink.

He must just get his skull back, with an apology. 

Anyway long live extremezone!!!"
,sr2005,2012-06-27T17:42Z,The game works perfectly.Looks like a much better game than the Ghost recon future soldier.

,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-27T19:34Z,"Just a correction on my previous post. The other uploader didnt post it as extremezone, but stole a torrent extremezone was going to upload and dumped it on tbp just before extremezone did. 

Anyway I think it is all quite petty, extremezone seemed to be moaning like someone stole his candy. A bit weird to see a VIP moaning like that. But anyway just shows they are human. :-)"

,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-27T21:08Z,"2 types of leechers 

Good - Downloading torrent but also sharing (uploading) while downloading. Share ratio close to 1:1 or better.

Bad - Just download but basically never upload, basically they just hit and run. (download and emmediatly remove it from the torrent list once it is done) .Basically if you upload much less than you download."
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-27T21:21Z,"@virtualmatrix and arcs.

The releases you complaining about are not shit.

The origonal non cracked game has many problems that have pulled through to the cracked game. So hope you havent been blaming the uploaders.

Just wait for fixes and updates. Also read as many comments as possible to see how people got it working and what problems were fixed. Hope you remember who you downloaded it from then just check that torrent out again for comments.

Hope you get it working. For now just play spec ops. :-)"

actualy your full of shit.

go and read the topic in the forum.
and you will see why..

also this a web site and they can run it how they want.. TPB has rules.
There are no rules preventing people from uploading torrents based on source. Further more the so called thief is another top major uploader as well. and if both them uploads the same file what happens ? DUH
an error saying torrent is already registered.. I think most of the fanboys around here are just being dumb and suffering from gay love / fanboyism for extremezone.

I think its fishy I've seen dozens of extremezones torrents with a jpeg in them saying ""extremezone_is_a_piece_of_shit""
Now why on earth would that be ?

,Dave0590,2012-06-29T17:59Z,"@ez_fan

Ez the game files are written on a different language I believe is Russian, so your PC wont read the files located inside the game folder with notepad.

Here is what you going to do, is just about memory and patience.

Note:This solution works if you are able to hear and play the game while your screen is pitch black due to the wrong resolution saved on the game.

Instructions:

-Open the game, wait till you feel you are in the main screen, Press enter till you hear the games has started the campaign mode, which is the first option so you wont have to move the cursor at all do everything with arrows up and down and sides arrow also.

-Once you are inside the game, press start clicking your mouse till you hear the gun shoots, here is when the trick starts.

Fallow this, your screen will be black so copy this down or print it.

Note: Just use ARROWS ON THE KEYBOARD

-Press ESC for the inside game-play menu.

-Press down Key 2 times and press ENTER

-Now Press Down Key 2(without a game pad connected to your PC) or 3( with a game pad connected to your PC) times and press ENTER

-Now you are in Graphic menu: Press Down Key 2 Times and you are standing now on top of Window game MODE, Press Left key and Hit ESC 3 Times and Done.

The game is on Window Mode now so allows you to change screen resolution now to your pc native Resolution. Note: Screen resolution is done in main menu so you have to quit campaign.

Remember ARROW KEYS ONLY DONT TOUCH THE MOUSE AT ALL."

,shipz2640,2012-07-05T19:35Z,"@IAmTorrenter What, Diablo 3? The only reason people played it is because it was made by Blizzard.  Go look at how many people are playing it now. It has basically already fallen flat on its face not even 2 months after release. If you weren't referring to Diablo 3, then please excuse me for butting in.

While PC gaming may not be completely dead, it's certainly not thriving like it was in the previous two generations (from 95-05 -- the 5th and 6th generations of console gaming).

During the 5th generation of console gaming, PC gaming was still leaps and bounds ahead of consoles. Graphically and just technically they could do so much more because of the limitations of console hardware. In this generation we didn't even have software rendering, it was all done by hardware so it was extremely pixelated and slow. By this time, we had 3D accelerators for PC games such as Rendition and 3DFX (Glide). By the dawn of the 6th generation of consoles consoles finally started getting a taste of the same 3D acceleration that PC gamers already had for 4-5 years. Despite the fact that graphically consoles were starting to pull closer to PC's, they still weren't there yet. They just weren't the powerhouses that PC's were. Just look at 1999 -- PC's got Unreal Tournament and graphically it looked leaps and bounds ahead of Metal Gear Solid 2 which was released two full years later in 2001. Then came the 7th generation of consoles (Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360) and it was a whole different ball game. Consoles got HD graphics (aside from Wii), they got multi core processors, and what could be accomplished with the games was on par with PC's. Aside from community modding, but for gamers like myself, that's kind of null and void. I like playing my games how they were meant to be played. Your mileage may vary.

It has become such a hassle to keep your PC updated to play new release games that people just got sick of it and gave up on PC gaming and started using consoles as their primary platform of gaming, and just never looked back. You can buy a brand new video card and 6 months later it's obsolete. Same thing with a processor. That's just going too far. Or, you can spend $300 on an Xbox 360 or PS3 and not have to worry about upgrading any hardware until the next generation. It a much cheaper route, and this generation, games on consoles are no slouches in the graphics department, either.

However you want to look at it, PC gaming is a dying specimen that is becoming closer and closer to extinction thanks to evolving consoles over the past decade and a half or so.

More and more games are going to start to use the formula that Blizzard used for Diablo 3 simply because it worked and kept the pirates out, albeit it may be another 2-3 years before it's commonly used. Most games, by launch day there are cracks. To this day, there is still no crack for Diablo 3 because of the structure it uses. It operates more or less as a mini MMORPG where the server generates your loot and such. And well, with this community generated content also dies, which completely eviscerates the reason to even play games on a PC vs a console.

Basically what it boils down to is price, and console gaming is a whole lot more affordable than PC gaming. If you're going to make me use a modern video card to play a game, at least make the graphics look better than they did 5 years ago. Don't use up all those extra resources without giving me a massive visual boost. I'm looking at you, Max Payne 3."

focus on ur cash flow n not minding how companys run their business.
So what if pc gaming is dying?
Will you loose $100million from your pocket

I'm big fan of shooters, first person but 3.face too. I understand that those games simply have to be linear (mostly) but i don't like the concept-you get to some room, there are some bad guys there, u kill them, go to second room, bad guys there, u kill them...same thing over and over again. Ghost recon is much more interesting game. Spec ops is not ""bad"" game, graphics is nice, action too, but i simply don't like that all figts are 100% the same. One of the best shooters (if u can call it that way) is Stalker. U can do anything u want there. At the end, this game is OK, it's just my opinion-i don't like it."

,adrians09,2012-08-12T03:20Z,"@MonkFunk 

if you are using nvidia graphic cards
go to nvidia control panel and go to manage 3d settings and choose high-performance nvidia processor and it will fix black screen.

reply if it works"
,bud4hugs,2012-08-13T02:46Z,I got it running on my computer and it runs great. The only complaint I have is that the game is too short! Good upload thanks!
,0GamesLover0,2012-08-15T10:34Z,"Works Great!!!!!

if you got a black screen or unsupported resolution error just follow these steps...

1. Create a shortcut of game at desktop from the installation directory(Spec Ops The LineBinariesWin32SpecOpsTheLine.exe)

2. Then go to shortcut properties, in the target box write -windowed after ""Spec Ops The LineBinariesWin32SpecOpsTheLine.exe""

Example: ""D:Spec Ops The LineBinariesWin32SpecOpsTheLine.exe"" -windowed

3. click on apply and start the game now game will run in windowed mode.and you can fix black screen or resolution error just go to graphic settings and change the resultion...

Hope this will help......

Sorry for my poor english"

,azisco,2012-08-21T17:45Z,"Thanks. Great torrent that worked without any tweaking (apart from the crack of course).

@Anyone having doubts about playing this game: this is one of those games that occasionally comes about and proves that gameplay is only one aspect of a game, and possibly one of the less important ones. The gunplay in this game was, at its best, mildly interesting, and sometimes extremely frustrating, but I still had way too much fun with this game. The story, setpieces, and characters made it a contender for goty. It really makes me think back to Mafia II, which I also thought had a great narrative even if the gameplay had been done before."
,Sir_Ver,2012-08-22T01:18Z,"Works Great. Im at chapter 12 now and still dont encounter any technical problems.

Game = 8/10

Gameplay is generic shooting.
But the story, dialogues and characters are great."
,chikusho1213,2012-08-22T08:10Z,"I'm having trouble. After successfully installing and playing the game I ran into an error. ""Bad name index"" or something. Then I uninstalled the game.

Now however, I can't reinstall it. I get the message that the source file:

""/SRGame/CookedPCConsole/CharTextures.tfc"" 

is corrupted.
If I retry I get the same message, if I ignore, I get the same message from multiple other files.

Anyone got any ideas?"
,Skyretix,2012-08-24T07:29Z,"i would like to say the game itself is flawless the torrent however is complete shit my download speed kept going from 2.1mb/s to 300 kb/s  what should have took me 2 hours took me 6. 

Torrent: 6/10
Game:8/10
Replay value: very high."

,WeaverX,2012-09-06T23:48Z,"Awesome torrent as always.
But one thing I don't understand is that it is lagging on very low graphic just as much as on very high. Although I have an i7 processor and a Nvidia GeForce 630M. "
