only seems to happen for certain mkvs and mp4 conversions..

I dont notice these until I watch myself fully
Im not sure how to fix the issue but obviously its a bug in the coding or converters

I will experiment with other converters to see if they do the same

take it or leave it i guess"
[V],psspss,2012-06-27T10:42Z,an V2 convert is now added that seems to have fixed the blurs
[V],psspss,2012-06-27T10:48Z,"so grab that one over this one.. but ep24 I delete the mkv
before I released it had some minor blurs in the final segment
but it only blurred at bottom of screen in that one and
so I can live with that. affect the grass only"
