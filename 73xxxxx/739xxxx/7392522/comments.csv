And Wush thank you! You rock! "
,tisk,2012-06-28T00:59Z,Howard's interviews are great. Especially since some celebs actually say the truth from time to time and not just their usual PR bullshit. Funny though how agt manipulates the contestants/the show all the time and Howard is pussyfooting around saying the truth himself there....
,tisk,2012-06-28T01:11Z,Just listened to the AGT bit. Totally untrue. They initially let Tim Poe through. Then the scandal hit and they just edited it so it looked like he did not get selected. Kind of sad that Howard plays that game but I guess if your under contract you gotta do what you gotta do.
