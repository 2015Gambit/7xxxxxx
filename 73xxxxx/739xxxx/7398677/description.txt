Welcome to North Korea by Peter Tetteroo and Raymond Feddema:
This video called ΓÇ£Welcome to North KoreaΓÇ¥ by Peter Tetteroo and Raymond Feddema was the winner of the 2001 International Emmy award for Best Documentary.  Welcome to North Korea is a grotesquely surreal look at the all-too-real conditions in modern-day North Korea. Dutch filmmaker Peter Tetteroo and his associate Raymond Feddema spent a week in and around the North Korean capital of Pyongyang -- ample time to produce this outstanding film.
