Description:
Years of the Beast
2004  NR  98 Min.

Experience a society where money is worthless, food is scarce, your neighbor is your enemy and oppression reigns. Watch the ultimate forces of Satan and God prepare for the final battle. Feel the great and ultimate triumph of Christ's return and look up with encouragement, "for our redemption draweth nigh." Witness the years of tribulation and the great and ultimate triumph of Christ and His church.
