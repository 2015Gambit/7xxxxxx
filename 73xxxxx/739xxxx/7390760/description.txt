From Wikipedia:


Ray Lyell (born 1962, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and vocal coach.

Ray Lyell came to prominence with his band, The Storm, in the late 1980s. Ray Lyell and the Storm released their self-titled debut album in 1989. Its first single, Another Man's Gun, scored No. 6 on the AOR charts. The second single released by Lyell, Carry Me, was a Top 40 hit on the CHR charts and still gets airplay in Canada. Lyell was nominated for a Juno Award as Most Promising Male Vocalist in 1990. Shortly after the nomination, he began an international tour in Australia.

In 1992, Lyell sold the rights to the name "The Storm" after a legal conflict in the United States. Desert Winds, his next album, was released under his own name, even though the members of the band continued to tour and perform with him. Gypsy Wind was the album's first successful single. In 1994, Ray Lyell traveled to Nashville, TN to begin working on his third album, Working Man, with writers, Billy Crain and Todd Cerney. 1995 saw the release of Working Man. A decade later, Lyell released his fourth album, Running on Faith, with CMC Canada.
