I'm disappointed, but not surprised, that virtually no one helped me out with a vote from yesterday's post.  I've been getting tired of posting and it might be time to hang it up.  I think that after Friday's post, I'll take a few days off.  Maybe I'll be back after the 4th, maybe not.  I'll have to think about it.  You might want to start thinking about finding another source for Bubba.
