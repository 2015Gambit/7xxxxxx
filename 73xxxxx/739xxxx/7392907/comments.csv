,susheel02,2012-07-12T07:14Z,Can anyone vouch that the S.Nos are working? I tried another release and none worked.
,conngrand,2012-07-20T23:35Z,"Great, fully functioning on CS6"
,Man_over_Board,2012-08-09T06:10Z,"This is the exact same release as ""Red Giant Magic Bullet Suite 11.4 CS6 Compatible (Win 32-64 bit) [ChingLiu]"" and it doesn't work on all versions of CS6 that are out there. 
I tried. Multiple multiple times. On different machines."
