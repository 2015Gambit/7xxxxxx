,tacooos,2012-08-24T06:04Z,"First off, Thanks a ton for these uploads!

But for some reason once I had all 5 seasons completed and moved it all to my external, Season 1 episode 1 and season 5 episode 147 were broken files and wouldn't move or play...

Is there a way you could re-upload just these 2 episodes?"
,PRODTorrents,2012-08-27T00:38Z,@tacooos i suggest that you go back and download the missing episode and skip the rest
