,Dabeast42,2012-07-18T09:33Z,Works great has no problems just wish more people would seed it even though the size is small.
,Dabeast42,2012-07-18T09:36Z,I do have one question though how do I save ships? I understand if you can't but I think you can but I can't figure it out.
,Cyal8ter,2012-08-08T03:37Z,"Dabeast42, you can still save ships, using the same method as earlier versions of ksp. You click the save button.(Floppy disk icon)"
