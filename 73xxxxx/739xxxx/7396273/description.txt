Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Thursday, June 28 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the Supreme Court's Obamacare decision, its implications for the Constitution and the furtherance of tyranny in America. 

In addition to the Supreme Court's treason, Alex talks with Lee Hazeldean, a pseudonym for an undercover journalist who has blown the lid off the police state security arrangements put in place for the 2012 Olympics in London.
