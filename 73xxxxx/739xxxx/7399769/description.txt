The author suggests that the siege against Hinduism today is visible in four dimensions :

1. Religious: In the denigration of Hindu icons ;

2. Psychological - e.g. in the foisting of a fraudulent version of our history;

3. Physical - e.g. the Islamic terrorist-driven ethnic cleansing of Hindus in Kashmir and Bangladesh, and the money-induced conversion of Hindus to Christianity;

4. Cultural - e.g. through globalization of tastes, dress and interpersonal morality that are determined in the Anglo-saxon white Christian world ("The West").
