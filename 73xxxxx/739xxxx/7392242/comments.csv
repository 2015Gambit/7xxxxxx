Thanks for all your uploads.

Would you happen to have a .pdf of 'Political Order in Changing Societies' by Samuel Huntington in your archives? His central premise leaves open the problem of who is going to control the controllers but this 1968 polysci book is heavily cited by the political classes in China, et al, so it would be nice to have a cut/paste copy of it.
