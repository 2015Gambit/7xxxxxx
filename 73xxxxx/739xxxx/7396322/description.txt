Towards the end of colonial India, Shahid    
Khan loots the British trains, impersonating 
the legendary Sultana Daku. Now outcast,     
Shahid becomes a worker at Ramadhir Singh's  
colliery, only to spur a revenge battle that 
passes on to generations. At the turn of the 
decade, Shahid's son, the philandering Sardar
Khan vows to get his father's honor back,    
becoming the most feared man of Wasseypur.   
Staying true to its real life influences, the
film explores this revenge saga through the  
socio-political dynamic in erstwhile Bihar   
(North India), in the coal and scrap trade   
mafia of Wasseypur, through the imprudence of
a place obsessed with mainstream 'Bollywood'.
