,lizardleech01,2012-06-29T14:51Z,it actually anonymizes your utorrent for being tracked by others 
,TunaHead,2012-06-29T15:43Z,"Oh I see, is that the reason why you're not seeding your own upload?"
,lizardleech01,2012-06-30T10:48Z,"actually no, I usually go to meetings thats why i cant seed on my torrents so im sorry . . got a busy sched"
,kazzalou,2012-07-01T23:57Z,"No offence, and it's not like we don't appreciate the upload, but why upload at all if you can't find the time to seed it - completely pointless! Can anyone even comment is this is legitimate and working?"
,lizardleech01,2012-07-04T13:12Z,ahahah stupid me  . . .i didnt know how to seed it at first because i transfer it to other folders already  .. . but now  im seeding all i need to do is to put it on the downloads folder   :))
