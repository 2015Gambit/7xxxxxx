,Serenifly,2012-06-28T19:58Z,"I already have close to 5 TB in HD space. It may be relatively cheap, but there is no reason to waste it. I simply don't need porn on HD super quality.

Besides, the mp4 and wmv files are actually in the same resolution. Wmv just has a lower bitrate, but still looks very good"
,shallow2,2012-06-28T20:40Z,40 TB and counting :)
