The name Noah most likely stems from the ancient rain goddess Nuah. Creationist are illiterate idiots."

What you have just stated is a pure assumption that is not based on any scientific proof. Don't foolishly impose your views and beliefs on others, all the more offend them for theirs."
,Helmer2,2012-07-15T19:41Z,"To hyesagitta: Don´t sell folklore as truth. There are no scientific proofs whatsoever for the flood, Noah or Japeth. Only an uneducated fool would impose that kind of pseudo-science creationism crap on others. Many europeans also have neanderthals amongst their ancestors, not comic book characters like Noah who never existed in reality.

We know, yes we KNOW, that the babylonian flood story in Enuma Elish and the flood story of The Gilgamesh epic are far older than the the Old Testament saga on the same subject. As best the construction of the OT started some 700-600 years before modern time.

To correct someone who´s shamelessly imposing their foolish assumptions and proofless beliefs on others might be offensive, especially if you´re an illiterate idiot creationist who can´t accept scientific proof over insane folly like religious fairytales."
