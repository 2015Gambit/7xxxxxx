In his second book, Adam Carolla-author of New York Times bestseller In Fifty Years We''ll All Be Chicks and chart-topping podcaster-reveals all the stories behind how he came to be the angry middle-aged man he is today.

And if you do know what this is, then a description won't make a difference.

But if you are really retarded and needy and need to read a dumb fucking description then you would be better off buying the book if you need to read things. So go here and buy the book instead.

A description makes all the difference as to whether people download it.
Even people who may have heard the title before might have no idea what the storyline is.
There's a damn good reason why publishers print blurbs inside the covers: so shoppers will have some idea what the book is about before they buy it."

Thanks for the up."
