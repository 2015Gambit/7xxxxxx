This session was streamed live online on October 30, 2011 from the 7th Ward in New Orleans.

Portland-based indie folk band Blind Pilot made a special stop in the New Orleans' 7th Ward neighborhood to perform a live, intimate acoustic set with Liveset.

This exclusive set from the sun-drenched front room of their friend Uriah's house during a Sunday barbecue is an intimate portrait of the band at its best - relaxed, comfortable, and in perfect harmony. We hope you enjoy these supremely talented musicians as much as we did...
