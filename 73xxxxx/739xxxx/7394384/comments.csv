,tigerneko,2012-07-03T00:07Z,is this legit?
,jasomayo,2012-07-09T12:12Z,@tigerneko I doubt this is 14 gigs of virus
,FunnyCop,2012-07-14T15:40Z,If you actually knew how the program worked you would understand why it's 14.21 GBs.
,ojjorago,2012-07-24T23:28Z,Thanks! It's working perfectly. I was wondering if the vocaloids only come with their voice libraries though. For example I know that SeeU also comes with her demo songs and instrumentals. Is the extra stuff not included? I trid to open the bin files but I just get a disc corrupted message. 
,raki-chan,2012-07-25T20:06Z,"@ojjorago: The bin files are used for the exe installer, they cannot be opened or mounted!
The only extra here is Yuzuki Yukari exVOICE library!
Hope you have a nice time with Vocaloid 3! :D

BTW, Vocaloid 3.0.5.0 have been released!"
,alexvox,2012-07-27T19:29Z,"1. original torrent going from rutracker and it was updated to 3050, luo and gackpoid extend
2. Torrent have no viruses (at least original on rutracker)
3. software is not legit. V2-libs are separately repacked AE-libs (20% stronger compression), V3-libs and editor ""originally"" from me
4. My suppliers sent me only original installers without extra. SeeU-supplier said that he have no no extras because he bought ""usual"" library and extra comes with full editor+library
5. Programm itself is small but voice-libraries are large enough because of technology, nothing i can do with it, they are compressed as strong as possible
6. don't touch bin's, this is just strongly compressed-file. Launch exe-installer, it will decompress that file to destination folder"

,megurine,2012-09-04T23:34Z,Thank you! I'll definitely seed when this is done. One question - are you planning to support any future appends? Maybe the Megurine Luka append?
,Draya777,2012-09-12T23:23Z,"Sorry for being an idiot but I can't get it to work. I installed the V3 Setup, and then installed a voice bank. but when I open V3 it says
""Can not launch Vocaloid 3 editor. 
possible reasons are as follows:
1:No singer library has been installed. Please install a singer after purchasing it.
2:No essential files which is necessary to launch V3. The files might have been removed by mistake.""
What did I do? D:"
,raki-chan,2012-09-16T04:34Z,"alexvox is struggling with his sickness so there is no confirmation for future releases. The latest release, 3.0.5.0, with Galaco, Gakupo,... is available on RuTracker! God bless him! I hope he will be all right! Keep strong, Alex!"
