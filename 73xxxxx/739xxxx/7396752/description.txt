This comes from a $2.99 dvd with multi movies i watch this on my 19" screen with no problems but think anything bigger would be pushing it.

This movie i'm sure would never be made since the horse fight in it looks to be staged and real   bring your own wild horse to the fight

Very interesting actor who actually did rodeo, circus and ranch work with cattle and horses.

Hoot Gibson is not your average western hero. He looks more like the guy next door, only his face seems to be more made up, an inheritance from the silent films. He is a strong presence on the screen and you end up liking him. In this film he is a champion at the rodeos and takes the challenge to tame a wild Palomino horse. He also is accused of murder and has to prove his innocence. Stepin Fetchit plays a very funny guy, but his character reminds you too much of the indignity of slavery, so there is a certain sadness in it. If this film would have been made in the forties, it would have been considered a b western, but it was made in 1931 and it was a pioneer of a style.
