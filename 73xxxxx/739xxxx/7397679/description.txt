This is a beta video and nothing should be taken as final. Minor blurring to protect the people who were talking in chat. 


Here's a full length MWO match that's recorded from the view of a hunchback-4SP


In the video you get to see me fail to bind my weapon groups until I'm about to fire and miss several times while I get used to my recording resolution. 


Quality should be better than my last video
