Following the ending of Brotherhood, present-day protagonist Desmond Miles has fallen into a coma due to the combined stress of killing Lucy Stillman and being in the Animus for prolonged periods of time. While Shaun Hastings stays behind in Rome to attend Lucy's funeral, Rebecca Crane takes Desmond to New York and meets with his father, William Miles. In an effort to save Desmond's mind, the duo places him back in the Animus, though this time, in the machine's safe mode, known as the "Black Room."

Upon awakening on Animus Island, the original Animus testing program located within the Black Room, Desmond meets the consciousness of Subject Sixteen, who occupied Abstergo's Animus before him. Sixteen explains that Desmond's mind is broken, and the only way for him to repair it is by reliving his ancestors' stories until there is nothing left for them to show Desmond, at which point the Animus can separate Desmond from Ezio and Alta√Ør, and awaken Desmond from his coma.
