8 iPhone games:



captain america

cut the rope

gangstar 3

gta 3

iron man 2

marvel vs capcom 2

NOVA 3

spiderman total mayhem



I've played these on an iPhone 4, so not sure if they work on other idevices.

You will need to have a "jailbroken" device and have "AppSync" installed, or 

"Installous" which includes AppSync.


I use "iFunbox" from PC to install these to iphone.
