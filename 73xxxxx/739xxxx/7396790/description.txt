This solutions manual is for:

Applied Electromagnetism
Shen, Liang C.; Kong, Jin A.
2nd or 3rd Edition

I found this pdf online, paid $5 to download it from a website, and then decided that it should have been on the web for free, so here you go piratebay and save $5.  I added handy bookmarks to the pdf, used OCR Text Recognition, and optimized the pdf already so you don't have to.  This solutions manual will work for the 3rd edition of the book as well I think (so far I have only looked at the homework for the first chapter).  This solutions manual looks like it was scanned originally, and that the book writers wrote the whole thing by hand!  Kind of ridiculous if you ask me as their hand writing gets quite small and hard to read sometimes.  Oh well, get those A's, and learn about some Electromagnetism.  
God Bless.
