Sure, you can use VLC or Foobar to play them, but there is no way to upload them to a device or a service that only supports mp3 or FLAC. I've tried three different MPC converters and none work.

I'm far from an expert on anything, but did I read your note right--you converted these from FLAC to MPC on purpose? Why?

I appreciate the upload but it sucks that I'm only going to be able to listen to them on my home computer."

Waaah!!!"
