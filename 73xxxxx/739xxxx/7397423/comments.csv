1. Update graphics card to its latest driver (I did mine via driver reviver) 
2. Turned user account control to NEVER NOTIFY ME.
3. Turn off the anti-virus 
3. Install the game
4. Run the game in compatible mode of Windows 95 or Windows 98/ME and select the check box of administrator.

This steps work for me, if it does not work try this if you have AMD Catalyst installed.

1. Install steam 
2. Register or login in your steam account
3. Select steam at top bar menu
4. Update AMD Catalyst driver

This work also plus you can run the game without compatible mode. (Well it did for me) The only problem that I have know is every time I reboot my pc, I must install the AMD update every time to avoid the black screen and then disappear problem.

I will post again if I have a figure out how to avoid this problem. 

Hope this work for you as it work for me."

Working on very first installation. without any fuckin Crack or any other Shit. (like SC)
