I totally respect this dude (team?) and all his efforts (he surely is one of the most....productive uploaders) BUT the quality on a 720p or a 1080p movie can't just be a matter of pixels. In order to upload ""HD"" movies with 700 to 1500MB you have to sacrifice a LOT in bitrate and this ruins up the quality of A/V MOST of the times.

According to the number of seeders/leechers of YIFY's uploads the interest of this ""concept"" of HD movies is big but it messes up with the quality uploads closer to the source BD ripped (>4GB).

If you are watching movies in a medium sized lcd (40"") from a normal distance it makes no difference I guess, but when you are with a 60"" or a 100""++ projection screen everything is visible.

I just add -YIFY on my search but this doesn't help currently when I go through Top100 etc.

I know a lot will argue with my above statement but I am sure there are a lot who with me on this."
