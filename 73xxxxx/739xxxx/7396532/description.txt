This is a ripp from YouTube video by kidwar2205 he shot with his iPhone 4S. 
I ripped it because I'm afraid that the video could be deleted by the labels.

So here it is, it's not the RAW kidwar2205 uploaded to YouTube, but the encoded version by YouTube in H.264 1080p.

It's better than nothing and I want that everyone who participated to this gig can enjoy this video =)
