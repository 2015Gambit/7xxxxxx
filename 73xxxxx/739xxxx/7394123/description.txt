Total Immersion 4 Strokes Made EZ L5 Active Balance Looking DOWN

Total Immersion Swimming "Four Strokes Made Easy" contains many of the same drills as "Freestyle Made Easy" but presented in a different way with different swimmers.

This great stuff has been made EASIER to master by BREAKING IT DOWN INTO INDIVIDUAL LESSONS AND DRILLS!

A brilliant swimming technique that makes water your friend and maximizes efficiency, effectiveness, balance, symmetry, enjoyment, beauty.

Technique matters.

Watching an entire DVD in a linear fashion (or listening to one of Terry Laughlin's lectures or presentations) simply does not enable mastery of the lessons.

And the rate he dishes out his info on video, in lecture or in presentations is always too much too fast.

Because each lesson builds on the previous, it's ineffective and pointless to roll along watching the DVD.

Outside of the water, individual lessons on the iPad work great for very young swimmers, particularly with water babies.

TIF = Total Immersion Freestyle, L = lesson, D = drill, TIFSF = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle, TIFSFB = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle-Backstroke

Because both freestyle and backstroke are "Long Axis" (LA) strokes they are dealt with at the same time in the TIFSFB drills.

Color corrected, light levels sometimes adjusted, background noise removed when original was too extreme. Onscreen text has been added to the progressions because -- again -- too much too fast for us folks of only normal IQ.
