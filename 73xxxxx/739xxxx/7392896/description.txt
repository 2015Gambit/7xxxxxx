I need some Bubba Army help.  I need votes to help a fellow Bubba Army Brother earn eligibility to compete for a small business grant.  Link is below.  Please vote.  It only takes a minute.or two.  

I give you guys a couple of hours a week editing and posting for almost a year now, please give me a few minutes of your time to vote.  We need about 100 votes by Friday night.

Thanks,
TFR

Just because it says "no seeds," doesn't mean there aren't any.

My max upload is 50K/sec. Sorry. It's all I've got. Slow torrent is better than no torrent. Please seed. 

I can only seed each upload for a day or or two.  I have too many competing priorities.  Please keep seeding.
