magazine's mantra still remains. Alan Partridge, Kevin Keegan, Frank Skinner, Noel 
Gallagher, Britney Spears, Kelly Brook and Vikki Blows have all graced the cover 
over the years. So whether youΓÇÖre after beautiful women, cutting edge journalism, 
interviews with the best actions and musicians, or just irreverent silly-buggery,
loaded will never disappoint!
