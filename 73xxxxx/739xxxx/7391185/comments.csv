,RTT2,2012-07-03T10:19Z,"^ Someone needs to read this, then!  What everyone else calls 'the seasons' are not like climate change because they're not constant, they're caused mainly by the sun, and their timing is relatively constant...so far!

Thanks for the upload, great work! "

For the fact that everything and anything has an impact on climate such as, oceans, seas, volcanoes, flora, fauna, land fill, clearing and planting, waste, gassy animals, man's breath, radiation, reflection, absorption, solar, evaporation, conduction, physics, humidity, earthâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s rotation, sun, moon, stars, tectonic plates, tsunamiâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s, earthquakes, air movement, ice, snow, rainfall, water vapor, droughts, clouds, cars, trains, jets, boats, construction, agriculture, and on it goes. To think we (man) have all the answers, know how everything works, let alone be able to control the ""climate"" like a thermostat it is very misguided or possibly just plain arrogant."
,RTT2,2012-08-07T10:36Z,"Ah, the old 'false modesty' argument! Well, CO2 DOES cause global warming and we're pumping it out in increasing mass, regardless of your humility. And we don't control climate 'like a thermostat', because a thermostat keeps temperature constant - we are pushing it up. Understand?"
