,morty42,2012-07-01T21:10Z,is it possible to extract files from this for PC use?
,Stradisap,2012-07-02T14:26Z,"@morty42 Yes, you can extract those files to a form of esm and bsa, than extract those, convert nifs and ddx, and after a month of converting and hexing you will be able to play this on pc....ofcourse if you know basic hexing...but If you ask such questions I highly doubt it.

,SKYRIM2012,2012-07-02T20:39Z,so i can just put this on a flashdrive and install it on the hdd?? or how does dlc work?
,caxluis,2012-07-03T13:58Z,"This does NOT work on a ""normal"" console via USBXTAFGUI or other injection method. It will give you the ""damage/corrupted"" message. The file is good, but its only for jtag/RGH consoles. "
