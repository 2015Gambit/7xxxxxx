,3ogdy,2012-07-22T11:13Z,"The executable is infected with a Trojan virus that  effectively blocks your Internet access. After installing it , not only it doesn't work, but if you remove it, you lose your Internet access. Are you using Malwarebytes? Well done - don't try to update it, because it won't update due to this virus. You won't be able to access any webpage. I managed to remove the infection because I have an up-to-date antvirus that properly removed the infection. Make sure you keep your antivirus up-to-date to fuck those viruses!"

How do you know about this?"
,rhalls28,2012-08-01T04:24Z,"Don't work and don't uninstall.
I had to delete the program folder and then run ccleaner to solve the mess"
