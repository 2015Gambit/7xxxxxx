"Every time history repeats itself the price goes up."

Surviving Progress presents the story of human advancement as awe-inspiring and double-edged. It reveals the grave risk of running the 21st centuryΓÇÖs software ΓÇö our know-how ΓÇö on the ancient hardware of our primate brain which hasnΓÇÖt been upgraded in 50,000 years. With rich imagery and immersive soundtrack, filmmakers Mathieu Roy and Harold Crooks launch us on journey to contemplate our evolution from cave-dwellers to space explorers.

Ronald Wright, whose best-seller, ΓÇ£A Short History Of ProgressΓÇ¥ inspired this film, reveals how civilizations are repeatedly destroyed by ΓÇ£progress trapsΓÇ¥ ΓÇö alluring technologies serve immediate needs, but ransom the future. With intersecting stories from a Chinese car-driving club, a Wall Street insider who exposes an out-of-control, environmentally rapacious financial elite, and eco-cops defending a scorched Amazon, the film lays stark evidence before us. In the past, we could use up a regionΓÇÖs resources and move on. But if todayΓÇÖs global civilization collapses from over-consumption, thatΓÇÖs it. We have no back-up planet.

Surviving Progress brings us thinkers who have probed our primate past, our brains, and our societies. Some amplify WrightΓÇÖs urgent warning, while others have faith that the very progress which has put us in jeopardy is also the key to our salvation. Cosmologist Stephen Hawking looks to homes on other planets. Biologist Craig Venter, whose team decoded the human genome, designs synthetic organisms he hopes will create artificial food and fuel for all.

Distinguished Professor of Environment Vaclav Smil counters that five billion ΓÇ£have-notsΓÇ¥ aspire to our affluent lifestyle and, without limits on the energy and resource-consumption of the ΓÇ£havesΓÇ¥, we face certain catastrophe. Others ΓÇö including primatologist Jane Goodall, author Margaret Atwood, and activists from the Congo, Canada, and USA ΓÇö place their hope in our ingenuity and moral evolution.

Surviving Progress leaves us with a challenge: To prove that making apes smarter was not an evolutionary dead-end.
