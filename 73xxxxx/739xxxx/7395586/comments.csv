,JimmyCos,2012-06-28T18:53Z,What's the point of uploading a torrent if you're not going to seed it. Dumbass.
,Coolfrog,2012-06-28T19:07Z,"The patch work, but the game don't start any of the dlc's."
,EPDJ,2012-06-28T19:12Z,"It was up for 20minutes Jimmy... be more patient.

The torrent doesn't seem to work, I see the changes from the patch 1.05>1.06, but Islamic kingdoms are still unplayable.

Anyone able to get it going?"
,Shintien,2012-06-28T19:12Z,I put the file in the DLC folder but still can't play as Muslim
,EPDJ,2012-06-28T19:38Z,"Still no success... I put the dlc files in the dlc folder, merged the rar files into the main folders.

The launcher picks up that I have the DLC, but the game itself doesn't detect the DLC. So.. now im going to wait until a solution or new torrent shows up. Good luck?"
,Shintien,2012-06-28T19:42Z,Anyone else find that your other DLC stop working?
,Shintien,2012-06-28T20:03Z,"I finally got it working, I have to reinstall the whole game to get the DLC to work. "
,Arathian,2012-06-28T20:56Z,"do explain what you did in the re-install shinten?

also not working here by the way. I am on the verge of calling this a bad torrent unless shinten elaborates."
,krashan,2012-06-28T21:09Z,Guys you need clean install Skidrow relase CK2 --> install Skidrow update 2 + crack --> install update 1.6 --> copy all 9 relased dlc's to dlc folder .
,axote,2012-06-28T22:46Z,"I have problem with coats of arms DLC - I'm trying to change coats_of_arms.txt data, but it doesn't work... any suggestions? "
,Shintien,2012-06-28T23:46Z,"Install a new Crusader Kings 2 use the SKIDROW one

Install Crusader Kings II + 1.05b & Ruler Designer DLC otherwise the Select DLC section on the launcher won't appear 

Copy and paste Crusader Kings 2 Sword of Islam DLC file to the  DLC folder and install the 1.06 patch."
,Shintien,2012-06-28T23:49Z,You can tell if it work when nothing appear on the DLC window on the main menu of the game.
,GoodTunes,2012-06-28T23:56Z,"Get the DLC from the other torrent, works fine for me. Just took Sword of Islam from this one."
,srurki2,2012-06-29T00:23Z,"does anybody else has problem with country flags? everything else works all right, just flags are mixed up - english is at example red cross on black background instead of golden lions on red, etc. - and i actually care about such details. checksum also doesn't fit - it should be YYEV, and it is WXHQ or something like that"
,axote,2012-06-29T00:29Z,"Uhm, okay - I'm installed this: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7201402/Crusader_Kings_II___1.05b__amp_amp__Ruler_Designer_DLC and patch to 1.6 update + copy/paste Sword of Islam DLC. In DLC section launcher eveything is ok, but my game doesn't detect any DLC. What the heck? "
,GoodTunes,2012-06-29T00:44Z,"Nevermind, actually this doesn't work. Followed the above directions exactly."
,GoodTunes,2012-06-29T00:55Z," I'm calling this a bad torrent, I've tried every method said above, this shit don't work."

,jcrichton,2012-06-29T07:41Z,"after new clean install it works fine with SxSxl repack, thx"
,kurandus,2012-06-29T09:45Z,"i updated from sxsxl 1.05b after a few trys.  for me the patch exe made a crusader kings ii folder within my game folder, had to just copy all files into my game folder instead + copy DLC and worked a treat"
,mvrofiq,2012-06-29T10:25Z,"Mine is working Perfectly!

What did i do is just install the latest update, then install this DLC, and i think you also must copy All of the previous DLCs, so you must have from the 1st until 9th..

The download link of the DLCs can be found in this torrent.."
,axote,2012-06-29T17:15Z,"Still not working. Never mind, I will waiting for another release"
,jc_denton_,2012-06-29T18:12Z,"using SxSxl ver dlcs didnt work, with Skidrow ver, dlcs work but nation flags are fucked up. 

Solution: 1. install Skidrow ver, using krashan instructions, run the game, quit

2. go to c:UsersXDocumentsParadox InteractiveCrusader Kings II (win7) or c:Documents and SettingsXMy DocumentsParadox InteractiveCrusader Kings II (winxp) and backup dlc_signature file

3. uninstall game

4. install SxSxl version, update to 1.06, copy dlcs

5. copy dlc_signature back where it belongs

this is the only method i was able to make it work, tried everything else"
,krashan,2012-06-29T20:34Z,jc_denton thanks its workin!
,sergio_sos,2012-06-30T01:37Z,"I'm using SxSxl version and I cannot make it work.
Anyway I don't care about the new DLC for muslims, but I want to ask if anyone could fix the coat of arms issue. The main dinasties are ok, but the rest are just ugly and not the same as they used to be until this update.
Any help?"
,sergio_sos,2012-06-30T01:48Z,"@jc_denton_ I have a question for you: why do you the SxSxl and not the Skidrow one? 
I can't make this new update work fine with SxSxl.
Does Skidrow has a version that can update without crack like SxSxl ?"
,kentcave,2012-06-30T07:38Z,"I was satisfied with the SxSxl version, since it has all the previous dlc working.

I installed this version of 1.06 and SoI dlc, all 9 dlc. Sword of Islam worked in my SxSxl CK2, and I can play as Muslim rulers.

Then I need to check regarding cultures (D4NG, why cant a Saxon create Kingdom of Wales? Aint Celtic, but Saxon can create Kingdom of Ireland? sigh..I am ruler of 100% of Wales and yet cause of ""this"" problem, my Empire of Brittania have to wait a while longer, since I am 76% to the 80% requirements. Guess Scotland gonna suffer now, for my wrath) and found out that my Ruler Designer aint working anymore!

I tried reinstalling SxSxl version of CK2, and yes, found out the 01-06 DLC in SxSxl version has different size than this latest SoI version. Old 16mb compare to 13mb. The 05 Ruler Designer DLC has blank files inside the zip. Strange.

Tried unticking DLC, starting the game, quit. Retick and starting the game again. SoI works, yet Ruler Designer didnt. Guess patch 1.06 beats the SxSxl hack repack. 

Any modders or h4x0r5 here can solve this problem? Which tiny file we must modify? At most its just one hex-edit to activate dlc. Its prolly in the dlc_signature file.

Oh yeah, the charinfo console aint working anymore and many other events. If not because we are bored of the old western kingdoms..guess this Moslem patch aint worth the hassle to the large picture of enjoyment of this game anyway. Guess after we tried playing a Moslem ruler once and got all the excitements out of it. We better go back to SxSxl version. Sigh.."
,polomarko,2012-06-30T10:45Z,@krashan thanx it works with that way
,jc_denton_,2012-06-30T14:21Z,"Reason i use SxSxl ver, with Skidrow version i get totally screwed up national flags, and wrong checksum (WXHQ, like srurki2 mentioned)

With SxSxl, i got correct checksum and flags, but dlcs arent working.

-so i installed Skidrow ver, ran it once so it created the dlc_signature file, then i backuped that file, uninstalled Skidrow version

- installed SxSxl version, patched to 1.06, copied all 9 dlcs, and copied back dlc_signature file

-now i have correct checksum (YYEV), and dlcs are working."
,jc_denton_,2012-06-30T14:42Z,"@sergio_sos, to fix coat of arms try this:

find the coat_of_arms.txt in CKII interface folder
Scroll down to texture = {
file = ""gfx\coats_of_arms\dynasties.tga""
size = { x = 16 y = 4 }

and change the size to
size = { x = 51 y = 1 }

dunno if this will help, i noticed changed coat of arms several times with various patches."
,sergio_sos,2012-06-30T20:17Z,"@jc_denton_ thank you for your answer. 
Could you tell me the Skidrow version you installed to get the signatures? I tried your method but didn't work, maybe I have a different version.
Please paste the torrent link ;)

Oh, and I was using that fix you mentioned for the CoA, but now it only works for the main 51 dinasties, all the others are messed up (i.e. Boulogne)
Anyway it's no big deal, but I will give it a try again if you help me.
Thanx!"
,higuain7,2012-07-01T11:15Z,"DLC doesn't work for me :( I have a legit copy of the game. I got the Ruler Designer from TPB and that works fine, but the SoI doesn't work."
,kentcave,2012-07-01T11:52Z,"Actually, I just re-experimented. This game is easy to mod..not logical for it to be so troublesome to play it..right.

Here it is..all the sources are HERE in tpb, just search for Crusader Kings. Dont be lazy, at most it took few hours to get all the AVAILABLE files.

I installed the skidrow CK2 (choosing boobsman version) and then the update 1 and 2, heck even the available 1.03b patch from chef. Afterwards..its just the 1.06 patch and copied all 9 DLC to the folder.

VOILA..Ruler Designer works, playing as Islam ruler works and probably important to some..the COA is perfect! Yep, everything runs smoothly as it should, a Perfect game.

The catch is..turns out this is the problem..NEVER start the game using ck2game.exe but from the plain ck2.exe file. ck2game.exe connects you online and messed up your ooops ""pirated"" copy. lol

So..to repeat for the kiddies :
1. Install Skidrow CK2
2. Update 1
3. Update 2

4. Patch 1.03b (probably can skip this step, but whatta heck, such a small file =)

5. Patch 1.06
6. Copy all 9 DLC

7. Change deskstop/start menu icon to run from ck2.exe instead of ck2game.exe

VOILA..Crusader Kings II v.106 with Sword of Islam, Ruler Designer, Coat of Arms and all the rest of DLC works.

RIP SxSxl version..or at least till 1.07 version re-experiment. lol
(all saved files works..I can continue playing my Empire of Britannia game with corrected COA now =)

Enjoy..dont be lazy..with time and brain. Use it or lose it folks. @,-p.."
,kentcave,2012-07-01T11:56Z,"Yep..no need to backup signature files, edit flag sizes or installing different versions. Just do simple exe exchange load. 

Try it and enjoy. Oh, please share some new codes..I was too used with ""charinfo"" and miss it since it was gone. Now I only use event 6081 and cash/prestige/piety code. I think that 4 are enough. Is it? Plz do share. lol"
,jc_denton_,2012-07-01T13:56Z,"@sergio, I just used the Skidrow version with most seeders 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7022852/Crusader.Kings.II-SKIDROW

also dont forget to install Skidrow update 2 and crack.

@kentcave, can you tell us whats your checksum? Just tried with your method, got the same result, dlcs work fine, but checksum and nation flags are all wrong.

Here's example of England, CoA are ok but flags are screwed up http://i.imgur.com/0YO4M.jpg

should look like this http://i.imgur.com/gxB60.jpg"
,jc_denton_,2012-07-01T16:28Z,"""At most its just one hex-edit to activate dlc. Its prolly in the dlc_signature file.""

kentcave, you're right. This is how my dlc_signature file looks in hex

http://pastebin.com/D8E7CQKh

I just deleted the file made empty one, and copy pasted those values in hex editor and it works. File must be 33 bytes, last byte is empty.

I must say trying to make this thing work is damn fun."
,Vaisya,2012-07-02T03:28Z,is there any way to Crack it from mac /       !!!!!
,kentcave,2012-07-02T03:28Z,"Yeah, you are right. Yesterday I had checksum YYEV, now its QZWX. 
With SxSxl version we can click and browse the ingame store to check out the description and price points of DLC. 
With Skidrow version, clicking it didnt even work.

Regarding flags..I thought it was corrected. I discussed it at paradox forum and gamefaqs boards. 
When I was using version SxSxl patched till 1.05b, Harold's flag looks like the 3 lions you showed. 
After using SxSxl patched till 1.06 all the flags were wrong, even the Empire of Britannia had white background with a single red lion. And the flags of all the Kingdom of England monarchs were all strange..somehow.

With this current Skidrow version patched till 1.06, I got the Red Cross with Black background flag for England and the Empire of Britannia flag looks exactly like the one you had for England.
Damn garbled..all orange and yellow. But some told it was correct. Guess its the Imperial era flags..more suited for the Pride of Nations.
But I am satisfied with the current one. Looks prettier and somehow feels correct with the rest of the world in my game.

Oh well, we should enjoy the game for what it is now..rather than rack our brain further as fellow perfectionists should understand lol.
I once spent 3 days playing with charinfo, pollinate and move. Dang enjoyable, but in the end, just wasting valuable time. Should be experiencing the game, instead of playing God.
My current ruler has almost 600 vassals in his current main fief, leftovers courtiers from my days of eugenic breeding program. Used to be that none was left without a partner. Now I care less if twenty are left unmarried. lol

I am currently Emperor of Britannia, King of England, King of Ireland, King of Scotland and King of Jerusalem. Dang the celtic requirement, the Kingdom of Wales escaped my grasp. Guess I either have to modify the Wales txt file or just nominate a Breton in my dynasty as future liege, just for that. Grr.
Am in the process of acquiring the Empire of Scandinavia. Can we held two Emperor titles? Hmm..the beauty of this game. Game of Thrones indeed. lol

*Psst..I confirmed that the 1.03b is not needed. Just go from update 2 skidrow directly to patch 1.06 and copy all 9 DLC will works.
AND remember to manually replace the ""e_hre.txt"" in titles folder for the patch 1.06 as instructed in Paradox forum. An error for that in patch 1.06 for hre confirmed by Paradox.

Sigh..recalled the days of DOS games. This game is actually similiar to kingdom-strategy games of days gone past. The oldies goodies of KOEI masterpieces. I remembered how I hex-edited the heck out of RoTK and Bandit Kings till the game became my personal product. lol
King of Dragon Pass too. Played that one for a decade or more. Sigh..
Born on 75..been gaming since goody 80s on teenage days. The days of Apple II, DOS, the emergence of CD-ROM interactive-p0rn games @,-p.. and the current goodies spawn of modern era. 
Here is for immortality of creativity. Keep up the good work bros!"
,polomarko,2012-07-02T10:26Z,Finnaly got it working with the right checksum and everything else
,kentcave,2012-07-02T11:11Z,"Gratz..and please..pretty please, do share. Please? (with the cute puppy..ooops catty eyes of Puss-in-boots)

Actually, no point for chasing the correct checksum rite? When the next patch come out, we will be experimenting again. lol

Or do you guys need the correct checksum to play multiplayer? Since here we all are yaaar darn pirates..why dont we set up a FULL 32 players multi Game-of-Thrones game? Yeehaaar landlubbers. Timber ahooooy.

Anyone? Multi? Lets!!!"
,polomarko,2012-07-02T13:52Z,"First, clam down man
Second, you need to have the same checksum
Third, i used this torrent + this one    http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7201402/Crusader_Kings_II___1.05b__amp_amp__Ruler_Designer_DLC"
,axote,2012-07-02T19:27Z,by the way someone will upload any kind of mods? 
,lamarck,2012-07-02T21:41Z,"How do you get the DLCs to work? I've extracted them into the main CK2 and DLC folder, and when I click the game menu, it shows the DLCS on the list to choose from. But when I check them all and start the game it says I need Sword of Islam. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here, as i have all patches."
,kentcave,2012-07-03T03:07Z,"start the game using ck2.exe..NOT ck2game.exe

that way, you never have to see the menu appears..at all

no need to uncheck and recheck, no need to start game quit and restart..full instructions above..plenty of it

oh well, new repack by SxSxl available at tpb now anyway..with everything works out..only 300+ mb..try it @,-p.."
,Aodr,2012-07-03T06:58Z,"I've read most of the comments here. Sounds like Paradox has decided to do something about pirating.

My issue so far, is I have a legit copy. The bigger issue is my piece of shit ISP is a sibsidiar of AT&T, which means a 250 MB download limit per day.

I refuse to call it quits and purchase the DLC. There has to be a way to do this. So any ideas that don't involve downloading more torrents?"
,TheGenral,2012-07-04T18:24Z,"Look, the SxSxl version, all you have to do is patch it, i patched everything from 1.05b to f i think it is, like stated, the checksum is correct, the DLCs never have to be re added, just patch and keep the original dlcs with the 1.05b repack, i dont know why ppl have been reinstalling the dlc files seperately."
,kentcave,2012-07-05T03:18Z,"Nah..all this hassle..for nothing.

The latest up of SxSxl repack by Lingvort..works PERFECTLY.

No need to patch..no need to mod..just follow the instructions. Voila..SOI works, Ruler Designer works, COA and all the music works too. Only 399mb too. Salute! "

,kentcave,2012-07-30T04:57Z,"Just skip all these. The latest 399mb up by Lingvort simplify everything and works perfectly, if you do not worry much about the CoA. Just refrain from updating to 1.06b and CoA works too."
,Ceruse33,2012-08-20T00:52Z,"Hey,

I have a legit copy of the games but torrented copies of the DLC. I recently patched to the newest update and found that my DLC no longer worked. I am wondering if anyone can help me out with this... I am hoping it is something that I can just correct in the files themselves... Thanks!!!"
,Darkinsight,2012-08-20T07:06Z,"I run the game with ck2.exe instead of ck2game.exe. But all my dlcs are still not working!

Do I need to modify dlc_signature?"
,Elenbor,2012-08-24T16:10Z,"I am happy to report that I have finally figured out the flag issue. I have spent over a day on this and could not find an answer anywhere.

The flag .tga image files in Install-location/gfx/flags for the Timurids, Il-Khanate and Golden Horde are wrongly labelled as kingdoms instead of empires (change the k at the start of the image file name into an e).

After you have done this delete the UserName/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/gfx   folder so the flag files are loaded again.

With the .tga files wrongly labelled they weren't a part of the flag cache meaning the 3 empires took flags that weren't theirs and all the flags moved 3 places forward messing it all up.

I am not sure if this is in the original version or caused by any of the updates but I experimented and the error always happened to me."
