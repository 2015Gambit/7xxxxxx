AmericaΓÇÖs best-selling deck bookΓÇöbetter than ever

 

In this revised and expanded fourth edition of the all-time bestselling book on decks, homeowners learn, in unsurpassed detail, the process of designing, building, and maintaining a deck. Not only are all the classic deck-building techniques included, but the book also shows how to incorporate the latest contemporary options, such as how to work with eco-friendly wood and reclaimed plastic. Hiring a contractor to build a deck easily adds up to tens of thousands of dollars, but with the help of this book, readers can design and build the deck they want without the high price.

 

For homeowners who already have a deck but are in the market to update or maintain that deck, The Complete Guide to Decks features important projects for repairs, upgrades, and major additions, such as adding full electrical service, lighting, and kitchen appliances. From design to construction, and tools, material, and planning, this is the only book consumers need to build the deck of their dreams.
