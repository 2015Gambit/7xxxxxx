YRM  - Donald Lawrence
Worship - Shekinah Glory Ministry
Beginnings - Marvin Sapp
Sound of Victory - Maurette Brown Clark"
[V],TorrentTracts,2012-07-02T00:51Z,"Littleredcorvet - interesting choices.  That Marvin Sapp ""Beginnings"" release has evaded me since it was released back in 2011.  I've yet to find it, but I know of the release well.  Donald Lawrence's ""Your Righteous Mind - YRM"", I can and will torrent for you momentarily.  As for Shekinah Glory Ministry, I've only got their 2007's release of ""Jesus"", and their 2009 ""Best Of.""  Maurette Brown Clark is another one I won't have for ya."
