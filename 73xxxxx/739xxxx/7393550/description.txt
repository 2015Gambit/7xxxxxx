The film is all about two young couples who  
are exactly opposite in their nature. They   
want to spend a happy life together with     
their loved ones upon their dreams. There    
happens a road mishap when two buses collide 
with other at a highway near suryapeta       
village. That incident changes the course    
of lives of the young couples. The movie then
slowly goes into the flashback episodes      
and the love story between the couples is    
showcased briefly
