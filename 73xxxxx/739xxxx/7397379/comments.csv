,The__dude21,2012-06-30T13:09Z,will this play on a ps3 ?
,piizda,2012-06-30T15:13Z,"A?
V?"
,Powerslave0,2012-06-30T16:44Z,"Will is play on PS3?  As it is, no, you need MKV2VOB to covert it.  If it has Cinavia, and you do not have a DTS receiver and have to use AC3 Audio, then NO it still won't play.  As of now, the PS3 can't detect Cinavia in a DTS stream, but they're working on it...  Mine is, and will stay in CFW 3.55, so I won't get any update if that were to change.

Anything made by SONY, will have Cinavia. There used to be a Wiki with a list of movies that have it, but someone removed all that."
,andrewjho,2012-06-30T19:59Z,"@The__dude21
Or you can also just get the latest version of PS3 Media Server if you have your PS3 hooked up to your home network, and you can stream this from your computer to your PS3."

Also, Its embedded in the audio so streaming of any kind wont work."
,schizom,2012-07-01T18:28Z,quality is good. the movie itself is a real waste of harddrive space though.
,DABIZOMB,2012-07-01T19:11Z,THX BOZX YOU HAVE THE BEST TORRENT'S!!!!
,splasha,2012-07-02T00:23Z,nice quality but the movie is so bad.
,HalcyonJedi,2012-07-02T04:15Z,"Fantastic quality - A/V is 10/10, but the movie is in my opinion about a 6. "
,octap,2012-07-02T21:22Z,"this is a bad/cheap action movie....
(many thanks to the uploader and seeders)"
,canopener,2012-07-03T14:27Z,"Thanks for the up!

M: 6.5 (really bad CGI)

Wait until you see the really, really bad CGI ""chase scene""."
,awesomewelles,2012-07-05T10:16Z,possibly the biggest pile of shit ive ever watched. Even Guy Pearce couldnt be fucked acting his way thru this one.
,pp1dg,2012-07-06T18:24Z,"What's wrong with this torrent?

and Seders, and only downloading
at 50 kbps? I have 5.0 MB of bandwidth."

,Crolic,2012-08-08T23:26Z,The sound is also fucked for me... everything is fine except the base. Very annoying
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T10:49Z,"This movie was more entertaining than Hunger Games, Battleship, and other steaming piles of Turds out there. Even though it was a cookie cutter weekend chill out flick, I liked it more than other crap that's out now. Thanks for the up."
,ChillyCrossFoot,2012-08-09T10:50Z,"And yes, I agree with some posters, it SUCKED, but compared to the other horrendous Hollywood injustices, this was better by comparison. "
