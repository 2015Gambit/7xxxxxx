,markgri,2012-06-29T10:19Z,Where is the avi version of this? Episode 2 is already up. . . 
,machspee,2012-06-30T07:36Z,"why the hell do you need crappy avi if you get superior mp4 quality?

You can always download a video converter software from TPB if you REALLY need avi.. It takes about 10 minutes for conversion...

so stop with these stupid requests.."
