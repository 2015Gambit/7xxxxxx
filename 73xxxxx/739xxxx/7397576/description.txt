The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities
The Tower, an observational documentary which has been filmed over three years, charts the urban regeneration of the notoriously troubled Pepys Estate in South London. A property developer is turning a dilapidated former council high-rise into luxury riverside apartments and another is being demolished and rebuilt for public sector workers. The changes are happening under the gaze of those still living in the original local authority houses next door. 

The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities won the best factual series BAFTA award in 2008.

The Tower is complete and the first of the new tenants move in, including gay couple David and Paul. While Saima and Usman get used to married life, some harsh realities begin to come home to them. Elsewhere, retired gangster Harry Hayward feels overwhelmed by the changes, and Lol Gilbert's drug use continues as his friend Nicky plans his escape.
