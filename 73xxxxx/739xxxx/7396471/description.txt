On Adam's 6-26-2012 show, he discussed the animatic he made to pitch his TV 

show.  He posted a Youtube of it.  I didn't expect the Youtube to survive so I 

pulled it down.  This torrent has the animatic in MP4 and AVI formats as well 

as the show wherein Adam discussed it.  It is funnier than much of the crap on 

TV today.
