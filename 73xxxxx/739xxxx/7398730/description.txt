Plot: Set in Swansea in the summer of 1976 –the hottest summer the UK has ever seen, an idealistic drama teacher single-handedly attempts to put the show on and knock these teenagers into shape, a hard enough task made harder by the relentless sunshine and enticing beaches of Swansea. What the film tries to capture is that musical magic created when kids come together and perform with their hearts and souls. The story is essentially a simple one about a school show, and the plot centres around a burnt down school hall, an ill judged affair and the everyday trials and tribulations of teenage life.
