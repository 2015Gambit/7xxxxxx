,judascain,2012-07-17T10:18Z,2.1/10 rating on imbd lol
,Rush,2012-07-23T00:34Z,"LMAO, one user ""loves"" the movie one user say's ""terrible""

This is why rating movies on here is a complete waste of time. One fucking click away is IMDB, hundreds of votes, averaged out to a reliable number.

a/9
v/9
m/2.1 (IMDB)"
,tiz2,2012-07-24T16:23Z,"@ Rush: 113 ppl voted on IMDB, 2281 are currently seeding this. I don't like the expression, but ""you do the math"". This movie is a lot better than it's rating reflects, but the genre is misleading, they should have made it drama-comedy. This story is too serious if you just want funny, and it's actually a ""Mockumentary"". "
