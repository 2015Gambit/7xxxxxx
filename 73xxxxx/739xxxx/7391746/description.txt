The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities
The Tower, an observational documentary which has been filmed over three years, charts the urban regeneration of the notoriously troubled Pepys Estate in South London. 
The experiences and opinions of those still living on the estate, and those moving into the chic new homes capture a key period of transition in contemporary London. The glittering tower of Canary Wharf looms large over the riverside location and the economic ripples it creates, along with a booming economy, have brought an affluent generation to the neighbourhood in search of views of the Thames and an easy commute to the office. Property prices are simply too high for those who are from the area to buy a house there. 
The series features poignant portrayals of residents including Leol, a heroin addict.
The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities won the best factual series BAFTA award in 2008.
