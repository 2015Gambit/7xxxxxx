NOTES..........: The Gold Rush was released in 1925. Chaplin reissued it with 
                 synchronized music and narration in 1942. He removed all the 
                 titles, rearranged some sequences and discarded several scenes. 
                 The original 1925 version disappeared. But a 35mm copy had been
                 made by a private collector. By using this together with the
                 1942 reissue, and three fragments preserved by the National 
                 Film and Television Archive, it has been possible to reconstruct 
                 the film almost exactly as Chaplin first released it. The picture
                 quality varies considerably between the different sources. The 
                 subtitles have been remade with the original wording. This is an
                 opportunity to see Chaplin's masterpiece close to its original 
                 form, but it should still be regarded as 'work in progress'.
