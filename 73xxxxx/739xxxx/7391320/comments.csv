,Browdj,2012-07-04T11:42Z,"I got one to work but it looks a lot like a key file I already used. The first five didnt work. Anyways, to use this for you noobs:

1.) Turn off your interwebz
2.) Delete currently activated key (click red X)
3.) Put in a dummy code like 11111-11111-11111-1111X if the trial license option doesn't appear
4.) Click to make sure you are entering a ""Trial License""
5.) Browse for dee files dat you just unzipped and click open

Happy Pirating :)
