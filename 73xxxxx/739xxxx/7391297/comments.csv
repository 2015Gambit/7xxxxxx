,kicsikekincse,2012-08-06T18:20Z,"
This is in Russian.
Damn shame.

Otherwise works, so if your Russian sucks this game sucks to you.  
Any chance of a german or english version?"
,kicsikekincse,2012-08-06T19:14Z,"OK
Sorry!
 It does have an English version as written above.
But there is no saving function.
You have to wait for checkpoint save.
Am I right this time?"
