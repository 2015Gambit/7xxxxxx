Joan Rivers is a groundbreaking, award-winning, internationally renowned entertainment goddess. SheΓÇÖs also opinionatedΓÇöespecially when it comes to people she hates. Like people who think giving birth is a unique achievement. Or well-adjusted, a.k.a. boring, ex-child stars who donΓÇÖt even have a decent addiction.

With all of her diverse experiences, it stands to reason that Joan has seen, done, said, and heard a lot of hateful things. Thank god, she took notes.
 
HereΓÇöuncensored and totally uninhibitedΓÇöshe give the best of her worst to First Ladies, closet cases, hypocrites, Hollywood, feminists, and overrated historical figures. And even when letting herself have it, Joan doesnΓÇÖt hold back in this honest, unabashedly hilarious love letter to the hater in all of us. '
