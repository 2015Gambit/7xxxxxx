Swimming - Fingertip Wall Drill (by Marc Evans, NOT Total Immersion but TOTALLY COMPATIBLE!)

OK, this is NOT TI but it's fits in well and it's a clever drill and Evans is a smart coach too and WE are using the drill to train our little swimmers so ...

The full version is on YouTube but dear Mr Evans has the same bug as Terry Laughlin -- too much too fast.

This is only the drill and we corrected the color and light levels.
