Please comment on my comment please !
Love all people that upload great stuff and hate those who upload trojans, virus, malware and other bad stuff. Sad that Piratebay canÂ´t or will not stopped bad stuff !

Long live Piratebay and other sites like that ! :-)"

,psycotroop,2012-08-05T12:20Z,I can confirm that this does have some sort of trojan. Tried to run the key gen and it gives you the blue screen of death and your PC shuts down... stir clear
