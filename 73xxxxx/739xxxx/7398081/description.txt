  Onwards to the Wall, the EP A Place to Bury Strangers issued between this album and Exploding Head, suggested the band was headed in a harder-edged, more streamlined direction that felt all the more radical given their previous full-length's wind tunnel dream pop. However, it isn't that easy to sum up where the band is going on Worship, and that's a big part of what makes these some of their finest and most interesting songs. A Place to Bury Strangers delivers on Onwards to the Wall's retro-futuristic grind -- which was as comfortable with Suicide's electro-punk as it was with My Bloody Valentine's wide guitar swaths -- particularly on "You Are the One," which builds from sleek beats into off-the-rails guitar explosions as it conflates love with collisions.  In some ways, it's hard to believe that this is only A Place to Bury Strangers' third album; they've grown so sophisticated -- while remaining true to their basic sound -- that it seems like it should have taken them longer to get where they are on Worship, an album that's just as vital as it is accomplished.
