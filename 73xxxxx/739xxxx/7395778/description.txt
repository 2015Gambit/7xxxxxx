Widowed Mrs. Saraswati Batra has brought up      
three sons with a lot of care and love.          
Her eldest son Om is very honest and diligent;   
her two other sons Jai and Jagdish also live     
in the same house. Om looks after the family,    
and also looks after the business and the estate.
Jai's interest is fast cars, and to the much     
disappointment of his family, decides to re-     
locate the United States of America, and gets    
married to a rich and snobish girl, Neetu.       
Her mother strongly disapproves of Jai, and      
vehemently, though in vain, opposes the          
marriage. To make matters worse, Jai gets a      
job in the U.S. in a vehicle junkyard, much to   
the horror of his wife and his family. Jai must  
use this junkyard so that he can make the fastest
car in the world........
