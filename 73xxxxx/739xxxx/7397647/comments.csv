,KillZone380,2012-06-29T20:32Z,"Yes, by and large all movies released by Sony Pictures have contained Cinavia, and probably will continue to do so in the future. There ARE a couple of confirmed workaround though, as long as you have either a blu-ray writer or an external audio receiver. You could also just watch them on your PC, or stream/play them through a device that does not support cinavia."
