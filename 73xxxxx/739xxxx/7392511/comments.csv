Jailbreak your iPhone first by using Absinthe, google it. 
Once it's done jailbraking, download AppSync 5.+ via Cydia.
Now go to google and type ""IFunBox"" once it's installed, click on the box ""install cracked Apps""
this program is 100% virus free and will work any time. 
but make sure to install Appsync first once your device is jailbroken"
