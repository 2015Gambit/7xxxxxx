PLOT 
****


Prompted by a midnight call from Andrew, Mitch looks out the window to see a black ops team headed for his house. Can he get his family out in time? Flash back a few weeks: Tammy looks to infiltrate Noble Insurance, Abby visits Martin Moxon's widow, and a battle-hardened army sergeant wants Ray's help find his son's killer. There's no body, no blood, but the father is certain it's murder. The investigation takes Ray and Mitch deep into post-9/11 government secrecy and war powers.
