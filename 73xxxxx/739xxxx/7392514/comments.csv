Also found some old DVD with a bunch of performances from Kansai region bands on it, Midori included, so I'll probably order that next week. And if anyone's interested I preorded Mariko's new album (limited edition first press, comes with a DVD), so that'll most likely be up as well.
And sorry if the upload is slow, my internet has been shitty these past few weeks."
