American Weed
All-new series American Weed finds Colorado medical marijuana businesses under scrutiny and facing mounting pressures from local residents. Medical cannabis entrepreneur and Fort Collins dispensary owner Josh Stanley works aggressively to counter such pressure with radio ads and fund-raisers. As the oldest of 11 kids, Josh relies heavily on several of his brothers to work at the grove and keep his business supplied in medical marijuana. Meanwhile, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt and fellow officers on the North Metro Task Force continue to find illegal grows by residents claiming to be growing medical marijuana. Is the pendulum swinging back to curb the ten-year proliferation of medical marijuana in Colorado?

Episode 3: War over Weed
Ray Martinez continues to rally his troops against marijuana shops, making Josh Stanley realize he has to fight back to protect his business, employees and patients, who he believes will be at risk if his dispensary is shut down. Dawn and John Clifford continue work as usual, growing, tending and trimming their marijuana plants to ensure they get a good harvest. And using a K-9, Sgt. Jim Gerhardt discovers weed plants in an office building that turns out to have 700 marijuana plants.
