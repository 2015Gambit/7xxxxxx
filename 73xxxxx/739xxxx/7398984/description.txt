Description:
Bananas At Any Cost:
Juan Accidentes Dominguez is on his biggest case ever. On behalf of twelve Nicaraguan banana workers he is tackling Dole Food in a ground-breaking legal battle for their use of a banned pesticide that was known by the company to cause sterility. ΓÇ£This film just demonstrates how multi-national organisations go about abusing their positions within society in the quest for money. Sadly the chemicals banned in the developed world are still sold for use in developing countries and it is the poorer people within these countries that suffer. Bananas is a must see and we need more DVD's like this that bring the truth to the world about how their food is really produced, well done film makers.ΓÇ¥

Narrated by the famous Christian Bible Comic Writer, http://www.spirituallysmart.com/alberto.html
One of the most important books I ever read. This book woke me up to who the "Great whore" of Revelation 17, 18 is. Spread this around.  Filled with interesting historical facts and commentary from the Churches beginning up to present day.  Learn the Truth, where we are heading and what we should be doing...
