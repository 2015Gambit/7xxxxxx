I would really appreciate anyones help because I am really stuck. Thanks"

,CrematoryKid,2012-07-02T15:29Z,"@boobsman  or anyone knows the answer plz
how to burn this game after download it to work on my Xbox????
i hope for some help plzzzzzz"
[V],boobsman,2012-07-02T18:35Z,"@ Browny1309 there are only 2 ways to play games from a hard drive, either have a jtagged / RGH modded console so that you can play games from the xbox360's own hard drive or buy the x360 key and play the game iso's i upload from an external hard drive. Jtag or RGH modded consoles are not xbox live safe so you will not be able to play online, however with the x360 key you can use abgx360 to patch for online play, still not 100% safe but no worse than burning games to disc.

@ CrematoryKid you need a modifed console in order to plat this from disc, your drive needs to be flashed in order to play copied games."
,CrematoryKid,2012-07-02T20:44Z,"@boobsman  already flashed   i jus need to know the steps after downloasdin this on my pc
what shuld i do to burn it into xbox dvd?
what do i need more than dvd writer??"
[V],boobsman,2012-07-03T00:06Z,"@ CrematoryKid you should have LT3.0 flashed or at least LT2.0 then patch the iso with abgx360, for xgd3 games this also adds topology however if your on LT2.0 then for those you should use the downgrader. This though is xgd2 so you just patch then burn to a good quality dual layer dvd using imgburn. Check out youtube or google for video tutorials for everything you need to know :)"
,CrematoryKid,2012-07-03T00:30Z,"@boobsman thanx for reply
it s LT3.0 flashed
so u mean about (the patching thing)the last update for the game??
so if it s  . i shuldnt update it through my console as usuall?is that ganna make a prob???"
[V],boobsman,2012-07-03T17:58Z,"@ CrematoryKid no problems with this, just run through abgx360 to patch then burn to a dual layer :)"
,elzincho,2012-07-03T22:32Z,dude you need to start saying in the info its lt 3.0 compadable for us ppl who are up to date. it just helps me out anyway
,elzincho,2012-07-03T22:34Z,oh yea when its done ill seed
[V],boobsman,2012-07-03T23:41Z,"@ elzincho why? All XGD2 games are compatible with LT3.0 as are all XGD3 games so why say if there compatible or not as all will be. I already tell you what firmware is needed at the top of each description, for all new XGD2 games you need LT1.9 or above, for XGD3 you need at least LT2.0 then use the downgrader or LT3.0 n patch topology, LT3.0 will play all games!"

 Verification failed"
,nightengale,2012-07-04T04:17Z,"wonderful job you're doing here boobsman, but as of recently you can no longer downgrade from 3.0 to 2.0. M$ has patched that exploit with some recent updates"
,nightengale,2012-07-04T04:19Z,Therefore anyone who has been needing to do this is definitely going to HAVE to Upgrade to LT 3.0 and newer dash
[V],boobsman,2012-07-04T16:52Z,"@ nightengale everyone should be on LT3.0 now anyway, those who are still trying to downdgrade should really consider updating firmware before they're left behind :)"
,ombut,2012-07-16T22:19Z,Is it a SAFE UPDATE? Or do i need to flash my xbox aggain?? PLZZZ ANSWER!
