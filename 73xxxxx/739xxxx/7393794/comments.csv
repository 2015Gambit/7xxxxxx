,vctrt,2012-06-28T04:13Z,Thank you!! Been waiting for this
,jezdog,2012-06-28T04:18Z,"PLEASE STOP SPOILING IT WITH THE LABELS.

Make it one file or split it into un-named files... you have just ruined the first 90 minutes by labeling it like you have. "
,oodataustin,2012-06-28T04:44Z,"Oh I do love it when you can see what happened in the match just by looking at the filenames as they download.

Thanks a bunch! Great way to spoil the result, d-bags."
,wussboy,2012-06-28T05:17Z,"I concur that it's frustrating to have the files be spoilers, but I knew the result already and am happy for this torrent for archival purposes. Thanks."
,2HardRain,2012-06-28T07:22Z,"I also watched it live, but support the others, please don't split the files. Make it just one or two at the most."
,rica5mend,2012-06-28T07:28Z,WHY NO FUCKING AUDIO!!!!!???????
,rica5mend,2012-06-28T07:29Z,THANKS FOR WASTING MY BANDWIDTH YOU PIECE OF SHIT
,rica5mend,2012-06-28T09:47Z,"forget what i said, i found a solution. sorry"
,vctrt,2012-06-28T10:07Z,"Seriously? What spoilers are you talking about? There are 3 mp4 files: First half, second half, and extra time. Makes perfect sense to split the files this way....
Thank you Dibya for your efforts and keep up the good job!"
,oodataustin,2012-06-28T13:11Z,"If it goes to extra time, then it's going to be a draw after 90 minutes.

Hello? McFly?"
,StarSpirit,2012-06-29T00:46Z,Christ the lot of you really are a bunch of whiney cunts! How about actually thanking him/her for providing a download. Assholes.
,vctrt,2012-06-29T03:32Z,"So all you whiners were hiding in a bunker without any contact with the world just waiting for this torrent so you can watch the game. But then when you saw there is extra time, it was obvious the score was only 0:0 after the second half because any other score and the game wouldn't go to extra time....
What a bunch of ungrateful losers..."
,vctrt,2012-06-29T03:35Z,another spoiler for you. Live with it or go someplace else
,fall1en,2012-06-29T11:13Z,"HaHa @ the babies complaining LMAO!
