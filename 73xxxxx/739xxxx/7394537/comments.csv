[V],wushdishmeen,2012-07-08T17:52Z,"VHS rip???  how is that possible with a bluray rip at 4400k bitrate and over 2GB an episode?

DLing now and will report genuine results after just in case this guy is just a jealous competitor or something"
,ioulianos,2012-07-11T19:31Z,Is this better that WEB-DL ?
,pilot12ab,2012-07-15T20:52Z,"What fingerpulla wrote is TOTALLY wrong!!!

I've downloaded the first 2 episodes and will continu for the whole season:

720p of HIGH video and audio quality and synch english subs.

You can go on people, this torrent if fucking great. Thanks to the uploader. I will seed it 2 times the size minimum.

fingerpulla is just a jealous competitor.

The only problem with this torrent is that, I don't know why, the download speed is awfully slow. Do not expect more than 100-200kB/s at best. I'm currently stuck at 50kB/s. :( Please people, open your upload slot at full speed. There are 280 seeders, 530 peers and the speed is slooooowwww!"
