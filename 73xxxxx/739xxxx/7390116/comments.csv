,youreamoron,2012-06-29T12:54Z,"(a). Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps: 
Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow. 
Type the following command, and then press ENTER: 

sfc /scannow

The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions. 



路         More Infoermation about SFC scan can be found in this document:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833





(b). Perform a check disk:



Use the steps below:
Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer. 
Right-click the drive that you want to check, and then click Properties. 
Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check now. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. 

To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system errors. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.

To perform a thorough check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete. 

To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.
Click Start. 



Depending on the size of your drive, this might take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks while it is checking for errors.

If still the error persists please provide us the error log:

Type eventvwr.msc /s in the address bar.

 List any events that are listed as ""Error"" in the main window when you go to ""Windows Logs"" and ""Application."" There are often a lot of them. Send us whichever ones you see listed for the last couple days. (Please also do for the logs in ""System""). When you do, provide us the name of the ""Source"" and whatever is listed in the description box below the list of logs when you click on one. "
