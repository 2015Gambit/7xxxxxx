,arnoldlayne3,2012-08-23T04:51Z,add more please!!!!!  More Restaurant Impossible..and Chopped if you have them!
,BrainDrain908,2012-09-19T23:39Z,Thanks for the restaurant impossible!  I was wondering if your could find any of the Dinner Impossible shows.  I have been searching with no luck.  Cheers!
,slasherman,2012-09-20T17:30Z,"hi, I have many Dinner Impossible episodes but nearly no full season. So i'm searching to complete the 8 seasons. By the way season 5 is without Robert Irvine, so I will not search for them. I tried to see a episode from season 5 with Michael Symon and it was not the same. "
