This is the Japanese edition of Yes' Fly From Here album that contains the 'full length version' edition of "Hour of Need", uploded it in case anyone still wanted it if they didn't order the import yet. Also included is the artwork and ooklet scans, the Artwork foler for them all is pretty big (127 MB) so sorry about that, bu it's all high quality :3.

All tracks have a bitrate of 320.

One other note, will someone please explain why so many people hate this album just because Jon Anersn isn't on it? I mean, this album is petty good, David's vocals are amazing, even Anderson said so. Same goes for the 'Drama' album, it's highly underrated, and personally, I thin t's better then 'Tormato' and 'Big Generator' albums. Well, enough ranting :P
