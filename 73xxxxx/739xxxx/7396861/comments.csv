,panamalynn,2012-06-29T04:09Z,I just posted on the last episode.  Thank you so much.  I know how much work this is for you.  You are very much appreciated by me here in Central America.  If it were not for people like you I would have absolutely no connection with North American television.  I don't know who you are or where you are but you have my undying gratitude.  :)
,panamalynn,2012-06-29T04:26Z,Please have consideration and please seed this.
,panamalynn,2012-06-29T07:14Z,No one is seeding!!!!!!!!!  Please don't be rude and hit and run.  This is pretty sad for such a great community here.   
[T],duranie,2012-06-29T13:09Z,"As I type this, there are currently 222 seeders. So it's definitely being seeded. Utorrent shows me it's been snatched over 2000 times since being uploaded 10 hours ago, so it's VERY sad only 222 have stuck around to seed.  Pirate Bay users aren't known for giving back to the community :(

panamalynn - If you're still not downloading successfully, there must be a connection problem on your side.  Close and reopen your torrent program, open any firewalled ports, re-download the torrent file, reboot your computer.... these are all different things you can try in hopes to resolve connection issues.

,panamalynn,2012-06-29T15:34Z,Thanks duranie.  I left it on overnight and I am now finally at 67%.  At least I will get to watch it sometime today!  I will seed until the next episode at least.
