Playing on laptop hooked up to flatscreen and receiver and it sounds like it's in a hallway.  The files' properties says it's only 2 channels and I can hear the sound effects and score much higher than the actors.

In Running Scared, the main guy took a fucking HOCKEY PUCK to the forehead! What did it do? Put a little cut on his head. Realism is non-existent. So is originality.
