Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 26 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc"
