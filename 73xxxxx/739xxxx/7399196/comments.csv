,God_Am,2012-06-30T01:52Z,"Thanks for the crack. Really appreciate it!

But, if you could confirm two things, that'd be really great.

1. I reckon we should use this crack on trial version downloaded from Adobe website, yes?

2. And speaking of trial version... Will Premiere have with all of its presets after we apply this patch? All of the Adobe Master Collection torrents out there do have that issue even after one installs preset pack, or something.

Thanks and have a nice day/night."

,stalker277,2012-07-24T02:16Z,"For me it doesn't work on individual programs, it says the response key is not good. Will need to try the whole MC.

Instructions for getting the activation key:
1. Disconnect from internet
2. Run the keygen
3. Press Generate once, and copy the serial number, DON'T CLOSE THE KEYGEN
4. Enter it in the registration application and proceed, restart application if necessary until you will see a link that says problem connecting, click it and it will offer you offline activation
5. Copy the activation code from app to the keygen which you should have LEFT IT OPEN, make sure to clear the text from the middle box, where you need to put your code in
6. With the serial you've used before, and now the new activation code, press Generate once more and a response code will appear in the third box
7. Use that response code to activate your MC."
,bossy22,2012-07-24T22:42Z,"Ok.. Understood. Nevertheless I have generated new serial and so the Keygen won't accept my activation code and thus no response code.

,passion4722,2012-07-25T00:30Z,"For all who seem to get stuck at the ""Request Code"" problem and can't seem to find it, there is another way to find it.  After installing with disconnected network open Photoshop or any program for that matter, click on Help and choose Product Registration.  It will then give you the option to register it Offline. Click Register Offline and then you will get the Request Code. Now copy that code and paste on your Keygen middle box and click Generate.  Copy and Paste the generated Code back to the Program and click OK."
,bossy22,2012-07-25T01:24Z,"Sorry.. It doesn't work tried it again now. Pasted the activation code into the keygen app, Which I left open and then pressed generate.. The keygen app just generated a new serial, but no response code. Not on my system.."
,stalker277,2012-07-25T07:42Z,"In ProgramData > Adobe > SLStore
In Program Files > Common Files > Adobe > SLCache

And in Registry Both HKLM and HKCU, in Software > Adobe and look for serial like keys (folder)

Delete those but back them up first."
,stalker277,2012-07-25T22:52Z,"@bossy22 try the whole MC... get it from adobe and when installing it, put a serial number.

Make sure these are in hosts file:
lmlicenses wip4 adobe
lm licenses adobe
If they are you can install it even with internet connected.

Once the installer finishes, run any app installed. It will try to connect, fail, put up a link to try offline activation.

Get the request code, and for the keygen to generate an activation code you need to:
1. have the same serial as installed
2. clear the request field before pasting
3. make sure you paste code starting with a char and ending with =, no white spaces in front of after the code

If the request code is valid, pressing the generate button will give you an activation code, if not it will generate a new license.

I've just installed DW, FW and PS. None of them have that the CPU 50% usage on idle bug, like DW did with the cracked amtlib.dll solution, and PS is Extended, has the 3D menu and all. the rest I didn't install some need 64-bit win.

Make the compromise and the the whole thing. MC with Xforce is way better than any cracked dll variants."

,SarahJo1215,2012-07-29T01:20Z,I have tried/generated about 10+ serials and none of them will work. HELP PLEASE!!!
,stalker277,2012-08-02T23:28Z,"Hm... that's messed up.

I got the Master Collection from Adobe, I downloaded a helper app, ran that, it showed me some products, picked master collection and it started to download, then install and finally I used the keygen and blocked the addresses in hosts file. It worked fine.


Try to clean up your system.

First uninstall everything, including Flash Player, Shockwave player etc. Go into Registry and delete the Adobe keys from HK Local machine and HK Current user, both of them are under Software, if you're on a 64-bit machine, check WOW64 or WOW32, some under those keys, either directly under Software or in Software -> Microsoft or in Software -> Microsoft -> Windows

Use the Flash Player uninstaller from the website... go to Adobe Flash Professional product page in more products, look at the bottom for Help section, go to product updates and then there's a link to older versions of Flash Player, go down to see also, uninstall flash player and follow the instructions.

Now manually delete every file related to adobe. Look in
C -> ProgramData
C -> Program Files (both if you have them)
-> Common File -> Adobe
-> Adobe
C -> Users -> user -> AppData and check all 3 folders (Local, LocalLow, and Roaming) for Adobe

Delete these, restart, then try to install fresh.
Install Flash Player again, the page above with older versions also has the latest archived version, for IE, Firefox/Chrome and Projector, use that if you want it.

After this cleanse you should be able to install.

Don't forget to add the hosts mentioned in the instructions to the hosts file."
,headbanging_bitch,2012-08-02T23:33Z,"installed about 30 mins after this was uploaded ( so just over a month ) and all still running bang on. x force always seems to deliver, along with thethingy - there is always a solution. 
to the people who are struggling it is something you are doing, if it was this keygen then there would have been an update within a few hours/days as there was with the cs5.5 when all serials stopped through timeout. so read the instructions and just do what they say if i can do it it cannot be too hard.
simples."
,17serpiente,2012-08-06T22:30Z,"Thanks but it's not working . I did everything the instruction says and looks to work fine.

i changed the hosts before installing."
,stalker277,2012-08-08T03:52Z,"@17serpiente, I don't know if you're referring to adobe id. You need to create an adobe id, online... don't use your actual information, just make something up, create a new email account on live or yahoo, sign up on their page free of charge, that's the user and password the applications want when starting up because you're ""testing"" trial products and this is a requirement by adobe. This should be done only once and you should keep the id and password for future use."
,17serpiente,2012-08-08T07:00Z,"Thanks so much guys for the help.

@headbanging_bitch:  I think I did eveything ok with the host file. 

@stalker277:  I was referring to the small sign that pops out when I connect my laptop to the internet after applying the keygen thing. I mean, I want to patch the MasterCollection cs6, but just after I connect the sign appears and my serial  is revoked. I thing I'm doing something wrong ( I'd installed/uninstalled three times now)

I'll keep trying, just one question btw, if I do everything ok, I won't need to fill out an adobe id, right?

Thanks again for the help pals & have a nice one!!!"
,headbanging_bitch,2012-08-08T15:37Z,"@17serpiente i have no id as i think when it is installed offline it skips that as you cannot sign in without internet.
good luck."
,stalker277,2012-08-08T20:04Z,"I've installed it while online and had to log in with the adobe id. Haven't tried it offline, so I can't say. It's possible that the installation kit if downloaded from adobe might expect an online machine. A screenshot of the problem would've helped."
,hgtg,2012-08-09T09:48Z,"Just to let you know, this works with standalone Adobe product. The catch here is to use a serial number intended for the standalone product, DO NOT use a Master Collection serial for activate individual products.

Also you have to paste the serial in the keygen in the first field (it has to be present), then copy/paste the activation request, then generate the activation code.

Tried it on a standalone PS CS6. Hope this helps. :)"
,catalien,2012-08-09T14:33Z,"hello, @scene4all and @stalker277 and all. First, THANX a lot for this. Everything's working brilliantly. Just ONE thing. I still keep disconnecting from the Internet, because of this one thing I'm not entirely sure about ...

I followed the intructions, deleted previous entries in the host file, and double-clicked the  disable_activation.cmd. But when I went back to the host file after doing everything else in-between these two actions, four lines of code were back in the host file. I added ""# Adobe Blocker"" and the two lines (of the instructions) following that after those other lines ... 

Should I delete those other lines?
Should I copy them in here to give them to you in detail?
In the instructions, there are only two lines of code. Are they really enough?

I'd be awful glad (and possibly others too) if you could confirm they're good enough.
On one site elsewhere, I found someone recommending about 60 lines ... I'm sure that's too much of the good :-)

The keygen is not a Trojan, it just has some program routines that might be similar to those of a Trojan. Try to first run it in SandBoxie and see if it launches any other application, iexplore.exe or some names like gibberish. Then it's a Trojan.


@andrew1470 never seen the error, it might be your system only."

,stalker277,2012-08-30T03:05Z,"That's for a clean install, this way you remove 99% of what might screw up the registration.

Make sure you first clear the fields in the keygen, then press generate for a serial, leave it open, then complete the steps for getting the activation string, paste that in the clean field, and press generate one more time, if both of them ""match"", a request string will pop up.

It works, you just need to figure out the steps.

ALSO NOTE, if it asks you to sing up online or sign in with your adobe id, after the activation is done or later on when using the applications, DON'T! It will check your registration and reset it to trial. Just close the message and ignore it."

Click the 10, scroll down and now you'll have a list of files. The one you need it xf-mccs6.exe

Disable your AV, recheck the torrent and continue downloading the missing pieces.

Or check your AV's quarantine storage, it might be there and you can extract it faster."
,prometheusx,2012-09-06T19:38Z,"dude you are awesome!! I installed as a clean install and one with an erase old install and it worked like a charm, if you follow the instructions to the letter and dont click in generate again after u got your serial number or close the keygen bfore getting your request code IT WILL WORK and you will be able to update without problems, thanks scene4all,"

,ViperSniper1149,2012-09-11T17:25Z,"On my 4th attempt.
Brand new system. Win7 Pro
Have gone through, deleted Adobe Reg info, added Host blocks, made sure all the SLstore & other adobe directories are gone.

Full Master Collection Trial from Adobe.
Installs fine. Follow instructions to the letter.
Takes code and activates offline.
Can run any of the programs 1 time. If I close it and try to rerun anything, says service is invalid, resetting trial.

I even have made sure all the adobe products that seem to automatically get added to Zone Alarm (latest) have them with no internet access. 4th time in a row. Always same as above.  

Any ideas?"
,Keithioa,2012-09-12T03:51Z,"Hey everyone,

I can get everything working perfectly if I'm OFFLINE, but the moment I go online a popup comes up and I'm asked to register an ID and can't use the program anymore.

I've used this
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7191990/ADOBE_TOOL_v2.1_%5Bthethingy%5D
to clean up and manage my host files but to no avail.

While offline, my order of procedure goes
1. Activate the serial with the keygen provided and go through that entire process.
2. Use the Adobe tool in the link above to clean up my host files.
3. Run the disable_activation program.
4. Go back online hoping everything works fine only to be blocked by that registration popup.

Please any help? My lady needs this for school and we just don't have the money to fork out the full copy."
,phins13mp,2012-09-13T03:43Z,"OK, so everything goes fine and I get a Request Code. I clear out the Request field and enter it and I keep getting an error for Invalid Request Code? Any ideas?

I've used the same Serial and kept it open during the entire process. Don't get it."
,stalker277,2012-09-13T12:04Z,"It is possible that Adobe made some silent changes to the online installation kit. I've opened DW many times and had no forced sign-in alert.

@phins13mp, try to clear fields first, then press generate to get a serial and then proceed with activation. Make sure you copy no pre or post white spaces.
"
,Keithioa,2012-09-14T00:13Z,"@stalker277

Could it be because I updated it? I thought I read somewhere that it was safe to update...

Maybe if I uninstall it and reinstall without updating that will fix it. Does anyone know if an update is necessary to get certain features/benefits from the program?"
,whyyou,2012-09-14T17:45Z,"i installed everything fine when offline. when i reconnected to the internet it asked for my adobe id and then said my serial is no good. i'm back in trial mode. 

any updates? recent successes?"
,whyyou,2012-09-14T17:47Z,"also, i'm using windows 7 64bit"
,Keithioa,2012-09-15T18:22Z,"@whyyou

I finally got it working. Just to be safe, I did a clean install.

To begin, download this file.
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7191990/ADOBE_TOOL_v2.1_%5Bthethingy%5D

When it's done

- run it and clean your host files with ""reset"". (Not sure exactly if it's 100% safe to do that, but hey, it worked for me with no problems)

- Next, click the top button (think it's ""check hosts"" or something like that)

- Then, ""Patch"". This will make sure that your host files are completely fresh and ready to prep.

- Now it's time to disconnect from the internet. Do so, then follow the torrent installation instructions to the T. Install, crack with the keygen.

- DON'T connect to the internet yet.

- Go into your host files (Windows > System32 > drivers > etc > hosts.

- MAKE SURE that it's not set to ""read only"". Right click the file, and go to properties, and uncheck the box if it is.

- Open the host file with notepad and ADD these two lines to the bottom of your file:

127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com

- SAVE

- Doing all this by memory but if it serves me correct you can now connect to your network. Update your adobe programs then restart your computer.

- It should now work properly without asking you for any ID

I'll add anything if I forgot a step."
,Keithioa,2012-09-15T20:02Z,"Just as an add-on to my last post, if you run into problems while trying to edit the host files saying you don't have permission or something like that, then follow these steps:

- right click on your host file and go to properties
- go into the security tab and press the ""advanced"" button
- click ""change permissions""
- select the user profile you are currently using and click ""edit""
- in the permissions check list, make sure ""full control"" is selected.
- save these settings

this should fix your issue if you're having troubles saving the host file"
,stalker277,2012-09-16T15:30Z,"After you install it, when it asks you to sign in, find a way to avoid it. Close it and restart it, alt+f4-it, skip-it, later-it, anything but DO NOT SIGN IN AFTER ACTIVATION. It will invalidate the activation."
