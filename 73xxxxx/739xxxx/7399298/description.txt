Prager 20120629 ... 1 Roberts Review

Prager H1... Dennis talks to Congressman David Dreier, Chairman of the House Rules Committee about the Roberts ruling on
 ObamaCareΓÇª Why do Democrats keep saying that Republicans donΓÇÖt have a health care reform plan when they obviously do?
 The question should be, who doesnΓÇÖt have a plan?.. 
 Why did Roberts rule the way he did? He wanted to protect the integrity of the court. 
 But that doesnΓÇÖt make his decision correct.
