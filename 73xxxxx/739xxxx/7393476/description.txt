In the present, an unexpected ghost is surfacing the family's lives and they found out that Sang Kang Kang that is supposed to be married by their father was already dead and they need to quest for the tranquility of their lives by travelling all the way to South Korea.[3] As Kimmy and Dora accepts the proposals of their boyfriends played by Zanjoe Marudo and Dingdong Dantes, strange things began to happen leading their boyfriends and their father in a comatose condition.
