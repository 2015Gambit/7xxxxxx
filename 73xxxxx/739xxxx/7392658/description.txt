The Jewish Jesus, Gordon Robertson CBN

Thousands of years ago, Hebrew prophets wroth that the Jewish messiah would be a descendant of king David.

Born in Bethlehem and raised in Nazareth, He would be a teacher and a healer. He would be welcomed as a king... and yet killed as a criminal. Three days later, He would rise from the dead. 

Only one man in history fulfilled all of those prophecies, and more.

In the Emmy-nominated series, The Jewish Jesus, Gordon Robertson uses more than 50 old Testament prophecies to tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth, from His birth to His resurrection and death. Learn more about:
Finding Jesius in the Psalms.
The archaeology of Jesus' life, from Galilee to Jerusalem
Jesus' Jewish roots

See The Story of Jesus as it was written Hundreds of years before His birth.

Also included: A SPECIAL DVD bonus, The Family of Jesus. Discover the story of Jesus' brothers, cousins and grandnephews, who led the church in Jerusalem of more than a century after His death and resurrection.
