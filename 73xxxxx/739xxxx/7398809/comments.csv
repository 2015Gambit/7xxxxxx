,rex084,2012-07-27T09:01Z,don't download..has a trojan in the patches!
,T3chEra,2012-07-28T10:27Z,"The folder named RED-patch comes up as a Trojan32. Shouldn't be a problem for anyone with a decent antivirus. The Crack does work.

Just use the folder named Crack, instead, by dragging the ytd.exe from inside it, into the folder where you installed youtubedownloader (the default location should be C:ProgramFilesGreenTree ApplicationsYTD Video Downloader )

Then, when it runs and asks if you want to install the newest version of Pro, click no every time, because it will always downgrade you back to basic.

So just make sure you use the Crack instead of the Red-patch(it's easier, anyway) and never update to the latest version, and everything should work as expected. 
I just finished using it to convert 500+ MBs worth of .mp4 and .flv into .mp3 for my iphone all at once, whereas the basic version would make you convert them one file at a time. Everything went perfectly."
