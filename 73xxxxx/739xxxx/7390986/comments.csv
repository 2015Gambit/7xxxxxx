,stripteese,2012-06-27T12:04Z,One of the best cleaners ever! =] 10x for upload.
,xpmule,2012-06-27T20:02Z,"I know everyone already probably knows :)
But this is originaly a free program and still is..
The free version is the same except for an auto update feature and if you buy it you are entitled to technical support.. thats pretty much it.
So the free version has no nag's or reminders of any kind and will never ask you to register or buy anything.
So your not missing anything if you just use the free one..
Also this program is a popular virus spreader, a few days ago i downloaded a couple of them and found some extremely fishy behaviour and by the time i came back and posted my results TPB mod's had already removed the torrents(s).
So please do be carefull when looking for thos one people.

AND I'm not saying anything bad about this upload. I am NOT downloading it because i don't want it.
I'm just tryin to look out for my fellow pirates ;)"

,Plan9x128,2012-07-09T14:50Z,"Just use the free one. No need for this Enterprise hassle. This is just with auto update, technical support and network support extra. I assume everyone is fine with the power that free version provides."

,CatsInSilkPants,2012-08-21T16:02Z,"Hmmm... but doesn't this version have the added benefit of wiping temp data from all profiles? A big plus if you have multiple users, or if you're an IT professional in a business environment. ;)"
,Jamusafl,2012-08-26T00:25Z,Even though it works it can't update without first registering the product. therefore it is not activated as stated in your heading. Thanks for the upload though...
,DontDisLikeMe,2012-09-06T08:55Z,thx
