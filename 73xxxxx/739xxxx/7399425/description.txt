Note: took my time with this one very
nice source indeed except the flicker
on it nice and smooth now without
breaking the sharpen, as peeps already
knows this had abit to much red in scnes
didnt alter the sat for this 1, altered
the colours a tad it came out better
then reducing the sat then my usual other
filters and BAM very nice jus got a flicker
from time to time , HOPE You Enjoy

Note2: flicker aint as bad but still,
check the sample included Enjoy
