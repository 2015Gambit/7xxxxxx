American Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by writers and executive producers Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Smiths, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Stan and Francine; their children Hayley and Steve; and their anthropomorphic pets Klaus and Roger. The show is set in the fictional town of Langley Falls, Virginia (in the Washington, D.C. metro area) which is a parody of the actual town of Langley, Virginia, home to the headquarters of the CIA. Unlike sister show Family Guy it doesn't exhibit its humor in the form of cutaway gags, but rather focuses more on situational humor, the use of non sequitur, and slapstick.

Since its debut on May 1, 2005, the show has broadcast 133 episodes and seven seasons.

American Dad! has been nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy Award and 2 Annie Awards, in which the result was nominated. American Dad! has also received both praise and criticism in comparison to sister show Family Guy. American Dad! holds a TV-14 rating, which has resulted in the show being criticized for its indecency by watchdog groups such as the Parents Television Council[1], which often criticizes co-creator MacFarlane's other series, Family Guy.
