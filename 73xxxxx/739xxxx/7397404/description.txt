DESCRIPTION:

AS ALEX PRUDΓÇÖHOMME and his great-aunt Julia Child were completing their collaboration on her memoir, My Life in France, they began to talk about the French obsession with bottled water, which had finally spread to America. 
From this spark of interest, PrudΓÇÖhomme began what would become an ambitious quest to understand the evolving story of freshwater. What he found was shocking: as the climate warms and world population grows, demand for water has surged, but supplies of freshwater are static or dropping, and new threats to water quality appear every day. 
The Ripple Effect is PrudΓÇÖhommeΓÇÖs vivid and engaging inquiry into the fate of freshwater in the twenty-first century.
