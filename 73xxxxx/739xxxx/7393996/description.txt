This fascinating plunge into the demimonde of marijuana cultivation is a trip, in every sense. ItΓÇÖs an armchair travel book that ranges from AmsterdamΓÇÖs coffee shops to a California plantation hidden in a sequoia forest. And itΓÇÖs a grail quest by a witty American journalist not afraid to inhale. Haskall SmithΓÇÖs mission is to find the ultimate high, what the cognoscenti call ΓÇ£dankness.ΓÇ¥ But like the Amsterdam judges who award the annual Cannabis Cup, the Super Bowl of pot appreciation, he faces a paradox: ΓÇ£Would I be too stoned to recognize ΓÇÿdanknessΓÇÖ when I found it?ΓÇ¥

Smith, a novelist and contributor to the Los Angeles Times, stays straight enough to do some fine reportage. We learn that weed is the new wine, with dizzying varieties of taste, nose and terroir. The two basic cannabis strains are as distinct as cabernet and sauvignon blancΓÇöindica, with its stupifying ΓÇ£body stone,ΓÇ¥ and savita with its espresso buzz of mental acuity. Then there are the namesΓÇösuch as Himalayan Snow, Green Crack, AK-47, White Widow, Lemon Haze, Trainwreck, Casey Jones and Connie Chung. As Smith tracks down cult-like teams of botanists breeding new strains of superweed, he meets some remarkable ganja gurusΓÇönotably Michael Backes, a Los Angeles visionary who helped create sci-fi technologies for Iron Man, Spider-Man and Jurassic Park.

Smith also delves into the politics of pot. He explores the ΓÇ£hippie versus hipster schismΓÇ¥ and the sliding scale of legality, with medical licensing and legit seed companies at one end and outlaw growers dodging the feds at the other. Ironically, AmericaΓÇÖs crackdown on weed has driven farmers to move their crop inside, leading to ΓÇ£a boost in potency and a boom in demand for high-quality genetics.ΓÇ¥ With a vast cottage industry of high-tech grow ops, a plant ΓÇ£that thrives in almost any climate, in any country in the world, now mostly grows indoors.ΓÇ¥ The ΓÇ£heart of danknessΓÇ¥ remains elusive. But SmithΓÇÖs road to enlightenmentΓÇöas much about culture as cultivationΓÇöpacks a heady contact high.
