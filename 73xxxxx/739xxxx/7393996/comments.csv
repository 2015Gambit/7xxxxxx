,senseinai,2012-06-28T06:24Z,"You are using 'curly quotes' and apostrophes instead of plain text ... They are seen as characters, and that's what you see printed here."
,d347hBy73,2012-06-29T03:09Z,"Thanks, Senseninai. So apostrophes and parentheses won't work...how strange. I wish TPB would give us some formatting options to create better descriptions of our uploads."

your uploads are still excellent..."
