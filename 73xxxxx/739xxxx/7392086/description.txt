Why Freedom of Thought Requires Free Media and Why Free Media Require Free Technology

Media that spy on and data-mine the public are capable of destroying humanityΓÇÖs most precious freedom: freedom of thought. Ensuring that media remain structured to support rather than suppress individual freedom and civic virtue requires us to achieve specific free technology and free culture goals. Our existing achievements in these directions are under assault from companies trying to bottleneck human communications or own our common culture, and states eager to control their subjectsΓÇÖ minds. In this talkΓÇôone of a series beginning with ΓÇ£TheManifestoΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Die Gedanken Sind FreiΓÇ¥ΓÇôI offer some suggestions about how the Free World should meet the challenges of the next decade.
