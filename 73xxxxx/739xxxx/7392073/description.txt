Memphis Jug Band with Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers [JSP] (4CD192kb)

Memphis Jug Band with Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers is a wonderful four-disc set which amounts to a street corner jug band party in a box, containing nearly every side recorded in the '20s and '30s by America's two best-ever jug bands, Will Shade's Memphis Jug Band and Gus Cannon & His Jug Stompers, including one-off sides by Memphis Jug Band members Shade, Hattie Hart, Minnie Wallace, Will Weldon and Vol Stevens. It's a whole lot of fun, and actually more varied than one might think. Among the highlights are the iconic "Sun Brimmer's Blues," the kazoo-led "Mississippi River Waltz," the hardly subtle "She Stabbed Me with an Ice-Pick," and the accomplished and haunting "Fourth Street Mess" by the Memphis Jug Band, and three classic sides from the Jug Stompers, "Minglewood Blues," the bubbly "Feather Bed," and "Viola Lee Blues." More kazoos, jugs and banjos than you can shake a stick at, with great vocals and solid songs.  (Steve Leggett)
