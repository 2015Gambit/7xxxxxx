Towards the end of colonial India, Shahid       
Khan loots the British trains, impersonating    
the legendary Sultana Daku. Now outcast,        
Shahid becomes a worker at Ramadhir Singh's     
colliery, only to spur a revenge battle that    
passes on to generations. At the turn of the    
decade, Shahid's son, the philandering Sardar   
Khan vows to get his father's honor back,       
becoming the most feared man of Wasseypur.      
Staying true to its real life influences, the   
film explores this revenge saga through the     
socio-political dynamic in erstwhile Bihar      
(North India), in the coal and scrap trade      
mafia of Wasseypur, through the imprudence of   
a place obsessed with mainstream 'Bollywood'.
