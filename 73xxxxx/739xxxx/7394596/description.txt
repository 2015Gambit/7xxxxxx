The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities
The Tower, an observational documentary which has been filmed over three years, charts the urban regeneration of the notoriously troubled Pepys Estate in South London. A property developer is turning a dilapidated former council high-rise into luxury riverside apartments and another is being demolished and rebuilt for public sector workers. The changes are happening under the gaze of those still living in the original local authority houses next door. 

The Tower: A Tale of Two Cities won the best factual series BAFTA award in 2008.

Love is in the air in the Tower and on the estate. Kelley Garcia finally weds Wayne Tapper, with half of the estate in tow. Newcomers Saima and Usman are now in Pakistan for their arranged wedding and any room for doubt is rapidly running out. For devout Muslim Shakor, life after an arranged marriage means coping with a wife and kids and making a life on the estate. However the summer of love on the estate is abruptly disrupted. The 7/7 bombings send shock waves through the community.
