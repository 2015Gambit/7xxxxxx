Decent quality, but glare on some pages. Most if not nearly all is perfectly readable.
+1"
,Ikslajan,2012-06-29T17:28Z,It's Local Ork's torrent (not mine scan tho)
,caidenlee,2012-06-29T23:28Z,"Did nothing, gave my Anti virus a few hijack attempts, 1click download leads to nothing. Don't download."
,caidenlee,2012-06-29T23:32Z,"Deleted my comment, it's fake. 1 click download leads to nothing. Attempted a few invasions on my firewall."
,nazgull2k10,2012-06-30T00:59Z,"1 click download... ?  Are you completely idiotic?  Its a simple PDF file.  you get the torrent via magnet.. you download it... you click it, then Adobe opens and then you READ it.  

Stupid people shouldn't be allowed on the internet.... or be allowed to post on the internet..  ever.

Perfectly Fine for what it is.  Readable, and Im grateful for it.  Thanks to the anonymous uploader!"
,Waphlez,2012-06-30T10:06Z,Missing the appendices.
,wickedtea,2012-06-30T13:52Z,Where do you get the appendices from??? The reference section that lists all of the new model types...? Oh and by the way the FAQ are all updates on the GW site.
,nazgull2k10,2012-06-30T16:59Z,"Appendices *are* missing, sadly, these appendices show the Hull Points for the vehicles.. and is a major piece missing!"
,Ikslajan,2012-07-01T10:41Z,"Not anymore!

,jordanis0,2012-07-01T12:09Z,"thanks for saving me money, but with pages being blurry and content missing, its a tad hard to get the rules down...is anyone working on a high-res scan?"
,nazgull2k10,2012-07-01T16:18Z,"The links posted are great... if the first 2 actually worked..  lol  They take me to some ""leech"" page.  Which really doesnt help much."
,Turiah,2012-07-01T19:52Z,"Decent, some pages are pretty blurry or glared out. Superb for first net release.

Anyway you can put them up so we can actually see them?"
,Turiah,2012-07-01T20:14Z,"Last one before I stfu. If your right click and ""save as"" you won't get bumped to the 4chan leech image."
,nazgull2k10,2012-07-01T23:02Z,"No, that doesnt work either.  Still takes me to some bullshit leech page."
,DeussZeus,2012-07-02T12:15Z,"lots of thanks , now i can start playing WH40k and start buying some TAU :D , thanks for saving me 60euro"
