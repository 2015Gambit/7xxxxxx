,EliseuRox,2012-06-29T00:36Z,"Very high school , romance shit.Not worth watching, but the quality is good."
,dfl3506,2012-06-29T02:17Z,"Quality is good but movie is total shit. New girl moves into new school, gets a hard time from other girls, blah, blah, blah. Gave up after 20 minutes, seen it a hundred times before."

Movie -10 (Damn Right That's a Negative Sign)

This movie was so horrible, it should include a bonus suicide rope.  I mean.  WTF.  Let me save you some agony.  It all begins with this beech looking like storm (the X-Man Mutant) by the head, it all ends with fuckery.  Main star is cute but I'd rather play roulette with a fully loaded pistol than watch some shit like this again.  As a matter of fact, its so bad its not shit.  That's an insult to shit, shit is better than this movie.  This movie is corn  (gross, if that joke wasn't over your head)
