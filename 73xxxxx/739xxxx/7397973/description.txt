Hey guys, I made an updater for Counter-Strike 1.6. If your Counter-Strike game is broken, or outdated you can update it with this tool. 

Usage: 

1. Place CS_upadate.exe near cstrike folder (e.g. C:Program FilesValve)
2. Run it. 

Tested on 32-bit Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 and it works as it should be. 

Here's a virus scan:

File name:	CS_update.exe
Detection ratio:	1 / 42
Analysis date:	 2012-06-29 11:57:28 UTC ( 19 minutes ago )

1 detection (TR/Downloader.Gen): Why? because it downloads files to update your counter-strike to v43.

Also, I have uploaded it to my vps. so here's the direct link: http://77.241.199.69/CS_update.exe

And of course if you have any questions feel free to ask.
