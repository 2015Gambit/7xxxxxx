,r0bbinh00d,2012-06-30T06:25Z,What's Hollywood's fascination with Hitler / Germany / Naziism? What's next? A movie about how German soldiers were really aliens with superhuman strength and mind bullets??  It's so tired.

This is NOT a Hollywood film. This is an independent Finnish/German/Australian film."
