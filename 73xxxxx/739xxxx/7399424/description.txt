Ancient pictures reveal that the harp was known to the Egyptians as early as 3000 B.C. It was adopted by the Irish many years ago as their national instrument...Kim Robertson is classically trained on pedal harp and piano and has made traditional playing and interpretation of Celtic harp her life's work. Her first album is a lovely work that shows a rare sensitivity to the music and the instrument.
