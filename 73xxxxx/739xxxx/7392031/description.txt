Sources - ADTRG LINE/21 SECS OF CAM AUDIO
          1080p VIDEO files.....Thanks :P


Notes -

the new video source a bit of a flicker to it.. have removed 60% of it... other than that it is very good copy.. the audio used us the adtrg's line... used 16 secs of cam audio at the start to fill in the missing gap.. and 15 secs of audio to fill in the last part of the movie... overall denoised, sharpened, tweaked the colours and then muxed over the synced audio to the encode.. enjoy ;)
