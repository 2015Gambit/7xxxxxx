Setup
-HP G72-250US
-Intel Core i3 M350 2.27GHz
-8Gb PC3-10700 RAM
-Win7 64-bit SP1
-SB X-Fi Surround 5.1

Process
-Original 16/44.1 files joined in Wavelab 6
-DC offset removed, this will yield a file with a bit depth of 18-24 bits
-Resample to 384kHz in Wavelab w/crystal resampler ultra(slow) relax background priority
-Perform 2-pass recording process in Wavelab @ 64-bit float/384kHz 0db gain

As reported in Wavelab:
-Original 16/44 - Apparent Bit Resolution = 16, Peak = 0db
-DC Offset Removed - Apparent Bit Resolution = no offset (16), Peak = 0db
-Final Recording - Apparent Bit Resolution = 40, Peak = 0.977db

-Convert newly recorded 64/384 file to DSD128 with Weiss Saracon 1.61-27*
*this step allows me to keep nearly all of the detail of the 64/384 file when going to lower bit depths/sampling frequencies

Settings in Weiss Saracon:
-Modulator Type - CRFB 10th Order
-Sample Rate - 5.6448MHz
-Gain (db SACD) - 0db
-Stabilizer - off
-Dither - off

-Convert newly created DSD file to 24-bit/96kHz wav file with Weiss Saracon 1.61-27 w/0db gain and TPDF dither
-Apply precision 6db gain* and MBIT+ Dither (Noise Shaping - Light, Dither Amount - High, Auto-blanking - on) in Wavelab w/Izotope Ozone 4 VST Plugin
*DSD -> PCM = -6db
-Flac encode level 0 with Trader's Little Helper
-Tag and pic with xrecode II"
