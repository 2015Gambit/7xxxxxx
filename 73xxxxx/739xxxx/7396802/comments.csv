,azureray,2012-06-30T00:31Z,"Just to clarify to everyone, this is still one of the beta releases. You can only test play on iOS and Android using the Runner app, you cannot built stand-alone packages for them."
,NugShow,2012-06-30T01:06Z,"dang. again, I'd really like one that can update to the post-release versions."
,kachan64,2012-09-02T03:08Z,"@azureray  What are you talking abt mate? Get your facts straight. Even tho they can not compile to app, apk, html5 etc, but you can easily found them by typing %tmp% in your start menu. Make sure all other temp files deleted first and you will find this game."
,MG-Unit,2012-09-04T16:13Z,It's nice and all but I basically have to reinstall it every hour or so because error messages keep popping up. Fix?
