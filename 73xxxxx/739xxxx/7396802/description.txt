My second upload, because I'm new at this. 


What's inside: Game Maker Studio V 1.0.52 + working patch + A good book + TUTS from the main yoyo site(To save you time from download them)+ for free = fun!!!
 

Here is how to install your free GMS. 

Click on the Installer

let it install, but wait for a dowloan window to appear.

Close that Download window by hitting on cancel. 

It will ask you to update You will click on the skip this version button!!!!

Whatever you do, Do not update. 

On installion is finish close out the program and go to the patch folder.

Make sure AVG and other Virus programs are turned off. 

*NOTE There isn't any real virus here. The patch just looks like a virus to the scanners*

Once patched then you can make games under any platefroms.. 

Make sure to read up on the online wiki documents to learn how to make games in Android, iOS, windows, and HTML5.
