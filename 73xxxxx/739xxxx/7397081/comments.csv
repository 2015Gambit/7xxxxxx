,MrStarz,2012-06-29T05:39Z,thanks so much yify - just 1 tiny thing .... your upload of harry potter 1 was awful - it is barely a dvd rip let alone 1080p .. all the others have been excellent 
,MrStarz,2012-06-29T05:51Z,this one is also fabulous as well yify - thanks
,term_chill,2012-07-01T20:27Z,720p versions of all the hp movies?
,kaze_12,2012-07-04T03:37Z,great upload... you think you could also do the starwars movies
,coffeeboy2k,2012-07-05T03:39Z,"Thanks for your awesome uploads YIFI! When are you posting Part 2?

BTW, would have to agree with MrStarz about HP1. Not a very good rip. But you labeled it as FIRST TRY so you must have another version, no? :)"
,hunt2012,2012-07-05T13:29Z,"Can you do the whole HP series? Thanks Yify, love your work"

I don't know what it is about these foreign uploader. But 1080P is not 1920x800.. The 1080 itself comes from 1920x1080 "
,Asuzejo144,2012-07-20T04:54Z,Is the part 2 also coming in 1080p? Hope so..
