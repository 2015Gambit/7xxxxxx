Unrated movies mean that the company added parts either to the movie itself or to the actual disk that wasn't rated by the rating system. You can look up the BluRay disc and see what part was unrated.

Usually if it's uncut version that's usually a Directors Cut which means it's the Directors original version before it was edited."
