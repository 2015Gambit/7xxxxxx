How can Hindi be 'wrong' when the worldwide Hindi market is larger, richer, and more diverse than The West? How can Hindi be 'wrong' when Hindi marketplace growing so fast in numbers, wealth, and geography that economists can't even  can only 'estimate' real growth rate?
How can Hindi be 'wrong' when Bollywood is acclaimed nearly universally in creating more original, creative, energetic, dramatic, comedic, action, and just plain fun-in-every-way cinema than tired old Hollywood has been able to do for some years now?

@ blah546:
Great comment! Agree completely!"

,Biglite,2012-07-07T00:18Z,"@whraglynx
Unless there's some other comment that was deleted... I think he just meant the uploader selected English, when he should've put in Hindi. Not that India was or is inferior to 'The West.'

Also, it's mostly about money, there are sites that have listings of movies Bollywood plagiarizes or were 'inspired by'. There are also clips of Indian pastiches of Superman and what not on youtube. Sorry, but like all industries, they churn out crap too."
