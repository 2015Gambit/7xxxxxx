,Tijeras94,2012-07-08T07:35Z,"By choosing to update the software, it will connect with the company website and transfer information. Some of that information is a serial number used to identify and operate that particular software. When the company notices that the serial number used to update is one that has been pirated or even used on many different computers all over the world, they will have record of your personal information and could prosecute you for theft of their software. 

In short, it's a bad idea To Updated!!!!!!!"

I downloaded and installed was able to surf the web on my android device. The software somehow updated itself to 3.5 and it stopped working. I guess i should have edited the host file to stop it from updating itself. Now I uninstalled it using RevoUninstaller pro and reinstalled but it doesnt work at all. I tried this many times but failed. 
what can I do now in order to make it work?"
