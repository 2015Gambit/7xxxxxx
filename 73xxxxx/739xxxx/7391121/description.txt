(s)crap(s)
Recently, a man walked up to me, and said, ΓÇ£Hey Lash!ΓÇ¥ I was surprised that I was recognized so easily, and asked the man if he was a fan. He avoided the question, and told me heΓÇÖd give me $20 if I let him shit all over my chest. As a starving musician, the chance for a meal and $20 was just too much to pass up, so I accepted.
The man handed me the money, and told me to follow him home. I know, I should have just run off with the money right there. I guess IΓÇÖm just too nice. The man walked into his house, and I was surprised to see a child, looking about the age of four, sitting on the couch, listening to gangster rap and watching hardcore gay pornography on a bigscreen TV. ΓÇ£Daddy!ΓÇ¥ The boy yelled, as he jumped up to hug the man. He noticed me, and stopped. ΓÇ£Is this the poopy man?ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Yes, boy, this is the poopy man.ΓÇ¥ The boy look thrilled. ΓÇ£Can I watch?ΓÇ¥ He asked, grinning, revealing his missing teeth. ΓÇ£Of course you can, son.ΓÇ¥ Said the man. The boy looked overjoyed.
At this point, I started getting a little concerned, but hey, it wasnΓÇÖt my problem. The man took me to his room, and asked me to lie down on the bed. I did so. The boy sat on a chair and watched, excitedly. The man took off my shirt, which felt pretty good, I must admit. He then took off his pants, which, of course, I looked away from, while his son watched, enthralled. The man kneeled over my chest as he shat on me. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something in his closet. ΓÇ£What is that?ΓÇ¥ I asked the man. ΓÇ£Oh, nothing, donΓÇÖt worry about it.ΓÇ¥ The man said, straining to get his moneyΓÇÖs worth. The boy, however, seemed concerned. ΓÇ£Daddy?ΓÇ¥ He asked, ΓÇ£did the poopy man find mommy?ΓÇ¥
Now I was more than a little concerned, and asked to be excused from the proceedings. ΓÇ£Oh no you donΓÇÖt!ΓÇ¥ the man said, as he reached under his bed to grab a shotgun. Terrified, I threw the man off me and ran out of the room. The man shot at me as I passed by, but accidentally shot his child in the leg. More concerned with his child than with me, the man let me go. I emerged from the house, shirtless and covered in human feces, as police showed up to identify the shots. They arrested me. Dicks.
A few hours later, I was back at home, exhausted. I took a shower, and made these songs. Hopefully this EP makes you feel like you have poop on your chest, too.
Love,
Lash.
