This is supposedly an edited TV-14 version of the episode... I'll probably just wait, though."

[V],alexisthebest,2012-06-29T12:54Z,"Yea, it's censored.

As much as i like to watch things before everyone else, i'll just wait till the official episode is out.

Thanks though!"
,that_guy_you_are,2012-06-29T14:08Z,"For anyone who is hesitant about watching an ""edited"" version of the episode: it looks to be only edited to give it a lower classification. It runs for 26 minutes, so I don't think any scenes were cut. All that seems different is they censor the swear words, and put a black box over one tiny sex scene (in the recap) and one brief raised middle finger.

Totally worth the early download!
And thanks heaps DibyaTPB for your awesomeness."
,mikeike65,2012-07-01T17:27Z,@NaNaMoose Yes others have it. Just because the link wasn't sent to you does not mean it just doesn't exist. Smart-ass internet commenters are at the bottom of the food chain. And theres a damn good reason for that. Enjoy.
