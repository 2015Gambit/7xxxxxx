Remington and Granny are two brothers of the family Smisse, the most famous line of Rogues. As two good Smisse who respect themselves, they shamelessly steal anything that may fall under their hand!

If Granny is the type to hit before thinking, Remington is thinner. And even ΓÇª damn smart! Flying is an art, a feat,that does not tolerate the slightest miscalculation. More loot is protected, our friend is more interested in the challenge. Perhaps one way to find recognition from his peers ΓÇª or his father!
