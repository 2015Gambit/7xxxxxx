TIF L4D14 Momentum Drills Push off to Skating

Total Immersion Swimming: Freestyle Made Easy -- made even EASIER because BROKEN DOWN INTO INDIVIDUAL LESSONS AND DRILLS!

A brilliant swimming technique.

Make water your friend.

Maximize efficiency, effectiveness, balance, symmetry, enjoyment, beauty.

Technique matters.

No point in doing grueling laps and distances in practice and trying to swim FAST if you have a fundamentally flawed swimming technique -- and I've seen plenty of coaches let the youngest swimmers ingrain bad habits lap after lap, day after day until the kid had little hope of ever totally breaking all the bad habits and becoming a great swimmer.

TIF = Total Immersion Freestyle, L = lesson, D = drill, TIFSF = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle, TIFSFB = Total Immersion Four Strokes: Freestyle-Backstroke

Because both freestyle and backstroke are "Long Axis" (LA) strokes they are dealt with at the same time in the TIFSFB drills.
