This is another classic movie of Rajesh Khanna the SuperStar. He is playing a role of a rich man who does not care for GOD. He is after Reena Roy who in fact likes Rakesh Roshan. Rakesh ultimately dies and donates his eyes to Rajesh Khanna who had met with an accident. The character of Rajesh Khanna changes and he becomes a good man. The movie shows his excellent capabilities as an actor. The music of the movie is above average and one song is still remembered but it could have been better. The Holi song is good too. Unfortunately the movie is not available in Indian Market either on CD/DVD and we are craving to see the movie again as it has certain scenes which were later copied and used in different movies. It is a must see, if available for all movie lovers and they will understand what a Great Star Rajesh Khanna is.
