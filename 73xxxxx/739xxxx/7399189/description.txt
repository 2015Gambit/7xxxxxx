Translated and adapted excerpt from Portuguese rapper
Indrominado's 2012-03-19 interview to Tugaleaks:

"T: You made an album to be downloaded for free. What is it
about? Whom is it targeted to?

I: The album is called Antisistema; it's available at our
sites and pages. This album is just like the name says,
antisystem... Tracks 1 through 9 feature political
commentary and interventions by some members of the
Assembly of the Republic and the European Parliament. It is
undoubtedly targeted to all political forces about
political and social fighting, be it in Portugal or the
rest of the world... because we don't limit ourselves to
one country alone, but also to the world as a whole,
humankind, and to this planet's nature, which is sadly
acclaimed as the planet of the idiots..."
