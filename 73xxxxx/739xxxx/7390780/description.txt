Birds of a Feather

The truth can sometimes hurt and the Liars must
take that into account when deciding to reveal
secrets. Hanna's visits with Mona are driving a
wedge between Hanna and Caleb. But would it be so
bad if Hanna told Caleb that she needed to see Mona
to get information about this "A?" Aria, on the
other hand, is dreading telling Ella that Byron is
back in the dating scene and dating Meredith. But
wouldn't it be better if Ella found out from Aria
than hearing it someplace else? And Spencer needs
to know the truth about Melissa, even if the truth
hurts. Meanwhile, Emily finds some solace after
meeting Maya's cousin, Nathan.
