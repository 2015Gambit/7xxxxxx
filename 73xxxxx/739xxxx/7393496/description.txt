Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Wednesday, June 27 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Leslie Manookian, writer and producer of the award winning film The Greater Good, a documentary that questions government vaccination policies. The film is now available on DVD at the Infowars Store. Manookian was a successful Wall Street business executive who once worked for Goldman Sachs before turning to films. 

Alex also runs down the latest news, including an admission by the Pentagon that putting troops on the streets of America is illegal. 

He also covers the globalist engineered war against Syria where rebels financed and trained by Western intelligence agencies are now ransacking Christian churches.
