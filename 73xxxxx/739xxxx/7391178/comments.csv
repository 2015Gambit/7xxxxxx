 About The Show
 ======================================================

 Alan Partridge reveals the places that have made him the man he is today.

 Over the years, Norfolk has given us some of our greatest Britons, from Queen Boadicea and Sir 
 Robert Walpole to Hannah from S Club 7. It's also been home to broadcaster Alan Partridge (Steve 
 Coogan) for the best part, and best parts, of his life.

 In this special one-off documentary, Alan treats viewers to a guided tour of his beloved Norfolk, 
 revealing the places that have made him who, why and what he is today. From the Riverside Leisure 
 Centre, Norwich City Hall and his local newsagent to the luscious expanse of Thetford Forest, Alan 
 explores the key landmarks and natural beauty spots that have led some people to call Norfolk 
 the 'Wales of the east'.

 Norwich boasts more than 20 car dealerships, as well as some of the most sensible parking regulations 
 in the country - facts that really make the city a haven for motorists like Alan. What's more, his daily 
 commute to North Norfolk Digital Radio is a mere ten minutes by car, something Londoners could only 
 dream of. Alan's tour, of course, includes his place of work which, at 800 square feet, is bigger than 
 most good quality dentists'.

 Also taking in the church where he was christened, the local dry ski slope and the city's historic market 
 where people come from far and wide to buy monkey hats and tat, Welcome to the Places of My Life is 
 a comprehensive and compelling journey through Alan Partridge's home county.
