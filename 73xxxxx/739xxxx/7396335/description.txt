Here is the great UK cartoon! Aired in 2003!

I searched through the internet and found as many as I could, I think that I'm only missing one episode, called " The trial".
There is another called "A.I. Artificial Idiocy" , although after some research it's thought to have been written but never animated or made.

Anyway, if anyone knows where the last episode "the trial" is be sure to let me know!
