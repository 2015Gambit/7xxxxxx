We're still focusing on bug fixing so we eventually can release the 1.3 patch. 

The biggest problem right now is that since the game is hosting a server in the background, the game requires more hardware resources than before. 

We're trying to figure out a way to solve that, but hereΓÇÖs a weekly snapshot for now:

1. Added a menu with options for opening your single-player world

2. The multi-player menu now scans for LAN servers (single-player worlds)

3. Villagers will remove trade options after the option has been used 3-15 times

4. Added wooden stairs for the remaining three wood types

5. Corrected Ender Chest storage (no longer whiped on respawning)

6. A lot of smaller changes and fixes
