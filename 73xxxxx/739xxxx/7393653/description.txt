  Kulwant Rai is a prominent and wealthy    
  businessman. He relies solelymon his son, 
  Rakesh, to run his business. His second   
  son, Naresh, is a bit of a slacker,       
  unreliable, and is born out of marriage   
  with his second, wife, Shobha. When       
  Sunderlal passes away suddenly, Shobha    
  entrusts the entire business dealings     
  on Rakesh, and has Naresh assist him.     
  Naresh gambles, and even molests a woman  
  employee, and is severely reprimanded     
  by Rakesh. Naresh, and his maternal       
  uncle, instigate Shobha against Rakesh,   
  who humiliates him, and as a result Rakesh
  leaves the house. He takes up employment  
  in the far regions of Himachal Pradesh,   
  in Northern India, which includes the     
  construction of a dam. This news does     
  not auger well with the local tribesmen.
