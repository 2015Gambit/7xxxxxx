The Invaders fought the Axis Powers over the world until eventually finding themselves in England, where they met Lord James Montgomery Falsworth, the original Union Jack. He joined the team and provided them with a base of operations in England.

After the Invaders' introduction in the pages of The Avengers, the team appeared in its own try-out title, Giant-Size Invaders #1 in 1975, followed by the ongoing series The Invaders later that year, and a single annual in 1977. Issues #5-6 of the series introduced another retcon World War II team, the Liberty Legion, in two parts of a story arc, ""The Red Skull Strikes"", interlaced with another two parts in Marvel Premiere #29-30.

In 2004, a new Invaders team was created in four-issue arc ""once an Invader..."", beginning with The Avengers vol. 3, #82, written by Chuck Austen. The revived team was spun-off into its own title, The New Invaders, running 10 issues (August 2004-June 2005), beginning with issue #0.

The new team consisted of U.S. Agent (John Walker, the fifth Captain America); Union Jack; a mysterious flame-generating girl named Tara; former Liberty Legion member the Thin Man (Dr. Bruce Dickson), and the Blazing Skull (Mark Todd),

They were formed by the putative U.S. Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk - in actuality the Red Skull - who coerced the Thin Man into gathering this new team, which the Skull intended to use for his own goals. The new Invaders eventually learned of the plan, however and thwarted it, but at the cost of the apparent ""death"" of a member resulting from a betrayal. The majority of the members quit the team after this.


The 2007 twelve issue crossover series Avengers/Invaders saw the original WWII team of Captain America, Bucky, Namor, Toro and the Human Torch (leaving Spitfire and a wounded Union Jack in the past) brought to the present-day Marvel Universe by the cosmic cube, which had fallen into the hands of a villain. Upon arriving in the present-day, the Invaders battle the Thunderbolts and the Mighty Avengers, believing them to be Nazi agents. Eventually, the Invaders come to trust the Avengers teams (both Mighty and New versions) and agree to go back to where they belong.

In September 2010, Marvel launched Invaders Now, a miniseries starring Steve Rogers: Super Soldier, Captain America (Bucky), the original Human Torch, Toro, Namor the Sub-Mariner, and Spitfire. The Invaders are all reunited by Aarkus, the original Vision (along with the current Union Jack) to face a resurfaced threat from World War II.

All books mentioned above are included, I think that's everything."
