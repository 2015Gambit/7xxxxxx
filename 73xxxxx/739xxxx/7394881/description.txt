redemption in a world devastated by the undead. Players experience life changing events, 
meet new characters and familiar ones from the original comic, and also visit locations 
that foreshadow the story of Deputy Sheriff Rick Grimes. The Walking Dead offers a 
tailored game experience - player actions, choices, and decisions affect how the 
story plays out across the entire series.
