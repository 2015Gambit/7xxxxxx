THIS TORRENT WAS NOT CREATED/RIPPED BY ME!

 I just had a hard time coming across this film when I was looking for it so I'm helping it along. Please seed! I figure if you've found this then you already know what this movie is about, but just in case here is the info from IMDB:

     A "Leatherface" type murderer who wears other people's faces, kills at an all-night horrorthon at an old theatre put on by a bunch of film students. Maggie, the lead character, believes it's really Lanyard Gates, a crazed film maker who killed his family live on stage, fifteen years ago. And now he's back to kill his daughter, Sara, who is believed to be really Maggie.

     A group of teenagers preparing an old horror movie show in an abandoned theatre discover a recording made by an actual murderer who died long ago. Very soon a shadowy figure resembling the killer starts stalking them one by one.


Enjoy!                   -Red Apathy
