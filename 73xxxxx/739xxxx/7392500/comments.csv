,jaquiow,2012-07-05T21:45Z,"After you've extracted the folders, go to your main Dungeon Defenders folder, and drag both of the extracted folders into it and drop them in.

When it asks if you want to ""move and replace"" the selected items, or merge the folders with the existing ones, click yes.  And you're done."
