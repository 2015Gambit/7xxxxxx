[V],thetorrentlord,2012-06-29T16:06Z,"Just a suggestion, but if you are going to post a full season put them all in a folder(Supernatural S01.720p.HDTV.x264) and make one upload which will take you less time and make it easier on the downloaders who can then pick and choose. Thanks for the upload and long live those who post  because everyone can post something."
[V],thetorrentlord,2012-07-03T17:03Z,@rob2012: You will have to make an actual physical copy of all the files into the new folder and make one new torrent of said folder. That will require more hard drive space if you want to keep seeding the individual files that have already been uploaded.  There is nothing special required except the above. Good luck.
,rob2012,2012-07-24T21:39Z,"Thetorrentlord, I have done this you're explaining to me about 3 times, I copy all the files more subtitles for a single file, then create a torrent folder and then put all the manager, he does everything right, but when I go to the site and I do what I've done with other files that I sent it gives error. I do not know what else to do, because I had ordered a full season of spartacus and it worked. If you can help me, thank"
