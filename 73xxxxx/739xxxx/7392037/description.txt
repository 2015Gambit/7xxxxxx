This is a harmless "virus" Well actually it is a command shortcut for Windows Vista and 7.
Email it to friends and hope they open it. The command will then display a message via cmd.exe and then after 5 seconds begin to shutdown.
If you┬┤re intressed in making your own custom "virus" I have copied some links in the readme.
