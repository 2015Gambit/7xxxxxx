,MrStarz,2012-06-30T06:47Z,there isn't a 1080p version available at the moment so what yify and his team have done is try there best to upscale a normal copy to 1080p - this is never going to produce the same results but its a good enough try
,Piyeza,2012-06-30T07:12Z,"when u saw the name.yify dnt ask a/v? its always perfect put it in your little.brain, more power yify pls upload lockout in 1080p thx in advance"

,Fitzy727,2012-07-03T06:19Z,"Thanks YIFU :)

And even if it isn't as good as actual 1080p it's still free and I wouldn't waste my time downloading a 1080P movie that's 19BG!!!  +1"
,TorrentRating,2012-07-04T16:30Z,"@Fitzy727 WTF are you talking about? 1920X1040 IS ""real"" 1080p. "
,mrcrookelchueko,2012-07-04T19:05Z,thank you YIFY  for a one part complete movie.......a10 v10 m8
,damouse1,2012-07-06T02:13Z,"Quality /is/ shit, but that's good enough for many so no use complaining. However, I appreciate the idea of low sized alternatives, but the weakness of TPB search engine makes it annoying to get all these low quality releases poping up all the time. We could use a special YIFI movies section. ;P"
,chris_blake6,2012-07-06T07:26Z,"True, this is not 1080p HD, but it is excellent quality for something you're downloading and watching for FREE! Thank you to the uploader, we enjoyed the movie!

,ZOMGtorrentplz,2012-07-07T05:48Z,"Thanks YIFY... HATERS GONNA HATE! Listen fucking idiots, of course this doesn't look as ""crisp"" as the motherfucking 7.5GB version due to the compression, but the difference is very little. this will play awesome in most computers, flat screens and is neat for laptops. This is free, and is kind with your hard drive... what the fuck else do you want? The movie itself is just an hour and a half of fan service for the ones who watched AP when we where young, do you really want this to take a huge chunk out of your drive?"
