,rosso99,2012-07-07T07:15Z,"oh wait, I don't think anyone posted this yet @drunk-mon. hoowahhh! was AL PACINO "
,Zenophobe,2012-07-11T12:58Z,"De Niro sucks big greasy wop meatballs, once upon a time a person who had a discerning eye for appearing in some of the greatest movies of all time...  but it was really just luck, the guy is completely brain dead and will do any script that is sent his way.  I expect to see him next in Night of the Templars II"
,epicfrog,2012-07-17T08:11Z,"I have to say, Zenophobe, I have not been too impressed with Deniro in the past 10-12 years or so but he owns in this movie. It's a good story, based on the main character's actual life and well worth watching. Honestly, I don't know why this movie was never widely released in theaters. I give it a 9 out of 10."
,epicfrog,2012-07-17T08:13Z,"zakimar, you must have been dropped on your head repeatedly if you think this movie is shit."
,dinamocy,2012-07-21T04:26Z,"this is a de niro one man show, he did some crappy one in the past but this is not one of them, respect."
