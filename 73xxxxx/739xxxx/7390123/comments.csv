,zymy,2012-06-27T00:40Z,"First torrent I've tried to do...where is ""GRFS_1.1"" and where is the ""SKIDROW"" folder? I think the skidrow folder is the ""Tom.Clancys.Ghost.Recon.Future.Soldier.Fix-SKIDROW"" folder...but I have no idea what the GRFS_1.1 is and where it is. Thanks."
,Ravenduz,2012-06-27T08:31Z,"For all of you people, who are facing the bloody (device is hung/game freezes, green diamonds pattern shown on the screen, then crash.) problem, I was facing the same problem. I think, it's solved now: what you have to do is to raise your GPU voltage. To do that you have to install ""MSI after burner"" run the program and follow the following:

1. press setting button ( located on the right bottom corner of main program window )..

2. on the setting window, check the two boxes of both a) Unlock voltage control AND b) Unlock voltage monitoring. press ok.

3. now you can adjust the voltage of your GPU, by clicking the slider ""it's just below the Core Voltage (mV)"".

it seems that the required voltage to fix the problem is 1050 or 1100, depends on your GPU, I've seen some videos on the web showing that the default voltage would be 1025 (on gtx580), funny thing is that my GPU is also (gtx580) but for some reason its default voltage was 1065, maybe because it is overclocked, maybe it depends on the subvendor mine is Asus, anyway, I set the voltage to 1100 and so far the game is running with no ""hung"" anymore, at least it didn't happen where it was happening before.

hey, since you are tweaking already it's good to go and configure your GPU fan options, press setting again, and check the fan tab, then set the fan curve, to your desirable options, it's not a mandatory thing, but I've been reading that raising the voltage would cause the GPU to overheat, so it's better to be safe than sorry.

hope this would solve your problem, thanks uploaders for your work. but please next time try to check the games on different rigs, lately most of the cracked games are having many stability problems, but thanks again for your hard work.

Cheers. "
