[T],Spetses,2012-06-28T16:35Z,Many thanks for this as I use Real player as my default player and have searched many times for activator.once again many thanks.
,chop007,2012-06-28T16:45Z,"Awesome, awesome, awesome, bro your torrents are always 1st class. Thank you, from a poor man with empty pockets but a happy heart."
,anarchist9027,2012-06-28T18:41Z,"I trust your torrent and you are a trusted uploaded but uTorrent plus said there was a virus inside and this is the 1st time ever for a warning from uTorrent plus and I have downloaded ALOT of cracks, patches, keygens etc. I just want to be sure this is an ABSOLUTE false positive."
,kobrax,2012-06-29T19:09Z,aktivator ne radi
,The_Original_Oracle,2012-06-30T01:34Z,Please give instructions on how to use the activator.
,hstpb,2012-07-03T04:50Z,"Thanks for sharing!

Just a note that after you run an update, you'll get the message back on top of the program asking if you want to buy RealPlayer. But when you close the program, and open it again, that message is gone.

I don't know what else the activator do, but it replaces 20 DLLs on the folder 'rpplugins' under program files.

Anyway, it seems to be working ;-)"
,hstpb,2012-07-03T04:54Z,"The instructions are:
1. Right click over activator
2. Run as administrator
3. Patch

Someone told that there may be a virus on activator. I don't know. I advise everyone downloding torrents to check the files at virustotal.com"
,mightyh,2012-07-04T18:24Z,I got a virus alert (Trojan Gen) from my Avast antivirus from the activator after my download. It was automatically removed from my folder. I wonder if this is for real or just a false alert. mrriser007 has always been reliable. Any comments from anyone?
,pirate4me,2012-07-15T12:17Z,"guys, this is legit  !!
but you have to disable your antivirus program before opening the zip file.
thanks for uploading."
