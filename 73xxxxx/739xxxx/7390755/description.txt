Amateur DVD of The Tallest Man On Earth Live In Stockholm 2012, May 31st. Sound recorded with zoom h2n, video from the various vids uploaded on youtube. Some video material is from the second night and doesn't completely match up to the sound but overall I think it's pretty good. Hope you enjoy it and please seed!
