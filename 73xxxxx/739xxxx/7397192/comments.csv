v0.15.1

Released 31st May, 2012
Bug Fixes and Tweaks:
Fixed a couple of issues with the parts action UI popups and their code bindings.
Tweaked the time warp altitude limits. It is now possible to warp fast at low orbits around Minmus and the Mun.
Tweaked the rotating reference frame thresholds when nearing planets, to reduce terrain mesh jitter.
Fixed the 'Sierpinski' Terrain' issue, where the terrain mesh would break up when approaching a planet after travelling very far.
Fixed an issue with the patched conic solver failing on some escape trajectories.
Fixed the normal maps on several parts.
It is now possible to set the persistent debris budget to zero, to disable saving debris completely."
