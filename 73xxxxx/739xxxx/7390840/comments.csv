,saxman7,2012-06-28T23:14Z,My house flooded from all of the storms and my computer equipment is all under water so I won't be posting any new episodes for quite some time I think.  Hopefully someone else can pick up the task and keep everyone (including me at least till cable TV comes back online) up to date on The Factor.
,litlmike,2012-08-26T21:07Z,Bummer!  Any chance you'll be posting more Factor?
