I believe this was filmed in sometime around March or April of 2012. It premiered on TV for the first time on June 15, 2012.

It is exclusive to the YTV channel in Canada. 


I'm not a One Direction fan.. but decided to share it for all the girls and gay boys out there who are currently in love with them. :) I doubt this special has aired outside of Canada, so here it is in high quality for the world to see.

Enjoy!!
