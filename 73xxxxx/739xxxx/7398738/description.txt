Plot: Robert De Niro, Paul Dano and Julianne Moore give powerhouse performances in this compelling exploration of the unbreakable yet fragile bonds between parent and child, written and directed by Paul Weitz (About a Boy). Nick Flynn (Dano) is a young writer seeking to define himself. His father Jonathan (De Niro), however, scrapes through life on his own terms and has not seen his son in 18 years. Taking a job at a homeless shelter, Nick finds purpose in his own life and work until one night Jonathan arrives seeking a bed. To give the two of them a shot at a real future, Nick wrestles with the notion of reaching out to his dad in this “undeniably powerful” (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone) adaptation of Nick Flynn’s award-winning memoir Another Bulls-t Night in Suck City.
