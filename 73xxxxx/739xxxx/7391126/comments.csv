Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 111 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc"

,Hexin123,2012-06-28T14:35Z,"@MVC78: Look at the filename genius, ""Rock of Ages Cam 2012-devildeeds74.avi"". You could even check a sample before you gripe about the quality of the torrent. It's up, it's free, nobody lied about the quality. if you want to comment about the quality do so constructively rather than complain about something you couldn't do any better. If perfect quality is what you require, go to the theaters!!!"

It's watchable, but the sound is very poor quality. When they aren't singing - which is basically louder than the rest - it's difficult to hear what the actors are saying. God forbid they start talking in a lower tone, then it's nearly impossible to make out their words. I really hope someone will be able to record a better cam version, especially since this movie doesn't open in my country until August."
