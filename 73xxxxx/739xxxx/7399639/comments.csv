,syaugust8,2012-06-30T05:06Z,this show is so awful it's painful to watch; they should stream this and nothing but in prisons instead of letting them watch actual good stuff.  whose dick did this guy suck to get his own terrible show?  makes one wonder.

I have to agree with syaugust8, I was expecting some good stuff but Reggie Watts might be the best talent on the show."

I curse you all, I curse you with pirate curses, you incontinent assclowns. You goddamn fucking fucks. You're always fucking nay-saying. I've seen your other posts you fucking Nay-sayers. Fucking fuckers always nay-saying, every time someone tries to create something you say nay, so fuck you, you fuckers, goddamned fucktards."
