A seeder is someone who has already finished downloading and is now uploading (seeding). If you want to help, just download something and keep uploading it for others."

,Viirukkin,2012-06-27T13:55Z,"Found a solution for the ones with out of range[atm only me]:

Right click your desktop shortcut and edit the line ""Target"" by adding  -windowed after the whole line
Example: ""E:GamesSpec Ops The LineBinariesWin32SpecOpsTheLine.exe"" -windowed

Below this we can see a ""Run"" line,edit that to windowed.The game is going to open now and we can change the resolution as we please."

,delro92,2012-09-12T03:09Z,"For all of you having resolution problems, do this:
go into: ""C:Program Files (x86)2K GamesSpec Ops The LineBinariesWin32"".
Send ""SpecOpsTheLine.exe"" to the desktop (thus creating a shortcut).
Right-click on the shortcut, then select ""Properties"".
In the ""destination"" field, add ""-windowed"" (without the quotes) at the end of the string, it should look like this:

""C:Program Files (x86)2K GamesSpec Ops The LineBinariesWin32SpecOpsTheLine.exe"" -windowed

Run the shortcut, go into options, change the resolution to fit your needs.

PROFIT"
