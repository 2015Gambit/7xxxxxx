thanks for the file But i must be doing something wrong?? the keygen keeps getting flaged by nortons and utorrent.. any help please

Thank you"
,spiderr,2012-07-04T10:41Z,"Keygens and cracks are often flagged as virii because... well... they technically are doing something you'd find sketchy! If a keygen reads your registry and spits out a key based on that info, most AV freak out that it's reading the registry. Anyway, if you have doubts then install things like sandboxie and run it in a sandbox and delete the box after."
