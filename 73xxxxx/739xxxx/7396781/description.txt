Ascending to Infinity is the first studio album by the Italian symphonic power metal band Luca Turilli's Rhapsody, created by Luca Turilli after his departure from Rhapsody of Fire. It was released in June 22, 2012 via Nuclear Blast.

Unlike Luca Turilli and Luca Turilli's Dreamquest, Luca Turilli's Rhapody is considered as a real part of Rhapsody of Fire, and Ascending to Infinity is referred as "Rhapsody's 11th album", following all previous Rhapsody of Fire albums. It is the only album to feature Alex Holzwarth on drums, as currently he is only a member of Rhapsody of Fire.
