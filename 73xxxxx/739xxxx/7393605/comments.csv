,temp1992,2012-06-28T09:53Z,"Hey tr108,
what program/settings do you use to rip your movies that retain all the iTunes meta data info like movie info, producer, ratings (R icon in iTunes)??"
[T],tr108,2012-06-28T21:02Z,"@lilsean23 - thanks for having my back. I really appreciate that.

@temp1992 - I input the metadata myself (manually) with an app called Subler, it's freeware but Mac-only. If you're on Windows, try MetaX (not free, however)."

Any chance we might see Donnie Darko or the Bourne Trilogy down the pipeline?"

[T],tr108,2012-07-02T20:56Z,"@jegator - yes, Bourne trilogy in early August, before the latest one is in theaters. No Donnie Darko tho, sorry."
