Materials from humanistic sources to build modern spirituality without dogma, religious ethnocentric bias and supernaturalism.

Philosophy, radical non-dualism ontology, ethics, metaphysics, science, spirituality and mysticism all in service of Reason and common sense.

Also containing bits of re-interpretation of old age spirituality.

"And of all illumination which human reason can give, none is comparable to the discovery of what we are, our nature, our obligations, what happiness we are capable of, and what are the means of attaining it."
