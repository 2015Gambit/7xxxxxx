[T],Auge,2012-06-29T07:18Z,"I spend a lot of time making these rips, I use a lot of my bandwidth to provide these rips, I spent over a decade collecting these films and I spent about eight years perfecting ripping them.

A lot of my torrents get completed between 100 and 170 times (between Demonoid and The Pirate Bay).

I get three or four of the same folks saying thank you (and I do appreciate it), but what I would like more is people talking about the film. I have yet to watch all of these (at the moment I have over 2800 discs), and I would love to talk about them if you are interested. If I post one I have not watched, I would still like your opinion of it so that I may bump it up in my “to be watched” list.

I may have had unrealistic hopes of a “community”, but I would like to get something out of this other than a decent ratio . . . I don’t have to provide anything of my own to get that.

I have not been posting the last two weeks as I was collecting nearly 40 titles for a buddy (yes, I am talking about you Mick) who I met on the Pirate Bay, most of these titles I did not have before he asked if I could get them . . . we have been mailing a portable hard drive back and forth . . . and we actually talk about films and the people who make them.

In the last two weeks I found three discs that have took me years to find: Criterions two disc set of Rebecca, the three disc set for the 5 hour version of Until the End of the World and Being Human starring Robin Williams . . . none of these were downloaded, I found the actual discs. I don’t know how I feel about just tossing them up and getting a small handful of folks saying thank you.

Perhaps I am being bitchy, just thought I would share what’s on my mind."

,Waikiki2008,2012-06-29T08:35Z,"I downloaded a few months ago, the full Criterion Disc 1 of Spartacus and although it is still only marginally seeded, you can try it here: http://www.demonoid.ph/files/details/2903805/8496475/. The uploader mentioned the possible uploading of Disc 2 soon. Good luck and welcome back."
,baybeh,2012-06-29T09:23Z,"Hello Auge, welcome back! I had been waiting for you to return so I could post this link for you as well as for all of us who've happily become a fraternity here. This is a 13 part documentary series about the early history of cinema. http://www.openculture.com/2012/06/ihollywoodi_epic_documentary_chronicles_the_early_history_of_cinema.html
Hope you folks like it."
[T],Auge,2012-06-29T09:33Z,"Wakiki,
I'm actually downloading that one, its just going so slowly. its over half way done so I will be patient. I already have disc #2."
[T],Auge,2012-06-29T09:39Z,"Baybeh,
I screened the first few minutes of episode 2, thanks for the link... I will watch the entire series at work.
Very cool, thanks."
[T],Auge,2012-06-29T09:45Z,"Baybah,
I forgot to mention that I started prepping Naked for you, I will post the 2 disc Criterion set next week."
,baybeh,2012-06-29T10:17Z,Thank you so much Auge! Really happy that you're back :)
,russell1nash,2012-06-29T14:07Z,"Being bitchy is an uploader's prerogative! ;) Esp one who uploads quality stuff such as yourself. 
But, in fact, u r not bitchy at all. U r right. On the other hand, not even on private trackers one can find reviews and movie comments/discussions in abundance. 

So, that being said, i can warmly recommend this Gilliam to any1 who did not watch it yet. I would actually venture to say that, after/aside from Brazil, which remains Gilliam's masterpiece, and the Monty Python (related) movies, which i find brilliant, this is his best. Moreover, tho equally subjective, I would say that ""Time Bandits"" is certainly better then Gilliam's films of the last decade. 

In any case, THANX for your uploads and know that your work is, in fact, appreciated!"
,Scratzz,2012-06-29T17:08Z,"@Auge: This is the first I'm downloading from you. But I appreciate that it is untouched full DVD-DL.
I always upload untouched originals (Lindoffs) noting more or nothing less. I'm a collector myself and has about 6500 movies at the moment. 
Like you and ""russel1nash"" I'm also looking for a community to talk about movies and directors. I think this is the wrong forum for that, but I'm still looking. 
I finish with a thanks for this upload, and I know how much work it's behind...

[T],Auge,2012-06-30T08:31Z,"russell1nash,

Oh man, I don’t think I can agree with you about this being his best film (but as you said it’s subjective) my favorites are Brazil, The Fisher King and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. 

However we are in agreement when you say that his last decade is his weakest work with Tideland being his best work in the last decade, it is my opinion that the world could have done without The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and The Brothers Grimm. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus garnered whatever acclaims it had riding on the coattails of Heath Ledger’s death and amazing performance in The Dark Night."
[T],Auge,2012-06-30T08:33Z,"loxos,

Sorry, I cannot provide something that was not included on the disc."

Is this one of the early Criterions where it is presented as a letterbox inside of a 4:3 black matte?  "

:))"
,Waikiki2008,2012-06-30T20:42Z,"Did you mention Criterion's two disc set of Rebecca? At your leisure, could you please release that rare treasure."
[T],Auge,2012-06-30T21:59Z,"Waikiki2008,
Yes, I do have the Criterion's two disc set of Rebecca and I am considering posting it . . . I just need to sit with it a while."
[T],Auge,2012-06-30T22:13Z,"Waikiki2008,
It took me years to find it; eventually I had to visit and call DVD rental places all over Seattle and after finding it I had to plop down a $200 deposit."
,Waikiki2008,2012-07-01T09:47Z,"Very rare and very expensive. That was why it was on my first email wishlist to you. I will try to be patient, even though, having just turned 60, it is not in my nature to do so. Many thanks to both you and Nick for all you two have done for the community. "
