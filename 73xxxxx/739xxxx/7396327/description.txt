For some reason it seemed impossible to find this triple album in mp3 format. All I could find was crappy .wma compilations so I took the FLAC release (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4447325/The_Magnetic_Fields_-_69_Love_Songs_Box_Set_%5BFLAC%5D) here in PB and converted it. Credit goes to original uploader of FLAC release, I merely converted and uploaded it.

The Magnetic Fields - 69 Love Songs
Volume One
Volume Two
Volume Three

MP3 - 44.1 kHz - 320 kbps


I will seed for some time, but please keep it alive! Also, my upload speed is crappy (not my fault, it┬┤s like that in this country), but if you are patient you┬┤ll eventually get it! Enjoy!
