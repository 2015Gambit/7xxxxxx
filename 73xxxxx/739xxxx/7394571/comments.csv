Antiracism is just a codeword for anti-white.

Steven Seagal = Antiwhite"
,Fritz.,2012-06-29T15:58Z,"steven seagal... he made a couple cool movies in the 80s because it was the 80s and people did not have the internet yet and were like OMG WHAT IS THAT CRAZY ASS KUNG FU... then went on to make dozens of terrible movies that failed until he was so broke that he tried to make a low budget reality cop show... except he was such a terrible cop in real life that the show failed too... and now he makes movies that go straight to the discount rack of the dvd section and will never be played on tv, ever.

@Mister22

,mjc489,2012-07-07T16:05Z,"Perfect quality.  The movie was better than I thought. If you like action and don't need much of a plot, this might work for you."
,vulcan59444,2012-07-07T23:44Z,"The reason many cannot find on IMDB is that ""Soldier of Vengeance"" is the UK title.
US title is ""Maximum Conviction"".
