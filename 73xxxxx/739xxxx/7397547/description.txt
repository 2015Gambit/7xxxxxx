DIGIMON TAMERS MOVIES + EXTRAS

The only English versions that I could find of the 5th and 6th Digimon movies (3rd and 4th in America) were very low quality TV rips.

So, I've used the (decent) audio from them and edited it together with the higher quality video from the Japanese versions I found.

There are only a very few blink-and-you-miss-them quirks on account of the fact that editing around all of the cuts that had been made to the American release was difficult. Overall, I think this is the best version currently available.

I've left in the Japanese-language end credits for the first movie. Adding in the American ones wouldn't have worked well on account of TV announcements, and their overall style, I think, adds on well to the last scene.

The first movie in the Japanese version included a long (and beautiful) montage of Takato, Kai, and Guilmon spending time around the island.
Unfortunately, leaving this in would not have worked on account of differing audio shifts. I've left this scene as a separate extra.
Originally, it took place right between Rika and Renamon's first battle and Kai, Takato, and the digimon eating some fish.

For the second movie's end credits, again, audio overlaps didn't allow for a clean attachment. Also, the final scene concludes with a sorrowful and satisfying tone that I at least think would completely clash with the ensuing happy pop from the Japanese version. I've left these credits in as an extra, though.
