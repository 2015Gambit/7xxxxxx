,Conan_513,2012-06-29T16:41Z,"Character sync between servers has comming soon!

I'm working on a character sync system and it's under testing now.
In the next few days I release the open beta version.

Don't worry the servers save to offline first and the characters data syncing with a global database. So if you changing server, you can continue playing with your character from the previous server.

But first I need to find a 24/7 MySQL server. "
,toaster23,2012-06-29T21:42Z,"hey conan,

global hive data was exactly what i was looking for, after testing your great cracked version. thumbs up on an internet-enabled version of the dayz server. i really dislike the official policy on this.

anyway, if i can help you in any way to achieve the goal, tell me. i have access to various root servers and a mysql is no problem.

only problem i see: how to get in contact. i dont wanna post any real contact data here.

hope to here from you and be of some help

However there is one issue, the vehicles don't seem to be spawning (Or at least I haven't seen one) But the reset vehicles and the view vehicles lists off some of them, any ideas?"
