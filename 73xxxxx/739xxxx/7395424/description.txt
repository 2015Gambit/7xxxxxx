Very likely the first stereo recording of this classic American work, this Boston Pops performance was recorded in 1954 and released (with Copland's "El Salon Mexico") as a mono LP in 1955. RCA released a "Stereo-Orthophonic" two-track tape of  the Grofe performance around the same time (ECS-17). The original Boston Pops performance under Fiedler was never issued in stereo either on LP or CD and was supplanted by another performance recorded some years later. This is a transfer of the original two-track tape from 1955 that has been in my collection for three decades or so. The mono Red Seal is a sought-after vinyl collectible and this performance is about as good as they come. Highly recommended.
