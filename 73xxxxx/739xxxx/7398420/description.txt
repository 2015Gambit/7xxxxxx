Power Pack is noteworthy for being the first team of preteen superheroes in the Marvel Universe and the first in comics to operate without adult supervision. The series was one of the first mainstream Marvel hits supplied through the then-developing direct market, with regular sales estimated in the range of 90ΓÇô97,000 per month[1] ΓÇö considered above average sales for the time. The title retains a cult following and in 2005 was relaunched as a title aimed at younger readers (see below) ΓÇö though this was eventually declared a separate continuity from that of the original series.
