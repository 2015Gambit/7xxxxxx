only seems to happen for certain mkvs and mp4 conversions..

I dont notice these until I watch myself fully
Im not sure how to fix the issue but obviously its a bug in the coding or converters

I will experiment with other converters to see if they do the same

take it or leave it i guess"
,locks04,2012-06-28T06:33Z,ay man i didnt even see what you were talkin about quality looked fine to me people cant really complain if they aren't doin the hard work just like you said take it or leave it and ill be takin it 
[V],psspss,2012-06-28T08:45Z,"my haters tick -1 regardless if its good

but in the last segment the video corrupts on the
grass at bottom. you will notice it. it happens 4 times and last 1 sec each


Im using another non free video converter now
so far seems good no corruptions on videos watched today or converted today"
