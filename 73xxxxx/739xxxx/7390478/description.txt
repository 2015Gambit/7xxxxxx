Extreme - III Sides To Every Story - "Don't Leave Me Alone"
Only released on cassette version, 1992

This track was released only on the 1992 cassette version of "III Sides To Every Story".  You won't find this anywhere on CD.  I apologize for the 128kbps quality, but I ripped this many years ago and no longer own the cassette.  It's a powerful piece about abandonment and one of the group's masterpieces, in my opinion.  Enjoy.
