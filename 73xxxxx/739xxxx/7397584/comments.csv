,zombird,2012-07-02T10:30Z,"One of the most addicting games, or simulations, ever. Essentially you build a rocket or space shuttle from scratch, and see how high you can get. There's other objectives as well, going into orbit and landing on the moon. There's something about the trial and error of this that is really fun. Finding out what builds work, making tweaks to try to get even higher.

Note: When you're testing the craft, I find that if you have the camera on the earth at certain angles, it lags ALOT. I don't know if this is just me, my specs are more than enough for this. It doesn't seem like a very graphically intensive game. All my graphic settings on the game are set to the lowest. Might just be the game. Still alot of fun.

This version has alot of additions over the demo available on their website. Thank you very much for the upload, cheers."
,FastForwarder,2012-07-04T03:08Z,Is there are any hope you can upload the updated 0.15.2?
,honza97,2012-07-09T09:13Z,"THANK YOU VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY MUCH!!! I was finding this torrent since 0.14 was released. But I agree with @FastForwarder. 0.15.2 is necessary  to use some new mods ( for example http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=13774.0 ). 

PS. Sorry for my english. It isn't my native language :)"
