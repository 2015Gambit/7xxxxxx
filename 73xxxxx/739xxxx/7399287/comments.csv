,locks04,2012-06-30T06:36Z,mannnn ive been waiting for this good ish man at almost 20 gigs the quality has to be amazing thanks man 
,[Silvers],2012-06-30T10:46Z,"@Daman4Iife

20 GB for the complete season1 ??
Well ok maybe the video is better but some of
us don't care about pixel details...

I'm going to stick to individual downloads from
your torents, the complete season takes no more
than 2.5GB.."
,voidelo,2012-07-01T21:54Z,"@Daman4Iife! Seriously! WTF man...

,tylerjorden,2012-07-01T22:41Z,please seed
,Link-sama,2012-07-01T23:58Z,@Daman4Iife Would you like to share why 7/10? I'm just curious... I really like the series.. 9.5/10... and thanks for every episode man. You are awesome!
,locks04,2012-07-02T00:51Z,lol i would advise that for you then if you think its too much space thats probably why he made the only season complete 1080 because he already uploaded 720p more space more quality i could already tell the difference as soon as it started if your tv isnt  hd1080p then yea this is useless to u or if you dont care about pixels use ur brain man people complain even when stuff is free and on someone else's time and resources once again thanks man for this upload I appreciate it 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-02T02:04Z,"Reminder, Do not Download if you are on a single Core PC or else if it will Freeze and play at random FPS due to CPu. 
Best Played through a PS3/Xbox or a Dual Core or Higher PC"
,CombustionMan1,2012-07-06T17:15Z,Is there any way you can compress it like your other 720p uploads?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-07-06T18:10Z,Not possible  if i do it will look just like any 720p torrent.
,jsniper34,2012-07-09T00:11Z,"This is BRILLIANT!  By far the best quality ever!  I downloaded all of your 720p torrents of LoK but this is really impressive, tyvm for the 1080p version!

Everyone download and seed, it is extremely worth it, best quality, no ads.

A/V: 10/10, perfect!

,asbolina,2012-07-18T09:36Z,"The good:

- Picture quality is correct, there is no obvious blocking artifacts. But considering the huge bitrate, this is expected.

- The source has been debanded. Not enough in some scenes, but it's still better than most other releases.

The bad:

- There is no small detail in this show so 1080p is completely useless. The upscale could have be done with a more sophisticated upscaler to take advantage of a heavy offline processing but this is not the case. You can see low-resolution aliasing everywhere. 720 lines would have been more than enough, actually there isn't even detail loss at half resolution (540 lines).

The ugly:

- Original animation framerate is 23.976 fps, not 29.97. Doing half the IVTC process results in jerky motion everywhere, it's a real shame.

Conclusion:

Considering the huge amount of data and the relatively poor quality, I would recommend to save your bandwidth & disk space and stick to a decent 720p stream."

,Rulonegger,2012-07-24T20:30Z,"A/V 10/10, there's a great difference between 720p and 1080p. Download!!!!"
