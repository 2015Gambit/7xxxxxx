,special_ed_420,2012-07-05T03:30Z,"isn't there usually a dual audio track?? just saying usually in vlc you can change the audio track cause most UL load the english version AND their own language so instaed of spazing out online and making yourself sound like a racist prick, download it and see if you can change it."

,CerealKilla84,2012-07-05T19:12Z,"Call me crazy, but I just went out and actually BOUGHT A TICKET to see this brilliant film at the movie theatre.. No Regrets!! It turns out it's enough to tide meover until I can download a decent copy. Anyway my point is, instead of slamming this no doubt decent enough albeit foreign dub, go pay $16 (or whatever) to see it on the big screen. Sheesh!"

,obvious2me,2012-07-06T10:26Z,"Lmao @ xSirPirate

You mean that ""DVDRip"" of the movie that just hit theatres... probably the one with 13k seed, 2k leech, less than 10 comments, and a mere hour or two old was a fake?

Bahahahahaha."
,91758595,2012-07-06T11:42Z,"I  don't care that it's Hindi dubbed, but I do wish it was at least English subbed, someone get this video to the Japanese, they can fix anything "
,xSirPirate,2012-07-06T12:14Z,lawl i clearly stated it was fake and i downloaded there was no rar or avi :L it had 13k seeders i didnt think it was realy and as i said *TEST* i never said it was completely legit please keep that in mind next time :)
,shagfro,2012-07-06T20:10Z,Its funny how people bitch about a bootleg copy of a movie it says Hindi dubbed and I dl'it knowingly read the title. We're all breaking the law yet complaining about the quality. Go see the damn movie at the theater like i did after watching the bootleg. I wanted to know what they're saying
,srishti18,2012-07-06T21:22Z,"Fucking Retards can't read that its a CAMRIP, its written in the info that the language is HINDI.
Fucking Morons don't know that it was released FIRST in INDIA on 29th June 2012 and yet they have to go about commenting bullshit.

READ the info first then download. :|
there's no limit to the number of idiots our planet has been sustaining. :-/ there should be."
,xSirPirate,2012-07-07T06:39Z,i know it was released in india first but the point is that its now the 7th in australia and relased on the 3rd :/ im going to see it tonight and try and get a better copy!
,xSirPirate,2012-07-07T14:46Z,I went to See it best movie should see it its worth it! but of course not many would like to but we arent gonna see an english copy for a bit considering they wouldent let me take my phone or cameras in -_- so its up to someone to get us an english copy but Much better in the 3D :D
,shagfro,2012-07-07T19:12Z,I didnt understand what they were saying as i dont know hindi so i did we all should do and pay to  see it 
,cazgrl,2012-07-08T11:47Z,"haha i'm thankful there are other sane people on here , too.  basically if you're complaining about this in any way shape or form, you're a moron.  the end.  there are just too many reasons.  THANKS AGAIN HDVIDEOS FOR THIS...like a ton of other people on here in comments//i too am really enjoying re-watching this after seeing it in theaters, so to you annoying ass troll complainers seriously get a life and get off the internet you are so ridiculous!"
