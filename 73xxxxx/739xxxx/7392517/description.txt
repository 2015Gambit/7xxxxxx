Well-armed men make a midnight search through the McDeere house while the family hides. Jump back a few weeks: Tammy has a new job, with a frisky boss access to Noble Insurance computer files, Abby suspects that a student's father is abusing him, and a priest asks Mitch to defend a young Latin woman accused of kidnapping an infant.
