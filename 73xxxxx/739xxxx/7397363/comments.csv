I cannot believe that this idiot actually went on Face Off as a consultant! His work is shit! Has anyone even looked at his IMDB profile?!?!? 15 year gaps in his resume and his most notable work was on 1985's Ghoulies! LOL And even then he was simply listed as ""additional ghoulie operator""! Loser."
,tittopi,2012-06-30T11:47Z,"PS: the insult was about ""monster man""

because his claim of working on Ed Wood, Nightmare on Elmstreet, and Starship Troopers cannot be verified by any source. "
