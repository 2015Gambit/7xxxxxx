Fake lol Xbox sucks anyway! pc is the way to go!"
,kyocasey,2012-06-27T03:32Z,You need a Jtag/RGH to play this DLC. I assure you it is not fake.
,2222lil,2012-06-27T03:59Z,"The ""DLC"" is only 500kb so it is fake. Don't bother downloading"
,Smallz94,2012-06-27T04:34Z,i wish i have j-tag :( 
,GoodTunes,2012-06-27T04:36Z,"It's a virus. Someone ban this fucking idiot, as well as the 52 idiots who have downloaded it or are in the process of doing so."
,MrSinclair,2012-06-27T05:13Z,"Sorry to burst your bubbles, but Dawnguard is only about 600 mb. It only adds as much content as a well made mod: A few extra locations, one set of armor, the new vampire mesh, two types of crossbow, the new horse and the new shout."
,SonnySN,2012-06-27T05:46Z,so... is this the real deal? 
,thezig,2012-06-27T06:05Z,"Assuming that this expansion is done like the expansions in their other games, wouldn't it be possible to extract the files and plug them into the PC version?"
,Atticus999,2012-06-27T06:37Z,"Your a bunch of idiots. kyocasey I downloaded it and placed it in that location - when I load it it tells me that some content with the saved game is no longer available soooooo I don't think it loads it. If it loads it successfully are we suppose to see a different load screen or anything to see if it actually did load it? Thanks for the upload man, ignore the haters. "
,Atticus999,2012-06-27T06:49Z,"When I fire up the game it says it's loading the downloadable content but when I actually load my saved game it says: ""This save relies on content that is no longer available - continue with load?"" "
,kyocasey,2012-06-27T07:12Z,"@Atticus999

There wont be a different load screen, but on the main menu there is an ""ADD-ONS"" sub-menu and Dawnguard will appear in there.

I would also suggest getting the latest title update, which is TU7 and can be downloaded here - http://marketplace.jqe360.com/getfile.php?file=44928

Title updates go in:

/Content/000000000000000/425307E6/000B0000

I also get that message while loading, im not sure why though."
,kyocasey,2012-06-27T07:22Z,"I think i figured it out.
I just put TU6 in there with TU7, then loaded my game and didnt get that message.
Get TU6 here - 
http://marketplace.jqe360.com/getfile.php?file=44964

Give that a try."
,Atticus999,2012-06-27T07:43Z,"Okay, thanks :) I'm downloading those updates now and will give it a whirl. Let you know how it turns out :) "
,Atticus999,2012-06-27T07:56Z,Making progress :) Add-ons is showing now on the title screen and when I select it it shows Dawnguard so do I just continue my game and go to a specific part of the map to start that portion of the game? I tried to select the Dawnguard add-in and launch it from there but it won't let me select it... Maybe I need to download 1-5 too?
,Atticus999,2012-06-27T08:11Z,Hrm for some reason it didn't load my last comment :( I see the add-on now. Do I just hit continue and it's suppose to load it? When I look in my skills I hear there's suippose to be a werewolf skill but it's not listed :( I don't think it's working
,Atticus999,2012-06-27T08:16Z,"Oh snap! I got it to work! Sooo you have to install those two updats just like kyocasey suggested, then when you load the game continue your old game and then travel to riften and talk to the guard right to your left and it starts the dawnguard process :) Thank you SOOOO much kycasey!! You are freaken awesome"
,Stradisap,2012-06-27T08:20Z,"@MrSinclair 2 new landmasses, 2 new town like areas, 4 dungeons, new radiant questline (8-10 hours for one side of the conflict) 1 mount, about 20 -25 weapons, 4 sets of armor, 10 misc objectives - Fixed your bullshit. "
,Raymend,2012-06-27T08:53Z,So you need a Jtag for this to work ? or no..
,Raymend,2012-06-27T09:05Z,Can this be done with out a jtag xbox ? with the method you guys are doing or is it not possible? Please help! & also do you rehash dawnguard to your account ?
,Raymend,2012-06-27T09:59Z,Everytime I inject the file (Dawnguard) onto my usb then put it into my xbox it says marketplace content is damage/corrupted I put all the title updates as well they worked fine !  Can any one help me at this point ? I'm really desperate for this dlc it looks great ! ( I have no jtag btw)
,Atticus999,2012-06-27T10:52Z,"Of course you have to have a JTAG! When you normally download a game from microsoft they link your game to your gamertag and you can only run it with that tag... I played this game for hours tonight (I'm exhausted) so I can confirm this works :) Thank you soooo much kyocasey I was anxiously awaiting for someone to post this! Have a JTAG, update your software to the last 2 versions (see kyocasey's links to get them) and then visit the guard in rifton to activate the expansion..... man I might have to call in tomorros so I can play some more...

,StJimmy2000,2012-06-27T11:22Z,does this work on computer?
,StJimmy2000,2012-06-27T11:23Z,does this work on the computer?
,Firoz0143,2012-06-27T16:28Z,Can U Please Upload AVATAR Game For XBOX 360 PAL Please....
,Stradisap,2012-06-27T17:03Z,"@StJimmy2000 it does not. If somebody could convert DDX files to DDS and xbox nif. to pc type...then it could work on a pc. But I doubt anyone knows how to do it. I only know that DDX is essentialy two DDS with a ddx header straped on, and the xbox reads it backwards. "
,kyocasey,2012-06-27T17:29Z,"YES! You DO NEED a Jtag or RGH to use this DLC.

Im not sure if you can use it on PC, i know of people porting all sorts of things back and forth from PC to Xbox.

To activate the DLC, you just have to talk to any guard at any major city. And the Dawnguard quest will be added.

Glad to see Atticus999 got it working."
,ericohgb,2012-06-27T18:17Z,"Thanks, kyocasey.
Some people are saying I need the TU6 and TU7 on the same folder. 
Is that it?
How would it be possible if the files have the same name? 
My Media-Id is 34F5B6C3 and the file is tu00000002_00000000."
,kyocasey,2012-06-27T18:44Z,"@ericohgb

Yes it is possible, because the TU's themselves have different names. Also different media ID's.

TU6 - tu00000004_00000000
ID^ - 49A1477A
TU7 - tu00000002_00000000
ID^ - 34F5B6C3"
,ericohgb,2012-06-27T20:10Z,"@kyocasey

Thanks.
Since my media ID is 34F5B6C3 I just need the TU7, right? The TU6 for another media-ID will not work if I did undertand correctly."
,kyocasey,2012-06-27T21:08Z,"@ericohgb

I do not know the full details of what each TU contains, but i would recommend using both of them in the 000B0000 folder."
,a1423,2012-06-27T21:12Z,"Installation:
1-see what media ID you have.
2-download TU 7 for you media ID.
done!
@kyocasey
first of all thanks and here is why I think you needed both you probably have media id: 49A1477A
and you installed TU 7 with media id:34F5B6C3
so it didn't even get loaded but when you installed TU 6 with media id:49A1477A
it loaded TU 6 with dawnguard
so dawnguard works with tu 6 ""or"" tu 7 with the correct media id.
you should try downloading TU 7 for media id:49A1477A
and delete TU 6 and see if it works with the TU 7 that has your correct media id.
this is just what I ""think""
see my reply to ericohgb to know why I think so.

@ericohgb
yes I have media id:34F5B6C3
and I just downloaded TU 7 for that media id and it worked! :)
and I do not have TU 6 :)
Thanks again  kyocasey"
,a1423,2012-06-27T21:19Z,thanks
,a1423,2012-06-27T21:23Z,why can't I see my comment

@kyocasey

Thanks for the help."
,haidaboy,2012-06-27T21:39Z,"@ Stradisap (and others with similar questions)

Changing the DDX file to DDS is a pain.  People do know how to do it, but it has to be done individually to each and every DDX file.  The process involves changing the header, reversing the byte order, a zlib type compression, and some other stuff.  You are looking at a major project to say the least.

Don't even think of asking me to try to convert them.  I'm not sure I have the expertise, and I KNOW I don't have the time."
,Stradisap,2012-06-27T23:19Z,"Yeah I know. Tried to hex it. Real pain. A team of dedicated people with much more knowledge on the subject than me, could do it. But I think that nobody will even try, or complete it before the pc release. "

Thanks so much for the tip, I was crashing every time and spent a lot of time playing with updates.
