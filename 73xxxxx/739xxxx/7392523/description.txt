- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  Multi-Platinum band Everclear return with their eight new album, and their
  first in six years, Invisible Stars. Frontman Art Alexakis says Invisible
  Stars is a record that wanted to be made, as opposed to a record that I wanted
  to make. This is a collection of songs that wouldn't leave me alone. They are
  full of melody, big guitars, sarcasm, humor and a firm eye on the light at the
  end of the tunnel, walking the line between sounding like a classic Everclear
  album of the late 1990's and a contemporary rock record. This is a record I
  have been waiting to make my whole life. The album boasts 12 exciting new
  tracks, from album opener Tiger In A Burning tree, to Be Careful What You Ask
  For to Santa Ana Wind through to the end with Promenade. Invisible Stars is a
  thematic collection of songs from the perspective of someone who has ridden
  the rollercoaster, and has got back in line. Everclear, like its charismatic
  front man, has grown up a bit, and at the same time, Everclear (again, like
  Art) refuses to grow up and play nice.
