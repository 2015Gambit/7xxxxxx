,sin__eater2,2012-06-29T08:11Z,"Your very welcome sir! I'm guessing your one of the 13 good guys.

400 leeches? Bunch of savages."
,LCSINpatria,2012-06-29T11:30Z,"holy sh!+ no kidding 400 leech and only 5 seeds, thats insane, prper reading order, great work, now time for more smashing pumpkins Im guessing"
,cmhenslin,2012-06-29T14:40Z,Could it be because nobody can get a completed download?  Seems that way with all your posts.  I only get .1 Kbs and I'm guessing everyone else is getting that as well.  At this rate it's going to take me 2 years to download.
,22bullets,2012-06-29T14:42Z,I've been downloading it for the past 9 hours... but my seeds always say 0 (###). I guess I'm not cool enough for seeds... :(
,joscheezy,2012-06-29T14:51Z,"nice upload, thanks, ive been only getting the core crossover and planned on finding the tie-ins afterwards, but now i dont have to do so much work...ill seed as much as i can."
,22bullets,2012-06-29T16:59Z,"Okay, new plan. I'll use your current list to download the comics separately. Then I'll compile them.

Considering how horrible the seed/leech ratio is, I probably won't upload it on thepiratebay... I'll find some other way to distribute it.

Thanks for uploading though."
,WinslowLeechSwan,2012-06-29T20:28Z,"No offense, I've had my upload wide open, I never throttle it because that's not the point.  I've been at 63.5% for 2 hours now, and the speed of the torrent is like painting a wall one drop at a time.

In short, I will not be that leecher for long, it's just taking a LONG time to get there. "
,wingzerox11,2012-06-30T00:31Z,"im at 69% with a 2.1 ration, it's ridiculous if you have the download completed please seed it"
,wingzerox11,2012-07-02T04:07Z,ok it took a while to get some seeds but thanks guys

,Snake-Baiter,2012-08-21T03:03Z,"Thanks.  I think I already read all of these.  Demonoid is fucked though, and I can't remember.  Does anyone know a better place than TPB to get comics?  I can find nothing on Google."
,Laereus,2012-08-30T01:27Z,"Sweet baby progay jesus!!!
