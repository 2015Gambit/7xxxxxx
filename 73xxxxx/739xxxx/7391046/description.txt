I speak English and know how to use Google, so I edited the PDF and translated it to English for myself, and figured that I could help you English non es-pan-ole speakers by uploading my translation. The images aren't translated, but the text and visual cues should help all but the most dense of us :) 

Also the formatting isn't "spot on" (the lines don't follow a margin, etc), however I figured this wasn't an essay, it's a howto. 


Anyway, enjoy you guys, big ups to the original uploader and all the seeders, and thanks for all the fish.
