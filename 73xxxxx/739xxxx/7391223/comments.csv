,FishBagel,2012-06-28T03:19Z,"@Speedybird1234

,FishBagel,2012-06-28T03:24Z,Well at my current download rate it'll be 14 years until it finishes downloading
,Speedybird1234,2012-06-28T03:31Z,"@Fishbagel
Sweet. Sorry i realised my seeding had stopped before. The internet company was doing some repairs so my internet was turned off. Its back up again."
,Speedybird1234,2012-06-28T03:31Z,What's you % at the moment?
,nguyendqh,2012-06-28T04:19Z,"I'm at 89% right now. Also got stuck at 80% for like...ever.
Getting a steady 3 to 5/kb on download right now.
Seeding at about 120-150/kb.

Hoping others might seed if they're done d/ling the file.

Thanks."
,Speedybird1234,2012-06-28T06:52Z,Sweet. Hope your download finishes soon :) I've seeded about 9gb so far.
,nguyendqh,2012-06-28T08:44Z,"I can't believe there's 150 seeders now. I was downloading this all day with about 8 seeders.
And now that I'm done, there's 150 lol.

Anyway for anyone wondering it's 12 episodes but 10 files because
1+2 is one file and 11+12 is one file."
,Speedybird1234,2012-06-28T09:11Z,"Lol, hope you enjoy it. Let me know what you guys think of the quality :)"
,Deciweak,2012-06-29T02:12Z,"Video 10/10
Audio 10/10
Highly recommended."

,Ambi98,2012-07-21T13:59Z,"I'm new to this so please help! :(

Seed this for me now please? Or how does this work? Just help!"
,Ambi98,2012-07-21T14:02Z,Please could someone explain seeding to me? How do I get this torrent to download because the download status is on 0.1%? Please help and seed!!! :(
,Ambi98,2012-07-21T14:42Z,Please seed this now brother bears. Would much appreciate it xxx :) 
,Ambi98,2012-07-21T19:15Z,"So I started downloading this 5 hours and 42 minutes ago and guess what? I'm only on 2.7% so in the last 6 hours I downloaded 3% of the twelve files.

I'm really not happy now... Damn :("
,mike18xx2,2012-07-22T05:45Z,"1) these are TV-rips with TV logos.
2) at 29.96fps, these are not properly de-telecined."
,mike18xx2,2012-07-22T05:46Z,"* These are TV-rips with TV logos.
* At 30fps, these are not properly de-telecined."
,Ambi98,2012-07-22T14:36Z,Please seed if you wouldn't mind 
,AvtrKorra,2012-07-26T20:54Z,"This is simply a collection of the better torrents already available. Episodes 1 & 2 are one file just like Episodes 11 & 12. The sound and picture are 10 & 10, but they come with watermarks and bottom bars (won't be on the DVD release).

Thanks for the upload. This is a great package to get if you've decided to watch the series. But you'd do just as well picking out all the 720p offerings if seeding stops."
,yolandy,2012-08-12T01:05Z,"please seed, it says its gonna take a day to download. please seed !!!"
,darkscale,2012-09-02T17:55Z,"@ambi: I don't know what client you are using, but find in the options/preferences menu the part that has to do with queuing and set your max number of torrents to about 3 and your max number of downloads to about 2. This will speed up your transfer. The seeding goal should be at least 100% so that yo can give back to everyone once you have done downloading (also, some clients offer a ratio so the more you give, the faster you get.) Under the Bandwidth settings you choose what your system can handle (depending on if you have dial-up, DSL, Cable, etc.) Upload is normally slower than download, and if you are on a home network with other people then keep your downloads slower as well. You can usually get away with a setting of 180 Kb/s - 350 Kb/s down on DSL. On my 4G box I can go as high as 1.2Mb/s. ""0"" usually means ""as fast as possible."""
