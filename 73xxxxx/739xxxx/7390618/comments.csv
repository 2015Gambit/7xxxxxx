,RafVne2,2012-07-03T09:22Z,"@polacogaleto

If you would have just read couple of posts above yours you wouldn't have a problem , now would you?
Nobody is asking you to reaed 150 posts like main download has, but to glimpse at the most recent ones... come on...
Don't forget to block renderer.exe!!! I finished the game before this update, but I'll try it.. sort of as a ""community service"". :)"
,RafVne2,2012-07-03T19:54Z,"Soooo.... I've ran,I've watched, I've checked... and....[Drum roll]......
It works...It also seemed to improve cutscenes , but only by little, they are still ctackling and delayed... it sees they may have pushed the harware into overdrive, cauz' my fan was going crazy (my fan gets quite loud too when overclocked that's how I noticed.)

So... no promlems with update,nor crack... don't really know what it fixed, but that's another topic...."
,Nemstar,2012-07-04T05:21Z,"I've installed the game..twice now. and followed the instructions.
full install..copied the profile folder (both places) performed the updates, cpopied the crack. and turned off the internet.
at first i was getting a social club ui failed to initialize, but i fiddled abit, think i installed some updates from the .iso and i got passed that, but now, not matter whan i do i get stuck on ""loading"" after hitting enter..

anyone have any ideas?"
,polacogaleto,2012-07-04T06:17Z,"@RafVne2 today, the game detect new version 1.0.0.29, i am block all exe's files related, then it need to create a new patch for this new version!!!! i am open the game and it say ""license corrupted!!!!!"
,polacogaleto,2012-07-04T06:19Z,@RafVne2 i am block files using windows 7  native firewall!!!
,RafVne2,2012-07-04T12:46Z,"Stuck at loading happened to me when I removed Profile from social club, I would check there.

@
Who knows when skidrow will release 0.29 crack, what I would do... I,m not sure if you have to do a clean install from the scrach or not (I think you do), but just give it a shot with running update 0.28 again block 3 files.... no... fuck it... unplug your ethernet cable.... BE AT LEAST SURE THAT ISN""T AN ISSUE. Do not allow install of update 0.29 since there is no yet. I hate saying stuff that should be logical... Remove the profile folder That is definitely changing... later you'll be able to add back your game files... ONLY!!!... yes it will have saves...once social club gets a whiff of cracked stuff, you'll have to repeat the procedd.... Good luck..."
,polacogaleto,2012-07-05T04:07Z,"@RafVne2 i am run playmaxpayne3.exe, it show updater screen and relate ""there is a new necessary update ..bla bla""!!!! i am blocked playmaxpayne3.exe, maxpayne3.exe and renderer.exe using windows 7 firewall!!!! i am setting the blocks in advanced settings in windows firewall!!!!"

,Tyreneous,2012-09-09T22:03Z,"Now correct me if I'm wrong.. I have been a black beard for quite some time and am fairly knowledgeable on computers and software and comodo detects a viral infection in the gsrld.dll file in the .28, .29, .49, and .55 updates I've downloaded thus far.. however it did not detect a virus in the .22 update that I also have... how is it that the .22 does not show up as positive yet the others do? I have read reports of people's computers going into lock down and the files phoning home to all these random IP addresses... I see that you have the ""trusted"" symbol.. what does this exactly mean? Trusted by who's standards? does this mean that everything you post is tested and scanned by you? and that it does not contain anything bad like a virus? just find it funny how the other updates are infected and .22 isn't....
