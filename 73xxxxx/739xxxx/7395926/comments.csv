,bleslie1,2012-06-29T11:26Z,"I was just thinking the same thing... I rewatched it earlier and I noticed that something definitely happened in the bed before Hope came in. And Liam looks a little roughed up, but then again, I don't know... Steffy still looked very put together. And she did hit that water pretty hard on Wednesday's show. Not sure if a barely developed fetus could survive that even if she was pregnant... 

If she is though, I think it would make a great storyline if she somehow ends up sleeping with Bill again and is clueless as to which one is the father.

On a sidenote, I'm actually really liking this lesbian storyline. It's very refreshing. Thanks for making it possible for us to speculate Msfenmore! :)"
