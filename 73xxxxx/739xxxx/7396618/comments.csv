I touch ok and the game it's closing
Help us out bone!!
And why I dont find the game in gameloft or playstore?????"
,ro_ja08,2012-06-29T22:14Z,"This is what i did on my galaxy note.

DL this torrent and install the .apk on your phone. 

1. DL the sd file on the link given on the Read me file which is included on this torrent.

2. unzip or unrar the file which will have a file name of 
""com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftAMHM.rar"".

3. you will now get a file called ""main.108.com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftAMHM.obb""

4. on that file, Right click on it and click ""open with""... then look for the winrar.exe or winzip.exe. if you can't find then browse your program files.

5. Extract. After extracting copy all the files to "" sd/android/data/com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftAMHM/files/""

Then it should work."

http://ufile.eu/ofhkvrdubb1o#
scroll to last there u will find a download link, click on it. it asks for login for higher downloading files. Log in with your Facebook account and again reload the page. after login then click on the download which is in green box. Tried with firefox, so we can resume the download and continue. My net speed is slow @ 25kbps download :(
Comment if it works for you..."
