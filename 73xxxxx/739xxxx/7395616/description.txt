Now, fresh out of rehab, Jeff is armed with new hilarious comedic material and a burning desire to make it big again, the right way. Aspiring stand-up comic Jeff finds that his insecurities and addictions may sink his chances of hitting the big time, but emerges from rehab with a fresh outlook on life that could finally help to make his dreams of stardom come true.
