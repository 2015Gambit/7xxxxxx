It is VERY IMPORTANT to BLOCK this program from 'phoning home' with your FIREWALL settings!  If you don't you will soon get a ""sorry"" message and they will lock the program from further use... not good.

BLOCK these addresses ""for all programs"":
66.96.132.1 thru 66.96.132.255
In both ""Inbound and Outbound"" rules. 

THANK YOU, mrriser007!  RUM FOR YOU!
