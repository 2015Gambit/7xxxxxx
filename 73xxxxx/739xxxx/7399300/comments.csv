,Keithioa,2012-09-12T03:52Z,"Hey everyone,

I can get everything working perfectly if I'm OFFLINE, but the moment I go online a popup comes up and I'm asked to register an ID and can't use the program anymore.

I've used this
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7191990/ADOBE_TOOL_v2.1_%5Bthethingy%5D
to clean up and manage my host files but to no avail.

While offline, my order of procedure goes
1. Activate the serial with the keygen provided and go through that entire process.
2. Use the Adobe tool in the link above to clean up my host files.
3. Run the disable_activation program.
4. Go back online hoping everything works fine only to be blocked by that registration popup.

Please any help? My lady needs this for school and we just don't have the money to fork out the full copy."
,5toir1,2012-09-13T08:42Z,What's The serial number???
,MegaArmin,2012-09-18T22:13Z,"After installing thins went very well.
Regarding the keygen I had to paste the generated serial which I used under the installation, then I pasted Request code.. I got the Auth code :)

But after reboot I'm not able to access ANY of installed Adobe CS programs. Shortcuts from my Startmenu disappeard, and when tray to run directly from Programfile/Adobe I got an error telling me that Windows cannot access spesific path og file.. blabla...

Any suggestions, someone ?"
