Edsger Wybe Dijkstra was one of the most influential members of computing science's founding generation. Among the domains in which his scientific contributions are fundamental are

    algorithm design
    programming languages
    program design
    operating systems
    distributed processing
    formal specification and verification
    design of mathematical arguments 

In addition, Dijkstra was intensely interested in teaching, and in the relationships between academic computing science and the software industry.

During his forty-plus years as a computing scientist, which included positions in both academia and industry, Dijkstra's contributions brought him many prizes and awards, including computing science's highest honor, the ACM Turing Award.
