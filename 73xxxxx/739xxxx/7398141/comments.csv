,sonans,2012-06-29T18:03Z,What about the Director's Cut?
,shabbamanuk,2012-06-30T04:15Z,"at last,thank you.....took about 8years to release this,was edited soooooo many times.good movie but a bit of a mess."
,rayzoredge,2012-06-30T05:26Z,"Thanx, Hackulus."
,killermany,2012-06-30T13:58Z,"Is that movie good to watch?

,guidoanselmi,2012-06-30T15:51Z,"Watched the theatrical version last night (which I found messy but brilliant) and am anxious to see the Director's Cut, which is 36 minutes longer and may explain a LOT of holes left in the plot (like a pregnancy!). This comes out official in about a week in DVD and Blu-Ray with both cuts of the film, but apparently will be distributed only by Amazon and Netflix and Blockbuster will not get it. If anyone has the high-def Director's Cut, PLEASE put it up!"
,guidoanselmi,2012-06-30T15:58Z,"Anyone got the Director's Cut,  about 40 minutes longer and may plug a lot of holes in the 129 minute cut. High-res would be nice too ... Amazon has sole distribution of the movie, so it won't be available through Netflix, Blockbuster or Redbox, etc."

,shabbamanuk,2012-07-02T07:48Z,"thanks...watched it again and this film is a fucking mess..on cd2 at around 15.45,anna paqiun looks straight into the camera."
,sonans,2012-07-03T17:23Z,@dfl3506 The movie was notoriously in post-production hell. It was shot in 2005.
,AnimalLeopard,2012-07-05T10:02Z,thanks a lot!

For myself personally is was a train-wreck, convoluted story, horrible acting I didn't even care what happened at the end so I turned it off. "
,pluxi,2012-07-28T02:07Z,@Rush It must suck for you to be turned off by things so easily.
