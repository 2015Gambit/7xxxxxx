Hi, I used the Prometheus.2012.CAM.NEW.V2.FIXED.XviD-XTREME as the source, but then hard-coded the English subs underneath the video.  The arabic subs are still there, but with the English subs as well, at least now, you can make out what they're saying since the audio is crap.

Oh, and I encoded to H.264, 768 bitrate using WinFF.
