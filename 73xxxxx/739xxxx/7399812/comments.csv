I saw them dozens of times. In Greensboro, NC my college roomate and I saw a general admission show and stood right in front of Jerry on the floor.  We didn't move an inch during the entire show...well, our heads got moved.  More than once Jerry was starring right at me and it felt like the whole place melted away...

He was such a unique human being and musician.  There will never be another like him.

I hadn't seen this in years and it put a big smile on my face to see them getting in the groove.

Enjoy...."
