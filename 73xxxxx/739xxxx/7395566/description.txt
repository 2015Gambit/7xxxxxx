Hi,

These indie playlists are meant for people (like me) who hate (or have no time) going through the various Indie playlists (among others) every month. Running a bar I do this every month trying to find something nice (and new) for the customers. I usually end up with three lists.

 @1. Nice, clear and easy for people who like to talk while listening.
 @2. A bit louder for people who are not able to talk anymore (too crowded).
 @3. The ones I like myself and do not fit in one of the above categories.

Plus:

 @S. Special, usually dedicated to one artist.

Only the best (sounding) tracks are selected. They are in 100% clean and fully labelled MP3 VBR format. This might save you some time.... Enjoy and keep the Indie spirit high.
