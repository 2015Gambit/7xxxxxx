,babis_gr,2012-06-28T23:09Z,which diablo is this?no 1???or diablo 3?
,Semblance,2012-06-29T05:46Z,This is Diablo 1.
,axinte,2012-07-01T10:58Z,"I got tired of fake cracks and I looked for an alternative.

I found this http://www.drakensang.com/?&aid=3546&invID=xbdebbdbjdjxcdebjjijixbaajfecxibgxbgdhxbaa

It is a great game, and is free, even more, it can be played in a browser.

It cooled my thirst of killing monsters.
I played for a month with my old graphic card, and the refresh was kind of slow, and I decided to get a new card. I HAD A BIG SURPRISE. tHE GAME IT IS 3D. it has a great scenery, especially in north with those waterfalls or blizzards. I suppose that diablo is 3d too, since it has the same hardware requirements.

Anyway, drakensang is a very good alternative for diablo. Maybe is better. I will know in a year when diablo will be cracked.

I would liked to pay for diablo, blizard has done good job and deserve to be payed, I promised that after I played for free diablo 1 and two, I will pay for the third, but the price is not affordable for me. It matches my income for a month. I can afford to get hungry for a month reducing with a third my expenses, but I cannot afford to postpone my bills. "

,Semblance,2012-07-02T07:05Z,I thought as much. Lol.
,Amelia23,2012-09-09T07:40Z,Quick Question( At Least semi quick)- I'm a full on Newbie. Quick learner just want to make sure I do this right. I have Daemon Tools. Can anyone be patient( and kind) enough to explain- in as much detail as can be provided- the steps in opening Diablo in Daemon tools? I want to make sure I get this opened correctly. Much appreciated! Thanks!
,Semblance,2012-09-09T15:31Z,"Open Daemon Tools and click the ""Add images"" button, then find the Diablo ISO and open it. When it is in Daemon Tools, right-click on it and click ""Mount image"" and select which virtual drive to mount it on (if you have more than one set up).
The game autorun should now start, or you can open it in windows explorer like a normal CD."
