Active as a composer and keyboard player, Linas Rim┼ía is credited with blazing the trail for acid jazz and crossover projects in Lithuania. His gripping projects often involve the remakes of Lithuanian ethnic music, jazz standards, popular opera arias and works by contemporary classical composers. Trained as a classical composer, he remains open to various kinds of music, ranging from songs for Eurovision Song Contest or children TV show to symphonic music. His diverse engagements also include music for theatre and film, and collaborations with video artists. On top of that, he has been active as an arranger and producer of pop music albums. Making his debut on Lithuanian jazz scene in 2001, Rim┼ía introduced new stylistic trends that have not yet taken root locally. With special fondness for iconoclasm, border crossing, fusion of the seemingly incompatible elements and searching for the unifying key to musical diversity, he has produced a series of strikingly refreshing projects, including the Acid of Spring, Standard Life, Opera in da House, Sutartin─ùs Party, Die Welt ist Traum(a), Guerrilla Jazz.lt, Intimacy, Old Faith.
