Australia Land of Parrots
Parrots and cockatoos are the most conspicuous birds in Australia. They're everywhere, and often in large numbers. From the dense rainforests of the tropical north to the cold, wind-swept coast of Southern Australia and the arid deserts of the interior, every region is inhabited by parrots. "Australia: Land of Parrots" explores the diverse & spectacular life of parrots & cockatoos across the varied landscapes of the island continent. Inhospitable forces of nature-cyclones, drought, flood & fire- shape their life as do humans who unwittingly offer food & water in abundance. "Cockies" are stunningly colourful, unbelievably adaptable, and surprisingly smart and their antics will amaze you.
