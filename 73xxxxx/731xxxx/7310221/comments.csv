,contatnt1one,2012-05-30T03:57Z,"mdsanjay, I'm trying to put together a complete warlord of mars (dynamite version), but there seem to be gaps. I currently have 1-12, and 14-17. The Dejah Thoris series is also currently out there but not complete. I was wondering if you had any of the issues that could fill in the gaps to the existing torrents or however youd want to do it. As always, thanks providing excellent content."
