,Killswitch1991,2012-05-31T08:06Z,"I'm seeding it right now.

I can assure you, this is the real deal."
,primacron,2012-05-31T11:29Z,"Part of me wants to berate you for this. You had to have been trusted with an advanced copy from the band like I was, right? And you violated a direct bond of trust between you and the guys by immediately turning around and pirating it. While I'm not against piracy, it does upset me that before the band has even had a chance to make money on their effort, you've undercut their sales by making it available for free before it even releases. And I know for a fact that Burton is against piracy. It's a goddamned shame you'd go against his wishes like that. I can't say I'm much better, but I'm supporting them.

Legit torrent? Yes.
In this case, ethically correct? Not in the least.

Album? solid 10/10, this is what FF was meant to be. It's amazing. Just remember to support the band any way you can if you don't end up buying this album: go to a show, buy their merch, something to make up for their losses on this album. FF is one of the last bastions of truly original music, especially in the metal scene. Let's not sink the ship before it's time, guys..."
,primacron,2012-05-31T11:42Z,"Alright, let me rephrase this, then, since you deleted my original, inoffensive comment:

Killswitch1991: You're a piece of shit and I hope no other musician trusts you with their work ever again. You could have at least waited until midnight on the 6th of June. To at least give them a CHANCE to compete with all the fuckheads who see piracy as a way of not spending money instead of an ethical try-before-you-buy method. 

But regardless, you're a fucking cocksucker for violating Fear Factory's very obviously misplaced trust in you. Jackass."
,Anritsu,2012-05-31T14:31Z,"@ Primacron  . Although I agree with you in general , have you ever considered  that ""the fuckheads who see piracy as a way of not spending money"" may actually be people that can't afford to buy cd's , merch and stuff like that . And don't blame piracy  for poor sales , even record labels have backed up on this argument . Those who are fans will buy the FF stuff . Others , like me , wouldn't buy  the cd for several reasons  , no matter if the torrent came out or not . I have a few ff cds , saw them  live  in Athens 2 years ago  but now   I have other priorities  . Just my opinion"
,Killswitch1991,2012-05-31T14:36Z,"Ha, like I ever had the connections to the band to get an advance copy. Cry more dude, this was long available online when I found it."
,Killswitch1991,2012-05-31T14:39Z,@Primacron You're a cocksucker for jumping to conclusions like an idiot. :D
,warmonger3,2012-05-31T15:40Z,"Its leaked, its all over mp3 sites right now."
,primacron,2012-05-31T16:39Z,"@everyone in general:
So yes, I did jump to conclusions and I apologize for such. I didn't 'scour the web' searching for a leak of the album out of respect for these guys. I've seen them live three times, one of which was a couple of weeks ago, and knew I had a copy being given to me by Burton himself when he felt the time was right. You don't need ""connections"". Did you ever maybe try just communicating with him online? His facebook and twitter are both authenticated: it's really him. And for the record I do indeed know what it's like to be someone who wouldn't otherwise buy an album if it weren't available online because I'm not exactly what you'd call 'financially stable' at any given point in time. Then again, I don't make a habit of amassing such a collection of pirated music that it's nigh impossible to say that I own a shred of legitimately purchased music, like most of the people who use TPB to get music. And generally, even if it's just the change I have left in my bank account, unless a release is absolutely terrible, I make some kind of effort to support the musicians I steal music from. 
Also, while piracy doesn't affect the recording industry at large, it DOES affect bands who have to pony up most or all of the money that is spent in the recording, packaging, and promotional processes. Devin Townsend is a great example of that, but then again he leaked his two most recent albums 2 months ahead of time intentionally, so take that as what you will.

Overall my point was moot, and I got irritated because when it comes to artists who have been making an effort for decades now, who express a desire NOT to have their music distributed for free without their permission (as FF has in the past), to fly the flag right in front of their face like this is just flat disrespectful and in poor taste. I don't think I'm better than anyone, I just think this band, moreso than most nowadays, deserves what money they can get; especially since most of that money no longer comes from album sales, which means even more work on their behalf to sell merch and tickets. It's only fair to them for giving their ideals to the world, you know?"
,jaimidian,2012-05-31T16:56Z,its generally a pirate site...there's going to be pirated items on here...why you so shocked ? lol thankyou killswitch m/
,Swining,2012-05-31T17:04Z,"Primacron, you're a brown-nosing piece of shit. Keep ranting on THE PIRATE BAY with paragraphs of thick pig shit nobody wants to hear."
,Swining,2012-05-31T17:06Z,"""and knew I had a copy being given to me by Burton himself when he felt the time was right.""

Record company's call dipshit. Next you're going to tell me music videos, lame photoshoots and touring in small shitty venues was Burtons call as well?"
,Swining,2012-05-31T17:08Z,"""Killswitch1991: You're a piece of shit and I hope no other musician trusts you with their work ever again.""

Oh yes! Lest you download the album and listen to it anyways! "
,Killswitch1991,2012-05-31T17:41Z,"@Primacron

I will give you one thing. I don't just download shit with no intention of buying it. I am a ""try before you buy"" person. I completely intend on buying the album on Tuesday when it actually releases, and I should have the money to buy some merch. 

My main issue is that I dont like buying CDs before I know if their any good because you can't return opened CDs. If it sucks, I'm shit outta luck and even FF has released a couple of stinkers. 

I have over $3000 sunk into my cd collection, and as I make money, I'll continue to by more as I find some I like. "
,primacron,2012-06-01T23:58Z,"@Killswitch1991

See, I can respect someone who takes that approach more than I can someone who sees torrenting as the end-all-be-all way to acquire music because it's free. Those kind of people are irresponsible and don't deserve to use the service. I've already apologized and retracted my statement. 

@Swining
They're record label is Oxidizer, Inc. in conjunction with Candlelight Records, dipshit. As in they own the rights to their own music. So when he tells me himself that he's going to send me a copy of the record when it gets closer to release time, it's actually his fucking decision. Music videos and photoshoots? probably not his idea. The actual need and decision to tour constantly to make a profit because the current recording industry model is broken and no longer generates enough money for most bands to sit on their asses and draw a fat royalty check? Yeah, I'm pretty sure the guys in the band decide to do that. Touring has nothing to do with a fucking record deal anymore, dumbass. The band funds their own tours because most labels don't provide touring funds and booking to bands as part of a contract unless they're sure they've got someone like these fucking MTV whores and shit who are guaranteed to make them twice as much money as they invest. Learn how the fucking industry works before you start trying to talk shit about a business model you don't understand."
