    Three-Rayed Sun

The sun suspended in heaven by three powers, perhaps the Triple Goddess who
gave birth to it (see Three-Way Motifs)

    Corn Dolly

An embodiment of the harvest to be set in the center of the harvest dance, or fed
to the cattle to "make them thrive year round" (see Secular-Sacred Objects)

    Tongue

In Asia, the extended tongue was a sign of life-force, as the tongue between the lips imitated the sacred lingam-yoni: male within female genital. Sticking out the tongue is still a polite sign of greeting in northern India and Tibet (see Body Parts)

    Cosmic Egg

In ancient times the primeval universe-or the Great Mother-took the form of
an egg. It carried all numbers and letters within an ellipse, to show that everything is contained within one form at the beginning (see Round and Oval Motifs)
