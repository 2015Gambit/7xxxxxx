,eddf01,2012-06-01T10:23Z,"Thnx.

Would like to ask for the new and upgraded AP packs like AP26, updated 2-tone horn sound pack, class 421/423 sound pack, class 40 and class 50 sound pack pro. If one could share any of these that would be great!"

We will not do mainstream piracy of either IHH or AP addons.
These are small companies which earn their livelihood making  RW addons only so i belive its better that we support them :)
