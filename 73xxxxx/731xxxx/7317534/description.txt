Men like lists. No, not the shopping lists that women make. Men like lists that tell them what they want to know: What are the highest mountains ever climbed? The most venomous snakes? The most valuable comic books? The most common first names of Playboy Playmates? The countries with the highest (male) life expectancy?

 This entertaining follow-up to the best-selling Top 10 of Everything presents over 250 top-ten lists whose themes run the gamut from the speediest cars, to the hottest chilies, to the bestselling beers on the planet. Some lists are totally off the wall: the most popular pizza toppings, the mammals with the highest sperm counts, the female celebrities most often Googled. Films, crime, food, drink, music, babes, war: Top 10 for Men gives you the info you need to be the most interesting and entertaining guy around.
