Extract the ZIP file, run the keygen in the first folder. (MAKE SURE TO DISABLE THE ANTI-VIRUS OR THE KEYGEN WILL BE DELETED. IT HAS BEEN REGISTERED AS A FALSE POSITIVE.)

Next, start the setup.exe or whatever its called in the setup folder. no need to run these programs as admin unless you are a limited user without admin privledges. after install, turn OFF your internet, start Photoshop CS2, and it will ask you to activate. this is the fun part. Choose other activation options and activate by phone. (this option will ONLY be available if you turned off the internet) the keygen will "give" the phone representative's code and it will validate every time you install it. do not register the product or try to update it as there are no updates for the product you are installing because its so old. Trying to update this will probably INVALIDATE it, so don't bother.
