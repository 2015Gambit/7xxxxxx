,nuke998,2012-06-01T06:13Z,"Thanks so much

a couple of slightly blurry pages and pages missing edges, but I couldn't wait any longer and this is awesome!"
,1eyedsage,2012-06-01T17:26Z,"If you liked it please support the series!

,Bevinsky,2012-06-01T19:20Z,"This is close to unreadable. Some of the text bubbles can't be read at all. What did you do, use a camera?"
,1eyedsage,2012-06-01T22:16Z,Definitely has blurry text on the tops of some pages; there were only a few that I couldn't decipher and the context pretty much filled it in.
,APPLEjucie554,2012-06-02T09:04Z,"i only torrented this because i couldnt wait to read it, i have already pre ordered this on amazon and cant wait to put it up in my comic collection, also please support this series by buying it if you ever want more avatar the last air bender story comics/books in the future."
,sareia,2012-06-02T11:44Z,This is eye cancer.  Guess I'll stick with my Amazon preorder.

,nuke998,2012-06-06T03:14Z,"@jj441
Open it with WinRAR"
,fnadde42,2012-06-11T20:40Z,Nice job. A little minus is that some pages were blurry but it was readable.
,rekuplex,2012-06-12T08:55Z,great torrent! tyvm!
,rekuplex,2012-06-12T09:53Z,"blurry but readable, give you 4.5 of 5 tyvm"
[T],MrDowntown,2012-07-01T17:31Z,"I just got around to reading this... and couldnt, Pages crooked, grainy, blurry... I appreciate the attempt but seriously!?"
,xhizors,2012-07-05T18:29Z,"@MrDowntown: Agreed.

Honestly, is it too hard to scan things properly? Too lazy to try to scan a page a second time, if it's nothing but blur? I'm not usually ungrateful, but how incredibly lazy..."
,xhizors,2012-07-05T19:00Z,"Literally, on one of the pages the over half of the top panel is cut off."
,Gygorer,2012-08-01T12:30Z,"These ones aren't terrible, but some pages are blurry and unreadable. There's another torrent on PirateBay that has much better quality. I recommend you look for that one if you're picky, like me. "
,nanogold,2012-08-03T03:51Z,"Eh. Thank you for trying, but the entire second half, top half of the pages are too blurry to read. "
