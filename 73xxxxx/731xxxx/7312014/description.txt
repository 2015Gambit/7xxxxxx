Storyline::

They say that matches are made in heaven. 
This is one of those films where they are 
undone in heaven! But then again, that's 
the strange thing about love: just when 
the worst has happened, the best happens 
almost like the nightmare never took place,
 almost like love is undeniable, almost like
 love and hope are two faces of the same coin.
 Nandini (Gul Panag) fell in love once and then
 life happened--shattering every belief that she 
had about love. And then, just as she was ready 
to give up on love, she fell in love, all over 
again! Hysterical, intelligent, honest, Fatso is
 all about love packaged in with a calorie count!
