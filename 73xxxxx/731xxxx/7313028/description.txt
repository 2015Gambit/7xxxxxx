     They say that matches are made in          
     heaven. This is one of those films         
     where they are undone in heaven!           
     But then again, that's the strange         
     thing about love: just when the worst      
     has happened, the best happens almost      
     like the nightmare never took place,       
     almost like love is undeniable, almost     
     like love and hope are two faces of        
     the same coin. Nandini (Gul Panag)         
     fell in love once and then life            
     happened--shattering every belief that     
     she had about love. And then, just as      
     she was ready to give up on love, she      
     fell in love, all over again!
