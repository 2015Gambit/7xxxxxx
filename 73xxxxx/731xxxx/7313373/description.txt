..: DESCRiPTiON :..

BluffTitler DX9 is a program that titles and wipes 3D images.

Animations are built out of layers that can be animated
independently. The current version of BluffTitler supports 8
different layer types: camera, light, text, picture, video,
plasma, particle and audio. Layers can be connected to each other
for special effects.

The following 2 aspects make BluffTitler truly easy to use:

BluffTitler works completely in realtime: you immediately see the
final result of your actions!

BluffTitler uses a minimalistic intuitive user interface that does
not try to impress with dozens of windows, tabs and dialogs.
Instead, thanks to clever GUI design and AI techniques, it only
features 2 windows: the edit window and the render window. You are
guaranteed not to get lost in BluffTitler!
