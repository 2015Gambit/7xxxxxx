Animated Stories from the New Testament is a video series produced by Nest Family Entertainment in association with Rich Animation Studios. Unlike other animated series based on Bible stories, these programs are not based on modern characters interacting with Biblical figures, but rather provide dramatic retelling of the Bible stories themselves. The series was created to be a non-denominational informative and educational tool to help parents, caregivers, and educators instill positive spiritual values and character traits to those in their care.


The series was directed by Richard Rich, the ex-Disney director who also directed The Swan Princess trilogy, and other animated educational programs such as the Animated Hero Classics and the K10C: KidsΓÇÖ Ten Commandments.
