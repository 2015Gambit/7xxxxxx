Yes, I skipped over the Ray Sharkey episode which was the first from 1981,
because the video quality was terrible so I won't save it. Fortunately I saw it before. Ray's episode was easily one of the worst of the 6th Season.

This one with Karen Black is one of the funniest and it's the next one in order.
It was also the first show with Eddie Murphy as a full cast member.
