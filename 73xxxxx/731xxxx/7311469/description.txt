Thank you for downloading this Ultimate AIM-Professionals mod vers. 2.2

Unzip it to:  steamsteamappscommonjabia

The 2.2 release have many new configs files.
The style is again very hard, you get alot of enemy and they are bad, very bad.
Enemy soldiers have now back their eastern weapons and their uniforms.
I have test played this now for 2 days and it is great when using the FOW on. 
(enemy is not seen if you really dont see them)
New formula was invented in perceptions file. Now you see them long distances.
But be aware they see also you after the shit hits the fans (enemy alerted doubles their sight)

This version has a new music set. I hope you love it as much as I do.
I have now released 3 music packs all in all, so now we have many to play while playing the game.

This patch works with old savegames.


Happy Hunting !
