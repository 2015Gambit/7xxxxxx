,rickybernier,2012-06-03T03:30Z,take it down
,garryowen78,2012-06-03T08:27Z,"I have to agere with rickbernier, I think it would be better to take this down now. 

Anyone who particularly wants to see this video will have found a way of seeing it by now. Users of bestgore.com apparently identified the killer, which is obviously a good thing. But I don't think you should wait for the victim's relatives to plead with people to stop spreading this video. 

Piratebay is the best site out there in my opinion, and comes under enough pressure as it is. So best not to attract unwelcome attention to the site with this video.

,eranw,2012-06-03T11:48Z,i agree take the vid down
,mastermalloy,2012-06-03T18:23Z,Take this shit down NOW! The Pirate Bay is the best of all file sharing sites. Don't give them a headache like this. Please forget how many seeders you have and just do the right thing. Please. This is horrible and can seriously damage someone's psyche.
,snakeboy69,2012-06-04T09:28Z,"Don't take it down.

Nobody's forcing anyone to download it and the ""Freedom to share"" (what we all whine about here all the time) goes both ways.

You can't demand YOUR right to share stuff if you want to restrict others to only share what YOU approve of.  That's a double standard, plain and simple."

""You can't demand YOUR right to share stuff if you want to restrict others to only share what YOU approve of.""

So you're saying you approve of this video, and you want it to spread? No, of course you don't. And neither does any Piratebay user in their right mind. 

So your point about double standards is totally false. This doesn't fall into the normal categories of videos some people approve of and others don't. 

In any case, I'm not so concerned about the morality of it. I'm more concerned about protecting Piratebay, a site that I respect and highly value. It shouldn't be a platform for attention-seeking killers, and we shouldn't give any governments more reason than they already have to attack Piratebay. "
,monacelli,2012-06-04T15:00Z,"""Take it down.. after I download and watch it first."" is what people are really saying in this thread."
,hooverje44,2012-06-04T19:08Z,"Yes we need to remove this video from here and everywhere someone would look for it, but of course those doing so will make no effort to remove the hundreds of spam links that will be posted as this video from idiots who should be killed like the poor bastard in this video for wasting the time of millions of people and then righteously claiming they are right to do so because we are looking for a video they don't think we should be allowed to see.

Fuck them and anyone who agrees with them. "
,posast,2012-06-04T19:31Z,"Not a real video of murder actually, but real butchering and necrofilia, disgusted me.
 The boy is very sick."
,garryowen78,2012-06-04T19:48Z,"As the uploader, johntory, doesn't seem interested in taking part in this conversation, it seems somewhat futile to continue debating this.

If anyone thinks this torrent should be removed from Piratebay (there are plenty of other places where it can be found, I just don't want to see it here for the above reasons), then PLEASE CONTACT THE SITE ADMINISTRATORS and ask for it to be removed.

Use the ""contact us"" link below. "
,dabller,2012-06-04T20:24Z,"Video a bit graphic, but it was funny in the end when Magnotta jacked himself with the Chinese's guy dismembered arm. Guess he wanted a happy ending to his movie lol"
,hooverje44,2012-06-04T20:40Z,"I used the ""contact us"" link to post the following:

I support KEEPING the torrent for the murder video made by now captured killer Luka Rocco Magnotta.

Do not give in to the censors! No walls either. Keep it easy to access. Millions are looking for it, let them find it instead of the thousands of fakes that are going to be posted to waste everyone's time. "
,kultment,2012-06-04T23:12Z,"Please, don't watch this insane video and take it down."
,kultment,2012-06-04T23:24Z,"Please, don't watch this video and don't seed. "
,HLFH,2012-06-05T16:40Z,"La police de Montréal a insisté sur la volonté de ses services de poursuivre les hébergeurs qui ont permis la diffusion de la vidéo du meurtre dont le Canadien est accusé.

Tant pis pour vous !"
,djshellshocker,2012-06-05T20:44Z,"Keep this torrent up and seed.

Censorship is gay. "
,bonzofan,2012-06-06T03:23Z,"""I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it""-Voltaire

This shouldn't be taken down just because some people are offended. There is a bigger picture, and I think that TPB needs to stay neutral in moral arguments. "
,missJiaLi,2012-06-06T04:57Z,"I was going to voice my support behind leaving it be, and say the only thing i'd be furiously behind, in terms of  removing, would be child porn.....EVEN after watching it.(since i'm an anti-censorship/regulation libertarian) But as i type this, i realize i'd hate for my mother to know a video of her child being murdered, is all over the net for people to gleefully watch/get-off to. So while i WON'T go nutso here for johntory to be punished or anything, or how bad gore is, and blah blah blah like others are, if i was the owner of TPB, i'd remove this....SOLEY out of respect for the family."
,missJiaLi,2012-06-06T05:04Z,"God knows, when i said ""even after watching it"", i meant THIS video.....not child porn.  Gees lol
I know some un-original people are going to post shit like ""suuuuure you did"" blah blah blah, but it was an honest mistake in sentence structuring on my part. *sigh*



Now i know people might also say ""Well gee, if you watched it, why isn't it okay for others to watch it""


I'm not arguing against the moral issue of the videos content/gore. I'm saying if it was MY site it would be gone SOLELY out of respect for the family. I however, will NOT view TPB owner in any bad light, if he disagrees with me. I just mean I PERSONALLY wouldn't have it on out of respect, after seeing the brutality, and knowing how my own family would feel having such a video of ME being promoted. "

,Ballin_yo,2012-06-08T04:30Z,"There's worse shit then this on piratebay, quit bitchin"
,extracube,2012-06-09T11:52Z,"@posast, how can you say this isn't murder when in fact the victim moved around a lot in the early part of video?

Nonetheless, despite my comments on the other available torrent on TPB, about how horribly graphic this is, I have to say DON'T take it down."
,stemcelled,2012-06-15T22:36Z,"I am always interested in banned material, since I DO NOT agree with censorship. However, their are certain degrees of censorship I do believe in. Immediately after viewing this , I STOPPED SEEDING. Anyone with a consious would and should not seed this. A teacher let his high school students vote (22-3) in favor of watching this in class. WTF was that moron thinking? fired? YES. 
 Yes, stop censorship, but think first. Criminal acts of this magnitude (especially by those seeking criminal fame) should be censored, as public court transcripts will reveal facts in a far less brutal way. Watching this brutality isn't anyones right and to some degree its supporting this criminals demented desire to be internationally famous for his sickness. "
,jason9910,2012-06-19T05:20Z,Curiosity satiated....got half way through the arm getting hacked off...no need to see more. I hope he rots in hell.
,Nuner420,2012-06-22T01:39Z,"After reading allot about this and watching some youtube reactions me and my friend both downloaded it off here and attempted to watch it while on the phone.. I made it to the stabbing at about 1 min in and had to turn it off and delete it from my computer... I dont know how anyone could watch this or promote this.. It literally makes me sick to my stomach,"
,Scientography,2012-07-14T20:57Z,Luka's theme song is called True Faith by New Order.  At least the psycho has good taste in music.
,Scientography,2012-07-14T23:16Z,"The only thing here more offensive than a psychotic necrophiliac are the bunch of whining crybabies saying ""take it down, please take it down.""  How dare you make judgements about what others should be allowed to watch after YOU went looking for snuff.  Piratebay stands for freedom of expression, even if the subject matter is offensive and immoral.  What he did was bad, but he is in prison now, and all the fame in the world won't change that.  "
