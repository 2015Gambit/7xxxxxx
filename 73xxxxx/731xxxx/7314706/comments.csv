,mentallyours,2012-05-31T08:55Z,"The Miami Heat defeated the Boston Celtics 115-111 in overtime in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals Wednesday at AmericanAirlines Arena.

The Heat hold a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.

Miami was able to withstand a performance for the ages from Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo, who finished with a career-high 44 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds. Heat forward LeBron James led the Heat with 34 points and 10 rebounds.

The Heat rallied from a 15-point, first-half deficit behind a strong third quarter. The Celtics then sent the game into overtime with a 3-pointer from guard Ray Allen with 34.3 seconds that tied it at 99. Miami had two chances to win in regulation, but James missed a layup and fadeaway jumper as time expired.

The Heat then closed things out behind Wade and James. James had a put-back basket and then found Udonis Haslem underneath the rim for a layup. Wade iced it with a three-point play that made it 110-105 with 59 seconds left.

,jessie.p.johnson,2012-06-02T06:16Z,"NEPOTU!!!!  THANK YOU!!!!

we, your downloaders and seeders, are all regulars and we know not to read the comments until we've watched the game.  I guess mentallyours hasn't clued in that the comments are simply telling him off and not saying that he ruined the game for them, cause no one cares anymore.

He reminds me of that guy at parties telling dumb jokes and laughing at how clever he feels he is....while the rest of us walk away shaking our heads in pity.

Ignorance is still the best idea for dealing with him."
