STAAD.Pro allows structural engineers to analyze and design virtually any type of structure through its flexible modeling environment, advanced features and fluent data collaboration. 

 

 

 

Flexible modeling is provided by a state-of-the-art graphical environment and the design supports over 70 international codes and over 20 U.S. codes in 7 languages.
An array of advanced structural analysis and design features are included such as nuclear certification for 10CFR Part 50, 10CFR 21, ASME NQA-1-2000, time history and push over analysis and cable (linear and non-linear) analysis.
Efficiencies are gained through the ability to maintain and streamline current workflows with fluent data collaboration. STAAD.Pro integrates with other Bentley products such as STAAD.foundation and ProSteel and OpenSTAAD is provided for integration with third party programs.

Increased client base and therefore business growth can be realized in using STAAD.Pro to serve a broad spectrum of structural design projects and a global market.
