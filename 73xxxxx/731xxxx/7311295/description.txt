Donald (Childish Gambino)said on his tumblr to expect a new mix tape called ΓÇ£SwooshΓÇ¥. He released 4 album covers all the same but in different colors. It is unknown when the release date will be but itΓÇÖs got everyone on their toes.
Donald (Childish Gambino) put up a message with 4 album covers saying ΓÇ£01.11.12
[childish gambino] [mixtape] [swoosh] ΓÇ¥ and that was all the information given. (http://www.iamdonald.com/post/15682866827/childish-gambino) This was also what the album was said to be called on Wikipedia.

Now recently Donald has been saying the name ΓÇ£RoyaltyΓÇ¥ a lot on his twitter and in the video above where he sings 3 of his new songs live, the word royalty is frequently said and referring to him and his friends as the Royalty gang. On April 23rd Wikipedia changed the album mix-tape from swoosh to Royalty. So now everyone believes the name of the mix-tape is Royalty but isnΓÇÖt exactly clear. He has not mentioned much since the announcement on his website. Recently Donald was on the BET show 106 &Park and cleared up that Royalty was not the name of the mixtape just a name for him and his friends/musicians. So now we are back to a unconfirmed mixtape name but is said to be released soon.

He recently (April 23rd) did a ΓÇ£Secret ShowΓÇ¥ displaying some of his new mix tape songs. Link below.
