Inartis Project and the Moscow Planetarium with the support of SENSEIT present a retrospective exhibition of graphics of the Swiss artist Hans Ruedi Giger for the first time in Russia. It will give visitors a chance to become acquainted with the early printed drawings of the artist that he did in the 1960s and to see the works that brought him world fame, including the Oscar in 1980 for the ΓÇ£best visual effectsΓÇ¥ in Ridley Scotts film ΓÇ£The AlienΓÇ¥.
