,elmalvado,2012-06-16T15:04Z,It's 100% complete - I just don't care for 2nd & 3rd printings. I collect stuff & share. 
,eru_iluvatar,2012-06-20T23:42Z,does it include Advanced Race Guide?
,f.abby,2012-06-23T12:35Z,Later editions are really important because they include errata.
,elmalvado,2012-07-01T19:41Z,Advanced Race Guide & the rest of June releases - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7403319/Pathfinder_RPG_complete_(with_June_releases)
