Mountain Frolic - Rare Old Timey Classics 1924-37 [4CD, JSP, 224kb] 

Review:
HereΓÇÖs another of those neatly packaged British imports with tons of music at a really bargain price. As with others in this series, there are over 100 tracks. This set is roughly based on a very early (1940s) Decca 78rpm album of rare 1920s material from the old Vocalion and Brunswick catalogs (Buell Kazee, Hill Billies, Dad Crockett, Bascom Lunsford, etc) that proved to be quite influential among folksingers and the early old-time revivalists like New Lost City Ramblers. 

There is plenty here of interest to old time fans, though some of the groups that appear here seem selected totally at random (George Roark, Charlie Parker, Walter Couch and Red Patterson are each represented with one cutΓÇöall good tracks, but we canΓÇÖt figure out what the connection to the other material is. The groups that get the most attention are Buell Kazee (40 songs) and The Carolina Tar Heels (22 Victor tracks). There are also 7 pieces each by Bascom Lamar Lunsford and NelstoneΓÇÖs Hawaiians. Collectors should note right away that the 40 Kazee songs almost totally duplicate two fairly recent Buell Kazee reissues on the British Archive label. The Nelstone cuts are nice, and seldom heard, and there are a few well chosen tracks by Dr. Humphrey Bate and Al HopkinsΓÇÖ Buckle Busters.

All in all, thereΓÇÖs still a lot here for the old time fan to enjoy.
