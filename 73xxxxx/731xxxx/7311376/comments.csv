,mohee23,2012-05-30T08:09Z,Does this work on win 7
,uncle_tom,2012-05-30T09:14Z,"Yes. I am running Win7/64bit. Works fine now after a few glitches with the original (and hard to find) torrent. I added the correct NO-DVD cracks, and a program that may additionally help with sound/graphics problems. Hope you enjoy! Comment back for any questions and I'll try to help."
,deepak_rokz,2012-05-30T11:07Z,Good stuff
,Niss621,2012-05-31T23:55Z,Thanks man
,legacy9x,2012-06-01T00:30Z,"I installed everything just like it was specified in the directions, including alchemy and all.. Got rid of the black screen but my problem is that I don't get any sounds. I get sound effects like gun shots and the beeps from the codecs, but no voice acting nor music. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,uncle_tom,2012-06-01T06:07Z,Did you set your sound rate to 44khz or whatever your normal sound rate is in the options of the game itself?
,uncle_tom,2012-06-01T06:09Z,"Also try instead of Primary Sound Driver in the sound tab (of the Game options) to the other option.. in my case, Realtek Speakers."
,legacy9x,2012-06-01T06:58Z,"Yep, I tried a thousand things!

Including all of that..

I set to 11, 22 and 44.. Nothing worked..
I switched it to primary and then in my case as well REALTEK HD.

Tried to lower the sound details all the way down, nothing!

I won't get any music nor voices, I have all this games for the Ps2 but I wanted to play it on my Pc :/"
,legacy9x,2012-06-01T10:55Z,"Ok guys, for ANYBODY having problems with no MUSIC and NO CODEC VOICE I have found the issue.. Atleast for realtek HD people using..

You have to manually change it on your computer, most new computers have as default 19200 HZ.. MGS2 won't recognize it, you have to lower it a level to 9600 HZ and that it will recognize!

Awesome it works!"
,poo_riggus,2012-06-16T19:42Z,"hi, im having the black screen issue, and i'm using the ALchemy thing, whats the registry path? "
,Hancock79,2012-06-29T05:12Z,"what the fuck is with PC's and Metal Gear games, we get a whole 2 out of the entire series and they don't even work for many people.

well thanks for uploading this, everything works perfectly after following the directions!  here's to hoping someone like you fixes Metal Gear Solid 4 when the broken POS comes out(haha yea right), it's the only one I haven't played yet."
,barca447,2012-06-30T17:18Z,"i have this message when i run the game

,barca447,2012-06-30T17:24Z,"i have this error when i run the game 
Please insert METAL GEAR SOLID 2 : SUBSTANCE DISK , any help ?"
,Yenrock,2012-07-09T17:31Z,hey how did you get rid of the black screen? I followed the instructions properly but it is still black screen.
,uncle_tom,2012-07-15T06:17Z,Not sure on the black screen problems.. can you guys put up some system specs & OS?
,uncle_tom,2012-07-15T06:19Z,@barca447. Did you follow the directions and replace the .exe's with those provided in the crack directory?
,volc123,2012-07-16T00:21Z,Pleaaaaase SEED !
,volc123,2012-07-16T12:57Z,works fine ;) Thanks !!!! WILL SEEEDD SOOON xD
,meverick.,2012-07-19T20:33Z,"it doesn't work u moron...
bok parçası bu güzel törent değil...."
,uncle_tom,2012-07-28T07:31Z,"""it doesn't work u moron..."" ... despite several people saying it did for them. Hmmm.. might it be a problem with you or your system? I never claimed it was perfect, but it has worked for many.. go whine somewhere else where you didn't buy or couldn't find the fucking game to buy, you asshole. Sheesh, you try to do a favor and this is the bullshit you have to put up with. Fuck you, tiny man."
,Esp3c7r0,2012-07-31T14:41Z,"Man I have followed all the instructions. First, install the game then crack the game after that install the Alchemy thing and finally i run and still black? what should i do? 

I have w7 ultimate x64"
,Esp3c7r0,2012-07-31T15:25Z,Bro i just solved the Sound Problem but the screen still black 
,Damon163,2012-09-05T05:06Z,"TO EVERYONE SAYING THIS DOESN'T WORK. IT DOES WORK!! It's just that the uploader have been given us some fail instructions. 1)Download Creative ALchemy Universal 

2)Open it and add Metal Gear Solid as a new game that you want to use with the software.

3) Choose the game directory where you installed it. If you didn't customize your install it should look like this: C:Program Files (x86)KONAMIMetalGearSolid2 Substance

5) Check the last option called ""Disable direct music "" and continue  

7)Go to the game folder( C:Program Files (x86)KONAMIMetalGearSolid2 Substance) and now you'll see these files: dsound.dll and dsound.ini 

8)Copy them and paste into the ""bin""﻿ folder
 9) Done! 

If you have any further questions just send me a mail at lelouch163@gmail.com"
,Damon163,2012-09-05T05:18Z,YOU NEED TO HAVE THE 2.0 PATCH BEFORE DOING ANYTHING I SAID IN THE COMMENT ABOVE!! It can be found by just googling it :P 
,Damon163,2012-09-05T05:36Z,"Oh and I almost forgot, when you have installed the new patch just put the crack that you got from this torrent and keep on playing! And if you can run the game but still have sound issues, reset your settings in Creative Alchemy and do everything but don't check in ""Disable direct music"", it worked for a friend of mine."
,1223178,2012-09-22T20:24Z,"Great game but i have a problem. I can get the game to load, no black screen no sound issues. after it loads and i start to play the game i can't see. Its almost like there is a green filter over the screen. I have made it into the ship and its the same. any ideas?"
