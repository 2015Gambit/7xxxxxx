A fast paced FPS action game for PC released in 2007. If you cannot shoot, then there is your RECON, hacking device enabling you to remotely control various devices you meet (robots, manipulators, surveillance cameras, security systems, weapons etc.) on your way through the dark halls and corridors of Alpha Prime. If that's not enough, you can drug your mind and sharpen your senses (bullet time) by injecting a small dose of hubbardium. And all the time you will be surrounded by physical world in a very literal sense, because almost everything that moves, moves thanks to advanced real-time physics algorithms. Features 10 levels full of action; 5 non-playable characters to help you; 14 different enemies including Special Forces soldiers, robots and crazy miners; 8 futuristic weapons including pistol, shotgun, machine gun, grenades etc..
