,blueget,2012-06-04T12:07Z,"Could you put together a Third Day Discography? That would be awesome, some of the albums you already torrented aren't exactly well seeded (that is, more or less dead...)

Regarding Remedy Drive, I torrented all what I got from them here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7313453/Remedy_Drive"
