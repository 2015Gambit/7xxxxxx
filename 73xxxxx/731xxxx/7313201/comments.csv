,stratblast,2012-07-04T13:16Z,I don't know where walkingcougar2005 got their info but it's wrong. This program even works with Windows 8 preview starting with version 5.4. Go look again before posting bulls**t.
,muse033,2012-07-26T21:29Z,Thank you serguifro for this useful program!!! BTW do you know how to allow Proxy Switcher to automatically configure proxy setting for the Opera browser (version 12 - 64 bit). Once again thanks!
