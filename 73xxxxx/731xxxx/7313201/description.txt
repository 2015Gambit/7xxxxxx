Anonymous browsing - how does it work
In a regular case your web browser connects to the web site directly. Thus revealing quite a lot of sensitive information. An orange arrow denotes this case in the block scheme.
To change this situation Proxy Switcher was written. It can be used to find working anonymous proxy servers and redirect requests through them.

Anonymous Browsing - Possible usage scenario
ΓÇóIf you get banned on the forum - use Proxy Switcher to fake your IP and avoid the ban.
ΓÇóIf you are a webmaster that wants to check Geotargetting of some sites (i.e. Google).
ΓÇóJust want to hide your IP when visiting some sites which you might not want to record your IP address.

Automatic Anonymous Proxy Switching
To increase anonymity even further Proxy Switcher can periodically switch proxy servers. You can set this period down to every 10 seconds. In this mode Proxy Switcher will continually check and pick fastest available servers.
