During the last decade the engineering applications for nickel and chromium coatings have gained in importance. In this third edition the chapter dealing with engineering applications has been updated and expanded to include more information on electroforming and composite coatings, and engineering applications have been emphasized in the additions to the chapter on autocatalytic deposition of nickel. Additions have been made to the sections on pulse plating and use or rotating cathodes, and the section on trivalent chromium has been extended.
