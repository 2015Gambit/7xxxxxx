It is recommended that the Seerah of the Prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) should be read at least once a year. In todays fast paced world, Maulana Makki Al-Hijazis "Seerat-un-Nabi" on audio CDs provides a convenient alternative. This audio Seerah is as comprehensive as can be imagined. The Seerah starts with the description of conditions of pre-islamic Arabia and ends at Abu Bakr being named the first Caliph of Islam. People familiar with Makki Hijazi from his daily dars at the Kabah, will appreciate this lecture, given in the same fluent manner as one has come to expect from the Sheikh. Supplemented with Quran, Hadith & narrations of the sahabah - add to this Makki Hijazis distinct narrative style, these CDs serve to educate as well as entertain the listener. 

Excellent series of lecture on Life of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in Urdu.
