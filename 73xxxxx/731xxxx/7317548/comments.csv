Ha, I figured it out! Turns out there's a virus around that screws up the Windows Firewall, so you can use the same techniques for fixing it to re-enable it in your Win7 lite distros.

To re-enable Windows Firewall, download and run/add this to the registry:
http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/7/MpsSvc.reg

After restarting, if it STILL isn't working, download and install Microsoft Security Essentials, and restart the PC again.


Interestingly enough, once it is working, you can actually disable Windows Firewall and uninstall MSE; you'll still be able to create new network-shared folders and stuff.

Note that, by default, the sharing permissions might not be set-up correctly, so you may have to go through this process:
