I wasn't sure if I should list this under TV SHOWS or MUSIC VIDEOS.  

New Music Live is a daily (weekday) TV show on MuchMusic (Canada).   Therefore I went with the TV SHOWS category.

On May 28 2012, Adam Lambert was the guest for almost the entire show.  Lengthy interview and chit-chat, and one or two of his videos.   The end of the show finishes up with a couple other current music videos (like Justin Beiber, etc).

I am not a regular viewer of this show, but I like Adam Lambert, so I tuned in for this broadcast.  I figured there might be some fans out there outside of Canada who would like to see the entire broadcast in high quality.

COMMENTS BELOW ARE APPRECIATED.  Hint hint. :)
