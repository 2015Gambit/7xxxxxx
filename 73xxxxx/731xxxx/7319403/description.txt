FRINGE- SEASON 4 - Fox TV show mp4

I took HD broadcast versions (mkv) and converted them to H.264 MP4 files using Handbrake. The file sizes are all over the place but all have video dimensions that come in at 1280 x 720 and look great on my 42 inch HDTV. They can be played on most all iPods, iPhones, iPads, 2nd & 3rd gen. Apple TVs or in iTunes but you may need to change the suffix from .mp4 to .m4v. There are no subtitles or alternate languages.

Since I converted these I figured why not save you the trouble and share them. I haven't watched all the episodes but sampling shows no problems.

As always, feedback is appreciated. This is one HUGE file.   PLEASE KEEP SEEDING.
