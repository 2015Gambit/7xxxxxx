,sammy.young,2012-06-30T11:56Z,"wow! it has given me the best sound and video drivers i have seen so far... wounderful installation, it is everything that has been said it is... however i did encounter a problem... the blutooth software failed to install bcoz it said i had no admin rights, all though i was logged in as an admin... apart from that, so far so good"
,NekoNinja,2012-07-28T01:47Z,"I'm quite excited. Even before I have the torrent downloaded I know from your past torrents that it will work amazingly and solve all my problems (well, all my computer problems anywho). nothing like a fresh install to cleanse ones system. :D"
,gtaboy88,2012-08-07T16:19Z,hey where is the product key can find it in the txt
[T],HighCode,2012-08-09T13:31Z,Thanks a lot.
,beepbeat,2012-08-18T04:12Z,"@liluser: Too much cruft for my preferences.  I've always liked your XP disks since they get me an up-to-date system quickly with minimal cruft.  I like the idea of the full driverpacks on a DVD with Windows, but I don't like all the other applications.  Starting up my first system with this version, I felt like I had just received a new laptop full of bloatware.  Plus, maybe something was wrong with my system, but nothing was showing up under add/remove programs in the control panel, so I couldn't easily uninstall the apps I didn't want."
,ProfaneHH,2012-08-23T13:40Z,Can you guys upload an updated version of 64 bit XP? With SATA drivers for newer WD and Seagate Hard drives? Under 698MB? I say that because I've noticed several 1GB+ XP versions and I think it's horrible given the fact some computers only have a CDROM............. Nobody wants your software choices. Make it lean too.
