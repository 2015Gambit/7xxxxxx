****ME3 Extended Cut Install Guide with the 1.03 Update****
-------------------------------------------------------

Get the DLC & Upate from here:-

Open the ME3 Update v1.03 Folder.
In that folder there is two folders, BIOGame & Binaries.
Copy & paste those two folders into your games installation Directory.

,Jopa74,2012-07-19T17:32Z,"To much complcate damm fack, is that some crack or patch to easy setup game???"
,Fantomnz,2012-07-27T06:39Z,"Hi everyone & Thanks ""scene4all""

Works great & I thought the new ending was good enough for the effort... :) IMO

And to answer my own question & for others ""Yes"" you can install the DLC & Patch & play from near the end of the game & get the Extended Endings!!!!! I Loaded a save just before the end  & going up to the Citadel... Worked just dandee :)

Cheers great work :)

,seed513,2012-08-29T07:21Z,Do I need previous updates?

Dude... I mean... Usually, I'm quite understanding and tolerant of people that just don't know how to do something (we're not born with genetic memory) and if I do know then I may offer advice, but it has been done. You can't explain it any better, or simplier than Fantomnz did few posts above...
... and dude... If someone tells you to ""copy and paste"" to a specific directory, and to make yourself new shortcut and you're saying it's too complicated, then you REALLY shouldn't be here, do some basic windows lessons, google ""windows for seniors"" or something... something... just something... 
... I just realized that you're being sarcastic... So the joke's on me, since it was I who was a bit too slow... but since I've already typed it I'll post it anyways.


And of course... Big THANK YOU to the uploader as well as to the releasing crew of Reloaded (even thought they won't see it). Thanks guys again."
