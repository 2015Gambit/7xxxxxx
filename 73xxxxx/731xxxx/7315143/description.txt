Untamed Australia Season 1


Untamed Australia provides more than ten hours of amazing footage of some of the most amazing and bizarre creatures in the world. Only in Australia do we find such a rich variety of marsupials, reptiles, birds and mammals not found anywhere else on earth.
No interviews with scientists, no CGI graphics, no re-enactments or unnecessary background info - just ten hours of animals in their natural habitats, without a single human in sight.
