'Brilliant' is the brand new studio album from classic line-up Ultravox (Midge Ure, Billy Currie, Chris Cross & Warren Cann), their first new studio album in almost three decades.

"Brilliant, is a bitter sweet comment on pop culture. "You, the brilliant thing you are, outshine the brightest star, so distant and too far". It's about the other side of fame and success, a song about the bright young things that ignore the consequences of fame with the ensuing burn out rate...In a way it should read 'Brilliant' with a question mark."
