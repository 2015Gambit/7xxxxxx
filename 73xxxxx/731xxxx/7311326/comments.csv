,l4mer,2012-05-30T22:19Z,"100 seeders 1600+ leechers ! Just wow!

thanks for upload"
,AA82890,2012-05-31T02:41Z,Been stuck on 99.9% for the last day. This is some bull$hit.
,AA82890,2012-05-31T03:01Z,Censoring my comment does not change the fact that I've been at 99.9% for the past day. Making this a craptacular torrent. Gonna report that too? Ignorant good for nothings. Go out and do something actually useful to this world.
,oldtimer48,2012-05-31T05:04Z,"@AA82890, I am downloading this torrent now, there are 110 seeders to 2006 peers, on the availability column it says 0.998 availability, with a thin red line for the .002% not available.  There are no seeders at this stage on my download,  just 50 peers, and the speed is good average 223.8.  I am assuming that when a seed is available I will receive the other .002%, Yify torrents are usually 100% spot on."
,oldtimer48,2012-05-31T05:20Z,"No I am also stuck on 99.9% also, I am in a quandry whether to continue seeding this torrent if it is not 100%, can someone explain this??"
[V],YIFY,2012-05-31T08:27Z,"To fix the 99.9% issue please do the following:

Download this torrent file:
http://torcache.net/torrent/50BA6F54F4A2E135E7106CCA2EEE9FC5D482D2CF.torrent

- Remove the Current Torrent form your client (DO NOT DELETE DATA) 

- Click on download on this page once again. 

- Browse into the same directory as your old data: ""Around the World in 80 Day (2004)"" 

- Click OK, and the client should 'recheck' the data (will take about 2-5mins) 

- Torrent Client Will show you 100% DONE 

- Seed :)"

,oldtimer48,2012-05-31T09:23Z,"Yify thank you for the instructions and the movie. A/10, V/10, awesome quality as usual, dl actually stopped at 99.9% was only 432kb short, and it converted okay despite being a few kbs short. Keep up the excellent work."
,Applegrenade,2012-06-02T00:56Z,"Yeah mine also got stuck at 99.9%, I just left it there for 2 and a half days and eventually i just stopped it and it works fine anyhow"
