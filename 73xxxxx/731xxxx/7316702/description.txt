Duffy - Rockferry, Ripped with EAC, paranoid mode, no compression, wav files.
Considering that nowadays hard disk storage capacity is not an issue anymore compression has no point of being used so if you want to share something share the best quality.(this applies for lossless codecs too, it doesn't sound like the original or the ripped wav)
If you like it, share it.
