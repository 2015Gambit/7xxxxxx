eTextbook of "Elementary Differential Equations, 6th Edition" by C. H. Edwards and D. E. Penney with the assistance of D. Calvis (c2008). Small bookmarked, page-numbered PDF file (14 MB) complete with table of contents and index. Good, clean scanned-from-book PDF (unreliable searchability but a minor defect IMHO).

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
