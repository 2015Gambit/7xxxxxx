1. Celestial Bodies 02:27
2. Heavy Bombardment / Mariner 10 07:34
3. Ode To The Possible Past 04:17

The second release in the Celestial Bodies series, a 12-month galactic collaboration between Ruined Machines and artist Michal Brodka spanning the entire Solar System and beyond. 

"We knew the second chapter in the Celestial Bodies series had to live up to the potential that "The Sun" had set (no pun intended) about a month ago. We think we exceeded our own expectations on this, especially given the short amount of time we had to make it come to life. We hope you enjoy "Mercury" as much as we enjoyed creating it."
