,thesaguaro,2012-05-31T02:01Z,"Thanks Snakeye -- unfortunately I am on Overdrive and need to wait for the release of that version later. It will be interesting to see the debate as to which is better -- Active Sky 2012 or this (and the forthcoming OD upgrade). Anyway, thanks for the post!"
,namco-nexgen,2012-05-31T02:24Z,Thanks _SnakEye. Can't wait to try the engine and see how it compares to AS2012.
,xtracal,2012-05-31T02:48Z,Thesaguaro - Your going to need this update prior to the REX Essential Overdrive which is going to be released soon.
,iramacky,2012-05-31T03:51Z,"First id like to say nice1 Snakeye for upping your one of a kind, and recently have been put on my list ""which is good"" theres only a few i like to test there work. Anyway Im not downloading it and wasnt planning to coz i use AS2012 with REX2 ""for clouds only"", but dam guys 56 Leechers and only 6 seeders. Greedy little gits must switch off the second they'v finished downloading. Couldin you seed for a few hours while your testing it and keep it alive for the guys that just cant afford to buy it or for the guys ""like me"" who wants to test it before buying it to see how if/it works and affects the performance of my sim. it was only uploaded few hours ago and already its nearly dead. wow really - when i started typing this msg a min ago there was 56 leechers now iits 59 wow. After i download even if it only took 5 mins to Dload iv often left it seeding for hours even left it seeding over night dosnt cost you nothing ""well only monthly internet bill"" ;-) The time and effort SOME of these guys put in to help us simmers we can show some support to them like. wow wow fuking wow. Again Snakeye thanks for your upps and support to the simming world and keep up the good work."
,bucker543,2012-05-31T04:01Z,Im gonna download and seed for a couple hours. I dont need it but I agree with iramacky. Thanks _SnakeEye for the upload!
,vfas,2012-05-31T06:49Z,Thanks a lot for this!! But where can I get the 2.3 update. It says not compatible with 2.5 Overdrive.
,_SnakEye,2012-05-31T07:14Z,"@iramacky , 1st of all thanks, I did not try it either as I am a AS2012 User , I only got hold of this copy in some strange forum.
it would be nice to see the compare between those two (AS v. REX).
the reason why ther were only few seeders is not b/c ppl did not want to seed or ran away right after D/L the pack, it is b/c  I just uploaded it and there were not enough guys that completed to d/l it.
I don't have a fast uplink to the Internet,hence it takes me few good hours to complete, even though I was just 20% through (less then a quarter) it showed in TPB that there are 6 seeders already,which can't be trure as I only uploaded 20% of the file. so it could be confusing. I don't relay on those numbers to be honest. "
,iramacky,2012-05-31T09:10Z,"@Snakeye. Yea its gonna be interesting to see which comes out the best (AS2012 vs REXe) For me i really like AS2012 combined with REX2 ""for clouds"" the effects are just amazing, Saying tht, the developers of REXe had all this time to test AS2012 probably with REX2 combined aswell and i bet wht ever pros/cons they found they'v fixed and improved them into REXe. Well thats wht i would of doing if i was part of the REX team and had all this time to test. Or it might be a let down ""but doubtful"" ether way it will be interesting. Anyway im very happy with the results iv got with AS2012/REX2 and im sure you are and ill stick by it. i'll make it short lol - For me to change to REXe it will have to be really outstanding and beat AS2012/REX2 by far, with the amount of testing and settings tweaking iv done ""im sure you to"" to get my visuals to where thy are and for thm to work with my addons and run on FSinn network with no probs. Anyways Thanks again m8 for your support to the simming world. @Snakeye-ONLY mail me flyboygeek@yahoo.com. Anyways im going to do a flight now in the NG to LPMA via Airhauler cos iv to pay the bills plus the pilot iv hired his wages is due or he will leave. Dam AI pilots are so fussy lol. Its a really great program though. All the best m8 and keep up the good work, Macky"
,Jblinck,2012-05-31T09:56Z,"I'll seed the whole night, thank u"

,levkovvvv,2012-05-31T12:00Z,Thanks man. Can you get the Wings of Power 3 P-51d mustang with accusim by A2A simulations?
,vfas,2012-05-31T16:27Z,@iramacky thank you very much for your help. I was able to download v 2.3 from the support forum. ItÂ´s a hotfix for sp3.
,jrma3,2012-05-31T17:15Z,"were can i get the REX 2 v2.5.2010.1027 version?
i have only the 2.0.2010.0611
tnx"
,Brrr1955,2012-05-31T17:48Z,"Is it possible to upgrade  REX Essential, I have REX 2.0.2010.0611 (it's version 2.0 with SP3)

Very Confusing because v2.5.2010.1027 is REX OD and it will not work, so why i need that version???
"
,TravisA320,2012-05-31T18:05Z,"To clarify things; 
you must have REX 2 v2.3.2010.1027 before you Upgrade to REX Essential, not REX 2 v2.5."
,_SnakEye,2012-05-31T18:17Z,"you right, it's my mistake.
v2.5.xxx is with OverDrive.
you need the 2.x.2010.1027 (SP3 + the Hot fix)
my mistake.
sorry for confusing you guys."
,jrma3,2012-05-31T18:24Z,"brrr1955,
did you installed this anyway?it works?

sorry for bad english"
,robk182,2012-05-31T18:46Z,chances for the be55 milviz???????????????? great plane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
,juanchopancho,2012-05-31T18:59Z,"Thanks for this!

Also looking for the LatinVFR Caracas and Montevideo, BDOaviation Jakarta and A_A sceneries Phuket all for FSX. "
,Brrr1955,2012-05-31T20:19Z,"If you are running REX 2.0 - v2.0.2009.0803 from the torrent on TPB:

1) Install 'rex2_rtmpatch.zip'
2) Install 'rexfsx_sp3_20090818_TO_20100611.exe' from root of REX2 installation *important*
   Now you will have 2.0 2010.0611 version 
3) Install SP3 hothix1 (rexfsx_sp3_hotfix1.exe) You can download from official site
   Now you will have 2.3.2010.1027 version
4) Inatall this REX Essential Upgrade"
,Toasterman7,2012-05-31T21:48Z,"@_SnakEye Just wanted to say thank you, I've been seeding. Your efforts are a genuine contribution to the community and thank you very much!

Along with REXE, I was wondering if it was possible someone had the AS2012 SP1 Beta B4469 update cracked - that fixes a numerous amount of problems I'm sure a handful of users here experience (mainly the temperature problems)

Again, THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH!"
,Espana25,2012-06-01T00:24Z,"This is an amazing upload but unfortunately won't be able to get my hands on this as i am one of those with ""REX 2+Overdrive"" .so i suppose i need to stay away from this upgrade for now but once again a definite commitment to such great uploads is highly appreciated.will wait for something with overdrive comparability :) !"
,_SnakEye,2012-06-01T00:38Z,"you guys might want and wait a bit with the hassle of this Update, I am supposed to be getting the Full version in the next day or two."
,jeradwtf,2012-06-01T01:59Z,"Hey is there a reason why no one has uploaded GSX on here? Thats is the only thing that im missing. Uploader if you have it, could you upload it, or if its like the one addon thats impossible to upload then i guess dont bother. But yeah im just curious why no one has uploaded it and its one of the best additions to fsx. thanks."
,jeradwtf,2012-06-01T02:03Z,uploader could you please let me know why there is no Ground Services X upladed anywhere on ther internet?? seriously. GSX - fsdreamteam
,xtracal,2012-06-01T09:09Z,"A couple of things about this update.

1. If you don't have REX 2 then wait for SnakEye to upload the whole release.

2. If you do have REX 2 + Overdrive you will need this update prior to getting the REX Essential + Overdrive.  Yes, you'll be taking a little step back with the clouds but you will be prepared for the Overdrive release.

3. REX Essential for Prepar3d is authenticated through online purchase - $4.99 is pretty good."
,almostatys,2012-06-01T17:08Z,"Hi!

I uploaded this REX Essential,and I haven't textures. I can't see textures: sky,clouds...etc! Please help me!"
,Brrr1955,2012-06-01T17:27Z,You must run as an administrator and all wrok nice.
,_SnakEye,2012-06-01T22:00Z,"here is the Full version release:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7319651"
,captray,2012-07-28T03:02Z,"So - to clarify even more, if i have v2.5.2010.1027 (Rex 2 + Overdrive) installed, in order to apply the upgrade provided by this torrent i must previously remove the Rex Overdrive through the ""Add or Remove Programs"" list in Windows; Is that correct?
BTW: thanks a lot SnakEye! 
Suggestions: FSUIPC (latest) and Milviz B55."
,MockT13,2012-08-10T01:56Z,"thks _SnakEye
question: how to configure REXE to run in client/server mode? the howto is hidden on their support forum :-("
