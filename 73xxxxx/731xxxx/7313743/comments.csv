Actually, it's three pdf files: 1) the 3-act play itself with production notes, 2) an ""errata"" file of expurgated and deleted scenes, and 3) a postscript with a suggested user manual, an extended postscript, and a suggested soundtrack for production. I write this in the spring of 2012. I hope you enjoy it, but don't risk putting on a production."
