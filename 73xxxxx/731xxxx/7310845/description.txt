Paloma Faith - Fall To Grace (Deluxe Edition).


Her 2009 debut album, Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?, was a respectable success, spawning a couple of top 20 hits and slowly going platinum. 

Faith's savvy and ambition show in her choice of collaborators. 

Fall to Grace, her second album is co-produced by Jake Gosling, fresh from success with Ed Sheeran, and Nellee Hooper, a class act who's worked with everyone from Bj√∂rk to Madonna. 

Faith calls the latter an "interpreter" of her musical ideas; the pair would discuss her songs in relation to scenes or images from films and Hooper would translate these ideas into soundscapes.

Release Date: 28th May 2012.
