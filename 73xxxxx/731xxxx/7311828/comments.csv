Your previous upload of this has been deleted."
,echothrash,2012-05-30T11:07Z,"To mod velvet: Yeah, sorry, there was some PHP errors when uploading the file from a belgian mirror (tpb blocked in belgium) the first time, so I tried deleting it but it didn't work, so I uploaded another time because the other was buggy. 
Anyway, sorry."

The file with a .DAT extension is actually an SWF"
