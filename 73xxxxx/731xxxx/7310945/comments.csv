But MKV files to the previous period can choose the time line, and the rest can not choose the timeline.
Other people have this problem?

[T],HighCode,2012-05-30T20:57Z,"USE MPC. DON'T use vlc.
VLC is the worst player for playing mkv-s, especially very high-settings-encoded mkv-s.
I suppose you used vlc."
,710065,2012-05-31T08:29Z,"I know why.I tyied MPC-HC.1.6.2.4902.x64,MPC-HC.1.6.2.4902.x86,smplayer-portable-0.8.0,splayer,UMPlayer.
At last,i find that mkv file have 19:20:43(19hours in timeline),the flim only have 01:31:19,so this is why can not choose to start playing in the middle of 2 hours or 4hours.
thank you share this."
[T],HighCode,2012-05-31T11:45Z,"subtitles can cause it too.
 See if any change with the mkv re-muxed without some subs.
An other reason is that you got some extra stuff installed on pc that interferes with your media players. Too many players installed cause rendering mismatch.
Uninstall and re-install MPC and it should tell you if some reg-keys need to be removed or ffmpeg, VobSub etc ininstalled.... 
I personally don't have that issues with the file, I can drag to any time I like while playing."
,710065,2012-05-31T15:07Z,"Do I send the wrong place?I just re-add resources, suggesting that the seeds already exists in the task list.
Reason not subtitles, even if I did not join the other subtitles, turn off the subtitles of MKV files. This situation will appear.
Other movies I have downloaded. the MKV file is no such problem. Like High School Musical movies,or (This.Means.War.2012.UNRATED.720p.BluRay.x264-SPARKS [PublicHD])
This delay your time to deeply apologize. Thank you for answer my question. Do not have to spend too much on this issue. I wish you a happy day."

http://bayfiles.com/file/bU29/a2hVZb/Iron_Sky_2012_BDRip_720p_DTS_multisub_HighCode-PublicHD_-sample.mkv

it is the exact same scene (1 minute) as the sample of 
Iron Sky 2012 BluRay 720p DTS x264-3Li 

The only difference you'll see is the size ;-) 
and subtitles."

Thanks for sharing this, but a question for you. How is this on home cinema? Got a screen over 100"" so how is it? The bit rate is only 3000 and display 2.35:1?

Thanks!"
