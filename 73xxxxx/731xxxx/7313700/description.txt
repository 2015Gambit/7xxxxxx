TITLE:


Ok lets clear up the reason for yet another readnfo release....couple of reasons really.
1.The main body and most of the film is from a new source,however there was missing scenes which
 have been filled in with unknowns cam.
2.Runtime is shorter than the other yet its ALL there and isn't missing anything....when syncinng the
 video seemed too fall behind by 27 secs every 10mins roughly,yet i match the start and end point of 10min
 clips from adtrg release and this one.
 So we think its got too be the way one of the releases is captured ....but tested this on TV and plays fine.

Video ....MUCH better Q than whats out and is less cropped on sides and top,but a touch more cropped on the bottom.
Like stated missing some scenes aswell but they were filled in.
Audio ....was adtrgs line as it was better,still needed some lovin but not much


Filtered the video and appened missing scenes too make it complete and then the main time was spent syncing.Was a pita to
do due too the runtimes,so ended up with 60 cuts and not the way you should do it,but when using already cut audio files it
makes it alot harder too sync.Different when you have untouched audio files,but hey ho

Oh forgot all about the subs ...doh,anyway made a subpack and HC when needed
