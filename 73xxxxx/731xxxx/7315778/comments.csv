,gurkhaboy,2012-06-02T11:43Z,"It worked fine! The print was amazingly clear, the subs were right on. I have no idea why others are saying they have a problem.

V: 9.5

Korean hard subs with English hard subs underneath them.

Thanks Senor Neon.  You da man. :)"
,snowbirds,2012-06-10T09:17Z,"This is a perfect copy, but allow me to lower your expectations for the movie down to a reasonable level.

Best action flick in a decade?  Definitely not.  It's fairly well done action flick that reads just like a video game.  Police storm building and move through halls that all look the same, encountering bad guys who all look the same, having firefights that all look the same, then have machete fights that all look the same, then have knife fights that all look the same, then have hand-to-hand fights that all look the same.  YAWN....   And of course the hero of the movie never gets tired, even after fighting 30 men.  He never seems to feel pain, or have emotions, and neither does anyone else.  It's just Attack of the Drones over here, except these drones are spurting blood everywhere....

So if that is your idea of a great action film, here it is folks.  Or, if you've already turned 14 and you expect more from a movie, be forewarned...

,vafler86,2012-06-11T10:42Z,"Well, the kids now days want CGI effects in their action movies, which this movie clearly dont. so its no wonder they are bashing it.
This is a brilliant movie, not the plot but what they achieved in plain simple hand to hand choreography. Its like ballet, everything is in the flow, the movement of blocks and counter attacks and so on.
Thats why i liked it and i am probably gonna buy it on blu ray, if i find it in the stores."
,FRivera,2012-06-13T15:18Z,"Thank you, excellent copy. v9 a10 good subs."
,jealousbones,2012-06-16T17:41Z,"@snowbirds your opinion is your opinion, is it truly the best action movie in decades? probably not but it is up there, it's really well done and I would put it amongst some of my favorites. clearly it's not made to be a real life drama, it's an action movie and it delivers at that. not to mention it was made on quite a small budget, I dare anyone in hollywood to make a movie like this on the budget they had and see if its nearly as well done. they had to be creative with what they had and it worked. good on them! now quit your bitchin!"
,SnowLVL100,2012-06-22T19:53Z,"A:10

Thanks!!!"
,i_bert,2012-07-04T23:41Z,Thanks neon. I've been wanting to see this. 
,swantly,2012-07-26T04:25Z,"I have to agree about it being out of sync.
I watched this on my tv using a memory stick and my movies media player and it was badly out of sync after about 20 minutes."
