,tuscanidream,2012-05-31T23:16Z,"Thank you for the updated version. As always, I legally own a copy of this App. However, NI's licensing is ridiculous so I prefer a cracked copy. Never will I forget to go out with my laptop and forget to activate again! Such b.s."
,Rizzo220,2012-06-02T05:44Z,"Not to dis but NI is still working the bugs out of this v2.5 release.
Google it or go to the NI Traktor website to see the issues with v2.5
For now I'll stick with v2.1.2. "
,deejdave,2012-09-04T00:15Z,Maybe I am missing something but I have tried installing several times with alternate approaches but every time only Traktor LE installs. Yes ver. 2.5 but not Traktor Pro as listed above. Is there a step I am overlooking? 
,rubbar,2012-09-21T00:25Z,"It appears the crack for scratch functionality doesn't work.

I appreciate what you do Union.  After purchasing the Audio 10 soundcard and /not/ getting a copy of Scratch with it (seems like a no brainer, huh?) I decided to pirate their software.  Any help resolving the crack issue would be great"
,rubbar,2012-09-21T01:38Z,"I rescind my earlier statement.  I did a complete uninstall and then re-installed it.  Worked like a charm.

Much love."
