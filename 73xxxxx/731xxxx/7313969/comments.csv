,Bubbers83,2012-05-31T02:20Z,Can you post the third issue of Supurbia? I have the first two and the 3rd came out 3 weeks ago...have yet to see it. It's a nice little series by Boom! studios
,LCSINpatria,2012-05-31T03:16Z,"was hoping for more action, but story progression is fine"
[V],mirrormaster82,2012-05-31T11:47Z,"Bubbers83:There's no use of requesting series that is uploaded regularly here on TPB.If you think about it you can draw the only logical conclusion - it isn't scanned yet...If you want the issue so badly go out and buy it,otherwise you'll just have to wait..."
