,scyris99,2012-06-01T09:38Z,"Skyman its prob a false positive. Generally anything uploaded by someone with a skull is usually safe, because if it wasn't they'd lose that status.

On my scans it came up clean with Avast."

Need this patch in order to play Hugo"
,mloft9,2012-06-06T01:37Z,"everyone, why my audio in game is French ? I setuped just like normally but i don't have English, how can i change it to French ? Please help me, thanks"
,tulling1337,2012-06-09T03:47Z,"mloft9

Only the intro is in French, but the sub is in English so don't worry."
,GourmetPrince,2012-06-15T20:45Z,"There was a Steam update for this game on 6/4/2012. It fixed a lot of issues in the game, including crashing. Is it possible to upload the new update on here?

Cannot play some of the characters in the game without this dire update."
,Lelarep,2012-06-30T15:38Z,"For anyone wondering why the intro movie is in French it's because the actual mythology of the city of Ys in the real world is indeed French in origin. The legend of Ys involved a city on the coast of France that was eventually subsumed by the ocean. Educate yourselves, people!"
,TheChristReborn,2012-08-24T19:12Z,Can I play this game with a controller too?
