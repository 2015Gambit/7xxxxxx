Set 700 years before the first title in the Ys series, the Ys Origin's
story focuses on the twin Goddesses and the mysterious Black Pearl made
famous in Ys I & II, and follows the adventures of several playable
characters as they ascend the menacing Darm Tower

Players select from one of three playable characters, each with their own
unique storyline and vastly different style of play. After the Story Mode
has been completed the real challenge begins as players test their mettle
in Time Attack, Boss Rush and Arena Mode. Falcom's much-lauded Sound Team
JDK is back once again to provide the hard rocking music that players have
become accustomed to hearing as they take on the brutal old-school
platforming and puzzle challenges that the Ys series is known for
