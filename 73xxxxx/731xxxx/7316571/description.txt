"Legends of Flight" is pitched as a documentary history of the latest developments in airplane technology, intended to inspire careers in engineering and science, and supposedly starring both the Dreamliner and the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet.

But the movie's title and marketing slant are misleading. Airbus plays a very minor role. The $10 million movie, partly funded by Boeing and narrated by chief Dreamliner test pilot Mike Carriker, is really a promotional film for the 787.
