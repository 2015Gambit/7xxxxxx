THE WALL : psychoanalysis put to the test for autism

This 52 minutes movie, in 5 parts, is the result of 4 years of investigation among 30 psychiatrists and psychoanalysts in France, that shows the way they see autism and deal with children with autism. Some of them are in charge of pedopsychiatry departments in hospitals today. 50 years of progress in science do not seem to have had any influence on their dogmatism
