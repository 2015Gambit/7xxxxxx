StressLinux is a minimal live Linux distribution for simulating extremely high-load situations on computers.  During these stress tests and benchmarks, StressLinux monitors the health of the hardware.  It is a live distro, so all you have to do is burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD and boot from it.  It does not have a GUI so you have to be at least a little familiar with command-line.

This is good for people who are overclocking their computers, or want to test unstable software.  If a computer can handle the load forced upon it while running StressLinux, it will be able to handle anything on its native OS.  This runs on 64-bit computers only.
