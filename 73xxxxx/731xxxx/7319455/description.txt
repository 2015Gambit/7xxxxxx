Neil Young returns to work with Crazy Horse, whom he has not played with since 2003's Greendale, on his long-awaited thirty-fourth studio album. Backed by his faithful Crazy Horse band, the Canadian music legend tackles classic western folk songs, ballads and minstrel songs, re-worked into the known Neil Young sound.
