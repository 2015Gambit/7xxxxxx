,tnavarro,2012-06-02T01:39Z,"Ichiroyoung, thank you so much for the weekly packs. I'm a part time EFL teacher, and just started my career, so I don't really have the disposable income to buy all of the comics that I want. Thank you for providing a reliable, regular and organised way for me to read my comics and share them with my students :)"
[T],VaultRelease,2012-06-02T03:01Z,"Thanks, Ichiroyoung. I honestly rely on your torrents for my weekly reviews."
,Ilovelife123,2012-06-02T05:34Z,"Been following you since you first started , I am a college student and have a part time job , so I am running low on extra cash for this kinda of things but I still try to buy the best ones just to collect them (loving night of owls). Anyway last week the store I work at got robbed and I got zip tied and held at knife point in the floor for almost 10 minutes while the guy screamed at me that he was going to kill me and didnt care if I had family , havent really been able to sleep well ever since and I recently noticed I had 2 light stabs in my back nothing major but the pain reminds me of that moment. Thing is reading this comics has help a lot to distract my mind and help me sleep , I thank you and wish I could thank the DC team for it because even if the real world is lacking justice at least I get some sort of joy watching my dc heroes beating up the kind of people that almost did me. Ty again ."

,TheOneTC,2012-06-04T03:32Z,"Thanks for each and every week's upload.  I just recently got into comics, and these uploads have been a great way to get on track keep updated on everything, especially with all of the Night of the Owls crossovers, without having to shell out money for each issue.  Still buy my certain series', but this allows me to read more than I normally would be able to.  Thanks again!"
,JMARK58,2012-06-04T03:45Z,Is it week 38 or week 40? I've always thought your week number was the most accurate.
