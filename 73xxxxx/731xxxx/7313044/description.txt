Hello there!


This is just two folders from original Pack:


1.__metadata;

2.DLC_CON_MP2.

JUST for your modding experiments.

BUT YOU CAN'T ADD WEAPONS in single player. It's worked with Resurgence Pack, but don't work with Rebellion Pack. Don't know why. Community already thinking about how to fix it.

Here is code lines for weapons:

SFXGameContentDLC_CON_MP2.SFXWeapon_AssaultRifle_Cerberus (Cerberus Harrier)
SFXGameContentDLC_CON_MP2.SFXWeapon_Shotgun_Quarian (Reegar Carbine)
SFXGameContentDLC_CON_MP2.SFXWeapon_SniperRifle_Turian (Krysae)

Best Regards.
