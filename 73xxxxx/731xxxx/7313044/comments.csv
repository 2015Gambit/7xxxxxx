,MTeo567,2012-05-30T18:34Z,mmm.. your first upload.
,T[]RK,2012-05-30T18:40Z,"Yeah, my first torrent upload ever. BioWare forced me to do it. Same as slow community did, and slow google search. Sometime need to do thing my myself. So, it's here. =) Hope someone need it."
,MTeo567,2012-05-30T19:31Z,ok. im gonna try this. so i can give a feed.
,dragoon998,2012-05-31T05:39Z,where do you drop the folder in?
,T[]RK,2012-05-31T09:28Z,"Your must drop that folders in ""Mass Effect 3BIOGameDLC""."
,sath123,2012-05-31T17:47Z,"so how do you get the weapons for single player?
where should i go to find out more?
which community?"
,sath123,2012-05-31T17:48Z,PLEASE DO REPLY
,T[]RK,2012-05-31T21:34Z,Just copy and paste code to google. =)
,sath123,2012-06-01T05:32Z,it seems there is a problem with the weapons behavior itself. they are coding a patch for  it this week
,seed513,2012-06-01T21:10Z,"For what is this DLC content useful if Multiplayer is unable on Pirated versions?
Correct me if it's able or it has more weapons and items on singleplayer."
,sath123,2012-06-02T03:54Z,you could add the weapons onto the single player.But the community is yet to give a solution for it.Also there is a server emulator for MP in the works.S this pack is worth downloading now and accessing it later
,thechronic_13,2012-06-02T18:18Z,this is utterly pointless until we are able to play mulitplayer on our cracked copies.
,T[]RK,2012-06-02T21:05Z,It's more usefull to already able to download instead of looking around then your will need it.
,sath123,2012-06-03T15:06Z,t()rk is right.Besides bioware is said to release the mp weapons in form of paid dlc in future for us singleplayers wihich is even worse.Its better to download it now for free
,sath123,2012-06-03T15:07Z,bioware should learn a lesson or two from cd project red
,kaliver,2012-06-04T04:33Z,"yeah, like how to sell millions less games, amirite. "
,sath123,2012-06-04T05:17Z,"that and keeping gamers first priority rather than making money at our expense.None of the witcher2 dlcs are paid.
"
,sath123,2012-06-04T14:18Z,the witcher 2 intially was pc exclusive and had less resource and advertised to lesser extent.If on even terms witcher 2 is lot better and sold much higher than me3 on pc.
,sath123,2012-06-04T14:19Z,Found out the reason the codes are notworking.It seems bioware screwed the dlc so that the files for the weapons are loaded off ea servers when you fire up the mp. STUPID BLOOD SUCKIN IDIOTS
,monkey53,2012-06-07T02:48Z,any luck on trying to fix the problem? also anyone know when there will be a crack for multiplayer?
,Fantomnz,2012-08-19T08:31Z,"The Firefight DLC gives these weapons with the Fix.

(Gamers)"
