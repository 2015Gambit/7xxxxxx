The passive high school boy Aikawa Ayumu gets killed during a spate of mysterious serial killings. However, he is resurrected as a zombie by the necromancer girl Eu, whom he had befriended just before dying. When Ayumu reawakens he is tossed into a world with masou shoujo (magically equipped girls) and vampire ninjas. And of all things, he is assigned the duties of such a masou shoujo by the magical warrior girl Haruna.
Ayumu is still a zombie, chosen (much to his dismay) by Gaia to learn of the dark secrets in the world ΓÇö that should never see the light of day. And so life, as it is, with short-tempered vampire ninja Seraphim, chainsaw-wielding prodigy masou shoujo Haruna, and mute necromancer Eu continues under one roof.
Late after school, to avoid getting sunburned, Ayumu encounters the alcohol-prone fairy Chris. This overly cute adult in a childs body is up to something... life at school could be so peaceful, if it were not for the enemies of the masou shoujo.
