The evil emperor Vosper gathers his troops in the east, poised to conquer the entire continent.

His target is the rebel city of Parthos, a constant thorn in his side, and the last sanctuary of the Dragon Riders. Besieged from all sides, the remaining Dragon Riders come out of hiding. Forced to fight for their lives, they leave the safety of the desert, traveling across the land to gather intelligence and shore up forgotten alliances.

At the center of it all is Elias Dorgumir, the key to an ancient prophesy, and Vosper will do anything to get his hands on him. Is it too late for the Dragon Riders to save Elias and stop Vosper from destroying the only refuge they have left?
