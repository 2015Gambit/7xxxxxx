Any recommendations as to where to start? I see that you up a lot of this style, so any help would be appreciated."
,waqas612,2012-07-13T14:44Z,@darkSilhouette. i would recommend you to start with mystery case files. the first few games. those games were the start of such type of games. very highly recommended...
