Here's the complete May update, and as many of you like in .package, I also included the May package too in this torrent (I will do in this way from now, so you can find both format in the same torrent file!) .sim3pack included too, you can find them in seperate folders. The .sim3pack's decrapified, and rigfixed, of course.

It's a month set, not like shits on TPB (missing items, previous month items,etc), if you want to get ALL the updates released in current month, always take mine. 

So there's a FiXER folder in the torrent, you have to use the .packages inside to get work some new items, which got fucked up, because of the decrapifier. If you do this right, everything is going to work. (see below)

!!!! WARNING !!!! IF YOU'RE GETTING MY SET'S FROM MONTH TO MONTH, YOU MUST DELETE FROM YOUR PACKAGES THE "Lunar_Lakes-Tree_of_Prosperity_(FiX)" (FROM FEBRUARY UPD) BECAUSE THE NEW FIX ALREADY INCLUDES THAT FIX TOO, AND IF YOU KEEP IT, THEY GOING TO CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. !!!!

iNSTRUCTiONS:
--------------
*This fix assumes that ALL affected items are installed the same way*

1)  Everyone will need this file-----KT_StoreFix_Awesome.package
2)  !!!!If you don't use Awesomemod you will also need this file!!!!-----KT_StoreFix_UnAwesome.package
3)  If your premium store content is decrapified (like all of my sets) you need this too-----ccmerged_decrapped.package
4)  Some people can't get the vintage phone work, this package might fix their problems (but all of you should use it)-----PhoneTableMidCModsuite_Script.package

*!!!!If you use packages make sure to put these in your overrides folder, if you use the .sim3pack's put these in your packages folder!!!!*
