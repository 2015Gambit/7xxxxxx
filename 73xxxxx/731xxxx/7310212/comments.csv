,freakinbunny,2012-05-30T00:35Z,"thank you!! my game got boring until I saw your page :) thank yopu, you are making bed rest and been locked in my room for 9 months fun :) thank you"
,freakinbunny,2012-05-30T04:45Z,the icecream maker and deep fryer don't work... they start making them but never eat them....
,freakinbunny,2012-05-30T05:21Z,the tablet does everything but the podcast lol
,Puxes,2012-05-30T06:38Z,"Admz0r, I have one question bro. 
    The Tree of Prosperity Fix file. Is it a Sims3package file? Or .Package file? 
  please Answer, I dont want the 2 to Corrupt. Thanx"
,admz0r,2012-05-30T14:02Z,"Yes the TOP it's in .package ,and you could download it from my february update.

@freakinbunny: read description, or you cant read ,right?"
,JP.JB,2012-06-01T18:57Z,"in the instructions you say we need certain files, those files to fix the bugs are already in the torrent right? or do i need to dowload them from somewere else? "
,JP.JB,2012-06-01T19:06Z,"and one more stupid question, umm all my custom content are in . Sims3package files does those .package files  short circuit each other or they are just for fixes and it doesnt matter?
sorry if its newbie questions but ive had alot of problems with my sims 3 and had to instal it 3 times."
,admz0r,2012-06-02T23:30Z,"@JP.JB: its in the description, ""if you use the .sim3pack's put these in your packages folder!!!!*"" and it fixes what it fixes, its in the description too. (fix for current month items) its in the description too, which .package files you need from Fixer folder to fix your items."

,Micilliaa,2012-06-19T19:24Z,"admz0r
love your torrents, and thanks so much for doing all this :) 
Do you have the ""Pushinâ&#x20AC;&#x2122; Pedals"" or the ""Transport to the Future"" pack things? those bikes and the scooter is so cute :3
Thanks for your time!"

,Cyan_in_slumberland,2012-07-05T22:31Z,"I am sorry to bother :( but I have a little error with the Fiesta pack. 

the ice cream maker and the fryer seems to work but the sims can't serve/or take the food from those objects...is that normal? what should I do? 

thanks for reading. "
,ccinok2,2012-07-08T19:45Z,"okay this may be a dumb question but I just started using torrents very recently! Is this ONLY the store items for May, or is this all the store items that have come out as of May, 2012? Like can I just download the newest one you have out or do I need to download each month? 
Either way, thanks for the lovely torrents! :)"
,M1nt3a,2012-07-14T22:57Z,"I have all the store updates (1-35) up til April 2012. Since the Tip Top Toddler Collection contains items I already have, will this cause duplicate items or glitches in my game? I intend to use the .package files since .sims3paks are nightmares >_<

@ccinok2: I'm pretty sure this is only the May update. It' just very big."
