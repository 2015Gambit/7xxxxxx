,TitanBoy,2012-06-07T14:48Z,"@tr108 - Can you please do the Pixar Short films collection in iTunes/AppleTV format.......???
Atleast 2 or 3 films....??"
[T],tr108,2012-06-07T15:40Z,"@P0RTUGA - I will try, but no promises. Subs take a lot of manual intervention (finding them, making sure they sync up) and all these subs (as I feared) are starting to get out of hand...

@VladDj123 - I really appreciate the kind words and glowing review."
