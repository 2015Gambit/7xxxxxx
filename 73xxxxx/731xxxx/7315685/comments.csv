[V],Zen_Bud,2012-06-08T08:56Z,@Cyberdexter Please troll somewhere else!
,kkuhle,2012-06-16T23:26Z,"@Cyberdexter The quality on this for 1.21 gb is amazing.  If you are expecting flawless 1080p quality don't download a small sized rip, go get something that's 10 gb that will take all your bandwidth & hard drive space. Most people want something that's this size with the best possibly quality and it down't get any better than this. Thanks Zen_Bud, keep it up, you're awesome!
