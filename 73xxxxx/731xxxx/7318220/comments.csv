,Richy2012,2012-06-01T12:08Z,"It doesnt work with retail multi lang dvd. I updated it then copied the crack folder contents, ran exe and nothing happens. This is so frustrating :("
,Mooneg,2012-06-01T12:15Z,"can login,but pc freezes when i press Enter ""to play"""
,Richy2012,2012-06-01T12:21Z,does not work with retail multi dvd release :(
,nicklas1015,2012-06-01T12:33Z,"Mohahaa, for me it works, i am on chapter one now...
Just read instructions once more and you will be fine.

Install the disks, run the game like normal, then after the game started, close it, apply crack, start it, log in, PLAY"
,starkwong,2012-06-01T12:37Z,"It DOES work with the multi dvd release.
Before patching, update the game first (by pressing left button after running PlayMaxPayne3.exe)
After patching, you will be asked to recover key, type any number in the text field and it will proceed.
A rockstar social club account is still needed to get pass the login screen (after login, press ESC to start the game)"
,dubai1991,2012-06-01T12:53Z,not starting
,Varvarix,2012-06-01T13:17Z,it freezes in the starting scene
,XHaloXX,2012-06-01T14:51Z,"just wait for a scene release, the size of this game is huge, the scene release might be more optimized and smaller."
,XHaloXX,2012-06-01T14:52Z,"@maxpier69 And @gamer450rl

dont spam you stupid motherfuckers, Dont download that crap they are posting, all of them are fake and viruses."
,Quadeee,2012-06-01T16:30Z,"It's working :) Thx
And for those who doesn't work,make sure you've completed all steps ;)"
,amirrazorrr,2012-06-01T20:10Z,somebody please upload the fucking game with update and crack and everything needed in one torrent.
,JohnMirror7,2012-06-01T20:31Z,"I followed all the steps to the letter but when I'm trying to login into my account always says: ""Please ensure you have internet access and try again"".
I have, of course, in my firewall MaxPayne3.exe is set as exception but I tried even without firewall - same problem...

Any ideas...?
Thank you in advance."
,sofijaBG,2012-06-01T20:53Z,doesn't start
,JohnMirror7,2012-06-01T22:10Z,"Well, I found a solution, but I can't say I like it 100%: I tried in Windows 7 (until now I was trying in Windows XP). I know that XP is old but still...
Anyway the game is ""hungry"" for Ram memory (my 4 GB is barely enough)...
And it's definitely different from 1 and 2 (and not in a good way). Glad I haven't bought the game, so far it seems that it isn't worth the money."
,oct0momporn,2012-06-02T02:42Z,"this looks suspicious, to say the least"
,Speedy210,2012-06-03T09:06Z,"I can't get past Rockstar login... Why? I cracked it and nothing changed when i start the game. 
Pls help !! I really want to play this game already!!!"
,Chaoz6,2012-06-03T13:44Z,Me too stuck at login idk what to do anymore did everything mentioned T_T
,winston26,2012-06-03T16:29Z,"Using ""MULTI 10"" retail DVD copy. Had some trouble with various cracks, however this one worked. You have to make sure you do NOT block in your firewall settings. It will ask you to activate, type anything in the activation window (I put ""activated""). Then login to social club (you must create an account at socialclub.rockstargames.com). Hit escape and the game will start."
,Nortonko,2012-06-04T00:04Z,The game crashes to desktop without an error during the first cutscene around the time Max opens the door. Any ideas on what I should do?
,robez,2012-06-04T13:54Z,"So,should i let it update when the instalation is done?"
,AddictedBuddy,2012-06-04T17:11Z,"Guys Need Help

PLEASE HELP GUYS"
,n3kr0,2012-06-05T02:28Z,"well, after 10 tries of pure frustrastion, tried this crack, overwrite everything, and new step, new wall, 11th frustrastion, goes into the black screen of trademarks an shit... and... windows again, dead end. Really considering giving up. I installed everything offline, and blocked every possible maxpayne3 file, dead fucking end."
,n3kr0,2012-06-05T02:43Z,"I used this one after not being ablรงe to do a regular shit with blackbox version, now it goes beyond the trademark screen, back to windows... i'm one day to give up..."
