Great news for everyone who missed out on connecting their 3.55 CFW PS3s to the PSN,
the team Codename: Rebug has released a simple to install PKG file that will allow you to
once again access the current PSN, and download your missing DLC files, or simply
recover/create a username so you can enable ReactPSN. I am sure over the next couple of
days, many users will be sure to take full advantage of this option. That is, before Sony
catches on and decides to put a stop to it; which may have to wait until after this year's E3
convention, scheduled for June 5th - 7th.
