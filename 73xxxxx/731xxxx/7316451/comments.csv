It had said, a while back:::: 
And I quote:::: 
""â&#x2013; The anime will end its run in TV Tokyo's 6:00 p.m. Tuesday timeslot on March 27. Following March 27, the following episodes will begin to air on TV Osaka's 6:30 p.m. Tuesday timeslot."" 
End of quote.


In short:: Bleach is MOVING FROM One Channel to the Other !!!!!!"
