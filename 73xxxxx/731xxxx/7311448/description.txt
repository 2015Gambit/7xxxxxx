Cyberlink PowerDVD 10 Ultra. Plays DVD and Blu-Ray discs.


 not much to describe here.



 install, go to the tweak pack folder, and run the "disable_all" batch file. the batch file is a script i created to remove updates, upgrade popups, and movie-live crap. It also removes the Blu-Ray region set to allow playing of more than 1 region. Lastly, all the start-up apps are going to be removed when you run this.

thats it. just right-click the file and run as Admin or it won't work.
