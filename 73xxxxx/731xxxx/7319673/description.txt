I bought this book from http://yesnotrick.com/ and it's a scam. I brought this book to you to save your 27$ and too see how 

simple and worthless is this trick. Enjoy!

"IΓÇÖve been studying and performing mentalism for over 10 years and from the very beginning I was looking for a fool-proof 

way to pick up on what a spectator is thinking or what they are about to choose. I found that even only a fifty-fifty 

choice was a remarkably difficult thing to predict consistently. Over the years I bought and developed a whole host of 

different methods that ranged from using psychology or reading body language right through to expensive covert electronics. 

They all had their problems:

Some of them were unreliable ΓÇô they let me increase my chances of being correct but there was still a risk that IΓÇÖd be 

wrong. Needless to say this can be embarrassing ΓÇô but if you are betting on the fact you are correct it can also be 

expensive!
Some of them were too limited ΓÇô they might have let me correctly predict whether a coin was being held in someoneΓÇÖs ΓÇ£LeftΓÇ¥ 

or ΓÇ£RightΓÇ¥ hand ΓÇô but not whether they were thinking of something ΓÇ£HotΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£ColdΓÇ¥.
Others were too indirect ΓÇô they required the spectator writing something down, suspicious moves, or using some prop that 

really distracted from direct mindreading that I wanted to achieve.
I was just about ready to give up on the idea of a direct, repeatable, 100% accurate mind reading effect when I stumbled 

across this new method. I was so excited by its simplicity and reliability that the effect went straight in to my act and 

IΓÇÖve been refining and developing it ever since and have now packaged it into book titled the ΓÇ£Yes/No TrickΓÇ¥."
