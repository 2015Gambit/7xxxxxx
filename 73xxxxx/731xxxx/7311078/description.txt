FuckingDungeon / DungeonCorp - Tegan Tate (2012.05.24 / Office Creep - The Newb)


Looks like Mr. Stone is taking advantage of the poor economy again. His interviewing process and job descriptions are...shall we say...questionable at best. Tegan innocently comes in as part of the rigor of searching for gainful employment. Lee breaks down what he's looking for, and he makes it abundantly clear that he's got dames literally lining up for this position. And believe me, I bet when all is said and done, he'll have "interviewed" them all. Tegan, like many desperate dames searching for a buck, proclaims that she'll do just about anything for a paycheck. But does she have any idea what this Office Creep has in mind?
