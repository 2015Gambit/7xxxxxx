If you don't know already, Kambodge is an outstanding Russian metalcore/rock/alternative band.  It takes time to gather Kambodge's music, so I put this together. 

If you search long enough, you could get all of this without being asked to pay; this is just for your ease ('cause it really is a bitch finding all of it). I'm not sure if I have everything (I doubt it), let me know if anything is missing or if there's something wrong with the upload.
