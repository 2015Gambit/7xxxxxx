,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-30T04:52Z,"@Animby,

Sorry, I don't have it, and from what I've been able t find out, it's been discontinued, 
along with a couple of other Asian languages.

But I'm still looking..."

,jay21285,2012-06-08T06:47Z,Hey Ein I am still having problems with the missing files.  Could it be a problem with the original file still being on my pc and the rosetta stone is using that old one and not this one?  Should I uninstall all rosetta stone german and re download?

I must be doing SOMETHING wrong. 

I went through the process of both Rosetta Stone and the German Preinstalled. However when I open Rosetta Stone I just get this.. 

http://bayimg.com/GapbhAADb 

It moved the language to /Program Files (x86)/ and the software to /Programs Files/.. however it's not loading the language. 

How can I fix this?

Thanks for all your work!!"

If one file you used was a RAR, and one file was an EXE, that's the problem.

I created the EXE files so there would not be any hassle about extraction/activation.

If you DL'd this version of German, then all you need to do is DL this:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe
and extract it you should end up with the file structure shown below.

C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3
and move ALL of the program files there (about 122mb)

C:/Program Files(x86)/Rosetta Stone/content, 
and all the language files go there (about 1.5 GB)

C:/ProgramData/Rosetta Stone
there should be two xml files, DynamicStoredPaths.xml, and Products.xml

Let me know..."

I have extracted this and I cannot seem to figure out how to make it work. I keep getting the 4112 error. Can you explain step by step how to bypass it? Thanks."
