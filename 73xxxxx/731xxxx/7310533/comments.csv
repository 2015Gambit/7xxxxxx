I have been using TPB for many years and although I always read comments, I´ve never bothered to register a user account.

However I was reading your conversation with Mel who uploads the Omnibus and I got the distinct impression that you felt under appreciated for all your hard work with the Eastenders daily episodes.

So I was compelled to sign up and register an account just to say a big thankyou for uploading my daily dose of Eastenders within hours of it airing on the BBC.

I am a Londoner myself living in Spain and thanks to you I can have a little bit of home comfort to remind me of back home.

I also got the impression you might stop uploading so I just want to say you are appreciated and please don´t stop.

I´m sure there are plenty of others like me who appreciate all the work aswell.

Thanks once again.

Soallman!"

Thanks for the comment, and don't worry, I don't plan stopping soon. 

Keep a note pf my email, in case TPB goes off line again. I hear that it has been taken down by the Dutch authorities. They are the last ones that I would have expected to be worried by copyrights. 

I send a copy to a friend in Norway, before I upload to TPB, I can always add more names to the list.

,mich71,2012-05-30T02:19Z,"Mac.Moe  you are so appreciated!!!  if it wasn't for you working your magic and putting up this show, I'm sorry to say but I'd have to leave my beloved Australia and move back to the UK.  I've watched Eastenders since it began and up until a couple of years ago had to make do with being a year behind, but because of you I'm now up to date and my husband has his wife back and the kids have the TV back.  We love you Mac.Moe, keep up the good work.  Sending you lots of appreciation :) "
