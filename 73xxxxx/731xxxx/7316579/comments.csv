I mixed up the episodes, even had a double and one missing - shame on me - mea culpa - etc.

Anyhow it is fixed now. Spread the word ;)

And get this torrent. Simply download it into the same directory you already downloaded to, and it will only download the missing episode(s). The rest is the same content."
,siddy1200,2012-06-18T11:50Z,which was the missing episode? cause I downloaded the rest from a different source and only need that one
,ex4n,2012-08-19T16:57Z,episode 15 is incorrect. it is actually episode 13. there is no episode 15 in this torrent. disappointed.
,ex4n,2012-08-19T17:02Z,"Ignore previous comment, all of my other episodes appeared to be named incorrectly. I believe this torrent to be correct. My bad. Thanks for the upload :)"
,LuckyStrike_01,2012-08-22T11:10Z,Eps 10 and 11 are both 'Missed Connections'. What happened to 'After the Lovin'?
,LuckyStrike_01,2012-08-23T09:37Z,"Ah, here is the proper ep 10: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7184252/Rules_of_Engagement_s06e10_After_the_Lovin"
