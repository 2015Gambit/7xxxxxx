,Smallz94,2012-05-31T07:51Z, What happens if i dont have rgh? WHAT IS A RGH?
,thisguyx811,2012-05-31T08:20Z,@Smallz94 RGH = reset glitch hack = newer way to jtag your console. Games can be played from hard drive and DLC installed without connecting to live.
,Smallz94,2012-05-31T08:50Z,Ohhhh okay. Can you help me how to get that
,thisguyx811,2012-05-31T09:59Z,"@Smallz94 use google, tutorials and maybe youtube, it's a bit complex. You also need to solder 12 or so wires to your xbox motherboard and buy a couple of things."
,flat123456789123456789,2012-05-31T14:44Z,Do I need only disk 1 since I have the original one which I downloaded from you or do I need both disks?
,eternal666,2012-05-31T17:00Z,ya i have the arkam city game can i just burn the dlc and install it? someone please reply
,Smallz94,2012-05-31T19:54Z,"@Eternal66

disc 2 has the dlc but you need both discs to play, you cannot use your old Batman AC to play this new dlc disc 2.

@thisguyx811  yea i am going to ask somebody to do it for lo. Looks pretty hard.."

,Smallz94,2012-06-07T06:18Z,"@silverwolf42

Download the torrent.

There are two files that you will see. Dvd1 and dvd2. It is better to use verbatim dvds double layer. Dont use usb

Run the stealth file which is the ISO file with Abgx360 program so it can verify, check and pass the file and the game data. It is always better to run abgx360 first before you burn the games. 

Dvd1 should say that with green words that it is passed and checked but Dvd2 will say everything is checked except the game data. Idk y but i am guessing that it is a dlc disc. 

Now burn  dvd1 and then dvd2 with IMGburner. Hopefully you dont get any errors because i didn't. "
,fankoosh,2012-06-07T18:19Z,"i already have the old BAC installed into my HDD , i am running LT+2 with latest DB14719 & all latest XGD3 r working fine , now please i need info , do i have to uninstall old BAC in order to play this new one , also do i have to install both disc1 & 2 to play the DLC ? , really help appreciated guys , thanx"

Then it worked!"
,Smallz94,2012-06-09T04:47Z,"@mezo1612 DVD 1

@fankoosh  well Dvd 1 is single player and Dvd 2 is the dlc. Try to download only dvd 2. Idk how but try at least. So if that works by just downloading Dvd 2, you dont have to uninstall your old game.  Hope this helps buddy."
,mezo1612,2012-06-09T15:47Z,"@Smallz94

what is use of dvd 2? what does dlc mean sry"
,Smallz94,2012-06-09T18:15Z,"@mezo1612  dlc mean download content

Once you put in dvd2, it will ask, "" Do you want to install nightwing, robin, catwoman, and other features"" of course there was a choice that said install all. If you install all of it, you will get all the features such as the batman suits,robin, Catwoman, and night wing and more.

,babbleM,2012-06-09T22:43Z,"CAN ANYONE CONFIRM IF THIS WORKS WITH TRUNCATED BURN OR DO YOU GET ""FAILED TO AUTHORIZE DISC"" WITH THE XBOX REBOOT. THANKS IN ADVANCE"
,Smallz94,2012-06-10T00:58Z,@BabbleM. It works with truncate burn. Make sure you run it through abgx360 if you did not do that yet. A lot of ppl are getting errors by not running through that program.

,Pawl0,2012-06-10T22:52Z,@smallz94 - what i need to input (burned or iso)and run in this abgx (what exactly)
,Smallz94,2012-06-11T08:26Z,@Pawl0 run in abgx360 with iso game file and then burn it with the DVD file. Go on YouTube and search how to use abgx360 and how to burn it with IMGburner.  I cant really explain but you can at least watch somebody doing it. Remember there two files such as dvd1 and dvd2. They both have iso and dvd files. First do the dvd1 iso by using abgx360 so it can verify the iso and then use IMGburner to burn the dvd file in dvd1. Pretty simple and do the same thing for Dvd2 file. Hope this help. But just to be sure go on YouTube.  
,Pawl0,2012-06-11T17:19Z,@smallz94 hehe i know how to use imgburn but i never used abgx and since i flashed to lt 3.0 i had 1 error ( with black ops) everything worked
,Pawl0,2012-06-11T17:20Z,will this work on lt 3.0 ? with img burn
,Pawl0,2012-06-11T17:20Z,i have ihas 124 do i need to buy 124b or i can modify mine to have propely burned xgd3 games ?
,Smallz94,2012-06-11T19:30Z,Try to modify to xgd3 games. It is pretty easy to have that and learn how to use abgx360. 
,Pawl0,2012-06-13T18:33Z,heheh u right game works after being abgxed

,fankoosh,2012-06-14T10:16Z,"well thanx for help , i downloaded only DVD2 & applied LT+2 Topology ( patch) to play it on my phat liteon console, as i already have the previous game installed from old dvd , now i run DVD2 & it works with LT+2 topology & it ask me to insatll DLC , so i installed some of DLC , now to play the game i return to my old previous dvd to play it , but it didnt show any option to play the DLC content !!!! , so now i guess i have to download & patch & burn new DVD1 in this torrent so i can run & play the DLC , or if anyone have a diff idea please suggest , thanx"

When i put the disc in my xbox It keeps saying it requires an update and then gets about 80% of the way thru updating then stops and says dirty disc please clean, but its a brand new disc.  everyone is saying use abgx360. i have never used this before but i did and everything seemed to work ok. All green writing etc then it did the download and said hit any key to finish. Then im at a loss as to what to do??? Do i go back to the file my original iso came from and its now been patched? I tried this reburned it but still the same result. Disc one (the game itself) worked perfectly without agbx360. I have watched youtube tutorials but i still cant figure it out.

After you run disc 2 through abgx,go back to the original folder of the game (yes its been patched) and burn the DVD file and not the ISO. Also.. the second disc(dlc) will not work without the Game of the year edition."
