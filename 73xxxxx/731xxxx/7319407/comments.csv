,oneshout33,2012-06-02T10:53Z,"torrent clean but keygen don't work with this version..--> ""you don't have a genuine product key"""
,oneshout33,2012-06-03T17:17Z,"ok, after some try, working for me but :

To avoid the online check, block the app either with a firewall (recommended) or add the following line to your hosts file (located in WindowsSystem32driversetc) :

 127.0.0.1 secure.tune-up.com 

Then use keymaker to register the application!   

 If you've already accidentally let the app phone home and got yourself blacklisted, delete the following key from your registry and use another key from the keygen. 

x86: 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREClasses 
CLSID{64A3D41B-61A5-4834-9A42-FDE1C37B0009}] 
x64: 
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREClasses 
Wow6432NodeCLSID{64A3D41B-61A5-4834-9A42-FDE1C37B0009}] 

Working fine now"
