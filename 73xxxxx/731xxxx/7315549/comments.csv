,razeke,2012-06-01T07:40Z,Can this complete a WEI test? Can it update properly? Does it show preview thumbnails?
,nileshtambe,2012-06-01T10:18Z,"WEI test is not possible windows media player and codec with winsat removed

no update as winsxs reduced to 210 mb by vlite it breaks update

it does have preview thumbnails
in previous version 1,2,3 i removed it not in this one"
,razeke,2012-06-02T12:00Z,"Some suggestions:

Maintain WEI. This allows the system to recognise you have a SSD.

Integrate key performance post-SP1 updates. Such as KB 2581464. Maybe even a completely updated version. (I think you have to apply updates before removing any components)

Integrate redistributables needed on pretty much every single system. Such as visual c++ 2005, 2008, 2010 SP1, Direct X, slim .NET 4, Flash, Shockwave, Silverlight. (extra ~70mb)

Make your ISO UEFI/GPT bootable. Copy efi/microsoft/boot contents into efi/boot and extract bootmgfw.efi from install.wim and also put that into efi/boot and rename it to bootx64.efi (extra 4.5mb)"

,razeke,2012-06-05T05:51Z,I know this because I have to use a replay gain of +10db now instead of 5db and I have to turn speakers right up for skyrim now when before it will only be turned up a few bars.

,razeke,2012-08-07T11:32Z,Can't turn on pagefile on this version. So Ghost Recon and Prototype 2 don't work.
