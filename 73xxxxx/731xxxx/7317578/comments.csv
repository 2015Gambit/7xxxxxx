Sorry, But I don't know about you problem. Because I was successfully installed it and played it without problems.  "
,HakitoJin,2012-08-12T03:29Z,"artimb, there is a file named readme_en.html in the folder.
Copy and paste that file 5 times, and change the name of all those copies into:

readme_de.html
readme_es.html
readme_fr.html
readme_it.html
readme_us.html

It should finish installing now, and yes, you can alt-tab to do this."
