As with all Rifftrax movies if you want the original theatrical, re-mastered, or re-re-mastered Blu-Ray versions of Star Wars then this is not the torrent you are looking for...

It's Binks-ian fun for the whole family as George Lucas empties the contents of his brain onto film one more time! This go around, the part of the annoying kid is explored more deeply by a new annoying kid, Hayden Christensen, in a performance so jaw-droppingly wooden and laughable itΓÇÖs got to make Keanu Reeves feel pretty darned good about himself.
Ewan McGregor returns as that one guy who was once played by that other British guy, and heΓÇÖs apparently become comfortable enough with his green screen acting that he no longer even pretends it matters whether he puts in effort or not. And returning for the role of Padme Amidala is Natalie Portman, looking cute but losing her bid to keep her voice from grinding into her audienceΓÇÖs skull like a buzz saw.
All of this would be a RiffTrax dream come true ΓÇô but making it even dream come true-ier is that Mike and Kevin are joined by none other than Chad Vader, brother of Darth and star of his own colossally successful internet series. It is quite simply a RiffTacular RiffStravaganza!
