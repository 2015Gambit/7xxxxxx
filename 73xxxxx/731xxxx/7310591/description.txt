Mountains and Water ΓÇô ΓÇ£I would unhesitatingly recommend this film to anyone who cares about the sport of climbing, even those who donΓÇÖt boulder. At an hour and a half, plus some excellent bonus material, Western Gold offers a voyage of discovery that few other films can match.ΓÇ¥

Lloyd Climbing ΓÇô ΓÇ£The entire film has been meticulously crafted with an attention to detail unmatched in other bouldering filmsΓÇªAlmost all bouldering films have at least one song, scene, or story that I find distracting or annoying, but this one doesnΓÇÖt. It renews my hope for the genre.ΓÇ¥"
