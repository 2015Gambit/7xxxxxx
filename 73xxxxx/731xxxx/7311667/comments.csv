,biggybo,2012-05-30T20:49Z,there seems to be an audio delay? 
[V],Nepotu,2012-05-30T23:01Z,Yes it is! 1000 ms (1 sec.) delay. I use BSPlayer and with Ctrl+Shift+Left arrow can be fixed.
,biggybo,2012-05-31T01:04Z,"thanks alot for specifying that it was a 1000ms delay, i was able to change the audio settings in my player (media player classic) and now its perfect! :D "
