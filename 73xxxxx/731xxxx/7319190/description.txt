Metropolis was a little known Argentinian band that formed in Rosario at an unknown time, and released this demo (or album, I'm not sure which it is) in 2006. According to the one site I found it on.

They combine influences from Dream Theater and Symphony X (who they covered often during their shows), Presto Vivace, neoclassical, and power metal - creating some of the most unique and creative music I've heard yet.

Artists:
Daniel Marquez - Drums
Bruno Perine - Bass
Emiliano Bracamonte - Guitars
Diego Palma - Keys
Martin Puntonet - Vocals
