After Chicken Little causes widespread panic when he mistakes a falling acorn for a piece of the sky--the young chicken is determined to restore his reputation. But just as things are starting to go his way, a real piece of the sky lands on his head. Chicken Little and his band of misfit friends, Abby Mallard (aka Ugly Duckling), Runt and Fish Out of Water, attempt to save the world without sending the town into a whole new panic.
