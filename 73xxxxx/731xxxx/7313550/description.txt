Brandi and her husband are getting evicted by their landlord, Mike. Apparently Mike's brother needs a place to stay and Mike's decided to throw out his longtime tenants in order to accommodate him. Seeing as her inept husband is incapable of negotiating a deal, Brandi takes it upon herself to pay Mike a visit and make him an offer he can't refuse.
