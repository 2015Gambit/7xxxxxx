Encoders Notes: As far as I am aware there is no proper Line Audio for this film when I encoded it, as such the audio is from a cam's mic and hence not amazing. Video is great DVD quality and the audio certainly makes the film watchable. Beware the film goes oos slightly here and there during the film.
