These are all composed/recorded/performed by myself (T. Jayson) with exception to the two tracks featuring Tk The Prophet.

I've worked long and hard on these songs for nothing other than the joy of creating music and listening to a finished product.

All of these songs were produced/recorded in various locations in Iraq and Kuwait while I was on deployment.

If you'd like to get a hold of me, even for nothing more than to tell me how you enjoyed the songs (Which is always awesome to hear), all contact details are below.
