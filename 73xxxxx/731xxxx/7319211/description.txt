Plot: David A.R. White (Jerusalem Countdown, Me Again), Victoria Jackson (Saturday Night Live), Reginald VelJohnson (Family Matters, Die Hard), Jackee Haley (Sister, Sister & 227) and Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) star in this heartwarming fish out of water comedy about an associate pastor at a rich mega church in California who finds himself the pastor of poor African American church in the worst neighborhood in Atlanta. James White (White) is one of dozens of associate pastors at a rich mega church in Southern California under the tutelage of television evangelist Johnny Kingman (Wise). He always longed to have his own church and jumps at the opportunity to become pastor of the impoverished Divine Faith Apostolic Church in Atlanta. His wife and two children aren’t very enthusiastic about his assignment. Neither is the congregation itself, but they will have learn to trust each other and pull together to save the church from a corrupt banker anxious to foreclose. It will take a musical miracle, supplied by BeBe Winans himself, to save them all in this heartfelt, family-friendly comedy.
