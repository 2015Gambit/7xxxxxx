Freedom is not free, it is something you fight for every day. 

You sat on your ass and did nothing when they started intercepting all your traffic. You are no longer allowed privacy. For national security you ask? Nope. Just some company that owns a film camera.

Next step: A cctv camera in your bedroom. 

To protect your children from abuse of course...
And if you are against it you have something to hide. You must be a molester. Right?

Be sure to vote for puppet A from corporation X to run your country. LOL."
