[V],globeplus,2012-05-30T16:04Z,HI and this comment is to make the quick note that the dolphin version is 3.0-683 that means the latest available by today on the emulator latest releases .
[V],globeplus,2012-05-30T19:03Z,"Hi again and i have a story for this file that it is from me the 4th work in succession for the fantastic Resident Evil series , after the latest Operation Raccoon City for 2.5 gb , Resident Evil 5 for 3.25 gb and resident Evil 4 for 1.02 gb :

More than an year ago i maded a file for this game with love from this game series that was presented with 3 gb , at that moment in time the only iso that i got was a single iso encrypted with almost no compression and because was a gamecube game wasn´t possible to work on the wii tools like many other wii games that work nice on the Dolphin emulator and recently i found out the game perfect but the isos in a different style , in the case in 2 very common 1.36 gb gamecube  isos  , of course that was still not possible work with the wii tools but with an advantage this time : because the isos are straight common gamecube isos , the Gamecube tools worked vey well and preparing the 2 discs for the fantastic compression was easy , the final result is the complete game untouched in anyway for a little more size than half size from the first presented work , on my first file i uploaded with 3 gb and thanks to this new isos with correct compression preparation was possible to drop this great resident evil game to an amazing 1.6 gb ... to be completly happy with the work on this file was the correct and appropriate use of the emulator commandline that let me presented the file in a great style with an archive extractor followed by running the game immediatly in fullscreen and if that not enough , it was possible to add 2 executables , 1 for each game disc that launch the game quickly without launching the emulator and select the game like it is the emulator normality , so depend on the disc that you are currently playing in a second after get to the game folder it is game going like normally happen on the pc games giving a pratical personality to this emulated gamecube game ...

I hope all the users like this carefull and positive work and no doubt that this games series is one of the best of his kind (survival horror games) and i am shore that all of us hope more new games for this series in the near future possible ...

Happy game to all of you ."
,KingDareal,2012-05-30T22:24Z,Hey globe i want to make a autorun version of Skyrim and some other games can u make skyrim or show me how to please
[V],globeplus,2012-05-30T23:39Z,"Skyrim is 5 gb and full of users to help , you don´t need a pratical file , on the mentionated game any pratical file can looks like be killing the game and i don´t want to take that risk ... i think the game deserve to look like alive ... it is a matter of principle and about compressions with 7zip or freearc you have 2 excelent options for compressing games ... have fun and happy gaming to you ... "
,KingDareal,2012-05-31T01:14Z,So all i have to do is take the game folder and compress it with Freearc or 7zip then i can run it off a Flash Drive like your game. It isnt just Skyrim i wanted to make NBA 2k11 also please reply thank you for the info you already gave me.
[V],globeplus,2012-05-31T09:53Z,"To kingdareal : ok my friendly user i can help you with that : for the mentionated game (NBA 2k11) the file structure it is much more prepared for a 7zip compression than for freearc , in each game you have to check how the capacity of the compressors for doing the work, maybe you don´t work everything that it is possible like i probably do on my game files but with this compressors the final size of the games generally speaking it will be positively less and with that maybe the possibility depending on the game , to record as data in very common 4.7 gb discs or like you refered the flash drive transportation that certainly it is less space occupied on the flash drive and you have the complete game anyway after a normal extraction , i am saying that you can do all the hard work that sometimes it is possible to do pratical games files but certainly with that compressors you can have the games fully available easily for more convenient sizes and this thinking have more expression after 5 , 10 , 20 games on the hard drive and you don´t play all of them at the same time ...

see you and happy gaming to you ."
