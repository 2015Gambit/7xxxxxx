But still a nice download. Thanks, BOZX!

Can someone upload the 3D version?
And in 1080p?

Thanks in advance!"
,MrDerrrp,2012-05-31T20:09Z,"Hey Whatami12, why dont you ask the uploader to rub your back too or maybe make you a nice bag lunch. I have the 3d version right here

,tpboss,2012-06-01T05:10Z,Wow really? A downloader absolutely has the right to complain when something isn't as advertising. Good to know you advocate lying or at least disregarding the truth.

,Aim_To_Maim,2012-06-01T14:59Z,"@tpboss Guess what, I'm a downloader and I have the right to complain about your inability to correctly use a fucking noun =) Who gives a fuck if its not 3D, 3D is shit anyway! "
,tpboss,2012-06-02T08:10Z,Lol wow. Simmer down troll. Sorry I made a mistake. I don't care about 3D either nothing in the movie would've benefited from it. It was a nice movie but kinda un-diversified...it was only about this one little island. But very interesting none the less.
,MrDerrrp,2012-06-03T02:40Z,lol we are all so stupid. 
,Kara-kan,2012-06-11T13:47Z,"So, is this 2D or 3D????
Uploaders mustn't state false data on the upload form, must they?"
,sherbetty,2012-08-09T10:53Z,"It says 'Content is 2D' just above the comments..I was looking for the 2D version anyhow...I do agree with the others, it should be labelled 2D, since thats what I was searching for. Lucky I found it due to people whinging and complaining :P"
