Can anyone point me to a resource to decode the source info:

Source Video....: RC Bluray (thanks)
Source Audio....: Hive-CM8 (thanks awesome line)

I don't see those specifications listed in the movie source thread in the forums (https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=35621).

Thanks!"

RC â&#x20AC;&#x201C; Blu-ray Discs use a a simpler region-code system with only 3 regions, labeled A, B, and C.
- Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus the Republic of China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan and Korea
- Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.
- Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as the Peopleâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;s Republic of China and Russia.

I'm guessing that the audio was taken from an earlier CAM release."
