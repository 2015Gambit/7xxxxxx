Stop posting abusive comments on other uploaders torrents.
I have now deleted a number of your inappropriate comments.

Also, the AVG anti-virus software that you appear to be running, generates more false positives than any other brand of AV software.
If you want to accuse other uploaders of having trojans or viruses in their torrents, you need to switch to some better AV software first."
