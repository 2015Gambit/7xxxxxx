,Yamcha67,2012-06-02T02:55Z,"This is taking ages, someones gotta finish seeding, I'm the only one sharing my portion currently.. I'm stuck at 63%"
,didi.mozhi,2012-06-02T03:20Z,is it worth downloading?
,muffbuffer69er,2012-06-02T05:35Z,"stop being so pissy,and bitchy about how long it takes , and if you want the only one that works on the pirate bay for mac you tell me is it worth it ???, so just be patient and let it FUCKIN DOWNLOAD. be more great full that i took the time for you guys, to share this great game !!!"
,Yamcha67,2012-06-02T07:37Z,"It's actually available to download on warez websites, except the file sharing hosts suck.. The person who originally shared it is MOJADO..

While I'm thankful your sharing it, despite the fact that I have no idea if this game is any good.. I think I have the right to complain about people not seeding.. "
,WinterGale,2012-06-02T08:44Z,Its not the issue whether people are seeding or not...its whether someone was finally able to finish the download...it's a 6.24GB game with 49 leechers and 1 seeder (the uploader). So just be patient and for someone to be able to finish the download.
,Grapeflavouredpop,2012-06-02T23:00Z,Someone finished! 2 seeders. currently at 96.6 % thanks for the upload. 
,Grapeflavouredpop,2012-06-02T23:03Z,Scratch that. 1 seeder still -___- .

,Grapeflavouredpop,2012-06-03T01:34Z,WHERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS?? 
,muffbuffer69er,2012-06-03T01:48Z,"you must be new to this , extract file with password ,then extract again with out password, (PASSWORD IN RTF FILE) , THEN PLACE IN APP FOLDER, OR JUST PLAY FROM WHERE ITS EXTRACTED ."
,Yamcha67,2012-06-03T02:07Z,"I can confirm this game works, I'll seed for a day.. I have bandwidth limit so can't really do it forever..

Also gotta say though the game isn't that great.. "
,Grapeflavouredpop,2012-06-03T02:24Z,Yes i got it to work. thanks. But there is a problem with the mouse :/
,muffbuffer69er,2012-06-03T02:37Z,"BEST TO HAVE A REGULAR 2 BUTTON MOUSE WITH SCROOL  , THATS WHAT I HAVE AND IT WORKS FINE , ALSO HARD TO PLAY WITH OUT ONE ."
,Grapeflavouredpop,2012-06-03T02:37Z,"Nvm. Just a fresh restart was all it needed. Game is working 100% perfect, no lag. Other than that the game is SOOOOOOOO amazing. "

,de_Kuijer,2012-06-03T16:40Z,"Yeah I thought it might be that so i tried a few: better zip, Stuffit (didn't unpack properly), UnrarX and The Unarchiver.
If you have any suggestions as to a particular unpack app that would be great."

,VsDbIb,2012-06-04T09:42Z,i transfered the game to my brothers mac which has never used steam in the past. it worked. i think this game will not work in macs which have used steam the past. i hope someone finds a way for it to run on macs which have used steam.
,VsDbIb,2012-06-04T09:45Z,"and guys, if you are thinking of downloading cracks and changing the game files i'm sorry to say that it doesn't work. i tried downloading cracks form skidrow's website and changing the game files. but i had no luck in running the game. the steam error is gone but the game still doesnt open up"
,muffbuffer69er,2012-06-05T06:18Z,i have steam installed and it works for me !!!

,DEsnakeater,2012-06-11T00:20Z,password isn't working for me D:
,gmodm1,2012-06-16T06:08Z,*sigh* lets just forget about this torrent and move on
,joaolonas,2012-06-18T16:40Z,"Ok, so there were two try outs for this game already. one had the password requirement on app store, the other steam issues.

Ok. END HERE. i will stop seeding. i did my duty. ill wait for third try."
,Kev0h,2012-08-22T08:30Z,"Works perfect GREAT TORRENT! I think the reason some people are having a problem is because they have a ""Steam"" app. I don't so it played straight through no errors. "
