In this long-awaited autobiography, one of the most beautiful women in the world tells her story, from growing up on a mink ranch in Newfoundland with six brothers and sisters to raising two children with a rock star in Beverly Hills. One of the most popular and best-known Playboy pin-ups ever, Shannon Tweed burst on the scene in the 80s as Playmate of the Year and Hugh Hefner's love interest. She soon became a successful actress, appearing in countless movies and television series. She met Gene Simmons at a party at the Playboy Mansion, and they lived happily ever after with their two children, Nick and Sophie. Told in her own straightforward, no-holds-barred style, Kiss and Tell is a backstage pass to life at the Playboy Mansion, a behind-the-scenes view of one of the biggest rock stars in the world, and the experience of raising two kids in front of the camera.
