,LOKI_LOKI,2012-08-13T09:18Z,"Thanks for the great upload.  Installed and working.  I have just two questions for you.

Is it possible for you to get the Clarion 1.3 (2.5) Update which was just released on July 20th?

The area where the Clarion Logo gets placed (no matter where it's located) has a little colored square which changes color with the color selected.  Do you know how to remove the little colored square?  I've tried finding the css code to remove it but have been unsuccessful.

Thanks again for the great work!"
,oneway2k,2012-08-14T01:19Z,Thanks for Clarion. Can you upload RT Momentum? Many thanks.
