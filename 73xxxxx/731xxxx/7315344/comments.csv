,disnfab,2012-06-01T13:04Z,I've decided that I will no longer upload DooL but I will if for some reasons jmanwf can't. I will continue GH.
,Dimmis80,2012-06-01T14:08Z,Ok mate but at least if @jmanwf desides to stop for good uploading days will u go to upload days to a regular bases..!??And btw why u deside to upload GH and not days.My humble opinion days is the best soap around and it totaly worth your time and your efforts.!
,disnfab,2012-06-01T14:31Z,"Nobody on tpb is uploading GH & I enjoy that soap very much (like Y&R, B&B & DooL lol!). I find that uploading both tv shows is a bit too much work especially when there is someone uploading one of them. Don't you worry, I will do my best to upload DooL if we don't have jmanwf."
