MsFenmore, first of all THANK YOU VERY MUCH for uploading B&B. I don't know what some of us would do if it weren't you.
another thing which I was afraid to ask - can you give me your email somehow, I mean without anyone seeing it? or better way, I will give you mine and then if you don't mind, write me yours.
filqnkishiq@yahoo.com
I will be waiting... "
