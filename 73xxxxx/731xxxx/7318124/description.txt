Description 

The Ice Road Truckers are back on the road in Season 6, unknowing of the icy and treacherous path their fate will lead them down this time around. For two months out of the year during the past several decades, truckers have been carrying vital equipment through the world's most dangerous tundras to remote outposts located hundreds of miles north of civilization. They must complete their mission down roads created by temporary frozen bodies of water before their only truckable terrain disolves into the sea. Examining this time-honored, often family-run traditional profession, our truckers continue the race against elements, time and each other in the hopes of hauling in the biggest prize.
