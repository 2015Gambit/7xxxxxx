This is normal behavior, as the level is building during this phase, including procedural texture generation. It may take a couple minutes on some computers. This is something we plan to fix in the near future."
,mrepic37,2012-05-31T08:58Z,"I went to the direct download, and my heart sank when the site was down. Now, I have the biggest erection."
,Killiwana,2012-05-31T09:18Z,"Thanks for making this f2p. I know your only a 2 man team, but if you keep listening to the constructive feedback and the community, this game could be the next Minecraft. 

Thanks guys."
,Sayko222,2012-05-31T09:53Z,Does the game start in window mode ? Or a launcher to choose the resolution from ? 
,Keshlan,2012-05-31T10:25Z,"@Sayko222

It should have a launcher to choose from."
,Iitus,2012-05-31T10:30Z,"thank you very much for making this amazing project available

will seed to at least 100 copies, possibly much more if there's need"
,pizzanice,2012-05-31T10:58Z,Haven't played yet but I love your attitude towards your project and for that I intend to seed at full capacity for as long as I can. Keep up the good work.
,Keshlan,2012-05-31T11:37Z,"I hope everyone seeds for a while, Seeding is good for the heart!"
,Ghando,2012-05-31T13:59Z,"Downloaded starforge from your site but just came here to seed it.

It looks GREAT!"
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-05-31T14:09Z,This game is fucking awesome! it's much better than minecraft in my opinion.
,SirQuilI,2012-05-31T14:54Z,Oh my god this thing is fucking amazing.
,NormalNorwigianGuy,2012-05-31T15:32Z,"Awsome game!!! And it's only the Alpha, can't wait till the real deal."
,BooDaddy,2012-05-31T15:43Z,"SWEET! I am gonna seed the shit out of this for you guys! I will have it on my 4 MBit pipe, running 24x7 to help out."
,bryk,2012-05-31T17:18Z,"Just watched a video on Starforge, I think you just made the impossible happen -a minecraftlike game with excellent graphics!"
,psimon,2012-05-31T18:00Z,if this comes out anything like the description you gave ill be amazed and seed forever
,Brandonx187,2012-05-31T18:32Z,Just a white screen for me...
,Brandonx187,2012-05-31T18:37Z,"Okay well I just noticed the first comment about the white screen which is fine but the game is horribly optimized and my $2,000 PC struggles to run it.

I'll try again when it's optimized better."
,AdrenaLiNv2,2012-05-31T19:04Z,"@Brandonx187 
check the forums (forgeforumsDOTcom), this is v0.100, meaning it's the first version, that's why the authors named it ""Very Early Alpha Version"". Run the game in ""Fast"" or ""Fastest"" mode to get at least 50 fps, they'll start fixing those issues soon, be patient."
,invenemy,2012-05-31T21:31Z,"Sounds awesome :O
I will try it right away :D"
,PlagueMachine,2012-06-01T00:44Z,"Started playing and it doesn't run perfectly on my computer, but even so is pretty cool. I am really excited to see where this game will go in the future after more content is added and it is optimized."
,Keshlan,2012-06-01T03:30Z,"@PlagueMachine
I have a great computer and it doesnt run well either. Its because its the early alpha version."
,Keshlan,2012-06-01T10:06Z,"@ironymon

It's the perfect balance :)"
,scyris99,2012-06-01T10:57Z,"Inever even heard of Starforge till now, I did hear about Starbound though. Will post bug reports if I find any which probally will happen as this is a early alpha."
,scyris99,2012-06-01T10:58Z,"Don't like the idea of it being f2p though, too much nickle and diming has been going on in the f2p scene, I'd rather it be buy 2 play, this way its modable by the community."
,scyris99,2012-06-01T11:03Z,I do hope the game is more Terraria and less mindcraft cuz I found minecraft boring as watching crap ferment on the sidewalk.
,samerdl,2012-06-01T12:15Z,"i just saw a trailer for this game, it looks like Minecraft but looks actually FUN to play!! does it have multiplayer tho?? Thanks for Free to play! "
,Shabbster,2012-06-02T02:39Z,"I was just browsing along TPB when I saw this on the front page of PC games section.  Checked out the youtube video and I was stunned.  Thanks for the f2p and I will keep following your progress as time passes.
-Best wishes, Shabby"
,mastima,2012-06-02T02:57Z,"Loads the level, can run around for a minute then black screens till I close and reopen the program. Game looks reallllly fun though, can't wait for later versions. Will keep on computer for future updates :) Happy programming Keshlan and team!"
,kingbroken,2012-06-02T11:27Z,I find the controls to be hard and a bit buggy. And how do i play it with my friends?
,Keshlan,2012-06-02T14:29Z,"@kingbroken
Its the Alpha Version .100
Not all features are included that where shown in the trailers."
,MitchAllen,2012-06-02T16:49Z,To me it looks like a high tech version of minecraft with a scifi twist. That's a good thing looks good.
,genjutsu01,2012-06-05T20:40Z,"Extracted, and it will not run at all, crashes on launch, since all that was done was a simple extract, it shows that the torrent itself is fucked. Dont bother with it."
,ProphetZarquon,2012-06-13T07:37Z,"I also hope there are some options for community content creation.  Seeding and will continue to seed until a newer version is posted.

Made with Unity 3D!  Awesome suite (FREE) also apparently making awesome games.  I'm loving the StarForge Alpha so far!

Notes:
1)  Can't dig or tunnel upward!
2)  Can't destroy Built objects.
3)  Gun but no Axe?  Cut does no damage?  Could E-Cut damage/remove objects?
4)  I'm wishing I could open the Project for this in Unity 3.4.2f3 right now..."
,Sulphus,2012-06-27T09:54Z,"Well damn! You weren't kidding bout the early alpha, but please do keep up the good work! This game looks very promising, I quite enjoyed giving it a look. I wish you the best of luck in further development!"
,Sulphus,2012-06-27T09:56Z,Also~ Will be sure to seed plenty!
,DudeJr,2012-07-22T23:50Z,"I'm downloading the game from the site atm, but gonna DL the torrent tomorrow as wel and seed just to help you spread it faster!  The game seems to have a LOT of promise, more so than minecraft.

but the question is, how much modding power will you give th community when it it more in the late stages of development.
Modding was one of the major reasons MC was such a big hit"
