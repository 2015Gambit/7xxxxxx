Untamed Australia Season 1
Untamed Australia is an unusual and colourful wildlife documentary series that provides a unique account of the bizarre animals living in the wetlands, islands, deserts, and Outback of Australia, the 'Island Continent'. The series was filmed over a number of years by some of the best wildlife filmmakers, mainly on location in the Australian Outback and nature reserves in different parts of the country. 
By using the best camera techniques available, including static, hidden cameras, underwater cameras and special night equipment, 

The series follows families of Dingoes, Kangaroos, Koalas, Camels and Crocodiles over a period of time, showing their development, family structure, feeding habits and survival strategies. Each animal is a link in the food chain and this series shows both natural beauty and cruelty.
Untamed Australia provides more than ten hours of amazing footage of some of the most amazing and bizarre creatures in the world. Only in Australia do we find such a rich variety of marsupials, reptiles, birds and mammals not found anywhere else on earth.
No interviews with scientists, no CGI graphics, no re-enactments or unnecessary background info - just ten hours of animals in their natural habitats, without a single human in sight.
