NOTES
Used NoGRP TS audio and beginning video clip, and Logo Spanish cam -
thanks a lot!! :)
Used video from Logo Spanish cam, but it was missing beginning
2:29 min so I encoded an avi clip of NoGRP and included separate from main
movie file. OK, now the NoGRP audio was missing some scenes that were
censored off the China version, so I edited those scenes in using Spanish
audio so it wouldn't just be silent. The Spanish audio scenes are only
during first 15 min and the very end scene that was missing from NoGRP.
It simply wouldn't stay in sync and had to be fixed about every 2 min
so I spent 4 days on that. It goes very slightly OOS a couple times but
it's not too bad. Video is a bit bright and sometimes a bit out of focus.
And the beginning clip I made from NoGRP's copy goes a bit oos. I hope that
you like this v1 of Men In Black 3 I made to share with you until the next
version is out ;)
