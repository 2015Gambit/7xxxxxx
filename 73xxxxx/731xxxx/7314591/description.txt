You Were My Everything by Aviation MP3 uploaded by Ashes

 Lyrics :

 [Talking:] 
 This goes out to someone that was
 Once the most important person in my life
 I didnΓÇÖt realize it at the time
 I canΓÇÖt forgive myself for the way I treated you so
 I donΓÇÖt really expect you to either
 ItΓÇÖs just... I donΓÇÖt even know
 Just listenΓÇª

 YouΓÇÖre the one that I want, the one that I need
 The one that I gotta have just to succeed
 When I first saw you, I knew it was real
 IΓÇÖm sorry about the pain I made you feel

 That wasnΓÇÖt me; let me show you the way
 I looked for the sun, but itΓÇÖs raining today
 I remember when I first looked into your eyes
 It was like God was there, heaven in the skies
