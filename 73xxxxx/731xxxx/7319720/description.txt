UFO: The Two Sides
Vesrion: 0.99


Excellent multiplayer version of X-COM: Enemy Unknown. Unfortunately, its creator was afraid of getting sued so he stopped making it (conveniently in the .99 version) and stopped all downloads. For this reason the .99 is very rare and I thought I'd upload it to a greater audience. Note: I believe this only works on 64-bit Windows systems. Feel free to prove me wrong.

To Play:

1. Copy ufo_099 folder wherever you want. The application is inside and you may or may not want to create a shortcut of that.
2. Start up the config application to change res and other stuff.
3. start up "Ufo" or Ufo_sh1" (I haven't found out what the diffrence is between the files is)

Have fun!
