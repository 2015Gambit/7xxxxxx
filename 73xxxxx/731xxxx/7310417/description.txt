Mr. Stone has put in a request and we've slightly missed the mark, what we have before him isn't exactly what he specified. After a bit of hemming and hawing, and a drop in price, Lee agrees to accept this dame to see what she's got. Once he signs on the dotted line, he gets a bit of a closer inspection. After all, he's made the journey to our lair and he will extract all the value he can out of this visit. We've given him the go ahead to do as he wishes and hopefully we can retain our loyal customer. One thing is for certain though, he's going to get his money's worth...
