,ProfessorQ,2012-06-01T20:45Z,"Nevermind, seems to work now. Cool."
,LCSINpatria,2012-06-01T23:25Z,"you should add the prelude (batman #1-7), also u can open up all the books to extract the jpegs and putb them all in order in 1 zip (or rar) file to read it all at once. I've done that for a few crossovers i was reading, i didnt post them though, either way thx for collecting these in one torrent"
,DreamingFar,2012-06-02T00:06Z,"The batman annual isn't part of the NotO event, it's just an updated Mr. Freeze origin story."
,Lennnny,2012-06-02T07:36Z,"the annual is part of the event, it mentions the owls, plus its officially listed in the night of owls booklet"
,ProfessorQ,2012-06-02T22:49Z,"I am really enjoying this whole ""Court of Owls"" storyline. I hope it keeps going, as nothing is really resolved during ""Night of the Owls"".

Yeah, Batman Annual #1 and All-Star Western #9 really don't have much to do with the main ""Night"" plot with Mr. Freeze is an essential piece to the overall ""Owls"" thing."

Another torrent with the storyline. Just in case this one runs out of steam. I'm really excited about this story so cross-promoting where ever I can!"
