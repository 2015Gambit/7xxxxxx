This DVD series is the theory of a permaculture design course with Bill Mollison and Geoff Lawton. We made this knowledge available for free because it is so important.

If you have the money then please consider buying the original DVD series or see if you can somehow otherwise support these two important people of the permaculture movement. If you can't then please contribute in some other way in time or money to permaculture initiatives. Have a lot of fun with the very interesting permaculture lessons on these video`s!
