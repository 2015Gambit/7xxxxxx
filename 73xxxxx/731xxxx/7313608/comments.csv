,...TPB...,2012-08-10T19:39Z,"Obama's sure come through on all his promises! It doesn't matter if you agree with his ideals or not, this president has been the biggest failure since the great depression. A great president pulls people together (i.e. Clinton, Reagan), makes Americans on both sides want to work together. He is so far from that, it's unbelievable. He's torn this country apart using class warfare and personal attacks on his rivals. His presidency has been a total disaster, no matter how you look at it. "
