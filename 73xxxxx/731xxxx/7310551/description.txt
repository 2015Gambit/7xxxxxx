EmpireV.pdf     A poorly scanned, but complete copy of the EmpireV rules

Empire version V is the last release of Empire, which is THE definitive napoleonic wargame rules.

Since Empire was published many moons ago, there are a number of newer rules releases in the scene which all suffer from the inevitable dumbing down of the concept. They are however useful to read to pick new ideas from, so I have included them in this archive out of itnerest.
