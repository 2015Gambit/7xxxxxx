,XHaloXX,2012-05-31T16:26Z,"@pirate6662012 , what icdmize said is true, but the main reason is not that as the game eventually is released to pc.

The main reason is PC codebase is almost identical to xbox 360 as both of are using microsoft technologies like DirectX, VC++,....

so companies tend to release it for xbox first then start working on ported PC version at the same time to support keyboard and mouse in addition to enhancing the graphics."

,cjmsr6669,2012-05-31T19:31Z,"I read the reason this was not released on PC along with the console version is there was some problem with getting it released on PC the same day in Europe. So rockstar decided to wait until the release date of June first was ok'd in Europe, word is they like to do a simultaneous worldwide release for their games. So 1 more day until the official PC release and I'm sure a crack is in the pipe since retail has already been leaked."
,CrownMeKing,2012-05-31T19:50Z,^Common sense dictates that you check the system requirements. The game's full size is 36GB so I would say it's safe to assume it's legitmately 26GB.

,madlax10,2012-06-01T01:34Z,"@Dimmis80 Assuming you were talking in terms of the story (Considering Max Payne 1 & 2 were only single player), the game isn't nearly as good.  The story in Max Payne 3 is very different from what we've previously experienced with the first two games.  The dialogue seems sort of weird as it's not as figurative.  Also, the storyline in general isn't as deep as it was in Max Payne 1 & 2 because the conflict isn't so personal.  However, the game is still VERY good.  The animations, Euphoria Engine, visuals, gunplay, shooting mechanics, multiplayer, etc, all make up for what the story lacks.  Let me tell you now.  This game is VERY FUN!  I pre-ordered on Amazon.

@eveyone else who downloaded this

After som time messing about with firewall and shit i got it to work. Was a basic stupid thing that i forgot:p

After i followed hazardose's instructions it seemed I couldn't log into Rockstar Social Club ingame thus not start it. In addition my Explorer would crash everytime i tried using the MaxPayne2.exe.
Then i went to Rockstar Social Club online and made myself an account.

I first tried blocking everything with my firewall, the unblocking one at the time.

I then, and here is the idiot part, applied the crack AGAIN AFTER UPDATING according to hazardoses instruction... and now it works usin PlayMaxPayne.exe and logging into rockstar Social Club with my own ID.  It took a few secs for the loading screen to pass, so i thought it was a missfire AGAIN... but no! it actually works. 

Dl'd the DLC's as well and everything works just fine :) Thank you for a great game :D"

,BeLLo_XXX,2012-06-03T22:16Z,Works great! Thx a lot!
,hazardose,2012-06-04T00:51Z,"For those having problems:
There may be a lots of reasons for that.
The only thing I could add to the above:
Maybe you can try eventually blocking every game EXE in your firewall after step 11), just before step 12). So subsequent updates should not corrupt the crack, for example. I am using the game now like this, in Offline mode, and it works, I am at Chapter 12, and there were absolutely no freezes. I am using Win7 64bit, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 CPU, etc.
...ah, and one more thing: I'd suggest you to play the game in ADMIN mode. That means you should for example create a shortcut for PlayMaxPayne3.exe, and then in the properties of this shortcut, around the Compatibility settings, you should check the ""Run as Admin..."" checkbox. So you always start it in Admin mode. ...for me this works flawlessly."
,dalteguy82,2012-06-04T05:58Z,shelling out a little extra cash is something better then the headache of getting these games to work =P
,PhOeNiX56,2012-06-04T12:27Z,"@mlobo93

I encountered the same thing a coulpe of times, the game getting stuck at the 'press enter to continue' screen, while trying to use the 'MaxPayne3.exe' instead of the 'PlayMaxPayne3.exe'. 

 When using the last mentioned .exe the game attempted an update whilst a first i tried choosing to play offline and that didnt work. The game should attemp an online auto-update if it is not blocked by firewall, and in which case you should just get an error message. 
When updated you will still get the update-error message but the game will load.
AFTER the AUTO UPDATE apply the crack as instructed (copy/paste entire folder)
 and you can then sign in with your own Rockstar ID. 
I had to reboot a couple of times due to crashes but after unblocking everything MaxPayne3 exe's and Rockstar exe's and applying crack after auto update its all good. 
If in your case the game wont auto update you can search for the update at RockstarGames. (also run everything as admin).
I cannot play offline or with blocked exe's, and i sign in everytime. Good Luck"

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7333230/Max.Payne.3.v1.0.0.22.patch.cracked.READ.NFO-THETA

Works with RELOADED release after I already applied REALOADED's Updates, profile, dlc and Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED  I had already start playing the game too and I have no problem. I play offline and stay offline while playing.

1. Install the patch MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22
2. Copy over the contents of the /Crack dir to your installation
directory

NOTES

* This release does not include any previous patches, thus should be used only after v1.0.0.17 patch is installed.

CHANGELOG

* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS.
* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game.
* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and Shootdodgeï¿½. Increased top end range of mouse sensitivity, but kept the slider from 1-10, allowing the user more range in their sensitivity setting.
* Fixed reported issues of mouse acceleration affecting aiming, included commandline option to disable mouse acceleration, -nomouseaccel (In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Mouse Controls menu).
* Fixed reported issues of game locked in incorrect aspect ratio, or alt-entering and having incorrect aspect ratio. Added commandline option for locked aspect ratio as commandline option -aspectratio width:height (ie. -aspectratio 4:3 / -aspectratio 16:9) In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu.
* Fixed reported issues of the video card reporting having 0MB of video memory available. Users unable to adjust Graphics options because of this (Also helps fix stuttering on some video cards). "

,pirateGRC,2012-06-08T05:20Z,"RELOADED Update v1.0.0.22 works with this retail version as well: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED

You have to apply the first REALOADED Updates, Crack, dlc and profiles that can be found seperately here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED works with Retail Version as well.

Be offline during installation and during the game.Good way to be sure is to disable your network or wireless controller from device center.

From 1st Updates+Crack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7320035/Max.Payne.3.Crack.and.Update.Only-RELOADED follow these steps:

1) Install the game from the four (4) .ISO files by mounting to a virtual drive one by one like DAEMON Tools Lite free version for these job. When installation finish choose play offline and abort any message saying needed to connect for updates or something like that.*If you haven't already installed the game.

2) Install MP3_Launcher_1_13_0_0.exe, Social Club v1.0.9.5 Setup.exe and MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_17.exe

3) Copy profiles folder and paste into ""user""/My Documents/Rockstar Games/Social Club/ folder if these folders doesn't exist make them.

4) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to, maybe only MaxPayne3.exe in first - clear install.

If you already have done the above, download this REALOADED 1.0.0.22 update: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7336084/Max.Payne.3.Update.v1.0.0.22-RELOADED and follow the nstructions from the uploader:
*profiles folder it's the same with the first Update+Crack of RELOADED.

1) Install MP3_Patch_Update_1_0_0_22.exe

2) Copy all the other files MaxPayne3.exe, binkw32.dll, gsrld.dll and dlc folder with all it's contents and paste them into your installation folder for example C:/Program Files(x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/ replacing everything asked to.

You're done.

- Play the game offline for fist time, make your settings, apply your graphics settings and exit.

- With a firewall block from going online the Max Payne 3 game .exe files, PlayMaxPayne3.exe, MaxPayne3.exe and renderer.exe and then enable your network or wireless controller from device center.

- Play offline your game story.

For those having problems at start loading try running on safe mode first: ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -safemode

For fixing your aspect ratio run PlayMaxPayne3.exe with the apropriate command for example ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:9 or ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/Max Payne 3/PlayMaxPayne3.exe"" -aspectratio 16:10 for example.

Reading the changes that ""...In a future update, this will be added as an option in the Graphics menu..."" and hearing that someones still having problems I think there is going to be another update soon and I'll wait for REALODED's update in this case.

Hope this will work for you.

Enjoy the game and this update ;)

!Documents folder exists by default from Windows installation already, make or find the other folders Rockstar Games and Social Club into the existing Documents folder in your language installation pack.We don't all have english windows of course.I am writing that because some find no profile because they make a new Document or My Documents folder on ""user""/ and put profiles folder and it's contents in there so when they first run the game there can't be found any profile and game asks for making one Social Club profile by connecting to the internet - for no reason - to make it and start the game.Stay offline.!

,kody27,2012-06-08T20:54Z,"There is in fact NO way to get this version to work with the new 1.0.0.22 update. It's fucking impossible. I applied all the RELOADED cracks, updates, dlc, profiles to the correct path, etc. Followed all the stupid fucking firewall and disabling network key instructions, re-applied the cracks after the 1.0.0.22 update and nothing works. Now I have to wait another 5 fucking days so I can download the RELOADED version and start from fucking scratch. Fuck Rockstar for including the Activation Online reqiurements with the new update, what if someone doesn't have fucking internet service for a number of reasons and they just wanna play this game on their computer? THEY FUCKING COULDN'T because the god damned aspect ratio is fucked without the new update. Fuck Rockstar they fucking suck and I'm happy to be stealing this game online."
