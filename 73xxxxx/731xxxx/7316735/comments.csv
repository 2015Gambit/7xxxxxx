I'll answer your email, and also post it here, others might find it useful.

After you have downloaded the .avi file from TPB, you can then watch it on your own laptop, or PC.  If you want to pass it to a friend, copy the .avi file to a disk, or a memory stick, and give that to your friend. They can then watch it on their PC.

Many modern dvd players will play a .avi file on a disk, or memory stick, without conversion.

If you want to create a dvd that can be played on an older player, you must convert the .avi file to a dvd format, then ""burn"" it to a blank disk. The program that I use is ""ConvertXtodvd.4"", you can get it from TPB. 

You can get a ""cracked"" one, one with a ""keygen"" to generate your own serial number, or with a ""patch"". If you are a novice, the ""cracked"" one or ""keygen"" is safer.

If you want to convert a dvd to an .avi file, you must use a program call a "" ripper"". ""rip"" is computer jargon that means to convert a file from one format to another. 

You want to convert from a dvd format to a .avi file. The program that I mostly use is called ""Winx"", but there is one called ""Wondershare"" that is easier to use. You can get them both from TPB.

Winx is flexible and easy to use, and I think that it gives a good quality file. You can judge from the copy of EE that you download from me. I don't use a very high setting for EE, to keep the file size down. 

I could use higher settings, but it takes longer to upload, and nobody has complained yet. I use higher settings for documentaries, like Himalayas.

Good Luck. 

What ripper do you use Mel ?
