,crazyout,2012-06-09T18:16Z,How to make a save game progress on the server?
,lawlinmyer,2012-06-12T21:57Z,"Thanks for this man! I've been running a server for a couple days with this and it works really well. Are you going to update it when the new DayZ update comes out? And I can't seem to ban people, a lot of russians like to spawn helicopters and tanks, is banning just not possible with cracked servers?"
,NorwegianDude32,2012-06-15T02:39Z,im stuck at requesting character and i tried to change character slot :(
,usasoldier52,2012-06-19T16:03Z,Conan can you please tell me if its possible to save my character or not. Everything else is perfect. Thanks alot
,wtfbob87,2012-06-20T04:19Z,"Not currently working for me, im stuck at the waiting for host screen.   I have tried the commands like #reassign, #missions, etc. . . but I cant actually ""Create"" the game.  Ive logged in as admin and everything.   When a friend views the server he says the games status is creating.   We both own Arma 2 through steam but dont like to play on DayZ with all the people . . . . . Any ideas?"
,usasoldier52,2012-06-22T23:35Z,"if you do exactly what he says and download the v4 file as well it works, only problem is you can't save........ Conan i beg u find a solution"
