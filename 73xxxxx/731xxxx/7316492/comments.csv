,mothermonster,2012-06-02T04:57Z,"Thank you for you work with this torrent; it was pretty good quality. 

V: 8/10 (Based on my imac resolution; I've definitely seen better 720 quality)
A: 10/10
M: I recently watched Gone before watching this, and I think Gone is actually better. But this was a very cool movie, with a lot of action and suspense. Of course, the star power is strong and the fight scenes have a ""Borne"" feel to them. I would def say if you're looking to watch a film similar to ""Borne"" with an interesting twist, then go for it. "
