Plot: Three seemingly anonymous high school seniors attempt to finally make a name for themselves. Their idea is innocent enough – let’s throw a party that no one will forget, and have a camera there, to document history in the making. But nothing could prepare them for this party. Word spreads quickly as dreams are ruined, records are blemished and legends are born.
