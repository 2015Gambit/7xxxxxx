Extreme Lives: Very Odd Couples
They are matches made in heaven, but no dating website would ever put them together. Very Odd Couples lifts the lid on three unconventional relationships. In Washington, a young couple's profound height difference - his 6ft 4 to his wife's 2ft 8 generates unwanted attention from outsiders. In San Francisco, female author Lon has shunned monogamy and now lives happily in a 'triad' with husbands Dany and Troy. While in Sydney, Lisa talks about discovering her husband's gay double-life.
