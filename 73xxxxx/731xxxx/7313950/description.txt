
The only thing that we Brits can be proud of now, is our BBC !!
I mainly upload programs from BBC Scotland and BBC4 and  they will only appeal to a minority of viewers.

I do most seeding overnight, so I have no way of knowing how many take downloads, I have to depend on feedback to know whether I should continue uploading, and whether the quality of the uploads is good enough.

Please take a little time to leave some feedback on TPB, The Pirate Bay. 

And please keep seeding !!
