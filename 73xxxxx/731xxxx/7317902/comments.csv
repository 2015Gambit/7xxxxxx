1. In your utorrent/bittorent client, click this particular NBA torrent.
2. Then go to ""Files"" tab and wait until 2 files comes up (if you downloaded this torrent via magnet)
3. If you want to download 540p version only, right click on 360p version folder and select ""Don't download"" (then vice versa if you want to download the 360p version only).
4. Voila!!! Done

Cheerss...."

,likepend1,2012-06-01T10:08Z,"hey guys!

I've been seeding gondy10s' torrents for the last few days with more than 100kb/s (every torrent till 5:1 ratio). I would really appreciate it, if you can put your upload to more than 5kb/s :)

this is the idea behind torrent .... pls don't remove the torrent after the download has finished .... SEED :)

have a great nba playoff time and thx gondy10 for the great uploads!"

Playback Note   : After you see black screen, Just disable video track and enable it back (for VLC)"
