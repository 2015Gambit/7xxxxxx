Jeremy embarks on one of the most challenging trips of his life as he follows the writings of past explorers into the jungles of Guyana, South America, to the Essequibo River to find out if the terrifying giants the journals describe still exist.
                                                                                

RELEASE NOTES: Original source looks like it is mostly PAL. We removed the double blends well enough but can't get it prefect due to network conversion to 29.97 FPS.
