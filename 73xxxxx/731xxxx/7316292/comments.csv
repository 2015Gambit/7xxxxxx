,matusko,2012-05-31T23:52Z,i test it with AV and it's safe... working on me second computer well....
,binber,2012-06-01T08:41Z,"100% safe on windows 7 64bit, AMD Athlon x4, 4GB RAM. Of course, to use the New Remix Decks you need an F1 controller although peoples are working on a translator program which will hopefully allow to send and receive MIDI as well as HID allowing 3rd party controller users to utilize some or most of the new functionality. They are still in the very early stages (read more at djtechtoolsDOTcom) MATUSKO! respect for this and a million thank yous... I thought I was gonna have to wait ages to get this... You made my week... One love! :)"

,djswag,2012-06-02T06:36Z,"Is it just me or does the Traktor Pro Scratch not load? All that's coming up for me is the Traktor Pro. Also the FX aren't working.
Thanks Matusko...I've used your previous versions with no problems before."
,binber,2012-06-02T07:25Z,@Djswag did you remember to launch the program using the .exe from the crack/tsp folder? also for fx did you enable the fx units on the mixer? I hope you can figure it out mate. Everything is functional on my end anyways. Best of luck ~one!

,djswag,2012-06-17T06:35Z,"@binber thanks
I got a virus from this download. I'm currently using the 2.0.1 UNION and I'm getting the blue screen after extended periods of time. Any suggestions?"
,binber,2012-06-17T19:47Z,"@Djswag Sorry to hear that mate! I just finished dl'ing this torrent a second time and kaspersky and norton check out. Clean on my end. I use a program called ""MalwareBytes Anti-Malware"" cus there has been times in the past where I wanted to watch some video streams and some websites require you to install either a plug in or a player and so I have fell victim to malware in the past. (it sucked) MalwareBytes got rid of it in a jiffy. (I think it's free as well). But never got anything overly troublesome from TPB before. I also use UNION's 2.0.1 version (It's super stable) just because I have an older controller and have spent about a year mapping it deep. About the blue screen problem... What  specs are you running on your machine? ~regards."
