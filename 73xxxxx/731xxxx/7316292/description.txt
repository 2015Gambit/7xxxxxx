The installer will install Traktor Pro by default, if you want Scratch
functionality (and you know what it takes to use it) than use the Traktor.exe
application from the crack/tsp dir (Timecode MK1 support is also enabled).

Controller Editor and Service Center have been removed from the setup, they
are available on NI's website for free.
