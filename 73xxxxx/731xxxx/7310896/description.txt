An Unfinished Symphony is an emotional, poetic, and lyrical journey back in time to reflect on the highly contested Vietnam War. The film is divided into three sections which mirror the movements of Henryk Gorekis Symphony No. 3, the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs, to which the film is set. The film focuses on a three-day protest in the form of a march, staged by newly returned veterans. Reversing the same path as Paul Reveres famous ride of 1775, the mounted protest sought to bring renewed awareness to a long-fought, losing battle.

Set to Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No. 3, this documentary reflects on the Vietnam War by mixing footage of a protest march organized by the then newly returned Vietnam vets in 1971, together with footage from the war and conversations with political historian Howard Zinn.
