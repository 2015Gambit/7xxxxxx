,CrazyBobX,2012-05-31T17:46Z,how the crap do you install this...
,JKing732,2012-05-31T18:02Z,Hold on doing a Guide here.
,JKing732,2012-05-31T18:13Z,"Heres a guide for installing ArmA 2 CO and DayzMod:

What you need: 31GB free space on HD and a program to mount .iso (like: Poweriso,Deamontools etc.)

1. Mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD1 and open Setup. Follow instructions on Setup

2. The Setup will ask you to ""insert"" dvd 2, Mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD2 on the same Disk Drive you did to Dvd 1. (It will ask later on to insert DVD 3 Just mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD3)

3.After installing it will start extracting ArmA 2 CO files so be patient it will take quite long. (i recomend to do something else because it can get a little slow.)

(Continue if you want Dayz MOD)
4. After extracting Open up ""DayZ-1.6.0.1"" and extract ""@DayZ"" to your ArmA 2 Main file. (This is my one: C:Program Files (x86)ArmA 2 (it can be diferent for you.)

5. After extracting Right click ""arma2oa"" and Send to - Desktop (create Shortcut)
Go to the shortcup and right click and open properties. AT the end of Target Change the END
at the end of taget: it will be (arma2oa.exe"") Add this to the end ( -mod=@Dayz -nosplash) WITH THE SPACE.

6. Open and Play, to play Dayz go to multiplayer change to Lan and host your on you will be alone and able to play. If you want to play online look for some Hamachi servers to play or Tunngle.

Questions please ask, ill try to awnser, correct me if i did something wrong."
,CrazyBobX,2012-05-31T19:02Z,"@JKing732

works untill the extracting thing, the 2 .exe files are not there and it seems like it just installs a part of it, is there meant to be a setup.1 or is it the setup.exe that counts as it?"

,JKing732,2012-05-31T22:57Z,"@CrazyBobX

it kinda stops alitte then goes again, just wait lol. And theres just the Setup from DVD 1

@mikeydunn

yeah took me a while to find that one out. Go to multi-playar, change to lan and host a ""server"" you'll be playing alone as in offline, select the Cherunuras map and Dayz mission or mode."

,Wafflefrisky,2012-06-13T02:46Z,"Huckleberry, I had the same problem.  Apparently you may need to edit the registry to point to the files.  You may also need to do this for the CD Keys.

BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN DOING THIS, ONE FUCKUP CAN REALLY SCREW UP YOUR COMP AND NEED A NEW INSTALL OF WINDOWS

Hit the windowskey + r, to bring up the run prompt.  Enter ""regedit""

The registry editor should be open, now scroll on the right to the arma keys, or right click find ""Bohemia Interactive Studio"".  

You want the Studio one, not just Bohemia Interactive.

In the ""MAIN"" it probably says d:Arma2 or something.   It should point to the ArmA 2 on your machine.  

Mine is C:Program Files (x86)ArmA 2

I don't know if it's necessary to change it for all four, but I did just to be safe.

While in here, it is a good chance to kill two birds with one stone.

For each instance of ArmA 2, there is a key, and you can use the keygen contained in the #JIMBO folder to fill in the hex code pertaining to each key.  The hex code is below the key for the product when you generate a key.  Above MAIN for most, you probably have KEY, right click it and modify the binary key.  

For aesthetic purposes for myself, I pasted the key into a notepad.txt and split it up into groups of two, and then just replaced each pair of two with the text.  You don't have to do this for PMC.

Here is an image of the keygen, what you need to take from it, and the part you need to replace in the registry. 

http://i.imgur.com/X8v17.png

Don't forget to change the generator to the associated product."

YOU HAVE TO DO IT ONLY IF YOU GET AN ERROR THAT YOUR KEY IS WRONG, OTHERWISE IT IS UNNECESSARY!

If you can't find the DayZ map when trying to play alone in LAN mode, then just download Tunngle and play it in multiplayer (also you have to play through the LAN tab after intalling that).

You have to download it free and create an account, then type DayZ in its search and you will find the servers! Good luck pals! Buy this game if you like it, it is worth it but u'll see :)."

Mount Arma CD1 iso
start installation.
Mount Arma CD2 when prompted for setup6
mount arma CD3 iso when prompted the next time.
wait for extraction to finish.

Thats where I am. then i extract the dayz 1.6 files from the .ZIP into the ARMA 2 folder located in program files. After that, everyones guide to trying to play online becomes a clusterf***
The first time i tried, i got in and tried to join a game but it kicked me out saying i didnt have a valid key. So tried to follow one of the guides for regediting.

Everyone trying to play online asking about wrong CD Keys, as far as I know, you CANNOT play online with this.  HOWEVER there is a service called Tunngle, google it, that you can use to join and host LAN games online.  These you CAN join.

The CD key fix I mentioned is really only necessary for when you get the Bad CD key on boot of the game.

For the people who can't find the values in your registry, I had the same problem at first.  That's why I mentioned the ""find"" feature.

Heres a step by step photo album. http://imgur.com/a/PZGFu#DNOqH

After you finally install the beta patch (It WILL take FOREVER) go to your ArmA 2 folder, and send the ""Launch ArmA 2 OA Beta Patch""shortcut to the desktop, use this to launch the game.

For everyone with bad Serial at start up, follow this.

Also, when running Tunngle, you will probably want to right click -> run as admin

RSS, are you replacing the whole thing with that, or just adding it to the end?  If you can't get it to work, just enter the game and manually enable the dayz mod in expansions.

! ! ! Using this solution involves editing system settings so watch out what you're doing ! ! !

(32bit OS only)

Windows XP

Menu Start -> Run, type sysdm.cpl and press ENTER
a window should open, go to tab Advanced -> Startup and Recovery Settings -> Edit
at this point you're editing your boot.ini file. Don't mess things up.
Look for the line with your operating system mentioned and add ""/3GB /USERVA=2990"" without quotes. Should look like this:

[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)WINDOWS=""Microsoft Windows XP Professional"" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /3GB /USERVA=2990

just add only the ""/3GB /USER..."", don't erase or add anything else as it may corrupt your booting file
save changes and reboot


Windows Vista / Windows 7

if you are running as an Administrator go to Menu Start -> Run, type cmd and press ENTER
if not go to Menu Start -> Programs -> Accessories, press RMB on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator
in Command Prompt type ""bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVA 2990"" without quotes and press ENTER
reboot


it worked for me and maybe it will work for others to"""

,GRSteelers,2012-07-30T19:11Z,"Here's JKings guide to installing:
JKing732 at 2012-05-31 18:13 CET:
Heres a guide for installing ArmA 2 CO and DayzMod:

What you need: 31GB free space on HD and a program to mount .iso (like: Poweriso,Deamontools etc.)

1. Mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD1 and open Setup. Follow instructions on Setup

2. The Setup will ask you to ""insert"" dvd 2, Mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD2 on the same Disk Drive you did to Dvd 1. (It will ask later on to insert DVD 3 Just mount ArmA2_160_JimbusEd_DVD3)

3.After installing it will start extracting ArmA 2 CO files so be patient it will take quite long. (i recomend to do something else because it can get a little slow.)

(Continue if you want Dayz MOD)
4. After extracting Open up ""DayZ-1.6.0.1"" and extract ""@DayZ"" to your ArmA 2 Main file. (This is my one: C:Program Files (x86)ArmA 2 (it can be diferent for you.)

5. After extracting Right click ""arma2oa"" and Send to - Desktop (create Shortcut)
Go to the shortcup and right click and open properties. AT the end of Target Change the END
at the end of taget: it will be (arma2oa.exe"") Add this to the end ( -mod=@Dayz -nosplash) WITH THE SPACE.

6. Open and Play, to play Dayz go to multiplayer change to Lan and host your on you will be alone and able to play. If you want to play online look for some Hamachi servers to play or Tunngle.

Questions please ask, ill try to awnser, correct me if i did something wrong.



Also, you have to mount the mini image to prevent fade. Refer to help.txt for info."

,GRSteelers,2012-08-01T07:23Z,"@echo1234 
To make Arma recognize itself as the legitimate version, you have to:
A. Mount the weird.vc4 file in #JIMBO using Virtual CD. If you double click the drive, it should say it is corrupt and unreadable. That means it's mounted. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5496337/Virtual_CD_v10.1.0.6_Retail___Serials
B. Run options.cmd as an admin and pick the 3rd or 4th key. IT WORKS, I USED IT MYSELF.
C. You have to tell me how to update it, cuz there's no way I can figure that one out."
,MigBac,2012-08-01T09:38Z,"I have a couple of Q's. 

1) If I buy a legit CD-key online, am I able to change the cd-key after installation to match the real one?

2) How do I update this to match the current version, am I even able to do so?

3) Does this run Day Z correctly?"
,worm425,2012-08-01T16:42Z,"@GRSteelers

To install the patches you need to go to the official armaII webstite, and the dayzmod official website.

You can get the latest and greatest there.

How do you fix the problem with multiplayer when you join and it says ""Bad CD Key - Invalid CD Key"" I've used 1-10 on the command promt, and have the image mounted to the physical drive."
,vragoslav,2012-08-02T00:58Z,"Ok fuckers this is your lucky day im playing day LAN and online thru Tunngle. And im gona tell you secret how, where and what to do to make it work.

1. download this torent
2. Instal the game
2.1 INSTALATION PROBLEMS
2.1.1 32bit OS when i trayed to instal it first time exstraction stoped on 35% (my os wos win7 ultimate 32bit) 
2.2 SOLUTION 
2.2.1 THIS CAN HELP ONLY IF YOU ARE USING 32BIT OS!!! 
Windows XP
Menu Start -> Run, type sysdm.cpl and press ENTER
a window should open, go to tab Advanced -> Startup and Recovery Settings -> Edit
at this point you're editing your boot.ini file. Don't mess things up.
Look for the line with your operating system mentioned and add ""/3GB /USERVA=2990"" without quotes. Should look like this:
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)WINDOWS=""Microsoft Windows XP Professional"" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /3GB /USERVA=2990
just add only the ""/3GB /USER..."", don't erase or add anything else as it may corrupt your booting file
save changes and reboot
Windows Vista / Windows 7
if you are running as an Administrator go to Menu Start -> Run, type cmd and press ENTER
if not go to Menu Start -> Programs -> Accessories, press RMB on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator
in Command Prompt type ""bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVA 2990"" without quotes and press ENTER
reboot
2.1.2 64bit os did not had eny problems with instalation
3 If and when you finly manage to instal the game dont tach nothing, dont copy nothing!!!
4. download this torrent/7397946
5. when downolad is coplete exstract rars which you downoaded in point 4. to your arma2 map (

Works on my rig.  Windows 7, all hardware specs met, etc. etc.
Run through the install the way the instructions tell you, you don't need to install Virtual CD if you have Daemon tools.  Be sure you run the registry file, and change the key using options.cmd as needed.  I haven't gotten Internet play, but LAN works fine.

FOR YOU WANTING DAYZ:  Install the addon into your Arma2 folder, mine is C:Program Files (x86)ArmA 2@DayZaddons.  Do yourself a favor and get DayZSP by Kronzky, you can get this file at http://rghost.net/38648740.  You'll want to get your DayZ from the official website, as the 1.6.xxxx isn't supported.  Either use TA2DST.exe to run a dedicated server, being sure to use the mod @DayZ, or just run the game, go to multiplayer, create a new game, and select Chernarus, then DayZ - Modified by Perl - 1.6Whatever."

,JuanCabron,2012-09-16T17:49Z,"Bueno, como estoy seguro de que mas de un hispanohablante se pasa por acá de vez en cuando, voy a dar mi opinión y de paso ayudo a que la gente que vea esta publicación sepa que esta pasando y no se pierda entre tantos comentarios y desvaríos. 

1. El torrent funciona a las mil maravillas, la descarga es rápida, hay buena cantidad de seeders y en general no debería haber problemas en esa parte.

2. En cuanto al juego, bueno, hay varias cosas por aclarar. Los que dicen que no sirve, están equivocados, pues funciona muy bien, yo mismo lo comprobé hace unas horas, solo hay que tener paciencia (mucha) y un buen pc. Así que si te conectas a Internet a través de tu linea telefónica y tienes un equipo del siglo pasado que a duras penas puede con win 7 ni siquiera te molestes en terminar de leer esto.

3. La instalación es la mas larga y estresante que jamas he visto, tarda casi una hora en completarse pues el juego es muy pesado, y esta supercomprimido. Acerca del error del 35% en la descompresión, a mi no me paso y no tuve ningún inconveniente, no tiene nada que ver eso de instalarlo en otra parte que no sea la predeterminada por el sistema (puede instalarse en cualquier disco, en cualquier carpeta, eso no tiene nada que ver), ni mucho menos con la versión de windows (al instalador le vale que tenas de 32 o 64 bits, personalmente uso win7 ultimate x32 y no paso nada, ni crasheó, ni se bloqueo ni se apago ni se cago, funciono normal asi que si a ti te pasa es porque tu pc DA ASCO). 

4. Dentro del disco 3 viene una guía completa para la instalación, un .pdf en español con todas las instrucciones necesarias para instalar, jugar, tener sexo con tu vecina y todas esas mamonadas que quieres saber. Léelo bien porque si no, te vas a arrepentir y vas a tener que desinstalar y comenzar otra vez (créanme eso es lo ultimo que uno quiere que pase).

4. Es mejor usar el instalador oficial del DayZ mod pues el que trae el torrent está desactualizado.

5. Sí, se puede parchear, el juego no tira problemas por eso si la instalación fue correcta, solo hay que saber de donde bajar las actualizaciones (ni crean que voy a poner enlaces aquí, Googleenlas, perezosos!). 

6. Sí, se necesita el VirtualCD, pero no para la instalación, las imagenes son .iso, asi que se pueden montar con daemon, alcohol, tu hermana, lo que sea. El VirtualCD es necesario para jugar, si señores, para jugar. Se usa para montar una mini imagen en formato .vc4 cada vez que se inicia el juego, para evitar que se active el infame FADE (sistema de seguridad que te jode la vida si tienes una copia pirata. Sí, como la que estas descargando, baboso). En el dvd 3 tambien esta el instalador del VirtualCD 10, pero no te va a funcionar porque pide key, asi que buena suerte buscando el serial o una copia crackeada (esto ultimo es lo que yo hice y funciono muy bien -Pista: Taringa es buena opcion). Lean el manual de instalación incluido para saber mas de esto.

7. Una vez más, SÍ, sirve el multijugador, pero para LAN, no para online, eso esta explicado en la guia y no voy a decir mas.

8. No jodas mas, si quieres algo fácil, pues desembolsa los 20 euros que cuesta el juego y ya, y si tampoco te funciona pues te fregaste."
