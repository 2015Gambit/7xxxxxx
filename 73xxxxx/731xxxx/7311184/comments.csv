,SigFan80,2012-06-01T03:22Z,"Hey man,

Sooo.... Okay here is my problem. How do I get it to recognize the new Languages? I see they are all in the list but when I try to select something other than the language I started with (German) it gives the following pop error: 

4112 
There was an error in the application.
b1baecffd85f0337ef732e9b6a7b672258bedd78
X Exit the Application

I am not sure how to get around it or why it is happening. Perhaps something didn't install right, but I surely need help at this point. "

The 4112 error means that Rosetta Stone can't find the language pack(s) or it could be corrupt.
Just because the languages are LISTED as being activated, 
you still have to DL that particular language pack.

That really long string of numbers/letters is just the name of one of the files it can't find, so don't sweat it.

Go to C:/Program Files/Rosetta Stone/Content, 
and see if you see the language pack you're trying to run:

For example:
SK-FRA-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-FRA-L2-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-FRA-L3-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-FRA-L4-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-FRA-L5-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi

This is what you should see if you're trying to run French
The ""FRA-L1"" means French Level 1,The ""FRA-L2"" means French Level 2 and so on

Now if you are ALSO trying to run German, you should ALSO see:
SK-DEU-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L2-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L3-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L4-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi
SK-DEU-L5-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi

If you do NOT see these files along with these four folders:
Data, Documentation, Languages and Speech,
here: C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Content

then search your drive for the ""Content"" folder and and move them there

Let me know,"
,SigFan80,2012-06-06T01:43Z,"Aight, I figured out the issue. It's only with the Hebrew. I have downloaded it adn tried installing three separate times and it is not working. I have Latin and German working now but no go on Hebrew."
,SigFan80,2012-06-08T03:36Z,"Also, How soon might we expect a new Spanish (Latin America) with speech?"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-10T06:58Z,"@SigFan80,
Two things, I have re UL'd the Hebrew, on the 9th try it, and I'll get the Spanish (LA) by Monday"
,SigFan80,2012-06-11T03:39Z,"Yeah. I just dnl the Hebrew and the Russian and they both come out as an unreadable file. I am not sure why.

I am trying to install greek now. and am dnl the Spanish LA as I type this.

So as of now I have German and Latin and am working on Greek but the new Russian and Hebrew both failed in the dwnl process.

Thanks for all the hard work!!"
