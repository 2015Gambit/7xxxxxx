,cawoodie,2012-05-31T18:00Z,GARBAGE!!! DO NOT DL. It's always suspicious to me  when the up-loader makes himself Anonymous. This one is a case in point.
,LJUSALF,2012-05-31T19:20Z,can anybody confirm?
,sedflash,2012-05-31T19:47Z,"Yes, it's works. I'm with Windows 7/64. For me work with 4 serial number. When I try with 4 serial number I saw very large left days (over 64000). Then I enter the number, copy all content from ""reset file"" folder and voila.
Encore give up :)
For the moment this is only one crack who saw is actually working. Great job, MKDEV."

,tomh1,2012-06-01T05:52Z,"This DOES NOT WORK. Another lame attempt. Everything works EXCEPT ENCORE. Will someone provide a REAL crack for Encore CS6. Can no one crack this? 

I followed step by step and Encore still doesnt work."
,jackdog10,2012-06-01T06:10Z,"Works. Windows 7/64.  Best activation crack and best instructions so far.  Everything works like a charm - except Encore.  Followed instructions explicitly and seemed to be progressing nicely.  Got in a loop  and got kicked out permanently with ""non-royalty serial number.""  All others are perfect.  "
,rikkorikko,2012-06-01T08:20Z,"Hi Broz

Bit of a Noobie here, 

I'm trying to get CS6, most importantly Premiere CS6 and AfterEffects CS6

I need those to work with all features and codecs, like HDV , avchd etc, as well as encore

Does your acrack fix this so these work fully

cheers"
,sedflash,2012-06-01T09:23Z,"jackdog10, don't give up.
You must type again one serials. It's not work every time, but it's work. Accidentally start Encore Update and I have to repeat all steps again and again Encore work. Don't give up. Important part is while try to register serial number You must use original amtlib.dll for Encore. After all done - copy cracked 64-bit."
,sedflash,2012-06-01T10:09Z,"rikkorikko, YES! But it's hidden. When make your sequence on Premiere just click on Queue and start Media Encoder. If you do it updates like writen in 26 You have no problem with all convertion formats. Preset and Format supported in Premiere are limited, but with Media Encoder all is unlock."
,Ed_in_CT,2012-06-02T03:34Z,"Thanks, this fix worked. All applications launch without nag screen.
Is there a way to get it to update all the apps?"
,rikkorikko,2012-06-02T09:47Z,"Cheers Sedflash..
How do I set up premiere sequence for editing, in terms of resolution ie how would I set up an HDV  1440 x 1080 WS sequence  "
,rikkorikko,2012-06-02T09:49Z,"meant to ask.
does this crack work with standalone appz or only the master suite?"
,rikkorikko,2012-06-02T16:54Z,"cheers  Sedflash
but when i tried I found I couldn't import my raw HDV files to even get them on to a sequence, it just said format unsupported.
I didn't understand what you meant ""it updates like written in 26""
I'm a noobie, bro, can I request a ""step by step"" from you re getting premiere, afx and encore to work with hDV etc."
,Angertek,2012-06-02T19:31Z,"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7322538/Adobe_CS6_All 

This is better explain and much easier and has possible solution for encore ! Plus all premier pro content ! even the files missing !"
,Mr.Acorn,2012-06-03T08:24Z,"Ifff I am running Cs5, would I need to completely uninstall it before installing this version?"
,Jaydagod,2012-06-03T18:50Z,@ mr.Acorn no not really
,kukalada,2012-06-11T11:42Z,"Please help with this:
I follow the instructions until (21), and everything happens as expected, but then when I relaunch Encore, it doesn't ask me for another serial. 

How do I make it so that I can add each of the serials at every consecutive launch?

Help would be much appreciated. Thank you,

kukalada"
,bomb23,2012-07-28T03:23Z,for Encore's needed BSOD patch update - can I install the update right after the full then follow all the instructions?
,bomb23,2012-07-28T04:01Z,"got to step 20, [close], closed the royalty warning, opened Encore again, got royalty warning, clicked [ok] but Encore just closed. no serial entering option anymore and Encore doesn't work, any ideas?"
,bomb23,2012-07-28T04:02Z,"same as kukalada's problem (i think):
got to step 20, [close], closed the royalty warning, opened Encore again, got royalty warning, clicked [ok] but Encore just closed. no serial entering option anymore and Encore doesn't work, any ideas?"
