Recovery Toolbox for RAR is used to recover information from corrupted archives of the RAR format. You can use it to completely avoid or at least minimize losses of compressed data. The RAR recovery tool works in the following way: first, it completely scans and analyzes the corrupted archive, extract all information it can extract from it, after that the final list of files and folders appears on the screen. You can view this list and select only those objects you need to save. At the same time, the RAR recovery program may recover some files incorrectly or it may fail to recover some files at all. It depends on how badly the archive is corrupted.
Extracted files and folders are saved to the specified location, after which they are available for use. It is also important that the source archive remains unchanged and is not modified in any way, the RAR recover program only reads data from it.
