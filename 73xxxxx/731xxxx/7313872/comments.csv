The plot is crap. It is not erotic or sexy at all unless you like the same boring repetitive descriptions constantly. It is just plain shit.

Not to steal mastid's thunder or anything, only EL James thunder, which she doesn't deserve, but I have some books that are actually erotic and thought provoking and well written. Check here-

Listen to the warnings though."
