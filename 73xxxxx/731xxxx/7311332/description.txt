if you update your Nintendo DSi, lite or 3D to the last update (1.44 in case of Dsi)

1. download rar
2. unrar
3. put the content in your micro sd (if you have R4iTT card to use download games)
4. insert the card and thats it

"doesnt matter if your already update your nintendo DSi or 3d or lite."

include plants vs zombies.
and is ready to play music or movies just create a two extra folder music and videos or movies and put your
mp3s in music but if you want to see movies you need xilosoft dpg video converter to convert the movies to
dpg.

thanks.
