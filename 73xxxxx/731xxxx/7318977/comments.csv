AVG FOUND VIRUS. just wait another moment from legit release."
,xpmule,2012-06-02T03:59Z,"retail versions always end up on FOSI's site with a legit key.
the one mirror only has 3.5.0 right now but i did not check the other mirrors..
the mirrors often have different programs but the site looks the same
i guess the get update at diff times

Anyway you can trust FOSi i know that much ;)"
,xpmule,2012-06-02T04:00Z,"i meant to say RETAIL version..
no key needed or included lol"
,BSE_CiT91,2012-06-02T07:14Z,"@dpsp89, I'm using AVG but find virus detected but I'm decided to ""Temporarily Disabled"" protection in few minutes while run install setup when done and delete ""uninstall.exe"" in Fraps folder because false possible uninstall.exe has virus that auto-built in a install setup application it. 

Sorry about my English"
,xpmule,2012-06-03T01:57Z,"I compared this to another uploader
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7319348/Beepa_Fraps_v3.5.4_Build_15034_Retail
and they are a binary comparison match
not 1 byte different !

Then i ran the setup in Sandboxie
and i see no suspicious behavior / files at all..

This release seems clean"
,nakibest,2012-06-03T18:30Z,"No virus here. Works great!
To those using AVG - get a proper antivirus program. :) Another fail from AVG - yet another stupid false positive!!"
,isotope,2012-06-06T19:01Z,"AVG is now not complaining on uninstall.exe but clamav is complaining on ""potenttialyl unwanted application"" PUA.Win32.Packer.DupPatcher on said file. While it is possible it does something fishy on uninstall I doubt so."
,kerttix,2012-06-09T16:30Z,Avast - CLEAN
