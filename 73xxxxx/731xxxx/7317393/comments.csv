,AppRipper,2012-06-01T13:00Z,It is mine. I've patched it with a previous version of the crack. I don't rip many DVDs so I've never used it.
,jat3rd,2012-06-01T13:12Z,This is version 1.5 not 3.2??
,AppRipper,2012-06-01T21:35Z,Nope cracked it myself directly from their website. 3.2
,jat3rd,2012-06-02T00:36Z,"If you open the program and click on ""About Mac DVD Ripper Pro"" under the Apple menu, you will see that it is showing ""Version 1.5"" instead of 3.2. Also if you ""right click"" on the MDRP icon in your Applications folder, you will see that the ""Dates Modified"" are back in 2009. It is definitely not version 3.2. "
,AppRipper,2012-06-02T03:55Z,When I cracked it using a previous version the numbers must have carried over. I assure you this is 3.2. You can see an obvious difference in the GUIs between the two. 3.2=Clear 1.5=Solid Backgrounds
