Hello;
I packed this with uharc, best compression rate for normal users i guess :D
Because of 2 gb limitation i had to split it in 2 parts.


YOU NEED BOTH PARTS!!
Part one can be found here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7315461/[REPACK]360(_)_Maps_for_openarena_quake_3_arena_PART1_2


in order to be able to extract the files you need UHARC.
Can be downloaded here:

Installation:
Simply extract all files and copy them in the openarena folder named baseoa
FINISH!

Please seed my upload is sooo shit
