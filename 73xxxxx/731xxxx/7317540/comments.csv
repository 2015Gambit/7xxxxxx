its more noticeable when the videos in 4:3 are played

you can fix this without re-coding using a free tool called
mpeg4modifier and click midde part A/R 16.9

and resave it.. takes about a min to save fixed file
havent a link to tool but google it.. should show up
also tick unpack if  its packed..

great tool to fix bad aspect videos quickly so worth looking for it"

[V],psspss,2012-06-07T06:43Z,"I found a link to the tool
always tick display a-r 16-9 can fix aspect if
squashed however it cant remove/crop using
header modification only a video re-encode can do that with tools like umile can auto crop which is good

[V],psspss,2012-06-07T07:00Z,"also cant say Ive heard those weird sounds in the sky where im at

but sounds the same all over the world from the video clips

some mass fraud if its not real that for sure..

reminds me of the close encounters movie with music to communicate.. perhaps it does make a word.. does it mean
the mothership is coming for dec perhaps :)"

Looks more like a monkey that was dropped in acid.  But the UFO footage is quite spectacular.  Orbs and crop circles as well."
