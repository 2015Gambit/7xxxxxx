A well-established and widely known TV personality in Mexico, Jaime Maussan has become world famous for the incredible quantity and spectacular quality of the UFO videos that he continuously presents to the global UFO community. The modern Mexican UFO wave, along with JaimeΓÇÖs involvement in this field, began in July 1991 during a total solar eclipse, when thousands of Mexican citizens reported and filmed UFOs. This was the event that made the UFO phenomenon a reality to Jaime. Through his Tercer Milenio TV program, Jaime continues to report on UFOs on a regular basis and is one of the hardest-working investigators and reporters in the field.
