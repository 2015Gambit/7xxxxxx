[M],DeeLee,2012-06-01T22:11Z,so I guess this is the first *real* snuff movie made?
,M1nt3a,2012-06-02T03:38Z,"Thanks for uploading this even though I'm too much of a pussy to download it >_<

Also DeeLee there are other snuff films on the tor network, I think. I've seen thumbnails but never the whole things."

,zaiger,2012-06-02T18:32Z,"@gooth514 ""Snuff"" implies both murder and sex."
,wiggie2oo2,2012-06-02T21:51Z,i've watched plenty of gore videos in the past but for some reason i'm being a pussy to download this one.  anybody willing to give a narration of the video?
,fredyboy2,2012-06-03T02:26Z,"Lol, ive seen shit on the internet way worst than this, i wasn't able to contain my laughter XD.

worth watching, not everyday you see a man fuck a dead body and eat a part of him and shove a wine bottle up is ass."

,WhisperXBA,2012-06-04T00:55Z,"@zaiger no, 'snuff' does not need to include sex. snuff is snuff when A) there is murder, and B) it was done to be sold"
