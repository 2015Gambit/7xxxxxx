No bios updates in the program that show only when program detects pirated key used.. took em a few years to read the other groups proper nfo release notes lol"
,tmemphist,2012-06-29T01:37Z,"FYI:
chili-key gen still says it is an invalid number when entered. Restart AIDA64 and check registration under File TAB -Click About in AIDA64 .  

It is registered not to expire and update until 2017. So it is working, a bit deceiving until you check. 

Thanks to who ever."
