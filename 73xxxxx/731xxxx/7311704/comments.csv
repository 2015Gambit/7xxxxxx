,getting_there,2012-05-30T11:07Z,Thanks! This series will determine the NBA champ.
,Loots1,2012-05-30T14:35Z,Cheers for the upload. It's just a shame that the audio becomes out of sync after the first few mins of the video. Couldn't watch it like that and deleted it. 
,Loots1,2012-05-30T14:39Z,Why did you remove my comment? I said thank you for uploading but then let you and others know that the audio is out of sync after the first few mins!
,Loots1,2012-05-30T14:50Z,"Comment is back it seems, my apologies.

Tools>Track sync - change the audio advance to -0.800s . Around there to sync it back up."

Man I don't have a capability to remove comments.. Please download the MP4 version which I think more decent..

Cheers..."
,likepend1,2012-05-30T15:10Z,"@Loots1: chill :) nobody removed your comment! sometimes the comments need some minutes to show up :/

and yeah i am watching the second quater now and audio is still out of sync (like 5 tenth of a second), but watchable. "
