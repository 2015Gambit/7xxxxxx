"RABIA" is a movie with so many subjects that it is not sure it gets anywhere.In a style close to Luis Bunuel (another side of the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie) and to Roman Polanski (claustrophobia ),since all (or almost) takes place in an old "Gothic" mansion ,some scenes in an attic.But in spite of an ambitious screenplay,directing is not really exciting,lacking the madness the two directors can/could bring to a movie.

This is a love story between two young proletarian lovers ,migrant workers (the way the foreman treats the boy is revealing ) ;this love story ,although it's bound to be tragic ,is unlike any other one ,cause the two lovers are apart in a most amazing way:they are in the same house ,a mansion which belongs to the wealthy family the girl works for .It is some kind of prison for them and when the bars are down ,the freedom the girl has achieved has less to do with chaos than with redemption.
