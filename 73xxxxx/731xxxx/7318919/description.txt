Do you claim that youΓÇÖre the name, "you", person, defendant, "owner", occupant, citizen, resident, tenant etc. or that you "own" things, including the name you use?  Can you ΓÇ£proveΓÇ¥ these claims?

Do you try explaining what you did/didn't do and/or why you did/didn't do it?  If so, why?  Are you assuming that you're the name, "you", person etc.?  Are you "taking it personally"?

Does the title of every court case contain the word "versus", indicating a controversy?  If someone else seems to believe that you're involved in a controversy, could it be wise to ask if there's any evidence?  If someone seems to believe there is evidence that you're involved in controversy, could it be wise to say that you believe there's been a mistake, and ask how you can help settle the matter honorably?
