,hazardose,2012-06-03T03:32Z,"WORKS! I downloaded it, tried it, and the game works. Fucking great cinematic 3rd person shooter! ...you should do mainly 

the following to play:

1) download this GAME torrent:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7314425/Max_Payne_3_RETAIL_DVD_READNFO-P2P

2) download this DLC:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7318409/Max.Payne.3.Special.Edition.DLC-P2P

3) download this UPDATE:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7318405/Max.Payne.3.Special.Edition.Update.1-P2P

4)download this CRACK:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7318411/Max.Payne.3.Special.Edition.CRACK.ONLY.Fixed-REVOLT

5) install the GAME (by mounting the 4 DVDs with PowerISO)

6) copy all DLC folders into the game directory

7) copy all UPDATE folders into the game directory

8) copy all CRACK content into the game directory
   do not block game exe files from accessing the Internet

9) run playmaxpayne3.exe to play.

10) let the game update itself (be connected to the Internet)

11) after the game starts, sign in to Rockstar Social Club,
    or sign up first and then sign in.

12) Enjoy! :)"
,hazardose,2012-06-04T00:50Z,"For those having problems:
There may be a lots of reasons for that.
The only thing I could add to the above:
Maybe you can try eventually blocking every game EXE in your firewall after step 11), just before step 12). So subsequent updates should not corrupt the crack, for example. I am using the game now like this, in Offline mode, and it works, I am at Chapter 12, and there were absolutely no freezes. I am using Win7 64bit, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 CPU, etc.
...ah, and one more thing: I'd suggest you to play the game in ADMIN mode. That means you should for example create a shortcut for PlayMaxPayne3.exe, and then in the properties of this shortcut, around the Compatibility settings, you should check the ""Run as Admin..."" checkbox. So you always start it in Admin mode. ...for me this works flawlessly."
