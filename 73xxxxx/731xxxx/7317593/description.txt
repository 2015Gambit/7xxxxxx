THE WEDGE is a weekly program on MuchMusic (Canada) that showcases non-mainstream music videos.

Shortly after Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys passed away, The Wedge aired a tribute special.  The first half of the show is archived video interviews and concert footage (and people's personal thoughts/memories of Adam), the second half is less mainstream Beastie Boys videos from over the years.  The last few seconds of the last video was cut off, my apologies.

I'm not a fan of the Beastie Boys, but I thought some of their fans outside of Canada would like to see this tribute special, in high quality.
