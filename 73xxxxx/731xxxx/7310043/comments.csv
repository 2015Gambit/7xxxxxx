and for some reason TPB got rid of the ""edit"" feature so I would have to delete it... then get an admin to delete the hash code... then re-upload it again with proper name.  not worth it since the files are correct still.

these two are 5/29 for real though and the first 2 are 5/28.  all you need to know."
