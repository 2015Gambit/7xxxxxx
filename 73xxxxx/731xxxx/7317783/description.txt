Franck Rivoire, known by his stage name Danger, is a French electronic musician from Lyon, France.
Each Danger EP is named after a date following the first one, 09/14 2007 (September 14, 2007), which is the day he finished the EP. These EP's have not been released in chronological order; in fact, "EPII" has been promoted on his MySpace since the release of the first EP, but has yet to be released, and 09/16 2007 and 09/17 2007 are actually EPIII and EPIV, respectively. This strange chronology is a reference to that of the Star Wars film series.
