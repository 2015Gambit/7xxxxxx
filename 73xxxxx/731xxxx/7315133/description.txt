* UPLOADER NOTES :

Hi Resident Evil series fans and i normally don┬┤t write notes on the files description but on this particular file that maked sense to me to say the next thing : this is the very first game of this magnific horror survival games series and i taked a general look at the available files to play this game , i saw PC and PSx like possibilitys and they are but just to play ... but this REMAKE from the first game to the Gamecube it is absolutly fantastic ... graphically it is much more polished than any other Resident Evil 1 game available ... so what i mean it is that if i am workind this games series with the best files possible i must choosed this version and once more like on the Resident Evil Zero file was possible the great preparation of the 2 discs of the game on the Gamecube tools and with that the possibility of a very positive compression , it is to me an honour to present this Remake of the resident Evil 1 for only 1.31 Gb with the game completely untouched and going immediatly in fullscreen after an arc extraction work maded by an worked executable and with 2 pratical executables to launch any of the games discs in 1 second after open the game folder ... making files can be an art and when the work it is possible, me and the users certainly feels realized ... happy game to all of you .
