Title: Casebook Trilogy Special Edition
Genre: detective / 1st-person / puzzle-solving
Released: 1st October 2010
Developer: Areograph
Publisher: Lace Mamba
Description:
Casebook is a single player, episodic PC adventure game set in the gritty world of crime scene investigation. This special edition features the three full length Casebook episodes released so far, which provide over 12 hours of gameplay. The games have been enhanced with new mini-games, a new evidence linking system, a hint system and a ranking system in which you work your way up from a Lab Technician to Forensic Expert. Statistics show how much of the available evidence you have found, divided into two categories: Hard Evidence which is essential to the case and Other Evidence which is optional. The mini-games can be skipped, but doing so lowers the final score, as does using the hints system.

How to play:
1) Download the game;
2) Mount or burn disc image;
3) Run Casebook_Trilogy_Setup.exe to install (it will start automatically if you have autorun enabled);
4) Play the game without the disc.

! Notice
A prequel to the trilogy can be downloaded for free from the developer's website: Episode 0 - The Missing Urn.
