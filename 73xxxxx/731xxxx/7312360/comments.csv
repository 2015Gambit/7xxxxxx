Bohm's 3-world [1=intentionality space, 2=stochastic space, 3=objectified space (here)] obviates the Schrodinger's cat paradox in that only one state is objectified. After all, if Pr(event) is .000001 why postulate 999999 redundant universes? It was also prescient in that by the mid 90s Chalmers, et al, started formulating top-down supervenience (imposed software running on hardware) rather than conventional bottom-up ontology (nature of how things work).

For focused high-end intro texts, which you may want to upload if you have them in your inventory and you're in the mood, are a couple by Yale's Shankar:

Basic Training in Mathematics (1995)
Principles of Quantum Mechanics (1994)

Keep up the good work!"

Your welcome

I have both books mentioned but""Principles of Quantum Mechanics (1994)""Is very poor quality.I won't be uploading that one,it's not worth it

Most older books are hard to get in HQ pdf"
,CrowZero,2012-06-01T05:34Z,"Thank you ,BBS! 
If possible , please upload latest edition of 
1.Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry 
2.Organic Chemistry by Robert Morrison and Robert Boyd
3.Modern Physical Organic Chemistry by
Eric V. Anslyn

These are very important books for graduate and undergrad courses of Chem Eng and Pharmacy.I wanted to buy these books ,but local edition is out of stock ( too expensive to buy online) .PDFs uploaded by other users are so poor in quality and simply unreadable. Hope you understand.
Thanks in anticipation. "
