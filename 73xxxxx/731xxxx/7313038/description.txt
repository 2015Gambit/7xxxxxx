The Handbook of Group Psychotherapy is a user-friendly guide to conducting group psychotherapy in various settings and with different populations. It has been designed as a resource for new professionals, including graduate students in mental health, as well as more seasoned clinicians planning to integrate group psychotherapy into their work.

Bringing together pre-eminent group psychotherapists from different theoretical perspectives and countries, the articles in this volume present their approaches to conducting groups with diverse populations in different settings. Written in straight-forward, jargon-free language, the articles directly speak to the needs of the mental health professional planning to begin a group or to strengthen an existing group. Whether combined with a formal class in group techniques, human relations, or group dynamics, or in an institute training group practitioners, or read as part of oneΓÇÖs own professional development, this work is likely to advance the reader's clinical competency and strengthen their self-confidence as a leader.

Using a personal style and speaking from years of experience, the contributors provide hands-on suggestions as to how a group leader really works. From determining patient or client needs, developing treatment goals, and constructing a group, to handling emergencies, the contributors address the needs of the new group leader. The articles also address issues of diversity and globalism, as well as trauma and resiliency, making this a truly post-9/11 contribution.
