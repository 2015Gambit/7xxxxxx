The world's wisest musical council and international rock sensation, The Hives, present their fifth stunner- the 12-track contemplation of all law that is Hives-- Lex Hives. Self-produced, self-played and self-promoted, these 12 songs are not built to fit just anyone. These are not songs that sound equally good played on an acoustic guitar by the campfire. This is not music. This is compressed carbon hidden in the earth's crust for millions of years and unearthed, to be placed in your eardrums. Blistering proof can be found with the lead single, "Go Right Ahead."
