Ass is the fourth and last album released on Apple Records by power pop band Badfinger. The opening track, "Apple of My Eye", refers to the band leaving the label to begin its new contract with Warner Brothers Records. The cover artwork (showing a donkey chasing a distant carrot) alludes to Badfinger's feelings that they had been misled by Apple over the years. The cover was painted by Grammy Award winning artist Peter Corriston who would later create famous album covers for Led Zeppelin (Physical Graffiti) and The Rolling Stones (Some Girls, Tattoo You).
