A retelling of A Doll's House set in modern Iran. This is really a close look at Iranian society, don't think of it as yet another version of Ibsen - the thing stands on its own merits.

The quality is reduced for quick loading. If you want better,help support Iranian filmmakers (who really need encouragement) by buying a DVD from an online store.
