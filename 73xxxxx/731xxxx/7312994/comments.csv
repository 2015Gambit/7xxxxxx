,skulldragon,2012-06-11T08:13Z,"Dunno about this torrent, but I found a license exploit in ASC. This exploit may or may not work in future releases.

Get yourself v5.3.0.246, may be official, chinks never learn anyway. Install it.
Don't start ASC yet - turn your clock forward in time, I choose year 2065.
Get yourself a pro firewall and ban any connection any part of ASC tries to make.
Start ASC, enter D735F-51E93-1B1E4-C8AD4
(this code, by default, will always give you 365 days no matter, when you enter it)
When internet connection error message appears, go into ASC installation dir and set License.dat to Read-only.
Now you can Finish the registration and close ASC.
Turn your clock back to normal.
Start ASC and check the Manage License - your license will end after half a century.
Since License.dat is now Read-only, ASC can never fix it and invalidate it.
Enjoy the future!"
