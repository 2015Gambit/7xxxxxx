Introducing the newest signing to NavigatorΓÇª.ahab. 

ahab are a London based quartet who play a mixture of country and folk styles. Following a barnstorming performance at the Cropredy Festival in 2010, they have built a strong following via numerous live shows around the UK and beyond.
   
The bandΓÇÖs debut album will not be released until 2012, but by way of introduction an EP entitled ΓÇÿkmvtΓÇÖ has just been released by Navigator Records. All five songs on it are produced by John Leckie, the legendary producer of the eponymous debut by The Stone Roses, Radiohead ΓÇÿThe BendsΓÇÖ and (of course) Bellowhead ΓÇÿHedonismΓÇÖ.

Lead track ΓÇÿWish YouΓÇÖ has already been receiving airplay from key supporters such as Simon Mayo and Bob Harris on BBC Radio 2. 

ahab is the real deal....top-notch UK Americana featuring tight four-part harmonies.ΓÇ¥ Simon Mayo, BBC Radio 2

ΓÇ£I loved ahabΓÇÖs terrific performance at Cropredy festival. They are blistering live....alt-country edge and sheer class.ΓÇ¥  Bob Harris, BBC Radio 2

All tracks from the EP are also available as individual track downloads from iTunes and other digital retailers. 

Having played a number of festivals in the UK and around mainland Europe during the summer, and with a successful October tour to promote ΓÇÿkmvtΓÇÖ completed, ahab were also invited by Bellowhead to be the special guests on their 18 date UK tour that has just commenced (see Bellowhead section of website for tour dates).
