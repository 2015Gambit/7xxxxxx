Payable on Death is the eponymous fifth studio album and third major label release by Californian metal quartet P.O.D.. Following the controversial departure of Marcos Curiel, it was their first album to feature guitarist Jason Truby and their last album produced by Howard Benson. Payable on Death was released on November 4, 2003 through Atlantic and marks a notable de-emphasizing of the band's distinctive rapcore style. While a commercial disappointment compared to the monumental Satellite, it has sold over 1,300,000 copies worldwide
