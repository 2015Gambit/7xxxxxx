,XxjeanpierrexX,2012-08-01T00:18Z,"ok for those who get the ban kick this is how i fix it! 
Note: it worked for me!
1- Open the folder where you installed cod waw 
2- Click on Key-generator, then generate a cd key, and  write down the cd key in a paper .
3- Open cod waw game, and  go to multiplayer.
(do not create an online profile)~just click no
4- then go to options& control, then click multiplayer options.
5- click on enter cd code, and write the cd key that you wrote down....after that you should be able to play online without getting that annoying punkbuster ban kick/ban ...tell me if it work for you guys.
remember to have fun and don't hack for god's sake   "
