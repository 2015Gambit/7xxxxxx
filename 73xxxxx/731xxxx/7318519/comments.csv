If you enjoy it, please consider buying a copy from our website at TimeScapes.org or at iTunes, so we can recover the money we invested in the film, and then make some more films for your enjoyment. :)

,nicoroxy,2012-06-16T04:30Z,"Awesome images! I saw the trailer, it´s increible. Thanks to the uploader and the filmaker @tomlowefilmmaker. Despite it found his material in this site he didn´t complain. Unfortunately in the country I live it´s almost imposible afford this kind of material, it´s too expensive."
,Justmetoo,2012-06-23T21:43Z,"Hello Tom and congratulations on this incredible masterpiece. Only one word...COJONUDO. I am a follower of yours on Vimeo and I am impressed not only by your work but by your attitude towards discovering your movie on TPB. Like many famous world renowned artists more and more are not just tolerating TPB but some are even condoning and supporting it. One very famous one that supports TPB even on his web site is Paulo Coelo, a very famous writer. I myself use TPB very much and to be honest, some of the software I use started out as a pirate version from TPB. Eventually I buy if the product fulfills my needs and it gets into the next couple of upgrades. For movies though, I am not as straight, honestly many like myself would NEVER buy many of the movies i've watched on iTunes or otherwise nor would I go see them in a real theater. The amount of downloads of any given movie on TPB would not make a difference on your life stile, I honestly believe that. Ok so perhaps you might have been able to get one full gas tank for your pickup....but really many of those downloads would have never eneded as a buy on your website. As for iTunes it's a shame that your masterpiece is only available in 720p. I will most likely buy your version in the download format HD 1080p because, I don't have a blue ray gadget and never will have. In today's day and age with high speed internet, making plastic discs is not a very green way of supporting artists like yourself that show us how beautiful our planet is. Lets keep it that way by not producing plastics or encouraging business that make large use of plastics.

Thanks again for stopping by in no mans land and being nice to its people. See you on Vimeo."

,guru_stpetebeach,2012-07-07T08:02Z,"I just $$$. I think you did a great job Tom and I hope you do recoup your investment. Can you imagine if we didnt have to pay for any movie until after we saw it?!?! That might make the stories a bit better. lol

I am downloading the Making Of now...you have me thinking about those camblocks, I am a robotics engineer. cool."
