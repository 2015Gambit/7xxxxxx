The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill
San Francisco's Telegraph Hill neighbourhood has become home to a large flock of wild parrots. While no one is certain how the parrots came to be there, the birds were left undisturbed until a chance meeting with Mark Bittner. Street musician Bittner had no experience of ornithology prior to his first encounter with the parrots but before long he developed a close bond with them and took it upon himself to care for them. Bittner's friendship with the parrots became a valuable experience, teaching him as much about himself as the birds; with the passage of time his work earned the respect of his community as well as a home. The Wild Parrots Of Telegraph Hill is a superlative documentary which recounts the story of the engaging and articulate Bittner and his birds, as well as an unexpected twist of fate which added a poignant note to their tale.
