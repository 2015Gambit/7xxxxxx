,kart47,2012-06-22T14:24Z,"Just one thing, those bat files are meant to be an advertisemnt to AVIARA so ppl can help by entering his forum and make a contribution, 
You do know he has to eat and stuff like that, contributions are meant to help uploaders and hackers to stay online for as long as possible without having to worry about going to work, so that they can make better uploads and more as well..

Stop citicising an uploader for ""asking for help"" so to speak...

And AVIARA, I love your torrent, and I hope this one works.. it's the third I've tried and none of the others worked.. errors on instalation...

BTW, sry about the bad english."
