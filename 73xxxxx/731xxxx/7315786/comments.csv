[T],despo1ler,2012-05-31T19:28Z,"These new episodes are coming from our Australian Encoder as there will not be any new episodes from US TV until June 24th. There will be another 4 new episodes from the him next week. Also, I heard a rumour that they may even be airing the full season before the US :)

And I notice a lack of comments about the high quality of these new episodes, funny how people who claim their complaining is being ""helpful and informative"" forget to inform people when the releases are 10/10 a/v.

@IronFist1, yeah, we finally get to see what's happened to Cap, and another Major player we were all waiting to see shows his face as well :)"
