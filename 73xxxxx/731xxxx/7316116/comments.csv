Bad job at this time!"
,hurukh,2012-06-03T16:11Z,Yeah no seed! What's wrong with this torrent?
,rusty-koathanger,2012-06-14T00:07Z,"my torrent client says there is one seeder but i've only d/led 10megs (and i got that almost 2 weeks ago). uploader, how about an update? are you seeding? if not, let us know and maybe we can help. otherwise it's just a lame torrent with your name all over it."
,rusty-koathanger,2012-06-14T01:07Z,"correction: i meant if you are trying to seed and there are problems, le tus know and we might be able to help"
,ccoxe0,2012-06-26T21:21Z,Seeder?! ANYWHERE!?
,rusty-koathanger,2012-06-30T04:15Z,"@ccoxe0 and others: don't bother with this torrent. the uploader is either dead or a total idiot. *this* one (for ppc, not intel) is still being seeded
