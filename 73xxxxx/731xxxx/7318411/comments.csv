,Nortonko,2012-06-04T00:05Z,The game crashes to desktop without an error during the first cutscene around the time Max opens the door. Any ideas on what I should do?
,hazardose,2012-06-04T00:47Z,"For those having problems:
There may be a lots of reasons for that.
The only thing I could add to the above:
Maybe you can try eventually blocking every game EXE in your firewall after step 11), just before step 12). So subsequent updates should not corrupt the crack, for example. I am using the game now like this, in Offline mode, and it works, I am at Chapter 12, and there were absolutely no freezes. I am using Win7 64bit, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 CPU, etc.
...ah, and one more thing: I'd suggest you to play the game in ADMIN mode. That means you should for example create a shortcut for PlayMaxPayne3.exe, and then in the properties of this shortcut, around the Compatibility settings, you should check the ""Run as Admin..."" checkbox. So you always start it in Admin mode. ...for me this works flawlessly."
