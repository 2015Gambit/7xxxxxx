,ajwaller,2012-06-01T13:55Z,The quality of the upload was good A9/v9 but the actualy quality of the film diabolical. I didnt even finish watching it before I deleted it
,zbetazomo,2012-06-01T16:11Z,"Few friends good in CG met at McD one day. They were having a chat when 1 of them suggested, ""Lets make use of our knowledge and make a CG movie, call it ANDROID INSURRECTION and rule the world"" Never did they know they got only a few hundred bucks to hire actors and actresses and their Core 2 Duo specs computer couldnt really render high quality CG and voila...ANDROID INSURRECTION"
,zbetazomo,2012-06-01T16:13Z,Oh wait. someone pushed up the ratings to 2.0 . Was it you David or Nat?
,y3n007,2012-06-01T21:49Z,"This looks horrible, can't belive they even wasted their time to put in in Blue Ray...."
