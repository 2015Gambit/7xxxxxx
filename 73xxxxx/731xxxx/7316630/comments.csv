,uptownkilla2,2012-05-31T21:36Z,Can I burn this to a disk and install it on my Macbook Pro w/ Boot Camp?
,Zoisite,2012-05-31T21:39Z,"@uptownkilla2
You can burn it to a disk and install it, but you may run in to driver issues, since Win8 isn't supported by Apple yet."
,Dantix,2012-05-31T21:47Z,"You could add this link to Web Seeds to download faster

In uTorrent go to torrent Properties -> Advanced and paste link

Good luck"

Yes you can! :)  Macbook Pro's are very versatile and not to mention I too have one and it runs all Windows 8 OS Previews beautifully so far.  I will be installing this to replace my current Consumer Preview on the desktop and also on the Macbook Pro. Cheers :D"
,kingcover,2012-05-31T22:07Z,"Oh yes, almost forgot.  Zoisite is absolutely right.  The touchpad is the most troublesome issue, but other than that, everything worked OOTB!  However, just because it works for me, doesn't mean it will work for you.  It's hit or miss usually and a rist you'll have to be willing to take. ;)"

,nazim12366,2012-06-01T00:00Z,"so i read somewhere that if you already have the consumer preview installed, installing the release preview will erase all your data, is this true?

p.s. i have this as my main os, it's not on a partition or anything because i wanted to use this with my data, plus is there even a big difference between this and the consumer preview?"
,oreosxe,2012-06-01T01:09Z,"@Dantix
Great tip. I didn't know about that. Thanks!"
,Zoisite,2012-06-01T01:14Z,"@nazim12366
Yes, you need to erase your data to install this over the Consumer Preview. I also use Win8 as my main OS, so I just backed up to an external drive before formatting / installing.
As for your second question, yes this is an improvement. Not much has changed since the last version, but it is more stable and has better performance."
,AhoyYeMatey,2012-06-01T09:22Z,I tried downloading this from Microshaft but their shit servers canceled the download at 98%.  
,nazim12366,2012-06-01T15:17Z,"ok zoiste,
so i found out if i click migrate, my personal files will be saved in windows.old, so does that mean the things in libraries like my documents, my videos, my pictures etc. i really want to be sure :)"
,jmanno33o,2012-06-02T03:15Z,Can this be dual booted? Currently I'm dual-booting Windows 7 and Linux. I wonder if maybe I can either partition and add windows 8 on there or go right over Linux.

,Pendaws,2012-06-02T08:38Z,"Thanks for making this available here, MS has a VERY slow download speed. :)"
,jmanno33o,2012-06-05T05:12Z,"AAH! Thepiratebay ""Get this torrent"" links don't work with Windows 8! You click the link and nothing happens. How can this be fixed?"
,rakeshk,2012-06-05T10:54Z,"D76AD96773615E8C504F63564AF749469CFCCD57
is this the hash value of ISO??"
,Zoisite,2012-06-05T22:18Z,"@jmanno33o
Yeah I've been dealing with that for a while now, they haven't worked since the Consumer Preview. Just right click the ""get this torrent"" button and copy link address. Then go to utorrent and click ""add torrent from url"". It will auto paste the URL from your clipboard."
,seedANDtorrent,2012-06-06T01:17Z,"Thanks for seeding cause the Microsoft site is not letting me download the file.

Can't wait to see how Windows 8 looks and feels like on my laptop although I think its more for tablets than PC's :)"
,Dantix,2012-06-06T17:37Z,"@rupankur

Not in uTorrent preferences, in torrent properties (right click at the torrent in download list)"
,jmanno33o,2012-06-07T21:52Z,"@Zoisite
Oh wow thanks a lot, I didn't know that. I've tried opening in new tabs and windows, but I'll definitely try this...
..
With BitTorrent.."
,stevieb1,2012-06-08T20:07Z,Thanx :D prefer torrent downloadin 
,seedANDtorrent,2012-06-09T08:33Z,"I downloaded this from here (thanks Zoisite), burned it to a DVD CD, installed it on my 32-bit old Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop, AND ITS WORKING AND LOOKING GREAT!!! Thanks once again! :)"
,TJBab,2012-06-10T14:18Z,"does this remove everything from my previous OS?
I'm using Win8 Consumer Preview As My Main OS."
,nazim12366,2012-06-11T21:54Z,"@TJBab 
it deletes everything such as apps and stuff but your personal files like documents, photos, music etc. are saved in windows.old, also program files and such are saved"
,kilomlk0908,2012-07-15T06:03Z,hey guys i just signed up and  uploaded windows 8 64bit with watermark removal program and add features key https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7444711
,Ohegi,2012-08-10T13:56Z,"My computer BSOD'd with 5 minutes left on the download in a web browser. I decided to check if there was a torrent version and was not disappointed! Thank you!

Also, as Dantix said, add the original download (http://iso.esd.microsoft.com/WRPDL/D29D6C5B1D8AF956B5DA9DF738CFD92DFD4F6C8FB/Windows8-ReleasePreview-64bit-English.iso) as a web seed to download it faster."
