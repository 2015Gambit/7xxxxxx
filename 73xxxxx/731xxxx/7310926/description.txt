SIR, NO SIR! THE GI REVOLT - David Zeiger, USA, 2005 - The story of how active-duty American GIs, in their thousands, created a massive, unprecedented movement against the war in Vietnam that could not be stopped.

American documentary maker David Zeiger turns his attention to a movement he was part of - GIs against the Vietnam War. Though there has been much coverage of anti-war protests by students and civilians, the role of active servicemen, including the 500,000 who deserted over the course of the war, has been largely covered up.

Zeiger has unearthed a wealth of previously unseen footage, from moving footage shot by frontline soldiers, to GI produced anti-war newspapers. The programme gained exclusive rights to several documentaries revealing Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland's revue company performing to troops in the Far East and Fonda was persuaded to give an interview reflecting on the time.
