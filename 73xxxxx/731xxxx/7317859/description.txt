From IMDB:

"After witnessing the destruction of the Earth from orbit, a group of astronauts is sent back in time and given 5 years to prevent the disaster from happening."

Odyssey 5 was created and cancelled by Showtime after its first season in 2002, consisting of 20 episodes at 45 minutes each. The (in)complete series was released in box-set form in April, 2006. All of the current torrents of this series suck, and so I ripped and upped for the betterment of the masses.
