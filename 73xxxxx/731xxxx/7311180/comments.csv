With a nightlife as hot as the sun-soaked beaches during the day, THE CATALINA centers on the young, wild staff of The Catalina hotel in Miami’s South Beach. The fun-loving group, who form their own dysfunctional family unit, run a glamorous destination hotel while partying even harder than their guests. Eric Bischoff (“iMPACT Wrestling,” “Confessions of a Teen Idol”) and Jason Hervey (“iMPACT Wrestling,” “Confessions of a Teen Idol”) are executive producers. THE CATALINA is from Bischoff Hervey Entertainment.
