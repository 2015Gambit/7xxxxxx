A gem of a TV comedy, typical British biting satire about how imagery, spin and PR has taken over how news are presented. 

Stephen Fry in the lead role is ably supported by all his colleagues (co-actors) at the PR firm. 

Has both Season 1 and season 2, all episodes except e5 of s2, sorry, don't have that. 
Please seed !!
