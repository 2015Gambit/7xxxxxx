From the Goodreads description:

Valancy lives a drab life with her overbearing mother and prying aunt. Then a shocking diagnosis from Dr. Trent prompts her to make a fresh start. For the first time, she does and says exactly what she feels. As she expands her limited horizons, Valancy undergoes a transformation, discovering a new world of love and happiness. One of Lucy Maud Montgomery's only novels intended for an adult audience, The Blue Castle is filled with humour and romance.


Lucy Maude Montgomery's 'The Blue Castle' is a favourite book from my teens, and I wanted a copy for my Kindle, but couldn't find one.  Instead I found the text on the Australian version of Project Gutenberg and spent a bit of time making sure the layout looked 'clean' then converted it to .mobi.  I hope others enjoy it too.
