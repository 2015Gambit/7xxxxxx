Plot and cast
 Two soldiers on sick leave spend three nights at the Hollywood Canteen before returning to active duty in the 
 South Pacific. Slim Green (Hutton) is the millionth G.I. to enjoy the Canteen, and consequently wins a date 
 with Joan Leslie. The other G.I., Sergeant Nolan, (Clark) gets to dance with Joan Crawford. Canteen founders 
 Bette Davis and John Garfield give talks on the history of the Canteen. The soldiers enjoy a variety of musical 
 numbers performed by a host of Hollywood stars.
