,cldrain,2012-06-01T03:42Z,"hard coded sub is Korean which is why you should use yellow sub so you can see things more clear.

who would thought Indonesia violence is more violent than Hollywood violence.  

Overall, good quality and good movie.  "

,Spitven0m,2012-06-03T16:45Z,fuck hollywood and animalmcburger. This is the best film for fights i have seen since ip man
,animalmcburger,2012-06-03T18:37Z,"Fuck Hollywood?  You guys are a joke.  The only reason any of us are here are because of Hollywood.

The ring and movies like that?  Yeah, they're Japanese.  A first world country with first world capabilities.

The only other exception was them taking infernal affairs and making it a feature

People, no country comes even close with the capabilities of hollywood.  Seriously, if you knew anything about quality, you wouldn't be watching this shit.  "
,animalmcburger,2012-06-03T18:42Z,"indonesia? I would talk shit about your 0 achievements as a people throughout history but we won't go there.  Maybe about your jungle language and how it sounds like 2 monkeys fucking but I won't go there.  So what else did INDONESIA do?  maybe give the world a new and exciting cuisine?  fuck no.   Hot women?  LOL NO.  maybe 1 single great thinker?  lol no.  You've had thousands of years to do something for this world and ""THE RAID redemption"" is what you have to show for it?

If you're from indonesia, go fuck off.

I'm chinese and even though we actually did something with ourselves, I'm still the first to admit our film industry is shit."
,animalmcburger,2012-06-03T18:52Z,"Indonesia?  really?  I won't bad mouth how your country has never contributed to our society as a whole in any form.  I could go into how you have an ugly language, you haven't had one decent thinker/mind come out of that country EVER, not one single invention, don't start with the cuisine.  maybe a super model to show case your womens' beauty?  no?  can't name one?  I'm glad after thousands of years, your people managed to put out a d movie.

You may all be haters but analyze the fucking movie objectively.  Look at the way the so called police officers move.  Hardly tactical.  Hollywood would've spend thousands researching that shit and then hire a fucking seal team member as a consultant.  It's simply low budget and low quality shit.  I dont' have to watch it to know that it's basically a complete shit of a storyline with some okay action thrown in."

,nosing_glass,2012-06-07T15:38Z,"this film is highly entertaining (seen another copy of it, so cant talk about a/v here). 
well, it may not be logic or realistic but who cares, its about gory action, especially martial arts' carnage.  
the fighting scenes are waaay better than anything hollywood has to offer in that regards. 
true, the americans have made some great flicks but also tons of rubbish and lame remakes and they suck when it comes to close combat techniques in films.
when there were some decent fight scenes coming from holllywood there were always either choreographers or actors from other countries involved because they cant do it of their own properly.
there are also plenty of films from other nations which effortlessly can stand comparison to any american movie of the same genre.
oh, one more thing, interessting is that hollywood prefers to shoot in other countries, since its cheaper and easier. "

It's not, every movie has the same rating scale, and this is no exception.
