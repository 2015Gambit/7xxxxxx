,BigG95,2012-05-30T23:08Z,it's not fake..all you have to do is extract the files into your arkham city folder and that's it. if you're wondering how to start the dlc go to the main menu you'll see harley quinns revenge:) it's that simple..thx uploader

,atm743,2012-05-31T03:26Z,does not work for steam version. old dlc works but this does not. dont see anything on main screen for harleys revenge and it crashes the game when trying to look at the charactor models (trophies) 
,baronxs,2012-05-31T04:57Z,"@atm743. I had the same problem. Start a save of the base game (first option in the main menu), then quit back to the menu. The DLC should be accessible."
,FlyTaggart90,2012-05-31T05:10Z,"baronxs is correct, all I needed to do was launch my regular save then return to the main menu and it worked perfectly. Awesome torrent, unfortunately  lame dlc. I beat it in about an hour, but its still worth playing if you liked the base game."
,Nuly,2012-05-31T06:01Z,It work!
,Taosinky,2012-05-31T07:52Z,"WORK WITH LEGIT STEAM GAME ! 

Not at the first lunch, but at the second lunch and after have make a Benchmark test, curiously, ""The Harley Queen Revenge"" option add to the main menu of the game.

Only one problem, after apply the DLC, save of the main game are no longer available.

If you find the save game folder of this DLC, please, share it... because, if we paste the official savegame (C:UsersxxxDocumentsWB GamesBatman Arkham City) on the DLC save game folder, perphaps, save of the main game will be available again."
,Taosinky,2012-05-31T07:55Z,"Ho ! and one more thing. This DLC is MULTILANGUAGE. (work with french voices + subtitles for me, and my mainly game is in french - i am french -)"
,Rojagegeo,2012-05-31T09:08Z,im not convinced....those screenshots are just promotional pics for Arkham city...they arent related to this dlc...why say they are screenshots?
,acidSEEDtpb,2012-05-31T09:45Z,"Works fine with blackbox version, just start new game and it will show up in the main menu then, though it did fuck up my save and it crashes now if you try to use the ""model feature"" on main menu."
,BartMan97,2012-05-31T09:57Z,"you guys are noobs, 
I've got it working on the Steam version, and my save is perfectly fine. The only thing that doesn't work is trophies, but the mission itself is fully playable"
,grandmasterdude,2012-05-31T11:49Z,i can't find any setup.exe ....... please help
,juvemp01,2012-05-31T12:34Z,@grandmasterdude there is no setup.exe it's the wrong description in this info. you just extract to where your batman arkham city is installed

Any solution?"
,matg7,2012-06-02T10:44Z,"SteXmaN
what do you mean Do a clean install then move the DLC to the install folder and youre done. please instructions"
,vecuccio,2012-06-02T16:37Z,"It works. But it's really not worth it because it is very short, and you can't play any Riddler Challenges - as the game crashes if you try. So you have to do a complete re-install."
,Rojagegeo,2012-06-02T17:41Z,doesnt work...atleast not for me...im using the blackbox version

,ukdhuri212,2012-06-03T06:14Z,
,teck157713,2012-06-03T09:02Z,Hey don't listen to his step. Open the file and extract into Batman Arkham City Directory. Run the benchmark and go back to the menu. There you will see Harley Quinn Revenge
,vviivveekkk,2012-06-03T09:29Z,"yes I agree with teck157713 , I am using blackbox version, and it works fine, all saves are working both for the main story and the dlc. the torrent includes the updates, as well as the updated crack. u just have to run the included .exe file and it will ask to extract, then just extract it to ur game folder, start the game, then options -->benchmark. then Harley DLC will show in main menu. all working fine. 

the only problem wid me is that u always have to run benchmark once after u exit the game, to show the DLC in main menu.. but the saves work..

thanks Heromaster."

,eyeonus,2012-06-04T13:55Z,"The error that causes the crash is:

Couldn't find package for ChallengeMap57_SF requested by async loading code.

,eyeonus,2012-06-04T14:23Z,"The crash is caused (for me, at least) by not having the file ""ChallengeMap57_SF.upk"" in the CookedPCConsole folder. When I copied ""ChallengeMap56_SF.upk"" and renamed it, the crash no longer happened."
,eyeonus,2012-06-04T17:14Z,"And the trophy is caused by the file ""CVDLC_Char6_SF.upk"" being missing. I would guess it has something to do with the ""Batman Inc. Batsuit"", since the trophy room has an empty icon for that trophy. The suit loads correctly, just its icon is missing."
,eyeonus,2012-06-04T17:56Z,"From my experience, the crash after installing this DLC is caused by the following:

Crashing when loading Challenges: Not having the ""Batcave"" challenge map.

The SIMON release here http://dreamwas.net/bbs/board.php?bo_table=qtorrent_game&wr_id=4457&page=9 has this challenge map, but you need to be a member to DL that torrent. I'm downloading the torrent here http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6864185/Batman.Arkham.City.PROPER-SiMON to see if it has it as well. I have yet to find it anywhere else.

Crashing when loading Trophies: Not having the ""Batman Inc. Batsuit"" DLC.

You can get this by copying downloading this file: http://download.xbox.com/content/57520fa0/57520fa00ecf000f.cab and extracting the files in ""Contents"" to your CookedPCConsole folder using 7zip or any other archive program that can handle cab files. You have to do this BEFORE installing the Harley Quinn DLC."

,akilesh,2012-06-17T18:59Z,"thanks man.. works fine. this is how I installed:
1) of course download 1st.
2) just open the downloded application.
3) it asks where to extract. extract it to where u installed BATMAN ARKHAM CITY .
4) during extraction it asks whether to -copy and              replace or dont copy etc.
  but i copied and replaced.
5)now open batman game and continue ur story 
   mode. after loading ur savepoint , quit to main menu. there in the main menu u can find an icon -harley quinn's revenge. DONE

the main batman game i downloaded is BATMAN ARKHAM CITY PROPER-SIMON uploaded by vNa5h"
,akilesh,2012-06-17T19:03Z,"i didnt have any craches or problems.

love batman arkham city"
,Franky3121,2012-06-21T10:25Z,"Ok this is how i did it. 
1. Extract the folder anywhere.
2. The files in inside that are named ""BMGAME"" and ""Binaries"" must be copied into the install directory.
3. It will ask you to merge the files say yes, after that everything is copy and replace.
4.Now when you head into the game Harley Quinns face will appear on the main menu click it.
4(other option). Run benchmark that is found in your options menu ""test performance"" after that go back to the menu and see if her icon is ther.
5.Click and play"

,lisdead,2012-07-09T20:51Z,"It works but it's a really bad rip. You'll be able to play the DLC, but say goodbye to the challenge mode and your character trophies because after installing the DLC, the game will freeze when you try to access these game modes.
