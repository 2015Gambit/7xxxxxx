,X_Light,2012-06-02T10:09Z,@Zoisite I'm wonder why is that only 2 GB?
,WinMetro,2012-06-02T17:55Z,This torrent is bullshit ok. If your wondering why it's 2GB because it's corrupted. I had a error installing Windows 8 Release Preview the infamous screen 'Choose a Driver to install' That tells ya right there that your ISO is corrupt. So it's better to download from MS or BA FTP.
,Zoisite,2012-06-03T22:02Z,"I looked at and seems that utorrent created this torrent incorrectly. The ISO I had downloaded is complete, yet the torrent only shows 2GB of it. For some reason the site isn't letting me delete this torrent, but do not download it and expect it to work."
,gr8john,2012-06-04T01:29Z,"I am trying it out on Virtualbox software first as I do with all alternative OS I test out.
But from what I can gather beforehand, this seems to be just an effort to get into tablet market by MS and nothing more...  Really, I was expecting more from a goliath of software industry...  You guys should go check out Ubuntu for android.  Now there is a step in the right direction!"
,quinotto,2012-06-05T16:32Z,"this torrent is incomplete. DONT DOWNLOAD. IT's only 2.0GB, it should be 2.4GB"
