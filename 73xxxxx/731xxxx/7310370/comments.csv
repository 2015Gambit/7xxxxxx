Blu-Ray 3D Ripper is expired!"
,bxvipp,2012-05-29T22:21Z,"I get the message that the
Blu-Ray 3D Ripper is expired "
,witchmaster,2012-05-30T06:11Z,"Yep, 3D ripper expired."
,Agent666,2012-05-30T15:55Z,"3D RIPPER 'EXPIRED' !

LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE ADDED SOMETHING NEW TO COMBAT CRACKS!"
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-06-05T23:50Z,"""dvd xxxxx has expired"" [replace xxxxx with ""Clone"" or ""Copy"" etc. is displayed even after the crack is copied to the program folder. I am guessing the existing crack that has been around has been ""fixed"" by DVDFab?"
,PapiDJ,2012-06-22T02:16Z,"I had no problems. These ""there is an error"" comments appear to be a hoax."
,PapiDJ,2012-06-22T02:23Z,"Just install the program, restart computer, copy cracked file to dvdfab install directory, run dvdfab, continue from the registered window, press X to close lookup, click on the green tick, and turn off ""Check for new versions automatically"" under the general settings, click OK. Close and Restart DVDfab and it is now registered for ever.

I personally also block programs like this in Windows Firewall from using the internet before I run them for the first time."
