,St3althish,2012-06-01T12:04Z,Sad to see Kevin leave. I teared up a little when Sara started crying. Kevin leaving is truly the end of a era. I hope AOTS can still  be the same afterwards.
,gveers,2012-06-01T13:14Z,That was so sad. Really gonna miss Kevin. Hope Matt Mira gets the gig after Kevin.
[V],alexisthebest,2012-06-01T23:54Z,"I really is a shame he's leaving.


Also, there will not be a weekend edition this week.

Good news is that Kevin will still be here for E3, so look forward to that."

You know E3 is going right?
AOTS is never on during E3 because they're the ones covering it that whole week.

And another thing, we're in June.

the 1st day of E3 (Monday June 4th) is here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7329139/G4.E3.2012.Live.Day.1.HDTV.x264-LMAO"
