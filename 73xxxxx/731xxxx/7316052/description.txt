Safe.2012.RC.BDRip.XviD.AC3.5-1.HQ.Hive-CM8



Sources:

Video: Russian Bluray
Audio: Unknowns Line + Russian 5.1 Channels
Subs: from Majestics file
thx

Encode:

the line audio that made the rounds which sounds slightly like a mic too, was originally from unknown.
but nobody thanked them so far, which is sad. doing it here now, thx
this audio got cleaned and butchered and mixed with russian audio badly buy a lot of groups till now.
What came out is a lot worse than the original was to begin with, which i liked a lot.
if its really a line is hard to say, a lot indicates that it is, if its a mic its a damned good one :=)
i took the original audio and synced it lipsync to the russian bluray.
i would say its 99,99% lipsync, was a loads of hours work. its perfect and in sync now.
at the 1m40sec mark there is a short static noise for 10 secs or so,which i tried to remove as much as possible

I cleaned the russian 5.1 track from loads of voices, and entered the synced audio back into the russian track.
came out very nice

the subs came from the majestics srt file which i hardcoded with the video after retiming it for the bluray which had a different framerate.
this subs like all other version around are ONLY for the chinese spoken parts and not for the couple russian lines
nobody translated them so far, and i dont speak russian, so it is like it is. dont see a problem with that.

this will do till retail
enjoy
