,danfour,2012-06-01T05:49Z,"zx6rider - Judge Judy is the number one syndicated show on TV right now and pretty much the best mix of comedy, reality and drama of all time. Some of us JJ fanatics don't have TVs, so mdprosser's uploads are very much appreciated. You sound like you're upset at how she treats your fellow morons."
,danfour,2012-06-01T05:52Z,"Short answer: Judge Judy is the best, followed closely by mdprosser."
,keeganzo,2012-06-01T07:31Z,"right on, danfour...I waited years for JJ to show up in torrents cuz I live work in southeast Asia where there is no chance to see her. mdprosser makes my day...everyday...with a new JJ ep"
