Raptor Safari is a journey of one raptor and his trusty sidekick: A 4x4 Sport Utility Vehicle. His mission? To run down prehistoric brethren in the past to harvest them as taco meat for the future. Or something like that. Actually, forget it. Here's the important part: You're driving around in a badass 4x4 as a monocled raptor doing stunts and killing things. This is the most amount of fun ever recorded in the history of man or raptor.
