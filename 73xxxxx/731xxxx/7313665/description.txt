Today's pack includes all the DCU titles for May 30, 2012.  Since it is an FAQ, Week 1 included Justice League 1 and Flashpoint 5 and was considered the beginning of the reboot. Week 14 was a short week and included 3 DCU comics,including THUNDER Agents, Secret Files, and Batman: Odyssey #2.  And now Week 27 is a short week with 5 titles and only one offical 52 title.
