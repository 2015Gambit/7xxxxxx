( sorry i just signed up so im kinda a noob)"
,NeroTurbo,2012-06-07T08:37Z,"@Black_flame55
i don't know if you have multiplayer, i did not check it. i like SP and storys more XD
maybe there will be.

there is a how-to in the readme."
,brandenm,2012-06-12T15:39Z,"alright, after watching this sit at 99.9% for 2 days i swicthed over to http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7341731/Battlefield_3-Reloaded_%28SKRILL69%29 because NeroTurbo apparently can't be bothered to seed the last 8MB piece, what an ass.

***PLEASE NOTE: you can take the 13.5GB you've already downloaded here, rename to skrill69 filenames and overwrite them, force-recheck, and start up in skrill69's swarm at 99.9%. that's what i did and i'm the only seed there (it was also started by an ass with no intention of seeding), i wouldn't mind some help seeding it!"
,NeroTurbo,2012-06-13T18:17Z,"i didn't know, but hey, thanks for telling me ""Hey, can you please seed a little""?
No, instead you call me an ass.
i would seed if someone would ask me to.
Douche.

,Polla123,2012-06-13T18:41Z,"@brandenm
So you just copy the isos to the other file and overwrite them?
Thats all?"
,Polla123,2012-06-13T18:44Z,@neroturbo seed please
,NeroTurbo,2012-06-13T21:42Z,"@Polla123
Sure i will.
i'l be seeding for a couple daysweek."
,brandenm,2012-06-15T18:19Z,"@neroturbo
you shouldn't have to have someone tell you to seed, you're the original seeder. an original seeder who stops seeding leaving the swarm with only 99.9% of the torrent available (exactly like you've done) is an ass. there's a lot of people who have GB limits imposed by ISP's, they have to be careful how much they download, and when they waste 13.49GB because some ass isn't uploading the last 8MB piece..."

1) rename this torrent's folder from ""Battlefield3 NeroTurbo"" to ""Battlefield 3-Reloaded""
2) rename ""Battlefield.3-RedistBy-NeroTurbo-DVD1-RELOADED.iso"" to ""rld-bf3a.iso""
3) rename """"Battlefield.3-RedistBy-NeroTurbo-DVD2-RELOADED.iso"" to ""rld-bf3b.iso""
4) delete ""Important-READ!.txt""
5) download and start skrill69's torrent, it should automatically see the folder and files for it already exist and do a re-check. when the re-check finishes you should be able to continue from 99% already complete."
,insanehound,2012-06-15T22:20Z,"Can someone seed, please?"
,NeroTurbo,2012-06-18T13:59Z,"@brandenm

Well i didn't know, im not much into torrents.
i seeded to the end and done my job now.

i just find your insults plain stupid and out of place any way, it seems easy for people to go on and bash people with such insults rather san ask or explain.

im done with this conversation, and am done seeding this.
Enjoy your game."
