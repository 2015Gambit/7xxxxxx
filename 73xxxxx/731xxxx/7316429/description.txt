REDISTRIBUTED BY NeroTurbo
ORIGIN: RELOADED.

QUICK HOWTO:
you need Daemon Tools
you can get it for free, search it on google.

load the first image and start to install
when it asks for the next disc, load the second image (with the "DVD2" in its name) and continue.
crack in one of the images, just load and then go to my computer, then right click the image and explore.

READ THE "Important-READ!.txt" file, it must be important. i don't know, maybe the name might hint you that.
