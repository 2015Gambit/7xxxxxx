V─ùjopatis

V─ùjopatis is a dub techno artist and a musician from Lithuania. Started to make electronic music when he was still going to school. Went through a lot of different styles and genres. Nikolaj (his real name) was into ambient and chill out, but after he found out about dub techno, he realised that this is the genre where he can  put together rhythm and ambience.

ΓÇ£My biggest source of inspiration is city and nature. City could not exist without natre. ThereΓÇÖs harmony everywhere, and a human lives in that harmony. I can see nature in the city at night. City traffic is like a river, even the sound is similair to a river. Flat apartaments is like concrete forest. The most inspiring thing to me is an idea, that each, nature and a city have their own special music.ΓÇ¥
