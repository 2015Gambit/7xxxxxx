I managed to get hold of the Full Installation of REX Essential 
through some contacts I got over the Internet.

This is the Full REX Essential Installation, meaning you don't have to have any previous version of REX installed on your computer prior to REX Essential.
the Version is REX "3.0.2012.0522" 

I haven't tried REX myself as I am an AS2012 personally, but I heard 
it's a good improvement over the older REX 2 version.

once you tried it out; If you Like it, then Buy it.

I always buy my FSX addons stuff I use, surprisingly even though I distribute 
here many stuff, I buy all my stuff and I encourage to do the same..
I distribute the stuff for you to try before buying...

Let us Know how this Addon is....
