Here I share the four releases of Remedy Drive that I have been able to get hold of. These are:

"Light Makes A Way EP" from 2011
"Daylight Is Coming" from 2008
"Rip Open The Skies" from 2006
"Magnify" from 2004 (their band name was "Remedy" at that time)

I didn't rip these myself, they have been downloaded from various sites across the 'net - thanks to the original uploaders, and of course to Remedy Drive for giving us this great music, and to God for creating the band members.

If you like their Music, go and buy their Albums to support them, they have deserved it!

Please seed, and share what was shared with you, to put it in TorrentTract's words.

God Bless You!
