 This is the first movie for Bette Davis & the second (available) for Bogart
 
         I don't remember where I got this movie from (it was quite a while ago) 
         I got it as a 2 - part 001 file and I was unable to extract it.
         was able to play the 001 file with VLC , & It just dawned on me 
         to try recording  it with VLC ,which created an AVI file. 
         Strangely - it won't play with MPC.
         This is the version with the on screen display in the opening seconds , 
         BUT the picture is much better
