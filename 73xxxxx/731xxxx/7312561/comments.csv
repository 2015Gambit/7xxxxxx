I can't extract the files using winrar, so I downloaded 7z and tried extracting the files with it. It starts the extraxtion process and creates the folder. But I can't even open that folder and when I right click on it with my mouse, only the following options show:
(Open
Explore
Search...
Open as Notebook in OneNote 
Send to)
What am I doing wrong?"

and hit transfer and create either an ISO or a WBFS file, whichever one you use when you play backups."
