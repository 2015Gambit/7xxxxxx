Fatal Frame IV [R4ZJ01][U][EnglishHardPatch]

Hello.

With this, you do NOT have to use the original disc to play the translated game. You do not need the translation files at all.


With this, you CAN run the ISO in USB Loader GX, Neogamma, or Wiiflow; and it will play in the translated English done by Tempus and his wonderful team.

What is this?

R4ZJ01 (Japanese Everything) -> *Region set to USA, Update Partition Removed, Fully Translated English Text*


I have taken the liberty to hard-patch the translation into the Japanese iso.
So it does not need to read the translation patch files from SD card.

The game has been RegionFrii'd from 00(JAP) to 01(USA).
There is no need to BrickBlock, there is not an update partition anymore.

Translation was compiled into the ISO directly using PartitionBuilder and WiiScrubber140Multiboot.


Running the iso through RegionFrii will display gamecode mismatch.

Notes:

* For USB Loaders, your game has a high chance of freezing in the first locked room in-game unless you install every wad that I have included in this torrent.*

I have included WAD Manager 1.7.

Install the WAD files using WAD Manager 1.7.

I recommend USB Loader GX as a great backup loader.

If you need:

Homebrew Channel
USB Loader GX
Or any missing IOS...

Then use Google to find it. Simple as that.

My personal recommendation:

* Do NOT update your system menu past 4.1. *
