Men live off the grid by braving harsh weather, deadly wildlife and limited supplies in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains, Montana's Rockies and the Alaskan wilderness, where they gather necessities to survive the approaching season of winter.
                                                                                

RELEASE NOTES: Hybrid. Some short clips in original source are FILM but the majority is 29.97 FPS. Had to use CRF 23 to try and help keep file size down. Didn't work very well as this series (this episode at least) has a lot of motion.
