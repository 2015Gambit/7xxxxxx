This Green Lantern season one that he has upped looks great so far.  

A/V: 10/10

Hope you keep up the great work and get your pink or green badge soon!"

lol 
furthermore
BDA...most agreed, very good work Hedemoney, more so, is it just me or did this series develop well...much like justice league before it, the stories outshine any other qualms others may have, myself included
im suprisingly surprised
and have since found a new respect for projects involving Bruce Timm, who i not so recently for lack of better terms ""bashed"" online
my apologies 
nice up
