obviously overall bit rate 1795 for 1080p it's enough just for playing on portable devices with small screens 5""-13"" inch [smarphones, tablets..]

Obviously Bits/(Pixel*Frame) very low!


It could be very good job..but only in that conditions !!

For good quality playing on 20-27"" PC monitor fullHD or HDTV even bigger [102"" or more] you need something else[diffrent settings and bigger filesize.


Good Luck!"
