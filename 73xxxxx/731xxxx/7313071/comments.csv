,potprinc3,2012-05-31T22:44Z,Hey Sujai mate does the Blu Ray of this movie have the alternate version or the Uncut version called The Convincer? Please do tell. Thanks for your ups :)
,Mutegrill,2012-06-01T02:13Z,"potprinc3:

Thin Ice - International (imdb display title) (English title) / USA (imdb display title)
The Convincer - USA (festival title)

I agree it gets a bit confusing when the title on pbay uses a non-imdb display title, but links to just that."
,potprinc3,2012-06-01T22:54Z,"@ mutegrill: This version was recut by the studio/producers and scenes were deleted. The OST was changed as well, all without the involvement of Jill Sprecher, the director.

The convincer was the original cut screened at the festival.
This is the recut. 

Thanks go to Sujai nevertheless."
[V],sujaidr,2012-06-02T01:36Z,"@potprinc3 and @Mutegrill ,the only release out there is the scene release of this blu ray version of the movie and thats been re encoded here for u guys.......there has still been no release for the festival version....even i would like to see the directors version of the movie but it isnt available rite now,take care :)"
