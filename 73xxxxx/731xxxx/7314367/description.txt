Notice.txt

*Remixed by Deru, the same file found in Colonized 01. 

This torrent also includes all available cover art. 

I only provided the tracks by Yasume for the albums by various artists, 
except for Colonized 01, which for which I've provided all in FLAC. 
Once I own all of the CD's, I will upload all of the albums in FLAC.
