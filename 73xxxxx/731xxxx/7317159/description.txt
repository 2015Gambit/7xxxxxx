New Mutants Volume 3.

Now grown-up and experienced in battle, many of the original cast of the New Mutants have teamed-up to form a new team of X-Men.

The line-up strongly resembles the original roster of the New Mutants, except for Wolfsbane who is a member of the secretive wetworks team, X-Force. The other original members including de-powered Dani Moonstar, Karma, Sunspot, Magma and the recently resurrected Illyana Rasputin follow orders from Cannonball.


This includes all issues on New Mutants Vol.3 from issue 1-43.

Also includes the 2010 mini series New Mutants Forever.
