,Dimmis80,2012-05-31T11:58Z,Hey mate.I am glad to see u that u are still here..I can understand about work and long hours and u don't have much time but if u find the way and manage to upload days like u did before that it would be epic and just awesome..And ofcorse very much apreciated my friend.And if our other uploader continues to upload to and help u when u realy don't have the time we will be very cool and happy.What can i do Days is my favorite kind of show and i think the best in its kind.And i have a question.Before some time i remember that u told us that:Carie-Madison-Jack and Austin will be fired from the show because they hire a new writer or something.!But they all still there and at large.!So whats the latest news.???

,disnfab,2012-06-01T13:59Z,That sucks... I really like Joseph Mascolo... He's one of the reasons I started watching DooL at the beginning of this year. I first saw him as Massimo Marone in B&B.
