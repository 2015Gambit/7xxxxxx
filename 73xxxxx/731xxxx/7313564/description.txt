What is IDA all about?

IDA is a Windows, Linux or Mac OS X hosted multi-processor disassembler and debugger that offers so many features it is hard to describe them all.

Hello all!

My 9th and hardest torrent so far. This was requested by many. I could't find a crack for this Application so I made my own :D. This took quite a few hours of work to get to the stage it's at. This is basically the windows version ported to Mac OSX pre-cracked. The instructions are simple: Unzip and Enjoy!

Since this is a port I expect bugs so please report any and all in the comments. Also check there before complaining it doesn't work.

Please Let Me Know If I'm Doing Alright. I Need Motivation.

PLEASE SEED! I Will Provide Cake!
