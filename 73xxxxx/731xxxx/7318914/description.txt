Viz Magazine UK June 2012

Viz has been gracing British newsagentsΓÇÖ shelves since 1979. Its irreverent 
mix of bad language, childish cartoons and sharp satire has seen its creators 
hauled over the coals by the United Nations, questioned by Scotland YardΓÇÖs 
anti-terrorist branch and exhibited in the Tate Gallery. VizΓÇÖs comic characters, 
such as the Fat Slags, Sid the Sexist, and Roger Mellie the foul-mouthed Man on 
the Telly, as well as its hugely popular Top Tips and Profanisaurus sections, 
are firmly established as national institutions, just like Broadmoor Hospital 
for the Criminally Insane. *ManufacturerΓÇÖs estimate.
