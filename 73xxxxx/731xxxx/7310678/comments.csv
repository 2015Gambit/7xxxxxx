[V],catflap,2012-05-29T23:57Z,"the first 30 secs or so were not recorded
because ITV1 screwed up.

all of my recordings are set to begin five minutes
before the stated start time and end five minutes
after the stated end time.

in this case ITV1 started the broadcast
more than 5 minutes earlier than the
stated start time.

but nothing important is missing. you'll see
what i mean when you watch it."
