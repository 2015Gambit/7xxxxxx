,sora1203,2012-05-30T08:24Z,hello despoiler! many thanks on all your uploads! you've been my favorite source of the cartoons I watch because of timely uploads and small file sizes. Can I make a request? Can you upload a smaller 480p version of Green Lantern Episodes 9-10? It's for when I want to copy the series into a DVD. I think these 720p copies are too much for the DVD capacity wise. TIA!
