Italy, 1944. As the war takes its toll on Allied forces in Europe, a squadron of black pilots known as the Tuskegee Airmen are finally given the chance to prove themselves in the sky - even as they battle discrimination on the ground. Its a tribute to the unsung heroes who rose above extraordinary challenges and ultimately soared into history.
