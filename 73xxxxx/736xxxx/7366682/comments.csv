HERE ARE THE STAGES FOR SP BF2 That i tweaked for the hind.....operation amos , urban raid , ami_basis 2 , frostbite , iwo jima ... ive also added all the highest level weaponry for every infantry spec ops, medic,  sniper etc etc..and i have all the 64 size maps that u get to play in multiplayer in singleplayer mode like dagin oil fields and operation road rage with the a10 and little birds and the su 39 frogger.... Operation Smoke Screen with the Euro tiger fighting chopper that baby is sweet to fly no lie lol.....and all you need to do is email me id see if i can get my level files to you guys  email=rayv3n79@hotmail.com....and to install i suggest you have to (level) files in your  games directory FOR EXAMPLE  (Level SP) , and (Level MP) and swap from one when u want to play sp or multiplayer.....im only waiting on the ah64 apache files and when i get that i'll add that to my sp levels and then get back at you guys tc..and experience sp mode with the ahe_mi24HIND"
