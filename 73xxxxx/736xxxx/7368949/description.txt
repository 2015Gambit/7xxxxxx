Tati Russo, Taylor Russo, Lexi Belle, Evan Stone, Xander Corvus, Anthony Rosano, Barry Scott, Jerry Xoe and Hank are on the run from a set of murderous Twins, out to avenge the theft of their money by Xoe's hand. They're hiding in a hotel with a briefcase full of stolen money and a car trunk full of camping gear. After a few days spent hiding out in the woods, running from the twins and wondering how to evade them, they finally found a hotel to hide in. But the net is closing in fast. Xoe thinks the twins are right behind her... but things might not be so simple. In fact, none of this may be happening at all. Everything - the stolen money, the twins, the chase - might all just be pigments of Xoe's imagination. It all just might be In Her Head
