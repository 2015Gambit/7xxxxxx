,nikesoccer21,2012-06-27T01:13Z,"thanks, been trying to get it all day the bay was being a little weird wouldn't load."
,jagscads,2012-06-27T17:48Z,"I've downloaded about 75% of the complete album, and I opened some of the audio that I've downloaded, and the quality is bloody amazing. But for some reason, it doesn't go past 75%. I left it to download for 5 hours, and it just didn't move. It's definitely not my internet, that's working perfectly well. 

10/10 for the audio, though. 
But it'd be much better if more people seeded. :P "
