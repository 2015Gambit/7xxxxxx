,vincexii,2012-06-23T00:58Z,"Hi! This is the developer of Resonance, Vince Twelve. I'm glad that you guys are enthusiastic to play the game, even if you are going the torrent route to do so. I just ask that if you play the game and like it you tell a friend, or at least send me an email letting me know that you liked it! And maybe you'll like it so much that you'd consider buying a copy. 

Buy it through Wadjet Eye Games and you'll get a DRM free download plus a Steam key for only $10. That's a pretty good deal right?

Anyways, I worked on this game for five years, paid for all the art and music out of my own pocket, and would like to make more games like it. So, if you'd like to support small indie developers like me, please consider buying the game or at least sending me an email to cheer on my efforts. Thank you! Enjoy the game!

You can find an email link for me at the bottom of my website: http://xiigames.com"
,fromasterjay,2012-06-23T01:44Z,"@vincexii I appreciate your calmness...  I would have thought that a developer such as yourself would flip his lid seeing people DL their game... essentially for free.

I was on the fence about playing your game, and was wondering if it was worth the $10...  But you come across as a pretty decent dude that is really passionate about his craft.  Someone that just wants people to enjoy his art, and is not hung up on making $$ like so many people in the industry.  And because of that, I think I will head on over to Wadjet Eye and purchase your game.

Oh...Just out of curiosity, and please, you don't have to go into detail, how much does making a game like this cost?  5 years is a long time!!"
,vincexii,2012-06-23T05:04Z,"Thanks fromasterjay.  I appreciate your honesty on the matter.

It's hard to estimate the true cost in terms of time spent for me.  I was working on this game in my spare time in between having a wife, two kids, and a full-time job.  I worked between the hours of 10pm and 2am most nights.  So, when I calculate the cost of making this game, I'm not factoring in my own man-hours and lost sleep.  But I spent several thousand dollars of my own money on assets from freelance artists, animators, and musicians AND had to give away large percentages of the game's profits to get it done.

So, while the most important thing to me was to make a great game and share it with the world, I would also hope that I can earn some money for my efforts and I thank you for deciding to buy it!  Let me know if you think it was worth the ten bucks in the end!  I'm sure you'll be satisfied!"

,meshin,2012-07-16T14:44Z,@vincexii: i admit i pirated Gemini Rue and it blow me away.. i'm now buying Resonance no matter what
,tinynik,2012-07-25T22:33Z,"I'm going to give the game a try. If I spend more than 1 or 2 hours playing it, I'll plop down the $9.99.
I think perhaps more than one or two indie developers have found their work on TPB, but I think it's the first time I've seen author and community directly engage while treating each other with a certain tacit respect. 
I know there's some a-hole who will ruin this by being a jerk. Trolls can smell humanity a mile away.
Nonetheless, if I get pleasure from it, i will pay. If not, well, i gave it an honest shot to get my dollar. I really try to be fair to indie developers, and during the recent steam sale I did pick up quite a number of indie titles that I've come back to several times this year.
I'm not saying it's 100% moral and within the law, but I hope a few people have a policy of rewarding good work, like I do. "
,lostflguy,2012-07-26T09:04Z,"if thats really the developer commenting, thats just awesome. being more in touch with the fanbase, albeit pirates on this site, is something that the big studios severely lack. 
i know its a catch 22, once you sell to enough people its virtually impossible to interact with all of them, but at the same time us pc gamers are fed up with drm, day 1 dlc, and a lack of input or feedback by the big guys.
so its refreshing to read a dev commenting on a site that is basically taking money out of his pocket because people turn to piracy as a result of what the large cookie cutter companies are doing to the business.

tldr - support the small guys who are doing what they love and making money as a necessity. if you play it for more than 5 min buy it"
,xEminX,2012-09-08T17:31Z,"Its the first time I've ever seen a developer posting on TPB. If I enjoy playing the game, I'd surely like to pay for it. "
