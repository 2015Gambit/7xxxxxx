,xalamanderx,2012-06-20T05:56Z,Does it need any activation or passwords? Minimum hardware requirements?
,nileshtambe,2012-06-20T08:16Z,"no password,
for activation u have to use ur own i have not included any activator,loader or remove wat reason for this is some ppl complain that this torrent contains malware,virus,spyware

Minimum hardware requirements

but still u can install it on system having 512mb ram and 3/4 gb HDD."
,xalamanderx,2012-06-20T10:46Z,"OK, I installed it in a P4 1.6 GHz 380 Mb RAM and it worked, but I dont have activation code, can you please write down here yours so I can use it otherwise in 30 days I will be in trouble. It takes after installation 3 Gb of a 4 Gb disk. Thanks."

,randallytxt,2012-06-20T11:47Z,"THANKS ! I ran the program you gave me the url and after restarting the win7 was activated ! It works fine, in fact I still use Win98 (my favorite) and XP when I have no choice (programs) but this allows me to be ready for Win7 when it becomes unavoidable. Great and small solution."
,rahul123patil123,2012-06-20T11:55Z,"gr8 work man

we are really grateful to you!!!
Thanks for sharing your hard work"
,randallytxt,2012-06-22T06:28Z,"It installs perfect, with minimum 380 RAM as long as it is an ATX computer, takes about 2.9 disk space,  BUT the big problem is there are no drivers for older cards, SO they are trying with Win 7 to make people spend money on new cards and new PCs, so I tell Win 7: GOOD RIDDANCE, even if they come up with those drivers. I will stick to my old Win98 which has drivers for almost everything,  can be ghosted 
very easily to make clones and have the same OS in several disks as back ups working perfectly, every new OS is just new hassle and 
spending, let us fight that by resisting their money making moves to make us poorer and with less and less flexibility."
,RinTosaka,2012-06-23T07:05Z,"Everything seems to be working smoothly and perfectly, and the low RAM usage is great...  

However, there's one thing missing from this release - the ""Default Programs"" settings menu is completely gone!  This is a huge problem for those (like me) who like to use the PortableApps versions of browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc) because the in-browser ""set as default"" option just associates the NON-portable version.

Besides, it does makes it harder in general to manually tweak the file extension defaults...even the popular 'Performance Edition' of XP SP3 by 'tj007s13' (which I'm upgrading from) had kept this feature."
,nileshtambe,2012-06-23T10:38Z,"i am using firefox as my default,
though its not from portable application
i have made folder (copy n paste application) in non windows drive say drive E 
create new folder named ""firefox 13""
install firefox 13 in that folder make quick launch link of firefox.exe , when 1st time firefox start it automatically ask for making it default

i can use same firefox from diffrent installed os
u can do it for this for lots of windows programs like cc cleaner,easy bcd,Foxit Reader,ApexDC,Everything,ExplorerXP,Handbrake,Hard Disk Sentinel,Internet Download Manager,MiniTool Partition Wizard ,vlc,winamp,WinRAR,Your Uninstaller Pro 


regarding file extension if i want to open .mkv file i right click on mkv file and select open with , and point to vlc.exe in vlc folder in copy n paste folder and make it default 

so all this application i never installs when i install new os 
hope it helps u ppl  
thanks for posting comments  do continue.........

,RinTosaka,2012-06-23T21:03Z,"Wow, thanks for the quick response nil!  The file extension thing isn't a big deal really, so don't worry about that.  However regarding default browsers, what you describe doesn't actually work in this case, and let me explain...

I'm using Firefox from PortableApps.com (along with some other programs, but anyway).  Programs on that site have two EXE files, the portable wrapper and the main program (located in the ""App"" folder).  The problem is that, if you set a program like Firefox Portable to be the default, you're associating the main program EXE, not the portable wrapper EXE.  This in effect gives you standard, non-portable Firefox.

The easiest way to test this is to launch FirefoxPortable.exe and install a theme that's very obviously different from the default and apply it.  From there, go into the program's ""Options"" and set Firefox as the default browser, and then completely close Firefox Portable.  Then open a web link from another program that brings up your default browser, and you'll see from the lack of your added-on theme that you aren't in Firefox Portable.

So in the end, the only way to make something like Portable Firefox (or Chrome, Opera, etc) the default browser is to use a utility like this one:
http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/register-firefox-portable-with-default-programs-in-vista/

...which requires access to the ""Default Programs"" settings, otherwise you can't actually set it to be the new default.


If you're wondering, the reason I use Firefox Portable is so that I don't have to re-configure my Firefox (which is heavily customized) whenever I re-install my OS.  I've tried to use Sync, but even then several extensions need to be re-configured."
,revna,2012-06-24T20:06Z,"Wow!
very nice one! Actually I was searching for one like this.
Many many thanks.
some doubts
1. Why there is no internet explorer? How to add IE7/8/9 in it after installation? Bcos some government sites are made for IE(#$%@), so it needs.
2. WMPlayer. No problem for this. so many options are there."
,revna,2012-06-24T20:11Z,thanks
,perrul,2012-06-25T18:23Z,"Hi nileshtambe, does your version includes spanish language features (keyboard, etc)? Thanks"
,nileshtambe,2012-06-25T19:41Z,no i don't think so i kept only us eng
,nileshtambe,2012-06-25T20:49Z,"@perrul
keyboard layout might be there if u download install os ple let me know that
if u can use that? 
do reply "
,RinTosaka,2012-06-26T07:37Z,"Good news nil, turns out that the current newer versions of Firefox can have the profile data copy and pasted from Firefox Portable to the profile folder for normal Firefox.  When I tried this several years ago, things didn't go very well at all, but now it's fully compatible and worked seamlessly.

So I actually don't need the ""Default Programs"" after all."
,nileshtambe,2012-06-26T09:20Z,"after heavily customizing and using firefox for 2-3 days copy below 2 folder to ur data drive

C:UsersAppDataLocalMozilla
C:UsersAppDataRoamingMozilla
when ever u use new os copy that 2 folder from data drive backup to windows drive 

ur firefox will have everything
ps hope i am not confusing u......."
,nileshtambe,2012-06-26T18:04Z,"its bootable iso.
u can burn iso to usb or sd card pendrive
use ultra iso or similar software
do not waste cd dvd's 

To convert ISO to USB-

1 Insert USB stick
2 Open UltraISO, then ""File"", then ""Open"", and navigate to ISO
3 Click ""Bootable"" tab, then ""Write Disk Image""
4 Select USB stick with dropdown arrow
5 Click ""Write""
6 Done!"
,RinTosaka,2012-06-27T02:17Z,"nil, regarding Firefox, I already figured that out in my last comment.  Thanks though, I guess...

Now how about responding to my comment on your ""Win 7 live 64 bit"" torrent? :P"
,leandrini,2012-06-27T16:29Z,"Dude!!!! you the one.. i've been looking for something like this for ages... and functional as it is.... oh i even tried to make my own lite version... turns out it didnt work.. :/

But this is awesome!! No Ie, no Wmp *-----*
its like i'm dreamin'... niceee"
,RinTosaka,2012-07-05T07:22Z,"nil, I've just run into a pretty big problem.  It turns out that the anti-virus I use, Panda Cloud, requires IE in order to install the program.  This in itself isn't an issue, but it turns out that I can't successfully install either IE8 or IE9."
,nileshtambe,2012-07-05T12:33Z,"i know u cant install IE if y remove while making lite os, i have to slipstream IE 9 at time of making os , i hate ie but still i will find solution for u by mounting wim and integrating IE9. "
,sunymnlobo,2012-08-01T09:02Z,"@cismanm
