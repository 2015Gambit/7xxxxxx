x264 is superior, when it works with your devices.  Sadly, XviD still has wider hardware support, so I uploaded my collection too.  All named and sorted.

For XviD format:

There is only one season so far.  It is 26 episodes long.  All 26 episodes are in this release."
,ProphetZarquon,2012-06-25T22:02Z,"Thundercats went on hiatus from November 25th until March 24th 2012, when ""Season 1 Episode 14 - New Alliances"" aired.  This caused a lot of confusion and many people thought Season 1 was over when in fact barely more than Book 1 had aired yet.

The full Season 1, Books 1, 2 & 3 has now aired as of June 16th 2012.

THIS TORRENT CONTAINS ALL 26 EPISODES SO FAR, as of June 25th 2012.

Book 1 and Book 2 DVDs are now available. Each contains 8 episodes from Season 1 of the series.

The series is currently on hiatus again, but Cartoon Network denies any rumors of cancellation, saying only that the show will be back for a second season.

The original show had 65 episodes each in two seasons, so there should be plenty more fodder for the writers to whack around with. Frankly I wouldn't be suprised if they call the next episode Season 1 Episode 27...  But we won't see that before the end of July, if then.

Once again, this has all 26 episodes and THERE IS NO SEASON TWO YET.  Pick this up if you haven't seen them all, or grab my version posted above.  Both work flawlessly and look great.  (This version by Hegemoney uses x264 MP4 files.)"
,Hegemoney,2012-06-25T22:37Z,"ProphetZarquon went into more detail about it than I did but he is correct.  Lately it seems as if more and more networks are airing their shows in non standard formats like this.

My wife loves Secret Life of an American Teenager and Pretty Little Liars and other shows as such.  They are spreading these seasons out more showing only 10 to 12 episodes, then taking a two to three month break just to come back with the rest of the season.  Then they take another two or three month break and start a new season right away.

Shows like Royal Pains (which I love) do this also.  SyFy does this with most of their hit shows as well (mainly with their heavy hitters like the Stargate franchise).

Doing it like this is more cost beneficial for small networks like CN, USA, SyFy and such.  They don't have the massive amount of programming to compete all season long and all summer long with the powerhouses such as ABC, CBS, and NBC.  So they break their seasons up more evenly for their shows than the other networks."
,Nirmal3G,2012-07-02T03:27Z,"Sorrry about that, its not ThunderCats its Avengers Season 2!!"
,ProphetZarquon,2012-08-18T07:28Z,"@Nirmal3G

LOL, just LOL.

All that typing, for the wrong series."
,MoMoCHu5,2012-09-08T21:47Z,Apparently the series was cancelled... nothing further... only that it had not appeared on the list of shows returning to CN in 2013...
