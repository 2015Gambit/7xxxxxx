,mentallyours,2012-06-20T09:28Z,"The Miami Heat rallied from a 17-point first-half deficit to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder 104-98 Tuesday in Game 4 of the NBA Finals at AmericanAirlines Arena.

The Heat lead the series 3-1, and have a chance to close out the series in Game 5 Thursday.

LeBron James led Miami with 26 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds, but it was the play of Mario Chalmers that may have been most key. He finished with a postseason-high 25 points on 9 of 15 shooting. With James on the bench suffering from apparent leg cramps late in the game, Chalmers hit a driving layup that put the Heat ahead by five with under a minute remaining.

His play was what Miami needed to offset a remarkable performance by Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook. He scored a game-high 43 points and almost single-handedly led the Thunder to tying the series.

@metallyours Congrats on being a low-life jerk."
