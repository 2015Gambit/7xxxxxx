DUSTER: In the closing days of World War II, a widowed housewife turned cropduster pilot struggles to rescue her teenage daughter from a band of Nazi war criminals who crash near her small Texas farm.

"DUSTER is a gripping, compelling story. I love the characters. I love the set-up. The art gives it all a gritty, authentic look. And I'm completely, nail-bittingly, breath-holdingly on the edge of my seat -- I only got to read through the end of Chapter 4, and I can't freakin' wait to see how it all works out. Action, suspense, humanity, drama, blood, love and heroics. Micah Ian Wright's coming back to comics, and he and his partners are throwing one hell of a party. Don't miss out on this terrific book." - Kurt Busiek (Astro City)
