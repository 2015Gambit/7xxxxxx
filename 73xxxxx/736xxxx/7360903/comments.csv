Wanna blow up your speakers? Try this real loud. :D
If this doesn't impress you you should upgrade your system.

""1812"" and ""Wellington's Victory"" maybe a bit bombastic for some ears (and careful you don't blow a speaker), but ""Capriccio Italien"" is a delight in this wonderful performance. "
