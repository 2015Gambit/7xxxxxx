Here are a few screenshots of the rar files. I know there is no trust here but this really is unaltered.

,capth4u,2012-07-22T08:34Z,Having an issues with the keygen ... First ISO 5  took like 6-8 key tries before it took... ISO 6 isnt taking yet after 15 tries. I might try the other ISO's and message back.
,capth4u,2012-07-22T08:46Z,ISO 6 finally took a serial from the keygen... About 24 tries :/ But its working!

FIRST Install the main (CRACKED) Juicer App from Collection 10 ISO  and then installed all font collections from that app with the mounted images. Everything works perfectly. Tested Win 7 x64."
