Each of the font families in DJ Fonts Collection 10 has a host of stunning ready-to-use font variations created by the artists of Digital Juice. Even the new one-layer photographic fonts have at least 25 variations available through the use of layer duplication, texture and gradient fills. Use these and all font variations

Instalation:
I installed the main Juicer App from Collection 10 ISO and then installed all font collections from that app with the mounted images. Everything works perfectly. Tested Win 7 x64.

It will take some time to upload. Be patient as I will see it through :)
