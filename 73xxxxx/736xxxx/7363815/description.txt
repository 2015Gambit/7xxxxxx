I Grow Chronic

Hosted by the mysterious Mr. Green, this in-depth documentary takes a candid look at the raising and harvesting of the hemp plant in North America. Step by step, Mr. Green takes the viewer through the process of planning and building an indoor hemp atrium.
Step-by-Step construction of a basic indoor grow-room that yields a 1/4 pound of Chronic Sinsemillas Marijuana every two months. Mr. Green takes out the mystery and confusion surrounding the construction and maintenance of an indoor marijuana grow room by breaking it down into basic easy-to-follow steps.
Well shot, well edited, and paced quickly enough that you donΓÇÖt get bored, but slowly enough that important topics are covered in depth. Where else are you going to find an instructional documentary that takes you inside growrooms? For a younger generation, (accustomed to learning visually) this DVD is an invaluable resource. Of course, if youΓÇÖre a serious student, read the book, but the DVDs are a great place for the novice to start.
