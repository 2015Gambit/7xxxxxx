The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events. The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

On this Sunday, June 17 Father's Day Special edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with Ron Paul's congressional chief of staff, Lew Rockwell, about Rand Paul's endorsement of Mitt Romney. He also talks with the former Governor of Minnesota and host of the TruTV show Conspiracy Theory, Jesse Ventura, about his new book and the move toward war waged against Syria. Alex talks about the nuclear reactor beneath the LBJ Library on the University of Texas campus and nuclear waste that is said to be dumped and sealed in limestone caves located in what was once the outskirts of Austin, according to an inside source. Finally, Alex features his video covering the Global Future 2045 International Congress and the transhumanist singularity agenda. 

Today's broadcast consists of previously aired material.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
