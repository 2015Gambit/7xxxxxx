Plot - 
Rushi is a 25 year old boy born in a Brahman family but a metropolitan and cosmopolitan city life in the 21st century kept him away from religion. His father somehow, was also a reason for it because he hates his father and he sees to it that he doesnΓÇÖt do what his father does and make him happy.Sometimes RushiΓÇÖs behavior towards his father seems very odd and abnormal. Rushi has a lot of friends and a girlfriend. They are typical youngsters in their behavior but sometimes they donΓÇÖt like RushiΓÇÖs attitude towards his father. One day, RushiΓÇÖs friend takes him to a lady who happens to be a past life regression expert and the story takes a turn from there. After a few sessions, Rushi realizes that he was a Koli boy from the Konkan belt of Maharashtra and that he was in love with a Brahman girl. One day in jealousy, his best friend killed him. Rushi now has a
tough time facing this fact but the story proceeds with his acceptance, forgiveness and he looks forward to meet the love from his past life.
