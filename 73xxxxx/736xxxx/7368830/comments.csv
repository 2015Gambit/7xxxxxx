,UMe2,2012-06-20T09:15Z,I forgot to mention that the torrent contains 1090 files and is 285 GB big.
,UMe2,2012-06-20T09:18Z,"... you may also google for 36fa8f7bde1d80b7141b57a76ec147c13a54835f

and you'll find it on other sites :-)"
,climax708,2012-06-26T13:52Z,"Woah!
Thank you for uploading this, I've been searching for such torrent for ages!
Going to download now and do QA."
,climax708,2012-06-26T13:53Z,"PS: Do you think you can split the one torrent to many? Say, make a seperate torrent for each season, or have many torrents with two seasons in each?
It'd be alot more convenient that way, I believe.
Don't forget to upload those torrents to TBP if you decide to do that xD"
,UMe2,2012-06-27T03:43Z,"Well, I thought about it (to work around the time-out problem on TPB), but I prefer complete all-in-one torrents, even if they end up as big as this one. I think it's a hassle to add at least 26 torrents, all with different availabilities (maybe even one or two incomplete) and download speeds, have them completed out of order and have to check manually if you haven't missed a season... With this one, you just add it, forget it for a couple weeks, and have everything.

Since I assume everyone knows how to prioritize files and how to exclude files from being downloaded I personally think it's easier this way. Sorry ;)"
,climax708,2012-06-27T10:44Z,"That's a good assumption which I too assume. However, I'm not very good with BitTorrent.
How about you link to a tutorial on how to prioritize files & exclude files for different torrent clients?

Here's a technical issue: When I download a torrent, the client pops up a window in which I select which files to download and which not; however it doesn't output any files and so all files are set for download & I can't prevent any from downloading.

Also, I'd say multiple torrents are a better idea because it's alot easier to prioritize torrents (not files) and prevent torrents from downloading for awhile (not files).

Also, do remember that some pirates might use outdated or custom clients which don't have those feutures (atleast yet)"
,MoBigfoot,2012-07-05T04:20Z,I don't know about others but trying to download a single torrent of that size would run me smack up against my ISP's data download caps in a hurry.  Breaking it into smaller chunks such as a few years at at time would make it far more digestible.
,mythicmom,2012-07-14T23:41Z,Any idea how to speed this down load up? I'm at 56% and it still says  20 weeks and I have high speed internet
,climax708,2012-07-17T18:23Z,"Okay, so here's the deal:
I'm two seasons into downloading this, and I've got to point out the quality is excellent.
I'd like to point out that I will re-upload this torrent as a re-branded version & in parts, each season seperated. Notice: I'm not the author of THIS torrent."
,UMe2,2012-07-18T10:36Z,"Climax:
If you really feel the need to do that I have no way of stopping you. But once and for all: Every torrent client I know allows you to choose the files/seasons to download and which ones to exclude. And you can even prioritize files. So there is no benefit in splitting it as I stated before.

However: Do myself and the rest of this internet the favor and point out, that your torrent include the exact same files as this one. When I was compiling my collection I've spend hours in trying to figure out which torrents have unique material and which ones are just re-branded, re-named, re-uploaded, re-whatevered.

Now I'm looking for more comments about the content, not the size. Thanks."
,bdowell67,2012-08-07T05:15Z,how is the quality?
,faerydk,2012-08-23T20:50Z,"When I try to download the included torrent, I get a message that it's corrupted :c this appears to be the only Classic Who on TPB, so that's really disappointing."
,danniekay23,2012-08-25T01:59Z,Maybe try splitting it up by Doctor. that way there is only 7 of them but they are still a large pack
,UMe2,2012-08-25T18:20Z,"@

I just downloaded the torrent myself and it worked perfectly fine with utorrent.

Try it again. If that still doesn't work, google for 36fa8f7bde1d80b7141b57a76ec147c13a54835f and get it from an other site."
,soulshaker,2012-09-21T18:10Z,"so far not a problem, speed isnt the best but its getting there, im happy with the size and content, thanks a lot and makes my life easy to get the classic seasons."
