I'm sorry, that I have to share this torrent this way by setting up a torrent containing the torrent.

When I try to upload this included .torrent file directly to The Pirate Bay I get an error message telling me that the site connection was reset and the torrent doesn't show up on the site. I tried hundreds of times at various times of the day with no luck. This torrent might be too big for this site.

Thanks,
