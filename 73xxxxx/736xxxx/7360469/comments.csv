An American visiting Japan takes a prostitute. He don't know any words in japaneese, but what the heck - just do the business. Only peculiar thing is that she screams the same words over and over again...

Next day he golfs with a friend and by surprise the caddy-boys shouts the same words as the prostitute...

Courious he asks about the meaning, and gets the answer ""wrong hole"".

(some afterthoughts about todays increasingly sexual perversity is that some would prefer that)."
