Few knew him abroad, Dirch Passer. But he's a legend in Denmark. He died at 54.

We follow his stage life and maybe it's difficult for a foreigner to understand his fame, because the texts he performed weren't really funny, but rather vulgar. But Passer was loved, not understanding why.

The main scene, which is also very touching, is when he performs "Mice and Men" and the audience laughs. Passer starts to cry for real, which makes the audience laugh even more. That's the curse of the comedian.

He worked and also drank himself to death. But it's more a film about the conditions of Passer, not the conditions of those who are expected and believed to be funny.
