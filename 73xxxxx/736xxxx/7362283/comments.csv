,Rob2042,2012-06-18T09:20Z,"So, I went to the trouble to download the nfo file only to find out if this had subtitles.  Of course, it didn`t say.  Why TvTeam can`t list info like other uploaders is beyond me.  They should remove TvTeam`s green skull."
,lvautour,2012-06-18T14:25Z,"@ Rob2042, TvTeam`s one of the best uploaders ,maybe you should download and find out yourself! instead of whining like a bitch !"
,dean2804,2012-06-18T19:08Z,@lvautour It really wouldn't hurt TvTeam to put a little info on their uploads. They never do and sometimes I haven't got a clue which movie it's supposed to be (multiple titles on IMDb). Why would someone download 1.19 gigs just to see if it has subs. Get real.
,FBInot,2012-06-19T21:18Z,same goes with Bone. WHere you ZONE ??? The only true uploader on here these days. The rest of these dck wods should get off here
,spankdaddy,2012-06-20T00:57Z,"Yeah i agree, there should be atleast some info like language and such on here. It totally sucks downloading it because you cant be told just to find out , whats the point in that. "
