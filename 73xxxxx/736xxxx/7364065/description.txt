"...What we have with Test Dream is an album that actually manages to widen its audience by splitting itself down the middle several times over. Not a drum & bass album, not a dubstep album, not an "IDM" album and not an "ambient" album, Test Dream nevertheless has something for an acolyte of any one of those styles to enjoy, and is attractive enough to foster crossover as well. Sometimes you'll flinch, sometimes you'll swoon, sometimes you'll just be perplexed. Whatever happens, you won't be bored..."
