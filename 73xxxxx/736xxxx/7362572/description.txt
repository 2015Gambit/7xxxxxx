Esquire Magazine UK July 2012

Esquire UK magazine is the discerning man's lifestyle magazine. Addressing 
the entertainment requirements and values of the modern man with wit and 
sophistication, Esquire is a magazine with cut and thrust, and none of the 
tackiness and banality of many women's lifestyle magazines. Very chunky and 
printed on high quality paper, Esquire magazine is a complete stylish 
package for every man with brains, taste, and a good sense of irony.
