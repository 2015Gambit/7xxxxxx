All 43 videos and project files included

In this Tutorial we will be making a Main Room House Monsta.

In the first part we look at the most essential element the chord progression. We deconstruct a few tunes and spit the process up in to easy to follow parts. If your having difficulty building the killer chord progression this should defo help.

From there on we delve even deeper into things by looking at our bassline / vocals / arranging / fx / breakdowns / mixing and final mastering until we have a complete track
