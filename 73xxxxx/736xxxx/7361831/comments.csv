,LuxLOL,2012-06-24T18:08Z,"Thanks!

A little info in the ISO file in the zip file is named 2011.6.17 that's a typo, everyone can rename it to 2012 that's no problem."
,rbl82,2012-06-26T22:38Z,"hi... first of all, many thanks for this...
but I've got a problem... autoplay is not working... do you know any solution for this?..."
,LuxLOL,2012-06-27T00:48Z,"This is disabled by default because it this is enabled someone can install malware and unlock your Screensaver password on your computer.

If you still want to enable this then go to:
START -> Control Panel -> Group Policy -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Turn off Autoplay"

,Wagon220,2012-07-06T23:34Z,"For those of you thinking this torrent is virus free and clean, I suggest you run this copy of XP in a virtual machine under Linux and pay special attention to your network activity in the network activity viewer http://netactview.sourceforge.net 
This copy of XP is infected with the TINT Trojan and it opens hundreds of UDP Sockets the firewall and antivirus registry settings have been tampered with and then you find you have people connecting from some pretty iffy sites. DIRTY copy of XP - shame on you LuxLOL"
,LuxLOL,2012-07-07T02:16Z,"Funny that only you can't open the Task Manager and since when has Windows XP, an AntiVirus built-in?
If your Backup files or crack and Keygens are infected then don't blame it on this Windows XP.
I have the strange feeling that you are a Troll."
,Wagon220,2012-07-07T05:20Z,Well thats one troll who wont be using your cracked copy of XP. I see what its doing on the network when its running and I also see the copy of WIN32.TINT.AWN running with Chinese Characters that is trying to hide. FUNNY how a copy of XP with the FIREWALL enabled does nothing to the amount of inbound connections on TCP from EVERYWHERE!
,Wagon220,2012-07-07T05:24Z,"Linux sigint 3.2.0-0.bpo.2-amd64 #1 SMP Fri Jun 29 20:42:29 UTC 2012 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I don't use XP dipshit!"
,Wagon220,2012-07-07T05:41Z,"You suck Chinese Lamer, your XP no good! Me thinks your are Script Kiddie.. Go back to making Noodle!"
,LuxLOL,2012-07-07T11:07Z,"I'm not Chinese im Luxembourgish.
And in the TPB forum you write that the Task Manager is not opening strange that no one else has this problem.

Accusing people of somthing without proof is Trolling and you was also lying about the Task Manager not opening so go back in your cave troll. "
,Wagon220,2012-07-07T12:56Z,"I already have the proof, thats why I am not using this copy of XP. As to not being able to run task manager, I admit that was my bad I was typing taskman instead of taskmgr.exe in start --> run but if you want proof, hold on I'll go and take some screen-shots. But even then a little arsehole like yourself would probably accuse me of using photoshop, so I'll let other people try your XP and watch how it behaves in VirtuaBox something you advocate doing on your own website at zone54"

I did posted a malware scan and a mod has also checked this torrent and no one esle complains about mailware.
You already accused me that i disable the Task Manager check your facts first befour accusing people."

,just1acc,2012-07-09T11:31Z,"Die Troller. I've been using Black Xp from early 2010. I can vouch for LuxLol. Its the best modified Xp I've ever used. 

I'm on my LMDE machine with xp at virtualbox. NetActView showing ""TINT TRojan"", the joke of the millennium. Did yo dickhead200 ever used NetActView?"
,just1acc,2012-07-09T11:35Z,"LuxLol : My two laptops don't support xp (untouched). Show fatal error at installation. But Black Xp installed smoothly.

Why is that. And can you tell me which modification make Black Xp to get installed in non supported hardware?"
,LuxLOL,2012-07-09T11:56Z,You Laptop doesn't need to support untouched the error could be a misconfiguration or a SATA driver problem or something else but it's hard to say what exactly the problem is without more information.
,Subhodip,2012-07-09T17:53Z,Please add Realtek HD Audio Driver
,Subhodip,2012-07-09T17:57Z,If we can select which extra programs to install then it would be the best xp installation!!!
,LuxLOL,2012-07-09T19:22Z,"@Subhodip
Realtek is not the only Audio driver out there.
And if you go into the folder ""..OEMRunOnceExtra Programs"" there you can click on waht you like to install."
,samsurfer,2012-07-09T21:54Z,"I was wondering is there a way to transfer to a USB to install from the USB? I've tried BartPE, Win2Flash, and still no joy. I get an NTDLR error after every boot. What gives?"
,LuxLOL,2012-07-09T23:19Z,Got to the WinToFlash forum there you find all the infos you need.
,LuxLOL,2012-07-12T20:38Z,"New version is out:
