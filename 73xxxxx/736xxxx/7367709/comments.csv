x264 provides superior image and resolution at same file size.
XviD sadly still has much wider device support and is probably what I'd choose if I wanted to share this series with others.

For XviD format:

,Hegemoney,2012-06-22T05:58Z,"You can play Windows Media Video (WMV) and MPEG-4 (MP4) files from a data DVD, data CD, or portable device.

Unfortunately I don't have an xbox so I can't test this.  I know my releases will play on my PS3 and as well as every other .avi and .mp4 I've downloaded."
,ProphetZarquon,2012-06-23T05:11Z,"As I said, a mix of XviD and x264.

I only posted my collection because I searched for an all XviD collection and there wasn't one with any Seeds.

I also named each file with the Episode Titles.

x264 is taking over anyway. I picked up each episode as they landed and selected for XviD because that's what I started with and I like consistency.

Frankly, you are great.  Rather than posting surly reprisals on my torrent page, I was hoping you would just upload a fixed torrent (which would easily surpass mine anyway due to your rep alone).

Just for consistency, I've also linked this torrent page on my torrent page, so people can choose which collection they want without hunting around."
