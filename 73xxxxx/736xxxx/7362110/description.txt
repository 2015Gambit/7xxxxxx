                            The Complete Season 2


The Borgias is a 2011 historical fiction television series created by Neil Jordan.

The series follows the rise of the Borgia family to the pinnacle of the church and their struggles to maintain their grip on power. The beginning of the first season depicts the election of Rodrigo Borgia to the papacy through simony and bribery with the help of his son, Cesare. The triumph of Borgia, who became Pope Alexander VI, in the papal conclave enrages his rivals in the College of Cardinals, some of whom decided to plot against him. With the help of his family, Alexander takes on his enemies while striking alliances with other European powers to strengthen his position.
