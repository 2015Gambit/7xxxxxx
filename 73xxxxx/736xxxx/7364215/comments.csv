,andbir,2012-09-15T14:41Z,"Martin is a troubled man with a dark secret: He kills people and drinks their blood.

Martin has been sent away to live with an elderly relative in a small town in Pennsylvania. The relative is determined to try to destroy his body and save his soul in order to break the family curse. But is Martin truly a supernatural being, an 84-year-old vampire, or just a shy blood-drinking serial killer? Does magic really exist?

With Martin, George A Romero succeeded in creating a film that is equal parts psychological drama and horror film. The main characters of the film are all complex and multifaceted, as opposed to the shallow portraits which we are all to often forced to endure in horror movies in general and perhaps in vampire films in particular. The film's ambigious attitiude towards what is natural and supernatural further reinforces the impression. Undoubtedly one of film history's most interesting vampire films. (rewview by Maximillian Lestander). IMDB 7.0"
