Synopsis
Sometimes the past is too shameful to live with and, for mysterious writer Sirin (Nica Noelle), the only option is to start a new life. Posing as a stranger in a new town, Sirin rents a room from sex-hungry single mom Randi James, only to discover that rather than escape the past, she has only doomed herself to repeat it. Trinity Post stars as young nymph Lola who sets her sights on the repressed, troubled Sirin. Ariel X and Aubrey Adams provide a sexual outlet for Sirin - and for each other - while Annabelle Lee shows Lola why no older woman can compete with a young, hot girl.
