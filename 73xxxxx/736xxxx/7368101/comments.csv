Wow...I loved Dave Anabelle in Brothers and Sisters...but he could not act for shit in this.  This was a bad movie.  Not a good career move for him."

Light and clever-silly comedy. It's been long time since a comedy that good was made. Rob Schneider is hillarious. 

M=10, no kidding

ROFL, ""IMDB ratings are worthless"" but your's is priceless?

82 reviewers called it shit, the users on here called it shit but you loved it. Lose your common sense and instead listen to James and his ONE positive review."
