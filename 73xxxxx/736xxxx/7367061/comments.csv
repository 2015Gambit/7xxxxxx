I've only downloaded about 10 'packs' that you've shared with us, and I get the feeling that i've missed a lot more since i've joined the party late.

I would really love to watch some of the earlier eps as much as possible. Thanks!"
[V],mdprosser,2012-06-21T06:44Z,I'll upload more classics within the week....
,gamma84,2012-06-22T02:41Z,"That would be great and most appreciated, mdprosser.

 However, if you don't mind me asking, it is intriguing for me to know if there is a site where I can download a lot more of the early last decade seasons? (you can email me invy84 at gmail if you'd feel more comfortable this way)

Since I understand you probably wouldn't want to re-seed them again, as it is a lot to seed. Although I would seed them for months on end."
