Freddie ventures deep into the wilderness of Canada's west coast, searching for wolves and killer whales. Keeping him safe are his First Nations guides Vernon and Michael Price, members of the seafaring We Wai Kai Nation. On a traditional winter hunting trip, Freddie camps out under the stars, hunts for deer and forages along the shoreline for clams and oysters. Exploring the dense forest behind their camp, Freddie discovers recent pugmarks from wolves and territorial marking from bears. Finally, Freddie and Vernon take to the water. After days of searching, they eventually track down a pod of killer whales, and Freddie gets closer than he ever thought possible.
