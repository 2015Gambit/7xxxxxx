Ladyboys
Following last year's successful documentary exploring the world of Thailand's ladyboys, this new thought-provoking series offers further insight into a sector of Thai society that makes up one per cent of the country's population. This revealing documentary explores the world of transsexuals in Thailand, and follows two Americans who travel to Bangkok for sex change surgery, and a British ex-pat looking for love.



3)  The Men who Love Ladyboys 
In this programme we also look at the relationships between Thai ladyboys and Western men. This is not just a sex-tourism thing, as often portrayed by the media. It is not unusual for them to develop long-lasting and tender bonds.
