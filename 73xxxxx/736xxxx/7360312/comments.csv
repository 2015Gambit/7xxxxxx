[T],trialNerror,2012-06-17T20:31Z,"i'll stop bugging you when you learn to encode properly... and name the files without so much crap in it.

i'll say it over and over again until you get it right. you're a fucking idiot for messing with the frames per second.  videos are released with a certain fps for a reason and are not meant to be changed else you are screwing up the duration of the video.  not by just a couple seconds. almost half a minute.

you're a dumb lazy bitch for only doing 1-pass constant bitrate xvid.  1 pass is okay if you do constant quality not constant bitrate. 

i'll stfu when your idiotic self converts properly... and loose the fucking brackets in the file name.  NOBODY uses them. you are the only one. it's ridiculous. i'm sure 99% of the foolish followers of yours that have no idea what kind of quality picture they're missing out on by not getting another version of the show end up removing all that ugly shit at the end of the file name anyway.

if must keep all that garbage - put the episode name after the episode number as any logical being would do and if you must have a date use the real air date and not when your dumbfuck ass got it in your country.  it does not matter if your monkey paws got this on the 17th. the show aired on the 16th. EVERYTHING you have listed is a day off.  so. fucking. retarded.

stupid people annoy me.  nobody has annoyed me as much as you do. you are one seriously moronic fellow.  i would tell you to blow your brains out but i'm sure the only thing that would fly out of your thick skull is confetti. "
[V],psspss,2012-06-18T13:04Z,"TNE you need to see the doctor for some better drugs man

I dont think anyone here or I for that give a fook what you say or think..

dont provide to the p2p community why you even here..

oh thats right to be annoyance and chew up
TPB database with mindless comments allt he time

you may notice no one is even responding to your posts.. best to just ignore you now"
[V],psspss,2012-06-19T02:29Z,"nothing wrong with long names.. more info the better..

when you see all my files in a bundle your see it so much easier to read
if not then change the view on your darn win 7 or xp folders
and make the fields longer..

how lame calling a file

S01E01.corrupted.xvid.avi

when mine is better S01E01.xvid-[ Corrupted ][ date ].avi

as how do you know if thats a tilte and no a bad file?

another exmaple s01e01.1.1.2.xvid.avi

when mine was s01e01,xvid-[ 1+1=2 ][ date ].avi

another example

season roll backs.. espc for storage hunters..

S02E01 when it should be S03E01

now you dont know S02E01 is the new upload or not now
cos theres no darn date in t he AVI name

no one is forcing you to download my rips"
