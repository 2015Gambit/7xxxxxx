Sharks Never Sleep is all about soothing blends of punk rock with mellow hints of pop.

Sharks Never Sleep are a few dudes who've had too many drinks, lonely nights, depressing walks home and self-motivating rants that end in failure, which, have amalgamated into the only form it can: pop-punk. Sharks Never Sleep promise to drink heavily, cause explosions, and make you hate your life on a stage, soon to be near you.
