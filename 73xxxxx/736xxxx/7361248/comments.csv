,pyaray6669,2012-06-29T22:17Z,Keygen doesn't work for win7 install.
,vk4502p,2012-06-29T23:33Z,"Xilisoft added a hidden registry key, which wont allow you to add any more keys after the first key gets blocked. So here is a workaround:

1-Start
2-Run
3-Type in Regedit
4-Select HKEY_USERS
5-Press Ctrl + f (Search)
6-Search for {C06F4056-C35F-4bf8-A93A-9F098F3E503D}
7-Delete the Key, including the subkeys
