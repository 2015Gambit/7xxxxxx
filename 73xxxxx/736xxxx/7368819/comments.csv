Saw my 3rd and final Grateful Dead concert on 6/19/1994 in Eugene, Oregon - 18 years ago today. Had an extra ticket and traded it in the parking lot for a handful of bootleg recordings on cassette, among which was the 2nd set of 11/6/79.

Was absolutely blown away by this recording - it was from an FM source, at that time my best quality bootleg, and the Terrapin Station remains my favorite version. The Playing is high tempo, and also a favorite of the post-Keith era. The jam out of Playing is stellar; in short just a great 45-minute stretch of playing. Was very thrilled to get that portion of the set on the first volume of Road Trips.

This show is a major reason why the early years with Brent (79-82) stay in heavy rotation in my bootleg collection.

Seed & enjoy!!!"

Wanted to add that these 2 shows were the final two installments of the Download Series. On to Road Trips; I have the entire Dick's Picks collection at my dad's house, need to travel down to grab those. Would eventually like to get those uploaded in FLAC."
