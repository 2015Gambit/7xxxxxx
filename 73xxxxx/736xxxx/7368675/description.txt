 Dr. Baldev Chaddha , a well qualified         
 fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic     
 and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi,    
 that guarantees a high quality and            
 specialized sperm for the purpose.            
 Unfortunately he has more failed cases to     
 his credit than successes. A healthy, high    
 performing donor is the need of the hour.     
 Vicky Arora , a young, good-looking, Punjabi  
 boy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and    
 of no financial support to Dolly, a widow,    
 who runs a small beauty parlor from home.     
 As luck would have it, a small brawl in       
 the colony brings Dr Chaddha and Vicky,       
 face to face, where Chaddha, concludes that   
 Vicky could be THAT donor he has been looking 
 for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights  
 are spent in convincing Vicky to become a     
 donor till he finally gives in. Vicky finds   
 his love interest in Ashima Roy , a pretty
