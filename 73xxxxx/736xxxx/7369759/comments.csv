,Megatox20,2012-06-20T15:49Z,Is this working?
[T],azaq318,2012-06-20T16:37Z,"Yep, I tested it myself. 
1. Mount mini image in Alcohol (or Daemon Tools SCSI Drive)
2. Run ACID (inside Alcohol folder), press Cloak
3. Play the game"
,Megatox20,2012-06-20T17:05Z,can i mount it with power iso?
,GodofPoop,2012-06-20T18:27Z,Does this game run without mounting and cloaking?
,CrankyAVM,2012-06-20T21:59Z,"Anyone else got this installed and running yet? Not sure what ""Alcohol"" is or whether I need it if I have Daemon tools. What's this whole cloaking business about?"
,XxMATIxX,2012-06-20T23:46Z,how do i play the game how do i use the crack help
,1gam3r,2012-06-21T02:45Z,"After you install the game and the Alchohol 52% program, you mount it and then cloak it using the ACID program (found in the folder where you installed Alchohol 52%). After that, run the game from the DESKTOP! You should have the lego batman 2 icon on the desktop after you installed it. It will work then!! "
,4454,2012-06-21T15:49Z,"Please help!?
When I've cloaked in a.c.i.d and want to exit the program it says: Terminating A.C.I.D will also disable its device cloaking features.

So what to do? I can't install the game either in the installer?? "
