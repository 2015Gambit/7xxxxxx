I think your uploads are the best on tpb. Would you be able to upload Madagascar - Escape to Africa, I would really appreciate it as there are not any good ones out there. Thanks."

@bgyygg67 - there are no good ups of Madagascar 3 bcuz it's not yet out on Blu-ray (which is the source of the good quality ups). Once it's out on BD, you should find rips more to your liking. As for whether I'll encode it, that depends on when it comes out."
