,NTA-Pro,2012-06-24T01:01Z,Finally! This is what I'm talking about lol
,rimxv2,2012-07-02T11:27Z,"I made an account here just to say, this torrent is the real deal, great quality!!!!"
,ArmedTiger,2012-07-11T08:44Z,is it spoken in english ? 
,heintz_nick,2012-07-17T08:50Z,"@ArmedTiger 
I really hate when people don't read, it says there is English audio right in the description!"
,MKiser,2012-07-18T07:39Z,I know this is probably obvious but how do you get it to play in the spoken English rather than Japanese?
,MKiser,2012-07-18T07:41Z,"Never mind, ignore the last comment I made."
,Shadow416,2012-07-25T03:57Z,Daman4Iife you provide me with nothing but sexy uploads thanks man.
,Shadow416,2012-07-26T01:50Z,"episode 4 doesn't have english audio, doesn't play, only the jap. Just a heads up---the rest seem fine though"
,St_james,2012-08-03T01:14Z,Sry about this but I was wondering if any one could help me. i can seem to figure out how to make it play in English at all got any ideas. 
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-04T18:25Z,"james, Use VLC then Right Click go to Audio then select the 2nd Track"
,troll1214,2012-08-04T19:03Z,you are awesome!
,bronzmash,2012-08-04T22:10Z,"You're the best!! The seeders, you guys're the best. The VERY best."
,GoIrish23,2012-08-07T20:45Z,Why is the file size so ginormous for only 64 episodes?
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-07T23:20Z,"golrish, you think 19GB is big lol, dude each episode is 300MB and that is small compare to 1080p which is 700-1GB each. 

if you want small size go download 360-480p Episodes."
,GoIrish23,2012-08-07T23:40Z,Oh lol. Well do you know why my download speed is only 150 Kb/s? All other torrents are 1 MB/s+.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-08T03:16Z,well because most high speed seeders come from Demonoid and DEMONOID IS CURRENTLY DOWN
,LuisAlberice,2012-08-08T23:15Z,can i download other subs?
,GohanHD,2012-08-09T17:39Z,Thank you Netflix stopped at episode 39 so i had to find the rest thanks again
,Lost_Leaf,2012-08-22T19:33Z,"Daman, what's your recommended best compression/conversion methodology?

I have the complete 1080P BD Dual-Audio rip of Angel Beats, with each episode coming in at roughly 700 Mb's -- a file size I honestly don't need -- What's the best way to compress these files and get the best compromise of quality and size? As most of your 720P's are around 300 Mb's, which is the ideal file size I would wish to achieve."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-08-22T20:38Z,"Lost leaf Using 10bit will Drop the File size by 50-100MB, Also Lowering the Audio from 5.1 to 2.0 Stereo 128Kbps will also lower the File size considerably."
,CapCapNik,2012-08-24T03:50Z,I have the first season of brotherhood. Is this the first and second? and how many seasons are there? Plz get back to me asap.
,CapCapNik,2012-08-24T03:56Z,"Nvm I figured it out, but please seed! I really need to finish this. I only have up to episode 26 and im dyin here!"
,falcatarius,2012-08-25T18:52Z,"People are throttling their upload rates on this torrent. I've been downloading for almost 3 days now and usually only get 20 kilobytes, with a max of 100. I've uploaded about 28 gigs and downloaded only 10. With my torrent ratio sitting at 2.5, my monthly usage is getting murdered by this download. Fellow leechers and/or seeders please allow for higher upload limits!

That said, the torrent itself is spectacular. The quality is immaculate and a serious kudos to the uploader Daman4Iife. Thanks man!"
,Lost_Leaf,2012-08-30T18:34Z,What program do you use to do 10 bit encoding?
,firefox83,2012-09-02T05:29Z,"Great quality and series. Just wish you didnt upload them in .mkv format, but oh well. Time to go convert them so I cant watch it."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-02T10:56Z,"firefox, MKv is the only Container that supports Dual Audio with Soft coded Subtitles. "
,stigma369,2012-09-06T21:25Z,"@Daman4Iife
just out of curiosity, did you make a 1080p version of this anime?"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-09-06T23:04Z,"nop, i usually only do 1080p for smaller series since or series that are in my top 10 like YU YU hakusho.

a 1080p version of this will be like 40-50GB "
,trappedinct7,2012-09-07T20:58Z,just wanted to report that episode 04 is missing the english audio track. You'll notice the filesize is smaller than all the other episodes.
,kafte,2012-09-14T06:11Z,"Just finished downloading a test episode, and this is the real deal, man! Netflix left me hangin' too, and your torrent just saved my (remaining) sanity. Thank you SO much Daman4Iife! I'd resorted to watching the American FMA (not Brotherhood). No.. just no..."
