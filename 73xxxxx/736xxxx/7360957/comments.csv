,brega10,2012-06-18T06:24Z,How does one download a file when the magnet doesn't seem to work?  I'm connected to 50+ seeders and nothing is downloading.  DHT and Peer Exchange are both enabled and working and I'm using uTorrent.  Any help would be appreciated!
,burt007,2012-06-18T08:23Z,@brega10 which torrent client are you using? if it is utorrent you have to add magnet in to it. and there is instructions on utorrent.com do a little google search and this is not hard at all.

,brega10,2012-06-19T06:19Z,@Burt... I'm using uTorrent 3.1.3... and I have magnets added and usually they work with no problem.  I'm just having a problem with this particular torrent's magnet and I can't seem to figure out why.

It seems a few people are having problems downloading some of my torrents and I don't know why.I just downloaded this from another computer and got it in under a minute.

My client shows that it's seeding and it has 107 seeders.I spent a  a couple of hours yesterday checking every thing in terms connection and everything seems fine but I know something is wrong somewhere,I just can't figure what"
,CrowZero,2012-06-22T17:24Z,"I was having the same problem with some other book uploaded by BBS, even after being connected to 50+ seeders, I was not able to download the book.But I'd wait for a day or two , keeping it in my client and suddenly it started downloading the book.Since then I don't have any problems at all.
Anyways thanks for an another high quality upload, BBS!"
