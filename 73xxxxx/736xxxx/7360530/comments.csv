How a writer can take a story line that should be so interesting and exciting and turn it into such a snooze fest is beyond me. Well, actually not. The reason the book is so terrible is that the author just information dumps. We don't see any of the action, we just hear about it second-hand. Supposedly there is a major cataclysmic disaster happening, but we don't get to experience it. The author is just the newscaster telling us things happening somewhere else. Yawn.... I've been more entertained by an Air Force technical manual than this drivel. Don't bother stealing this book unless you are out of sleeping pills. "
