,trapper7,2012-06-20T21:35Z,"Yes, this is Greta...it's the 11p slot.  For whatever reason, O'Reilly was live last night, and the beginning of the show was delayed by Obama's press conference in Mexico.  That left ""The Factor"" an odd length that would be rather difficult to fit into an hour slot.  Couple that with the fact that Bill began the show referencing the press conference, and you had a show that couldn't be replayed at 11. "
,saxman7,2012-06-23T03:14Z,That's kind of funny :)  Sorry my pvr was down for the initial airing so I told it to record the 11pm.  I am way behind so I haven't seen any of these all week.  Hope everyone likes Greta!  I don't :(
