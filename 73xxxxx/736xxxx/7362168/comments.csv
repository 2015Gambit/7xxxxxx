1. learn what a leecher is.
2. learn how to set up your torrent program
3. do your best not to make idiotic comments in the future."
,Lordkinbote,2012-06-19T21:44Z,"A9/V9

True Blood is getting tired and needs new writers. 

Kill off Bill and Sooky, they are boring one dimensional characters. 

Stop killing off the women with really nice tits. "
,fonzarrr,2012-06-20T11:03Z,"nazgull2k10... you say that like it's bad...

and Lordkinbote... couldn't agree more."

,Gizbelm,2012-06-23T05:37Z,"Go Dufox.

goodolejr83, know that your internet connection, the size of the torrent, and everything else you are running on your PC do come into play with your download. As even something with...12,000 seeds(gawd) can take a few hours to DL."
