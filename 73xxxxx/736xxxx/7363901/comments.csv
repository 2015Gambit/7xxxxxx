,Nomadofdarkness,2012-07-31T20:00Z,"I am trying to get this work over LAN offline and i have got everything setup working. Server emulators running(Plasma,Theater) and game even can login into server but can't see server. I think its because when i tried to patch client exe and server exes with lpatch as provided in server emulator. Client can be patched and run. But after i patch Server exe. It won't start. Do you know the reason why after patching server exe won't open"
