This is the letter that Dr. Kent Hovind wrote to enunciate his reasons for encouraging people to avoid Pensacola Christian College, or PCC. Dr. Hovind is himself a devout Christian, and shares the same Fundamental Doctrine as PCC, yet he makes a very compelling case for the avoidance of this particular institution.

This letter was very nearly lost; I salvaged it, reformatted it, and wrote a preface, but it is otherwise untouched. I have not edited Dr. Hovind's work in any way, and it is my belief that this represents an accurate copy of his work.

THIS VERSION HAS A MORE THOROUGH PREFACE. PLEASE SEED THIS VERSION, NOT THE FIRST.
