,nelf2701,2012-06-18T04:43Z,"Fantastic!!! I only ever use ettv's files, good quality i can trust! :)"
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-06-18T04:52Z,"It gets really fucking old reading comments from people saying that files are password protected. Nothing from ETTV is ever password protected. So, either figure out what the fuck you are doing, or shut the fuck up."
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-06-18T04:53Z,"Oh, and happy fathers day."

,PrettyNInk87x,2012-06-18T05:07Z,Every time I go to get the password it doesn't work.
,PinkMan,2012-06-18T05:07Z,Why the hell is this so frekin slow!
,PrettyNInk87x,2012-06-18T05:09Z,"@TonyTheTiger1969
Then why is it when I download it, its password protected?"
,creative_expansion,2012-06-18T05:16Z,thanks i fucking love u guys! ur hard work is greatly appreciated!
,creative_expansion,2012-06-18T05:20Z,"WHAT U GUYS TALKING ABOUT?? NO PASSWORDS FOR THIS IF A PERSON HAS A SKULL THEY ARE TO BE TRUSTED, SO THEY DONT PUT FAKE SHIT OUT THERE TO FUCK WITH PEOPLE. U MUST BE DOING SOMETHING WRONG? MAYBE BECAUSE UR BIT TORRENT CLIENT DOESNT SUPPORT MAGNET LINKS IDK? I ALWAYS USE U-TORRENT OR TRANSMISSION AND THEY OPEN FINE NO PASSWORDS NEEDED EVER, and if it so happens that u do need one it should be included like with a cracked game I've never used one for a movie or video file just games sometimes need a serial number."
,TonyTheTiger1969,2012-06-18T06:05Z,"@PrettyNInk

Let me turn the question back on you--why am I (and nearly every other user) NOT getting a request for password?

If you are getting that, you are doing something wrong. It is not password protected. ETTV's files have never been password protected.

,majik895,2012-06-18T06:17Z,ETTV rocks
,PrettyNInk87x,2012-06-18T06:17Z,"Well it looks to me that some other people are having this problem also, I use U torrent and I always have. I've been downloading torrents for years now with it and I have NEVER had a problem. So please tell me what I am doing wrong, maybe instead of a rude comment to start with, you should be helpful. "
,mvewtcher,2012-06-18T06:19Z,"@PrettyNInk87x 
Don't click the big green download button, click the small magnet ""Get this torrent"" link.  
Not everyone knows how to do this, so perhaps you aggressive rude people could be more tolerant and helpful to others who are new to this.  Or, you could remain a tool with no class...your choice of course"
,PrettyNInk87x,2012-06-18T06:20Z,Or someone please tell me what I am doing wrong with Utorrent. Any help instead of being jerks would be nice.
,PrettyNInk87x,2012-06-18T06:22Z,"And I wasn't being mean to the new people, if you read up I was having problems also. So before you butt in make sure you know the whole story"
,Gimiesome,2012-06-18T06:43Z,"Thanks etty.....You are the bomb.
And I didn't need no password PrettyNInk,
What are you talking about....."
,Gimiesome,2012-06-18T06:47Z,"You can't expect a Pirate to be nice....
so when one is be sure to thank em. Aarg...."
,schlierkamp,2012-06-18T06:48Z,"ty. but people need to seed more. if ur afraid of getting in trouble seeding, then you shouldn't be downloading either. if ur really scared of getting caught dLing or uLing, get a torrent proxy. can't go wrong there. I'll seed 2:1"
,mvewtcher,2012-06-18T06:49Z,"umm... I was actually referring to the people who were being rude to you.  I thought perhaps you were new and was taking up for you. Your next post didn't show up on my computer until after I posted mine. If you look, I was actually attempting to help you, but I've learned my mistake now"
,botcrawl,2012-06-18T07:29Z,Lets all love each other
,botcrawl,2012-06-18T07:30Z,True Blood bbq at my house
,distillery,2012-06-18T07:49Z,"@ettv: Thank you. 

For those who are having problems. First off, there is NO PASSWORD on this. The file is in .mp4 video format and plays perfectly fine using VLC media player.

Also, people who have a green skull icon next to their name means they have VIP status on this site and do not password protect their files. 

There are other colors for skull icons such as blue and pink as well, but basically if a user on this site has a skull next to their name, you can trust that they're providing exactly what the torrent is suppose to be, and it's not going to be password protected."
,ophia921,2012-06-18T07:56Z,Downloaded and it would not play.  Bad file.
,yohomofo,2012-06-18T08:24Z,fake
,yohomofo,2012-06-18T08:25Z,No file. This is not real.
,yohomofo,2012-06-18T08:27Z,Fake with an add for another site being the only information. Don't waste your time.
,sinsoftheblood,2012-06-18T10:16Z,thanks ettv!fucking hell this douche above me is a troll
,pikel69,2012-06-18T14:49Z,"I trust ettv, and have downloaded from him/her many times, but this one gave me some weird error and stopped downloading..."
,lifelessnbored,2012-06-18T20:21Z,i am not able to download :c...help anyone??
,mvewtcher,2012-06-19T01:51Z,The file isn't fake. There isn't  a redirect to another site. It plays well on any portable media player that attaches to a tv and any computer media player including Windows Media Player.  I suspect the complainers will soon realise they screwed up somewhere and will be too embarrassed to make further comment. you know who you are
,w00tbie,2012-06-19T10:26Z,ettv rocks my torrent world
,hla001,2012-06-19T20:13Z,"You da man ettv! 

@PrettyNInk87x  I would suggest that you re-install Utorrent or try a different program such as Vuze or Bitlord :)"
