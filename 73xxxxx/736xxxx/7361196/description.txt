Foreigners who apply to become Swiss citizens have no easy task - especially when the police lets Bodmer loose to check upon their background, their integration in the society, and the possible danger they represent to the orderliness and cleanliness of the country. Bodmer gets a new assistant to help him corner unsuitable applicants. Very soon, a couple of conformist German physicians, a pretty Eastern European dancer, and the inevitable (and politically troublesome) Italian immigrant and his family start shooting themselves in the foot in their attempts to get the red passport with a white cross.

(Note: I re-uploaded due to request for french and italian audio tracks.  They are included, but there are 2 short scenes which are in the German version but are cut out of the FR/IT version, and therefore there is silence on the FR/IT audio during these two scenes.  FR/IT subtitles will still show during these scenes so it is not a big problem.)
