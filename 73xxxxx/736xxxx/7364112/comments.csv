Nevertheless - for interested, there is made a documentary on this topic (Perelman) and shown on one of the science channels.

I can't recall exatly channel but it would be great if that was to dowload (haven't checked when writing this).

The math problem was actually about the dimensional world we live in and how it's constructed (hard to explain).

After solving this mystery, he actually isolated himself from the science society. I guess that i would do too, after being so close to god's scerets."
