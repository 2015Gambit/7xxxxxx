To start the year well, I publish this gem, engendered in the dark Belgium psychedelia. This LP shared by a very good friend a long time ago and he digitalized in audio CD format. Well, with the master in hand as I cleaned, I repaired and I separated all tracks, trying to keep the LP spirit. I find this album very good, varied and it is highly sought after in the collectors circuit (to me tell me). Appears listed in the bible records sought '1000 Record Collector Dream', 1 star of 5, ie, its price should not exceed 90 euros ... what do I get? is that with great surprise I noticed the price of this LP on eBay: 400 euros! :(
I'm a collector and ask no deception, therefore, good music has no value to me, is a pleasure to share my jewelry with the sole intention of us to enjoy together, we, poor mortals collectors.
