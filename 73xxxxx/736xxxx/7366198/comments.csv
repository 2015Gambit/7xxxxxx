,yotomyo,2012-06-19T15:51Z,"Yes, is it possible to play on a Mac? Can you port it to the Mac?"
,Kan98426,2012-06-19T15:55Z,I don't know really. Maybe? You should try it yourself.
,yotomyo,2012-06-19T16:07Z,"lol you're very helpful. thanks a lot ass licker. you should know what you upload dude. test it out on platforms so when someone asks you a question like that, you can answer them correctly. Macs > PCs btw. so yeah"
,Kan98426,2012-06-19T17:45Z,"@yotomyo Of course I know what I upload. It's a video game for all Windows OS. And I don't give a fuck about you , and your fucking Mac. NOW GO CRAWL BACK WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM. Asshole."
,vcdholo,2012-06-19T23:59Z,"Thanks Kan98426 but one question. Does this play on Android? And I need t know if it will play on all iterations of that also, I mean only if you have the 24- 48 hours it will probably take you to test that for me. 
But seriously thanks for the upload, I appreciate it."
,Kan98426,2012-06-20T09:52Z,"@yotomyo Next time you should ask me ""Does this works on Zilliton?"" . I don't know if it works on Android. In fact, If you can read , it's clearly saying with black on white ""GAMES>PC"" , which means that this game is meant to be played on PC, not Mac and not Android."
,Kan98426,2012-06-20T09:54Z,"vcdholo As I said to yotomyo, I have no information about other platforms. I'm 100 % sure that It works on all Windows OS. About Android, you should try to launch the game yourself. "
,vcdholo,2012-06-21T00:15Z,@ Kan98426 I was just riffing off the previous comment from yotomyo. and I really do appreciate the up.
,Kan98426,2012-06-21T12:20Z,"@vcdholo
Thank you :) At least one good person. So , It works on your computer?"
,doritoman,2012-06-23T00:21Z,"quit bitching you trolls. macs suck dick for the reason that almost no games are available. if its under the PC section, its for PC if you cant read, go die."
,TruthDawg,2012-07-02T06:03Z,where we can find doom 4 ?
,Colossuz,2012-07-13T13:52Z,"@Kan98426 is this the original doom rebuilt on higher detail graphics? because if it's just that, it'd be awesome!!! I love the original, fast and simple."
,Colossuz,2012-07-15T17:26Z,"No, this doesn't work at all (at least for me)"
,Kojiro_S,2012-07-16T08:16Z,"Which Doom64 for PC is this version, the one which uses the original N64 data, or the one using modified Doom 2 data (Absolution)?"
,Kan98426,2012-07-21T10:18Z,Absolution.
