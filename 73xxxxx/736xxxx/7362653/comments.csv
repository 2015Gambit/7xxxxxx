,tyson3000,2012-06-22T05:23Z,"Original file is 3 .iso files. Have opened these with daemon tools, every iso file is now subdivided into 4 folders;
 data
 documentation
 language
 speech


There is no RosettaStoneSetup.exe in this torrent so program won't run"

,bouncer60,2012-06-22T21:26Z,I've been stuck at 96.3 for about four days. Can somebody please seed so we (35) can finish download. TIA
,QBall70,2012-06-23T22:42Z,"@tyson3000 - Dude ... use your head.  Go this link:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7337333/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.5_%5BK_ed%5D_for_Mac

These are just LANGUAGE files.  You have to install the CORE Rosetta Stone software application first before you can install the languages."
,QBall70,2012-06-23T22:44Z,"Once you've installed the core program, launch Daemon Tools, create a virtual drive, and then just simply MOUNT the .iso image.  Go back To Rosetta Stone and select 'Add Language'.

IT'S NOT THAT DAMNED HARD, PEOPLE."

,ironleg,2012-06-25T06:21Z,"@danieleleven

Im having the same problem... Did you find out what to do?

And does updating kill the crack? anybody know?"
,QBall70,2012-06-28T01:04Z,"Okaaay, I have a suggestion for all of you who are commenting about not knowing what to do or how to do it:

If you have a Mac - and you use it frequently - you should ALREADY be familiar with .DMG files and how to mount those images.

For questions about updating, see here:

This is a tested & 100% working copy of Rosetta Stone v3.4.5. Crack included. Updates not allowed! Installation instructions included in torrent!

Please seed, rate up, and comment! I'm wanting to become an established member hereΓÇª I have a ton of apps to share. Thanks!

Folks, y'all are making this much, much harder than it needs to be.  RESEARCH.  Use your heads.  Use the vast resources that are available not here, on the Forum, and on the Internet.

Quit asking for help automatically.  Do the research first and THEN ask your questions if you can't find the answers.

BE ADULTS ... not silly children."
,RockNRollDoctor666,2012-07-01T19:08Z,ur spanish download was awesome and worked perfectly so im sure this will too man. good shit man
,ropato,2012-07-03T15:52Z,"I've been stuck at 99.89% for a week, can someone please seed a bit? Thank you very much!"
,aus_girl,2012-07-04T09:58Z,"Guys, i absolutely suck at computers and i have found this so simple to get to work.

I downloaded the actual rosetta stone program (using macmaverickk's upload of it).  I followed the very simple installation instructions contained within the read me file in that download.

I then downloaded this file.  Once downloaded, i burnt french level one to a cd.  Once burnt i simply opened up the rosetta stone program and added the level from the cd.  When asked for the activation code i selected to activate later.  Thats it. It works perfectly.  No tricks, nothing hard."
,nmc300,2012-07-06T02:52Z,Russian? Please comment no if it is never going to happen.
,nmc300,2012-07-06T03:12Z,Farsi would be better than Russian but nobody has that :(
,nmc300,2012-07-06T16:35Z,"Requires ""Activation Code"" to get all levels? Help!!!"
,jordana.m,2012-07-09T22:39Z,"Do you have/know anyone who has Welsh for Mac? Could you possibly make a torrent for just Welsh?

Thank you! :)"
,ccdgp,2012-07-11T04:58Z,"I am on French Level 1
Unit 1 Lesson 3 and it is saying that I need activation codes to continue. Any help please!!"
,ekovi,2012-07-16T15:35Z,"Having problems getting the app to work. don't really know what i'm doing wrong. i have the rosetta stone base applications, with crack, and i can mount the french levels....but once i start the app it gets to the main page but no farther. It won't let me click START and actually start the lesson.... i've tried reinstalling rosetta stone, remounting the languages....nothing seems to be working, please help"
,clrfld,2012-07-17T09:13Z,"From the Spanish language pack by amaggard, this worked for me too (hope it helps):

amaggard at 2012-06-24 03:50 CET:
GUYS. i created an account on piratebay for the sole purpose of telling you all why the crack isn't working for the activation codes. at least, why mine wasn't working. i was copying mdm.dat and pasting it into the resources folder of the package that was in the SAME folder as the readme document. there was no option to replace. what you actually have to do is open a new finder window, navigate to rosetta stone in applications, right click ""show package contents"" and then resources, and paste it there. this time it will replace another mdm.dat file. it worked for me after that, and the xxxx activation codes were valid. i don't know if this is the same reason that you all were having trouble, but i thought it was worth sharing. good luck!"
,jimmyrat,2012-08-09T03:58Z,"Hey everyone, I know I'm doing something wrong. I've read all the comments, I've done research online and I just can't seem to figure out my problem. I've gotten some things to load fine. Most though I get some thing saying that it's no good when I try to add the language onto my application. I'm pretty new to Macs, so I think that may be some of the problem. If anyone could really give me a step by step on how to mount these images onto dvd first so I can then install I would be so grateful."
,velamarz,2012-09-11T06:56Z,Anyone else having the same issue as ekovi? Having the same problem with the start button being unresponsive.  Replaced the mdm.dat without a hitch and the program ran the intro speech.
