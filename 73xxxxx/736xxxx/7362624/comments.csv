,malagrond,2012-06-27T08:15Z,"It's not a virus. Used it just now, perfectly clean. (Scanned with Malwarebytes, nada.) It works, but only for the 2181 Beta build. The just-released ST2 does not accept the keys and cannot be patched with this keygen."
,lunadie,2012-06-28T04:59Z,"Perfect, works with version 2 Build 2210, first run the keygen as *administrator*, then *patch* and use the activation key!"
,koleapp,2012-06-28T08:28Z,"VIRUS!!!
@lunadie really? a crack that has a virus and you recommend running it as administrator? are you dumb or you take us for jackasses?"
,weemanpow3,2012-06-30T21:36Z,"Lz0 Keygen works fine and on version 2210, thanks for sharing.

FYI, I just copy and paste the license generated from keygen into Sublime license window."
,mobabur94,2012-07-22T01:16Z,"Works great, thanks! Worked for me with 2.0.1 Build 2217. What I did: install, run keygen.exe, patch, generate, copy all, run app, help > enter license, paste, yay."
,yoalch,2012-07-27T17:32Z,"This is not a virus and I have tried it and it works fine, even after updating.

After the update, just run the keygen again, and Sublime Text will be registered again."
,bluesmapdi,2012-08-13T22:26Z,"The keygen does not generate a serial. I click ""Generate"" and no text comes up in the ""License"" box. Any help?"
,jetelina,2012-08-31T16:19Z,"Keygen also does not work for me. Same symptoms, nothing is generated in text box.
- Can you guys that it works for you describe your OS, 32bit/64bit, .NET frameworks and others?
- I'm lanching that on Windows XP SP3 in VMware. Does not work."
