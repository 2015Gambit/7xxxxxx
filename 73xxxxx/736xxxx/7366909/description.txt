This atlas uses high quality photographs and well written, brief synopses to cover an enormous amount of information about skin diseases in one book....This atlas combines over 900 color photographs with succinct descriptions of skin diseases and systemic diseases with skin manifestations to create the most useful single reference in the field. This is the one book I would recommend to a non-dermatologist learning or practicing medicine in any field in any country. For dermatologists, as well, it is useful as a quick and easy reference guide.
