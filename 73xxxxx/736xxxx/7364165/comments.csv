Yes, I ripped this myself. Quality should be top, if it isn't it must've occured during the ripping."

Mate, stop being such a needy loser. You haven't uploaded a f**king thing in 3 years, yet here you are dictating to others how they should be labeling their torrents.

Don't forget that you're getting this for free. So if you don't like the quality get up off your arse and buy the f**king album."

Yeah man, seriously.  It's free shit.  Don't complain."
