,Crez1234,2012-06-24T15:02Z,"DamTorrents, It downloaded a .rar file, which was encrypted with a password and text document on how to get the password, may have been a false link for a bit or something, I don't know. But that's what happened.

@Bewinxed, and you can encrypt a folder full of MP4's when compressing it you dumb ass!
@x2Godx right back at ya, chump!"
,DamTorrents,2012-06-26T18:57Z,@crez: Dude I don't know what you're doing buuuuuuut I didn't upload a rar file...soooooo... You should fix something on your end.
,AbyssWalker666,2012-06-27T16:26Z,"@Crez1234 pro tip: don't click on the big green button that says DOWNLOAD, that's an ad -.-
It takes you to a different site... but I guess those are minor details to you...
 pro tip #2: click on the little magnet icon right next to the green text, that says GET THIS TORRENT 

PS: Sidenote go and run a complete virus scan on your PC now, NEVER open .rar files from dodgey places"
,heretic124,2012-06-30T19:55Z,audio is horrible (2/10). don't download it unless you need subtitles since you don't know english that well. video is 10/10 though.
