Pocketbooks manage to squeeze huge amounts of information and helpful concepts and techniques into a digestible format, usually focused on a particular issue or need. And this one meets those criteria perfectly.

Mike Clayton has managed to crystallise a large number of models, theories and ideas and focus them all on the topic of ΓÇÿHandling ResistanceΓÇÖ so this book is great if you want to swot up when you know youΓÇÖre about to deal with a challenging proposal, sales call or meeting. And there are plenty of ideas in there too that would apply just as well outside work.

He starts with an ΓÇÿonionΓÇÖ model for handling resistance which recurs throughout the book. This provided a useful step by step approach to break down the hurdles, rather than being faced with blanket resistance and then not knowing where to begin.

He considers how resistance is part of a process and therefore natural, so gives you ways to work with it rather than fight it. There are sections on staying in harmony with other people and some useful ideas on how to reframe a situation. Change and Sales Objections are covered specifically and you will particularly like MikeΓÇÖs thoughts on getting help, without dropping a colleague in it.

There are also some reassuring sections on what to do if things donΓÇÖt go to plan and you find yourself in an escalating situation.

Having read this book you will feel much better equipped to handle resistance and  tempted to go out and try it straight away!
