,Stock3rz,2012-07-08T14:51Z,"here is how to edit the album art (image on cover of song) to work in itunes:

1. download mp3tag

2. run mp3tag then go to file>Add directory

3. in the windows that appear click once on the folder that your song(s) is in and then click ""select folder""

4. Download the album art (search firstt of the year album art on images) then right click the image and click save as to download. Without closing mp3tag of course 

5. then go back to mp3tag and select all the songs you want to add art to then rightclick>Extended Tags

6.click the yellow star icon (if you don't know hover over all the icons, it will be the one that says ""add cover"".

7. select the album art you downloaded then click ok. When the files window closes click okay and wait for it to save the mp3s.

8. close and enjoy!"
