Just wanted to give a heads up.
Downloaded this in Germany and like many others (Not just for this Album) got a letter from a legal firm saying I will be fined over 10,000 Euros for downloading this.

I always thought individual users being attacked legally was BS and never happened but I guess Europe is much more strict than the USA. 

Anyway...Just to let you know...Some albums (including this one) are monitored and when you download it, some law firms assigned to this Album by the mother company then sends you this legal attack. And in Germany your internet provider is legally forced to give out the address of the IP that downloaded this thats how they get your address.


Anyway I heard there are workarounds these problems but Im still pretty disgusted by downloading on thepiratebay (at least in EU).

Just wanted to give this heads up so people know what they get into. By the way if anybody has legal advice or any advice about these shit issues, please let me know."
