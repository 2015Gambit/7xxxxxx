,1zczar,2012-06-18T07:19Z,TvTeam you always have great titles but your magnet links never work. What gives? Maybe when you upload give the option to download the tracker file directly?
,5p1n47,2012-06-18T08:21Z,"@1zczar.....
magnets work fine for me.....update your client or try a different one.....I use vuze



thx for another great upload...I love this fucking show"
,xpmule,2012-06-18T08:51Z,"whats wrong with it ?
i clicked and it worked fine..
and what does this guy have to do with the links ? he has no control over them
and certainly has no ability to add torrent files..

didn't want the download though
i want 720p :P"
,elDunge,2012-06-18T18:57Z,Where's the 720p? I was happy the last 3 weeks they were available right away.
,xpmule,2012-06-18T19:25Z,"just check else where for 720p
i always see it posted at rlsbb.com
just after airing and other similar sites
(such as rlsmix)
so just google it or use filestube or something..
Not hard to find at all

Key word: 
Metalocalypse.S04E08.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE

No idea why every show possible gets uploaded here at 720p but this one no bothers until way after the fact"
,elDunge,2012-06-18T19:52Z,"xpmule: I don't like direct download sites, they always cut the connection half-way through. I prefer sticking to torrent. And why do you wonders why shows get uploaded as 720p? I'm wondering why they get uploaded are low quality rip instead, who watch that?"
,xpmule,2012-06-21T06:42Z,"i understand what you say and i agree :)

but when the 720p is not on torrents yet
you either wait or get a http download link ;)

And most shows i get crap quality
but Metalocalypse HAS to be 720p !
Its the best show everz !!!!!111ONE"
