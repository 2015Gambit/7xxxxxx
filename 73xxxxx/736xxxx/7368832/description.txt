Hillary Scott (born February 3, 1983) is an American pornographic actress.

She worked in a bank selling mortgages for two and a half years[3] after graduating from high school, but became bored with it and resented having to wear formal attire and remove her body piercings. In 2006, she said that all her piercings except her ears have closed up.[4]

She came to Los Angeles in late-August 2004 to try out the adult film industry.[3] Scott's first scene was in the film Double Play #2 for Digital Sin,[3] which paired her with Mark Ashley.[5] She moved to California for good around November 2004.[3] After acting in numerous gonzo films which featured her performances in anal sex scenes, she starred in the larger-budgeted feature Darkside with Penny Flame in 2005. At the AVN Awards 2006, Scott won awards for "Best Oral Sex Scene ΓÇô Film" and "Best Group Sex Scene ΓÇô Film" for her role in Darkside. She also was awarded the XRCO Awards for "Best New Starlet" and "Orgasmic Oralist" on April 20, 2006.
