1. Run the CD-ROM, choose the languages:[EN-GB...], install it to  list, till all installations finished, then restart the computer.



2. After restarted, once the service icon (The bottom of the right corner) is available (VIDA Status: Running) but we have a bad news: Volvo changed the security settings so the traditional patch is not working.....


Patching steps:
	1. copy "license" file to the C:     (root folder)
	2. download and install Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
 	http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8961
		OR
		"MS SQL Studio" folder
	3. After installation run SQL Server Management Studio Express console. Login parameters:
		Servername: localhostVIDA
		Authentication: Windows Authentication
	4. Try to open Databases -> AccessServer. If you receive error message you need to delegate access to these databases (Google is your friend, or ask an SQL admin)
	5. open "filldb.sql" 
	6. run query
	7. copy VIDA2012A_patchVIDA content to you VIDA folder (default install path: C:VIDA and overwrite all files)
