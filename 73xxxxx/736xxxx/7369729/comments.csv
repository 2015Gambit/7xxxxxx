,kispaci,2012-08-08T09:56Z,rest -> reset password
,aeshj01,2012-08-08T18:34Z,Administrator in the database or in windows? have been using administrator account in windows
,kispaci,2012-08-08T23:01Z,"@aeshj01 the operating system of ""Administrator"".

I tried this method on two computer and worked. Very important that not enough that your user is in ""Administrators"" group. You need to use the real  Administrator user.

Don't reset the SQL administrator's password (""sa"" user)"
,aeshj01,2012-08-09T23:19Z,Thanx a bunch. it worked like a charm.

@NorbaggenV70: sure, you can use DL DVD, or you can store on USB. USB is faster.

Does the new crack/patch take care of everything or am I missing a step. Thanks in advance"

You need to run the patch after successfully installation. The patch do the changes in newly installed DB."
