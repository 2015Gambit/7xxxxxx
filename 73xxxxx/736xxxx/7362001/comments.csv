,N0v1N0v,2012-07-12T16:14Z,"Hmm thats weird :/ I'm seeding it still, so I would think it would work. Is it not showing up in your client, or will it just not download?"
,xCurlyQ,2012-07-12T19:32Z,It's showing up in my client but staying at 0%.  I've been able to download some of the other torrents you've made so there must be some sort of problem with this one.
,N0v1N0v,2012-07-13T14:03Z,"Hmm. Thats weird but I think I know the problem. The torrent got stopped, even though it should have seeds. Either way, try it again and I'm sure it will work."
,xCurlyQ,2012-07-14T00:20Z,"I have attempted to download this torrent multiple times, the most recent one I had downloading for 5 hours and it is still trying to download, and it is still at 0%..."
,N0v1N0v,2012-07-15T21:22Z,Hmm Im not sure. I guess Ill delete it and reload to see if it will work a second time :/
,xCurlyQ,2012-07-20T03:15Z,It's up to you.
,xCurlyQ,2012-07-30T07:25Z,"I thought I should let you know that when I attempted to download this recently, it worked... I don't know if you did anything, but thanks."
