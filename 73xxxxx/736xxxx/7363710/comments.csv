when you see all my files in a bundle your see it so much easier to read
if not then change the view on your darn win 7 or xp folders
and make the fields longer..

how lame calling a file

S01E01.corrupted.xvid.avi

when mine is better S01E01.xvid-[ Corrupted ][ date ].avi

as how do you know if thats a tilte and not a bad file?

another example s01e01.1.1.2.xvid.avi

when mine was s01e01,xvid-[ 1+1=2 ][ date ].avi

another example

season roll backs.. espc for storage hunters..

S02E01 when it should be S03E01

now you dont know S02E01 is the new upload or not now
cos theres no darn date in the AVI name

no one is forcing you to download my rips"
