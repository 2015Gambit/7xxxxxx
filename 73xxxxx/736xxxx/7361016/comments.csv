,ian73,2012-06-23T11:44Z,"File is working good. If no audio, use VLC player..it works fine on it."
,skholcomb,2012-06-25T22:48Z,I am not receiving any volume.
,Tanlic,2012-06-30T09:20Z,Downloaded quickly like all eztv's...is there an episode 22 or was that the last of season1?
,dee60,2012-07-04T16:33Z,"SoE21andE22 work fine with VLC player but I watch these on my LED using WD TV HD media player (the old model).
E21 no sound
E22 plays fine.
Using Media Info the biggest delta is E21 ""Writing application: Greetings nukers! H264=CFR, AAC=VBR. Demux and see! :)""
There is no reference to Writing application in E22.
Go figure."
,dee60,2012-07-04T16:41Z,"SoE21andE22 should read S01E21andE22.
I'm downloading now: The.Firm.S01E21.Chapter.Twenty-One.480p.WEB-DL.x264-mSD found here:
