,User264,2012-06-19T16:37Z,"Ok, hope someone will bother to help me. I am using Razor's rzr-skrm as base install and then applying Reloaded updates, but my mods installed via Nexus Mod Manager won't start; even when I try just one mod, SkyRe. Is it some incompatibility between Razor release and Reloaded updates and if it is, which install to get? If not, what might be the problem?"
,User264,2012-06-19T16:50Z,"To make it clear, game works fine, but it's vanilla. So I need help with why mods do not work."
,Puff3r,2012-06-19T17:32Z,@User264 try updating SKSE
,User264,2012-06-19T17:38Z,"I figured it out: all that was needed was to add
[Launcher]
bEnableFileSelection=1
to SkyrimPrefs.ini file and it fixed the problem. Hope it helps others as well."
,driftburger,2012-06-19T19:17Z,question my last patch is v1.3 do i need to uninstall it and install this new version or i can just overwrite the files?

You can Overwrite, RELOADED updates are cumulative."
