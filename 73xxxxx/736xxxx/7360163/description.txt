Steven Seagal Shows off his refined and exquisite acting style while exploring the depths of his one dimensional acting capabilities in the ground braking genera of something called a "POLICE DRAMA". I can now die in peace knowing I have seen everything.
Think of every Seagal film and now imagine him on TV.
The show is ok
