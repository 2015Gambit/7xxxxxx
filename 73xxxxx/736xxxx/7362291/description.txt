"[b]Z Magazine[/b] is here to change the way media treats the undead. We're here to help you embrace the perfect, rotting corpse that you are. Our mission is to give you hope that zombies are making progress in this world. There are models, designers, chefs, parents, and other real people out there who are proud to say they are the walking dead."
Z Magazine is the first magazine written by zombies, for zombies. It is set in a reality where zombies exist and cohabitate with the living. Within its pages are original articles, advertisements, and zombie photography, all geared towards the undead. It is full color printed on heavyweight paper.
"Z Magazine makes being dead damned attractive." -Peter Clines, author of Ex-Heroes, Ex-Patriots
