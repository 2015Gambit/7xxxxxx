,ceska02,2012-06-18T19:53Z,"After this I get attack move glitch, char moves in slow motion (just char). Anybody have sema or know how to fix it ?"
,The_Pirate_Bar,2012-06-18T21:32Z,Do I need to have all the olds updates before taking this one?
,Cartman90,2012-06-19T00:36Z,"I've read in some other post that you don't need to install the previous updates beforehand.
But how is that possible when all updates have around 200mb?
I would be very appreciated if someone could explain me how this works xD"
,Kaliedo,2012-06-19T01:11Z,"I dont know how these things are made so this is just a guess.

I think they all have the same files with a few added with each patch, they only thing changing is the coding for those files to fix bugs therefore the size for each patch says around the same size.

it would explain what you dont need patch 1 before patch 7 since 7 already had its code changed to address the fixes in 1.


I could be wrong though."
,JohnHolmesII,2012-06-19T01:39Z,"@Cartman90
It's simple:

Bethesda, let's say, has a broken file that they sent out with the game.

Bethesda then patches it.

Then Bethesda finds more problems with it. They put out a new patch.

The size of the originally broken file hasn't changes significantly. So no matter how many new patches there are, the same content is always patched, and always distributed.

If something doesn't need the second patch, they send it out with the new updates anyway."

Fix please?"
,Xsama,2012-06-19T11:50Z,Do i need any other update prior to this one? or can i just install this one and it's like having them all in one?
,dansko2,2012-06-19T16:53Z,"@FenrirVII
I don't know about this one, but I had to reinstall all my game and mods for the update to work"
,SirReaper,2012-06-19T18:42Z,"Can someone pls tell me if this is indeed the last version for PC or is PC still getting the Xbox version ?

1.6.90 ?"
,Shadowcat0909,2012-06-22T07:36Z,"If I haven't updated since original release, do I have to have all the other updates installed as well, or just this one?"
,vectoro,2012-06-22T22:28Z,"I canÂ´t walk im just levitateing and when i try to talk to someone the game crash, plz help me!"
,lordquad,2012-06-23T12:08Z,"I have now applied this update onto a game install that previously was updated to 1.3.

There was no problem with this update and the game started up just fine. I could just continue from my last save like nothing has happened, and I'm already more than halfway through the main quest and I have completed a few of the guild quests. I seem to have no problems moving around and mounted combat seems to work well. I can't cast spells though.

So it appears that this update is cumulative since it is apparent that you don't need update 8 to get this working.

A word of warning here is that I have only run the game for a brief moment and I don't have any mods or extensions installed, at least not what I'm aware of. I may have installed something long ago and forgot about it although I don't think so..."
,MrSinclair,2012-06-24T22:20Z,"Anyone else here have access to the Steam overlay after this update? It's the strangest thing, I'm even using SKSE."
,sirjafar,2012-07-05T02:21Z,Does mounted combat work for anyone? I tried doing mounted combat but I wasn't able to. I tried pulling out my weapon while on my horse but nothing Any hints?
,Charlydlv,2012-07-11T12:57Z,OH GOD. When I started skyrim I COULD ACCESS STEAM COMMUNITY. Does this mean that I will get banned for connecting to steam with skyrim even though I did not buy it? what did the update have????? when I had the older version the game was not associated to steam! what do I do? what will happen to my account? HELP ME!!!!!!
,Charlydlv,2012-07-11T13:46Z,"Also, I searched a bit about this, and I have more questions. Does this count as a banable offense or did the update simply add Skyrim as a non-Steam game? Oh, and I realized that it also downloads mods that I suscribe to in the workshop. Is this intended? PLEASE HELP!!!!"
,RedSeth,2012-07-24T23:53Z,"guys, what i have to copy into Skyrim install directory? only folder called '' data '' or what? please help me"

,tendernuts,2012-08-08T03:41Z,"fear not my man that happened to me and i got passed it, make sure you have ownership of these files and go back to the unrared file and make sure everything from the data file trans into your skyrim file. then everyone seems to have their own bugs with it..."
,ApolloJunky,2012-08-11T23:38Z,"I did exactly what I had to do. I just dragged everything from the update into the 'The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim' folder. I replaced what had to be replaced. and merged what had to be merged. 

After doing so, I launched skyrim, game worked. But once I actually start playing, MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE MASSIVE LAG occurs. 

The lag is nothing that I've ever experienced before and its MASSIVE. Game is barely playable. (I made a backup thank god)

 Does anybody know whats the problem? Please do help D:  For reference I'm using the Razor 1911 release. Please do help :o "
,Cromiell,2012-08-25T03:39Z,"So, does this torrent cover all of the updates from 1-9 or is this just the 9th?"
