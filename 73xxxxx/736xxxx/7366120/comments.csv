I've been dying to know what software or tools to use to make it as perfect as you did, cause a lot of files are in mp4 and can't be seen on for example a ps3 or dvd player. I will appreciate the help. Thanks! "

fixed audio sync as not all mp4s are equal
and timing can move where the ad breaks happen for some reason"
