,voltrix128,2012-06-18T22:07Z,mr_ahmad and tpb_4_ever are the same accounts?
,tpb_4_ever,2012-06-18T22:51Z,"@voltrix128, mr_ahmad is a very good friend of mine and we both run tpb_4_ever."
,bomofoo,2012-06-18T23:01Z,Thank you!
,Mercyflush64,2012-06-18T23:36Z,Does this require the previous upload and fix or is this meant to be a complete replacement for those two uploads?
,tpb_4_ever,2012-06-19T00:59Z,"@Mercyflush64, You will need to download all three."
,Mercyflush64,2012-06-19T02:40Z,I can't get this to extract without giving me errors
,Mercyflush64,2012-06-19T03:23Z,"I got it all fixed up. I had to download a 7z extractor. My winzip wasn't allowing the long path names. I also combined all three into a single zip file that made things a lot easier for me to store.
Thanks yet again for all of the hard work!"
,harz_er,2012-06-19T06:48Z,"Please upload the JHA Wagon Pack from AP for the London-Brighton Scenario.
Many thanks"

,EAC350,2012-06-21T03:06Z,Will you upload the Service Pack 1 with a new skidrow included?
,tpb_4_ever,2012-06-21T13:14Z,"Service pack 1 will not be uploaded because it doesn't really do anything except give you slightly improved sky and light effects, and increase lag."
,lolxd17,2012-06-21T14:29Z,"Thanks for this but still can't play the route :( This is what I get when I load a scenario, that's how it looks like:

How do you have to install this and what am I doing wrong? Hope someone can help ;)"
,TheNemmy,2012-06-22T12:51Z,any chance for service pack 1 update tottrent ? yet
,TheNemmy,2012-06-22T12:52Z,"sorry didn't read your message about service pack 1, okay then we'll stick to this but won't it be hard to install updates in future if we don't have service pack 1 ?"
,Vlaxii_BG,2012-06-24T06:28Z,"@lolxd17 This DLC is not working on original version of TS 2012. I tried it on my own,and it doesn't work. You need to download SKIDROW version of TS 2012. Download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6701439/Railworks_3_Train_Simulator_2012_Deluxe-SKIDROW"
,lolxd17,2012-06-25T12:57Z,"All right, I see, thank you! :)"
[T],EvilCraze,2012-07-03T19:30Z,Man No New Updates ?? 
,Promythyus,2012-07-06T23:16Z,"tpb_4_ever, any chance you could upload the missing assets for those of us who own Railworks on Steam (like lolxd17 and I)?"
,jason0484,2012-07-19T16:02Z,"I am having some issues with finding the .rwp or .rwk file in the unzipped files. Tried using the search tool, but no file comes up. I have .xml, .bin, and other file types, but none that allow me to use RW package manager to install. Any help is appreciated. PM/E-mail me if possible!"
,weltall2,2012-08-28T02:12Z,Do we need Railworks 3 London to Brighton and 4CIG Sourthern to be installed before this? (The other torrent)
,weltall2,2012-08-28T02:13Z,Never mind all I had to do was read better the comments XD
