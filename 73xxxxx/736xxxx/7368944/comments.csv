Well i don't know about the others, but for me it is unplayable. At least this release. You can't get farther then main menu, textures are missing, and constant crashes. As far as i can tell this torrent defeated itself."
,God_Am,2012-06-20T16:06Z,"It works!

Attention: un-checking Babylon DLC in in-game menu isn't enough. 

Do it manually. Delete DLC_Deluxe directory in Sid Meier's Civilization VassetsDLC

You won't be able to play Babylon but you'll be able to play every other Civ, including new ones, of course. After I did this, I get no errors, both in-game and in Civilopedia. 

Loaded every new Civ just to make sure. It's all good. Acceptable until fixed expansion comes out. 

Cheers!"

 - cannot select any leaders(program is modified so that permanently the leader is Random)
 -trying to 'Edit' causes the window to disappear(esc backs again but any selection causes window to disappear again)
 -deleting the Deluxe_DLC does nothing of value and applying the 'Fix' causes the old start movie to play and then the game crashes before the movie finishes.
 -Using all suggestions with different tweaks only causes the game to crash directly after 'Start' is pressed.
 -selection of different leaders in DLC option window does nothing.(removing deluxe dlc for me the option to select that leader is just gone...no more Babylon, editing the file means the game crashes before I ever get there)

open Sid Meier's Civilization V install directory and copy desktop extrated files into the main install directory folder
 copy and replace all files it asks you about
open the ""Sid Meier's Civilization VassetsDLCDLC_Deluxe"" folders to find ""Babylon.Civ5Pkg""
make a copy of this file on your desktop
open the desktop copy with...Note Pad, Notepad ++, and scroll to the bottom of the code.

COPY THIS:

anyway...

First installed Simon's release of the base game http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7047491/Sid.Meiers.Civilization.V.GOTY-SiMON

Second installed this torrent.

Third, installed the 1.01.705 update http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7555993/Civilization_V_Update_patch_v1.0.1.705_[3DM]

Finally go into your game installation folder, assets, DLC, DLC_Deluxe. Find the file ""Babylon.Civ5Pkg"" and copy it to your desktop. Open the copy in notepad or notepad++ and add the following lines of text....


BabylonianModels.fpk
BabylonianNebuchadnezzarTextures.fpk



These lines should be placed just before the last line in the file, which says   Save the file when you're done, then copy it back to the DLC_Deluxe folder (you may need to clear read-only status for the folder to do this if it won't let you overwrite.) After this the game is fully playable for me. :)   Oh, and just fyi the steps I read on previous pages to install updates 7 and 8, both are lower version numbers than the expansion takes you to, and for me caused more problems than they fixed. :D"
