Would you believe gimpy is the reason I signed up for an account a while back? Just so I could thank him for his continuous good work! :D"

,twijjit,2012-06-20T20:28Z,"Much thanks, gimpy! I dont have a trutv cable subscription and never have, but because of you and people like you who've made these shows available, I've become addicted to almost everything TruTV airs. Its really nice knowing I can go look at yesterday's schedule, see what new episode aired, and come back to here to grab it. :)"

if you didnt have cable you were fucked, son!

thanks for the upload."
,GrokkoW,2012-06-25T14:07Z,"Yeah... i started an account just to post thank-you comments as well. not having cable TV would suck so much more without uploaders, I felt compelled to let them know at least one person appreciates the effort. "
