Information
------------------------------


Join Marine biologist and award-winning filmmaker Rick Rosenthal as he sets out to capture on film the biggest, fastest, most dangerous game fish in the sea: the ancient creatures known as billfish.
The largest of all billfish is the marlin. They top speeds of 60 miles an hour on migrations that can span 9,000 miles. The largest, always female, weigh in at over 1,000 pounds, and are known as "granders." Ernest Hemingway immortalized the grander in The Old Man and the Sea, the story of an elderly fisherman locked in a life and death struggle with this apex predator. To Hemingway's great disappointment, he himself never landed a grander, although his novella captures the impact of this huge and graceful creature.
Rosenthal's pursuit of these exotic fish unfolds in NATURE's Superfish. Two years in the making, Rosenthal's documentary travels to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as well as the Caribbean Sea in pursuit of these giants of the deep.
