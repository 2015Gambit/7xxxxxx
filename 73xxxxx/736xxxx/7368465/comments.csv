,aybitz,2012-06-21T21:41Z,"***UPDATE:

The current Availability of the torrent file for all peers is at 56% and rising.

Availability should be 100%+ in 24 hrs. Patients is key.

Next Update will be released once Availability reaches 75% for all peers. 

@tarzan2003 and @pifase, 
Seed is back up, but is seeding via ""Initial-Seeding"", which commands the bittorrent client to upload only pieces that are not being shared."
,aybitz,2012-06-22T07:17Z,"***2nd UPDATE:

The current Availability of the torrent file for all peers is at 75% (1.750) and rising.

Availability should be 100%+ in about 10 hrs. Patients is key. Hang in there.

Next Update will be released once Availability reaches 2.000 and Initial-Seeding complete."
