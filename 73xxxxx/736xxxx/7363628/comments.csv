,Flamestrike,2012-06-19T02:31Z,"also, the video quality isn't the best."
,cstraybeck,2012-06-19T20:54Z,Bone! Can you get this with english subs instead? I'd rather watch it with subs. I hate dubbed versions cause they are usually off sync :/
,FBInot,2012-06-19T21:16Z,how bout just get a fcking english copy--your uploads have gone to sht dude
,cstraybeck,2012-06-20T15:28Z,"Holy shit! The english dub is horrible. Specially with headphones. I sounds like it's a few narrators trying to translate the the film's lines over to English. Anyways, thanks!

I'm still waiting for this to get English subs instead. I would rather watch it in French with English subs. "
,cstraybeck,2012-06-20T15:28Z,"A: 8 (I would have rated it lower because of the english dub, but the sound is very clear.)
V: 7"
,prettynerdy,2012-06-20T18:26Z,@FBInot: Then don't download them or provide a better upload. Stop acting like you're getting ripped off.
,schizoLur,2012-06-21T17:15Z,"Where the hell did they find the voice actors for this dub? they're f'ing terrible,
I'm an Irish Atheist who was raised catholic and can say ""Allah ou Akhbar"" in a more convincing Arabic tone.
And it just gets worse,
nice work on the Up(as always (.Bone),
but
I'll go for the French with subs if I can find it"
