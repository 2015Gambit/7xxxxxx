I am running Windows 7 (x64) with this working in Ableton 8.2.2.

Having trouble loading the VSTi?

Make sure your Philharmonik.dll and Philharmonik.ini are in a folder of their own in:

C:Program Files (x86)VstPlugins
(Or the directory you have chosen for your Ableton Live Plug-Ins)

i.e., Mine is like this:

C:Program Files (x86)VstPluginsPhilharmonik
(The .dll and .ini files inside the Philharmonik folder)
(I just created a New Folder inside and renamed it Philharmonik)

The deal is simple, they need to be in their own folder regardless.

Important! Ableton Live 8.2.2 needs to be ""Run As Administrator"".

In Ableton go to:

Options...
Preferences...
File Folder (tab)...
VST Custom Folder [Browse]
Click Browse
Select the Philharmonik folder that we just created.
The only plug-in that should now appear is the Philharmonik plug-in.
Now, change the plug-in path back to the folder you originally had it on.

Now its installed and everything is back to normal with your VSTs.

For running the VSTi in Ableton Live 8 for the first time...
You will need to use the Keygen again.
Just do the same thing you did to activate the Standalone.

Enjoy!"

^ To fix 23 Violins!
You need Sound Updater 1.1b.
23 Violins are from DVD2.
23 Violins is the only .sti that is not working in this torrent.

By installing Sound Updater 1.1b, you'll fix this problem."
,K4HLU4,2012-07-18T23:18Z,"Before anyone posts about the false positive of swizzor.cc trojan; located in the keygen...

I'm letting you know it's just a false positive.

If you don't believe me, then run it in sandboxie.
I always sandbox keygens anyways.
If you're smart enough to run a VSTi in Ableton...
Then you're smart enough to run a keygen in a sandbox.
