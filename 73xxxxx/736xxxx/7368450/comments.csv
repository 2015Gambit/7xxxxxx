,akuma_619,2012-06-20T07:18Z,Like all AFG uploads this doesn't work on Xbox 360 but does work in standard Phillips dvd player. This should be nuked but seeing how this is a P2P release and the scene moved onto MP4 its a moot point. How I wish that FQM and 2HD still kept releasing xvid avi tv shows like they did the first two months they switched to mp4.
