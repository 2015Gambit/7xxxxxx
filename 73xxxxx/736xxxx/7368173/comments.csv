thanks and   good luck ^^^^^^"
,epheterson,2012-06-21T06:03Z,"Bro you completely removed IE. Not only is there no way to access the internet (even to download an alternative browser), my SolidWorks install which uses IE components cannot function. I'm trying to dl IE9 onto it to see if it fixes my installation issue. Besides that, it is tiny and super quick! Torrenters beware, some things will definitely not function. "

"
,2NDS0N,2012-06-26T07:30Z,"Forgive my ignorance but, since there doesn't seem to be an autorun or setup file included, do you simply replace the files from the original install disc for these in order to install? "
,nileshtambe,2012-06-26T08:09Z,"its bootable iso.
u can burn iso to usb or sd card pendrive
use ultra iso or similar software
do not waste cd dvd's"
,nileshtambe,2012-06-26T18:02Z,"To convert ISO to USB-

1 Insert USB stick
2 Open UltraISO, then ""File"", then ""Open"", and navigate to ISO
3 Click ""Bootable"" tab, then ""Write Disk Image""
4 Select USB stick with dropdown arrow
5 Click ""Write""
6 Done!"

,x264specialist,2012-06-29T08:16Z,I could use it. but windowsupdate didnt work
,nileshtambe,2012-06-29T09:52Z,"Windows update doesn't like if you touch WinSxS. It will just install the system update readiness tool, which will re-install a bunch of shit into WinSxS, and then updates will fail because they attempt to update stuff that doesn't exist.

Some updates will install, others will not. Generally, the ones that will not install is due to stuff being removed, and it can't update what isn't there. "
,x264specialist,2012-06-29T13:25Z,could you do a windows 8 below 1GO? I saw you have one already

,Carocrazy,2012-07-07T11:25Z,"This has been a nightmare so far.  Could anyone tell me why Terraria says I need .net 4 yet the installer says I already have it?

,Carocrazy,2012-07-08T00:45Z,"@nileshtambe

This seems to have fixed all my problems, and is otherwise a useful torrent as well.

I highly recommend the torrent nileshtambe posted, as well as this version of Win7 to anyone."

,Hydro7731,2012-07-12T20:00Z,awesome download no problems at all but can u make this same image with all updates till june 12 and net framework 4 will really apreciate it if u do 
,nileshtambe,2012-07-13T10:19Z,"i tried more than 2-3 times, vlite just exits while performing operation doesn't give error also on updated iso(install.wim),  regarding .net 4 it has to install after setup completion to update all component and that 40 mb file increases windows installation by 1gb and requires 8 min to install"
,run3,2012-07-14T16:52Z,Great torrent! Are there more updates than just SP1 on it?
,krhthkos,2012-07-18T08:28Z,"Very nice windows i like it too much, i had put it on my internet cafe and is realy good, but i have a small problem our language is Greek and we have problem with the office also with the autocad, is working but some letters from greek is missing and on installation brings problems, can you makea an edition with full support with greek language? also the clock takes the correct clock from the internet and for the greek is not correct i change all time the clock."

Now I have a problem! After installing this and installing all my programs and everything, I realized I need IE9 for Skype to work, but I can't seem to install it. It always ends in an error and reinstalling everything is the last thing I want to do. Do you think there's any way you can help nil? Thanks!"

,marmat78,2012-09-11T12:28Z,"Thanks Nil, installed and this version seems quick. However a problem unlike full versions I've tried - Windows update doesn't work even though I have activated Windows. Wants to install a 'Windows Update update', then only displays error code 800F0818. Also, MS Security Essentials downloads updates fine but can't turn on Real-time protection. Any clue?"
,marmat78,2012-09-12T02:04Z,Now MS Security Essentials real-time protection works. Still no luck with Windows Update. Solution anyone..?
,run3,2012-09-13T12:20Z,Read previous comments.
,marmat78,2012-09-14T20:54Z,"@run3: which ones? I read one from Nil about some updates will install while others won't, in my case Windows Update doesn't work altogether i.e. cannot even search and display latest available updates. Ideas?"
