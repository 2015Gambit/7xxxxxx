,netusername,2012-06-21T00:56Z,Is there anything for x64
,hero44,2012-06-28T12:22Z,"Latest version for x64 is 3.66. When will you release 3.72? Does file CrackedPatch.exe is clean? Anyone checks that or just just download, run and comment ""omg wtf thanxzzzzz!!!"".... Please, anyone check this with some antivirus.
And LnDL release damn x64 version."
,xpmule,2012-07-02T03:22Z,"I noticed a couple of LnDL's sites are down and people are spreading this version with the patch that was released with 3.68 i think. I released on TPB v3.68 x86 and x64 patched, so not sure if the group is gone or what.."
,Hexetera,2012-07-04T22:21Z,"I Keep getting a message that says ""Byte Pattern not found or already patched!"" when i try to patch it, what am i doing wrong or what's going on? Theres no ""Read me"" files with this torrent and the torrent information has nothing on the crack, so i can only try to install it in the dark. it's starting to piss me off to be honest -_-"
,xpmule,2012-07-04T23:25Z,"This web page always has the newest versions..

http://www.nsanedown.com/?request=12225906

I noticed the old x86 only patch was removed and a new one was added.
this time the patch is suppose to be good for both x86 and x64.
I'm busy and havn't tested this but it seems this person patched other versions before so i bet it safe etc"
,hero44,2012-07-08T00:51Z,"@xpmule: This patch is overloaded with malware. https://www.virustotal.com/file/5dea8a29ce0f583254e3657ff45706027659ef9d1be7bb4ed71c68065c0c95da/analysis/

DO NOT UNPACK/RUN THIS PATCH FROM http://www.nsanedown.com/?request=12225906"
,zero1zero,2012-07-09T18:15Z,"8 hits is hardly ""overloaded"". "
,xpmule,2012-07-13T06:19Z,"yeah uhh malware ?

,xpmule,2012-07-13T06:22Z,"you shouldn't visit places like virustotal unless your familiar with the concept of a false positive.
The link i posted to is perfectly fine and some people need to learn a little more about computers thats all"

,lancelight,2012-08-20T23:08Z,"Stop seeding this bullshit.  Not only is the patch for the 3.68 version (Thats right, its NOT FOR 3.72),  it's also got a pretty sweet trojan in it to boot.  The patch is actually for the 3.68 version but if you CRC it, you'll notice that it doesnt match the REAL 3.68 crack that was put out by Ln earlier.  The trojan contains a keylogger which sends all those porn URLs u type in to some greasie haired hippy in a basement somewhere so that he can steal all your porn pw's, and whatever else he damn well feels like it.  Maybe he wants to post as you on your BF's FB wall that you just got laid last night.  ROFL.  Anyway, bottom line is that this torrent is nothing but shit.  Remove it.  The clown who linked the other one,  it was no better.  Stick to the 3.64 torrent, its still the cleanest around."
