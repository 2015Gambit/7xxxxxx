The Eternal Sea (USA - 1955)

War / Drama

starring . . . Sterling Hayden, Alexis Smith, Ben Cooper

"Very realistically produced film. Difficult, if not impossible to find. Anyone
who knows anything about WW2 will appreciate this film and the subject matter.
It's in black and white and it's a gem of a classic. A must have for anyone who
enjoys film based upon fact."

"One of Republic's most elaborate productions of the 1950's, The Eternal Sea is
the biography of American Admiral John M. Hoskins. Sterling Hayden delivers a
superbly understated performance as Hoskins, who continued to serve throughout
WW2 despite the loss of a leg in the early phases of the conflict. The Admiral's
farsighted activities as Commander of the aircraft carrier Princeton led to the
development of the more sophisticated jet aircraft carriers of the Korean War."
