COMMON means business. After twenty years in the spotlight, COMMON is at the top of his game: starring roles in film and television, a bestselling memoir, humanitarian efforts through his Common Ground Foundation. Now with the December release of his hotly-anticipated ninth album, The Dreamer, The Believer, he's poised to make us believe in real hip hop again. (amazon.com)
