,bryentheartist,2012-06-18T08:38Z,so you gonna seed cause its at 0 since you added it here
,libertaswv,2012-06-18T10:25Z,"^ Guess you're talking to TVT? dunno.

as for me, i intended to seed it, but it's been stuck at 17.1% (not zero) for hours."
,bryentheartist,2012-06-18T18:11Z,stuck at 17.1 for a day now :(
,libertaswv,2012-06-18T21:45Z,"All is well.

I'm sure bryentheartist  is already aware, but for anyone coming in late to this exchange: the seed is rolling now (monday, june 18th 2012). Downloading at 400kb or so on my end, 76% complete... uploading is fluctuating between 300 and 400kb..... Looks like it's going to be fine. I'll help seed for at least a week."
