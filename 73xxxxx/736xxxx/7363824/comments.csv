,c00ltun3s,2012-06-18T19:03Z,do you upload your torrents to any other sites? ive been trying to switch to other sites that dont require users to use magnet links. I have tons of problems with them and am hoping you have an account somewhere else. All your lana torrents are appreciated =]
,Phntzm79,2012-06-19T16:22Z,"No, I just upload to the Pirate Bay but my torrents usually show up on many other sites that still use torrent links. Change your torrent client to uTorrent or VUZE which work well with magnetic links! Peace, Phantazm"
