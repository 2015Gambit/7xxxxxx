,jamesensor,2012-06-20T01:55Z,"One of the very games I've been expecting all year is finally here!! Thanks!! I've seen some videos in youtube from and there's already some douche bag chills tearing the game apart because of graphics. Graphics my *ss, if you're looking for that then go play something else. Here you'll find a game with substance, not looks. A great alternative to diablo and warcraft all together."

,Wisher_SiD,2012-07-14T15:45Z,"The game wont run at all for me. I installed all the usual prerequisites (Dx, VC++, etc) and it still wont run. I tried running as administrator and in compatibility mode, but nothing helped. Can someone help?"
,b0l0na,2012-09-01T22:46Z,"Anyone having an 'access violation' error and crash upon exit from the Dugout to Malangar Greens should load an earlier save game just before Dugout/Mines and wipe Malangar Greens of every enemy down to the last bug. It seems that the cutscene crashes if there are unexpected enemies ""in the background"" that are not handled correctly.

I had paused the game for over two months until I stumbled upon this solution in the Spellforce official forum. I tried it and it worked perfectly, yay!"
