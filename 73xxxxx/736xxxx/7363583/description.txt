Graf started 1988 by winning the Australian Open, defeating Chris Evert in the final 6ΓÇô1, 7ΓÇô6. Graf did not lose a set during the tournament and lost a total of only 29 games.
 
Graf lost twice to Gabriela Sabatini during the spring, once on hardcourts in Boca Raton, Florida, and once on clay at Amelia Island, Florida. Graf, however, won the tournament in San Antonio, Texas and retained her title in Miami, where she once again defeated Evert in the final. Graf then won the tournament in Berlin, losing only twelve games in five matches.
 
At the French Open, Graf successfully defended her title by defeating Natasha Zvereva 6ΓÇô0, 6ΓÇô0 in a 32-minute final.[11] That was the first double bagel in a Grand Slam final since 1911.[11] Zvereva, who had eliminated Martina Navratilova in the fourth round, won only thirteen points in the match.[11]

At the US Open, Graf defeated Sabatini in a three-set final to win the Calendar Year Grand Slam, a feat previously performed by only two other women, Maureen Connolly Brinker in 1953 and Margaret Court in 1970.
 
Graf then defeated Sabatini 6ΓÇô3, 6ΓÇô3 in the gold medal match at the Olympic Games in Seoul and achieved what the media had dubbed the "Golden Slam".
