,Johna23,2012-07-23T15:05Z,"globeplus i am a great admirer of his work.
I downloaded this game and I can say because it has the videos. and if you can solve? because I would like to have it completed.
And not many torrents of the full game, all are dead.
some solution, please?

Sorry for my bad English, I speak Spanish."
,1BestEnemy,2012-07-24T12:49Z,Thanks! The game works great but I do not see any cut scenes in between games? I don't know if it's just my PC or the game config itself. Any help will be appreciated.
,1BestEnemy,2012-07-26T00:44Z,"Hey Globe, What renderer should I be using while playing this? Because your default renderer isn't showing up :("
