Whether your a tail-dragger or tricycle kind of guy, the RV-8/8A retains the fighter-like feel of centerline seating. With a integrated Meggitt Magic 2100 AP Unit, sit back and take in the magnificent views from the 360 deg canopy. To add the icing to the cake, we had our very own Vans RV8 pilot take the controls to put her through rigorous tests. With the detailed feedback we wouldnΓÇÖt have been able delivered this latest master piece.

Introduction
In 1995, VanΓÇÖs decided to re-visit the tandem seating concept. Even though the side-by-side RV-6/6A had become the most popular homebuilt design ever, there was still a significant percentage of pilots who really wanted centerline seating. The consensus seemed to be that a roomier tandem airplane with better cross-country capability would be popular.

A one-of-a-kind demonstrator was built and introduced at Oshkosh in 1995. The response left no doubt about the desire for an airplane like the RV-8. The ground around the display aircraft was beaten into a trench and VanΓÇÖs personnel were fending off people waving handfuls of cashΓÇªbut not for too long. The RV-8 went on the market in 1996 and complete kits were available by the end of 1998. In short order, it was followed by the kit for the tricycle gear RV-8A.
