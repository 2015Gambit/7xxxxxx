,SwedishMeatball,2012-06-22T16:44Z,"Thanks for all the great downloads so far. It's been a good run.

I just wanted to let you and everyone else know.....

I received a copyright infringement notice thru my ISP, on behalf of NBC, the network that owns the rights to Eureka.

It specifically:

Identified this torrent.
Identified my IP address.
Identified which of my computers the file was on.
Gave me the exact file name, size and directory.
Identified ME!
Contacted me thru two of my email addresses!

All correctly, I might add!

VTV may be done for?
Downloading any NBC show may be done for?
Not using a seedbox may be done for?
Maybe all downloading of copyrighted shows, soon?

Just wanted to let everyone know. I am not an alarmist, by the way......"

,SwedishMeatball,2012-06-29T12:22Z,"Eureka is a syfy show, and syfy is fully owned by NBC"
,spork2012,2012-07-06T16:27Z,Fracking VTV!..I also got a copyright notice in the mail. First time ever. Did you notice that VTV pops up outta nowhere and uploads Ep 9? eztv is my usual source...guess I learned my lesson. Fuck off VTV or should I say NBC.. and thanks so much!! asshole.
