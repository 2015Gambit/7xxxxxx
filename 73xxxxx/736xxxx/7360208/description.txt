 Storyline

In 1983 all children aged nine years or less fall into a coma at the 

same time. The children remain in the coma for the next 10 years and 

all children born during this time are born into the same state. Ten 

years later Tom Russel, who was imprisoned after killing a man in a 

fight, is released from prison and returns to his home town where 

his older brother has a son in a coma. That night all the children 

wake up but they are hellbent on killing all the adults. It soon 

becomes apparent that the children share a sort of collective 

consciousness and as one learns they all learn. As they get smarter 

they learn to disable motor vehicles and eventually to use firearms. 

A group of survivors, led by Tom and Jean, try to escape to the 

safety of a base located 60 km outside the town.
