,davin_g,2012-06-22T05:26Z,I have a question. All of YIFYs videos are all pixalated after I burn them and watch them on my Samsung Tv. I use visual hub to convert and burn. Is it just his videos are low quality or is there a trick when burning 3d movies because all other movies I burn the quality is fine. TY YIFY...just wondering if I'm the one doing something wrong.
,jmyers73,2012-06-22T18:46Z,i am new to the home 3d scene....do these movies use the shutter glasses with 3d tv's?
,wizardsnapper,2012-06-24T15:41Z,If you are having trouble converting them to DVD then I suggest using the program ConvertXtoDVD. It works 100% and no quality lost. I make Lots of Home movies on my camera and its the best I have used so far. It will convert all video files provided you have the proper codecs. I suggest using CCCP Codec.
,wizardsnapper,2012-06-24T16:31Z,Why are all your videos side by side?
,Lmccainx,2012-06-25T10:48Z,@wizardsnapper  because they are ment to be viewed in a 3dtv or 3d monitor. not for normal monitors because you'll view the same image in slitscreen.
,tigeron,2012-07-15T13:10Z,hey yify you are a legend   i rarely leave comments on tpb because everyone gets caught up in the hype   i just wanted to say that your 3d ups are the only ones that i use and i know i can rely on them and you   thanks heaps mate and keep bringing them   cheers
