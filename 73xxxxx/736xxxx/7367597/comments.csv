,furiouswindbottom,2012-06-21T04:52Z,"I can play this on my PC no probs but not on my stand alone Apacer media player which is connected to my tv. It usually plays everything, even Blue Rays and other MKV's. Just not yours for some reason. Was the same with your game from the day before...black screen with audio.

Watching on the computer is shite so I had to download another version. I live outside the UK and it's far too late at night (3am) to see the games live. Thanks for the effort but I'll be avoiding your MKV's from now."
,mickeykau,2012-06-21T06:29Z,"I had the same issue as FuriousWindbottom - can't play video, can only hear audio, not even on PC.
Footy, are you using some new codec that is required?"
[T],footy,2012-06-21T12:51Z,"The video files work fine, they is no picture in the video at the start for just like 10 seconds, then you can see the picture, plays good with VLC Player.

@mickeykau : no, i am not using any new codec."
,mickeykau,2012-06-22T00:20Z,"I use GOM player and the picture never comes up - same for my Sony DVD player.
Haven't tried VLC player, but if you can avoid having blank video at the start, it might be better for others.
Thanks for the effort of the upload."
