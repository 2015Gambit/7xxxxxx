Audio: English DD5.1
Subtitles: English, French, Dutch, Spanish.
Menu: Yes (Edited Nederlandse button added)

*****Notes: The Setup menu was not working proper push it the movie begins to play.
We fix that, taking out the audio from the menu and highlighted buttons solved that problem, and give u now 8 sec time to select subtitle language.
Replaced te Spanish button in Nederlands.
So Spanish subs are in the movie not the menu. 
Also added al stream Yellow subs and lower them all to 1 line in picture 1 line in black bar.*****
