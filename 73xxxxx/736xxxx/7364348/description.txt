I noticed that there seemed to be some serious lacking in the availability of civilization 2 and some format problems.

So I went ahead and prepped this package for you, it's a zipped up version of the Multiplayer gold edition with the NO CD patch, as well as the windows 7 / 64 bit patch, and the simultaneous multi player permanent enabler all pre loaded into the package.

It should be extract and play, I've only tested it on my one other system but I'm not having any problems with it! Any problems please feel free to let me know, I'm sorry but this is the first time I've ever hosted a torrent so please be patient if something does happen.
