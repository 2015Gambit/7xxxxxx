First, if you're having troubles booting make sure you try running as administrator on vista and 7!

Second, if you start the game and you just get a black screen, click in the black region and you should find that everything works just fine!"

Because every time I select it i get ""component 'COMDLG32.OCX' or one of it's dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid"". PLEASE HELP coz I reckon that this would be a good torrent if I could figure out how to use it =)"
