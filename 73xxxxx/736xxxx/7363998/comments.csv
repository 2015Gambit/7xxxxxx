I was looking for this a couple of days already which is original and not yet activated or a crack file.

@leea51
Yes you can, you need to use Parallels.
Google it ;)

No, but you can download any language through Windows Updates from control panel.

Good luck ;)

,SinCujo,2012-06-23T05:19Z,"Anyone else getting BSOD? The third time I got the black screen of death and I'm currently re-installing Windows 7.  I got the black screen after installing visual studio 2010 and before installing VS 2010 I got two blue screen of death.

By the way if you are installing this you might want to back up your files asap.  I'm only using this computer to game and now I have reinstall 40 GB of games.

To set up a restore point go to control panel and click system and security. Click on the Systems link and on the top left side bar click system protection.  Under the system protection tab click the Create button and name your restore point to the current day, month and year.  This will save you a lot of time and trouble if you do anything stupid like me."

,duriotic,2012-06-23T23:04Z,"Installs quicker than any other version I've seen thanks to the slip-streamed updates.  One odd thing I noted during updates was that this version doesn't seem to offer ""Microsoft Essentials"" in the optional updates, you must instead search them and download them on the general internet.  Other versions offer it during your first updates after installation.  Any insights as to why this is missing?

Both the mounted .iso (with Malwarebytes, Symantec and Super Antispyware) and the installed OS (with MS Essentials in a virtual machine) scan cleanly, btw.

Have seeded to over 3.0 so far and continuing to enjoy this."

Thank you :)

@leea51
You're welcome ;)
Can't help you with Mac, sorry..

@rxyres
Yes you can boot from USB, but you need a program to prepare the USB for installing Windows.
Search Google ""install Windows 7 from USB"".
Good luck.

What I'm doing is loading the iso in daemon tools then moving to a stick with wintoflash. After that I delete ei.cfg so that I can install HP (maybe that triggers something)."

@blablah01
Only the Ultimate version.
Why do you need Home Premium??
You must know that all versions (except Starter) use the same resources (RAM and CPU).
After you know that you should go with Ultimate ;)"
,blablah01,2012-06-29T00:23Z,"@maherz
Well, Ultimate offers me nothing feature-wise that I'd use and from some articles I've skimmed Ultimate seems to boot a bit slower (no SSD unfortunately).

There's that and something buried deep into my subconscious from the old PC days ""use only what you need""."

,duriotic,2012-07-02T03:00Z,"@extracube:  Maherz just rolls in the latest updates from MS each month.  It's for convenience, not ""better.""  If you have the old one it's okay, just will take longer to update from a fresh install.

@r4heel:  Download and run this, then take the 64-bit version if your computer can use it, since it will recognize more than 3.25 GB of memory and is faster with some kinds of software.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor"

,Tovagulet,2012-07-03T22:52Z,"@extracube There is no May version of Windows 7, uploaded by Maherz :p You must be getting confussed with Windows XP

or when finishing installing just downloading WLoader... "
[V],Maherz,2012-07-04T21:27Z,"@extracube
You got an answer from duriotic.
Big thanks to him :)

@r4heel
If you have 4 GB of RAM or more, then use x64. If less then use x86.
Good luck.

@roacvor
No serial for this one, only the Loader to activate.

@Geggla1
Burn the ISO into a DVD using any burning software, don't just copy the ISO file to a DVD, it won't work this way!
Search Google: How to burn ISO files
Regarding the loader, just download it to your PC and run it after you install Windows 7.
Good luck.

@Tovagulet
Thank you.
By the way, I do have May release for Windows 7 but it's not on TPB :)"

You're welcome :)
Yes, someone merged both my 32 and 64 bit releases into one ISO and uploaded it.
He mentioned that the ISO doesn't fit into normal DVD though."
,rebel4liberty,2012-07-13T13:23Z,"To those who have problem with booting this on USB. 
1. Go to google, search for ""PLoP"". Download it, follow the instructions.

2. You will burn PLoP on a CD. 

3. You put the downloaded Windows 7 files to your USB.

4. You restart your PC, go to BIOS and make sure you select the option where the system will boot from the CD

5. Restart PC again, after some seconds, your PC will boot the PLoP CD that you burned. 

6. The PLoP program starts, it will show different options such as ""Boot from USB"" Boot from Floppy"" and so on, of course you choose ""Boot from USB"". 

7. Now your Windows 7 installation starts. Later you kick some ass, good luck!"
,.Revoltz,2012-07-14T03:36Z,multi language?
[V],Maherz,2012-07-15T18:27Z,"@rebel4liberty
Thanks.

@.Revoltz
It's English.
But since it's Ultimate version, you can change the language to whatever you want!
Just go to Windows Updates in Control Panel and choose the language you want.
Good luck."
,stevesie,2012-07-16T01:41Z,Thank you! I hate that so many people include a removeWAT auto-installer with their win7 releases so I was quite happy to find a clean release that is already updated(that will definitely save some time later).

Have been using it for a week now..

,Heartofthorns,2012-09-03T00:29Z,"@ divitedsouza 
I have used this windows 7, also have used the windows loader 2.1.4 by Daz (it's in Maherz's torrents) and I've had no problems yet. I downloaded all updates from Windows Update including the ones for genuine activation and it says it's genuine. Checked on the Microsoft site itself. So I doubt there's a reason to worry.
If you're still paranoid about it, you have to avoid the update number KB971033. You can always remove it if you want, Google has many articles on it.
Hope that helped."
