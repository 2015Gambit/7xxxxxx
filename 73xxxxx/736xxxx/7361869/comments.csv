,Barbazulada,2012-06-29T03:39Z,"I can think a dozen of more fitting actors to be Agent 47 in this movie...

What's next? Solid Snake by Justin Biever?"
,LordHakkera,2012-07-10T01:33Z,They didn't cast Vin Diesel for this for what reason exactly?
,Du2L5r1,2012-07-23T05:53Z,"@LordHakkera, how many reasons do u want?? for starters; 
1) vin diesel's pricetag would probably be more than 3 times what this direct-to-solid media release could earn, meaning they'd be broke before they even started filming.
2)vin diesel isnt really typecast for this kind of role.
3)vin diesel is shit.
4)whats wrong with giving other, younger, newer actors a chance, or should we just have all the movie roles in the world played by vin diesel.
5)vin diesel is shit.
6)i dont really rate vin diesel...lol"
