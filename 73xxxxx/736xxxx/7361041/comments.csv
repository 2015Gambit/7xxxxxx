,OlaNordmann7B,2012-07-08T17:06Z,"Excellent! Thank you very much for this one, will seed - as soon as I have downloaded it (takes some time, with only 1mbit line). Hope you also have other movies from Candid-HD, will help you share this one - as long as I can."

Beyond perfection. Perky headband cutie from Workout 2, Castle 1 & Horse Ride has gained some curves here. The best Candid-HD film spread yet.

The movie is interlaced so use VLC's ""Yadiff (2x)"" deinterlace mode to get smooth motion."

,madscientist42,2012-07-30T22:24Z,I guess that's rather your ISP being cowards. It's not like this is the only thing being pirated here but yes they are vigilant. I actually think this might be good advertising for C-HD. It only makes me want to buy their 3D BD discs.

Any other content from CHD would be highly appreciated."
,oswi,2012-08-18T08:32Z,"I use VLC & tried it on ""Yardif (2x) as suggested by madscientist42 but it made no difference to the way it played as in it did not play smoothly.
I tried other settings but nothing made it play smoothly."
,madscientist42,2012-08-18T21:42Z,You also have to turn deinterlacing on (press d)... You'll get full 60 FPS! However the high resolution makes deinterlacing demanding on the CPU which might introduce jerks. Lower your display refresh rate in Windows control panel and you'll ease the load and get better performance.
