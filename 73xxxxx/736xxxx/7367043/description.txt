a brand new project from EmulatorNexus that aims to emulate a EA/Origin-free server for Battlefield: Bad Company 2.
Now fully functional and working without any major problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

How To Make it work:

Run the BFBC2Updater.exe on the game's root.
After you updated the game, copy this torrent content inside its folder.
[TURN OFF YOUR ANTIVIRUS or it might detect some false positives]
Run BFBC2Game.exe and login with you Emulator Nexus account.
Create a soldier, click on the server browser and press "Search".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that is still in beta phase, so you might encounter some minor issues..
some of them are:

-Master-Server disconnection (pretty much fixed)
-Ranking is currently not working, so you won't level up. On the other hand you have everything unlocked until this gets fixed.
-Friend's list is also not working for now but for what i've read it wil be available soon.

You need to register an account here: http://emulatornexus.com/

i'm not affiliated with emulator nexus on any way and i'm just trying to publicize their product.
