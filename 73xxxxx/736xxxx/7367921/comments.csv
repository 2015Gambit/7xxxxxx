And TLA, it is against scene rules to use header stripping on any x264 encodings AND it is also against the rules to convert AC3 audio to AAC for a 720p release, as the nfo indicates you intended to do.

Perhaps FoV or BiA can release a PROPER of this, please. I think there is more than enough reason to do so. "

All you get is just a 'mute' Hi-Def picture. "
