,HatianDeadwish,2012-06-19T19:43Z,Can you pls re-rip this in 320kps pls? 18 songs at 52.76MB... quality is no good.
,HatianDeadwish,2012-06-19T22:34Z,"More seeds would be nice, been stuck on 96.9% for like 5 hours now."
,robbiegaga,2012-06-20T04:07Z,"Seems like you didn't even listen to it. Try listening to it before saying it's bad quality, it's actually pretty amazing quality if you ask me. Try listening to it first because I WON'T be re-ripping it. You get what you get."
,ronaldlindblom,2012-06-20T12:19Z,Thanks! But why seed only to 96.9%? What happened?
