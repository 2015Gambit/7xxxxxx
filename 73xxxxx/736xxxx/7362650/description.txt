2)  Death of a Star Mira 
For the first time in human history, scientists have found the ultimate faith of Earth written in the comet trail of a massive red giant 'shooting' star. As we read this stellar trail, we learn what happens during the end of a star's life to reveal that when they die, stars can project a killer beam of radiation and particles deadly enough to kill all life that lies in its path. Worse still, there may already be a beam headed this way with our name on it!
