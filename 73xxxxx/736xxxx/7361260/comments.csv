,peterparkerdatsme,2012-07-16T12:16Z,"Thank you for this download. Works fine.

Here's A how to:
1) Unpack and install. *DO NOT run the program yet.*

2) Disconnect Ethernet cord. (Internet)

3) Use the key generator to generate a valid serial and apply using a fake username.

4)  *With Internet cord still disconnected* Open Xilisoft DVD Creator and go to Tools>Settings and disable Auto Update Search.

5) Use Windows FireWall to block these things (one at a time) in the Xilisoft folder: 
A) dvdcreator
B) dvdcreator_buy
C) Xilisoft DVD Creator Update.

Search on YT for ""Block Program From Accessing Internet"" if you need help doing this."

,HM666,2012-08-12T23:25Z,"I'm having major issues with the Xilisoft DVD Creator torrents. I had downloaded one a couple of months ago and it worked great. Then out of no where it decided that I should register it for no reason. I'm guessing its because I did not add the firewall exemptions, mainly because I had no idea what/how to do it and no one gave any info. So now no matter what I do I cannot install a new version of this and use a keygen or a serial. It comes up saying that it failed when I put it in. If I disconnect the internet like was said I get a message that says it failed to connect to the network. I have uninstalled this crap 10 times and I have gone and made sure that I got ALL the files of Xilisoft and deleted ALL the registry entries. There HAS to be something that I'm missing. PLEASE help :("
