***Special thanks to travelinbeat for the audio to make this video even better. The 720p soundboard quality audio was just not the same as it 
sounded at the show. There were no effects on Yukimi's voice. This audio is exactly how it sounded at the show.***

Source: CA-14's @ NOS > CA ST9100 > R-09HR @ 24/96
Location: 9ft high, DFC FOB (~50ft from stage)
Editing: Tracking, fades, and normalization (each channel independently to -0.10dB) were done while the show was laid in Sony Soundforge 10.0a (Build 425) as a wav file. Periodic loud points were enveloped slightly to allow for more headroom in Normalization.
Conversion: Trader's Little Helper v.2.7.0 (Build 172)
