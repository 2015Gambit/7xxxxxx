,Phreegamehendge,2012-06-20T06:54Z,I'm trying to upload a bonnaroo show too. WTF? Why won't it show a seed on either of our torrents? What does your piratebay tracker say?
,mhorton01,2012-06-20T07:11Z,"it just takes a few to update the tracker We both have a few seeders now! SEEEEEED! May the fleas of 1,000 camels infest the armpits of those who don't!"
