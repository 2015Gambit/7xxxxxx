Ofcourse you can!
Just burn the ISO into a DVD with minimal speed, then insert it into the PC you're installing Windows on.
Good luck."

,sintient,2012-06-25T10:35Z,SOLID! I used UltraISO to 'burn' to USB and installed on my ASUS Eee 1015PED. It worked with no problems. Now I can continue to experiment with Linux distros and still be able to reload Win7.

[V],Maherz,2012-06-30T14:20Z,"@harry047
TPB only allows magnet links at the moment.
Search Google for my torrent, you'll find it.

@srinumad
Anytime man ;)"
,erick2012,2012-07-02T12:29Z,Is multilingual ?OR ONLY LANGUAGE INGLES
[V],Maherz,2012-07-04T21:29Z,"@erick2012
It's English.
But since it's Ultimate, you can change the user interface to any language you want.
Just go to Optional Updates in Windows Updates in Control Panel and download the language you want.
Good luck."
