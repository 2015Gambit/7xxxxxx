,jimbuck2,2012-06-19T11:09Z,"Yeah, same here.  I thought my uTorrent was screwed up somehow.  Maybe something's wrong with tpb.  Usually bbs has high download speeds and right now shows a lot of seeders.  We should be going warp 9 instead of churning our wheels at 0."

@jimbuck2 

Some people are having problems downloading some of my torrents.I'm at a loss as to why.Everything on my side shows that it's seeding, it's showing 85 seeders.I downloaded this from another computer and got it with no problem.I'm going to check to see if anyone else is having this issue.


If anyone else is having issues please let me know

Thanks for your feed back guys"

,jimbuck2,2012-06-19T16:43Z,"BBS, I wish I had some answers but I notice a lot of noobs have the same problem.  There was one guy a couple of weeks ago that finally just threw up his hands because despite all his uploads none of the leechers could retrieve them.  Your dls on the other hand are usually greased lightning. On top of all that you provide some of the best stuff on tpb. Please don't be discouraged and thank you for all the great work you're doing."

Thank you for your feedback my friend

I could not find anything wrong on my side and I was starting to get worried because I got a few comments on the problem but eventually everybody gets the download so I'm thinking it must be with magnets, hopefully that's the problem"

,shamanist,2012-06-19T22:24Z,"Well, add my name to the list of people who cannot download this torrent. Have had it up for several days and nothing... Does anybody have a solution because it would be great to see one right about now! LOL!"

Well,I'm stumped 

I can download it from 3 different computers here at home.I have no idea what's the problem is

I think it might be the magnets but just in some cases.you might want to try a different client see if that works

If all else fails,register on Suprbay and shoot me an email and I will email the book to you
