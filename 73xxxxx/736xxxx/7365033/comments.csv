,TsarB0mba,2012-06-19T08:40Z,"ettv and eztv usually upload the same releases, although sometimes ettv uploads xvid first (or only). In my case, ettv has been beating eztv to the punch for months and I haven't gotten a bad rip that wasn't fixed by a PROPER/REPACK afterwards. Thanks again for all your efforts ettv!"

I wanted to let VTV and all downloaders know....

I just received a copyright infrngement thru my ISP, on behalf of NBC, the owners of the rights to Eureka.

Bascially, it was a cease and desist request, informally given, with a threat of prosecution if I did not comply.

The communication:

Identified me!
Identified which of my computers the file was on.
Identified the exact file name, size AND directory.
Identified this torrent.
Identified the torrent index site (here).
Identified my full name, address, phone number and two email adresses.

Don't know what is coming down the pike for downloaders in general, or for VTV.

I am not an alarmist. Just communicating what happened."
