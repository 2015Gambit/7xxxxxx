Roberto is a gay boy who shares the house with his mother and sister. He spends his days wandering around the house, aware that all he can offer and demand of his young lover is a fling. When Roberto meets Raul, a man in his fifties who invites him to his place, Roberto is awakened to sexual and violent intimacies that he did not know were possible.
