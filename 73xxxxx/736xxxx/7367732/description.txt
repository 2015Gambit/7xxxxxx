Engrossing, erotic and sometimes comic, L'ENNUI tells the story of restless philosophy professor Martin (Charles Berling), tired of teaching and troubled by the happiness of his ex-wife (Arielle Dombasle).
His mid-life crisis takes a turn when he meets the young, enigmatic and far from intellectual Cecilia (Sophie Guillemin), with whom he embarks upon a sexually-charged affair.
Enlisting his ex-wife as a reluctant confidante, Martin claims that he is bored by Cecilia, yet continues to see her, fascinated by her uncomplicated attitude toward love, life and sex. But, upon learnng that Cecilia is also seeing a much younger man, Martin's desire becomes tainted with jealousy and eventually becomes an uncontrollable obsession that threatens to consume him.

L'ENNUI is adapted from the novel 'La Noia' by Alberto Moravia (published in the UK by Secker and Warburg under the title of 'The Empty Canvas').
