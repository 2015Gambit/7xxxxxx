,Xpaxos,2012-06-17T18:17Z,Iberic... I am very interested inthe invite and I am more than willing to submit to a daily ratio check. I am a member of another smaller private tracker and my ratio is above 20. Please let me have it because I will UL for a week or longer. My ratio with the other tracker speaks by itself. Thank you!!

I will keep a good standing ratio."
