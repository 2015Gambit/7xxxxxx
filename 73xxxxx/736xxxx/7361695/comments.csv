,Namorax,2012-06-18T01:48Z,"I think tvteam is a bot just reposting things from their site, its always safe, but you wont get much info"
,Namorax,2012-06-18T01:50Z,If tvteam posted custom descriptors for every torrent they would spend 24 hours a day typing. They put a fuckton of torrents up every day
,thrawn2112,2012-06-18T07:37Z,"yeah, and that's why i'll never bother with their uploads"
