WORKDONE: 

Ok took the new video sent too us by 7 Dwarfs and then took 23mins from the german AOE release to make a complete 
video file.The 7Dwarfs release had the intro missing and then 20 mins more missing in several places...so had too cut the 
videos up and rename each file 1,2,3, etc 
From here we rotated,cleaned and filtered each part ....now the 7Dwarfs release is sligthly more cropped but doesn't cause 
you too have a fit and start break dancing on the floor.It also had some movement so it needed too be cut too hide it 
The AOE release you all know about .....really nice except the dam flicker 
Audio we used riplegendz line and that was just missing 1min of audio so we used ADTRG release.Both audios were nice,but opted 
to do it this way and was easier too sync due too having the untouched audio file 
Oh the AR in the film changes aswell when it goes from the 7Dwarf release too the AOE release ...only way too append the files 
into one
