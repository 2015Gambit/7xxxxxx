 Dr. Baldev Chaddha , a well qualified          
 fertility expert, runs a fertility clinic      
 and a sperm bank in Dariyaganj, New Delhi,     
 that guarantees a high quality and             
 specialized sperm for the purpose.             
 Unfortunately he has more failed cases to      
 his credit than successes. A healthy, high     
 performing donor is the need of the hour.      
 Vicky Arora , a young, good-looking, Punjabi   
 boy from Lajpat Nagar, is the only son and     
 of no financial support to Dolly, a widow,     
 who runs a small beauty parlor from home.      
 As luck would have it, a small brawl in        
 the colony brings Dr Chaddha and Vicky,        
 face to face, where Chaddha, concludes that    
 Vicky could be THAT donor he has been looking  
 for. From here on, Chaddha's days and nights   
 are spent in convincing Vicky to become a      
 donor till he finally gives in. Vicky finds    
 his love interest in Ashima Roy , a pretty
