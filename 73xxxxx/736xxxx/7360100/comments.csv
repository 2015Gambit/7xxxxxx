i am american and i can admit this country has serious problems. We have an obesity epidemic that is spiraling wildly out of control due to wide spread laziness and the average american functions at below an 8th grade education level while living in a state of constant debt.


if you want to secure a future for yourself and you live in america then your best bet is to get off your ass, get in shape, and get an education in a respectable field so you become self sufficient. if you are counting on this country or its people to continue to be a major super power at its current rate of decline you are just one of those idiots functioning below 8th grade level.



...its just common sense.

if you saw a business full of fat lazy morons that was bleeding out more money than it makes, you would expect that business to fail.

The point is that the U.S. isn't #1 in anything and hasn't been in quite a while. I think most would agree that at one point, America WAS the greatest country on earth. Through corporate governance, corrupt politicians and an apathetic populace, it is quickly losing any resemblance to it's former glory. I think the U.S. is a GREAT country, just as Belgium is a great country, or Spain, or Algeria. It's only the American sentiment that they are they GREATEST country in the world that makes it so sad.

,SignificantOther,2012-06-23T00:26Z,"An indictment on the USA and the crumbling of yet another 'Rome'. After seeing the crimes against humanity perpetrated by this country, you'd think it would be pleasurable to watch it descend into the rat's nest it's fast becoming, but it isn't, because human suffering is upsetting regardless of one's perception of deservedness. This movie is pure genius, and as with most brilliant social commentary, it comes from the mind of a comedian (Bobcat Goldthwait). It's great to finally see a movie that incorporates one of the incredibly moving ballads of Alice Cooper, something I've often wondered as to why they're so often overlooked. Not many movies move me to cry, but this was definitely one."

,frm0027,2012-06-23T04:35Z,"Yeah Amerika is just horrid. We are do have a shiate government right now but the people are the same. The greatness of other countries can in some way shape or form be attributed to America. I'm sorry but if we weren't outsourcing to rat holes they'd be bigger rat holes. If we didn't privatize medicine some of the biggest medical advancements would still be on the shelf. Show me a commie nations gifts that hold a candle to Americas? Why do the bin ladens of the world come here for medical treatment. Are we not a nation of people
from other nations. The same ones people flee like rats to come here and then bash the hell out of us as soon as they get here.  I for one would take an American doctor over a Spanish. I'd rather be poor in America than in Russia. How many Russians can say they went from poverty to starting a major fortune 500 company or even a ma and pop shot that employs people? If the doll is what you all want then the doll is what we will get. I for one am not so fond of letting America slide. What are we sliding too that's so much greater? If Russia or China or any nation had it right then why are we sitting here discussing America? If your big your under a microscope and easier to see. Yeah we've made mistakes but I feel we still are in a better position to make them than any nation you have named. In Russia you have to pay people off mafia style to go anywhere in business. China cant even count it's poverty levels it's so enormous. If I break my arm I get it fixed today in America. We aren't this horrid nation. Have you seen slum dog millionaire? Have you seen the rest of the worlds slums? You can crawl out of American slums and become somebody whether you want to believe that or not. It's why mexicans flock to America like Mexicans flocking to America. We could put a wall to the moon and they'd build rockets to get here. I live in Texas and see this first hand daily. You do not see massive lines going out but coming in. This is rediculous. Look at those stats. Please. Even in this crap economy we are having to talk about shutting the border down bc of the overwhelming number of people swimming hiking flying sailing and soon rocketing to a nation that still stands for something. Like property rights and liberty. We just didn't outsource all these terrible things that libs seem to talk about. We also outsourced freedom and the idea of it. Countries have based their entire model on the US and have succeeded. I know we are just wretched scum. So when the next Haiti happens we will see who people cry out too. Americans don't have to be forced to give. Everyone I know gives in some way. Listen to Bob Katz though he's the genius who made the film. Or I'd your an American go to one of these countries and move there or I'd your not move here and tell me we don't have it ten times better. Chances are you'll be unemployed in Spain or way underemployed and in the USA you'll actually have a fighting chance."

Secondly I sincerely believe that America is the greatest country on earth.  This is not due to our government or even our people.  Our country is great because of the ideals it was founded upon.  No other country in the world was founded upon the ideals of equality and freedom for everybody.  Every other country in the world began as one warlord or another questing for power.  Our country does indeed have it's problems.  We are becoming fat and lazy.  Our government has become corrupt nearly beyond redemption.  We have been driven to the point of bankruptcy by irresponsible leaders.  But if you think we make war on civilians your a moron.  Go to Iraq.  The people there use to run in fear of their own soldiers.  They would hide their daughters to keep them from being raped.  I know this because they did the same when we first got there.  Before I left Iraq there wasn't a farm within twenty miles of my base where the people wouldn't invite us in for food when we came."

The trail of tears which was one of the biggest genocidal massacres begin with the Indian Removal Act of 1830. that's quite a bit after your 14-1500's eh? ...anywho, thanks to the uploader for this fantastic satire."

,Revolutionary_Enigma,2012-06-28T20:39Z,"you people are braindead. 1 you can the indian things happened in the 1400s-1500s, newsflash it was happening from the late 1400s to the early 1700s by europeans and then continued by the americans well until the time of the civil war while the republic continued to expand westward. the u.s slaughtered thousands upon thousands of indians and forced their elderly and  women and to move to oklahoma most of whom never made it while their children were forced into boarding homes, to take up christian names and brainwashed into forgetting their culture  becoming whites. this could have easily been avoided if policies were taken into tolerence and co existance between settlers and indians; instead policy was strictly removal  from newly colonized lands in favor of replacement by white settlers. FURTHERMORE america DOES NOT ALLOW ITS CITIZENS TO ELECT A PRESIDENT, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE ELECTS THE PRESIDENT! THE VOTE BY THE CITIZENS IS TO JUST SEE WHO THE POPULAR CANDIDATE IS GO READ A 10th GRADE HISTORY BOOK DUMBASS LMFAO. THE PEOPLE DO NOT ASSIGN ELECTORALS TO THE COLLEGE; the REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERSHIP DOES BASED ON HOW MANY REGISTERED VOTERS THEY HAVE IN THE STATE. THIS IS NOT DEMOCRATIC WHAT SO EVER "

Good copy.
Not a horrible movie. The kid is kinda annoying. Decent satire, but it should've been about the world, not just one country. I'm not American, but the problem has grown beyond just one country. The whole world is like this. America just airs their own dirty laundry a bit more than the rest of us.

And, as an aside to the comments: America is a Corporatocracy, not a Republic or a Democracy. It hasn't been either of the former in a few decades now."
,pa55el,2012-07-01T12:06Z,"@jesra, that's a simplistic view at it; ultimately, govs are also _reflections_ of their societies (say, it's not nearly only the gov who broke Greek economy; BTW it's perhaps even more accurate to say that the Pakistan _made_ the Taliban, to keep Afghanistan in check) 

@nuggz503, the concepts of republic and democracy are not mutually exclusive... 

@Whiteytheclown88, classy, you outright deny the XIX-century Manifest Destiny delusion, its effects on native populations ...while, at the same time, displaying all major traits of that perverted world view yourself, deluding yourself into ""we're the best"" (while, with for example the ""American Dream"" and ""land of opportunity"" _myths_ - the US is at the _bottom_ of developed countries in actual measure of this stuff, social mobility; the popularly derided at your place so-called ""nanny states"" are at the top BTW; ""best infrastructure"" ...it's not willing to maintain even a half-decent mobile phone network; and the industrial base enabling your consumption is in PRC). 
The best part, ""anywhere else"" = ""few carefully selected shitholes"" to you  ...really, trolling requires more finesses than that; and also not a total disregard for basic history (Atlantic triangular trade is hardly a thing of the Spanish; oh BTW, Pakistan and Iraq are your allies; and you export suffering to China so you can continue with rampant consumerism)"
,Cyberdactyl,2012-07-04T18:53Z,"Never understood why people continuously write long reviews and dissertations on the film and other people's comments.

NO ONE GIVES A SHIT.  We want to see three things.

#1 - Is it fake
#2 - What is the quality V, A, cam, DVD, Bluray
#3 - Does it download quickly or not

The rest is boring minutia to wade through to find the three I list. "

,tiz2,2012-07-05T17:06Z,"@ Revolutionary_Enigma: You are the one who needs to read your old history books a little closer, does it say anywhere that America is not a democratic federal republic? Indirect elections can be a part of a democratic mode of government, as it is in the USA. To only define democracy as it was in ancient Greece, where every citizen could vote for every proposal, would mean democracy doesn't exist any more, and is no more correct than saying a republic is always different from a democracy."

,mangler58,2012-07-11T22:47Z,"Frankly, anyone who runs their cocksucker as such, are little smart mouth punk ass bitches. Who have never done a damn thing but sit behind their computer. TRUTH be known, in public, this would not happen. I'm almost 60 years old and fought in two wars and those who lost their lives at my hand never insulted anyone like you people do. You all need to grow up and learn to respect others and help them to better themselves. Not condemnation and cruel insults, you worthless bottle fed whore mouth, Bitch ass pussies. I will challenge anyone of you little cocksuckers and don't say anything about my MOTHER because she's DEAD and the only reason you all talk that way is because you've never had a woman and wouldn't know what to do if you did.  So if you doubt me just go to my face book page and see for yourself. I'm 6ft5 in tall 440 lbs. Played football wrestled and fought with the best biggest and meanest motherfuckers in prison and on the street.   Prove yourself. If not, then crawl back into that hole and continue to live that bed wetting lie you've lived with all your insecure life and make believe you're kicking my ass and fucking my mother.  P.S. I have probably fucked some of your mothers before. Anyone got red hair?  Now go and cry and hate me, whom you've never met and make up some bull shit story that will make yourself feel better.   "
,Rush,2012-07-12T20:43Z,"Decent movie, good underlying message that a lot of us feel everyday. 

If you like this, look-up ""Falling Down"" w/ Michael Douglas made in the early 90's, much better movie with a more realistic story and better production."
