Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::

On the Monday, June 18 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks about Obama's increasingly dictatorial moves to bypass Congress and the American people through executive orders and a bloated federal bureaucracy. He also talks about the Greek elections and the continuing slide of a debt-ridden and bankrupt eurozone into the economic abyss as the globalists take down economies and phase in their world government dictatorship.
