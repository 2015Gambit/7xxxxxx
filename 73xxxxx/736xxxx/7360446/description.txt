Kudo Shinichi is a seventeen year-old high school detective whom people call the 

"Modern Sherlock Holmes." However, one night after a date with his childhood 

sweetheart, Ran, Shinichi witnessed an illegal trade and, caught off his guard, was 

knocked unconscious and fed a drug that was supposed to kill him... but he woke up 

and found himself shrunken to a seven year-old. In order to track down the men who 

did this to him, Shinichi hid his identity and lived with Ran, whose father happened 

to be a hopeless detective, and with that came a series of murders and mysteries 

that he must solve.
