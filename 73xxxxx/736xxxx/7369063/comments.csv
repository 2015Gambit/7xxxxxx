,IroncladMerc,2012-06-20T12:18Z,this one is Faked!
,Gh057man,2012-06-20T18:51Z,Ironcladmerc - just because it is rarĂŠd does not mean it is faked... just stupid and inconvenient
,xpmule,2012-06-20T19:18Z,"am i wrong or 
was he just trying to be funny ?

personally i couldn't care less either way
at least if things are rar'd your more likely to get an authentic un-modified release.

but this is TPB so if you look around
a lot of effort goes into dummy'ing things down for noobs.
For example people that create custom software installers that pre apply a crack/patch etc
Which can be a very bad thing ;)
Besides i don't think people should be using pirated content if their not willing to learn how to deal with it.
Learn what a rar file is.
Learn how to double click a keygen.
Learn how to copy a program to your drive.
Learn how to create a short cut to the program you just copied
or
Post angry and violent mouthy comments
(the standard idiot noob routine)"
,Gh057man,2012-06-21T01:48Z,"My sentiments exactly xpmule.

As I understand it - the uploader has used segmented files because of their uploading limitations. A rar is more practical for the uploader and assures downloaders will receive whole and uncorrupted date (ie. the whole file).  My problem with rared data however, is they they take up twice as much room and require extra handling.

Further, I'm sure many downloaders extract the compressed files and them delete them - because of space limitations and redundancy issues (not me :)). 

How many seeders do these file types lose for this reason?. The majority .. I suspect. 

BTW Ironcladmerc - I can now say that this is definitely not fake. Now go back in ya hole spankwad. (steps down from soapbox...)"
,Gh057man,2012-06-21T01:57Z,Ooops .... I have to admit I missed that joke. Xpmule - I thought you meant he was being pain in the ass funny - not funny ha ha. He assigned this episode as 'faked' because the show is fact or faked. :) Apologies sir. If you were cracking a funny I will slap myself senseless for five minutes upon confirmation of such!
,lotg4me,2012-06-22T00:46Z,I can't Get this to play with VLC. Any suggestions?
