It is the same arabic hard-subbed copy that has been floating around, but with the missing scenes spliced in. 

Strangely, its audio is both dubbed over with Indian (my guess) and out of sync (behind by about 4 seconds). 

This is basically an .mkv conversion reupload with a new, nonenglish track. If you're an english speaker, just get tykoon123's copy."

and surely audio is not out of sync ... reason you saying out of sync is probably (of course) you dont understand it...."
