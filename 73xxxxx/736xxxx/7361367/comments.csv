I've got uTorrent v3. When I click on the magnet torrent link it opens uTorrent and it usually posts the name of the torrent (e.g. ""TTC Video - Before 1776"") but it always posts zero files in the torrent.

I've tried on several of your uploads and other people's uploads with the same results.

I searched uTorrents forum and, as suggested to another user, I cut-n-pasted the links directly into uTorrent. Didn't work.

Any idea how to fix this?

I really like your uploads and want to download several.

Thanks!"

hi.
Sorry, I have no idea how to fix that. I have issues with torrent clients myself sometimes and usually I ask on the suprbay forum or the alt.bittorrent newsgroup (via groups.google). You might also try other forums dedicated to a particular torrent client. Just post some screenshots of your settings there and ask for help. Usually knowledgeable people are willing to point out things that you might need to modify to get things working."
