,CJUeda,2012-06-18T04:35Z,"In case this torrent doesn't work, I assure you I have all the files to Halo Custom Edition as the title says and CD key validated. So if anyone here who is able to comment can tell me how to properly torrent the Halo Custom Edition folder, feel free to tell me."

,CJUeda,2012-07-02T21:23Z,Glad to know it works :D
,injinius,2012-07-07T12:48Z,"one thing you should do is compress it in an archive, like a .rar or .7z
You can use the free program 7-zip to do such a thing"
,CJUeda,2012-07-15T23:08Z,"@injinius Thanks. Now that I think about it, I have tried compressing it to zip with 7zip and etc. The problem was the file was just to big for my computer to handle compressing it, not the same as having space to hold the actual zip file when done. If that makes sense."
