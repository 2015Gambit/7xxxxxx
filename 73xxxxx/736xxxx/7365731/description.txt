PLEASE NOTE-Nexus 2.3.4 CANNOT use any Expansions until someone decides to fix the bug's with it. (If you have fixed the bugs, Contact me)

Nexus 2.3.4 ONLY works with its default sounds (Excluding Club Sounds Vol.1)
You are better off using Nexus 2.20 if you want to use any expansions at all!


-How to Install Nexus 2.3.4-
Step 1:Download FruityWrapper.dll
Step 2:Replace exisiting FruityWrapper.dll with new one (The one you downloaded)
Step 3:Download ReFX Nexus 2.3.4 Setup
Step 4:Install the Setup to your VST Plugins Folder
Step 5:Download ReFX Nexus Content
Step 6:Mount ISO Image and extract "Nexus Content"
Step 7:Place on DESKTOP and rename to "Nexus Content" if it has a different name other than that
Step 8:(Important)RENAME ANY OTHER OLD NEXUS CONTENT FOLDER'S TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN "Nexus Content" YOU ONLY NEED THE NEW ONE ON YOUR DEKSTOP IF YOU TRY TO USE THE OLD CONTENT IT WILL NOT WORK!
Step 9:Delete any old Synso Protection (If you attempted to install any Nexus other than this, Remove whatever it added to System32 (32 Bit) or SysWOW64 (64 Bit) Usually its something like SYNSOACC.dll, SYNSOEMU,dll, NEXUSCRACK.dll. If you CANNOT find any of these it should work just fine hopefully
Step 10:Run your DAW, Import nexus via Channel>Add One, Have fun!
