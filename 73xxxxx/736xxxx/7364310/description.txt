Plot Nederlands:
Bij aanvang, in de episode "Air",
blijkt dat het Amerikaanse leger in het geheim
een basis gebouwd heeft op een andere planeet,
zodat men het geheim van deze negende Chevron kon ontrafelen
zonder pottenkijkers om zich heen.
Wanneer de basis onder vuur komt te liggen door de Luciaanse Alliantie,
lukt het een groep aanwezige militairen,
wetenschappers en burgers om het enige bruikbare adres te 'draaien'.
Men komt zo uit op een onbekend ruimteschip van de Ouden,
genaamd "Destiny". 


Plot English:
Part 1: When Icarus Base is attacked,
it's inhabitants are forced to flee through the Stargate.
The base was created on a distant planet to take advantage
of a powerful energy supply located there.
Their goal is to try and determine the purpose
of the mysterious ninth symbol of the Stargate,
which they've never been able to lock in. In going through the Stargate,
they are transported not to Earth but to a very old apparently uninhabited spacecraft.
With the group's commander injured,
Lt. Scott and the chief scientist - Dr. Nicholas Rush -
lead the exploration of the craft.
Several areas of the ship have been damaged but it is basically functional.
They are able to learn that they are, in fact, billions of light years from Earth.

Part 2: Tensions rise as the new arrivals explore the ship.
Dr. Rush comes under suspicion with his secretive behavior and attitude.
He determines however that the ship is losing air.
They find a damaged room that is partly exposed to space
but the problem is that the door can only be closed from the inside.
Who is prepared to sacrifice their life for the others?
Once that problem is solved,
Rush determines that the level of carbon dioxide is rising rapidly.
The ship comes out of hyperspace
however near a planet that will have the materials needed to fix the scrubbers.
They are given only 12 hours however to get what they need.
