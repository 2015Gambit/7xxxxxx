Hey great uploads loving the work you and all the others put into this! :) 

I was wondering if you could post game of thrones issue 8 and maybe continue posting that series as it comes out as it doesn't look like anyone is right now? Thanks!"

Thanks to everyone for making this such a friendly place. Other parts of TPB, people start flame wars and constant competition, here under Comics, we have a Utopia of Comic sharing. If you have the money and opportunity please buy independent comics - keep em going!""
I agree with this... I love the fact that I can come in here and get a comic to read on my Fire or just preview it before I run out and buy it. It saved me from wasting money on that new 52 Wonder Woman mess! I can also get older issues from the time I stopped collecting to see what I missed. - Thanks to you all!!"
