 After robbing the local bank, three men - Robert Hightower, William Kearney and Pedro Roca Fuerte - do their best to evade the local Marshall and his posse. In the wilderness, they find an abandoned wagon and a woman who has just given birth. She is is dying and asks the men to take care of her child. The three then decide to do their best by the newborn and set off across the desert to deliver it to safety. Not all will survive and for those who do, jail likely awaits them
