Storyline:
The singing group, The Beatles, at the height of their popularity, made this cartoon of a land pf pepperland that is taken over by the Blue Meanies.
They are recruited by an escapee to come and bring joy (and music) back to the land.
The techniques are quite psychedelic in the cartoons and much care was taken to have the walks and mannerisms of the individual Beatles cartoons match the originals.
