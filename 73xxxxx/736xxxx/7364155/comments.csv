,hardbean,2012-06-19T22:46Z,my norton says it as a trojan in it... whats going on?
,Du2L5r1,2012-07-18T21:31Z,"man, i cant believe this.. only a few hrs ago i was lookin at one of hero's torrents and saw some dude freaking out over a virus notification he'd received after dling a torrent, then installing a cracked program on his system without first killing his AV..i'll cut & paste the punchline for u..when someone cracks/patches a program, theyre basically diverting the flow of data, or even commanding the flow of data away from problematic areas within the software like ""serial registration"" prompts, ""online activation"" etc. Trojans for example,r handy lil data bundles that carry many commands within them, that can be used to divert and disrupt the flow of data within the host program/system...hence the name, Trojan. So its very likely that the *virus* (scared face and dramatic music) that u talk about, is the very thing that is enabling yr cheap ass to play this game for free. lol, the word ""virus"" is a lot scarier than say ""bridge"", ""bypass"", or ""key"" for example, yet they describe the same thing... the problem is u visualise the ""virus"" as some destructive germ, bug, termite creature that infects everything its shadow hits, when its really just a bunch of code that is shaped into a command pathway/structure by a human for good or bad...anyway, do u think he got a blue skull by nuking thousands of home systems, owned by regular people?? lol"
