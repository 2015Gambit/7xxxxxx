I hit the local fair grounds today to see what I could find. After walking around longer than I wanted to I started to think that this day was a bust. Then I spotted Angelica! She was in a rush to get to class but I convinced her to join me for an ice cream cone. When she finished her ice cream I creamed on her face.
