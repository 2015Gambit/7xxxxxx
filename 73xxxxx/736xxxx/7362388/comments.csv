,cinemaniac905,2012-06-18T17:11Z,"can someone please explain to me why AFG has become the only capper and has started capping (for the most part) at EXTREMELY LOW QUALITY...and almost NEVER ripping from the source cap....rather opting for VERY VERY low qual re-encodes?

is this what the scene has become?

cause this shit just isnt cutting it.

anyone interested in forming a TPB based release group for actual decent quality source rips?

if someone is willing to cap and upload source caps (VOB format) then im very willing to rip and upload the rips....RIPPED PROPERLY...so we do not have to settle for this low quality scene garbage any longer.

pretty fucking sad when things are going backwards...and rips from the last 4 years have been BETTER than the ones we are getting now."
,cinemaniac905,2012-06-18T17:12Z,this relates to XVIDS only. as the scene seems no longer to cap from source for these files....despite the obvious fact that there is much more interest in xvid than x264.
,dirtydave99,2012-06-19T08:38Z,Perhaps you could upload your high quality so everyone can compare. xvids are xvids dont bash AFG unless you can do better. watch your free show and shut the fk up. if you dont like it download a HD or different format or pay for it. You sound like a leach.

Clearly you dont take the time to rip those shows so why dont you just watch em on tv or buy the dvd, stupid troll.."
