In a time of magic and mythical beasts, the ominous Dark Castle glows eerily under the full moon.

For centuries, the evil Black Knight has dwelled within these walls, spreading fear over the once peaceful countryside.

All seemed hopeless until one day, a traveler from a faraway land wandered into the peasant village.

He called himself Prince Duncan, and told the townspeople he had come on a quest to vanquish the Black Knight.

Overjoyed that peace might finally be restored to their land, they cheered as Duncan set off toward the castle.

But alas, their hero never returned from his valiant quest.

Tales of his bravery were all that were spoken of Dark Castle for many years.... Until now.

A new hero has arrived, ready to face the perils of the castle and destroy the cruel Black Knight once and for all.
