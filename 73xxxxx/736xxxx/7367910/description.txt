Author Vladimir Kushnir shows you how to use his Safe C++ library, based in part on programming practices developed by the C++ community. YouΓÇÖll not only find recipes for identifying errors during your programΓÇÖs compilation, runtime, and testing phases, youΓÇÖll learn a comprehensive approach for making your C++ code safe and bug-free.

    Get recipes for handling ten different error types, including memory leaks and uninitialized variables
    Discover problems C++ inherited from C, like pointer arithmetic
    Insert temporary and permanent sanity checks to catch errors at runtime
    Apply bug prevention techniques, such as using separate classes for each data type
    Pursue a testing strategy to hunt and fix one bug at a timeΓÇöbefore your code goes into production
