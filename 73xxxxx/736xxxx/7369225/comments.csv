,CrankyAVM,2012-06-21T00:24Z,"Update: just got it running, here's the definitive guide. I'm posting this on all the Lego Batman 2 torrents I can find, keep reposting for the idiots that don't check page 1.

1. Download, obviously

2. Install Alcohol, either from the trial or pirate the full version elsewhere. I had Daemon Tools lite but to play this you need a utility called A.C.I.D. that is installed when you install Alcohol 120%. MAKE SURE TO SELECT the option to install A.C.I.D. when installing Alcohol!! I went ahead and did the whole thing with Alcohol and it worked fine. I'm sure you could do it with DT Lite and then A.C.I.D. though

3. Might have to reboot after installing Alcohol, do that and then mount the mdf file with Alcohol/DT. 

4. Launch A.C.I.D. from the start menu, hit ""cloak"" and wait for some kind of confirmation message in the log.

5. Run the installer from the mounted image, install as usual. 

6. Play. NOTE: Because of securom the image has to be mounted and ""cloaked"" with ACID whenever you want to play, not just when you're installing. Otherwise you'll get a message telling you to insert the disc whenever you try to play.

Keep reposting this"

,1gam3r,2012-06-21T02:38Z,"Here. Let me clear it up since they fail to tell you exactly HOW to run the game. Follow CrankyAVM's steps until you get to the fourth step, which is when you cloak it using the A.C.I.D.program. Run the game from the DESKTOP! You should have the lego batman 2 icon on the desktop after you installed it. It will work then!!"
,CrankyAVM,2012-06-21T15:31Z,"Oh, yeah, good call, forgot about that. The game might not install a desktop shortcut for you; just copy from the install directory and you're good to go."
,4454,2012-06-21T15:49Z,"Please help!?
When I've cloaked in a.c.i.d and want to exit the program it says: Terminating A.C.I.D will also disable its device cloaking features.

So what to do? I can't install the game either in the installer?? "
,4454,2012-06-21T17:26Z,And when I try to install the game from the windows installer it says it's not a valid product!?

,nickoboco,2012-06-21T23:16Z,"Works perfectly!
Just download this Alcohol:

Install and then Mount the game Image, go to A.C.I.D Wizard ckick on Cloak, minimize, and install the game. "
