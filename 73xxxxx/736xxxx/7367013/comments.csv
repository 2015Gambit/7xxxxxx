,Petiscator,2012-06-19T19:29Z,"Thank you a lot! I was really looking forward to it, hope it works.

One question, though: I have the base game already, pirate version, with all the pirated DLC. Is this torrent going to replace my base game as well? In the description it says it includes the DLC - which, as said above, I already have.

Thank you again! Found it one minute after it was posted =) Gonna play as the Dutch for the first time =D"
,Petiscator,2012-06-19T19:33Z,"Thank you, I was really looking forward to it.

One question, though: I already have the base game (pirate version), with all the DLCs already released, also pirated.

Also, since there is some confusion in the comments, as I understand it this is the full Civilization 5 Game of the Year edition(which includes all DLCs except Wonders and Explorers), with the addition of those 2 along with the Gods & Kings expansion.

Also, any chance for an expansion-only torrent? :P I saw a release of it floating arround on other p2p sites but no torrents."

A lot of Civ 5 copies floating around out there are just copies of pre-installed games. It's possibly you have someone else's config file. I would try hunting it down and deleting it, or failing that, change every single option inside the game, exit, restart, and see if it still happens."

Attention: un-checking Babylon DLC in in-game menu isn't enough. 

Do it manually. Delete DLC_Deluxe directory in  Sid Meier's Civilization V  assets  DLC 

You won't be able to play Babylon but you'll be able to play every other Civ, including new ones, of course. After I did this, I get no errors, both in-game and in Civilopedia. 

Loaded every new Civ just to make sure. It's all good. Acceptable until fixed expansion comes out. 

Cheers! 

P.S. I used this expansion only upload

Babylon Fix:
(Credit goes to cheftex) http://shrib.com/B2oCeuOj?ajax=1&redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fshrib.com%2FB2oCeuOj

Make sure to insert the code right above the  at the bottom of Babylon's Civ5pkg file, found at ""Civilization VassetsDLCDLC_DeluxeBabylon.Civ5Pkg""

If you want an example as to where this text goes or why the Babylon DLC won't work, look at one of the other .Civ5pkg files in the other dlc folders (the difference is pretty clear).

As far as I know, there is, as of now, no solution to the mod browser crashing.

This version works entirely on its own, not needing any other installations of Civ V to work.

Read the advisor's hints carefully. Don't just click ""continue"" (or whatever the button says) without reading.

In order to find a religion you cannot only pick the religion. You also have to pick bonuses for the founder of the religion and for the follower. Only then you can find a religious system.

,Light365,2012-07-08T02:32Z,"I just redownloaded the torrent and only did the setup, but the game still crashes as soon as I try to play.  If anybody figures it out please post whats going wrong"
,ty2k,2012-07-08T03:33Z,"A summary of the past 9 pages of comments for the people having problems with this torrent:


- The song that plays during setup.exe is ""Strobe"" by Deadmau5.

- The setup.exe file will not run properly with most antivirus software running. Disable your antivirus and then run setup. ""But my antivirus detects a trojan"" - welcome to the Internet.

- There is no need to unpack or mount the .bin files in this torrent, as setup.exe deals with them. Just run setup.exe.

- Run setup.exe. If you get a black window with ""Cracked and Packed by REVOLT"" at the bottom, press Enter to begin the installation. You can view the progress on your taskbar, as the button for setup.exe will fill with green as it installs.

- After a successful install, you should patch the bugs in this particular release by using the 3DM patch found here: http://www.peejeshare.com/files/362349689/3DMGAME-Sid.Meiers.Civilization.V.v1.0.1.674.Incl.Gods.and.Kings.Crack.Fix1-3DM.7z.html

The .7z file can be opened with the excellent, open source 7-Zip: http://www.7-zip.org/

Copy the files from the patch into your game directory (C:Program Files (x86)GamesCivilization.V.GOTY.incl.Gods.and.Kings by default). Overwrite the existing files to apply the patch.

This patch fixes problems with the Babylonian texture not displaying and other things.  

- Run the game. If you get this error:

 ""The program can't start because d3dx9_42.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""

Then install or re-install DirectX from Microsoft: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35

- If you get errors with save games not loading, make sure the path for saving games does not contain non-ASCII characters.

- This is an English release.


Happy playing!"

I'm having the same problem despite installing Jcracken's patch. Before installing the patch the game would immediately crash as soon as I clicked Mods. Now I can click Mods and it will open the Mods menu, but the menu remains completely frozen until I force quit the game. Does anyone know if there's anything else that could cause this to happen?

@rebelegy:

I haven't had any luck finding a working torrent containing all the Civilization V SDK content after downloading several. ModBuddy works, however the World Builder doesn't). Though, as I explained above, I'm having issues with the entire Mod Menu so that might be preventing World Builder from working properly.

I deleted all the files and re-installed this specific torrent with the patch to fix Babylon and Mods. The Mods menu now works and it doesn't freeze, but you can't download mods because the game is not recognized through Steam and when you try to click the button, nothing happens. 

I didn't have this problem with the Skidrow release of the original game, so either the problem is that Gods and Kings requires you to have a Steam copy to download mods OR this specific torrent is missing whatever files make it work properly.

I would imagine you could download mods and put them into the correct folders, but I'm not sure  if you could even enable them in the game browser without solving the Steam recognizing your game problem. I added the game through Steam and it didn't solve the problem."

After you have the file(s) or folders containing the mod, navigate to My Documents > My Games > Civ V. You should have a  folder labeled mods. If you don't, create one and paste the files you downloaded for the mod into it.

Restart the game. The mod should show up under your available mods list in game. It will not show up if you didn't paste it in the right folder or you don't have the crack applied correctly. Enable it. Mine usually takes a while to load, but I've been able to successfully install mods this way.

,knightmare13,2012-08-22T03:30Z,"Civilization v patch v.1.0.1.705
minor Fixes:
[PREVIOUS SAVES]

Older saves with DLC leaders (including Genghis) will no longer ""shift"" when loaded into the patched game.
[CRASH FIXES]

If a user does not have a religion, and receives a religion from another Civ, setting the ""automated faith purchase"" option could previously cause a crash when the purchase tries to fire for either the player, or the AI. This has been corrected.
Fixed an issue where a user could click on a city banner during the AI turn, and the game could crash depending what AI process is happening at the time of the ""click.""
Into the Renaissance - If an AI player has open borders and a friendly relationship with another Civ, they would sometimes send a Great Admiral to park in their city. If the city tries to purchase a civilian unit while the Great Admiral is parked there, the game could crash. This is corrected.
Scenario hang - There was a chance that when you won a scenario, the game could hang. This has been corrected.
Fixed an issue where any user with special characters in their Windows name will be unable to load saves.
If a player has Steam in ""offline mode"", and clicks on Mods, into the modding area and then backs out, the game could crash. This is now corrected.
Game Hang on turn 0 - After patching, many have reported being unable to interact with units or end the first turn. This is now corrected.
Game could previously hang on ""Unit Needs Orders"" after the player clicks next turn. This has been corrected, and the camera snap has been fixed.
A crash that could occur in Hot Seat if the game core threading had been disabled is fixed.
[BUG FIXES]

Fall of Rome Scenario - Golden Ages were switched to providing bonus culture earlier in project. We've removed the culture bonus from Golden Ages for the scenario.
Open Borders that do not exist - If the AI is trying to renew an open borders agreement, but has something more important to talk about in the queue, the system would still record the Open Borders agreement as being active (even though it is not actually in place). This has been corrected.
Military Caste (+2 culture from garrison) was not working correctly. Whenever a civilian unit embarks, bulbs, or is deleted, it subtracted 2 culture, and kept adding up each time this happened, leaving the city at permanent negative culture. This has been corrected.
The ""Peace Loving"" belief was not functioning. This has been corrected.
When cities bombard attacking units, death animations would now play correctly.

,knightmare13,2012-08-22T03:35Z,"before you people say it does have virus..
why don't you first ask the people who downloaded this and could play the game smoothly..
This is crack..so don't expect that your anti-virus will accept this as a..good and best program..
if you don't want viruses...shut the fuck and buy it!!!and no more complains!!"

For those HAVING ISSUES in the INSTALLATION:

Make sure you disable your antivirus and it is running as Admin."
,Jansen88,2012-08-23T13:14Z,"Working flawlessly on:
Win7 x64 Pro SP1
Intel C2D E8400 stock 3.0Ghz
4Gb RAM
Geforce GTX 460 1Gb latest drivers
even on laptop i3 2210, 4GB, GTX 525M 1GB, Win7 x64 Pro SP1.

I had played few LAN games with friend without any problems, also work through VPN but if inet connection is unstable (high pings, lost packet) or upload is small less then 512 kbps it can drop players (host or client) after 200 turns. As I say through LAN cable is working great.

Just install this ,I suggests not in Program Files but somewhere with shorter path like in D:games becouse many complain about some errors from long install paths. 
And apply 3DMGAME fix from v1.674 to v1.705, most that states v1.705 from 3DGAME are the right ones, find it yourslef, it was posted here like gazzilion times.
