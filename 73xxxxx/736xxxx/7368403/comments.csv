Please help!"
,smrt92,2012-07-27T20:23Z,"Install.

Microsoft .NET Compact Framework 3.5
Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 3.1 
Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 (x64) (I have win7 x64)
Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (The bighuge 200mb version that I snagged from somewhere)

And reinstall DirectX 9.0c from any older video game disc.

That's how I got it to work. Had the same problem where the intro works, but the game autoquits."
