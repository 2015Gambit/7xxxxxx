Long considered a failure since its very brief theatrical release in the late summer of 1980, La Nuit des Traquées has slowly but surely built a small but dedicated group of followers who find it to be among Jean Rollin’s almost great films. Containing perhaps the finest performance Brigitte Lahaie has ever given for the screen, La Nuit des Traquées, or The Night of the Hunted as it is more commonly known, is one of the key if often overlooked films of Rollin’s career. The fact that it is indeed a very flawed work that could have been much more, had budgetary and time constraints not worked against it, makes its pleasures all the more resonate and powerful.
