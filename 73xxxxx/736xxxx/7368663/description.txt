Uproarious World War II farce about the Hotel Sahara. Yvonne DeCarlo and Peter Ustinov as the proprietors, trying to survive the war but sitting in just the right place in the desert that the hotel changes sides depending on how the battle is going that week. The British move in, then out as the Germans move in, then out. Yvonne DeCarlo changes her personality, her wardrobe and her musical numbers to fit whoever the current occupiers happen to be. Hilarious ending has all sides occupying the hotel all at once.
