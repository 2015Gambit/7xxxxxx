,Neraforesta,2012-06-20T03:54Z,Negative Ghostrider. This is the same file as all the others. You know...  the one with the BAD audio. V5/A2.  Kinda bugs that someone would make an entirely different persona to give false props on their own UL. boo that man!

I suspect someone must have sneaked a V8 cam or similar with a tripod. Seemly impossible nowdays. I had hope the other way around, governemnt really like to mind everyone's business nowdays and help the corp."
