,PirateEm,2012-07-25T05:06Z,"Game plays fine.
But I won't say this is a great torrent..

For starters, it seems incredibly shady with the fact that the game has clearly been modified to have a watermark, the installer completely changed, and the lack of comments on these torrents. 
I won't be surprised at all if I picked up a massive virus from this. So far my PC seems to be clean, but I can't be 100% positive. 

Next is.. what the hell? You seriously put a watermark in the game?
Thank God it doesn't show up during gameplay but there's no reason to put a watermark saying NOSTEAM all over it. 

And why can't we log on Steam at the same time?
I've had plenty of torrents of Steam games that gave no issues when having Steam open at the same time.

Due to all that, I don't even feel comfortable with this download on my PC tbh, but I guess it does the job. 
Only reason I didn't buy the game in the first place is because I don't want Securom anywhere near my computer.


If this torrent is seriously legit and just so people can play the game then thanks I guess.
my virus scans aren't picking anything up from it so I'll just hope it's safe..."

,PirateEm,2012-09-18T23:24Z,"Been a couple months and nothing negative came out of it so yeah, totally clean.

Still not a fan of how you put a watermark in the game..

but thanks for the upload :)"
,alcropone,2012-09-19T20:55Z,"the version of exe in here is not 1.2.1.. its 1.1.1, I even downloaded the update patch from nosteam and checked the file version of exe.. its the same within this installer.. but thanks anyway ;D"
