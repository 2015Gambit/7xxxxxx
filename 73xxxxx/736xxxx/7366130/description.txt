Linkin Park-Living Things-2012-BriBerY

Nu-metal stalwarts Linkin Park return with their fifth album, Living Things, a 
more personal effort than their previous releases. Teaming again with Rick Rubin, 
whoΓÇÖs worked on all of their albums since Minutes to Midnight, they continue to 
refine their sound, bringing together all of their individual musical interests 
while using the songwriting instincts theyΓÇÖve honed over the years to create 
something thatΓÇÖs both new and distinctly Linkin Park.
