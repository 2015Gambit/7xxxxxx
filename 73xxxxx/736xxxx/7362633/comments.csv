,mentallyours,2012-06-18T15:00Z," The Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 91-85 Sunday in Game 3 of the NBA Finals at AmericanAirlines Arena.

The Heat lead the series 2-1.

Forward LeBron James led Miami with 29 points and 14 rebounds, as the Heat rallied from a 10-point, third-quarter deficit to capture the victory. Guard Dwyane Wade added 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists.

The Heat won despite shooting just 37 percent from the field, but they made up for the difference at the foul line, making 31 of 35 free throws.

The Thunder were led by Kevin Durant's 25 points and six rebounds"
,otnemem,2012-06-18T21:06Z,"mentallyours is retarded.

mentallyours does not grasp the idea that most people who are downloading this make it a point not to know the final score before they actually watch the game for the first time.

mentallyours is, as such, a spoiler idiot.


Great article this one too."
