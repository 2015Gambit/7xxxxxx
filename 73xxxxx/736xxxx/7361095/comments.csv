,brega10,2012-06-25T05:51Z,Hello... it's been a week and I'm still stuck at 69.8%  Please seed this torrent.  This looks like fascinating material.
,brownsthenewblack,2012-06-28T03:23Z,please seed. every1 seems to be stuck around the 72% mark!
,squirp,2012-07-11T00:04Z,"Wouldn't it be nice if the original seeders would seed this collection for a couple of hours more so we could get the rest of this interesting material?

This is the only submission by Armond471 so maybe he didn't read the FAQ's provided by Pirate Bay about seeding and uploading material."
,squirp,2012-07-30T16:56Z,Now at 75.6%
,hotdog159,2012-08-31T03:07Z,"Guys I got the torrent up to 97%. Found some stuff elsewhere. First read ""works of the artrecomended reading->Sources for the Arts.docx"" for more stuff. oh and be careful with this stuff it isnt just some plain mumbo jumbo."
,hotdog159,2012-08-31T03:10Z,Also. I could probably get this torrent up a few more % but I'm too lazy to search for all the texts. Oh and this looks interesting http://www.scribd.com/doc/6540045/Ellis-The-Assault-on-Reality
