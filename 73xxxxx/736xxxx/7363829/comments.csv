[T],drock232,2012-09-09T21:49Z,I will either today or the next.
[T],drock232,2012-09-12T05:23Z,"I have it, but just to make sure do you want the new 2011 version or the Hindi or whatever version I'm not sure if it is the new 2011 version. I just do know it is labeled Kumare and it's a documentary."
[T],drock232,2012-09-17T07:30Z,"Until people actually start seeding my torrent's I won't upload anymore. I have about 20 more to upload including a blu-ray which I am going to start doing blu-ray rips. Until all my recent torrent are at 100%. I am also uploading to a speed of 105/20mbps next month. (October 2012) Oh and all of my newer torrent's will be ripped with DVD Decrepter and Autogk, because I reviewed some of my past torrent's and some people can seem to handle the MP4 format."
