,pliuchkin,2012-06-19T19:22Z,You don't need to put the Preview of the game on the torrent.. The Chapter 1 file takes halt the size of the whole torrent and just have the chapter 1 playable...
,Xes69,2012-06-19T19:48Z,Thanks.
,codexius2,2012-06-19T23:08Z,"are you sure the chapter 1 file is a demo?

The resonance gog page doesnt have this file available, and the official site, its called resonancedemo.exe.

The only reference I can find to this file on google is through this torrent

So ontoita, is this file just a demo? Or is it a chapter of the game?"
,gazulo,2012-06-22T02:55Z,this torrent is the demo...
,elDunge,2012-06-22T18:01Z,"Anyone can clear that up? The torrent contains the demo AND the full game or just the demo? If both, is the demo a different chapter than the full game or is it contained in the full game?"
,gazulo,2012-06-22T21:29Z,i play the two exes in this torrent... and is the same...same as the demo i play before from the wadjeteye page.
,vincexii,2012-06-22T21:44Z,"Hi!  This is the developer of Resonance, Vince Twelve.  I'm glad that you guys are enthusiastic to play the game, even if you are going the torrent route to do so.  I just ask that if you play the game and like it you tell a friend, or at least send me an email letting me know that you liked it!  And maybe you'll like it so much that you'd consider buying a copy.  

Buy it through Wadjet Eye Games and you'll get a DRM free download plus a Steam key for only $10.  That's a pretty good deal right?

Anyways, I worked on this game for five years, paid for all the art and music out of my own pocket, and would like to make more games like it.  So, if you'd like to support small indie developers like me, please consider buying the game or at least sending me an email to cheer on my efforts.  Thank you!  Enjoy the game!"
,vincexii,2012-06-22T21:45Z,P.S. you can find my email on my website http://xiigames.com

,XxXMetalGearXxX,2012-06-23T23:44Z,0/10 would not pirate
,vincexii,2012-06-24T01:53Z,"I wouldn't pirate it either.  I'd buy it.  I promise that if you do, my next game will have more dinosaurs."
,ahoi1,2012-06-24T21:00Z,Any chance for a steam release?
,vincexii,2012-06-26T15:31Z,Buy it from Wadjet Eye Games now and you'll get a DRM free download PLUS a Steam key (steam key will unlock the game and be playable immediately).  It will be available on the Steam store in July.
,JuggernautOfWar,2012-07-29T19:31Z,Wow it's really cool seeing a developer on here. I promise I will try it out using the torrent and if I really like the beginning of the game I will buy it from Steam. Sorry but money is really tight right now.
,logicdude,2012-08-08T04:48Z,"I can confirm, in this torrent is the demo (the chapter 1 file), extra content, and full DRM-free installer for the game."
,logicdude,2012-08-08T04:55Z,"However, I would reccomend purchasing the game to support this awesome game developer!"
,elbastardo8888,2012-08-08T21:45Z,"I also like seeing the developer on here.  Shows that even if you don't agree with it, you accept that people do this and you came here respectfully.  I usually use torrents as a way to ""test out"" a game before buying it although admittedly I buy few games (no job).  Totally spending the $10 to support a cool guy assuming the story is as good as I've heard.  Good luck!"
