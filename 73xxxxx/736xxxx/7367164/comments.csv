,wallitch,2012-06-19T20:04Z,What version of game is this??
,lorddnet,2012-06-19T20:35Z,"All this torrents with update9 is version 1.6.89.0.6 and all this patches cause some weird errors. One of them stops pickpocket skill form leveling, can you imagine that?
Its time to fall in love with that shit called Steam (as you know, there is thin line between love & hate) :P

P.S. Sorry for my terrible english. ;)"
,SirReaper,2012-06-19T21:35Z,"So whats the difference between this and the other upload you made scene4all ?
kinda lost here lol"
,WILD4LIFE,2012-06-20T07:54Z,"Yes I'd like to know what SirReaper asked above. I downloaded the P2P version from the same uploader. Do I need to download this one as well?

What's the difference between this one & the P2P version. PLZ ANSWER!!!"
,nipunb,2012-06-20T09:19Z,"I don't think there's any difference between the two, both are Update 9 to the game and are of same size ..
most probably, the only difference is the crack used in the update, this one has Reloaded's crack and other one had P2P's crack....
personally, i prefer Reloaded over P2P, so I was waiting for the Reloaded's update 9, gonna try it now..."

I remedied this by deleting the ini, and render, texts from my profiles games folder. Rerun the launcher, select your options, and then disable the gamepad option in the newly generated SkyrimPrefs.ini.

you lack in education...

Yes you can receive letters from your ISP about torrenting, your ISP does keep your internet ""history"" on file some for a month or two, some for a year
if you don't believe me then look it up

BUT your ISP doesn't give out your personal info to those who are sending those letters, the letter you get is just forwarded to you from your ISP because they are being harassed by other companies...but your information says with your ISP.

obtain an education before speaking on matters that you do not know about

,chuckdm,2012-08-15T17:48Z,"A small word of caution...

If you are using any Skyrim mods that rework the skill trees (SkyRe in particular) it will conflict with some of the new trees from Dawnguard.  Also, the mounted combat isn't all bad, but it makes enemies that much harder, and will also conflict with Better Horses.  All in all, Dawnguard is probably worth getting, but if you use mods heavily, maybe not.

Why am I posting this here?  Because if you're not getting Dawnguard, this is the first and last update you should apply to Skyrim!  Even if you don't intend to get Dawnguard, heavy mod users should avoid update 10 because many of the AI routines added with Dawnguard are ACTUALLY in the patch itself, meaning that the patch, if installed without Dawnguard, will cause some strange AI bugs (i.e. enemies waiting on mounted combat support that never comes, etc.)

Personally I have spent many days on end now and still barely completed 4 of the quest lines, so I'm keeping my mods and holding off on Dawnguard for a while."
