My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult - I See Good Spirits and I See Bad Spirits(2004 Reissue)

Classic first studio album by Industrial-sleaze pioneers my Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. Released in 1988 on Wax Trax! records (Wax 056), virtually simultaneous with another EP, Some Have to Dance, Some Have to Kill (Wax 055). 
Their sound was initially an amalgam of heavy dance rhythms, horror film sampling, and quasi-Satanic imagery. Their early recordings were extremely popular in industrial dance clubs. A music video was released for the song, "...And This is What the Devil Does!", and appears on The Kult Kollection DVD. 

In 2004, the album was remastered and reissued with three bonus tracks featuring two live tracks recorded on October 28, 1988 at The Riviera, Chicago.
