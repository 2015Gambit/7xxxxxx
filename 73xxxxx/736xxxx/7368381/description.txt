[/b]

Set in land where common physics apply, but everything else looks different. You are Tiny, a technophile guy with a ray cutter, a gripping-device and a fine attitude towards the world. But now your nemesis Big again stole the only heritage your grandpa left you: A nice pair of white, fine rib underpants! And heΓÇÿs surely up to no good, why else would he take them to that forsaken desertΓÇª Where noone goes! So load up that selfmade raygun and rope device (snitched from the local hardware store) and take your annoying and jabbering backpack to accompany you. ItΓÇÿs always been good use to your gramps. Besides, the robot taxi to the desert is waiting! Run, jump, drag, shove and laser your way through the ultimately ancient scenery, gain back 
those underpants!
