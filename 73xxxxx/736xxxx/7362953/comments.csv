when you see all my files in a bundle your see it so much easier to read
if not then change the view on your darn win 7 or xp folders
and make the fields longer..

how lame calling a file

S01E01.corrupted.xvid.avi

when mine is better S01E01.xvid-[ Corrupted ][ date ].avi

as how do you know if thats a tilte and no a bad file?

another exmaple s01e01.1.1.2.xvid.avi

when mine was s01e01,xvid-[ 1+1=2 ][ date ].avi

another example

season roll backs.. espc for storage hunters..

S02E01 when it should be S03E01

now you dont know S02E01 is the new upload or not now
cos theres no darn date in t he AVI name

no one is forcing you to download my rips"
,chris-w1981,2012-06-19T22:25Z,thanks heaps been waiting for the rest of the seasons 
[V],psspss,2012-07-02T09:19Z,"note some cappers are calling it season 2

which no confuses the fuck out of things.. some
asrent sure if its a new episode or last years one"
[V],psspss,2012-08-06T09:45Z,"SEEMS these are season 2 I renamed them
S03 as the roll back confused people and the naming wasnt known for sure at this time

you will need to merge the S01 and S02 together
"
[V],psspss,2012-08-06T09:47Z,"I found out 

E09 was really E00 in S01 collection
and the S02 bundle E10 was E09
and E10 is missing
and E19 is E20 and E20 is E21
making E19 missing
"
[V],psspss,2012-08-06T09:48Z,"which you can get those from the S01 complete
bundle which is now uploaded to save you re-downloading the lot you just have to rename a few and grab a few"
