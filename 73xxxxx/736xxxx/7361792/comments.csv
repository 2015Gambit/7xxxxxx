,tomt7898,2012-06-18T14:53Z,"how this network gets the $$ to produce such SHIT is beyond me,, not worth the  tv time"
,sudopinion,2012-06-18T22:47Z,"The fact that this ""movie"" is at the top of the torrents is mind-boggling.  I'm calling this artificially inflated.  Dune was the ONLY good movie to come from the sci-fi channel."
,tommyhawkster,2012-06-19T07:31Z,"You know, I'm grateful for the work of up-loaders, rippers, etc but I have to say, and this is only my personal opinion, that there has been some real SHIT uploaded on thepiratebay as of late.  Leechers gobble it up cause its a new title but it doesn't take long before it ends up in the black whole of ""who gives a fuck"" movies.  It seems like the up-loaders are trying to meet some sort of quota to keep their reputation up.  Want to upload a movie?  How about finding a great older movie that has been re-released in a better quality format?  Movies like ""Piranhaconda"" are simply sores in an otherwise wonderful set-up.    "
,DoomTra1n,2012-06-19T10:45Z,"LOL, awesome, I love watching these cheesy movies from time to time.

Some bitches take their movies too seriously , even when it doesn't effect them whatsoever lmfao. Thanks for the upload ;)"
,daveydean1,2012-06-19T11:44Z,sounds a bit fishy this one..

that really hurts man"
,bigfoot45,2012-06-20T06:22Z,I'm LOL'ing hard that someone actually wasted their time ripping and uploading this shit. SyFy original movies are hilariously awful. 
,killermany,2012-06-20T21:07Z,that would be one piranha + one anaconda = one piranhaconda? imfao :D
,killermany,2012-06-20T21:09Z,A/V ? anyone?
,ghostrx,2012-07-15T22:20Z,Thanks!
,Panthagerus,2012-09-20T16:10Z,"this movie is so awesome! I created a profile just to prove to earlier commentors that I am sure the people that have gotten this movie didnt just get it because it was new, but because this is serious entertainment friends. thanks for the upload 4all!"
