The book contains 400 clinical-vignette-style questions covering the
basic sciences and assembled based on the published content outline for
the USMLE Step 1. The questions are divided into eight blocks of 50 questions.
As on the Step 1 exam, each block tests the examinee in all basic science
areas. Halfway through each block, a stopwatch set at 30 minutes is
included to remind the examinee of the one-hour limit. Answers are in the
second half of the book. Each answer is accompanied by a concise but
comprehensive explanation and is referenced to a key textbook and/or
journal article for further reading.
