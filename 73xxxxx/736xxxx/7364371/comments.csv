@bookworm4400:
If you created this torrent just for a single recipient, why didn't you just email the .torrent file to him, instead of posting this here for tens of millions of people to see?"
,bookworm4400,2012-07-09T23:27Z,The recipient and I use an email server which flags the use of .torrent attachments.  To avoid this issue I posted the link to thepiratebay.  The content of the file is not sensitive at all.  If its downloaded by someone other than the intended it does no harm.
