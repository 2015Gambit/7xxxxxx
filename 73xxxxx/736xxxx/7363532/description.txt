About the artist:
Martyn Bennett (February 17, 1971 ΓÇô January 30, 2005) was a Scottish musician who was born in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. He was influential in the evolution of modern Celtic fusion, a blending of traditional Celtic and modern music.

He began playing the Great Highland Bagpipes at the age of 10, and by the time he was 12 he was winning prizes at piping competitions in Scotland. 
In 1996, Bennett released his first self-titled album on Eclectic Records. In 1998 he released Bothy Culture, his most successful album. In 2000, just a few months after a highly acclaimed headlining set at the Cambridge Folk Festival, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

About this torrent:
I decided to upload this after my long search for these four CDs in original. It seems impossible to get my hands on all of them, I still don't have a original copy of Hardland. 
So this torrent is here to make these CDs available to more people. But as always: if you like the music please buy it if you're able to! Again, I also experienced that this can be quite difficult.

The albums:
1996 - Martyn Bennett
1997 - Bothy Culture
2000 - Hardland
2003 - Grit

All in ~265 kbps VBR MP3. Only thing missing are proper illustrations for Hardland.

This is my first torrent, feedback is always welcome. Enjoy!
