updated 23,97 fps playback to 30 fps playback due to a synchronisation's problem
between video and sound due to the true High Bitrate of our DTS 5.1 reaching
4096 kbps speed real...
For Orginal 23,97 fps playback,movie got too much lag anyway.
So we made a new release in 25 fps playback that was slightly better than the previous one already.
However we finaly decided to make again an ultimate release in 30 fps playback for get maximum smoothness/flexibility/flow between dialog time/sound delay with the actors/scenes,ect... during movie playback so.
And we decided so to bring and give you this last one.
We get now our first true PreRC1 stage 5 DTS-5.1.720p of our project then.
...
For this seed it will be like this :
BrDrip.720p/30 fps playback/US language only with no sub
complete dialog (and not with Deckard voice over anyway.)
Video codec :
HD Mkv h.264 (MPEG-4 AVC H.264)
2-pass as first pass= fast pass average Bitrate/second pass= Quality based
...
Audio codec :
DTS 5.1/6-channels/48 khz/16 bits/cbr called as :
A_DTS 5.1 1411,2 kbps with a true Bitrate running over 4000 kbps speed.
It's a kind of DTS as hybrid so.
...
But it works,that's all :)
