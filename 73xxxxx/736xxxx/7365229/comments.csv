,badmofo666,2012-06-19T09:17Z,All peers show 0% completion.  Same with the 90mb torrent.  Weird.
,brutal_product,2012-06-19T09:21Z,"seems broken here, too."
[V],neon,2012-06-19T11:47Z,this torrent works fine for me ??
,smltdstry,2012-06-19T12:19Z,"thanx to those who gave up trying :P
we all got bottlenecked most of the night but now alot of people have it and are seeding. 8 minutes in and colbert looks and sounds good (10/10)
daily show and colbert both air at 11 Eastern US time (This is the time zone where most of Americas television airs first).  at about 4 or 5 in the morning the episode is availible on thedailyshowcom colbertnationcom and on hulu if we get bottlenecked again."
,surfm1,2012-06-19T19:53Z,Thanks for AVI/Xvid format!
,Dogger55,2012-06-20T06:59Z,"It finally worked for me, and the quality was great. I don't think the delay was the fault of TVTeam, though, because every other torrent and the official Colbert website had the same problem."
