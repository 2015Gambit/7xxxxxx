,DulceRprt,2012-06-20T04:07Z,"@dynastab2:

This is an instructor's solution manual with complete 3-step identify-execute-solve solutions to every end-of-chapter exercise (both evens and odds).

Here is a random page from Chapter 5:

[V],dynstab2,2012-06-20T11:10Z,"Thanks for your reply and upload of a rare item.

I checked with the textbook and, yes, this is the ISM for the 13th edition of University Physics (calculus based) but the cover, copyright, preface and TOC they put at the front is that of the 9th edition of College Physics (algebra based) by the same authors, so the ""9th vs 13th"" confusion."
,DulceRprt,2012-06-20T11:32Z,"I have no idea why that preface is there then.  I acquired the ebook directly from Pearson so that mistake is on them.  I hadn't scrutinized it in detail because it contains nothing but the title page and (an inaccurate and useless since it's an ebook) index.

I checked several random chapters (5, 19, and 38) for veracity before sharing, but having a seal of approval from someone with more than one upload is always welcome.

[V],dynstab2,2012-06-20T16:48Z,"I am sorry if I left anyone here with the impression that you were the one who made the mistake. From the metadata of the files, several persons worked on this ISM over a period of 2 months, some converting the original Word .doc files to the PDF format and one packaging them at Pearson. Most probably the mismatch was made at this step since they have all the material for the ISM of both books. The most important step to us is your sharing and it is flawless. Again, thank you.
(To get this kind of well-guarded underground stuff directly from Pearson you must be involved in the teaching of Physics in some way, instructor or teaching assistant, not a simple student.)

Click on the sail ship icon at the top of this page and find the site commands at the bottom of the page. Above these, there's a ""How do I download?"" link to some help. Unlike with direct (http:) download sites which pay for their files to be stored at cyberlockers (aka dumpsites) like megauplo*d, fileson*c, wuplo*d,..., the torrent world stores its files on the personal hard disk drives of users (yes torrenters are the ones responsible for the [scattered and multi-copy] warehousing of files and they do it for free). For all this to work you need a protocol of exchange (all users are interconnected) and a small programme (BitTorrent, Âľtorrent,...), some kind of 2-way bit pump, to communicate with others and share files (upload and download). [It's a wee bit more complex than that but for now that's enough. Once you're done with your first download, you can go at about.com and search for ""Torrents 101: How Torrent Downloading Works"" for a not-too-technical 4-part series on torrenting. IMHO, you should go there _before_ going to the TPB How Do I Download? help to get a more accurate and global idea of all this peer-2-peer scheme]"
