why cant you just upload them at 1920x1080p ?

sorry but it is not 1080p whatever you may think its NOT ....

if you can do 1920x800 then why cant you do 1920x1080p ??

@MrStarz the original movie is in the same resolution as this rip.."
,mrod81,2012-05-26T21:56Z,"@ MrStarz

This movie was not recorded at 1920x1080. If you check the technical specs at IMDB you will find that this movie was recorded at 1920x800. So this copy of this movie is 1080p meaning he ripped at full HD. Please do your research before stating incorrect information.. especially when some like YIFY is providing free movies. Thanks YIFY! I appreciate your hard work and dedication. Very happy camper here. :)"
