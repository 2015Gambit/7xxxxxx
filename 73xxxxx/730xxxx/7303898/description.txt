This week's challenge is a food tour of New York! The finalists are split into three teams and will each take a busload of tourists on a tour of three different New York neighborhoods.

How entertaining are they? What landmarks will they highlight? How much food knowledge do they impart?

Then each finalist will have to prepare and serve a dish to the judges based on the research they do in the neighborhoods.
