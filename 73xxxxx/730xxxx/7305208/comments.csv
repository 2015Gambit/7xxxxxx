,buttie78,2012-05-28T15:32Z,Huge thanks for your work so far. Do you plan to release rest of the series from Bluray source?
[V],meech,2012-05-28T17:15Z,"I wish I could.  I will be releasing seasons 5 & 6 in x264 high quality video, 5.1 audio.  But unfortunately I don't have access to the bluray discs for these seasons.

I do have access and will be uploading 720p bluray/dts versions of the rest of the season 4 specials (The Waters of Mars, The End of Time - Part 1 and The End of Time - Part 2).

There is another torrent that has HD (bluray or HDTV, I can't remember) versions of seasons 5 & 6.  I downloaded and watched them myself and they were pretty good quality.  So at least they are out there somewhere."
,revolver75,2012-05-28T20:30Z,ye this one is a little off picture quality wise audio is awsome tho i have a 720p web-dl of this slightly higher bitrate but clearly better pic quality somthings a little off pic is less movie like and more real life like backgrounds and things just sit a little off just somthing to look at and compare. think of it as input if you like but realy thx and as i said audio is awsome beats my 384kbps 5.1 hands down i would like to improve on my other s4 specials and im all for you putting them up and would be thankfull but could you try to look into what i mentioned look at around 11min mark in the desert and try compare with another and should c what i mean just input to help you im not trying to be an ass.
[V],meech,2012-05-28T23:20Z,"Sorry, if there is something different going on, I don't think I'd be able to do much about it.  If you look at my encoding settings, you shouldn't see anything really off.  They are pretty standard high profile x264 settings.  Perhaps it is the source that is different and that is causing what you see.  These are from the ntsc bluray dvds."
,revolver75,2012-05-29T01:31Z,hmm no worries its not huge and i cant think its ntsc over pal i am in the uk but i use htpc so i realy never need to think about that although i do know that you can somtimes get strange playblack from ntsc on a pal dvd player but that was a long time ago hmm oh well maybe some 1 else can add some insight ill d/l waters of mars and compare to my web-dl and see if that effect is still there it is kind of like 120hz frame rate gives that kind of feel anyways thx.
,ili2882,2012-06-06T22:28Z,how about a 480p version of this for those of us on old hardware?
