,cinemaniac905,2012-05-28T16:21Z,"thank you for the better quality xvid, greatly appreciated for us compatibility lovers....not ripped from source, but hey..beggars cant be choosers i guess :P"
,cinemaniac905,2012-05-28T16:26Z,"if anyone has been capping GOT off of TV and wants to upload this season's episodes in DVD/VOB format, i will download them all and rip them into high quality standalone compatible XVID files...the reason the AFG have been so terribly poor is because they are re-encoded (and poorly so) from an x264 rip...im hoping this slightly larger file will increase the quality, but im not entirely sure it will, significantly....if people were ripping from source and NOT encodes, this wouldnt be an effing problem

fuck the scene."
,gianijoker007,2012-05-28T16:34Z,tnx a lot !!! 
,cinemaniac905,2012-05-28T17:23Z,"defintely better quality....but still not great, if possible please rip from source and not encodes, and quality should greatly increase"
,cinemaniac905,2012-05-28T17:25Z,"ok so i came too quick there....no better than AFG rips...problem is def the re-encoding.

ENCODE FROM SOURCE YO!"
,smokert,2012-05-28T18:00Z,thnx! you still da best!
,cinemaniac905,2012-05-28T18:52Z,"actually this is far from the best...this is quite mediocare...unless you have really low standards for quality.

if MGD cared about quality they would rip from a DVD CAPTURE (aka source)...NOT an x264 encode.

re-encodes are fucking garbage, and anyone claiming they care about quality and then re-encode something are either liars or idiots."
,metichi,2012-05-29T01:37Z,thaks for up load.
