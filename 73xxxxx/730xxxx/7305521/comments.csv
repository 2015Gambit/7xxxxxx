,cupressus,2012-05-28T07:53Z,"In Russia, Internet trolls you."
,orangebowl1,2012-05-28T08:47Z,i literally just created an account to say to videlchi72786 that you're an idiot who OBVIOUSLY hasn't read the books. He's doing nothing more than trolling people like you because it's quite obvious to anyone who has read the books that this didn't happen. he does this on many GoT torrents.

,.Leto.,2012-05-28T10:29Z,"lol, don't believe what the spoilers are saying.
About quality this version is actually better than the 1.58Gb one. I've downloaded both and compared them, details are much better and more clearly visible here. Thanks."
,YourUncleRob,2012-05-28T11:44Z,"Just finished downloading.
From what I can see, the video&audio quality is excellent. No subtitles (like stated) and is in English.

Great job and I will help seed."

,mikkel94,2012-05-28T13:58Z,"I like it how Bobby commented about 15mins after the torrent was created, and people still believe that he's watched the episode and is providing spoilers...

At least it keeps the leecher/seeder flame war at bay :)"
,al-mansur,2012-05-28T15:11Z,"Alright guys, first of all these spoilers are fake and the guy wa just mildly trolling (I lol'd) now:

Can anyone CONFIRM the video/audio is fine? A few weeks ago a badly cut version was released and this led to a waste of bandwidth."
,Cursed_You,2012-05-28T15:25Z,videlchi72786 lol joffery doesnt kill jon snow. He's still alive in the last book where he's lord commander of the nights watch.Not joffer though he dies from poison ... oh wait spoiler. sorry.
