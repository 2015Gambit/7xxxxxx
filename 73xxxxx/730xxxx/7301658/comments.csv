I do seed, but how long is long enough - 1 day, 1 week.  Can someone let me know!"

General rule of thumb is always seed back as much as you take.  "
,ockraz,2012-05-28T19:38Z,"@ Gazman76 - It's good manners to seed until the ratio is more than one.  If you look at your torrent client, there should be a display for 'ratio'.  If you don't see it, right click on the bar at the top that says 'Name;Size;Status... etc"" and then put a check next to 'ratio' to get it to show up.  How long it takes to reach 1.0 will depend on the speed of your connection."
