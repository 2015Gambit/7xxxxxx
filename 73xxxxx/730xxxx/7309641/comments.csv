Your welcome and Thanx"
,analien8mycat,2012-05-30T04:16Z,"Thanks for the upload, BBS

BTW, for the .1 percent who are actually interested in the subject, would you happen to have .pdf-s of David Bohm's old tech works available for upload:

Quantum Mechanics (1950)
Special Theory of Relativity (1965)
Undivided Universe - Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory (1993)

He overlays his presentations with interesting  philosophical conjectures and his later 3-worlds theory was prescient."

I don't have ""Quantum Mechanics(1950)

I do have the other 2 plus another one you might want.
