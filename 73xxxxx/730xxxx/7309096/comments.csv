I could not find a free copy of ""Juliette"" anywhere, except in French and Italian (and I spent a lot of time looking), so this is a one of a kind torrent. The only free version of ""Juliette"" in English, as far as I know. I hope you enjoy it. Just pay attention to the warnings. If you are offended, it's not my fault. I think it is one of the most important books ever written because of the views on philosophy it conveys, but it is also sick and disgusting and insane. It is up to you whether to read it or not. You won't find it anywhere else, though."

,antinames,2012-06-21T09:09Z,Very interesting. Have you watched Quills?
,joew771,2012-06-22T00:25Z,"I did see it and thought it was a pretty good movie, though mostly fictional. For instance Madeleine (played by Kate Winslet) was actually 12 or 13 years old and the Marquis was about 70 when they began their affair. Also Coulmier (played by Joachin Phoenix) was actually a hunchback dwarf. Dr. Royer-Collard protested against De Sade being institutionalized unlike the movie which was exactly the opposite."
,ananoymous1,2012-06-27T23:52Z,"Thank you very much for your effort with these torrents. I look forward to reading them. 

Is the movie ""120 days of sodom: Salo"" based on these? That is a messed up movie, lol. But I liked it. Keep up the good work my friend."
,joew771,2012-06-28T13:36Z,"Yes, Salo is based on 120 Days of Sodom. There have been quite a few movies based on him or his works, but none of them compare to the original books. I don't think anyone would actually dare to film an accurate representation of them because they would probably be arrested immediately."
,joew771,2012-06-29T12:46Z,"I must reiterate that these books are not for everyone, or anyone for that matter. If you saw a movie and then you think you can read these because you are so tough now, you are wrong. Without giving too much away, I will give some keywords for these books. Torture, sodomy, murder, rape, necorophilia, pissing, whipping, death, sadism, shitting, cannibalism, and also put ""child"" in front of all of those and you have some idea of what these books contain.  They are awful, yet beautiful. 
Julette is the most extreme example of this insanity, and I assume that most of you will read that first, because you are all demented, though you shouldn't. The Marquis wrote many books and stories before that, that set up his philoshophical ideas. If you insist on reading Juliette first at least read Justine second. There are quite a few books, etc. that I did not include. I wanted to get Juliette out there ASAP. If you like any of these, I suggest that you read all of his works. He is not only sick and insane, but also a brillliant philosopher. If anyone wants more by hin post a message and I will see what I can do."
,wrath012,2012-08-17T01:33Z,This was a good post. Thanks for this. No matter how sick or disturbing a novel may be that's no reason to ban it. I also agree that there is a definitive philosophy and ideology in between the sex and violence in his works.
