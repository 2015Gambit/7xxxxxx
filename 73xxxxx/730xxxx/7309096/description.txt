This is a collection of five works by the Frenchman, Marquis De Sade (2 June 1740 ΓÇô 2 December 1814), plus one book about him from 1899.
They are all in .PDF format.
They include-

Marquis de Sade - Retaliation
Marquis de Sade - Philosophy in the Bedroom
Marquis de Sade - Justine
Marquis de Sade - Juliette
Marquis de Sade - 120 Days of Sodom
Dr Iwan Bloch - Marquis de Sade - His Life and Work

I would suggest that you read them in that order. They increase in vulgarity and length from "Retaliation" to "Juliette". "Justine" and "Juliette" are actually companion books representing two sides of virtue, the "good" and "evil" and the results of both. "120 Days of Sodom" is an unfinished work, due to his imprisonment and then death.

WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

The Marquis De Sade was sent to prison several times (to multiple prisons, multiple times and to the famous Bastille once and again by Napoleon Bonaparte), and to an asylum for writing these books. They are EXTREMELY graphic and not for everyone. I don't mean that there is some X-rated content, I mean that there is stuff here that would get you sent to prison or executed in 2 seconds if you actually did it. Most of this type of writing is in the last two books "Juliette" and "120 Days of Sodom", especially "Juliette", since "120 Days of Sodom" wasn't finished.

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! I repeat, these books are not for everyone. Even you diehard porn fans may not think these are acceptable. They probably aren't, but I wanted to share them with everyone.

The only real justification for these books is that they also put forth a logical philosophical argument interspersed within the horrible vulgarities. These are not only porn and sadism (the root of which is from his name) and violence, but also an actual legitimate philosophy.

WARNING!!!

I just had to put that one more time. These books are like nothing you have ever read, or anything else that has ever been written. I warned you.
