,HylianHal,2012-05-29T12:49Z,"If nobody seeds, I'm not going to waste my time seeding 24/7 just so that my torrent can have just the one seeder. 

So seed, or I won't do anymore torrents."
,Dancer77,2012-05-29T13:08Z,"I don't need this torrent, but I suppose I will seed it for a while"
,HylianHal,2012-05-29T13:20Z,"@Dancer77

Thanks man, I really appreciate it."
,nieri21,2012-05-29T20:50Z,"thanks for this! 

its really cool

i'm gonna seed for a month, maybe more"
,HylianHal,2012-05-29T23:45Z,"@nieri21

That is some god damn fantastic news. 

Also, I just discovered that I can adjust the ration I seed with away from the default, so I'm now at 500%."
,HylianHal,2012-05-30T00:24Z,ratio*
,aoshi_shin,2012-05-30T11:51Z,"Well made torrent!I will seed for a long time,thank you uploader."
,HylianHal,2012-05-31T02:17Z,"Awesome, thanks to all the people seeding; keep it up!"
,Frill_Artist,2012-06-03T15:19Z,What an awesome torrent! Complete collection (to date). It was massive and took a long time to download. We definitely need more people seeding. I will be seeding for a month.
,theapexpredator07,2012-06-06T23:15Z,Fuck! Can you please fix Batman #1 Issue? 
,HylianHal,2012-06-09T08:12Z,"@theapexpredator07

I've got no issues with Batman #1 on my end; what's the issue you're having?"
,nieri21,2012-06-09T20:27Z,"i checked all the batman comics, and so far so good, do not have any problem.

btw im still seeding :D"
,HylianHal,2012-06-10T05:17Z,"@nieri21

Good on ya, mate, I appreciate it.

apexpredator, this might sound stupid, but did the torrent finish leeching before you tried to open it? I've done that a few times, and it makes it seem like the file is either incomplete or corrupted. 

Anyway get back to me when you can so I'll know if there's a legitimate problem I need to look harder for."
,dimitar41,2012-07-03T15:50Z,thanks man i just download it and now im going to seed it for a month.I waited long time for this.thanks

,JJ1551,2012-08-14T05:47Z,Anyone still seeding this? C'mon guys we all need to help out!
,kyrias,2012-08-28T01:34Z,"HylianHal, any chance you could do monthly updates of your DC comics? It'd be an amazingly convenient way to keep up to date with the New 52."
