,alangeezy,2012-05-30T07:09Z,there is no keygen
,minush9,2012-05-30T15:03Z,"if you check the readme.txt follow these instructions 

1. Install the program by executing ‘RS7_UK_Premium_DE.exe’
2. Put the crack ‘rs7_kg.exe’ in the installed program folder.
3. Create a shortcut to the keygen. Open the shortcut properties dialog. In the ""Target"" field after quote insert a space and the serial number, for example, 0449T-F7100 
4. Launch Redshift 7, then startup the keygen using the shortcut created in step 3 which will open a dos cmd window with activation code.
5. Copy the serial and activation code into the appropriate window in Redshift 7. BE SURE TO CHOOSE MANUAL ACTIVATION.
6. Done!"
