[T],tr108,2012-06-01T03:49Z,"@link5a - Neither of those flicks are on my to-do list right now but maybe in August.

@lilsean23 - I normally pull my subs from Subscene but - for whatever reason - they don't have many Spanish subs, so I had to go over to OpenSubtitles.org, it's annoying to find stuff but they seem to have more Spanish subtitles. (In case you don't know - the English subs on DVDs and Blu-rays, the source of most encodes on torrents, have to be converted from image files, then various people translate them in Spanish, French, etc...) How are they subs, btw? Any good?

@12uel - Sorry man. Any leads as to how I can strip/bypass cinavia?"
