CD rip of Jon Young's Advanced Bird Language: Reading the Concentric Rings of Nature

Audio is broken up into more tracks than the old cassette rip torrent, making this a little easier to listen to.

If you like this audio, also look up Jon Young's new book "What the Robin Knows", and considering buying some stuff to support him.
