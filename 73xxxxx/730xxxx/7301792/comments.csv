,Sivos,2012-05-27T06:50Z,"It has the FADE issue like in ARMA 2, so passing the Boot Camp level is nearly impossible.  Hopefully, the fix will come soon.  I downloaded this one and extremezone's, they both have the problem."
,SergioFCPorto,2012-05-28T01:12Z,thanks
,svensken_1999,2012-06-03T12:44Z,Thanks :))) works perfect 
,TekTonix,2012-06-07T15:09Z,"Can confirm this has FADE.
Either wait for someone to bypass FADE, which has never happened for ARMA/ARMA II.
Or just simply avoid this game.
Better off buying if you like ARMA/ARMA II.
And if you buy the mods will come flooding in soon.
Looking forward to some type of Domination CooP like ARMA II OA has :)"
,ivandksd,2012-06-14T02:09Z,Why every one says that fade cant be avoided? I have ARMA 2 and ARMA 2 REINFORCEMENTS working 100% fade free. The only thing you need is a perfect copy of the disc (since the setup checks that it has not been modified) and proper serial. Then you have to ensure to never try to play online and some say that is better to block the game's Internet access in the firewall. The real problem always have been updating the game which was solved whit a key gen. Since then you can play any ARMA 2 release totally fade free. so: PERFECT COPY + CD KEY = FADE FREE!!    
,ivandksd,2012-06-16T04:25Z,If fade is activated it maybe because the installer detects the program that mounts the game image (daemon tools most usually). To avoid this you should try the guide in this torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6433693 (it is for ARMA 2 REINFORCEMENTS but should work for this to). Look for the comments also: there are many different ways to fool the detection system but the most used are: 1) use Alcohol 52% + latest version of A.C.I.D. 2) Make the IDE Virtual Drive attach to the a physical IDE Drive (using Daemon Tools Pro or  Virtual CD 10).
,ivandksd,2012-06-17T19:19Z,"I think i know why FADE activates... Skidrow did the same mistake when they released ARMA 2 Reinforcements... For the game to install properly as i said before you need to make an exact copy from the disc, using software like Alcohol 120% or CloneDVD. What is obviously not done right in this release (and in every release so far i think). Why? because the crack is added inside the game image!! so, every time you install the game the setup software makes something like a checksum from the disc and detects that it has been modified. To make a proper copy the DVD should have been cloned and the crack should have been added in another file, or actually there is no need for crack if the copy is properly made. Many people (even the crackers) think that the game is working ok because they try it a little and every thing looks fine; but the problem is that fade not always activates instantly, instead it makes a progressive game degrade making the game experience worst over the time until it is just unplayable...
