Carrie is hospitalised in the wake of the explosion that killed Al Zahrani in the heart of Washington DC. When Saul comes to retrieve her, he discovers her on a manic flight, postulating a-mile-a-minute about Abu Nazir.
Saul finds himself charged with looking after his damaged friend and, by applying his sense of order to Carrie's chaotic theories, unearths what appears to be the heart of the terrorist mastermind's plot.
