,fenris79,2012-05-27T04:55Z,Utter brain fail (or being a dick) putting a spoiler in the title of the torrent so everyone who wants to download it and watch it after the fact gets the result in their face as the top result. Double upload too. Wouldn't be surprised if it's fake either.
,MotleyC,2012-05-27T13:45Z,Yeah Thanks for posting a Eurovision file with the winner in the title Dick. Now everyone who is looking for the final from yesterday will see this file and know who won. What an asshole.

Everybody, including those who don't read the news know that Sweden won the ESC."
,sven_nilsson,2012-06-09T00:46Z,"On normal days we do read news of course, but on the ESC day it is, at least for me, a 100% commitment to avoid any news in order not to know who won, so that I can download it the day after and enjoy it. It is such a disappointment when this strategy fails, and this year it did. Posting a single song from ESC is bad enough, writing 'winner' is worse. Next time please wait at least a week before doing something like this. Thanks for the torrent though."
