,31r1kH4n53n,2012-05-29T22:07Z,Dont download this one... There are no sync between the film and sound... NOT GOOD! :/ I am a big Slash fan and wanted badly to see this... So disappointing..
,gorgio60,2012-05-29T22:42Z,"31r1kH4n53n, you are wrong it plays just fine,i don't know which player you use but my file plays 
nice with VLC 2.0.1 or Media Player Classic,so if somebody else downloaded it and saw it just let us know if it's ok or not."
