This is the best version of Eurovision 2012 with no TV logos, comments overdub, or voting telephones displayed. Excelent quality! Also the show is the best yet, best stage ever!, incredible colour and crispness, lasers and stuff, 50FPS, best camera work!, best performances to date!. 
Also I think that is good thing you cut out the songs recap, and excelent editing at the cut! If anybody wants the Semifinals made by the same person with the same quality, here they are:
