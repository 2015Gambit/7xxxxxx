File: Revenge.S01.Special-From.the.Beginning.HDTV.XviD-AFG"
,wewereborg,2012-06-05T03:15Z,"Excellent, thank you. We are only up to ep 15 in Australia :)"
,Contirio,2012-06-24T09:43Z,"How can you place the special at first and do not specify that the special is the summary of the entire season? I just saw the spoiler of the 22 episodes before seeing the pilot. I am speechless. People, please, the special is the summary of the entire season! Do not even care to download it. I don't even know why it even exists. Good Lord..."
,hullmees,2012-07-04T18:05Z,"it's the summary of the first 16 episode not the entire season, but still it is pointless to download it."
,blank8087,2012-07-08T21:05Z,"Summary is a nice finishing touch to the collection, also good for showing someone the series to try to interest them into watching the full series (i.e. partner, friend) I've never seen series, my bestie is a fanatic & I plan to watch summary so i can catch up to where she's at & watch last few eps with her...

I rarely comment on things i leech/seed but after reading the whining criticisms of you lot I couldn't help but think wtf is wrong with ppl these days, you're downloading a FREE series & you want to bitch about a BONUS file.???!?!??! Grow some manners & be thankful we can even download it at all... i bet the ones complaining don't seed after downloading either.. pfft..

On that note - thank you famouz for posting the series, much appreciated! Seeding in return!"
,vampzcore,2012-07-19T15:25Z,thanks!!
,killer995,2012-07-30T14:13Z,seed please
,Flytrap0,2012-09-02T10:42Z,"@blank8087 well spoken... I find it hard to believe how much people whine and complain about something that someone else has worked so hard to get to them, essentially for free.

If you don't like the torrent then do something decent and support the studio by buying the season online from Amazon, iTunes, etc."
,Neon_Splatter,2012-09-13T04:17Z,"Screw all of that... He did not ""Place the special first""... it is in ALPHABETICAL ORDER YOU MORON!!!!!!!!!  AND IT SAYS  ""Special From The Beginning"" IN THE TITLE IF THE VIDEO!!!!!!!! Not S01E01.... idiot"
