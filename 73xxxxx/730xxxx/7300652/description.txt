Emerson Lake and Palmer ΓÇô the Live Broadcasts

This is the holy grail for progressive rock fans. Emerson Lake and Palmer are captured here at the very beginning of a legendary career.

Filmed at the time when the band had only just recorded their ground breaking first album, ELP had to use all of their huge individual creative talents to create a full show. Thats what makes this film so special. Extensive virtuoso playing by Keith Emerson, inventive percussion from Carl Palmer and a bravura performance at the mike by the young Greg Lake make this an essential addition to the collection of any fan of the progressive rock era.

Please enjoy, share and seed :)
