,octoedge,2012-05-26T18:14Z,Each Windows edition is about 2.5 GB - 3 GB . How did you combine the above 6 editions ( 15 - 18 GB ) into mere 3.72 GB ?
[V],ThumperTM,2012-05-26T18:40Z,"Read torrent description... there are 3 editions:
-Windows 7 Ultimate x86 / x64
-Windows 7 Professional x86 / x64
-Windows 7 HomePremium x86 / x64"
,marti-n92,2012-05-27T00:08Z,"Ultimate contains all the lower editions, so it isn't getting bigger by adding Pro and HP to it, but if you add 32 + 64 bit it will get a bit bigger because not all the files are the same in the different versions.

Anyay, nice upload, are there updates integrated ?"
,cawoodie1234,2012-05-27T02:36Z,"My main man ThumperTM, you  did  it again. Thanks dude...great job as always. Two thumbs up! "
,neoxcool,2012-05-27T09:09Z,"Thanks! ThumperTM. By the way, does this have IE9 or is updated with recent microsoft patches? if so, up to what date and finally OS is activated with latest version of DAZ Loader or with some other old cracks? Thanks!"
,neoxcool,2012-05-27T09:20Z,no full info and seems like the same win7 floating here since last year. Maherz's ultimate one is good though. Anyway thanks for your upload. Keep uploading! and uploading! and.... 
,cawoodie1234,2012-05-28T14:29Z,"Just installed W7 Ultimate edition in old home made machine and it works perfectly. In system information, this is SP1/genuine. Thank again ThumperTM, you da man."
,kuttarn,2012-05-28T15:24Z,why is it so few comments?
,afzaldu,2012-05-29T06:31Z,"Downloading...
Is it safe to update after installation?"
,681996,2012-05-29T16:00Z,"Hi

I tested the hashes I assume its md5 and they do not match should I redownload?"
,aarJunn,2012-05-30T07:25Z,"If any1 has already installed it then up-till which date is the Windows updated?
I request some reply from my fellow users.
Thank you."

,nazim12366,2012-06-09T00:04Z,will this work to downgrade from windows 8 release preview and keep my data? my computer cam pre-installed with windows 7 but i don't want to do a system recovery and loose all my data. could someone help me please?
,extracube,2012-06-09T10:43Z,"Nazim, don't you think it would be better to just spend a half a day, copy all of your important files (text, videos, export bookmarks, etc) over to another partition, better yet another hard drive, then detach that hard drive, then just do a clean install?  Sorry, I know nothing about ""down""grading."
,Kazuma88,2012-06-09T17:12Z,"Hey im here again.Finally i downloaded this torrent and scanned it with an anti virus softver and it did not find any viruses

So i can confirm this torrent is virus free.Thank you very much!"

,Lehub,2012-06-13T19:59Z,Is it virus???
,l337m4n,2012-06-14T07:20Z,"^No this is not a virus.^
It worked perfectly and yes all 3 editions are there.
We all had issues with windows 7 a year ago but this copy takes it all away.
No annoying nag screens like i used to have with other versions and it updated immediately.

All you do is get imgburn > write image file to disc > boot from cd and install. Nothing else to do except drivers etc.

This was the easiest windows install ever it's even easier than OEM. Thanks thumps"
,TheDarkyLord,2012-06-14T20:45Z,Does this release contain removeWAT or do I have to download it myself?
,chicali1969,2012-06-15T06:03Z,"Works great!! I upgraded from vista home  premium 32 bit and works perfect. I scanned the files before and after making the iso and it was all virus and trojan free, and the boot time scan said it is clean too! Highly recommended!"
,chicali1969,2012-06-15T06:04Z,Oh almost forgot Thanks Thumper! You are definitely the man buddy!! :D
,tonga88,2012-06-16T00:49Z,"I downloaded and installed this (Clean setup), and everything is working fine.. but on system properties it says:
""2 days until automatic activation. Activate Windows now""
Should i be worried?"
,babu1966,2012-06-17T15:36Z,"MANY THANKS THUMPERDC. THE TORRENT WORKED PERFECTLY. I UPGRADED BY PC FROM VISTA TO WINDOWS 7. IT WAS A CLEAN AND FULLY ACTIVATED INSTALL. SINCE THEN, I HAVE ALSO UPDATED MY WINDOWS 7.

THANKS TO  U ONCE AGAIN!!!!!!!"
,ludexi,2012-06-18T07:06Z,does this have automatic windows updates included also? :D
,noddy81,2012-06-18T13:34Z,"Hi ThumperDC, I installed the win 7 ultimate 64 bit version, during install it automatically activated the key.

After about an hour it suddenly said your cd key is unauthorised and must be updated within 3 days. Any ideas?"
,KreigSr,2012-06-18T15:13Z,"Thanks for you time Thumper. 
Appreciate the upload and will use it this weekend.

Those of you having trouble with key being unauthorized, try DAZ loader and that should take care of things. Here's Thumpers upload of the loader.

,SpoonyOne,2012-06-22T15:32Z,Can I use this disc to re-install windows to factory reset?
,Da-5iddySixx,2012-06-22T19:13Z,"Thanks for this great torrent! After my 7 Home Premium got corrupted I did an install of the 32-bit 7 Ultimate that I had, but half my programs stopped working (of course). 77 updates (and counting) later, still fully activated. Next 11 are being installed right now.

P.S. You don't have to burn the ISO to a DVD if you have a virtual drive (like Alcohol, but all the versions of that on this site are infected). It copies all the installation files before it begins."
,MTeo567,2012-06-22T22:54Z,i will be back soon.

Windows 64bit is installed perfectly fine. I also did an update which was successful. BUT now the Windows Update itself is BLOCKED or something. 

When I go to Windows Update. it says to restart the system.

WindowsUpdate service is very much running."
,Kibu,2012-07-17T03:20Z,"@amvick...

why have you made the same comment on more than one torrent of w7 here on pirate bay? which torrent have you installed and allegedly gives the problem you state?"
,Obsoulete,2012-07-17T08:06Z,Thumper man if I could kiss you I would. I registered on TPB just to write this comment saying thanks. I needed to do a clean sweep on my old computer which was running with windows vista and I did. For everyone who says this is fake or broken...FUCK OFF. This torrent is as clean as a whistle and works like a charm. Thanks again Thumper...You really deserve the credit and I know everyone can agree with me when I say that we truly appreciate your work.

,wazzaa4u,2012-08-02T07:49Z,"Hey guys,
I'm just wondering which updates should I avoid so that windows doesnt check for genuine? I see 2 updates that are unchecked, but are there more?"
,dylanbk,2012-08-05T19:50Z,Great upload. Thanks very much!
,Bonerzz,2012-08-06T22:40Z,"Thumper you are the fucking best, i have installed all updates and my system has stayed genuine :D never even had to use a shitty activator.

@wazzaa4u
I have installed all updates (except the optional language packs) and my system is fine still says genuine. Even though i wouldnt think this would make a difference, you never know; i am using the ultimate x64, if you have a different OS installed then the updates would be different, e.g. the 32 bit updates are different from the 64 bit. So they may differ."
,schennj,2012-08-09T15:57Z,Worked absolutely flawless.  Saved 2 of my computers that were suffering bsod and are up  and running as if brand new.  Thanx So Much !!!

,.Leto.,2012-08-11T04:34Z,"The installation went fine but a lot of strange things are happening on my system. And I never had those problems prior to the installation, when I was still using Windows XP. No idea if it's due to this All Editions package or if it's due to Windows 7 x64 itself. Really annoying though, I'm even considering going back to XP..."
,danwat1234,2012-08-14T02:22Z,"Yeah anyone who experiences the dreaded 'this copy of win7 isn't genuine' screens and the black wallpaper,, you accidentally installed update ' KB971033'. Uninstall it and reactivate windows with the latest version of 'windows loader by daz'.
After this you may have to goto; http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/

to run a troubleshooter app that will reactivate windows ;)"
