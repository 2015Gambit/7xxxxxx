"Good morning,

Pour yourself a good cup of coffee, (with sugar without milk without sugar and or milk or with milk and or without sugar or milk, what ever has your preference) and listen to what I would want you to hear on a morning like this / a sunday morning / on three-cigarettes-before-breakfast-mornings / good mornings / terrible mornings / semi-fresh mornings / mornings on which the light and the warmth of the sun wakes you around 08:28 / mornings on which the light and the warmth of the sun wakes you around 10:17 / mornings on which you wake up by the sound of a screaming cat which was partly (legs, not head) run over by a big truck on the street you live by / too early monday mornings / but maybe most of all, the morning on which you woke up today.

Last month I wrote and recorded a couple of songs which I figured should be on something else than the album, so I made this into an EP, titled:

This morning you got under my skin, I have been sleepwalking ever since"
