THANKS YIFY"
[V],YIFY,2012-05-29T18:43Z,"The only reason we left the Black Bars (instead of cropping them out and making it 1920*800) is because some 3D tv's dont support non 16:9 ratio media.  We only leave the black bars on 3D movies, other wise we crop them out to further save space
"
,lovespiratebay,2012-05-30T00:26Z,Is this cinavia protected like the rest?
,windowsvistas,2012-05-30T06:47Z,"Hi yify

Is the Source Is 3D BLURAY

Because Nothing Popped Out In Cinema, It Looked Like a 2D To 3D Converted Movie

Usually Your Releases Are Top Notch"
,windowsvistas,2012-05-30T06:51Z,"And One More Thing Yify,

IF I Buy Ghost Rider 3D BLURAY Will It Be Full screen When I Play It In Tv Or There Will Be Black Bars On Top & Bottom

I am Asking This As you Mentioned That These Movies Are Not In 16:9 Ratio

Please Explain"
,jmhays09,2012-05-30T09:22Z,"@windowsvistas: The reason that this movie doesn't look as good as the others is because it wasn't actually filmed in 3D it was post production 3D so you were right when you said it looked like a 2D to 3D conversion, but it isn't yify's fault. Several movie studios are tricking people into watching ""so called"" 3D movies that were actually converted now such as clash of the titans."
,windowsvistas,2012-05-30T13:01Z,"@jmhays09 :  Thanks for Your Info.

Yify Rocks"
,FlockOfSheep,2012-05-31T13:45Z,"@YIFY Can you do the 720p version for this movie, please??"
,stathistrex,2012-06-01T13:07Z,YIFY. Sorry my friend but your 3D movies are shit. They aren't 3D. I watch journey 2 in cinema and was excelent 3D but yours is disappointing.
,stathistrex,2012-06-01T13:08Z," It's 2D, no 3D. Iam sure that you are doing something wrong and you destroy it. What a shame!"
,cbkid,2012-06-02T06:36Z,Thanks YIFY! Any chance of you posting clash of the titans in 3d ? Thank you again. Also stathistrex if you can do better go ahead and do it or stfu and be greatful prick.
,trudeau123,2012-06-02T19:56Z,Its a double screen? is there something im missing? wtf. good quaility though.
,jlmsm4e,2012-06-03T01:37Z,Could you upload this in 1080p not 3d?
,OmniusPrime,2012-06-03T18:57Z,"When streaming this to my PS3 for playback on my 3DTV, the audio gets muted after about 20 minutes due to Cinavia protection. Message says playback not authorized for device. "
,princedts,2012-06-04T17:27Z,plz give Audio details / I think it will not be aac or ac3 5.1
,chopped,2012-06-05T09:32Z,Are your 3d movies left or right eye first? (Is the left eye on the left side of the video or vice versa?) Cheers
,kunals69,2012-06-16T02:19Z,"Once again, thank you so so much!!"
,davin_g,2012-06-22T05:26Z,I have a question. All of YIFYs videos are all pixalated after I burn them and watch them on my Samsung Tv. I use visual hub to convert and burn. Is it just his videos are low quality or is there a trick when burning 3d movies because all other movies I burn the quality is fine. TY YIFY...just wondering if I'm the one doing something wrong.
,nishanta_07,2012-06-23T19:06Z,"hey can you please download 3d movies less than 720p, if so we old pc users would also be able to see those movies..."
,tanvir175,2012-06-24T06:01Z,"@ stathistrex Stfu and get a life. You don't like this torrent, please, go make your own. Let's see how you would do it. YIFY you rule bro. "
,fumosi,2012-06-25T04:43Z,"Thank you for the 1080 quality movie. Just came across your torrents YIFY and since than have been downloading them. In this movie I am getting 2 screens inside the VLC media player (movie playing on one monitor only), just like ""trudeau123"" mentioned. How do I get it to show on one screen inside vlc. Is it possible or some conversion is needed. Thanks in advance."
,fumosi,2012-06-30T03:47Z,"Hi, anyone know if it is possible to view 3D HSBS in normal one screen mode. I don't have a 3D tv/monitor, and was hoping i could see this movie in one screen inside VLC on my laptop (no 3D suppport). So is there anyway i could watch this on one full screen instead of 2 side by side screens which are appearing. What do i do? Do i need to convert (i was hoping i would't have to convert and messup with the superb quality which is already present). So is there any way just by adjusting some settings inside VLC whcih would help me view this movie in 2D (one screen) mode."
,coolmurphy,2012-07-06T07:04Z,"lol its in split screen cuz its 3d,well i dont have 3d screen!"
,chopped,2012-07-12T13:03Z,"If anyone wants to watch a SBS 3D movie in 2D. 1, Download NVIDIA 3D Vision Video Player (It is free from the NVIDIA website). 2, Open the Movie in Side by Side mode. 3, Click View -> Viewing Method -> Monoscopic (or press F4)"
,jmhays09,2012-07-20T22:45Z,"First of all I love yifys 3D uploads and the video quality of all their rips. With that being said, I dont understand why more people arent complaining about the audio. I understand that you want to keep a small file size so you use stereo audio instead of surround sound and I am totally ok with that. The problem is that I always have to turn my volume up to 100 on all of these movies just to hear them. Even stereo audio should not be that quiet so there should be a way to have a normal volume but retain your sall filesize. If any other are experiencing these problems please comment back so I know I am not the Only one THANKS YIFY AND PLEASE BOOST VOLUME ON FUTURE RIPS."
