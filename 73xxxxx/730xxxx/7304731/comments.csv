@footy please share us the race from SKY in 768x432"
,1.8turbolader,2012-05-27T22:39Z,Had to register just to say thanks! BBC coverage is much preferred to Sky. 
,deim0n,2012-05-27T22:57Z,"@neingott You have asked on all of his uploads. Be happy he's sharing what he does. I prefer the BBC broadcast, but I take what I can get."
,DrH1,2012-05-27T23:15Z,"I also totally prefer the BBC F1 broadcast. Thank you so much for regular uploads!

May I suggest or ask that you try to limit size of the files? Take a look at what YIFY is doing."
,neingott,2012-05-27T23:39Z,"@deim0n por supuesto que me quedaré con lo que @footy nos comparta, pero él ha subido 4 de las 5 carreras anteriores (bajo tamaño) de SKY, y si no sube la carrera, por supuesto que la bajaré de BBC.

Pero prefiero SKY... XD

@deim0n of course i will get with the @footy share for us, buy he has upload 4 of the 5 previous races (low filesize) from SKY, and if he no upload the race, of course i will download it from BBC.

But I preffer SKY... XD"
,Emab83,2012-05-27T23:57Z,thank you very much and please dont change a thing about what your doing :)
,oldcrank,2012-05-28T00:00Z,"DrH1, Footy also has smaller versions, but I appreciate the resolution.
Thanks again Footy, and if I could state a preference it would be for the BBC's coverage."
,badabingkiki,2012-05-28T00:19Z,Thank you very much for posting the better BBC coverage.
,DrH1,2012-05-28T00:34Z,"@oldcrank, I agree i prefer higher resolution HD as well, but the file size of 5+ GB is just way too large. I see uploaders regularly uploading movies that are 720p and even 1080p that are less than half that file size. Must be a better way of encoding these files so that the files are half the size or even smaller."
,gold444,2012-05-28T00:48Z,"Guys BBC coverage is awesome, but so is SKYF1.

To be honest my preference for the pre and post race bits actually goes to SKYF1! Theirs is so much longer.

We are so spoilt this year it's unbelievable. Eternal thanks to footy, and I do hope he fixes the SKY f1 torrent or at least the pre and post race bits, cos you have to admit SKY's F1 coverage is absolutely awesome as well. "
,SerSpec-V,2012-05-28T02:28Z,Please give us Sky non-HD. Footy usually posts that first but still no sing of it. If I wait to DL one the these HD rips I'll have to shave again :(
,Bali2011,2012-05-28T03:06Z,You're the best!
,frostbite88,2012-05-28T04:27Z,dont forget the race forums thanks!
,geenotreally,2012-05-28T05:57Z,"Thank you, I am sure this one will be exciting."
,beddeebee,2012-05-28T06:59Z,"Thank you footy. We get crap here in the US. you are awesome.
beddeebee"
,keif8,2012-05-28T08:11Z,Fantastic torrent.  Big thanks from the U.S.
,futureshock999,2012-05-28T13:10Z,"Footy - you are absolutely a star.  Your efforts are greatly appreciated to those of us that cannot get a solid connection to iPlayer even with a VPN (I keep tryin').  As an expat who therefore can no longer get the fantastic BBC coverage (Martin Brundle, really?), you are my lifeline.  Muchas gracias senior..."
,revolver75,2012-05-28T16:12Z,"gr8 stuff as usual footy but i have to ask can you add fp3 in hd into future uploads there was a few incidents in fp3 monaco that were talked about and i would have liked to see gr8 quality keep the size imo the bigger the better top quality for my 60"" tv i would also like to see more of 6 channel audio rather than 2ch but still gr8 work m8."
,zed1234,2012-06-01T01:15Z,"For all of those that are wondering why not all the races are broadcasted by BBC here goes an explanation: 

The BBC in 2012 will continue to show live coverage of half of the races in the season: China, Spain, Monaco, Europe, Britain, Belgium, Singapore, Korea, Abu Dhabi, and Brazil. They will also show live coverage of practice and qualifying sessions from those races. For the races that the BBC don't show live, they will show ""extended highlights"" of the race just a few hours after it has been broadcast. 
From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One 

Hope that clarifies some doubts"
,zed1234,2012-06-01T01:16Z,Oh and thanks a lot footy! You are wonderfull!
,gjliolios,2012-06-03T12:12Z,why i cant download the torrent?i cant find it...only magnetic...
