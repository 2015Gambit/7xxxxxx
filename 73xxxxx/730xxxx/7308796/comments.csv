,tomswiftx,2012-05-31T17:50Z,"Ultimate Memory is one program.  The Confidence in Context is a bonus program that is vocabulary building, as I understand it. See http://www.ereflect.com/products.html 

I think, based on the files in the torrent, that your torrent is the vocabulary program, Ultimate Vocabulary, or an older version of it.

If you can get the Ultimate Memory program that would be great."
,tomswiftx,2012-05-31T18:08Z,I take it all back.  It looks like the UM program is the last on the list of files. :-)
