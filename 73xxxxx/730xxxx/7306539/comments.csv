,Supaman94,2012-06-02T07:17Z,"the 'Serial' Codes are as follows:

pick any one of those when installing. before you run the game do the patch or it wont work. also do not download updates from ea"

,noris1994,2012-06-04T01:08Z,como hago alguien que me ayude y me diga x que no me quiere cargar en utorrent!!!!porfa ayudaa
,baileyanne0,2012-06-06T09:00Z,I got the game working and it either freezes (the music will keep running and you can still move the mouse but you can't click anything) or just blacks out with the music running. I don't really know if this is a problem that can be helped but I'd like to know if there's anything I could maybe do or if I'm not the only one with this issue? Thank you!!
,Supaman94,2012-06-06T10:28Z,"what OS are you using? this wasnt a problem with me and i have windows 7 ultimate 64bit. have you tried uninstalling and trying again? make sure you have nothing else open during the instal and try putting your antivirus on silent or gaming mode. or disable it. sometimes it effects game installs.
let me know if this helps at all."
,baileyanne0,2012-06-06T17:53Z,"I too am using Windows 7 (I'm not sure about the bit thing, but it doesn't matter too much right?) I shut off everything I could in McAfee and closed everything, uninstalled, re-cracked and installed, and it still does the same thing I described while making my Sim. I tried taking a different route and making my Sim without much care or detail and bought some land, and it wouldn't let me save correctly or it wouldn't really display correctly at all. I'll try any other suggestions if you've got them. I may just try another torrent. I apologize. But, to show my gratitude, I'll seed, because it is a good and easy-to-use-torrent."
,noris1994,2012-06-07T00:05Z,"someone please tell me when that wing download utorrent says it is denied and no low
help please!!!!!!"
,Supaman94,2012-06-07T00:10Z,"im sorry but i am out of ideas, have you seen on google if anyone else has had this problem? its the first ive heard of it. so its impossible to say really, its just guess work."
,Supaman94,2012-06-07T00:12Z,"@noris1994

do you have the latest version of utorrent?"
,baileyanne0,2012-06-07T01:53Z,"I did look to see if there were similar issues, but nothing quite the same. I'll find something that will work out :) Congrats to everyone else who got/gets it working, and thank you for your time!"
,imtheinvisibleman,2012-06-10T18:11Z,"I'm having a problem. I've installed the game, but when I try running it, it says that it can't confirm that it's a legal copy of the disc. How can I make it believe it is?"
,Supaman94,2012-06-13T16:27Z,"@ imtheinvisibleman

you have to copy the crack. replace the original, then it will work"
,Supaman94,2012-06-16T09:29Z,"keep in mind they are the 'minimum' requirements. it doesnt mean it wont work on windows 7, so don't let that put ya off people"

,PsychoLEPrecon,2012-06-24T10:26Z,"Mounted and installed the game flawlessly. Copied contents of Crack folder to Bin Folder. Ran Final Version Patch then tried to play the game with TS3.exe, game still says cannot verify it is a legal copied. Going to uninstall and try again."
,PsychoLEPrecon,2012-06-24T10:27Z,"Oh, and yes, I am seeding."

,Supaman94,2012-06-25T00:14Z,"@ PsychoLEPrecon
did you try copying the crack after you patched the game?"
,PsychoLEPrecon,2012-06-25T13:52Z,"@Supaman94
I will try that right now, and will resume seeding while I attempt it."
,PsychoLEPrecon,2012-06-25T14:39Z,"@Supaman94
Sorry to bother you with such an easy fix. Works like a charm now. Recommend changing the instructions in the read me file, it might confuse others as it says to copy the files from crack directory and then install the patch. Keep up the good work."
,banhawy,2012-06-25T18:01Z,"For the love of God, why am I still stuck at 99.89% and no one wants to seed??
I personally will seed for 2 weeks when I'm done with this. Please everyone do the same."
,PsychoLEPrecon,2012-06-26T12:33Z,"I always seed until my share ratio reaches 1.00. I am sorry if it is not fast enough, and sometimes my router messes up and I lose connection, but I am seeding every possible moment I am home and can keep an eye on it."

,Supaman94,2012-07-30T10:36Z,"@ el_rf,
to bipass the verification notification, 
copy the TS3.EXE and TSLHost.dll
to the bin folder and replace existing on both.
if this does not fix the problem let me know."
,Supaman94,2012-07-30T10:43Z,"@ savvymaryv,
please try this.
do not click on TS3 Launcher. instead click on the TS3.EXE that you copied from the crack folder. 
the launcher should work if you have done the crack properly. but if not then try this method. let me know if it doesnt work"
,Supaman94,2012-07-30T10:46Z,"@ BrettyBoy_ 
are you trying to copy the file itself? or the contents inside it?

(do not copy the while file ""Crack"",
just copy the TS3.EXE and TSLHost.dll)"
,Supaman94,2012-07-30T10:55Z,"just to be clear, when you open the 'Bin' file. there is another bin file inside of that one/ ..... when copying the crack, PLACE IT IN THE MAIN BIN FOLDER, NOT THE ONE INSIDE OF IT!"

can some help me, my e-mail courtz_2002@hotmail.com, its saying the disc is not a valid copy and to contact customer service, i am new to this please help asap :)"
,Supaman94,2012-08-05T07:23Z,"have you copied the crack files to the 'bin' folder as it says in read me file?
there is an error in the read me i cant change, u are meant to patch the game and then copy the crack into bin folder. once you have done that the game will work."
,sarinalanell,2012-08-10T21:30Z,"I'm stuck at 99.8% and it hasn't moved for hours!!
PLEASE SOMEONE SEED PLEASE!?!?"

,sarinalanell,2012-08-11T09:28Z,I don't know where the Bin file is. It still says that I don't have a verified copy of the game...
,sarinalanell,2012-08-11T09:32Z,"How do I patch the game? Also, I don't have a readme folder."
,Supaman94,2012-08-12T06:22Z,"the read me file should be in the downloaded torrent. also the bin folder is where you installed the game to. if you are using windows and kept it default then it should be in local disc C drive, then program files or program files x86. then you'll find the game in there. most likely under 'EA'.
to patch the game open up the launcher. not the game shortcut. it should have an EA thing that gives u options to play or to install downloads and stuff... open that and theree will be an area to patch. secondly. after you have patched it. then copy the 2 files in the crack folder and paste then into the games Bin Folder and hit replace. then the game is ready to play. so long as you dont patch it again"
,sarinalanell,2012-08-13T22:30Z,"@Superman94
What's the folder name that I have to put the patch it? Also, I still don't know where the readme file is."
