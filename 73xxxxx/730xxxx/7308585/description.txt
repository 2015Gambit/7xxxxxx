with this file you have a linkin park start orb a lp boot screen a lp wallpaper
with the wallpaper you might want to center this one otherwise it looks like crap and also a lp font all the programs are inside this file that you will need to apply these to your pc 

programs:

windows 7 start button changer

windows 7 boot updater

with the font i think you just put the file in your c:/windows/font

if you want to make a lp screen saver just go to screen saver settings type in linkin park make sure you have lp font selected first all this stuff is real easy to figure out
