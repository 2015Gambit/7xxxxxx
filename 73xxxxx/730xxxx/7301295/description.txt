The articles in The Encyclopedia of Medical Devices and Instrumentation focus on what is currently useful or is likely to be useful in future medicine. They answer the question, "What are the branches of medicine and how does technology assist each of them?" Articles focus on the practice of medicine that is assisted by devices, rather than including, for example, the use of drugs to treat disease. The title is the only resource on the market dealing with the subject in encyclopedic detail.
* Accessible to practitioners with a broad range of backgrounds from students to researchers and physicians
* Articles cover the latest developments such as nanotechnology, fiber optics, and signal processing
