,enizer,2012-06-24T14:57Z,"i downloaded this to see if i would like the series, and was planning on downloading the HD version later if i did.
however this is in surprisingly high quality, no compression artifacts, and small file sizes

if the rest is the same as the first episode, then downloading the HD version is a waste of bandwith

hope to see more from you sharips :)"
