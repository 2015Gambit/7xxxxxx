,HylianHal,2012-05-26T17:16Z,"Come now, brothers! I will seed this until the end of days, but I can not do it alone! Lend me your good will, lend me your vigor, and lend me your bandwidth!

Seriously, though- from six seeders to just me again? Some of you've gotta seed, for anyone else to enjoy this."
,SYNYST3R1,2012-05-26T19:05Z,I will seed for a bit today. Can't promise any more than that. Really would like this collection tho
,SYNYST3R1,2012-05-26T19:06Z,Hopefully some seeders build up through the day
,HylianHal,2012-05-26T19:45Z,"Thanks mate, every bit you can contribute is appreciated."
,contatnt1one,2012-05-26T20:52Z,"It may be difficult for you to get seeders for this since these issues are already all out in other popular torrents which people are already seeding. You should wait til those torrents are a little older and at least starting to die out before listing something this big to replace them. I mean that in a friendly way, no offense meant."
,HylianHal,2012-05-26T23:28Z,"@contatnt1one

Mosdef don't want to replace them, I just thought people would appreciate having all of them present to date, if they were just getting into the reboot, like I was. 

Meh it'll be here for now, for whoever can use it."
,HylianHal,2012-05-27T21:31Z,So for those of you who've successfully downloaded it- would you say it's worth it? What do you think?
,idiot00169,2012-05-28T05:01Z,Seed Please!
,HylianHal,2012-05-28T05:46Z,"@idiot00169

I'm seeding 24/7, but nobody else will seed for more than an hour or so. >:/"
,HylianHal,2012-05-28T21:15Z,"Stopping seeding for a while, will resume later tonight."
,idiot00169,2012-05-29T06:07Z,"Has ANYONE been able to download this torrent!?  I've been on it for 2 DAYS and I'm still at 0.0%  So are the other 75 peeps I'm connected to.  HylianHal, a lot of people really want this torrent.You might want to think about re-upping it...its just not working.

Thanks"
,HylianHal,2012-05-29T12:18Z,"I know a few people have, because the number of seeders will increase from one to like three or five for half an hour at a time, and then drop back off when they decide to be pricks and stop seeding. 

I'll consider re-upping sometime tomorrow evening."
,HylianHal,2012-05-30T18:57Z,"New torrent here: 

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7309084/DC_The_New_52_[Re-up]

Still has a pretty crappy SL ratio, so if you're just starting this one, switch over at your own risk."
,ScottyD7421,2012-06-07T11:58Z,"Hi, i'm abit new to this so please forgive my asking but what is the big issue with seeding? I thought seeding was just having it there for others to download, y is that such a problem? what am i missing?

Cheers"

Seeding is what happens when you've already got the file downloaded to your computer; once that happens, you computer automatically begins sending out pieces of the component parts of the file so others can download it. It works by continually uploading small bits of the overall file, while other people continually download those small bits from everybody who's seeding.

When you first make a torrent, you seed it by yourself until somebody else can download it, then the two of you seed it together. Because of the way seeding works, the larger the number of people seeding, the more efficient downloading the torrent is. 

The downside of this is that it's not like it's stored online for anybody to download it until someone removes it- though that is what makes it such an effective pirating tool. But if there are no seeders, if people just stop caring and drop the torrent, then it's dead, and no one can download it. 

Fear not though, if you'll follow the link I posted in a previous comment, I posted a new version of this torrent, which has a great seeding ratio going on, so you should all probably switch over to that. 

And remember, once you've got the file: SEED!"
