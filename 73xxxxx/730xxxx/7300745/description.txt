The first torrent from HylianHal!

Includes every comic released the DC's The New 52 reboot, up to week 37, including the Second Wave. 

Credit goes to both the original scanners for sacrificing their time and energy to get this great stuff on the net (Minutemen, Zone Empire, etc), and to Ichiroyoung/Ichiro89, for uploading The New 52 scans, week by week, as reliably as ever. 

I have not added any original material to this torrent, only resorted and repackaged the scans, organized by comic, for your convenience. 

I'd love to do this every six weeks or so, updating it with each week's new releases, but unfortunately I'm shipping off for Navy RTC next month, so I'll only be able to seed this 'til it gets off of the ground- perhaps when I start my tech training in A School I'll be able to get back on this. 

All comics are either in .cbr or .cbz format- if you've never used either of these, go download CDisplay or Comic Rack, both of which are great programs and extremely easy to use. 

Any comments or criticisms are welcome.

Enjoy!
