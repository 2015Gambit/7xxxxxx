The latest Alea Minerva album, an instrumental jaunt through electronica, rock, classical, chillout and back again. Sometimes dark, sometimes uplifting, sometimes intense but hopefully always interesting, and never quite what you expect. Why $1? Well the way bandcamp works, to have the option of giving it away free I would be limited to only 200 downloads, so at $1 I can have as many as I like, and you're always free to pay a little extra if you feel like it, for that little extra karma.
