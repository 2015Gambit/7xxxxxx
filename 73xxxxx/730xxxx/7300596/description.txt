This innovative how-to resource uses classic and modern techniques to create interesting custom fabrics that are used in a dazzling array of fresh, stylish yet practical must-have items for one’s wardrobe or home. From laptop cases to evening bags, elegant wraps to flirty skirts, floor pillows to whimsical curtains, this tutorial uses a variety of easy fiber-art and fabric-manipulation techniques to create original fabric projects from wearable designs and touching gifts to home décor. In addition to the cloth-making techniques, there are 17 projects that show what can be made with each unique fabric. Additional instruction is included to create unique effects with pleats and crinkles; puckers and tufts; cut-and-fray fabric techniques; laminates that add colorful, versatile, and playful layers; surface embellishment techniques like cording, appliqué, and crazy stitch; heat-treated techniques like burn-out, burn-away, and fabric etching; fabrics designed with solvy and repeating notions like rickrack, hooks and eyes, and zippers—leading to many endless possibilities.
