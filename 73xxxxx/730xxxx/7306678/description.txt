*Almost* every Painkiller Already episode up to 94, missing about 7-10 of them. All episodes have been converted to podcast form (When stop listening to an episode, the next time you listen it will resume playback at the time you stopped listening). It is reccomended that you create a playlist in itunes and put them in there because this is the only music player I have listened to them in.
