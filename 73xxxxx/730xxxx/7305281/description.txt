Show premiered on W Network (Canada) in May 2012
Official names of the episodes appear to be Episode one, Episode two, etc... nothing creative.
I am not sure if W Network broadcasts in HD or not, but my cable carrier doesn't carry it in HD.

Backyard Inventors
Innovation expert Doug Hall travels across Canada in search of everyday inventors with exceptional ideas. His mission is to find and mentor CanadaΓÇÖs next great inventors, taking them on a journey of a lifetime, from the backyard to the boardroom. In each episode, Hall travels to backyards and basements in search of an inventor with an idea that has real potential. The inventor who impresses him the most will be invited to Eureka! Ranch where their invention will be re-worked, re-tooled and turned into a marketable product that they will ultimately pitch to a big business.
