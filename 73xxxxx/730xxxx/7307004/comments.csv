,PAWZ76,2012-06-13T21:11Z,I have to say the subtitle translation is f***ing dreadful! Not a single sentence made any sense. I had to turn off the film a quarter way through because it was just ruining the movie!
,PAWZ76,2012-06-13T21:32Z,"I've searched the net tring to find some decent English subs for this, but they are all the same crappy machine translated garbage, so if you're English and want to see this movie, I would wait till another version comes out with understandable subtitles!"
