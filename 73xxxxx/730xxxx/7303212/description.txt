* Plot :

The intergalactic criminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from the LunarMax prison on Earth's moon, intent on going back in time and killing Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), who on July 16, 1969, had shot off one of his arms and captured him. After investigating a spaceship crash in New York City, and following a skirmish in a Chinese restaurant, K deduces Boris has escaped, and K regrets not having killed him. He returns to his apartment, where all traces of him disappear. Agent J (Will Smith), however, still remembers K, though no one else at Men in Black headquarters does.

Agent O (Emma Thompson), the new Chief after Zed's passing, deduces from J's statements that a fracture has occurred in the space-time continuum. The two realize Boris must have time-jumped to 1969 and killed K, resulting in an imminent invasion of Earth by his race, the Biglodyans, due to the absence of the protective ArcNet device that created a planetary shield around Earth, installed by K in 1969. Through electronic-shop owner Jeffrey Price, son of Boris' cellmate Obadiah Price, who also created the time travel device, J acquires the same time-jump mechanism as Boris. After jumping off the Chrysler Building to reach time travel velocity and being told he has 24 hours to stop Boris, J arrives a day before Boris kills K.
