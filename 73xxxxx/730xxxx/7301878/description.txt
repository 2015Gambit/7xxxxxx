The Meters defined New Orleans funk, not only on their own recordings, but also as the backing band for numerous artists, including many produced by Allen Toussaint. Where the funk of Sly Stone and James Brown was wild, careening, and determinedly urban, The Meters were down-home and earthy. Nearly all of their own recordings were instrumentals, putting the emphasis on the organic and complex rhythms. The syncopated, layered percussion intertwined with the gritty grooves of the guitar and organ, creating a distinctive sound that earned a small, devoted cult during the '70s, including musicians like Paul McCartney and Robert Palmer, both of whom used the group as backing band for recording. Despite their reputation as an extraordinary live band, the Meters never broke into the mainstream, but their sound provided the basis for much of the funk and hip-hop of the '80s and '90s.

50 tracks representing all of the New Orleans funksters output for Josie Records from the late 1960's to the early 1970's. This fine 2CD reissue on Charly Records features The Meters three complete original albums 'The Meters' (1969), 'Look-Ka Py-Py' (1970) and 'Struttin' (1970) plus singles and rarities from their much-sampled catalogue. What makes this set unique is that this is the first time that The Meters' entire body of work released on Josie Records becomes available in one collection.
