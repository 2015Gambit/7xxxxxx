This is the language files necessary to play the Russian version of Fifa Manager 2012 that claim to be playable in English.

If you have downloaded http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6785729/FIFA_Manager_2012_(2011)_PC_[ENG_RUS]_RePAck you find that after installation you only have Russian.

1. Find the installed 'eng' folder which is 'fmdata' folder within the Fifa Manger folder in program files. 

2. Move this file to your desktop until all the steps are complete and you know Fifa works in English.

3. Unpack this torrent so you have the uncompressed 'eng' folder.

4. copy this folder to the fmdata folder so you are effectively replacing the original 'eng' folder.

5. Run Fifa Manager 2012.

I suggest you DON'T have Fifa running until the above steps are complete.

This worked for me, but I can't offer any guarantees. I've just listed down what I did.
