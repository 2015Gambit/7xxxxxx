works on IPOD/PSP/PS3/IPHONE/IPAD/MAC & PC Also I watched it Via Apple TV.

This series was an excellent review of most of history's UFO stories, 
some very well known, and others less so. The only issue I have is with 
some of the names of the episodes, like "Britain's Roswell". This episode 
deserves it's own name, like "The Rendlesham Forest Incident". 
This and several other episodes, seen with an open mind, will have you 
questioning whether we really are alone.

I encourage everyone to watch any one of the series and then do some 
serious research into the subject. Don't listen to the BS that most people 
spout about UFOs and aliens. Go and check out the Disclosure Project and 
watch and listen to hundreds of credible servicemen and women tell their 
stories
