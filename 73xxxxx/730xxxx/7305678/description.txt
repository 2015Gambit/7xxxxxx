There's no other place that will take huge uploads like this, so I had to create a sexy torrent file to distribute the audio from our presidential debate.

Enclosed is the compressed .rar file of the .wav recorded through mumble; I would have edited out the long periods of silence, but no audio programs I had could handle a 4 gig wav file to work with.
