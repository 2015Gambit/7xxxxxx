This is my first upload, so bear with me.

These are a few episodes of "Growing Up Creepie" from the now defunct Discovery Kids network.  I DVRed them on a DIRECTV old standard format (4x3), then output them to the computer for editing, so the resolution is pretty low to start.  Then I removed the commercials and shrunk the videos further to simple MPeg format to fit on a tablet device.  MY kid was a fan of the show, so I'm putting these out there hoping to renew its popularity so maybe some other network will eventually pick up the show and start running the entire series again.  Please enjoy and share share share.

Episodes are:
On Thin Ice / Toxic Mutant Millipede
Nightmare on Locust Lane / The Mummy's Curse
Are You Afraid of the Moths / Revenge of the Water Bug
Creepie and the Candy Factory / The Ice Bug Cometh

Let me know if there's a problem with the format.
