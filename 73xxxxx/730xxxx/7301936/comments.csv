,kompas909,2012-05-27T13:12Z,My pleasure to share it with you guys ;)
,hwangtinglee,2012-05-27T16:31Z,Thanks for another great upload! I notice that your forum link now go straight to the web host's ad page. Is this a temporary technical issue or has the forum been moved elsewhere?
,Doziness,2012-05-27T16:40Z,"Does anyone know if you can use any of these updates with this Dungeon.Defenders.v7.25c.Update.incl.DLC-SKIDROW ? Also, does each update need to be done seperately or can you just get the latest?"
,prg10,2012-05-28T07:37Z,@Doziness: please reinstall 7.32 (http://thepiratebay.se/user/kompas909/) then follow the patch.
,jaquiow,2012-05-28T22:05Z,"This seems to be for a console.  I merged it with my folers and started the game, only to find gamepad letters over the options given and mouse functions didn't work.  

I had to start over with fresh Binary/UDKGame folders and update each one, sadly.  You might want to recheck this one again...that or there's a problem on my end, but I don't think that's the case.  Thanks for the time and effort you put into this though, this game is an addiction...I can't stop playing it..."
,banditco112,2012-05-29T11:25Z,"See, someone else got the XBOX interface as I had.

@jaquiow You just go to settings and change them back to PC. The patch works perfectly fine after that. "
,Doziness,2012-05-29T19:23Z,All I had to do to fix the Xbox thing was reopen DunDefConfig.exe and click SAVE.
,jaquiow,2012-06-01T09:19Z,"I remember going to the config and looking for how to change things back but i didn't see an option to switch between xbox settings and PC, though I do have some side-by-side listings of of lists, but there's no way to pick a specific category.

Saving when it was opened...I don't think I did that, I think I just canceled when seeing the above.  I guess I can try again, see if it works.  Thanks for the help."
