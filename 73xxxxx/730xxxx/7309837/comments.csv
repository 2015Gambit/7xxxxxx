,Ekomaira,2012-05-30T13:51Z,"perfect quality mate 10/10

one question though, i flicked through and noticed the subtitles are there even for English speaking. are there any subtitles i can get just for the German language?

cheers"

,SNDjunkie,2012-06-03T13:33Z,"great torrent as always, TY YIFY!

@tpboss: you probably might have enjoyed the movie if you hadn't tried to make any sense of it. Watch it as the complete nonsense it's intended to be... and you'll have a good time actually. :D"
,Jimbolaya,2012-06-03T17:49Z,"Once again the subtitle are useless. There are spelling issues, missing words and sometimes the subtitles says something completely else than what the actors are actually saying. Are you using some freeware speech-to-text to make the subtitles or what? Either that or someone who don't know a single word of English.."
