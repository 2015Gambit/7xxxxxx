Tarentino is a true master of the spoken word. The characters are multi-dimesional and it's difficult to get bored. The humor is overwhelmingly funny at times and keeps the story moving at a very good pace. The story alone makes this a must-have but throw in Tarentinos wit and ability and you have an instant classic, somthing that doesen't come around that often.
