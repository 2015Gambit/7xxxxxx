By the way, this proves that x264 is superior to all other encoding formats.

There is another Bob's Burgers Season 1+2 torrent floating around, but its bigger filesize, worse quality, and crappily titled."

,chrisrand,2012-05-28T22:40Z,"@ FaMoUz 

Sorry if you feel I disrespected you, but I am sure others would appreciate a smaller higher quality upload. 

I made this entirely on my own, where as others simply have compiled and uploaded.

My quality shows.  X264 is superior in every way and thats all I wanted others to see."

Do not comment spam other uploaders' torrent postings.
I have deleted all your spam comments."
,chrisrand,2012-05-30T03:41Z,I didn't know that was against the rules.  Sorry I am new to this.
,casstin,2012-05-31T03:02Z,"How can this be better quality if you re-encoded each file? You cannot improve quality by re-encoding, rather you lose quality. I think I'll look for the original 720p releases, thanks anyway."
,chrisrand,2012-06-01T02:10Z,"@ casstin I never said it was better than 720p. if you saw it in a comment, I meant its better than all the shitty xvid's out there and its way smaller."
,chrisrand,2012-06-01T02:11Z,@casstin I never said its better than the original 720p. If you saw my comment I was refering to my versions being better than the shitty xvid's out there and its smaller too.
,p3pt0,2012-08-07T19:02Z,"This just like the other guy has told you re-encoding from a 720p resolution source means that you will only LOSE quality.

The torrent I found on Demonoid was much better quality may have been 120MB an episode, but the sound quality was much more pristine and the colors were much more solid."
,p3pt0,2012-08-07T20:47Z,"Also, don't know what you encoded Season 1 Episode 7 as, but DVD Flick does not support it."
