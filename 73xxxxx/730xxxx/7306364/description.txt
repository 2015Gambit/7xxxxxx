Coldworker-The Doomsayers Call-2012-GRAVEWISH

Coldworker is a name any death metal fan will be familiar with because they have 
long been considered to be at the very forefront of the evolution of the genre. 
They have long since abandoned the standard serpentine-riff and blast beat oblivion
based approach to the style (although it persists to some extent), instead offering 
an interpretation that's based on the chaotic murderyour instruments type of 
expression as offered by many grindcore bands. They've also understood that playing 
grindcore only takes you so far, and thus, a hybrid sound that takes the best of 
both worlds was born. "The Doomsayer's Call" is their third attempt of such hellish 
chaos, and arguably their best and most interesting produce yet.
