Waste of bandwidth with crappy upscale from 720 to 1080?"

The mini-series was shot on film and they can transfer that to very high res, 1080p is no problem. s1 to s4, Razor, and The Plan were all shot in digital HD; anytime you see grain they've added that for a gritty feel. Everything for the Athena.and.Helo edit was done to maintain high 1080p video quality while making it portable enough so everyone can enjoy this fan edit. I strongly recommend the blu-ray set for the extras, the HD audio, and of course the rest of the awesome BSG story."

A new edition of Athena.and.Helo is being worked on and should be up soon, maybe a few weeks. It will have a new intro with Helo from the mini, the fight with Helo and the Chief, other enhancements, and many bug fixes. Plus, it will be encoded with better video and audio quality. Please enjoy v01 until v02 comes out!

Thanks, bsg4you"
