Athena.and.Helo is a TRUE FANEDIT of Battlestar Galactica 2003-2009 that includes all of Athena's story and her relationship with Helo. Some Helo material is included that doesn't directly relate to Athena, for example most of The Woman King story. All scenes where Athena has a line and almost every frame of when Athena was on screen is included. Additionally, Athena.and.Helo includes all non-Boomer Eights that are on the Galactica or around Helo, e.g. Rebel Eight from The Hub, the construction worker Eights, etc. This began as an edit with every Battlestar Galactica scene Grace Park was in and developed into Athena.and.Helo and Boomer.and.Chief. If you like this edit, please purchase the excellent Battlestar Galactica Blu-Ray set. Also, if you like the Athena.and.Helo edit:

Athena.and.Helo Technical Notes:
* Main source material was VC-1/H.264 1080p with DTS-HD 5.1 audio 
* All source material was converted to MPEG-2 (28Mbps-42Mbps) 1080p and AC-3 5.1 audio for editing

* Face of the Enemy webisodes were sourced from relatively low bit rate AVC 720p with AAC 2.0 audio (looks pretty good though)
* Deleted scenes are 360p with stereo audio; note there is a high amount of ambient noise in the deleted scenes in the background
* NOTE, audio levels are balanced based on listening to 5.1 surround sound; listening in stereo may cause dialogue in deleted scenes to sound louder than the 5.1 audio scenes that are being down mixed to stereo

Athena.and.Helo Content Notes:
* As many scenes in space were kept, especially space battles and Cylon Centurions
* Some scenes just include Athena parts without telling the story of the whole episode, e.g. Scar, The Passage, others
* Scenes without Athena.and.Helo but with important Athena or Athena.and.Helo discussions were included, e.g. between Adama and Roslin
* Deleted scenes with Athena were integrated, even scenes that are short or do not add much to the story
* Opening credit graphics may appear throughout the Athena.and.Helo episodes
