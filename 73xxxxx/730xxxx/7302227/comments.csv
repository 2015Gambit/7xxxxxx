Sorry, wait a day or two to get more seeders. I think I am currently the only seeder that is active. Not sure. Still. I am seeding from Finland, so if you're from somewhere far, I doubt I am seeding there. So just wait."

OP here.. Doesn't seem like I can comment with my poster account. So I guess I'll reply with this, anyways.
Sorry for the inconvenience, but I am but one man, so be sure to wait a day or two, I can't do anything about that really. (Seeding from Finland at the speed of 60kb/s, so don't blame me for slow download speed or anything.) I might be the only active seeder but I don't know."
