,MasterRaider,2012-05-28T01:05Z,"Please ignore my previous comment(recovering from headache), i wasn't thinking straight. i downloaded you VMtools from your mediafire account, is there any other Necessary things i need to download  that you recommend"
,MasterRaider,2012-05-28T03:14Z,"Also I've still been have trouble manually adding VRAM. In my free time in the last few weeks I've been playing around with the .vmx file and never got keynotes to work. I've added stuff like ""svga.vramSize = 134217728"" and it never worked once. And all the forums with people in my situation are still unresovled. So this might be a obstacle for you to look in to."
