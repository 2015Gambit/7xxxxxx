Excellent made-for-TV movie, shown in two parts for a total of three hours.
It follows Adolph Hitler's life as a young boy, an artist as a teenager, through the World War 1 promotion to Corporal, the formation and rise of the Nazi Party, until Hitler seizes the Presidency and takes total control of Germany, on the death of Von Hindenburg in 1934.

A must-see for anyone interested in our current society or the lessons of recent history. With star actors, great acting and high production values, it is well-dramatized and warns of the danger of fascist dictatorial governments, even possible in a constitutional democracy. I think it ranks with "Brave New World" and "1984" as a warning of things that might come (again in this case).

"For peace, freedom, and democracy
 millions of dead urge
 Never again fascism"
- engraved on a stone taken from a nearby quarry where Jewish war-slaves laboured, placed in 1989 outside the house where Hitler was born.
