BIG Thanx! 

A: I rather like VOBs better. But as long as it is untouched 9, ISOs r just as good. "
[T],Auge,2012-05-27T01:52Z,"russell1nash,
I will post the second disc mid next week."
,russell1nash,2012-05-27T03:56Z,"roger that, Auge!

cheers and thanx again! "

@ Auge .... Your question ISO / VOB ( ? )

.... Both are okay, but ... :

You can always take a look in an open folder ( VOB - VIDEO_TS ), and confirm for example
AUDIO tracks, Subtitles, NTSC or PAL etc .... BEFORE you start the download.

Important when uploaders ""forget"" the description .... ( Not a problem with you, Auge ) !

ISO's are ""closed"" ....but i guess many downloaders find them ""easy to burn""....

My vote goes to VIDEO_TS / DVD9 ( without compression ).

.... but i fully understand that 
ISO's + Compressed DVD5 will probably 
create bigger download-traffic.

I hate asking, but I have been looking for a copy of the original Baron von Munchausen. Any idea where I might find one? Thanks."
,famemon78,2012-05-27T14:38Z,OHH yaa now thats what im talking about.. AN impossible to find criterion.. 3 cheers for Auge :)
[T],insinuendo,2012-05-28T11:27Z,Another fine piece of cinema!
,garycarradine,2012-05-29T14:27Z,"auge

for me, iso's are better than vob. easy to burn :))"
,Waikiki2008,2012-05-30T15:01Z,"Since I find myself preserving most of your torrents to Dvd, I prefer ISO. "
,francisfordcopulate,2012-06-12T23:45Z,"Thanks for uploading so many amazing films - I'm still hoping you get around to putting up THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, it's just about the only great classic film from the 30's I don't yet have on DVD.

By the way, my vote goes for VTS/DVD5 (compressed) - it just saves time & space, since the great majority are going to be burning it to a 4gig dvdr anyway."
,francisfordcopulate,2012-06-13T00:20Z,"Also, if choosing ISO, many people, myself included, can't burn a 7 gig file such as this to dvd. 

So either VTS, (compressed OR uncompressed) or ISO compressed, would be my request."
