Notes:
READNFO - This CAM contains a lot of camera movement from the start and throughout, on occasion
there is loss of the screen for a few seconds. Also, the video contains hardcoded foreign subtitles
They aren't visible all of the time, due to the cropping and camera movement
One last thing, I tagged this as a CAM because in my opinion there is no way that this is a TS

Source was actually nice for a first CAM. I started by dropping the rmvb file into VDub
First thing I did was crop the video so you can't see half of the actual cinema around the film
Once I got it to the way I wanted I used a few filters to touch up the quality of the video
tweaked the RGB, Contrast/Brightness, HSV levels and a slight sharpen. That's pretty much it
not bad at all for a first CAM, more than watchable but many will disagree. Let the bitchy comments begin... :P
