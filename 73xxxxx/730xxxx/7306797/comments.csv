,oss_spy,2012-06-24T23:32Z,"It appears as though you forgot to put in EU v1.0. If you did, I'm having a bit of trouble finding it...all I can see is v1.1."
,Svakoga,2012-07-28T07:33Z,"I'm having problems with the last one (Divine Winds). When I run the setup it says it cant write the ""makecopies.bat"" file. I don't know what to do. Can anyone help?"
