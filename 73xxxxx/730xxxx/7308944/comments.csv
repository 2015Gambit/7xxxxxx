Blu-Ray 3D Ripper is outdated"
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-06-05T23:49Z,"""dvd xxxxx has expired"" [replace xxxxx with ""Clone"" or ""Copy"" etc. is displayed even after the crack is copied to the program folder. I am guessing the existing crack that has been around has been ""fixed"" by DVDFab?"
,souti2006,2012-06-20T16:23Z,"I'm confirming, the please go ahead with this app. It is an awesome application and the Crack just working fine. No crap messages like 'Outdated' or 'Expired'. I have been using this application from months. No problem though."
