High-class citizens of Montevideo, Los Killers hed two extremely valuable advantages for the limited local rock scene. First, they could afford expensive hi-tech gear. Second, they owned a vast record collection full of recent foreign editions -the ideal way to find hit covers for their shows. Their first single, released through Clave label, included a cover of the main theme from the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Their second single was a cover of Bloodrock, something absolutely unusual at that time. Their only album (Goodbye) represents a turn of their politic of playing covers, since it only included two. The original songs, nevertheless, are very well composed, arranged and performed.Marcelo Cress is particularly good on guitar. The best songs are ''After nothing'' and ''Sing Along'', with extensive guitar solos. Like so many other bands of that time, the military coup of 1973 put their career to an end. They moved to Spain where they continued working for some years.Their charismatic drummer, Romancho Berro, returned to Uruguay by the middle of the 80s to become manager and promoter.
