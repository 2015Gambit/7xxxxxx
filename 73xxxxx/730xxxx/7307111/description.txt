Mp3 blogs are blamed for every music-in-the-digital-age woe: declining CD sales, blink-and-you-miss-it hype cycles, cavalier attitudes towards copyright, loss of paying music journalism jobs. What you don't hear so much is how these sites create and foster communities-- virtual ones, obviously, but geographical ones too. Like many other indie bands, Edinburgh's Meursault are releasing their new LP on a small, local label. The difference is that Song, by Toad Records is a spinoff of a successful mp3 blog and podcast of the same name. Together they comprise a triple threat that the Scotsman has called the "DIY front-line of the city's homespun and rapidly expanding music scene." Think globally, act locally, eh?
At this point, Meursault have little name recognition beyond the borders of Edinburgh or Hype Machine. But All Creatures Will Make Merry, a more developed and thoughtful follow-up to their craggy 2008 debut, Pissing on Bonfires/Kissing With Tongues, could change that. Don't let the album title fool you: Like fellow Scots Frightened Rabbit and the Twilight Sad, Meursault are ambassadors of misery, self-loathing, and huge, heart-heavy choruses. Most sad bastards can generate a modicum of optimism on January 1. But on "Crank Resolutions", the sadder bastards in Meursault declare, "I broke down on New Year's Day/ And I mixed my drinks/ And I lost my way," among hyperventilating electronic beats and pyrrhic victory shouts. It's enormous fun, of course, and I can't wait to see a live audience sob along to every word.
