Lucy Wright is a nursing student when her life goes from bad to worse to hell. Her boyfriend leaves, she becomes addicted to crack, and the bills keep piling up. To get out of debt, she smuggles cocaine from Argentina back to the U.K. But she's busted in Argentina - facing 16 to 25 years. She decides her only chance at freedom is escaping to Brazil. She makes a decision to jump bail, become a fugitive from the law and flee across the border. But without a passport, she must cross the old-fashioned way: swim. Emerging miraculously on the other side, she believes she is free and starts a new life back home. But two years later, police come knocking.
