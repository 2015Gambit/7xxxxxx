,Condorz2098,2012-05-27T13:40Z,Thanks! I really appreciate your torrents. High quality yet the small size.. Could you in anyway try encoding your torrents in mp4 format in the same quality? I wanna watch it on my PS3 but it won't read mkv files. I've tried the PS3 media server and the mp4 converter but nothing would work.  
,Molleee,2012-05-27T14:20Z,thx for 720p. keep it up ^^
,caincha,2012-05-27T16:15Z,@Condorz2098: you can download and use Handbreak to convert to whatever format you want.

It also shows that the file is over 10 hour long which doesn't make any sense."
,sushicoco,2012-06-21T01:00Z,Forget I said anything. Works well on Windows Media Player Classic but only on that one (here at least).
