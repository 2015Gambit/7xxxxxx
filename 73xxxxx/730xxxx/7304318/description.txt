LOOT............is really a revolutionary movie in Nepali Movies industry. This has an extreme unpredictable story line. The dialogs in the movies provides spices to the movie. This movie is really a nice one. All the 5 main characters in the movie are amazing. The movie tries to implicit the picture of capital city of Nepal. It shows how 5 characters gets involved in a bank robbery. The sound quality and camera are really nice. The movie contains humor from start to the end until we find an interesting twist at the end of the movie. All the characters, specially Haku Kale and Gopal can never be removed from our mind. This movie really leaves some stripes in our daily life.
