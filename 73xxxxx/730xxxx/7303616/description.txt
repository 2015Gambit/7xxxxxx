John Edginton's documentary explores the making of Pink Floyd's ninth studio album, 
Wish You Were Here, which was released in September 1975 and went to top the album 
charts both in the UK and the US.

Featuring new interviews with band members Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason 
alongside contributions from the likes of guest vocalist Roy Harper, sleeve designer 
Storm Thorgerson and photographer Jill Furmanovsky, the film is a forensic study of 
the making of the follow-up to 1973's Dark Side of the Moon, which was another 
conceptual piece driven by Roger Waters.

The album wrestles with the legacy of the band's first leader Syd Barrett, who had 
dropped out of the band in 1968 and is eulogised in the album's centrepiece, Shine 
On You Crazy Diamond. Pink Floyd had become one of the biggest bands in the world, 
but the 60s were over and the band were struggling both to find their purpose and 
the old camaraderie
