Alkaline Trio frontman Matt Skiba's first studio album (his solo debut, 2010's Demos, was just that, a collection of home recordings) relies heavily on the Chicago native's penchant for dark, pulpy lyrics, but while punk still serves as the foundation for Skiba's mini horror novels, Babylon introduces a likable pop sheen to the mix that both elevates and homogenizes the end product.
