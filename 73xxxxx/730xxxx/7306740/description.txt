DESCRIPTION:

 English offers perhaps the richest vocabulary of all languages, in part because its words are culled from so many languages. 
It is a shame that we do not tap this rich source more often in our daily conversation to express ourselves more clearly and precisely. 
Many a vocabulary book listsesoteric words we quickly forget or feel self-conscious using. 
However, there is a bounty of choice words between the common and the esoteric that often seem be just on the tip of our tongue. 
Vocabulary 4000 brings these words to the fore.
