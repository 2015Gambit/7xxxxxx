,goodtime212,2012-06-01T16:08Z,I've been trying for ages to download this and have managed 99.9%. No seeders but over 400 peers. I'm trying to find out how to contact Mastlock. I'm thick LOL can somebody contact him or leave instructions how please.
,Flyinby,2012-06-07T06:23Z,"You'll need to wait another year or two for the download, as Adobe just released Photoshop 6 a month or so ago.  Not sure how anyone got PS7 for this torrent, since it's probably in the beginning stages of development.  I strongly suggest you do not run any executable files from this download, or waste your time trying to finish the torrent...there IS no Photoshop 7."
,Flyinby,2012-06-07T06:34Z,"Sorry about the last post...there is no Photoshop CS7, but the old Photoshop, before CS, did have a version 7.  This version, if it is PS 7.0, is from about 2002, though it will still run in Win7 if you can find the rest of the torrent."

,Lady_Bronco,2012-06-25T03:16Z,Does this have (or need) a serial key?
