With just days to go before the kick-off of the Euro 2012 championships, Panorama reveals 
shocking new evidence of racist violence and anti-semitism at the heart of Polish and 
Ukrainian football and asks whether tournament organiser UEFA should have chosen both 
nations to host the prestigious event.

Reporter Chris Rogers witnesses a group of Asian fans being attacked on the terraces of 
a Ukrainian premier league match and hears anti-Semitic chanting at games in Poland. And 
with exclusive access to a far right group in Ukraine which recruits and trains football 
hooligans to attack foreigners, Panorama asks: how safe will travelling football teams 
and their supporters be at this summer's European festival of football?
