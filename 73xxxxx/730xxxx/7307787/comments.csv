Western Europe is in political chaos, muslims bomb trains, buildings and kill women and children on the streets, London burns in week long riots, as does Paris, Rotterdam, Bradford, Malmo, Copenhagen and dozens of other cities with no-go zones and thousands of burning cars and attacks on police. Nazis march in Germany and have power in Greece. Right wing parties all over Western Europe are getting into parliament....and what do BBC/Tel Aviv central produce... that Poland and the Ukraine have hooligans no their games? Wild kids who need to get their aggression out...this happens in every stadium throughout Europe..oh wait, they say ""Sieg Heil"", that automatically makes them ""The worst"". But throwing molotov cocktails at police or rioting and burning down whole city areas...then it's not ""hate"", then it's ""youths"" who can't get jobs and we need to ""understand"" their ""frustration"". 

Oy vey, BBC, this piece will win a prize for you at the zionist awards."

Volodymyr Gerashchenko, the 66-year-old general secretary of the Ukraine National Olympic Committee, has quit but said he will co-operate with the independent investigation commission that was launched last week.

Ukrainian NOC president Sergey Bubka said: ""The Ukraine National Olympic Committee takes accusations very seriously and that is why we have acted so swiftly to address the recent BBC reports."" Gerashchenko, head of Ukraine's NOC since 1997, was filmed by BBC London News offering to sell 100 tickets worth several thousand pounds to an undercover reporter posing as a ticket tout.

Legislation brought in since London won the vote to host the Games in 2005 makes it a criminal offence to sell Olympics tickets on the black market, with a fine of up to ÂŁ20,000 for each offence.

Gerashchenko was filmed telling the undercover reporter: ""I understand you're a dealer - that's why for me, you are priority number one, the top, the person, in case we have extra tickets to contact you, we contact you."" The official also asked to paid in cash for the tickets. "

Mister 22... for you to have written what you did makes you either dumb, blind or plain stupid. People can lie..Words can lie...those pictures didnt. 
Sieg Heil is the worst because of what it stands for. it doesnt stand for anything else does it?.. i didnt see them idiots attacking white people next to them did you. No, they ran half way around a stadium to attack a group of asians. If that aint racist......

There will be trouble this summer and england and other teams should pull out and teach EUFA a lesson for being so dumb to hold it in a country that has some people 50 years behind the rest of europe. Then maybe we can sack platinin and blatter"
,Mister22,2012-05-30T00:21Z,"Isn't the timing of this thing a bit suspicious??

They could have addressed this ""problem"" two years ago! But ONE week before the event?? 

I think this is a paid piece by higher powers who want to make Poland and the Ukraine to look bad. These supporters are under 000.1% of the population and are young hoodlums in need of aggression and male territory marking. Just because the men in the west have become metro-sexual and wear man bags and hair-gel, doesn't mean that's the way it should be! 

I think BBC should make an undercover tv-show about the muslim grooming gangs in the UK, or the imams that preach death and hell to the non-believers. It worked on the 7/7 bombers.

So, they found some football fans who shout ""Sieg Heil"". SO FUCKING WHAT!! 

Christians are being shot, killed and tortured all over the Arab world by muslims...but hey, the BBC doesn't feel that's important to talk about. What about the insane slave-trade of white eastern-European women in Israel? GOOGLE IT!

This ""documentary"" is just a piece of shit propaganda."
