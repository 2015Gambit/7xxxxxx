After years of waiting and expectations, Enduser finally comes back with a new album. This towering artist of the drum'n'bass and breakcore scene comes up here with an extremely important and soulful album in which his hard breaks and beats share the stage with much gentler melodies and atmospheres. A highly emotional album whose palette ranges from melancholy to rage, it is a new awe-inspiring album by a musician which proves again that his talent is multidimensional, humane and essential.
