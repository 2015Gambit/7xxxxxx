,buzzrking,2012-07-09T06:17Z,whats the audio format and are the subs hardcoded because i dont need the subs?
,cutecat42,2012-07-19T00:13Z,"The subs will be hard to ignore, but if this works, I'll love you. All I need is season 4, but there are no torrents just for that seeds-at least one's that have seeders that is. Hopefully this one works =)"
,cutecat42,2012-07-19T00:15Z,"And once again, (quoting Leonard from the show), I cannot catch a break around here. This says it has 13 seeders, but guess what? There's none. Thanks for nothing..."
