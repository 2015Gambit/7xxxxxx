Trespassing is the second studio album by Adam Lambert, originally scheduled for U.S. release on March 20, 2012. In mid-February it was re-scheduled for "May", to make room for new songs and collaborations. In late March, alongside the reveal of snippets of four album tracks, Lambert announced on Twitter that the album would be released on May 15, 2012. Lambert is the executive producer on Trespassing, as well as a principal writer.

In its first week, Trespassing debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making him the first openly gay mainstream artist to do so in history, and selling nearly 78,000 albums in the US. In Canada, the album debuted at number one selling 7,300 copies.
