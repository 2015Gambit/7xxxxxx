-Scultpie primitive creation tools have been added to the Second Life menu.
-The registration dialog has been removed as it is no longer a required feature.
-To reduce the installer size, documentation and video tutorials have been moved to an online source and the help option will launch the URL.
-Removal of multiple listings of Taper tool in the Tools menu.
-Version number has been changed to a four number format: i.e., 2.5.0.1.
-Fixed an issue where popup menus could appear off the screen when the menu was initiated near the edge of the application.
General:
-Issues with DAZ Studio 1.7 and C++ run time library: Since the new release of DAZ Studio (1.8+) the C++ run time library error has been corrected.
-Added more appropriate warning to the smoothing operation to indicate when the operation may be too intensive.
-Found several cases where un-initialized values were being used which would cause internal errors. This should make the application more stable.
3D Camera:
-Resolved an issue where the camera could be zoomed in too far which would cause the direction vector to be undefined and control of the camera would be lost.
File Loading:
-Improved 3DS file loading to handle materials.
-Updated 3DS loading file library to a more recent release.
-Improved OBJ file loading in how it handles materials.
-Attempts at using un-initialized variables no longer causing internal errors when loading some files.
Tesselation:
-Resolved an issue where subdivision could use an unreferenced variable which would cause an internal error."
