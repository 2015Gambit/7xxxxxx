Welcome to the unofficial guide to, in my opinion, the best game from the Harry Potter series so far: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The guide is divided into two big parts: the encyclopedia and the walkthrough. In encyclopedia you will find detailed information which help you to achieve 100% in game stats. The walkthrough is just a walkthrough. :) As always, I insist on using the guide only when youΓÇÖre in big trouble ΓÇô the game is not too hard and the only thing that may cause more trouble is finding all the details and solving some more difficult riddles. Enjoy!
