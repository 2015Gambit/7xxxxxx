This started off as just tinkering with these films inside of premiere to see if I could get them to go together, and it turned into a full-on 9 and a half hour fan project encompassing all of the films leading up to the Avengers. Iron Man 1 and 2, Hulk, Thor and Captain America have all been stitched together more or less chronologically and (fairly) seamlessly. Now for most of the movies the title sequence had to be left intact because it contains important exposition, so for that reason they have been left in, so its not exactly like its one long movie but it's close. I was just interested to see if anyone wanted this so I decided to put it out there for the internet to decide. This is really a v1 so if anyone has comments please feel free to share them and if there is a demand, maybe I can make a v2. Thanks for taking the time to download and enjoy nerding out to my hard work!

P.S. Subtitles are kind of necessary because for the few non-english parts they are not hard-coded into the video.
