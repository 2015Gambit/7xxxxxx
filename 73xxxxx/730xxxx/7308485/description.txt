As the wide-eyed winners of triple j's Unearthed High competition, talented Melbourne youths Snakadaktal have the world at their feet and, we're predicting, a gleaming future ahead of them. The band gave us the lowdown on each track off their impressive self-titled EP, including the story behind "Chimera", the gorgeous shoegazey pop tune that made triple j sit up and take note... They're embarking on a national tour in December, so go catch them live and maybe buy them a drink. Check ID first though. They're hell young.
