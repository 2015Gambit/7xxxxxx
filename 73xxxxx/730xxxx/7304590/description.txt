New constable Maggie Doyle arrives in Mt. Thomas. She is faced with not only rampant chauvinism but the fact that she will be stationed with her ex-boyfriend, Constable Wayne Patterson, who has recently moved there with his wife Roz.
On her first night in town, Maggie encounters local girl Sally-Anne after she is raped by her boyfriend, Bruce Maclean. Sally-Anne makes a formal complaint but after Bruce pressures her, she attempts to withdraw it. When she discovers that this isn't possible, Sally-Anne tries to commit suicide but is found be Maggie and Nick who are able to revive her.
Tom sends Maggie and Wayne out to speak to farmer Mick Doherty about his parking fines. When Mick's dog breaks free from its chain, Maggie is forced to shoot him to protect Wayne prompting Mick to start firing back at them. To make amends, Tom is forced to go out and have a "yarn" with Mick, and with the help of PJ, gets Mick a new dog.
