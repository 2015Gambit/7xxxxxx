[T],Auge,2012-05-27T18:39Z,"baybeh,

LOL, thank you.
I love watching film, talking about film, reading about film . . . ETC.
Absolutely none of my friends or coworkers are as passionate (or geeky) about film and film history as I am.
It is even hard to find cenephiles on-line with the same interest in old film . . . there is no problem finding folks that wanna talk about stuff that came out in the last 5-10 years. 
The books are to encourage those that do have interest."
,baybeh,2012-05-29T19:00Z,Thanks Auge. Much appreciated.

BTW Auge, keep those Criterions coming I am so grateful for your work."
