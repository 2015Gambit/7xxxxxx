Progress can be a wonderful thing. I'm always impressed with Melora Creager's unwillingness to make the same record twice. On Sister Kinderhook, the Rasputina sonic palette continues to gain new colors, this time courtesy of Ms. Creager's banjo & keyboards as well as new cellist Daniel DeJesus' use of erhu (a chinese 2 stringed violin). My concerns over the loss of Jonathan Tebeest, Rasputina's first 'official' drummer, are soothed by the presence of new timekeeper Catie D'Amica's more than capable percussion stylings.
What do remain from previous records are Melora's gorgeous voice and those wonderful cellos, making this album distinctly Rasputina. Much of the lyrical content presents an alternate view of history similar to that portayed on Oh Perilous World. Long time admirers of Rasputina, especially those who appreciate Melora Creager's steadfast refusal to stand still musically, will find much to love here and lovers of great, original & intelligent music should not let this one get away.
