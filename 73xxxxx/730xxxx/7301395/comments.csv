,setu4993,2012-05-28T10:39Z,"@Phntzm79 : Yes, this is it.
But, 320kbps if possible?"
,Phntzm79,2012-06-15T14:53Z,"Encoding everything at 320Kbps[CBR] is not necessary as the LAME 3.98[VBR] high bit rate encoder setting produces transparent encoding which means the human ear is not capable of detecting audible differences between the original lossless track and the lossy encoded track!
What this means is that you don't need to encode at 320kbps to get a high quality track if you use good encoding software and good [VBR] settings!
Peace, Phantazm"
