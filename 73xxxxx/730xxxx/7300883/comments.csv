You definitely need them to understand what's going on."

,Yaboo56,2012-05-27T05:17Z,"Cortorbor  and others ..

Subs all over the screen in an SRT file are due to TOO much text in the sub-section,  easily fixed in notepad by splitting the text and tweaking the times in sequence.

,mrvip29,2012-05-27T16:32Z,can  u  add  subtitle  to  movie   when  using  nero 11 to burn 
,rhodyvik,2012-06-05T07:44Z,"Anyone else having a delay sync with video and audio? Sometimes audio is ahead, sometimes it's behind. And I'm using VLC. To me it's the most reliable player that doesn't mess up synchronization but I can't go fullscreen and enjoy the movie without using the ""Adjustments and Effects."" I'm just wondering if other people have the same problem...and if so what's the proper number in the A&E tab? 

V: 10
A: 8 (not because of sync issues but it's not clear at some junctures)

Great upload! Big props to boobsman"
,rhodyvik,2012-06-05T07:46Z,"@mrvip29 -- yes you can add subtitles while burning :)

It's quite simple but it's easier if you just go through Nero's help."
