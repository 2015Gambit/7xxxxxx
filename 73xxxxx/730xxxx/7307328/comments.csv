,.ACTiVE.,2012-05-29T06:40Z,"Sorry for the double comment post, i must've clicked twice by accident. Anyways, GREAT upload, works fine for me Windows 7 64bit Home. You need to restart your computer and also when you move the crack into the Program File you click Copy and Replace."
[V],ThumperTM,2012-05-29T10:11Z,"Hey guys,

This is tested in windows 7 enterprise and XP as well> Works 100% :)"
,Bjellesau,2012-05-29T12:12Z,"1. Sorry for late response. Investigation the problem took some time.

2. It's working like a charm!!!!

3. I do not know why it didn't work at first try. Or second or third reinstallation.

4. But when erasing all keys with ""DVDFAB"" in registry, reboot and reinstall - it workd and it still does.

5. So sorry for taking your time with local trobles

6. Best wishes to all"
[V],ThumperTM,2012-05-29T15:50Z,Glad to hear it :)
,deathangel864,2012-05-29T17:37Z,Don't know how to fix but I keep getting messages that my dvdfab features are expired
,Arilanya,2012-05-29T20:21Z,"Windows 7 Home 64-bit, appears to work on startup screen, but throws expired error when switching to DVD5.  Tried on two PCs, same OS, both do the same thing."
,bxvipp,2012-05-29T20:25Z,"I get the message that the
Blu-Ray 3D Ripper is outdated"
,Agent666,2012-05-31T05:26Z,"# STILL REPORTS 'EXPIRED' !
DID THE FOLLOWING:
REMOVED DVDFAB 8185 WITH REVO
REMOVED REMAINDER OF REG KEYS W/ O&O REG EDITOR
RESTARTED.
REINSTALLED... STILL THE SAME, APPS ARE 'EXPIRED'
# USING WINDOWS 7 PRO, i7-950 CPU.
# REINSTALLING DVDFAB V8181 - THIS WORKS FINE!
I WILL CHECK BACK IN A FEW DAYS TO SEE IF ANYTHING HAS IMPROVED AS FAR AS THE INSTALLATION OF DVDFAB 8185 GOES."
,podrido,2012-06-01T01:05Z,"Does not works.
The crack does not works
""dvd ripper has expired"""
,D4RK-KN1GHT,2012-06-01T10:55Z,"i ran the install successfully then copied the crack over the top of my own dvdfab.exe and can confirm this does not work, 'blu ray ripper expired'"
,wittyusername,2012-06-03T15:53Z,Just installed on Vista desktop and it is working fine.  Maybe people with issues have previous version still installed?
,dougaldog2002,2012-06-04T22:50Z,"Thanks so much for this, I've been going nuts for a few days after losing a whole bunch of programs due to a hard drive crash, this one being one of them. I've tried many DVD cloning/ripping apps over the last few years and this is, by far, the best of the bunch and it keeps getting better with every iteration. 

Thanks again!"
,t3kla,2012-06-05T07:21Z,"Np w/this one, W7 Pro-64, thanks Thumper. "
,TheEmpathicEar,2012-06-05T23:49Z,"""dvd xxxxx has expired"" [replace xxxxx with ""Clone"" or ""Copy"" etc. is displayed even after the crack is copied to the program folder. I am guessing the existing crack that has been around has been ""fixed"" by DVDFab? "
,digritz,2012-06-13T07:04Z,"Did'ja remember to uncheck the ""check for new version"" function under General Settings?

If this isn't disabled, the software will expire various options once it connects with its web server."
,WinterGr8,2012-06-15T01:00Z,"Great job bro... replaced a previous slightly broken version from someone else. Just search for and delete your registry folders for DVDFab if you had it previously installed. Then follow Thumpers directions. Should work fine. Remember to go into the general settings tab and disable the ""auto check for updates"" too. Running Win7 Ultimate x64... Thanks again man!"
