Episode 2 - Juggler Smuggler


Mark Greening has the easy life as a magician in Bali... until he finds out he's going to be a dad. Needing fast cash for his new responsibilities, he smuggles a kilo of hash from Nepal inside pellets he actually swallows - which proves to be an easy act for this magician to perfect. He's saved more than $80,000 through his scheme and decides to make another (doomed) trip to Nepal. A bad bout of diahhrea means problems swallowing the pellets. He breaks the golden rule to never body-pack hash, and enhanced airport security for the soccer World Cup in Tokyo during a stop home gets him busted.
