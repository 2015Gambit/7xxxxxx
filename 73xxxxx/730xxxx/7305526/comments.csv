Have you not heard of CHOICE? There are several reasonable quality 720p downloads for you to choose.

Why take away the option for those of us with true HD and good download bandwidth  to watch in its original 1080i.

If someone in your town only has a donkey and cart for transport, should be remove all those big gas guzzlers off the roads to make more room for donkey and carts?

Think before you bleat."

,argotera,2012-05-28T18:51Z,"Anyone else facing really slow download speeds in this 1080i ""game of thrones"" releases besides me?

Though there seems to be plenty of seeds, i seem to download from only one or two, and sporadically some parts from other peers at slow speed.

I can download other similar in size and seeds torrents at a quarter of a time "
,Dalet19,2012-05-29T20:01Z,The quality worth the weight
,MikeyMetal,2012-05-30T09:04Z,"I get these proper source 1080i files and the quality on my 55"" full HD TV is fucking jaw dropping. So it may take me a few days to get it, the wait is truly worth it. I just wish more people seeded, and not grab and run.
This episode is fully amazing. I made the mistake of getting the non-Dibya release, and noticed straight away the less sharp detail i'm used to. BIG MISTAKE. This one is the real fucking deal! 

To DibyaTPB, I thank you sincerely my Lord!"

,siewaylan,2012-09-21T22:14Z,"These files may be large, but the quality is unbelievable.  Thanks for the great uploads DibyaTPB!"
