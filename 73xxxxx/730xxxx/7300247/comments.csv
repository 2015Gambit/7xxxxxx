,MJI,2012-05-26T07:20Z,WOW. Every other Men In Black torrent is blazing fast. I downloaded the other crap copy in 25 minutes...Why is this one taking so long? I max out at about 100 kb/s and then it just snowballs all the way down to zero...over and over....None of my other torrents do this so I know it's not on my end. SEED!
,blurgasm,2012-05-26T07:36Z,"Although I have yet to completely download it, by looking at the files in my bittorrent there are no RAR files inside. If I finish downloading, I'll keep you up to date, however, it is a pretty slow download due to seeders."
,Lushanthau,2012-05-26T08:01Z,"Can Someone Please Tell Me How's The A/V
Thanks"
,awesome123ad,2012-05-26T08:04Z,Downloaded the sample and looks like a cropped version of the shaking cams floating around

@blurgasm What does RAR files have to do with this? The folder contains 5 files: 
mibIII-wbz.avi	997.39 MiB
NFO.nfo	2.59 KiB
READ this before playing the Movie.txt	473 B
sample.avi	9.84 MiB
www.Torrenting.com.txt

What are you getting at sir? "
,MJI,2012-05-26T08:20Z,Thanks for the quality update awesome123ad. Guess I will just stop this slow ass download and wait until someone has a better copy.

Very ThankÂ´s,

Great job!"
,QWESTSUX,2012-05-26T10:51Z,"More objective A/V please.

4 is crappy (cropped, dark, out of sync, background noise, crooked, etc)

Any other ratings?"
,adam300978,2012-05-26T15:24Z,at one point the camera is hidden behind the cinema seats so you cant see whats happening lol. would be ok if it was mounted to a tripod and didnt move so much. gonna wait for better copies but thanks anyway.

Around 5 times throughout the movie the screen goes black for a minute or two but other then that its not a bad cam"
,spifkitten99,2012-05-26T19:10Z,"Don't say it's not bad for a cam.

It's complete crap for a cam!

Unfortunately people don't make very good cams anymore, but there are some cams that are so much better than this total shit."

,no_name_3,2012-05-26T23:57Z,"@literaltim giving an accurate rating of something hardly constitutes as ""bitching."" it's morons like you that lower the quality of PB. 

we all appreciate uploads for what they are...but that doesn't change the fact if they are shit uploads. "

,Fritz.,2012-05-27T00:54Z,"
if someone set a nice steaming bowl of shit in front of you for dinner, and said, dont bitch about it, its free...

would you be happy?

thats why saying it on the tpb is just dumb. just because something is free doesnt make it good."

,quietguy404,2012-05-27T11:31Z,the reason taht some people repost the same copy is because getting more seeders/ leechers is like a pissing contest. sometimes you get somone that will tweek and improve it but otherwise its just a waist of time and peoples bandwidth. some of these people think that everyone is with unlimited bandwidth so they dont care. 
,s3177430,2012-05-27T11:31Z,"I don't know what everyone is talking or complaining about. The quality is great for a cam so is the audio. The cameraman has to duck a couple of times to avoid being detected but it's nothing substantial you still get excellent sound quality.

For a cam:

V - 7/10 
(A bit of cropping here and there as the video camera width and height can't accommodate the screen) 
A - 9/10 (Sounds great for a cam..)"

,xXTheGoonXx,2012-05-27T12:07Z,"overall watchable, but this dude was holding the cam to the point of it shaking around constantly. He also put it down a few times and in that time it was about 3 min. of theater seat. The end was cut off as well.

,Fritz.,2012-05-28T02:34Z,"
i could try to give away bowls of shit i would get people bitching about it.

the rationale that just because something is free people should be happy with it is completely flawed.


if its shit you call it shit."

hurr durr, free videos are same as living on street hurr durr.

,Abigail80,2012-05-28T05:05Z,"Audio has a bad echo and sounds bad 3/10... The video is quite good for a cam copy. I would say 8/10 (for a cam) shame about the audio or it would be watchable.

,Fritz.,2012-05-28T05:58Z,"
anyways im just tired of people saying ""oh its free shut up and be happy"" when something is shit.

the movie is missing the ending and the audio sucks, but we are supposed to be like ""oh herp derp, it was free, it doesnt matter"".

the idiocy is just remarkable.

if something is shit, it doesnt matter if it was 100$ or if it was free, its still shit.
