I must ask this: are the subtitles a *.srt* file or is it a hard sub, non removable?

Thanks 4 the upload, either way.

I shall assume the the '.mkv' (matroska vehicle) contains AC-3 file, AVC file, and a '.srt' file, all embeded into a '.mkv' file.
Will start DL right now.
Thanks, once more."

Pictures is super, and so is audio.

Thanks"
