[T],tr108,2012-06-01T03:37Z,"You're welcome everyone.

@memozozz - the presets I use (along with some basic instructions) are available for download:
http://www.peejeshare.com/files/362129257/HandBrake_Presets.zip.html

@flashfart - sorry, neither of those titles is likely within the next two month. But feel free to remind me in August in case you haven't found them elsewhere by then.

@Dalubai - If we're thinking of the same film (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/), when I spot a high-quality source, I'll def convert & up."
,thefan23,2012-06-01T04:50Z,Is Project X on your list by chance? 
[T],tr108,2012-06-01T05:59Z,"Yeah, I'm gonna be doing Project X"
,rogerguy01,2012-06-01T06:27Z,tr108 can u uplaod batman year one + catwoman shortfilm
[T],tr108,2012-06-01T06:56Z,@rogerguy01 - patience. ;)
,thefan23,2012-06-01T17:35Z,@tr108 thanks. It should be a good one. surprised you uploaded a 720 planet of the apes 
[T],tr108,2012-06-01T19:18Z,"@thefan23 - yeah, I know Apes is one of HolyRoses' titles that's still going strong but since I have the benefit of snatching it off disc, I can keep the commentaries, as well as burn-in the sign language subs. Since I was doing it for an (offline) friend in 1080, I figured I might as well as encode and share in 720 for folks online.

I'm afraid Project X is gonna make me feel old! lol."
,Dalubai,2012-06-01T20:41Z,"Yeah, it's that one tr108, thanks!"
,thefan23,2012-06-01T22:00Z,@tr108 okay. Thats nice of you then. Lol I guess those days are over. We all can still have fun
,memozozz,2012-06-06T17:34Z,"thanks so much for the presets, =) i got a question, its normal that any conversion takes more than 16 hrs? some of them more than 20?"
[T],tr108,2012-06-07T15:35Z,"@memozozz - if you're using the 1080p Best preset (and not the Fast) then yes, it's likely that (depending on your hardware) your encodes could take so long. If you're doing two-pass encodes, it'll def take so long. Or does that not describe your situation?"
,memozozz,2012-06-07T20:37Z,"I'm using the 1080p Best at CQ 19, and it takes 16 hrs in my imac and 24 in my macbook, so i guess its normal and the quality it's untouched"
[T],tr108,2012-06-08T15:59Z,"@memozozz - yeah, those times sound about right.

One piece of advice tho: if you're gonna go below 20, a better use of your time is using the Fast preset and cranking CQ to 18.

The Best presets are for those who want smaller files sizes and need HB to make more refined decisions (since you're using a lower bit rate); their usefulness is negated once you go below 20."
