,maliandro,2012-05-27T14:25Z,"ok i installed this on my win7 rig, game works great audio is flawless great rip.
the issue is i tried installing it on my other winxp rig, im getting an error saying d3d11.dll or somthing of that nature, i think its something to do with xp using directx9 rather than 10 or 11 i was wondering if anybody knows how to fix this?
thanks again kaos for more great work :)"
,nipunb,2012-05-27T16:48Z,"@maliandro: this game doesn't support XP, its official and nothing can be done for this.....
Its absurd coz I have both XP and 7 on my PC, but I mainly use XP, but whenever I play this game, I need to switch to 7 for that...... :("
,maliandro,2012-05-27T17:45Z,"@nipunb thank you for the info, aww guess i will just have to play it on win7 :("
,sahilrox,2012-05-28T07:05Z,Thanks Kaos......great size!!!
,Cerebral222,2012-05-28T09:03Z,"Works well, thanks for the upload gansuk, +1 rep, cheers."
[T],PirateBoy,2012-05-28T09:45Z,Awesome size and awesome rip mate. Any news about the site yet? btw...keep up the great work. Hope you got my mail. :D
,jack.exe,2012-05-28T10:21Z,size is same as that of globeplus hv u uploaded the globeplus release??????????
[T],PirateBoy,2012-05-28T11:37Z,"@ jack.exe

globeplus: 1.38 GB
BLACKBOX: 1.36 GB
KaOs: 1.23 GB

The sizes speak for themselves. No more questions. And in the future, don't ever accuse us (KaOs) of re-uploading someone else's torrent because we do all the stuff ourselves and upload only our stuff.

Peace ^^

well for my problem
When the game repacks i get an error
and i dont know what it means as for the game has no .exe. The file size is 14.4gb and alot of folders are empty. While it repacks i get al level 0 error for what that means i dont know. "
,BRSX,2012-05-28T15:49Z,"Sorry update on my last post..
the final size is 17.7Gb whitch cant be right and also only 8 out of 23 folders has files in them."
[T],PirateBoy,2012-05-28T16:02Z,"@ BRSX

That's because the game has not been able to extract fully on your rig. Delete the current game. Re-install it using the Install.exe file provided and don't stop or delete it half-way. Select a directory where there's near about 20 GiGs of free space. Remember to close your anti-virus software (in case of false-positives) and any other programs while installing. Hope this helps.

Peace

[V],gansuk,2012-05-28T16:36Z,"if that fails, if you can manage to get us the error message that could help."
,BRSX,2012-05-28T18:43Z,OKi ill try. am intalling it now with a 30GB of free space and also unsing the unpack exe

Thnx a lot m8. Credit goes to gansuk for ripping the game so well. Anyways, I forgot to tell ya that sometimes errors and in-game glitches can be fixed by applying another working crack for the game.

Enjoy the game. :)"
[V],gansuk,2012-05-28T21:10Z,glad your happy m8
[V],gansuk,2012-05-28T22:11Z,"on another note i have heard the game may need blocking with firewall, we do it auto as most scene release groups recommend it."
