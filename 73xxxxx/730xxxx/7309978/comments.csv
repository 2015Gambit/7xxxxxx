Four teenage friends move from Minneapolis to Los Angeles to form a potential chart-topping boy band after Kendall is inadvertently discovered by an eccentric record executive, Gustavo Rocque. As they seize this opportunity of a lifetime, these friends embark on an exciting comedy and music-filled journey to prove to themselves and their record label that they are serious about their new career choice. Kendall is a naturally gifted singer with the swagger of a music star, but he agrees to enter ""pop group 101"" so that his friends can go to LA with him. His mother and younger sister also move to California. The rest of the band includes: Carlos, who looks at life as a big playground and this foray into music as an awesome ride with his buddies; James, who has big dreams and confidence in their potential, which helps the other guys deal with difficult moments; Logan, the voice of reason and the brains of the operation, who uses his sharp wit to keep the guys on track. ""Big Time Rush"" features original songs performed by the group under the guidance of Columbia/Epic Label Group. Nickelodeon aired a sneak peek of ""Big Time Rush"" on November 28, 2009, and the series officially premiered on January 18, 2010. (Source: Nickelodeon)
