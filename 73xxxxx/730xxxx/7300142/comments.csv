,Schlongo,2012-07-02T05:28Z,"Hi, I know there are alot of these comments but I promise im not an ignorant ungratefull kid,

Im just curious how I can get this to work with my LG 3d Cinema tv using a usb and my playstation 3?

It only comes up as the side-by-side version and my tv runs the polzarized passive interlaced type of 3d,

If anyone could comment and help me it would be much appreciated.

Thanks :),"
