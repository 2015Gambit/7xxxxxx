The trio format is one of the sternest tests of a saxophonist s mettle, where very note counts and creativity is stretched to the limit, but New York composer and altoist Steve Lehman is more than up to the challenge. A respected educator and one of the most radical ideologues of the contemporary American scene, he has put his music where his mouth is with a string of releases that explore a wide and adventurous palette, from solo electronica to daring ensemble writing. Here he strips things right back, with powerful assistance from drummer Damon Reid and bassist Matt Brewer. Alongside Lehman's own knotty, complex but never obtuse compositions are choice standards from some of his key influences, including Jackie McLean's Mr E and Coltrane's Moment's Notice. It s top-drawer improvisation from beginning to end, and will add further lustre to the reputations of the musicians and of rising independent label, Pi Recordings. - FOUR STARS --Irish Times
