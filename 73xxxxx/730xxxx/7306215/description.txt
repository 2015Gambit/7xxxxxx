How do I get those updates on my XBOX 360 console?

Update your XBOX 360 console to the latest dashboard version
Get yourself an usb stick with at least 1GB capacity
Format it as a XBOX 360 Memory Unit on your XBOX 360 console via 'Dashboard/System/Storage'
Connect your usb stick to your PC
On your pc, download XTAF (Latest Beta). Big thanks go out to Slashr for this great app.
Run XTAF and click on 'File/Open Drive'. Now move to 'Cache Partition/Cache' 
and drag your update files into this folder. This will take some seconds.
Connect your usb stick with the XBOX 360 console and start your game
The next time you want to copy updates to your usb stick, start at 6. 
Your usb stick must be connected with the XBOX 360 console for updates to work.
