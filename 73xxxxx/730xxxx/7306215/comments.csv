It still works for older games like assassin's creed revelations, modern warfare 3. I have LT2. I think I just need to get LT3.0 in order to play the newer games."
[T],Sunblock.,2012-06-20T18:29Z,"I dont think u realy know what the title updates are.
They are updates for the game and it have nothing to do if the game is xgd3  or xgd2....."
