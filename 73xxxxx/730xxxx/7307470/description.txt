Plot: Con-man insurance salesman Mickey, dangerously at the end of his rope after his wife throws him out of the house, learns that an elderly client named Gorvy has an extremely valuable violin in his possession and is not aware of its worth ($25,000). Desperate for money, Mickey builds a friendship with Gorvy based on the possibility of stealing the violin for money. Complications arise when Mickey hires a small time ex-con named Randy to steal the instrument, and realizes he has bitten off more than he can chew.
