,Ashhh1991,2012-05-28T23:47Z,"Itunes downloaded files have some of your personal info (including email) embedded in them.

To remove such info, what many uploaders do is remux the file into mkv. It does not convert anything, it just makes the m4v a mkv file and also removes all embedded info in the file, keeping only the audio and the video.

Here is some info on converting to mkv: http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/doc/mkvmerge-gui.html#muxing

You should read it and remux the file into a mkv for future uploads.

Anyways, thanks bunch for uploading these. My sister loves this show and I usually can't find it anywhere else. "

Who's Your Daddy?
In the season premiere, the drama centers on Khloe's rumored paternity--is she a Kardashian or not? After she puts the kobosh on her mom's insistence on a DNA test, Kris rallies up the family to convince Khloe that she is indeed the daughter of Robert Kardashian, Sr. and not the product of an alleged affair. But will her well-intentioned efforts go too far? Meanwhile, Kourtney is preparing for the birth of her second child, all while scouting a new location for DASH, which doesn't sit too well with Kim when she discovers she's been kept out of the loop. Also feeling frozen out is Bruce, who resorts to extreme measures to get his wife and daughters' attention.

Kendall's Sweet 16
Little Kendall Jenner is turning sixteen, and all she wants for her birthday is a car and a tiny tattoo--but first, she needs to pass her driver's license test and somehow convince the always conservative Bruce to green light her ink plans. Then, there's the matter of a party, and while modest Kendall desires nothing but a small, low-key shindig with her closest pals, Kris wants to throw her daughter a huge, extravagant bash in the Bahamas with 70 friends! As her big day approaches, will Kendall back down and do as her parents say--or will she walk the path of her older siblings and assert her independence?
