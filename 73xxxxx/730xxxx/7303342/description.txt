By using short games as played throughout chess history, the reader can follow chess before popular defences were invented, such as the defence (#167) Remusat used against Napoleon, 0-1,1802 Paris; and readers can also learn solid chess moves such as dazzling sacrifices, picturesque long range mates, and epaulette mates. The book also contains some interesting blind folded plays, correspondence chess, and a few checker games thrown in.
