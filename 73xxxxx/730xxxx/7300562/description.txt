First attempt at this and if anyone can tell me how to take the AD track directly out of a .wtv file I'd be forever in your debt. Since I couldn't do that I played it in VLC and recorded it real time and separately then combined it with the main audio in Audacity.

Anyway, 2 audio tracks, one with the audio description. I suggest playing in VLC and choosing the track you want.

Not sure how much demand there is for these kind of torrents, as for why this movie, it just happened to be the first I noticed actually HAD the audio description that I've recorded.
