,rabs75,2012-06-03T17:42Z,can someone help? its asking for a serial during installation
,.morden,2012-06-05T11:08Z,"@rabs75: You need to read the instructions, there is a keygen on the CD as well as a few serials listed in the .nfo file which can be opened with notepad if you don't have an nfo viewer installed."
,rabs75,2012-06-08T01:35Z,"Hey morden, thanks man, it works. i didnt know what an nfo file was, thanks again!"
,.morden,2012-06-11T02:40Z,"rabs75: no worries, enjoy."
,Vaswik,2012-06-25T21:24Z,Can anyone confirm this isn't a Trojan
,.morden,2012-06-26T14:47Z,"@Vaswik: The keygen is clean, i did mention this on the expansion torrent, its a false positive due to the way reloaded locked down the exe. however if you are really concerned just get a key from the .nfo file. "
,kahchi,2012-07-08T16:59Z,where is the iso or which one do i click open with demon tools or power iso please reply  
,.morden,2012-07-08T17:53Z,@kahchi: the images are in bin+cue format so open the .cue files with daemon tools which will load the .bin files. if daemon tools isn't already associated with .cue files go into preferencesintegration and check the box for .cue or hit select all button.
