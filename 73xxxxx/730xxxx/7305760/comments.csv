,jumjumb,2012-05-28T15:02Z,"This doesn't work. 

1. Create a directory or a .zip/.rar/dmg-file
2. Create a .torrent-file with the result of 1.
with Îź-torrent its the keystroke: cmd+N 
or via the Menu File/New Torrent
-add directory or file
-click on 'create and save as'
-give it a name
-click 'OK'
3. Login at thepiratebay
4. go to your settings
5. upload the .torrent-file

The .torrent-file and the source must remain at their place on your PC.

Hope this helps.  :^)"
