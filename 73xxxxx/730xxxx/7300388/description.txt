ItΓÇÖs no exaggeration to state that the entertainment world was shaken by the sudden passing of Davy Jones on February 29 of this year, responding not only with an outpouring of grief, but with genuinely fond memories of the actor, singer and Monkee. Friday Music is joining Rhino Entertainment in keeping JonesΓÇÖ rich legacy of music alive, with two new releases slated for April 24. After having recently reissued JonesΓÇÖ pre-Monkees debut, the label turns its attention to JonesΓÇÖ 1971-1972 recordings for the Bell Records label, featuring the hit ΓÇ£Rainy JaneΓÇ¥ as well as ΓÇ£Girl,ΓÇ¥ the song immortalized on The Brady Bunch. But thatΓÇÖs not all. On the same day as DavyΓÇÖs The Bell Recordings 1971-1972, Friday will reissue The MonkeesΓÇÖ 1987 reunion album Pool It! in an expanded edition boasting two bonus tracks and a DVD.

The first twelve tracks on The Bell Recordings represent the complete 1971 Davy Jones album, on which Neil Sedaka and Howard GreenfieldΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Rainy Jane,ΓÇ¥ a No. 52 hit for the singer. (SedakaΓÇÖs own 1969 version achieved some measure of popularity in Australia in the period between his early RCA hits and Rocket Records comeback.) The Bell era is also notable for JonesΓÇÖ appearance on the Brady Bunch episode ΓÇ£Getting Davy Jones,ΓÇ¥ but Jones also kept a high profile via television guest spots on Love American Style, Here Come the Brides and even The New Scooby-Doo Movies! Davy Jones was arranged and conducted by Al Capps, who also worked with Bobby Sherman, Andy Williams and Cher, and carried on the lighter sound of the MonkeesΓÇÖ repertoire rather than that bandΓÇÖs later sonic explorations. The twelve tracks from Davy Jones are augmented by six bonus tracks: the mono singles ΓÇ£GirlΓÇ¥ b/w ΓÇ£Take My LoveΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£IΓÇÖll Believe in YouΓÇ¥ b/w ΓÇ£Road to Love,ΓÇ¥ plus album tracks ΓÇ£How About MeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£I Really Love You,ΓÇ¥ also both in mono.
