In this torrent you find the first 18 years of publications of the 

Agroforestry Research Trust(ART). http://www.agroforestry.co.uk/



The Agroforestry Research Trust (ART) is a non-profit making charity, 

registered in England, which researches into temperate agroforestry 

and into all aspects of plant cropping and uses, with a focus on tree, 

shrub and perennial crops.



We have made this knowledge public because in our opinion it is too 

important to not have this information freely available. However we 

also believe that the Agroforestry Research Trust is very important so 

we kindly ask everybody with an interest in this information to 

support the Agroforestry Research Trust in whatever way they can. 



Buy some books, seeds or plants or buy these magazine`s in paper form 

for example. So that the ART can continue to do it`s important 

research.
