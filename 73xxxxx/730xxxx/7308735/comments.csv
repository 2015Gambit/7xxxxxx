2-This backup was created by using HP Backup utility, so it would just restore to factory default,just like the moment you bought it.
No extra progs.This is not a custom windows or unattended version.It is the backup image of the whole drive, restored using HP own utility."
,medicohelp,2012-06-10T21:52Z,"I 'd like to add a point here:
Restoring by this HP original method is time consuming .
There is a more sleek, faster and more professional using acronis true image restore method.
But I uploaded this because it is more Generic and more supported by HP.
After restoration, you can make acronis backup image on DVDs, or network and viola.Just my 2 cents."

thank u very much"
