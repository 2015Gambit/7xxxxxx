HP Pavilion dv6-6c65sx Entertainment Notebook PC 

I made the backup dvd using the HP recovery creation tool just after I bought it

Sharing this might save someone's notebook some hassle.

I should declare that HP should have them included in the box.
But, here they are.


Enjoy and seed well
