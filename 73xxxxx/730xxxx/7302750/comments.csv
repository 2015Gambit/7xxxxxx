,starjim,2012-05-27T03:38Z,So? anyone who can tell hows this dvdrip quality??
,Tankerbot,2012-05-27T04:28Z,"It's been encoded down to a smaller size so it suffers from quality loss form that. But it is indeed a real DVD rip. There's English subtitles for the German parts, so it's already miles ahead of the cam release from earlier. :D"
