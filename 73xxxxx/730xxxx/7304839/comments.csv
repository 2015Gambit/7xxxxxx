,climax708,2012-05-28T00:17Z,Sorry if something's going weird. First torrent; figuring out the system.
,Tessan91,2012-05-29T19:29Z,"Just one thing, could you upload the 5 specials that where between season 4 and 5?
You know the ones with ""Waters of Mars"" among other?
Other than that, thank you"
,CFPirate,2012-06-02T20:41Z,"Took forever to download completely, but it's very worth it. The videos seem to be of decent quality and I'm ecstatic to finally have this series!

Allons-y and seed this for everyone else :]"
,climax708,2012-06-14T18:18Z,"Glad to be of help.
PS: I'd like to give credit to everyone who contributed. This torrent is basically a re-pack & re-brand of many torrents found here on TPB.
My goal here is to provide a standard place to go to in order to get any doctor who you wish, with the best quality I can find.
I'm a Doctor Who fan, so you can be sure I'm up to date.
Expect the torrent to be deleted & re-uploaded with new episodes when a season ends or the series pause."
,climax708,2012-07-14T17:20Z,NOTICE: I'm well aware of the fact that some of the specials years are mis-labeled. This will be fixed when I upload a new torrent.
,AeroJus,2012-08-03T18:22Z,"Can you add the episodes 14-18 from season 4 to this? http://watchseries.eu/serie/doctor_who
They are, The Next Doctor, Planet of the Dead, The Waters of Mars, The end of time, and the end of time part two."
