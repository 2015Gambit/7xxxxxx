[T],johnpc666,2012-05-29T15:43Z,"It's a re encode from the full size 720p compressed to save peoples bandwidth with little loss of quality and far better than the same sized dvd rip.

it also says its a re encode in the notes, please read before posting swear word."

,PAWZ76,2012-05-30T15:12Z,"Great quality, thanks @johnpc666. 
MKV RULES! 
This is uncropped, which is also better than all the high seed cropped versions out.

For Eng subs including the missing parts at 7-14 minutes in: http://subscene.com/english/The-Raid-Redemption-Serbuan-maut/subtitle-583854.aspx
(they sometimes overlap the hard subs a little but are still readable)"

@johnpc666 - just wanted to say thank you very much indeed for this fine upload. Everything was absolutely perfect and I really appreciate the effort.

For all else, I didn't look at the subs on this rip, like PAW I got my own from http://subscene.com/english/The-Raid-Redemption-Serbuan-maut/subtitle-583588.aspx and they were spot on."
,justregged,2012-06-01T14:56Z,Watched this last night great job all round+1

,skunkfreaker,2012-06-21T04:49Z,absolutely brilliant.  a superb upload if ever there was one.
,antijohn,2012-07-17T10:34Z,"movie has hardcoded korean (I think) and english subs although the subs aren't very good. Tim Dawg's link has excellent subs, although (like the original subs) they do overlap the korean subs but it's still somewhat legible and easy to understand. Quality is fantastic. "
