thanks for the UL. I have an issue that occurs when i start the RS.exe. I never gives me the option to ""Never Register"" nor can I see it visible anywhere. Have you come across the problem before? Thanks"

Thank you for providing such an easy installation method for the masses."
,kphzorz,2012-07-03T17:50Z,"man, thanks so much for all of the work you've put into this and all the time you've spent compiling these language packs.

you really are helping a lot of people"
,comradek,2012-07-17T10:52Z,"I feel so silly now, I wasn't aware of the meaning of the level system. Level 3 is high school level(more or less), and everything higher than that is typically only used by a small percentile of the Japanese people (those with high profile jobs, politicians and the like)

Which is why most Japanese retailers don't want to sell you levels 4 and 5, since it's not really necessary. I also learned that if you tell them that you're going to a reeeeally far out place in japan with few English speakers for your anniversary/honeymoon, they'll sell them to you. Best to mention that you can't afford to get screwed over language-wise, and that you'll both be there for a bit."
