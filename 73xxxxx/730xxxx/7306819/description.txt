One of the best Almodovar.

I'm not one for synopsys. I'll just say this is a must watch, funny and 

fresh.

Technical aspects :

The video was encoded according to AVCHD specifications so I guess a 

DVD-R readable by your Blu-Ray player is doable.

VIDEO :

The source is HD DVB-T (1920p), its quality close to a potential BluRay, 

(also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted!). Very few and almost 

unnoticable imperfections because of the reception (which was close to 

perfect), they should not be a concern.
