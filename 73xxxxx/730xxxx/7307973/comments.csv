,hassebassie,2012-05-30T14:13Z,It says Lame mp3. So no flac.
,Johnnycable,2012-05-30T20:11Z,I was hoping maybe there would be a flac upload...Joe Walsh Rocks!
,resmith,2012-06-04T18:49Z,Another great job by Joe the man. Thanks. Hey Joe visit some smaller cities while your on tour for this & I'll drop a couple hundred on tickets. 
,soundtech,2012-06-07T21:05Z,Joe is probably not checking Pirate Bay for messages about tour advice.

Just wish somebody will upload it in FLAC.
Otherwise I will do it when I get the CD I ordered ;)"
