The Queen's Blade: Rebellion game books serve as a sequel to the original Queen's Blade game books, which are Japanese spinoffs from Flying Buffalo's Lost Worlds game series. In combat picture book games, players simulate turn-based fighting with books that each represent a character.
The story is set four years after the first storyline and revolves around Annelotte, the rebelling knight princess who stands up to the tyranny of the new queen. The Rebellion storyline already inspired two prologue original video anime DVDs that are being bundled with the Queen's Blade Premium Visual Books.
