I'm just surprised how many want the daily episodes. I'm not trying to steal your thunder !!

I started to upload them for a friend in Norway, and I didn't expect anyone else to want them.

I used to send her copies of the omnibus by post every week, then she discovered TPB and talk me into uploading the daily episodes. 
Now I'm stuch with doing it four times a week.

She promises that one day she will reward me fo my efforts, but I'm still waiting !!
