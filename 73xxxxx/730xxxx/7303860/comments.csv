YIFI always great quality."
,Nyghtstalker,2012-06-03T19:30Z,"Yify,

This is the second movie I have downloaded from you, this is Journey 2, that I have had a problem with the movie. Whenever I play the movie it is split down the middle showing the same movie at the same time. Do you know anything about this and how to fix it? I really would like to watch them but it is hard to do when the movie is like this. Thanks!"
,Skeiron,2012-06-04T14:12Z,"@Nyghtstalker its a 3d movie (says in title), two images like that is called Side-by-Side and can be viewed in stereoscopic if you have a capable monitor/tv"
,Skeiron,2012-06-04T14:13Z,oh and thanks Yify for another fantastic upload...
,davin_g,2012-06-21T06:04Z,I have a question. All of YIFYs videos are all pixalated after I burn them and watch them on my Samsung Tv. I use visual hub to convert and burn. Is it just his videos are low quality or is there a trick when burning 3d movies because all other movies I burn the quality is fine. TY YIFY...just wondering if I'm the one doing something wrong.
,Deathven,2012-08-01T10:11Z,Do I need a 3D player to play this?
,RaidDeamon,2012-08-04T12:29Z,@ skeiron thank you for pointing that out i was having the same problem but my question is whats the fix if you dont have that capability
,mbisdagame1,2012-08-25T16:41Z,"All these comments and no Facking A/V?

What a bunch of newfag twats, same asshats on every one of YIFY's torrents, complaining about how small the file size is and how its not ""true HD"" or ""read 1080"". Go run into a wall with a knife you tossers, I enjoy the quality and the small file size...bigger torrents exist, download those...or buy the phucking blu-ray you white jews."
,Wellsj,2012-09-05T08:40Z,"Cheers Yify

mbisdagame1 where's your A/V then you silly black cunt?
