Hey guys, this is the latest and greatest Mathematica by the same folks that created the Wolfram Alpha we all know and love :) (It's 32 and 64bit in the same archive, apparently, please correct me if wrong)

This is a single large self-extracting shell script, downloaded straight from Wolfram's site. Via the included keygen (a windows app unfortunately) the key is generated and you can use Mathematica at full blast, indefinitely.

Please remember though, if you like it and use it, buy it when you have the funds..

** Note: I'm doing this off my laptop, so if the seed vanishes, use an ultraviolet light. Or, just wait a little while and I'll have it up again within 12hrs **
