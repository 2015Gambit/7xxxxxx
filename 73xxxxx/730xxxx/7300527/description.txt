FUTURE OF DUBSTEP 2014

ULTIMATE ELECTRONIC MUSIC 
 

Been a long time coming, hope u enjoy this one
it pretty much covers every genre of electronic music 
from raw dubstep to electro to dance electro to drumnbass  to glictchstep 
to drumstep to disco dub to electro rock to ambient to hard core house 

and everything in between 

THIS is the future what our kids will be listening to, its summarizes the genre above what it is
what it will be, even if you dont understand it all one day it will be everywhere 
with rock and country dead , and rap pretty much out the way with only minor hip hop 
Electronic has really taken over 2012 and beyond

this is the future
