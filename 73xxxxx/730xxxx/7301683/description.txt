Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml  ).
Then, you can use ".cbr" files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
