On  the subject of Wmw and Mp4 files being combined,is there a way to separate them for download? Having a slow connection it takes too long with large files over 2 Gib."
,shallow2,2012-05-27T15:05Z,"@mafiadog: On Utorrent, and I believe most torrent clients, there is the option to select which files not to download.
It is abit more difficult with magnet links, but it works none the less. This is for Utorrent, if you are using another client, pls post which one , and other useres who use the same one can telll you how it is done there if different.

After utorrent has resolved the filelist from the magnet link, click on the files tab on the bottom and you get a list of all the files in torrent. Then just right click on the MP4 and select 'do not download'. Then just open dl folder and delete the partial mp4 file if it has already started a few mb's.

Hope this helps.

It saves alot of time, and seeds alot faster/better when we include everything in one torrent.

Enjoy the Kink man! :)"

I remember few years back with bittorrent which I don't use anymore, there was that option to choose. Never mind will have to live with it,once again thank you for all the fantastic ups to both of you."

,chaostastic,2012-05-30T00:40Z,"Thanks for possible an interesting TTOO finally. TTOO is really going downhill IMHO. 

TTOO is too often more like a sporting event than a sexual adventure like it used to be. Once in a while it heats up so I'm still keeping an eye.

Big Hand! Thank you!"
