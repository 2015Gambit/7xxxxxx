Discovery fucked this episode up in a bad way which is
why this isn't tagged proper. KILLERS release is missing
1min 40sec of footage somewhere. I can't be arsed to find
out where exactly when it's not a proper. Look at it as 
more some kind of info for those interested. 

They also left their rip at 29.97 and since so many frames 
are blended if you skip frame by frame there are no exact
dupes, just excess amount of blended frames.

So what it comes down to is picking between two evils 
really. We chose to ivtc since it save some bitrate for 
more important places and to be in unison with E02 and
the rest of the series, hopefully.

Playback is unsmooth in both cases and some blending
will always be there. It is just a bit less in our rip
and in our opinion the viewing experience is better.
It's just a matter of taste because both are far from
perfect. But at least this one is complete.
