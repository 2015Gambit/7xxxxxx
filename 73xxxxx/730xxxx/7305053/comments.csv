,ephrsim,2012-06-29T18:16Z,Brillliant stuff mate! Thanks a lot!
,Laka2,2012-07-13T23:04Z,An mp3 version? Who cares? It's fantastic album but an mp3 listener will not get anything of it! If you don't have the vinyl and an LP12 at least do a Flac. This is just meaningless.

I love when ungrateful bitches complain when they get things for free. Not to mention the fact that you haven't uploaded ANYTHING. Do us all a favor and jump off the tallest building closest to you. 

Thanks disnoxxio for the great upload!"
