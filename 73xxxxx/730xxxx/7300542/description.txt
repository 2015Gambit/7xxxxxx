The catch? Delivering it to a killer as elusive as a nightmare and so feared that the entire Underworld trembles at the mention of his name. In a business that asks no questions, The Courier (Jeffrey Dean Morgan - Watchmen, The Losers), is the best there is and with the life of his only family held to ransom there's no way he's missing this drop. Hounded by hit men and hustlers, double-dealing feds and double-crossing accomplices, the courier embarks on an impossible journey that ultimately unravels his own murky past.
