2. what coder?"
,manaze,2012-06-15T22:45Z,"For advanced Size compression, to the max for easy uploading, WMV .  IF u want a faster conversion time, adequate compression, AVI.

I use a few programs every time I release a new episodes, including PINNACLE and sony vegas.  I have recently moved to 25,000kb/s bit rate, which is higher end 1080P, But i have the available storage space in which to do so."

,opengirl,2012-08-02T05:49Z,"Hey, I feel like a newbie here, but I can't get this torrent to work.  I click on it, and it says 'launch application', but it won't launch utorrent (I have the most recent update). I have opened utorrent and can't figure out what to do from there.  I've been using this site for years, so I'm very confused.  

Tried to register in the forums to ask for help there, but it asks for image verification but wont' give me an image...  Tried 3 different browsers to see if any of them would work.  No joy...I'm going nuts here!  Help!"
,opengirl,2012-08-08T04:38Z,"Okay, thanks Manaze... figured it out and got the torrent working.  Fantastic, thank you."
,manaze,2012-08-08T06:13Z,im debating on whether or not to add a seed box.
