Crime Scene Australia - DiscoveryChan Docu Series (2008) (3 extra episodes added and all Aspects fixed from 4:3 to 16:10 widescreen)

A re-upp of this series with 3 more episodes (backpackers and kids for ransom and kimberley killer) and fixed screen sizing
they werent nonWS Non-Widescreen 4:3 but were wide screen
ripped wrongly.. but they not 16:9 as they would looked too wide..
but the correct aspect seemed to be 16:10

so I decided to fix them and unpack the headers without re-encoding
so heres the result.

also fixed up the naming of episode 2

Those Snowtown killers were brutal.. and they got of easy for the crimes.

help to seed if grabbing.. cheers

enjoy
