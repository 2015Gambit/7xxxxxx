[edit] Production

The series is produced by Graham McNeice Productions of Moore Park NSW. In a 2008 interview McNeice said the impetus for the series was to provide an element of local content to a channel (Foxtel) that is dominated by American and European crime stories.[3]

The series (often abbreviated to CIA) examines some of Australia's most shocking and infamous crimes. It includes interviews from victims, loved ones and the investigators who brought the criminals to justice. These crimes are further examined by re-enactments shot in the actual locations where the crimes took place.

Foxtel announced that the series would be ""rested"" for 2010. However, on 9 November 2010 Crime Investigation Australia series four premiered under the name CIA: Families of Crime.
