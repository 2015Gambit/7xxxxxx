This is the complete set of The Matrix web comics series 1 thru 3 collected from The Matrix website before it was closed down. 
The series later went to print and was published in 2 volumes which introduced 3 new stories that were never posted on the website. 
In the early days of the website there was a very short story called The Man Who Knew Too Much which was removed from the website for unknown reasons.
