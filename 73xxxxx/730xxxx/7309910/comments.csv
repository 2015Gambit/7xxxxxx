With its stirring soundtrack and commanding narration, it's initially unclear whether this documentary is supposed to enlighten or terrorise. Beneath our feet lies our greatest enemy, it begins. Suddenly we're falling down a coalmine in America's Midwest, marvelling at the fossilised plants that cover the ceiling. To understand how they got there, we have to go back 300 million years - and, thanks to clever computer-generated footage, we can. What follows is an informative account of our very own journey to the centre of the earth via 6000 kilometres of rock.
