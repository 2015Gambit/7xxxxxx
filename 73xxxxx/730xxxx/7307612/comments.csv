If I could be so bold, are you ever planning to up the UNremastered DVD versions of classic Star Trek with the original FX? Those have now become very difficult to find in good quality rips, but they are an important piece of history, and I can't think of a person I would rather see do it than you.

Big load of thanks regardless!"

I'm looking forward to the last two movies for S4 and Season 5!"

I'm really looking forward to the next to specials, but most of all season 5! Please do upload s05, I can't find it ANYWHERE with 5.1 sound.
You're the best, thank you very much!"
