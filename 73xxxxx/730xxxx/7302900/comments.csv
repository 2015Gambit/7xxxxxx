,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-27T05:32Z,"@gkha,

Sorry, I don't, but I'll look for it.

Please let me know if the speech section doesn't work correctly, 
apparently when I created some of the previous torrents, the speech files were omitted."
,gkha,2012-05-27T08:35Z,"I've used your Mandarin one, and I believe I'm using your Latin American Spanish one as well, and I have no trouble using the speech, if you mean the ability to speak into the mic and lesson.  

Thanks so much!  I'll keep a look on for your torrents and if you do manage to upload it, many thanks ahead of time!"
,zippy1947,2012-05-28T11:50Z,"thanks again so much. I have korean and english installed and they both work, even if i can't figure out how to use them! hahahaha...

any chance you have Thai hanging around?"
,YodaBoy44,2012-05-30T05:52Z,Is this American or British English? Thanks for all of you hard work!!
,EinDeutschMan,2012-05-30T06:29Z,"YodaBoy44,
This version is American, but I also have British"
,xpert10,2012-06-04T13:37Z,"British English would be great. I already have levels 1,2,3 but can't get levels 4 and 5. Can you upload them pls? Thx a lot"

Sorry, I don't have levels 4 or 5 either."

,daco100,2012-06-09T13:43Z,"I took off the torrent, but can not open any level, did I need a program that opens the file RSI?"

,Rich2B181,2012-07-21T04:34Z,"am downloading at the moment. Thanks so much! You are one of the reasons why internet piracy is so good, and exhilirating! :D"
