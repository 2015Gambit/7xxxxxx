,Glenn1963,2012-05-28T17:18Z,"People are so quick to start hurling insults, so I'll just point out the line near the top where it says ""Spoken language(s): English"" and let OwiecPL draw his own conclusions."
,OwiecPL,2012-05-29T10:34Z,Of course in an Indonesian movie they will speak English. They spoke English in the trailer didn't they? ... Reading and thinking goes together.

,vivatpb5776,2012-08-13T15:52Z,"Very good video quality but, as others have stated, spoken language is NOT English. It does not appear to be dubbed so my guess is that the spoken language is the original Indonesian language."
