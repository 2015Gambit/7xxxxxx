,TabascoQuesadilla,2012-05-28T23:30Z,"Because the ""i"" just means it's interlaced, while ""p"" means progressive.

Since this was shot progressive (24fps) and not interlaced, the 1080i version is the same as the 1080p, but with 3:2 pulldown applied to get it to 30fps interlaced.

You can then remove the 3:2 pulldown to return it to its original 24fps, non-interlaced, at full 1080 resolution.

Hence, 1080i -> 1080p.

It's the same way people get 720p from 1080i.

You can't do this for programs that are shot interlaced, obviously; those are locked at 1080i, 480i, or 576i (there is no 720i)."
