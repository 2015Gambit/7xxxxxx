"Hollywood Stunt Pilot, Corkey Fornof said it best in an article written for Autopilot Magazine:

I was curious about the name Prometheus so I had to look it up in Greek Mythology.
I discovered it means "Forethought." Prometheus was a rebel titan who displeased Zeus by taking from him and giving to the people of earth the power of fire. The name matches the paint design with its hot rod style flame job, the show with its snarling, flashy manoeuvres and Skip's forethought in his crowd pleasing routine.

Prometheus the flying machine is part Pitts Special and the rest Skip and Christina Stewart. Starting life as a Pitts S-2S, Prometheus was modified to give Skip the airshow machine he wanted. This flying machine looks like a good old American hot rod. The horsepower was increased to 400HP, the big three bladed prop reminds you of oversized racing slicks, the rear canted landing gear makes it look fast sitting on the ground and the paint job yells 'Street Rod.'"

Designed and developed by Owen Hewitt in collaboration with Skip Stewart Airshows, this rendition of Prometheus is a true treat to fly for all aerobatic fans!
