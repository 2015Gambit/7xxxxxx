,Neraforesta,2012-05-28T06:14Z,would be perfect if subs wouldnt cut in and out. But perfect picture. V9 A4
,dean2804,2012-05-28T06:35Z,"There are subs available on the net. Only problem is they're translated from Croatian to English so they're probably a bit off. Better than nothing though and you'll have an idea of what's going on. It's all about the action anyway.

I tried to post a link but for some reason it wouldn't let me. Just Google it."
,mortuustuna,2012-05-28T06:53Z,"""Spoken language(s):English""

Actually not, spoken language is Indonesian.
Otherwise great copy. Does include subs but they cut in and out.
tbh not understanding the language wont really stop you enjoying this movie, excellent action.

many thanks uploader"

,goofy113,2012-05-29T00:34Z,"The Subs i posted works just fine!

the quality of the translation can however be disscussed. 

its crappy english yes, som single words in some sentences another lang than eng, 
but overall understandable. 
and as such a hell of a lot better than nothing
im giving you something atleast....

between 07 min mark and 14 min mark there isnt any subs, im guessing they were lazy and didnt translate that part.

so if you skip forward to 14 min you will see the subs again, this is why some say the subs dont work after 8 min. it works fine just isnt translated from 7 to 14 min mark.

should have posted this along with the link
but was in a hurry and wanted to share it b4 i went on an errand :D"
,int7777,2012-05-29T04:58Z,"goofy is right the subs don't work for about 7 minutes, but after that point they reappear. The part of the movie where there are no subs there is not much being said anyway aside from that conversation with the gray haired guy."
,int7777,2012-05-29T05:05Z,"p.s. I searched everywhere for a better copy of english subtitles, but these are the best ones. much better than nothing and after the subs reappear you forget that any where missing. the missing subs aren't at all vital to understanding what is going on in the movie."
,ALuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,2012-05-29T11:24Z,"It's weird how Romanian perfect subs came out so soon before the english ones.

Anyway the movie's looking awesome and I have to say, that this is the best action movie of the decades."

The widescreen format used in this released was achieved by cropping the top and bottom of the video, so around 30% of the picture is missing.

If you're okay with this, download away, otherwise look for a different release."
