Yup agreed FADE/DEGRADE in implemented. But no big deal as I only use torrents as demos and buy it if I like it. And if you want mod and patch support you're gonna have to buy it anyway. I love the ARMA series and have bought all of the sims and addons and will buy this as well. 

Waiting for a crack is waste of time and won't work with future patches and mods etc anway. Also (and I don't mean you personally) unlike most, I do support and buy products from good developers and just delete the downloaded games I don't like. Like I said I only use torrents as a demos I do not just steal em."

,ArmutAsil,2012-05-27T13:39Z,"The first impression : This game the best II.WW shooter i ever seen, full of brilliant idea, nice graphic, huge open range, not just ""run forward first person shoot/shit"".

The second impression (after 30 min) : This is worst II. WW shooter i ever seen, full of  overly complicated idea and annoying bugs. A control is also nightmare. This is rather a half maded beta test, not a final ""shop release"".

Conclusion: Maybe a fifty-sixth patch make more playable a game, but until...just a crap. Promising, but crap."

Before scene, run out of ammo the bazooka shit, ( i hit the tank 4time) and not happened something. What can i do for?! Finally just skip the scene somehow - deus ex machine?!

,Zipgun,2012-05-27T23:00Z,"Don't you dudes fucking read! Its FADE/DEGRADE that's making the character not move, unmoving crap and or no accuracy with weapons etc etc etc. I mean this fucking shit has been around since the original ARMA. Get with the fucking times these ""BUGS"" are the Anti-Piracy safeguards kicking in. 

I bought the game and it works fine. And shit  the game only cost a measly freaking $29 bucks.  When it comes down to it BIS owns pirates as if you want to use any 3rd party mods, campaigns, missions or later official patches? you're gonna have to buy it."

,elasar.bt,2012-05-29T17:56Z,"SbeebK, my bad! I don't hear about FADE until now.
But I still have a good life without this information. And this game is still a boring sh.t, because training missions is mandatory. I begin to play shooters with Blackstone and Doom, when you was just a gonade in your father scrotum. I don't want to learn again and again to use my mouse and how to run. Virgins like you is  easy to impress by a beautiful graphics. Is a lot of work, indeed, but is in vain. For exemple, your parents work a lot to create you, but the result is    a deception. "
,Asghan,2012-05-29T19:33Z,"Training missions are mandatory because people like you can't even be botherd to read 3 lines of text to learn about something, but why would you need to read anything you have played doom, well i guess that entitles you to act like a clueless prick, maybe you should go back to playing doom and leave games like this one to people who enjoy military simulators.


Also i guess most people miss this:
6. Support the software developers. If you like this game, BUY IT
This is one of messages nearly every scene group places in their readmes along with the instructions on how to run the game, so people saying buy the game if you enjoy it aren't much off the mark."
,carcas72,2012-05-29T20:38Z,"To skip the training missions, do this: Press left shift + numpad minus, then write 'endmission'. This will also work in the real missions."
,illkillU,2012-05-30T00:37Z,"Well done as always extremezon
Very fun and interesting game, maybe a little more for the extreme player, or in other words, it is for the player who is able to withstand long time playing and has more of a tactical thinking ... very fun on LaN-play too,,,"
,Ahetulla,2012-05-30T18:54Z,"The game works fine other than the white grass.  There are a few bugs but the game is playable.  In my opinion not worth buying.  Maybe the game companies should put out better games without any crack bugs and people would buy them.  That is one statistic they don't tell you about in the pirate community.  I have purchased many games after playing them.   I can't tell you how many times I bought a lemon in a box in the past and spent thousands of dollars on utter crap.  Games like call of duty 3, Crysis, Half Life 2, etc are all worth buying.  Unfortunately I can't say I would buy this one just deleted it today.  Smarten up DEEP SILVER!"
,elasar.bt,2012-05-30T21:24Z,"ashgan, yes, this is a military simulation, not a crappy game. Also you are a smart school boy, not an frustrated virgin, with a ""four words only"" vocabulary. So, play this, don't stop. "
,Dimmis80,2012-05-31T06:59Z,First of all a million thanks goes to our best uploader @extremezone for an another awesome upload..Bravo mate.:-)Now about people that say about Fade anti piracy thing there is not such a thing.!!I manage to complete the training mission and i play now my first mission.It just need patience and u will do that to.Btw for games like that simulation is better to play then in Easy mode because of the dyfficulty and stuff.All good.Cheers.

,evils007,2012-06-09T13:41Z,cd key plz...............................
,ivandksd,2012-06-16T04:26Z,If fade is activated it maybe because the installer detects the program that mounts the game image (daemon tools most usually). To avoid this you should try the guide in this torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6433693 (it is for ARMA 2 REINFORCEMENTS but should work for this to). Look for the comments also: there are many different ways to fool the detection system but the most used are: 1) use Alcohol 52% + latest version of A.C.I.D. 2) Make the IDE Virtual Drive attach to the a physical IDE Drive (using Daemon Tools Pro or  Virtual CD 10).
,Kentaco,2012-06-16T23:41Z,Seed please really slow
,ivandksd,2012-06-17T19:18Z,"I think i know why FADE activates... Skidrow did the same mistake when they released ARMA 2 Reinforcements... For the game to install properly as i said before you need to make an exact copy from the disc, using software like Alcohol 120% or CloneDVD. What is obviously not done right in this release (and in every release so far i think). Why? because the crack is added inside the game image!! so, every time you install the game the setup software makes something like a checksum from the disc and detects that it has been modified. To make a proper copy the DVD should have been cloned and the crack should have been added in another file, or actually there is no need for crack if the copy is properly made. Many people (even the crackers) think that the game is working ok because they try it a little and every thing looks fine; but the problem is that fade not always activates instantly, instead it makes a progressive game degrade making the game experience worst over the time until it is just unplayable... "
,brutal_product,2012-06-20T05:05Z,"Thanks for the game extremezone/RELOADED. Shit happens with the fade/degrade, that's fine, someone will fix it, but for fuck's sake. PLEASE change the serial key in the serial.txt . I went to install it and saw the 1111-, etc, and knew it was crap, and came here hoping for a good one. This is the second or third release with that fuct-up serial. I know, many games can utilize the 'random serial"" or ""all 1's"", but there's 4 sets of four, and again, third release that has required 5 set's of numbers. It's not a crazy big deal for someone who knows what they're doing, but it makes the rls groups look like idiots, much more than a bad crack. keep up the good work tho, always love your stuff! :)"
