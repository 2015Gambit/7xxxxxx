24 hours in L.A.; it's raining cats and dogs. Two parallel and intercut 
stories dramatize men about to die: both are estranged from a grown child, 
both want to make contact, and neither child wants anything to do with 
dad. Earl Partridge's son is a charismatic misogynist; Jimmy Gator's 
daughter is a cokehead and waif. A mild and caring nurse intercedes 
for Earl, reaching the son; a prayerful and upright beat cop meets 
the daughter, is attracted to her, and leads her toward a new calm. 
Meanwhile, guilt consumes Earl's young wife, while two whiz kids, 
one grown and a loser and the other young and pressured, face their 
situations. The weather, too, is quirky.ΓÇª
