,Rob2042,2012-05-27T15:10Z,Another title from TvTeam I can`t find on IMDB.  Why can`t you simply include a link to the movie you upload?
,jjungclaus,2012-05-27T17:04Z,I think it might be this move Rob2042 but not sure! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1429382/
,Silkenrune,2012-05-27T18:53Z,I thinbk this TVSpamteam stuff is done with a bott...like Scenspambalance...just cheap sloppy advertizing for users to thier sites. I think it is the Alien opponent as it was just posted a few days or so ago. TVspamteam just took it and repackaged it.
