,mikemundzy,2012-05-26T07:32Z,what happened to round 2 of the first fight???
,harolddruken,2012-05-26T07:39Z,Missing 2nd round of 1st fight and results/interviews of 2nd fight.
,nycdj,2012-05-26T08:26Z,"yeah, missing round 2 kinda sucks a wasted download"
,usethisusethis,2012-05-26T08:47Z,"this looks bad, the video gets all blockey every 5 seconds.  Forgive me for not seeding and recycling it but I'll keep the rudos when it comes up."
,screamatorium,2012-05-26T10:35Z,2nd week in a row where the deciding round is cut.
,SinAppz,2012-05-26T12:07Z,"The video is corrupted and it messes up VLC.  To watch the second fight, you must quit VLC, and then fast forward to the second fight.  If you just try to fast forward to the second fight, it will be all messed up once you hit the corrupt data right after the first fight."
,BTMas2k,2012-05-26T13:12Z,"...as with all the SirPaul releases I've tried to date, this copy is totally unwatchable for the reasons everyone have already stated.  Also, if you plan on converting this file to a different format to overcome its problems, good luck... end result either fails or turns out worse, with audio/video blocking up enough to make anybody in their right mind wait for a properly coded rip.  "
,BTMas2k,2012-05-26T13:15Z,"...and don't just say I need VLC, because that's total crap.  If you tell me the video you rip only works tenuously on a single player with built-in codecs, I'd tell you to figure out how to do it NOT wrong."
,The2nduck,2012-05-26T14:16Z,to all of you who likw to see the video just go to ufc site. diveo->tuf>chap 11 ..problme over
,Woogy,2012-05-26T14:30Z,"Missing 2nd round of first fight and comments and conclussion to the second fight...  :( 

other than that the quality is fine."
,topdawg89,2012-05-26T15:32Z,should nuke this one.  Missing ends of both fights why bother?
,chaiyont2,2012-05-26T17:31Z,Don't bother. This is shit. Try Rudos
,Got_Bud,2012-05-26T18:26Z,"Don't bother. NUKED. Like everyone else is saying. Was looking forward to these too.
Great I know who wins in the first fight but couldn't see the KO. LAME!!!"
,peteford,2012-05-26T19:23Z,YOU ARE TERRIBLE. STOP UPLOADING GARBAGE TORRENTS.  SERIOUSLY DONT BOTHER UPING CORRUPTED FILES.  IT'S A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MINE.  JONES VS EVANS WAS SCREWED UP TOO.  I HOPE YOU STUB YOUR TOE.  
,arathanstorrents,2012-05-26T19:55Z,"this is missing some parts:

first fight has no second round
second fight has no decision

other then that, its fine.
"
,robin9872,2012-05-26T20:27Z,"Other than that? Ffs, itÂ´s like seeing a movie and missing last 10 minutes......."
,village1diot,2012-05-26T21:02Z,"@The2nduck This is episode 12 dipshit. 

Don't bother trying to find it, it is not up on the site this early. I'm guessing Tuesday at the earliest."
,hawkins4,2012-05-26T21:22Z,"whyyyyyyyyyyyy holly fuck scene4all    im deleting ur bookmark,lol!!!!"

,cjdock,2012-05-27T04:22Z,"SHIT!!!!!!
missing key parts of the fights, like watching who fucking won!!!
Stupid..don't waste your fucking time..go for a different download"
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-05-27T12:00Z,"Everyone is always complaining about Sir Paul rips (And yeah, this one is missing chunks. But that doesn't usually happen). But at least Sir Paul's stuff will play on Xbox 360. Rudos mp4s will not. And I don't get why Rudos refuses to make their vids playable on Xbox 360. There's in the neighborhood of 70 million of those players out there!"
,pjatgv,2012-05-28T03:47Z,the problem is ur xbox not the video
,Eddiehjjjfcfjfc,2012-05-29T23:36Z,What do you mean the problem is my Xbox? They all work the same. If what you're saying is that it's Xbox's fault it can't play the file because its support isn't broad enough that's true but that can be said about a lot of things. Sir Paul's files are also fine if you play them on the right player. The reason 360 won't play RUDOS files is because of the way the audio is encoded. A small tweak to the way they're doing the audio and that would be 70 million more players the files would work on.
