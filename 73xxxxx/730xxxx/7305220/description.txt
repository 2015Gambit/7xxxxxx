     Stars: Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer and Harry Dean Stanton

   

     80's teen sensations Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club)
     and Andrew McCarthy (St. Elmo's Fire) drew raves for their starring
     performances in this hit love story by John Hughes (Ferris Bueller's Day Off).

     She's a high school girl from the wrong side of town. He's the wealthy 
     heartthrob who asks her to the prom. But as fast as their romance builds,
     it's threatened by the painful reality of peer pressure.

     A bittersweet story with an upbeat ending and a phenomenal rock score.
     Pretty in Pink also stars Harry Dean Stanton, Jon Cryer, James Spader,
     and Annie Potts.
