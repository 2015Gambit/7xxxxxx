This album marks the return of John Mayer after a two year break from the public eye due to controversial remarks he made in Playboy and Rolling Stone interviews. Born and Raised marks yet another change in Mayers musical style, and incorporates musical elements of folk and Americana which take influences from Bob Dylan, Neil Young, David Crosby and Graham Nash. Born and Raised has received generally positive reviews from most critics, some calling it his best album to date.
