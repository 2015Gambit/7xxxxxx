Western Europe is in political chaos, muslims bomb trains, buildings and kill women and children on the streets, London burns in week long riots, as does Paris, Rotterdam, Bradford, Malmo, Copenhagen and dozens of other cities with no-go zones and thousands of burning cars and attacks on police. Nazis march in Germany and have power in Greece. Right wing parties all over Western Europe are getting into parliament....and what do BBC/Tel Aviv central produce... that Poland and the Ukraine have hooligans no their games? Wild kids who need to get their aggression out...this happens in every stadium throughout Europe..oh wait, they say ""Sieg Heil"", that automatically makes them ""The worst"". But throwing molotov cocktails at police or rioting and burning down whole city areas...then it's not ""hate"", then it's ""youths"" who can't get jobs and we need to ""understand"" their ""frustration"". 

Oy vey, BBC, this piece will win a prize for you at the zionist awards."
,garryowen78,2012-05-29T18:03Z,"Mister22 - just out of interest, did you actually watch the documentary before writing that comment?

It doesn't actually matter whether you agree with the BBC's point of view or not. This documentary is full of actual footage from stadiums, including racist chants and violence. Of course they picked the worst bits to show us - but this evidence is easily good enough for a court of law. If you like, skip the presenter's commentary, just watch the raw footage. And then come back and deny that racism exists in Ukrainian football stadiums. 

If I was a betting man, I'd happily bet you 100 bucks that there WILL be racist violence during that tournament. And that will be a disaster for Ukraine's government. I visit the country often and like it very much, but I can tell you first-hand that fascism is alive and well there. "

Mister 22... for you to have written what you did makes you either dumb, blind or plain stupid. People can lie..Words can lie...those pictures didnt. 
Sieg Heil is the worst because of what it stands for. it doesnt stand for anything else does it?.. i didnt see them idiots attacking white people next to them did you. No, they ran half way around a stadium to attack a group of asians. If that aint racist......

There will be trouble this summer and england and other teams should pull out and teach EUFA a lesson for being so dumb to hold it in a country that has some people 50 years behind the rest of europe. Then maybe we can sack platinin and blatter"

I think BBC should make an undercover tv-show about the muslim grooming gangs in the UK, or the imams that preach death and hell to the non-believers. It worked on the 7/7 bombers.

So, they found some football fans who shout ""Sieg Heil"". SO FUCKING WHAT!!

You're avoiding the point. You clearly have a dislike for the BBC and their angle, which I can understand (I have mixed feelings about them too), but you're letting this obscure your judgement on the specific case of racism in Ukrainian/Polish football stadiums. 

Tell me honestly - if you were an Asian man with tickets to Euro 2012 for you and your children, would you really want to go now? Would you really not be at all worried that you might be subjected to verbal abuse and violence? You're really so sure that this documentary is faked that you'd take your kids there and happily walk the streets with them? Of course you're not. No more than you'd cross a busy road blindfolded. "

""The Ukranians hate the jews""?

Have you ever heard about the ""HOLODOMOR""? It's what happened before the holocaust, and killed THREE TIMES as many people, up to 15 MILLION people, including women and children.

And who was behind it? Well, the communists in Russia...and what people were in charge of the communist party in Russia....the jews. So the jews participated in killing tens of millions of Ukranians (And Russians). How many jews have the Ukranians killed? Is it allowed to bear a grudge? 

@ garryowen78. Of course beating up innocent people should be punished harshly! 

My point is that BBC and their ilk alsways put white people, especially eastern Europeans up as some hate-mongering racist peoples. Yes, they might lack the west' modern and progressive way of communicating and diplomacy, but most of those people have insane personal family histories to tell. About Mongols, muslims, communists, nazis and whoever rolled into their territories and killed, raped and pillaged whatever they could. That gets encoded in one's DNA after a couple of hundreds of years of constant uphill battles to survive. So when they see immigrants swarming into their countries (from the Asian parts, mostly muslims), they react. They want to defend themselves and their country. That's called human nature.

Look at London, Birmingham, Sheffield...they are lost to the indigenous English population there. Why should the Ukranians (or the Poles) want that to happen in their countries as well?

Id rather have testosterone filled young kids/men fighting at football games, sieg heiling or whatever they do, than 1 million Asians/Arabs/Africans come in. The young hoodlums grow up and start families. The immigrants just take over and ruin the whole country with their hateful religion and clan-based societies."
,Mister22,2012-05-30T12:49Z,"@ whailoilbeefhooked

For sure there will be some serious battles between the English, German, Dutch, Russians, Polish and Ukranian fans. Maybe even the Croatian fans want in on the action. No love lost there. 

Personally I have mixed feelings about hooliganism. I don't like it when it affects innocent people in the stands like that indian cunt. But he knew what he was going into when he took his whole family to a FOOTBALL GAME in the UKRAINE. Would you put on a Rangers shirt and walk into the home stand at Celtic Park? Fuck no, you value you life and have common sense. 

What I like about it is that it keeps our young people sharp and ready. They get to practice their fighting skills, get the adrenaline going and it's great to have friends you experience things with. Better than going to Iraq and getting your brains blown out.

,garryowen78,2012-05-30T15:09Z,"Mister22 - 

Quoting what you just said: ""he knew what he was going into when he took his whole family to a FOOTBALL GAME in the UKRAINE.""

...So basically you've just answered my question. You've just admitted that it's dangerous for non-whites to go to football matches in Ukraine. 

So on that point, you're agreeing with the documentary, and with Sol Campbell (who is advising Asians and Blacks against going to the tournament). I get that you have a different point of view on European muliticulturalism, but that's actually beside the point. I agree with you about Muslims. I think the UK government should have been far more careful about the number of Muslims they let into the country, and that Islam does pose a genuine threat to British society. But that is a seperate issue, nothing to do with this documentary. 

And as far as immigration goes - Ukraine actually doesn't have much immigration from Asia. And I can assure you that the Ukrainians don't remember Mongol invasion - it was 800 years ago."
,Mister22,2012-05-30T17:25Z,"@ gerryowen78

Here where I come from ""Asia"" is all the countries that are east of the Ukraine. (Turkmenistan, Tadjikistan, Kyrgystan, Azaerbadzjan, Uzbekistan etc). In England Asia is more looked upon as being Pakistan and India etc. 

Russia and the Ukraine have big problems with muslims from the former Soviet republic states coming in and creating a black-market. It's full of gangsters, mafia-style business and cheap labour creating ethnic tensions.

When it comes to Indians who go to football games in the Ukraine...they should have enough social intelligence to know that they MIGHT be on the receiving end of abuse or even attacked. 

But I believe during the tournament this will stop.

Just as I would be careful walking alone as a white guy in Luton, Bradford, Birmingham or Brixton after 8. But not so much when the tournament was there in 1996.

I don't believe Ukranian or Polish supporters would beat up black supporters visiting for the 2012 tournament. 

Remember how during the South Africa world cup, teams had to stay in hotels protected by guards with machine guns, and told not to walk around to much without bodyguards. Same went for fans. Nothing really happened, but the minute the tournament is over, it's back to business as usual down there being the rape captial of the world and leading in gun-violence."

That's just the way I feel. Asians DON'T belong in Europe. I don't want any immigrants from the non-white/muslim world into eastern-Europe. I grew up in wester-Europe and I've seen what damage it has done to all the countres there. Riots, gang-rapes, grooming of underage white girls, drug trafficking, gangs shooting on eachother in the streets, people smuggling, tax fraud, sharia courts, female mutilation, honour killings - FUCK IT, I DON'T FUCKING WANT IT - OK!!? If you want to push that shit and promote in your own country, go ahead. Just don't come crying to me when your mother, sister or daughter get's raped on the way home from a party, or you dad, brother or son get's stabbed to death or shot over some shit reason the towel-heads/muslims decided was good enough.

That Indian that got beat in the video probably had a higher IQ than most of those hooligans that beat him up. He should have used some of it and decided to stay home or gone to the movies/restaurant/theater/museum/park. Not a fucking football stadium in the UKRAINE where ALL the hooligans go...jeeezus christ, are people really this naive?

Now, about the whole 2012 tournament. The hooligans are only going to attack eachother, and not normal fans - as in target them specifically. If they do, I'll personally admit I was wrong right here. But innocent bystanders could end up being hurt if the Polish and English fans start it out in some pub in a major city. Let's hope the riot police has their shit togethether and fixes it if get's out of hand.

I live in Kyiv but I am from London. 

'Holodomor' was carried out by Stalin and his cronies. But they were Orthodox like most Ukrainians. Stalin's purges killed millions of people Ukrainians as well as Jews etc.

You act as if Ukrainians dont immigrate to other countries. How many Ukrainans are living in Portugal? If you look at it from a racist angle Portugal isnt the richest country in the world so Ukrainian immigrants are probably reducing the already low wage hence causing real problems for both locals and Ukrainians. (that is not my opinion). Ukrainians are immigrating by their thousands, that is a fact. Can u imagine Ukrainians being welcomed in the same racist way in other countries?

Aren't those idiots who shout 'Sieg Heil' pissing on the graves of their forefathers who faught against the Nazi invader? Who many people died in Kyiv as a result of Babi Yar and other massacres committed against Ukrainians (Jews, Orthodox etc)?

I do agree that Ukraine is getting a lot of negative publicity at the moment. There are many positives about this beautiful country. But nevertheless racism does exist in Ukraine as it does in Britain, the USA, Israel, Pakistan (everywhere really)

Instead of blaming foreigners for Ukraine's problems wouldnt it be more logical to blame the corrupt politicians??

How can it be that a teacher or doctor earns 2000 UAH whilst its possible for others to work AND get a pension? How can pensioners of the SBU get 10000 UAH whilst others get 1000 UAH?

You have many interesting points! Thank you for sharing your experience and knowledge!

Yes, both Poles and Ukranians flock out of their countries, but they are far from being the criminals that black people are when they come to other countries. Mostly the opposite in fact. They go to work, actual work, not to receive handouts and overcrowd jails. And when they are done, most of them return home! Not like the Africans who just stay for the rest of their lives.

That is a big difference!

I agree that corrupt politicians are very much to blame. That is our/their problem to solve. But opening the borders to millions of unskilled black market workers who sell drugs, rape women and kill people is not a good solution either! We have enough problems in our countries as it is. 

If a Polish person commits a crime in England, I want the English to ship his ass back to Poland to serve in a jail there, and not on the expense of the English taxpayer. The Polish government should also pay whatever damage he/she did to that country, and then take that away from the criminal in his own country, either property or make him work for it until his/hers debt is paid off. 

And for all the nazi-hooligans...get them a fucking job. If the government want's to stop this shit, then get them a job."
