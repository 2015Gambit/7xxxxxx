,peaquod,2012-05-29T07:01Z,Thanks very much mate.
,paladin48,2012-05-29T10:46Z,"subtitles are autotranslated, very terrible quality.  Large portions of the movie do not even have subs, despite what the uploader says."
[T],Knaster,2012-05-29T11:26Z,no subs on this one after 4 minutes.
,akshr,2012-05-29T13:55Z,"Thanks, hero.
the subs are absent from 7 to 14 minutes like every other copies.
stop whining, its one of the best quality available.

These subs too r absent between 7 to 14 mins but are somewhat better translated check them out.

,clewis7,2012-05-31T11:38Z,"Thanx ""OCW"", your release looks good with the sample pics & clean visible English subs. I will definitley grab this one from you. Much appreciated & cheers.... :-) ...... "
,powerv2,2012-06-01T09:05Z,"yeah this has really good quality video, but the subs are lacking. the subs suggested by alpha 1 are great"
,Beakersful,2012-06-04T12:03Z,"Dunno why everyone's saying the video was great on this.  Using Videolan the AR on this was awful, leading to low video quality. I played around with settings and lost half the film experience because I couldn't get it right.  

The replacement subs were pretty awful too.  Loads of Bahasa vocabulary which was untranslated.  Looked like the translator struggled with concepts and just gave up and left the original words in."
,oldmill79,2012-06-11T15:00Z,"The subs aren't the best but a very good effort made. Besides, it's worth learning the language for this one!

 Thank you uploader!
