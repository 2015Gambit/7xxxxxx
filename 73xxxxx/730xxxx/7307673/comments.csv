woogiezoozoo, you are sure that you have the whole files?"
,woogiezoozoo,2012-05-29T15:41Z,"Yeah, it was the whole file... It seems of few of your leechers have got half of the file already, so with you putting the whole file back on it completes it really quick. Like the next one i've already got about 70% of already. Hope you're all good man - thanks again for all this hard work you've done over the past few weeks!!"
