If you make any further attacks on other TPB uploaders, I will ban you from TPB.  :(
In the future, be smart and just shut up.

TPB has very simple rules:

What you upload is no one else's business.
If they like it, they may download it, if they don't like it, then they won't.

What someone else uploads is none of your business.
If you like it, you may download it, if you don't like it, then you don't have to download it.
