In recognition of the forming of Tropical Storm Beryl this morning, I am posting these pics of ATK model Beryl 019!  You can find more information about Beryl the storm here:  http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/

This is #7 of 7 torrents of Beryl the lady.  The previews are for all seven torrents.

Full size previews:

Please note there are three pages of previews.


Comments welcome!

I love doing requests... Go to  
https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=50 
on Suprbay and post them there.  I will be much more likely to see them than if you post them as a torrent comment.  Thanks!
