Originally an agent of Interpol the heroic Prince, joined by the roguish Barney Jordan and the clever orphan Djinn, becomes an adventurer sailing through the contemporary (1960s-70s) world on a sloop, the beautiful Cormoran.

The quality of retexting of this comic is really subpar. I apologize, but wasn't involved in the project, so I guess it wasn't my fault :P

PS: I only upload packs of complete series. If you see me uploading single issues, this means that regretfully, I don't have the series yet complete.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml  ).
Then, you can use ".cbr" files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
