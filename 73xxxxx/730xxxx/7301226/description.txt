Set against the wildly atmospheric backdrop of the French Riviera Jean (Gad Elmaleh), a shy young bartender is mistaken for a millionaire by beautiful scheming opportunist Irene (Audrey Tautou). Abandoned when she discovers his true identity, a love-struck Jean has no intention of letting someone this gorgeous get away! Jean's comical attempts to gain Irene's affections gradually evolve to him setting himself up as a gigolo at the luxury hotel she's staying at... and then the fun really begins.
