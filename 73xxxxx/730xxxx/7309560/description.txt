 [b]About:[/b]

  This game does not yet have a US release date.
It was released in English. The voice acting was criticized by many people.

 [b]What is this?:[/b]

  This is the [USA RegionFrii'd] release of an undubbed PAL version of Pandora's Tower.

This means that the game has English menus, English subtitles, and English text.

This means that the game has Japanese voice acting from the original Japanese iso.

 (You can change region codes using a tool called RegionFrii!)


 [b]Note:[/b]

  I have included the Japanese iso so you can D.I.Y. if you really want to.

<> What you will need:

(-)  The original PAL that has english voices. (Not included in THIS torrent.)
(-)  The proper tools. (Partition Builder and Wiiscrubber)
(-)  The know-how. (Google around.)


[b]- Thank you, and please seed! <3

*Both isos:

Tested and working 100% in both Wiiflow and USB Loader GX!
