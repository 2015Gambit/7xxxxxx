Book Four of Robert A. CaroΓÇÖs monumental The Years of Lyndon Johnson displays all the narrative energy and illuminating insight that led the Times of London to acclaim it as ΓÇ£one of the truly great political biographies of the modern age. A masterpiece.ΓÇ¥

The Passage of Power follows Lyndon Johnson through both the most frustrating and the most triumphant periods of his careerΓÇö1958 to1964. It is a time that would see him trade the extraordinary power he had created for himself as Senate Majority Leader for what became the wretched powerlessness of a Vice President in an administration that disdained and distrusted him. Yet it was, as well, the time in which the presidency, the goal he had always pursued, would be thrust upon him in the moment it took an assassinΓÇÖs bullet to reach its mark.

For the first time, in CaroΓÇÖs breathtakingly vivid narrative, we see the Kennedy assassination through Lyndon JohnsonΓÇÖs eyes. We watch Johnson step into the presidency, inheriting a staff fiercely loyal to his slain predecessor; a Congress determined to retain its power over the executive branch; and a nation in shock and mourning. We see how within weeksΓÇögrasping the reins of the presidency with supreme masteryΓÇöhe propels through Congress essential legislation that at the time of KennedyΓÇÖs death seemed hopelessly logjammed and seizes on a dormant Kennedy program to create the revolutionary War on Poverty. Caro makes clear how the political genius with which Johnson had ruled the Senate now enabled him to make the presidency wholly his own. This was without doubt JohnsonΓÇÖs finest hour, before his aspirations and accomplishments were overshadowed and eroded by the trap of Vietnam.

In its exploration of this pivotal period in JohnsonΓÇÖs lifeΓÇöand in the life of the nationΓÇöThe Passage of Power is not only the story of how he surmounted unprecedented obstacles in order to fulfill the highest purpose of the presidency but is, as well, a revelation of both the pragmatic potential in the presidency and what can be accomplished when the chief executive has the vision and determination to move beyond the pragmatic and initiate programs designed to transform a nation. It is an epic story told with a depth of detail possible only through the peerless research that forms the foundation of Robert CaroΓÇÖs work, confirming Nicholas von HoffmanΓÇÖs verdict that ΓÇ£Caro has changed the art of political biography.ΓÇ¥
