,dredre27,2012-09-06T05:54Z,"This Xilisoft SWF Converter 6.8 + Serials torrent worked perfectly in vmware!!!!

- No keygen required (working serial is included)

*Make sure your inet connection is disconnected when installing and running for the first time*

All of these apps FAILED to [successfully] convert my SWF files to other video formats:

- Amadis Video Converter v3.7.3 AVI.DIVX.WMV.MPEG.MOV.SWF.FLV.MKV.zip

- Oxelon Media Converter FREEWARE.exe

- Recool SWF to MP4 Converter 4 (captures playback).zip

- SUPER ÂŠ v2012.build.52 (July 7, 2012) [malware spyware installer!!!!] .exe

- X-WinFF_1.4.0_rev4 (WinPenPack Portable WinFF open source).zip

- winff-1.4.0-freeware converter.exe

- emicsoft-trp-converter-428216.exe

- daniu-digital-media-converter-pro_full310_428238.exe

- ripzor.com Batch FLV Converter.zip

- WinAvi FLVConverter.exe

- Vixy FLV Freecorder.exe

- SWF to AVI - Freeware (scan!!!).exe

- Swf2Avi (unstable, may have spyware!!!).exe

- Koyote Free FLV Converter (hijacker included!!!).exe

- Riva FLV Encoder (videos to flash).exe

- Pazera Free FLV to AVI Converter.zip

...a few of the above converted the swf to audio-only MP4/AVI/MOV formats WHEN TRYING TO CONVERT TO VIDEO, but failed to also convert the video portions from the SWFs. Was a b big waste of time...until I finally tested this torrent :(

From my tests, Xilisoft SWF Converter is the _only_ app that successfully converted my SWFs to video format. (I chose to convert to MP4 format). All the other apps failed miserably.

* If you need to convert SWF files to videos, don't bother with the others. Just go with Xilisoft SWF Converter 6.8
. You'll save tons of headaches and wasted time. This app is so good it is [almost] worth registering.

Oh. It also does batch processing of a bunch of files in a queue. 

The only negative I can think of is that conversion is slow when run from a virtual machine. Took 56 minutes to convert 59 minutes of videos from SWF to MP4. Then again, the VM only had two cores allocated to it and I think only 2gigs of ram configured for use. 

This will probably run much faster in a true multi-core system using real ram. But I no longer test warez in my real os. Only in virtual machines.

I hope this helps anyone else considering which torrent to bother with. I say try this one!

Avast/Microsoft Security Essentials/and Comodo all say it's ok. But that really means nothing if something is hidden very well.."
