X-Men - The Animated Series (1992) - All 76 Episodes [Seasons 1-5]
IN PROPER VIEWING SEQUENCE AS INTENDED BY SHOW CREATORS

I did not create the videos, I simply gathered them up from the internet and then re-ordered them in the sequence the show's writers intended. All the episodes are pretty good quality, tho (some episodes have slight high end audio distortion - nothing serious). 

This is probably the best long running X-Men series ever done yet it was hindered by the FOX Network (what a shock) when they began airing episodes out of order. This left many fans to criticize the series for the show's disjointed feel. From what I've heard, the production was slower than FOX wanted, so they just began airing anything the studio completed, not caring if it made sense to the overall story arc. Wikipedia talks a little about it and also presents the correct order for the series which is the order these episodes are in.
