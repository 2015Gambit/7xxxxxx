,cmon2012,2012-05-27T15:04Z,I forgot to mention i have the game in a zip folder which i have split into smaller files using hjsplit which is included in the torrent. just join the files using hjsplit and extract the game ^^
,cmon2012,2012-05-27T23:31Z,Can people who download this please seed with me for a little bit so others may get this game too thanks everyone
,dandalis,2012-05-28T13:59Z,"i have been searching and waiting a very long time for this, thank u man, brilliant work."
,cmon2012,2012-05-28T15:54Z,Make sure to adjust ur screen size in settings :)
,Bedouin85,2012-05-28T22:16Z,It keeps crashing everytime I boot it up. I have changed the compatibility mode to Windows 98. I'm running Windows 7 64 bit but I still can't get it to work. Any help?
,cmon2012,2012-05-28T22:34Z,I use windows 7 64 bit too and it runs perfectly on mine. try updating ur direct x if possible there is no need to run in compatibility mode. just make sure you have clicked the setup file. if you clicked setup and moved the folder to another location that might have screwed it up try clicking that set up file again 
,Bedouin85,2012-05-28T22:51Z,Thanks for the response but it still is not working. After I join the files. I click setup but it does nothing. If I right click it and open it it will crash windows explorer. 
,cmon2012,2012-05-28T22:59Z,this might be a silly thing to ask but have u extracted the game from the zip folder. if you try to run the game in the zip folder it will crash you need to extract it
,Bedouin85,2012-05-29T15:28Z,Yeah I have. Right after I click the GTA application my screen changes and I have to start task manager to close it because it is not responding. 
,Bedouin85,2012-05-29T15:36Z,"I found the problem. I had to manually create some folders and extract the files to there. Create:

C:Program FilesRockstar GamesGTAIII then extract all the files there and you should be good to go!"
,cmon2012,2012-05-29T21:55Z,cool good you sorted it ^^
,max879,2012-05-30T16:14Z,Why i cant change the resolution?
,cmon2012,2012-05-30T19:43Z,yes you can just go into display settings. if its set to the lowest just change it. If you cant i suggest you update ur graphics driver and or direct X
,cmon2012,2012-05-30T19:43Z,and make sure you press (return enter button) once you change it
,cmon2012,2012-06-01T16:40Z,Lets take it that @max879 has solved his problem
,Yarazion,2012-06-01T23:30Z,"Looks like a great torrent, thanks cmon2012, just need more people to seed so i can actually play it!!"
,Yarazion,2012-06-01T23:31Z,"Looks like a great torrent, thanks cmon2012, just need more people to seed so i can actually play it!"
,cmon2012,2012-06-02T14:44Z,"Yarazion i did a text last night to see if there was enough seeders. I tried to download on another computer and i got over 60 seeders and it was done in 2 - 4 mins. 

Try setting up port forwarding on your bit client that should help you get more seeders on your list ^_^.?If you don't know how to do that just good some videos its rather simple ."
,nekoboy1,2012-06-03T11:12Z,"yeah thanks for the trojan, dickhead. 

be sure not to download the hjsplit.exe, get it yourself. this bastard of a uploader had something in mind with that. "
,cmon2012,2012-06-04T18:23Z,"nekoboy1 your some retard.. clearly i had some evil plan to hijack your system :P

(There is no virus in any thing in this torrent)
If anyone wants to download Hjsplit  feel free to http://www.hjsplit.org/"
,cmon2012,2012-06-04T18:34Z,what is even funny is i had hjsplit downloaded about 10 minutes before uploading this torrent.
,Vasco1888,2012-06-12T18:27Z,Seed please!!!
,cmon2012,2012-06-13T01:58Z,Vasco1888 there are loads of seeders loads. sort out your port forwarding and or check if your ISP throttles p2p downloads like BT does
,n00bzey22,2012-06-18T13:03Z,"Thanks for the upload, the game works, but I have a few problems.
Picture isn't very clear, especially at night.

http://imgcrave[.]com/u/K9tfy.png
And resolution can't be changed.
http://imgcrave[.]com/u/ZWHj.png
Any idea how to fix this? :)"
,cmon2012,2012-06-18T14:18Z,"n00bzey22 Thanks for linking the pictures . The only thing i can think of is that your Direct X isn't up to-date or you don't have the up to-date driver for your gfx card 

Here is the official updater for direct X 
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35

as for your gfx card you will need to find that your self.

AS for changing the resolution thats easy just to into display setting and use your wheel on your mouse to change it to the desired dimensions and press the return enter button.

I hope this helps in any way"

,cmon2012,2012-06-27T21:48Z,Antonis1998 make sure all the 001 002 etc files are in the same folder when u select 001 to join. they have to be in the same folder if you moved them they wont work
