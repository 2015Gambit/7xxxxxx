,SinAppz,2012-05-26T12:03Z,"invertigo, I guess you are too stupid to figure out that this is how it aired on TV.  S4A does you a free service encoding these episodes for you.  They don't owe you anything."
,otnemem,2012-05-26T15:59Z,"It didn't air like this you prick. Whoever capped this foocked up as he did last time, only Sir Paul and AFG used the same source and didn't really bother checking it out first.
There's already a DSR by XWT that is fine."

,greenwheel,2012-05-31T16:55Z,"@SinAppz I guess that you are too stupid to figure out that this show is LIVE you dumb vaginal blood fart! The second round HAPPENED LIVE! It didn't just disappear into the nether. Man I hope you don't try to reproduce, cause the world doesn't need more defects like you in it!"
