Mussard was born in Marseille on 11 March 1966, with Malagasy and Reunionnais origins. In 1988, he met Akhenaton, with whom he formed IAM. Mussard adopted the stage name Shurik'n Chang-Ti, reflecting his interest in Oriental culture and his background in martial arts, such as judo, karate and kung fu. IAM released its first album, De la Planete Mars, in 1990.

After three albums with IAM, Shurik'n decided to start pursuing a solo career with his 1998 album OÃ¹ je vis. The album debuted atop the French album chart.
