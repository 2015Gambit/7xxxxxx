,Zhelkus,2012-05-28T20:59Z,"What is this, a joke?

How is this a 20min 720p WEB-DL (usually 700MB) and be only 90MB??

Perhaps the misspelling of the filename indicate something.

Real file (obtained elsewhere, not from this torrent) is
Green.Lantern.The.Animated.Series.S01E13.Homecoming.720p.WEB-DL.AAC-2.0.H264-BluZilla.mkv
and weighs 688 MBs."

,pureplayxxx,2012-05-29T11:33Z,"Thanks for the awesome upload again, bikers123. Will seed till the next ep. Thanks again.

@Zhelkus: Fuckwit! check who the uploader is first before you go comment about things you don't know. Ever heard of AV compression? Ever heard of a 1080p movie thats compressed to a 1.8GB files? Ever heard of any of the above? If not, shut the fuck up!"
