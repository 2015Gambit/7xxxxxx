The program is working though and the various apk files according to your phone's resolution."

Copy the Igo folder you downloaded to the SD card.

Move the apk file that fits your screen resolution to the root of the SD Card.

Rename the iGo folder to Motonav.

Run the apk file you moved in the root of the SD Card and install the program."
