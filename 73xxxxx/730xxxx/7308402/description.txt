FROM WIKI:
Casablanca was part of the film colorization controversy of the 1980s, when a colorized version aired on the television
station WTBS. In 1984, MGM-UA hired Color Systems Technology to colorize the film for $180,000. When Ted Turner of
Turner Entertainment purchased MGM-UA's film library two years later, he canceled the request, before contracting American
Film Technologies in 1988. AFT completed the colorization in two months at a cost of $450,000. Turner later reacted
to the criticism of the colorization, saying, "[Casablanca] is one of a handful of films that really doesn't have to be
colorized. I did it because I wanted to. All I'm trying to do is protect my investment."

The Library of Congress deemed that the color change differed so much from the original film that it gave a new copyright to
Turner Entertainment. When the colorized film debuted on WTBS, it was watched by three million viewers, not making the
top-ten viewed cable shows for the week. Although Jack Matthews of the Los Angeles Times called the finished product
"state of the art", it was mostly met with negative critical reception. It was briefly available on home video.
Gary Edgerton, writing for the Journal of Popular Film & Television criticized the colorization, "... Casablanca in color
ended up being much blander in appearance and, overall, much less visually interesting than its 1942 predecessor."
Bogart's son Stephen said, "if you're going to colorize Casablanca, why not put arms on the Venus de Milo?"


FROM ME:
For a lot of people the first titles that come to mind when thinking old B&W movies are "Casablanca" or "The Maltese Falcon".
I'm sure that there are millions who are glad Turner did not colorize The Maltese Falcon.
Remember this was colorized on 25-year-old technology.
