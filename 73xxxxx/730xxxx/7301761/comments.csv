ISO!"
,traxxox,2012-05-26T21:55Z,"VOBs are better than ISOs.
But I want untouched 1:1 DVD-9 VOBs.
Don't take anything out or change the dvd in any way (not even the FBI warnings and legalese crap).
I can always use my own DVD shrinking software to edit the movie the way I want, if I want.

This is the best and most respectable way to share DVDs.
You are giving people the complete real thing. (A technically compliant decoded copy of it, that is.)"
[T],Auge,2012-05-26T23:45Z,"Traxxox,

Before I got my HD TV Media Player I was ripping and burning to DVD5, so the majority of my discs are DVD5. 
The HD TV Media Player has ISO support so I started ripping to a hard drive.
Recently I got a 16 terabyte Drobo and now that storage space is not an issue I rip new discs to DVD9.
So unfortunately most of what I will offer will be DVD5.
It is more convenient for me to rip to ISO as I am already doing that with my collection to store on the Drobo, however I (and you) can unpack an ISO with WINZIP (in case you did not know).  
So far most folks have said they prefer ISO, but if more show up voting for VOB, I may have to change up how I do it."
,baybeh,2012-05-27T11:32Z,"no, please continue with ISO. Yours are some of the neatest rips."
,traxxox,2012-05-27T14:34Z,"ISOs crash my burning app causing me to lose blank dual layer disks!
ISOs work just fine with single layer disks however.

Some blank dual layer disks do not like the layer break information contained in an iso."

is 6.38GB almost 2GB more than this one.

I don’t understand your point.
I clearly stated this is a DVD5, Lots of folks prefer DVD5 as it fits on a disc that costs only .25 cents with very little or no noticeable difference to the quality of the content.
I hope you are not being negative, I will put the 80 uploads I have (so far) and my little “trusted” pirate badge up against the NOTHING you provide . . . not to mention all the other folks that appreciate what I am doing here.
Perhaps I am misreading your post . . . it’s a bit vague. If so please correct me."
,lotario,2012-05-31T05:52Z,"My point is that is stated in the descrition that is
dvd 5 full, that implies no compression at all.
Reading your answer now I undestand that your mean complete DVD instead of full.

Nothing negative brother, appreciate your work.

In that case let me apologize for jumping to conclusions, I am sorry for misreading your post and jumping down your throat.

We had this same discussion over at Demonoid and the consensus was that “Full DVD” meant that everything was included with nothing removed . . . I will agree that it is a misleading description and that is why I include in the post what I mean by saying DVD5 or DVD9… ETC.

I wonder if it wouldn’t be better to replace FULL DVD with DVD5 or DVD9?"
,lotario,2012-05-31T07:04Z,"If you ask me I will say that the better way
is to specify if the movie has been compressed and in what porcentage. There are tons off old movies that fits perfectly in a DVD5, but i guess is good to know before downloading what kind of reduction the movie has been applied. 
BTW, don't worry, I had read some of your posts and I know you're a kind guy. "
[T],Auge,2012-05-31T08:44Z,Most of my DVDs are already on DVD5s so I would have no idea how much they were compressed.
