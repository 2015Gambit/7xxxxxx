Question: Would you rather I continue providing ISOs or are VOBs better?


Saboteur (1942) FULL DVD (ISO)


*** 
I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. 
This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. 
I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit.
It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

This is a DVD rip to an ISO so you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.

This rip is a (DVD-5)

- What I mean by (DVD-9) this ISO is a 1:1 rip and is not compressed in any way if you are burning this you will need a double layer disc.
- What I mean by (DVD-5) this ISO has been compressed to fit onto a single layer disc, the main film has been touched as little as possible and unless you are watching this on a high definition projector at over 60 inches you should not be able to notice any difference. Nothing has been taken out of the original DVD.

SYNOPSIS:  
When aircraft plant worker Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongly accused of sabotage and murder, he embarks on a cross-country chase for the actual culprit in this classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller co-starring Priscilla Lane. Chock-full of breathtaking chase scenes, crisp dialogue (courtesy of co-writer Dorothy Parker) and stunning locations, this World War II-era story leads Kane to a stunning climax atop the Statue of Liberty.
