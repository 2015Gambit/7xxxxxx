,judeanpopularfront,2012-06-09T08:20Z,Great torrent! Thanks dude. Can just copy into iTunes and onto iPod and it's there as one album with all the covers. Whereas some other stuff like the people that compile the non-retail Now collections end up being 20 different albums and you have to go thru the ID tags individually. Great work on this one! Thanks.
