If you wish to learn the best explanation as to why the fur coat of arctic mammals is ""white"" (appears white but actually is almost perfectly transparent, much like snow flakes), you would better go to Wikipedia (polar bear) and add the following peer-reviewed paper to the Wiki bibliography. No, it isn't for camouflage... (Hey, which species preys on the polar bear or the arctic wolf? No, the Yeti is not known to inhabit the Arctic Circle...) And yes, Mr. Philosopher Ruse, evolution not only obeys the laws of physics like anything else but also optimises their use for better survival of these species.
