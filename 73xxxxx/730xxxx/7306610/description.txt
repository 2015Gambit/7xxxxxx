The SLL Lighting Handbook provides a valuable link between the SLL Lighting Guides and the Code for Lighting. It is complementary to the SLL Code but provides more in terms of applications and background information. It summarises the fundamentals of light and vision, covers the technology of lighting and provides guidance on a wide range of applications, both interior and exterior. Comprehensive, up-to-date and accessible, The SLL Lighting Handbook is a first-stop for anyone seeking information on lighting. It is essential reading for lighting practitioners, lighting specifiers and students of lighting.
