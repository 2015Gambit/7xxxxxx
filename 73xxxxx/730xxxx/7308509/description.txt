Big K.R.I.T.'s first record label debut: "Live from the Underground"

This was ripped directly from the NPR "First Listen" feature that was put up on 5-27-12. I ripped it using AudioHijackPro, MP3 VBR (V0). Most are around ~190kbps. Pretty good quality for a web rip.


If you genuinely enjoy this music (c'mon, you know you will, it's KRIT!) go BUY THE ALBUM. Big K.R.I.T. deserves money for this!
