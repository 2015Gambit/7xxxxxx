 Former Miss Great Britain Gemma Garrett investigates how she and almost 50,000 
 other British women ended up with toxic breast implants made by the French 
 company PIP. As well as exploring the long term effects of the ruptured 
 implants, she explores why so many women remain intent on going under the 
 knife, and meets the first ever person to have had such surgery. 
                       
                                 Enjoy!
