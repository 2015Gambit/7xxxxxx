This is a replacement file - the first torrent stopped working properly. 


My sisters and brother loved the Let's Pretend series and although we have all the albums, nobody had a record player or means to translate old scratched albums to audio files. I was thrilled to find a site that has done so!

This is the entire collection of 25 Albums of the Let's Pretend children's records from the 1970s.  It is in MP3 format.  This large collection of children's stories was adapted from the radio program that was broadcast from the 30s-50s.

Each story is about 30 minutes long.  The age range for these stories was originally 8-14.  

I did not create this set. Even though the website that provides these long lost audio stories for free has been up for over 2 years, they have never come up in a search before.  Therefore, I am also giving you the direct link as free advertising for him - this wonderful person has many more children's albums from the 50s and 60s and links to even more, all free.  Donate to keep them going!
