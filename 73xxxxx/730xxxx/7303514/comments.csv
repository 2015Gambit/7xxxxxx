,Sivos,2012-05-28T05:20Z,"READ THIS IF YOU WANT INFO ON THIS TORRENT:

You may have to disable your anti virus to run the setup, otherwise it will claim a false positive to a virus that ISN'T there and not open.  Google the steps based around whatever protection you use if you don't know how.

Of course, 95% of you will say there's a virus and either completely ignore my comment or assume I'm lying or don't know how to read.

The setup is in Russian, but easy to follow anyway if you can't read it.  All you need is common sense.

If you get an error during the setup saying to Abort, Retry or Ignore, I hit ignore and the game worked fine, if you want to try to fix it, feel free.  And if you find a way around it, please reply to this with your answer.  But I ignored it and I have yet to find any problems.

Now for the moment of truth, this game is FADE FREE!  There is no FADE in this copy, so it has been resolved here and now.  The game itself IS in English even though the setup is in Russian.  But the game is FADE FREE!

No crack needed, just install then play.

So, enjoy! :D"
,bgunzelite87,2012-05-28T15:59Z,It say wrong serial key at setup
,bgunzelite87,2012-05-28T16:00Z,Do anyone have any ways around this?
,bgunzelite87,2012-05-28T16:05Z,"I got it thanx,fully working"
,Ms.Bailey,2012-05-29T18:55Z,"This still has FADE. During the German Campaign in the tutorial your character will stop moving after being trained with the MP42 submachine gun. Reloading to a previous save does not fix this. You have to restart the game entirely, and even then once you get back to that spot, you won't be able to move. Did I do something wrong?"
,DamDSx,2012-06-01T20:55Z,"Fade does exist in this game. I am on mission 4 german side, and things have been getting worse and worse, until yesterday I got a watermark on close to the crosshair that said ""Illegal copies mahy degrade"" and the game has been unplayable since, enemies coming out of nowhere, from behind trees on our back, this causes AI to enter combat and they do not move, hence you cannot advance the mission. no fade my ass..."
,ivandksd,2012-06-16T04:31Z,If fade is activated it maybe because the installer detects the program that mounts the game image (daemon tools most usually). To avoid this you should try the guide in this torrent http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6433693 (it is for ARMA 2 REINFORCEMENTS but should work for this to). Look for the comments also: there are many different ways to fool the detection system but the most used are: 1) use Alcohol 52% + latest version of A.C.I.D. 2) Make the IDE Virtual Drive attach to the a physical IDE Drive (using Daemon Tools Pro or  Virtual CD 10).
,ivandksd,2012-06-17T19:20Z,"I think i know why FADE activates... Skidrow did the same mistake when they released ARMA 2 Reinforcements... For the game to install properly as i said before you need to make an exact copy from the disc, using software like Alcohol 120% or CloneDVD. What is obviously not done right in this release (and in every release so far i think). Why? because the crack is added inside the game image!! so, every time you install the game the setup software makes something like a checksum from the disc and detects that it has been modified. To make a proper copy the DVD should have been cloned and the crack should have been added in another file, or actually there is no need for crack if the copy is properly made. Many people (even the crackers) think that the game is working ok because they try it a little and every thing looks fine; but the problem is that fade not always activates instantly, instead it makes a progressive game degrade making the game experience worst over the time until it is just unplayable...
