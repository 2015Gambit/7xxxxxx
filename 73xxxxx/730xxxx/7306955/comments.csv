,cinemaniac905,2012-05-28T18:46Z,"is it at all possible to get s02e01-05 upped as DVD caps? 

im willing to encode all these into high quality XVID's....ripped properly...if i can get my hands on all the episodes.

im sick and tired of having to settle for absolute garbage scene re-encodes that are pathetic quality...done by people who have no idea what they are doing.

would be greatly appreciated ...thanks!"

Episode 1 as a PAL DVD - you can easily extract the MPEG-2 from the ISO. Is that what you mean?"
