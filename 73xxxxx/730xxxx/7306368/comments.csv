,floipoid,2012-05-28T19:33Z,"This is literally JUST better than nothing.  The fact that it exists is nice...

2/2 it would be 1/1 but the camera is at least steady?"
,floipoid,2012-05-28T20:30Z,I just wanted to write back and say that this is literally unwatchable.  Everything is just dark.
,dogman514,2012-05-29T02:02Z,unwatchable to dark thanks for trying.
,backweed,2012-05-29T03:33Z,"Saw the trailer, got excited and looked for a copy online. Had better copies than this though, thanks for trying, got superior copy in hdprint here at chernobyldiaries.shortterminsurancequotes.co.za"

,HarleySturg,2012-05-30T01:26Z,backweed??? more like spamming dickweed!!!
,Wolfatthedoor,2012-05-30T03:01Z,Im actually really surprised there isnt a decent copy of this up yet...especially when anything animated is up the day of the release..come on russians...where you at??...
,Yaeger31,2012-05-30T03:07Z,watching it  now at tripleA.qatoqicajavurel.info 
,K1bbler,2012-05-30T16:17Z,Usually shithouse movies like this go online straight away. Otherwise no one ever watches it.
