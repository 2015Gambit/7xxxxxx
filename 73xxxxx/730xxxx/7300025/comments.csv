,Heuschreckenschwarm,2012-06-08T07:11Z,"Excellent, always wanted to learn Russian and here we go!"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-09T13:18Z,"@GCDenton,

Some of the language pack(s) were missing the files needed for speech recognition. 
so I am going through them all to make sure they were there and worked."
,Natteulven,2012-06-10T18:29Z,"Okay, so I downloaded it and let it extract, now what do I click to play it? "
,primederuta,2012-06-28T09:40Z,"Hmm...it looks like others have been using this so I'm inclined to believe that it's ok...but after the DL I scanned this w/ Microsoft Security Essentials and it's coming back w/ a risk in ""

I know MSE isn't exactly a great virus protection tool, but ATM it's all I have, and I have v3 Spanish thanks to my job and it doesn't seem to be giving that error on the legit copy..."

Just install Avast, it's free and works well
Leeching now, will seed for a bit afterwards but my connection is crap atm."
,echo1234,2012-07-11T07:45Z,How many levels is this?
,jethandavis,2012-08-01T05:33Z,"I'm with Natteulven.  I unziped and everything, so how do I get it to run?"
,SuperStretchyPowers,2012-08-04T05:50Z,"I'm having a problem with this torrent. I've gotten Rosetta Stone to work but whenever I try to extract this file it doesn't work. I let the language run itself and all it does is fill the content folder with files like SK-RUS-L3-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.rsi and SK-RUS-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.7.1.0.r29. When I try to open it up with Daemon, nothing happens and it can't find the language. "
