The Lost Lagoon
Pomene Bay in Mozambique stands alone compared to many lagoons - in a world of pollution, its pure and isolated nature has made it home to some of the weirdest sea creatures ever seen. By following the day-to-day life of an old, local fisherman, The Lost Lagoon takes us into this undiscovered world, detailing unique micro behaviour almost otherwise invisible to the naked eye. Following the crucial tidal cycle, the real story of the lagoon is how its water changes every 12 hours, meaning that different species are ushered in and out of the lagoon with a regularity not often seen anywhere else. And the area is teeming with marine life - crabs scurry in and out of their burrows, sea grass on the sand banks harbour minute, transparent and brainless shrimps and enormous sea slugs. Many inhabitants have to adapt quickly to the ever-changing tide, depending on whether they're submerged by water or exposed to the elements. Beyond the breakers, in the deep Indian Ocean, coral reefs thrive in the rich nutrients while whale fish come to feed. 
It's an extraordinary environment, inhabited by some extraordinary, unmissable wildlife.
