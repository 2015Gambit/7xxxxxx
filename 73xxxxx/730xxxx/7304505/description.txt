HERMANN
He loves the adventure, he likes distant horizons, he loves the woods! This is not surprising when one knows he was born in the Ardennes and spent some time in Canada. In COMANCHE Hermann shows his love for man, for nature and his great talent.

GREG
The scriptwriter. He knows and loves the Wild West. He stayed more than once in the IS and aimed in every episode of COMANCHE for the truthful reality to describe.
He is an ideal tandem with Hermann.

PS: I only upload packs of complete series. If you see me uploading single issues, this means that regretfully, I don't have the series yet complete.

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml  ).
Then, you can use ".cbr" files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
