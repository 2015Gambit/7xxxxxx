2)sound sync with movie

3)The subtitle here is Netherlander ( not helpful when they speak Chinese and Russian.)  I'm Looking for English Subtitles

4) TOOK FOREVER TO DOWNLOAD. i had 40S and 45L most of the time and it took me 29 hours to DL. normally it takes me 1-3 hours. 

V: 9.85 ( barely visible distortion, mainly because it was poorly ripped or uploaded) 
A: 7-10 ( there are some audio glitches ""screeches""  and its sounds like 64 kbit/s audio)
M: watched half without subtitles, Looking for subtitles and requesting one the fit to this torrent. "

,ronin6,2012-05-29T23:35Z,no english sub for non-english parts.  thanks for your effort.  i guess english speaking part of world is not worth the extra effort. l love Amsterdam - kick ass city - weed in cafes - awesome!  i love the European attitude!
