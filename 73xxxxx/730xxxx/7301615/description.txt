Nirvana ΓÇô Rock Review ΓÇô a critical retrospective

Drawing on rare archive footage of Nirvana in performance, this is the powerful portrait of the music that changed the world.
Presented by rock legend Tommy Vance, the film was made with total journalistic freedom. Hard-hitting and uncensored, this is a completely independent production. Full editorial control was retained at all times and this film was not authorised: censored or influenced in any way by Nirvana, Geffen Records or the estate of Kurt Cobain.
Also featured are the thoughts of leading rock critics, biographer Charles Cross, musicologists and a incisive psychoanalysis of the mind of Kurt Cobain by respected psychologist Stephen Smith. The soundtrack features brand new digital surround sound recordings by Cobain, todays most respected interpreters of Kurt Cobains work.
