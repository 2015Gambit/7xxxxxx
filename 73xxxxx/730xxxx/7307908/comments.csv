Hate MKVs, they suck. They always max out the fan on my laptop. Too reliant on the CPU for some reason."

I actually wanted to watch the race, and it was so interesting, and then suddenly it wasn't. I think you need to check your files before uploading them.

Great audio and video, just to bad about the missing laps."
