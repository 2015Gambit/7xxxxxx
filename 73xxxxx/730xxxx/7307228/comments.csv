That file works better in most cases, however if that doesn't work you have the MasterFix already there (or you can download the torrent from the links in the description)."

Also I am uploading a new torrent with the proper trackers, will you guys please download the new version, just click in my name and you will find it. I will leave this old file for some days. Thank you!"
