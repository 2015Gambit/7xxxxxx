Alot of this is backed by religion.

Theres more though, before the American Holocuast Constantine, when making Orthodox Christianity the offical religion of the Holy Roman Empire, began the beginning of the Dark Ages, You have the re-writing of history, The destruction and suppression of knowledge, The burning down of Ancient Pagan Temples and Libraries, You have The Inquisition, The Bloody Crusades, The Witchunts, The Protestant and Catholic Wars of Religion, Fudalism and Slavery.
