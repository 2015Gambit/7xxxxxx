,mezo1612,2012-05-27T03:45Z,"What is difference between 720p and 1080p
i know 1080p is better but why most people prefer to download the 720p and not download 1080p for the same movie?
someone help please? 
should i download the 1080p or 720p?
i noticed that 720p has more seeders and peers thats why i asked"
,Shadow416,2012-05-27T05:20Z,"@mezo

it's usually because of the size people prefer to just get something smaller with the same quality as a 1080p rip (usually 720 n 1080 rips are pretty much the same...it really depends on who is ripping it)...and for a movie like this 1080p wont even save it from embarrassment lol....

THE only 1080p worth downloading is FULL 1080p no rips, legit quality. Then a lot of people would go for it but it has to be badass movie/show."

,alveolate,2012-05-27T20:16Z,"@mezo

i download 720p simply because my monitor has a maximum horizontal resolution of 1280.

that, and my computer is slow... has trouble playing bigger files."
,mttigga,2012-05-28T20:05Z,"720p for 20 to 22 inch monitors or 1080p, 24inch or above monitor's."

,tironzo1607,2012-06-07T11:32Z,"the last guy said it is a cam movie, is he telling the truth or not"
,MacTee,2012-06-09T01:41Z,No its not a cam.  Onserog1 is just mindlessly(it may even be a bot) spamming that useless website he posted.  Its a good quality Bluray rip.  And for added awesomeness its under 1 GB
