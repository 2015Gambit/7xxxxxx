,vivatpb5776,2012-07-06T03:30Z,It's a shame there are no seeders for this. The quality of this uploader's previous seasons are very good. I am going to keep an eye on this .torrent and start downloading when there are some seeders.

,vivatpb5776,2012-07-14T03:42Z,"Not gonna lie, I am guilty of that as well. However, this is one of those series that really need to be seeded. I am one of the current 3 seeders. I will seed for as long as this computer stays turned on. Thanks again Herlock-60."
,vivatpb5776,2012-07-17T23:57Z,I am up to 7.366 seed ratio. That should be good enough. Thanks again Herlock-60.

We're a couple of leechers now who are stuck at 99%. If someone could just go in quickly and seed 25MB or so, that would be great and this torrent could stay alive."
