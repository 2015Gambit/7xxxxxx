,-Away,2012-05-27T09:38Z,Please tell me the fights ? =(
,billylopez,2012-05-27T09:57Z,any chance on letting us know when Bellator 70 main card will be available for download??
,jacrjames,2012-05-27T10:02Z,if you don't know who's fighting in this event you just shouldn't bother downloading it...
,dwbeez,2012-05-27T10:21Z,jacrjames ....your comment is stupid.....because most of the UFC 146 fights are being posted individually and not the whole card of fighters. So all billylopez wanted to know was if this was all the fights or just one.....You made yourself look like a stupid punk!
,lif3isfr33,2012-05-27T10:30Z,Are you serious? Only 0.7 KB a second.. :'( 
,DngnRdr,2012-05-27T11:05Z,"dwbeez... the RUDOS releases aren't posting fights individually.... their was a RUDOS release called ""prelim fights"" which listed the bouts... http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7303238/UFC.146.Dos.Santos.vs.Mir.Prelims.HDTV.x264-RUDOS so this would undoubtedly be the main event. I'm sure I'll be corrected soon enough if I'm wrong."
,jacrjames,2012-05-27T11:22Z,yeh yeh soz I'm just fucked off cos i canna get a seed...
,Galtar0420,2012-05-27T11:25Z,"Real deal and its in HD

,Galtar0420,2012-05-27T11:26Z,"no RARs, no password, no BS. 
Thanks to the uploader"
,AfroSox,2012-05-27T12:34Z,The phuckin speed is killing me?? WDF??
,junyo21,2012-05-27T13:07Z,seed guys...
,scotste,2012-05-27T13:50Z,"Seriously people what's with the seeding, the ufc seeds are normally much better, I've been getting under 1kb/s since it was uploaded.

I know there are a bunch of fakes but surely there has to be something else going on here?"
,ChaKing1,2012-05-27T14:18Z,"It's a sad day when people can get something for free AND ARE TOO FUCKING SORRY TO SEED IT. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH SOME OF YOU LECHERS AND SEEDERS, YOU GOT IT FOR FREE SO FUCKING SEED THE SHIT!!"
,ChaKing1,2012-05-27T14:22Z,"YOUR GETTING IT FOR FREE SO SEED THIS SHIT! WHAT THE HELL, SORRY ASS PEOPLE! PEOPLE WHO DO NOT SEED SHOULD BE KICKED THE F OUT!"
,t6mm655,2012-05-27T14:42Z,seed 4 fuck sake
,dougthechippy,2012-05-27T16:04Z,Why is the download speed so slow when there are so many seeds? Is there something I need to do to improve this?? 
,ChaKing1,2012-05-27T17:07Z,I think there is more of an issue going here than just people not seeding. There seems to be something going on with the Links and they seem to be throttled. I know it's not my connection because I have tried multiple connection. Someone should check into this..
,xoniccc,2012-05-27T18:15Z,whats the password?! i aint doing no survey sir
,bondjing,2012-05-27T18:23Z,"Super slow download! I have a 25mb a sec connection and I""m getting just 176k.

scene4all sucks ass."
,xoniccc,2012-05-27T18:45Z,PASSWORD? what is it?!?!?
,Skullsquisher,2012-05-27T20:59Z,the sir paul release / I cant find it now/ is password protected but it has the s4a logo on it. what is the deal with the links to password. correct me if Im wrong but I call bullshit and got out of there. and I am waiting for this to finish.
,Xanthium111111,2012-05-28T08:33Z,xoniccc = troll. scene4all NEVER uploads passworded files.

,awesomewelles,2012-05-28T12:21Z,Frank Mir is a fucking fag! I want to fight that dude.
,scotste,2012-05-28T15:58Z,"I have had problems downloading this UFC event from diffrent uploaders which was frustrating but now I am having the same problems uploading, it's sitting around 10kb/s upload when its 80kb/s for any other files.

It took me 27 hours to download this...Now it is barely letting me upload it, something weird is going on before people get angry at the seeders."
,joanmcbitch,2012-05-28T22:16Z,"Mir is like a 'What If?' Marvel comic: 

""What if...the WWE could sneak a fighter into the UFC?"""
,eddiesadvocate,2012-05-28T23:07Z,PERFECT!!! NO PASS WORD! NO RAR FILE! NO BULLSH!T! Thank you!!!! Thank you! Thank you!
,renegade87,2012-05-29T02:28Z,"@joanmcbitch, they already did and his name was Brock Lesnar... and he sucked"
,You_Muppet,2012-05-29T08:32Z,"As ever, great quality torrent and at an average speed of 350+kbs, pretty quick. Ta, s4a!!

Main card only (from Struve V Johnson, onwards).

And I don't feel so bad for 'stealing' this from Dana -- I paid $1400 to fly from Australia to LV to see this fight, then paid $600 for a ticket and I did the $400 VIP tour, so I've paid for this torrent :)"
,You_Muppet,2012-05-29T10:02Z,"My bad: the prelims are at the end of the torrent, plus Hardy V Ludwig is in between the Nelson and Velasquez fights. They are all there!!"
,toe-knee-11,2012-05-30T04:17Z,"Does anyone have the answer to why this is going so slow?? 4000+ seeders, a ufc event from a reliable source (ive downloaded s4a torrents before and are never this bad), yet im getting speeds below 10kb/s i know its not my internet, i paused this torrent and downloaded another one to check and it was fine, there was a period last night where i was getting about 100kb/s but it lasted about 5 minutes and continued being shit... If someone could shed some light on this i would appreciate it!"
,Dew_Schbag,2012-05-30T15:32Z,did he died?
,Asshole88,2012-05-31T03:52Z,"Does not play on the Xbox 360? Why?
I have the optional media update, still won't play. Why upload this if it isn't supported on anything but a computer?"
,Asshole88,2012-05-31T04:11Z,"Did not play on an Xbox 360 with the media update, or an all around portable media player I have. How about using some universal codecs you cunt face?"
,Asshole88,2012-05-31T04:25Z,"Hey Jackass, if you can't upload something that can play on anything but a computer, why bother uploading it? Quit wasting people's bandwitdh and time. Fucking Jerkoff."
,Asshole88,2012-05-31T04:33Z,i just spent my time converting it so it will play on something other than computer thanks for the upload but remember not every one wants to watch with computer people like to be with others and watch on tvs not hooked to computers 
,usethisusethis,2012-06-05T11:25Z,Did anyone else get emailed from their isp's for d'loading this?  Damn zuffa not wanting people that can't afford every ppv to see their shows.
