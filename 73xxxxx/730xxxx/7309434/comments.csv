I tried converting an mkv with srt subs and they would not sync

your releases are top quality no hassle"
[T],Snowhiter,2012-05-29T19:19Z,Would appreciate any additional feedback on quality as I think 700 mb would be more suited for a 1.5 hour runtime show. Will adjust settings for future episodes if required...

Quality is good, but I think it would be better as 700 mb for a show this length, as you mentioned."

[T],Snowhiter,2012-05-30T22:17Z,Next and all further Episodes will be at least 700mb's - thanx for the feedback ;)
