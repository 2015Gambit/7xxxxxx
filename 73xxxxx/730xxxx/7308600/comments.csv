,iryhousen,2012-05-29T13:57Z,Thanks for uploading one episode at a time.  It will seed a lot better that way.  
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-05-29T14:40Z,Thanks. I always intended to put it up daily. I managed to grab 7 off the Channel 4 site to give people a back story to start from :)
,iryhousen,2012-05-29T18:15Z,"Thanks again.  I subscribe to the channel 4 Youtube channel, but I don't think they have my favorite stuff.  "
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2012-05-29T22:40Z,"No worries :)
I will post the latest episode in a few hours. Gotta go out, then will try to rip it and upload it"
