SBS 3D, shorted for side-by-side 3D, is the best choice and widely used 3D movie and video format besides frame-sequential 3D when it comes to airing 3D content over cable to 3D TV. You may want to find SBS 3D movies and videos for your 3D TV. Instead of wasting time to find and download SBS 3D video or movie from the internet at the risk of virus, why not create SBS 3d movie easily from Blu-ray, DVD discs or common 2D videos? Now let's get down to the details of SBS 3D and DVDFab SBS 3D solutions.

As you may know that almost all 3D TVs display 3D content in frame-sequential format, that doesn't mean that the input 3D signal has to be frame-sequential 3D. Since nearly all 3D TVs can convert the 3D input in a variety of different formats on the fly to frame-sequential format for display, this saves great effort for 3D viewers. Among the different input formats, side-by-side 3D is definitely the most popular one.

 How SBS 3D Works?

In side-by-side 3D, a full 1080p or 720p frame is intended for both eyes at the same time with two halves on the left and right, and the entire frame for the left eye and right eye respectively scaled down horizontally to fit the left-half and right-half of the frame. For example, for a 720p content (resolution of 1280 x 720), the frame for the left eye will be 640 x 720 and the frame for the right eye will also be at a 640×720 resolution. When such SBS signal is received by 3D TV, the 3D TV will split each frame to extract the frame for each eye, and then will rescale these individual frames to a full HD resolution. Then these individual frames will then be displayed alternately in a frame-sequential manner which is in sync with your active shutter 3D glasses.

Advantage and Disadvantage of SBS 3D.

It's clearly that the disadvantage of SBS 3D is the halving of the horizontal resolution of the image. And the quality of SBS 3D won't be as good as sequential 3D content. But this is not pretty much noticeable and won't affect 3D enjoying very much. Why SBS 3D is popular despite a downgrading of the output quality? For the advantages overweigh the disadvantage. First, SBS 3D uses the same bandwidth as regular HD content, so it can be transmitted in the same way that current HD signals are transmitted. It is suitable for cable or air television, and also can be used in most of TVs (and some projectors). As a result, you won’t need an expensive set-top-box replacement for viewing 3D content. Besides this, SBS 3D is a nice way for you to copy and backup your 3D BD. With SBS 3D output, your backup disc can be decreased to a half size (or even smaller) of the source 3D to save you money. And what's more, the SBS 3D Blu-ray can be played in standalone 2D Blu-ray Player and watched on 3D TV, so that you don't need to buy expensive 3D BD Player.

,toryglen-boy,2012-05-30T14:31Z,"BOZX, while i am very grateful for anything that you post, and i am, wouldnt it be better if the audio tracks where separate files, wouldn't that be better? Every single person who downloads this, will download a couple of Gigs worth of data they will never use, or dump immediately?

Still, keep up the good work!  :)"

,zheweisim,2012-06-03T03:06Z,"Please don't do audio as separate files. I hate having multiple files for one piece of media. It defeats the purpose that .MKV was created for.

Thanks,"
