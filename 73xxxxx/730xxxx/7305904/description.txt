
About the only thing that we Brits can be proud ofm now, is our BBC.
I mainly upload programs from the BBC that will only appeal to a few viewers.
Some of the programs are already on TBP, but I think that I can improve on the quality.
If not, tell me !!

I do most seeding overnight, so I have no way of knowing how many take downloads, I have to depend on feedback to know whether I should continue uploading. And whether the quality of the uploads is good enough.

So please take a little time to leave some feedback on The Pirate Bay, TPB. 

And please keep seeding !!
