The dancers are dancers from VirtuaGirl HD, which I captured to setup as desktop backgrounds using DreamScene. The video file is No-Nude only.

Simply enable the Windows 7 DreamScene Activator 1.1, then right click on the video file & click on Set as Destop Background.

NOTE: In order for DreamScene to work, it needs to access some system files, your AV might flag the app as it did with me, I just made it a trusted file & all was well.

This should work with Windows 7 32 & 64bit OS.
You should disable DS when playing games or DS might crash (No big issue)
