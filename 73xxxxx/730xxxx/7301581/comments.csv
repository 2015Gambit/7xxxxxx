,naga111,2012-05-26T18:47Z,ty!
,muckymucks,2012-05-27T10:16Z,C_P uploads are shit. The quality is always SHIT!
,rogar2,2012-05-27T13:25Z,what exactly are you basing that on mate. there are no other torrents. so its either c_p or nothing. if you don't like it don't dl it simple.
,rogar2,2012-05-27T13:30Z,since c_p seem to be the only one doing these its either them or nobody.
,jojobee,2012-05-27T16:11Z,There are at least 4 people uploading this in 720p. Just not this episode yet. Just sayin'...
,muckymucks,2012-05-28T08:39Z,"A 720p will come out eventually. It's a larger file than I'd prefer but I rather have a good quality video than the shit C_P makes. Eztv used to do prestine uploads that were always DVD quality and 175Mb but I think they stopped because of C_P. Which sucks because C_P's uploads are always SHIT!

Look out for the 720p version. Download those. Don't download these."
,megate,2012-05-28T17:49Z,@muckymucks have you ever watched an ep of the show that was done by us if not then you have no right to complain about it and if i ever catch you in the irc then watch out
,muckymucks,2012-05-30T08:59Z,"The 720p version of this episode is up. Stop downloading this C_P crap and get the good one.

megate, yes, unfortunately I have watched many uploads C_P does because sadly sometimes the one they make is the only version. The quality is grainy, the frame is off, it's just crap, man. If they're going to go through the effort I don't understand why they wouldn't do it right.
