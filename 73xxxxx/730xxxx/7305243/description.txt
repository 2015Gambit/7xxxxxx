Hello everyone, this is a megadeth's album, The world needs a hero.

The World Needs a Hero is the ninth studio album by American heavy metal band Megadeth released on May 15, 2001 in the United States,[1] May 12 in Japan and May 14 in Europe.[2] It is the first of two Megadeth studio albums released by Sanctuary Records. It was the last of two studio albums to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso as well as the only one to feature Al Pitrelli on lead guitar. It was the last album to feature original bassist Dave Ellefson until his return to Megadeth in 2010 and the following album, Thirteen. The World Needs a Hero is the first Megadeth album since 1990's Rust in Peace to feature band mascot Vic Rattlehead on the front cover. Edited versions of the album put an adhesive bandage over the innards of Dave Mustaine from which Vic Rattlehead is seen emerging.
