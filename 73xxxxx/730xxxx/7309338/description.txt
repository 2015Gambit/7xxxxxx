Jazz - love it or hate it - it's like Marmite. This is a torrent of Thad Jones Detroit - New York Junction. There is another torrent on TPB but it stops at 99.5%, which is a real pi$$er. Accordingly, here is a full CD in flac, courtesy of an EAC rip followed by a source conversion with Freemake Audio Converter. Both utilities are recommended and are free.

This CD was recorded in 1956 by Rudy Van Gelder at his studio in New Jersey. It is released on Blue Note 1513. Listen and if you enjoy it, buy the CD!
