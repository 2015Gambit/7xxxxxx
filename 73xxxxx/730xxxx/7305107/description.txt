Nature Field Guides #3 and #4 completely replace the old Nature Field Guides #1, with extra books, reorganized directories, and some improved versions.  The mammals/mammalogists PDF files haven't changed, so you can save 200 MB of downloading if you already have those from the old torrent.

You'll need to unzip these files to use these particular audio files or html books:

birds/What_The_Robin_Knows/What_The_Robin_Knows.zip  - 75 .ogg audio files from birdlanguage.com
mammals/squirrels/squirrels.zip
misc/SlimeMolds/SlimeMolds.zip
plants/ModernHerbal/ModernHerbal.zip

This torrent includes a few more plant books, plus fish, birds, reptiles & amphibians, insects, mammals, and miscellaneous.  See the NatureFieldGuides#4.txt file for a full list of titles and authors.
