[ Namin,  China, 1 Year earlier ]
If you count it another way, you get 365, but only one answer is correct
I don't want to be disrespectful, Mr. Suk, but your calculations are wrong.

4
00:01:47,324 --> 00:02:01,971
Mej, we will get you to another school.
-But here are all my friends and my mother-
Mej, you are so smart, you have to go to a special school & new friends!

5
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:07,538
Don't be sad, Mej, we will always be your friends.
I heard the boys in Peking are great, you will like it.

5
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:14,538
-But I don't even like numbers, I like my friends and don't want to make new one, I dont like math at all!-
Oh yea, you will like it, don't worry, we gonna write letters every week.

5
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:20,538
You will?
Of course, we want to stay in touch with a celebrity!

6
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:31,434
Oh Mej!
This is my niece, you know her?

7
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:35,470
She is in my class.

8
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,572
She tells, that your brain is working like a computer

9
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:43,764
We have spoken with your teacher and he confirmed it.

10
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,496
That's why you are here!

00:04:46,497 --> 00:05:03,922
Little girl...
Computers are so unsafe, they leave traces which people can follow

12

It's said, that if you learn something, you'll never forget it again.
Is that right?

13
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:20,920
Then we'll go to your home and kill your mother for giving birth to such a stupid girl!

14
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:37,278
So its true

15
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:46,020
Mr.Suk also told us that your father left you and your mother. Also that your mother is very sick.

16
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:51,121
Soon you will be completely on your own.
Do you want that?

17
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:58,944
Then we will take care of your mother.

18
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:12,479
This is Chan, your new father.   He will take you far away, from our enemys.
When you get there, you will calculate for us.

00:10:47,220 --> 00:11:19,727

,MyKrossini,2012-05-31T13:36Z,A/V 5/8 Very watchable. Audio could use some work. Maybe a new audio source? Also needs subs and none of the current available subs are legitimately complete. Some are almost complete but are still missing a couple lines here and there. No big deal. Thanks neon.

The picture is great, but the audio scratches a bit every now and then. I keep having to adjust my volume to hear dialogue. Otherwise, it's a good copy. Thanks neon

Re: Subtitles

The above subtitles are... passable. Mainly because common sense fills in the blanks. Some guy just said, in a Russian accent, ""I swear on my mother"" - the subtitles read ""I step on my mother""... I don't think these subtitles were written by a human, maybe a speech-to-text program. Because there are moments where the words make no sense and you know that can't be what they're saying. There are some foreign bits of dialogue that aren't covered, but the missing bits aren't vital to the story.

If somebody can find a better version, please post it. If not, these subtitles will get you through the movie alright. Thanks kclayr"
