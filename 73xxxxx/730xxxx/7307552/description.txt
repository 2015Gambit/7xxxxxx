1. We rarely do snapshot updates to fix bugs, but since 21a contained an annoying bug 

that made it hard to play single-player we decided to do one this week. There are 

still problems, but weΓÇÖre getting there!



2. We added a new creative mode inventory screen.

3. We also updated the language files to correct the diamond/emerald mix-up in the    

   language files (diamonds were previously called emerald in the code, which caused 

   a lot of confusion when we added a real emerald item). We had to ban another 

   translator for griefingΓÇª it?s astonishing how much work some people put into these 

   thingsΓÇª :)
