Tengy if you want mp4 down this file then download MkvToonix and Mp4box, Extract the Video and Audio source then use mp4 to mux in back together and it should give you mp4 should take about 10-20depending on your computer."

,DreamExtractor,2012-05-28T23:30Z,Thanks for the upload....
,Judirek,2012-05-29T20:46Z,"@Daman4Iife - Looking forward to your upload of this w/ subs sir! And if I may, please do make it .mp4, .avi or still .mkv as to why .avi/.mp4 to me, they can be played directly in our PS3 no need of conversion. As for .mkv videos I need to use WinAvi All-in-One converter though I doubt it can reduce the quality of the movie. 

The movie was great, fast paced while still introducing important characters and happenings, the 3D CGI also blended well w/ the armors and weapons but not that well on the characters particularly the Zodd part only a few hand drawn animation of Zodd was made, all fight scenes were astounding and captivating and it gives me the itch to watch the 2nd movie.

,gutsrage,2012-06-03T11:32Z,There is a subtitle group called Sayonara this movie is in progress of being translated. So it shouldn't be too far away for good subs.
,Judirek,2012-06-03T11:37Z,"@cerozze - Thanks for the subs news update I hope it will be finish as soon as possible, about the comments not appearing after submitting it if the board you're writing it on disappears it means that it is posted if it doesn't disappear or the text is still there it's not posted and going again to the torrent page to see your comments if isn't there it just needs a few refresh or just come back again."

,frvme,2012-06-26T00:03Z,"@Judirek

What do you mean no conversion ? It's an Mkv file you ultimately have to since ps3 don't play mkv.

the file cannot be played directly."
,frvme,2012-06-27T02:22Z,"Just found one though the subtitles are in french it's an mp4 file ready to transfer directly onto your ps3's HDD so you'll keep it safe and ready to listen to !!

huh can't post the link, anyways just search for Berserk l'âge d'or vostfr mp4 in google and check for the TÉLÉCHARGER BERSERK : L'ÂGE D'OR, PARTIE I

and look for theses servers
