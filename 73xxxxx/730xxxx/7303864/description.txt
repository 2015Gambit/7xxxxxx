Okay guys, i am proud to bring you "God of War: Ghost of Sparta" for PSP. 
small enough to fit on a 1GB card!!
there wasn't any good ones up so i decided to do it.

This is my first torrent and first game rip ever. so let me know what you think!!

Now in order to get the game this small i had to take out some music. which is hardly noticeable. but,

---NOTICE!! PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING!!!!-----

The only bad thing is i ripped some cut-scenes so don't expect a perfect game. on a lot of the cut-scenes a --DEMO VIDEO-- will play. But i left in enough cut-scenes so that the game is still very enjoyable. sometimes you get that random unexpected video and it will catch you off guard. but that's about the worst of it.

KILLER GAME!!

-TESTED ON CFW 6.60 PRO B10
ON PSP-1001

SEED LIKE CRAZY! SO EVERYONE GETS A TASTE!
--COMMENTS ARE ENCOURAGED! AND A THANKS IS ALWAYS APPRECIATED!!

ENJOY GUYS.
