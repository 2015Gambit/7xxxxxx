Journey to Portugal is a politically engaged film about European procedures at airport border control and the inhuman treatment that has become totally accepted nowadays.

Of all the passengers on her plane, Maria is the only one to be detained and interrogated by the Immigration Police.

The situation turns into a nightmare when the Police officers realize that the man waiting for Maria at the airport is Senegalese.
