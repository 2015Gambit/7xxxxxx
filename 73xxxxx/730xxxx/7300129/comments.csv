,ditto007,2012-05-26T06:47Z,i don't suppose this has english subtitles?
,eth3n,2012-05-26T07:44Z,"No, this is a RAW (I believe the option for jap subtitles was put into the .MKV)"
,Judirek,2012-05-26T07:52Z,"Can anyone upload a smaller size of this?
19.2gigs would surely take a month or so for me to finish, our connection speed at max. is 160kb/s assuming it's always running at that speed. Maybe a DVD below 2gigs or a Blu-Ray below 5gigs would surely be appreciated by slow internet connection people like me. Anyways I'm still grateful that someone uploaded this as early as now, people w/ fast connection speed would surely be thankful, lastly to those who read this and already downloaded the movie if possible please upload a smaller size movie for us poor bastards."
,Faulknen,2012-05-26T13:46Z,"Poor bastards indeed.

Immensely grateful to you for posting this, I've been searching the internet like a zombie for the past few days.

Though I'm a bit worried that I've been connecting only to peers, out of the ninety-something seeds that are shown theres no single connection. It's downloading pretty fast right now, hope it doesn't just stop abruptly, that the seeds are just at their connection limit right now.

Anyway, once again, thanks a lot."
,Judirek,2012-05-26T15:59Z,"@Faulknen - Man you could be our hero! I'm begging if you have the time after you finish downloading it, please convert it to a smaller output then upload it on TPB. From Feb. 4, I started searching for this release day after day till I heard that the DVD/Blu-Ray release date is on Mar. 23 so I waited again then when that day came I sought for it up to Mar. 26 when suddenly someone linked this from SuprBay! Days of so much regret disappeared in an instant however a few seconds past it reappeared...Why? Cause of the size! Please man as I've said my max download speed is 160kb/s, it would take a month or 2 and I'm very sure I'm not the only one who's suffering here, this is driving me nuts so please end our sorrow. :("
,gutsrage,2012-05-26T17:04Z,"First off I appreciate this upload a lot. Would love subtitles for the movie but it's a lot better then nothing I too have been waiting for what seems like months and months for this. However, like some other comments have stated this file is rather large and would take most people several days to download. Would someone be kind enough to upload this and encode it properly and shrink the file size drastically? Thanks again."
,Faulknen,2012-05-26T17:29Z,"@Judirek - I hear you, bro. I was thinking of doing it anyway.

Only problem is, the speed is starting to act up at 31%, lets hope it's not permanent and the bandwith starts rolling again. Anywho, I'll comment here again once I have the file.

So unless someone has already done it before I'm finished downloading, I'll get to it right away, so sit tight."
,ceegronlee,2012-05-26T17:32Z,"we need this fansubbed - stat!

thanks for the upload"
,ceegronlee,2012-05-26T17:34Z,"started this last night btw, and I seem to be stuck at 31% and no seeds."
,josh3394,2012-05-26T17:45Z,"so a little clarification for you guys since i know where this torrent came from, this is the first raw that came up, and were lucky to have it, basically some guy at /a/ was in a berserk movie thread and just said ""hey my connections not great and ive never made a torrent before but i could give it a shot if you guys want"" since he already had it ripped on his computer, the size is due to him knowing absolutely nothing about encoding, also hes still the first 100% seeder, to the guy stuck at 31%, so am i, though its not really stuck, its just now youre caught up with everyone, im there too and i was one of the very first people to get the torrent, chances are at the rate its been going we will have it sometime in the next 36 hours, hope this helps guys, sorry for the length"
,michnagy,2012-05-26T18:45Z,"It's not stucked, I'm 33% now and rising. Will seed this for weeks if needed"
,Messenger3,2012-05-26T20:03Z,I have been waiting so long for this. I can't thank you and the other bro enough. My love for you is like a truck.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-26T20:11Z,my 3GIg version is coming soon
,ceegronlee,2012-05-26T20:33Z,yeah it's moved a little since my last posting. I'll def help seed this when it completes.
,7garry7,2012-05-26T20:52Z,can anyone tell me when  the dubbed version will be released .....
,herpderp3556,2012-05-26T21:09Z,"if any of you leechers manage to get the whole file, please have the decency to encode it to a proper format and file size. don't wait for someone else to do it. there are several easy guides on the internet on how to do this."
,LunarParadox,2012-05-26T21:20Z,"im counting on you daman,been downloading for about 7h and only 36% and speed drops and goes back all the time..also stop asking for english version release dates,if you had even tried to search for it you would know,check animenewsnetwork or something..berserk has been licensed in usa by VIZ Media and first movie will be available this fall,and its been licensed in 16 other countries too..its been published on official berserk fb page and homepage,theres even fb page for berserk saga from VIZ ,dont be lazy asses"
,LunarParadox,2012-05-26T21:57Z,"I used preview option on bitcomet and it kinda leaped through moviee,here are few screens i managed to capture ..movies is 1080p with 6channel jap audio,it showed 2 japanese language tracks,first was on by default and i didnt hear anything,so switched to second and it worked fine...

,eth3n,2012-05-26T22:27Z,"To clarify, there is only one seed at the moment, despite TPB saying like 10 and your torrent client saying zero. The one seed is the original uploader, and those of us leeching since the word go are at approximately 40%. This will most likely take another 20 or so hours due to the poor uploading speed of the original uploader, however IT IS LEGIT, and he has assured us that he will continue seeding."
,mykey2,2012-05-26T22:48Z,"As a rough estimate, it looks like about 20% every 12 hours. We're currently at about 40%. So that leaves 36 hours to go."
,Messenger3,2012-05-26T23:37Z,So at 40% I was able to look through some of the mkv and see a large chunk of the beginning of the movie... including the subtitles. Who wants to be a baller and translate while we wait?
,Karasu539,2012-05-26T23:48Z,"Original uploader here. Just giving a quick update: The highest leecher is at a little over 60%, and at the rate its going for him he should have it all by early tomorrow, so hopefully things speed up a bit once he has it all. I'm sorry about the slowness of the upload but I'm doing what I can.   "
,Faulknen,2012-05-27T00:15Z,"@Karasu539

No sweat, we'll wait. Thanks for the upload."
,mykey2,2012-05-27T01:22Z,Does anyone know if there is a way to extract the japanese subs out? Running them through a Japanese->English translator would be a quick and easy way to get at least some form of english subs.
,LunarParadox,2012-05-27T01:26Z,"here's tut..though i suggest you to wait for proper subbed version,which is probably gonna get released sometime next week

http://www.dvd-guides.com/content/view/157/59/"
,ceegronlee,2012-05-27T02:53Z,65% with about a 10 hour ETA.
,LunarParadox,2012-05-27T03:13Z,daaamn... http://www.bildites.lv/images/mo0llnjxnxweec98mcsa.png
,mykey2,2012-05-27T06:07Z,Why is there one guy that's 20% ahead of everyone else?
,Giger79,2012-05-27T06:28Z,"Finally reached 60% here. 1 day (!) remaining...  I probably shouldn't mention Usenet here, and I apologize in advance, but has the original uploader considered uploading this movie there?  For someone with a super-fast connection, they would quickly download 19.2 GBs from Usenet..."
,michnagy,2012-05-27T07:11Z,"I'm seeding with a seedbox 1gbit here, I think this will help you people. Now I'm on 61%"
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-27T08:40Z,"All i can say, you guys will be disappointed on how the movie look, looks a like a video game instead of a movie."
,Isugi,2012-05-27T08:55Z,"can't agree with you. It looks awesome. I've watched it in cinema, and the way it looks is the best difference. :)

Thank's for the movie! 63% now."
,Akojin,2012-05-27T09:19Z,I seed at like 500kB/s... and my download speed is 100-200kB/s. Guys SEED please. I will continue to seed for weeks.
,Predakol,2012-05-27T09:20Z,"Yeah! Almost 60% now, berserk is awaiting for me dudes)))))))))))"
,herpderp3556,2012-05-27T09:22Z,Berserk is memorable because of its plot and character development. I don't think most fans are going to be concerned about the animation quality especially after seeing the TV series.
,Judirek,2012-05-27T10:56Z,"@Faulknen - Thanks for assuring us man, now I know that, I felt so much relief, all of you people here in TPB are what the world needs. Some people like me just can't afford, in our country corrupt government -> poor economy -> low exchange rate 1 dollar = 43.8 and the price of the movie is about 70 dollars = 3,070 would take  a min. of 3 months for me to save, I'm still 17 so I'm still attending school.
@Daman4Iife - Thanks for your FMA: Sacred Star of Milos, Rurouni Kenshin New Kyoto Arc and concerning the animation, Rurouni Kenshin has no 3D CGI as I recall but the film/OVA is only 45mins, fans aren't that satisfied. There are Berserk fans out there for about 20yrs and most of them waited for a decade for it to see a new light, what matters most IMHO is if it sticks true to the canon matter and won't avoid major events like the first anime series though I don't like the implementation of CG, I've been a fan of the manga for 5 months only, I just can't get enough of it."
,WMaedhros,2012-05-27T11:42Z,"A message to the few seeders out there:

Turn on superseeding, please!

At this pace I think everyone's gonna finish the download at the same time."
,michnagy,2012-05-27T16:02Z,"I'm Seeding here at 10mb/s. Uploaded 96gb, Share Ratio: 6.4 so far. :D "
,pewpawn,2012-05-27T16:28Z,can some jap dude give us eng subtitle for this :O)
,ShadowNess-,2012-05-27T17:12Z,how can Get this torrent ?!!!
,Judirek,2012-05-27T17:35Z,How can you people download fast even though the seeds are so little and there are so many leechers? Is it the torrent client? BitTorrent or Âľtorrent? Or is it a download manager like Jdownloader? 
,pewpawn,2012-05-27T18:06Z,no there is only 5 seeders that have 100% and they uploading fast be pantient.As soon i get 100% will seed for months
,LunarParadox,2012-05-27T20:00Z,"Well I''not really that bothered of CG cellshading and its mostly used just in large battles,overall anime is more hand drawn,also next movies will look more better,from what ive seen in trailers and montage included in movie,it blends more perfectly and isnt used that much,but how well we will probably know when 2nd movie releases

Anyone can translate this for english or pt-br? Pls?"
,gutsrage,2012-05-28T07:44Z,New upload of the movie from user  ZackMustDie it is only 2.44 GB :) no Eng subs though but it would be a much more manageable download.
,gutsrage,2012-05-28T07:54Z,http://www.nyaa.eu/?page=torrentinfo&tid=318042 another download at 2 GB.
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-05-28T07:56Z,"Anizark, it wont matter if you give the subs, running it through a translator program wont work, you either need someone that can read Japanese Translate it to ENglish Which is just as much Work as doing it from scratch, subs from a proper group should be out in 1-2weeks"
