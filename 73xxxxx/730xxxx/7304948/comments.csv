and i know nothing about how to burn this torrent to be a Xbox dvd   can u help plz?????
i know it sounds silly"
,Swining,2012-05-28T09:21Z,CrematoryKid: Don't bother with this game then. Dirt 3 will work but with this and some other games its just not possible unless you buy an iHas burner.

First of all u need a xbox 360 that is flashed with IX 3.0.

Second. U need a Ihas DVDr burner.

The rest is simple and u will find all u need to know on google. :P"
,CrematoryKid,2012-05-28T18:19Z,"@sunblock
ix 3.0  is the same Lt 3.0?????
Ihas burner is what?????
is that somekind of DVD writer?????"
,Swining,2012-05-28T19:27Z,"Correct, its the same so you don't need to worry. iHas is a brand that makes a specific dvd burner (Revision B, specifically iHAS524-T26 B) that you can install iExtreme Burner Max F/W to that will allow you to burn the ISO 100% 

This game unfortunately uses the last 3% because nobody with the truncate/overburn method has got it working. There are people with iHas that have it working but some with the drives that report that it still doesn't work (xbox360iso)."

thanx for reply"
,pirates4eva,2012-05-28T21:51Z,@swining i'm sure on the boobsman release of this you state that everyone with ihas has got this working.but now you say some have some havenot i would say that is contradicting yourself. and btw ihas is not a brand at all its a model number of liteon. but you go on like you know everything lol.
,CrematoryKid,2012-05-29T13:16Z,"@pirateforeva    what do u mean by it s a model number???okay
what shuld i say to the sales man to buy it????"
,pirates4eva,2012-05-29T14:20Z,"@CrematoryKid hi there IHAS is a model number of liteon there is 6 diferent models all containing difrent features smart erase/label tag/lightscribe.etc but none of these features of the drives matter for burning your games they can all be flashed with the burner max f/w all the extra features dont realy matter they jus cost more. here is the list of drives 
iHAS124B-base model 
iHAS224B
iHAS324B
iHAS424B
iHAS524B
iHAS624B-best model
all the drives inbetween just contain difrent features.if you just want the cheapest model its the 1st one.you can also buy this drive pre-flashed with the burner max f/w you can get them on ebay cheap but make sure its REVISION B!!! basicly make sure the number has the B at the end."
,CrematoryKid,2012-05-29T16:33Z,"@piratesforeva  got it
