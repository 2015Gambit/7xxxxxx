Henryk Szeryng's supreme 1955 recording, the definitive interpretation of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin (composed 1720). Includes the famous Chaconne from Partita No.2, described thus by Brahms: 'On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience would have driven me out of my mind'
