,imgettingangryreallyfast,2012-05-26T15:45Z,"WHY DOWNLOAD THE TORRENT THEN RE-UPLOAD IT LIKE IT WAS YOURS TO BEGIN WITH? 

STUPID "

,Vince82,2012-05-27T11:59Z,"imgettingangryreallyfast, the only reason someone would have to download something and re-upload it is because the person is using a program like darkcomet or prorat, create a server (virus back door), crypt it with a fully undetectable crypter so no anti virus detect it and bind it to the video file so when you double click on the video to watch it, it works but you also install the back door server on your computer without knowing it so now the guy can watch you through your webcam, take screenshots of your desktop, view your file, get all your password for online banking of any sort or any account like facebook etc...  You can also control the computer at distance and make the infected know something is wrong because its funny as hell but that would risk his reputation on piratebay as a viable source of virus spreading."
,spaceballz2010,2012-05-27T17:37Z,"im not going to doubt you, that could be a possibility.  However i trust the people here with a skull.  If you have been around for a bit you would know that heromaster is not shady.  The best names i have come across are froggie, TVTEAM ETTV, HEROMASTER, extremezone, Bone, Eztv and a few others.  These uploaders i can tell you without question are solid.  If i didnt add your name im sorry these are just off the top of my head.  I dont need to worry about my banking because i dont use a computer to do it.  One of the biggest crimes out there is identity theft.  It has happened to me and the perpetrator did not get my info from a website like this.  Not saying it cant and wont happen, IM saying these guys put a lot of work so we can watch all these shows/movies.  As for people dowloading and reuploading.  Some people on here only download of specific people.  You ever think that they were asked to upload it no matter where it came from.  Also some actually put in the work to make a copy better.  A good example might be using a rusian copy for video that has bad audio and mixing it with a better audio sources.  Im sure they have their reasons for doing what they do.  And i ask that they dont stop.  I dont want one choice when i come here.  I want to be able to look through a few sources, even if they all using the same original copy  of file.  Thank you up-loaders.  Without you guys i would have to watch tv, and that would suck."
,Trout__,2012-05-27T19:49Z,"Noooo!!! SpaceBallz!!!  It just CANNOT be that bad!!  ""WATCH TV""???  as in ""broadcast""???  Oh the pain...the pain of it all!!!   :D"
,goingfishingbob,2012-05-27T20:43Z,"Trout__  comment is awesome & true as hell,
I'm loven it !!! ,Broadcast Television you mean ""Commercials"" the pain of it all .
anyone find a somewhat watchable copy yet ? ,,
Yet again I see from the 7 posted links for Men in Black III.2012,no one has a nothing good to say ""whatsoever"" .Many thanks for the Up-loaders effort, but for us poor country folk who can't afford a $16:00 movie fee ,it would be nice to have this one ,arg,!!, "
,91758595,2012-05-27T23:46Z,"what's ""television""? I assume if we break the word up into its component pieces we would get ""tele"" which means long distance and ""vision"" which means sight. add comercials to that and i am looking at a billboard from a great distance? what's the point?"
,Exilious,2012-05-28T01:35Z,Damn who do they got recording this shit? Michael J Fox?
,ronangel,2012-05-28T04:38Z,"There is a way to stop remote controlling of your computer. All you have to do is delete  the relevant .dll and exe files that allow it to happen from your computers windows operating system, then even you as administrator  cannot remote control your computer even if you physically give a person asking permission to do so, with all passwords. Putting a piece of tape over your webcam lens will prevent them the shock of seeing you naked ( In my case it would be a shock) how many of you leave the lid open while you or your partner undress/dress in the background. "
,Iceburgslim,2012-05-28T07:18Z,"Does this have the ending? Or is it missing like the other ones?

Free or not, if it's only part of something, it's not really a favor."
,-Norcal-,2012-05-28T08:25Z,"We're sorry, the torrent you've downloaded is the same crappy version as all the others. Download the next MIB 3 torrent and try again. Thanks for playing! One of these will be a winner soon."

,arturbo,2012-05-30T15:31Z,"Hi i can't believe nobody fix this yet when its a complete version out there, but its in spanish so if any of you uploaders wants to fix it maybe cut the end of that version and add it to this one we will have a complete version just add english audio to it,
or if somebody wants to see the end go ahead and download it and its not 11 min of movie missing like somebody said, its just like 3 min tops, well ok here its the link i hope it helps http://www.subtorrents.com/peliculas/men-in-black-3-2012-20806/"

,NYTDDS,2012-05-31T02:36Z,"all you people are retarded. first of all he didn't name this torrent, the lamer who posted this is the one at fault. As for HeroMaster deciding to believe it before watching the piece of shit himself. that's a mistake that can take helper away."
