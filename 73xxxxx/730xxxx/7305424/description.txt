I was asked kindly if i could promote some songs for a friend.. 
Song 1 is more suited to the Techno - House types 
song 2 has instrumental of the year written all over it and could easily slip into a radio playlist anywhere, this is the only version available although the 5 minute version is better
song 3 i don't know where the medication was when he created this lol.. but the beat! to it is awesome.. 
Check them out, there free no stress, please seed for others to Enjoy! 
Bubs...
