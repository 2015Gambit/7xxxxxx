This book is a compilation of key notes and best papers of the 2010 Sustainable Building Euregional Conference. The book addresses questions on how to design new buildings and districts with optimized energy and water systems with materials that neither deplete resources, nor add to climate change by CO2 emissions. 0-impact goes one step further than 0-energy. It addresses building and design issues from an environmentally neutral perspective. It not only includes energy-neutral building, but adds the challenge of water use, production and use of materials, and land use.
