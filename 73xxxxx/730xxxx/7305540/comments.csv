,Fayo,2012-05-29T09:59Z,"Great show, finally something to replace 'Touch' for me, I started getting toothache from that one. 

Reminds me of Dark Angel with J. Alba, potentially better but who knows, too early to tell. SG... I dont know :)

Good quality."

,cldrain,2012-05-29T18:02Z,"Actually, this show is pretty good.  The story is good and acting is good.

Can't wait to see episode 2.  But I do not see this show can last longer than 3 seasons.  Anyway, it's a good show, so far."
