Parenting in the 21st century is not easy, even if your family is very traditional (i.e. not reconstituted).  This is what you'll discover by sharing the daily life of the Parent family in this warm comedy composed of various vignettes of thirty seconds to three minutes.
The Parent family consists of mother Natalie, father Louis-Paul, and the three boys they have together: Thomas, 14 years old, Olivier, 12 years old, and 8-year-old Zacharie.  Each week, we are invited into their teeming world of life, to experience the full range of feelings, from calms to thunderstorms.
In this family chronicle, the Parent parents try to deal with any eventuality.  But how can a professor of English, on the verge of burnout, deal with his child, whom he is convinced is the reincarnation of Hitler in person?  How to defuse the situation at the dinner table when the older boys teach the youngest the "art" of speaking in belches?  How to manage the discovery of the website "The Queen of Sex" and other websites that the web filter, infallible in theory, let pass?  How to engage three "All-Boys" into doing household chores?  How to deal with the week of spring break and a thousand-and-one other suggestive situations that will make you smile -- sometimes with some grinding of teeth!
