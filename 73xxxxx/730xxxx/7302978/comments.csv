,jbanes,2012-05-27T05:33Z,"Got it. Not familiar with the .HTMLZ format, though. Put it on my kindle, but it didn't show up. Ran it through Calibre's conversion and got a .MOBI file my kindle could handle. Really wacky formatting though. I notice this happens regularly with ebooks published by Prometheus Books.

Thanks again. I will seed for a week or two."
,ImSoJaded,2012-05-27T11:10Z,"Finally, thanks."
,ImSoJaded,2012-05-27T11:18Z,"By the way, you can use Calibre to open this format, and to convert it to EPUB, MOBI or PDF. The formatting is not the best, but it is entirely readable in Calibre Viewer, or on an Android smartphone."
,steppenwolf27,2012-07-17T18:57Z,Thanks for reuploading this. Is there any chance you'll be able to reupload the mobi version?
