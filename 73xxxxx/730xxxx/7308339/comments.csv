VH1 has teamed up with Queen Latifah's Flavor Unit Entertainment to bring viewers ""Single Ladies"", a new comedic drama series that asks the question what do women really want in a relationship? The series will mark VH1's first foray into the hour-long scripted genre. The movie was shot in the summer of 2010 and the series is set to begin production in late 2010. The movie and series will both premiere in July 2011. ""Single Ladies"" is a comedic drama about Val, Keisha, and April - three best friends with different philosophies on sex and relationships. Val (Stacey Dash) is an ambitious aspiring fashion mogul who wants to find a true partner. Keisha (LisaRaye McCoy), on the other hand, is a former video dancer just looking for a rich man to keep her in style. April (Charity Shea,) has supposedly found the perfect man and the perfect marriage - but is learning that marriage isn't necessarily a happy ending. ""Single Ladies"" is a modern, sexy series set in the world of Atlanta fashion, music, and celebrity that will constantly explore which woman has the right approach to relationships. (Source: VH1)
