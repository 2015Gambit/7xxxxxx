,Flimx,2012-05-28T04:31Z,"TS files are MPEG-2 video files (TS == Transport Stream), recordings of television broadcasts (in high definition).

Can be played with VLC. But i am not certain this is fake or real though."
,ReginaId,2012-05-28T04:32Z,".TS are recordings of Television, holy shit. Just play it on VLC and done."
,damodamo_,2012-05-28T04:32Z,"legit, just make sure you have vlc or similar to play .ts file"

,blyds,2012-05-28T04:46Z,not fake
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-28T04:46Z,"Yes. It's real. Shut up with the fake shit already.

People didn't like that I wrapped the .ts in .mkv containers, so I decided not to wrap it in .mkv this time and see how people enjoy having the actual transport stream file since it has more support for playback. 

Don't ignorantly rate the torrent down when you don't even have it yet and I went through the trouble of uploading this for you in its best quality. "
,texasyankee,2012-05-28T04:46Z,"This guy seems to be working on getting a trusted skull.  I am downloading, and will comment on the quality later.  I want to start uploading myself, so i know how hard it can be to get started on TPB.  "
,damodamo_,2012-05-28T04:46Z,"Skulls versions now available, abort, abort!"
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-28T04:50Z,"Yes. It's real. Shut up with the fake shit already.

.ts is the same exact quality as the broadcast on TV. Or at least as identical as anything in the world can get to it depending on the capture box settings.

I'll make it simple = this.will.be.the.best.copy.released.like.all.my.other.releases.
thnx."
,pesok77,2012-05-28T05:05Z,any english subtitles for this yet?
,EricLou,2012-05-28T05:18Z,Cheers!
,TheTopher,2012-05-28T05:25Z,"Legit.
Nice torrent, great quality.
Keep up the good work and you might have a skull.

Seeding at full speed."
,micron66,2012-05-28T05:40Z,"yes,it's real,quality is better than the IMMERSE release."
,cooisat,2012-05-28T06:02Z,"Enough with retads coments like ""fake"".
This is a good torrent."
[T],SecTPB,2012-05-28T07:21Z,"Everything supports it. If it doesn't support something(Like PS3), change file extension from .ts to .mpg and you're fine. Even crappy players like ?VLC will play .ts perfectly."
,.Leto.,2012-05-28T09:56Z,"Ignore the stupid comments, I just finished downloading this and it's of course not a fake. About the .TS file extension I have no problem at all reading this with kmplayer, mediaplayerclassic, vlc,... 
Quality is really great. Thanks :)"
,snukey,2012-05-28T10:02Z,"almost perfect. slight hiccup in the first scene, but i don't think we miss any dialogue because of it.  otherwise, very good.  

still looking for a perfect file for my collection, tho."
,SDE_Bellisarius,2012-05-28T10:56Z,"Its real and great quality


REAL"
,SDE_Bellisarius,2012-05-28T10:57Z,Its real and great quality
,azitromax,2012-05-28T11:11Z,"Thanks for the upload. I don't understand why the retards are writing comments that this is fake, because it's definitely not. 
Good quality upload. 
Thanks for sharing! "
,Froglet,2012-05-28T13:03Z,"Thanks very much SecTPB. Good luck on getting your skull soon, then you won't have the irritating drone of half-witted onanists declaiming your every great upload as fake."
,Froglet,2012-05-28T14:45Z,"Just thought I would mention, this is a really, really clean version. Very high quality with a really good sample rate, so you are advised to use VLC in preference to lighter-weight players, such as GOM. I love GOM, but it's a little bit jerky when it plays a file of this quality."
,bitate42,2012-05-28T15:28Z,YOU FUCKING ROCK. I seek out your torrrents exclusively no. 
,Egregius,2012-05-28T20:19Z,"The problem I'm running into is that although it plays extremely well, I can't get it to open with a subtitle-file I downloaded in VLC. If I open it in VLC and then either drag&drop a .srt file, I open a subtitle file manually, OR I rename it the same as the file and put it in the same directory...it doesn't open."
,Egregius,2012-05-28T20:20Z,"It does work in MPC though, though of course off-sync because it's made for a different rip."
,NewGoldStandard,2012-05-29T01:35Z,"wonderful quality.
please keep them coming!"
,thatbb6,2012-05-30T08:14Z,"A:10

Video is not as clear as other HD uploader but it was the fastest to dl. Thanks"
,rogue321,2012-06-09T04:14Z,I got a copyright infringement email from HBO for downloading this torrent.  Watch out!
,eekstah,2012-06-17T23:44Z,"Unlike the IMMERSE releases, this is totally unwatchable when you play it on a Samsung TV via an USB stick."
