Jeremy Wade remembers his past experiences with deadly catfish, such as the man-eating goonch catfish, credited with a series of fatal attacks on humans, or the piraiba catfish, which is built like a shark and has a reputation for eating people.
                                                                                

RELEASE NOTES: Original source is PAL. We removed the double blends well enough but can't get it prefect due to network conversion to 29.97 FPS.
