Taking place at the same time as "Tunnel Vision", "Triangulation" and "Triage", Bulkhead is met with life-threatening danger when he is attacked by the Insecticon Hardshell during his search for "Tox-N", a toxic form of energon (the fourth and final relic of Iacon), which he must depose of in order to keep Megatron and the Decepticons from using it to create a deadly bio-weapon, while being hunted by Hardshell and his team of Insecticons.
