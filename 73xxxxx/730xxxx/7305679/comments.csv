,elDunge,2012-05-29T14:06Z,We need a 720p torrent uploader
,xpmule,2012-05-29T21:49Z,"i'd post it but i don't see the point if some other well known uploaders are gonna re upload it days later.. also i have a horribly slow upload speed :(

its not really possible for these guys to see all the releases available except the 720p versions.. they are shared usualy in the same topics all over the net so i don't know why this TV show specificly has the 720p's ignored. Doesn't seem to be any any issues getting a torrent for most other shows (@ 720p) on TPB"
