Compulsion is 0/2 tonight. First horrid sync problems on Single Ladies and now 16 seconds of missing dialogue and music at the end of American Teenager

Really how do you lose 16 seconds of audio. Oh yeah you chop it into 16 second pieces and forget to upload the final audio file

Also we've told you consistantly, Immerse has told you consistantly, your encodes look far worse then ours at the same CRF setting. Why is this?, You tell us. There's some source differences between providers but really
