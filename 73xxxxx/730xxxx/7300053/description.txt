Onward and Upward

Harry's ex-husband is found dead with no
one to claim the body, burdening her with
planning the funeral which to her surprise
stirs up more emotion than she
anticipated. Meanwhile, with Tommy's help,
Harry agrees to represent a man publicly
named a person of interest in the murder
of his ex-wife. Elsewhere, Oliver tries to
rope Cassie into representing a student
who is suing the Law School that denied
her entrance because they practice
affirmative action. Other romantic
entanglements are tested when Adam is
pitted against Phoebe after he takes on
the case of a man fired for constantly
popping his false teeth in and out of his
mouth.
