This dynamic group, started in 1989, has developed their version of the Eastern Kentucky flavor by combining bluegrass, southern gospel and country, applied to their own original compositions and arrangements, and enhanced by their spiritual convictions. Their performances are marked by their soaring vocal renditions in three and four part harmony.

5 For The Gospel was named Traditional Gospel Group of the Year at the SPBGMA National Awards Show in Nashville in 1997 and 1999.
