It really used to annoy the hell out of us when the Australian TV network which used to show Y&R would bump the show for the cricket. So, each year we'd get further behind (up to 3 years, I believe).

Now that we're getting it ""live"" I'm surprised that the show gets bumped for sport in the US. And even for a public holiday."
