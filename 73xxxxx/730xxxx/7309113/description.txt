Doraemon The Future 2008, or fully known as Nobita and the Legend of the Green Giant (Eiga Doraemon Nobita to Midori no Kyojinden, μÿáτö╗ πâëπâ⌐πüêπééπéô πü«πü│σñ¬πü¿τ╖æπü«σ╖¿Σ║║Σ╝¥ Eiga Doraemon Nobita To Midori No Kyojinden), is an anime film that was released in Japan on 8 March 2008.

The story is based on the story in volume 26 "Forest is living" and in volume 33 "Goodbye Ki-b┼ì". This movie is not a remake, however, Ki-b┼ì has appeared already in the 1992 film, Nobita and the Kingdom of Clouds. The name Ki-b┼ì comes from the words "Ki" (μ£¿?) meaning tree, and "B┼ì" (σ¥è?) meaning boy. The word Ki-b┼ì also comes from the word "Kib┼ì" (σ╕îμ£¢?), which means hope. The catch phrase of this movie is "σâòπéëπü«σ╕îμ£¢πüîμ£¬μ¥ÑπéÆσïòπüïπüÖ" (our hope moves the future), which Ki-b┼ì's name can be referred to. Voices of Roku-chan and Moya-kun were done by anonymous children who were chosen.

The film was illustrated as manga on the February and March edition of CoroCoro Comic. Then it was released as the 25th film tank┼ìbon, which may be bought at the theater. As the 4th "Sega=Doraemon" project, an action-adventure game was also released on March 6, 2008, two days before the release of the film. The games is entitled, Doraemon Nobita to Midori no Kyojinden DS
