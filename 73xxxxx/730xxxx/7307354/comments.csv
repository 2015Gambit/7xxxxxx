,corbis02,2012-05-29T00:05Z,"This profile (hellsingspartan)shows up for me, and I can load minecraft. (It is the demo version, not the full). When I try to play the game it starts loading the map and spawn points etc, then it stops, says:

 Loading Error:

""Minecraft:Xbox 360 Edition"" has failed to load and cannot continue. 

My xbox was banned a couple years ago, I don't have it connected to the internet at all, no cable, no wifi. 

Any ideas? "

,HellsingSpartan,2012-05-29T03:30Z,Im finding a problem with the licensing its not being transfered so it looks like ill have to reverse engineer this a little to get the license to work on any xbox there is a file that tells the xbox that he owns the file.If anybody like to help this could be the key into opening tons more games and packages. My freinds xbox loaded it perfect one time then fail the second time. HMMM so what is going on is a puzzle to be figured out. I want to simplfy this process.   
,darkmaster89,2012-05-29T05:36Z,"Transfer content licenses

You can transfer content licenses from one console to another once every four months.

If your console was recently repaired, or if you’ve purchased a new console, use the license transfer option on your console to transfer content licenses. Here’s how:

    On your console, sign in to Xbox LIVE using the gamertag that you used to purchase the content.

    Go to the Settings, and then select Account.

    Go to Your Billing Options, and then select License Transfer.

    Follow the on-screen instructions to transfer the content licenses.

After the licenses are transferred, you need to download the content again to update the local licenses. This way the content can be used by other profiles on your console and when you’re not connected to Xbox LIVE.
