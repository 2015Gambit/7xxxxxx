When Chance The Rapper came up with the idea for 10 Day, he was on a week and a half long suspension from his high school in Chicago. Now, a year later, Chance has truly cooked up one of the most put together mixtapes weΓÇÖve heard in a while with features and production from Chuck Inglish, Blended Babies, Nico Segal, Caleb James, Vic Mensa, Sulaiman and more. The buzz that the SaveMoney rapper has built off this project alone is crazy, with #10Day trending in the Chi since earlier this morning. DonΓÇÖt sleep on this project, itΓÇÖs really good. WeΓÇÖre expecting great things from Chance in the future and this is really the perfect introduction to him as an artist.
