,osriccc,2012-06-04T03:32Z,"This is a TRUE Blu-ray rip. The quality is PERFECT, watched it on my 60"" Samsung LCD. The sound is 10/10 too. This is the one for seeding and downloading. Enjoy this beautiful, moving and outstanding movie by awesome Zhang Yimou featuring the always magnificent Christian Bale."
