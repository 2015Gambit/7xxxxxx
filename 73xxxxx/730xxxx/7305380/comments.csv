About quality this version is actually better than the 1.58Gb one. I've downloaded both and compared them, details are much better and more clearly visible here. Thanks."

No skips, no loopings, no censorship. Looks perfect most the time but in dark backgrounds or in close ups it shows diagonal lines, other than that, very good quality... Thanks a lot mate!!

,Garfield123321,2012-05-28T20:04Z,It would be nice to seed someone !!!
,hmathews8,2012-05-28T20:20Z,"Watched file in it's entirety, AV looks great as always. Slightly dark picture, so turn your brightness up a little.

No glitches, skips, censoring. Works on PS3 using mkv2vob.

Oh and @Hogar87, you're a god damn idiot."
