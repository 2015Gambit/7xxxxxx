FREEARC it's a very good software
I hope you will do the same with max payne 3 :)"
[V],globeplus,2012-05-26T15:01Z,"To shauwy:

In this game file you donÂ´t need the freearc , you just need to click in an executable that will do the extraction and launch the file immediatly after the extraction ... thatÂ´s all ...

Happy game and i am shore the makers of the Max Payne 3 certainly did their best to create another great game for the Max Payne series , at least we all hope that ... see you ."
