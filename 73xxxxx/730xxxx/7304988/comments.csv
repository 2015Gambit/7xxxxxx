,nursemorph,2012-05-28T20:11Z,Thankyou very much for this repack....excellent work in sorting out another version. Was wonderin why it had been stuck at 7% all day today with almost no download speeds...thought maybe my ISP was restricting my bandwidth due to the amount of downloading I do. Glad to see it's not my BB. Thankyou again mate.

I was wondering if you're having difficulties recording/encoding the 6ch audio?
I see all of your uploads downmix the original 6 tracks to 2ch stereo."
