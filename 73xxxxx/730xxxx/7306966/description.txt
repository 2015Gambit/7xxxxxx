There is already a complete series torrent of Saban's Masked Rider out there, but the quality of episodes beyond the first half of season one is subpar. These files are [b]much[/b] more watchable. 

Additionally, three episodes from season one have been extended with scenes exclusive to the early VHS releases (thanks to Spy from RangerBoard for these scenes). I personally edited these scenes into better-quality rips, hence why they are *.m2ts files. VLC Media Player or Daum PotPlayer should be able to handle them easily.

Enjoy, and remember to seed!
