,preparationh,2012-06-05T03:43Z,"great quality. thanks. the movie itself, though, is corny ass hell. stiff, short, old dude running around town kicking names and taking ass... i couldn't sit through the whole thing."
,CJClags,2012-06-08T02:21Z,"Props to YIFY as always!

This movie was entirely disappointing and moderately boring. I more enjoyed the 2 minute youtube video ""amberlamps"" rather than this drawn out derivative of it with an addition of character/plot development. 
Don't waste your time on this one."
