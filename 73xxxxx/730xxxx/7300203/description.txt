I use a Transfer Cap and upload 7 gigs a day. 
This is why I upload a new torrent every other day or so. 
I do this to keep my IP off my back as they have initiated a monthly limit.
It usually takes me two days to fully seed a torrent so please be patient.

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - Disc 2 - The Supplements - This rip is a (DVD-9)

- What I mean by (DVD-9) this ISO is a 1:1 rip and is not compressed in any way if you are burning this you will need a double layer disc.
- What I mean by (DVD-5) this ISO has been compressed to fit onto a single layer disc, the main film has been touched as little as possible and unless you are watching this on a high definition projector at over 60 inches you should not be able to notice any difference. Nothing has been taken out of the original DVD.

SYNOPSIS:  
It is 1971, and journalist Raoul Duke barrels toward Las VegasΓÇöaccompanied by a trunkful of contraband and his slightly unhinged Samoan attorney, Dr. GonzoΓÇöto cover a motorcycle race. What should be a cut-and-dried journalistic assignment quickly descends into a feverish psychedelic odyssey. Director Terry Gilliam and an all-star cast headlined by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro show no mercy in bringing Hunter S. Thompsons excoriating dissection of the American way of life to the screen, creating a film both hilarious and savage.
