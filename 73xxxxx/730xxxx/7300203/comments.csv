,Waikiki2008,2012-05-26T06:28Z,Greetings from Vegas. Greatly appreciated.
,baybeh,2012-05-26T08:37Z,"whoa! this is a treasure! Also, Auge, could you upload 'M' by Fritz Lang? Thanks."
,pasetes,2012-05-28T15:04Z,"0.8 kbs, this is the actual speed !

Please SEED "
[T],Auge,2012-05-28T20:06Z,"It will speed up; two of my other seeds are finishing in a few minutes.
I use super-seed because to many people on Pirate Bay hog up the download and then jump ship.
Just be patient, after all it is free to you . . . you donâ&#x20AC;&#x2122;t have to pay for it or spend the time ripping it, just click a button and wait."
,t944ktmv,2012-06-02T04:29Z,"Wow... this is possibly the best film torrent I have seen on TPB. Thanks very much to Auge and the seeders; I'll seed this at least until 1:1, probably for longer because it's such a great torrent. 

Keeping an eye out for your name in future!"
,baybeh,2012-06-15T18:19Z,"Amazingly cool. Thanks, Auge and the seeders. (Wish seeders would seed other torrents too as generously as this one, though.)"
