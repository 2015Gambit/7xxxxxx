Information
------------------------------

Reporter Evan Williams and director James Brabazon travel to the Central African country of Cameroon to investigate the practice of eating 'bushmeat' - wild meat hunted in the rainforest. They talk to the medical experts warning that butchering and eating primates including critically endangered gorillas and chimpanzees could trigger a new global pandemic - a new HIV or SARS - by unleashing as-yet unknown viruses. And they meet the British woman battling the trade and looking after the animals orphaned by the slaughter.
