With the support of the Independent Television Fund (ITVS) and Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the story of Winter Soldier/Iraq & Afghanistan is now an hour-long documentary airing on PBS stations nationwide. See the full list for an upcoming broadcast near you.

ΓÇ£This is Where We Take Our StandΓÇ¥ is the story of hundreds of veterans who risked everything to publicly tell their accounts of the horrors they witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In March of 2008, two hundred and fifty veterans and active-duty soldiers marked the fifth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq by gathering in Washington, DC, to testify from their own experience about the nature of the occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. It was chilling, horrifying, and challenging for all who witnessed it.

Against tremendous odds, they brought the voices of the veterans themselves into the debate. ΓÇ£This is Where We Take Our StandΓÇ¥ is the inside story of those three days and the courageous men and women who testified-a story thatΓÇÖs as important to tell today as ever.

These brave soldiers and veterans are challenging a public silence that runs very deep, underscoring a willingness to accept unspeakable horrors-as long as we donΓÇÖt know about them.
