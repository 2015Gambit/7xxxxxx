"Onward and Upward"

Harry's ex-husband is found dead with no 
one to claim the body, burdening her with 
planning the funeral which to her surprise 
stirs up more emotion than she 
anticipated. Meanwhile, with Tommy's help, 
Harry agrees to represent a man publicly 
named a person of interest in the murder 
of his ex-wife. Elsewhere, Oliver tries to 
rope Cassie into representing a student 
who is suing the Law School that denied 
her entrance because they practice 
affirmative action. Other romantic 
entanglements are tested when Adam is 
pitted against Phoebe after he takes on 
the case of a man fired for constantly 
popping his false teeth in and out of his 
mouth.
