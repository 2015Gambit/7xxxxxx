Carrie and Saul scramble to locate Walker after discovering that he's alive and working with al-Qaeda. They must also deal with competing intelligence agencies' disagreements over the best way to chase him down.
The FBI wants to enlist the public's help, but Carrie prefers a more personal approach, using the rogue sniper's love for his wife and son to draw him out of hiding.
