DVD Rip of Graham Coxon - Live at The Zodiac, includes DVD Extras - ICA Acoustic set and promotional videos of Spectacular, Freakin' Out & Bittersweet Bundle of Misery. Also thrown in Freakin' Out on later with Jools Holland as I had it on my drive.

Ripped a couple of years back, quality is OK... let me know if quality deserves an upload of complete DVDR.

all ripped by sparkyfish22 (except live on jools holland clip, credit to rosa mannen).
