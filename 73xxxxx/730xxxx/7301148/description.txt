After 30 some years, the unreleased recordings of Diamondhead & Brother Son (previous name) have been released!! This release contains music by some of Denver's best and most well known musicians, including Bob Yeazel from Beast and Sugarloaf, and other members of Sugarloaf, and other well known musicians from the area at the time. The material is first rate, and Bob really shines on the CD as lead singer/ guitarist. The topics cover musician life "No Name Singer", chasing the ladies "Strange Lady", partying in the 70s "Let's Have Some Fun", lost love "The One That Got Away", and hanging in there in the game of life "My Ship Is Coming", this is just a few examples, and there's not one clunker here to be found. Bob and crew are some of the best, yet grossly under-rated musicians from that time, and it's nice to see this music finally getting some attention. If you are a fan of Bob Yeazel, Sugarloaf, Colorado Rock, then, this is an absolute must. Fans of great vintage rock music will love it also. I am proud to have it in my collection.
