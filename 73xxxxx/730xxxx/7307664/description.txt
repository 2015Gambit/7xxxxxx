Before Jimmy Tamborello started collaborating on music through the mail with Ben Gibbard for what would become the early-2000s crossover success called The Postal Service, he was already hard at work on his own as Dntel. The dreamy textures and glitchy beats of his 2001 masterstroke Life Is Full of Possibilities paved the way for the indie-tronica of the Postal Service as well as droves of other laptop-wielding indie kids who followed suit.
