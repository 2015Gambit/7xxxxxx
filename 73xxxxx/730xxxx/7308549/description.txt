Shawn (Deidre Holland) is a detective novelist seeking psychological counselling for her uncontrollable sexual compulsions and is willing to try anything to cure them. Her therapist, Dr. Fisher (Randy Spears) tries to convince her that her problems come from her longing to be with a soul mate and lover from a past life, and that a revolutionary new hypnotic past life regression treatment might provide some further insight.
Not buying her therapist's theory, Shawn continues on with a party to celebrate the completion of her new book. There she hooks up with Jack, a delivery boy who unbeknownst to Shawn, is also a patient under her doctor's care... as well as under his thumb. Shawn has to use her own detective skills to not only find the cure for her compulsions, but also find her way out of a scam.
