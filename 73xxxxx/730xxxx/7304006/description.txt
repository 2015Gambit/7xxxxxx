
Another awesome music documentary from the archive - as a thank you to all music loving and sharing peers over the globe. 

Rockfieber, the German version from the famous Stamping Ground bootleg, perfectly captures the scene at the Holland Popfestival.

The staggering line-up for this reprise of Woodstock included Pink Floyd, Santana, Jefferson Airplane, Canned Heat, Dr. John, Soft Machine, Fairport Convention and many others.
