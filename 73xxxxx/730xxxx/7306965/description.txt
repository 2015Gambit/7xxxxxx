Untamed Australia Season 1
Untamed Australia is an unusual and colourful wildlife documentary series that provides a unique account of the bizarre animals living in the wetlands, islands, deserts, and Outback of Australia, the 'Island Continent'. The series was filmed over a number of years by some of the best wildlife filmmakers, mainly on location in the Australian Outback and nature reserves in different parts of the country. 
By using the best camera techniques available, including static, hidden cameras, underwater cameras and special night equipment, Untamed Australia has managed to capture the beautiful and unusual creatures and seasons of the vast Australian wilderness in amazing quality and unparalleled clarity. It looks at the many different animals that live in the range of habitats that make up this vast continent. The islands, deserts and Outback each have their own weather systems and micro climates and support a vast variety of wildlife throughout the year. 
From Arnhem Land to Kangaroo Island, and from Mount Artula to the billabongs and rivers of the north, the varied scenery of Australia is breathtaking, harsh, lush and cruel. The filmmakers have focused on a small number of key species, by following them through their life cycles and key events. Many other animals make a brief appearance and some are shown in amazing detail.
