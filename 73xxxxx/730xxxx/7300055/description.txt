Directed by Brazilian (from northeast state Ceará) filmmaker Rosenberg Cariry, the film intends to follow the journey of a teacher who, after a period teaching in France, decides to return to the northeastern Brazil backlands in order to rediscover dirty origins, with the help of a mysterious indian woman. On his journey full of delusions, the protagonist crosses with "reisados" and "bandas de pífanos", groups of popular dramatic amusements that roam the backcountry. The conflict between these gropus leads us to the tragedy of the founder of Ceará, when Bishop Pero Coelho in 1603 in search of El Dorado, finds war, pestilence, famine and madness. Much like the protagonist of the film.
