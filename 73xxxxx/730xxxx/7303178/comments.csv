,kurro46,2012-05-27T09:59Z,How to get the password? the link for the password in the torrent is covered by some adds and cant get throught it.. Any help?
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-05-27T11:27Z,"@kurro46: You have to eat dog shit to unlock the password mate. Fresh, to be precise."
[V],spastik64,2012-05-27T13:57Z,"The file is in .RAR ?

Fucking NOOBS, your accounts would be deleted by fucking assholes.

Press on the FILES of the torrent, and see what's inside :

UFC.146.Dos.Santos.v.Mir.26th.May.2012.HDTV.x264-Sir.Pau[PublicHD.eu]l.AVI


Stop trolling idiots, this torrent is legit 100% as ALL vip torrents. Thats why we are vip's."
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-05-27T16:52Z,They really need to get a life.
,stealthpancho,2012-05-27T18:49Z,A fucken password protected file?! Really? WTF!?!
,titoto,2012-05-27T20:11Z,"This one DO NOT have fucking .rar . Clean download, thanks a lot for sharing!"
,8_SiN_8,2012-05-27T20:28Z,I'm sure it's great quality like all your other uploads but this speed of download is an abomination. At this rate I'll get to watch this one by the time UFC 147 is here!
,aceoface,2012-05-27T21:16Z,"The RaR file is password protected. But there is no password...

The file asks you to go the scam site to ""get"" the password. But don't be fooled its a scam.

AGAIN: PASSWORD PROTECTED RAR w/t no password provided "
,aceoface,2012-05-27T21:17Z,@DibyaTPB how you ever became VIP and pull this shit is beyond me
[V],DibyaTPB,2012-05-28T02:45Z,@aceoface: Lick my ass.
,arsebandit100,2012-05-28T08:03Z,"Don't dl this guys torrents. I've never seen such shitty torents and he's a total fucking cunt as well, look at his posts.

How the fuck did you get VIP, Sir.Cunty? I'll be looking out for you from  now on."
,scotste,2012-05-28T15:56Z,"I don't get what these people are going on about the .RAR file since it isn't one, well it wasn't for me so you are all talking bullshit.

On the seeding front I downloaded 2 different versions of this UFC event and I have had problems downloading both speed wise and now it upload speed from me sucks too, I normally upload around 80kb/s but with both UFC files I am barely going about 10kb/s but it keeps jumping back to nothing.

Something weird is going on."
,arsebandit100,2012-05-29T10:27Z,"Scotste - It isn't bullshit because I got two things from this guy.

One was the worst video I've ever got, with huge chunks of the video missing (whole rounds), and the other was a .RAR file that required a password.

This is no bullshit. I have nothing to gain by lying as no matter what anybody says, people will still dl it. I'm just letting people know that some weird shit is going on, take it or leave it."
,rfgattu,2012-05-30T07:57Z,corrupted file...=/ . shitty.
,rfgattu,2012-05-30T07:59Z,.RAR files are not worth at all. i`d prefer download extra 100 mb than have this shit corrupted...
