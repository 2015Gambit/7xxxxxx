,mafiadog,2012-05-27T14:38Z,"Very nice,but again far too large files for me to download."
,shallow2,2012-05-27T15:05Z,"@mafiadog: On Utorrent, and I believe most torrent clients, there is the option to select which files not to download.
It is abit more difficult with magnet links, but it works none the less. This is for Utorrent, if you are using another client, pls post which one , and other useres who use the same one can telll you how it is done there if different.

After utorrent has resolved the filelist from the magnet link, click on the files tab on the bottom and you get a list of all the files in torrent. Then just right click on the MP4 and select 'do not download'. Then just open dl folder and delete the partial mp4 file if it has already started a few mb's.

Hope this helps.

It saves alot of time, and seeds alot faster/better when we include everything in one torrent.

Enjoy the Kink man! :)"
