,ksirob,2012-06-02T15:28Z,"i tried that once but it never sounded good 
...where to cut it, at the end of the first track, beggining of second, somewhere in between,...
should i cut away the interviews and announcements...

keep in mind that this is a radio show, you can never get original track from this, if you like certain songs you will need to find them somewhere else or better still buy them and support the artists
