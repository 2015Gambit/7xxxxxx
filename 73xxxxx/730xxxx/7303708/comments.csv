I apologize for this.  I noticed the error in the title just as I was hitting the upload button.  I tried to cancel, but I couldn't in time.  Unfortunately, there is no way to edit or even delete torrents on thepiratebay.  So please take note that this doesn't have 5.1 audio.  For some reason, this was the one Doctor Who DVD that didn't have 5.1."
