Read NFO Notes
 ok the reason for the readnfo is this does go out slighly oos in couple places but not for long..
 TBH we dont normally do anything that needs syncing but thought we would give this ago.
 We got all the lines that needed subs apart from a couple of lines. 
Audio was muxed with the russian 5.1 but ws only 2 channel so we dropped it down to 384Kbps.
 
Have included our SRT file if any other groups want to us it and correct any of the slight oos spots
