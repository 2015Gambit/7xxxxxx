,yungbuk45,2012-05-26T08:36Z,is this in english
,awesome123ad,2012-05-26T09:20Z,"blurry as hell, not english and looks and sounds like it was recorded under water"
,funkAdub3,2012-05-26T09:27Z,Does this version have the ending?  The others do not...it cuts off a few minutes before the end.  Thanks for the up...  Will definitely be seeing this in theaters
,funkAdub3,2012-05-26T10:29Z,"After d/ling and checking it out, i agree fully with awesome... this movie is dubbed in hindi, has a weird look to it, and the audio is not good at all.  BUT, it does have the ending to the movie, unlike the others."
[V],loverulz,2012-05-26T12:35Z, always complaining........ enjoy the free stuff guys......
,luke444,2012-05-26T14:03Z,"Thats why its called a camrip you wankers, all early camrips will be bad, suck it up or feel free to go pay for it at the cinema,. Winging little gronks"
,sc4nut,2012-05-27T11:22Z,So grab this and the other rip then splice the two on the video for the missing parts in the chinese copy. I for one will grab this just to see the last ten or so minutes. Is it just me or are cam rips getting worse?
