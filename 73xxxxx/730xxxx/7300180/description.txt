From PAD's web site:

"A year ago, while recording Birth Of A Robot, a baby-song
was spontaneously born from the clash between harsh voices
and uncontrolled synths. It's a version of the medieval
lullaby John Riley. From the secret trunk in our attic to
your Xmas tree, a present to unwrap between 00:01am Dec
24th and 23:59pm Dec 25th. Merry Xmas!"
