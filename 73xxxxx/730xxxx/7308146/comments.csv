Hosted by Bill Oddie, Kate Humble and Simon King, Springwatch is a nature documentary which focuses on recording and documenting animal life in the United Kingdom. Each episode uses a combination of hidden cameras and typical recordings to present animals in their natural habitat, all the while explaining more information about the animal, as well as its behavior. Chris Packham became one of the show's presenters in 2009 replacing Bill Oddie.
