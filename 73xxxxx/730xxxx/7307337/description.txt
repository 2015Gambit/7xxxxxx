Soon after the New Zealand band Two Lane Blacktop (named after the Monte Hellman movie) broke up in 2003, guitarist/vocalist Pip Brown moved to Sydney, Australia. She worked with several bands in the area, including Teenager and Pnau, before launching her own act in 2006. Adopting the name Ladyhawke (named after the Richard Donner movie), she handled instrumental duties herself and fashioned a fresh electronic sound.
