,andrew_vinushka,2012-05-27T06:56Z,"that's the storyline for ""In Time"" movie...

here's the right one :
Knowing
A teacher opens a time capsule that has been dug up at his son's elementary school; in it are some chilling predictions -- some that have already occurred and others that are about to -- that lead him to believe his family plays a role in the events that are about to unfold

cheers mate  :)"
,DarkWeetus,2012-05-29T13:22Z,HEY YIFY. The movie description is wrong ha ha thats the description for IN TIME starting Justin Timberlake.  Knowing is about when a time capsule is opened and a list of numbers correlate every major disaster in history is found. There is an end of days prediction yada yada
