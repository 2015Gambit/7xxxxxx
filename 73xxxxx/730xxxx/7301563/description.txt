Audrey Rose is one of the stronger featherweight wrestlers. With a win against Serena Blair she has proven that her training is paying off.
 
 

Iona Grace is a crowd pleaser with her big natural tits and round ass. But she's more than just fun to look at, she's tough and determined to win. 

 

With two ferocious wrestlers in the same weight class it could be anybody's match. We can't predict the outcome. But we do know one thing with certainty, only one girl can win, which means someone will end up getting their brains fucked out on the mat and leave sore and humiliated.
