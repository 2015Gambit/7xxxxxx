,DoubleR46,2012-05-27T12:33Z,I have to say that your encodings are the best that I have ever seen.  I know that it takes lots of time but I appreciate it.  Keep it up! Do you take requests from time to time?

PS: If you like this torrent, don't forget to click on the +1, this applies to any other torrent, it's a way to say thanks to the uploader for his effort."
,BeSomeone,2012-05-27T17:56Z,"thanks, good quality"
[T],tr108,2012-05-27T23:36Z,"you're welcome everyone.

@DoubleR46 - you're can make requests. Understand that my time is very limited for the next few weeks and everything about these process -- from the downloading, ripping, encoding, and packaging -- takes way too much time. But who knows, I might get to a title here 'n there. :)"

,dilligaf247,2012-05-29T15:49Z,"Your movie uploads are great, if you have the Transformers trilogy can you please upload them!!!"
,RVPasap,2012-06-01T02:59Z,"Im with @dilligaf247.  The Transformers trilogy would be sweet!!!  Thanks for all the time you take to do these, is there any way to repay you?"
[T],tr108,2012-06-01T03:56Z,"@dilligaf247 @RVPasap - I'm not the biggest fan of the Transformers trilogy but I'll try to get to it in August (too many catalog titles to get to before then)

And, as Po from Kung Fu Panda would say, ""There is no charge for awesomeness."" :)

Like any other uploader, I only ask that you seed when you can. Thanks to those of you who do. :)"
