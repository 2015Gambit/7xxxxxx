just so that the seeds will combine (rather than 2-10 seeds per issue, it should already be 100+ for the single combined torrent)
but now it can be a T1-18 torrent already rite? but such a hassle to repost a new one and abandon the single issue torrent rite?
life is about experiences..we learn, adapt and become better..sigh"
