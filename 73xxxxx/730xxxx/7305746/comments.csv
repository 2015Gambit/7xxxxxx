It's kind of hard to find a proxy that does allow you to login, but is not yet banned due to spammers using it :/

But it's update time!

Wake 12 (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5839887/Wake_1-11___Navis_1-5) is with a proofreader now, so that'll be the next release.
After that I promised someone two months ago I would translate another Soda so that takes priority I'm afraid :P

Added complication: I injured my wrist translating, so I have to be careful not to overdo it.

So I can't make any promises :(

I like both Bernard Prince and Storm however, so chances are that they will be translated eventually :D

For next requests, just post here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51

That's easier to check for me :P"
