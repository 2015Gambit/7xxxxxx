I actually have a brand new copy of this game.

It's a lot of fun."
,Insomneac,2012-05-26T04:56Z,"BTW, this game is now available free."
,riwcio,2012-05-26T13:45Z,really? and where would that be? ;)
,genjutsu01,2012-05-26T14:39Z,"@Insomneac, I have hunted high and low for this game all over the internet, I did not see it as a free download anywhere hence why I wished to post it here, all I found was a single buggy torrent and people on forums and youtube videos complaining that is was impossible to get ahold of."
,BakaBaka11,2012-05-26T16:53Z,"You should search for ""abandonware"". Most of old (and usually good, like this) games can be downloaded from ""these"" sites."
,Insomneac,2012-05-28T02:15Z,"It's available at a few sites.

Here's one: http://games.brothersoft.com/enemy-infestation.html"
