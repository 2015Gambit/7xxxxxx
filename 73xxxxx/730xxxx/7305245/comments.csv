,Neraforesta,2012-05-28T04:01Z,"No subs, but perfect quality visually."
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-28T04:54Z,"Your bloody kidding me about ""not in English"" aren't you?

If thats true
@ TvTeam - Why don't you put that info in the comments when you post the torrent?"
,theadvocate,2012-05-28T05:25Z,fuck it...its not in eng....wtf.....??...should have mentioned
[H],NZPirate,2012-05-28T06:51Z,"Your lack of info when u post your torrents is apalling, and IMO you don't deserve that green skull. I'm never going near one of your torrents again.."
,Alphasee,2012-05-28T08:04Z,How do we report dupe torrents on TPB? This is an exact replica of http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7305244/The.Raid.Redemption.2011.HDRip_XviD-playXD just underseeded and with a shitty description
,noel_lee,2012-05-28T10:01Z,"no wonder,tvteam is the laziest uploader of all known uploaders."

,int7777,2012-05-29T04:51Z,"Give me a break TvTeam doesn't have to upload anything at all and is nice enough to do so. Do a little research yourselves it's not very hard. Go to IMDB and find the movie and look under language and it will tell you what language the movie is in along with rating, summary, and reviews. Does everyone seriously need to be spoon fed everything? Thanks for the uploads TvTeam."
