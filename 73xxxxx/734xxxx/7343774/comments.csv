Maybe you should change the resolution in the description from 1920x1080 to 1920x800 or whatever it is."
,redit0,2012-06-28T02:38Z,"@Schappe the video is 1080p.  The movie was shot in cinematic widescreen (1.85:1 or 2.39:1).  The difference is made up as the black bars you see across the top and bottom of the screen.  These bars are part of the video, so the 1080p resolution is correct."
,Schappe,2012-06-28T17:07Z,"@redit0 Many people remove these black bars for a smaller file-size, maybe not this guy.."

1: Does not work on two out of three mediaplayers/ blu-ray players.

2: Picture format is not changeble to fit a normal 16:9 screen flat-tv.
