Lightning

A storm struck on the night Laura Shane was born, and there was a 

strangeness about the weather that people would remember for years. 

But even more mysterious was the blond-haired stranger who 

appeared out of nowhere - the man who saved Laura from a fatal 

delivery.

Years later - after another bolt of lightning - the stranger returned, again 

to save Laura from tragedy. Was he the guardian angel he seemed? 

The devil in disguise? Or the master of a haunting destiny beyond time 

and space?
