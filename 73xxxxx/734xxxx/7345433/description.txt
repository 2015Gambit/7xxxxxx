SEASON 6 of the pioneering series THE UNIVERSE takes viewers further than ever, to the extreme edges of our solar system where chaos and catastrophe bring epic drama to the planets - including some of the most horrifying days on Earth. Through stunning CGI, witness the birth pangs of the solar system, shocked into existence by a nearby supernova, and enduring over 700 million years of brutal bombardment by deadly asteroids; colossal cataclysms that shaped the planets and transformed their climates forever; and startling new scientific discoveries revealing a hellish history of continuous devastation on Earth. 



12)  Microscopic Universe 
"Shrinking down billions of times, into the realm of atoms and sub-atomic particles, takes us into a strange unexplored world."
From outer space we travel to inner space for an intriguing look at the very small. Most of this episode deals with quantum physics and the potential applications in computer science. Image a particle that can be many places at the same time and communicate changes instantly across vast distances, even to the other side of the Universe. That's what we're exploring in this episode.
