It is totally politically incorrect and is done so intentionally and comedically so don't get offended, just have a good laugh and enjoy some of the earliest of what was soon to develop into the thrash metal scene as the crossover movement from punk was also in full swing.

There are a couple other magnets of S.O.D. out there and I checked em out... one had no seeds and the other was very distorted and missing the first track from Speak English or Die (March of the S.O.D.)  So I ripped my platinum edition of S.E.O.D. at 320 and since my Bigger than the Devil CD  is MIA I grabbed a 320 of it elsewhere.  I hope you enjoy and please seed as I will not be sole seeding for more than a few days so help me out folks.
