A - 10
V - 10
M - 8

Movie was as good as the first one I thought, plenty of action and is basically just an extension of the first movie - great family film really.

Thanks extremezone and as always thanks to the piratebay"
,pink50,2012-06-27T03:58Z,this movie is insulting and disgraced the mythical creek gods..i could not even finish watching this crap with terrible acting and sorry ass actors..it made me sick to a point of almost vomiting..percius.was a strong and powerfull half man and half creek god without fear..not a weakly scared freaked out dip shit with hair growing on the back of his neck..the day of great epics are over and i hope people dont confuse creek mythology with this total garbage of a movie

,Vampnik,2012-07-01T11:58Z,"Whoever has been writing V=9 or 10 should get their eyes checked!
V=7 at best, pretty poor quality for a DVDrip
A=8
A shame extremezone - usually much better quality than this .."

,wendydepp,2012-07-07T03:25Z,"As always, great quality...so think you might get an upload of Magic Mike???  Can I ask a question?  There have been 4 different torrents of Magic Mike, and they have been fakes that errors and carry a virus...I have never experienced that before on here...why that movie?  

Anyway...awesome torrent as always...people, if ya don't like the movie, don't blame it on the uploader and give bad reviews...duh!"
,scabbyphil,2012-07-13T05:52Z,Thanks man! Nothing but the best as always.
