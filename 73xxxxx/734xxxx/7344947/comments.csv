,ZombieLionelHutz,2012-06-11T20:28Z,"This torrent is shit, downloads at 1.9kb a sec on my 25Mbit connection.

Not blaming the uploader, but something is seriously fucked up with it. Probably some bullshit from AMC as mentioned. DUHH I can't download this one show better start paying $85 a month for Cable duhhh I'm a fucking moron...

Grabbed it from Demonoid, worked fine there. "
