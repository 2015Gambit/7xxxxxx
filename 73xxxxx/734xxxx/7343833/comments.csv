,pakpakpakmak,2012-08-21T19:28Z,Seed please! :(
,Matrixman_217,2012-08-21T19:30Z,I'll seed for a few weeks 
,pakpakpakmak,2012-08-21T20:12Z,Thanks a lot! :) I'll also seed once it's downloaded.
,Matrixman_217,2012-08-22T03:06Z,"I won't lie, this torrent has been on and off all day, but after about 12 hours, it's at 85%.

You might wanna leave it for a day or two just DLing, or wait until there's more seeders if you want.

I still don't see how 2.5 hours of video could be 1080p and only 2.6GB

I guess i'll wait and find out."

I am aware that my seeding situation is less than optimal, since I only have 50kB/s of upstream, and I can't seed 24 hours a day (usually about 16), so I'm relying on you guys to help me out.
Please keep the torrent in queue for as long as possible, also I'd be very happy if someone could put it on his seedbox.

I'm currently thinking about adding the other 3 tutorial blocks from massivesynth, would there be interest for that?"
