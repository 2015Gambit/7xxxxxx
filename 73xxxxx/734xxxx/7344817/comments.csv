This is a 3 gig file,  who the FUCK wants to wait around for the next 2 days waiting for little piss-ant wannabe's to FUCKING SEED ALREADY!!!"
,stefanm3,2012-06-11T16:00Z,seeeeedddd only  1 hour pleeaseee
,clawedthecat,2012-06-11T16:01Z,"at the time of writing this there were 12 seeders at 100% - of which only two were actively uploading, very disappointing.

I live in Perth, the race is on at 0200 so not very convenient to watch and be mentally competant at work the next day"
,clawedthecat,2012-06-11T16:04Z,"sorry forgot to add my thanks to footy for uploading this, I have been able to watch the pre-race show, GREAT QUALITY, will definitely look for your USF1GP file when it is up"
,rc90029,2012-06-11T18:23Z,"@BlaTaN

Open your Ports or get a better ISP?"
,SerSpec-V,2012-06-11T20:18Z,Thanks very much Footy! Although it would be a little better if the bitrate was 1800-2000.
,griedarw,2012-06-11T23:34Z,"Thanks Footy...


@ everyone else - WTF!!!  Seeeeeed you leeches!  You can't even seed for 24 hours???? Pathetic"

,HugoBossUnzipped,2012-06-23T22:49Z,"Thanks again for these. Love F1, but never seem to be able to find it on TV. This is better actually, can watch on TV and I get to pause it when phone rings. Thanks again."
