Thank you!  This is such a RARE out-of-print recording.  I can't express enough appreciation!  And the separate cross-stage sync problem for Hall and Philipp makes it all that more 'real'.
I read there is also a live recording, 1972 I think, at the Hollywood Bowl.  Anybody know if this is true/where it can be found?  What a totally unique sensation they were in the late 60s."
