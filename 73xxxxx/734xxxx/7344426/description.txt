This is a complete collection of all Lone Wolf the RPG d20 books (all five of them published by Mongoose Publishing and authored by August Hahn). As an added bonus there are several magazines which include information for this edition, a map of Magnumund (the primary continent), and a few other useful pieces of literature. I hope everyone enjoys, please seed and leave comments.
