Contains most of the books from the Flames of War - The World War II Miniatures Game from Battlefront.

More books will be added in the future as I scan new ones or otherwise get my hands on digital copies. If you have some books I don't, make a torrent you too.

Most scans have not been made by me so quality may vary. Incomplete books will be completed if able.

Please visit [url]http://www.flamesofwar.com[/url] and of course buy the books if you enjoy playing the game.
