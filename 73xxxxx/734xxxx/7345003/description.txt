This psychedelic folk classic was recorded in 1973, and has gone on to become one of the rarest records ever issued in Ireland. It's hardly surprising, as it's a wonderful progressive folk concept album, with mystical atmosphere and mellow vocals. A glorious mixture of catchy melodies, soaring harmonies and biting acid guitar.
