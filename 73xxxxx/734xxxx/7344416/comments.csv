,pers0n,2012-06-11T00:56Z,Do the servers have to be cracked to play on them?
,GunbikeZ,2012-06-11T06:56Z,"Awesome torrent, thanks for the UL. "
,n3wr3g,2012-06-13T01:09Z,great torrent and very simple instructions. everyone should know about this!
,k1llerteddybear,2012-06-13T02:39Z,"Fantastic torrent, thank you! "
,k1llerteddybear,2012-06-13T03:07Z,"TeamExtreme server selection resulted in a blockface consuming everything I see. After moving forward, I saw its a library. Doesn't mean I can freely roam though. Nope. All movement results into a return of position and that damn blockface EVERYWHERE. All sorts of ridiculous profanity on the chat, it wont let me chat, etc. Terrible server. Single player works fine but christ the multiplayer is a MESS. "
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-06-13T10:25Z,"@k1llerteddybear You have to be one of the dumbest idiots I've seen.

IF you bothered to read the ReadMe (all of it) you would see there is a section for multilayer and you have to type a register command before you can move...

,sloanst,2012-06-13T20:56Z,"fuck

,FlakMonkey,2012-06-14T18:50Z,All that hating! Just find another damned server.
,tgkw93,2012-06-14T18:54Z,Great Torrent. I love it. The Staff work hard to keep the server going great. Keep up the good work. I may play on other server but i will always come back to TeamExtreme. 
,PraiseToTheCrackers,2012-06-15T18:55Z,"@sloanst had the same problem, it lies in the name of the folder, you need to copy the folder to appdata, launch the minecraft launcher. Then copy everything from that folder into the .minecraft folder which will be empty in appdata"
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-06-16T11:27Z,"PraiseToTheCrackers, yeah you need to follow the instructions to the letter. 

Glad you got yours working :P"

,AddiGame,2012-06-16T16:24Z,"@DopeyNest Your C:Users(User)AppDataRoaming folder is hidden. You either need to search in the Windows search box ""%appdata%"" and click on the Roaming folder or replace (User) with your user folder and paste C:Users(User)AppDataRoaming into Windows Explorer."

,tULtim8cin,2012-06-18T21:52Z,"Scrypt01

I'm an old school CSS player (CounterStrike Source). I know all too well what you are talking about. The same kind of shit you're talking about is the very reason why I don't play ANY online multiplayer games anymore. The abuse with these admin (many but not all) is downright absurd. Some fucking looser gets a server or some dickhead becomes an admin and all of the sudden they want to play GOD and wipe their ass on people… “because they can” AND… don't even get me started with the juvenile and socially inept cocksuckers that join these servers! Yep my days of multiplayer are long gone!! 

Btw nice torrent. "

,DerpBenis,2012-06-26T07:27Z,"hey neofusion!
it seems like a great torrent, but i cant get it to work. I followed the instructions on this closely, but whenever i opened the 1/2gb installer, it said that java is not recognizable as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. I also tried to open the Minecraft Launcher jar file, but it wouldnt open. What do you use to open a jar file? I tried extracting it, but inside the folder, it was all just data stuff. How can i get it to work? Thanks http://forums.teamextrememc.com/index.php/topic/458-welcome-to-teamextreme/"
,TeamExtremeMc,2012-06-26T15:21Z,@DerpBenis Please download and install java.
,DerpBenis,2012-06-27T02:17Z,"@neofusion
I tried installing java, but i still have the same problem with the 1gb/2gb launchers. Do you mean java like the one from the link below?
http://java.com/en/download/chrome.jsp?locale=en
Also, how do you get the MinecraftLauncher jar file to open and launch? Thanks a lot, I appreciate it!"
