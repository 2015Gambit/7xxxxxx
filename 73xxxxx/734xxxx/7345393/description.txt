Indentured introduces you to the crew of the USS Pioneer ΓÇô the worldΓÇÖs first superluminal spacecraft. It eventually leaves you with a question as to what happened to the majority of the crew of that ship when it became stranded in the Beta Hydri system.

Legacy brings you the tale of those descendants of the original Pioneer colony in the Beta Hydri System, introducing for the first time, the Mystics. When Legacy is invaded by a fleet of spacecraft, the primitive colony, nine-hundred years in the making, reacts in the only way it knows how. When it comes to the Mystics, this reaction could be quite deadly.

Violation finishes up the overall ΓÇ£introductionΓÇ¥ to the true Mystic Saga, bringing you the tale of about a dozen USSC assassins sent to a 1940ΓÇÖs Earth.
