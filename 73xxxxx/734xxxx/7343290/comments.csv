,Agent_QiQi,2012-06-10T12:48Z,"thanks mates, appreciate all your effort!"
,Matak12,2012-06-10T12:51Z,"thanks Scene you are the man! I still dont know who won the fight haha Im dodging the news and websites, until torrent finishes and i can watch!"
,cryxalis,2012-06-10T18:10Z,"cant believe this fight... very disappointing , all this is just a way to make more money from the rematch... "
[T],Gondy10,2012-06-10T18:50Z,All you fuckers must not discuss here the result of the fight.. You must respect other people who wants to watch this without knowing the results of the fight.. Fuck off assholess..
,Xanthium111111,2012-06-10T20:52Z,"I know, that douchebag gringo sanchez posted that same spoiler comment on every fucking torrent for this fight! I'd say ban that motherfucker, but he'll just come back again in some other slimy form. Ban him anyway, maybe he just doesn't understand what a fuckin idiot he's being (some people are that stupid)... I say it was purposefully done though.

Bottom line is, and this is what I've been doing for a long time now... never, ever read the comments no matter what until after the fight. "
,Neraforesta,2012-06-10T21:01Z,"In just my opinion... I believe one of you smart as hell computer savvy mofos do something about it when someone like him pops up. I've seen others post these offenders IP on the comment sections before in retaliation...don't ask me how, cause I'm no IT wizz. But what joy would it be if some smart pplz take on the task of hunting these asshats down by their IP and then post their info here. Possible physical addresses, phone numbers, names etc... I know it can be done, I just wish someone would do it. From that point, I may not be smart, but I will do my part in what I can to whipe them off the planet."

,ChaKing1,2012-06-10T23:26Z,A petition to change the outcome of a fight? Are you fucking serious. Now people want to start petitions against the decisions of a sporting event. FUCK OFF RETARDS. POST THAT BS SOMEWHERE ELSE ASSHOLE.
,KKKDownlow,2012-06-11T01:32Z,I thought that the decision was the best thing in the world. No boxer deserves to have that few losses on their record and the judges knew that as well so they fixed the fight. Awesome decision and a great example of how corrupt the sport of boxing can be. Only the stupidest people on earth would bet on an event that can be fixed so easy on judges decisions.
,exicee,2012-06-11T02:01Z,complete bull crap!
,heliuz_666,2012-06-12T01:50Z,i am a filipino blood...i havent watched the fight im dodging everything about this fight...thanks for uploading...by any chance is there something in HD??1080p would be perfect...
,vampzcore,2012-06-12T01:52Z,thanks uploader and seeders!! :)
,f20cs13,2012-06-12T02:55Z,I find nothing more enjoyable then this (false) Iconic jesus freak from a third world country finally losing. Fuck Pacquiao and his religious intolerance and his country. The only people who care about the Pacquiao are his third world deciples.
,lightisi,2012-06-12T04:26Z,and your one among them right? slimmy rat!
,ic1984now,2012-06-12T07:05Z,the pacman finally meet his match?
,jjyt,2012-06-12T08:08Z,f20cs13 ---- FUCK YOU!
,dvdriprocketmail,2012-06-13T08:06Z,"Does anyone have the Pacquiao vs. Bradley fight with Mario Lopez and some other guy commentating?  That's the one I watched live through Destiny Cable Box here in the Philippines and they called the fight closer to the judges score cards, so I'd like to rewatch that version.  It looked like Bradley won the fight to me and I'm a Pacquiao fan.  After watching the HBO commentators I can see why everyone's complaining that Pacquiao got robbed, but when I watched live I thought Bradley probably won."
,j_pedro,2012-06-19T06:05Z,Manny Pacquiao has to learn how to fight. If he wasn't such a weak cunt he would of won the fight. Oh well
,Seefer,2012-08-08T08:04Z,"At least he can fight better than that shit stick Maquez, "" Pedro "". What a bitch. Got robbed? Your band is filled with racist twats. If anything, it shows that him and his fans lack class, just like your mom did when I opened her vagina to the train station. "
,Seefer,2012-08-08T08:10Z,"PS:

On November 15, Mรกrquez announced that he wants to fight Pacquiao again for the fourth time but this time he wants it in his home country, Mexico.[49] Because of severe disappoinment from their last fight's decision, he also added some conditions if ever they will fight. He wants their last fight to be declared a no-contest, Pacquiao must accept that he lost and he must receive a $10 million guaranteed purse.

What a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch. I've lost all respect for Mexican boxers. "
