Since her exciting win against Charisma Capelli, Beretta James has taken two tough losses. She's ready to redeem herself and advance into Summer Vengeance. 

Lyla Storm follows in the grand tradition of Yellow Kitty, Annie Cruz and Harmony, a super-sexy wrestler who can't buy a win no matter what. But she always puts up a fight and today is looking to crush her smaller opponent.
