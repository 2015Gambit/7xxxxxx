[b]Description:[/b]

The time of Diplomacy is over. The length of the war and differing opinions on what should be done to bring the war to an end has led to a splintering of the groups involved. The controlling powers-that-be have depleted arsenals and seemed to have exhausted all efforts of diplomacy. Trapped in a stalemate, sub-factions have rebelled and broken off the main alignments. Rebellion is upon us.

Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion further expands on the Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion legacy with six massive Titans, three new capital ships, new corvette-class ships, and many other gameplay enhancements as well as graphic engine, AI and multiplayer upgrades. A stand-alone release that also contains all of the previous Solar Empire content, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion serves as both a sequel and a reinvention of the acclaimed 4X space strategy game.
