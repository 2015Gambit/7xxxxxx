GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series race #4 - Millville New Jersey - 13-May-2012

This is the 4th race of the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, held at Thunderbolt
Raceway New Jersey Motorsports Park in Millville New Jersey. The GLOBAL BARTER 250
is a 2 hour 45 minute timed event run over a 2.25 mile road course of 12 turns. Ten
Daytona Prototype teams and 16 GT class contenders are scheduled to compete.

This download is a .ISO file intended to be written directly to a blank 4.4GB DVD.
Then you can play it on your living room Blu-Ray console connected to your big screen
HDTV. You can also play it on your computer DVD drive with appropriate software. The
video is encoded in a hybrid format called BD5 that is compatible with all Blu-Ray
console players but not likely any DVD consoles.

If you wish to play the download on your computer you can use a virtual DVD emulator
utility, like the free DAEMONTools Lite, to "mount" the .ISO file as a temporary
DVD drive. Then you can play the video directly using any Blu-Ray compatible media
player. I often use CyberLink PowerDVD to watch, and I have also used others such
as the freely available DAPlayer. If you have the correct AVCHD CODECs installed
then even Windows Media Player can be used.


Video: 720p AVCHD H.264 4000Kbps at 59.94Fps

Enjoy!
