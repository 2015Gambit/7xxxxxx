 Album Info..: 
 
 Trail of Tears is the most personal and most accomplished album Billy Ray Cyrus has recorded to date. Cyrus' elaborates his pop-oriented country with some rootsy 
 production flourishes -- the album sounds edgier and grittier than any of his 
 previous records. Furthermore, Cyrus delivers both his originals and the covers with conviction, far more conviction than could have been believed possible from his first two albums. In fact, Trail of Tears suggests that he may be able to carve out a  successful career for himself, after all. -- Thom Owens
