This is the fifth part of the capes and claws series, a swashbuckling series of Ayroles and Masbou, who also wrote Garulfo. It was written in the style of an Italian comedy, which means that the most important plot points were thought of before, but the rest was improvisation.

PS: I only upload packs of complete series. If you see me uploading single issues, this means that regretfully, I don't have the series yet complete.

PPS: If you want to request a comic, please make a post here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51
and add as title something like [scanlation] title_of_comic.
It makes it easier for me to keep track of requests :P

Note:

If you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).
Then, you can use ".cbr files and open them with ComicRack.
It's easy to use, and has a great quality!

Hope you enjoy!
