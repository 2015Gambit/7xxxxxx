Has the game been patched to the latest version, and would you please be able to find a way that we can crack the game to let us play all races in multiplayer?"
,WinterGale,2012-06-20T00:56Z,hmmmm...I'll see what I can do
,Supremor,2012-06-20T07:10Z,"Thank you, that'd be most appreciated.  With all the races unlocked, this game with the Purgation of Kaurava mod will be so much fun to play. 

If I could be of assistance, I have another copy of Soulstorm that is version 1.0, and the person who made it made a race unlocker, and all the races were unlocked in multiplayer.  If you want to add me on Skype (dark-nollij) I can send you the .reg and instructions that came with it, because it might be something simple like changing the info.plist."
,Supremor,2012-06-21T09:03Z,"Another thing I'd like to note is that while playing a multiplayer match with my friend, I was Inquisition, and about 20 minutes into the game, it crashed.  This happened 3 times. Makes me sad."
,adrian852,2012-06-23T15:11Z,"love the torrent! works great. would really appreciate it if there could be a fix to play the other races in multiplayer, or if you could put up Dark Crusade or the original Dawn of War for Mac. Really loving what your doing WinterGale! 

Thanks "
,hactor90,2012-07-08T21:56Z,Supremor how did you get the mod please give the link if you can 
,vapor276,2012-07-12T16:41Z,"this game crashes before it even opens, please help.

,WinterGale,2012-07-14T16:51Z,"@vapor276

What Mac do you have, and the specs? Maybe it has something to do with the vid card, I haven't tested this on AMD..."
