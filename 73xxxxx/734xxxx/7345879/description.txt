...the grim nightmare of the far future, where there is only war and the galaxy's alight and everyone's got a headache...

Play as one of either 9 races in a war for domination set in the Warhammer 40k Universe.

Notes: 

1. This is a WineSkin Port. I am not a porting professional so do not expect this to be a perfect port. There may be some bugs but the game is, overall, playable.

2. For speed burst, use DirectX9 Winetricks.

3. If the game plays in windowed mode, just restart the game. If windowed mode persists then try changing the screen options in Wineskin itself (DawnOfWar-SoulStorm -> Show package contents -> Wineskin -> Set Screen Options) then click Override, then choose Fullscreen.

4. I tested this game on a MacBook Air 11" late 2010 model. I just finished the Sisters of Battle Campaign, played a Skirmish game but haven't tried Multiplayer yet. So far, there were no bugs, aside from the game opening in window mode sometimes.
