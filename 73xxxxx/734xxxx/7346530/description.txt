5 5 "The Duke of Detroit" Chris Prynoski Darrick Bachman June 7, 2012 (2012-06-07) MTRC1-05 0.2
 
An incident with Kane's robots causes Mike to become overprotective of his friends, and the Burners being separated. Mike, Chuck, and Julie come across Motorcity's "The Duke of Detroit," who Mike's disrespectful nature puts him at odds with. This behavior leads to negative reprocussions as the Duke places a bounty on the Burners' heads, and every rebel group in 
Motorcity wants to get their hands on it.
