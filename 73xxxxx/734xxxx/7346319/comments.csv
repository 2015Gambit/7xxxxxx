(antivirus can detect surprise.exe as virus or malware - blame them for this^)"
,masaykh,2012-06-11T23:34Z,Blame me If you like so^))
,Azrock,2012-06-12T03:02Z,this is nonsense.. i think almost every1 already beat this game (beta) like i did since last last week.
,ArmageddonSM,2012-06-13T16:29Z,"Every TL 2 torrent have ""surprise.exe"" in it and ppl are THAT stupid to download each of them and try them out...lol"
,Toperharrier,2012-06-14T16:38Z,"Does it fix the bug with the Ember keys quest?

After I got all 3 keys I couldnt do anything in the quest place marked (not a dungeon, outside with some pillars around) with them."
,HAAHWAAW,2012-06-16T21:56Z,"It tells me the login info is invalid/incorrect, this didn't happen with the other cracked beta, help me, please respond."
,masaykh,2012-06-21T20:13Z,"dont have info on ""ember keys"" but maybe you should restart game if it is fixed .

invalid login error will pop out if firewall block lobby server emulator so it need o be running and allowed to accept network connections"
,masaykh,2012-06-21T20:14Z,ssory - play new game - not restart
,TruthLiesx,2012-07-29T22:43Z,"Yeah I'm having the same problem as HAAHWAAW...But I have the game unblocked thru my firewalls, So the connection should move freely but I keep getting the same kinda error...Any other suggestions on what I'm doing wrong?"
