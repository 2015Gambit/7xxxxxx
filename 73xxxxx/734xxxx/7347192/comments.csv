,MarkGibbons,2012-07-11T09:36Z,"Amazingly perfect, Works perfectly on my MBP w/Lion.

@Snootles - These games mainly read the drivers are are installed when you plug in your Wired Xbox 360 controller into a PC - Other drives are good for custom button mapping, but it wont work on these. Not the games fault, blame Microsoft. ;)"
