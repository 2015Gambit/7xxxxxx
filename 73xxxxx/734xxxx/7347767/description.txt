U-Boats were active from the first day of the war to the last. The menace 
provoked Winston Churchill to write, "The threat the U-Boats posed in the 
Atlantic was the only thing that really frightened me during the war. On their 
defeat hung the outcome of World War II." Witness the actions of the famed 
Wolf Packs in this riveting episode.

Iron Coffins 

The largest U-Boat housed 44 crew members who lived in their weapons of 
war for days on end in cramped and squalid conditions. Of the 38,000 men who 
fought in these machines during World War II, 30,000 would die in their iron 
coffins. Experience the Allied strategies and tactics of 1943 that caused the men 
in the U-Boats to suffer the highest mortality rate of any fighting unit in the 
history of war.
