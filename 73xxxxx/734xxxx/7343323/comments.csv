,Corbzz,2012-06-11T04:18Z,Been waiting for the two episodes you've uploaded for a while now. Anyone confirm there good?
,polarbearing,2012-06-11T07:57Z,"Yes this is the real thing. Unfortunately it still seems to have serious audio sync problems, and for it's size has terrible audio and video quality (to me). Thanks anyway for uploading this, movieboy."
,movieboy_5280,2012-06-11T12:14Z,"You're welcome polarbearing and yes it's still is not perfect.  I didn't change the size as I try not to create any more degradation than there already is.

The original was in MKV format which is probably has the least malleability than any other to work with, but I could not leave it as it was originally (off by a full 30 seconds) and there will always be some degradation any edit.

However, soon after my post, I found this:

I don't know if it's better, but it's worth a shot.

,babybluetits24,2012-06-11T15:40Z,"we want 720p of this episode and all others in s07 please

The entire series was a gift for my Dad.

Father's day was approaching fast and I had to take what I could get.

This is the messed up MKV version that was out of sync by almost 30 seconds and also the only one available at the time

Not true dude. The other link you posted is perfect sync and very nice quality. Nothing wrong with that one."
,longpole001,2012-06-16T07:44Z,"it is so far out of sync , which is pain "
,asmodeus130,2012-06-19T07:50Z,Anyone know where to get a decent copy of this? 480p would be fine. I can only find this one which is unwatchable
,asmodeus130,2012-06-19T07:51Z,Hang on it says the audio sync issue has been fixed in the description above. Anyone confirm this?
,movieboy_5280,2012-06-19T17:54Z,"Um, genuine12345...

I know that the first link
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7343136
is good.
Why do you think I posted that?
To torture you?
Get real ""Dude"".

Read the comment I left below it:

""This is the messed up MKV version that was out of sync by almost 30 seconds and also the only one available at the time

That is a mess!

My question is: Why do people only read half of a page? 
It reminds me of politicians who vote for another politician's garbage?
Because they don't read the whole thing ""dude"" or they would never vote for it in the first place!

nuff said."
,ClipperCigars,2012-06-21T06:53Z,"Your a trip. 

#1: There is NOTHING wrong with the audio sync on the 1920x1080 MVK torrent you keep referring to. The only thing wrong is that he didn't split the episodes.

#2: There IS audio sync issues with YOURS. (You even admit that it's not perfect yourself in comment #3.)

1+2 = Get yourself a better computer that can actually do serious things like play HD & re-encode video and quit talking shit. 

BTW: After reading the comments in some of your other torrents....

It's really quite clear you have no fucking idea what the hell you are doing in any capacity. You really want to help and contribute, then go away and quit wasting everyone's time with your arrogance, stupidity and low quality fucked up garbage. "
,movieboy_5280,2012-07-09T14:03Z,"5 different computers at 4 ISP's are a wrong, eh?

All I wanted to do was get my Dad one last (I have advanced liver cancer) really special Father's day gift.

Had the U.S. had your type of encouragement in 1941, I wouldn't need to  wish my German was better because the entire would would be speaking it.

None the less, I am no novice as you think.
Fixing another persons work is far more difficult than building from scratch.

I've been ripping movies long before DVD's made the main stream.  Need an example?
You like Fleetwood Mac?""

I fixed them all, and they're flawless:

The rest, well...
Have you considered working for the I.R.S?
