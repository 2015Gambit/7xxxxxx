From the director of Ip Man: The Legend is Born. Nicknamed the Woman Knight of Mirror Lake, Qiu Jin was an early feminist, revolutionist and poet in the late Qing Dynasty. Advocating equality between men and women, Qiu Jin felt that a better future for women came under a Western-type government instead of the corrupt Manchu government. Appreciating the Japanese culture after the Meiji Restoration, she went to study in Japan in 1904. Qiu Jin was beheaded after a failed uprising against the Manchu government and is considered a heroine in China's anti-feudalist cause.
