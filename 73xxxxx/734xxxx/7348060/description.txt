Xmind is the best mind mapping tool out there.

This is an official version of the Xmind that had a bug, and lets you use all the features of the pro version without having to register.

In Windows, and Linux, just close the register window, you can then start using all the pro features (export, presentation mode...)

In MacOS, it's even better, the register window never shows up.

If you like the software, go buy the last updated pro version.
