I can see if I have anything on those subjects,but I need you to be more specific in terms of titles.If I don't put in a complete title when searching my servers,it won't return a hit.I have all books listed by titles :)"
,ent802,2012-06-11T16:34Z,"@BBS- Gilbert's has a legal series on these subjects listed as ""Gilbert Law Summaries on Agency, Partnership & LLCs"", ""Gilbert Law Summaries on Civil Procedure"", and so on. West Publishing has a In a Nutshell series entitled ""Secured Transactions in a Nutshell"", and so on. Also there is Emanuel Law Outlines with titles like ""Emanuel Law Outlines: Corporations"" and so on. Thanks for any help!"
