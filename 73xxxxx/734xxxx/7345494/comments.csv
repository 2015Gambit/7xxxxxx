,rc90029,2012-06-11T18:20Z,HELL YESS footy you are the MAN.  Much love 
,Landaris,2012-06-11T18:24Z,"Thank you for your great work, footy, I love HD and I always get your F1 torrents.
Just wanted to make a suggestion: Could you leave out the duration of the race? It's a tiny spoiler. As an F1 fan, I can make some deductions about what happened in the race from its duration. I won't say here what deductions are those to avoid making a spoiler myself, but probably you know what I'm talking about.
Keep on the good work."
,vfeore,2012-06-11T21:49Z,"You're my hero footy. Thanks, mate!"
[T],footy,2012-06-11T22:46Z,"@Landaris : Ok, from next time on, i won't include the duration."
,Risk777,2012-06-12T00:33Z,"@footy:  
Thank you so much for your valuable contributions.  I, for one, appreciate the additional duration information as it pertains directly to size vs. quality of the presentation.  Only lame-O's can't stop themselves from seeing ""too much"" information.  Next thing people will ask you to blank out news of F1 results until the leeches all get your upload."
,CmdrData7,2012-06-12T16:30Z,"footy, I too am extremely grateful for your contributions.  The quality is superior and available shortly after the races are done.  You are every F1 fan's hero for sure!  And thanks for going back to 6-ch audio on SKY (unless you aren't in control of that)!"
