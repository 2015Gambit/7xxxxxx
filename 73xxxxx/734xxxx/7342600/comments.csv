,Xuvial,2012-06-10T12:31Z,"Question, is this really higher visible quality than 720p and is this completely uncompressed or something? Daman's 720p are 177mb and this 1080p is 1.66gb. Sorry I don't know very much about bitrates/compression. "
,theshape31,2012-06-10T17:09Z,"SecTPB-
Thank you so much for the 1080p rip!  Keep up the great work!

Xuvial-
An uncompressed rip would be at least twice this size.  If you have a 1080p display, the visual difference is obvious.  If you have a 720p display, then just download SecTPB's 720p release instead.  Any HD rip of this show that's around 700MB and higher will look real nice on a larger screen.  The super compressed rips, like Daman's, that are less than 200MB, look fine on a very small screen like a 13"" laptop.

Cheers :)"

,PAULEC252,2012-06-11T07:57Z,"I can attest that Daman's vids look great on a 27"" 720p screen as well."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-11T08:08Z,actually an uncompressed Rip would have 100X this size for 30mins

,jediluc,2012-06-14T08:37Z,Thanks for uploading a 1080p version in mp4. Wish you'd upload it sooner though. XD
