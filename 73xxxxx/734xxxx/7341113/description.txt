Saxophonist Aram Shelton has become a fixture on the modern jazz scene in
Chicago, Oakland and many other places around the globe. As a leader or
participant in several different groups he has had the chance to explore many of
the facets of improvised music. On this album with his group Arrive, with Jason
Adasiewicz on vibraphone, Jason Roebke on bass and Tim Daisy on drums, they
explore the open ended intersection between free jazz and composed music that
was the hallmark of great musicians of the 1960ΓÇÖs like Andrew Hill, Bobby
Hutcherson and Eric Dolphy. ΓÇ£CradleΓÇ¥ brings that Blue Note axis to the forefront
with the band rotating on a broad musial axis in their choppy melody and fluid
improvisation. ΓÇ£LostΓÇ¥ is a special performance, a ballad that is yearning for
release through a spacious interlude of mysterious sounding vibes. The pace
gradually picks up to a strong climactic finish led by strong saxophone. The
spare and open feel also pervades ΓÇ£FifteenΓÇ¥ which has stuttering saxophone and
drums setting the stage for a spare, open and spacious performance. ΓÇ£FrostedΓÇ¥
slows things even further to a hushed conversation between vibes and brushes
before SheltonΓÇÖs tight saxophone enters, giving the music a light and open
feel. The album is concluded with ΓÇ£GoldenΓÇ¥ where bass and vibes set a subtle
groove before the leader picks up the pace with strong saxophone driving the
performance to a powerful conclusion.
