[T],Snowhiter,2012-06-12T12:18Z,Ok - got rid of the 'clicking' for ya - there is still very occasional juddering - this is due to the source material and not the encoding process. Comments appreciated but there is nothing further I can do with E01 or E02. E03 onwards as you know are fine. Thanx for your patience...

I already watched all episodes from 1 to 5. I've been looking all over for episodes 6 to 10, but I could only find it in Hebrew. Any chance you could upload the next ones? :) Thanks!"

Thanks a lot for this. Let's just hope that there's a rerun sometime in order to get a better version for E01 and E02.

Again, you are astonishing!"
