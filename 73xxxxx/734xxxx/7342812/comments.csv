,iMars666,2012-06-10T18:25Z,Why is this torrent larger than the extremezone one? Where did the (micro) extra size come from?
,iMars666,2012-06-10T18:33Z,"@stuff4u00 Its DVD - but you have to account for the size reduction and conversion to avi - The quality is compressed.

If the file was left as is (.vob/.ifo) when it was ripped from the DVD the quality would be much higher as it would not have been compressed - and the size would be much higher. Plus many people seem to be unable to figure out how to play .vob/.ifo files."

,klahvubo,2012-07-08T06:43Z,awesome download speed less than 10 minutes thanks buddy ill seed for awhile
,1Atheist,2012-07-11T03:32Z,CINAVIA Protected!!!! If you plan the fault of the uploaders of these movies! It's the fault of the Motion Picture Studios trying to give us the shaft in an already deplorable economy!!! That's why I'm fighting to be RID of this Monetary System so that we will have ALL we need WITHOUT the dysfunction of the current system! www.thevenusproject.com
,1Atheist,2012-07-11T03:46Z,"I was saying that if you plan to view on your PS3, then you're SCREWED! It's NOT the fault of the uploaders! It's the fault of the Movie companies screwing us!! If you watch on your Computer or DVD Player (after burning onto DVD+R), then you should be fine. Let's support the idea of getting away from this fucked up system so that WE will be 1st priority. NOT businesses!! www.thevenusproject.com"
,jimmyb123,2012-07-11T07:36Z,"Yes I did like sonny, Samsung is going down hill to, why do they have to become  CINAVIA knob gobblers. I still like playing games and streaming on it, but I fnhate every time you go to play it, it forces you to update……. O well.  I went and got a cheep LG blue ray player, that plays every thing, and it will not connect to the web and update. It was time to move on.  PS thanks for the sharing, I also watched this in 3D at the theater and yes it defiantly could of had a better story line to it. But I guess I was use to the original one. 
V8 A8 M you decide. I liked it"
,zmogusnr1,2012-07-13T19:25Z,the video and audio is great but the movie concept is sort of old and crappy

,c6burns,2012-07-16T13:52Z,"Ahahahaha someone actually linked the venus project ... so funny. Yeah instead of dealing with our own fucking unlimited wants and twisted personalities ... let's invent a place where there are no economic inequalities using the magic of technology we havent invented yet. GENIOUS PROJECT. Im gonna start my own called the You Are A Fucktard project. Anyone who is too naive to understand technology, the economy, and human nature can join and bitch about shit they dont understand. Should be great! Ill get Jaques Fresco to keynote speak at our yearly conferences lololololololol"
,c6burns,2012-07-16T13:59Z,Anyway best of luck to the venus project on making a place where there are literally zero economic scarcities. Naivete vs the world ... FIGHT!

,Fritz.,2012-07-22T07:45Z,"That Venus Project is some guys scam to make money. Just look at the main website one time, the first things you see are links to donate money and buy their products.

They are preaching about changing the world but what they are doing is marketing you to purchase their items.

The thing is there are so many stupid people out there that will fall for it that chances are the old man has gotten rich off of it."
,Fritz.,2012-07-22T07:58Z,"anyhow there are basic realities to human nature that would make the venus project unattainable even if it was a real thing.

people want to be better off than the next guy. they want to be richer, with a bigger house, more power, and so on. 

wealth means having more than the average person, it is not a specific number you reach, and for wealth to have any meaning only a small percentage of people can have greater means than the rest.

those who have wealth and power will never willingly give it up and they will fight and kill to keep it.

these things are part of human nature and have been since the birth of our species. people will use anything to get that wealth and power, be it gangs, cults, religion, politics, or anything else that will set them above the standard person.

some things you just cannot change."
