The new Rune Angel Troupe features Emblem Frames from NEUE and is the successor to the now disbanded Moon Angel Troupe. As for the parallel universe NEUE, it is linked to EDEN through a space called ABSOLUTE, which is a central hub to which all parallel universes are linked. This hub is referenced in the subtitle to this game, which can be translated as "Door to the Absolute Area". The sequel to this game is Galaxy Angel II Mugen Kair┼ì no Kagi.
