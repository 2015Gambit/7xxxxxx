For decades, people have been saying that America's best days are behind us.

On this week's show, Glenn Beck says our Republic won't make it to 2016.

John Bolton, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., says that our country is vulnerable because President Obama has made our military weaker.

Pat Buchanan claims that America is committing "suicide" as the population becomes less white and European.

Vernon Hill, founder of Commerce Bank, says he had to go to England to start his newest venture, Metro Bank, because American regulators now micromanage. Ellis Henican argues that regulation is needed.

Reason's Nick Gillespie contends that American culture is not in decline. People read sensational stories like this, this, or this. But when you look at data for things like teen drug use and pregnancy, and violent crime, it suggests that American kids have become more responsible.
