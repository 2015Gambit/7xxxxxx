,codyfl,2012-06-13T02:33Z,I'm pretty new to this but I'll try to seed this when it's done downloading.
,codyfl,2012-06-13T04:23Z,"The game works great. I wasn't able to connect to multiplayer, though. I'm not sure if it's the game or my computer. Also, when it asks for a keycode just google one."
,lol2funny,2012-06-17T16:40Z,Thanks! Works fine. For the serial just put AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA until its full. Thanks!!!! Seed....
,ClassicBatman,2012-07-04T02:39Z,"Hey, thanks for the Upload. I was either gonna get pay for this game, or terraria. Then I thought: Why not pirate it? thanks again"
,zelkstone,2012-07-04T16:10Z,Game works great. The only gripe I have about this is the collision detection. Dead things have a tendency to completely stop crates from moving over them. It's like a big doorstop. 
,priyoandito,2012-07-11T09:48Z,thanks for the upload! this game is cool
,Milutinking,2012-07-18T12:46Z,Thanks it downloaded really fast
,www.baixandojogos.net,2012-07-24T23:37Z,"eu quero baixar em link direto o Half-Life 1
e bom seria se ele tivesse um patch atualizado!"
,Keshie,2012-07-27T23:03Z,"If this is only 276Mb, how can it have the music? Original Half-Life CD had music as audio tracks, making the CD size over 650Mb."
,kalibcrone,2012-08-04T03:21Z,"@Keshie probably because this is a rip and the file is compressed?  Yeah, no idea if I'm correct but I probably am to an extent."
,kalibcrone,2012-08-04T03:34Z,.zip* file not rip file
,747bmw,2012-08-09T09:49Z,"I downloded this torrent and it rules
