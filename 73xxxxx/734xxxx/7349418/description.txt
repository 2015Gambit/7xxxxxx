This is the Transport Stream of S05E01 of True Blood. It's a completely(almost) untouched, raw, full quality rip as seen in HDTV. Mostly used for encoders but used to watch the episode exactly how it aired. I cut out the ads in the streams before the show, and before the ending preview using H.264 TS Cutter to save time for encoders finding and cutting out frames(Still may need a few cuts here and there as H.264 TS Cutter isn't perfect). Enjoy.
