,mudriks,2012-06-14T11:12Z,im installed this update works fine for win 7/32_bit
,dieagain20113,2012-06-14T15:09Z,update what? spec ops more missions?
,dieagain20113,2012-06-14T15:12Z,"in this download change note, is says ""No idea what is updated!"" ....lol"
,Woodah123,2012-06-15T16:59Z,the file is clearly too small to be the rest of the spec ops missions so its probably some client update or something like that if it makes you crash then i won't waste my time on it unless we need 1.2 for the spec ops missions in the future or something.
,Next_Gen_1987,2012-06-29T23:03Z,So this is the latest patch available? Probably not... Because Crapcom released next patch in 16 June...
,Furious1964,2012-09-17T22:00Z,How the bloody hell do you install this? The thing keeps saying the Windows Live has to unlock the game first.
,Furious1964,2012-09-18T03:18Z,"@Next_Gen_1987: This is not the latest patch, it's patch 132 and the latest one is 136. Speaking of which, does anyone have patch 136?"
