,LiqidKila,2012-06-15T03:32Z,"the ideal format is h.264 and aac in a mp4(m4v) container. XVID is outdated and has a smaller size to quality ratio than h.264 but is quicker to encode. if you could, upload video a level 4.1 and learn to use handbrake or some other x.264 encoder. heres a rule of thumb (size, quality, short encode time) pick two."
