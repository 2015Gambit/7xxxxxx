 id advise caution from this one torrent."
,xhizors,2012-06-12T04:02Z,"@ez100: Yes, I'm sure trying to watch a video file is what ""crashed your external hard drive"" and not your own lack of computer knowledge."
,poweritup,2012-06-13T19:30Z,"Rofl ez, i had no problem watching it "
,ez100,2012-06-15T02:47Z,"heres wats up faggot, no it wasnt my lack of computer knowledge i fixed it own my own by converting it. serves me right for trying to be nice :) so please go fuck urself :D!"
,xhizors,2012-06-15T06:25Z,"@ez100: yes, extracting a video file stopped ""your external hard drive from crashing."" Seems legit that this MKV, although thousands of people including me can watch it without having to remove the video from the container first."
