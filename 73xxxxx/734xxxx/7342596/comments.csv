are you in load of ""Spotnicks - If you could reas my mind""? 
It's a part of my youth I often listened to in radio and I tried to play on guitar, too - but only with pretty limited success ;-)"
,pupovaczlatko,2012-06-10T10:12Z,"Hi beaujoulais
superb guitar interpretation of this lovely song
This hit by Gordon Lightfoot was the 145th #1 song on what is now the Billboard's Adult Contemporary charts. It also hit #5 on the Top 40 charts, #1 in Canada and on their AC charts, #19 in New Zealand, #28 in Australia, and #30 in the United Kingdom.

My next uplod will be - 
Gordon.Lightfoot.-.If.You.Could.Read.My.Mind   

If you don't mind  I would like to add you as a co-author on my projects. Your comments and suggestions are always greatly appreciated"
