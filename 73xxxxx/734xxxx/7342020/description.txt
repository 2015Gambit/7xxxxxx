Violent and disturbed cop Frank Christchurch has too many problems. His partner is convinced that he's mentally ill, his commanding officer is addicted to smack, and he's in pursuit of a killer whom no one else seems interested in catching. The pressure of his savage life is triggering murderous outbursts and hallucinations. Frank Christchurch is on the way down... and he might take everyone with him. From the revolutionary creator and writer of TRANSMETROPOLITAN and PLANETARY, Warren Ellis!
