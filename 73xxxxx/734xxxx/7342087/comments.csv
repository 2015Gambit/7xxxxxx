[T],vladtepes3176,2012-06-12T20:27Z,The movie works perfect. You're the only one having problems. Cheers
,Man_Alive,2012-06-13T22:33Z,thanks for the movie. cool stuff.
,angelmartin,2012-07-06T07:05Z,Only the special features are viewable. The movie itself is not there. Maybe my dl went bad somehow.
,monokosas,2012-09-06T07:01Z,Yeah I can't change the name of the file either. Apparently a necessity if I want to play it on my PS3 with Vuze.
