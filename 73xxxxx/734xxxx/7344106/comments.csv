sorry for the early comment.i will also upload x64 bit version soon."
,mthpgh,2012-06-12T19:40Z,"Having a bit of trouble with this one... it d/l'ed ok, burned to disc ok, but in the latter parts of install, it simply stops.  The progress bar doesn't move, and even though it appears in my program files, it can't be opened since it's ""not done installing"" yet.... has anyone else had this difficulty or can they give an idea of what to do from here?  Thanks!"
,mthpgh,2012-06-12T20:19Z,"UPDATE:   Ya' know what? - - nevermind my last post - - it just took forever to complete, but it's up & running fine, now!  Thanks for what looks like a clean UL and a great version!!!!"
,Darkdragontc,2012-06-13T19:39Z,64 bit is having a problem to be activated and as i said for the 32 bit as well. so either there is something i'm missing or it's just me.
,mthpgh,2012-06-14T14:32Z,"UPDATE:   I've just done an update from Microsoft and it updated and seems to be running perfectly, up to now!  After 30/60/90 days, I guess we'll have to see then, but for now, this is a great torrent, and I recommend it!  Clean and operable without any of the run-around crap!!!"
,Esp_Rle,2012-06-20T11:06Z,"Product is unlicensed on my WinXP System,,,,any idea why activation required?"
,radische,2012-06-25T00:27Z,Fails to activate. Microsoft says file is not one of theirs.
,Esp_Rle,2012-06-26T19:19Z,But thanks mrriser007 for the VL copy though!!

,mthpgh,2012-08-01T20:48Z,"UPDATE:   D/L'ed 6/12/12 - - today is 8/1/12 and it's still working fine!  The KMS triggers the AVG ""Unwanted Program/Possible Virus"" alert, but there's no virus at all, so far.... everything's running aces!!!  Thanks for a great upload!"
