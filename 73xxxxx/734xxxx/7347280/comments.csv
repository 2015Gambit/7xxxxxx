,cinemaniac905,2012-07-04T03:11Z,a re-encode is NOT a bluray rip...fucking scene morons.
,Twitch.29,2012-07-07T03:20Z,"Gotta agree with cinemaniac905 here. Gettin sick of all this BD bullshit. It's not a BD unless it's ripped direct from a Bluray disk or re-encoded from a RAW Bluray rip! Grabbed it anyway as, unlike the others at similar size, at least the source is 1080p. Thanks for the upload scenebalance. ADTRG, lable your shit correctly..."
