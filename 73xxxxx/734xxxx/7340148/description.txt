SUMMARY (IMDB) 

Based on a story by Bruno Schulz, The Hourglass Sanatorium 
depicts its protagonist, Joseph (Jan Nowicki), traveling 
through a dream-like world, taking a dilapidated train to 
visit his dying father in a sanatorium. When he arrives at 
the hospital, he finds the entire facility is going to ruin 
and no one seems to be in charge, or even caring for the 
patients. Time appears to behave in unpredictable ways, 
reanimating the past in an elaborate artificial caprice.
