,Notor1ous,2012-07-05T12:18Z,"When I started the game it was in demo mode and I could only play the ""free mode"". Career mode was locked. But I followed CrazyCroats instructions and it worked, now the game is full mode.
right click on the tinyiso.ini file and click edit, then change the app id to 207020, exit and save, play the game."
