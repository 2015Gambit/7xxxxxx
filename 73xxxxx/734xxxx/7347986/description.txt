I had scanned & uploaded two of my old McMillan French textbooks a month back.
In this torrent, I am sharing with you two more viz.:
Dondo's Modern French Course and Key to Dondo's Modern French Course.
This classic textbook has 550 pages & my copy is not in a very good condition.
But still I managed to scan it reasonably well in over a week.
I also had its key which I have included here.
I have OCRed them both in French & English with my multilingual ABBYY.
Hope my old French texbooks will be of use to today's learners!
