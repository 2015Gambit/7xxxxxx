In this sermon / history lesson, I preach a hat trick.

	I.   Virginia and Maryland

	II.  Myrrh and Frankincense / the Mirror and Frankenstein

	III.  An apocalyptic ending, in which pro wrestling is real.  

	The reasons for why we label pro wrestling 'fake', I do not dispute. The matches are predetermined. It's a performance, not an athletic competition. And maneuvers like piledrivers, suplexes, and jumping off the top rope, would not be seen in a real fight.
	It's because of Virginia and Maryland, and the mirror and Frankenstein, as to why I preach pro wrestling is real.
