Storyline

In Guesta Verde University, the deranged Professor Curien is trying 

to bring back the dead, killing students for the experiment. There 

is an outbreak of zombies in the campus, and the government sends a 

NSA medical research team, formed by Dr. Alexandra Morgan a.k.a. 

Nightingale and lieutenant Ellis, with a special force leaded by 

lieutenant Dalton, trying to get the zero sample from the first 

generation zombie. The team has a very short time to accomplish 

their mission and leave the place before missiles are sent to 

destroy the area. However, the place is crowded of hyper sapiens and 

the group has to fight to survive.
