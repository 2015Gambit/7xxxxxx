DESCRIPTION:

An innovation guide for business leaders, managers, and new product developers
The Innovator's Toolkit explains all the fundamental tools and concepts anyone involved in innovation should be familiar with--especially methods and strategies for improving products and services and developing new ones. 
This book is written in an easy-to-use reference format that helps readers understand why, when, and how to apply each tool. 
The tools and techniques in this book are organized around a four-step innovation methodology--define, discover, develop, and demonstrate--that takes readers through problem identification, then flows into idea generation, idea selection, and, finally, idea implementation. 
Constant innovation is a necessity for business success today; The Innovator's Toolkit presents an effective plan for achieving it.
