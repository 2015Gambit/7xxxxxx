Firstly, thank you for all of your hard work, I appreciate the program and language software. I have downloaded this language pack and everytime I try to run it (double click) it is quarantined and removed by my Norton AV software, quoting WS.Reputation.1 . I was wondering if you have seen this, or have any recommendations? I am using the preinstalled rosetta stone, and have only tried to DL and install the preinstalled language packs (Russian is working perfectly)."
