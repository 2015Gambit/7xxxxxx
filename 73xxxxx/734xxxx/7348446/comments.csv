,xpmule,2012-06-15T00:28Z,"did MS make a real slip streamed version yet ?
the previous version of this (from MSDN)
had the service pack added to the post install folder.. which then just runs the update on your behalf at the end of the setup procedure"
,srinumad,2012-06-15T12:04Z,thanks for x64 bit
,joeynot1,2012-06-16T22:22Z,"If it needs to be activated, then it's not a good torrent. Don't waste your time"

,metasomas,2012-06-20T04:38Z,Downloaded fine but the activation bar came up. Does it go away eventually or......
,metasomas,2012-06-20T04:43Z,Downloaded it but the activation screen told me I have 29 days. Like that crazy girl from the well. Does this go away or.....
,X_Light,2012-06-21T09:21Z,"Works just fine.
Keep up the good work!"
,tempest4u2,2012-06-27T08:22Z,down loaded it today and it worked perfect... and really fast too....for those of you who are having trouble you need to have a program like winzip or something to unpack it and then simply install.... the installation application should be the one right at the very bottom in the unzipped folder... just double click and follow the instructions and thats it.... worked perfect for me and its totally ligit no activation keys or anything needed and it up dates perfectly from windows as a genuine product... * my os is 7 64bit*
,poopsnoop,2012-06-28T09:15Z,"If it requires activation, just google ""EZ Activator"". It'll activate your copy very quickly."
,Cosmo69,2012-07-04T22:48Z,Very nice !!! Thank you so much mrriser007 !!!
,Atlantis_0,2012-07-05T17:55Z,"It requires activation. Mounted with UltraISO premium, installed, went to word (help) product is not activated..so...your instructions: download, install..means not done !
With or without internet connection this torrent needs some instructions how to activate. There are comments like: yeah great , this and that...How do you check if the product is activated? Just because it doesn't require serial key? Open Word, click on File ( left upper corner), then on Help..read what it stands on the right pane. If it stands Product Activated ...I'll buy you a night with Paris Hilton. 
The only way to activate MSO 2010 Pro + is through the phone. EZ doesn't work anymore. And if you need instructions How To, it would be mrriser007 who need to ask me first !"
,1dallek1,2012-07-07T05:53Z,it dosen't work the poster is jerking you off
,samuelrv16,2012-07-11T04:34Z,"i've downloaded on july 10

,LBRent,2012-07-12T05:13Z,"If you need to activate, use serialsws.org. Theres a whole bunch of serials but this one worked for me BGPMF-PF97D-XVBF2-XDF33-7CKWW.  if that one doesn't work, try another one til you get it. Happy torrenting!"
,skiesfell,2012-07-14T20:20Z,I made a DVD and it installed with no problems - hasn't asked for activation yet....
,skiesfell,2012-07-14T20:22Z,"I burned a DVD, and it installed fine.  Hasn't asked for activation at this point...."
,m2lnc,2012-07-16T02:59Z,"I've downloaded a few of these and I keep getting the message to activate the product. Thanks to LBrent, I went to that site you recommended, used a few serials and 1 worked. I then activated using a telephone."
,MuffinManxD,2012-07-18T00:22Z,"Downloaded in 50 secs, great! Thx."
,juhstin,2012-07-23T08:03Z,"guys if you dont want the activation screen to come up--for any program, in that matter-- just use windows advanced firewall..."
,vickedv,2012-07-27T08:45Z,"Works fine....
