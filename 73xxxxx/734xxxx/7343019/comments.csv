[V],DibyaTPB,2012-06-10T19:05Z,Its pre-episode. 00
,Bakaat,2012-06-10T19:44Z,"Just watched it. Looks like they didn't spend too much time doing this. The acting seems ""forced""... Sam doesn't seem right. They probably didn't give him the usual 15 takes to get it right - LOL. Thanks for the up. I can just about watch anything Burn Notice."
,R9k6wh0naIK,2012-06-10T20:06Z,"Bakaat--sounds like you're just like me! Obsessed with anything Burn Notice. I have never heard of a ""pre-episode"" and I also know that BN doesn't air until June 14th.

Thanks for posting what this was. I wasn't sure I could trust it!

CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 14TH! If it wasn't for the kind folks here at TPB, I wouldn't be able to see it at all!"
,R9k6wh0naIK,2012-06-10T23:46Z,Just watched this. This is a 3 minute scene / promo from the season 6 premiere. It's far easier to watch it on youtube.
,Bakaat,2012-06-11T23:59Z,"Yes, I'm pretty ""obsessed"" with it. I have all 5 seasons on my computer and backed up on an external hard drive. I've watched the first 4 seasons at least 4 times and the 5th at least twice. I wish I had known this was on youtube, but no harm, no foul. enjoy the new season!"
