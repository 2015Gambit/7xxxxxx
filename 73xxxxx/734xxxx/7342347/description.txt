Crimes that Changed History: The Killer Clown
In 1978 the grisly discovery of a crudely buried collection of skeletons beneath a house in Illinois led police to one of the most notorious serial killers in US history: John Wayne Gacy aka the 'Killer Clown'. Accused of 33 murders, Gacy was known for his appearances at charitable events and children's parties dressed as 'Pongo the Clown'. With a staggering number of human remains to identify, investigators turned to expert forensic anthropologist Dr. Clyde Snow for help - and in doing so, paid a debt to the ground breaking CSIs who used similar techniques to convict the murderous 'sausage king of Chicago' almost a hundred years earlier.
