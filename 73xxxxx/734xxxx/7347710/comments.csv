hmmm NO TRAILER on IMDb that I can see....there are reviews tho, ""Everything else about the film is decidedly sub-par, be it the awful acting or the easily predictable plot 'twists'."" OOooft doesn't really suprise me since Voight is nuttier than a squirrel-sh@t, and subsequently cannot choose a script to save himself, just look at National Treasure....or wait no don't!! :/"
