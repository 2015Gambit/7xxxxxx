Back to full-lengths, for no reason other than I found this album and decided you needed to hear it all. What a goddamn wacky record.

Basically, this guy is really Peter Walker, one-time member of 60's psych group The Purple Gang. He got into witchcraft, Aleister Crowley, and all that stuff, and dropped off the face of the earth for a while. When he returned, he made everyone call him Lucifer and made two very bizarre records, this being the first. He also perpetuated a myth that he was actually a full band recording in an Arizonan cave. Not true. He's a basement weirdo from the UK. And he doesn't have a band. Oh well, this album is pretty obviously the work of one person, with its off-kilter blues-structures, completely mind-fucked LSD vocals, and the general wrong-ness of the whole thing.
