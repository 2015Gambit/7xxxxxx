,MattandBri2008,2012-06-10T17:51Z,you might want to check your firewall to see if you're able to get out with limewire at all. could be that your firewall setting is disallowing you to connect with the program.
,MitchAllen,2012-06-17T11:39Z,Yeah i been having issues with limewire since they took it down. The pirate ones have access thru my firewall but it just keep saying connecting... I know there is a file that helps with this issue guess ill hunt. Thanks for the upload.
