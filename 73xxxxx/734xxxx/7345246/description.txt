DJ SCHEIßEFRITZ - RAUMFAHRER [MBR000]
MINDBLAST RECORDS 2011

Celebrating the founding of this label and the launch of this site, DJ Scheißefritz’s debut album Raumfahrer is the first release – only digital – but still pretty awesome.
Feels like a wannabe soundtrack for 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Retro-futurism at it’s best.
