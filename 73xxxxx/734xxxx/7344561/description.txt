Yes it is true, the classic movie in Hi-Def Half-Side-By-Side 3D with 5.1 audio for fans wanting to experience it with an added dimension.


If you are at all sceptical about 3D converts, feel negative about their quality or feel in any way that downloading this might cause you stress, upset or anger then please DO NOT download.  If you proceed with downloading this and even after my warning still feel compelled to comment along the lines of, 'nobody wants converts, quality is crap etc etc' you will be ignored.


Also, please only download this movie if you own the original movie in one format or another.
