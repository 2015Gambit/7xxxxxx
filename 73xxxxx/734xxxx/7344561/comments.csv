audio is in sync and the 3D gives added depth to a classic chick flick what more can you ask for for free?"
,whatami12,2012-06-14T08:42Z,"""Plain and simple, no one wants Converts.""
At least 19 people here will disagree with that.

""They are shitty and do not belong here.""
Obviously the mods don't agree or they would have removed this by now.

I don't like converts myself but I respect those who do. Isn't this what the spirit of sharing on sites like this all about?"
,D4RK-KN1GHT,2012-06-14T11:05Z,"there is limited 3D content available and a lot of duplication so i convert classic titles from blu-ray, watch them first to make sure they are ok on my 50"" 3D TV then upload here.  i put a CONVERT prefix to my upload and a whole paragraph to stop foley84 commenting but he seems on a personal crusade to diss every convert without even downloading them and uploads nothing.  until there is a 3D Convert section this is the only place to upload converts for those of us grateful for a bit of new content."
,D4RK-KN1GHT,2012-06-15T11:25Z,"i have asked the moderators to look at the comments on this page and determine whether they are in the spirit of TPB and what it stands for and their decision will be final

foley84 does not even download the conversion just campaigns against all converts

potential downloaders should note there are no other negative comments but please once you have viewed the conversion come back and review it either way"
