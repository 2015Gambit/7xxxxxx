this is not my rip just conversion and improvements"
[V],psspss,2012-06-10T09:24Z,"This is a cam rip.. for the poor that cant afford to see it at the movies or buy
the dvd when it comes out.

V=5 A=7 but some will rate it lower no doubt :)

also suggest a good ip hider and peer block soft installed"
[V],psspss,2012-06-10T09:46Z,16 fake seeders already BTW
[V],psspss,2012-06-10T10:21Z,i forgot to add.. 1008bitrate 768x360p mp3 128 audio 25 fps
,viv_jen,2012-06-10T12:30Z,screens?
[V],psspss,2012-06-10T13:42Z,"no scrns sorry.. just slightly better then the original rip i guess. 

I watched it.. 2 hrs long though.. wasnt bad

its watchable on laptop anyhow.. not too bad for cam.. not quiet
sharp TS quality as yet

but really its just another alien movie.. no surprises

I think in the end the movie produces more questions then answers

however I see this is one of 2 prequels from what I understand
without making a spoiler"
,KD271158,2012-06-10T14:36Z,"Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!
For being the first sensible person I've encountered  in ages. You actually did what needed to be done! Then,to top it off you shared the result!WOW! 
I never thought I would actually ever encounter another sensible,decent,intelligent,well mannered person  on any sharing site again.
My hat is off to you.
Everyone ,please learn from this. 
One person doing the right thing ,has made the situation better for everyone. Imagine if we all just did what needed to be done instead of hundreds of hours of people power, being wasted, bickering and criticising each others efforts.
Just take a mere few seconds to hold that thought."

,Neraforesta,2012-06-10T17:55Z,"Aside from the Space Jockey and the one Ship, this is not, in any way a prequel to Aliens. Plenty of articles already written about this very subject. Yes, I would like to believe it was, and they finally got a hot chick in Charlice Theron, instead of a Man-Boy like Sigorney Weaver. However, anyone who would have any interest in the background of this story would already know that this isn't a prequel, and a prequel is actually in production.  This was originally supposed to be the prequel, but Fox movies is the one who screwed that all up cause they wanted to make more money with a more family friendly rating."
,Vulcan219,2012-06-10T21:09Z,"Thanks psspss for the conversion, also you can re encode from vlc as well and re edit is too, but that is another story. I may take your version and tinker with it as well and see if it can be improved with some of the new encoding programs I am trying out, if it can't be improved upon then I will leave it as is and enjoy the effort you made. Again Thanks for the upload."
,anubis25,2012-06-10T21:23Z,"a=6 v=4 
This is a very watchable copy 
thanks for the upload"
[T],Skymocker,2012-06-10T21:35Z,"GREAT quality for a cam, the resolution seems to improve a short while into the movie, audio is completely understandable. 

top marks, thanks."
,special_ed_420,2012-06-11T00:05Z,does it have the scene after the end credits? 
,lazano82,2012-06-11T01:42Z,"Neraforesta ...you missed the boat buddy. This is absolutely a prequel to the Alien story. This is the first of a 2 part series that predates the original Alien movie from 1979 with Sigourney weaver. If you notice the origins of the face huggers, you'll see that they began life as snake like creatures, and they were created from the mutation of the black organic fluid and the DNA of the Engineer at the beginning of the movie. Then *SPOILER, read no further if you haven't watched the movie yet!!* then face hugger that erupts from Dr. Shaw after she contracts the viral alien DNA strands from the semen of her boyfriend, Dr. Charlie Holloway, after he is intentionally infected by David. THAT same proto-face hugger then grows into a giant ancient version of the face huggers we all know and love from the Alien movie onward, up to the most recent Alien movie. All of the face hugger variations follow the same life cycles as the Aliens we know, by ingestion of an egg through he mouth of the host body. Also, if you know HR Giger artwork whatsoever, which i'm sure you don't, you'll know that the Engineer, in its exo-skeletal shell suit, sitting in that telescope-like navigation machine at the heart of the spacecraft, is a very OLD piece by HR Giger, and he is quoted as stating that it IS at the origin of the Alien franchise/story. Get your shit right before posting nonsense, even here on dumb torrent comment posts you dumb noob! :) 

For reference, this torrent is fairly decent for a cam, and psspss did a pretty darn good job converting the WBZ rip to enhance, overall A5/V5, not bad, totally watchable. So far though, the HOPE one has been the best. Hopefully we can get an R5 or a TS soon :-/

Thanks very much either way!"
,lazano82,2012-06-11T01:44Z,"You ARE half right though ...there IS another prequel (the 2nd par of Prometheus) coming out in late 2013/early 2014, that will continue the tale of the Engineers, Dr. Shaw, and the origins of the Aliens as well as Humankind. Good shit :) "
,lazano82,2012-06-11T02:28Z,"Holy crap, and I completely forgot ...how the HELL can you say this isn't a prequel, *SPOILER ALERT* when at the end of the freaking movie, an ALIEN POPS OUT OF THE ENGINEER!!! That Engineer was ingested with an Alien egg from the giant proto-face hugger that popped out of Dr. Shaw! 

HOLY NOOB, YOU ARE FREAKIN DUMB!

This is without any shadow of a doubt a prequel to the Alien story, sorry pal, it is. Do some homework before posting anything every again, jackass!"
[V],psspss,2012-06-11T04:21Z,"man you people like to post spoilers..

you meant to post such things to a forum not
the torrent so it dont ruin it for people not seen it yet

and YES THIS has the ending added to prev comment.. didnt i say that in the header?d"
,Dillin,2012-06-11T08:58Z,thanks for the upload man. 
,mongylloyd,2012-06-11T11:19Z,haha! cam rip for the poor! What a charitable idea.
,rgoulart,2012-06-11T18:14Z,"very good quality for a CAM, very watchable, and the audio is totally understandable. thank you for your efforts in improving the quality of the video and for putting together the last scene at the end of the movie. thank you."
,cantones,2012-06-11T19:45Z,"Thanks for this, i wanna see the movie but mi english level is not too good. Anybody know where i can download a spanish subtitles? or maybe a english subtitle, thanks, this movie does not release until August in my country. Thanks man."
[V],psspss,2012-06-12T01:34Z,"you try these... you might have to adjust them for 25fps though.. theres a free subs editor that can do that.. dont have a link for it though.. google about

some players *kmplayer can auto adjust fps I believe for when text appears  but never works well..
you still best with vlc since its sharpener is unique and enhances whites in a better way then other players like kmplayer

,pink50,2012-06-12T08:16Z,i know everyone will be mad at me when i say this but this movie kinda sucks..im a big fan of all the alien movies as i have watched them over and over..but this movie isnt anywhere near the entertaining qualities as the alien trilogy..
,cicerodiello,2012-06-12T09:17Z,"Neraforesta:  Sigourney Weaver as Ripley is one of cinema's all time great heroes.  She absolutely kicks arse and is a true icon.  I don't see the point in comparing her to Charlize Theron in PROMETHEUS.  Theron wasn't required to do much.  Sigourney is sexy, bad-ass, vulnerable and maternal.  As for PROMETHEUS not being a prequel?  Go watch ALIEN and see with your own eyes the dead ringer alien spacecraft.  "
,cantones,2012-06-12T12:37Z,"thanks psspss, i always use VLC, for the subtitles are a amazing video player. I can translate and resync the subtitles with Aegisub, but that is a hard and loud work for me haha no problem, i have time. Thanks.

P.D.: The end scene looks better than the entire cam movie release ;)"
[V],psspss,2012-06-12T12:52Z,"not sure the spource of the end bit added on..
perhaps it was from a trailer?

odd no tsrip or new sources out still.. espc from russia lol

sorry the url link changed some chars so you have to change them manual to find the subs for the movie someone made for this rip.. the eng subs for it.
wont need changing as I think it was also 25fps
so you should be good to go"
,adyc80,2012-06-12T13:02Z,"Thanks for this psspss and have to agree with pink50 im a big fan of alien movies and this 1 does kinda suck, abit slow and full scientology pseudo religous crap"
,CyUK,2012-06-13T00:57Z,"adyc80 it's main theme is evolution, not Scientology. I don't even want to go into Scientology because it's just utterly bogus."
,yahmez,2012-06-13T06:17Z,This version is missing the scene where Dr. Shaw and David leave the planet. Sorry about the spoiler.
[V],psspss,2012-06-13T09:07Z,"whats with all these fake uploaders.. i guess woodyholly can hire dumb arse indians for a buck to join and upload shit or something..

looks like mine is still the only true full version here
which is watchable

a tsrip cant be far away though.. taking their time"
[V],psspss,2012-06-13T09:10Z,"no it hasnt a missing scene.. you see the ship lifting off you must have real bad eyes.. and I thought mine were bad
but some video noise happens about that point
and is cut off a weebit early

then you see the missing segment after that"
[V],psspss,2012-06-14T05:37Z,"finally a new HD CAM source out hope it has ending too as I will wait myself for a dvdrip to come out now but for those that cant wait heres the new one

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7352340/Prometheus.2012.HD.CAM.NEW.SOURCE.XViD-26K"
[V],psspss,2012-06-15T06:11Z,"seems that new source above better video but worse audio LOL still better to wait for a dvd rip
this cam is still watch and best one :) if cant wait"
,GothBoy8,2012-06-23T07:39Z,"Sorry but this video is horrible, it looks like something from 1942. It's even almost Black and White. "
