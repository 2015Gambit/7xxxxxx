,cawoodie,2012-06-13T05:02Z,Please inform me the procedure(s) one needs to go through to obtain this ebook. Does epub have the user answer surveys or is there some other lengthy process he/she has to endure? Thanks for your help.
,jimbuck2,2012-06-13T09:41Z,"cawoodie, I hope yours was a noob question as that would make it easy to answer.  Two steps are involved and thankfully no surveys.  First, install Utorrent on your computer; use the link above that says ""upgrading your torrent client!""  Second, install an ebook reader on your computer, either mobipocket or FBReader.  That's all there is to it."
