Problem is, for a 5.47Gb - 4133kbps rip, picture quality is really average, it seriously lacks of definition. No idea if it's because of the rip itself or if it's because the original bluray quality is really low
The subtitles included here suck too. They're not centered, poor font quality. Plus they're for deaf people so you'll need to edit them in order to remove all the annoying and usuless descriptions, names in caps,...
Really disappointing, this isn't any better than the 2Gb HDTVrip I've been watching for a few years now."
