     :  DESCRIPTION

     Whether we knew it or not, almost all of us have seen a PowerPoint
     presentation in one format or another. It is pervasive from the
     classroom to the boardroom and even our living room. In this series
     you will discover not only legacy and new features offered in PowerPoint
     2010 but also ensure you know how to include good design, utilize
     appropriate content and deliver polished, memorable but not overwhelming
     presentations. It's this combination of skills and techniques that
     differentiates mediocre presentations and those some would rather bury
     than have to watch from those that effectively communicate, regardless
     of the audience or purpose. This series will take you from start to
     finish covering presentation design, content creation, graphic and
     multimedia manipulation, animation and sharing, distribution and 
     presentation options. If you've known PowerPoint in the past, there
     are a lot of new features in store! If you're new to PowerPoint,
     prepare yourself for a whole new way to share your thoughts, ideas and
     experiences using this phenomenal presentation tool!
