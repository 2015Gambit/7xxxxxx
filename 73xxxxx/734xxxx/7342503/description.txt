RELEASE DESCRIPTION:

When a sudden eviction prompts James (Jameel Saleem) to move in with his new girlfriend Kim

(Kimelia Weathers), the sudden realization that she's completely insane leaves him scrambling for

an excuse to break off the relationship and reclaim his independence. James and Kim have only

been dating for three months when James is suddenly forced out of his apartment. Moving in with

Kim seems like a given at first, but now the more time he spends with her, the more certain he

becomes that they're a match made in hell. Desperate, James turns to his pals Carville (Quincy

"Qdeezy" Harris) and Leona (Noelle Balfour) for tips on how to let Kim off easy, but when subtlety

fails, the frustrated boyfriend realizes he's got his work cut out for him.
