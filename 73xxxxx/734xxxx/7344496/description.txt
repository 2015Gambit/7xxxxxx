KickHaas is a VST effect for Windows.

It is a "stage placement" effect. It gets a mono or stereo input and calculates early reflections in real time.

Place walls, source and listener, draw equalisation curves for materials and for sound perception (localisation cues, side, rear), mix early reflections to the sound in true stereo, in realtime.



Installation:

-  Next open the rar file by double clicking it. If you can't open it you need to get an archiver which supports rar files such as Winrar and extract.

- Run Setup to Install


    
               -  That's it. Done. enjoY!!!
