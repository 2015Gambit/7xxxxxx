Yet another show like auction hunters and storage wars. battle of the channels with copycat shows huh

anyhow.. some are wrongly calling this Season 2.. but seems
some missed up the naming of season 1.. according to a few sites
like below and trutv itself.. it appears to be season 3.. as their
listing for season have 10 episodes only not 20
so you might have to rename your old episodes ://

In the Season 3 premiere, a pair of newbies infringe on Brandon and Lori's turf and push the couple to spend more than they'd like, while a bunch of storage warriors bid on a set of wrapped pallets. Later, a mysterious large item piques bidders' interest.

Think storage auctions are a joke? Think again, because you don't want to mess with former boxer Brandon Bernier and his wife Lori, the fiercest competitors in a high-stakes sales game. You won't believe what they find: from hidden bundles of cash to thousand-dollar chairs, from the dangerous to the downright weird. With killer instinct, the Berniers target the best storage units in the country and go to extreme lengths to get their hands on what's stashed inside. Follow them to the country's most competitive auctions as they risk a fortune to go head-to-head with hostile locals. With so much cash at stake, it's always a dogfight to the bidder end.

help to seed if grabbing
