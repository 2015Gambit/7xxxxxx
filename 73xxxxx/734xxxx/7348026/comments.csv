,jaketrek,2012-06-13T03:20Z,"one more thing, if you are confused how to change the audio from it's default hindi sound to the CRAPPY LOW-Q english audio, (at least to try the sample he provided with the full video) most converters allow you to choose which audio to use. I use FREE MAKE VIDEO CONVERTER. its great, easy to install, free, and under 4 mb. dream come true. so simple, and yes you can choose which audio to use"
