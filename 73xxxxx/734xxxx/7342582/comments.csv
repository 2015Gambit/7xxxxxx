,barnchad,2012-06-12T07:49Z,Thanks for all the downloads. You have became my favorite stop!!
,rbtpbu,2012-09-05T03:49Z,"This download has a slight bug. After installing and patching you need to edit file:
C:Program Files (x86)MSBuildCodeSmithCodeSmith.targets

change line:
CodeSmith.MSBuild.v4.0, Version=6.0.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=9fd61cdb91609a7a

to:
CodeSmith.MSBuild.v4.0, Version=6.0.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=940cfcde86f32efd

After this ""generate on build"" functions will work as expected."
,rbtpbu,2012-09-05T03:56Z,"To make this work properly you have to edit the CodeSmith.targets file located in your:
Program Files (x86).MSBuild.CodeSmith folder 
(dots are backslashes, TPB is filtering them)

change the PublicKeyToken that says:
CodeSmith.MSBuild.v4.0, Version=6.0.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=9fd61cdb91609a7a

to:
CodeSmith.MSBuild.v4.0, Version=6.0.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=940cfcde86f32efd"
