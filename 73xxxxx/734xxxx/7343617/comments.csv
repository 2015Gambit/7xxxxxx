(google search won't help very much. i've tested to make sure you can't find it so easily. besides, i already basically gave you the url, so, there.)

you won't have to wait very long to watch something. an hour after air maybe? if i recognize you at the blog i'll hook you up with a pre-release.

the only trick is you just have to be there when i'm there so you can get a link. i will not post links and leave them.

oh and if any of you visit the blog and do a major party foul by swapping my generous offering into a public torrent, that blog will be shut down, and you'll have to go back to waiting however long it takes for something to eventually reach p2p.

this includes you psspss. i know you know of the blog. the previous op of it said you wanted in on it but you were rejected. if you get one of my pre-releases and swap it into some shit for demon or tpb, we will know.

one more thing for pisspiss:
STOP CHANGING THE FRAMERATE!
29.97 to 25 means missing frames which in turn creates slightly jerky playback.
23.976 to 25 means duplicate frames and you're just wasting space.
you're wasting enough space by still doing constant bitrate encoding.

then again you've already stated you're fine with 1980's VHS quality in this day and age of high-definition.  yes I was around in the days of VHS, too.  I use to have to get up and hit the tracking buttons to get a clearer picture.  yep, before remote controls. still have some VHS tapes even; they look like shitty ass compared to what's available today.

thats the difference between you and I: quality. I strive for the best and you seem to hardly give half a damn. you just regurgitate stuff with some of the hokiest software using the worst settings to encode. tsk tsk psspss"
