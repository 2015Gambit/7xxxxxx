HOWEVER, there is something not quite right with the 3D image. Its just like when you have has just one too many bears and your vision is getting a little squiffy. It seems sort of out of focus or semething.
Of course it could be my equipment but I dont think so. LG 55inch LED (passive glasses). I have not had this sort of problem before.

Anyway, for me and mine, its unwatchable so, sorry, but I wont be seeding.

Anyone else had the same problem?"

,jboner55,2012-06-14T04:15Z,"Ahh, finally a prolem i know how to fix!

Had this problem with the first movie.

The default on the LG is left/right for sbs (go under 3d video options)

Change it to right/left and it should work perfectly.

(might be vice versa, just change it to the other orientation)

Good luck!"
,EarKandy,2012-06-14T12:10Z,"Nah, didn't work. Made no difference at all which setting I had it on, right/left or left/right. There is just something wrong with it. Makes my eyes hurt and gives me a headache! I even got a second opinion from my wife, whose eyesight is excellent, and she says the same. 

Sorry, old sausage, it just aint right.

On a brighter note. I tried the right/left trick on a version of John Carter 3D I downloaded the other day which was also a tad peculiar and that worked a treat. Imporoved the image enormously. 

So, thanks for the tip. I'll use it again in the future if necessary.

In the meantime uploader, any chance of re-coding Piranha to correc the image?

Cheers. "

The other torrent from this same uploader (Top Cat) suffers from the same problem. This can happen when during ripping, the software skips a frame or two."
,frikkinamaaan,2012-06-20T17:00Z,"THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT WASN'T RIPPED FROM A 3D DISC.... IT WAS ""CONVERTED"" TO 3D BY SOFTWARE... MAKES SOME THINGS LOOK CLOSE AND SOME THINGS FAR AWAY... TO POST IT AS A 3D MOVIE IS A LOAD OF CRAP AND WHOEVER MADE THIS SHOULD BE SLAPPED..."
