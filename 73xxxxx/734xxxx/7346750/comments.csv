,stevenjj24,2012-06-11T21:48Z,same goes here..wtf
,kimcaine74,2012-06-11T21:52Z,tank you very much!! :)))
,KranK_,2012-06-11T21:54Z,30 gigs for such a crappy movie seems like a waste of bandwidth...If it was a great movie maybe 30 gigs would be worth it.
,Revisionist,2012-06-11T22:40Z,Never been happy with any HDChina releases.  This just screams synch issues.  I also doubt they had the proper RAM to encode properly.  Better off finding a VOB IMO if you want that high of a quality
,1mann,2012-06-11T22:58Z,thanks in advance 
,1mann,2012-06-11T23:02Z,very slow atm 2.6kbs? hope it gets better/faster
,daboblin,2012-06-12T01:00Z,"The reason it's so large is that it includes DTS-HD audio plus five other audio tracks, as well as two hidden video streams. In other words, it's a straight Blu-Ray transfer and thus has the big Blu-Ray file size."
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-06-12T01:25Z,"Please someone verify for us if this release is more crap from HDChina, or if they actually got it right this time.

Thanks!"
,silenttrigge,2012-06-12T01:29Z,may we request for a 720p version? it will be much appreciated. Thanks and cheers from the philippines
,CCWGGuy,2012-06-12T03:07Z,"Umm, Why has no one commented that this is a ton of tiny videos.  Downloading it now but there's like 62 smalll videos in a folder.  I dont get it? "
,Oblivilot,2012-06-12T03:15Z,"Very odd. I have been attempting to download this for multiple hours; when I check back with the bit torrent client, I keep finding it at totally zero in the download column, and yet seeding out - while I am at only 9.9% complete. In addition, what is this ""BDMV"" and ""Certificate"" folder structure? There are dozens of other sub folders inside those two folders... Pausing this one for the moment."
,pjones452,2012-06-12T03:18Z,Public HD releases are almost always good. people please fucking seed! You can watch the crappy movie and delete it afterwards. thanks
,PyroTheGreat,2012-06-12T04:23Z,"Not quite sure yet, but I think this may be fake. It says over 20 seeders, yet I've not seen anyone with over 100% and everybody seems to be stuck on 9.9% at most. "
,PyroTheGreat,2012-06-12T04:53Z,"Yeah, pretty certain now...not moving beyond 9.9%...guess it's some kind of fake. Didn't find this release *anywhere* else either..."
,pjones452,2012-06-12T05:13Z,Public HD does not release fakes. The uploader must be asleep or something but this is real they just released the bluray rip first before encoding it and uploading it on tuesday like they usually do. But I definitely don't know why this has stopped at 9.9% its annoying as hell.
,ccCowboy,2012-06-12T06:54Z,"This is in Blu ray disc folder structure.  You can watch on Power DVD 10.  Or use a EAC3 program to combine into one mkv.  If any of this does not sound familiar you should wait for a smaller compressed copy.

I have check some of the partial files and it is ligit."
,pjones452,2012-06-12T09:16Z,the 720p copy is now available
,LAMBORGHINI39M,2012-06-12T18:44Z,can y upload it also in 1080p cee with multi audio and multi subs including greek subs and bonus disc?
,bigdrago,2012-06-12T21:44Z,"0.6kb/s

,ccCowboy,2012-06-13T01:27Z,Thank you.  Finished DL and will UL at full speed for a couple of days
,guccicar,2012-06-13T03:53Z,Stop tripping. THis is bluray quality!!!
,soletar,2012-06-13T04:23Z,"i respect you all...30G? when there are 1-3G versions everywhere? i personally have crappy bandwidth, i am just going to download 650mb version. i wish i had the kind of bandwidth you have 30G for a single movie? WTF?"
,bigdrago,2012-06-13T18:00Z,"This will be excellent for my 55"" and my 5.1 cerwin vega home cinema :D"
,bigdrago,2012-06-13T19:45Z,"Hmmm. Won't be opened in powerdvd...

,1mann,2012-06-13T21:53Z,"seed please, its been over a day now, stuck @ 80% i'm seeding full throtle."
,bigdrago,2012-06-16T00:57Z,Tried it with my multimediaplayer. Why isn't there a menu? It started with commentary track and mixed up subtitle.
,LAMBORGHINI39M,2012-06-19T09:05Z,"i will wait for the multi audio including russian audio,and multi subs including greek,russian and ukraine subs and bonus disc"
