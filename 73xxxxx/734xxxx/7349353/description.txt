This little gem is one of two episodes I recorded from the show in my younger days.
That VCR has been gone for for a long time.


If you are able to ignore the volume increasing bar in the beginning (I knew so little then) I'm sure the large fan base of Fleetwood Fanatics will enjoy this look back to the 90's when George Bush Jr. was still an unknown and DVD's had just hit the scene!

This is the story of the band Fleetwood Mac whose on/off relationships and bust ups became as famous as their music. Updated to the original episode are the final departure of Christine McVie from the band, the revised line up's new album and their ongoing determination to keep the show on the road and filling stadiums.
