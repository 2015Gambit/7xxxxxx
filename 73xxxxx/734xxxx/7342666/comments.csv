,lightrain,2012-06-10T14:44Z,"Sorry for bothering you guys but I followed all instructions and couldn't manage to run it. 
First:on c installed Rosetta Stone v3.4.7 Preinstalled
Second: DL and installed Rosetta Stone v3 Tagalog & Speech Preinstalled
Third: went to C:/Programfiles (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 and double clicked on RosettaStoneVersion3. after I did this a new window opened but no start buton available

Sorry once again if I miss something very obvious"

Does the Product Activation screen come up?
or was it just a blank gray screen with a black bar across the top?

Do this:
go to C:/Programfiles (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Rosetta Stone v3 and there is a HIDDEN file:
Tracking.db3 - delete it.
Run Rosetta Stone.
A window should come up saying it's not registered, click ""Never Register""
If this happens, you should be good to go

If it still doesn't work, TEMPORARILY DISABLE your Fire/AV software,
Run it again,

I have been plagued with this and various language packs, and haven't been able to track it down.

Let me know..."
,lightrain,2012-06-11T10:21Z,Unfortunately I can't allocate Tracking.db3 file anywhere.

,lightrain,2012-06-11T10:26Z,"Unfortunately I can't allocate Tracking.db3 file anywhere. Sorry, I meant locate. I turned off the AV and tried. It didn't work."
,lightrain,2012-06-11T12:09Z,When I try to start the program I get only blank grey screen. Can I instal more than one language course at a time?
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-11T16:13Z,"@lightrain,

This may sound like a silly question,but what is your NATIVE language?"
,lightrain,2012-06-11T21:20Z,bulgarian. why?
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-12T04:08Z,"I have set default language in the products and dynamicstoredpaths xml file as English, and I just wonder if the English default might be screwing up the install. Just a hunch.

Go to C:/Program files (x86)/Rosetta Stone and delete both of the folders and their contents
the Rosetta Stone v3 AND content folders

Then go to C:/ProgramData and delete the Rosetta Stone folder, there are two xml files.

Make sure you use this file:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe

Then DL another language (Hebrew is the smallest) and see if it installs correctly.

If it does, then I know it's the Tagalog language pack,

Lt me know..."
,lightrain,2012-06-12T08:26Z,All works now. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
,lightrain,2012-06-20T14:50Z,@EinDeutschMan: Thank you once again for the Tagalog torrent. Can you upload by any chance Bulgarian please?
