[T],rjordan21,2012-06-10T03:32Z,Thanks for the early listen.  So glad these guys are still making music.  I just wish it was more.... interesting.
,99jay88,2012-06-13T04:33Z,"Personally, I think this album is AMAZING.  I have been a Rush fan for YEARS.  I had a hard time adjusting as their sound evolved after Roll the Bones.  But I have been patient and have grown to absolutely LOVE ALL their music.  This new album has instantly grown on me.  It still think this sounds like Rush, but overall it is a lot more melodic than usual and dare I say ""mainstream"" sounding.  Nothing wrong with that, it's just interesting coming from a band that is usually anything BUT mainstream.  This is brilliant work.  If it doesn't immediately appeal to you, just keep listening.  It will grow on you."
