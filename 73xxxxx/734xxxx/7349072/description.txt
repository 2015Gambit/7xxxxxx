Ripping Note

 This wonderful record comes in a very exclusive structured fold-out cover. Only the OBI strip was missing..... Unfortunately the pictures didn't show how nice this one is made. The condition of the record is a clear mint, maybe played a couple times. After a the obligatoric standrad washing procedure on my RCM the record plays extremly quite and virtually without any clicks. (Though I found a few which I removed)
