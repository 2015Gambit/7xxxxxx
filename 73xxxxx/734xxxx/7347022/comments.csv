,anarchist9027,2012-06-13T00:45Z,Screw all these people and their scams. Go to imzdl.com (iMod Zone Download) and register there. They are a trusted source and they are not shaded at all. Check out their site. They got all the betas and you can even register for their Siri port for 5.x.x. UNLIMITED SPOTS. ALMOST INSTANT ACTIVATION
,crazedtiger,2012-06-14T06:10Z,"Hey guys, I'm selling UDID activations for $4 (USD) via PayPal. Email me at tayhaun@yahoo.com for details. I've already done many activations and have lots of slots left. It's also cheaper than a lot of other sellers and imzdl ($7) and ios6activate ($10). I reply quickly and activate as soon as I receive payment (unless I'm asleep or something)."
,w4v3m4573r,2012-06-14T22:07Z,"There's NO NEED to register your UDID, just install a CLEAN iOS 5.1.1 and register it with Apple. Then, in the LATEST iTunes (10.6.3) Hold SHIFT And press the ""Look for update""-button and choose the iOS6 .IPSW"
