Otherwise, great quality, audio and visual both pretty solid."

,spifkitten99,2012-06-12T14:36Z,Audio is way out of sync.
,hugh53,2012-06-12T23:40Z,String of out of sync videos. I wonder what is causing it. May be everyone is just off there game
,Feenixx,2012-06-12T23:42Z,"Agreed, it's out of sync on mine at the end as well. Seeing as the last episode of Eureka I got from eztv had similar sync issues, I'm beginning to wonder if this is a sign that the quality of their downloads is going downhill. "
