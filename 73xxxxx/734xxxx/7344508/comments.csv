,yuca,2012-06-10T23:56Z,Would this be the same as downloading the patch from their site and extracting it with Universal extractor?
,mickyfinnny,2012-06-11T00:08Z,"Yes the patch is the latest one,but ive included the enable button to run both the original installer and this which helps having the files in there proper respective folders."
,ido_bone,2012-06-11T00:42Z,work perfect to anybody?
,flightsimmer99,2012-06-11T02:12Z,hmm... lets be patient.
,ccgg221,2012-06-11T08:25Z,"ido_bone > this download works just as good as the Captain Sim model, however the model is not ready yet and have some serious problems being worked on. "
,ido_bone,2012-06-11T10:09Z,"ccgg221 < i mean if all the plane work find because i see in youtube thats the plane looking good for some poeple that probably buy him, what i asking that if the torrent is work because for me there is no landing gear or gauges working"
,ccgg221,2012-06-11T12:58Z,"ido_bone > This torrent is working, but not the plane. There is a lot of problems with it, discussed at lenghts at Captain Sim. Some are easily overcomed, some are not. If you want a finished model and not a beta-testing model-in-development you will have to wait until Captain Sim releases 1.0."

,Espana25,2012-06-13T19:42Z,Ridiculous plane ever as far as the cracking is concerned didn't see something promising even when there was just the exterior model available even that was ages ago now... and now this thing coming out and no promising go through so far for this plane disappointing nothing else... lets hope for a better and a solid solution for it !

,boinga,2012-06-16T19:04Z,we all can wait a bit no?:)
,Espana25,2012-06-17T17:17Z,@boinga no! we can't wait a bit now if you actually look back you would find how long this plane has been unable to reach us even when it had nothing but just an exterior to play around with this is the time we move a step forward and take matters in hands and reach out for a more positive and impacting solution to make this beautiful bird available for our great simmers out here.
,boinga,2012-06-18T18:59Z,i tottaly agree with you but let's don't rush things and give more time to everybody who want to crack the plane properly so we not have problems in the future...:) and if anybody can please crack the cs 737 ;) best wishes
