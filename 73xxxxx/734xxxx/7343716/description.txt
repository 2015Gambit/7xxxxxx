Label Sampler #11 - June 2012

Announced on 11/11/11, our eleventh sampler is now complete. The compilation process started the day we released #10 and ended just a few hours ago. This is a very large sampler, we never had 21 tracks before: #11 gathers our largest collection of previously unreleased material. We are also very proud to bring a lot of new bands into the Dead Bees family. Most of them are young and new acts, we hope you'll dig them!
