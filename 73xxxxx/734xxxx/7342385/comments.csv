,srisuk,2012-06-10T02:38Z,"Great series. Is there any way to pick and choose which files to download? Before there was a separate selection where you could check which files to download. Now when I click ""get this torrent"" it just shows one choice for the entire download. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
