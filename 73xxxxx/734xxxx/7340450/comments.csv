,smegma123,2012-09-06T19:28Z,Don't know how this was ripped but thank you soo much. It's decoding to DTS surround on my Pioneer. Sounds incredible.  
,marcus100868,2012-09-07T14:24Z,I use twonky media to stream to my oppo bdp-95 or i burn file to disc then play with my oppo again and it plays it dts hd master that's why i reckon oppo bluray players are the best they will play just about any file.Smegma123 if you have got VLC player on your pc play the file right click to get the audio setting click audio then audio track and should show you Lossless (English).What pioneer player are you using?
