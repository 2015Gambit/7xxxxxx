appreciate you taking the time to provide the torrent for all of us but next time could you not put the score in the title because a lot of people like to watch the game without knowing what the end result is.

Thanks."

Don't you think at all!?
Your torrent shows up in the search list smartass...
Your mode of torrenting should be forbidden! actually it's common knowledge all over and to be honest i'm quite surprised they let you load up such torrent at all. If one wants to see only goals one can watch the news, put up your torrents (goals) after the tournament!
So no appreciation of whatsoever :("
