This is the COMPLETE text book used by community and technical colleges to train students from A to Z on HVAC and Refrigeration Systems!  It doesn't get any more thorough than this.


ATTENTION: REQUESTING A CRACKED COPY OF HVAC-CALC RESIDENTIAL / COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN VIRUSES!  A COPY WAS RELEASED BY TSRH - BUT HAS SINCE BEEN LACED WITH A TROJAN.  IF ANY LEFT OVER MEMBERS OF TSRH WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO UPLOAD THEIR ORIGINAL CLEAN CRACKED COPY OF HVAC-CALC RESIDENTIAL / COMMERCIAL IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED AND I WILL SEED!
