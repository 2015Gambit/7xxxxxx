Episode 10

Series Information:

 A teacher who has just transferred into Seishou Academy soon finds himself in the hospital. This is not surprising, considering his students are assault rifles! Kitsune Tennouji of EDEN'S BOwY fame returns after 16 years with a surprising military comedy featuring attractive girls who are actually anthropomorphized guns! The girls are given special characteristics and personalities to match their gun types, and they spend their school days with a firearm in one hand, running rampant and occasionally shooting a boost of energy into their school life!
