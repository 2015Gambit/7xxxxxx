Red Faction takes place on Mars in the late 21st century. The player controls a miner named Parker who helps lead a rebellion against the Ultor Corporation. The premiere feature of the game is its "Geo-Mod" technology, short for "geometry modification", which provided destructible environments, allowing the player to destroy certain sections of the scenery in the game. For example, instead of opening a door, a player could blast through the rock surrounding the door.

This is my extract and play version, which has been patched to 1.3, and had the PureFaction added to enable modern PCs to play the game.

I have included Xpadder with profiles for the Xbox360, and PS3 controllers.

I advise launching the game initially via the PFLauncher first to setup your video settings, etc.

Read the README-TO-PLAY text file before launching, and enjoy this FPS classic.

Scanned with Comodo IS, and compressed with 7zip.
