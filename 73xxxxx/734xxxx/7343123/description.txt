[MilfSugarBabes.] Juelz Ventura (20.04.2012)


My marriage used to be fun. My husband and I used to go out and have a good time, go to bars, get tattoos, go shopping. But ever since he was laid off we've haven't really been able to do anything. Until I met Rocco. Whenever Rocco's has time, I make time. Because Rocco knows how to take care of me. Shopping, fun, bills -- anything. He takes care of all of thatΓÇªand I take care of him, in whichever way he pleases. In the end, I'm actually helping out my marriage, because we need this money. I'm still cool with my husband, and I still love him. But I've got to do what I've got to do.
