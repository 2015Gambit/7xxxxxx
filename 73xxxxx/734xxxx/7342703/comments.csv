I'm just curious how your crf19 torrents of the X-Files compares to the MMI release? They do 550 MB per episode for the first two seasons and then 700 MB for the rest. When I compare bitrates, theirs are usually higher than 2k, while yours are lower. They use L3.0 though, while you use L3.1, which I know yields superior quality. I already have the MMI release, but wonder if I should replace it with your rips if they are better quality (for less space)?

I have the same question for your DS9 and VOY rips as compared to the freesideSD rips. They use 2.2k bitrates, yielding file sizes around 850 MB per episode, but are they higher quality than your 550 MB rips? I just don't know - and would like an expert's opinion on the matter.

Thanks in advance for any insights you can provide!"

I'm not familiar with the releases you are mentioning, but I can tell you that crf19 produces very high quality rips, almost indistinguishable from the original video.  Bitrate is not always the best indicator of how good the quality will be.  Higher bitrate does not necessarily mean higher quality video.  Crf guarantees a certain quality.  So...you will see the same constant quality of crf 19 in each of the x-file rips, regardless of bitrate.  Some videos need higher bitrate than others (which is why you will see a varying file size within the same season).  Choosing a constant bitrate (or size...same thing), wastes bits/size on some videos that don't need it and may not use enough for others.  Crf is smarter and will set the bitrate automatically to achieve a certain quality that you specify.  Now, the x264 options have a lot to do with size and quality as well.  ""Higher"" x264 options can produce better quality video and mostly provides better compression.  So...you could set the crf at 19 and weak x264 settings, and produce, for ex., a 700mb file.  Or you could turn the settings way up, and produce a 500mb file at the same quality.  I pretty much max out most of the settings, so I achieve the crf 19 at some of the lowest file sizes possible."
[V],meech,2012-06-12T23:01Z,"As far as the DS9 and VOY rips, I can tell you that 850mb per ep doesn't seem to sound right at all.  Either they didn't use good x264 settings, losing compression, so they had to set a higher bitrate/size to achieve a certain quality, or they are just wasting space.  Before I used crf, I used a constant file size (my Star Trek rips, etc.).  And this is how I came up with the particular size for those rips.  First I would rip a handful episodes at crf 18 and see what file sizes that produced.  The file sizes wouldn't vary too too much from each other.  I would take an average of those sizes and rip all eps at that size.  So if I had used a crf, it would have been just about crf18.  However, I wasted space on some episodes that didn't need that size and there may have been a few that needed to be larger.  That's why I switched to using only crf.  No need to experiment, or guess what bitrate/size you should choose.  You shouldn't see much difference, if any, with my 550mb rips and their 850mb rips.  After a certain point, the eye can't distinguish any more difference.  That's why nobody uses crf15.  Sure it would wind up producing a higher bitrate, but it wouldn't look much better than crf19.  Also, I am assuming that they are including the ac3 dolby digital 5.1 audio.  I always use that for my rips, if available.  That takes up a little extra space than say crappy 2-channel mp3 audio.

You don't have to download the whole torrent.  You could always download a couple of episodes and compare them on a large screen t.v.  I am indeed a quality nut...quality over quantity is what I say.  But no need to go crazy on the quantity if the quality doesn't require it.  I think you will like my rips just fine.  However, you'll have to make up your own mind on that.

Hope that helps.  Let me know if you need any further clarification.  "
,BenBarker,2012-06-16T09:40Z,"Thanks for your replies. They were very helpful. I will stick to the releases you provide.

I understand from previous posts that you are not a fan of Babylon 5 and therefore do not plan to make a high quality release of the show. I think that would be a shame since you have done so many of the concurrent sci-fi shows. It is an important show with a solid fan base, and at the moment there is nothing I would like more than to get a quality release of that franchise (Babylon 5, Crusade, and the TV movies).

If you don't have access to the original NTSC DVDs, I can try and find them somewhere online for you. Just in case you it would make a difference. :) Thanks again for all your work!"
