,Saming,2012-06-12T20:30Z,"Also, please seed so that more people can download the files."
,lordquad,2012-06-12T22:42Z,But why would I want to install this? Aren't the voices there already?
,Saming,2012-06-12T23:14Z,"I imagine it's for people who only have voices in their language or something else but can't have the original english voices, which have a pretty good quality.

I've already seen RUS or DE versions with higher seeds than the EN version."

,FrFox,2012-06-13T11:28Z,"Waaa ? It's my upload, and I've upload this mostly for my friends.
Sure, if you already have the english voice that's fine, but if you have... hum.. say: a French steam version AND you don't want to re-DL ALL the game only for 2 files, this torrent is for you."
,Shadroze,2012-08-21T18:11Z,Well Im probably late to ask but will this work with Dawnguard and the newest 1.7 update?
,Dave92,2012-09-08T16:20Z,thanks sooooooooooooooo much!!!
