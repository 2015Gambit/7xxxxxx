,aarque,2012-06-13T05:02Z,"JUAUZYNHU- please consider the value of running a search before you upload the exact same thing other people have:
http://thepiratebay.se/search/fsx%20baron/0/3/0
Please be kind enough to read the comments as it explains why duplicate torrents hurt The Pirate Bay and disrespect the original uploaders.

Thanks!"

,Manhole45,2012-06-15T02:33Z,"You will find Juauzynhu, that aarque is a sort of troll.  A know it all, a""I have to be the police of the piratebay"" user.   Best to ignore him.

Thanks for the torrent!  This plane is awesome."
,aarque,2012-06-15T05:14Z,"Thank you for considering to read the comments on the other torrents. Obviously, by recommending to, ""not download if already have,"" you see no issue with multiple torrents. Cool. I like that I have 3 year old torrents that are still active. It makes me feel like I provide value to this community. If mickyfinny uploaded the B58 (he did) and you uploaded it, and I uploaded it, and manhole uploaded it (it would be his first torrent, but who's counting) and 27 other people uploaded the B58, then all the other pirates that come here to leech and write derogatory comments won't know (or care) which torrent swarm to leech/seed. 90% of them would come, maybe write something stupid, then leave. So with few, if any seeders, all the torrents die. That is a formidable way one can demonstrate disrespect for the original uploader."
,Juauzynhu_FSX,2012-06-16T17:29Z,"aarque: but im dont ""reuploading"" a dowloaded mickyfinny. i download her torrent and not worked...

And youre correct! I'll be careful from now.

Thanks and good downloads man"
