,tdiamante,2012-06-13T03:53Z,"would not install on my mid 2011 MBP
errored out"
,ShazaamShazaam,2012-06-13T07:49Z,"To prevent an install error you need to first copy the DP 4 installer to a drive, not just launch it from the disc image."
,downloaditfreenow,2012-06-13T12:00Z,Mac OS X Mountain Lion Developer Preview 4 is already here : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7347678/OS_X_Mountain_Lion_10.8_DP4
,sisiphus1,2012-06-13T12:44Z,"thanks a lot.
has anyone find any issue with app store app?
i can not log in but  only on DP4...it seems it is blocked for non developers."
,lfla,2012-06-13T17:26Z,"I have installed it from the scratch.... Worked well including AppStore..... 

Note... (Mid 2011 MBP)"
,escalade83,2012-06-13T22:14Z,"""This Apple ID has not purchased Lion.

You must sign in with an Apple ID that was used to purchase Lion.""

This sucks, because my MBA came with Lion so obviously I didn't purchase it."
,escalade83,2012-06-13T22:22Z,"I'm getting this:

""This Apple ID has not purchased Lion.""

My MBA came with Lion, any way around this?"
,christich99,2012-06-13T23:10Z,"When I try to install (I already moved it to my Mac's  Applications folder), it ask me to put in my App Store password, I do, then it returns the message ""This Apple ID has not purchased Lion"" When I'm running Mountain Lion DP 3. I just wanna use Dictation already!"
,Yamcha67,2012-06-14T00:01Z,"Thanks for share, I can confirm this is working on my PC (Hackintosh).. The new UI looks amazing on Developer Preview 4.. "
,phillipm,2012-06-14T03:29Z,"So, I take it this isn't considered GM yet, right? Do you think the final will add anything not already here? 

If one DOES decide to install this, will it be updatable to Final? Or will I have to do a clean install again?"
,phunkeymonkie,2012-06-15T07:37Z,The preview is working fine. Although my Finder keeps popping up every now and then showing my HDD.
,philk30,2012-06-16T05:01Z,Cumon people....1.2 Mbs. Could i get at least to 1.8. There is a reason I pay for Comcast and thats for torrent power. 
,vitor.fernandes1983,2012-06-16T09:24Z,"Everything is working perfectly, been using for a few day, clean installation through usb. Thank you for this."
,lfla,2012-06-16T23:15Z,"Now you guys can download the facebook integration for Mountain Lion DP4.... this is the link:

,pgrif,2012-06-17T09:45Z,"How do you get around the Apple confirmation problem? It attempts to install but stops when my Macbook talks to Apple.
I tried turning off wi-fi but the install just quits.
Thanks."
,Default_GIU,2012-06-18T13:16Z,"Yes it works! Make shure you to open up the disk image (.dmg), then open up Disk Utilities and create on you're own hard drive or external disk (recommended) and make shure you create 2 EXTRA partitions. One for the operating system and one to install the OS and make that no less then 7 Gb. Click to restore in disk utilities, drag the installation partition to the output and obviously the INSTALESD as source. After that just reboot the mac, when you hear the ""starting mac sound"" hold the option key and select the installation partition. YOU WONT SEE THE PARTITION WHERE YOU WOULD ADD MOUNTAIN LION YET, so select the install partition and just follow the steps on your screen and ofcours make shure to select the proper disk where you like to add Mountain Lion. After installation, press option key and select the mountain lion disk and here you go...."
,Default_GIU,2012-06-18T13:20Z,"Oh yes and guys, the change for succeed the installation is pretty much 0 if you do it as usual. You really need to do it as explain above.
Thanks for the upload lfla ! :)"
,inalcanzable,2012-06-18T20:35Z,Please seed thanks.
,moocow45,2012-06-19T08:18Z,"Default_GIU has it all right. It works like a charm with their instructions. Do make sure to make two partitions -- you can't install on the same partition that you restore the installer to. Overall works like a charm, more refined than lion in many ways. "
,izgvt,2012-06-20T04:48Z,"No problems at all: just downloaded, mounted the image and clicked on install. It even updates with appstore. Thanks to the uploader!"
,Viktorlsn,2012-06-20T23:27Z,"works great, thank you !"
,mariojuniorjp,2012-06-21T05:15Z,Thank you so much!
,smarti007,2012-06-21T19:20Z,"hey  i have problem with , has this copy a special root password ? username ? i can't find right always say worn password


gretting"
,maxod,2012-06-25T01:18Z,"I'm having some trouble.  If I run the installer it says something like ""cannot install to main drive"" (installing to boot drive), and running from a partition I restored the dmg to I get a ""unable to load driver for this platform: ACPI"" kernel panic (running a hackintosh PC :) )

Any ideas?"
,t0rus,2012-06-27T06:35Z,"can anyone check how external monitors work with mountain lion when an app is in FULL SCREEN mode? is it same bug as in lion, all other screens get blanked out?"
,drmpshr,2012-06-29T03:02Z,"downloaded, put in application folder, ran installer.  Installed without issue."
,wolfskull7,2012-07-04T11:00Z,"Can I or will I be able to just install this over my Lion on my macbook pro? I just want to be able to install this over my current version not do any partitioning of my hard drive. 

I bought my Macbook pro last year in june and its up to date.

Will this mess up my macbook, or will I be ok and can update and all that later?"
,nysegop,2012-07-04T21:18Z,Will this mess up my computer? I don't want to create a partition.
