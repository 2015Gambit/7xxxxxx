See & hear how audio engineer Anthony Iannucci recorded the legendary jazz pianist, Dave Brubeck! This tutorial shows you how to mic and record pianos!

Dave Brubeck is a jazz icon. So when we combined him with seasoned audio engineer, Anthony Iannucci, we came up with a solo piano recording tutorial that will reveal piano recording techniques that were, until now, the secrets of the pros!

Recording solo piano, especially with a virtuoso like Dave Brubeck at the keyboard, is a delicate and exacting task. Everything has to be perfect. The room has to sound just right. The piano has to be placed correctly in the room. The piano itself must meet the artistΓÇÖs exacting standards and be tuned and regulated to perfection. Then thereΓÇÖs the microphones ΓÇª What kind do you use? Where do you place them? How many mics are required to get the sound youΓÇÖre after? Then follows the pre-amps, EQs, DAW. And (letΓÇÖs not forget) mixing and mastering!
