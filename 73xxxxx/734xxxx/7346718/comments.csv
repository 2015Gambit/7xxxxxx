,Wizxon,2012-06-12T05:25Z,"I'll start off by saying I have downloaded all your previous episodes you've uploaded of The Legend of Korra, and it's all been A:10 V:10.

And I wanted to comment about your 1080p test run.

There are a number of reasons why I believe you should stick to 720p.

First of all, file size. This episode was ridiculously big, at 1.76GB for a half hour episode.

Secondly, it's a cartoon. You really can't see the difference between 1080p and 720p like you can in live action films.

Thirdly, download speed. It took much longer to get this episode for not even noticeable difference.

As you said don't comment and say anything about video slowdowns, but I did have trouble streaming it over my media server. But that's because it's 1080p over my wireless connection, so this isn't a real complaint but something I personally didn't enjoy since the 720p and 1080p for TLoK is the same.

But, thank you for the uploads and high quality! I will continue to download and seed your torrents of TLoK.

Hope my feedback helped in any way shape or form.

[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-12T07:14Z,"Thanks for your Opinion Tho, You wont get the best out of this Video unless you watch it on a 1080p monitor.  like a  40+ inch TV, 
You can Watch it Via USB/Ps3/Xbox "
