Check out their site. They got all the betas and you can even register for their Siri port for 5.x.x. UNLIMITED SPOTS. ALMOST INSTANT ACTIVATION
,speghead,2012-06-13T09:41Z,don't give anyone your money for this.. you can use ios 6 beta for free.. no developer crap needed.. just search youtube it works
,crazedtiger,2012-06-14T06:47Z,"Hey guys, I'm selling UDID activations for $4 (USD) via PayPal. Email me at tayhaun@yahoo.com for details. I've already done many activations and have lots of slots left. It's also cheaper than a lot of other sellers and imzdl ($7) and ios6activate ($10). I reply quickly and activate as soon as I receive payment (unless I'm asleep or something)."
,w4v3m4573r,2012-06-14T22:03Z,"There's NO NEED to register your UDID, just install a CLEAN iOS 5.1.1 and register it with Apple. Then, in the LATEST iTunes (10.6.3) Hold SHIFT And press the ""Look for update""-button and choose the iOS6 .IPSW"
,teds23,2012-06-14T23:58Z,"You do need to register your UDID, any workarounds will leave you with a device that can become deactivated at any moment. Doing the update as stated above will not perform a clean install and can lead to crashes. Also, you will not be able to use the new betas that will be out in a week or so. I registered my UDID with ios6udidactivations.com. They are fast, usually register within 45 seconds"
