,andy20095,2012-06-09T21:26Z,"I don't understand why are you uploading aircrafts,
that don't have gauges or aren't cracket.

REQ:CS 717"
,robspeed1,2012-06-09T23:03Z,lol @ someone ^ who can complain about an upload (after micky explained why) and have no shame in requesting something else at the same... gotta love the internet
,MrPieGH,2012-06-09T23:10Z,"@andy20095
I can't believe how retarded you are, you should feel bad for existing

He uploads it so other people can try to crack it

Kindly requesting the CS 737 and the updated 727"
,flightsimmer99,2012-06-09T23:28Z,Can you upload the QWSIM BAe 146 for FS9? Thank you!
,mickyfinnny,2012-06-10T01:44Z,"Just discovered that you can use an ""enable button""(MaximK@mail.ru)to install this properly.Still no landing gear or gauges though."
,mickyfinnny,2012-06-10T17:39Z,Just found out that The update from the 8th June says that there are Gauges missing in order to make it work(csx772_0200).What a disaster this one has turned out to be!!!

,020398,2012-06-12T02:02Z,"Hey Bro. I cant open the file. Is it possible you can just upload the installer instead of putting it in a file ? Because when I right click and click on properties it just says "" file "". Can you just upload the installer or put it in a WinRar folder please ? Or if anybody can send the installer to me ? That would be great. I f you would like to send it to me, please send it to my e-mail.
