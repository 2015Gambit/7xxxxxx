,DaGimp13,2012-06-10T23:08Z,"movieboy, it's much appreciated you uploading this, however the aspect ratio seems to be off, and I get either black bars at top & bottom, or pixelation when zoomed in so it appears more normal for 16:9.  is there anyway you could re-rip/convert these to height:360 x width:640?"
,movieboy_5280,2012-06-12T11:40Z,"I did my best.

And to all who are ready to bitch...

The entire series was a gift for my Dad.

Father's day was approaching fast and I had to take what I could get.

This is the messed up MKV version that was out of sync by almost 30 seconds and also the only one available at the time

,GeekHillbilly,2012-06-12T20:30Z,"Thanks,but using VLC it is out of sync"
,Speechless1998,2012-06-25T18:15Z,"They're are out of sync because movieboy's computer is playing them that way and he's realigning them to play on his gear hence they're playing out of sync for everyone else. There's nothing wrong with the 1920 x 1080 Matroska files at the link he's posted except they're all ripped into one humongous file.
Also the proper order (from newest to oldest) is here... http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-universe/episodes/288034
The producer's of the original BluRay they came from have the episodes slightly mixed up."

,movieboy_5280,2012-07-07T07:22Z,"U R DEAD ASS WRONG reedski.

Others had renamed it.
I've been following this series since it began but I guess twits need proof so here:

,asmodeus130,2012-07-08T09:45Z,"Have you fixed the audio sync yet?

,movieboy_5280,2012-07-09T16:07Z,"Yes it's fixed.
