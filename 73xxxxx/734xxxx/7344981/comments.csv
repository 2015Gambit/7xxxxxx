,mikeos2,2012-06-11T16:49Z,Yes. great first episode. So good to see a new location. Makes a refreshing change from boring old New York.

,Bongborg,2012-07-11T02:59Z,"It may be that .mkv files do suck...
but this is a .mp4

Either figure out how to update your codecs or learn about VLC player, people. 
Whiny comments suck."
