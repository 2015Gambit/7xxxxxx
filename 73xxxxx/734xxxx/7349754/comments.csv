,arkoth0,2012-09-01T00:45Z,"well of course I don't expect this 1.85Gb 1080p be as good as a 10Gb 1080p BUT WOW! The quality is..incredibly outstanding for this tiny size!
I usually watch 720p movies but when I see a YIFI 1080p..I go for it :)
Thanks bro"

Video:100/10
Audio:10/10 (despite being stereo it's quite good)
M:100/10"
