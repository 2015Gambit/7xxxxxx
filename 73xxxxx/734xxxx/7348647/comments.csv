,snowdog1,2012-06-13T07:55Z,"Yes, one sub-title promo at the start for a few seconds.  Like a lot of cams, some dark sections (not much), cam movement (not too bad), definition (not perfect but quite ok) & missing the final few seconds (not much).  More than good enough for the kids - A/V ratings vary too much for some people. A good early release by mkvfilms.net, thanx"
