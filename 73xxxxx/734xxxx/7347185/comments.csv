Thank you for the upload! Seeding at the speed of sound"
,skoumoun,2012-06-14T17:08Z,This movie is actually really awesome ! :D
,JPHawk57,2012-06-27T05:35Z,You Know there is one thing that has been bothering me. The human eye can see 30 Frames per Second or 30 fps yet almost all these rips are below 30 fps at 23.976 fps which is way below 30 fps and means there is flicker which can cause headaches and etc. I may be incorrect but you may as well use a VHS quality at these fps rips. It seems that at this present fps they are providing us that there is no excuse for a file this large since the less fps the less quality which should translate to way less size of the video files? Like I said I may be wrong but I do not think so from what I have learned. So my question is why is this so? I am not trying to downgrade anyone. I am just wondering why the fps are so low below 30 fps with most of these rips?

I have been noticing this with all the rips from various people and teams. It is a very disturbing trend going on here of late on TPB."

BluRay and in fact virtually all HD content is typically produced at 24fps these days because somebody decided that audiences prefer the ""cinematic feel"" of the flicker.

I personally hate it too.  60fps would be preferable, then 55fps/hz, then 30...  120 or above is typical for viewing with 60fps active shutter 3D glasses. (speaking of flicker)

In general I feel that modern formats offer nothing to the consumer:

Touchscreens? Sure, except they're filthy and haven't worked properly since they quit using resistive touch.

3D active shutter glasses? Sure, watch a $2000 60 inch LCD using electronic glasses that cost $40-100 per person instead of watching two $600 160inch projectors using polarized glasses that cost $4-10 per person and never require charging.

HDMI? I'll take ""VGA cable"" (15pin Dsub) sending 1600x1200 @120hz and Coax/SPDIF/Dolby (RCA) audio and 5.1 digital surround sound, thanks.  What is better about HDMI?

If you want a digital video connector that's better than HDMI, consider SDI:

,Saerain,2012-08-11T11:55Z,It has nothing to do with the rips. Most movies are shot at 24fps.
