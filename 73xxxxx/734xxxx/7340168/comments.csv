Now that EURO is at the same time as Formula 1 I can count on you to upload the race. Normally I would watch the race live, but Croatia is playing, so this thank you is coming from Croatia

Man, when someone uploads some awesome stuff, in my book that's love!


And, just wondering, will you be uploading full matches? Because I'm curious how other commentators cover it and stuff"
