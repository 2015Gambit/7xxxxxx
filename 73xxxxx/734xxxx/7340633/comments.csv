,jumjumb,2012-06-09T23:22Z,"Works fine with the application of Macmaverick under MacOSLion. 

Thanks Maverick  ....."
,macmaverickk,2012-06-10T07:55Z,"My name's not even Maverick! lol

You're welcome anyway :)"
,bulb14,2012-06-10T16:01Z,"Hi, Torrent downloaded fast but i'm having trouble loading this onto my mac. I can't see any 'iso' files, just 'rsd' files that won't open under Data and Speech. Please help!"
,booque,2012-06-11T00:39Z,"When I add the language levels to Rosetta Stone, it asks for an activation code. I followed the instructions in this torrent and the Rosetta Stone v3.4.5 [K'ed] for Mac, including copying the dat file to the Resources folder before running it (there wasn't anything there to replace). I did not update or register. Can you think of anything I might have done wrong?"
,darrow18,2012-06-11T00:49Z,Swedish please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,macmaverickk,2012-06-12T10:13Z,"Activation code: 
xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx

Phone activation code:
1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111

Yes, that is correct... All x's for the activ. code and all 1's for the phone activ. code.

YOU WILL USE THE SAME CODES FOR ALL LANGUAGE PACK INSTALLATIONS IF ASKED!!!"
,TectonicProductions,2012-06-13T02:59Z,"I entered all x's for the activation code. Im using the latest OSX on my Mac and it says the ""Activation ID not recognized""

a little assistance macmaverickk"
,bulb14,2012-06-13T03:22Z,"So when I open the iso files your instructions say ""then go open Rosetta Stone"" - how do I do this? All that happens is a finder box opens with files labeled 'data' 'documentation' 'languages' and 'speech'. Sorry if this is a dumb question but i'm not much of a computer genius, please help!!"
,TectonicProductions,2012-06-13T03:40Z,"bulb14.... if you've downloaded the actual Rosetta Stone application, also provided by macmaverickk, all you do is go to your applications folder and open the program. The program will prompt to install a language. from there it will show all the ISOs youve mounted. Just install one at a time"
,TectonicProductions,2012-06-13T04:24Z,figured it out. all i had to do is follow the crack info. Thanks mac!
,bulb14,2012-06-13T06:02Z,"Thanks so much TectonicProductions, the actual app was what I was missing, obviously a pretty important part! Everything is working fine now, thanks macmaverickk"
,cmptrluvr,2012-06-13T14:36Z,"What happened to the French Language torrent???
See if you can upload TOTALe (v4) for German and French...
Also can u upload TELL ME MORE GERMAN latest version???"
,macmaverickk,2012-06-14T09:07Z,"There was an issue with it, I couldn't seed it anymore, but Im reuploading right now, along with other requested languages. "
,LimaMike12,2012-06-15T01:40Z,Any chance you can upload the french one?!
,Niree1978,2012-06-15T06:50Z,"Awesome! I already have the language pack, been looking for the app."
,Markg33,2012-06-15T21:50Z,"This is not working for me. I was stopped on lesson 3, and it would not let me continue unless I entered an activation code. I entered Xs for the activation, but it's an invalid code. HELP!!"
,Markg33,2012-06-15T21:53Z,did my post just get deleted...?? well after lesson 3 on  the first level it started asking me for a activation code. Xs did not work. Any solutions for this Macmaverickk?
,macmaverickk,2012-06-16T22:05Z,"Just turn your internet connection off - turn off airport or dsl/cable - just pull the cord out for the installation. Follow the directions, exactly! (Use Little Snitch if you have it, but it is not NEEDED if you don't already have it)

They are not 1's & X's for the heck of it, the number of 1's is also NOT random, you can't copy paste (at least I couldn't) but type it in exactly as described and it will work. Activate them and your done, enjoy RS w/o paying out the A$$!


Activation code: 
xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx

Phone activation code:
1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111"
,Markg33,2012-06-18T08:08Z,GAH! still not working. I followed the instructions exactly as you stated. I mean the instructions is not super complicated... I have rosetta stone version 3.4.5 could this be the problem? When I enter the 1111s for the phone number activation it just keeps telling me that an error has occurred. I really don't know what I am doing wrong. I also did you what you about unplugging my modem... it still didn't work. Any other suggestions? 
,nmc300,2012-06-19T00:14Z,"Hi. I was wondering if we would be seeing possibly a Rosetta Stone Mandarin or Swedish or (Even The Best) RUSSIAN

I would LOVE some Russian RS

Thanks, Noah"
,missfendibag,2012-06-19T18:09Z,I didn't have to put an activation code anywhere but it launched R/S. The only problem I have is that it is having a defect with recognizing my voice. It is coming out choppy. I double checked to make sure my mac microphone is working and it is. Anyone having this problem? Or know what I can do?
,arturbmw,2012-06-19T20:06Z,"Hey, im having the same problem as bulb14 was having... I downloaded this 2.01gb torrent.. theres something else that i need to download? The ""Rosetta Stone application"" where can i find that?"
,nik1181,2012-06-20T03:57Z,Level 4 & 5 of both the Spanish and Italian can not be found by Rosetta stone.  I get an error for those.  I read on a forum to unmount using Toast titanium but that didn't work either.
,superhawk610,2012-06-22T03:26Z,"arturbmw: you need to download this torrent, also from macmaverickk => http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7337333/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.5_[K_ed]_for_Mac

it is the actual Rosetta Stone application, this 2.01 GB file is just the language packs :)"
,QBall70,2012-06-23T14:16Z,"People ... this isn't hard.  If you have a Mac, then you should already know how to mount .dmg's.  Use your brains, for crying out loud.

You will need to first install the Rosetta Stone application in order to use these languages.  macmaverickk provides you with clear, concise, and easy-to-follow instructions.

If you can't follow the instructions - and do EXACTLY as he says to do - then you stupid fuckers deserve the problems you're encountering.

IT WORKS.  PERIOD.  "
,Dastewe,2012-06-23T23:23Z,"So, I've been following all the instructions to the letter but when I get to the adding in the phone code when verifying languages I keep getting an error. I know on one of the torrents you or someone said to keep trying and I have but, it's just banging my head against the wall. So, am I in that sad group of people whom this won't work for or what should I do next. Reinstall and try again or?"
,ravenxfruit,2012-06-24T01:46Z,"Hi Maverick, I know I'm just joining the rest when I say this but I cannot figure what I'm doing wrong. In your instructions you say REPLACE the existing .dat file but there isn't one to replace. I'm thinking this is where we all might be going wrong? I have followed every other step to the T and still activation and phone codes are not working. Help a girl out please!"
,amaggard,2012-06-24T03:50Z,"GUYS. i created an account on piratebay for the sole purpose of telling you all why the crack isn't working for the activation codes. at least, why mine wasn't working. i was copying mdm.dat and pasting it into the resources folder of the package that was in the SAME folder as the readme document. there was no option to replace. what you actually have to do is open a new finder window, navigate to rosetta stone in applications, right click ""show package contents"" and then resources, and paste it there. this time it will replace another mdm.dat file. it worked for me after that, and the xxxx activation codes were valid. i don't know if this is the same reason that you all were having trouble, but i thought it was worth sharing. good luck!"
,Dastewe,2012-06-24T04:43Z,I doubt that's the mistake that I was making as I have been copying the .dat to the folder inside the already installed application.
,amaggard,2012-06-24T05:22Z,"update: mine still says the codes are invalid if i go to ""activate products"" and enter the xxxxx codes for the five levels. nothing is listed under ""activated products,"" but i still have all the content and it works as it is supposed to, as far as i can tell. one difference i noticed was that when i copied the mdm.dat file properly, i was prompted to create a user account on first opening the program, while when it was copied improperly, the 'add language' screen came up first. dastewe, have you tried skipping activation and creating a user account? "
,Dastewe,2012-06-24T05:35Z,"I'll try but as you said it works correctly when it asks for a user account FIRST where for me it just goes to activation where I get the errors. I can make a user account but, I reckon, I'll just end up getting the limited version that you can get w/o activating it."
,ravenxfruit,2012-06-24T18:54Z,YES!! Thank you amaggard!!
,danieleleven,2012-06-24T20:15Z,i downloaded rosetta stone 3.3.5 and when i try to install the spanish level 4 it says i need an update to rosetta stone?  Any suggestions?
,Dastewe,2012-06-26T01:17Z,"amaggard, I'll just go forth and hope it works. Though now that I seem to have properly copied it it just says a minor error occuurred when i activate not the ""Won't Activate"""
,aus_girl,2012-07-03T17:49Z,Any chance of the Spanish (Spain) language package?
,nmc300,2012-07-06T02:54Z,Russian? Please comment no if it is never going to happen.
,nmc300,2012-07-06T04:22Z,Farsi would be better than Russian but nobody has that :(
,nmc300,2012-07-06T16:34Z,"Requires ""Activation Code"" to get all levels? Help!!!"
,alexnoons,2012-07-07T17:58Z,"hey macmaverickk, i tried the 1111 thing but rosetta stone doesnt let me write the ones.... any chance you know how to get around the activation code??"
,willyum101,2012-07-11T07:48Z,"OK, I have done everything in the instructions. Downloaded the torrent, downloaded Daemon Tool Pro but I really do not know what to do from there. I know how to download torrents for movies and music but never have done anything like this. I have a PC, so if anyone could help me out I would really appreciate it."
,PlAyEd-YoU,2012-07-12T06:22Z,"macmaverickk, or anyone else who's successfully registered... I can't get the XXXX  or 1111 to work. Everything else worked fine, thanks macmaverickk much appreciated"
,ssomer1,2012-07-26T07:49Z,Thank you so much mac. I was having problems because i was throwing the original mdm.dat file in the trash and then adding the cracked dat file. You have to drag the cracked file & replace the old one. Or at least that's what finally worked for me. 
,stan1ten,2012-08-07T10:09Z,"Brilliant mate, thanks a ton!"
,SmokinOnPurple,2012-08-07T21:44Z,"Got it to work extremely easy. Only problems are when I speak into the mic, my voice is chopped up which defeats the purpose. Other problem is (unless it's meant to be like this) I'm being quizzed on words before I learn them. Overall, thanks macmaverickk!!"
,randall5434,2012-08-09T04:59Z,I have downloaded RS program opens and I am able to use it but not to it's entirety. I tried entering in the codes for activation the exact way they were presented and for the phone activation but it keeps telling me that an error has occurred. I tried doing it with my internet shut off as well and same results. Can someone fix this problem for me? I have a Mac if that might make a difference in the response.
,akaireves,2012-08-22T20:56Z,"People, please read instructions that come with download...this isn't like downloading movies or music. 

Works great, thank you! I appreciate uploading this for MAC, since I've switched from Windows, there aren't as many torrents for Macs (naturally, I mean we're so snobby we pay for everything legally anyway right?).

I didn't have DiskImage Mounter, but the Disk Utility worked perfectly. Thanks again."
,JakeRiederer,2012-08-23T19:10Z,"the ""XXXXX"" thing isn't working, the whole thing was really well explained except for this part. Does anybody know any tips on how to fix it? You can only get up to lesson 3 on each level and then it requires a key code. Please help??"
,tcarlblom,2012-08-26T23:25Z,Yeah...the xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx activation code doesn't work. The 1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111 phone activation doesn't work either. I'm not retarded...i don't think. Anyone else get this to work recently after successfully going through the first two lessons? Lesson three is wanting the activation code and its not accepting what is posted here.
,DevilDog123,2012-09-01T01:13Z,"Okay I downloaded this torrent using uTorrent. Now what? I've tried clicking on all the folders and opening them and I cant run it. I tried opening them through iTunes, quicktime player, everything! What do I do?? I just wanna learn a damn language without paying 700 dollars.."
,theilliad,2012-09-01T14:22Z,"Can't get the activation codes to work either. 
Any solutions?"
,alejandro1212,2012-09-05T04:23Z,"Spanish levels 4 & 5 require program update?

Levels 1-3 installed and ran fine. 4 & 5, of various D/L's here, both Latin American and Spain, won't install without this update. What/where is this update? I see no torrents here. Thanks."
,michaelstao,2012-09-06T23:43Z,Will this work with purchased version
,acook104,2012-09-07T09:13Z,"Downloaded this 09/02/12 (on Mac 10.7.4), and it's working perfectly! Quick download, clear instructions, and easy install. Thank you so much :)"
,arturbmw,2012-09-10T06:25Z,"Hi, im still having a problem with finding the ""Rosetta Stone application"" for windows. I have already downloaded this torrent, but just need the application. Can someone please post the link to it? Thank you! :)"
,rcn22,2012-09-17T22:52Z,finished lessons 1 & 2 but the activation codes don't work. Any help/suggestions?? thanks
