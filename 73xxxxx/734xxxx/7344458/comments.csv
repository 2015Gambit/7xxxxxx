,mwyoung,2012-06-12T11:27Z,"""You Can View The Title List By Clicking On Files On The Upper Left Hand Corner""

What are you talking about bigbluesea?
There is NOTHING to ""Click on"" to see the details of this torrent in the corner...

If I click on the ""Files: 150"", it simply brings me to this torrent--which does not tell me what books are in the torrent.

Please explain this to the obviously stupid...er...confused..."
,mwyoung,2012-06-12T11:28Z,"OH!!!

NOW IT WORKS!!!

I THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY...well, okay, I am anyway, but that's beside the point...

Please disregard boneheadedness..."
,mwyoung,2012-06-12T11:33Z,"Oh...well, I might as well ask here...

By chance would you or someone be committing a MASSIVE Science Fiction book FLOOD to the Pirate Boat any time soon?

Us SF freaks haven't had a fix in many a moon...

TIA"
