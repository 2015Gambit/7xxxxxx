Hello All! My fifth-teeth upload!
I used the keygen created by Team EMBRACE located here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6676322/VMware.Fusion.v4.0.1.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker-EMBRACE

To make a keygen with a very simple GUI, No terminal required.
Simply every time you run this app a new serial appears, run it as many times as you like!

Hope you all enjoy,

PS: Again all credit to Team EMBRACE for the actual key maker.
