,Oracle_of_Delphi,2012-06-12T11:07Z,"You know I just spent several hours going through your website's movie list. GREAT LIST!!
even the crappy movies you have are one's that I have to say I've seen (such as mega shark vs giant octopus. What a total piece of crap.)
anyway, I just thought of two additions to your library:
1. Road to Perdition
2. Lorenzo's Oil
Since so many of your movies reflect my taste, I just figured you might like these two if you haven't seen them.
Thanks again for everything."
,Oracle_of_Delphi,2012-06-12T11:18Z,P.S. I know you've already uploaded The Road to Perdition in mkv formats. but you've REALLY hit the sweet spot with the mp4's in terms of quality vs size.
,gramranger,2012-06-14T18:52Z,"Good rip, except at around 1:20 for about 10 minutes, the movie playback is horribly jerky.

I checked the inspector and no frames are dropping, it simply is encoded with the hiccups in it. Maybe someone was overtasking their CPU at the time of ripping for that span during the span.

Otherwise, a very good rip."
