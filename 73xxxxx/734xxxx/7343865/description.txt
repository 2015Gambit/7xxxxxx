Clockwork Angels is the 20th studio album by Canadian rock band Rush. The album was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Tennessee and Revolution Recording in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is set to be released on June 12, 2012.

Two songs that would eventually appear on the album, "Caravan" and "BU2B", were released to radio stations and made available for online digital purchase on June 1, 2010.[5] Following the release of these two songs, the band embarked on the Time Machine Tour in 2010 and 2011. The tour featured the first live performances of "Caravan" and "BU2B" as part of the nightly set list. Clockwork Angels was completed following this tour. The album's second single, titled "Headlong Flight", was released on April 19, 2012.

On his personal website, Neil Peart revealed that he took a new approach in writing and recording his drum tracks for the album: "I played through each song just a few times on my own, checking out patterns and fills that might work, then called in Booujzhe. He stood in the room with me, facing my drums, with a music stand and a single drumstickΓÇöhe was my conductor, and I was his orchestra... I would attack the drums, responding to his enthusiasm, and his suggestions between takes, and together we would hammer out the basic architecture of the part. His baton would conduct me into choruses, half-time bridges, and double-time outros and so onΓÇöso I didnΓÇÖt have to worry about their durations. No counting, and no endless repetition."
