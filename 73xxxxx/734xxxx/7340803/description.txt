Description:  PO'ED you're a chef aboard a ship that has been invaded by aliens. Your only hope for survival (and escape) is your superior intellect and your fast reflexes. This game is a first-person shooter that reminds many gamers of classics like DOOM and QUAKE. On the menu, you'll find weapons, battle bosses, and run and strafe your way through a seemingly endless army of malevolent aliens. This game was originally on the all-but-forgotten 3DO. Control is much improved over the original, with the PlayStation controller's extra buttons making things a little easier. The number of moves your chef character can pull off is impressive, considering the basic gameplay of run-and-strafe found in most first-person shooters. Not only can you run and shoot, but you can also jump, fly, and even do backflips.
