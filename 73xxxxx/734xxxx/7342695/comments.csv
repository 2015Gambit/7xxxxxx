,ichthyostega,2012-06-12T06:37Z,"Come one, please just one seeder! I promise, to keep seeding after getting the entire torrent!"
,semi-sentient,2012-06-14T03:48Z,"I was at this show just behind the pit (left center) and it was amazing. The visuals/accoustics were phenomenal and the setlist was fantastic.

I'll be sure to seed once I get it downloaded, but that could be a couple of weeks at the rate it's going.

Again, this was an awesome, awesome show."
,LurkCity3,2012-06-14T19:05Z,"well it seems to be picking up just a bit... im still around 47% though. I was at this show and i can not wait to relive it again. this was my first radiohead show ever, and by far i think i can consider myselft lucky i waited almost 20 years to see them live. fucking amazing... im going to seed only cause of that purpose."
