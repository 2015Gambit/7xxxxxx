,danny3975,2012-06-13T01:49Z,I've been looking forward to this one.
,johnkdbell,2012-06-13T02:39Z,"So those with XP can't play Krater, huh? Fuck. That's why I couldn't get the Beta to work. Is there a way around getting the game to work on XP?"
,scyris99,2012-06-13T02:42Z,"Usually I am hesitant in downloading anything off here that was not uploaded by someone with a skull, but I haven't seen any negative comments with 48+ seeders and prob many more than that completed downloads."
,scyris99,2012-06-13T02:43Z,"Probally not John, since Dx 10/11 is vista and win 7 only, your kinda boned on this game sadly. I do feel its just hurting their sales to not include dx9. since many people still use win xp."
,xeroorbit,2012-06-13T03:31Z,I am also a little leary of this one. Only found one other site offering a torrent of Krater so far.
,fishboy11,2012-06-13T04:21Z,"its a steam release as well, have never seen a steam release that didnt need a crack, although the uploader has uploaded a ton of stuff over the past year, so may be real, but its not on the steam crack board cs.rin so who knows"
,xeroorbit,2012-06-13T04:27Z,"Has anyone actually tried to install this yet? I am in the setup menu at the screen that asks you to select which components you want to install. The list it displays shows something like: ""Iniiaiua eaaiua oaeeu"" only every character has an accent mark over it. Damn, I'm too paranoid; gonna wait this one out."
,fishboy11,2012-06-13T04:43Z,"i'm guessing this is a beta version, since the game is only for sale on steam and this version is definetly not in a steam format"
,.morden,2012-06-13T04:59Z,"lol THETA have released this and they almost always create their own installer, not at all fishy."
,tanaas,2012-06-13T05:12Z,I can confirm this is legit have played the beta and this is the full game works fine 
,RickCartel,2012-06-13T11:04Z,"Installer works fine, just click ok and install, and at the end hit finish, the game is awesome, great animation and extremely fun, will possibly buy this."
,scyris99,2012-06-13T11:21Z,Yeah but Theta installers usually are in english and not gibberish.
,Militance,2012-06-13T12:12Z,the game works fine...only one problem...CANT FUCKING SAVE!!!!!!!
,Militance,2012-06-13T12:13Z,"Can some1 explain to me HOW TO SAVE, otherwise game works fine"
,Militance,2012-06-13T12:21Z,
,Militance,2012-06-13T12:44Z,nvm it auto saves lol but i got a feellin this is the beta version
,RezMar,2012-06-13T12:49Z,"There is no need to save the game...
Game do automatic for u.
When u enter again in the game u can chose continue and he will start in your last position.

Game is great :) , i like crafting mechanic."
,Militance,2012-06-13T12:54Z,aaaaaaaa
,eversmoking,2012-06-13T16:31Z,for me game freezes on startup at loading screen and i must restart my laptop. im using vista
,RiverRaidII,2012-06-13T16:44Z,"Now that game's got style.

Installation works like a charm. 
The only thing in gibberish are the details of what is being installed.
Which doesn't matter, as all options install the same.
The rest of the installer is in good old english.
So you'll know where you game will be installed, and which amount of mbs will be used.

The games works flawless on Win7 x64.
As it seems, the games saves automatically.
After quests, or entering a map. Haven't played
long enough to exactly find that out.

No Anti-Vir or Malware warning. Not even false positives.

What I found irritating, a bit, the message when the game starts, which says that graphic options
are not yet fully implemented, as the game will
be constantly updated. 

Also, the options menu can only be reached after starting the game.
"
,GObonzo,2012-06-13T17:02Z,game runs and saves but cannot change keybindings thru settings. every time game just crashes to desktop after clicking apply. graphics settings changed and applied fine.
,VegitoDBZ,2012-06-13T20:04Z,Whats the difference in collectors edition and skidrow one for instance?
,blackwlf666,2012-06-14T01:59Z,"Wow. If this is what they released, then they were WAY too quick to release it. This game has bugs coming out the ass, and I only played it for half an hour.

Installs and runs fine, though. Hopefully they'll patch it into something that doesn't resemble an early beta soon."
,rjcripe,2012-06-14T06:05Z,@johnkdbell If you are willing to torrent games then why not just torrent Vista or Windows 7? XP is getting real fucking old and there is no reason you should still be using it... there will be a LOT of games coming out that XP won't be able to run.
,johnkdbell,2012-06-15T04:24Z,"@rjcripe In all honesty, I am afraid of my game performance if I upgrade to Win7. I know my computer can definitely handle Win7, but game requirements seem to increase if you run Win7 so I am hesitant."
,RiverRaidII,2012-06-15T22:17Z,"@johnkdbell
In all honesty, I am afraid of my game performance if I upgrade to Win7. I know my computer can 
definitely handle Win7, but game requirements seem to increase if you run Win7 so I am hesitant. 

I can understand your hesitation. Win7 is using by far less resources than Vista, and
is managing them more efficient. But it's of course still using more than XP. It really
comes down to the question how much RAM you have, how much your OS will use
up, and how much will still be there for games. 

It took me a long while to migrate to Win7. I'm using all kinds of open source programs,
that it behaves and looks like Win XP. I like the new technology, but I just like the 
visuals and interface of Xp better. Guess you could take my Win7 for XP. ;-)"
,GATOQSECOMIO,2012-06-21T04:45Z,thanks
,johnkdbell,2012-07-13T05:51Z,"Welp, I have Windows 7 now. Let's try this bad boy out."
,Magic_friendly,2012-08-12T09:50Z,"I have a single core 1.6 GHz processor with ATI Radeon HD 3200 Graphics card and 3 GB ram, this laptop runs way better with Win 7 than Vista, though I admit, I am a little upset that some games have some problem running compared to Vista, but my laptop does not get as hot. It's very nice. =) Win 7 has WAY better things too, it's totally worth it. Plus, some games you have to run them in Windows XP compatibility mode, so you have both with Vista and 7.  
On another note, I sure hope this game works, because the uploader doesn't fully crack some games..."
