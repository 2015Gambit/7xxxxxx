,hackintosh1984pl,2012-06-12T13:13Z,"Apple Releases OS X Mountain Lion Developer Preview 4 With Facebook Integration

Apple has included a separate installer that integrates Facebook into Mountain Lion. The company previewed this integration earlier today.

The small “OS X Facebook Developer Preview” .dmg file contains an installer for baking the social network right into the latest version of Mountain Lion. Once installed, you can sign into a Facebook account from System Preferences.

,nomad707,2012-06-13T02:45Z,"This DOES WORK !! 

-Download

-Open .dmg

-Copy Installation file into the Applications folder .... THAT IS IMPORTANT !! 

-Run Install file from the Applications folder

-After OS X Mountain Lion Installs you can install the Facebook Dev. Preview just run it from the .dmg.

-To setup Facebook open System Pref. Go to Mail, Contacts, Calendars and add your Facebook Account. (and Twitter) Then you will be able to post to Facebook in the Notification Center and other places in the OS. "
,smash364,2012-06-13T04:08Z,"Yes it takes a while and It does work you have to right click on the Install Mountain Lion.app and clicking on show package contents, then run the Install ESD.dmg from this folder. I suggest creating a separate partition on your mac (or hackintosh) before installing just to play around with it and see if its buggy or not before putting it on your main partition. If you need help partitioning or simply don't know what I'm talking about there is tons of free information online even on youtube."
