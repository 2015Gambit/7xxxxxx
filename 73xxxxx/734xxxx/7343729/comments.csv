,PauloFran,2012-06-13T03:23Z,Very bad video quality.
,BoxeeMove,2012-06-13T21:04Z,"Most of YIFY rips are great. This is very bad. The movie is pixelated and hard to watch to the point of un-watchable. All scenes you can see pixelated squares. The audio is very bad An example of YIFY great rips is ""Michael Clayton"". 

V2/A1: 

I watched this on a 50"" TV using Boxee Box. I then switched to VLC and the video was the same."

,mytvguy,2012-07-27T23:51Z,"Thanks again, Yify. Hope you get the hankering for the sort of freedom these guys sacrificed their lives for.  Highly recommend ""the War"" by Ken Burns, and ""Band of Brothers"" directed by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. "
