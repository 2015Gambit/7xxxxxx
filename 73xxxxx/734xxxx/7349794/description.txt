This is the Free expansion pack for Dungeons of Dredmor. It is installed as easily as extracting to your current 1.0.11 install of DoD.

Here is a link to the Gaslamp Games website where it is from. It does not contain any executables. The 1.0.11 version of the game looks for this directory and works with it automatically. YHTNTEP = You Have To Name The Expansion Pack.

This torrent is primarily for those using a non-Steam version of the game. Steam should offer the expansion by itself.
