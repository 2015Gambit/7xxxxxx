,bigghands,2012-06-12T19:17Z,"""So boring is Alien Origin that the opening title sequence features a montage of lame action moments that do not occur until the last third of the movie; a montage I believe to be a desperate ploy to ensure the audience that if they watch long enough, eventually there will be some action. Lies, I tell you."
