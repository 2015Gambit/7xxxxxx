The set THE CRUSADES is a 4-volume work of art highly recommended for both high school and college-level libraries as a basic introductory reference. 1,000 A-Z entries and translated texts on individual crusades and crusaders reflect the contributions of over a hundred researchers from over twenty countries, and are accompanied by maps, bibliographic references, and black and white illustrations. It's the only work to embrace the entire crusade movement from the 11th century through modern times - and all throughout Europe into the Middle East, and represents the latest scholarship, organized by a UK lecturer in medieval studies. A highly recommended, basic reference for any school where Crusades history is studied.
