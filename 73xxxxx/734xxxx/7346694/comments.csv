,operator1101,2012-06-12T00:46Z,"Please note, this is a RELEASE CANDIDATE. Like all MS RC applications it has a kill date."
,xpmule,2012-06-12T11:25Z,"I'm sure every business in the world is waiting to get their hands on the final version.

I wonder how many thing you would need to customize on this on a fresh install..
#1 = Kill the start screen crap.
#1b = Hack / remove the retarded ribbon crap.
#2 = Kill not needed services.
#3 = Kill unwanted tasks.
#4 = Kill un wanted start up registry entries.
#5 = Remove un wanted integrated features / components.
#6 = Modify user / security settings
#7 = Modify file / folder view settings.

This is getting about as tiring as having to modify all that crap..

Microbloat is getting ridiculous !
I bet they have a formula for hardware requirements..

if ( WindowsVersion == NEW )
do
{
increaseSystemRequirements * 8;
while ( addingNothingUsefull( pos ) )
        pos++;
}

This version and all its sku's will end up
being regarded as the worst version of windows ever. (worst than ME and Vista)
And will push more people to mac's and Linux."
,operator1101,2012-06-12T20:02Z,"I've been testing this on hardware for a few days now and I'm actually digging the new setup. I especially like that 2012 Server installs as CORE by default. That is a huge step for MS in the right direction.
Can't wait to see how this thing handles a real corporate environment and not just a test lab."
,ITWorldZ,2012-08-01T12:35Z,"Yeah the MS Programming Guide Schema is thus:

dim object WindowsNew 
dim object WindowsOS

pivate sub WindowsNew (ByVal as SystemMicrosoftWindows) New=OS

If 
  (WindowsOS == XP, Vista, 7;

Then

    {WindowsNew == Upgrade;

     Upgrade   = OS;

     OS = 8}
)

If
   OS = 8 
do
{
increaseSystemRequirements * 8;

while 

( addingNothingUsefull( pos ) )

pos++;
}"
