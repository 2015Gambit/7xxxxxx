From the title down, his current hit You Need Me, I Don't Need You presents 20-year-old singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran as a very cocksure customer indeed. He pours scorn on other artists given a leg-up into the charts by songwriters-for-hire or the munificence of the BPI: "Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell ΓÇª my shit's cool ΓÇª I didn't go to Brit School."


It all seems a little at odds with Sheeran's likably unassuming image: on his website, he offers retail space to liquorice allsort-themed jewellery designed by his mum. Then again, you can understand his bullishness. His success this year has seemed phenomenal, soundtracked by screaming girls: You Need Me rocketed straight into the top three, while its predecessor, The A-Team, a lachrymose portrait of a young drug-addicted prostitute, spent three months in the top 10. He has arrived in the charts already a star, thanks to his own tireless efforts to build a fanbase without the aid of pluggers and press officers: a punishing live schedule that involved playing more than 300 gigs in 2009 alone, six self-released EPs and three albums in the last six years, the last ΓÇô an album of collaborations with various UK rappers, with whom he shares a love of rapid-fire lyrics and slightly clunky pop-cultural similes ("on cold days cold plays out," he sings on Drunk, "like the band's name") ΓÇô managing to muscle its way into the lower end of the album chart.

Indeed, even before Atlantic put it out last week, You Need Me was said to have sold 120,000 copies. Sheeran has already released it himself as a single, an EP track and in a 10-minute live version ΓÇô interpolated with a cover of 50 Cent's In Da Club and a freestyle rap about smoking dope, alas delivered in a mock-Jamaican accent ΓÇô that even the song's most ardent fan might perhaps consider a little too much of a good thing: "Where I come from, burning weed is a habit ΓÇª something I've inherited like a ghetto man should," offers Sheeran, who comes from Framlingham in Suffolk, a market town voted the No 1 place to live in Britain by Country Life magazine.

Deluxe Edition with 4 bonus tracks.
