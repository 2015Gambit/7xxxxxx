This live album provided a survey of his two most recent albums, Graceland and Rhythm of the Saints, and also drew liberally from his earlier songbook including a number of tunes from the Simon and Garfunkel era. 600,000 people were initially claimed to have attended the show, which was held in Central Park, New York City on August 15, 1991, though later estimates downgraded the number to less than 100,000. The concert was similar to The Concert in Central Park, a reunion concert for both Simon and Garfunkel held ten years earlier.
