By the way, do you think you could upload, The Assault (2011) (AKA L'Assaut) ? I would love to see it in 1080p with english subs. I am asking you this because english subs for this movie is nowhere to find. Been on multiple sites now, and still can't find any. Thank you if you will be able to upload it with english subs.

Here's the imdb link to the film: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1793239/"

,samljer,2012-07-02T05:20Z,"720P but NOT HD.
the definition in this movie ISNT HIGH.

The compression used was just too high
it doesnt have that clarity it should.

however, its still incredibly watchable, just not ""HD"" even if it is 720p."
