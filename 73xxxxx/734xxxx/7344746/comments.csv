Very good quality, Sky coverage with pre-race buildup and interesting interviews.

Typo in the title, should be F1 Formula 1 - Race 7 - CANADA Grand Prix. ;-)"
,Bont97,2012-06-13T04:09Z,Thanks for another great upload smokkedog!  I've come to rely on you since they cut SPEED out of my cable package!  I'm finding that I enjoy Sky's coverage much more anyways!
