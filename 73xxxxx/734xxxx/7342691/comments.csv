,CosminRadulescu,2012-06-10T08:37Z,is this complete? the size is different from the other cycles
,341007,2012-06-10T11:20Z,"well, now for PC ;)"
,airbusflyer,2012-06-10T11:49Z,"@CosminRadulescu
I think it is, the last parts where perfect. During the last cycle someone told him to use 7zip as it's create much more smaller files. And the file size matches perfect to that (the other said there will be a file size of around 900MB).
So maybe you have to download 7zip for freeware. 

Thanks for the upload again :) Good man!"

no one has to worry about the filesize. It works great and just updated the ipad with the jeppesen charts. 
Again, very good work mate!"
,disagreeable,2012-06-11T07:57Z,"Is this for JeppFD or JeppTC????

Do I need to do this to both if I have both on the iPad?

Is there any way around the nag screen about registering?

Thanks!!"

,sgamd87,2012-06-11T21:45Z,"@disagreeable
this can be used for both
for FD copy everything to your ipad
for TC you only need to copy the files on the TermCharts folder"
,B747800,2012-06-12T00:14Z,"DOWNLOADING IPAD CYCLE RIGHT AWAY!!!. :-)


Anyway knows how to remove the nasty demo screen?"
,disagreeable,2012-06-12T10:18Z,"@sgamd87

Thanks! 
I did that but it still has this problem of ""chart not found"". but it finds the airport and displays the chart list, just not he chart!

I have uninstalled/reinstalled jeppFD, replaced the Data folder in the:
MYiPad/Apps/com.jeppesen.JeppFD/Documents

but still same error. Any idea's?
Do I have to replace any other folder in the directory? maybe delete the Demo folders etc????"
,southofthequator,2012-06-12T14:43Z,Can you get rid of the Demo Screen?????

,sgamd87,2012-06-12T16:13Z,"@disagreeable
What I did
navigate to iPad/Apps/com.jeppesen.JeppFD/Documents/data
delete the 4 folders (airway_manuals, Enroute, enroute_notices, TermCharts)
copy the 4 folders from this torrent.
Then just open jeppFD and select demo mode. Wait a few seconds/minutes to build the charts database, after that you should have all the IFR charts"
,disagreeable,2012-06-12T17:12Z,"@sgamd87

Sorry Bro, not working.
Same chart problem. I am guessing it is a simple solution but must be a problem with the updated version of JeppFD?
Something is not referencing correctly and so the error is still here. 

@ fernandodunha
Thanks for the upload, but can you either put the required files in that are missing or provide an exact step by step fix for this problem/install?

something needs to be added or changed in the referencing for this to work, and you seem like the man who knows about it best.

Thanks."

@DAviator I don't have it yet. Give me a few days and maybe I can get it for you.

Thanks all for support and don't forget to rate my files!"
,disagreeable,2012-06-14T08:40Z,"@ fernandodunha

Thanks man! 
Got it working by uninstalling and placing the data folder in and it worked!
I must have had a corrupt file or something stopping it working.

+1 added! Thanks!"

,mjq,2012-06-15T12:25Z,"Ola Fernando, fala portugues? O meu JeppFD só funciona com o directorio TermCharts. Se eu copiar os outros directorios, desaparece-me toda a informação de rotas sobre os mapas, bem como as localizações dos WP, Vors, apt, etc. Sabe o que será?!
Obrigado"
,mjq,2012-06-15T12:27Z,"Now in English... My problem is that if I only copy Termcharts to the data directory, everything works, I can see terminal, airport and VFR charts, and on the maps, everything appears (routes, Vors, NDBs, apts, etc). If I copy the other 3 directories, everything desappears from the map... I only can see the charts. Anyone can help? Thank you."

For those who are trying to unlock the JeppFD software (1.1.0 version) and are having troubles, here are the step by step procedures you need to do it:
1. Install JeppFD on device and open the software for the first time.
2. Download the 1205 cycle on the link: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7073191/Jeppview_1205
3. Unzip the file named 1205.zip
4. On the iExplorer, navigate to iPad name/Apps/JeppFD
5. Replace the folder "" Documents "" for the folder you unziped with the same name.

  After that, you just need to continue updating the cycles!!!
 I hope you have succes!!!"
