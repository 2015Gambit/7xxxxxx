That VCR has been gone for for a long time.

Over the years, I thought that the tapes had also been lost had been lost until one day I opened up some old boxes that had moved with me from state to state and there they sat.
I had an newer VCR so I popped them in.
Amazingly they were still in the same condition as they were the day I got them!

I'm also still an avid Stevie Nicks/Fleetword Mac fan but tech knowledge (back then I wouldn't go near a computer) and my tape to DVD skills have greatly improved.

I'd always had wanted to immortalize these videos, and thanks to the new age, I can now do that.

If you are able to ignore the volume increasing bar in the beginning (I knew so little then) I'm sure the large fan base of Fleetwood Fanatics will enjoy this look back to the 90's when George Bush Jr. was still an unknown and DVD's had just hit the scene!

Full Synopsis: 

This is the story of the band Fleetwood Mac whose on/off relationships and bust ups became as famous as their music.

Updated to the original episode are the final departure of Christine McVie from the band, the revised line up's new album and their ongoing determination to keep the show on the road and filling stadiums.

The crew goes into their deepest thoughts and experiences.

They included the break ups, the drug use, etc.

In the interview with Lindsey Buckingham, he mentions how the deal to sign him on was a package deal.

They must include Stevie Nicks if they wanted his master guitarist talents in their band.

Little did they know that in spite of not knowing how to play a physical instrument, her real ""instrument"" was her now famous raspy and hypnotic voice.

The show also mentions how they were asked ""Almost by presidential decree"" to preform at Bill Clinton's inauguration

At about the same time of ""The Dancer"" tour, the group reunited for at tour to perform the now famous show ""The Dance"" (seen live by this reviewer). The show was shortly aired on P.B.S. for one of their fundraisers.

It should also be noted that this was the last tour to include Christine McVie due to health issues.

For a group that struggled so long, many times thrown together at the last minute, the now sit in a place of fame that shall be timeless."
