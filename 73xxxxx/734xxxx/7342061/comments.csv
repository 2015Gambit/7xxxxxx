,Osiris69,2012-06-22T09:13Z,"saor_alba - Seeding (or seed) is a term used to describe a person who reaches 100% of a download and doesn't disconnect.  They stay connected, allowing others to be able to grab the entire copy of the item posted.  Leechers are people who haven't reached 100% yet.  In other words, leechers are 0%-99% downloaded, and seeders are 100% downloaded.  If there are no seeders connected to that single torrent, then no one can get a complete copy of it - to which the program, game, app, movie, etc. is worthless in most cases.  Hope that helps ya, young Padowan.  ;-)"

Was one of my first here on Pirate Bay. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the quality. The picture lacks definition - rather muddy, & seems to be vid footage from a Spanish subtitled cinema version, tho the subtitles were only visible on the title credit. It's fine - is good to get a look at this just-released film, even if in basic form, tho I would have spent time downloading another copy if I'd had more info from the get-go. Any background from you more experienced guys on this...? Thanks for making these files available. Cheers."
