,biglittle1,2012-06-10T14:11Z,I don't know how you pack so much picture quality in such a small file but you do it extremely well!! I downloaded a huge 1080p version of this movie and yours and I could tell little difference in the video quality. The only big difference was the bigger file had better audio but yours was still good as well. I thank you for all the effort into allowing people like me to download great movies for just the cost of our bandwith. After finding this I am now going to browse through your other torrents and try and download as many as I can!!! Thanks again!!
,ILPB,2012-06-10T16:37Z,"PLZ upload ""Wrong Turn"" Movie series.

Thanks YIFY."
,Powerslave0,2012-06-11T00:11Z,"It is not 1080p, do the math!  It only says the SOURCE is 1080p, that means shit. "
,vmjyogi,2012-06-26T19:55Z,"Did anyone else noticed extremezone's torrent has a pink skull? I thought EZ was green...

Oh well, that's why we have YIFY!!

Thanks for the up."
,bedtime_scares,2012-06-29T00:08Z,"READ IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW 1080P works...
1920x816 is 1080p

This is how... 1080p (p = progressive scan) can only be achieved by a ratio of 1.78:1 or rather 1920x1080 lines of resolution. SO... 

This user has taken in to account that the black bars that happen on a 16:9 screen because the original theatre/camera image is 21:9, and just told you that the picture quality is based on a 1920 lines of resolution vertical viewed by 816 lines of resolution horizontally viewed.. that means that 264 lines of resolution horizontally displayed is really 132 lines on the bottom and 132 lines on the top that make up the black bars...

So for all the users saying this guy doesn't know what the hell he is talking about... SHOVE IT UP YOUR ARSE!!!! You're the idiot now.."
,coolmurphy,2012-07-02T08:19Z,awesome quality what can i say!
