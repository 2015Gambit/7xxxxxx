,ferrabra,2012-06-15T07:37Z,"This is a The Asylum low budget crappy movie that was released direct-to-video on May 15, 2012 which is a mockbuster of the Hasbro/Universal Pictures film Battleship. I was originally namd American Battleship but had to change name to American Warships.
So it is not a fake but is a crappy movie trying to explore the huge publicity of the Battleship movie."
,manosLP,2012-06-15T13:57Z,"Well actually there are a few titles for this movie

In other countries it is american warship and in other american battleship but it is stil the same movie:)"
,moonbugs,2012-06-15T16:24Z,"If you want a good laugh, this is the movie to watch! The acting is laughable, the special effects are laughable, the aerial shots show 2 different aircraft carriers calling themselves the Enterprise!

And 2 different ships calling themselves the USS Iowa!

This movie had me in stitches!"
,longpole001,2012-06-18T08:48Z,"i am sure this went to dvd from the release , what a lot of rubbish , v/A is 10/10 but the movie - 3"

,Zipgun,2012-06-22T23:04Z,"@evilmiky

NOT fake you're just too fucking stupid to freaking read."
,Zipgun,2012-06-22T23:09Z,LOL Man some peeps are so fucking stupid or too fucking poor to just watch the fucker in the theater.
,boboYC,2012-07-05T17:18Z,"lol guys, in my country its Battleship. So yea, different places different names..."
,solayagim,2012-08-03T22:42Z,"We all know that Mario Van Peebles will never be mistaken for DeNiro, but he reaches new lows for acting in this awful mess. A cardboard cutout of a Naval officer would have had the same impact on screen. Of course, he had no script, no plot and no supporting actors either, so his only fault may have been accepting the role in this piece of junk.

Director Thunder Levin should never be allowed near a movie set again. In fact, him calling himself a director is like me calling myself the dictator of a small South American country. I am nothing of the sort but, neither is he.

I did pick up some interesting info while watching this crapfest, though, such as: When a US Navy ships Captain rescues one of his female officers from under a piece of armor plating, they then roll around on the deck and make out a lot. When in battle, a US Navy ships crew does virtually nothing except stand around on deck, waving their arms and shouting ""YAY!"". There is always a five foot long piece of two-inch iron pipe lying around on the deck of a US Navy battleship, in case you have to stop a rolling 16 inch artillery shell from crushing you. Carl Weathers would be better off spending his time at the horse track, eating sardine sandwiches and betting 50 cent trifectas.

There is nothing redeeming about this, uh, ""movie"". The acting is wooden, the CGI is so amateurish it's laughable, and the plot is ridiculous. Next time, I'll paint a wall and just sit watching it dry, my time would be better spent."

ROFL.. Couldn't make better impression of this crap movie. No wonder IMDB rating is 2.9.
Even if a 5 star theater give away free tickets for this, I wouldn't bother watch it."
