[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-10T00:27Z,backand i will do Youngjustice but i wont be able to upload it on saturday because it airs 30mins before korra but ends 1min into korra. so i can only record one of the other. But since Young Justice Airs sunday also ill be sure to record it.

,williamvirkis,2012-06-10T04:29Z,Thank you very much! :D
,dozycats,2012-06-10T04:55Z,"Nice one! Fantastic video and audio quality with a small file size. Probably the best one out there.

However, the quality on this one isn't as good as episodes 06, 07, and 08. Whatever compression settings you used on those, you should keep using. They had incredible quality."
,freshmints,2012-06-10T05:27Z,Thank you very much! :D
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-10T05:35Z,"This episode was capture with Composite cables, My HDMI cables finally gave up after 4years."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-10T05:36Z,Component cables i mean
,vinz23,2012-06-10T06:51Z,"Surely this is 720p and it's size are much lighter than other uploads, thanks Daman4Iife, I was expected that collecting the whole episodes of The Legend of Korra will require me more than 14 gigs, but thanks to you it will be about 6 gigs

Btw, it's a little bit ghostly, but no problem."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-10T10:26Z,"1080p Version coming Soon, 5X better Quality than this"

,Sterkelee,2012-06-10T14:46Z,"Hey, i wondered if you can improve on the quality of the ""(equalist) electric scenes"". These scenes are very pixellated ( http://imgur.com/a/KZzN6 )
But the rest of it was GREAT QUALITY!!"
,Intellectual_BA,2012-06-10T14:51Z,"Daman: EXCELLENT job, awesome quality, perfect size.
I honestly don't give a sh** whether or not the logo is there, it's not at all distracting (even though I have moderate OCD).
There's just one little problem: is anyone else having trouble getting this particular episode to show up on a media server for their PS3? All of the other episodes seem to show up fine, just not this one. Not sure why. It's placed in a folder of readable depth, so I doubt that that's the cause. I even re-converted it, PS3 still can't find it.
Other than that, this is an all-around excellent rip."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-10T16:38Z,"sterkelee, yes i can clean out every pixelated scene in the video, and make it as clean as a blu ray video.
but it requires a lot of time. ill be doing it with my 1080p uploads. il be uploading it soon."
,scottfrenz,2012-06-10T17:38Z,"Hey, thanks Daman! Excellent video quality and file size as always, and the audio is great too except that it seems to be in mono (whereas your others are in surround).

Are you aware of this?  Or is something weird on my end?

Thanks!"
,Eeddii22,2012-06-10T20:07Z,"Just get http://www.amazon.com/DVI-Gear-HDMI-Cable-Feet/dp/B0002L5R78/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1339351584&sr=8-1&keywords=hdmi+cable , there is no difference between a $1 hdmi cable and a $30 hdmi cable, the company monster is a bunch of liars and thieves."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-10T20:52Z,"eedie i know, that why i had to wait till monday to order from amazon since they dont ship on saturdays and sunday.

,Intellectual_BA,2012-06-11T20:09Z,"I figured out what went wrong, and boy am I embarassed: I put it on the share using a guest profile.  All I had to due was use another computer to cut it out of the folder, then put it back in. So as far as I've seen, it works fine now."

Audio still feels like its missing base. It sounds a whole nicer, whatever you did, but IF you compare with an official version you'd know what I'm talking about. It's not noticeable otherwise.

The video quality is great, but the colour is ever so slightly off. It's most obvious in the intro, where there's a slightly green tinge.

But the torrent is awesome, kick-ass quality and awesome size."
[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-11T23:52Z,"3hhtte if you want the best Torrent available grap my 1080p then tell me what you think.
This version is mostly for people that want Good quality for small size "
