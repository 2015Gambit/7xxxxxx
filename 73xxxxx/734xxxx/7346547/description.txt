This version of Counter Strike Source is 1.0.0.34 (old engine before Orange Box),
just install the game and you ready to play on NoSteam servers

NOTES : 
How to Change name - open console ,write    name yourname    ,hit enter ,you have a new name.

With this version you can play only on old servers  ,if you try to connect 
to one server and game reply to you "Host_Error: Unexpected authentication protocol -192964695!" 
or "Your version does not match the servers.Please restart the game."
is because that server is running new Orange Box engine. 


If your Video Card is older ,open game,go to Options ,Video ,Advanced and set to low or disabled.

With this version you can play only ON CRACKED SERVERS ,
anyway on Favorites Tab you have 100 cracked servers added manually by me to play online. 


DO NOT TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH STEAM APPLICATION OPENED ,
CLOSE OR LOGOUT FROM STEAM THEN RUN THIS GAME !!!!
