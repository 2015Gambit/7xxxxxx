,nycragman,2012-07-06T12:13Z,thanks for the up! does this file also have the siren warning for speed traps? Can that be edited out ? 
,traigom,2012-07-17T06:55Z,"@nycragman You have to manually set up the warning only once.
Go to Edit POI Setting --> Warn when approaching POI--> choose the distance, and the alert [siren, horn, bell, etc] done!"
