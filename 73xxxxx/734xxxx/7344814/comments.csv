,Fredioz,2012-06-29T19:05Z,"Seems to be some kind of bug, after the intro it all gets pitch black and nothing happens. Will try to fix that."
,JohnnyFurious,2012-07-02T11:08Z,"I launch the game, black ''launching'' screen, nothing, boom, game crash"
,demzie,2012-07-05T12:36Z,"I am getting the same ""intro then nothing"" scenario. Everything will load and then as soon as I hit new game it begins to load, then crashes. Any help?"
,Tokawase,2012-07-06T02:41Z,"I found a solution to the ""crash after hitting new game"" thing

,EchoVG,2012-07-08T13:26Z,"My game won't start, I boot it up and it just goes to a black screen then it says ""Fallout 3 is not responding"" Any help?"
,VapixTheScholar,2012-07-21T03:08Z,@EchoVG could it be that your computer or graphics card is a piece of garbage.
,simolino,2012-07-26T18:02Z,"Piece of fucking shit, tried to put a virus on my computer huh. It just downloads a random file that doesn't work....good thing i didn't click on it though. fuck you stinky motherfucker. "
,LuvEvol,2012-07-28T01:18Z,So does it work or not O.o
,LuvEvol,2012-07-28T04:54Z,"It does work... sorta. I played through the intro just fine, (ignoring the small window that popped up for a split second every once and awhile) until I came to the point where you pick the gender. Right after that, it suddenly fails on me and freezes. (I have an ATI Radeon HD 5xxx, so it should have been fine.)"
,tysontanner80,2012-07-30T18:08Z,"OK when i open the fallout launcher and click start it goes to a black screen for about 3 seconds... then it says Fallout3 has stopped working... it is not my graphics card that is the problem because i run Skyrim and Mw3 with out lag. CAN SOMEONE HELP ME? this is the 3rd one ive downloaded that dosent work
Please help"
,PineappleBuns,2012-08-04T07:31Z,"It did the black screen at first, i usually play on medium. (for best performance) but My PC is capable of running on ultra. it may be a graphics card issue for some, just try changing the detail to high or so.
But other than the inconvenience it works perfectly, will continue seeding. :)"
,francismcgvrn,2012-08-11T16:39Z,"the fuck is this shit? it's just some random file, you cunt."
