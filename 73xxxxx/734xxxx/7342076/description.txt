Peter Paddon - The Sight - Getting It, Using It, Dealing With It


The Sight - the ability to see realms beyond the physical and interact with otherworldly spirits.The Sight by Peter Paddon is a very educational look at what the sight is and how to use it. I found the classroom setting of the video beneficial. Watching the students perform the steps and seeing their reactions was very interesting. I would recommend watching this class with a partner so you can walk through the steps as Peter is explaining them. The Sight is not an easy thing to explain and takes practice to learn. Peter's video is very informative and if the steps he teaches are followed and practiced, you will get results.
