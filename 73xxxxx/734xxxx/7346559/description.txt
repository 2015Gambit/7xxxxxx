In SAVING HOPE, when charismatic Chief of Surgery Charlie Harris (Michael Shanks, STARGATE SG-1) at Torontos Hope-Zion Hospital ends up in a coma, he leaves the hospital in chaos and his fianc√©e and fellow surgeon, Alex Reid (Erica Durance, SMALLVILLE), in a state of shock. Along with newly-arrived star surgeon, Joel Goran (Daniel Gillies, THE VAMPIRE DIARIES), Alex races to save Harris life. As the action unfolds, comatose Dr. Harris wanders the halls of Hope-Zee in spirit form, not sure if hes a ghost or a figment of his own imagination. Reid, along with her fellow doctors, press on to save his life and those of their other patients, as they deal with the complicated and courageous decisions that are made in their daily struggle to keep hope alive.
