,megate,2012-06-09T19:35Z,whats with the wierd ar on the ep 
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-09T19:57Z,"it's standard definition (SD) meaning 4:3 AR. However there are black bars all around it so we crop out that, making it more rectangular than square.

,glyphie,2012-06-09T20:18Z,This one works perfectly. Thanks.
,morgtastic,2012-06-10T01:43Z,BiTorrent keeps freezing up when I try to download. Which sucks because you do good work. I've never had trouble with Bitorrent before but can you recomend a better program?
[T],MrUnpopular,2012-06-10T03:29Z,I've been having BitTorrent freezing issues lately too. Try uTorrent. Practically the same thing by the same people. Only difference is I've had no freezing.
,haps88,2012-06-11T01:29Z,Very weird about those freezes - cause i have them with uTorrent and i wanted to try BitTorrent but it seems like some kind of conspiracy ^_^
