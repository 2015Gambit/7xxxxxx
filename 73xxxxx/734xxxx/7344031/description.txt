
A cash-in if there ever was one, Arista's Priests of Kanibals: The Best of Shriekback was issued in 1994, summing up Shriekback's finer moments between Jam Science and Oil and Gold, and adding a batch of remixes released during the band's short stint on the label. ("Nerve," the B-side of "Hand on My Heart," is also tossed in for added value.) 
Out of the vast number of Shriekback compilations, Priests and Kanibals is obviously one of the least serviceable packages since it's little more than an audio equivalent of a baseball card blister pack, selecting highlights and completist fodder spread between two records and the singles that supported them. 
Despite the tracks being rather well chosen, there's hardly enough here to attract a diehard fan, and those new to Shriekback would be better off with any of the other compilations floating around. (AMG)
