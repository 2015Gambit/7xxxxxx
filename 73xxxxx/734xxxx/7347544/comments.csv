I don't see why people prefer AVI over MP4 anyway. I don't know of any devices these days that won't play both, and if PC users are having issues playing MP4 files on their computers, I say just get VLC. If encoded using the same codec, the quality will be identical, but (and here's where I get confused by requests for AVI) the same video encoded at the same file size will actually be of higher quality as an MP4 than as an AVI. 

Once upon a time, AVI was absolutely preferred because it had been around longer (released by Microsoft in 1992, if memory serves) and had fewer compatibility issues than MP4. But that's not the case anymore. Add to that the fact that MP4 files are more versatile, capable of things like chapters and such, and there's really no reason to choose AVI over MP4. I think the only people that DO prefer AVI's are either people that are too stubborn to change their mind from a time when AVI really was better, or people that simply don't realize MP4 has gotten better. 

And for the record, even when AVI was perceived as offering superior quality, it was really a sort of ""false stigma"" brought on by the fact that back in the day, most of the MP4's floating around were either encoded with poor software or poor settings (it did take a while for decent and affordable encoders to come out), or people were re-encoding AVI's as MP4's, rather than encoding from the source. But that's all in the past. Today, it's far too easy to encode an MP4 with either better quality and the same file size, or equal quality and a smaller file size. "

Maybe this will help you understand. I download 3or 4 episodes of a series and burn them to dvd using ConvertXtoDVD. Then I watch all the episodes back to back (like watching a movie). The AVI's are all pretty well standard sizes and there are no problems converting. I did a search for Eureka se05e08 and there are all kinds of sizes for the mp4 files and they seem to change every week. I don't want to input different file sizes, fpm, resolutions and sound codecs etc. into my DVD converter software.  That's just asking for trouble. I upgraded to the latest conversion software to take a shot at converting the MP4's to DVD, but with all the different file sizes I chickened out. When I make data DVD with different sized MP4's, sometimes they don't all play. Anyway, I hope this helps you understand why some of us are slow to change. AVI = No problems and no bad disks burned.
