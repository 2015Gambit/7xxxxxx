1. WHAT IS DELPHI 7 SECOND EDITION
----------------------------------

Delphi 7 SE is an improved version of Delphi 7 Professional, created with the
purpose to offer a true Delphi 7 successor to a significant part of the Delphi
community, neglected by Borland for too many years.

If you are sick of the releases that Borland has produced since they became
the MS .NET bitch, you will like Delphi 7 SE. Also, if you have any fixes for
VCL bugs that Borland has refused to solve along the years, you have now the
opportunity to see them integrated in the product. To do so, don't hesitate to
visit our forum at http://www.liteapplications.com or contact us directly at
contact@liteapplications.com. Enjoy!
