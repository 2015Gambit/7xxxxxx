     The Army was no laughing matter until Judy Benjamin joined it.

     When her husband dies on the wedding night Judy decides to join the army.
     What looks like a bad decision at first, turns out not so bad at all.
     That is, until her superior makes sexual advances. She is transferred to
     NATO headquarters in Europe and (re)meets the Frenchman Henri. Judy and
     Henri decide to marry, but will they ?
