When Mawkin:Causley released The Awkward Recruit three years ago, it seemed they were destined to become major folk celebrities. Here, after all was an impressive group of young instrumentalists who had joined forces with Jim Causley, who could have been in a boy band if he wasn't such a fine traditional singer. But it didn't quite work out. Causley left, leaving Mawkin in urgent need of strong vocals. Most of the tracks here are instrumentals, with Dave Delarre showing off his classical guitar and mandolin work on dance tunes such as Rannalla, and electric guitar on the elegant Easter Thursday, with classy violin and melodeon backing provided by his brother James and newcomer Nick Cooke. But Dave is less successful as a singer, as shown by his revival of the early Kinks song Harry Rag, so thankfully there are special guests to help out. The best tracks feature vocals from Steve Knightley, on his own song It's All Quiet, Eliza Carthy, with an exquisite, gently theatrical and soulful treatment of Bad Girls Lament, and Jim Causley, who rejoins his old band mates for the sturdy final track, Bellringers.
