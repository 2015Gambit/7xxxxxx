If you don't, the activation process may not work right (or at all!)"" but I can not find that torrent - can you please direct me?  Thanks"
,EinDeutschMan,2012-06-10T19:43Z,"@cookieberr,

Here's what you need:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7272499/Rosetta_Stone_v3.4.7_Preinstalled.exe

And use any language packs that have the word ""Speech"" AND Preinstalled"" in the name.

NONE of the Rar files will work correctly, they were a (failed) previous attempt to simplify things"

,SigFan80,2012-06-12T03:57Z,"Okay. I finished dnl this and it is a blank file type. I have no idea what is going on or what is causing this to happen. anyone have any ideas? 

This happens with this torrent and with russian. The hebrew dnl but doesn't install when ran."
,SigFan80,2012-06-18T02:14Z,"Any idea why there would be a threat detected by avast with in the your Rosetta stone downloads?

It comes up as the following SWF: CVE-2012-2037.
Just a cause for concern I think. 

Thanks."
,hellmell,2012-06-19T04:44Z,"Hi,
Are you still going to upload the Spain version?
Thanks"
,Iniana_Pirate,2012-06-22T00:04Z,"Hi I downloaded this and the torrent that you mentioned in the earlier comment and extracted them both.

My problem is that once I open up the program no languages appear. Can you help me solve this problem please?"
,FrostyBob,2012-06-26T20:51Z,"This has a virus!!!! seriously don't download, i'm lucky i caught it. Make sure you guys are scanning everything with avira malewarebytes and kaspersky or your gunna get burned sooner then later on here. PEACE!"
,rebelhyena,2012-06-28T17:25Z,deutschman! You have to upload irish man! I cant find a single good torrent for it or dutch... you seemed to have forgotten dutch
,mattylicious,2012-07-08T16:45Z,"I am new to DL'ing torrents so excuse my ignorance. Once I open the application it gives me a 8112 ""minor error"" but lets me continue.

After I choose my level it gives me a 4112 error and exits the application. I have tried to disconnect from the internet and from spyware, but it doesn't make a difference."
,rahayes12,2012-07-09T03:47Z,"Thank you so much for these wonderful torrents. You are an absolute godsend! If it would not be too much to ask and if you are able, could you put up a rosetta stone turkish preinstalled& speech torrent. That would be awesome. Thanks so much!"
,jnthnpa,2012-07-09T06:49Z,"Look I am seriously confused as shit....I'm not a total noob when it comes to computers, but I have no idea how to do this. PLEASE HELP!!!

As far as I can tell I mounted the ""Spanish_LatinAmerica_PreInstalled.iso"" , but thats where I get lost. You said in the read me directions to ""Copy contents to C: and allow them to merge""...How the heck do I do that (I'm running windows 7)

Also I started off trying to download the other iso versions of all this you had listed on here and immediately started having issues. Then I came across the preinstalled versions and thought that it was probably better. I currently have the Rosetta Stone v3 installed but can not get any further without help.

Look in all honesty I am trying to save money by downloading this and not paying for it cause I need to save what money I can. I'm moving to Costa Rica for 1yr and I leave in less than 2 months. At the moment I only speak just enough Spanish to speak to my cleaning lady and order food at Taco Bell, so this would help me out tremendously. So please from the bottom of my heart I am pleading and begging you to help me.

kthnx!!!

,CrankyAVM,2012-07-26T18:49Z,"Hi EinDeutschMan ...
This looks like it should work flawlessly. Only question is - are you planning to upload Hindi 1-3 with the speech fix anytime soon? Hoping to tackle that after Spanish.

Thanks again!"

,dustheli,2012-09-06T02:34Z,@EinDeutschMan I dowloaded it to my desktop but how do I extract it to default location? (I used utorrent)
,dustheli,2012-09-06T02:42Z,"@EinDeutschMan Nevermind I realize how stupid I am...But I have another question, which do we extract first? Or does it not matter?"
,Heartofthorns,2012-09-08T04:55Z,"@ dustheli
It automatically creates a folder C:/Program Files (x86)/Rosetta Stone/Content (for 64 bit Windows users) when you extract it. It creates the folder if it's not present. If it's present, it extracts, or should extract in that folder. 

In short, in reply to your question, it extracts all stages of the language together on it's own. You just need to click ""Extract"" and you're set."
