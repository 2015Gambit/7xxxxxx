[T],SecTPB,2012-06-09T18:23Z,"@a4nat12
I've actually always been the first to upload, usually 10-30 minutes after airing since I started. When my DVR messed up one day and I went to download it online since I missed it, I realized there were no 720p's even 7 hours after airing, so I decided to start releasing it myself to avoid that problem with this series."

[T],SecTPB,2012-06-09T19:24Z,"@h2ojames
Using DivX is like using a deflated ball to play basketball. I don't even know why anyone would use something that bad. Read the notes I included."

,ra1nycat,2012-06-10T02:50Z,"@lololhkjg This is a .mkv version, not going to work with your ps3. You'll either have to wait/look for an mp4/avi version or convert the file. "
,cptncptn,2012-06-10T06:25Z,"60fps?  Wrong, dude, just wrong."
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-10T06:54Z,"PizzaVampire 

So I take it you're using a mac. 
With Perian installed, I'd suggest the GUI front-end for MPlayer called BMPlayer. VLC VideoLAN Player would be your next best bet after that. 
Unfortunately I'm not too familiar with mac since they're mostly overpriced boxes that break with a lack of compatibility and a raped version of Linux as its OS, but I'd look for a fast H.264 Decoder specifically for mac, like CoreAVC is to Windows."

,Qajs1,2012-06-10T23:20Z,This MKV file was created very poorly. It's like you wanted it to be out in 2 minutes. It is impossible to remux due to the poor encoding. Not seeding.
,Danimal1q2w3,2012-06-11T07:02Z,Audio lags quite badly.... not seeding
,Reecman,2012-06-12T16:22Z,"I had a problem with this file, it wouldn't let me open or modify it and any time i tried it crashes windows explorer. could be random or could be suss, just letting you guys know. i found a way to delete it and now i'll be avoiding this uploader from now on, just to play it safe. Thanks all the same, i appreciate the uploaders on here for their efforts"
,shrubbird,2012-06-13T09:35Z,"Can anyone explain to me why this file, and nearly every other file with the words ""secludedly"" or ""WEB.DL"" in the title, persists in crashing Windows Explorer?  This is getting *really* frustrating, trying to find a file torrent that isn't just a waste of bandwidth for me."
