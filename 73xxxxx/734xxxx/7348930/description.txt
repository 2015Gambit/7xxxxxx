Hello TPB people. This is a DVD rip of one of my own DVDs ripped using WinX Premium. Scanned with AVG, no viruses, enjoy.

"The God Complex" is the eleventh episode of the sixth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, first broadcast on BBC One 17 September 2011. It was written by Toby Whithouse and directed by Nick Hurran.
In the episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) find themselves trapped in what appears to be a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet humans Rita (Amara Karan), Howie (Dimitri Leonidas), Joe (Daniel Pirrie), and the alien Gibbis (David Walliams) who have also appeared in the hotel without any idea how they arrived. The Doctor learns that each hotel room contains the greatest fear of someone who has been in the hotel, and that a minotaur-like creature is feeding off their faith.
