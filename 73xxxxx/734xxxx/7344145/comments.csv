,simon19771,2012-06-11T21:34Z,"Hi, Do you have HHhH by Laurent Binet? Thanks"
,Mic07711,2012-06-11T22:09Z,"Hey bbs, I've been looking for awhile and I was wondering if you have The Real Crash - by Peter Schiff

I've been dying to read it... if you don't, you should check it out yourself if you're into economics."
,raindr0ps,2012-06-11T23:13Z,"When I see {BBS} on a torrent I know it is a decent, no BS torrent.  Thank you very much. 

In this torrent you included ""Uncle John's Bathroom Reader"". I've read one of this series in paperback, now I've got another. Do you have any more of these? Great misc info books to pass the time (among other things) while sitting on the throne."

I don't have an English version yet.I should get it soon and I will upload it :)"
[V],bigbluesea,2012-06-11T23:59Z,"@Mic07711 

I have not received that one yet.It was just recently released.I usually get recent releases in a couple of days to a month after 

I will upload it as soon as I get it"

It's hard for me to say if I do or not.I have many thousands of mobi and ePUB ebooks on my servers and unless I know the exact title of a book to search for,I won't know if I have it or not.

If you know the title(s) ,I can check to see if I have it :)"
,whiskey11,2012-06-12T16:03Z,Thanks BBS :)
,HeartsQuilt,2012-06-14T06:48Z,My bookclub is doing Kashmir Shawl next month.  Any chance you have that?  
,billo07,2012-07-12T13:49Z,"Hi, I'm looking for the Private series by James Patterson - any chance you can up load them if you have access??"
