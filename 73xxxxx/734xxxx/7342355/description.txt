The Forgotten - a dark retelling of the story of Sleeping Beauty

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Hattie Naylor; Full-cast dramatisation.

A young girl emerges from a forest after a nameless war, knowing nothing of where she has come from or where she has been. She finds the local doctor, Charonne, trapped in the briar. After she has freed him he takes her back to his village, where everyone is jittery after the recent conflict, especially as thereΓÇÖs to be a tribunal, and rumour has it that some villagers will be strung up for war crimes. Only the doctor is unconcerned. All he cares about is telling his patient the tale of Sleeping Beauty, as heΓÇÖs desperate for her to remember... but remember what?
