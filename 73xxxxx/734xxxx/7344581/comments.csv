,JimmayN,2012-06-19T03:07Z,No problem. Have fun fixing it up.
,melissakhan80,2012-06-20T01:01Z,Patch and other registration details provided do not work. It shows patch as Virus and throws exception. 
,JimmayN,2012-06-20T05:42Z,"@melissakhan80 the patch is flagged as a ""patcher"" by AVG. If you don't trust it run it in a sandbox or virtual OS. Registration details don't matter anything will work provided the patch ran right. If you want it to run right you'll have to temporarily disable your antivirus or add an exception.

On a side note if you don't see the patch button when you open the patch. Please temporarily revert your theme back to windows classic and change resolution to 1024x768. Also reset screen zoom to 100%."
,user_null,2012-06-22T14:18Z,Work's great man. I've been looking for a program like this for awhile. Thanks!
,slpa,2012-06-25T19:02Z,I dont understand what to do whit the patch plz explain.
,JimmayN,2012-06-28T08:41Z,@slpa install the program then open the patch and press patch. If you don't see a patch button reduce text zoom back to 100%.
,5443,2012-07-02T17:52Z,"Hey, great upload I've been looking for this for months, If you could upload the GM enhanced Diagnostics Add-on That would be Awesome"
,JimmayN,2012-07-05T02:18Z,If you can get the unlicensed add-on send it to me and I'll see what I can do.
,jjkezor,2012-07-30T23:58Z,Thanks for the upload! I would also be very grateful if you could get us the enhanced diagnostics. I don't think there is a separate file to send to you. Just a key to unlock the features. 
,JimmayN,2012-07-31T09:41Z,"No problem. When it comes to enhanced diagnostics, the developing company makes it as a separate purchase for the add-on data files. You can hack scanXL for add-ons and make it say you have enhanced diagnostics but without the data files it's useless."
,JimmayN,2012-07-31T09:46Z,"Scrap the last comment. All possible enhanced diagnostics are automatically enabled, they are GM, Mazda, and Ford."
,sub_std,2012-08-25T18:24Z,"Thx for the upload!
Anyone else experiencing spikes in data-readings, after applying the patch?
To general information, the patch also unlocks the latest available version (3.5.1), if downloaded from website as demo. However, the patch also reintroduce spikes when applied here."
,JimmayN,2012-08-27T02:08Z,"@sub_std I've had people telling me about data spikes. I personally don't have them, but for some reason others do. The fix is simple change your clock year to 2008 before you use the program or run it in a vOS or sandbox with the year at 2008. Only do this if you're having problems otherwise it's a waste of time."
,sub_std,2012-08-27T18:10Z,"did try the date-fix earlier, but it didn't removed the occurance of the spikes.  my impressions about the spikes (from searching the net) is that it is related to bluetooth obd-interfaces, but only with this piece of software. will try a vOS,  if it makes any difference.
btw.  have you access at mhh?  if so,  could you provide an invitation?"
,JimmayN,2012-08-28T12:37Z,Let me know the fix or post it here. Email and I'll give an invitation
,Maplewood,2012-09-17T06:12Z,with item ELM327 and this application would i be able to scan and pinpoint which one of my abs sensors is malfunctioning. 
,JimmayN,2012-09-19T04:01Z,"Yes, you can test it through this program using a variety of methods. Sometimes it'll give you an exact error code instead of a general one but that matters on your car model and make."
