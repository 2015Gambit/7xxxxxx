Didn't see any OBD 2 software on Pirate Bay and the free OBD II software is outdated. So for you people that need to fix your car, find out if a mechanic is ripping you off, or pass emissions testing here's OBD2 software for ELM interfaces.

WORKS With ALL VEHICLES 1990+ With a port
- OBDII ports are mandatory on all vehicles 1995+ in most countries
- Chances are your vehicle will have an OBD port
- Works with most OBD interfaces 
- Use ELM327 interface to be safe as I've tested it with it
- $20 for a ELM327 interface with or without bluetooth any more then that is a RIPOFF
- Buy carefully and search on amazon
