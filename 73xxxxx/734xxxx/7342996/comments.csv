,Prokodile,2012-06-10T18:53Z,"Thanks for the great quality rip, 2HD, glad you still cover this show. Still, why no old-specs (175MB) xvid encodes anymore? There's benefits to releasing in that format too and you did most of the season that way already, why not at least stick with that practice till it's done next week before ditching the old scene way completely? Our only other option lately has been AFG's encodes and their filesizes have been a bit flaky. 

Thanks again and keep up the good job."
