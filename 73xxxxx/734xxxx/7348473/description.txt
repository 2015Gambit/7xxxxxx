The Professional Protection Officer, the succesor to our Protection Officer Training Manual, is a comprehensive training guide and instructional text that covers all of the subjects essential to the effective training of protective officers. This material, now in its eighth edition, has been class-tested for many years and has been the training manual for the International Foundation for Protection Officers (IFPO) since 1988. The new book contains brand new chapters on the most significant issues facing the protection officer today, including Central Alarm Stations, Communications, Surveillance, Access Control, Detection Equipment, Apprehension and Detention Procedures, and Information Security. Written by leading security trainers and educators, The Professional Protection Officer retains the exceptional organization and coverage of previous versions and adds critical updates and fresh pedagogy, as well as hundreds of diagrams, illustrations and self-quizzes.

This new book is tailored for the training and certification needs of first-line security officers and supervisors throughout the private and public security industry.
