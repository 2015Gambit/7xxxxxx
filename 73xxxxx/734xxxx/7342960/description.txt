"An ambitious total-conversion modification for Relic's award-winning Company of Heroes franchise, CoH: Modern Combat will transport players into the midst of a high-tech war between the modern-day Chinese and U.S. militaries. Incorporating all-new doctrines, units, artwork, and maps, Modern Combat will work in tandem with acclaimed CoH gameplay in order to craft the most comprehensive, immersive and enjoyable strategic representation of 21st-century combat possible on the PC."
