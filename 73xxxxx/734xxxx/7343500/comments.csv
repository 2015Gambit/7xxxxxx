,jersson,2012-06-10T16:30Z,Nice upload. Thank's. I do prefer Diskeeper and new vers out now. Perhaps.......
,skulldragon,2012-06-15T00:53Z,"If this torrent includes the FFF's KG for v4.0.95.0 you can download the official v4.0.96.0 installer and use that KG on it instead.

I still say that UD is the best defragger ever!
None can match UD's speed and power!
Why some go for ""freeware"" defraggers if they could just use Windows's own defragger instead? They are super slow too, but at least Windows's consolidates and sets data in the middle of the disk, while most freeware just make things worse, e.g. IObit's SmartDefrag, which freeware version scatters data all around hdd to make things even worse! Then you have to buy the ""pro"" version that ""optimizes"", but actually does the same consolidation as Windows's and still at the same speed.
I don't remember which one it was, but either Diskkeeper or PerfectDisk required 72h to defrag my (90% full) 160GB drive, while UD can defrag my 1TB in less than 5 hours. 0.o


Now, can anybody be a pal and fetch Fraps v3.5.5? :3"
