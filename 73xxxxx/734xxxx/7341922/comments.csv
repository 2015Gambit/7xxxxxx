Either way, thanks for the up, Mr. D."
,wolfymain,2012-06-10T01:22Z,Thanks mate....love this series.  Cheers
[T],MrDowntown,2012-06-10T18:48Z,MuckyMucks - I didnt notice anything with the size. ? But I have nothing to do with the scans I just upload and seed. 
,Tinny_pb,2012-06-12T11:34Z,"The pages are about 1073px wide, which is fine by me.

Page 4 is broken: it has an incorrect file extension. If you use CDisplay to read this CBR, page 4 won't appear. 

To fix it, downloaders will need to open the CBR archive in WinRAR (or some similar program) and change page 4's file extension to JPG."

[T],MrDowntown,2012-06-14T03:49Z,"Page 4 and the rest of the comic opened fine for me in ComicRack, maybe you should re-download"
