The Boys 67 [Dynamite]

The ghosts of the Legends past rise to haunt him, and in a way so do MMs - as he catches up with his daughter and finds out much, much more about her recent mistakes than he bargained for. Meanwhile Hughie investigates the recent tragedy and ends up in an unexpected showdown... with Monkey? The bodycount mounts in part two of The Bloody Doors Off.
