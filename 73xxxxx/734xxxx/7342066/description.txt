The Ed Show, Friday June 8, 2012. On a side note this week was a test run of the Ed Show uploads. Anyway Ed got the night off and Michael Eric Dyson hosted today. Also next week Ed Shultz will have off as well. They discuss Obama and Romney's job gaffes or rather Romney's gaffe and Obama's so called gaffe. White House alleged leak that they attacked Iran's centrifuges. Florida voter purge, Obma's effect on African American support for gay marriage and more.
