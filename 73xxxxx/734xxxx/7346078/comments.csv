For episode 1-2, use this http://subscene.com/subtitles/mad-men-fifth-season-2012/english/556955

For episode 13 use this http://subscene.com/subtitles/mad-men-fifth-season-2012/english/588646

Otherwise good quality"
,djbryson,2012-08-19T01:20Z,F*ckin horrible audio. You suck
,djbryson,2012-08-19T01:33Z,"PS, F*CK mkv.  stupid redundant form of media. Just like Real Player. Remember that shit?"
,nightprowler.,2012-08-22T01:37Z,"RealMedia format is still useful to some of us so I don't knock it.  

Thanks for the upload bzingaz"
,hed_pe11,2012-08-23T07:59Z,is there a reason the last two episodes dont play? my divx player says they are corupted.
,nondoleo,2012-08-29T21:44Z,"Download and use VLC player if you are having trouble.  I never used the subtitles, but I never had any difficulties at all, including the audio.

Good torrent.  Thank you."
