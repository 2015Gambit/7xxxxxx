   Awave Studio is a multi-purpose audio  tool that reads a veritable host  of 
   audio  carrying  file  formats  from  different  platforms,   synthesizers, 
   trackers, mobile  phones. you  name it!  - It  can be  used in a variety of 
   ways: As an  audio file format  converter, an audio  editor, a multi-format 
   sound player, and last but  not least, as a generic  synthesizer instrument 
   editor. It is the swiss army knife for anyone working with digital audio or 
   synthesizers! 
             
   Here are just a few examples of common tasks for Awave Studio: 
   --------------------------------------------------------------             
   Convert different types  of audio files  between more or  less obscure file 
   formats.  
             
   Buy a "sample-CD" (or download  instruments) from then net, then  use Awave 
   Studio to convert it  to a format that  your own synth can  read. Besides a 
   vast array of different synth-formats, it also supports MIDI SDS, and  SCSI 
   SMDI transfers. 
             
   Play MIDI songs that comes  with custom 'instrument banks', or  render them 
   to an  audio clip  (eg. a  MP3) using  the built  in high-quality  software 
   synthesizer. 
             
   Do audio editing tasks such  as resampling, fading in and  out, normalizing 
   amplitudes, applying effects, and much more. 
             
   Use it as an  instrument editor for your  synthesizer, sound card, or  soft 
   -synth plug.
