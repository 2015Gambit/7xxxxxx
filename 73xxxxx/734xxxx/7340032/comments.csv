,fankoosh,2012-06-09T10:08Z,"thanx boobsman , i always prefer rar files than direct iso download , coz it is more stable & reliable to fix it in case error rar is there , but i never faced any trouble downloading & extracting iso from rar files "

,AngryGamer94,2012-06-10T16:10Z,"Thanks for uploading this.I was wondering will this game work if i truncate it because i don't have an ihas burner.

,JFrost22,2012-06-10T20:02Z,I have lt 3.0 and it didn't work for me. I ran it through abgx and it said the topology was blank and it fix it. Then I burned it again and it worked

,Lynkin,2012-06-12T13:47Z,"As always, everything from Boobsman works fine, just burned it yesterday.

1. Pass it through ABGX 1.0.6 (LT 3.0)
2. Burn with iHas (100%) or Truncate (96%) using IMGBURN
3. Play this funny and weird game hauhauahauh!!!"
,Gvarimoto,2012-06-12T13:52Z,"First burn came out perfect, game works very well.


But what an awfull game :P"
,Tyclone,2012-06-13T09:11Z,Have to ask as always. Is this a RF or is it another UP claiming it's RF when it's actually NTSC/U?
,scetopismo,2012-06-13T18:27Z,@boobsman Can you upload Wanted: Weapons of Fate ?
,n808,2012-06-14T07:21Z,"First boobsman game that hasn't worked for me. LT+ 2.01. Samsung DVD. Abgx fixed and stealth verified. KProbe great results. But, won't install and won't play - immediate dirty disc error."
,Biggems22,2012-06-15T00:53Z,Can You Please Upload 'Borderlands Game Of The Year'  The One With All The DLC On It For Xbox360 No One Else Has It
,funkyzero101,2012-06-15T09:48Z,"i dont know how many times i have read the same question over and over again. but i will explain for a final and last time. this is for backup only, only read this if you are backing up and original copy. ok   xgd3 games require around 8.7gb rather than the normal 8.5 a older game takes. do not truncate or overburn as you will get yourself banned and even still you wont be able to play the full game as this only burns 96% - 97% of the game. please read details on liteon ihas 124 drive and updating the firmware to burnermax software. this is the only way to burn 100% of the game and not get yourself banned using a backup copy. also make sure you run every iso through agbx as this will make sure its ok to burn. cheers, peace out."
,n808,2012-06-15T21:51Z,"Thanks, funkyzero101. I should have added that I always use my iHAS BurnerMAX firmware DVD writer, follow all the recommended settings and procedures (abgx, imgburn and lite-on settings), no truncate or overburn, and have not had any problems before this disk (except an occasional bad burn, Kprobe2 detected). This time though, something is not working right. All three attempts fail the same way. It's odd. Maybe the Samsung DVD drive in my Xbox is starting to fail."
,abdul86,2012-06-17T10:18Z,The first 12 sectors of topology data are blank!
,n808,2012-06-21T05:49Z,"Yay, it finally worked. Fourth burn, same settings, but new spindle of Verbatim's. Made in Taiwan. Not great Kprobe results, but installed without any problems this time."
,morganrl,2012-06-23T10:28Z,Can anyone provide me with a full guide on burning and running this game.
,pk2011,2012-07-03T23:24Z,"I have rgh on my xbox360 i have never downloaded a torrent game before, anyone know how to install this game onto external hdd to play, is it just a straight forward copy and paste?"
,warm_brown_fingers,2012-07-07T00:43Z,"pk2001,
1)  Download iso2god.  
2)  download the iso image.  
3)  Run the iso  through iso2god.
4)  Put the GOD (game on demand) into your game directory on your RGH console.  

The new game may not come up right away in your game directory.  I usually have to reboot FSD.  Really depends on your setup.
