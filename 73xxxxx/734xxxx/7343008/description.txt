Times Guide to Hollywood Blockbusters brings you the magic of this multiverse (read, parallel universe) with all its success stories. Unlike all other guides in the market, this one talks only about hits, not misses; about films that need to be seen and savoured, not about those meant to be dismissed as C-grade tripe. Be rest assured, for the generalist out there, each and every title among the 1,000 films listed in these pages deserves a dekko. Simply because this compendium sifts the chaff from the grain, and reviews only films that have towered at the box office or won critical acclaim. For the specialist, there are 15 categories to choose from, making it easier for the diehard action, sci-fi, crime, horror, romance, classic, Oscar film buff to settle down with her staple fare. No desperate flipping, no endless searching, just choose your genre and follow the star rating system to pick your film. With our carefully calibrated rating system that varies from one to five stars, there is no way you can go wrong. While rating our films, we have taken into account the importance of both mass appeal and artistic excellence: the sensibilities of the frontbencher and the fastidious cineaste. So, you could find a Quentin TÃ rantino film sharing the same rating with a David Lean classic
