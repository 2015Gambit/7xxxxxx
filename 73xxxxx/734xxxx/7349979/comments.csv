,lvlegaleagle,2012-06-23T22:44Z,This Torrent DOES NOT HAVE THE KEYGEN as it states and so no use without it or worth downloading it. 
,tophtml,2012-06-28T15:48Z,"@lvlegaleagle, did you shut off your anti-virus before you downloaded this?  I haven't downloaded this but if this download is not contained in a compressed archive the anti-virus software will delete the keygen faster than you can blink your eye."

Don't let that go to your head though because there is plenty shit out there that's loaded up with some nasty bugs just waiting to rape your credit rating."
,ElFlaco-77,2012-09-12T06:18Z,"I've noticed that some people are having trouble understanding how the KEYGEN works. Below, I've modified the initial instructions/notes with the hope of clarifying things a bit. Hope I've accomplished this. If not, let me know.


1.Run the setup

2A. Make sure you use the right PROGRAM/application; ie, Corel WordPerfect Office X6) from the drop-down menu in the Keygen.

2B.use keygen to generate a SERIAL NUMBER, PASTE THIS SERIAL NUMBER when the setup asks for one.

3A.after installation, open any feature..(word perfect, or presentation etc...)

3B. DISCONNECT THE INTERNET to ensure you don't activate the application via the online method.

4. it asks for activation..in OTHER ACTIVATION mode,choose PHONE mode..

5.then get the installation code from there and place it in the keygen.

MAKE SURE YOUR KEY IN KEYGEN MATCHES YOUR KEY IN WORD PERFECT

6. after placing installation code, press ACTIVATION to get the activation code..

7.place the activation code in WordPerfect..THATS IT.!!"
