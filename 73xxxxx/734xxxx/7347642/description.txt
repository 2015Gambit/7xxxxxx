Collected Short Stories of Roald Dahl

This torrent has been bouncing brokenly around the Internet for a few years. The original version consists of 24 mp3 files recorded for some stupid fucking reason at 44100 khz in Mono. Additionally, while the narration is acceptable, it appears to have been a small studio project that has not been released commercially, so a high-quality rip of the original CDs cannot be made. Worse, the OP was such a putz that the stories were buried in each unlabeled file, so that you had to pull up a 120 minute file, and sort of wander until you found the one you wanted. Some even began on one file and ended on another. Finally, the last few seconds of each story had artificial garbling due to lousy encoding practices.

What I have done is open each one in Sound Forge 9, clean up what I could, and create fresh, individual files for each story. I saved them to Stereo 192, but keep in mind the ORIGINALS were 96 Mono, so the quality remains mediocre. In any event, this is the only complete collection of DahlΓÇÖs stories that seems to exist ΓÇô and since they ROCK, you take what you can get. Hopefully, someone will release a high quality commercial set of the complete collection someday. TPB now limits description space, so click on the file listing above to get the story list. I am including the info file from the original torrent, although it contains many flaws.
