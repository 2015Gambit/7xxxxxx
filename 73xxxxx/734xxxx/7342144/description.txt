Description
High definition graphics that utilizes the RETINA DISPLAY.

Play Billiards in a different style; Time Trial, Matrix Mode and 2 Player 15 Ball Mode.

In Time Trial you have a time limit of 4 minutes, in which you have to pocket balls as fast as you can to achieve more score. When you pocket more than one ball back to back, your multiplier will increase and which will boost your score and time.

In Matrix Mode, when you pocket a ball your score will be multiplied by the difference of your previous and current ball number if the current is more than the previous; but if the current is less, then your score is divided by the current ball number. So be careful.

In 2 Player 15 Ball Mode you can compete against your friend.
