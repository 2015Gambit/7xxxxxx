Try off antivirus/firewall

to Re[F]lex.al
You are from Kosovo? Kosovo is not Albania, Kosovo is Serbia.
Copy to install_dir/platform/ anyone *.jpg file and rename it to avatar.dat. avatar.dat is your avatar picture."

,OfficialTroll,2012-06-21T05:33Z,"Hey bruss, great torrent, I have one question though.  It seems I live in a country with no servers and when I connect to a server in another country (including yours), I get booted for having to high ping.  My question is, is there a way to fix this and do you know of any servers with no ping caps?  Thanks."

,OfficialTroll,2012-06-22T00:18Z,"Bruss
Thanks, I can hop servers until I find one, or my ping drops.  But yeah, too bad there are no good servers on the other side of the pond!"
,OfficialTroll,2012-07-02T08:08Z,"Hey Bruss,
I was just wondering if it was possible to raise the ping cap on your servers.  It would be nice to raise it to 180 or 200 because I am right on the edge."
,bruss.aka.durka9,2012-07-02T09:47Z,"to OfficialTroll
Sorry i can't."
