,samiov,2012-06-12T23:32Z,I've copied the app in apps folder but then where I put dictionnaries?? because when I launch it it asks me to download dictionnaries...
,weebey7,2012-06-13T03:36Z,"You need to keep the app in the original folder entitled ""Ultralingua"", which includes the subfolder ""Dictionaries"" contains the dictionary files. That subfolder is where the app is going to look for dictionary files.
Otherwise you can try double-clicking the dictionary files to install them in the app."
