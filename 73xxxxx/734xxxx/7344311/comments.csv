,Tstart,2012-06-11T20:03Z,"No you can´t. Garmin BlueChart G2 is only sold on SD cards, not as mapsource installs.

So it´s all or nothing, but a SD card is cheap :)"

Many years since i used torrents and cracks."
,Tstart,2012-06-22T19:04Z,"just drag GMAPSUPP.IMG and drop it on gimgunlock.exe, a command prompt opens and the GMAPSUPP.IMG is unlocked in seconds.

copy GMAPSUPP.IMG to a folder named Garmin on your SD card.

Done"
