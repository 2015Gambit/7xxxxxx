Intro:
-----
Project IGI is a strictly single-player game with 14 missions that are often large and complex, but they're divided into smaller, more manageable objectives. Unfortunately, there's no way to save your game during a mission, and even on the lowest difficulty setting, some missions can be quite hard, and they will inevitably require you to restart from scratch a number of times before you achieve success. Since you'll typically be infiltrating military installations, you'll run into swarms of guards, many of whom stand waiting in towers with their sniper rifles. Death awaits at every corner. The abundance of guards is necessary because the game's enemy artificial intelligence is spotty if not downright poor, as enemies sometimes stand obliviously when you kill one of their comrades, who is only a few feet in front of them. Also, the game sometimes cheats by making guards appear out of thin air or from buildings that you've already cleared.
