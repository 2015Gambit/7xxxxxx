Hi agai twentyforty.. as always, it's good to see you here :-)

I was just wondering if you were open to requests at the moment? If so, I'm looking for a version of the movie 'Snabba Cash' that isn;t a massive file and that has English subtitles.. I've been looking for it for a while but so far, no luck.

So if you have the movie and the time, I would love to see it.. but either way, hope you have a great week and thanks again for all the fantastic uploads.

Cheers""

That's why. Good and civilized people are rare and supported. My personal feelings came as next.  "

,bktheman,2012-06-14T17:25Z,"i thought in here.. specially when around 2040..
supportive equals to the time a guy stays for seeding...
not the good old english welcome...
& run out the backdoor with the movie in their bag"
,Snadoosh,2012-06-15T01:57Z,Good movie! thanks as usual 2040!

,banzai014,2012-06-19T11:20Z,"What is the likelihood of you releasing a borgias season torrent?

12gb for 720p is a bit ridiculous compared to your awesome 2gb rips lol"

my account is blocked in sceneunderground...

Can you please check on it?"
[V],twentyforty,2012-06-21T17:28Z,"@dkhere: You should ask earlier. I have not seen you there for a while and you must be aware how accounts were erased from any private site if user doesn't log-in and four people who have problems with logging-in have these problems month ago and they are all resolved - by deleting browser cookies.
However, I would PM one friend to look into.

But you should contacted me not here and so late but on my gmail account. Please, do latter part from now on."

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7373487/The.Borgias.Season.2.HDTV.480p.H264

1.86 GB of my encodes weekly uploaded to SU."
[V],twentyforty,2012-06-22T12:40Z,"@dkhere: Your account was auto-disabled after ""Ratio Too Low"" and System warnings.

Dry201 enabled your account, but please - it cannot be tolerated in the future. You must either seed back or try to seed back keeping downloaded torrents active for a long(er) periods.

On ANY private site ""Cleaning after downloads"" and ""Hit & Run"" always ends with a permanent ban.

So - keep torrents active or make one of the measures against ""Ratio Low"" come true - as I explained on SU  Forum."
,dkhere,2012-06-25T05:25Z,"@2040: So inorder to keep the ratio, i need to upload also right?"
,Fangular,2012-06-26T15:01Z,"Twentyforty - thank you SO much!! Am so excited and very grateful - you're a legend - thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!"
,gaaraisgod3,2012-06-27T03:37Z,Martin Scorsese is a great fan. He's getting it released in the US as Easy Money.
,resmith,2012-08-14T15:13Z,A V 9. Has English srt files included. Thanks for the upload.
