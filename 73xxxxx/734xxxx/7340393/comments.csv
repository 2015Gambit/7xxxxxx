All I need to do is find them and cut&paste the names of these songs onto the better quality songs. Thanks for the names at-least penzlink, now I can be lazy about what I need to type into the ""rename"" box. Peace."
,penzlink,2012-06-18T10:57Z,"@zero14 you find 320kbps for better quality, i have this in VBR because high quality means bigger file size."
,Xero14,2012-06-18T21:36Z,"I don't know about other leeches but personally I don't mind waiting on the bigger file sizes. Especially if it means I get to be lazier because I don't like searching for these 100 songs one by one for better sound quality. This only took me about 5 minutes to download, I wouldn't mind it taking 10 minutes or even 20 minutes. It'd be awesome if you uploaded the non-compressed songs on pirate bay as well :)   ~jus sayin ^_^"
,penzlink,2012-06-19T02:32Z,"@zero14 i'm not a fan of 320kbps CBR because mp3 is already a lossy compression, for me VBR is the best because it's not too big, the highest quality would still be flac and only few were uploading maybe due to the file size. Even iTunes sell songs in m4a which is also lossly compressed."
,denbans,2012-07-01T11:51Z,I dont know what Xero14 is complaining about. Quality's more than good enough for me. It's great! Thank's penzlink !!! Gonna seed this for a long time.
,penzlink,2012-07-01T15:00Z,"welcome @denbans, maybe he will understand when he becomes uploader too."
,moe411,2012-07-09T08:14Z,number of songs only 35bytes
,moe411,2012-07-09T08:22Z,my bad..didnt read
,vizum,2012-07-27T04:59Z,"Just wondering, what's the point of the tracks that can't be played?"
,hanrysr,2012-07-30T14:59Z,i cant get a list of the songs
,arcadia,2012-09-19T11:21Z,"seriously, you guys are full of it. Most of this ""music"" is elevator/mall quality straight from the original cut - and you want 320kps+?

That would make sense if you were listening to acoustic or vocal of a quality where it made a difference, but for this stuff you'll just be filling up your iPods faster"
