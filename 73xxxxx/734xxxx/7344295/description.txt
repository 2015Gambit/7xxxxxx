This is my first official album, Third-I. it is a mix of conscious music ranging from Reggae, throat singing, hip-hop, acoustic punk & more.. 

I music is I life. I work for Jah Most I Rastafari. I wish to share this project with Jah people, so here you go!!! Please support I if you like it, buy pickn' up your own copy via itunes or something... I live with little to no money, so all the help goes a long way. 

 I write, record & produce all the tracks unless otherwise noted.
