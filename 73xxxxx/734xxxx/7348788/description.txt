Windows 8 Release Preview 64 bit  lite without metro applications by nil


(iso 2gb) after (installation size 4.5gb)
as name suggest there r no metro application
it doesn't mean it becomes win 7 there r lots of other features present in win 8
this iso is for ppl who hate metro and  want to try win 8 on small drive <6gb

os build from original Windows 8 Release Preview 64-bit
u will not need key as i slip-streamed it (Product Key = TK8TP9JN6P7X7WWRFFTVB7QPF)
Unattended - just give drive to install 6gb is sufficient
os will install in 15-20 min as compare to full original os takes 45min-1hr
drivers and services are untouched

component removed  are

use it own ur own risk , do not install as ur main os, try 1st in vmware/virtual box,
install side by ur main os , working os.

please do not blame  me if anything goes wrong, this os i made for myself , its my 10-15 hrs hard work
i am sharing with you, feel free to try, may not like all the ppl,

though i kept IE, better to use Firefox ,chrome,utorrent  preferably portable versions, as u install new os , change os
you do not have to start from scratch, install-add ons-extenstions-bookmarks , all the things will be intact.
