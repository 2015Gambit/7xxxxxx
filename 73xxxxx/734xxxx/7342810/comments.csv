,ClrD00r,2012-06-30T10:18Z,Running a batch file ? The game is only 756MB long ? Kinda suspicious. Let's see this when the download is over.

All it did was force my graphics driver to crash."

,Xlander11,2012-09-15T20:05Z,Very Good! but very short... :(
,andreyyshore,2012-09-17T16:25Z,"The only problem I found with this is that the bubble model used in the developer commentary version of the game seems to be missing. There's a large red text saying ""ERROR"" replacing each bubble and it's difficult to aim at them correctly in order to hear the commentary."
