,rmmartins,2012-06-13T04:52Z,"I'm seeding, but keep in mind that my upload rate is not very good."
,Rapture1988,2012-06-13T07:35Z,Thank you
,drcodu,2012-06-13T07:47Z,I'm completely stuck at 6.2%. :/
,rmmartins,2012-06-13T08:01Z,"I'm still here, have a bit of patience. :)"
,nokles,2012-06-13T08:20Z,Anyone knows how to seed without downloading? I mean before you finish downloading  I ask this because i want to seed a mac game for my bro but i dont want to download it to my pc
,dotenzie,2012-06-13T10:55Z,If someone downloaded this please upload another torrent for better and faster downloading
,dotenzie,2012-06-13T11:08Z,"@nokles Seeding means you share file that you downloaded with others, so if you didn't downloaded the movie you can't seed it"
,Noriul,2012-06-13T11:09Z,@nokles just increase your upload and decrease your download speed
,dotenzie,2012-06-13T12:17Z,"DON'T SEED JUST UPLOAD ANOTHER TORRENT FOR FASTER DOWNLOADING, GOD WHY??"
,drcodu,2012-06-13T14:50Z,"Seeders: 35
Leechers: 1066
That's a pretty scary ratio. Anyone who is done downloading, please make an extra torrent."
,Rapture1988,2012-06-13T15:25Z,Im at 37.6%
,dotenzie,2012-06-13T16:04Z,When my download is finished I will upload another torrent since nobody cares and wants to do that
,BoxeeMove,2012-06-13T16:21Z,This is something you want to buy and support the people that made this film and the independent developers that made the games. SUPER MEAT BOY!!!

,JamesIGTM,2012-06-13T16:27Z,"Hi Guys,

My name is James Swirsky - I’m one of the two people who made Indie Game: The Movie.   Myself and Lisanne Pajot spent our last two years working on this film.  We kept a pretty active blog about the production of the film on our site (www.indiegamethemovie.com).

We are a two person team, making the film completely independently.  And we want to keep on making films for your enjoyment.

If you like the movie, consider purchasing it over on iTunes, Steam or DRM-Free (in a variety of encodes) directly from us over at www.IndieGameTheMovie.com.  You can also get a copy to share with a friend if you’d like to.

Thanks for taking an interest in our film.

-James Swirsky
Co-director/Maker of Indie Game: The Movie "
,dotenzie,2012-06-13T17:15Z,"@JamesIGTM Dear James, some of us don't have PayPal, Amazon or any of the buying services supported in our country. I, personally, would buy a copy if I had credit card. You guys are great and I'm really sorry to make it this way. You've done a great job! Thanks! "
,barik,2012-06-13T17:32Z,"Mr. Swirsky,

Thanks for your very personal comments. In particular, I was incredibly impressed with tone of your comment, in that you did not threaten or otherwise berate the Pirate Bay community as many larger corporations are quick to do.

I have decided to purchase the movie in non-DRM format as a result (through Amazon payments), and I encourage others to do the same.

We should do our part to support the indie community, when we can do so."
,Nundkai,2012-06-13T17:54Z,"everybody in my peer list is at 41.8%, I suppose that means we are royally screwed for the foreseeable future? Regardless, thanks for the up!"
,japirat,2012-06-13T18:01Z,"@James Swirsky

I'd like to take it from the AppStore but it's not available for Poles."
,acmd,2012-06-13T18:29Z,"I have 4KB/s and 42% in ~6 hours, keep seeding please :) "
,dotenzie,2012-06-13T18:49Z,"@rmmartins Since you have the movie downloaded, can you make another torrent or maybe torrents (depends on what you want)?"
,rmmartins,2012-06-13T23:58Z,@dotenzie what's the point? my upload rate is already full-throttle!
,rmmartins,2012-06-14T00:00Z,"Okay, so now it seems it has finally taken momentum... sorry for the low speed, everyone. I did my best. Also, if you liked the movie, go to the website and buy it. Support these guys, they deserve it. You have the choice; make the right decision. Cheers!"
,r_ricco,2012-06-14T00:10Z,Can anyone upload the subtitles of this video? 
,Shurik3n,2012-06-14T05:21Z,"@JamesIGTM
Thx man. Just bought it."
,dotenzie,2012-06-14T10:21Z,"yeah, can you upload subtitles?"
,rmmartins,2012-06-14T15:01Z,Subtitles are embedded in a different MP4 (which I didn't download yet). I'll see what I can do.
,Linkzz,2012-06-15T02:19Z,"@James Swirsky I was just going to rip this and have a watch, but the nature you handled this and because of your comment, I bought it for my collection."
,wryme,2012-06-15T04:24Z,"Aw jeez. I feel terrible downloading this but . . . damn I don't have any money right now. :(

Yes I know that sounds entitled, but I promise I'll buy it when I start working again! Which should be soon. Sorry James. :("
,valentim,2012-06-15T10:24Z,Please. I need subtitles on english or any other language...
,GLunPy,2012-06-15T14:34Z,Waiting for the subs too! Thank you very much!

,wesllei,2012-06-16T05:48Z,"@JamesIGTM
I bought the Steam version and I'm very happy with it."
,AnimalLeopard,2012-06-16T14:36Z,"@JamesIGTM I bought it because of your great comment and I'm... very happy about it. Such a great documentary and for only 6,99€, it is not a steal."
,Galaad1,2012-06-17T15:48Z,Downloaded this torrent. Enjoyed it a lot. Saw it costs less than 7 euros and bought it on iTunes to reward the authors. Thanks for this great and inspirational documentary!
,anonyboy,2012-06-20T07:20Z,"After watching this I have only really learned 1 thing: Indie developers are very depressed frustrated neurotic obsessive compulsive people that derive joy only from 100% praise and take every bug and flaw in their work as a deep personal failure that may or may not be worth killing themselves over.

and @JamesIGTM who seems much like Johnathan blow in that he's probably reading every comment posted on here... what the fuck is with the repeated footage of the guy on the beach with a metal detector? That made no sense."
,D4rth_Man7iz,2012-06-21T01:50Z,"Can anyone share Spanish subs? Were released today, including others too.

Thanks ;)"
,TheodoreVG,2012-06-21T16:19Z,"@James: I also torrented this first to see if it was any good, and since it was I bought it on Steam. Not because of your comment (because it wasn't posted back then), but because I'm not an asshole. Regretfully, I didn't think of buying it from your own website, but oh well :(

@anonyboy You also seem to be much like Jonathan Blow, appearing to post your garbage on several torrents. Although not because you have created something others enjoy, but only to troll. My condolences for being you. Suicide might be the only remedy for your frustration, mate."
,anonyboy,2012-06-22T07:32Z,"@TheodoreVG unlike the developers featured in this film, I don't require complete praise from strangers to resist suicide. And I only posted that comment on 3 torrents. That's hardly several. Maybe your inability to count will lead your suicide?"
,crash87,2012-06-28T04:02Z,Anyone can upload spanish subs plz?
,pinguin_,2012-06-28T07:03Z,"@JamesIGTM I Just bought it, thanks for this great history. =)"
,shrimpdu,2012-07-06T04:03Z,"Mr Swirsky...I torrented this, watched it, then bought it immediately from your site.  Fantastic work, I loved every minute of it.  You could really tell how much of a labour of love your filmmaking is.

This is the first time I've ever digitally purchased a movie, and I signed up for a Piratebay account JUST so I could post this message.

Everyone, if you want great documentaries like this to keep being made, support it!"
,krosfyah,2012-07-11T07:19Z,"@James Swirsky

As others like shrimpdu have posted, i have created an account here specifically to say thank you - both for your humble and polite message, and to also to thank you and Lisanne for your hard work, energy and committment in producing what i thought was a fantastic documentary.

I, like others, have now paid for the DRM-free version as a means to offer my support and gratitude for your blood sweat and tears in producing this awesome film. 

I am happy, willing and committed to support independent efforts like this, and hope others on TPB will also consider doing so - we need to pull together and support indepent efforts like this to keep this sort of film-making alive. 

Thanks again and look forward to your guys' next project."

,winglessh,2012-07-23T08:32Z,"Hi Jim,

you, lisanne, and Jim Guthrie made an incredible movie!  I bought two copies after watching this -- one for myself and one for my game developer friend.

I'm not really a gamer or a developer, but I think this movie speaks to anybody who has ever poured their heart into a project.  way to go!"
,iandays,2012-07-25T13:12Z,"@JamesIGTM

I bought your film today directly from your website figuring it'd be the best way to support your project. Then I find out your only serving a 2.6Gb file for 1080p. Now I regret not purchasing it from Steam or iTunes which are both serving ~4Gb encodes. If you had a little bit of pride in your work shouldn't you be offering the best quality encode with a direct purchase? Should I really have to resort to torrents to provide what you should have in the first place?"
,JamesIGTM,2012-07-25T22:32Z,"Hi Everyone, 

Thank you so much to everyone who has watched the movie, liked it and supported it through a purchase or a gifting (at http://www.indiegamethemovie.com).  It really means a lot to us and makes a huge difference.

@Landays:  The current version up on the site is simply a much more efficient encode.  The Steam version is it's size b/c of the packaged-in extra content (all of which is also available on our site) and other app overhead.  It contains the exact same file that is available from our site.  Bigger isn't always better when it comes to encodes.  The latest version is a very very good 1080P that has the added bonus of downloading faster :)"
