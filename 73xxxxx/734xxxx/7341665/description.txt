This is a debut album from rising progressive trance producer 'Timewave'. Back in 2009, Mistiquemusic label bosses Michael & Levan and Stiven Rivic held a competition to remix their track Invisible Children. Then 31 year-old Antti Ervasti was one who answered the call, eventually getting his remix signed. Two months later, Rivic asked the Finn if heΓÇÖd be interested in doing an album. The result was 'Solar System', Timewave's debut album. 
This album contains some superb progressive trance tune along with some trancy breaks that will lift you from earth and send you on the dreamy journy. You will literally experiance the shivers running down your body.
