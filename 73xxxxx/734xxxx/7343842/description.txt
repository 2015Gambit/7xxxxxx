per IIMDB:  "Evokative of the Roaring Twenties, "Emily" is an erotic coming-of-age film featuring meticulous period detail and music. The sharp class distinctions of British society are blurred by the universal nature of sexual desire."

per me:  in the days before internet porn, this was what a teenager looked at on HBO late night or Cinemax (aka "Skinamax".  Koo Stark is a believable teenager trying to blossom before our eyes as a woman.  Famous for dating Prince Andrew, it was inevitable that the Queen was not going to allow a softcore porn actress into the royal family.  This movie harkens back to a simpler time for me and I enjoyed it enough to want to share it.  Thanks to the supplier of the DVD from which I ripped this in iPod/iPad compatible format.  It is quite viewable on all platforms using VLC and should work OK with other media players as well.  I can only certify that it works for me with VLC on both Mac & PC.  I ripped it with Handbrake with Web Optimized, variable bitrate averaging 1000 kbps, 640x480, H.264, AAC.

Enjoy!
