I was just wondering if you were open to requests at the moment? If so, I'm looking for a version of the movie 'Snabba Cash' that isn;t a massive file and that has English subtitles.. I've been looking for it for a while but so far, no luck.

So if you have the movie and the time, I would love to see it.. but either way, hope you have a great week and thanks again for all the fantastic uploads.

Cheers,
Olivia"

[V],twentyforty,2012-06-16T17:36Z,"It is VBR (Variable Bit-rate). not CBR (Constant Bit-Rate). It sounds better than twice higher bit-rate MP3 and for years I use it in all encodes. It can go down to 56k - but not below that. Sounds perfect if appropriate playback system is used (I recommended for years) - DivX AAC fed to home-stereo with cheap cable from line-output of computer to line-input of nice home Hi-Fi or - good headphones.

If one use plastic China-made PC sound equipment for 12.99$ or use ffdshow - better is to stay away from my encodes.

No one force nobody to download something."
