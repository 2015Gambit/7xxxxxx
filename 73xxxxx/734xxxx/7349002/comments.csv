How do you speed up seeding settings?"
,TxJag,2012-06-13T05:49Z,Bookeek: What do you mean?
,Bookeek,2012-06-13T14:37Z,"I'm using utorrent to seed my posts and it's very slow - mostly less than 10kb/s. 

sometimes it will increase to over 50, but I do not understand why. How do I make it consistently seed at over 100 kb/s? I have no problem downloading at rates of over 400/kb/s. 

do you know what to do? "
,TxJag,2012-06-13T17:34Z,"Well I seed at 75 kb/s. which as fast as it'll ever go, occasionally it may touch 80+ but only for a blink. It's really all about who is seeding after us. I will always double post my uploads hence the demonoid file included."
,TxJag,2012-06-13T18:28Z,it's also limited to what your ISP will allow to come in and out bandwidth wise. My speed says 54 mbps but on a popular file that's been seeded well then ill only download MAX 600 kbps and depending on size will have it rather quickly though.
