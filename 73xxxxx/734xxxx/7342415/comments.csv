[V],TheExecutive,2012-06-10T14:01Z,These political talk show torrents are either too large or poorly seeded after only 1 day.  This is both.
[V],TheExecutive,2012-06-10T17:51Z,"2 people are still stuck at 2% done. They must be waiting for the original uploader to return.... Still it's Mike Malloy.  Although Mike is a progressive, he is more annoying than most radio talkers.  

Only on a Sunday would I be trying to download something, when there's nothing else going on...."
