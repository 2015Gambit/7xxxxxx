MotorHEAT is a driving game where the aim is to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out. Your car is on auto pilot so you only need to worry about moving the car left or right on the five lanes of a never ending motorway. To help you reach the checkpoint faster you have a limited amount of boost which will turbo charge your car to insane speeds.

The motorway has other traffic to hinder your progress and colliding with any vehicles will result in a Burnout style slow motion crash. While they are not as impressive as said game, it is still pretty cool and the delay will give you time to catch your breath as well as deducting 10 seconds from your time. There are a few designs of vehicles to avoid, you whizz past them so it is almost unnoticeable, but be careful of the white vehicles as they will change lanes with little warning.
