,Furious1964,2012-07-09T02:51Z,Can you provide 3.5.5 please? Of has it not been cracked yet?
,Capnmaf,2012-07-09T23:12Z,"Torrent works great.

Had a quick question though: is there a way to really minimize the size of the video files? An almost 7 minute video was 10GB. I have a program to compress the files (got it down to 1.9GB), but it's quite time consuming and just seems inefficient.

And if there isn't a real good way to get the files to not be so space consuming, is there another good program to use for game capture?"
,The_Damz,2012-07-11T23:12Z,Is there a specfic video converter that you would recommend?
,BipolarHernandez,2012-07-12T07:58Z,Downloaded this and immediately got a popup from AVG saying this was infected with a win32/cryptor. 
,Matchlock,2012-08-09T04:23Z,"Works great!  I tried another torrent for a later version of Fraps, but it wouldn't record my desktop; only in-game.  This one works much better!

I'd totally buy Fraps if it wasn't so expensive.  $37 just for FPS and video recording? no thanks"
