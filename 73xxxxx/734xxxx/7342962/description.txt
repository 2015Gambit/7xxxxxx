something to know... ---- after installing , if it says something about a missing .dll file ( it happened to me ) , just search it in the net , and just get it installed and fixed... if you have trouble with that , let me know the .dll file name , and I will give you the link to fix it.. ( that's how I did it ) it happens because of a problem in your PC's visual C++ ... not a big deal.. easily resolvable. sometimes you will not face this problem too... Just gave a solution to the people who might have a problem like that... :D
