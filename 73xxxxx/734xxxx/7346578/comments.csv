,theRealKarmine,2012-08-23T03:26Z,"is ""shit"" good? i mean ""taking a shit"" is good....depending where you take it.  

and what exactly does ""fucked up"" mean?  fuck means ""to strike"" and ""up"" is the opposite of down (but what if down is actually up and white is actually black?)......so what does it really mean?

should we ask philosoraptor?"
