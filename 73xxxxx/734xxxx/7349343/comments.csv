,IakKereshna,2012-06-16T19:53Z,"Hey, does coloUrs and mayhem - Universe A have the corrected tracks for Purple Tyrant and Indigo Archer? replacement tracks *have* been added to the bandcamp site, and are for free, I just wanna know if I need to grab them separately from this."
,Pyrogoeth,2012-06-18T09:38Z,"Yep, these are the replacements, not the original plagiarized ones."
,stationaryghost,2012-07-08T00:10Z,Would it be possible for you to upload Volume 9 seperately? There's no torrents for it and I can't find a direct download anywhere!
,Pyrogoeth,2012-08-01T20:01Z,"@stationaryghost You know you can just download PART of the torrent right? Go to the files list, select everything but 9, click ""Do not download"".

@everyone I'm not going to update this torrent until AFTER Solo Album Month, but I'll probably start uploading solo torrents. When it's all over I'll clear those out and combine it all."

Are you or is anyone else working on a FLAC compilation torrent?"
