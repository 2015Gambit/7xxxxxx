Door-to-door salesman Duke Jarrett has just knocked on the wrong door. He's about to be set up and shipped out, the result of an afternoon's dalliance with the Governor's seductress wife. Duke's 9-to-5 turns into 5-to-10... but not to worry. He'll have lots of time off for riotous behavior when he's Doin' Time the hilarious way with the nuts, loons and knuckleheads of John Dillienger's Penitentiary.

At JDP the music rocks out, the three square meals a day are cooked to order and the women are (sometimes) willing. JDP is Club Med becoming Club Fed, as in penitentiary. Sounds like the inmates are running the asylum, right? No, it's Animal House meets the big house; no one runs this joint - not even Mongo, the pen's new warden.

Mongo's a man of such resolute misdirection he couldn't find water if he fell out of a boat. But that won't stop him from unleashing his scheme to clean up the prison. On the other hand, the inmates will. They've got a plan to ward off the warden and free their framed buddy Jarrett that's goofy enough to schlock your socks off!

In the uproarious tradition of National Lampoon's Animal Houe and Police Academy, Doin' Time unleashes a cast crammed with crazies for an all-out assault on your funnybone. Jeff Altman (of American Hot Wax and many TV roles) stars as Jarrett and Richard Mulligan (Micki & Maude, S.O.B., Little Big Man, and TV's Soap) is the ramrod Mongo. Others in the more-the-merrier ensemble include John Vernon (the sinister Dean Wormer of Animal House), Jimmy (Good Times) Walker, Colleen Camp (Police Academy 2: The First Assignment), Muhammad Ali himself in the ringside pep talk and more!

Set aside time for Doin' Time and discover, as the wacked-out comics of JDP zanily prove, that laughter is the greatest escape of all!
