,ShinigamiSam3455,2012-06-16T18:07Z,"Alright, I'm having a problem... I mounted the .iso file and ran the Setup.exe, but I couldn't find the part where you insert the key... help?"
,OgaPunch,2012-06-16T18:53Z,dose anyone have a key
,grvtyne0k,2012-06-16T19:13Z,"@ShinigamiSam3455 It's in the first step of the setup, after you pressed ""Install"". It asks for a product key. Keys are in Serials.txt. Install the game, close the installation and replace the halo.exe file (in Program Files) by the one into the folder ""HALO.EXE PATCHED"". Run the Halo CE Crack.exe and the Patch.exe and it should work."

e bom seria se ele tivesse um patch atualizado!"

,mzisette,2012-08-25T15:08Z,"@Danimals345 It's the file you use to launch the game, but not a shortcut. Some people have it so that it shows every type of file ext. at the end of every type of file (besides folders)."
