,zappaz123,2012-06-09T21:15Z,One of my dreams was to be a treasure hunter. Sailing and diving for blackbeard's gold in the carribean (instead of living in a neurotic city).
[V],bigbluesea,2012-06-09T21:38Z,So you want to be a Pirate Zappaz
,zappaz123,2012-06-09T23:30Z,"Well - There's allso gold and perls on Pirate Bay - but it's not quite the same, allthough i allways wear a big hat and eyecover when here."
[V],bigbluesea,2012-06-10T00:03Z,"Wow,you really get into it don't you

I have a Blue Macaw(They're native here), but I don't put it on my shoulder.I don't want shit all over my back and it's got a really big beak probably could take my ear off"
