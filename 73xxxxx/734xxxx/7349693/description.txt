  When San Diego noise-pop duo Brandon Welchez and Charles Rowell released their attitude-laden debut Summer of Hate in 2009, many people highlighted the schizophrenic nature of their sound. On the Berlin-recorded Endless Flowers, itΓÇÖs hard not to feel that the circles on Welchez and RowellΓÇÖs thematic Venn diagram have been forced together this time around to produce maximum overlap. This self-produced offering has a sunnier disposition than its predecessors, and the recurrent "flower" motif - symbolic of love, death and fragile beauty - provides the album with lyrical focus and continuity. Crucially, their bold decision to expand to a five-piece also delivers sonic cohesion, allowing one propulsive, hook-filled tune to bleed seamlessly into the next. Recalling the Cure at their most carefree, both the bittersweet ΓÇ£Endless FlowersΓÇ¥ and the crunching slice of power pop that is ΓÇ£Sunday (Psychic Conversation #9),ΓÇ¥ are the kind of euphoric set-openers designed to deliver broad appeal. Pleasingly, itΓÇÖs a guise that fits them as perfectly as their sunglasses.
