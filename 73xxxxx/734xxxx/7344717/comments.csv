,DaftMink,2012-06-11T17:28Z,It's annoying how one group releases the original copy then 3 or more release the exact same copy with there own name on it.
,hardtobelieve,2012-06-11T17:28Z,a/v please? btw thanks for uploading!
,pinzmoo,2012-06-11T18:38Z,"This is why I like froggie100, he actually puts good info about the problems in the video. 
v7a6 def watchable. as far as the missing footage part of that missing footage is the very end, which makes this up not really worth it. But ty froggie100 you actually deserve that green skull unlike 2 other groups i will not mention."

,sharahkm,2012-07-06T23:26Z,I heard that this is a really great cartoon..i was searching for better quality and i found it at madagascar.datasatlink.net so i will watch it tonight. can't wait :)
,legio9,2012-07-15T05:18Z,"Now should I be grateful for a piece of shit that is of sub standard quality with even missing part?

No, when a dog shit on my lawn, i do not say thank you, i kick him in the butt.

For cry sake, have some form of accomplishment and ""professionalism"" to upload at least something of quality!
For crying out loud; with the quality of camera out there (for dirt cheap), how complicated is it to have decent quality AND complete?

Editing, any monkey can do that.

So nope, thanks and gratitude are for things that actually worth it; I do not reward ""mediocrity""."
,ScottyD7421,2012-07-20T11:06Z,"Ummmam i wrong in asking why would you bother to upload something that you know is missing part of the movie? I appreciate the work you guys do and do realise that as a person who downloads only my only contribution is seeding and you guys do all the hard stuff but i just can't figure why anyone would be that desperate they would download an incomplete movie?

Just my thoughts"
,IggyM,2012-07-25T19:30Z,"WTF for the cam!!!???
