Either download the original 26k or wait for a proper release."
,shop3001,2012-06-12T06:16Z,hey can youn get miles from home with megan good and thanks for the uploadsss
,rcr29budcar,2012-06-12T06:42Z,"I hate how you can't get a good review for the movies that are still in theaters when they're uploaded!  Most of the people I see on here anymore expect it to be bluray quality. When its not, they give terrible reviews. Its not going to be perfect by no means! It is a BOOTLEG video! What people want are good reviews that tell them if these uploads are good enough to actually watch and be able to see and understand it!  So many people give terrible reviews because the quality doesn't look like a retail dvd that you have no idea if its what your looking for or not!  Bottom line, its not going to be perfect! Since its a bootleg video, if its watchable and you can see and understand it, it should get a better review than what most of you people give!  I'm not looking for a review of a hi def copy! I'm looking for a review of a bootleg movie! So if your looking for a dvd quality movie, and thats what your comparing uploads like this to, then don't bother with your lame ass bad review! It doesn't help those of us who actually get it!"
,rtgiez101,2012-06-12T16:04Z,I have had some problems with the audio playing...
,Fritz.,2012-06-12T22:27Z,"@rcr28budcar ... ive been downloading movies for years, and there is a difference between a good cam and a piece of crap cam.

...dont let that get in the way of your ignorance though."
,rcr29budcar,2012-06-12T23:57Z,@Fritz....I won't! And thanks for the wonderful advice.  You've enlightned me.  lol
,rcr29budcar,2012-06-12T23:59Z,"Btw, my ignorance knows no bounds! So I won't let it get in the way!  lmao."
,rcr29budcar,2012-06-13T00:06Z,"Oh yeah Fritzie, its 29budcar, not 28. Just thought i'd let my ignorance run wild and point that out. "
,rcr29budcar,2012-06-13T00:29Z,"@Fritz....You know what, I know i've posted too many times in a row, and I apologize to those who have meaninful posts. I know this really is ignorant of me to do, but the more I think about your ""ignorant"" comment, the madder I get! I didn't say anywhere that there was a difference in a quote, ""good copy"" and a quote, ""piece of crap copy""!  I stated that I wanted reviews compared to and based on bootleg movies, not reviews compared to dvd copies, which is what seems to be happening more and more!  So the next time someone gives their opinion on something, and you have nothing useful to add to it, mind your own goddamn business!  Now i'm done!  Again, I apologize to those of you having to read this BS, I normally don't do this, I just had to get this off my chest. Too many times I have had douche bags respond to posts with provocative things to say, and I always ignore it and mind my own business. I guess its just my time of the month or something.  Anyway, Fritzie, since you don't want me to let my ignorance get in the way of something like that, I will take your advice and show my ignorance in full by finishing this useless post off by saying kiss my ass!"

,spanish_ruler,2012-06-20T22:18Z,"@rcr29budcar 
I totally agree with you m8, Cam is a cam and DVD is a DVD and we should all rate them different. 
Some ppl are just dumb, what can you do "
