Originally developed in 2006, PhotoFucket is a client software application designed to fusker content from private PhotoBucket albums and download content from public PhotoBucket albums.


Key Features:

   ΓÇó Rip Public Albums - PhotoFucket can download all the content from a public album quickly and easily.

   ΓÇó Rip Private Albums (with password) - If you have the password to a private account, PhotoFucket can download all the content from the album just as quickly and easily as if it were a public album.

   ΓÇó Fusker Private Albums - PhotoFucket can attempt to download some of the content from a private album using a brute-force method called "fuskering," where the software tries to download content by guessing the names of files that might be in the private album.

   ΓÇó The Fusk Capacitor - Use this tool to quickly scrape the Internet in search of fusker settings that have been used in the past to fusker a PhotoBucket album.

   ΓÇó phatWares' Database - phatWares keeps an astoundingly large (and continuously growing) database of files found in private albums.

   ΓÇó List Album Tree Structure - Use this tool to get a listing of all albums, sub-albums, sub-sub-albums, etc. for a public account or a private account with password.

   ΓÇó Sub-Album Hunter - Use this tool to try to fusker sub-album names using any of three possible methods: alpha-numeric brute-force, built-in dictionary, imported dictionary/word-list.
