,bryentheartist,2012-06-11T04:27Z,fangs alot cant wait to sink my teeth into this one :)
,cmhenslin,2012-06-11T04:30Z,"Now we're talking, thanks!"
,bholmers,2012-06-11T04:33Z,What happened to the good old AVI file?  This new mp4 file everyone is uploading does not stream to the xbox or tv..  Is anyone still uploading XVID?
,cmhenslin,2012-06-11T04:36Z,Seed!
,onemangang,2012-06-11T07:08Z,"Thanks, ETTV!"
,cheecher,2012-06-11T07:13Z,@bholmers - mp4 will stream to xbox if you just change the file extension from mp4 to avi.  stupid but it works.  
,botcrawl,2012-06-11T07:28Z,This is the greatest day of my life because True Blood is back on and I'm really high eating rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.
,leetvw,2012-06-11T07:31Z,someone should open up the flood gates. Ill do the same once completed!
,bowlinwes300,2012-06-11T08:17Z,ettv.... thanks I will gladly seed for a week. I just wish it wasn't taking 4 hours so far to get to 95%. seeeeed fuckers don't just delete the torrent when it's done dammit
,deathtax,2012-06-11T08:29Z,"Great quality!

If you are using Vuze to stream, mp4 is much better than avi, and requires no conversion."
,3uv,2012-06-11T09:00Z,I don't get it.  We have to fill out a fucking survey to get the password?
,ItzClobert,2012-06-11T09:29Z,"@bholmers If you download Zune for your computer you can stream mp4 onto your Xbox. I, like you, freaked out with TV rippers switched to x264 but this saved my life."
,machspee,2012-06-11T09:55Z,"@3uv

TROLL. 

Do your spamming somewhere else. Don't you think the uploader has the skull and your comment will look stupid? I mean, what were you thinking?? Did you think "" yeeea. lemme post a stupid comment and try to confuse pirates""

Are you THAT stupid?"
,machspee,2012-06-11T10:00Z,"mp4 is the best. It works perfectly on my TV. 
 There is plenty of conversion softwares here on TPB. Just install one and quit whining about mp4. 

avi is history and mp4 is the future. "
,tobesone,2012-06-11T10:29Z,thanks always good and go the mp4
,DaoineSidhe,2012-06-11T10:36Z,is there a reason why its passworded and to try and get to the password you have to answer a survey that cant be completed? kinda sucks...
,xtheghost,2012-06-11T10:41Z,I agree with @machspee 
,mrmouth,2012-06-11T11:43Z,"How is every other mp4 that ASAP releases today PS3 friendly except for this? Do they have multiple monkeys doing the conversions? Learn to tick a box.

 And why are all of the scene group mp4 files getting larger? The whole idea of x264 was small files with great quality. Some are double the size now for no reason."
,parteeboi,2012-06-11T12:51Z,woot woot! true blood is back... i am one happy camper
,Odd_Ball,2012-06-11T15:29Z,WHAT The heck ? I cant believe Sookie kills Jessica in this one she was the best char in the show : / 
,bowlinwes300,2012-06-11T19:45Z,"@Odd_ball
Are you fucking retarded? 
do you seriously think that posting fake spoilers is cool? 
anyone that checked out the comments first of all say thanks to the uploader and second ignore TROLLS....
there is no need for a password or survey.
I've watched this episode and I give it a 11/10 just because I am obsessed with this series. I am a fangbanger and have been since season 1. and I don't care if the quality is flawed simply put I'll cry like a bitch when True Blood is over."
,kerdy2974,2012-06-11T23:59Z,awesome thanks!
,iamchrislechat,2012-06-12T00:42Z,bloody brilliant 
,botcrawl,2012-06-12T02:23Z,"@bowlinwes300
YOU = TROLL"
,cstiely,2012-06-12T04:22Z,brilliant torrent as always...cheers!
,nudge23,2012-06-12T19:46Z,is the end missing
,Odd_Ball,2012-06-13T06:27Z,@ bowlinwes No im not retarded. and no not really cool so much as funny. i like getting people like you fired up.  So thank you for doing exactly as i wanted you to do : ) ..________ Side note__ Thank you ettv for getting this for us . I enjoy the work you do . 
,firexninja,2012-06-14T20:57Z,thank you!
,canopener,2012-06-14T21:52Z,"Thanks for the up! Liking the x264 and mp4. +1.

BUT... the show is getting pretty lame. As others have noted, nobody really dies and all the primary, secondary, and tertiary characters are getting their very own and unnecessary subplots! And it's not even going to be based on it's source material - the books!

The show has JUMPED THE SHARK...."
,PookaHookah,2012-06-16T00:16Z,"I'm just curious. Sometimes with the whole HBOgo thing we get the second ep as well. For instance with Game of Thrones when the season premiered we also got the second ep very shortly after. Does anyone know how this works?

A:10 V:10 as usual with ettv."
,PrettyNInk87x,2012-06-18T06:19Z,Is anyone else going very slow?
,godess88,2012-06-25T09:30Z,thanks great audio and visual 
,RvnBlaze,2012-06-29T08:29Z,"Of course my USB to the TV doesn't support MP4 so I have to spend another 30 minutes to convert the file to AVI.  

Thanks for the upload though "
,bholmers,2012-07-04T10:44Z,"@ ItzClobert
Thank You for your advice to download Zune.  It allows me to stream mp4 files through my xbox to my tv, which is great..  I have 2 wireless TV's that still require the good old fashioned DIVX/XVID files but nonetheless I have started to download my tv shows in the mp4 format now...   "
,tunnelsunshine,2012-09-06T11:12Z,"fantastic download..great quality!! very satisfied, I've never had as great of true blood downloads as these! very happy! thanks so much! a 10 v 10!"
