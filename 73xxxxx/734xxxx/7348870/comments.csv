,jamisonman,2012-06-14T02:36Z,Audio is OUT-OF-SYNC! I see now there are RE-PACKS which confirms this bullshit copy is out-of-sync.
,jamisonman,2012-06-14T02:37Z,"But I think it's fair to get pissed when whom-ever uploads the torrent doesn't make sure the audio is in sync. I mean poor quality video is one thing, but NOBODY can put up with audio way out of sync. "
,jamisonman,2012-06-14T02:39Z,Why are there 850 seeders for this crap? I very rarely have audio problems so I know it's not me or my equipment.
,jamisonman,2012-06-14T02:42Z,"I left all these comments for this torrent even though they describe the NON-REPACK version. I had to do this because conveniently It wouldn't allow me to comment on the screwed-up torrent. It told me ""database error"""
,jamisonman,2012-06-14T02:46Z,"PLEASE stop seeding this: ""http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7345945/Continuum_S01E03_720p_HDTV_x264-2HD_[eztv]"" 
Is there anyway to get pirate bay to remove this torrent i put in quotes? I cannot believe there are 850 seeders seeding something out-of-sync, it's misleading, makes people think the torrent is fine when it's not."
