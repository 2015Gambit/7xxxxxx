,scuddlebuddy,2012-07-11T08:47Z,Great video quality but the audio seems to be a little out of sync and has volume control problems. Will be really loud at points but then really quiet at others

,arctype,2012-08-22T11:54Z,"YIFY have my babies... love ur work... u are a great encoder...
and btw the sound spikes i find are liek that in many normal blue ray movies on their own... its called climatic audio. For some reason producers think its good. "
