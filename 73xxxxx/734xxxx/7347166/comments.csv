,saadsaidi,2012-06-13T21:51Z,"@psydeep
First thank you for sharing.
Second, My **** AV detected a malware.
Therefore, I tested it on my windows 7 VM fusion on mac and the image is now infected with the above malware. 
I advise to scan your system with malware remover (fresh installation) or prove that the patch is a false positive."
