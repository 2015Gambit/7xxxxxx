Breath of Fire IV was one of the reasons I started drawing. When I heard that the art book had gone out of print, I quickly bought it from a Japanese online store. Later, when people had trouble getting the book, I scanned it and put it on a download site, which of course was deleted after a year or two.

It's been maybe 7 years, and I realized the book is selling for over 100$ because there aren't many copies left. So I'm immortalizing it here.
