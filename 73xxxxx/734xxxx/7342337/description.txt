People Don't Do Such Things

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Ruth Rendell; Full-cast dramatisation; Dramatised by Mike Walker.

It is 1979 and hapless accountant Arthur and his wife Gwen have made a new friend.

Flashy novelist Reeve is everything they're not - carefree, charismatic and seemingly irresistible. At first, his friendship seems to offer an enticing window into a world beyond their cloistered suburban existence, but it doesn't take long for the relationship to slip into rather more sinister territory.

From the moment colossal egotist Reeve arrives on the scene, it's clear that Arthur and Gwen don't stand a chance...
