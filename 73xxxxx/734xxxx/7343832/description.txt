Tech House Beats
Hy2rogen

10 chunky and funky beat-busting tech house construction kits packed with pumping grooves, nu-perc workouts, bouncy basslines, vox glitches, twisted music hooks and more.
Containing 137 24-bit Wav loops, Tech House Beats is a powerful collection of 10 track-starting folders bursting with full-fat elements that are prime for layering: re-worked and re-sequenced leads (including piano, sax, brass and more), basslines, glitched vox, plus stripped drum and percussion loops.
As always the drums are split into their constituent loops (kick, snare, clap, hats), and with as many as 6 stripped percussion loops per kit, Hy2rogen offers up more beat control than ever before.
There's also as many as 4 mixed perc loops per kit and various FX shots for seamless transitions.
All kits are offered at tech-house standard 125bpm and key-labeled, so it's simple to mix and match loops between kits to create 100s of new grooves.
