,slicknick610,2012-06-10T19:38Z,So far my local NBC affiliate is not going to show Budds Creek next week. If anyone wants to help me change their mind call 313-962-wdiv or email at wdivprogram@clickondetroit.com
,Putts255,2012-06-10T21:29Z,"Hey Slicknick.  want to send you some cash for all your work on getting these TV shows online.  I cannot watch them as I do not have NBC Sports network.  How can I get you a ""donation""?

Thanks,
Putts255"
