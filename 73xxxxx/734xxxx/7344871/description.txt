Perhaps its MorayΓÇÖs numerous tales of brushes with death on previous recordings that inspired him to use the collective noun for foxes ΓÇÿSkulkΓÇÖ as the title of his latest CD. Or maybe youΓÇÖve just seen the series ΓÇ£WhitechapelΓÇ¥ on TV? Whatever the reason, his opening choice of song ΓÇ£The CaptainΓÇÖs ApprenticeΓÇ¥ is a brooding piece of work that would settle comfortably alongside any recording by June Tabor and I certainly applaud the unsettling choice of piano chords on a stark background of saxophone used for its texture rather than as a melody. This really is an unpretentious, Gothic piece of dramatic theatre that wouldnΓÇÖt sound out of place as the soundtrack to a David Lynch or David Cronenberg movie and will doubtless send shivers down the spine of anyone who purports to have a soul. For this track alone IΓÇÖd personally give the album a ten but than that would be to dismiss this young manΓÇÖs ability to turn his hand to more or less any genre of music he cares to utilise for his excursions. He makes no bones that the ΓÇÿtraditionalΓÇÖ emphasis of his outpourings is his main preference of ingredient but in using a heady mixture of jazz, rock and classical the scatter-gun approach will hopefully expand the confines an audience made-up of primarily ΓÇÿfolkΓÇÖ music enthusiasts. This album may not be to everyoneΓÇÖs taste; perhaps a little too maudlin for most but I urge you to think again because any ΓÇÿcraftsmanΓÇÖ that can make you go straight to your computer to check out the original version of Anais MitchellΓÇÖsΓÇ£If ItΓÇÖs TrueΓÇ¥ has done his job superbly well. IΓÇÖd finally like to credit the tremendous sleeve photos of Sorrel The Fox (held with loving care by Moray) taken by the ever imaginative David Angel. If youΓÇÖre an animal lover or just love good music youΓÇÖll love this recording.
