,Exodus666,2012-08-16T13:58Z,"WTF!! What the FUCK is wrong with Comedy Central? 

They do all this, and cut away, not only both of the (only) black winners, apparently we don't care about that(I mean its not like anyone likes Donald Glover right...). Then they ALSO cut away Louie CK's two last acceptance speeches, which was the fucking REASON I downloaded this in the first place.

Great DL A/V 10/10 but FUCK Comedy Central! "
