,TheEndOf,2012-07-20T10:51Z,Does anyone have any information about this? I'd really like to upgrade. Hopefully it's better than 5.2. 
[V],bubanee,2012-07-22T09:12Z,"don't bother there's no cracked version of mixcraft, there's a lot of versions claiming.. but once you grab mixcraft6 and place a serial code.. you get 14 days (normal) and then it's trial over and stiff shit.. Unsure about this torrent here but after reading comments on others all users are complaining about the same thing... including myself because i love this program and wouldn't mind a crack.. but i'm going to bite the bullet and pay the 70 odd bucks because i couldn't be bothered fucking waiting... ;))"
