This obvious spoof on Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction features exterminators Jimmy and Julius who parody hitmen. Marsellus and coke-addict Mia are replaced by compulsive eater Mimi and husband Montello. Wannabee writer Bunny arrives with Forrest Gump-like Bumpkin. Psychos Nicky and Vallery disrupt the storylines, as do some nuns with guns.
