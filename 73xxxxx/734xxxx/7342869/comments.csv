I have about 20 more to upload including a blu-ray which I am going to start doing blu-ray rips. Until all my recent torrent are at 100%. I am also uploading to a speed of 105/20mbps next month. (October 2012) Oh and all of my newer torrent's will be ripped with DVD Decrepter and Autogk, because I reviewed some of my past torrent's and some people can seem to handle the MP4 format."
