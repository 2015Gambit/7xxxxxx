,MissAlice,2012-06-09T23:55Z,"Seems VuDu4000 is some retarded punk, with nothing to do. Just love to see that type put in war zone somewhere as cannon fodder."

,sweetchuk,2012-06-10T01:07Z,"VuDu4000 - natures cruelest mistake. Just a lump of diseased, unappreciative, unwanted smegma, no more, and probably far less.

*looks at over 200 seeders and nearly 1000 leechers* ... no-one downloading eh? Blind as well as ignorant.

footy, great job and very well done. Much appreciated effort."
,fatherded,2012-06-10T02:16Z,"cheers footy, pretty please the bbc coverage.... and vudu can go toke himself a scrote"
,griedarw,2012-06-10T13:00Z,"@VuDu4000  - You f*****g twat.  People like you are the reason abortion exists.  This is free - if you don't like then don't download it.  Prick!

@Footy - Great job....as usual."
,farhan_raja,2012-06-10T22:49Z,"Awesome upload as always. you are a life saver for so many F1 fans.
Keep it up and ignore assholes like VuDu4000

as for 'VuDu4000' I guess he is only pissed off as he found out i shagged his mom while enjoying footy's F1 upload :P"
,SerSpec-V,2012-06-11T01:30Z,Ummm when's the race (Sky) going to be posted?
