Also, according to three sources - Wikipedia, IMDB, and blu-ray.com - the official length of this movie is 110 (1 hour 50 minutes). The running time of this release is 113 (1 hour 53 minutes). I'm presuming that the extra three minutes come into play from all the skipping.

That being said, the video quality is excellent. However, the skipping does take away from the movie. It looks like the movie was just released to the masses three days ago (June 12, 2012). I am going to keep an eye out for a better version. Thank you anyway uploader."
