Concise Encyclopedia of Pragmatics (COPE) 2nd edition is an authoritative single-volume reference resource comprehensively describing the discipline of pragmatics, an important branch of natural language study which deals with the various implied meanings of a given idea imparted in speech.

As a derivative volume from Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics 2nd edition, it comprises contributions from the foremost scholars of semantics in their various specializations and draws on 20+ years of development in the parent work in a compact and affordable format. Principally intended for tertiary level inquiry and research, this will be invaluable as a reference work for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as academics inquiring into the study of meaning and meaning relations within languages. As pragmatics is a centrally important and inherently cross-cutting area within linguistics it will therefore be relevant not just for meaning specialists, but for most linguistic audiences.
