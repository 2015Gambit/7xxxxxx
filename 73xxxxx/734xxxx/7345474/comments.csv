Until then..."
,manpatio,2012-06-11T18:25Z,"Until then...

and given that you have the time, could you please re-upload the first two episodes of Hatufim which seem to suffer from some video problems (most scenes look like they are in slow motion, possibly an interlacing effect)?"
,Malveros,2012-06-12T06:25Z,Manpatio : There is no issue with the Hatufim episodes. Use a better videoplayer. All the episodes are perfect.
,manpatio,2012-06-12T08:12Z,"@Malveros: Thanks for your answer but are you sure? For once, the clicking sound is clearly audible in the start of the first episode.
But even if you take that aside, there is a clear ""interlacing effect"" happening in certain scenes starting from the first minute. For example, you can check it out at the 20 sec mark where there is an exchange of a letter. I have tried the best media players around (vlc, ffdshow codec, ffmpeg/libavc codec) in different computers and they all exhibit the same effect.

Actually, if you take a look at the filesizes you will see that all the episodes but the first two have nearly identical file sizes, plus they have different dimensions. So, I assumed that a mixup in the encoding settings must have occured and asked (nicely) whether we could have a re-encode.


Again, lots of thanks to @Snowhiter. Absolutely no intention to disrespect here."
[T],Snowhiter,2012-06-12T10:38Z,@manpatio - please use the forums. There are issues with the source material for Hatufim 1+2. I have attempted numerous times to correct the problem(s) A link will be posted within the Hatufim torrent comments when rectified. Comments here should reflect Braquo S02 E07 only. Thanx for your patience...

Sorry to take advantage of this. You were loud and clear and I am really grateful for your uploads. 
I will stick to the corresponding torrent threads here at thepiratebay (I suppose that's what you meant by forums, right?)

Again, thanks a lot."
