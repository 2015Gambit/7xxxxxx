Treat this file with caution, and use in a Virtual Machine, preferably without network access if possible. I do not have any understanding of the data within this file but may be extremely dangerous.

This is a FBI file which was compromised during the March Hackings and is presumed to be dangerous and could lead to a backdoor on your physical computer which allows the FBI access. We believe it is a exploit for Machines with NVIDIA Graphics Cards.
