,privatejoe,2012-06-14T01:03Z,"Even though I know zero Norwegian, I really enjoyed this series.  Especially liked the longer episodes and very little airport scenes. Personally I could not have competed due to the many EATING challenges.  A MacDonalds quarter pounder combo meal is about as much as I could put down.  If subs ever come out for this I will probably watch it over.

Thanks for all the Amazing Race cappers, let's hope for another Asia series."
