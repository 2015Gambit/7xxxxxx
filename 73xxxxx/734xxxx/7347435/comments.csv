,xpmule,2012-06-14T23:58Z,"ASAP should be banned from the scene

how many times do you release out of sync videos, get nuked and propered
before the scene says ok enough.. you gotta go

You'd think think people would learn from their mistakes after a few hundred times..

In case you don't know what i'm talking about this was nuked / out.of.sync
get 2HD proper (also on TPB)

Time to replace some of these scene groups i think.. get rid of ASAP and replace with AFG i think. Pretty sad when p2p groups make the scene look like retards lol"

and all AFG does is reenc. regular 720 scene releases..."
