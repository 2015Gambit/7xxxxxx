REUPLOADED AS I SET THE TORRENT UP WRONG AND IT WASNT SEEDING!!!


Guys i found the installer on a different site, :-P 

It wasnt cracked, iv just extracted the .exe to give the RAW files. 

Iv installed in FSX, (Just copy to the relevant directorys). It is flyable and some of the gauges and buttons do work. Also the Auto pilot works to. 
Iv added 3 liverys to the package as it came with none!!!

*****NOTE*****
This aircraft is not cracked, but i believe the activation lies in the qwings.dll (Located in the qualitywings folder in the fsx directory). I am working on it but its time consuming!!

Iv included the .exe if anyone wants to have a try a busting this bird!!!


F.B.I :-)
