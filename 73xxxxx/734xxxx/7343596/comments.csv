I just wanted it and searched (bombed here)

Sharing it was an afterthought.
Just wanted to save others from my headache.

I do think your ""professional rating"" is a bit harsh though.
I'd deem it better, maybe v7 a5.

Oh and forgive me but I forgot...
What was it that you've uploaded and shared lately?"
