[V],Daman4Iife,2012-06-13T06:05Z,Vampire Diaries is For Teens While True Blood is for Adults. But for me Vampire Diaries is much better since i still cant Stand the MAin Character Girl in Tru Blood and the vampires in Diaries are more badass
[T],SecTPB,2012-06-13T14:48Z,I can't stand Sookie either. I rather the story in TB revolve around Bill and Eric rather than her. Girl's so irritating I wanna kick her in the Jejunum.
,its_a_trap,2012-06-15T17:20Z,WATCH OUT! I was informed by Comcast that this torrent was copyright infringed. So this is most likely a TRAP!
