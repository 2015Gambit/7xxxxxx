720p Blu-ray quality CANNOT be the case if the file is only 800mb. Why would you even maintain the 1280x720p resolution? If you D/L 800 MB rips to watch on your phone, you don't need that resolution, and if you watch it on an Ipad, monitor or TV the quality is actually worse than a movie of the same size with a lower resolution. It's also only 2 channel audio, which really doesn't jive with Hi-Def, as most Blu-ray releases of older movies have 5.1 soundtracks, even if they are mirrored/cobbled together in some way.

So, why is this rip in Highres Movies? Just because it was ripped from blu-ray, and it may be 1280x720, making it ""Highres"" due to it's dimensions, but NOT due to its quality: not by a long shot!)

TL;DR:I feel that movies of this size should not be placed in the ""Highres"" section due solely to the source of the rip. "
[T],johnpc666,2012-06-12T20:48Z,"true. 
but a dvd is 4.3gigs and the rip is compressed to 700mb it is still placed in the dvdrip section.
therefore this is a 720p rip and is placed in the 720p section.
Its just the way of the world. :)

Thank you for your opinion, hope i helped a bit :)"
,ben7530,2012-06-13T17:28Z,"@JohnPC666 Again, thanks for all your UL work, but if the reason is, as you say ""it is due to the source of the rip: since that was blu-ray, then it does in hi-def"". ""That's just the way of the world"". 

Actually, it's not:

In the music section, do they have separate sections for vinyl rips as apart from from CDs? No. They base any differentiation on quality: they have a ""FLAC"" (read: high quality) section, and a normal section. 

In movies we have ""Movies"" for things under a DVD in size/quality, ""Movies-DVDR"", for DVD quality movies, and we SHOULD reserve ""Movies - High res"" for actual high res movies! (as defined by quality and not dimensions.)

I think this is a real problem: Anyone know how to get in touch with a mod? Can I post something on the blog somewhere, etc."
