Steps to play online:
--------------------

1. Install the game and choose the Steam version.
2. Install SmartSteam + Steam fix or GreenLuma (you can find them at the folder "#JIMBO" or you can do it from the installer), but not both of them.
3. Make sure every computer which are going to play together has the same appid number ("steam_appid.txt" at destination folder, if we are going to use GreenLuma; "SmartSteam.ini" -line "22600 = "- if we are going to use SmartSteam).
4. Start Steam with SmartSteam or GreenLuma (depending on which one you installed).
5. Start the game from "WormsReloaded.exe", NOT from Steam.
6. Create a lobby and invite your Steam friends.


It is highly recommended to use "options.cmd" to launch the game and to change the appid.
