About this game :
Take a band of gun-toting rebels -a robot, a madman, a mole and a criminal mastermind. Put them in a vividly stunning fantasy realm. Then give them an impossible mission - pulling off the biggest heist of all time in the middle of a war. All you have to do is battle your way through dastardly enemies, giant war machines and an army of psychopathic robots. But don't worry; you have plenty of ammo and absolutely no common sense. Victory is yours in 12,000 bullets or less!
 -> Fight your way through 21 action-packed missions.
-> Brandish over 17 outlandish weapons like the Cyclops Sniper Rifle, the
 Vindaloo Rocket Launcher, or the Topsy-Turvy and Sticky bomb.
-> Explore five diverse environments including icy and snowy regions, mountains with breathtaking vistas, deep and foreboding woods, and rain-spattered cliffs.
-> Take down wicked enemies like half-man, half-animal Grunts, eliminator droids, wall-smashing 
Goliaths, evil monks and wild twiglets.
-> Navigate through a richly entertaining story with two smack-talkin'
