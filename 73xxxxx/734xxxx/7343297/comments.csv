,PAWZ76,2012-06-10T20:25Z,"Thanks @Evolution.
Can you tell me what software you use to get mkv's of this size and quality? 
I want to rip and upload some myself. I also would like to keep the audio commentary track too, as I've seen other mkv torrents of similar size and quality with multiple audio tracks.
Any ideas anybody?"
