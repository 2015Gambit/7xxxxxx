Short Description

Trespassing is the second studio album by Adam Lambert, originally scheduled for U.S. release on March 20, 2012. In mid-February it was re-scheduled for
"May", to make room for new songs and collaborations.

In late March, alongside the reveal of snippets of four album tracks, Lambert announced on Twitter that the album would be released on May 15, 2012. Lambert is the
executive producer on Trespassing, as well as a principal writer.
