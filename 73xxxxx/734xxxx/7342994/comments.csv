,iBloHydro,2012-06-10T13:11Z,"Thanks for the cap bruh much appreciated, and thanks for that one seeder who decided to not run. Although its probably because he/she fell asleep. Ill take it tho and seed...."

[T],SecTPB,2012-06-10T23:52Z,Thank you. Don't usually watch Boxing. More into MMA. But I want to see the guy everyone thought that could beat that bitch Mayweather lose a fight.
,GrandMstrBud,2012-06-11T00:49Z,"Seeded 3 times now, keep it going people and seed. Everyone needs to see this screw job"
,as7d8f94s,2012-06-11T01:08Z,FIXED..... I was talking about the seed count...
,perennial,2012-06-11T03:15Z,"Small glitches in the 1st and 5th that I noticed; I stopped watching it in the 5th round after another missing section of time. Tried UMPlayer, VLC, and QuickTime and it's consistent in all three. Bummer, considering it looks great otherwise."
,perennial,2012-06-11T03:49Z,My first noticed gap is between 2:12 and 2:08 on the fight's clock in round 1. Anyone else?
,nodge27,2012-06-11T07:41Z,does this include the entrance of fighters to the ring and singing of national anthems???
,Placebo_obecalP,2012-06-11T11:56Z,Great quality but again like the Mayweather v Cotto one there's jumps in the video which loses maybe 2 minutes in total.
,Placebo_obecalP,2012-06-11T11:57Z,@nodge27 it includes boxer introductions through to post fight interviews with both boxers but no ringwalks/anthems.
,b_hawk,2012-06-11T20:57Z,"Good quality and framerate, but what's up with the random jumps and skips in the video!?"
,nodge27,2012-06-12T06:08Z,tnx @Placebo_obecalP
,NowImBig,2012-06-12T16:51Z,FUCK  Timothy Bradley
,titoto,2012-06-20T04:48Z,Thanks a lot. recommended
,NewMex52,2012-07-02T20:41Z,"Hey, don't get mad at Bradley.  Not even the referee.  Get mad at the judges who score the fight, especially the 2 motherf**kers that gave the decision for Bradley.

It's about time the sport of boxing move forward into the 21st century and use a scoreboard scoring system so everybody can see the round by round scoring for each fighter as the fight moves along.  I'm pretty sure the Pacquiao team would have reacted very strongly if they can see on the scoreboard how the judges were scoring the fight, especially for the last 4 rounds of the fight.  Had a system like this been in effect for this fight -- it would not have ended in a decision but a very definite KO or referee stops contest.  NO judges decion needed."
