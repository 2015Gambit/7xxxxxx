Almost four years have passed since his debut album 'Horizon In Your Head' hit the stores a visionary CD that is now widely considered a landmark release towards the development of the so called Nitzhogoa genre.

Now, in 2012, Agneton rises up once again to unleash his newest brainchild 'Wizards from the future'. Destroying old boundaries and reaching out for the unexplored, Agneton gathered nine musically embodied adventure tales of worlds where the sun never goes down. Intergalactic wars in distant futures and massive prehistoric creatures on the loose. These nine tracks have been craftfully designed over the course of the last three years, capturing the purest essence of Nitzhogoa 'larger than life' melodies and relentlessly pounding kicks clinged with infinite amounts of energy. Ready to breach every dancefloor and tear open your imagination. Fasten your seatbelts, soak in the music and may your summer be endless.
