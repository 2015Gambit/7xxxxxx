Sara’s fiancé is coming back soon from his study trip in Toronto. He plans to get married, but he doesn’t know that he is engaged to a heroin addict. Sara and her mother Sima decide they have to do something about the situation once and for all, but it proves to be a tough test for both of them. The mother does her maximum to save her daughter, but she faces a painful attack on her hitherto untroubled middle-class status. Desperate Sara is depressive and uncontrollable and the drug rehabilitation specialists they try to contact cannot guarantee when, or if, Sara will come through.
