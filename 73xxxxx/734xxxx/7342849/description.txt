Lusty, Texas 8 - Love Under Three Titans by Cara Covington

[Siren Ménage Everlasting: Erotic Cowboy Ménage a Quatre Romance, M/F/M/M, light spanking, HEA]

Richard, Trevor, and Kevin Benedict thought they weren’t meant for marriage until Margaret Morrison arrived in Lusty.

It doesn’t take the triplets long to understand that Maggie herself had given up on some things in life, too—like having a family of her own or a happy-ever-after. So they tease her and tempt her, promising her that since they’re all unattached adults, they can enjoy each other, and indulge in some "fun and games."

Maggie agrees to fun and games, certain once they discover she’s no good at sex they’ll leave. Instead she catches fire in their arms, and as lust turns to love she wonders if she can get the men to accept a different game plan.

And then a specter from the Benedicts’ recent past arrives on the scene. Intent on revenge, their enemy is determined to destroy whatever—or whoever—the triplets hold dear.

Can the Benedict men keep Maggie safe, or will their enemy destroy their happy-ever-after?

Note: There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings.
