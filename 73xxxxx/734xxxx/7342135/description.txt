Description
Drive, fly and operate cool machines that behave like the real thing - in Machine World! #1 App in several countries!

Machine World is a big sandbox on your iPad, 10 different machines to learn to operate and have fun with!

Current machines: Tracked Excavator, Wheeled Excavator, Dumper, Semi truck, Semi trailer, Mobile crane, Freight ship, Ferry, Rescue Helicopter, Terrain Vehicle and a Rescue Ship.

The world is fully interactive. Dig anywhere and the terrain will deform - create holes, trenches or hills. The roads are also destructible! There are also lots of details. An opening bridge with gates and signals, lots of props like cones and road blocks - and parts to build with.

The controls have two modes - one easy mode suitable for children or casual play and one realistic mode (with different control standards, SAE & ISO). 

Spoken help is always just a tap away. Easy to learn, harder to master. Loved by adults and kids everywhere!
