This what i found in the web, apparently it works because people have put their juegos.YO catch eh not yet tested since I downloaded the game eh."
,RMJ113,2012-06-10T06:09Z,"Tunngle is not needed for Smartsteam -greenluma,  you use steam servers.  tunngle is basicly just a meeting place!

 the game it self supports LAN, with lan you don,t need smart steam or green luma  Just join tunngle and host a lan gaME OR search for one !"
