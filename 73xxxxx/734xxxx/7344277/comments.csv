In VLC, the audio and subtitles will work fine, but the video is just a blank green screen (outside of the subtitles).

In Splash, it won't even play.

Any help?"
,xhizors,2012-06-15T06:22Z,"@MalignantParadigm: don't ask a bot for help.

You need 10 bit codecs, you can download  them here: http://www.cccp-project.net/

you might have to restart your computer after you install them, to get them to work though."
,xhizors,2012-06-15T06:28Z,"If you're curious which download link you need to click, it's CCCP and not Insurgent to get this to work.

God forbid the poster can help people."

,Daimoth,2012-06-28T01:21Z,Yeah that worked for me too. Shame it's named what it is and has some commie propaganda. But it works so whatever.
,Dr.Hex,2012-07-27T04:21Z,"hi, when will the second part be out ?"
,ufalum88,2012-08-01T04:22Z,"The second one, The Capture of Doldrey, has already been released in Japan."
,BlitzR,2012-09-07T16:53Z,Is this in 5.1 surround?
