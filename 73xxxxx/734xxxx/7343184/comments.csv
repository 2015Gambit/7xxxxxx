,slicknick610,2012-06-10T19:37Z,So far my local NBC affiliate is not going to show Budds Creek next week. If anyone wants to help me change their mind call 313-962-wdiv or mail at wdivprogram@clickondetroit.com
,fastestone6,2012-06-10T21:32Z,"Called and sent an email, Hope everyone will do the same.
Thanks Slick for the best race coverage of anyone ever. If you are ever in Mo. and want to go riding hit me up Have a local track and some wooded trails just a few miles from me."
,btsam,2012-06-10T22:10Z,"Thanks slicknick, sent an email.  I wonder if the major sponsors like Monster Energy know their advertising is not being broadcast by affiliates like this?  Perhaps emails to Monster, RedBull, etc. might change their mind as well?"
,btsam,2012-06-10T22:12Z,"slicknick, which affiliate is it that is not broadcasting next week?  Thanks."
,slicknick610,2012-06-11T03:35Z,"@btsam Its the NBC affiliate in Detroit WDIV. So its a pretty big market. Thanks for the suggestion. I emailed Monster, Red Bull, Lucas Oil, MX Sports and Alli sports."
,btsam,2012-06-11T09:44Z,"slicknick, did you just use a general contact email for the sponsors, or do you have emails to their advertising departments?  If you could post the email addresses, it would probably result in more people emailing them as well (like you did WDIV)."
