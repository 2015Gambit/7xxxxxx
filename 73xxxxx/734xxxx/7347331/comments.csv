When you hear about IFC’s new show ""Bunk"", it’s a little hard to imagine a comedy game show where a panel of comedians compete in inane challenges to win surreal prizes. That’s because no one has really done it before. But if you meet someone who hasn’t had pizza before, what do you tell them? It’s The Best, right? Well, we’re here to tell you that ""Bunk"" is The Best. At the live performances of the show, the audience has been rolling on the floor laughing. Pants may have been wet, no judgment, of course. So what makes this show so darn doubled-over funny? Everything. The comedian contestants are armed with nothing but their wits as they respond to images they’ve never seen before, make up songs on the spot, complete drawing and sculpture challenges and interact with modern dancers, puppies, babies, gospel singers and more, all under the watchful eye of host Kurt Braunohler. The biggest laughs get the strangest prizes, the smallest laughs get even more surreal winnings. The show is so delightfully strange and downright hilarious that we know you are going to love it.
