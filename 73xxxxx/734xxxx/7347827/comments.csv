,inf0x0,2012-06-13T01:56Z,"So no one has a proper rip of this episode, what is going on!??!"
,white-hot,2012-06-13T03:23Z,"Horrible, don't even bother."
,GWSucks,2012-06-13T03:40Z,This reminds me of recording TV over an antenna with a VCR back in the 80s.
,Zetsubou69,2012-06-13T14:20Z,This is shit!
,_Cthulhu_,2012-06-13T19:40Z,Considering the reception we had on the TV when it was airing. A big thank you to you.  It is watchable.   :)
,Y2k0000,2012-06-20T12:05Z,"Honestly, those idiots saying that this torrent is unwatchable should get their eyes checked. The quality might not be HD, but it is definitely watchable and decent. Learn to appreciate the upload instead of complaining like pussies."
,sputnikwood,2012-06-21T06:05Z,"Didn't dl so do not know how bad the quality is.

Head over to hulu, they have this episode if you don't mind ads."
