[T],Tyr3ll,2012-06-11T17:27Z,"Well for now 
We are proud and pleased to present you our new unrated light remastered edition of the International Theatrical Final version of this movie as exclusive BrDrip as first part of our new project concerning this specific movie.
The version you will get now is not yet the Final version of our first project
about.
We are already working hard on a second project for our Final Theatrical version that will be in DTS-HD MA for 4-5 spoken languages if possible.
Stay tune so...
(I) in the title of this file means : International Theatrical version for a total of 1h57'31"" playback lenght
Movie end here in Theatrical version is a little bit different and longer than Final cut edition.
__________________________

Original Video codec :
VC1/1080p

Original Audio spoken language :
US to Dolby Digital AC-3 5.1/6-ch/3F2R:LFE/48 Khz/16 bits/640 kbps
FR to Dolby Digital AC-3 2.0/2-ch/Stereo/48 Khz/16 bits/192 kbps
....

_________________________

This is our first light remastered version like this :
First step : Reencoding/Decoding to Mkv H.264_720p
Second step : reconverting French sound track to AC-3 2.0 Stereo @ 640 kbps
instead of the original crappy 192 kbps speed only. 
Third step : reconverting to m2ts file @ 1288 x 566 new screen resolution.
mkv h.264 @ avc1 codec is still present anyway.
25/50 fps playback
4:2:0 YUV
No Sub guys,sorry again.
_________________________

We decided to use this medium screen resolution to avoid to give you a too large size of this first new unrated light remastered version that gets 11,8 Go size already about...and without Sub as well.
About IQ and VQ:
both are quite fine but not perfect anyway.Some bit noise/grain still and few little pixelation may appear in certain scenes also.
Tha's why i said to you that is not our first Final remastered version.
Nothing is yet finalzed so.
Btw,Theatrical version on BD gets less good quality than last new Final Cut version that has been largely remastered for sure anyway.
Anyway,this version is very acceptable as well as very watchable,you can trust me !
So we propose...then you decide.

__________________________

We would like to get your true feedback about this new EXPERIMENTAL one,please.
Don't fear to do it as anyway you won't hell die for...huh ?
Give a simple thx as well...
This way,we really hope you will like and enjoy it.
Have a good film and please,seed as long as you can so.
Ty for your understanding 

__________________________

Important note :
This version is formaly forbidden and disallowed for sale,resale,rental use as well as for any online video streaming use by any money profit !!!
Please,respect this !
No bullshits as well,so.
Just for your eyes only,no more so.

Ty again

[T],Tyr3ll,2012-06-11T18:08Z,"Second seed in on the way...
our second server is under maintenance : 
Raid crash... :s damnit (lol)
whatever it is don't worry we will be back soon now... 
cheers ;)"
,txen,2012-06-13T00:07Z,"Thanks, but how about making a remastered 1080p BRRip of the european theatrical version that fits DVD5 (4.7GB)?"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-06-13T21:02Z,"We have it already,bro !
you must convert this one to VOB,but i don't recommend it because video quality is not very good for this seed,k?
I will seed soon now the VOB version that will fit with a 4,5 GBand 8,5 GB DVD reconverted from a new version BDrip in DTS 5.1-Hybrid@1411 kbps :)
Question is :
Would you like Multilangual version or US or FR
version only.Including Sub or not ?
So let me know bud.
waiting for reply...
cheers ;)"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-06-13T21:14Z,"We do not recommend you to burn this version as video is not good enough for.Just our thoughts
anyway...Medium quality,no more !
It is just delivered ""as is"" for share with you our project on this movie.All especialy for French language that has been reconverted for this new one.
Our first test about...
as ""Simple ebauche,quoi...""
But you can really expect and hope other new different and better versions than this one for sure soon now.
Our job is already finished and ready so.
We are already working on other new different movies now...
regards"
,txen,2012-06-14T02:52Z,"It would be awesome to have a very high quality small sized (~4.5GB) International Theatrical version, multiple pass encoded with x264 in 1920x800 mkv/mp4 format with English AC-3 5.1 :-) Keep up the good work!"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-06-14T11:30Z,"In fact :
We have two choices... 
to VOB for dvd means :
or 25/50 fps@6000 Birate rate as DVD Pal for original screen resolution like this : 720 x576

or 

720 x 480 for 29,97 fps_DVD NTSC
at 6000 Bitrate

So let me know if you wanna get DVD NTSC or PAL,first.I will try to even build a Special DVD based on DTS- 5.1-Hybrid,average/medium Bitrate.
However it will only fit to a 8,5 Gb DVD size.
720 or 1080p is not possible on 4,5 Gb cause size due to this specific screen resolution cannot fit for
a 4,5 GB size. 
If you are ok,we or i can able to do it for a DVD 8,5 GB size on a Hybrid DVD VOB with more than 6000 Bitrates so with an approximative 720p screen resolution.
Hopefully anyway...
cheers ;)"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-06-14T11:37Z,"Ahhh,you mean wanna get direct 4,5 GB DVD size
on mkv h.264 1080p on AC-3 5.1 ???
impossible bro,sorry.
May be on a DVD 8,5 GB size and probably for less than a 720p resolution.
BTW : VOB=MPEG-2 or MPGV

K,i will make few different short sample to show you as exemple,right ?"
,txen,2012-06-14T13:38Z,"Hi again, I was hoping for FullHD rip from the Blu-ray to mkv/mp4, not VOB in low resolution.
Similar to this one: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6661800
But in higher quality/resolution and ~4.5GB ;-)"
[T],Tyr3ll,2012-06-14T19:13Z,"our VOB versions run very well bud,but i can understand what do you want to get,sure so.
Anyway as we are currently remastering several other movies,we will try to do it for you and other ppls,k.
Let me time enough bud,and once i will get some time for a suffisant brake,i will learn this posibility.
Anyway,be patient,we should release it asap
kind regards"

However with these settings our Quad core runs at
100% load and may get probably overheat protection at 15% of the conversion.
Our GPU runs and load at 45-50% permanent.
So we think that a Bitrate of 3000 WOULD BE LARGELY SUFFISANT for sure to get a very good  Final result.
Anyway,would you like to get our first sample so ?

I've seen the 1920x1080 sample. Details look great and bitrate seems sufficient. Looking forward to seeing the final result ;-) Cheers, txen"

ty for your positive feedback bud ;)
We are currently working on the best quality release which will be released asap now.
Btw,we have another sample for you if you are
still interested based on the same settings like the first sample but with more and better optimizations as well.
13 % now :)
