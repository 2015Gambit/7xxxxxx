Upon request, I bring here AES 2.3a with serials to use.



The AES Base Pack is totally free of charge and includes numerous credit free airports (see link below). Please note that AES requires 3rd party airports to be installed previously, these are available as separate purchases, with the exception of the default Nuremberg airport. 

Airports supported at 2.3: http://www.aerosoft.com/shop-re/links/aesairports.html
