,airbusflyer,2012-06-17T18:57Z,"Does someone know how to install AES when allready AES 2.21 installed (with not legal serials)? I always get an error and it say I have to contact Aerosoft, which is of course a trick to find pirates.
Someone has a idea?
Or someone know how to get the new airports in version 2.21 working so we don't need to install a new version?"
