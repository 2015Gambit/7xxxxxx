,JBKAL007,2012-06-13T16:03Z,"I finished downloading the movie not too long ago (after waiting all day, ever since the torrent got first uploaded) and got to watch it! Indie Game: The Movie was nostalgic and absolutely breathtaking! I was very impressed with how well of a job they did with the film and I'm definitely going to be buying the blu-ray edition of it to show to my friends!

I've been seeding the torrent all day and will continue to do so until my ratio hits 10:1 (it is currently 5:1).

If you like Indie Game: The Movie enough, be sure to buy it too! It's pretty damn cheap! Also, special thanks to No301 for this amazing torrent!! 10/10"
,JBKAL007,2012-06-13T16:12Z,"Quality:
Video - 10/10
Audio - 10/10

The video would be a lot better in 1080p, but regardless of the fact, it still looks great in 720p! This is still a perfect video format (and filesize, in comparison to the other 1080p [3.12 GB] torrent currently out) for those that want to download the movie faster and also watch it on the go with their mobile handheld device / portable video player. Enjoy the film!"
,wesleiwpa,2012-06-13T17:03Z,Where's subtitles??Can you up??Thank you.. excellent torrent.. 
,skareo,2012-06-13T20:01Z,"Thank you very much for sharing this everyone. I think this is one of the most important movies of our time. It's important to see what goes into making games from their very roots, not just the bad fruits that corporations attempt to peddle us. Indie games stay true to game design and I support them for that reason alone. Whether or not you like the games made by an indie studio, I think it's worth considering their work and paying the small fee to keep innovation and creativity alive in this world."

,anonyboy,2012-06-20T07:18Z,After watching this I have only really learned 1 thing: Indie developers are very depressed frustrated neurotic obsessive compulsive people that derive joy only from 100% praise and take every bug and flaw in their work as a deep personal failure that may or may not be worth killing themselves over. 
,crash87,2012-06-28T16:51Z,Anyone can upload spanish subs plz? 
,rusty-koathanger,2012-07-02T06:51Z,@anonyboy: but you're ok.....right?
