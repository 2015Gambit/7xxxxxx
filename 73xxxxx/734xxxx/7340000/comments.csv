,Dimseit,2012-06-09T09:36Z,"I used this fix, but there are still some problems with signaling."
,benaja84,2012-06-09T15:20Z,"idem.
 Don't work.

 It don't fix the problem of the signals brrr..."
,dmac6419,2012-06-09T15:28Z,"dude you need to check your torrents and files before you upload them,"
,redcard616,2012-06-09T16:29Z,Thanks very much for this and all the other additions you have kindly upladed onto TPB. It certainly makes Railworks much more enjoyble with your support. Have run a number of scenarios (not all) with this update for the London to Brighton Line and can confirm this has resolved the issue about missing signals for me.
,addy700,2012-06-09T16:39Z,"Yeah, still no signals on gantries or at the end of stations, does it use UK LED signals?

If it does then it's odd that it doesn't work, I do own them."
,mr_ahmad,2012-06-09T16:41Z,@everyone: You will have to clear the cache after installing the signal fix.. It is working for most of the people and files have been duly checked.
,dmac6419,2012-06-09T23:46Z,mr ahmad how can it be fixed with the file has errors on 7zip
,tpb_4_ever,2012-06-10T10:52Z,"@dmac6419, You must be doing something wrong as other people have got it to work fine. You need to extract the files to your desktop, enter the password when prompt, then copy and paste the files to your Railworks directory, overwrite any files if asked, then launch railworks, navigate to the tools and docs tab and click clear cache. If done correctly this will fix the missing signals.
If you can't extract the files for some reason, re-install 7zip or try Winrar"

,tpb_4_ever,2012-06-21T13:14Z,"Service pack 1 will not be uploaded because it doesn't really do anything except give you slightly improved sky and light effects, and increase lag."
