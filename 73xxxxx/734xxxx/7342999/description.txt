Stargate Universe was an incredible series that suffered an early demise courtesy of the Reality-Trash-SyFy channel. I tried to make the highest quality content for a series that deserved so much more. I hope some of you out this will enjoy adding this to your collection. Please help seed this series. Currently have around 5 megabit upload and will seed for quite a while. Also posting on other sites to help spread the love.
