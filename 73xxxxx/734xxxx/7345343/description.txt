It's time to get fucking epic as Dawnchaser (with a colorful cast of vocalists, collaorators, and the Spirit of Adventure) brings you a massive album to propel you into your next adventure.

Soaring uplifting trance, rocking hard trance, funky breaks, and chilled out ambient music is the name of the game, and Dawnchaser delivers like a man being chased by a bear. Are you ready for the journey?
