A fascinating exploration of how mathematics affects our daily lives in sociological, economic, and historical perspectives.

Mathematics is at the root of modern civilization, from measuring temperature on a frigid day to driving a car to using a digital camera; enthusiasts might say applied mathematics rules the world. The Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Society presents some 490 articles showing the math behind our daily lives, explaining to students how and why math works, and allowing readers to better understand how disciplines such as algebra, geometry, calculus, and others affect what we do every day.
