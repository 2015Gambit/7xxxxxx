,Bookeek,2012-06-12T17:03Z,"TxJag, good to hear from you!

I've been in Europe - spain and italy.  The week before I left I was unable to post anything I just got time-out errors.

Post the Holt books. I want the missing one.

BTW i read and love lackberg.

,TxJag,2012-06-12T19:52Z,"Bookeek: I uploaded all of Anne Holt. Everything is up to date, just wish I had the rest of the Hanne Wilhelmsen books. Those UK publishers need to get cracking!

The Final Judgement is called What Never Happened in the US. Vik and Stubo are complete (I had the other 3 of that one already.) 1222 is Full Retail as well, I gave in and bought that one as well. Just look up Anne Holt and you'll find it."
