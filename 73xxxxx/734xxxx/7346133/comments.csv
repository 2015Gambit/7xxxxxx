Seven noble families fight for control of the mythical land of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell, leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond.

"
[T],bzingaz,2012-06-11T15:41Z,There was some problem during uploading..that's why details are in comment..enjoy..
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-11T18:47Z,"YOu are my new favourite uploader!!! Just found you a moment ago. Your uploads look awesome. I have had a quick look. I know they will be awesome as you get from BoB, who is the best ripper for size vs quality imo. Agree or diagree? Scorp for movies. Agree or disagree? Please point me to someone else if you think otherwise. 

Anyway time for your VIP Green Skull.

How do we recommend you to the mods?"
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-11T20:11Z,"Ok, all your whole season uploads are pretty recent, maybe just the pink skull for now is deserved. Keep on uploading those BoB quality complete seasons and you should become a VIP in no time."
,bktheman,2012-06-12T01:24Z,^ as long as u help him out by seeding :P
,bktheman,2012-06-12T01:36Z,"@bringaz
umm.... Question: do u happen to have ""Fringe season 4"" small rips stored up in your harddrive sir?

only if it's ""YES""
can u please do share :)
well i started downloading the show..
thanks for ADreaNaL & twentyforty... 
each season was under 3GB or around 4GB
but.. the smallest i found for 4th season is 7GB ... so ya 350mb avis....
i wouldnt mind that size if it wasnt for me 60kbps connection
so pls... reply... on the above...
and yah.. it's no problem if u dont have that on your hard disk...
no need to redownload and share
u have done too much for us already ;)
have a good day mate"
,kcg420,2012-06-12T09:43Z,MKV container is garbage
,bktheman,2012-06-12T10:03Z,^ yah right:P
[T],bzingaz,2012-06-12T14:14Z,"@Dyna-C4-mite

in tv shows i thing bob was best..but it seems he is gone now..there are another like ,tinymkv epicmoviezand i think tvteam does 480p tv shows too..
now about movies nobody is best..the person is best till when he/she is uploading..i think yify is best uploader right now under 720,1080p and 3d category movies..but he started from 480p and thats what made him famous awesome quality movies in 300-400 mbs..but he has stopped doing 480p..which i think he should not have..again in 480p category movies there are many uploaders like CharmeLeon Silver RG is a very good one..
and last thing about green skull..whenever they think anybody deserves it they automatically promotes them.."
,Dyna-C4-mite,2012-06-12T19:34Z,"Yeah BoB went away for a while, but he came back, havent checked in a while, he may have stopped again.

I agree about Yify. If you ever want to download quality, go to Yify. Although I am not a big movie downloader. Like my series more, get movies from friends. 

@bcg420 You keep downloading your avi's or your favoured format, for people who have limited bandwidth mkv container offers great quality vs size. Although it is difficult/impossible to stream and play on older dvd players. 
There are many great uploads of Game of Thrones for you to choose from, why click on this 2gb torrent for the entire season, you must have known it was not avi as it is 2 small. 

Thanks again Bzingaz"
,soletar,2012-06-13T04:27Z,"Dear bzingaz,

Thanks for your sacrifice and generosity to everyone here... i just discovered you and i am frankly amazed by the 70MB episodes you are uploading... please i have noticed you specialise in series... please upload Crime Scene investigation -CSI season 10 and 11...in your magical small format (i have very bad bandwidth) Thank you,please reply.... "
,soletar,2012-06-13T04:37Z,"And bzingaz..... thanks for the info on 480p top uploaders. i was initially a fan of MrKickass, when he stopped uploading, i discovered YIFY. i was so amazed then with the quality of his 300-500MB rips. Started following him, unfortunately as you rightly said,he has changed. I have been begging him to revert to no avail...any other top 480p uploader you recommend who uploads topshelf quality? i have very low bandwidth,thats why i ask. Thanks"

[T],MelloYello,2012-07-29T20:03Z,"@monokosas- Use ConvertXtoDVD.  Best program out for burning files to dvd. Just drag and drop your mkv files.
