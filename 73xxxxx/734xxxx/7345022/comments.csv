,ouroborous,2012-06-11T15:20Z,"This show is serious new world order propaganda in my opinion... the good brainless hot bitch defends the corporate owned fascist government and the bad violent terrorists come from 2077 to 2012, and yadda yadda yadda futuristic technoloy, fights, a genius geek hacker guy who's got dexter's laboratory in his attic and has negative views toward resistance or civil disobedience... fuck it just see for yourselves, canada is getting fucked nowadays.."
,Shiva45,2012-06-11T15:56Z,"That's right ouroborous, which side are the good guys"
,Fayo,2012-06-11T22:47Z,Well atm I'm watching with hope that she will eventually learn the mistake of her ways but we'll see
,icaromh,2012-06-12T04:56Z,thanks a lot

not a propaganda at all - from episode one it is clear that the plot will take quite a different turn. 

excellent show for now btw and i guess it wont get ruined soon, at least the first season will be cool."
,Erkle64,2012-06-12T11:19Z,"I think you might've missed the point ouroborous, I might be wrong though, the logical character development path for her is slowly realising that she is on the wrong side."
,ouroborous,2012-06-12T12:22Z,"great.. just like in real life, I can only hope that people will stop being stupid.. it would be nice though, except I think if it happens, it's going to take some time, she seems stubborn, and where would the plot go on then? they join forces with occupy wall street or whatever, coming from the future, with the knowledge of how things went bad, it wouldn't be that hard... hell I don't even understand wtf these guys are doing to prevent that, they seem to care about going back... we'll see, in any case I'll keep seeing this one, it would be much more epic if they'd smack all those heartless canadian cops"
,ArchAngelMikel,2012-06-13T03:50Z,"ouroborous; you call people stupid when it is clear that the protagonist will have shift in her perception at some point soon. It is stupid not to realize this. Meaning you are stupid. The ""problem with people"" is their inability to recognize their own ignorance, and to judge others from it, ignorantly. (what you have done) You need some courage before you (people) can stop being the problem."
,ArchAngelMikel,2012-06-13T03:53Z,"as for the quality of this show. The reason the protag' will soon have an awakening is because the good guy can't also be the bad guy, in current pop myth. Also why it is so obvious. This show is poorly written, mostly poorly acted...and some what entertaining. "
,jside86,2012-06-13T05:00Z,"ouroborous, Canada is getting fucked all the time
nothing new here...

And thanks this show rocks!!!

Have you all realized that in 2077 they talk about the Vancouvert district not Vancouver Canada so maybe we are part of the same country now"
,ouroborous,2012-06-13T13:24Z,"@ ArchAngelMikel

mmm, why so serious? I never called anyone stupid.. yes, it's a fucking character, which I find stupid, like I find some people in real life stupid, and hope they'd change, but you say ""it is clear that the protagonist will have shift in her perception at some point soon"", and I just disagree that ""It is stupid not to realize this. Meaning you are stupid."" I still have the right to share my doubts as that turning point in the series has not YET happened so you can't call people ignorant if you don't know more about the freaking future of the screenplay unless you're a goddamned writter of it. So quit our butthurt nonsense."

,Polymathj,2012-06-16T06:27Z,"I'm digging it.  They mention actual technology and even reference the Tor network.  Pretty cool so far.  

Being a small business owner and not a fan of the rich-people-haters, I can see how this is a little far fetched with the sociopolitical tension but I'm wanting more!

Not a perfect formula but:
Money=skill+intelligence+drive.

You don't have to be cut-throat to pay your bills."
,Srsbznz,2012-06-19T02:00Z,"Audio seems to be out of sync, didn't start to notice until around the 4min mark. Seems to be a lot less noticeable with media player classic for some reason."
,YardBoy,2012-06-21T15:13Z,"A9/V9, +1 for being a contributor,  Re-seeded 2.33X.  Thanks to eztv."
,cvolcano,2012-06-26T02:46Z,Am I the only one rooting big time for the bad guys in this thing? The good guys seem really misguided.
