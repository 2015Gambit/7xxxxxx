Let me make it understood, I am in no way, supportive of the Muslim Violent Jihad. I feel it is unacceptable.

The reason why I am releasing this document is because of it's censorship throughout the Western Hemisphere. It is constantly being blocked, and I am a supporter of Pirate Politics and Net Neutrality, and although I do not support the Jihad, I feel that any document, whether I support it or not, should be available to the public.

I don't care how you use it, it's the same as the Anarchist Cookbook. Read it for laughs :)
