,zakimar,2012-06-13T08:12Z,"""Jihad"" is a reaction to Us and Israeli aggression. People shouldn't react to violence, murder, occupation by the Americans and jews with more violence.

The most effective ""jihad"" is to BOYCOTT the USA and Israel into complete bankruptcy, so they can no longer afford their aggression and wars of occupation.

BOYCOTT Israel & USA"
