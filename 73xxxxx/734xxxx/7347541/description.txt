 So Billy Ray Cyrus is back with new material, a new look, and and all-new, matured sound. While Shot Full of Love is not exactly comeback material, it does put Billy's music in a new light. While his songwriting is essentially the same as always, his voice has a new sound to it. Gruff but refreshingly smooth, Billy coasts through the tracks on this album with beautiful heartfelt emotion. Just read the liner notes, and you will feel what Billy feels, and realize his inspiration. Unfortunately, Shot Full of Love runs through almost exactly like Cover to Cover, the reason it lost a star. Though the songs feel mostly like BRC in his "Storm in the Heartland" days, you do get an updated feel in songs like "Give My Heart to You" and "Busy Man," the two big hits on this album. Although a shades-of-Setzer swinger ("Rock This Planet") and a  could-be-Bon Jovi rocker ("Shot Full of Love") are found among the tracks possibly  throwing off listeners used to BRC's country-rock style, he generally keeps it as  real as he ever has. A success, but for his real comeback and a truly updated sound,  check out Southern Rain.
