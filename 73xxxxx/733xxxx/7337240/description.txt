This is the complete set of lessons from the language learning podcast JapanesePod101, as of May 2012.

I registered for a 1-month (turned 2-month) premium subscription to have access to the full materials, and used an array of tools and scripts to download and process the 2500+ files (MP3s and accompanying PDFs).

The amount of cleanup I had to perform was insane. There was everything from inconsistent filenames, wrong filenames in some cases, breaks in the numbering, incorrect MP3 tags, etc. The full details are on the README, if you're feeling brave.

When my subscription ended, there were still four ongoing seasons, and only 11 of the 25 lessons on each had been released. This means the corresponding folders will be incomplete (they're marked as such).

Everything is organized in a nice and clean folder structure so you can download only the lessons for your level, if you want, instead of a huge (12GB) archive.

So, that's it! I hope you all enjoy. And don't forget to seed ;)

ps - If you want to collaborate on the cleanup effort, I still would like to finish listing the titles and dates for all lessons. You can help by editing the spreadsheet at:
