,remoray,2012-06-12T00:26Z,This is awesome... thank you very much!
,brazcafe2,2012-07-03T19:36Z,"Wow, sounds insane! I am interested though on the all those scripts and stuff. Guess such things could be used on other sites too , would come handy on similar subscription model. Do you think the way you worked would work on other sites, language and video tutorials? Cheers!! "
,bla_diddy,2012-07-06T03:15Z,More seeds would be nice!
,waldyrious,2012-07-11T12:08Z,"@brazcafe2 I used the FlashGot and the iMacros Firefox extensions for downloading (I tried curl in the command line but the session variables were messing it up and I didn't feel like digging to find out how to workaround that), the Puddletag MP3 tag editor for fixing the tags, several Linux command line tools (mostly ""rename"") to fix the filenames, and perhaps a few others I might not remember. And of course, a text editor to keep note of everything and not get lost in the confusion! As you can imagine, it was all very customized and done on-the-fly, so I am afraid I don't have a script or set of scripts that can be easily exported to be used on other sites.

However, there is this guy who uploaded another snapshot of JapanesePod101 a while ago (I can't link it here, it seems, but search for ""japanesepod101 rutracker""), and he seems to have actually written some Java classes to perform the cleanup. I contacted him and will look at how we can cooperate to join our efforts and perhaps offer the community an even more comprehensive release, with tools/scripts and all! Stay tuned :)"

,babak160,2012-08-12T22:56Z,"Japanesepod101 is really a outstanding resource for Japanese. learning Japanese does not need a teacher (As I did learn it without one) and Japanesepod101 was a big step forward for me in learning Japanese.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  "
