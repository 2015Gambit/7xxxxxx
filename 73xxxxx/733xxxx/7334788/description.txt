SIM CITY 3000 

This is the full game enjoy :)

SimCity 3000 has many options to scale performance for low end systems 
and to take full advantage of higher end systems.

The game runs best with full graphics hardware acceleration.  Open 
Settings, Control Panel, System. This brings up the System Properties 
window.  Click on the Performance tab at the far right. This brings up 
the Advanced Graphics Settings. Full should be used.  

On lower end systems the game will default to 640x480 screen resolution,
traffic visible only in the closest 2 zoom levels, and sims visible only in 
the closest zoom level. Ways to further optimize performance are:  turn off some 
or all animations, select smaller city sizes, and run with the simulation at 
lower speeds. Music and sound also tax the system.
