,judascain,2012-06-09T22:49Z,just 'cause it says x264 it aint Hi'res' so why do they insist on posting this shit in this section??
,Sourside,2012-06-10T03:07Z,"Terrible quality, no where near 720p.

Audio goes out of sync in parts. 

Definitely not recommended  "
,nemo_vatc,2012-06-10T13:58Z,"Oh, thank Sourside!"
,Scyrthis,2012-06-11T10:12Z,"It may be 720p by pizel resolution, but not ever close enough in the quality, which nowadays cam only is a disgrace of good movies and are the optimal solution for the most desperate man."
,iSimorgh,2012-06-11T16:16Z,"Must say, this movie is the worst quality ever.
It's shot with a camera, isn't it?

TS 720p = Total Sh*tty"

,CraftyW,2012-07-01T21:31Z,"judascain, x264 is the encoder, not the quality, 720p is the quality, apparently "
,ScrewFearMe,2012-07-02T20:40Z,"this isnt even 720p.
1280x568 is far from 720p just so you guys know..."
,damnannoyed,2012-07-07T05:49Z,"@screwfearme Some of you are so quick to jump the gun without really having an idea what you are talking about.. let me explain

1. Its a Cam job. 
2. Its a HD Cam job 
(originally recorded@1280x720p)
3. Video Stream was converted using the x264 encoder & muxed into a .mkv container
4. During conversion/encoding, it was cropped to remove potential unwanted artifacts (peoples heads; cinema surroundings; recorded on a slope etc)
5. Out of sync audio can be somewhat common with PIRATE CAMS. If you don't like, DON'T WHINGE, ABUSE THE UPLOADER or essentially DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!... maybe you can find a better torrent; do a better job with your camera or wait till it's avail on DVD/Bluray???

The torrent is FREE as opposed to paying $$$ to see in the cinema at its best."
