Rewiev: "Here is a new band called Twin City with their release of their mixtape NTKY. No idea what it stands for but what I do know is that their must is good. One of their best songs is ΓÇ£Just For TonightΓÇ¥ which has a pop feel to hit with a dope beat and Mike Garmany, the lead vocalist kills it. I downloaded the whole mixtape immediately and so should you. Sounds a lot like Logic if he rapped a little slower or also a lot like the artist PropanLv who I post a lot of. Kind of a creepy cover" http://www.pumpthebeat.com
