GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series race #5 - Belle Isle Detroit - 2-June-2012

This is the 5th race of the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, held at Belle Isle Park
in Detroit Michigan. Part of the Chevrolet Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix, the
CHEVROLET GRAND-AM DETROIT 200 race is a 2 hour timed event run over a 2.1 mile
street course of 14 turns. The course has been described as "...very bumpy and
tight, and a lot of fun to drive."

This download is a .ISO file intended to be written directly to a blank 4.4GB DVD.
Then you can play it on your living room Blu-Ray console connected to your big screen
HDTV. You can also play it on your computer DVD drive with appropriate software. The
video is encoded in a hybrid format called BD5 that is compatible with all Blu-Ray
console players but not likely any DVD consoles.

If you wish to play the download on your computer you can use a virtual DVD emulator
utility, like the free DAEMONTools Lite, to "mount" the .ISO file as a temporary
DVD drive. Then you can play the video directly using any Blu-Ray compatible media
player. I often use CyberLink PowerDVD to watch, and I have also used others such
as the freely available DAPlayer. If you have the correct AVCHD CODECs installed
then even Windows Media Player can be used.
