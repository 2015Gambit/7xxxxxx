The album 'Sounds of Cosmic Lifeforms' is the latest Goa Trance album made by SynSUN a project originating in the Ukraine.

Like the albums 'Zelur Project' and 'Full Power of Goa' this release is about melodic and powerful Goatrance, danceable music that never looses the original Goa vibe and feeling.
