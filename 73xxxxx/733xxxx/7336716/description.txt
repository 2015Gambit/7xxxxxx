Yet another version of Kind Of Blue? Yes and no. This one is the latest japanese remaster (2006) in sparkling high resolution. Extracted to PCM 24 bit / 88 Khz resolution from an SACD ISO ripped with a PS3.

This is the consensus best digital version ever! Check the forums (stevehoffman.tv, etc). No digital version tops this one.
