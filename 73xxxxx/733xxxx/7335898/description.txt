....Thanks :P
          AUDIO: ADTRG ...Thanks :P


Notes -
Source is very nice other than a scrolling, pulsing flicker which i reduced as much 

as possible without 
losing video quality.. then it was onto the slight RGB adjustment, brightness and 

contrast then sharpened..
then was onto syncing up ADTRG's very nice LiNE to our encode... had to make a few 

cuts due to them
not removing dupe frames..... will do until R5 or better comes along...... enjoy  :P

Enjoy!!
