  This marked the first outing for Bogart's own Production Company 
  Santana and features a powerful performance from rising young star Derek. 
  Attorney Andrew Morton (Bogart) is persuaded to represent underprivileged 
  teen Nick Romano (Derek) who's up on a murder charge. Set within the 
  confines of the courtroom director Ray breaks out to location by the use 
  of flashbacks telling the story of Romano's no-hope upbringing. 
  The excitement and tension is built up nicely, remains crisp and sharp 
  throughout.

  previously appeared as Sam in Casablanca (1942).
