When i got all the series worked with the last file that will not have too much size , in fact it will be the shortest series game , a magnific interface will be available for all the games series then more game files from the Resident Evil GLOBE collection you have , more games will work on the buttons on the interface , for example you have 3 games downloaded and ready to go , you move them to the interface folder and that games will be available by a single click on the interface that will have available all the series available by a single click ... simply fantastic ...

Happy gaming to all of you ."
,georgegalily,2012-06-05T16:17Z,"Hi Globe, You are fantastic I didn't finish downloading your games yet and here U R posting A new one.
A  1Milion THAAAAAAAAAAANX to U"
[V],globeplus,2012-06-05T17:53Z,"To geprgegally : it will be all the Resident Evil series worked carefully and uploaded one by one and this one it is simply another great resident evil game and once more was created a launcher with the 2 game personages with any of the discs starting immediatly in fullscreen and each disc with an appropriate created executable , it is beeing great researching and working this files one by one always trying to find the best way to present each file analising all the available possibilitys , i am dreaming with the interface if you permit the expression because with the quality of this work it will be fantastic watch all the Resident Evil series available at the same place with a single click and with the games having really the best files possible to get in size and presentation , making files can be an art if we give our best shot to get the best work possible ... we (fans of the series) and you can include me too just have to keep going file after file until we get our dream of having all the series with a fantastic interface to use any of the already available games easily and with the really best possible files then it is just to wait for the Resident Evil 6 and pray to be possible once more a great work and join 1 more great Resident Evil game to the interface of the all series ... see you and get your games of course ... happy games to you .

,hell911,2012-06-06T03:32Z,"yes GLOBE, negative voters are just haters or just competitors, dont worry about them..

if u get 1 negative vote, 10 positive votes will come.

GO GLOBE!! BRING SOME MORE HEAVY RIPPED GAMES!!"
[V],globeplus,2012-06-06T10:00Z,"To hell911 ; it is really nothing ripped on this files , they are just appropriated compressed , like i said on the description : i didn´t touched a thing , just leave them well compressed with worked executables that executes the games with a compreensive and logic commandline , this is really the correct work for a file like this ."
,Joe3lcrack,2012-07-11T06:09Z,Hey Globe nice work man i can launch the game and everything. I just have one problem idk how to change the keys. im using a ps1 controller
,Joe3lcrack,2012-07-19T06:20Z,Hey nvm I found out how to change the keys. But I have another problem... At random whether i open a door or it cuts to a movie scene the game freezes. ALWAYS. The longest i lasted in the game was probably 10 min thin it will freeze. I don't know why any advice is appreciated GLOBE thanks.
