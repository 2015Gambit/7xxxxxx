,wiseguy7,2012-06-08T03:43Z,"Don't torrent this. Seriously, just go and buy the bundle, it's cheap and it's for a good cause. The uploader is a fucking jackass. "
,OmniNegro,2012-06-08T07:00Z,"Seems pretty lame. But who the fuck are any of you to judge? Go buy it yourself. Some may wonder if they already have the games, and the videos do not always make it clear if you do.

Besides, it is not $1. It is currently $8.11 to get everything. Some would say that is a total rip-off and they pay a few dollars and download the rest.

To be clear, if you pay less that the average price of $8.11 you do not get Braid, Super Meat Boy, Bastion, or Lone Survivor."
,Sayko222,2012-06-08T10:50Z,I rather download it from here ... I like free games XD .
,Mandabar,2012-07-05T06:30Z,"Well there's one reason to have a torrent like this.

For those people who weren't able to buy the HB in time, Or just plain didn't know about it.

For God sakes, Using this site you could go search and download all of these individually anyways via search, This just makes it ""easier"""
