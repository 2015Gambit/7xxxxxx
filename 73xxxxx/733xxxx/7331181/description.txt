Written by an experienced physicist who is active in applying computer algebra to relativistic astrophysics and education, this is the resource for mathematical methods in physics using Maple and Mathematica. Through in-depth problems from core courses in the physics curriculum, the author guides students to apply analytical and numerical techniques in mathematical physics, and present the results in interactive graphics. Around 180 simulating exercises are included to facilitate learning by examples.

This book is a must-have for students of physics, electrical and mechanical engineering, materials scientists, lecturers in physics, and university libraries.
