i just finished downloading this movie. unfortunatey my drive c crashed which erased all my program files. and the problem is that I cannot extract the ISO file of this movie to dvd files. it looks like that any of my movies in NTI - ISO files in my laptop cannot be read including the RAR files. any solutions for that?

,garycarradine,2012-06-12T18:35Z,hope to hear from you soon :))
[T],Auge,2012-06-12T19:00Z,"If I understand what you are saying correctly you are asking how you can unpack ISOs.

If I am wrong let me know.

Here are three options I know of:

1.       Download and install something like WINZIP/WINRAR to unpack them.

2.       Use NERO to burn ISOs to a disc without having to unpack them.

3.       DVDFab will shrink, repack and/or burn to a DVD or any combination of the three you choose.

All three of these software options should be available at your favorite torrent tracker.

Hope this helps.

,Waikiki2008,2012-06-28T21:23Z,"Auge, your unusually lengthy sabbatical has me and I suspect many others feeling nervous and in some cases desperate. Hoping all is well."
,baybeh,2012-07-01T17:11Z,This is rich and exquisite. Thank you so much Auge.
,Jesus_Christ,2012-09-11T09:29Z,"Thanks.  I only had the ""Love Conquers All"" version."
