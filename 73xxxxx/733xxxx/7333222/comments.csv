,anguus24,2012-06-14T21:00Z,"same problem, any news?????"
,Smallz94,2012-06-21T00:45Z,"1. download wave 15 in the abgx360 site and then go to download page..

2. download the wave 15 rar file. Inside of the rar has a iso file. This will be need for AutoFixing XGD2 games that have corrupt or incorrect Video data.

3. It will take about 30 minutes to download.

4. After you finish downloading it, you have to drag the wave 15 iso file to the stealth folder in your abgx360 folder. This is the name Video_F0420AFA. If you have trouble finding the folder, open up abgx360 and then press Ctrl + F this will lead to the stealth folder. Then drag the iso wave 15 file in it.

5. Then run it again with the game."

Stealth check failed!

AutoFix Failed!"
