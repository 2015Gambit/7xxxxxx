In your torrent downloader look for share ratio if not there right click in banner headings (where name, down speed,upspeed are.. etc) check ratio box. A ratio 1:1 means you shared exactly what you downlaoded."

YES, THIS ONE IS FLAGGED. Paramount Pictures is watching this one. My advice to you is to download the low seeded and wait it out unless you like being watched and considered for court action. Let me clarify- of no fault to BOZX... excellent quality. The torrent just got too popular. Great work BOZX, does not mean his other downloads are flagged. "
