Quote:
Julian Plenty - is the alter ego of Paul Banks, guitarist, vocalist and main lyricist of Interpol. His solo work is still the same interpolovsky post-punk, but perhaps a little different perspective, and very very dilute chamber attacks. According to the musician, the album sounds "bold and sexy," "My music is similar to Interpol, spevshihsya to Beirut┬╗. Banks writes under the name of Plenty for several years, so the album will include both newly composed songs and a few tracks, made 10 years ago. How wonderful it is said in the review of the Clash Music: ┬½This collection of eleven great songs that will annoy and inspire at the same time, its charming mix of loans from different musical directions."
