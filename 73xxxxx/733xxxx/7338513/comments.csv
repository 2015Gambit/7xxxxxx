,shdwolf1,2012-06-08T13:11Z,"Thx Slowquin, much appreciated. getting better, but is it just me, or does she seem a little awkward at how to tease? Either that, or the photographer doesn't get it. Was abt to write this one off, til the last dozen or so pics...still needs to step it up, but at least she's getting closer to showing us something. Hope the next  one is even better."
