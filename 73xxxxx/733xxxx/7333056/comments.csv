,Demonscream,2012-06-18T17:19Z,Could someone please explain how to install it? I know how to mount isos and stuff.
,happyblade,2012-06-20T11:22Z,"once you install the game, run the update, then put the crack fix contents in the game launcher folder not the game folder. This will bypass the ubisoft login and allow you to play the game. Though it does crash for me after about 5 hours.... "
,Hills1994,2012-06-26T03:47Z,Is there any why I can download just the crack file?
,RFSMassacre,2012-06-27T10:08Z,"This needs more seeders, so I will seed once it fully downloads.

@Hills1994: There should be an option on most torrent downloader clients to be able to choose which files to downloads out of the torrent selected."
,udai_jain,2012-06-28T18:32Z,"After installing the game, we let the game auto update, THEN WHAT????
Someone please help....."

,dimitar41,2012-07-18T13:56Z,"i instaled the game and update it,i put the crack but i cant play it"
,bLAsT2498,2012-07-18T18:00Z,"happyblade, where is the launcher folder ?"
,maswanto,2012-07-21T11:39Z,"cant playid, dont download... wasting your time ...."
,Secret999,2012-07-24T20:39Z,"Works, however I freeze at a cut scene when I am receiving my hidden blade.  Crack goes in GAME LAUNCHER!!! Not game folder. Please don't wine it works."
,Secret999,2012-07-24T21:21Z,Edit* It doesn'e freeze anywhere. You can unfreeze it at that point. Works flawlessly. 
,ge654321,2012-08-22T00:06Z,How can you actually 'unfreeze' it at that scene? Haven't figured that out yet; anyone knows?
,electizer,2012-09-05T14:11Z,"To anyone having a problem with the crack, go to the game's default installation folder (no matter if you changed it) which is usually C:Program filesUbisoftUbisoft game launcher 
or C:Program files x64ubisoftubisoft game launcher  "
,electizer,2012-09-05T14:12Z,"^ sorry the slashes were deleted it's:
C:Program files/Ubisoft/Ubisoft game launcher 
or C:Program files x64/ubisoft/ubisoft game launcher"
,Animeman1000,2012-09-13T19:22Z,"So if anyone could help with the freezing. It seems to freeze for everyone when you receive the hidden blade, but no ones really commented on this torrent. Someone help."
,Animeman1000,2012-09-13T19:36Z,Nevermind guys. We're all stupid (Includes me). When it stops it's not freezing. It's waiting for you to select the hidden blade which if you kept the default controls would be #2 on the top under the F1-F12 buttons. Silly peoples. lol
