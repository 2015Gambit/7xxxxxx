,cawoodie,2012-06-06T21:51Z,Is this a trial? I could never find an Adobe Dreamweaver upload that works beyond the 30 day trial period.
,Crusisx,2012-06-06T22:11Z,"@cawoodie
Yes it is the trial but, comes with a patch dll file "
,cawoodie,2012-06-06T22:59Z,"Thanks Crusisx, I'll give it a shot and will also comment and seed if it works. "
,sheeptwo,2012-06-07T11:17Z,Is this the same as thethingy's? Does the dream weaver use 100% of your core when idle after you replace the dll?
,Crusisx,2012-06-07T11:44Z,"@sheeptwo
nope this is the full version with a new dll file resolving that issue"
,sheeptwo,2012-06-07T12:59Z,"I compared the cracked DLL with another one that I had. It's exactly the same.

I installed everything on VMWare and the Dreamweaver had exactly the same problem that I was talking about: 100% CPU usage of one Core / Thread when idle (it drops to normal if you open a menu)... Check it out, man."
,sheeptwo,2012-06-07T13:01Z,On the i7 machine it would show as ~12.5% CPU usage.
,Crusisx,2012-06-07T14:07Z,"@sheeptwo
thats weird when ever I have a core idle it said 50% CPU usage my apologizes man will fix this soon"
,C1hrisin,2012-06-14T17:40Z,I also get 50% CPU when running idle
,modbase,2012-06-17T12:37Z,"Hey Crusisx, could u fix the 50/100% CPU usage?"
,blankz025,2012-06-18T12:37Z,Waiting till this issue have been resolve. BTW Crusisx do you have acrobat professional 9?
,Trishka1,2012-06-23T14:00Z,Could you add lynda.com adobe dreamweaver cs6 essential training?
,callmewaffle,2012-06-26T06:48Z,"Does anyone know how to check whether it's a trial or full version? 

Thanks. :D"
,MasterColac,2012-06-27T05:40Z,"@callmewaffle 
Read the bloody comments, its a trial with a .dll file!"
,sarahLL88,2012-06-29T18:47Z,Thank you so much for doing this! It works perfectly. =)
,MasterColac,2012-07-02T04:48Z,"Running off a 32 bit vista, works a charm, simply remember to follow the instructions perfectly and it'll work fine.
You may get an adobe account login prompt, just register at the adobe website, login and continue the process."
,vaish,2012-07-12T16:16Z,Works perfect! Thanks :D
,Fking2,2012-08-03T19:56Z,Running at 12% when idle on i7 at four core 3.4ghz with 64 bit windows 7
,yungreezy,2012-08-21T02:16Z,"I have the 50% cpu usage problem as well, which is of lame but it works great other than that."
,Mulambo80s,2012-08-27T18:41Z,"25% of CPU usage, have a fix for this?

But also a Great torrent!"
,JakeC267,2012-08-28T04:32Z,"Hey, the program in general runs great, but i keep having issues when i try to use the business catalyst... whenever i try to use it, the whole program crashes and closes on me. Any tips or ideas on how i can fix this? or what might be wrong with it?"
,JakeC267,2012-08-31T00:53Z,"Found Bug with the Business Catalyst feature... only works the first time you install DW CS6, once you logout of the catalyst or restart your computer, catalyst stops working, and crashes the whole DW program, any ideas on how to fix this?

I have personally found that the only way around this is to re-install the program, but that's only a temporary fix for being able to use it again after you restart windows. 

A more permanent solution would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
,PacoCoco,2012-08-31T08:36Z,"Hey guys. When I try to install the Trial version, once I have chosen my language and click accept, it asks me to enter my Adobe ID to start my trial. It wants me to sign in.. Any help would be very much appreciated.. Thanks."
,KB19,2012-09-09T15:24Z,This is only installing into the x86 directory. It's supposed to be x64 as well. Am I missing something?
