Queen of Hearts

Making an album is a journey across mountains and valleys of moods and emotions. Sometimes the sessions are pure flow, joyful, easy and inspired. And, of course, on other days the creative process is like pulling hairs. Agonizing, depressing, and seemingly impossible. I always see my weaknesses as a musician and, on the other side of the coin, how ridiculously self-critical I am. And sometimes IΓÇÖm amazed and inspired by my own seemingly endless well of inspiration. Where does it come from? Well, I have no question about that. ItΓÇÖs a direct gift from my GuruΓÇª. Hopefully, through it all, I can learn and grow as a musician, but more importantly as a human being crawling along the path of spirit and love.

Anyway, just like every album seems to have its own flavor, the process of making the albums is also quite different from one to the other. And the weird part is that the final ΓÇÿproductΓÇÖ doesnΓÇÖt always seem to reflect the moods that went into making it. Some albums that were torturous to create sound sweet and joyful, while some of the ones that were super easy sound kind of tortured. At least to my ΓÇÿunbiasedΓÇÖ ears.

Why am I writing this? Well, mainly just as an introduction to the world of Queen Of Hearts. This album was a total breeze to make. The songs had been percolating inside of me for years; the musical ΓÇÿstyleΓÇÖ, mixing reggae, ska, samba and traditional Bengali Kirtan, although quite new, seems like itΓÇÖs been around for ages. IΓÇÖve been listening to and loving reggae since I was a teenager, (you can hear it in some of my ΓÇÿPagan Love OrchestraΓÇÖ work) but I had put it aside for a while, exploring other worlds. And, of course, the marriage of India and Brazil is sort of my life! So put it all together, and youΓÇÖve got Queen Of Hearts!

But thatΓÇÖs not all there is to it. Who is the ΓÇ£QueenΓÇ¥? Well, of course, She is Srimati Radharani, Herself. That very One who is most loved by Sri Krishna and who blesses the three worlds with the treasure of Bhakti, or Divine Love. So when the idea came (from where?) to dedicate an album to the Goddess Radha, I can only guess that She simply made it easy. Sure, it was hard work. But that mysterious element that we call ΓÇÿflowΓÇÖ was always there. The songs kind of wrote themselves. The musical parts were recorded easily. The singing was relatively effortless. We laughed A LOT!

Now, does all that translate to the final CD? The answer to that question has to come from YOU! Is it uplifting and joyful? Or angst-ridden and cathartic? Or all of the above?

Let me know, ok?

And, most of all, may the blessings of the Queen of Hearts rain down upon us all!!!!!

Jai.
