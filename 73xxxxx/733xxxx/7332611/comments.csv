,Bkybridge,2012-06-07T13:02Z,I just want to say thanks for all the obscure Bogart films that have been uploaded. A few months back I started reading a bio on him and have watched the films as I reached them in the book and these recent uploads have filled in a lot of my holes in his 1930's films. So many thanks.
