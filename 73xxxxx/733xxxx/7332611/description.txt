        The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse was successful on the London stage and mildly 
        so in New York.The producers have retained the basic idea from the play 
        [by Barre Lyndon] - that of a veteran physician whose study of the 
        physiological effects of crime on its habitues takes him on a series of
        ventures with a skilled gang of crooks. This thread has been followed even
        to the deliberate poisoning of the gangster chief by the doctor when he  
        learns of a hood- lum's blackmailing scheme.But in many respects it is an 
        outright gangster film with the medico's study of criminals as the excuse
        for carefully diagraming the gang's operations. In addition, the feature 
        inculcates a bit of the sherlocking theme and modified romance.
        Claire Trevor, the ace fence for the thieves, is the sole romance that 
        enters the doctor's life.Edward G. Robinson, in the role of the criminal 
        medico, is at his best. Humphrey Bogart's interpretation of the gangster 
        chief, whose jealousy of Clitterhouse eventually builds to the blackmail 
        scheme,is topflight.
        Ronald Reagan's voice can be heard as a radio announcer, a job that Reagan
        held  before he started as a film actor.
