,K1bbler,2012-06-07T07:07Z,zero information supplied with torrent. 1.4gig for a dvd rip no thanks. Way better torrents out there for this movie which isn't even that great to begin with. Uploader is a waste of time and bandwidth.
,saint84,2012-06-07T10:49Z,agree . what would it takes to just provide a link to imdb?
,Cheops75,2012-06-07T11:07Z,"@k1bbler @sinat84 stop being an ass. What would it take for your to google it. We are all free loaders, so work at least to justify the fact that you have not uploaded a single shit. "
