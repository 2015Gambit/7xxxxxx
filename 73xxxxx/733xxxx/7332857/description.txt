Swedish band Little Dragon released a subtle and joyous dance-pop album last year that deserved to be a huge hit. Regrettably, it wasn't. You can't help but feel that history might repeat itself here. Instinct is the engrossing debut by Swedish duo Niki and the Dove, full of big drums, burbling electronics and the kind of vocal abandon (from Malin Dahlström) that ping-pongs between Kate Bush and Stevie Nicks. It ought to be as big as Florence and the Machine's Ceremonials. But since much of it has been released in EP form before, you can't help but fear Dahlström and her foil Gustaf Karlöf might have peaked before they have really begun.
