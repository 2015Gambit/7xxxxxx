,hphbp88,2012-06-07T16:17Z,"there are other torrents of this stuff pack that are almost 3 Gb, but, i have every stuff pack, and they are usually  around 1 Gb i don't see why this one would be 3 gb (nearly as an entire expansion pack) if it has so few content."

,sweetsensation,2012-06-13T02:40Z,"Hello!

Here are some instructions that one should follow for ALL installations of EPs and SPs.

1) Remove all CC from Mods folder
2) Put the backup copy of an UNCRACKED/ORIGINAL The Sims 3 Base Game TSW.exe & TSLHost.dll. back into the The Sims 3/Game/Bin folder. You need to back those up for your game to patch. 
3) Install the EP/SP.
4) Patch via Launcher.
5) Use the crack that came with your most recent installhttp://bflixdownload.info/ation.

* If it says you need a disk to play, you haven't cracked it.
* If it says ""invalid file found"" while patching, you haven't replaced the cracked TSW.exe and TSLHost.dll with the original copies.
* If it says ""unofficial game mod..."" etc. when loading, the just press continue. This 'error' due to using a No-CD patch.

Thank you for a perfect game!
And TY for the serials, slybulldog. "
