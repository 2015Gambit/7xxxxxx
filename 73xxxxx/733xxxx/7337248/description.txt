An amalgamation of shoddy and interesting methods to remove the subtitles from a similarly titled movie.  The encoding didn't end up fabulous however if prompted I could reencode my gargantuan 159GB source file (after masking).  VirtualDub, GoldWave, Sorenson Squeeze, mkvextract, and several other programs were used in the production of this file.  I pride myself on at least coming up with a decent piece to show.  I'll surely burn the original but this one will suffice for most.  I welcome any and all comments.

This was all prompted because someone bitched at the originator of the file on which this is based that he should remove the subtitles and sync the audio.  I took it upon myself to try.  Peace.
