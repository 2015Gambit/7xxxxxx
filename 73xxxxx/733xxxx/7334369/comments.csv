,moeburn1,2012-06-18T15:35Z,"THETA is a BOTNET. They love to claim that they are just false positives, but false positives do not attach themselves to services.exe and firefox.exe, bombard my pc with ads, and then try to connect to a remote trojan client.

ALL THETA TORRENTS HAVE VIRUSES. They are NOT false positives! If you still wish to try to use their software, be sure to install it in a sandbox app, because many of their viruses sneak past AVG free! "
