Plot: Millie Bartlett loves her chickens almost as much as her husband. Millie, a chicken farmer in financial straits, agrees to be on a reality show hosted by Angelica Lovecraft, a New Age fitness guru. Her show, Cut The Crap, is an East meets West blending of Zen & Capitalism where Angelica identifies, isolates and eliminates the crap in people’s lives. Millie thinks she’s found the solution to all her problems. But when Angelica suggests that her husband, Al, may be a piece of the crap she should jettison, a clash of opposites ensues and Millie realizes she’s let a wolf into the henhouse!
