,mentallyours,2012-06-08T19:34Z," LeBron James nearly matched his playoff career high with 45 points, as the Miami Heat ran away from the Boston Celtics with a 98-79 win in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. With the victory, Miami has forced a winner-take-all Game 7 back in Miami on Saturday night, with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. The reigning league MVP made sure of there would be a Game 7, playing at another level against Boston by scoring 30 of his 45 points in the first half on an array of tough baskets from all over the floor. The sensational start helped Miami sprint out to an early double-digit lead and they never looked back from there. James also grabbed a game-high 15 rebounds. Rajon Rondo had 21 points and 10 assists for Boston in the setback, as the Celtics dropped just their second game of this postseason at home"
