An application that allows anyone to look great in a photo
Portrait Professional is a sophisticated computer program that has been trained in male and female beauty. The software has been shown hundreds of examples of beautiful photographs of human faces, and using sophisticated statistical techniques, it has learnt how to subtly enhance photographs to make them more beautiful. What does this mean for you? It means that you can give your photographs an automatic "celebrity makeover" correcting the lighting and makeup, removing blemishes and generally making your subject look as good as possible.

Portrait Professional is a painting program that will not require any artistic skill. All you have to do is identify some points on the photo ΓÇö such as the corners of the eyes, and the edges of the lips ΓÇö and the software then calculates how to make your subject look their absolute best.
The software has been trained in all aspects of beauty. It allows you to choose how much to enhance the lighting, the skin texture and even how many wrinkles to remove. It even allows you subtly re-sculpt the face to make your subject look as good as possible.
Portrait Professional enhances people in the same way that good lighting and perfect makeup is used to make someone look more attractive. The software lets anyone look as good as a celebrity in a magazine.
