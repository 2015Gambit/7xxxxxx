No visit to Dublin is complete without a stroll round the lawns of Trinity College, an evening sampling the Guinness and the conversation at a few pubs, and a bit of shopping down O'Connell Street. This lavishly illustrated "Eyewitness Travel Guide" provides all that and more, including detailed maps, fully updated floor plans of the major museums, and excursions to the Wicklow Mountains and Newgrange. In short, this is the indispensable guide to the delights of the Irish capital.
