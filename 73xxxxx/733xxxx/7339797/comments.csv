Has anyone verified these? Any good?"
,Skram0,2012-09-20T06:34Z,"After downloading S01E01 and comparing it with HDNet's rip, the HDNet copy is a bit more vibrant and a little less visible compression.

I did a freeze frame side by side in VLC with no post processing. A 1.30GB file compared to 1.95GB. More data, more detail. Of course other episodes vary in size, but I'll just stick with my HDNet copies."
