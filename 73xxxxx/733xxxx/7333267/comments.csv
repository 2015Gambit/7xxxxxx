NOT a rehash! Surely,you know that this is 1 of 2 PREQUELS to the 1st ALIEN movie he made in 1979. In an interview back in 2008, Ridley Scott spoke how he had always wanted to make a sequel that explored who the RACE of beings were that brought a ship with a cargo hold slam full of those Eggs to that moon, 2ndly, The ALIENS themselves were more like an insect/colony type mentality and were likely NOT the owners of that ship but were some how able to be controlled by the ones that DID own and make that ship (the derelict ship that The NOSTROMO found, that looks like a big HORSE SHOE. . .sort of) In Promethues, you see HOW it became damaged and stuck on that moon.
BACK TO RIPLEY's INTERVIEW. . . He wasn't able to sell the producers on this idea and it wasn't until JAMES CAMERON came along in 1992 with a sequel screenplay that was liked by the producers (cameron didn't actually write this screen play, but was the one chosen to direct it (ALIENS -the 2nd ALIEN movie) as Ridley Scott wasn't interested in taking the plot in that direction. 
ANYWAY, Prometheus takes place approximately 70 years BEFORE Ripley and her crew mates  discovered what is now referred to as the ALIEN creature and the derelict ship. 
So it makes perfect sense as to the WHY and HOW The ""COMPANY"" (WEYLAND INDUSTRIES INC, later to integrate with the YUTANI corporation and becomes WEYLAND-YUTANI INC.) had previous knowledge of some unearthly technology being on that planet's moon (LV-186 or what ever designation it was given. . . can't recall this red hot minute)
SO, PROMETHEUS is NOT a re-hashing, it is in fact the continuation of the 1st ALIEN movie as RDILEY SCOTT and an American screenwriter named Dan O'Bannon envisioned the story in the 1st place. Just to be accurate, there was additional screenwriting help provided by Ronald Shusett, David Giler, and Walter Hill.
There is a 2nd ""PREQUEL"" to ALIEN that dives even deeper into who these ""ENGINEERS"" (as the are called by ELIZABETH SHAW in PROMETHEUS) Elizabeth Shaw is played by Noomi Rapace). This 2nd PREQUEL is already being shot, and will be released in late 2013 or early in 2014. 
I saw the 1st ALIEN film when I was 12 years old and it scared the shit out of me. I loved the film and its special effects were as good as Star Wars or BLADE RUNNER (also a R.SCOTT film). Lets not forget, the 1st ALIEN film was a pure HORROR film that just happened to take place in space and in the future.
My point is that to simply look at Prometheus as a re-hashing, is complete nonsense! It is where the plot should have taken the ALIEN franchise from the beginning. It explains many the important things that were mysteries of the original Alien Movie. If having an android on board, makes it a rehash (this was your other point) then ALL the Alien movies except for the 3rd are all re-hashes. the 2nd movie has BISHOP, in the 3rd movie, BISHOP is still in it, but also is still damaged from the queen ALIEN in the 2nd film that chopped him in to 2 pieces. In the 4th film (ALIEN RESURRECTION), Winona Ryder is the Android in that film. The ones with the Predators are not technically part of the ALIEN franchise, but are part of the PREDATOR line of films.

Sooooo.....got any comment on the quality of this upload ,like this comment thing is all about? Sure would like an expert opinion on it from a real expert. 
Ya know,Audio/Video,language,subtitles,run time?Maybe you can bore the crap out of everyone with a play by play of all the actors patting themselves on the back with their exceptionally brilliant insights or perhaps a behind the scenes bit to completely ruin the bit of fantasy films used to provide as an escape from the lifes everyday routines.All the wonderfull things no bloody one cares about but film students that are brainwashed into believing are the sole of Cinema.And lets not forget the vastly knowlegable critics who are so abundant these days,who pick the corn out of every turd called a movie, and call it small pieces of gold."

How you lika dat for a rambling diatribe ?"
,RTT2,2012-06-09T11:06Z,"Thanks Bob, great work!

@diarrym - I think you're taking randallytxt a bit literally. What I think he means is that specific scenes/ideas are being recycled, a common problem these days sadly as scriptwriters are generally reading less books and just watching films, so essentially you're getting a dilution of ideas that have already been diluted by the original film's adaptation process. That's Graham Linehan's (co-writer of Father Ted) theory anyway, and I think he's onto something, sadly!

Hope that wasn't too rambling a diatribe!;"
,hellotimo,2012-06-09T12:58Z,so... how's the quality of the video/audio ?
,KD271158,2012-06-09T16:09Z,"@ drunkbob Thanks for your contribution!
@hellotimo 
About 4/10 for both Video and Audio,watchable indeed! It's the same one on here under various different labels. Run it through some production software and it cleans up quite decentlyand is definitly attention holding throughout.
@RTT2
 I do like how you get straight to the point.Not at all windy.I have a theory of my own,goes like this...It's a lot easier to recycle leftover props and use a formula that's worked in the past until it's been beat beyound all interest to anyone,than it is to actually THINK of something new ! I guess with all the past success,the industry including teaching institutions would rather resort to sideshow chicanery and hold onto the mistaken idea that the general public are all slack jawed yokels who won't notice.

,shih9019,2012-06-23T12:21Z,"wow ... so much bickering ... but I do have to agree with randally text .... my first viewing left the same impression. The second time I watched it changed my view a little and DLARRYM ... after ruining it for everyone who hasnt seen it yet ... get your facts right too ... a prequel is not a continuation of alien 1 ... it is exactly that ,,, a prequel. Whew ... and the important part here is quality V & A 4.5"
