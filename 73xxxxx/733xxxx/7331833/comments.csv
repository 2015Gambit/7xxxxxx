Truely excellent quality considering it's a video recording taken from within the audience at a movie theatre.

Did you manage to sneak in a tripod and boom mike?

As for the film itself, it's totally unenjoyable rubbish. The director must be a first year film student who just happens to be the name sake of the famous one."

Thank you!"

 I'm very new to all this CamRip stuff and was wondering if you would have any pointers as to methods on how to handy-cam a cinema film, or links. 

This movie would seem be setting up a more profound final scene, and was perhaps cut short.

However, going for joy rides around an alien planet in baja-rail buggies, or wandering out of the communication seat whilst two crew members are lost are just too unrealistic.

Although, full credit to the stamina of the lead star for running and rolling away from a falling space ship, then jumping a gorge and running a whole lot more.

All that within an hour of a c-section?"

 Maybe, you can help.

How the hell can anyone get even a half decent picture with a handy cam in a cinema?"
