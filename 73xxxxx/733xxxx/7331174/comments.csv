,01entropy,2012-06-12T19:39Z,"We living in a fantasy world thugluv1877???
1 of them that escape into they're fantasy shows on TV because their live is so mundane???
Yep, Sons is REAL ""hardcore""...arguing over who was going to clean the toilet. Yep, that's tough PMSL
Re-read my post(s), & show me where I wrote it was ""hardcore"" ya drop-kick. NEWSFLASH for you...NEITHER is based on reality, but BW-BIA is MUCH more entertaining than Sons!"
,01entropy,2012-06-12T19:52Z,Stick with your neighbours/home & away shows mate. But I must warn you...they're not real either!
,boxin-granny,2012-06-17T01:35Z,"Thankyou Tony - Brilliant up - always waiting for the next upisode

Love This - used to live in the real Banditos Club House. - the same one that's in the series (outdoor shots only)"
,McGunt,2012-06-19T16:21Z,There's probably going to be a whole lot of in-fighting in the clubhouses when theses real tough dudes find out that half of them played cops in other series...Cheerios vs Doritos...they probably pay close attention to their personal hygene and manscaping...ha ha ha
