Iain Stewart looks at some of the world's most dramatic earthquakes and reveals
the stories and science behind them. In seconds, these powerful forces of nature
which cannot be predicted or prevented can shake a town to destruction and shift
the landscape forever. We discover why quakes can last 60 times longer on the
moon than on earth; how one particular earthquake fault line can produce
hallucinations; and how 1960s Cold War spying gave scientists a crucial clue to
understanding them.
