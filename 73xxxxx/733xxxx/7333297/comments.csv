,lassik2,2012-06-07T06:57Z,"Anyone downloading this because of the rumor involving the Jennifer Aniston nude scene will be sorely disappointed. That scene was cut from the movie before release. 

Most believe it was simply to hype up this otherwise shitty movie."

,Fritz.,2012-06-07T18:15Z,"@pornznz .. wow are you a moron or what?

i was thinking more like cleaning my house, studying for one of my college classes, or something along those lines...

the movie isnt that great, there were whole sections i just fast-forwarded through because they were so awful... like when he did the whole talking about his dick in the mirror... that was just torture for the viewer.


what is with these morons these days who think just because something is free its automatically awesome.

i just took a big fat shit, its free, you want it?
"
,Fritz.,2012-06-07T18:22Z,"im starting to wonder if these ""its free so its awesome"" posters are all basement dwelling losers with no lives or something.

there has to be some explanation why they dont mind wasting their time on garbage all the time.

i know between my responsibilities and college i have very little free time most days, so all i can guess is these posters like pornznz are unemployed and uneducated losers who live in their parents basements whose lives are so small and meaningless they literally have nothing better to do."

The numbers speak for themselves; Its a good movie.
Furthermore, pornznz wasn't emphasizing the fact that the movie was free. He was just saying you're a whiny little bitch.

,TtToker,2012-06-10T02:12Z,"good quality. very few funny moments. I think Paul Rudd is funny but not so much in this and Jennifer Aniston isn't funny and seems to be less attractive than normal. which i don't care for her anyway. I think she's annoying as shit and if you feel the same way, don't watch this because she is very annoying in this film. but if you find her funny and attractive, talk shit about me in the comment section because that's helpful too I'm sure...  Thanks for the up .BONE. "

So many of the .mp4 movies downloaded lately are out of sync, never had this problem with .avi's. I know sit at your computer like a retard and watch it on VLC. I happen to like my couch and TV though.

Anyway I ramble. Long story short... go fuck yourself."

,dlarrym1111,2012-06-24T08:54Z,"@ Alobarku. . .  Is 100% correct. You can even put H264 video into an AVI container. Not to mention it is incredible compatible. I don't know if a media player exists that is NOT compatible. I don't mind MP4's myself. It is the MKZ container that is a truly great container, but not so much with H264 being the type of VIDEO playback on machines that are a few years older.

Not sure what others are saying, but I found this movie quite funny, not hilarious- but still funny.

Then again I've been noticing lately that I seem to like the movies that everyone hates, and vice versa. Like that Project X, most people said it is the best movie ever. But I thought it was utter crap."
,balrog814,2012-06-27T11:14Z,"WizardAus word! I guess, these very young fools here can't watch hippies. As soon as they see the hippy element, they stop watching and write ignorant comments. While o t other hand they watch that utter crap project x, and it's about young dimwits, like they are, and go hahahahahah. If they'd given a little time, they'd realize, this movie is funnier. Crazy characters, but whatever, decide fuyaself. I recommend it."

Paul Rudd plays the same exact character as always. Why even change the name of his character in each movie? Just have Paul Rudd starring as Paul Rudd. Predictable mindless comedy, not worth paying for a movie ticket but worth watching for free."
