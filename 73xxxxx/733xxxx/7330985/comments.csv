,Roger3P,2012-08-15T11:50Z,"IF this is the same torrent I downloaded about a week or so ago (just checked, same files so must be) , then:

Audio: Sounds like a cheap radio (1.2)
Video: Looks like a VCD (1.7)

Bootlegged copy. Fail. Rather take time to download a decent rip.

The other ""NEW SOURCE (400MB) one looks to be the same bootleg btw."
