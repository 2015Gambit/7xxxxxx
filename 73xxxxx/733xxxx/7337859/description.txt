A gripping conspiracy thriller starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Christopher Eccleston, Lesley Sharp, Sir Antony Sher, Rafe Spall, Kierston Wareing and Stephen Rea.

Detective Inspector Jonah Gabriel (Ejiofor) takes on his first case since being shot in a botched police operation that left his partner dead. The new case involves investigating the murder of recently pardoned, drug baron Harvey Wratten. On the other side of the criminal divide, Joseph Bede (Eccleston), a former associate of WrattenΓÇÖs, is moved to make his own enquiries.

As Gabriel, dogged by amnesia and suspicious colleagues, follows a complicated line of investigation and Bede becomes increasingly desperate to see through a massive drugs operation that will enable him to step out of the business forever, the enigmatic and ruthless Gatehouse (Rea) emerges from the shadows to bring the story to a shocking climaxΓÇª
