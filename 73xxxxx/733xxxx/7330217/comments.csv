,mikegeraghty,2012-06-05T13:39Z,Thanks so much to jmanwf for Days Of Our Lives - Quick question is there any reason why episodes have dropped to 180mb
,disnfab,2012-06-05T13:54Z,In my opinion you spend a lot less time seeding a good quality 180mb file compared to about two times that size. :)

Wow just Downloaded the 180mb episode and quality is as good as the 350mb ones - Fantastic at a lower size - Thanks again to jmanwf for sharing"
