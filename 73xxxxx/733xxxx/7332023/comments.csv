* Extra program tomorrow. 60 minutes !!*



The football is almost here !!

Scotland is absent as usual. 
We have a very close bond with our old friends across the channel, so I'll be shouting for France again.

My Moe friend is Scandinavian so I guess that 
she'll be shouting for Denmark.

So what about a France V Denmark final  !!

Vive La France, og Sk책l til Danmark !!

the new size is great for me, the other looked a little bit crunched from the sides, on my screen at least.

i really hope england and spain dont have to play against each other in the 2nd round as im half english and half spanish! :S"
