After being frozen in time for 300 years, captain Dylan Hunt and his sentient 
warship Andromeda sets out to restore peace and civilization to the known universe. 
With him is the crew of the ship that, with profit in mind and unknowing of her 
captain still being alive, salvaged Andromeda from the black hole keeping her 
suspended in time. Andromeda originally hid in the black hole after a big 
battle. When Captain Hunt wakes up he realizes that this battle was the beginning 
of an epic war and that the great civilization he was defending, the Commonwealth, 
has been eradicated from existence. He and his unlikely and sometimes unpredictable 
crew starts on a mission to once again bring hope to the galaxy.
