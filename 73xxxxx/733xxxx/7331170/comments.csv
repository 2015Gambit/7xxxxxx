,Cerebral222,2012-06-06T13:25Z,"Thanks esharoth, never had an issue with any of your torrents; don't know why they haven't given you a skull yet, but all in good time, +1 rep, cheers."
,aa1234779,2012-06-07T03:44Z,should I get this or razors?
,tweakmode,2012-06-08T08:12Z,"does this work w/ a controller?

I tried one of tha other torrents for this game & had an issue w/ a huge offset virtual deadzone where UP on tha joysticks will look up slowly but down will look down regular speed, and it seemed intermittent. Not my controller cuz controller works flawlessly in other games."
,kragnass,2012-06-10T18:07Z,"Works great, and very easy to install. I like the game because it feels new and has good graphics but doesn't take an expensive PC to run."
,theath5,2012-06-14T08:15Z,it says i am missing d3dx9_38.dll from my computer. any help or where i can download it?
[T],esharoth,2012-06-18T22:04Z,Install the latest DirectX redistributable from Microsoft's website.
,SlinkyMilinky,2012-06-19T10:16Z,"I click on the shortcut or .exe to launch the game, my screen goes black for a couple of seconds then I get an error message saying ""You do not have sufficient access privileges to run the game. Please contact your administrator."" 

I've tried running as admin in the compatibility tab as well as right clicking and I get the same message, anyone else had this problem?

If it helps I have windows 7 ultimate 32-bit."
,SlinkyMilinky,2012-06-24T07:37Z,Anyone know of a solution for this ^^^
[T],esharoth,2012-07-23T17:53Z,"Search for the following terms: ""windows 7 take ownership of folder"", and try following some of the guides from the search results. "
