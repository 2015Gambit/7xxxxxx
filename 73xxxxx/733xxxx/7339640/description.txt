Here is a collection of Subtitle files I made to work with most of the versions of the "The Avengers" Movie out there, you can download them and pick which one that fits the movie you have and use it.

I made them to translate the forign language sections to English with what is said, and not with the broken english, so people know what was said and not a rough translation of the words. Because when I saw some of the translations out there, I said that doesn't make any sense, so made these to make what was said clear to all english speakers.
