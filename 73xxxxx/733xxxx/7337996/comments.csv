For God's sake, Immerse, drop this series. You got no idea what the hell you're doing."
,Kknewkles,2012-06-08T18:27Z,"Just to be as clear as possible - video rarely goes fluent and frames skip like 4 times a second.
People, don't waste your time downloading this big pile of crap. Not worth your time, which I've waited 8 hours to finish the download."

Yeah there were a couple of moments when part of the picture was in wrong colors, but no freezes|stops."
