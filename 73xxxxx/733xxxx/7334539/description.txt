Great game. The disc I ripped it from was scratched but I could still play through the whole game without freezing, glitching, etc. Remember, this is NTSC so don't go bitching in the comments if you played the game on your PAL TV and it exploded. Remember you need a modchip too or else your PS2 will give you an RSOD so don't bitch in the comments saying you pissed your pants when you saw the RSOD. You could also ESR patch this game if you have FreeMCBoot. But this game is the game you have to buy legit and rip and replace the driving level with uLaunchELF and burn to DVD and when you complete the first mission you swap the disc (cogswap on fat ps2, cover sensors on slin) remember thats not compatible with any slim made after march 2008.
