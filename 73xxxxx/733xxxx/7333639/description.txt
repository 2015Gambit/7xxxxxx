Season 2 Episode 6 of ABC (Australia) Laid Series. 

Laid is about a woman who every man she sleeps with dies... it's more tasteful than you would think. 

Respect to reapster1 for seeding the first series, I was out of Australia at the time, and would have never got to see it had it not been for reapster1
