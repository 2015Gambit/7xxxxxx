Finbar has already achieved legendary status as a folk icon to a whole generation and Colours, with its powerful mix of contemporary original songs and intriguing, modern interpretations of classic Irish songs guarantees his status as one of today's greatest Irish performers and will instantly appeal to a new audience. The album features guest performances from Shayne Ward, winner of The X Factor, and Mary Black as well as a cover of Bob Dylan's timeless "Blowin' In The Wind"

Starting in the late-1960s and with different configurations of his brothers in The Fureys, Finbar has been well respected for his voice, guitar and banjo playing. As one of the finest uilleann pipe players in the world, he pushed the instrument of his Irish roots into the sphere of contemporary music. His influence can be heard throughout recent years’ popular music from Riverdance to Black 47. The Fureys had a dozen high charting singles in Ireland, England and Australia, most recently in 2008. Early in his career, Finbar and his brother Eddie had a stint in the groundbreaking band The Clancy Brothers.

Outside of his songwriting and performing, Finbar has had success as an actor appearing in films including Martin Scorsese’s Gangs of New York. He recently appeared in the films Paris/Sexy and Strength and Honour as well as the RTÉ Television series Love/Hate.
