Hi.

The folder "Pre-IB HL" contains information and resources compiled by Mrs. Passerella for all prospective IB Math HL students. It includes extra practice work, some new IB concepts and a lot of extra resources to help us get a head start and the appropriate preparation for IB Math HL.

NOTE: Read the document "Books and resources.docx" first. It contains directions to help us use the rest of the folder.
