BBC 10 Things You Didn't Know About Avalanches (2008)

 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008vrwk

Iain Stewart travels across mountain ranges and glaciers to reveal ten
remarkable stories about avalanches.

Over a million avalanches happen throughout the world each year, and yet we know
more about the surface of the moon than we do about the chaotic turbulence
inside an avalanche. Scientists have had to put themselves right inside a raging
avalanche to find out more.

Stewart shows how the deadliest avalanche in history killed 18,000 people in
three minutes; how Hannibal's army was devastated by avalanches as he crossed
the Alps to fight Rome; why an avalanche was key to one of the greatest aviation
mysteries of all time; and how global warming may increase the rate of ice
avalanches in the future.
