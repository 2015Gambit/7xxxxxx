Romeo and Juliet from Shakespeare's Globe Theatre captured from Sky Arts 2.

Dominic DromgooleΓÇÖs 2009 production brings refreshing clarity to one of ShakespeareΓÇÖs most famous and best-loved tragedies, drawing out the contemporary relevance of this passionate teenage love story. Ellie Kendrick, a truly youthful Juliet, and Adetomiwa Edun, a boyish Romeo, head an excellent cast whose period costumes point to the timelessness of parental disapproval, adolescent temperament, rivalry and violence. Filmed before a live audience at ShakespeareΓÇÖs Globe in the heart of London, its intimate and atmospheric setting adds immediacy and vitality to the humour and passion of ShakespeareΓÇÖs verse.
