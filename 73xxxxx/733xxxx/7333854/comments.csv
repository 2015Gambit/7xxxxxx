,ufalum88,2012-06-06T20:16Z,Thank you for uploading something other than an .mkv.  Is this a conversion of one of those files or it's own rip?
[V],joshua13,2012-06-06T20:25Z,"like the mkv;s  for superior x.264 codec inside, hate them because conversion to mp4 is needed for mobile devices. love when people upload mp4. xvid codec is antiquated and inferior. time to move on"
