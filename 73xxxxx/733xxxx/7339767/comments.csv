,atomicBS,2012-06-08T22:28Z,Tomorrow morning i'll be having Fiber Bredband YAY :D
,stuckonloader,2012-06-08T23:48Z,But why waste your bandwidth on such a ho-hum movie?
,atomicBS,2012-06-09T02:56Z,Well bcoz it's a movie nonetheless and I got plenty more over here :D
,atomicBS,2012-06-09T02:58Z,Oh and I got no limits per month ^_^
,stuckonloader,2012-06-09T05:03Z,"Yo, you are limited by drive space.  Why not save for blockbusters? ^_^"
,atomicBS,2012-06-09T05:19Z,Am I limited to drive space? EXACTLY I'M NOT :DDD
,atomicBS,2012-06-09T05:34Z,"Nor do my leechers am I right? ;) BTW in case you've missed the point this is the only UNRATED and FULLHD version you'll find in thepiratebay
as for space there is a lot of external drives out there Why people can't buy some? You can afford blockbusters but not an External HD?! seriously? Like 10 3d movies you see or even 30 2d with same amount of cash you could get an external and infinite HD Movies all the way so...AM I DUMB??!
Well trudat HDTVs are not that cheap, I got them bcoz my family could afford it as for Internet they think it's useless bcoz they don't know anything about it so they don't waste time surfin' which is why I got a sorta mid-grade ADSL broadband atm but I managed that out and in just a couple hours to get some Fiber rockin' :P
If you still have something wrong with my upload go ahead but think about what I've said first k ty =]"
,atomicBS,2012-06-09T13:29Z,"F I B E R ---> ON , ENJOY :D"
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-06-12T02:43Z,Can you provide us with the Bizarro Cut?  I would be grateful!
,atomicBS,2012-06-12T14:48Z,"If you find a REMUX with it, reply the adress, otherwise as for now that's all I got. I'm sorry."
,atomicBS,2012-06-12T14:48Z,Ugh I meant address
,Nearsighted_Scrappile,2012-06-12T16:59Z,"The Bizarro Cut has only been available as streaming so far that I could find.  The Blu is supposed to include it, but with the way things are worded on the various pre-orders, it's not 100% clear what edition it is going to be on."
,atomicBS,2012-06-12T20:30Z,"""but with the way things are worded on the various pre-orders, it's not 100% clear what edition it is going to be on""
What to expect? welcome to the Internet
They say one thing then they do other thing :/"
,guccicar,2012-06-13T08:28Z,My complaint is why is it so big without a lossless audio? 20 gigs and not DTS HD MA?
,atomicBS,2012-06-14T15:15Z,"@guccicar LOL, the Audio is DTS-HD.MA.5.1 
it's clearly stated on the title of the movie and the torrent...I did a mistake on the INFO (I apologize) but thanks for reporting. ^-^"
,atomicBS,2012-06-14T15:18Z,"@guccicar BTW THERE IS NO SINGLE TORRENT UPLOADED BY ME WHICH HAS OR WILL HAVE DTS ONLY...ALL FILES GOT DTS-HD MA 5.1 OR 7.1 
ok from now on i'll be putting the correct info and proper title as well thanks again."
,atomicBS,2012-06-14T15:25Z,"@guccicar UPS I made a mistake once again,
the muppets one is DTS only (pardon me) but anyhow that was the first torrent that I uploaded so it was my first mistake i mean first time is ok right? lol well alrighty :)"
,atomicBS,2012-09-13T14:31Z,RLY? mkay seeding in some days...
