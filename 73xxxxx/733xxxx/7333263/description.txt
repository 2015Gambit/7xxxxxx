This is the famous 1982 Christmas SNL in which it was revealed that
Nick Nolte got sick and couldn't host the show, so his "48 Hours" co-star
Eddie Murphy filled in.  This was regarded as the only show hosted by 
a current cast member, but really it wasn't. It was the first time however.

After Eddie left late in the 9th year, he came back one time the following 
season to host the 1984 Christmas episode.
