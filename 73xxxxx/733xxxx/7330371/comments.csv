[V],bestec1234,2012-06-05T19:16Z,"Unfortunately, no word.  Nadine was in an accident before she started modeling where she almost lost her legs.  In her earlier sets they hid them but in some of her later sets you can see the scars.  This hospital stay may or may not be related to that, I don't know.

My guess is that they probably won't ever say what's wrong, out of privacy concerns."
,-darkangl-,2012-06-06T15:55Z,Oh well.  In any case I hope she's ok.  Thanks for that info.  I had no idea.
