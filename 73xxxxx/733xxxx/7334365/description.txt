I was 10 years old when the Stones grabbed ahold of me. I heard "Time Is On My Side" on the AM radio and from that point on, the Rolling Stones have become part of the music track of my life.

Collecting Rolling Stones songs and albums is a task. Songs on the UK album versions are repeated on differently named US albums. Some songs have mono with stereo versions besides, some are live and some are simply mixed differently on compilation albums.

What we have here is MY collection, a total of 391 songs. Some songs are duplicated because of the above reasons and to keep albums intact. Be assured it's a great and (almost) a complete collection of The Rolling Stones. I didn't label it a discography as I have deleted many duplicates (most from the compilation or singles collections) but pretty much any Stones song you want is here. Studio albums HAVE been kept intact.

Presented in Apple Lossless. All tracks were converted from FLAC files or CD's using XLD for those of us who use iTunes and/or Apple products. No cue or logs. Simply pulled from my iTunes library. Album art is embedded in the songs. It is true lossless so you are getting the best.
