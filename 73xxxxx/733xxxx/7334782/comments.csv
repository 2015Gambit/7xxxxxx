,JHarshaw,2012-08-08T21:22Z,During install this unpacks temporary files labeled Adware.Softomate.  This is a known PUP that may be harmless or it's the version that installs the Adware toolbar and generates garbage ads...hard to remove. Malwarebytes wants to quarantine it. Can somebody confirm what this is before I have to Sandbox it?
