They are wanting to replace it with another avengers show that is more like Ultimate Spider-Man and in that universe (can we say Super Hero Squad 2?). This is not a joke.  My family (Me, Girfriend, and 2yr old daughter, she call it ""Hulk"") love this show and the story arcs are amazing.  Its the best Marvel cartoon sense the early 90s Spider-Man and X-Men cartoons.  So, please, please, help to stop this from happening.

THEY ARE GOING TO CANCEL THIS SHOW SO PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION!
