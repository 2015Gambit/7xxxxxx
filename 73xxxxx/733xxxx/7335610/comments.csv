,babybluetits24,2012-06-07T15:35Z,"In Dumbarton, Scotland, a journalist uncovers a sixty-year history of dogs jumping to their death from a fifteen meter bridge. Could something be luring the dogs to the other side? In Kerala, India, villagers hear a loud sonic boom one morning and wake to see blood red rain falling from the sky. Is it just desert dust or could it be evidence of extra-terrestrial life? Lions living in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania are exhibiting disturbing behaviour: violent seizures and battles to the death with other lions. As the death toll climbs, will investigators identify the cause before the great beasts are pushed to the brink?

Everyone please seed or reseed this it says just 38 seed, if u find any file with low seeds & you still have the file please reseed (start sharing the file again from utorrent etc) torrent sites may not be around for ever so always help out. If you find a file lacking useful details like imdb info or wikipedia info please copy & paste it into a comment to help every1 else out, and always report viruses to the suprbay forum thanks ps dont forget the faster you seed uploading the faster your files download so set upload speed to unlimited in Utorrent etc "
