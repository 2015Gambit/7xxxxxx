aroj lives a middle-classed lifestyle in Ahmednagar along with her dad, Diwakar; mom Shalini; and younger brother Sanju. At the age of 4, she became ill and lost the use of both her legs, and since then has been wheel-chair bound. Her parents took her to several doctors and specialists, who placed her on a variety of medications, but it was all in vain. Years later, Saroj is still wheel-chair bound, often refuses to take her medication, and is generally upset and depressed over the futility of her condition. Her parents decide to take her to a temple near a town where Diwakar's sister lives, so that Saroj could obtain Devi Maa's blessings and hopefully be able to walk again. After they return from the Mandir, Shalini and Diwakar go to do some shopping while Diwakar's sister returns to her place of employment. They will soon be summoned back by the Police, where they will find Saroj being held captive by a ruthless killer
