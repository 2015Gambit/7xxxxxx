,donthefonz,2012-06-08T14:01Z,it was not a matter of give and take I can not even get on the site from my or my friends house
,donthefonz,2012-06-10T01:53Z,they wont even let me uplaod back the stuff I got you would think they would at least let me give stuff to other people but i guess that showing me is more important than there costumers are to them
