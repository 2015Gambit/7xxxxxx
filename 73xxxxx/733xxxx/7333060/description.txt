DESCRIPTION:

A vegan diet-one without any animal products-is unusually healthy because it is high in fiber, low in saturated fat, and very nutritious. 
Nine-time Olympic gold medal winner Carl Lewis says, "My best year of track competition was the first year I ate a vegan diet. . . . 
My weight is under control, I like the way I look, I enjoy eating more, and I feel great."
