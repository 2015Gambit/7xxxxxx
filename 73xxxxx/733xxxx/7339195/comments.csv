It will begin uploading soon"
,LtFred,2012-06-15T07:53Z,"Not to be a whiner or anything, but I'm having problems when trying to run the game. It seems to have installed alright, but now when I run it, it does nothing."
,Tayend,2012-06-15T13:45Z,"Fast seeding, easy to install. Worked perfectly fine for me!"
,tortnotes,2012-06-23T03:50Z,"I can't get past the prompt for a serial--there's not one included with this torrent that I could find. Other cracks are making the game crash while loading a level. 

Suggestions? "

,7oran,2012-06-25T22:09Z,"I have same problem, good install, but when i click on it, nothing happens. Any suggestion?"
,keirajasmin,2012-07-06T13:15Z,"After I installed the game, it keeps saying ""d3dx9_41.dll is missing"" and I have the most recent Directx plus I restarted my computer after downloading it, it still didn't work and then after uninstalling it and reinstalling it, it still has the same error. 

Other then that problem, the download was probably the fastest out of all of them and was the only one to actually make it to 100% for me."
,a1c2x3,2012-08-20T15:23Z,It keeps asking for my CD key =/
