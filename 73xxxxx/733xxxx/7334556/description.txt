The Ed Show special, live from Wisconsin June 5, 2012. Technically he ended all of this when it was 6/6/12. Results, 1. Walker wins recall, reaction. 2. Democrats regain state Senate with the only working recall (unbeknownst to Ed). Question if this is a victory of money versus grassroots, what does this mean for OFA organization for the presidential election.
