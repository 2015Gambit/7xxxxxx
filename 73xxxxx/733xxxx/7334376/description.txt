A plague of mysterious origin has swept around the world, killing most of the human population. An ex-Ranger and his thirteen-year-old son are left alone on their farm with no government to rely on. They have taken in refugees, so they may all have a better chance to survive. Together, they farm the land and struggle to feed themselves while guarding against murderous raiders who choose to take from others rather than work for survival. Personal bonds are steeled in a post-apocalyptic world where a friend is defended with your life, a foe fought to the death, and refusing to be a victim demands killing without hesitation.

A son must rely on his father to build a new moral compass in a land of violence. ΓÇ£Dad and I donΓÇÖt quit on each other, and we donΓÇÖt quit on our friends.ΓÇ¥ But despite best efforts, some are lost and others grievously wounded. Their farm is in danger and they face starvation without it.
