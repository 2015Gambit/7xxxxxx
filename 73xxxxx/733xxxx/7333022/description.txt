This is a complete installation of World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade (v2.4.3) for Mac OS; it is patched correctly from v1.9.4 and contains all necessary files sans the official launcher.

Additionally, the realmlist.wtf file is modified to allow for instant play on the Hav0c Network. Info about registering for our BC realm can be found here: http://wow.hav0c.com/
