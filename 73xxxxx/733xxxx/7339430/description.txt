ΓÇó How are birds so good at flying and navigating?
ΓÇó Why are birds so like mammalsΓÇô and yet so very different?
ΓÇó Did birds descend from dinosaurs, and if so, does that mean birds are dinosaurs?
ΓÇó How do they court each other and fend off rivals?
ΓÇó What' s being communicated in birdsong?
ΓÇó Can we ever know how birds think?

In this fascinating exploration of the avian class, Colin Tudge considers the creatures of the air. From their evolutionary roots to their flying, feeding, fighting, mating, nesting, and communicating, Tudge provocatively ponders what birds actually doΓÇôas well as why they do it and how. With the same curiosity, passion, and insight he brought to redwoods, pines, and palm trees in his widely acclaimed book The Tree, Tudge here studies sparrows, parrots, and even the Monkey-eating Eagle to better understand their worldΓÇôand our own.
There is far more to a bird's existence than gliding gracefully on air currents or chirping sweetly from fence postsΓÇôthe stakes are life and death. By observing and explaining the complex strategy that comes into play with everything from migration to social interaction to the timing of giving birth to young, Tudge reveals how birds are uniquely equipped biologically to succeed and survive. And he offers an impassioned plea for humans to learn to coexist with birds without continuing to endanger their survival.
Complete with an "annotated cast list" of all the known birds in the worldΓÇô plus gorgeous illustrationsΓÇôThe Bird is a comprehensive and delightfully accessible guide for everyone from dedicated birders to casual birdwatchers that celebrates and illuminates the remarkable lives of birds.
