,Andz88,2012-06-07T21:31Z,Please get a working english subtitle! The one that comes with the movie dosn't work!! seems like a really good movie but its impossible to watch without english sub!!!
,Andz88,2012-06-07T21:37Z,"Hey thx for the movie, please get a working eng sub. the one that you uploaded dosn't work."

Welcome."
