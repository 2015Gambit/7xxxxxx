My first challenge map.

What you're supposed to do:


The point of this challenge map is to travel the floating islands to collect              resources to fix the nether portal and to escape the islands by entering the nether.

Be wary of the chappel, evil lerks there. If the chapel is destroyed in combat the map will not be completable.

Once in the nether you have finished the map.




Rules: 
	Any destruction of an island is cheating.
	Use of dirt blocks is cheating
	Do not try escaping the islands by riding the water to floor level.



(Note: Untested and uncomplete. This is likely the first level of many in this map)
