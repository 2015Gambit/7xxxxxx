Already answered that to your last question that was posted on the last episode of AOTS"
,risky315,2012-06-07T19:02Z,Was this everything that G4 showed for day 2? I only ask because it was a 6 hour slot on my DVR(which got deleted -.-) And 1.78 seemed small :X
,risky315,2012-06-07T19:03Z,I didn't think about all of the commercial breaks...that probably shaved a solid 2 hours off of the run time :P

Yea, at the beginning Candace Bailey mentions it was 6 hours long, but like you figured out, commercials are cut out and so it's just the actual footage."

I only ask if someone is going to upload the Gamestop live shows?
