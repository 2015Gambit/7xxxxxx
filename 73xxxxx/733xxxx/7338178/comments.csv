,macmaverickk,2012-06-09T08:06Z,I had to take it down because it wasn't seeding properly. I'll re-upload it right now
,macmaverickk,2012-06-09T10:25Z,"Damn, this got popular quick. Seed people, SEED!"
,missusamazing,2012-06-11T00:54Z,"Works great, already learned a lot :) ...have been seeding - thank you so much!!"
,achode,2012-06-12T07:08Z,"It says I need a serial.

,catloop,2012-06-14T10:33Z,how do i add language levels? i have the program successfully installed but i do not know how to add levels on my mac without cds. did this torrent come with the german levels? if so i do not know where they are or how to access them. any help is appreciated
,LimaMike12,2012-06-15T03:43Z,I downloaded the rosetta stone and replaced the mdm.dat file in the resources but when I open it I click on the add a language and it prompts me to insert a disc? Idk what I did wrong? 
,ruvy,2012-06-17T15:28Z,Thank you very much macmaverickk!
,woodsie910,2012-06-17T15:51Z,"German Level 1,2 and 3 installed correctly, yet since I don't have the activation key I can't use the whole level. German Level 4 and 5 won't open. Help please."
,macmaverickk,2012-06-18T02:53Z,"When you double click on any language iso, don't go looking through it, its pointless. Just exit out of the window (but make sure it is still mounted/opened in finder).

Now fully disconnect from the internet (as a precautionary measure to prevent authorizations/registration with Rosetta Stone servers) , open the Rosetta Stone application (which you have successfully dragged to your applications folder and patched correctly). At the top-right, one of the drop down menus (the one next to the question mark) will give you the option to ""Add or Remove Languages"". Click that, and when it says ""Please insert the Language CD in the CD-ROM Drive"", Click Continue. From there, you can select the language you wish to install. If at any point it asks you for product keys, disconnect from the internet, and use this:

Activation code: 
xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx

Phone activation code:
1111-1111-1111-1111-1111-1111

Copy it exactly as you see it here. It may not work the first time. Just be patient. This does not always work for everyone unfortunately."
,suzythedog,2012-06-18T23:00Z,"First of all, thank you so much for the course, macmaverickk! The quality was amazing and the app was working perfectly until the middle of level 1. I did everything you said, disconnected from the internet, used the activation and phone code you put here, but still, no matter how many time I try, it still doesn't wanna register and I can't continue the course. What should I do??? Thanks again!  "
,mrxoxo,2012-06-20T01:14Z,i did everything as well. i tried the activation code and on phone. help? : 
,woodsie910,2012-06-21T00:37Z,Thanks for the advice macmaverickk but unfortunately it doesn't want to work for me. Is there any other way? 
,superconfused,2012-06-23T00:27Z,where's the patch? where's the aplication? i don't get it
,mkoebel,2012-06-25T22:48Z,"Hi, I tried maverickk's advice with the codes but nothing worked to unlock all of the levels.  Does anyone else have this issue?  I'm curious if it is because I am using a different version of Rosetta Stone or something?"
,Mmatthew,2012-06-30T06:29Z,"I think that Rosetta is starting to get privy to this whole backdoor activation code. Since the update (around v3.4.x) I think they got rid of the 1111-111... activation code.
However, there are some cracks available to get around any need for activating. When you don't activate it only allows you to access a certain amount of the lessons. But installing the crack BEFORE the language allows you to get around this. There are several on TPB, and they aren't hard to find. 
But I can't seem to get 4+5 installed, so i don't know everything (but nearly)."
,Mmatthew,2012-06-30T06:29Z,"Great upload, macmverickk, I commend you"
,nmc300,2012-07-06T02:55Z,Russian? Please comment no if it is never going to happen.
,nmc300,2012-07-06T04:23Z,Farsi would be better than Russian but nobody has that :(
,clrfld,2012-07-17T09:17Z,"From the Spanish language pack, a comment by amaggard, this worked for me too (hope it helps):

amaggard at 2012-06-24 03:50 CET:
GUYS. i created an account on piratebay for the sole purpose of telling you all why the crack isn't working for the activation codes. at least, why mine wasn't working. i was copying mdm.dat and pasting it into the resources folder of the package that was in the SAME folder as the readme document. there was no option to replace. what you actually have to do is open a new finder window, navigate to rosetta stone in applications, right click ""show package contents"" and then resources, and paste it there. this time it will replace another mdm.dat file. it worked for me after that, and the xxxx activation codes were valid. i don't know if this is the same reason that you all were having trouble, but i thought it was worth sharing. good luck!"
,hockeya94,2012-08-09T03:51Z,Seed please
,Comrade53,2012-08-16T13:36Z,"Whenever I try to open any of the .iso files I get a little popup window saying ""no mountable file systems"""
,Ruffian_Tux,2012-09-02T17:11Z,"I am assuming that everyone who cannot get this to work did not read the readme or does not have common sence. This download is ONLY the language iso files. Not rosetta stone and not a mounting utility. 

The readme states "" I would suggest Daemon Tools"" as a mounting utility so I would go grab a copy of that first then, once you have it installed and working properly, open the first language iso from the downloaded folder. It will say something along the lines of ""Mounting in progress"" when you do. 

Next you need to get a copy of Rosetta Stone which can be easily obtained from TPB and get it installed and running properly. 

Finally you just open RS, Add New Language, and it will suggest whichever language you have mounted at the time. Once that language is uploadd successfully you may close it's file and open/mount the next language, go back to RS, and upload it just the same.

Hope that wasn't TLDR for most of you but, honestly, I am as tech savy as a time-traveling housewife from the dark ages and some of these comments just astound me with their abundance of ignorance. Not that that is a bad thing, ignorance and all, but come on now. There is a readme for a reason. :)"
