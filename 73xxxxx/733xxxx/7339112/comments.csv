,SonicOwl,2012-06-08T17:23Z,"hey, info on the source of the audio please:)"
,randallytxt,2012-06-08T18:13Z,"I have just watched it and quite a disappointment, fun to watch, but Ridley does a clever re-hash of previous scenes (villain robot with secret agenda like in Alien, people hell-bent to bring destruction to earth, etc., leaving room foe a second, third and other parts, much of the same, boring in the end like Alien 3 was. Money is the goal, not making good original movies."
,tflagger997,2012-06-09T00:26Z,-2 for Quality but no A/V ratings?  That must be bad...
,tflagger997,2012-06-09T00:33Z,"Yep, just checked TvTeam's dup of this and it is pure crap."
,kellogg9,2012-06-09T20:01Z,I dont get it.  Why do these people steal each others video/audio if they know its shit quality with the same problems (missing parts)?
