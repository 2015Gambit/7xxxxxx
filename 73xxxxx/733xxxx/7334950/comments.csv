,bayshafe,2012-06-09T16:21Z,This isn't for Steam is it? And your not using the Razor1911?
,bayshafe,2012-06-09T16:22Z,How do you install?
,KevinsHope,2012-06-09T23:55Z,Read the READ ME document! There are full instructions on how to install it.  This is the RELOADED version.  It DOES NOT require steam.  And I don't know anything about Razor1911.  What is that?
,KevinsHope,2012-06-09T23:57Z,Read the READ ME document! There are full instructions on how to install it.  This is the RELOADED version.  It DOES NOT require steam.  And I think it does use the Razor1911 installer.

,KevinsHope,2012-06-09T23:59Z,"Ahhh...yeah. I think it does use a Razor 1911 installer, but there is no virus in it.  That has been removed."
,bayshafe,2012-06-10T04:00Z,Ok. Because usually there is a weird simpack error whenevry I download it.
,KevinsHope,2012-06-10T05:17Z,Let me know if you have any issues.  I didn't mean to post that last post three times.  Sorry. LOL
,Siliconhobbit,2012-06-13T03:33Z,"Having a problem with this.  The game installs and runs normally.  When you first start the game and get to the point of character creation, you can make your character just fine.  However when you hit 'R' for Done and it asks you to finish and name your character nothing works.  The keyboard will not respond and neither will the mouse.  The only way to exit the game at this point is to End Task on the process.  Restarting the game results in the same thing at the same point.  Any suggestions or fixes?"
,KevinsHope,2012-06-13T17:08Z,"Did you use the ReadMe instructions and follow it to the letter when installing this?  If not, uninstall and follow the ReadMe.  Also, if you were running a firewall, sometimes that will stop game installs from installing properly.  I am running this game just fine and have not had this issue you speek of.  All I can suggest is to uninstall it and reinstall it following the directions I give in the ReadMe.  "
