From multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author Jonathan Maberry comes a major new thriller that combines the best of the New York Times best-selling books World War Z by Max Brooks and James RollinsΓÇÖ Sigma Force Series to kick off the start of a new series featuring Joe Ledger and the Department of Military Sciences. 

When you have to kill the same terrorist twice in one week thereΓÇÖs either something wrong with your world or something wrong with your skills - and thereΓÇÖs nothing wrong with Joe LedgerΓÇÖs skills. And thatΓÇÖs both a good and a bad thing. ItΓÇÖs good because heΓÇÖs a Baltimore detective who has just been secretly recruited by the government to lead a new task force created to deal with the problems that Homeland Security canΓÇÖt handle. This rapid-response group is called the Department of Military Sciences, or the DMS for short. ItΓÇÖs bad because his first mission is to help stop a group of terrorists from releasing a dreadful bioweapon that can turn ordinary people into zombies. The fate of the world hangs in the balance. 

Jonathan Maberry is the New York Times best-selling and multiple Bram Stoker AwardΓÇôwinning author of Ghost Road Blues, the first of a trilogy of thrillers with a supernatural bite. A professional writer and writing teacher, he has sold more than 1.000 articles, 17 nonfiction books, six novels, and two plays.
