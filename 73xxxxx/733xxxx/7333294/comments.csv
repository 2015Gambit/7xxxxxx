,Dcmee,2012-06-23T22:16Z,I get the same thing and did some research about it. Malibu media the creaters of x art are suing thousands of people. Don't download any x art files or they will sue you also.

Use a proxy, there are literally thousands available that don't require you to use credentials, and it's easy to setup your torrent client to use them.

Reference: http://www.ehow.com/how_5110704_use-proxy-utorrent.html

Just search for Socks4 or Socks5 Proxies. Not that difficult guys, so there's no excuse. If you can copy and paste you can setup your torrent client to use a proxy. Protect yourselves."
