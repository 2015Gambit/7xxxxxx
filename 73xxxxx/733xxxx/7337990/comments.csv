NOTE: many mainstream mods have been kind enough to include patches, even updates to this mod for compatibility! Find them on the Nexus! Hopefully CASE hasn't changed too much for it to render guns inoperable...seeding forever here! "
,micnor14,2012-07-27T01:13Z,"Just another note now that I've DL'ed and installed - you probably scared away at least 97% of anyone getting this by putting the whole thing into a single big fat .EXE

@Everyone - It's a self extracting RAR, open it as a regular zip file if you want and extract it manually if you don't trust it. No nasty scripts or exes are hidden inside. Also; it is highly compressed, extracted size is exactly as per the original:
 1.08 GB (1,164,105,248 bytes)
 1,704 Files, 339 Folders
