From Wiki:
Letty Lynton is a 1932 MGM drama film starring Joan Crawford, Robert Montgomery 
and Nils Asther.
The film was directed by Clarence Brown, and based on the 1931 novel of the 
same name by Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes. Crawford plays the title character,
 in a tale of love and blackmail.

The film has since become famous due to its unavailability. It is also 
remembered for the "Letty Lynton dress", designed by Adrian: a white cotton
 organdy gown with large ruffled sleeves, puffed at the shoulder. Macy's 
department store copied the dress in 1932, and it sold over 500,000 
replicas nationwide.[1] Letty, the character played by Crawford, also gets 
away with murder, in a classic example of a Pre-Code Hollywood movie. 

Letty Lynton has been unavailable since a US Federal court ruled on January 17, 
1936 that the script used by MGM followed too closely the play Dishonored Lady 
(1930) by Edward Sheldon and Margaret Ayer Barnes without acquiring the rights 
to the play or giving credit. On July 28, 1939, the US Second Court of Appeals 
awarded one-fifth of the net of Letty Lynton to plaintiffs Sheldon and 
Ayer Barnes in their plagiarism action against MGM. This case was said to be 
the first copyright decision ever to direct the apportionment of profits on 
the relative basis as in patent suits where a patent has been appropriated.

On November 7, 1939, MGM petitioned the United States Supreme Court to 
overturn the Court of Appeals ruling, stating that the questions arising in 
the suit were predicated solely upon the copyright laws of the U.S., and not 
the patent laws. However, MGM did not prevail in this latter action, 
and the film is unavailable even to this day save for some bootlegged copies.
