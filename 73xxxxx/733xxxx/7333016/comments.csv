,eyeonus,2012-06-06T09:47Z,"You still have to add the line +ChallengeMapList=Row=""Combat"",Name=""DLCBatCave"", ID=57, SID=31, PackId=5, bPredator=true, ScriptRef=""GFxUI.Challenge.C57"", Start=""BatCave,BatCave_B1?Flags=Challenge,Challenge_Normal,Pred?NoFadeIn"")

to ""PCGame.ini"" yourself, though, mainly because if I just uploaded my copy of the file, anyone who didn't have the same DLC I have would get errors when their game tried to load DLC they don't have.

The ""Harley Quinn"" DLC torrent does /not/ have this line in that file, so you'd have to manually add it anyway."
