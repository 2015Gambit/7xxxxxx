The science of Hamsa from the Vijnana Bhairava

*********************************************************

Hamsa is the natural mantra,

linked to the life-force of every living being.

It is literally the sound of our breathing.

To understand Hamsa is to become aware

of our unity with the cosmos.

Its secret is revealed in the Upanishads,

in the writings of the great masters, and above all,

in the great tantric treatise, the Vijnana Bhairava.

Commenting on this text, Swami Muktananda

explains the technique and philosophy of this

simple and mysterious awareness.
