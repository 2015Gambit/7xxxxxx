Anyhow, see you in 4 days."
,Chinaski_FR,2012-06-07T23:39Z,"Hi, 
I followed this show between your uploads and bigfish5's

I don't know what went on there, BF1 rips are labelled correctly,
if it can help you:

27 is the chance for immunity, 46 mins
28 is the team challenge, 62mins
this one (according to your info) is indeed the 29th, an elimination episode, 52 mins"
