NICK GILDER - BODY TALK MUZIK - 1981 - VINYL RIP
FLAC & MP3 VERSIONS INCLUDED

This is a vinyl recording which I did using my Pioneer CD Recorder. I then ripped it into Wav files onto my home pc in WAV format and trimmed all the tracks down to size. The LP was mint and the equipment is a REGA P1 turntable and a GRADO gold cartridge and stylus. I think it turned out wonderful. This album is hard to come by, so I thought I'd share it. I've included both MP3 and Flac formats for those who like the choice! Enjoy, and please help me seed it as long as possible.
