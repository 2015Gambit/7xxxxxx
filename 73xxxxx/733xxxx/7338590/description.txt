All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Originator of the darkness and the light. I bear witness that nothing is worthy of worship but Allah, Who is Alone, with no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad (sws, salla Allahu alaihi wa sallam: may the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) is His slave and prophet. Oh Allah, let your peace be upon Muhammad (sws), the final prophet and messenger, his family, his companions and all those who followed him and upheld his traditions until the Day of Judgment.
