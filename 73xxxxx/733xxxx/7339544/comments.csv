,tpb_4_ever,2012-06-08T22:45Z,Apparently there are some problems with the signals. Were aware of this and will have a fix soon.
,bomofoo,2012-06-08T23:15Z,"Well on my end it is asking for a password so what might that be?

Thank you"
,abrahamx1,2012-06-08T23:22Z,Very very thx tpb_4_ever I wanted to ask if this route works in the original steam Railworks 11.7b?

,abrahamx1,2012-06-08T23:27Z,very very thx tpb_4_ever I wanted to ask if this route works in the original steam Railworks 11.7b
,browneggs,2012-06-08T23:37Z,"Thanks lads, been waiting for this all day :-)"
,addy700,2012-06-08T23:38Z,"Yeah, thanks so much for this. Will buy this + the other most recent ones when I get paid this month. And yeah, I'm having problems with most signals, though the ground signals in the depots and stuff are fine. All the others are missing."
,EAC350,2012-06-09T00:06Z,"@abrahamx1 yes it works but some addons don't work due to protection. If this happened, you must install SKIDROW "
,abrahamx1,2012-06-09T00:30Z,"thx EAC350 :) I wanted to ask if there is a version for version 11.7b SKIDROW without downloading the entire game from scratch, only the files?

Thx :)"
,tpb_4_ever,2012-06-09T00:34Z,"Please download this torrent to fix the missing signals.

,EAC350,2012-06-09T04:06Z,"Abraham if you are running the game with skidrow then you have to launch it from your default railworks folder (C:/Program Files(x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/railworks/""RailWorks.exe"") and not from Steam as usual"
,RWIG_Peter,2012-06-09T04:15Z,"Help how do I install this. I know how to install RWP but when I unzip this its shown as files under folders assets and contents and the package manager wont allow me to load these.

,HopelesslyAddicted,2012-06-09T06:40Z,"Hi. I added the folders into the Railworks 3 in programs files and replaced the folders with the ones provided in this torrent. However, whenever I try to load a scenario, it'll just say there are some files removed.
Am I installing correctly or? It seems to be working for everyone else. Thanks guys."
,HopelesslyAddicted,2012-06-09T06:40Z,some files missing* sorry haha.
[T],EvilCraze,2012-06-09T10:48Z,works !
,voltrix128,2012-06-09T11:04Z,Thank You tpb_4_ever!
,acftus,2012-06-09T15:40Z,Can the Skidrow version work alongside the Steam version?
,bomofoo,2012-06-09T16:41Z,@acftus I have both installed with no problems but mine are on 2 different HDD's
,acftus,2012-06-09T20:00Z,Many thanks for that
,browneggs,2012-06-10T19:11Z,"@RWIG_Peter: All you need to do is copy and paste those folders (Assets, Contents etc) to your Railworks Folder. Your Railworks folder will already contain those folders, all you are doing is adding new files to them. If it asks you whether you want to overwrite anything inside the folders, just answer Yes. 

An .rwp file is just a zip file  anyway, I sometimes find it quicker to open the .rwp file in winzip/7zip/winrar and just copy and paste the folders into my Railworks directory."
,akki143,2012-06-10T19:51Z,thanks tpb_4_ever
,class156,2012-06-11T22:21Z,"Mine dont come up in the routes folder

,lolxd17,2012-06-14T14:35Z,"Did download this and installed everything. I also installed the signal fix. But when loading a scenario I only get a error message that trains could not be loaded and the whole map is grey. I don't see anything exept signals and trains and the error message :'( There are no tracks, no buildings, nothing. Was looking forward to play this. What did I do wrong?"
,bomofoo,2012-06-14T19:27Z,"They are releasing an update to the route tonight to fix signals and other stuff, will we see this?

Thank you"
,Indomiel,2012-08-19T18:23Z,"Hello,
The career scenario don't work, it says ""Unable to load file - Tracks.bin -""
I have the SKIDROW RS and the ""london to brighton missing signals fix"" too.

Anyone has an idea ?"
