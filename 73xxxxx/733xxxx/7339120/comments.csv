Barely watchable, worse than VHS quality."

P.S. Why post crap?  You have the skulls.  Oh, I get it.  You just post stuff, you do not bother to take a look and see how unwatchable it is.  

That might get in the way of the Greenest Skull of the Year contest.  (This goes for all Green Skullers who endlessly post dups and low quality when we already have enough to choke on).  

For those that want to argue it is for free - bite me.  They are making money on this somehow.  This is not intellectually stimulating (like hacking), so there are rewards or else they would not embarrass themselves putting out all the crap they do.  EZTV is the only trusted one anymore..."
