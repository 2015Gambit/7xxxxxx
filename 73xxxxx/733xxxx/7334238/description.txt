This tool allows you to make a flash drive for Windows 8. To create an ISO file flash need to install Windows. Run it and specify the file. After graduating from the program you can install Windows 8 directly from the stick.

Implementation process has three stages
A. Formatting your flash format NTFS (required)
Two. Extract all the files on a USB-drive (this may take a long time! VERY long time)
Three. MBR is a bootable USB

Requirements:

- Administrator rights in order for that to write USB boot code
- USB flash drive for at least 4 GB
- ISO image of Windows 8
