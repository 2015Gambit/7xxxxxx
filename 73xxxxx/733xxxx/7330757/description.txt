The COMSOL Multiphysics engineering simulation software environment facilitates all steps in the modeling process ΓêÆ defining your geometry, meshing, specifying your physics, solving, and then visualizing your results.

Model set-up is quick, thanks to a number of predefined physics interfaces for applications ranging from fluid flow and heat transfer to structural mechanics and electromagnetic analyses. Material properties, source terms and boundary conditions can all be arbitrary functions of the dependent variables.

Predefined multiphysics-application templates solve many common problem types. You also have the option of choosing different physics and defining the interdependencies yourself. Or you can specify your own partial differential equations (PDEs) and link them with other equations and physics.
