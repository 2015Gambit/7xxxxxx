,bawl4,2012-06-08T15:50Z,Thanks for the UL.The quality was better than the other cam rips.
,lastjedi,2012-06-09T02:53Z,you know what sucks about the ending is the engineer was supposed to be in that chair when this happened.since he is dead how did he get back in that chair?you think ridley scott would have thought this through.but he didn't.i seriously doubt the alien would move that body and put it in the chair.and put his helmet back on.
,ronangel,2012-06-09T04:15Z,You CUNT do you realise that you may have spoiled the whole movie for some people with your stupid spoiler comment. I for one have tried to avoid reading full write ups for this reason.thanks a bunch!
,ronangel,2012-06-09T04:19Z,Thank you for adding spoiler to the movie ending for us all.
,rowhan,2012-06-09T13:35Z,"@lastjedi:

You cocksucker, spoiling shit for people. Also, you're obviously retarded because you don't realize that Prometheus is the first of TWO prequels to Alien. ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED. Now, quit being such a faggot and delete your comment. "

This is NOT the same planet from Alien. It's entirely different. Hence the different aliens and planet name. The planet in Alien wasn't yet surveyed."

Thanks Dingus.I'll just tack it on the end of the movie . Shit if I can pretend that a prequel is actually something new and exciting,instead of a  way to recycle old props and rehash someone out of the terrible burden of actually using their brain to create something different.Then I can sure as shit do this and sit back to watch it like I've never seen it before. I find the most exciting/interesting part about todays' movie making is the uncanny ability to sell everyone the same old shit and have everyone call it icecream then ask for more. Now that's Hollywood Magic ! 
 All Cinema is about being only one thing anymore...a cash cow.There is no doubt about it.Let's all milk it till the tits fall off!!!,  is the battle cry of supposed Cinematic Genius today.They simply aren't fueled by passion and haven't the balls or need anymore Imight add,to snap and snarl at each other for supremacy.All to busy patting their own backs and smoochin each others turd shoots with meaningless awards for everything from the best breather to the most wonderfull shoe tyer of the year."
,mrandyx,2012-06-10T04:37Z,Thx for upload the end
,Maurstar,2012-06-12T08:46Z,"@jastjedi That's because the planet where Prometheus takes place is not the same planet where Alien took place. Alien took place in LV-426, the atmosphere was considerably different from the atmosphere of LV-223, where the Prometheus landed. If you have a closer look, at the ""engineers"" pyramid altar there's a display of a xenophorm. Prometheus on its own does not lead to Alien. It just opens more questions regarding what the Nostromo crew found in Alien.. sorry for the spoiler, though!"
,hackmo,2012-06-13T19:25Z,what a douchebag!
,siegeh,2012-06-18T02:51Z,"@lastjedi
He said that this is a different planet then the first Alien, Alien and Aliens take play in LV-426 while this movie takes place in LV-223
secondly for all the idiots who say ""HURR DURR YOUR SPOILED THE MOVIE !!!!11!!1!1!11"" your fucking retarted, this IS THE FUCKING ENDING if your crying and bitching about a spoiler part then don't fucking watch you idiots"
,jayton420,2012-06-18T20:11Z,tduckin: Do you still do ebook requests? I am looking for ean 9781101188002 and 9781101046289.
,iclouds,2012-07-06T09:58Z,"could you upload ""insanely Great"" by Ken Segall in epub please? Thanks."
,lobochino,2012-07-18T04:57Z,"@tduckin
If you're still taking epub requests, how about doing ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy. I believe it's the ""Millennium Series"". Thanks, you rock!"
,plimsole,2012-07-26T00:17Z,"Um try paying attention. Prometheus takes place on 
LV-223. Alien takes place on LV-426 ergo not the same planet not the same engineer."
