Physics for Entertainment by Yakov Perelman

Published in 1913, a best-seller in the 1930s and long out of print, Physics for Entertainment was translated from Russian into many languages and influenced science students around the world. In the foreword, the bookΓÇÖs author describes the contents as ΓÇ£conundrums, brain-teasers, entertaining anecdotes, and unexpected comparisons,ΓÇ¥ adding, ΓÇ£I have quoted extensively from Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Mark Twain and other writers, because, besides providing entertainment, the fantastic experiments these writers describe may well serve as instructive illustrations at physics classes.ΓÇ¥ The bookΓÇÖs topics included how to jump from a moving car, and why, ΓÇ£according to the law of buoyancy, we would never drown in the Dead Sea.ΓÇ¥ Ideas from this book are still used by science teachers today. Both volumes are translated from the Russian by A. Shkarovsky and were designed by L. Lamm and were published by Foreign Languages Publishing House.
