The master of modern cinema Stanley Kubrick was born in New York, and was 

considered intelligent despite poor grades at school. Hoping that a change of  

scenery would produce better academic performance, Kubrick's father Jack (a 

physician) sent him in 1940 to Pasadena, California, to stay with his uncle Martin 

Perveler. Returning to the Bronx in 1941 for his last year of grammar school, there 

seemed to be little change in his attitude or his results. Hoping to find something 

to interest his son,Jack introduced Stanley to chess, with the desired result.  

Kubrick took to the game passionately, and quickly became a skilled player. Chess 

would become an important device for Kubrick in later years, often as a tool for 

dealing with recalcitrant actors, but also as an artistic motif in his films. This 

torrent consists of master's all directed movies and documentaries,including his 

first movie fear and desire.
