From his early hits with the James Gang through to his tenure with the Eagles ΓÇö as well as a successful solo career ΓÇö Joe Walsh remained one of the most colorful characters in rock & roll, lending his distinctively reedy vocals, off-the-wall lyrics, and expansive guitar leads to a series of AOR staples including ΓÇ£Funk #49,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Rocky Mountain Way,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£LifeΓÇÖs Been Good.ΓÇ¥

Analog Man, WalshΓÇÖs first solo album in two decades finds longtime Eagle contemplating life in the digital age. Co-produced by Jeff Lynne, the disc ranges from the Indian-ragga-influenced ΓÇ£The Band Played OnΓÇ¥ to the twangy ΓÇ£Lucky That WayΓÇ¥ ΓÇô both of which feature WalshΓÇÖs new brother-in-law, Ringo Starr, on drums. ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm on the perimeter of the Beatles family, and they really take care of their own,ΓÇ¥ says Walsh. ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs taken my whole life up a notch to be around them.ΓÇ¥

Nashville-based Tommy Lee James, who has penned hits for such acts as Taylor Swift and Reba McEntire, co-wrote some of the new songs.

Analog Man is WalshΓÇÖs first solo outing since 1992ΓÇÖs Songs for a Dying Planet, which came out two years before hell froze over and his Eagles reunited.
