After I have downloaded the movie and verified it's quality I will allow it to stay open in my torrent for a day or so and that's usually a decent amount of seeding. Just fyi, the best downloader I've experienced so far is yify. good luck"

A real pleasure to see a comment like this instead of the complainers who whine about download speed 1 hour after a torrent has been posted.
Good on you alex"
