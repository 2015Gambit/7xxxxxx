,kjh7503,2012-06-08T20:01Z,"I really don't think this guy has any reason to be so adamant against ""stealing"" his music, when about 20% of what he creates is actually original.  Putting lyrics on top of someone else's melodies may by some loophole in American law make it ""yours"" enough that the original artist can't sue you, but half the difficulty of creating good music is creating memorable/catchy original melodies.  

Then there's the fact that he clearly rips off Trey Parker's ""hardcore"" voice (first heard in Orgazmo) in multiple songs.

Not to mention, the quality of vocal work and instrumentation is akin to a children's CD.  It's clear Brent either realizes he's not that good of a singer, or he thinks it's funny to go all ""cartoony/goofy"" with the way he sings.  It makes it annoying for me.  And assures I'll likely never share this album with anyone in real life.

So...we're looking at children's songs that have potty mouth.

Not worth paying for.  Not for me anyway.   This is not something I'd listen to over and over again.

I'm probably gonna listen to it once or twice, and then just keep seeding it to piss him off.  

Do you think this guy doesn't own a single pirated music album, movie or game?  Somehow I doubt it.  

I do think he's a very talented musician but I'd like to actually hear some more ORIGINAL work from the guy before he's justified in being a total dick to people for ""stealing"" HIS music."
,seedleSs71,2012-06-22T18:42Z,He does own pirated shit. If you watch Final Fantasy with Beer-rics. He is clearly playing a SNES on his PC with a Playstation 2 controller. Also he has openly admited he uses emulators and roms.
