,montmarte,2012-06-14T11:04Z,"can you please upload episode 11 ? 
thanks!"
,thisispurx,2012-06-15T06:59Z,"[b]This IS episode 11 -- I just downloaded it to be sure - and it is.  But in addition, this has a different file size (161.43 MB) from the other one & was ULed the day after the real E11 aired (6/7).[/b]

As we already know by now, The other torrent is mislabeled as E11 has a file size of 145.5 MB, ULed on 6/1 (before E11 even aired) is actually E10. 

I would have been nice if they added the tag REAL in torrent name: The.Pauly.D.Project.S01E11.REAL PDTV.x264-SYS

This shows that a prior release had an incorrect season/episode number & this is the corrected one. (Similar to a REPACK tag in title if something is wrong with the actual torrent) -- "
