Plot: Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston star in this laugh-out-loud comedy about leaving it all behind. After George (Rudd) loses his high-stress Manhattan job, he and his wife, Linda (Aniston), hit the road and wind up crashing at Elysium, a free-spirited community of hippies, tree-huggers and the occasional nudist. Featuring an all-star ensemble cast including Justin Theroux, Malin Akerman and Alan Alda, “Wanderlust” has “more laughs than I’ve had at the movies in a very long time” (Carrie Rickey, Philadelphia Inquirer)..
