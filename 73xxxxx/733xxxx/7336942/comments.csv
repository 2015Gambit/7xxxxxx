,manipwr3,2012-06-16T08:33Z,"@benishot777:
are you sure you installed dlc to the location where you 'actually' installed the game?"

,jazzprowl,2012-06-28T11:19Z,"Win 7 with SP1, black box version of Arkham City (that you must skip movies before they end - the most popular I think)

I've tried twice, reinstalling the main game and expansion. Game works but DLC icon doesn't appear. Also the main menu doesn't change its language - maybe it is a problem ?
So entering the game and exiting to main menu doesn't work. But I don't know what is ""run benchmark"" how to do that ? Maybe this or sth else will help. 
I especially got the main game again to play DLC and what a terrible disappointment. There must be  a sollution to somehow get it work because DLC is installed for sure, there are changes in game files - ""dlc installed""."
