*Extract 'Harley Quinn's Revenge dlc.rar' and install using setup.exe.(Just keep pressing Next but the location should be defined to where the root game is installed)

*Open folder 'Update to v3 plus crack' and extract 'Update.rar' to the desktop

*Move both folders inside Update folder (i.e. BmGame and Binaries) to the root installed directory of Batman Arkham City."Merge Folders" and "Overwrite" all files when prompted.

*Now open Crack folder copy the file 'PhysXExtensions.dll' to Batman Arkham CityBinariesWin32

*If the main menu of the game comes in some other language use 'BAC.DLC.MenuFix.rar'

*Run the game but the DLC play option wont come.Either run Benchmark or load your normal game and then exit back to Main Menu,the dlc option would be there.U need to do this everytime you run the game.

*Enjoy and leave thanks!
