I am not 100% certain, but I think Pirate Bay takes issues with torrents uploaded to 'Music' that contain the artwork and other cool 'extra's that you included. The Comic Book is AWESOME!! Note to people : the .CBR file is just an archive, similar to .RAR or .ZIP. Just 'extract' and you'll be pysched."
,Oblivilot,2012-07-14T21:17Z,"Note - these files are fine, the problem is in the file naming. They are tagged fine, and play fine in iTunes - HOWEVER - many of the files have extremely long file name, and I have been getting warnings from the system telling me that 'these files may harm your computer'. (in windows 7) After I change the file names, to just the track and song name, that warning goes away. One more note - in windows, to view the folders sorted by disk and track, be sure to select ""track"" and ""part of set"" for the folder view options."
,Oblivilot,2012-07-14T21:18Z,"Example: 

rename files titled like this:
Grateful Dead - 1972.05.07 - Bickershaw Festival - Wigan, ENG (Disc 1) (%Y) [FLAC] 07 China Cat Sunflower_.mp3

to be like this:
07 China Cat Sunflower_.mp3"
,Oblivilot,2012-07-14T21:21Z,"For instance, when in iTunes, adding the entire folder, I noticed some shows were only getting a few songs. Example - 5-10-72 only imported the first 3 songs, despite the rest all being in the folder. I just renamed them all, and did a re-import, and it's all good, imports all the songs into iTunes. The album artwork all comes in, for the most part - and the source .jpgs are high res, they look sharp -easy enough to add that into any files that have problems."
