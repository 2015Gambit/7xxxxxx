== LinkedIn Pass database ==
Content: Password hashes from the LinkedIn hack.
Source: Original forum post posting hack
Format: Passes are stored in SHA-1 and compressed in a .rar

No usernames are used in the file, if they were I would remove them. When I get finished cracking I will probably post the list.

There are 6 Million passwords, this is not the full DB since people report their passwords are in there; although a few people noted that their unique passes are in there. Right now it's all over the news (2012/Jun/06) grab a article and start reading.
