King Henry VIII had a fascinating and enlightening relationship with art. He
came to the throne as the Renaissance swept across Europe, yet England's new
king never lost sight of the medieval chivalry of his forefathers. In the first
of a two-part documentary, architectural historian Jonathan Foyle looks at the
palaces, tapestries, music and paintings created in Henry's name and questions
whether the art he commissioned compensates for the religious treasures he would
come to destroy.

In the 1530s, King Henry VIII was at a crossroads. In his desperation for a new
wife and an heir, he had broken with Rome, divorced Catherine of Aragon and
married Anne Boleyn. Isolated and vulnerable, he needed a powerful new image as
head of church and state.

In the second of a two-part documentary, architectural historian Jonathan Foyle
looks for clues in the king's art to glimpse what was going on inside Henry's
head as he faced his darkest days.
