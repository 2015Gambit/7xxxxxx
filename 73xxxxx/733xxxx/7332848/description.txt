Over more than 35 years of touring and recording, Alejandro Escovedo has played punk, rock, folk, country, and Latin music. But no matter the style, EscovedoΓÇÖs songs tend to default to a dreamy drone. Sometimes Escovedo plays loud, with wildly reverberating guitar and rattling drums; sometimes heΓÇÖs more muted, sticking to the soft hum of a violin or cello over acoustic guitar. But Escovedo is a cool customer regardless, singing in his pleasantly raspy voice about a life spent on the road, watching people and places slip past him. ThereΓÇÖs an effortlessness about EscovedoΓÇÖs songs, such that listeners could easily miss that heΓÇÖs singing about desperate folks in desperate situationsΓÇöand that sometimes the desperate person is Escovedo himself.
EscovedoΓÇÖs 11th solo album, Big Station, is more deceptive than most. Working again with his recent songwriting collaborator Chuck Prophet and producer Tony Visconti, Escovedo has made his most consistently cheery-sounding album
