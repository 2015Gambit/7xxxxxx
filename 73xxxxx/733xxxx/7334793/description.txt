===Capo 2===

Capo is a revolutionary tool that helps you learn the music in your iTunes library. By slowing your music, and presenting a detailed spectrogram, Capo lets you hear and see your music like never before. 

==It's your music==

No longer do you have to rely on the musical tastes of others to learn music. Drag songs right from your music collection into Capo to start learning them.

==Detect, and Enter Chords==

Figure out the chords in your music using Capo's sophisticated chord detection routines. Or, enter your own easily using strings like ΓÇÿbbmaj7ΓÇÖ or ΓÇÿf#maj9ΓÇÖ.

==Pitch Adjustment==

Capo lets you adjust the pitch of your songsΓÇöso you can change their key or fine tune them to match your instrument.

==Music Export==

Take your Capo-adjusted music with you. Export speed- and pitch-corrected audio to your iPod, and play along when and where it's most convenient.

==Tab it Out==!

By simply drawing atop the spectrogram, Capo will generate tablature automatically for you. It really doesn't get much easier than this!

==Markers==

Use keyboard shortcuts to mark verses, choruses, bridges, and other important points in your songs so you can return to them later.

==Looping=

Repeat difficult sections slowly, playing along with your favorite artist. Speed up gradually as you get better.

==Effects==

Capo lets you modify panning, adjust a 10-band graphic equalizer, and apply vocal reduction to help you isolate the parts of the music you wish to learn.
