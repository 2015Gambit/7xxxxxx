,FureeTutawk,2012-08-28T00:35Z,"This says that it is dual-autio English-Hindi. But the English doesn't play. Unless you count ""shut up"" and ""Ok."" No extra files included, have no idea how to get the English part to perform. Guess the uploader decided to leave out those instructions. If you understand Hindi, this is a good video and good audio (the hindi part, anyway). If you don't understand Hindi, and don't already have knowledge on how to get the English to work, don't bother downloading. If you do know how to get the English to work, be kind enough to explain so other folks will also know. Key word: Kind. Thank you."
