Can this work with Nik plugins?
Thanks."
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2012-06-09T08:59Z,"@ Cibaka

yes it works .. i pointed to:
PhotoshopXPortable > App > Photoshop > Plug-ins folder.

But:
Nik Software plugins are notoriously messy plugins, that require installation, visual c++ installation, registry keys, and even install a service.

Why would you want to use that with this?

this Photoshop is 'Portable'... meaning for people who hate installation, and trash in the registry.

If you want to use Nik Software plugins, you might as well install Photoshop..


F.Y.I
Plugins are just shortcuts.. if you require plugins.. than you really do not know how to use Photoshop. You really should learn how to do it manually.. that way your Photoshop skills improve. 

Note: the best plugins are the kind that do not require installation.. the kind that you can just copy into the Plugins folder... i.e. Frischluft, etc."
,xpmule,2012-06-09T12:55Z,"good point i guess which is why i won't learn how to use it..
Can't stand photshop tried many times to get into using it for close to 10 years or so and it seems like unintuative bloated over priced piece of crap !

I almost cried when adobe bought Macromedia.
I thought oh great here we go there
gonna buy and bury the only real
competition to photoshop (fireworks)
Happy to see they did NOT
Fireworks CS6 was released recently
and it works greats and loads FAST !
And it ofcourse still supports photoshop AND fireworks plugins

Screw photoshop
Fireworks FTW !!!111"

u r d MAN!


attention to people who have error on starting app
uninstall adobe flash players first, then run
also other adobe products can cause error
remove them, run portable ps

great job
