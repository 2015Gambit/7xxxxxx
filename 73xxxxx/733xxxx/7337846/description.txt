Synopsis: this release is a multilingual update... i've cleaned up the code..
i've re-written a few code for better performance.. and removed Bridge to 
reduce the size... Photoshop is up-to-date as of June 7th, 2012. 
There were 2 updates: CameraRaw 7.1 and CSXS. I also configured Photoshop in a 
special way to reduce load time while keeping as many features as possible. 
This is probably the hardest.. we all use Photoshop differently.. so what
i need.. you may not.. etc. I did my best to keep the general public in mind.

How to Install: launch PAF installer, select your language, extract to desired 
location, launch "PhotoshopXPortable".

How to Change Language: simply re-run the installer. Your settings will be
maintained, along with your presets, and any changes to your plugins.
