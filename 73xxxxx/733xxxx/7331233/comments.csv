Here Ridley repeats himself, not like a re-make, too smart for that, but a re-hash with a few new elements, but the same mindless plot, fun for thrills at the moment, and afterwards, nothing, just to make a quick buck."

,dlarrym1111,2012-06-06T22:57Z,"@robsai: Quote, ""Prometheus is probably the WORST movie I have seen in years.""

I disagree, but you and myself are entitled to our own opinions.

Let me ask you this, Just curious, YES, I suppose this film can stand on its own as a story in and of itself, but to really understand what its all about you would need to have seen the 1ST ALEIN film by Ridley Scott. It hit the theaters in 1979. (about a year or so after LUCAS released the 1st STAR WARS film in 1977-78). 
My point is unless your in your mid 40's, you probably haven't seen the original ALIEN film unless your a big fan of the SCI-FI genre.
After all, ALIEN came out 33 YEARS ago, and it was Rated R. SO.... unless you were 18 years old in 1979 OR, your parents or older friends, brothers/sisters took you and you were younger then 18, then so be it. I was only 12 years old and I fell into the group of having a friend with an older sister who took us. IT was SCARRY as HELL!! I remember being traumatized for a few weeks! I saw it later when I was 19 yrs old, and it was still disturbing, but A great story/horror film.
The other aspect is that RIDLEY SCOTT was not involved in any way with the other ALIEN FILMS.
Scott had ALWAYS considered making a sequel/prequel, based on the identity of who had a cargo hold SLAM FULL of those ALIEN EGGS?? and WHY did they have a cargo hold slam full of those eggs. What purpose did they truly serve?

FYI or TWIMC (To Whom It May Concern) Another ""PREQUEL"" is already being shot as we speak. Its due to be released in late 2013 or early 2014. 
It continues where PROMETHEUS ended. (don't want to spoil the plot.)

My MAIN POINT is that if you haven't seen the 1st ALIEN film, A lot of what is going on in Prometheus will seem as if it has many ""loose ends"", and may not seem as good a movie.

In my opinion, it is a GREAT GREAT movie! ! !
I am now waiting to see the next prequel due out the end of next.

The quality of this upload is so-so.

It was watchable, but it took some fiddling with the contrast/color/brightness/saturation/gamma settings to get a better picture.
The audio was also poor, but some adjusting got it where it was good enough.

I already have tickets to see it in our local IMAX theater. When compared to this CAM, it will look FANTASTIC!!!!
take it easy ALL!!"

Ridley Scott you need to retire. This is the worst film I have seen in a very long time. Maybe even the worst film ever! (lol it really is that bad.)

Not only is it not worth watching, but it is not even worth downloading for free. In fact ridley you should pay the viewers money for the damages their brains have experienced from watching this total piece of pooh.

If you really think you need to see this? Think again because you seriously do not. Watching this film may put you off from ever wanting to watch a Ridley Scott/general sci-fi film ever and ever again.

,hopedeny,2012-06-12T00:39Z,"everyone has an opinion, but mine is the only one that matters. such angry people on TPB and YouTube."
,darthbashar,2012-06-12T04:01Z,"I am an avid sci fi movie viewer and I must say that this movie is a 6 out of 10.  It is worth a watch but the director really missed the boat on suspense building, character development, and concept development over the human origins take on the movie. It felt dumbed down.  Anyway, my two cents no one cares about...lol"
,nebster0,2012-06-12T06:23Z,"Don't listen to these people!  This movie was phenomenal! Acting was great, plot intriguing, writing flowed, and visuals were incredible! 
 As for this cam torrent, I didn't download it because i cannot stand even the best cam torrents. I just had to leave this comment to defend this movie from the haters who obviously can't rate a good movie.  My advise, scrape up what ever money you can and see this movie in the theaters to experience its pure epic awesomeness. If you were a fan of the original Alien movies you'll especially love it.  Ridley Scott did an amazing directing job.  "
,geno2k3,2012-06-12T06:36Z,"I had to login just to tell you guys that this movie SUCKED ASS.

I saw it in the theater and it totally disappointed me.

If your expecting a intellectual cool sci fi movie that will blow you away. Kind of how the new Star Trek movie did. You will be disappointed for sure.

If your looking for a dumb plot with lots of blood and stupid characters. YOU'VE FOUND THE RIGHT MOVIE."
,Human_Desire,2012-06-12T09:57Z,"Good way of putting it geno2k3 :P

Please do not go and watch this film, otherwise it might give them enough money to want to make more! :("
,Tieden,2012-06-12T21:31Z,"Human_Desire, geno2k3. How about you two stop whining about it. It's not your kind of movie, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean others won't. Also the movie has a 74% good rating so obviously you two are just a loud minority. 

How about this people, if it looks good to you go see it. If you're a Scott fan, go see it. If you just like sci-fi movies, go see it. You may like it or not, it's still an experience. Don't let anyone tell you what you're going to like because their tastes aren't yours. "
,blackestsheep,2012-06-12T23:31Z,"every one is saying this is ridleys  worst film

i guess you havent seen  robin hood"
,CyUK,2012-06-13T00:36Z,"geno2k3 that comment just boggles the mind with how utterly inaccurate it is. The Star Trek movie has one of the biggest sci-fi plot holes in history and it totally removed any credibility that film (and your comment) had, the time travel bit simply doesn't work, they just didn't get it at all... It's as bad as DĂŠja Vu in terms of getting it utterly wrong. Seriously bad. Intellectual sci-fi? Star Trek was the opposite. 

Prometheus, without giving anything at all away here to people currently downloading or those who haven't seen it yet, is all about evolution. That's the main theme Ridley and the writers are going with. 

The characters are not as important as the theme behind it. Is it a prequel to Alien? Not directly but it does show you the origin of the Xenomorph, if you understand evolution. If you don't then the entire premise of this film will go over your head, as it appears to have done with most of those who dislike it."
,snowstone,2012-06-13T03:34Z,over 4000 people downloaded this even tho everyones saying its a bad copy lol
,opjm,2012-06-13T06:19Z,"I liked the movie and this download is alright for a free and recent copy...I just have a hard time saying Prometheus when I am high and I have to get high to watch this flick but this copy is much better when you are high on weed than watching a blu-ray of Insidious after you have been tweeking on Meth for 18 hours straight and then trying to go shopping at a WalMart at 3AM and all the customers look like that freaky red demon dude from Insidious and you break out is a massive sweat because you think you crossed over into that creepy dimension but then you find the Snickers Ice Cream bars in the frozen aisle and the rush of cold icy air that hits your body when you open the door to retrieve that frozen delight reminds you that you actually are at work at that WalMart store and your bosses are watching you on security camera because they have no clue that you have to be on Meth to work the graveyard shift at ANY Walmart, in particular the one you work at where the customers actually do look like that red freaky demon dude from Insidious.

,darmok75,2012-06-13T13:33Z,mr opjm that was the all time best review i have ever read review 10/10 
,Human_Desire,2012-06-13T14:27Z,"If any of you out there find this film good. You seriously need major assistance. For there is something wrong with your life, brain or mind. Maybe you are just too dumb to have an opinion.

As for the wallmark retard employee example, I rest my case. That druggy junky lameo can't even do their job straight and thinks its cool to bragg about it. Which totally explains my point and why this retard states the film is 8 out of 10. (lmao)

Although they did state they could not watch the film unless on weed. Which says a lot about Ridley Scotts effort. Remind me never to go to wall mark during the graveyard shift rofl."

watchable cam version and the movie itself was actually quite good despite all the negative comments. 
Its been my experience that what one critic calls awful is what another calls good. Watch it and make your own mind up. that's why you have a mind after all.

Thanks for the upload scenebalance. "
,tuomaspap,2012-06-13T23:12Z,"i bet 99.8% of the haters of this film here are fanatic god fearing morons that can get it through there skull that maybe man wasnt created by God and thats why they find the film ...""boring , pseudo psientological"" and so on remarks... the other .02 % are just retarded !"

You totally discredit your own review when you do that. To anybody that is new ""DO NOT "" goto these websites, they are just cons looking for personal info and above all $$. Torrents are free, so if they charge, they are not legit!!"
,spoons1991,2012-06-16T06:10Z,Not the worst movie in the world but not the best like most people say it is. They just like the effects and what not. Lot of plot holes. Few things that don't even make sense. Can't really explain them without giving away parts of the movie. People need to actually think about the shit they are watching not just accept it. But watch it choose for yourself. Don't be a sheep and like it just because the people who can't think for themselves like it. And just because a movie has an awesome trailer doesn't mean the movie is awesome. And stop getting all angry because people are voicing their opinions. That goes for both sides of the argument.

,STLUGLY,2012-06-17T05:05Z,"Based on other recent cam releases:
A: 6
V: 6

1.6gb for an average / subpar cam.   Has some artifacts from time to time and weird color shifting.

Other cam releases of late have been a much better quality, closer to a R5.  This looks like a straight up oldschool cam release,  ie: filmed with a baked potato onto a VHS.  Then they rented out that VHS around 300 times before deciding to rip it.

Either way, thanks for the up, but I'll wait for a better release. "
,soj712,2012-06-17T08:04Z,"My thanks to the uploader, but this movie is a waste of time and effort... honestly an attempt to recapture past glory. However, if you have lowered expectations it maybe a good flick to you. (I do not say any of that as a result of this being a CAM!)"

,edfutkina,2012-06-28T04:01Z,"I have not downloaded this file, so I won't talk about video and audio quality.

However, I went watch this movie in Scotia Bank Theatre (Toronto, Canada) yesterday evening (7:35PM precisely).
I payed extra and watched this one in UltraAVX (width of screen is almost as wide as IMAX but not as tall, but the sound quality is better) to enjoy the movie I have waited for years to come.
Before go on, let me tell you that the last movie I watched in theater was Avatar (James Cameron's one, not the Airbender one made by M.K.S.).
I don't go theater very often, so it was big thing for me to take round trip of 3 hours and pay extra for a movie, meaning I expected that much from this movie.

When I was watching this, things I noticed was, the 3D work was really bad.
There's part where I couldn't really tell what the hell was standing, and the face doesn't even show clearly.
The only part that 3D work seemed perfectly good was where one of the character (I won't spoil the name here) triggered navigation system.
Also, there wasn't any character development but many unnecessary acts.
More than half of the characters doesn't even seem to be needed.
Only character that lived to stand the expectation was the main female character.
Also, some of the actions characters made just doesn't make sense or will leave you with a question ""why the fuck he did that?""
No answers wherever I look for it (though people have some discussion on it).

Riddley Scott put too much attention on mystic figure, Christian symbolism into this movie, he failed to grab attention of viewers, build suspense, character development.
It might even leave you with a question if this movie made any logical sense.
I watched whole Alien series in elemetary school, and waited sequel/prequel since 1999 (because video version of Alien 4/Ressurection came that year in my country).
Some people say this movie was really bad, some say it's good, but my reaction to this movie is ""What the fuck did I just watch?""
Yes...it could've been better.
If Riddley is thinking to create sequal to this movie, I will probably watch it again, as Alien series fan, but I really hope he will do it right this time, cause I couldn't find anything right with this movie."

Sometimes I appreciate peoples comments on movies especially the ones that are low budget and don't even have an IMDB rating.  Your rant is taking up just as much space as the comments that you are condemning.  Are you really bitching about people bitching?
