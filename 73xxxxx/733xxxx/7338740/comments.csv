,Gounis,2012-06-08T19:04Z,"This is actually the same as ""21 Jump Street 2012 BDRip XviD-Larceny""

What extremezone did is joined the 2cd scene release, extracted the AC3 audio, transcoded from 448kbps to 384kbps and then remuxed resulting in slighter lower size than the scene release.

What you get here is transcoded crap, better grab the original

,JPHawk57,2012-06-27T06:01Z,Again as on Thor you have the fps way below the 30 fps that the human eye can interpret. Which is the cause of flickering. Can this be corrected on TPB? Every video should be no less then 30 fps to truly be a good quality. It is not just you but it seems a trend with every team and individuals out there giving us these torrents. I want to try this movie but the quality is really low with this fps.
