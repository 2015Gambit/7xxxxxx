,Viciously,2012-06-08T22:35Z,"Hello new one. I dont download from you or TPB now but let me tell you something good. Its 'Formula1', not 'Formula 1'. There is no space between Formula and 1."
,MissAlice,2012-06-08T23:14Z,"My God Viciously you are some arrogant AH if it was not for footy uploading I for one could not see Formula 1. We don't really want any comments from you if you don't download from PB anymore why are you making comments on here, piss off and better still drop dead asap. Make room in the world for decent people your not wanted."
,cgi4me,2012-06-08T23:42Z,"@Viciously - Go Away !!!!!
@Footy - thank you very much for your time and effort. Here in the U.S. there are many, many people, including myself, who really appreciate watching ""Formula 1"" - but local TV coverage is either really bad or non-existent. So, thank you."
,Viciously,2012-06-09T00:32Z,I told him something good. Its Formula1 not Formula 1. Neanderthals. 
,alfonzobonzo,2012-06-09T03:34Z,"What a bizarre, idiotic and downright incorrect post.  The most basic research (such as watching a race) would disabuse you of the notion that ""Formula1"" is in any way correct.

The FIA website clearly states the correct name of the championship, which is the ""FIA Formula One World Championship"".  If you strive for accuracy then that is the correct name to use.

Furthermore, a very little additional researching will show that Formula One Licensing BV, part of the Formula One Group, owns the trademarks of Formula One; the F1 logo, ""Formula 1"", ""Formula One"", ""F1"" and the ""Sweeping Curves device"" shown before Grands Prix.

The only place that ""Formula1"" is used is for the domain name 'formula1.com', for the simple reason that spaces are not permitted in domain names!

Many thanks to the original poster for the upload, please don't be put off by idiots like @Viciously."
,Viciously,2012-06-09T05:06Z,"Yes, but no one writes 'Formula One'. lol this discussion happened a long time ago and most users complained of uploaders naming it 'Formula 1'. Its better to write 'Formula1', 'F1' than 'Formula 1' on torrents. Easy to find. Write 'Formula1' and his torrents wont be seen. Got that?.

Anyways, I am now, automatically, an idiot and you are the righteous one. 

Have a nice day everyone."
,SerSpec-V,2012-06-09T09:13Z,"^ Formula1 or Formula 1 who cares it means nothing. Just type ""footy"" and his torrents will be seen. Got that!"
,notinmontreal,2012-06-09T20:05Z,"i think this upload is excellent. i don't really understand why someone will come to a website to complain about it, when they have a choice of going back under their rock and living their little life without making dumb comments."
