City Homicide,

The first season is incomplete and poor quality (had a drive fail and had to replace best I could) if you have season 1 would love to have it

DonΓÇÖt download from downunder TV they suck and will kick you off with no explanation!!
 
I love Aussie TV. I was trying to upload and having trouble so I logged on thru a friends computer (who I had just turned on to the sight) and for some unexplained reason they kicked us both off!!!!

Just share your  Aussie TV here on  The Pirate Bay (for Free) and IΓÇÖll keep seeding good Aussie TV
