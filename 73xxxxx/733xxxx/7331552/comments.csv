[T],Mr.Stifmeister,2012-06-05T19:37Z,"Just a reminder, when installation is complete, wait for the box that comes up to be finished before you press Finish.
And in that box, wait for it to say ""Press any key to continue..."".
Also dont forget, when starting the game with MadRidersGame_x86.exe, rightclick and run as admin.

Have fun! :)"
