Frozen Eternity hail from the high altitudes of the Colorado Rocky Mountains and are fast becoming one of the fiercest sounds in the metal scene locally and nationally. Featuring a massive sound of grandiose keyboards, prodigious guitars and bass, and intense drumming expanding a comprehensive range from extreme brutality to majestic melody, Frozen Eternity surpass the trends of modern metal. They set their foundation with memorable leads and brilliant riffing, but with new material under way, it can easily be stated that Frozen Eternity are about to make one of the biggest impacts on metal yet!
