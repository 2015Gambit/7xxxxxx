I upladed this torrent last time but found that some of the tracks were messed up in the conversion process, so I fixed them and put them in their own seperate folder here. I've also included the artwork for each show. Thanks to insinuendo for uploading the original FLAC torrent and a big special thanks to jps176 for his hard work in ripping the music, takig pictures of the trunk, and scanning the extras.
