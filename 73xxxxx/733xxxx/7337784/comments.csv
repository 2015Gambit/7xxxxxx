,Oblivilot,2012-07-14T22:22Z,"For anyone experiencing issues with Windows and/or iTunes, on these files, here are some tips.

1.) some of the file names are good, some are not - the file names that are really long give error messages, something about 'this file may harm your computer'. Take note, that most of the files in the 'fixed' folder are the Pigpen song ""The Stranger (Two Souls in Communion). That's a file title length issue, not a corrupt file problem. The files are fine, they are just too long in character length. Since they are all tagged properly, just edit the file names in Windows explorer before importing into iTunes.

EXAMPLE:

rename files titled like this:
Grateful Dead - 1972.05.07 - Bickershaw Festival - Wigan, ENG (Disc 1) (%Y) [FLAC] 07 China Cat Sunflower_.mp3

to be like this:
07 China Cat Sunflower_.mp3

2.) In Windows, to view the folders sorted by disk and track, be sure to select ""track"" and ""part of set"" for the folder view options. Right click the bar where it says 'name' or album - there are check boxes next to items. Be sure to check box 'part of set' to get the disk #'s, which will enable the files to be sorted properly. They are tagged fine in iTunes, so that part isn't an issue.

3.) After I renamed the files, they imported into iTunes properly. Prior to renaming the files in windows explorer, iTunes wasn't recognizing a bunch of the songs.

4.) last, I renamed my folders and albums titles to read 1972-xx-xx for each show, (IE, 1972-05-04) so they would sort by the date of the shows in order, rather than alphabetical by city name."
