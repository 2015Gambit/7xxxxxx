does anyone know hot to pass the message to the capper, 25fps isn't enough for fast ballgames imho.
Such tournament should be capped @50fps.
Tried to watch it last night but this stroboeffect is so tiresome, at least for my eyes :?
Anyone else with the same issue with football games capped at 25fps?

Btw. BBC coverage for the opening game was very enjoyable, Gary Lineker in the studio with Alan Hansen (Scotland caps 1979-1987), Clarence Seedorf and Lee Dixon (ENG caps 1990-1999) + Alan Shearer (ENG caps 1992-2000) from the stadium :)"
