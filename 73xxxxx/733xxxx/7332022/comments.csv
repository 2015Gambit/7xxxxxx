,tomlowefilmmaker,2012-06-06T03:56Z,"Greetings. I am Tom Lowe, the person who spent two years of his life living out of a Toyota pickup truck to make this film. If you enjoy it, please consider buying a copy from our website at TimeScapes.org or at iTunes, or maybe giving it as a gift to a friend, so we can recover the money we invested in the film, and then make some more films for your enjoyment. :)

Tom

,marcomarti,2012-06-08T03:18Z,"After watching that movie I have to say, that we human are disconnected from the ""truth"" of why we are settle on this beautiful planet and that we suppose to develop in spiritual to achieve next level. What we actually did is hell on earth to ourselves. No one is responsible for that shit and mess but us.   "

,wd123411,2012-06-10T05:48Z,"@tomlowefilmmaker I downloaded the highest resolution copy in the hopes of getting a sense of the quality that went into your product, however I note that around 01:36 the continuous gradient making up the CG artwork seems to be quantized.. can you confirm which if any of your retail copies aren't affected by this?

From the trailer it seems best to wait until I have a bona fide HQ copy before watching. Thanks, looking forward to it.

Watching using VLC on MacBook Pro / OS X Lion, built in LCD color profile. Tried using Quicktime instead of VLC, but the problem still persisted."
,em-n-bee,2012-06-13T10:34Z,"I made an account just to say this.
I admit I was tempted to download this like many other films. But being a photographer myself and aspiring to be as skilled as Tom Lowe, I decided against downloading this and am going to purchase the special edition blu ray copy.

I can't wait to watch the behind the scenes! Seriously... I'm not being sarcastic. "
,Mellexx,2012-06-14T20:33Z,"Tom, as a fellow photographer & videographer I'm as well going to purchase a copy from you I do wish I could afford to purchase the full 4k version but 2k will have to do for now :) I'd love to be able to do something like this someday"
,montare,2012-06-14T23:32Z,"@tomlowefilmmaker - I came to d/l out of curiosity, wouldn't have bought. Saw your reaction to it on nofilmschool, so I decided to buy it out of curiosity, instead. The world needs more creators like you who don't lawyer up and freak out."
,em-n-bee,2012-06-16T04:20Z,"Just commenting again to say I've purchased my Blu-Ray copy and eagerly awaiting for the complimentary download to finish!

I hope one day I can take time off to do a similar film."
,tomlowefilmmaker,2012-06-20T08:50Z,"Thank you to those who enjoyed and purchased  the film.

wd123411, I think you might find banding on nearly all the copies.  I wanted to encode this film at Hi10P, but was having trouble figuring out how to do that with Adobe Media Encoder.  The file I am working from is a 4K 4:4:4 master, extremely high quality.  Can anyone give me some tips for encoding this film at 10bit, for people who really would prefer that quality over 8bit?  My contact info is listed at my website, if someone might be kind enough to email me any tips. Regardless, I plan to make some higher bitrate versions of the film in the next couple of weeks.

,Aiden_Ford,2012-07-04T14:28Z,"Impressive!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I watched it on the LG HDTV via my laptop Asus K52JT using the HDMI. I thought it doesn't work.
but could you upload ""4K Edition"" (4096 x 2304, 21Gb file) and the ""4K Cineform"" (4096 x 2304, 140Gb)"
,noskop,2012-07-04T14:48Z,"Thanks a lot Tom ! I buy this AMAZING dvd right now ! I had lost faith in humanity, now i fucking love life and human like you ! Really incredible and awesome picture ! Really awesome nice job ! I want more and more ! Thanks thanks thanks and thanks a loooot ! "

i saw the article about this page on techcrunch and registered to post this...

i am no video encoding expert, but i can guess that most people will point you to the x264 codec (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X264). there is a 10bit version and the developers and many knowledgeable people are on the doom9 forum i believe (http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=77)"
[T],xxbel,2012-07-06T03:29Z,woah... can my 1080p player play this? :D
,theshape31,2012-07-07T20:21Z,"Thank you Tom, I'll support you as soon as I can get a job!
