,Lucixir,2012-06-11T10:15Z,"I downloaded this with high hopes. I have tried many video payers and only the sound plays, there is no video. Not sure why this would be ripped as a MP3 format, because I cannot get video in Winamp, Windows media player, creative, etc. Just a 900mg sound file. Any ideas of what to use to view this properly?"
,klip1,2012-06-11T23:42Z,Best cam ive seen in a long time.  Sample looked solid.  And it also got a laugh out of me.  Watchin full movie when roomie gets off work tonight!  I'll get back after that!
,A_V_rate,2012-06-12T04:12Z,"Lucixir - use VLC media player. It's the best media player out there, plays pretty much any file type. And it's free."
,klip1,2012-06-12T10:02Z,"A little audio sync issues, but overall excellent!

Couldn't be happier!  Roommate and I enjoyed this film.  Quality is definatley watchable.  Audio is a match.

Dont wait any longer with this release.  Honest."
,Flare69,2012-06-12T19:12Z,"It's still a cam, but a very, very good one.  Glad I downloaded it.

,A_V_rate,2012-06-13T01:11Z,"Watched the sample and it seems very watchable. Good quality for a cam.
As a CAM:
V - 8
A - 8
Some people claim to be having sync issues. This problem can be easily fixed by using VLC media player, choose the ""Tools"" menu and then choose ""Track Synchronization"" to adjust the audio with respect to the video."
