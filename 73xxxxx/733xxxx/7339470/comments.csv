,kuebel,2012-06-22T14:42Z,How is it possible that all YIFI 3d movies run smooth on my 3d LG via internal media player but the IMAX movies (under the sea and born to be wild) to not run at all...my tv says: incorrect file and does not even start to play.....although those movies are the same format as the other files like journey 2 or grren lantern which work perfectly???
,kuebel,2012-06-22T14:44Z,of course i was talking about the IMAX movies also uploaded by YIFY
,mantikor777,2012-06-22T15:37Z,Cinavia is such a pain in my backside.  I get around it by using players that don't have it but it is SUCH a pain.  Gotta find a hack for that SOB soon.

Also- what's worse than DVD, is that the audio is in stereo only...just download a DVD rip and get a correct rip...

YIFY needs to stop uploading into the highres section...and also provide more details about the damn torrent."
