S02E01 - Haunted Mansion Ghost Mill
Air-date: Wednesday June 06th, 2012

In the second season premiere, John Zaffis and his paranormal team are back. Joined by new
investigators Jesslyn and Jason, John and the team visit Charlet Sosh in Warsaw, Kentucky.
Since moving into their spacious 200-year-old mansion, the oldest standing house along the
Ohio River, Charlet and her son, Ryne, say they have been experiencing frightening phenomena.
They report witnessing shadows(caught on amateur video), feeling blankets being pulled down
on them, and seeing the bedroom door swing open on its own. The property dates back to
Native American times, and many items like arrowheads, pottery and even a bone have been
unearthed in the backyard. Could some dark history be connected to one of these objects,
causing the activity thats scaring Charlet and her son?

After the eerie Kentucky investigation, the team travels to Huron, Ohio to help out Lisa Kelly,
owner of a demolition company thats scheduled to implode an abandoned grain mill. Workers at
the building have been walking off the project, terrified by apparitions, screams, and equipment
inexplicably being shifted around. With demolition of the towering facility set in just two days,
John and his team have to act fast to determine whether there is merit to the claims, and if so
to remove any haunted items before the place is blown to bits.
