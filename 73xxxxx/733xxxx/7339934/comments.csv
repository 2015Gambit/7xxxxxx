,mfreitas_rj,2012-06-09T04:52Z,I think the iFly 3.0 need a Crack for it not working with the new modifications.
,maxlk96,2012-06-09T10:09Z,"@mfreitas_rj What's the problem you are having?
For me it's working great...?"
,nawrot1993,2012-06-09T13:51Z,"Not working, black screens on the plane. you have a ncrack ?"
,maxlk96,2012-06-09T14:44Z,Hmmm.... Any of you downloaders got it to work or is it just me?
,mfreitas_rj,2012-06-09T15:32Z,"Aircraft is without the black screen after 2.1 crack crack it works like version 2.1 and not 3.0 as.
 M Freitas."
,maxlk96,2012-06-09T19:13Z,"I did this. Installed the 2.1, replaced the gauges with the cracked one. Installed this one. And it works great! Why isn't it working for you!? ;)"
,mandrus1,2012-06-09T19:13Z,"So after overwriting 3.0 gauges by 2.1 gauges You still have 2.1 version right? 

Can You upload Your 3.0 gauges mate?"
,maxlk96,2012-06-09T19:19Z,You replace the gauges. Than install the 3.0
,maxlk96,2012-06-09T19:28Z,Done https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7342056/[FS9]_iFly_737NG_Feature_pack_(Gauges_only) If anybody needs it. Please comment if it works. Or if it doesn't work ;)
,truenorther,2012-06-09T19:47Z,"All the gauges are blacked out.  Needs new crack! replacing the Gauges with 2.1 seems pointless, you'll be missing the new features. besides there are 2 new planes 700ER & 900ER, 2.1 does not have Gauges for those."
,mandrus1,2012-06-09T20:46Z,"Ok, let's try it now :)"
,maxlk96,2012-06-09T21:04Z,@truenorther ^ It's right above you ^ :P
,mfreitas_rj,2012-06-09T21:33Z,"I'll test the 3.0 crack. Notice if it works! 

M. Freitas"
,PC0,2012-06-10T02:52Z,"
nothing works

1 - uninstalled everything
2 - Installed the 2.1
3 - replace gauges 2.1
4 - installed feature pack
5 - run the sim: dont work, gauges black
6 - replaced gauges 3.0 and yet nothing works!"
,rafaelesp,2012-06-10T11:54Z,"It doesn't work at all. The feature pack installs new gauges, and thus it needs new cracked gauges, or it will not work."
,maxlk96,2012-06-10T19:35Z,"The Feature pack doesn't seem to work for any of you. It should had worked, it's not even mine. I got it from a friend. So I'll delete this Torrent. Sorry for wasting all of your time and bandwith!"
,dash8captain,2012-06-15T18:57Z,"So delete the blasted torrent already as you said you would. It is of NO use to anyone here. I think you put it out here to screw up peoples' system just like that crap ass AES version 2.23. Leechers be advised, try these torrents out on another machine first if you can. That way you do not mock up your Sim. Be smart"
,atkin12,2012-06-22T18:00Z,"I get an error when I try to install 3.0 ' missing file ' .Have 2.1 installed works fine.
??"
,maxlk96,2012-06-26T19:55Z,"Ive tried to delete it. It won't go away... Not my fault! NO. I WOULD NEVER PUT ANYTHING HERE TO FUCK YOUR COMPUTERS UP. I tought it would work. Because it did for me, and my friend.... Sorry for uploading this!!!!!"
,maxlk96,2012-07-17T17:18Z,"Oh.... Good, than i'll stop trying to delete it ;)"
,mroschk,2012-07-30T13:47Z,"Hello,

has anyone the Ily Pro Cockpit Builders Edition or Prosim737?

iFly : http://www.flight1.com/products.asp?product=FL1-IFE-001
Prosim737: http://prosim737.com
I'm searching this for a long time.

Thanks"
,OURZ011,2012-08-07T14:56Z,"This torrent is NOT WORKING!!!! This Feature Pack is have the original installer! Not the de-wrapped! 

If you copied the gauges, you have 2.1Version, not the 3.0! I think this is logical. 

The plane is run greatly, but the new features are not available, because you have 2.1!

...
Please upload a photo from your iFly Cockpit, I want to see it, because I want to check the features!"
