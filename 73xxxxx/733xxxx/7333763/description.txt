BBC 2 - if drugs were legal - 12 jan 2005 (incl. debate)

If... Drugs Were Legal, talks about a fictional story of the death of two girls (Tanya Williams & Josie Mills) who were taking legal drugs in a legal nightclub. The story follows the search for the killers of the two girls. It turns out that the girls were given an unlicensed blend of drugs by an illegal dealer. The drugs were originally made by an anti-drugs campaigner, in an attempt to have drugs recriminilised.

The world is based on the idea that all drugs such as cannabis, LSD & ecstasy are legal and heroin are available on the National Health Service for addicts.

The IF series of drama-documentaries examines the existing problems with drug prohibition and hears the arguments in favour of legalisation.

Based on rigorous research and interviews with experts, the programme hears the arguments for leaving the most dangerous drug of all - crack cocaine - illegal, and examines how a legal and regulated system of drugs would work.
