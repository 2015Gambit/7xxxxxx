BBC 10 Things You Didn't Know About Tsunamis (2008)

Iain Stewart journeys across the oceans to explore the most powerful giant
waves in history, with ten remarkable stories about tsunamis. These massive
waves can be taller than the biggest skyscraper, travel at the speed of a jet
plane and when they reach land, rear up and turn into a terrifying wall of
water that destroys everything in its path. These unstoppable, uncontrollable
forces of nature caused the ruin of an entire ancient civilization, may have
played a small part in the demise of the dinosaurs, and in World War II were
used as a weapon. Yet astonishingly, two men who surfed the tallest wave in
history - half a kilometre high - survived.
