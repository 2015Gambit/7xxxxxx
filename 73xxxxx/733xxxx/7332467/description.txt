"It Happened 'That Night'"

A summer has passed since Aria, Emily, Hanna and 
Spencer found out about Mona being "A" and Maya's 
death. With the terror seemingly over and an 
alleged murderer now behind bars, the town of 
Rosewood is slowly healing from old and new wounds 
and trying to get back to normalcy. Each of the 
four girls spent their summer in different ways - 
Aria taking a photography class, Spencer taking 
college courses at Hollis, Hanna taking cooking 
classes with Caleb and Emily building houses in 
Haiti. But what looks normal for each girl is not 
necessarily so, as all four are hardly over what 
happened. With post-traumatic stress, anger and the 
acquisition of more secrets the four Liars are 
anything but fine. Now all back together and coming 
upon the second anniversary of Alison's 
disappearance, the girls find themselves back on 
the defensive when a shocking event rocks Rosewood.
