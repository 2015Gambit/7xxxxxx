I know how much of a pain it can be to download lots of different passwords from lots of different places, so I decided to make one massive .txt file with them on in one place. Use it for dictionary attacks or for the sake of downloading it. I really don't mind as long as you enjoy it! 

It contains passwords ranging from Facebook names, common passwords and to the completely random. Hopefully it is enough for whatever you want to use it for. 



The version contains 145,109,214 unique passwords.
