,dumbson,2012-06-07T00:46Z,what do you mean seemovies?  are there other animated movies that have come out on piratebay today?
,Bean-Bandit,2012-06-07T09:09Z,"As far as the torrent and the quality itself, thumbs UP.

As far as the movie goes it wasn't until about 1/2 way thru that it really started to get really good. The whole Elite grp was kinda boring to me but when Superman saw who they really were that's when it really got better for me.

@belllehyper
why don't you look at the files in the torrent fool. It's were it says Files and it shows you right there that it wasn't mp4 and since it wasn't then you should have gone somewhere else."
