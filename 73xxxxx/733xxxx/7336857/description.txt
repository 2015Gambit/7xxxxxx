The debut recording of the COLLEGIUM MUSICUM Den Haag, lead by Claudio Ribeiro is a lavish release of the Austrian Radio in their prestigious ORF Edition Alte Musik label.
The Hague-based, historically informed baroque orchestra, formed by former students of the Royal Conservatory and founded in April 2006 plays pieces by 
- Telemann: Wasser Ouverture in C;
- Vivaldi: Concerto in d RV.566;
- Bach, J. S.: Concerto in F BWV.1057;
- Wassenaer: Concerto Armonico in f and
- Rebel: Fantaisie.
The album also includes a cheerful DVD (Claudio and the Chicks) documenting the orchestra's participation at the Brunnenthaler Konzertsommer 2007, filmed in a beautiful baroque chapel which includes interviews, rehearsal and concert clips with music by Alessandro Scarlatti, Georg Muffat, Telemann, Dietrich Becker and Rebel.

Young maybe but top-level soloists include Sara DeCorso, Kayo Sato and Diana Lee-Planès (violin); Gudrun Haggadottir (viola); Rebecca Rosen (cello); Chen Goldsobel (violone); Inês d'Avena, Susanne Dick and Isabel Favilla (recorder); Peter Tabori and Lidewei de Sterck (oboe) and Claudio Ribeiro (harpsichord) the ensemble's maestro.
