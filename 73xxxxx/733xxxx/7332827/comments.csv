Your an idiot.I just uninstalled and reinstalled and it works fine.
For those who want to run this.
Install the program,once you get to the restart or restart later screen.choose later.
They copy crack,go to installation directory C/programs/lock my pc or something?and paste it it.overwrite,then write click on the lock my pc application icon (same as crack)and make a shortcut to your desktop."
