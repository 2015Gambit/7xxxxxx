Tomorrow's Eve is a German progressive metal band who has changed a lot since this particular release. They formed in 1999, and now only two (Rainer and Oliver) of the original five members remain.

On The Unexpected World, I would say that their music was truly the best in their career. They take hints from many genres and artists, namely jazz, Dream Theater, Vanden Plas, but their work is not derivative at all. 

On the contrary, I consider this album a breath of fresh air, consisting of warm and crunchy distorted riffs, driving rhythms from Sascha and Ralf, atmospheric clean guitar/keyboards, and quite entertaining concepts in the lyrics. A true gem in the progressive metal world.
