""Don't think greping for you hashed password works, because they contain salt, and the salt is not there.""

How about this info:
""The hashes were unsalted SHA-1 hashes"".

,uberlol,2012-06-07T21:36Z,"@666Gott Yes, so they say. But if that was the case, greping for the hash from ""password1"" would certainly return some results. uniq -d SHA1.txt shows that no two lines are the same. Don't you think two users would have the same pass? Or have I seriously misunderstood something here."

I did find '000001e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8' which is the SHA1 of 'password' with the first 5 characters removed. A bit disappointed my pass wasn't in here."
