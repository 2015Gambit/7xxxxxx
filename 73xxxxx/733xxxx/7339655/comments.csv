,muLineZu,2012-06-09T18:00Z,"There is no Solaris 2002 Blu-ray release yet (only Tarkovsky's 1972 Solaris is released on BD). This is a HDTV Rip cropped so the TV logo won't be seen (in the upper left corner there's still a remain of it). The first 3 minutes are watermarked ""scOrp"" in the lower right corner - Trade Mark?
Thanks, but I'll stick to 720p HDTVRip x264-ExtraTorrentRG, best release yet..."

Thanks scOrp  and dude7001.

@ ofpirate,
how do 720p BD and 720p HDTV differ in terms of picture quality? I ask because others with monster TVs have told me they can perceive subtleties which I totally miss on my 17 inch 1600x900 screen. The few times I have had access to a large screen I have not noticed a correlation between file size and quality, nor between BRrip and HDTV formats - only between differently skilled encoders."
