,mentallyours,2012-06-06T11:56Z,"The Boston Celtics defeated the Miami Heat 94-90 Tuesday in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals at AmericanAirlines Arena.

The Celtics now lead 3-2 in the best-of-seven series.

Forward Kevin Garnett led Boston with 26 points, including two free throws to seal it in the closing seconds. Forward Paul Pierce added 19 points, with none of them bigger than a 3-pointer to put the Celtics ahead with 52 seconds remaining.

The Heat, which led most of the opening three quarters, were led by LeBron James' 30 points. Guard Dwyane Wade had 27 points, but the Heat had no other players in double-figures.

Forward Chris Bosh returned after missing the last nine postseason games because of a strained abdominal muscle. He played just 12 minutes, scoring nine points and grabbing seven rebounds. Bosh did not play in the fourth quarter when the game was on the line"
