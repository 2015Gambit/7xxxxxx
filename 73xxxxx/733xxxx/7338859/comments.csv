2.Install game
3.Copy the folder from Skidrow to game folder
Easy as any release from Skidrow.
Game is a cheap copy of Sins of a solar empire :))Not really good..."

,wizzard4all,2012-06-16T18:52Z,"I'm getting an error
It says ""Failed to load dll"" it asks for a file called ""mono""
Anyone have any idea what's up?
I'm running Win 7 64bit"
,Reborn36,2012-06-20T19:44Z,"@wizzard4all Do you have the minimum specs to run the game?see if you have enough RAM memory.
Also try replacing the mono.dll from your computer.You could try a dll fixer which will automatically find the problem and fix it or replace the file manually,I found the file here  dllwindows.com/download/mono-dll (just add the www in front)"
