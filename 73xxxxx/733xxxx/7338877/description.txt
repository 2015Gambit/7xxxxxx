HELLO......
           Today this station broadcast the show in a mixed fashion. The 2nd part of hr2 was a rebroadcast of the opening part of hr1.....and so on....and so on

They actually went for 4 hours to try to fix it...and I am still trying to sort it out. 

Lately, a lot of the stations have been stepping on Rush as he is speaking....cutting away too soon and coming back from a break after he's already started talking. Where I am the stations do it all the time. This station really blew it today. I am putting it up here exactly as it was streamed so you will know it wasn't me that did this. Un-edited...un-broken...just as I got it. The segments are mixed up. So I am trying to organize them but it's taking too long...
I hope to get this fixed and do another upload later on tonight...late...I suspect there might be a part of the show missing. 

If you don't want to bother with this just wait till later on when I put up one from a different station...or fix this or just download amuck5's recording.
