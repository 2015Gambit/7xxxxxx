,laned130,2012-06-07T22:35Z,"@mimicik - Google ""VLC"" - www.videolan.org - open source, plays everything, no dodgy 3rd-party codecs to install, runs on any platform.

@xeliam - this looks awesome! Will seed to at least 500%!"
,RathHood,2012-06-08T20:55Z,"Sorry about my first comment, thx for uploading it  its the best quality/size GOT torrent out there."
,jctcom,2012-06-09T07:25Z,"I am not sure why it states below the Magnet link ""Problems with magnets links are fixed by upgrading your torrent client""  I am using the latest version of utorrent and unless I find a normal torrent link first magnet links still show up with invisible file listings.  How is this resolved exactly?  Or are they talking about some other issue and that one just doesn't count?"
,Night_89,2012-06-11T03:14Z,upload some other shows
,mothermonster,2012-06-13T04:55Z,"Thank you so much for this torrent! This is pretty fantastic quality for the size. I watched the play back today, and everything looks good so far. Also it downloaded within about two hours. I was actually watching season 1, and I finished 2 1/2 episodes by the time this finished. I'm going to rate this based on its file size and visual quality on my imac i5. 

A: 9/10
V: 8.5/10

I will seed of course for as long as I can, maybe all night since I think this is worth it."
,furash,2012-06-30T19:32Z,"Thanx @xeliam its the coolest and quite lithe,game of thrones season 2 torrent uptil now...720p with resolution 1280*720...i luv it and will seed as long as i can..A-10 V-10

,gurudev1000,2012-08-13T21:13Z,This torrent deserves to be on sites like KAT. Please upload it there because it's good to not put your eggs in just one basket :)
